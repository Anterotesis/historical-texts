She was sound and savoury in her Doctrine and pub∣lick Minstry, and tender and affecti∣nate in Christian Advice and Counsel, to the Comfort of the Afflicted and Exercised in Spirit, declaring, that the Way to the Kingdom of God is thro' Tribulation; agreeable to the Ancient Account we read of in Holy Scripture. And she did frequently press <HI>Friends</HI> to Sincerity and Uprightness of Heart. And altho' the Lord had given her a large Gift, and a good Utterance, she was not forward to appear in her pub∣lick Service; but as an immediate Con∣cern came upon her: She was a good Example in her frequenting <HI>Meetings,</HI> both on the First and Week-Days; and was there often made Instrumental to the stirring up of the pure Minds of many, by way of Remembrance, to our mutual Comfort, by her fresh and Living Testimony.</P>
<P>Her Husband also (who departed this Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me Time since her Decease) was an Honest Zealous Friend, and her fellow-Helper in the Work of the

<HEAD>JOHN THORNTON's Account of his Neighbour Elizabeth Stirredge.</HEAD>
<P>I Having Opportunity, by dwelling in <HI>Hempsted</HI> several Years before she departed this Life, had an inti∣mate Acquaintance with her; and as the Lord had given her a Measure of his holy Spirit, to guide, lead and direct her in the Way of Peace, He also gave her a large Talent in a pub∣lick Testimony, in which she was very serviceable in our Meetings; be∣ing attended with Power, Wisdom, and true Zeal; so that her Testimony was sound and savoury, to the com∣forting of the Upright hearted; she being many Times drawn forth to encourage the exercised and afflicted in Spirit, and led to declare that the Way to the Kingdom of God is thro' Tribu∣lations. And also would frequently press Friends to Upright-heartedness, Sincerity and Integrity; she being also a good Example in her Conversation. And altho' the Lord had given her a

large Gift in a Verbal Testimony, you she was backward to appear therein, except she found it was immediately required of her. She was zealously concerned against that Spirit that le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> into Separation and Division, and al∣so against all manner of Deceit and Hypocrisy. She commonly had a sharp and piercing Testimony against such that the great Enemy had so misled. She was a diligent Frequen∣ter of Meetings, both on First and Week-Days. Her Husband also being an honest and zealous Friend, and since her, departed this Life; they being both serviceable to TRUTH and FRIENDS, are missed. But what shall I say? the Will of God be done; for fully satisfied am I, that they are gone to Rest, and entred in∣to Joy and Happiness, where all Sor∣rows cease, and Tears are wiped a∣way.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN NEALE's Testimony concern∣ing Elizabeth Stirredge.</HEAD>
<P>IT is in my Mind to write something as a Testimony concerning my dear and well-beloved Friend <HI>Eliza∣beth Stirredge,</HI> deceased.</P>
<P>She was one who received the Truth in the Love of it in her young Years, as I have heard from her own Mouth, and as in her following Book is more fully related: Wherefore I need say no more of that, but descend to write something concerning her, during the Time of my Acquaintance with her, which was about Fifteen Years.</P>
<P>She lived for that Time about Se∣ven Miles from us, and sometimes would come to visit our Meeting at <HI>Watford,</HI> whom I and many more were glad to see, she being one whom the Lord was pleased to bestow a Ta∣lent and Gift of the Ministry upon (which he is pleased to give unto both Male and Female, they being all one
<PB REF="002815_0014_0FE6434195B386D8"/>
in Christ Jesus) that she might tell unto others, what God had done for her Soul; for those, (and those only are they) whose Mouths the Lord o∣peneth, that do and shall shew forth h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Praise. And indeed her Testimo∣ny was reaching and affecting; my Heart hath been well affected many Times in Meetings with her Testimo∣ny; for she spoke as one having Au∣thority, almost to Admiration, consi∣dering the Weakness of Body where∣withal she was pretty much afflicted▪ but the Lord was with her, who gi∣veth Strength to the Weak, and his Power was her Support.</P>
<P>It was her Lot, many Times, when she came to our Meeting, to lodge at my House, (my dear Mother <HI>Han∣nah Neale</HI> and she being very intimate Friends, and heartily loving each o∣thers Company) and indeed her Com∣pany I also loved, for it was pleasant and delightful to the honest-hearted; and I may say, her Discourse was edifying to me.</P>
<P><PB REF="002815_0015_0FE642EC757B3D08"/>
And I have been affected to hear her give an Account of the Sufferings, deep Trial and Exercises of Friends, which she, and many others went thro' in early Days; how when they were going to a Meeting, they went as it were, in Peril of their Lives, by reason of wicked and ungodly People throwing Stones, Clods, and other Things at them. And altho' many were they that rose up against them, yet how wonderfully did the Lord preserve his People in that Day, thro' many Tribulations! many of which various Exercises and Trials that di∣vers of our worthy Antients passed thro', blessed be the Lord, we in this our Day, are freed rom.</P>
<P>Much might be said concerning this our Friend; but in short, she was a valiant Woman for Truth on Earth, a Mother in <HI>Israel,</HI> and a worthy faith∣ful Elder in the Church of Christ in her Time.</P>
<P>And now my Desire is, that we who are of a younger Generation, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et left behind, may in our measure be
<PB REF="002815_0016_0FE6434E736086E0"/>

<P>Tho' our Loss of such Worthies be great, yet their Gain is far greater; for doubtless they are entred into those Mansions of eternal Bliss, where Joy unspeakable and full of Glory is their Portion, and that for evermore.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning her Husband James Stir∣redge, by the same Hand.</HEAD>
<P>HE was a Man with whom I was well acquainted for many Years; and I may say of him, he was an ho∣nest upright-hearted Man, one that feared God, and eschewed Evil; zea∣lous for the Honour of God, and for the Promotion of his Truth on Earth; a hearty Lover of faithful Friends, and in his Conversation amongst Men, I think I may say blameless.</P>
<P>A zealous Man for Monthly and Quarterly Meetings of Church-Go∣vernment;

his Desire was, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in such Meetings, might so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up∣on the Lord to receive Councel from him, as that they might act in the Wisdom of God, that every thing that is contrary to the Principle of Truth might be kept out of them, and that nothing but Truth might have the Preheminence.</P>
<P>In fine, he was a meek-spirited and lowly-minded Man, more in Substance than in Shew.</P>
<P>I went to visit him in his last Ilness, when he was very weak in Body, so weak, that he spake very low, but very sensible, and was in a good Frame of Mind and Spirit; so that I was refreshed in my Visit, and he was pleased to see me.</P>
<P>He was very patient under his Af∣fliction, and I believe was fully re∣signed to the Will of God.</P>
<P>He departed this Life in the 10th Month, 1708 at <HI>Hempsted</HI> in <HI>Hert∣fordshire,</HI> and was buried at Friends Burying-Ground at <HI>Wood-End,</HI> in the same County▪</P>

after a very strict Manner, so that I can truly say, I was much a Strang∣er unto the World, and its Ways. In my tender Years I was one of a sad Heart, and much concerned and sur∣prised with inward Fear what would become of me when I should die: And when my Lot was to be near any that would talk rudely, or swear, or be overcome with strong Drink, I dreaded to pass by them; and when I did hear it thunder, O the Dread and Terror that would fall upon me; and I would get the privatest Place that I could to mourn in secret, thinking the Lord would render Vengeance upon the Heads of the wicked. When I saw the Flashes of Lightning, Oh! think I, whither shall I go to hide my self from the Wrath of the dread∣ful and terrible God? Thus was I possessed with my Soul's Concern, before I was ten Years of Age; I was so filled with Fears and Doubts, that I could take no Delight in any thing of this World. And when I grew up to riper Years, I went to hear those
<PB N="4" REF="002815_0021_0FE642EF21D34188"/>
accounted the best Men, that lived up to what was made known unto them, and I delighted to hear them, and be in Company with them that talked of good Things, and discoursed of Scripture, and of God and Christ, and of Heaven's Glory, Oh! how delight∣som was it unto me; but still I was unsatisfied, because I found I was not a Living Witness of these States and Conditions that the People of God were in, in former Days; and how to attain unto it, I did not know. Then did I mourn unto my self, and say in my Heart, Oh that I had been born in the Days when the Lord spake unto <HI>Moses,</HI> and unto the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and with a high and wonder∣ful Power brought forth his People out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and thro' the Red Sea, that I might have known how to have walked in the right Way, and to have done what the Lord would have required of me, and been in Acquaintance and Familiarity with my Maker; that I might have known when I had pleased or displeased the
<PB N="5" REF="002815_0022_0FE643508A2F5490"/>
Lord, whom my Soul loved, but knew not how to come acquainted with him. Oh! what would I have part∣ted with for the Enjoyment of the Lord, and Assurance of Salvation? Surely if it were possible for me to have enjoyed all the World, I could freely have parted with it, for Peace, Comfort and Satisfaction for my poor distressed Soul, that mourned as with∣out Hope; and many a time, and many Hours have I been alone, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead∣ing and mourning, when no Eye saw me, nor Ear heard me, neither could I find comfort in Reading, because it was a Book sealed unto me. Then did I mourn, and say, Oh! that I had been born in the Days when our bles∣sed Saviour Jesus Christ was upon the Earth; how would I have follow∣ed him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate at his Feet, as <HI>Mary</HI> did; how freely could I have left my Father's House, and all my Relations, for true Peace and Assurance of Life Eternal for my Immortal Soul.</P>
<P>And under this exercise I grew very sad, insomuch that my Mother feared
<PB N="6" REF="002815_0023_0FE642F62D6DAB50"/>
I was going into a Consumption, and greatly fear'd my Death; and would say to me, <HI>Canst thou take Delight in nothing? I would have thee walk forth into the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elds with the young People, for Recreation, and delight thy self in something.</HI> And to please her, I have sometimes, when we were out of our Imployment, gone forth with sober young People, but I found no Com∣fort in that. Then I fell into a Cus∣tom of reading the Scriptures, and to be alone in private, reading, and cry∣ing, because I knew not that Hea∣venly Power and Spirit to have Do∣minion in me, that was in them that gave forth the Scriptures; and nothing else but the Substance would give me true Satisfaction, therefore the Scripture was but a Book sealed un∣to me.</P>
<P>Then did I fall down upon my Knees, to pray unto the Lord, with my Heart full of Sorrow, and the Tears running down my Face, and could not utter one Word; which
<PB N="7" REF="002815_0024_0FE64361645D3828"/>
seem'd very strange unto me, and set me a thinking, that there was none like unto me. But it was the Ene∣my's Work to perswade me, there was none like unto me: And because I could not pray in Words, as others could, and likewise under Afflictions, therefore the Lord had no Regard un∣to me. But the Enemy is a Lyar, as ever, for the Lord was near me in every Exercise, and broke my Heart, and melted my Spirit, or else it would not have been so with me. Oh! my Soul can now behold his Goodness, for he was near me, altho' I was not aware of it; for I thought none was so miserable as I, the Enemy endea∣vouring to cast me down to make me despair. And truly it was the great Mercy of the Lord in preserving me from it, for my Affliction was great, and my Distresses very many, and the Enemy following me with his Temp∣tations, and for Want of right Infor∣mation where my Strength was to be found; which was to have stood still, and have waited upon the living God
<PB N="8" REF="002815_0025_0FE642F630A64110"/>
for Strength to overcome my Soul'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Enemy. And instead of so doing, the Enemy so disturbed me, and so fol∣low'd me with his subtil Allurements, sometimes to draw my Mind into the Vanities of this World, and to delight my self in bedecking my self in fine Clothes, that I might appear comely in the Eyes of the World; for (said the Enemy) as for this Way of Sad∣ness and Trouble that thou art under, it will redound to no Advantage, Be∣nefit, nor Comfort; thou will not be in any Esteem amongst thy Neigh∣bours, therefore take thy Pleasure, and be at rest. A Lyar he is, and e∣ver was from the Beginning; and my dear Children, believe him not, if it be your Lots to be under Temptati∣ons or Exercise of any kind; or what Way soever the Lord may be plea∣sed to lead you in, for the Trial of your Faith and Patience in any! kind; either now, or any Time of your Pilgrimage in this Life. I say, the Enemy will befool as many as he can; therefore look unto the Lord,
<PB N="9" REF="002815_0026_0FE64361671055F0"/>
and keep him in your Remembrance, and pray unto him in the inward of your Minds. Altho' you cannot utter one Word, know it assuredly, that he is near to help his afflicted Children at all Times, as they stand in Need or him. Oh! that I had known this in the Days of my Ignorance, and in my young and tender Years, when the Lord was near me, and at Work in my Heart, and I knew it not: For Want of an Understanding, the Ene∣my befooled me, and led me aside in those Things above-named and by hearkning unto him, and the young People that was my Neighbours, in perswading me, that it would be of great Benefit to me, for I was young, and knew not what I might come to and I was left of my tender Father, and hardly any Friend was left me. And in my Distress and Afflictions, wil∣ling to have a little Rest and Comfort, I lent out an Ear to the Enemy of my Soul, and let my Mind go forth after fine Clothes; but when it was drawn out, it went without Limit; and when
<PB N="10" REF="002815_0027_0FE642FC703FA770"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bedecked my self as fine and as choice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s I could, it would hardly give me Content; for when I had one new thing, when I saw another, or the third, I was as desirous as for the for∣mer; so ever unsatisfied. Oh! the ly∣ing Enemy, who promis'd me Rest and Peace, but could not give it me; a Lyar he is, and ever was; my Soul hates him, and is at Enmity with him; the Lord preserve me out of his Snares, and my House also for ever.</P>
<P>But tho' he had drawn out my Mind, the Lord did not leave me; for I should many Times have a Concern upon my Mind what would become of me; and if at any Time I was drawn out into any Mirth or Laugh∣ter, I should feel something smite my Heart, and bring great Heaviness over my Spirit; but I knew not what it was, and I little thought it was the Lord, who was ever good and gra∣cious, kind, merciful, and slow to Anger, and not willing People should run into Destruction, nor perish.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002815_0028_0FE64364451D0D30"/>
I little thought he looked so nar∣rowly to my Ways; but since the Lord hath been pleased to open my Eyes, I can look back and admire his Goodness, and blessed be his worthy Name, and the right Arm of his Strength, who hath early been my Guide, and kept me in great Part from running into the Evil of the World, which greatly attends young People. But blessed be the Name of the Lord, he took me by the Hand, and led me when I knew not of it, in the Days of my tender Years; and if I had not hearkened unto the Enemy, my Con∣dition had been well. But as soon as he had drawn my Mind into Pride, and to take Delight in fine Clothes, it soon became my Burden; for in a little Time after, the Lord in the Riches of his Love, was pleased to fit and furnish his Faithful Servants, and painful Labourers, whose Industrious∣ness the Lord greatly prospered, two Men of worthy Memory, dear <HI>John Audland,</HI> and <HI>John Camm,</HI> in 1654. But when I heard the Report of them,
<PB N="12" REF="002815_0029_0FE642FC74618BC0"/>
it struck a Dread over my Heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ear∣ing of their Plainness. I began to think, how shall I demean my self to go to hear them. In a little Time af∣ter, there was a Meeting appointed by them; where my Lot was to be, and dear <HI>John Audland</HI> was declaring; but assoon as I heard his Voice, it pierced me; and when I came into the Meeting, and heard his Testimony, and beheld his solid Countenance, Oh! how my Heart was troubled within me, insomuch that I knew not what would become of me.</P>
<P>After Meeting was over, I separa∣ted my self from my Company, and travelled alone two Miles, because no Ear should hear me making my Moan unto the Lord; and out of the Bit∣terness of my Spirit did I say, <HI>Lord, what shall I do to be saved? I would do any thing for Assurance of everlasting Life; and if the Lord will be pleased to accept of me upon any Terms, I mat∣ter not what become of this outward Body, if I could find out a Cave of the Earth that I might get into, where I
<PB N="13" REF="002815_0030_0FE6436448703F70"/>
might mourn out my Days in Sorrow, and see Man no more.</HI></P>
<P>I thought I could have been con∣tented; but it pleased the Lord to o∣pen the Eyes of my Understanding, and to lead me by a Way that I knew not, and to begin the first Day's Work in my Heart, <HI>which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as the Spirit of the Lord to move upon the Waters, and to divide the Light from the Darkness;</HI> and when the Separation was made, then could I see my Way in the Light, <HI>which was the Light unto</HI> David's <HI>Feet, and was a Lanthorn unto his Paths;</HI> and it will order every one's Goings aright, if they take Heed unto it.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to go thro' every particular State; but my ear∣nest Cries were unto the Lord, to lead me the right Way, and <HI>to create in me a new Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me.</HI> Oh! let me be unto thee, O Lord, what I am, and not unto Man; and I do not take Care for this outward Body, do but redeem my Soul from Death, and out of this hor∣rible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, wherein I am held as in
<PB N="14" REF="002815_0031_0FE643077A84D9A8"/>
Chains of Darkness, and shall perish for ever, if thou dost not, out of thy Infinite Mercy, have Compassion on me, and bow thy Ears to my Cries, for I can do nothing else; for I can truly say, <HI>My Heart was filled with Sorrow, my Sighing came before I eat, and Tears were as my sorrowful Meat; when I lay down, it was in Sorrow, and watered my Pillow with my Tears, before I could take my Rest; and when I awaked, it was with the Dread of the Lord over my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! my Soul can do no less than magnifie the Living God, who is worthy of Praise, Honour and Re∣nown, Thanksgiving and Obedience for evermore. And why so? because he hath condescended unto the low∣est Estate of his Hand-maid, and bow∣ed his Ear unto my Prayers, and had a Regard unto my Cries, and hath answered my Request, and given me my Heart's Desire, which was to be led the right Way. And <HI>Sion'</HI>s poor Travellers know very well this is a Beginning or a Step in the Way; for
<PB N="15" REF="002815_0032_0FE6436FCBE8EB70"/>
I can truly say, that I never coveted Heaven's Glory, nor to be made a Partaker of the Riches, Glory, and everlasting Well-being for ever, more than I desired to walk in the Way that leads thereunto. And I did as truly believe that the Lord would re∣deem a People out of the World, and its Ways, and Customs, Language, Marriage and Burying, and all the World's Hypocrisy; I looked for this Change, before I saw any Appearance of it; but all my Fear was, I should not live to see it; the Enemy always following of me with his Temptati∣ons, to work me into Unbelief, and to cast me down into Desparation. Oh my Soul cannot but give the Lord God the Glory, the Honour and the Renown, for he is worthy of it for ever, and evermore.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Children, this is for you to remember, and keep by you, that ye may always know the Way to Heaven's Glory, and to en∣joy true Peace and Satisfaction: It is a strait and narrow Way; whoever
<PB N="16" REF="002815_0033_0FE64307820C1028"/>
thinks it is not, they are mistaken▪ Therefore, my dear Children, keep unto the daily Cross all the Days of your Lives; and to Truth's Language. And more especially, <HI>keep your Heart with all Diligence; for out of it are the Issues of Life;</HI> then will you be brought nearer and nearer unto the Lord, and grow into Acquaintance with him; which was That my Soul mourned for in the Days of my ten∣der Years; which I cannot forget, nor I hope ever shall; for I find the good Effects of it from Day, unto Day, it bows my Spirit, and humbles my Heart, and keeps me in a living Re∣membrance of what the Lord has done for me; tho' the Lord hath been pleas'd to give me the Waters of a bitter Cup to drink, and to feed me with Bread of Affliction, and suffer Temptation upon Temptation to come near me; and the Enemy, the subtil Serpent, the old Dragon, who was more subtil than all the Beasts of the Field, following me with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes, to perswade me, that the Lord had no
<PB N="17" REF="002815_0034_0FE6436FE140BDB8"/>
Regard to me; if he had, he would not take Delight to afflict me; <HI>for there is none like thee,</HI> said the wicked one, <HI>thou ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> look abroad, and see where thou canst find one whose sorrow is like unto thine.</HI></P>
<P>Then would I wander alone in some remote Place, where no Eye could see me, nor Ear hear me, to make my moan unto the Lord, who hath sweet∣ly comforted me, and refreshed my Spirit many a time, and hath kept my Head above the Waters, blessed be the worthy Name of the Lord my God, and the right Arm of his strength, that hath wrought wonderfully for my De∣liverance; and cursed is the old Dra∣gon, who ever envied Man's Prospe∣rity, and to destroy the blessed work of the Lord, as much as in him li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th. For after the Lord had done much for me, and in a good measure had re∣deemed my Soul from Death, and by a high Hand and stre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed out Arm, had brought me out of <HI>Egypt'</HI>s Dark∣ness, and through the Red-Sea, where my Soul had true cause to Sing Praises
<PB N="18" REF="002815_0035_0FE6430BF0BF2428"/>
unto the most High God, who lives for ever, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or evermore. Oh! let me never forget so great and wonder∣ful Deliverance, but for ever keep in that, that will bow my Heart from Day unto Day, and humble my Spirit before the Lord, who hath been plea∣sed to do more for me than my Tongue is able to declare. And altho' I can say, mine Eyes have seen Afflictions, and no Affliction seems joyous, but grievous for the present, yet after∣wards it brings forth the peaceable Fruits of Righteousness.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Children, my very Aim and End is to make you a little acquainted with the work of the Lord in my Heart, and also with the subtle Devices and Contrivances of the Enemy of your Immortal Souls; his way is to set his Baits according unto People's Nature, for therein he is most likely to prevail. And because I was of a sad Heart, and very subject to be cast down; therefore did he with all his might endeavour to cast me down into Despair, and Unbelief; perswad∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="002815_0036_0FE6437569DD1A20"/>
of me I should never hold out un∣to the End. Then should I mourn to the Lord, to preserve me to the End, for my Affliction was very great, both inward and outward, and many things he cast before me, that seem'd too hard for me to go thro'; when my Mind was filled with Sorrow, the Enemy got Ground upon me, and fil∣led my Heart with Thoughts and Im∣aginations, until my Heart grew hard before I was aware of it, and I had lost that sweet Enjoyment and Heaven∣ly Fellowship that I was comforted with in the Night Season, and in the Morning Light. I had great Cause to Magnifie the worthy Name of the Lord, who was pleased to comfort my afflicted Soul; but when the Ene∣my had gotten a little Ground upon me, he set his Baits so agreeable unto my Nature, which was apt to be cast down. And when I had any thing struggling in me in remembrance of my State and Condition I was in a lit∣tle before, and now for a little time I had lost it; I had great cause to mourn
<PB N="20" REF="002815_0037_0FE6430C191A48E8"/>
unto the Lord, who was able to deli∣ver me, as he had done many a time, blessed be his Holy Name, and the Right Arm of his Strength, that lives for ever. Yet tho' he was able to do it, yet the Enemy prevail'd upon me a little further: For when I was in my mournful Estate, making my Moan unto the Lord, saying in my Heart, <HI>There's no Sorrow like mine; and why none like thine? Because I had lost my Be∣loved, and my Loss was great; he that had redeemed my Soul from Death, and had done well for me.</HI> Oh! I could do no le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s but mourn for him. And in this time of mourning, which was a State very suitable unto my Condition, had I been wary o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that subtil Serpent, who was too hardfor me, in perswad∣ing me I was discontented, a Murmu∣rer, and a Complainer, and I made the Lord weary with my crying, and should be shut out of his Kingdom, for 'twas the Murmurers and Complain∣ers that perished in the Wilderness.</P>
<P>Oh! how soon was I caught by his Subtilty; for he infused in me, and per∣suaded
<PB N="21" REF="002815_0038_0FE6437575C7AB70"/>
me it was in vain to strive any longer, for I should never Inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. But a Lyar he was, and ever will be, my Soul is at Enmity with him; the Lord whom I trust, preserve me, and my House for ever, as it pleased my Heavenly Fa∣ther (who had a regard unto me) to make way for me to escape. For in a little time after, it was my lot to be at a Meeting, where a Faithful Servant of the Lord was, by Name <HI>William Dewsbery,</HI> whose Testimony was most∣ly unto the distressed and afflicted, tos∣sed with Tempest, and not comforted;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1655.</NOTE> which State many were in, in that Day. A true Messenger he was unto many. I was 21 Years of Age when I was in this Condition; but after Meeting was ended, I dreaded to go unto him, for I thought that he was one of a great discerning, and he would be sensible the Hardness of my Heart; and if he should Judge me, I should not be able to bear it; but yet I could not go a∣way in Peace, until I had been with
<PB N="22" REF="002815_0039_0FE6431A980CF798"/>
him: Who seeing me coming so hea∣vily on, held up his Hand; and with a raised Voice, said unto me, <HI>Dear Lamb, Judge all thoughts and believe, for Bles∣sed are they that believe and see not.</HI> And with a raised Voice, again said, <HI>They were Blessed that saw and Believed, but more Blessed are they that Believed and saw not.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! he was one that had good Tidings for me in that Day, and great Power was with his Testimony at that very Time; for the Hardness was taken away, and my Heart was open∣ed by that Ancient Power that opened the Heart of <HI>Lydia;</HI> everlasting Praises be given unto him that sits upon the Throne for ever, who hath preserved me out of the Snares and subtil Con∣trivances of the Adversary.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Children, you have been brought up in the way of Truth; it is made known unto you; and my Soul cannot but Bless and Praise the Lord my God, who hath preserved me out of the Evil of the World; therefore trust in his Name,
<PB N="23" REF="002815_0040_0FE6437B8E9E33E8"/>
and believe, he will keep you unto the End; which he will assuredly do if you depart not from him; which I hope you will not whilst you have a Day to live; and my Prayers are both Night and Day for you.</P>
<P>I can truly say, that when any of our Family have gone out of our Ha∣bitation (tho' upon outward Occasi∣ons) my Prayers have ascended unto the Lord for their Preservation; and unto this Day the Lord hath heard, blessed be his Name that lives for e∣ver. For you may well remember the many Dangers you have been pre∣serv'd out of, that have been likely to hazard your Lives, but the Lord of his infinite Goodness hath hitherto preserv'd you all, that you may serve him. Therefore, dear Children, for∣get not your Duty unto the Lord, and the Counsel that Jesus Christ gave unto his Disciples, which was, to <HI>watch and pray,</HI> that you may be pre∣served out of all Dangers both in∣ward and outward, which you may be liable to fall into, if you do not

Then will my Heaven∣ly Father do for you as he hath done for me, in the Days of my tender Years; he took me by the Hand, and led me by a Way I knew not, and made Darkness Light before me; and hath preserved me unto this very Day in Covenant with himself; everlast∣ing Praises and Honour be given un∣to his holy Name for ever, faith my Soul.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Children, you may remember since you have had an Un∣derstanding, the many Straits and Dif∣ficulties the Lord hath enabled me to go thro' for these many Years, tho▪
<PB N="25" REF="002815_0042_0FE6437B926507B8"/>
but weak, and greatly afflicted with S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>exness, and very near the Grave many a Time, and the Lord renewed my Strength again, to bear many a faithful <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> for the Lord, and his blessed Truth; many various <HI>Straits</HI> and Hardships hath the Lord my Re∣deemer brought me thro'; which, when I look back and consider, I am filled with Admiration, in Considera∣tion how my Soul hath escaped to this very Day. But this Saving of Christ Jesus often comes before me, <HI>That greater is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that is in you, than he that is in the World;</HI> and said to his Disciples, <HI>Be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ Cheer, I have overcome the World.</HI> This hath been a Comfort to me many a Time, and I often remember a Saying of a faith∣ful Servant and Minister of Jesus Christ, whose Name was <HI>Miles Halhead,</HI> when I was 21 Years of Age, and under great Exercise, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> looking upon me, said, <HI>Dear Child, if thou continue in Truth, thou wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t make an Honourable Wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n for the Lord; for the Lord God will honour thee with his

blessed Testimony.</HI> And ten Years af∣ter, in 1665. he came to my Habita∣tion, and said unto me, <HI>My Love and Life is with thee, and that for that blessed Work's Sake that is at Work in thee; the Lord God keep thee Faithful, for he will require hard Things of thee, that thou art not aware of; the Lord give thee Strength to perform it, and keep thee faithful to his blessed Testimo∣ny; my Prayers shall be for thee, as of∣ten as I remember thee.</HI> And soon af∣ter that, a great Exercise fell upon us; we were exposed to great Suffering, and the Lord had opened my Mouth in a Testimony but a little before; yet have been concerned, for Fear my Friends should suffer for me; not for my self, for I could truly say, <HI>My Heart was given up to serve the Lord, come what would come.</HI> But this was the least of our Sorrow; Loss of Goods, Beating and Hurling to and fro, and dragging out of our Meeting-House, and many other Abuses, which the Lord made us able to go thto', and sanctified unto us; and my Soul bles∣seth
<PB N="27" REF="002815_0044_0FE64381BAD8FCB8"/>
the Lord, for that he accounted us worthy to suffer for his Name's Sake.</P>
<P>For in the Time of Suffering did a selfish separating Spirit begin to break forth amongst us; which added to our Affliction and Sorrow, more than all our Persecutors could do; tho' we went in great Hazard of our Lives to our Meetings, the <HI>Informers</HI> were so wicked and inhumane, and filled with Envy and Madness, that they swore, <HI>It was no more Sin to kill us, than it was to kill a Louse;</HI> and that <HI>they would bathe their Swords in our Blood.</HI> But blessed be the Lord our God that liveth for ever, we were in no wise affrighted at these Things, nor con∣cerned at it, for we knew him in whom we had believed, was able to deliver his chosen ones that put their Trust in him.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Children, some of these Things you know, your Eyes have seen this when you were young and tender in the Beginning of your Days; and tho' but young and ten∣der,
<PB N="28" REF="002815_0045_0FE6431D5A408CF0"/>
yet the Lord kept you from the Fear of Men. And in this Time of great Exercise, there fell upon me a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another greater Exercise and Travail of Spirit, which seemed so strange and so wonderful, that I could not believe that ever the Lord would require such a Service of me that was so weak and contemptible, so unfit and unlike∣ly, my Understanding but shallow, and my Capacity but mean, and ve∣ry low and dejected in my own E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; and looking so much at my Insuffici∣ency, made me to strive so much a∣gainst it; crying oftentimes within my self, <HI>Surely this is something to en∣snare me, for the Lord does not require such Things of me; seeing there are so many wise and good Men that are more honourable, and fitter for such Service than I.

I cry unto the Lord again, and again; <HI>Lord, if thou hast found me worthy, make m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Way plain before me, and I will follow thee; for Lord, thou knowest that I would not willingly offend thee. But for Fear thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> require me to go to the Great Men of the Earth.</HI> I knowing my self to be of such a weak Capacity, I did not think that the Lord would make Choice of such a contemptible Instrument as I, to leave my Habitation, and tender Chil∣dren, that were young and tender, to go to King <HI>Charles,</HI> which was an Hundred Miles from my Habitation, and with such a plain Testimony as the Lord did require of me; which made me go bowed down many Months under the Exercise of it; and oftentimes strove against it; but I could get no Rest, but in giving up to obey the Lord in all things that he required of me; and tho' it seem∣ed hard and strange unto me, yet the Lord made hard Things easie accord∣ing to his Promise unto me, when I was going from my tender Children,
<PB N="30" REF="002815_0047_0FE6432A9E12AB60"/>
and knew not but that my Life might have been required for my Testimo∣ny, it was so plain; and when I look∣ed upon my Children, my Bowels yerned towards them. The Word that ran thro' me, was, <HI>If thou canst believe, thou shalt see all Things ac∣complished, and thou shalt return in Peace, and thy Reward shall be with thee.</HI> And for ever blessed be the Name and Power of the Lord, that sustained me in my Journey, and gave me Strength to do his Will, and afforded me his living Presence to accompany me, which is the great∣est Comfort that ever can be enjoyed; and this was my Testimony to King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId, in the 11th Month, of the Year, 1670.</P>
<P><HI>This is unto thee, O King, hear what the Lord hath committed unto my Charge concerning thee. As thou hast been the Cause of making many desolate, so will the Lord lay thee desolate; and as many as have been the Cause of the persecu∣ting, and the shedding of the Blood of my dear Children, in the Day when I
<PB N="31" REF="002815_0048_0FE6438D28DB4A20"/>
call all to an account, I will plead with them, saith the Lord, therefore hear and fear the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, for of his righteous Judgments all shall be made Partakers; from the King that sit∣teth upon the Throne, to the Beggar up∣on the Dunghil.</HI></P>
<P>This Testimony I delivered into his Hands, with these words in my mouth, <HI>Hear O King, and fear the Lord God of Heaven and Earth.</HI> And I can truly say, that the Dread of the Most High God was upon me, that made me to tremble, and great Agony was over my Spirit; insomuch that Paleness came in his Face, and with a Mournful Voice he said, <HI>I thank you good Woman.</HI> My Soul honoureth and magnified the Name and Power of the Lord my God, for keeping me faithful to his blessed Testimony, and giving me Strength to do his Will, and made good his Pro∣mise, which was, <HI>If I could believe, I should return in Peace, and my Reward should be with me.</HI> So the Lord blessed my going forth, and his Presence was with me in my Journey,
<PB N="32" REF="002815_0049_0FE6438DC6FFD308"/>
and preserved my Family well, and my coming Home was with Joy and Peace in my Bosom; everlasting Praises, Glory and Honour be given unto him that sits on the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever, and for evermore.</P>
<P>And now, my dear Children, this is for you to remember the Goodness of the Lord to his Children, that faith∣fully follow and obey him with their whole Hearts, tho' they may be attend∣ed with many Weaknesses, and are ma∣ny times crying unto the Lord, <HI>Oh my weakness! I am not able to go thro' this great Work, neither indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I worthy; there are many Honourable Wise Men that thou hast fitted for thy Service, that are fitter than I am; and there seemeth so many Mountains in my way, and so many Difficulties appear in my view; that it appeareth t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o wonderful for me to go thro'.</HI> And so it was indeed, whilst I gave way to the Reasoner, which I have done many a time, till my Sorrow hath been so great, that I have not known which way to turn for it hath dimn'd my Sight, and hurt
<PB N="33" REF="002815_0050_0FE64E900EB51748"/>
my Life, and plunged my Soul into Sor∣row, whilst I gave way to the reason∣ing Part. But it pleased the Lord to appear in a needful hour, and turned back the Enemy of my Soul's Peace, and shewed unto me that he would choose the weak and the dejected, and them that were nothing in their own Eyes, and that could do nothing, no not so much as to utter a word but what the Lord giveth into their Mouths, I mean in Testimony for the living God, that the Scripture of Truth may be fulfilled in this our Day, as fully as it was in Times past and gone, that <HI>no Flesh should glory in his Presence.</HI> Then did I freely give up to obey the Requirings of the Lord with Peace and Comfort, and received the blessed Reward in my Bosom, as I have already said; but our Exercise continued by our Persecutors. But blessed be the Name and Power of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd for his infinite Mercies; for accor∣ding to the Day, so was our Strength.</P>
<P>A little time after the Officers came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d demanded Money for the King
<PB N="34" REF="002815_0051_0FE643902A97F9F8"/>
for our Meeting together. My Hus∣band answered them, <HI>If I owed the King any, I would surely pay him; but seeing I owe him no Money, surely I will pay him none.</HI> They asked him leave to Strain his Goods, he said, <HI>If you will take my Goods, I cannot hinder you, but I will not give you leave to take them; neither will I be accessary to your taking of them.</HI> Then the Officers seeing our Innocen∣cy (for we were in our Shop at our lawful Calling, with our Hands to our Labour, and our Children with us) the Constable leaning his Head down upon his Hand, and with a hea∣vy Heart said, <HI>It is against my Consci∣ence to take their Goods from them.</HI> Then I said, John, <HI>have a care of wrong∣ing thy Conscience; for what could the Lord do more for thee than to place his good Spirit in thy Heart, to teach thee what thou shouldest do, and what thou shouldest leave undone.</HI> He said, <HI>I know not whar to do in this Matter; if pay∣ing the Money once would do, I would do it, but it will not end so; but it will be thus, whilst you keep going to Meeting;
<PB N="35" REF="002815_0052_0FE64E94220D0698"/>
for the Rulers have made such Laws, that never was the like in any Age.</HI> I said, John, <HI>When thou hast wronged thy Conscience, and brought a Burthen upon thy Spirit, it is not the Rulers can re∣move it from thee. If thou shouldest go to the Rulers, and say, I have done that which was against my Conscience to do;</HI> they may-say as the Rulers did to <HI>Ju∣das, What is that to us? see thou to that.</HI></P>
<P>But the Officer that were with him, came and pulled down our Goods; but the Power of the Lord smote them, in∣somuch that Paleness was in their Fa∣ces; and their Lips quivered, and their Hands did so shake, that they could not hold it long. Then they would force a Poor Man to take them, but he refused, until they forced him, and laid them upon his Arms and Shoul∣ders; but he looking much like a dead Man, replied, <HI>You force me to do that, which you cannot do your selves, neither can I;</HI> for he trembled very much, tho' we had not ought farther to say unto them, after they came in, but could re∣joyce that the Lord had found us wor∣thy
<PB N="36" REF="002815_0053_0FE6439032519F50"/>
to Suffer for his blessed Truth and Testimony.</P>
<P>A little time after they had a Meet∣ing to Prize the Goods they took from us, and other <HI>Friends;</HI> where there met together Seven Men called Ju∣stices, and the Officers and Sheriffs, and many more of their Confederates, a great Room full of them; and I was at Work in our Shop; and seeing the Constable carrying along some of the Goods to be Prized, it immediately came into my Heart to go after them; not knowing one word that I should have to say; which made me a little consider for what I should go; but it more and more rested with me to go; and when I came within the Door, I sate down like one that was a Fool, and had not one word to say for a time; as near as I can count the time, half or three Parts of an hour. But when I came in they were greatly dis∣quieted in their Minds, and hurried in their Business, that they said many a time, <HI>that they could do nothing whilst I was with them;</HI> the Justices calling one
<PB N="37" REF="002815_0054_0FE64E9472E2FA40"/>
another to cause me to be taken away many times; saying, <HI>We shall not do any Business this Day, but spend our time in vain, if this Woman sit here.</HI> And they many times tempted me to speak what I had to say, and be gone; but could not prevail with me. Then cal∣ling to the Man of the House to take me away, solemnly protesting never to come to his House again, if if he would not take me away. But the Man had not Power to touch me, but full of trouble, said, <HI>Sir, I cannot lay Hands on her, for she is my honest Neigh∣bour:</HI> And turning towards me, said, <HI>pray Neighbour</HI> Stirredge, <HI>if you have any thing to say, speak, that you may be gone.</HI> Then one of the Justices in great Rage and Fury Solemnly pro∣tested he would never sit with them any more, if they did not take me a∣way; oftentimes wondering at their Folly for letting of me alone. Then he opened a Back Door, and went out as tho' he would be gone but in a little time came in again, saying, <HI>What is she here yet? I wonder at your Folly.</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="002815_0055_0FE64397D26DAE90"/>
Then the Power of the Lord fell upon me, and filled my Heart with a very dreadful Warning amongst them; tel∣ling them, <HI>That it was in vain for them to be found striving against the Lord, and his People; their Work would not prosper; for the great God of Heaven and Earth would be too strong for them. Therefore I warned them to Repent, and amend their Lives before it be too late; for the Lord will smite you in a Day at unawares, and in an Hour not expected by you, therefore remember that the Lord hath afforded you a Day of Warning, before Destruction comes upon you.</HI> This, and much more ran thro' me at that time; and the Lord was pleased in a very short time to ful∣fil that Testimony on them. For in a few Weeks, as they were making mer∣ry at a Feast, Two of them died on a sudden, after Dinner, and the rest very hardly escaped, about the Year, 1674.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Children, I write not this, to rejoyce at the Fall of our Enemies; but for you to consider of
<PB N="39" REF="002815_0056_0FE64E96EE2F0368"/>
the Goodness, and Mercies, and Deal∣ing of the Lord with his People in all Ages; and to keep in Remem∣brance his loving Kindness and For∣bearance to the very wicked, that are always provoking him to pour down his Vengeance upon their Heads. Yet so great is his Mercies, that he always warneth the Wicked, and gives them Time to repent, and Space to amend their Lives, that the Lord may be clear in the Day of Account; which Day will surely come upon all that draws Breath in the Air.</P>
<P>Therefore, my dear Children, re∣member your latter End, and the Day of Account, and keep a Bridle to your Tongues; for he that knows not a Bridle to his Tongue, his Religion is vain. And keep to the daily Cross, <HI>which is the Power of God to Salva∣tion.</HI> And if you will be Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven and Crown Im∣mortal, you must take up the daily Cross, for <HI>no Cross, no Crown;</HI> for the Cross will keep your Minds in Subjection to the Living God, and be∣ing
<PB N="40" REF="002815_0057_0FE64397D5485D40"/>
in Subjection, and standing in Awe that you sin not, this will keep you near unto the Lord, in a living Acquaint∣ance with him; then he will take Delight to bless you more and more, to instruct you, and to counsel you in his Way; which is pure and holy, and will not admit of any Unholiness, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any Uncleanness.</P>
<P>Therefore, my dear Children, keep clear in your Spirits in the Sight of God, and beware of the World, and the People thereof; be not in too much Familiarity with them, nor let in their Spirit to mix with yours; that hath been the Hurt of many that have been going right on their Way, and have made a good Beginning; yet for Want of Watchfulness, and keeping to the Guide of their Youth, the Light of Christ Jesus, which is the Way to Salvation; and whoever comes in any other Way, is a Thief and a Robber. The Way you know, you have been trained up in it; and the Concern of my Spirit is, that you may keep in it, and be concern'd
<PB N="41" REF="002815_0058_0FE64E9720BE5AD0"/>
for your Children, as your Father and I have been for you; and train them up in the Way of Truth, and keep them out of the beggerly Rudi∣ments of this World, that they may grow up in Plainness, and keep to the plain Language, both you and they; which is become a very indifferent Thing amongst many of the Profes∣sors of Truth. But in the Beginning we went thro' great Exercise for that very Word, as <HI>Thee</HI> or <HI>Thou</HI> to one particular Person. And for my Part, I had a Concern upon my Spirit, be∣cause I shifted many a Time from that one Word; I would have said any Word rather than <HI>Thee</HI> or <HI>Thou,</HI> that would have answered the Matter that I was concern'd in, but still I was condemned, Guilt following of me▪ I was not clear in the Sight of God▪ my Way was hedged up with Thorns▪ I could go no further, until I had yielded Obedience unto the little Things; then I walked alone (as my Manner was, and frequently used so to do, when Things came as a Weight
<PB N="42" REF="002815_0059_0FE6439A423AF7F8"/>
or Concern upon me) where I might be private from all Concern, except my Soul's Concern. Oh! that deso∣late Place where I used to retire alone, how many Times hath my Soul met with my Beloved there, that hath sweetly comforted me, when my Soul hath been sick of Love; and full of Doubts for Fear my Beloved had left me, and forsaken me. But blessed be his Name, that liveth for ever, he still appeared in a needful Time, when my Soul was distressed for him, and then was the Time I truly prized him. And this is the Way of the Lord's dealing with his Children, that he may teach them to be humble, and train them up as Children, that they may learn Obedience in all Things to do his Will. And this is his End in chastizing of his Children, to make them fit for his Service.</P>
<P>But I little thought in that Day, the Lord would have spared me so many Years, to bear a faithful Testimony to his blessed Truth and Powerful Appearance in the Morning of the
<PB N="43" REF="002815_0060_0FE64E9F95C4B548"/>
blessed Day of the breaking forth of his glorious Light and Life unto ma∣ny thousands that sate in Darkness, whose State was miserable and distres∣sed, and many times past Hope of ever seeing a good Day, and at their Wit's End; Horror, Dread and An∣guish was in the Hearts of many. Oh! these were they that could re∣ceive and prize the blessed Proffers of God's everlasting Love and Appear∣ance, tho' it was in the Way of his Judgments. For I can truly say, that my Heart and Soul delighted in Judg∣ment, tho' one Woe was poured o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> after another; yet blessed be the Day in which the everlasting Truth was first sounded in my Ears; which was in the Nineteenth Year of my Age. O let it never be forgotten by me, is my Soul's Desire: But more blessed be the Name of the Lord our God, and the right Arm of his Power, that hath been made hare from Day to Day, and from Year to Year, for the carrying on of his blessed Work, and the Preservation of his Children unto
<PB N="44" REF="002815_0061_0FE6439A8CE41068"/>
this very Day alive in his blessed Te∣stimony.</P>
<P>But the greatest Exercise that ever I met withal, was conerning this se∣parating Spirit that is gone forth from us, that first began to appear in these Parts, in <HI>John Story,</HI> and <HI>John Wil∣kinson,</HI> about the Year, 1670. which I find a Concern upon my Spirit to leave a short Relation of my great Travail and Exercises in this Work and Service for the Lord, his blessed Truth and Testimony, that he in the Riches of his Love had made my Heart and Soul a living Partaker of, Praises be given to his Holy Name for ever.</P>
<P>In the Year 70. which was a Time of great Suffering amongst Friends, and from that Time forward, as it is well known amongst Friends and o∣thers, we went to our Meetings in the Peril of our Lives, and our Goods they took for a Prey. And in this Time of great Exercise did this divi∣ding Spirit begin to appear, and in a very crafty Manner did ensnare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="45" REF="002815_0062_0FE64E9FBA60A038"/>
Hearts of divers of the Simple. And indeed there was too too many that the Lord had reached unto in the Days of the breaking forth of his wonderful Power, whom the Lord had enriched both inward, and out∣ward, that had forgotten the Days of their Distress, and where th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord first found them out, and had caused the Offence of the Cross to cease, and had gotten into Ease and Liber∣ty. Oh! how did such fall in with them, to the Grief of the Souls of the Faithful.</P>
<P>And in that Day of great Trouble, greater was our Sorrow for the Lost of our Brethren, than for all our Per∣secutions, or Loss of Goods, or all other Abuses of what kind soever▪ for indeed, great was our Sorrow on every Hand, and my Soul was most∣ly concerned for the Lord, and his blessed Truth and Testimony. Oh! how did my Heart pant after the Lord, and my Soul travelled Night and Day before him, for Strength to stand a faithful Witness for the living
<PB N="46" REF="002815_0063_0FE643A55E416838"/>
God, whom I had made a Covenant with in the Days of my bitter Be∣wailings, when my Soul lay in Di∣stress and Horror; where the Lord first met with me, when I was be∣wailing my self in bitter Lamentation, saying in my Heart, <HI>O that I could find out a Cave in the Earth, wherein I might go and mourn out my Days in Sorrow, and see Man no more; or that the Lord would be pleased to accept of me upon any Terms; or if my Life would be accepted of for a Ransom for my Soul, I would be very willing to part with it.</HI> The Cry many a time ran thro' my Heart, <HI>O Lord, what shall I do to be saved?</HI></P>
<P>Oh! the Appearance of the Lord in that State was very precious to me, I very gladly entred into Covenant with him, to serve him for ever, if he would redeem my Soul from Death, and from under the Power of him that was too strong for me. And seeing the Lord in his Infinite Mercy was so good and gracious unto me, as to give me my Hearts Desire, how
<PB N="47" REF="002815_0064_0FE64EA1298FC928"/>
could I forget it? No, <HI>rather let my right Hand forget her Cunning, and my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, before I should forget to pay my Vows and Promises to the Lord, in the Days of my Distress.</HI></P>
<P>And now to come to the Matter concerning this Libertine Spirit.—In the aforesaid Year 70. when they be∣gan their Work, the Priest's Son of our Town was one of the <HI>Informers,</HI> and his Curate was another. The Priest's Son bought him a new Sword, and swore, he <HI>would bathe it in our Blood;</HI> and said, <HI>It was no more Sin to kill a Quaker, than it was to kill a Louse.</HI> Thus they began their dread∣ful Work, which is too tedious to run thro' the Particulars: But they first Nail'd up our Meeting-House-Doors, and set a Guard before it; and it being on a Day that the Petty-Sessions was kept in that Town of <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sham,</HI> four Miles from <HI>Bristol,</HI> there being several Justices there, they sent the Bailiff and other Officers at∣tended with a great Company of Rab∣ble,
<PB N="48" REF="002815_0065_0FE643A56196A5E8"/>
who came in great Rage with Clubs, and other Weapons, but the Lord was good and gracious unto us, and gave us Strength according to the Day, and opened my Mouth in a Testimony for the Encouragement of Friends, and in Praise to God, for counting us worthy to suffer for his Name and Truth's Sake. And after me, another Woman, to the encou∣raging of Friends; and the Power of the Lord was so livingly felt amongst us, that our Enemies fell, that they could hardly speak to ask us our Names. But at length we were Fined 20<HI>l.</HI> a∣piece, but when Meeting ended, we came away rejoycing. And indeed there was great Cause for it; for the Power of God was over all, to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> great Comfort.</P>
<P>But for all this, the Clouds gather∣ed Blackness, and Storms raised high∣er and higher, and dismal Days ap∣peared; and many set their Wits at Work, and consulted together how to meet in private, and out of the Ene∣mies Sight. And it was but a little
<PB N="49" REF="002815_0066_0FE64EA15EA415F0"/>
Time that our Meeting held toge∣ther; for one that had been a <HI>Great Preacher</HI> of our Meeting, was soon weary with standing in the Street, at our Meeting-House-Door, and was greatly offended with us, for not lea∣ving our Meeting-House, and come and meet with him in private in his Dwelling-House. And there was a little Remnant that could not con∣form to the Will of Man, but feared the Lord, and dreaded to deny him before Men.</P>
<P>Then <HI>R. W.</HI> who was <HI>John Story</HI>'s great Associate, whilst the said <HI>J. S.</HI> abode in our Parts, sends a Messenger to tell us, that <HI>If we would come and meet with him, and some others in pri∣vate, where</HI> (say they) <HI>we may sit together in Quietness and Stilness, and wait upon the Lord, and enjoy the Benefit of our Meeting; which will be better than standing here in the Street, to be hurri∣ed and thronged together, and hardly any Time of Stilness to wait upon God.</HI> A very plausible Bait the Enemy had cast in their View, and indeed too
<PB N="50" REF="002815_0067_0FE643AA26D72550"/>
many were taken in the Snare. But when I heard this Message deliver'd from the <HI>Wise Preacher</HI> afore-nam'd, Oh! the Concern that fell upon me, in Consideration of them that had been <HI>Preachers</HI> amongst us many Years, that should have been a Strength to the Weak, and Encouragers of the People; and Legs to the Lame, and Eyes to the Blind; that such Men should have no more Courage, nor Zeal, nor Love to the Lord and his blessed Truth. Oh! it became my great Grief, and I sorrowed Night and Day; Lord strengthen thy weak ones, and make the little ones as strong as <HI>David;</HI> give us Courage and Boldness to stand as faithful Wit∣nesses for thy blessed Truth. And blessed for ever be the Lord our God, he answered my Request, and accor∣ding to the Day, was our Strength renewed; blessed be that Hand that never failed us, nor any that put their Trust in him.</P>
<P>So they parted from us, and left us as it were in the open Field, to en∣counter
<PB N="51" REF="002815_0068_0FE64EA789C90140"/>
with our Enemies; who the more triumphed, and made a By-Word of them and us; and cried out, <HI>Here be the Fools, the wise Men are gone. Aye,</HI> say they, <HI>they have more Wit than to meet so near the Justices House to aggravate him, and ruine themselves; they be wise Men to save themselves, and that they have; but these are the Fools, they will ruine themselves do what we can; a poor Company of ignorant Fools, that know not their right Hand from their Left? Do you think to stand against all the Powers of the Earth? a Company of silly Fools!</HI></P>
<P>Thus they pleased themselves with such Discourses, thus to lose Ground, which was a grievous Exercise to us, to hear any of our Brethren, which should have been as Valiants in <HI>Israel,</HI> and have gone before the little ones, like valiant Champions to have born the Brunt of the Battle; that our E∣nemies might have s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> their Cou∣rage and Valour for the Lord of Hosts; that the Lord thro' his Instru∣ments
<PB N="52" REF="002815_0069_0FE643AA2ABF0228"/>
might have been glorified, and his blessed Name and Truth honour∣ed and exalted over all; who alone is worthy of all Honour and Praise for evermore.</P>
<P>But if any should say, <HI>Was this a Discouragement to you little ones?</HI> No, our Fear and Zeal towards God was increased; and I can say, to the Praise and Honour of his everlasting Name, my Cries and Supplications did as∣cend Night and Day unto the Lord, for Strength to stand in my Lot and Testimony, and that I might be made able to hold out to the End. And for ever blessed be the Lord, he strength∣ened my Weakness, and made the Weak as strong as <HI>David,</HI> and afford∣ed his living Presence amongst us, to our great Comfort. But still my Ex∣ercise increased, which drove me to a narrow Search, and a deep and pondrous Consideration what should be the Cause of my great Exercise; crying to the Lord, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Wilt thou be pleased to make known thy Will concerning me?
<PB N="53" REF="002815_0070_0FE64EA7B220F260"/>
Is there any Thing lodgeth in my Heart that offendeth thee? O purge it out I beseech thee, search my Heart, and try my Reins, for I love to be searcht and tried. Lord, wilt thou be better plea∣sed with us, to go and meet with our Friends that are gone from us? Is there Service there, that we know not of? or am I too forward, or over zealous for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Truth?</HI> To this Enquiry, the Answer so suited my enquiring Heart; <HI>Keep your Meeting Time, and Place, be valiant for my Truth upon Earth, and I will crown you with Honour.</HI> Oh! blessed be his eternal Name; no great∣er Honour does my Soul desire, than to be preserved in his Fear.</P>
<P>And another Time in great Exer∣cise it often sounded in my Heart, <HI>I will gather from far, from the East, West, North and South, and they shall come and sit down in the Kingdom, with</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>and the Children of the Kingdom shall be c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st out.</HI> Oh the Concern that fell upon me, and the Cry to the Lord, <HI>Save the Children of the Kingdom: O gather
<PB N="54" REF="002815_0071_0FE643AF8E253740"/>
from far, and bring near them that are afar off, but save the Children of the Kingdom.</HI> This Thing was my daily and hourly Exercise; many times say∣ing within my self, <HI>O Lord, save the Children of the Kingdom, or take me to thy self, whilst thy Mercy is continued unto me; let me not live to be cast out of thy Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Lord gently led me in these Things, tending towards this Service and Testimony that he was pleased to lay upon me to bear; which was the very greatest that ever I met withal. For still my Exercise increased, my inward Pains grew stronger and stronger, my Heart was troubled within me, my Eyes were as a Fountain of Tears, and I cried out, <HI>Woe is me, that ever I was born. Oh; what is the Matter that all my Bowels seem to be displaced.</HI> Then the Word ran thro' my Heart, <HI>My Indig∣nation is kindled, and my Anger is wax∣en hot against this People, and my Con∣troversy shall be with them; and the Time is coming, that they will bring

more Dishonour to my Name and Truth, than is brought by open Prophaness, and thou shalt be an Instrument to pro∣claim it in their Ears.</HI> Which made me to tremble before the Lord, cry∣ing, <HI>O Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by wilt thou require such hard Things of me? Lord, look upon my Afflictions, and lay no more upon me than I am able to bear. They will not hear me that am a contemptible Instrument. And seeing they despise the Service of Women so much, O Lord, make Use of them that are more worthy.</HI> And I oftentimes cried to the Lord to remove it from me, still crying out of my Unworthiness. <HI>Oh! how un∣fit am I for such Service.</HI> The Answer I receiv'd was, <HI>They shall be made wor∣thy that dwell low in my Fear.</HI> So we continued under our great Suffering; a poor little Remnant, as one may term it, was in the open Field, to encounter with our Enemies. But for ever magnified be the Name and Power of our God, his Presence was our Life and Strength, and according to the Day, was Strength given▪
<PB N="56" REF="002815_0073_0FE643AF90AEC080"/>
Whereof we had great Cause to say, <HI>Good is the Lord, and his Mercies en∣dure for ever.</HI> And we had Cause to praise his Name, for that he had made us worthy to suffer for his Name and Truth's Sake; and keep∣ing of us faithful to stand for our God, and confess him before Men. For I can say to his Praise, I was more encouraged in all times of Per∣secution, wherein I might bear my Testimony for the Lord, that had redeemed my Soul from Death, and raised me out of the Pit of Misery, that I rejoyced to do the Will of the Lord; for it was more to me, than all that ever my Eyes beheld, and to stand a faithful Witness for him.</P>
<P>I was constrain'd in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, to warn them of the dreadful Day of the Lord, and to call them to Repentance for their Unfaithfulness. Thus we went on in our continual Exercise, and in the Strength of the Lord, and by the As∣sistance of his Holy Power, were born up in it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="002815_0074_0FE64EA9AB8FDB00"/>
But now to come to what is most before me, that all may understand how the Enemy works in a Mystery, and under a fair Pretence to betray the precious Life, and from the Sim∣plicity of the Gospel, which is Foolishness to the Wisdom of the World.</P>
<P>In this troublesome Time, it came in my Heart to visit Friends in <HI>Wilt∣shire,</HI> where I heard much of J. S. his Goings on. He had much reflect∣ed upon several Women for bearing their Testimony against that Spirit; and I met with two good Women that had been upon the Service of Truth, and had a good Testimony. He grieved them, bidding them go Home about their Business, and wash their Dishes, and not go about to preach. And said, that <HI>Paul</HI> did ab∣solutely forbid Women to preach; and sent them crying home. And furthermore, he counse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led Friends to use Christian Prudence, and remem∣ber what is said in Scripture, <HI>If you are persecuted in one City, flee to
<PB N="58" REF="002815_0075_0FE643B2ED4DD6E0"/>
another.</HI> So he would have them to alter the Day and Time of their usu∣al Meeting. And there was a little Meeting in a Dwelling House, and he importuned them to remove it, or alter the Time; and the Woman Friend of the House was soon gained, not being so zealous for the Truth as she should have been. Her Husband being more faithful, would not be caught in that Snare. She fell at Dif∣ference with him, and said, <HI>Dost thou think God doth not reveal his Secrets to such as</HI> J. S. <HI>more than we? Yes surely, and if the Lord is pleased to save us, and what we have, and make him an Instrument, why shall not we receive his Counsel?</HI> A very subtil Bait to catch the poor ignorant People in. Oh, this was a great Grief to the sin∣cere-hearted! it caused many to know Days and Nights of Sorrow. But still this Testimony always lived in my Heart, that God's Anger was kindled against that Spirit that had turned their Backs on Truth's Testimony; and was not only fallen
<PB N="59" REF="002815_0076_0FE64EB163270DD0"/>
into that Snare themselves, but en∣deavoured to ensnare many more. The Concern of it began to come over me, insomuch that I dreaded to go to a Meeting, for Fear that Testi∣mony would be required of me; but the Time was not yet come.</P>
<P>But there came a faithful Servant of the Lord to our Meeting, whose Name was <HI>Miles Halhead,</HI> who was wonderfully endowed with the Pow∣er of the Lord, and great Discerning; he came to see me, and said, <HI>My Love runs unto thee, and that for the Work's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for God will re∣quire hard Things of thee; thou little thinkest what is at Work in thy Heart; the Lord God of my Life keep thee faith∣ful; my Prayers shall be for thee, as of∣ten as I have thee in Remembrance; thou art as my own Life, and sealed in my Bosom, I cannot forget thee.

But O the Goodness of
<PB N="60" REF="002815_0077_0FE643B2F0604ED0"/>
the Lord, with that Salutation over∣flowed my whole Heart, and melted my Bowels into Tenderness, and my Eyes as a Fountain of Tears, saying within my self. <HI>What am I but a poor helpless Creature, and am not worthy of the least of these great Favours and Mercies that the dear Servant of the Lord is speaking of: And surely, if the Lord be with me, why is it thus with me? I am under great Exercises daily, and Straits many.</HI> Sometimes it seemed to me, as if the Lord had withdrawn him∣self from me, which caused great Sor∣row of Heart. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> little I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> af∣ter our Lots being cast at <HI>Bristol,</HI> where <HI>John Story</HI> was most of his Time; the Heighth of Persecution being a little over, then he could preach one Hour after another, whilst one Word would hang to another, to the Hin∣drance of several travelling Souls, that have been in Travail, and pained at the very Heart, for a little Time to ease their Spirits, and discharge their Duty, that all might have been com∣forted together. But in the room of
<PB N="61" REF="002815_0078_0FE642BFCCE44B00"/>
that, a Cloud of Darkness hath come over, which hath made many to groan under it. But Oh! the dread∣ful Agony which I have been in to come forth with that Testimony that had lived with me, that I had been so long confirmed in. Many Nights and Days, and Weeks, and Months, have I gone on in Sorrow and Pain, and have eaten no pleasant Bread. And many a time have I lain down in Sorrow, and watered my Pillow with my Tears, crying out, <HI>O Lord what will become of me, and what shall I do?</HI> And the Lord said, <HI>A Testimo∣ny I do require of thee.</HI> Then I said, <HI>O Lord, if thou wilt open my Heart to declare of thy Goodness, and what thou hast done for thy People, and to tell of thy Noble Acts, and thy manifold Mer∣cies, how ready should I be to do it; but these are hard Things, who can bear them?</HI></P>
<P>Thus I did reason with the Lord, till my Burthen became too heavy for me to bear. And when I have gone forth in my Lawful Concerns,
<PB N="62" REF="002815_0079_0FE643BF18893448"/>
and have seen any of them, Pains did take hold of me, and Distress of Mind, and Anguish of Spirit did seize upon me; insomuch that I sought out private Places to mourn in; say∣ing, <HI>What shall I do? Send me to a Nation of a strange Language, whose Face I never knew, and make Use of a better Instrument for this great Work; they will not hear me, who am a con∣temptible Instrument, neither do I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w whether any of them will receive my Testimony.</HI></P>
<P>For there was not one that knew for what I went thro' such great Ex∣ercises; for many Friends have said, That I had something that lay weigh∣tily upon me; insomuch that I could hardly go on my Feet; and they wondred that I did not give up unto it, and said that I hurt my self, and the Meeting too.</P>
<P>Oh! I cannot but greatly admire the infinite Mercies and Loving Kind∣ness of the Lord, and his long For∣bearance with me, in that he did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut me off in my Disobedience to him,
<PB N="63" REF="002815_0080_0FE64EB319013EC0"/>
when I knew what he required of me, as well as I knew my right Hand from my Left, and would not obey him. But still I reasoned, and cried out, <HI>What shall I do?</HI> And I thought that if any one had born a Testimo∣ny in publick before me, I could the better have born it; but I to be one of the first, such a contemptible one as I, I thought I could not do it. But what Mercy did not do, Judgment did; for the Lord was pleased to lay his Hand heavy upon me, and with his Correcting Rod chastized me; and I did feel more of the Displeasure of the Lord for my Backwardness to his Requirings, than ever I did for my former Transgression. For I may say, as true as ever <HI>Jonah</HI> was plun∣ged into the Deep, and his Head wrapped about with Weeds, so was my Soul plunged into a Gulph of Mi∣sery; insomuch that all Hope of ever finding Favour with God again, was hid from me, and I left in Sorrow to lament, as one without Hope.</P>
<P>Oh! how did my Heart lament,
<PB N="64" REF="002815_0081_0FE643BF1B9CAA20"/>
and my Soul languish Night and Day; and I said, <HI>O that the Lord would be pleased to shew Mercy once more, and to raise up my Life again, and redeem my Soul out of this horrible Pit wherein I am held as with Chains, and bring me to my former State again, and require what thou pleasest, and I will obey thy Voice, tho' I should be hated of all Men upon the Face of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>And before I could take any Rest, I made a deep Engagement unto the Lord, to do whatsoever he required of me, if he would give me Strength, and be with me. So when First Day Morning came, I had a great Con∣cern upon me; and when I sate down to wait upon the Lord, the Power of the Lord seized on me, which made me to tremble; insomuch that my Bones were shaken, and my Teeth chattered, and I was in a great Ago∣ny; and standing up, with a dread∣ful Testimony, and proclaiming God's Controversy with the Exalted and High amongst the Professors of Truth, and such as had departed from the
<PB N="65" REF="002815_0082_0FE64EB351912970"/>
Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, with such God's Anger was waxen hot, and his Indignation burned, and I warned them to repent while they had a Day, and more to that Effect, but as short as I could. Then a Friend stood up with a great Concern upon him, saying, <HI>A living Testimony is the God of Heaven and Earth raising up amongst the poor and contemptible ones, that shall stand over your Heads for ever∣more.</HI> So he went on in great Pow∣er and Authority, and the Power of the Lord was greatly manifested a∣mongst us that Day. O Glory be to his Everlasting Name for evermore, saith my Soul, for his blessed Appea∣rance to us that Day, and all other of his Mercies at all Times, who re∣turned me an hundred-fold in my Bo∣som, after all my unworthy consul∣ting against the Motions of the Spi∣rit of so merciful and compassionate a Father, who after he had corrected me, receiv'd me into Favour again: O Glory to him for evermore. For when I had cleared my Conscience,
<PB N="66" REF="002815_0083_0FE64E7CDDADDEB0"/>
O the Peace and Comfort and Conso∣lation that I received from the Lord, was more to me than all the World, or the Friendship of it.</P>
<P>So some time after, <HI>John Story</HI> and Three of his Party came to my House to rebuke me, and was very high, and spoke great swelling Words, think∣ing thereby to discourage me. <HI>John Story</HI> asked me, <HI>What I had to lay to his Charge, and what I had against him, I told him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I had against him, I never received from Man, nor by any Information from any one; but what I have against thee, is from the Evi∣dence of God in my own Conscience. The Evidence of God in thy Conscience</HI> (said he in a deriding Manner) <HI>that is not sufficient for thee.</HI> I said, <HI>It was suf∣ficient for me; by what else should I try Spirits with, but by the Evidence of God in my own Conscience.</HI> So he said again, <HI>That was not sufficient for me.</HI> My Husband said, <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, to what wilt thou bring us now? Hast not thou and all other Friends directed us to God's Witness in our own Conscience, and
<PB N="67" REF="002815_0084_0FE64EBA5A538468"/>
now thou say'st it is not sufficient.</HI> And he said again <HI>It is not sufficient, un∣less thou couldest bring Witness that I had done some Evil Action, and what could I accuse him of; or else what sig∣nifies it to have ought against him?</HI></P>
<P>I could have laid enough to his Charge, of his Manner of going on in Time of Persecution; but being willing to be short with him, I said <HI>I have this to say to thee, that thy Ways and Manner in publick Meetings, is much d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffering from the Apostle, who said,</HI> If any thing be revealed to him that sitteth by, the first is to be silent: <HI>And thou wilt take up the whole Time of the Meeting, altho' there hath been many that have been concerned before thy Face, and that greatly; so what thou doest, is not ignorantly, but wil∣fully.</HI> He answered me very angrily, and said, <HI>If I do do so, what canst thou make of that?</HI> I did say, <HI>Thou art out of the Order of the Gospel; for it is said,</HI> the Church may exercise one by one; <HI>and thou doest not as thou wouldest be done by.</HI> And further I told him, <HI>that
<PB N="68" REF="002815_0085_0FE64E83F0CA3FE8"/>
this was not his Place to abide here a Preaching, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> burthening the Souls of the Innocent; but thy P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace is to return Home into the North, and be reconci∣led to thy Brethren, before thou go to offer thy Gift.</HI> So many great Swel∣ling Words proceeded from him, and his Three Friends which were with him; and so went away sorely dis∣pleased.</P>
<P>And their Rage increased towards me, and many Faithful Friends. Ma∣ny were concerned that had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itten under their dead Ministry, but most∣ly against me, for discharging my Duty, in Obedience to what the Lord required of me, and committed to my Charge, concerning that Spi∣rit, which did for some Time endea∣vour to Lord over God's Heritage; which made many sensible ones go bowed down many a Time, my Soul is a living Witness; with many more, of what I have here declared; which is but little of their Persecution to∣wards me, in Consideration of what follows after. For the Lord was
<PB N="69" REF="002815_0086_0FE64EBA8AA8BAB0"/>
pleased to continue my Exercise in that City, where <HI>John Story</HI> abode much of his Time. And several more of that Spirit oftentimes frequented thither in that Time of Exercise with that Spirit. And the Lord was plea∣sed to make me so sensible of them, that in the Night Season I had many a sore and hard Travail upon my Spi∣rit, when I knew not of any of them by any Information from any one. Then did I make my Moan unto the Lord, crying in secret; <HI>O what shall I do to go thro' such hard Things? O that I may be excused this Day, or that thou wilt be pleased to keep me in Silence this Day; then should I be very willing to go to Meeting to wait upon thee, and to sit under the Shadow of thy Wing with great Delight, where thy Fruit will be pleasant to my Taste.</HI> Then it would come up before me▪ the Covenant that I made with the Lord in the Days of my Distress, when all the World, and the Friend, ship of it, would not yield me one Dram of Comfort to my poor distres∣sed
<PB N="70" REF="002815_0087_0FE64E841F9E3918"/>
Soul. Then did I promise the Lord in that Day, which was twen∣ty Years before That, that if he would redeem my Soul from Death, and give me Assurance of Life, I would serve him all my Days, if he would give me Strength, and be with me; for I mattered not what I went thro' for his Name's Sake. And it would often come up before me, that they that followed the Lord, and loved him most, did whatsoever he com∣manded them. Oh! I cannot but ad∣mire the long Forbearance and Lo∣ving Kindness of the Lord, that he had not cut me off in my Gainsaying, and Unfaithfulness; for I never want∣ed the Assistance of his Holy Spirit, in giving up to his Requirings, bles∣sed by the Holy Name of our Lord God, and the right Arm of his Strength for evermore, who alone hath been our Keeper and Preserver to this very Day, Glory be to his Great Name for evermore.</P>
<P>Now I shall give a little Account of one Meeting in <HI>Bristol,</HI> which was
<PB N="71" REF="002815_0088_0FE64EBC427889B0"/>
one of the greatest Exercises that ever I met with, or ever went thro' since I had a Remembrance. When I was going to the Meeting, I had a great Exercise upon my Spirit, and knew not for what; but after some Time of waiting upon the Lord, I saw my Service, for <HI>J. Story</HI> was there, who came into <HI>Bristol</HI> the Night before; and several Friends had warned him <HI>not to come and offer his Gift, till he was reconciled unto his Brethren;</HI> for if he did, they did believe that the Lord would concern one or another to bear Testimony openly against him, But I knew not of it till afterward; for if I had, I believe my Service would not have been so hard and strange unto me. But whilst he was a declaring a great Cloud came over the Meeting, and I was greatly ex∣ercised in my Spirit; insomuch that the Lord constrained me to cry, <HI>Woe to that Spirit that dimned the Glory of the Lord, and woe to that Pot that the Scum remains in it, for in it is the Broth of abominable Things, such as the
<PB N="72" REF="002815_0089_0FE64E865C8909D8"/>
Lord's Soul lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th, and the Souls of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> Oh how it ran thro' me again and again, and I was pres∣sed in my Spirit to declare it, whilst he was a speaking: But I was sen∣sible what a Disturbance it would be in the Meeting. I would fain have for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn till he had done, but I durst not; for I was afraid to speak, and afraid to keep silent. For if I had been silent, I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that I should have withstood the Spirit of the Lord in my own Conscience. But I strove against it, by Reasoning, and saying, <HI>O that the Lord would be pleased to excuse me this Day, and that I might not lose his Favour, then I should have accounted my self happy.</HI> But all this Reasoning would not do that Service that God had for me to do that Day. But when I found no way to pass it by, I stood up to clear my Consci∣ence and discharge my Duty in the Sight of God. And when I consider'd the low Estate and weak Condition that I had been in that Day; O the Lord's Strength sustained me, for ac∣cording
<PB N="73" REF="002815_0090_0FE64EBC725AC328"/>
to the Day was Strength gi∣ven me, Glory to his everlasting Name for evermore, saith my Soul, for his blessed Reward was returned into my Bosom, and he renewed my Strength, and raised up my Life in Dominion over all their Opposition I then met with.</P>
<P>And thus, Reader, I have given this short Account of the going forth and Work of that Spirit; since which, I have seen a withering and Decay come upon it, near Twenty Years having since pass'd over my Head.</P>
<P>O the many unchristian-like Treat∣ments that have been brought forth by that Spirit; and how have some of them writ and printed against Truth and its good Order, and how have they turned their Backs in the Day of Battle, and have left their Brethren in the Hands of their Ene∣mies? O how grievous have their Actions been since the Year 70. Now let all consider whether that Testi∣mony that God raised in my Heart in that Time of my great Distress, and
<PB N="74" REF="002815_0091_0FE64E868961EAA0"/>
great Bowings down, and bitter Be∣wailings, when the Lord answered me, for what my great Exercise came upon me, was not true; for I can truly say, I went under the Exercise of their Backsliding many a time. And the Lord was pleased to exercise me, and to cause me to go thro' a Vail of Tears, and a Land of Drougth, in Order to humble me, and that I might bow to his Will, and obey him in all Things; <HI>for Obedience is better than Sacrifice, and to hearken to the Voice of the Lord, is better than the Fat of Rams.</HI> And there is no hearing of his gracious Voice, but by humbling under his mighty Power, and subjecting the Mind unto his Will; then d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th he make known his Mind and Will, and then blessed are they that hear his Word, and obey it; and blessed are they that know his Will, and do it. O blessed be his eternal Name for ever, and for evermore, saith my Soul, for all his Mercies, and Favours, and Blessings, and good Gifts, and Tokens of his
<PB N="75" REF="002815_0092_0FE64EC20F9B77D8"/>
gracious Love that he hath bestowed upon me, ever since I have had a Re∣membrance. First, in keeping me out of the Evil of the World in my young and tender Years, and preserved me from falling into many, and various and great Temptations, of which I had a great Share in the Days of my tender Years; and then for taking me by the Hand, and leading me in his Way, and also opened my Spiritual Eye, that I might see the Way that led towards his glorious Kingdom; and for his preserving of me to this very Day alive in his blessed and glo∣rious Testimony; and all these his manifold Mercies, which are all in my View at this Time. And in the Remembrance of them my Heart is truly bowed, and with hearty Thank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> giving do return unto my Heavenly Father all Glory, and Honour and Praise, and everlasting Renown be given unto my God, and our dear Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus, who is sitting upon his Throne, Judging in Righteousness, and swaying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his

<P>And now, my dear Children, it further lives in my Heart, to leave some of the Testimonies that the Lord was pleased to lay upon me in that Time of great Suffering in <HI>Bristol,</HI> and near unto it.</P>
<P>In the Year, 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. I was greatly concerned to go to the Mayor of <HI>Bristol</HI> with this Testimony, on their Sessions-Day in the Morning; waiting at his Door for his rising from his Bed, I met with him going thro' one of his Rooms, before he was fully ready, and said unto him, <HI>The God of Heaven and Earth hath constrained me this Night and Morning to come unto thee with this Testimony: therefore don't lay it by thee, as a Thing not worth thy minding, but read it and well weigh and consider what is written therein; for could I have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sight of God in not coming, I had not been here this Day.</HI></P>

O repent, re∣pent before it be too late, and break off thy Sins by true Repentance, and thy Transgression by shewing Mercy; plead the Cause of the Innocent, and let the Oppressed go free; and be not worse than them of old, who cried,</HI> Help, O Men of <HI>Israel,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But now there is a Company of rude Boys, and Rabble of the basest Sort, with the Officers, thronging in amongst us, pressing of us together without Mer∣cy, and the Officers themselves taking of us by the Arms, and throwing us along, until we can hardly recover our selves; and pulling off the Mens Hats, and throwing them from them in great Fury, and hale to Prison ma∣ny in a Day. Oh be ye ashamed, ye Rulers, and all that have a Hand in this Work. O dread and tremble be∣fore the Great and Terrible God that made you, and gave you Breath and Being; for he is able to dash you in Pieces like a Potter's Vessel, and to take away your Breath, and to lay you as dead Men before him.

consider it before it be too late, and before the Days of your Calami∣ty come upon you, and the Arrows of the Almighty slick fast in your Livers, and there will be none to help you, nor to deliver out of his Hands; for the Lord will assuredly visit this Na∣tion, and that for the Treachery and cursed Oaths, Pride and Oppression of many therein, whose Sins have reach∣ed unto Heaven. And it is the De∣termination of the great God of Hea∣ven and of Earth to send his destroy∣ing Angel amongst them, and shall thin them. Great will be your Sorrow, Pain, and Perplexity, Terror and A∣mazement, Horror and Vexation of Spirit; alas, for the Day will be great, who shall be able to stand in it, but the pure in Heart, and them that have made the Lord</HI> Jehovah <HI>their Choice, and love him above all things, as well in Times of Peace, as Times of Distress, such shall dwell with the Lord for ever.</HI></P>

that are Fathers of Children, O dis∣honour not your grey Hairs so much, as that you should be found nourish∣ing of such ungodly Actions. Oh! consider your Places and wherefore the Lord created you; it was to serve him, and not to serve Sin, nor Un∣cleanness. And wherefore did the Lord our God, who is rich in his Mercies, ordain Means or a Way where∣by Men might escape the Snare, but that he would have all to do well, and live in his Favour for ever. Oh! be you all awakened this Day, and be you rouzed up, and sleep not in Secu∣rity; for Destruction is near if you do not speedily repent. Oh consider the</HI> Sodomites <HI>of Old, how they were toiling, and nothing would satisfy them but the Servants of the Most High God, that he had sent to warn them; and instead of being warned by them, they the more provoked the Just and Holy God,</HI> who willeth not the Death of Sinners, but had rather they would return and live; <HI>and therefore hath he sent his Servants
<PB N="83" REF="002815_0100_0FE64EFEF8CD1788"/>
early and late to warn the People; that by taking warning the might es∣cape the Wrath of the most High God, that all are liable to fall into, that are adding Sin unto Sin. And tru∣ly I know nothing more likely to draw down the Vengeance of the dreadful and terrible God, than to cruelly use his Children, and to make them to groan under their Op∣pression, as</HI> Pharaoh <HI>did in his Day; until their Groans pierced the Ears of the Lord, and he said</HI> I have heard the Groanings of my People, and I am come down to deliver them. <HI>And truly our God is the same, as great in Power, and as mighty to de∣liver at this Day, as he was in that Day. And truly if you do thus go on, as you have already done, your Days will be shorten'd, and you shall not prosper. Therefore consider it in Time, I intreat you; as you tender the Good of your own Souls, and your Childrens, be not Patterns of Cruelty to succeed∣ing Generations; leave not your Names upon Record for such ungodly Actions,

a good Conscience towards God, which you may be assured to meet withal during the Time of your Pilgrimage here; Well, I have this to say, and this Testimony to bear for the living God, and his everlasting Mercies, that amongst the many Blessings; and Favours, and Deliverances, that we are made Partakers of from Year to Year, for these Seven and Thirty Years; which blessed be the Name and Power of our God, he hath made me a living Witness, and an Enjoyer of his blessed Truth: And amongst all the blessed Seasons of his Love, this was the greatest of Mercies unto me; for the God of Heaven and Earth was with us at our down-lying, and up-rising; and whilst we slept, he kept us, and when we awak'd, he was present with us; the right Hand of his Power upheld us, and his good Spirit sustained us, and made hard Things easie unto us, and bitter things sweet.

<HEAD>The Way and Manner of our going to Prison, and by whom we were per∣secuted.</HEAD>
<P>ONE <HI>Robert Cross,</HI> Priest of the Parish of <HI>Chew-magna,</HI> in the County of <HI>Somerset</HI> (whither we re∣moved some Time before, and where we then dwelt) who was a Great Persecutor Twenty Years before, but had left it for some Years, until he began afresh with us; his Rage being again renewed against Friends, for
<PB N="88" REF="002815_0105_0FE642DA2AD54560"/>
their Faithfulness to the Lord, and his blessed Truth. He was greatly of∣fended, but against me in particular was he enraged greatly; to that De∣gree, that he said, <HI>If he could but live to see me ruined, and my Husband for my Sake, he cared not if he died next Day.</HI> And that which enraged him against me, was, I being with a Neigh∣bour that lay very weak, and on her Death-Bed, there being several of the said Priest's Congregation, I had a Testimony amongst them, declaring a Day of Mortality to them, which accordingly fell out to Three or Four, in Two Weeks Time, which was taken Notice of; and the Priest be∣ing told of it, was enraged as afore∣said, and contrived and made Use of several Instruments for the carrying on of his cursed Work. He sent to the Neighbouring Justice, and threat∣ned him. That it should cost him an Hundred Pounds, if he did not put the King's Laws in Execution against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as the Justice told me himself, upon a Time when they
<PB N="89" REF="002815_0106_0FE64F081944D388"/>
took me from a Burial, and had me before them; the Manner of which, comes up before me at this Time.</P>
<P>It being my Lot to be at the Bu∣rial of a Daughter of one professing Truth, where I had a Testimony to the People, many being there of the Priest's Company, which greatly of∣fended him. The next Week after, the Father of this young Woman dy∣ing also; the Day of his Burial hap∣ning on the very Day that several Ju∣stices were met at their Petty-Sessions, near the Burying-Place of Friends, they sent a Warrant, with some Of∣ficers, into our Burying-Yard, to bring away Preacher and Hearers (if any one there was, that did take upon them to preach) there being a great Concourse of People, many coming in with the Officers, to see what they would do unto us; and a very great Company with the Corps. And no sooner were we come into the Yard▪ and the Multitude, but the Power of the Lord seized upon me, and made me to tremble, that I could hardly
<PB N="90" REF="002815_0107_0FE64ECBA2060D70"/>
stand on my Feet; but by taking hold on a Friend that was near me, I said, <HI>There is a Day coming, in the which, the God of Heaven and Earth will be too strong for the stout-hearted amongst you; therefore repent, and amend your Lives, while you have a Day, and a Time; for as the Tree falls, so it li∣eth, and as Death leaves, Judgment finds, for there is no Repentance in the Grave; therefore hasten, hasten to Re∣pentance, and Amendment of Life, for the Great God of Heaven and Earth will thin this Nation, for the Peo∣ple are too many that are sinning a∣gainst the Lord.</HI> This, and much more ran thro' me; for my Heart was opened, and my Spirit great∣ly enlarged by the mighty Pow∣er of the Lord, and drawn forth in Bowels of Love towards the People; for I saw the Tears running down many Faces, and many said, they would never be again as they had been. And the Officer standing by me with a Warrant in his Pocket, he exceedingly trembled, and could hard∣ly
<PB N="91" REF="002815_0108_0FE64F0847CD1200"/>
open the Warrant, without rend∣ing it, crying, <HI>Oh! that I had been twenty Miles from my Habitation, that I had not had a Hand in this Work this Day; pray don't you take it ill of me, for I am forced to it; you must go with me before the Justices, but I wish I had been farther off, then I had had no Hand in troubling of you, pray don't you be angry with me.</HI> I said, <HI>Don't be trou∣bled so much, I am not offended. I will go with thee.</HI></P>
<P>So when we came before them (the Justices) one of them was greatly en∣raged against me; he said, <HI>You are an old Prophetess, I know you of old;</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might well say so, for he was one of them that I bore a dreadful Testi∣mony amongst, Ten Years before.) He greatly threatned me, and said, <HI>I should go to Prison, and he would ruin my Husband; but where is be? He ca∣reth little for you, I will warrant you, else he would have come with you, and not have suffered you to be sent to Pri∣so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly your self; you are a troublesome Woman; Parson</HI> Cross <HI>complains of
<PB N="92" REF="002815_0109_0FE64ECBD8008FD0"/>
you, you scatter his Flock, and have done him more Injury than all the</HI> Qua∣kers <HI>ever did; you made an Oration at the Daughter's Grave last Week, and now at the Fathers also; you shall cer∣ly go to Prison, that shall be the least I will do unto you.</HI> Thus he went on in an outrageous Manner, and I stood before him, looking steadfastly upon him, and did not answer one Word in all this Time; but he continued, and said, <HI>You are a subtil Woman, your Tongue is at Liberty when you are with your Conventicle; but you are dumb, now you are come before us, I will send you to Prison.</HI> I said, <HI>I am not so much affright∣ed at a Prison, as thou thinkest I am; but if thou send me to Prison, and short∣en my Days, because of my Weakness, thou wilt but bring innocent Blood up∣on thy Head, and that will cry aloud for Vengeance.</HI></P>
<P>He said unto me, <HI>Why do you break the King's Laws then? and why don't you go to Church? you are running head∣long into P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ery.</HI> I deny the Pope, said I, and his Actions. <HI>Do you love
<PB N="93" REF="002815_0110_0FE64F0AD1971510"/>
the King?</HI> said he, <HI>Yes,</HI> said I, <HI>Why do you not obey his Law then,</HI> said he? <HI>I have broken no Law this Day,</HI> said I. <HI>I was at a Burial, and it is no Breach of Law to bury our Dead. Well,</HI> said he, <HI>you say you have broken no Law, will you keep the King's Law for the Time to come, and leave off holding Conventicles, and Preaching?</HI> So far as the King's Laws do not wrong my Conscience, <HI>(said I,)</HI> I will keep them, but I will not wrong my Conscience for the King, nor no Man else; and I do not know whether ever the Lord may open my Mouth again; but if he do, and unloose my Tongue to speak, I shall not keep silent. <HI>So, you can talk now, when you please; but</HI> (said he to them that sate by him) <HI>she will be dumb again by and by. I will ask her one Question that shall make her dumb again. Well, you say, you have not broken the King's Laws, you were but at a Burial; but I will warrant you held a Conventicle amongst the People at</HI> John Hall's <HI>House, be∣fore you brought him forth? What say
<PB N="94" REF="002815_0111_0FE64ECE73C36B48"/>
you to that?</HI> I did not presently an∣swer him, until he said again, <HI>Why▪ don't you answer? I knew she would be dumb.</HI> Then I answered, <HI>I am no In∣former;</HI> Judas <HI>was an Informer, when he betrayed his Master.</HI> Then he look∣ed on them that were by him, and said, <HI>I tell you these</HI> Quakers are the <HI>subtilest People that ever we have to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> withal, there is no dealing with them; one while they will not speak at all, and another while such cross An∣swers as this; I protest I will send her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Prison.</HI> Then he called the Clerk to make my <HI>Mittimus,</HI> and the Offi∣cer was called for; then he raged at him, and said. <HI>You silly Fellow, you have let all the Men go, and have brought a troublesom Woman here to trouble us; you should have brought two or three rich Men to have paid for the Conventicle. Sir, I did not know them,</HI> (said he.) <HI>No, I will make you swear you did not know them; give him the Book, make him kiss the Book.</HI> The poor Man was so scared at it, that he cried, <HI>Pray Sir, don't you do it, I can∣not
<PB N="95" REF="002815_0112_0FE64F0AF9D38338"/>
swear.</HI> Then I looked on the Ju∣stices, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and said, <HI>My Soul is grieved to see ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you oppress Mens Spirits, in forcing of them to wrong their Consci∣ences. Do you not think that the Just and Righteous God will not visit for these Things? Yes verily, a Day of Reckoning will the great God of Hea∣ven and Earth call for, and dreadful and terrible will it be to all the Work∣ers of Iniquity.</HI> Then the Vother Ju∣stice that sate by, and had forborn meddling all this Time, being a mo∣derate Man, who was not forward in persecuting his Neighbours; he seeing the other so furious, said, <HI>Come, let us come to the Matter in Hand; this Woman was at a Burial, and there are many Religions in the World, and all have their Way to bury their Dead, and we cannot hinder them. But come Officer, let us know the Truth of the Matter; was this a Conventicle, or no? If it was, there must be a Place pre∣pared for her to stand up over the Peo∣ple to preach; was it so?—No, Sir, said the Officer. What then stood she
<PB N="96" REF="002815_0113_0FE64ECE9ECBB290"/>
on? Nothing But the Earth of the Grave. And what said she? I never heard the like in all my Life, said he. She said, There was a Day coming, in which the God of Heaven and Earth would be too strong for the stout-heart∣ed amongst us; and proclaimed a Day of Mortality amongst us, and warned us to repent, and amend our Lives; sure∣ly it made my Heart to tremble.</HI> How! What a Woman make your Heart to tremble? <HI>Yes, Sir, and I had no Pow∣er to touch her, until she had said all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had in her Heart to say.</HI> How, (said the angry Justice,) You silly Fel∣low, you an Officer, and had a se∣vere Warrant in your Pocket, to bring Preacher and Hearers, and you let her say all she had to say; you are not fit to be the King's Officer; send him away to Prison. Then he that was the moderate Justice, went forth out of the Room, and sent one to me, to desire me to go forth; I not being forward to go, for that honest Confession of the poor Man, did me more Good, as I thought, than my
<PB N="97" REF="002815_0114_0FE64F10E24ACF00"/>
Release at that Time. The Justice re∣turning in again said, <HI>Pray Neighbour</HI> Stirredge <HI>go home about your Business.</HI> So I returned to my Habitation again, and had the Peace of the Lord in my Bosom; everlasting Praises be gi∣ven to the Lord our God for ever.</P>
<P>But this wicked Priest after this Burial, went from House to House, and threatned the People, <HI>That it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should cost them Five Pound a-piece for going to hear the Quakers.</HI> And some being affrighted at his Threat∣ning, asked him Forgiveness; others said, they would go again. But still he continued his Rage, for nothing would content him but our Ruin. For after he had sent the Officers to our Meeting, which dealt roughly with us, by pulling and throwing, and threatning; all which did not content him. But a little after, as he was preaching in his Pulpit, he fell down dead, whilst the Words were in his Mouth; as many of the Hea∣rers being th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and there present, de∣clared unto me, that they thought he
<PB N="98" REF="002815_0115_0FE64ED6E8725EC0"/>
would never have drawn Breath a∣gain. But after a great a do, and all Means used, that they could make Use of, he a little recovered again. But, said the People, we hope it will be a Warning to him for to leave off persecuting his Neighbours. But it was not, for he was heard to say, <HI>That if he could but live to accomplish that Work that he had began, he did not care if he died presently.</HI> So he seeing his Neighbours not forward in answering his Will to the full, he sends to <HI>Bristol</HI> for <HI>John Hellier,</HI> with more of his Confederates, who was the great Persecutor at <HI>Bristol,</HI> whom he thought did his Work to the full; for they came in with many Officers, into our Meeting at <HI>Chew-magna,</HI> Five Miles from <HI>Bristol,</HI> where we were solemnly met together to wait upon the Great God of Heaven and Earth; they rushed in amongst us, and arrest∣ed us all in the King's Name, and left a Guard upon us, and went to the Priest's House to Din<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d near two Hours; in which Time we
<PB N="99" REF="002815_0116_0FE64F1111A07F38"/>
had our solemn Meeting peaceable, wherein we enjoyed the Presence of the Lord, to our Soul's Comfort; who never failed his Children in a needful Hour, but always gave them Strength suitable to the Day. Everlasting Ho∣nour be given to his holy Name for ever.</P>
<P>So after they had fed to the full, and drank in Abundance, they brought with them Faggots of Wood from the Priests, with a Hatchet, and great, Ax, and commanded the People to aid and assist them. So they muster∣ed up their Force as they came along And the People seeing what Posture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were in, cried out, <HI>What! are you a going to do?</HI> Blow up the House, and burn the <HI>Quakers</HI> (said they) then down they threw Wood at the Meet∣ing-House Door, and cried out, <HI>Set Fire on them; blow up the House.</HI> Then the People cried out, <HI>It will burn o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Houses that are near, and you won't be so wicked to burn the People, will you?</HI> Then they came in, in a violent Manner, and laid Hands on the Chil∣dren,
<PB N="100" REF="002815_0117_0FE64ED714B358D0"/>
threatning them to burn them; bringing some of them out, they said, <HI>We will make them a Warning to all o∣thers, and make them repent that ever they were Quakers Bastards.</HI></P>
<P>Then they laid Hands on us, haling and dragging us along, beating some with a Cane, and hewing off the Legs of the Forms, and taking other Forms by the two Ends, and so threw the <HI>Friends</HI> backwards that sate thereon; often calling to our Neighbours to aid and assist them. Some of them replied, <HI>We cannot work on the Sab∣bath-Day.</HI> So they continued the Work, until they had wearied them∣selves; then bringing us all out into the Street amongst many People, I said unto them, <HI>Where is your Teach∣er?</HI> What is that to you, some repli∣ed, you shall be sure to suffer, if the rest do not. <HI>But where is your Teach∣er?</HI> I said again, <HI>let him come and see the Fruit of his Labour; this is his Flock, and this is your Sabbath-days Work; let him come and behold the Fruits of his Labour, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee if he will
<PB N="101" REF="002815_0118_0FE64F142D1B7470"/>
not be ashamed of it.</HI> Then they for∣ced us in again, and <HI>John Hellier</HI> cau∣sed his Man to make our <HI>Mittimus,</HI> and himself committed us to <HI>Ivil-Chester</HI> Goal, where we were so cru∣elly used, as is after related.</P>
<P><HI>John Hellier</HI> being the Head Man in this Work, our Headborough ask∣ed him, <HI>What he should do with us?</HI> he replied, <HI>Have them away to Pri∣son presently.</HI> The Day being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spent, and the Journey long, it be∣ing Twenty and two Miles to the County Goal, he asked <HI>J. Hellier</HI> how we should go? for there are many Women that cannot travel on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot. He answered, <HI>I will press some Carts to haul them along.</HI> I said, <HI>We are not asham'd to be Carted for the Testi∣mony of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ.—But you shall be carted,</HI> said John Hellier, <HI>as the</HI> Whom are in Bristol.</P>
<P>So they returned to their Master the Priest, and told him they had done his Work effectually, for we were all committed to Prison. He
<PB N="102" REF="002815_0119_0FE64ED98064D868"/>
put off his Hat, and thanked them, and said, <HI>It would add Years to his Life, now he should live in Peace.</HI> But take Notice how short his Days were. The Headborough on the Morrow Morning, went and told him, he must provide Horses to carry the <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> to Prison on. He answered, <HI>The Devil should have them first.</HI> He asked what he should do to get us thither? <HI>Drive them along like Hogs,</HI> said the Priest. The Officer was our Neigh∣bour, a moderate Man, and what he did, was sore against his Will; he came from the Priest's House to ours, and told us what the Priest said. So before we were carried to Prison, he, the Priest, was walking in the Stee∣ple-House-Yard, where he had a great deal of foolish Discourse with some Boys that were there at Play, too te∣dious to mention. But the last Words was, <HI>He bid one of the Boys take a Halter and hang himself:</HI> And then lie fell down dead. His Family being called, brought forth a Chair, and other Things necessary, and lifted him
<PB N="103" REF="002815_0120_0FE64F145CEE24A8"/>
therein, and used all Means they could, there being many People about him: Some crying out, <HI>Don't you di∣sturb the Old Man; but let him go quietly.</HI> Aye, said others, <HI>Let him depart in Peace, and don't you disturb him, that his Neighbours</HI> (the Qua∣kers) <HI>may abide at Home, and not go to Prison.</HI> Some of the Neighbours came into our Shop with Joy, and said, <HI>Now you may abide at Home, for Mr.</HI> Cross <HI>is fallen down dead in the Church-yard.</HI> And he was going mad before, said the Mother of one of the Boys; for, said she, <HI>He bid my Boy take a Halter and hang himself. Lord have Mercy upon me! what wick∣ed Counsel was that of a Minister,</HI> said she; <HI>we were in good Hopes that his falling down in the Pulpit would have been a Warning to him, but we see it is not; but after an Hour and halfs Time, he had so much Life, as that he called them that were about him, Rogues.</HI> So they carried him in his Chair, to his Bed, where he re∣mained some Days, and died; but ne∣ver
<PB N="104" REF="002815_0121_0FE64ED9B361FDE0"/>
sensible, as I was informed by several. But we were carried to Pri∣son before he died, where we had such Entertainment, and hard Usage, as follows.</P>
<P>Our Keeper <HI>Giles Bale,</HI> and his Wife, put us in the Common-Goal, with Three Felons, that were con∣demned to be hanged, and would not afford us Straw to lie upon, tho' we would have paid for it; they locked us up, and carried away the Key with them (they living some Distance from the Prison) thereby to prevent the Under-Keeper from shewing us any Favour: And the Head-Keeper's Wife said, <HI>There let them be like a Company of Rogues and Whores together. If I had a worse Place, I would put them therein.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note, This Keeper and his Wife son after died and their Family came to Ruine.</HI></NOTE> And truly that was a most dismal Place, where we had neither Stock nor Stone to sit upon; nor any Resting Place to lean against, but the black Stone-Wall, covered over with Soot, and the damp cold

Ground to lie upon. But before we lay down. Three of our Friends that were Prisoners in the Room adjoin∣ing to that we were in, put thro' the Grates in unto us Four Dust (or Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t) Pillows, and Two Blankets, and a little Straw, whereon we lay down, like a Flock of Sheep in a Penn, in that very cold Winter, that we never had the like since I had a Remem∣brance; where most of us took our Rest very sweetly. But when I lay down in that dismal Place, it came into my Heart a Consideration of these Things; saying in my Heart, <HI>Lord, thou knowest for what we are exposed to this Hardship, it is because we cannot betray our Testimony, nor wrong our Conscience, nor deal treach∣erously with our own Souls. And see∣ing it is so, Lord, be thou our Comfort in this needful Time; for it is thy Pre∣sence, that makes hard Things easie, and bitter Things sweet, and thou hast sweetned the Waters of a bitter Cup. O thou Physician of Value, that can strengthen both Soul and Body I Be with

us this Night, and all the Nights and Days that we have to live in this World.</HI> Then the Lord was pleased to open my Heart unto him, and to fill it with his living Mercy, and com∣fortable Presence, insomuch that it overflowed my whole Heart, that I could have sung aloud of the Good∣ness of the Lord, and of his Mercies and Blessings bestowed upon us. But I looking over my Fellow-Prisoners, and seeing them so sound asleep, I did forbear to open my Mouth; but in the Morning there came many People to the Prison-Door, to see how many of us were dead with our hard Fare; some of them was sure (as they said) that I was dead, for I look'd as if I would not live until the Morning. But then finding us all alive and well, they confess'd and said, <HI>Surely we were the People of God, if there were any.</HI> That being the first Day, we had a Meeting in the Prison, and many Friends came there, where we had a very good Meeting, and the good Presence of the Lord
<PB N="107" REF="002815_0124_0FE64F1C78291B10"/>
was with us, and filled our Hearts with Joy and Gladness; insomuch that I was constrained to praise the Name of the Lord, and magnify his Power, and to testify in the hearing of many People, that we were so far from repenting our coming there, that we had great Cause to give Glory, Honour and Praises to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth; for that he had found us worthy to suffer for his Name and Truth; for this powerful Presence was with us, and sanctified our Afflictions, and made the Prison like a Palace unto us; and we would not change our State, for all the Glo∣ry of the World, if it were prostered unto us.</P>
<P>This and much more ran thro' me, which I shall omit for Brevity-Sake: But in a Word great was the Good∣ness and Mercy of the Lord towards us, from Day to Day, that I have sometimes said, <HI>Surely the Lord is ho∣nouring his People; he is weaning of them from this World.</HI> It seemed to me, as if I had no Habitation, but
<PB N="108" REF="002815_0125_0FE64EDFC138DDC0"/>
the Prison; then was the Time for the Lord to reveal his Secrets unto his Children, that he had tried and proved in such Things; for it was Faithfulness that rendred the faithful Servant acceptable in his Master's Sight, and caused him to say, <HI>Well done thou good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful in a little, be thou Ruler over much;</HI> for I cannot be∣lieve, that him that is not true to a little, will ever be made Ruler over much. No, no, therefore keep to Truth in all Things, and to the plain Language, and teach your Children so to do, and as I have said, In that Time of great Afflictions, and Suffer∣ings, and parting of many, Wife from Husband, and Husband from Wife, and both from tender Children; then was the Lord pleased to reveal his Se∣crets unto his Children. And seeing the Goodness of the Lord from Day to Day, and being made sensible of his gathering Arm from Day to Day, a great Concern came upon me for many careless ones, that had depri∣ved
<PB N="109" REF="002815_0126_0FE64F1E0378EE68"/>
themselves of that blessed Bene∣fit that our Souls enjoyed with the Lord. Oh! in Consideration of them, and their deplorable State, my Soul hath often been poured forth before the Lord, crying, <HI>O Lord, that they may come and partake with us of thy great Mercies, as we do from Day to Day.</HI> Then it would oftentimes come up before me, the great Disho∣nour they had brought upon the Lord, and his blessed Truth, by their Un∣faithfulness, and Unbelief. Yea, great Dishonour indeed, they could not trust the Lord, as if he had no Power or Strength to preserve them. Then I cried, O Lord, many are weak and feeble, and the Cruelty of Men hath been great, terrible, and desperately wicked; and thou hast suffered them to be very cruel, to the Astonishment of many; insomuch that many a poor Soul hath been tossed as with a Tem∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st; and for Want of keeping to that blessed Guide and Rock, Christ Jesus, who alone was able to give them Boldness and Courage to go
<PB N="110" REF="002815_0127_0FE64EE31316B800"/>
thro' the Work of this Day of Af∣fliction; many a poor one hath fallen, not knowing they should be depri∣ved of so great a Reward that we have, and do enjoy; blessed be thy Holy Name for ever. And Lord, thou knowest that my Heart is pained within me; my Soul is in Travail, and my Bowels is rolling towards the Poor and the Distressed, the tos∣sed with Tempest, and not comfort∣ed; the Enemy of their Souls is bu∣sie to cast them down, and to fill their Minds with Trouble and Unbe∣lief, always casting before them their Unfaithfulness, and would fain keep them in Bondage, and from return∣ing unto thee by true Repentance, that thou mayst heal their Backsli∣dings, and teach them to be more faithful for Time to come. O Lord, what shall I do for them? They are often in my Remembrance. Lord, open my Heart in Prayer more and more and bow thy Ear to the Sup∣plication of thy Servant, as thou hast done many a Time; and accept of
<PB N="111" REF="002815_0128_0FE64F1E34EFA2C0"/>
the Prayer of thy Servant, for them who cannot pray for themselves. O Lord, if it may stand with thy bles∣sed Will, once more to afford them a Day of Visitation, and try them a∣gain. O Lord, deal not with them according to their Deserts; but Lord, I pray thee, have Compassion on the Works of thy Hands, and remember poor Mortals this Day; for surely many of them are greatly distressed, and compassed about with many Temp∣tations, and my Heart is pained for them. And in this mournful State, the Lord was pleased to speak com∣fortably unto me in the Secret of my Heart, in a living Spring of Life, and said, <HI>The Time of the Deliverance of my People draweth near, and nearer than many are aware of Tho' I have suffered their Enemies for a Time to triumph over them, yet too many have grown high and lofty, and forgotten the Days of their Distress and Calamity, and what State they were in when I first found them out, as it were without Hope: Then did I send forth my Light and my
<PB N="112" REF="002815_0129_0FE64EE388F847A8"/>
Truth, which many received with Thank∣fulness of Heart, and with a ready Mind, and bowed thereunto, and yield∣ed Obedience for a Time. But after I had confounded their Enemies, and ap∣peared for their Deliverance, and en∣riched them greatly, then they forgot the Days of their Distress and Poverty, and the many Promises that they made unto me in the Day when they were sorely beset with many Enemies, with∣in, and without. But since I have ap∣peared for them, and confounded their Foes, and have done more for them; than they looked for, or expected at my Hands, how have they forgotten to pay their Vows unto me, that many of them made unto me in the Days of their Di∣stress? And how far are they gone into old Israel's Sins? Nay, have not some so much lost their Senses, as to put Light for Darkness, and Darkness for Light? But blessed are all they who con∣tinue truly humble, for my Covenant is firm, for ever established, and never to be altered with my Remnant that have been faithful, that have parted with all

O these are mine, and my Secrets shall be with them; they shall be found worthy to stand in the Gap, and to interceed for the People; notwithstanding their Poverty, and the Nothingness of themselves, yet they shall be as Instruments in my Hand, to pro∣claim my dreadful Day, and the Day of my Vengeance amongst the People, What many may hear, and fear, and turn unto me by true Repentance, that I may heal their Backslidings, and receiving them freely. And in Order there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> I will bring a Day of Deliverance for my People, and many of them shall praise my Name, and tell of my wondrous Works, and what I have done for them that others may be encouraged to be faithful the Residue of their Days; for I have seen many bemoaning them∣selves in Desolation and sorely bewail∣ing

their lost Condition; for many have been made desolate, by reason of the Cruelty of the wicked one, and they be∣ing desolate, have mourned unto me, and I have seen the Bemoaning of my People; and I have seen the Travails of the Faithful for the Unfaithful; and for the Cries of the Poor, and the Sigh∣ings of the Needy, will I arise, and I will work a Way for the Deliverance of my People; for the Time is near, that the Prison shall not inclose them, but they shall come forth, and declare and publish my wondrous Works; for I will work, and none shall be able to hin∣der; and many shall proclaim my dread∣ful Day, and the Day of my Vengeance; that many may hear, and fear, and return unto the Lord by true Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>Oh this was the glad Tydings that livingly lived with me Night and Day in the Time of my Confinement. O it was great Satisfaction to my travel∣ling Soul; it answered the very Peti∣tion that many a Time I had put up in the Night Season unto the living God, everlasting Honour, Glory and

Renown be given unto him that li∣veth for evermore, saith my Soul. For surely I cannot but admire the wonderful Loving Kindness, and Mer∣cies and Favours of the Lord our God. The High and Holy One that inhabits Eternity, is condescending to the Poor, and to the Low, and the Little; he hath revealed his Secrets to many who have not thought them∣selves worthy to be made Partaken of so great a Benefit; but their great∣est Concern hath been, for the Re∣demption of their Souls from under Satan's Power; and when that was done, now Lord preserve me in thy Fear for ever, and keep me from Sin∣ning against thee, that my Soul may not go into Captivity again.</P>
<P>This was the chiefest Concern of my Spirit, in the Time of my great Afflictions, in the Passage out of <HI>E∣gypt's</HI> Land, and thro' the Wilderness, where I met with many Straits, and great Hardships, and many Enemies; and many crooked Ways, and By▪Paths that the Enemy of my Soul
<PB N="116" REF="002815_0133_0FE64EEBA84D3AF0"/>
had cast up to catch my Feet in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but the Lord in his infinite Goodness, who never failed his Children that sought him, above all Things, he provided me a Way for me to escape his Snares, as he did his <HI>Israel</HI> in former Days, Glory be given unto his Holy Name for ever. This was Part of the Ex∣ercise during the Time of my Confine∣ment with my Husband, and many more of the Servants of the most High God, in <HI>Ivelchester-</HI>Goal. And when the Time drew near of our Delive∣rance, when I came out of the Prison to go to the Sessions held at <HI>Brewton,</HI> I assuredly believed that the Time was near (that lived in my Heart) that the Prison should not enclose us any lon∣ger, tho' it was altogether unlikely; for our Persecutors were exceeding wicked against us, altho' our grand Persecutor the Priest, was at that Time taken off in a very remarkable Manner, as before mentioned; not∣withstanding, many remained, that were very cruel, and acted cruelly and unjustly against us; and put by the

Jury that were chosen of our Neigh∣bours, and called another Jury pre∣sently in the Court, such as they thought most fit for their Turns. Then the Clerk began, and read an Indictment, <HI>viz. That we were found, or taken at an unlawful Assembly, in Force of Arms, in Contempt of the King, and his Laws, Crown and Dig∣nity, to the Terror of the People, &amp;c.</HI> And he said to the Jury, <HI>Gentlemen, you have heard their Indictment, if you find them guilty, you find for the King.</HI> And a Bishop that safe upon the Bench with the Judge, stood up and said, <HI>That the first Quaker that ever was in</HI> England, <HI>was banged for be∣ing one concerned in the Popish Plot.</HI> I answered, That the first that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣led a Quaker, was now alive. He fall again, <HI>He could prove by sufficient Wit∣ness that he was banged for being one in the Popish Plot.</HI> Then the Bishop being enraged, by reason he was con∣tradicted, held up his Hand towards us, and bid us <HI>have a Care what we said, for them that had Estates amongst

us, it should cost them their Estates, and them that had not, should lie in Pri∣son whilst they perish'd.</HI> Such was their great Rage and Wickedness against us, that it was very grievous to hear them; but there was a secret Cry ma∣ny Times ran thro' my Heart unto the Lord, <HI>Lord, work for thy Name Sake, and confound their Wisdom and Rage, and bring down their proud and wicked Spirits, and bring to nought their mischievous Contrivance, that they have been contriving against thy Innocent People, as they have been making them∣selves, merry, and drinking Wine to the full, and feeding themselves with the Fatness of the Earth</HI> (as Drives did) <HI>and have what their Hearts lust after, and yet none of all these Things will give them Content nor Satisfaction; no, no, but the Destruction of a poor des∣pised People. O Lord, make thy Power known this Day, and that that will make most for thy Honour, and the Prosperity of thy blessed Truth, do thou bring to pass this Day, that it may be known that there is a God in Heaven,

that can rule the Hearts of the Chil∣dren of Men; and make them to know that there is a God, whom all Men ought to fear, honour and obey.</HI></P>
<P>And surely the Lord was pleased to hear the Prayers of his Children, and to answer the Request of them in the Days of their Afflictions; for this Jury whom they chose, as they thought most fit for the Work, was long absent; but when they came with their Verdict, the Foreman could not readily speak, but looked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like a dead Man. Then the Bishop in a Rage, asked him, <HI>Whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were guilty, or not guilty?</HI> He answer∣ed, <HI>Guilty of not going to Church, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not of a Riot.

Cryer of the Court shaked his White Rod over my Head, and said, <HI>Be si∣lent.</HI> I said, <HI>No, we may not be silent, we are a sober People, and live a good Life and Conversation; we do unto all Men, as we would be done by; I never wronged Man, Woman, nor Child; nor I know none that have ought against us, unless for the Answer of a good Con∣science.

But no sooner were they gone, but a

great Concern fell upon me to follow them; I could neither eat nor drink, but was press'd in my Spirit to go after them; and when I came, they were sitting down to their Dinner, with a Noise of Musick playing at the going up of their Dishes, which were very many of the choicest Things. I went in amongst them whilst they were at Dinner, but I did not see a fit Opportunity, but waited till they had dined; and as they were rising, I came in with a great Dread and Awe over my Spirit. One of the Great Men came to me, and said, <HI>Good Woman, who would you speak withal?</HI> I said, the Judge of the Ses∣sions; he said, <HI>I am the Judge, if you have any thing to say, I am ready to hear you.</HI> But he not being the Man that sate upon the Bench that Day, I said, <HI>Thou art not the Man that I am go∣ing unto.</HI> Then he turned towards the Judge that sate that Day, and said, <HI>This Woman hath something to say to you.</HI> Then one of the Justices laid his Hand upon my Shoulder, and
<PB N="122" REF="002815_0139_0FE64EF55AE63B00"/>
said, <HI>Let this good Woman have what she will to say, we will hear her.</HI> But I getting near to the Judge, and Bi∣shop, that sate at the upper End of the Table, said, <Q>Forasmuch as you are all here, that sate in Judgment a∣gainst us this Day, I have a Con∣cern upon my Spirit in Vindicati∣on of our Innocency; we are well known amongst our Neighbours to be a sober and an honest People, that live a good Life and Conver∣sation; we do no Wrong to none, we can do Good to them that hate us, and pray for them that despite∣fully use us.

Just and righteous God will one Day plead; and as sure as the Day gives its Light, and the Covenant of the Day and Night cannot be broken, there is not a Man here, nor any that draws Breath in the open Air, that shall escape the Tribunal Seat of God's Divine Justice, till a Sentence of a just Recompence of Reward every one shall receive for their Deeds done in their Life-Time, whether they be good or evil.</Q></P>
<P>And I can truly say, the Dread of the Lord was upon me, inso∣much that they were smitten, and Paleness appeared in their Faces, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had not a Word to say.

But whe∣ther you will hear, or forbear, I shall be clear in the Day of Account, of all your Blood.</HI> So I left them, and returned to my Place, and had great Peace with the Lord; but we were not cal∣led into Court no more that Day: but the Morrow Morning early, we were called to come into Court, in Order to finishing our Trial; but the Bishop came no more into the Court, that we saw, or knew of; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Judge was very moderate that Day; a great Change indeed! he only called to the Keeper to bring up the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and called some of us by Name, and said, <HI>You that stand here indicted the Court Fines you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a-piece,</HI> and never spake a Word of the Pay∣ment of the Money, but broke up the Court (their Business being done) and went their Way, and our Keep∣er also lest us, to our great Admira∣tion: Above Fourscore Prisoners that

<P>He went his Way in muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Love, praying God to bless us, and we re∣turned to our Habitations, with the Peace of the Lord in our Bosoms; everlasting Praises be given unto the Lord our God for evermore.</P>
<P>Now, my Children, the End and Aim of my leaving this to you, and all upon Record, is, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uture Ages
<PB N="126" REF="002815_0143_0FE64EF758578D58"/>
may know that the great God of Heaven and Earth, that brought up the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>Egypt's</HI> Bondage, that made the Waters stand on Heaps, and brought his Children thro' on dry Land, and over-turned <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and all his Host, he it is that is our God; in whom we have belie∣ved, and his Power is not lessened, that he cannot save, nor his Arm shortned, that it cannot deliver, this Day, as in former Days, Praises to his Name for ever.</P>
<P>This, my dear, Children, you known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certainly true; but for you and all others to keep in Remembrance these and all other Mercies that the Lord our God hath bestowed upon us, ever since he gathered us to be a People, which is Eight and Thirty Years a∣go; for I was in the Nineteenth Year of my Age, when <HI>J.

Ministry so dreadful, that it pierced the Hearts of Thousands. O the Dread and Terror that seized upon my Heart, at the Sound of <HI>John Aud∣land'</HI>s Voice, and the Sight of him, before I rightly understood what he said. But before the Meeting was over, the Spirit of the Lord moved in my Heart, and in the Light I came to see my woful and deplorable State, which made me to cry to God for Mercy; a Day never to be forgotten by me. And now I have arrived to the Seven and Fiftieth Year of my Age. Oh! the many Deliverances, both inward and outward, have I been made a living Witness of. The many Decrees that have been Sealed against us, the many Threatnings of Ruin and Destruction have been sound∣ed in our Ears, how have we been as killed all the Day long? and count∣ed as Sheep for the Slaughter, and yet behold we are a live to this Day to praise the Lord. How have the Ene∣mies roared both inwardly and out∣wardly, and have come with open

Mouth to devour at once? And how hath our God helped us! The Great God of Heaven and Earth is he that hath been our Strength in a needful Time; and hath sustained his People by the Strength of his Arm, and hath born up our Heads above the Waters, that they have not drowned nor over∣turned us to this very Day, everlasting Honour be given unto the Lord for ever. But our Enemies hath he overturned, and broken their Bands in sunder, and have made them to bow under his dreadful Power, and hath taken many off in his Displeasure. Oh! what shall I say in the Behalf of all these his wondrous Works, that mine Eyes have seen? but more especially the inward Work of Regeneration. Oh! my Tongue is not able to de∣monstrate the Tenth Part of it, that the Lord hath been pleased to bring me thro'. Oh! what shall I say at the Remembrance of them, all which at this Time is livingly come up be∣fore me; but bow before the Lord, and prize his Mercies for evermore.</P>

And now, my dear Children, keep faithful to the Lord, and his blessed Truth, that you have been trained up in, and your Eyes shall see for your selves, as mine Eyes have for my self; be faithful to the Motion of the Spirit of Christ Jesus in your own Bosoms, and don't you overlook the little Things, for they that be not faithful in a little, shall never be made Ruler over much. Therefore, don't you exercise your selves in any Mat∣ter too high for you, but mind the Motion of the Spirit in your own Hearts, and hearken diligently to the Voice of the Lord, that your Souls may live; and keep the Lord always in your Remembrance, that you sin not against him. And remember to keep to the daily Cross, which will crucify all the Motions of the Flesh, and keep you alive to God, and near unto him; and in so doing, you will know his Councel; and <HI>seek the King∣dom of Heaven, and the Righteousness thereof, above all Things</HI> in this World, <HI>and other Things shall be added unto you.</HI>

For I will assure you, this is the Way that my Soul hath travelled in, and have found Favour with God. And one Thing more that I have experi∣enced, which hath been of Moment unto me, that in all my Afflictions, and Pain, and Sorrow of Body or Mind, I have not had an Eye to con∣fide in Man, but have applied my Heart to the Lord, and have poured forth my Soul unto him. O thou Physician of Value, that can cure both Soul and Body; thou that knows better how to administer to my Ne∣cessity, than I can ask of thee; from thee alone do I look for Comfort, for there is none besides thee, that can administer true Comfort to me. And the Lord in his due Time, hath appeared to my Comfort and Satis∣faction, and hath established my Go∣ings, and hath kept my Feet from falling, and my Heart from going astray, unto this very Day; everlast∣ing Honour be given unto his Name for evermore, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

And since I have seen the good Ef∣fects of my Labour and Travail, I earnestly beg of the Lord Night and Day, to do for you, as he hath done for me. Oh! how hath my Prayers ascended unto the Lord, in Publick, and in private, and in my Concerns, when my Hand hath been at my La∣bour, and on the High-way Side. O my Children, let it not be in vain, for I can truly say, that you have been the Children for whom many Prayers have been offered.</P>
<P>Therefore consider it, when I am gone from you, and can no longer watch over you; for my Time is much over. I have no long Time here on this Side the Grave; but I shall be gone, and see you no more in this World, nor take more Care for you, nor give more Counsel; therefore have I writ∣ten this little Account of Part of my Travails out of <HI>Egypt'</HI>s Bondage, to∣wards the Land of Rest and Peace; which have been thro' great Difficul∣ties, and thro' many a sore Combate with the Enemy of my Soul's Peace;
<PB N="132" REF="002815_0149_0FE64F3B2579B448"/>
many a fiery Trial, and thro' a Vale of Tears; but don't you be discoura∣ged at it, for you know how won∣derfully the great God of Heaven and Earth hath been my Support in Time of Need, and hath born up my Spirit, and given me more Strength than I could have believed, if it had been declared unto me. And now I seeing so many Professors of Truth at this Day, going on at such an easie Rate, and so careless, and so indiffe∣rent, so slighting the Cross, and so little regarding the Travail of their Souls, and so little concerned for their Soul's Good, and so slighting the Te∣stimonies of Truth, and spending their precious Time and Season that God hath put into their Hands; as if Heaven's Glory and a State of Eter∣nity were not worth the looking af∣ter; and as if there was no God to punish for these Things, nor any Day of Account.</P>
<P>Oh! the Consideration of these Things hath been weightily upon my Spirit for many Months, and Morn∣ing
<PB N="133" REF="002815_0150_0FE64F5E1F2B1C58"/>
and Evening hath my Heart been afflicted, saying within my self, <HI>Lord, what will become of such? I fear the Visitation of many of them is almost over. Oh! how does my Soul lament for them; and has the greater Con∣cern upon my Spirit, to interceed with the Lord to preserve me and mine for ever. O Lord, my Soul is con∣cern'd, and my Heart is bowed at this Time in the Sense and Feeling of thy everlasting Love, and Mercies and Blessings that thou hast bestowed upon me a poor distressed Object, till thou took Pity on me, and looked on me in the Days of my Distress, and spread <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Skirt over me. And now in Consi∣deration of this thy great Love that thou shewedst unto me when I was be∣moaning my self like a silly Dove with out a Mate, or like a Mournful Widow, or like a Sparrow upon the House-Top, that is sitting alone. Oh! when it comes up before me, Lord, how is my Heart broken? and how is my Spirit melted, and how doth my Soul-love the Lord, and desires for ever more to obey

<P><HI>And now, O Lord my God, seeing thou hast been pleased thus to deal with me, and to have a Regard to the low Estate of thy Handmaid, and hast heard my Prayers, and answered many a Time; O Lord, if I have found Fa∣vour in thy Sight, this once more hear my Petition this Evening, and grant me my Request; and Lord, thou that hast kept me all my Life long, to this very Day, bless my Children, by preser∣ving of them in thy Fear. Cause them to remember thy Mercies, and thy Bles∣sings from Year to Year, and from Day to Day; and cause them to remember what thou hast done for them, and their Father and Mother, in the Days of their great Affliction, when Destriction and Ruine were determined against us; and when we were almost past Hope, how hast thou appeared, and confounded our Enemies before our Eyes? Lord, let these Things never be forgotten by me,

nor them, whilst we have a Day to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the Earth. But, O Lord, I pray thee bless and sanctify all these thy Bles∣sings and Mercies bestowed upon us, and give us a thankful Heart, and humble Mind, and more and more unite us unto thee, and cause us to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k worthy of the same. Oh that my Heart was but wor∣thy enough; for methinks my Heart is not able to set forth thy Praises enough: No, surely 'tis impossible for Tongue to declare thy infinite Goodness, and thy Noble Acts. But, Lord, we that have made our Choice of thee, and have be∣lieved in thy Son Christ Jesus, have known him to be sufficient Strength in Time of Need; and we that have known thy holy Arm to be made bare, for the Deliverance of us out of Thraldom and Captivity, have known it sufficient to preserve us to this very Day. There∣fore, O Lord, strengthen my Faith, Hope, and Confidence, that I may steadfastly believe that thou wilt preserve my Chil∣dren, when I am gone to my Resting-Place. Lord keep my Family, and thy People; let not one of them be lost, or

O Lord, if thou shouldest yet add more Days to my Life, let me not cease to pray for them, and their Offspring, that I may do my Endeavour for their Entrance into thy blessed Kingdom; so shall I go to my Grave in Peace. And now, O Lord, I do wholly resign them into thy Hands, as knowing right well thou art able to keep them thro' Faith, and preserve them all their Days, and to do more for them than I am able to ask of thee. O Lord, whatever Exercise they meet with∣al, Lord strengthen them, and bear up their Spirits, that they may not be o∣vercome with the Temptations of the Wicked one: For, Lord, thy Power hath been sufficient to redeem my Soul. So Lord, once more do I commit the keep∣ing of my Spirit, with my Children, and all thy Flock and Family upon the Face of the whole Earth, with whom my Soul is at Peace, and in Unity; and do feel the Renewings of thy Love at this Time, which is the greatest Comfort that can be here enjoyed; therefore does my Heart, Soul and Spirit, and all that

<HEAD>A Salutation of my endeared Love in God's Holy Fear and Dread, and for the clearing of my Conscience, once more unto you of that City of Bristol, amongst whom my Soul hath some Years travailed under many a dreadful Exercise, which hath made my Bones to shake, and my Heart to tremble be∣fore the Great God of Heaven and Earth, who will yet further bring his notable Day, wherein all Flesh shall tremble before him.</HEAD>
<P>AND now in the Sense of the great Love of God that hath been extended unto you of that City continually, first, in sending of the Servants amongst you, and endued them with Power from on High, that it wrought effectually upon many, whereby many are brought out of <HI>E∣gypt</HI>'s Darkness, and thro' the Red-Sea Spiritually, and could sing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord, as <HI>Moses</HI> and the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> did, when the Lord had wrought wonderfully for their Deliverance

and by a high Hand and a wonderful Power brought them forth: And bles∣sed be the Lord God Almighty, and honoured be his worthy Name, and the right Arm of his Strength, there are many living Witnesses of these Things in this our Day. Oh! <HI>dear Friends!</HI> for∣get it not, but dwell low in the Sense of your deplorable States that you were in, when first the Lord reached unto you, and opened that Eye in you, that let you see you were undone for ever, if the Lord did not arise for your De∣liverance, when many cried out, <HI>for a Saviour, or else I perish for ever.</HI> O Friends! what was too dear for us to part with in that Day for the Lord? Truly can my Soul say, <HI>That all that ever my Eyes beheld, was nothing to me in Comparison to my Soul's Redemp∣tion.</HI> Oh! it was precious in my Eye, and to this very Day the living Re∣membrance of it dwells fresh upon my Spirit at this Time▪ and my Heart and Soul loveth the Lord, and bles∣seth his worthy Name for ever, and for evermore.

Month, hath the Mind and Will of the Lord been declared, and Mes∣senger after Messenger, insomuch that many a full Stomach lothed the Ho∣ney-Comb, and all that seemed to re∣ceive it, made not a right Use of it; for the Lord's End, in sending his Servants in Days past, was, that his People might be fitted and prepared, that a Judgment, or a Destruction should not come upon his Children at unawares, but that they should believe the Testimonies of his Truth, and take Warning by it, and amend their Lives, and be bowed in Spirit, and humbled under the great God of Heaven and Earth, that your Prayers in this State might ascend unto the long provoked God, whose Anger is waxen hot, and nothing will appease his Anger, but true Repentance, and that with Speed, and true Broken∣ness of Heart.

Come, put your Hands to the Work, and your Shoul∣ders to the Burden, and cry mightily unto the Lord to spare a little, and give a little Time to renew your Strength in him, that you may do something for the Lord, tho' but at the last Hour; for surely Friends, the last Hour to many is very near; and the long invited, if they miss of this Hour, they will never have ano∣ther Hour to work for the living God; and therefore is my Soul concerned, and my Heart pained within me, and Shortness of Time is much before me, and therefore I beg it of you, that you will lay it to Heart, before it be too late, and consider how soon the Lord can call for your Breath; for our Lives here are likened to the Flower of the Field, as the Lord said to his Prophet, when he said, <HI>What shall I cry?

<P>Oh! the Lord grant me my Re∣quest, and bow his Ear to my Prayer; for I am very earnest with the Lord, and my Heart is pained within me on your Behalf.

Oh <HI>Friends!</HI> I can hardly write what ariseth in my Heart, as touching this Matter; but in the Fear of the Lord, I have this to say, Your Eyes should have seen the Wonders of the Lord in a miraculous Manner, as they did that thus leaned upon the Lord, and trust∣ed in his Strength, and believed in him, and then all Things were pos∣sible; and by obeying of the Com∣mand of the Lord, the Walls of <HI>Je∣richo</HI> fell: But if they had reasoned with Flesh and Blood, or thought the Instruments too mean, or consulted with Reasoning, they had never seen the Power of the Lord to do his Work; neither shall any now this Day, that reason with Flesh and Blood:

No, no, first learn Obedience, give up to obey the Lord, and then your Eyes shall see the blessed Work of the Lord to be fulfilled in its due Time; for he is God Almighty, and all-suffi∣cient, therefore let every Heart con∣fide in his Power.</P>
<P>So, <HI>dear Friends,</HI> keep your Hearts with all Diligence; for out of it are the Issues of Life; for we all well know, that the People that live most chaste, keep nearest to the Lord, and they that are nearest, hear most of his Counsel: And truly <HI>Friends,</HI> the Time is at Hand, when all shall be distres∣sed for the Lord, and the most Faith∣ful will not spare of the Heavenly Oyl; then it will be too late for any to go to buy. Oh! it often riseth in my Heart, that yet a little Time, and Time unto many will be no more, for which my Soul is more concern∣ed, than for any outward Suffering; for, surely <HI>Friends,</HI> it is in my Heart to believe, that the great God of Hea∣ven and Earth, who hath been long provoked, and tried many Ways, and

O do but look back a little, and consider, and see whether you can count the Mercies of the Lord that he has be∣stowed upon this Land, both Spiritual and Temporal; no, no, they are past num∣bring: Well then, do you not think that the just and righteous God doth look for something at your Hands? yes surely, O Inhabitants of <HI>England, a Sacrifice of a bro∣ken Heart, and a contrite Spirit, and a trem∣bling at his Word,</HI> will be that which will engage the Lord for to continue his Mer∣cies to this Land. <HI>O wash and make you clean, put away the Evil of your Doings, cease to do Evil, and learn to do well. Cleanse your Hands you Sinners, and purify your Hearts you double-minded ones.</HI> For this know, that the Day of the Lord draws near, wherein he will be a swift Witness against the Wicked; and the Ungodly must be turn∣ed into Hell, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of Teeth for ever; therefore look to it, I entreat you, before it be too late; and fear the Lord, and dread his glorious Majesty, for he will be a swift Witness against the Wicked.</P>
<P><HI>And thou, O City of</HI> London! <HI>What shall I say to thy Inhabitants, that my Spirit may be eased: O

fear, dread and tremble before the great and terri∣ble God, who can dash you in Pieces, and lay you as dead Men and Women before him; he will pull down your Crown of Pride, and lay your Honour in the Dust: Therefore hasten to Repentance be∣fore it be too late, for the Lord has long strove with you, therefore look to it be∣fore it be too late, I entreat you, and before the Lord pour forth his Vials of Wrath upon this Land, and his long For∣bearance comes to an End, and his Decree be seal∣ed and the Angel of God swear by him that liveth for ever and ever, that there shall be Time no longer. O then it will be too late, and then it may be possible that you may cry and call to the Rocks and Mountains to fall upon you, for to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ids you from the Wrath of the Lamb, his Fury will be so great; and therefore whilst there is a little Time afforded unto you, prize it; and prize the everlasting Mercies of so great and gracious a God, that has blest this Nation with so many Spiritual and temporal Blessings as he hath done: O let not your Unworthiness draw down his Ven∣geance upon your Heads, after all this his infi∣nite Mercies and Favours bestowed upon us; my hearty Desire is, that you may receive and embrace the Love of God whilst it is proffered unto you, that by it your Hearts may be seasoned and made fit to receive his Blessings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And this I have more to say to many of thy In∣habitants, O</HI> England, <HI>be true-hearted one to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other, and seek the Good one of another, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

down to Sobriety. Let your Moderation appear unto all People▪ and in as much as in you lieth, endeavour (you who have Power in your Hands) to suppress Wickedness, that Fruits of Christia∣nity may appear, that this Nation of</HI> England <HI>hath made a large Profession of ever since I have had a Remembrance and Understanding of it, and I believe long before. O come now, let Fruits of Christianity appear, which will be better than many Years talking of it; the Lord hath put a Day into your Hands again, wherein you may do good. O make a good Use of it, whilst you have it, lest you provoke the Lord to take it out of your Hands again, and leave you in Sorrow to lament. Then will your latter End be worse than your Beginning, and your Account greater than ever, and your Measure more filled up than ever, and by so doing will be made fit for Destruction. Oh! my Soul's Desire it, that where-ever this may come, that it may take Place upon the Hearts of People; for sure∣ly it is high Time for People to be awakened to Amendment of Life, seeing their Time is so far gone, that many have spent in Vanity and Plea∣sure, which will add to their Sorrow upon their dying-Beds, when not one Day more will be left them for to repent.</HI></P>
