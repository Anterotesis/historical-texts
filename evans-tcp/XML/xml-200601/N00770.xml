<BIBL>Hornbeck, de convers. Indor. Ex Acosta.</BIBL>
<P>De industria pernicies tanta conceditur, imo vero ap∣petitur; propter privatas nescio quas Commoditates Alij Indorum operas Larga Ebrietate concessa, sibi conciliant. Alij non Solum bibere sinunt, verum ipsi quoque temu∣lentiam propinant. Neque tam turpis, infamisque quaestus pudet, — gladium ultro porrigentes insano. Atque haec nostri factitant, Lucrumque ex animarum interitu Captant.</P>
