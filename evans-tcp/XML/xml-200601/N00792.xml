<P>Be not silent whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, yet speak unto them.

<P>Some of them (thou knowest) do neither read the Scriptures, nor pray in their Families, nor Catechize them that are committed to their charge.</P>
<P>Others pray not in their Closets, nor do they commune with their own hearts about their spiritual estates; they exa∣mine not themselves, whether they be in the Faith, or whether Christ be in them; they compare not themselves with the Word of God, to know how it is with them.</P>
<P>Some spend their time and strength, and Estates in Rioting and Drunken∣ness, in Chambering and Wantonness in Strife and Envying.</P>
<P>Some trifle away their precious time

<P>Some embrace this present world with <HI>Demas.</HI></P>
<P>Some are lovers of Pleasure more than lovers of God.</P>
<P>Some acknowledge God in their words, and in their works deny him.</P>
<P>Some have left their first love.</P>
<P>Some are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold.</P>
<P>Some say, Lord, Lord, but will not do the things that he says unto them.</P>

<P>Some love in word and tongue, but not in deed and truth.</P>
<P>Some fashion themselves according to this world, yet would not be thought to be of the world.</P>
<P>Some Dedicate and Devote their

Never, or never to any purpose, minding them of their Baptis∣mal Covenant and Engagement, to be wholly and only the Lords.</P>
<P>Some neglect relative Duty, (as thou Conscience knowest very well.)</P>
<P>Are not some Husbands bitter to their Wives, and some Wives disobedient to their Husbands?</P>
<P>Do not some Parents provoke their Children to wrath? and do not some Children dishonour their Parents?</P>
<P>Do not some Masters deny that which is just and equal to their Servants? and are not some Servants unfaithful to their Masters?

Doubtless thou doest, and doubtless thou doest often nip and twinge them for it. But good Conscience make them feel, make them smart, let them not go on in peace, disturb them, haunt them continually, tell them their own, and take a fit time and season for it.</P>
<P><PB REF="000954_0016_0FAD978C11C8CF88"/>My Reader doth frequently, or some∣times at least, hear Sermons, Sermons of the necessity of the New-birth, Faith, Repentance, Holiness. Take this op∣portunity, Conscience, of telling him the truth. Say to him, hearest thou what the Preacher says? hath he not clearly proved the necessity of New-birth, Faith, Repentance, Holiness unto life Eternal? What wilt thou do, Man, Woman? Thou art not New-born, thou hast not believed nor repented, thou art no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Holy.

<P>My Reader prays constantly, or some∣times at least, and says, Lord give me a better Heart, a new Heart, a clean Heart, a soft Heart, a single Heart Lord, write thy Law in my Heart, plant thy Fear in my Heart, put thy Spirit into me, cause me to walk in thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P>My Reader is sometimes busy in his Calling: Conscience go to him and say, Oh how busy thou art for back &amp; belly! what provision makest thou for thy soul?</P>
<P>My Reader is sometimes at a Feast, or at his own Table: go to him Consci∣ence, and say, O how sweet this meat is to thy taste! when shall the Word of God, and the meat indeed, and the drink indeed, be as sweet.</P>
<P>My Reader is sometimes in a Tavern, Ale House, or Coffee-house; Conscience, when he has done his necessary business there, go to him and say, Is not thy Fa∣mily or Closet a fitter place for thee to be in?</P>
<P>Sometimes he is walking in the fields; Conscience go to him and ask him what he is meditating on, and put him in mind of <HI>Isaac's</HI> practice. <HI>Gen</HI> 24.6.</P>
<P>My Reader is sometimes sick: go to him, Conscience, and say, This is the just hand of God upon thee: and bid him take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bible and read <HI>Jer.</HI> 4.18</P>
<P>Sometimes my Reader takes Physick,

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> General. <HI>What Conscience is.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly. Conscience is a mans Judge∣ment of himself, <HI>i. e.</HI> Of his Estate and Actions: Or thus, if you will; <HI>Conscience is a Power of the Soul; for the Soul is endowed with N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble Powers and Faculties, Ʋnderstanding, Conscience, Memory, Will and Affections: and Conscience is not the least of them. I say, Conscience is a Power of the Soul taking notice and bearing witness of all a mans Thoughts, Words and Actions; and as it finds them, either to agree or not agree with the Rule, it accuses or excuses, absolves or condemns, comforts or torments.</HI> This is Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ence. Do you think there is any such

Inhabitant in you? It may be some have taken no notice of any such In∣habitant in the House of their Soul, whether there be any such Power of the Soul or no. I say it again, Conscience is a Power of the Soul, taking notice, and bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing witness, (it takes notice that it may bear witness) of all a man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thoughts, Words, and Actions; and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it finds his Thoughts, Words, or Acti∣ons, to be either agreeing or not agreeing w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Rule, so it doth excuse or ac∣cuse, absolve or condemn, comfort or torment. This is Conscience.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="000954_0026_0FAD979391BEDCA8"/>
is that? It is Conscience. Conscience is no mean thing, it is Gods Deputy, and what is said of God in that place is true of Conscience: <HI>Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and thou art acquainted with all my ways, for there is not a word in my mouth, but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether: Thou hast be∣set me behind and before.</HI> So that a man cannot stir but God seeth, and Conscience seeth; and knoweth and taketh notice of it; and one would wonder how Conscience will revive what was done seven years, and three times seven years ago. Conscience will whisper in your ear, this was in your heart, and this was in your tongue, and this was in your hands, this was thought by you, that was sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken by you, and that was done by you; that which we had utterly forgotten, how fresh many years after doth Conscience bring it to mind? Conscience took notice of it, and did well observe it. Thus Con∣science is a Power of the Soul taking notice.</P>

If Conscience be a Witness, there is no need of any further Witness. As they said of Christ, <HI>What need we any further witness, we have it from his own mouth</HI>? So will the Lord say to the Sinner, What need any further Witness his own Conscience is witness? You read of the Testimony of Con∣science, sometimes it is for, and sometimes against.</P>

<P N="3">3. It further follows, that Consci∣ence is a Power of the Soul taking no∣tice of, and bearing witness of a mans Thoughts, Words, and Actions, so that the Thoughts shall not escape Con∣sciences Observation, nor shall a Word escape Consciences hearing, nor a Work Consciences recording. And as Con∣science find the Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughts, Words or Actions, either agreeing or not agreeing with the Rule, it will excuse or accuse.

But where are they that have or do carry themselves so, that their Consciences have no occasion to accuse them, or to reproach them? Com∣mend me to that person if you can.

<P><PB N="23" REF="000954_0042_0FAD97A1D40E9138"/>I come now to the Proof of the Doctrine. This was <HI>Jobs</HI> care you see; he was resolved upon it, that he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld so walk and so watch that Conscience might have no occasion to reproach him. And hath <HI>Job</HI> no Fellows? yea many; the Scripture speaketh of such that have made it their care so to walk, that Conscience might have no just occasion to reproach them. <HI>David</HI> was one of them, as appears by what he saith, <HI>Psal.</HI> 16.8. <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.3, 112, 113. although there was a time when he gave Conscience too great occasion to re∣proach him, and his Conscience did reproach him to purpose at last. Ah poor <HI>David</HI>! what broken bones had he? This was <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> care, else he could not have had the testimony of his Conscience for him as he had; <HI>Remember</HI> (saith he▪ <HI>Isa.</HI> 38 3.) <HI>O Lord how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.</HI> Perfect heart, that is an upright heart; perfection, not of degrees, but of parts; is there to be understood.

<P>The grounds and reasons of it fol∣low. One reason why we should take all possible care that Conscience may have no occasion to reproach us, is because if occasion be given, these re∣proaches are unavoidable, I say these re∣proaches, vexations and accusations of Conscience will be unavoidable; there is no escaping from them: we may give occasion to others, and possibly there may be some avoiding that which we give occasion of; but here is no avoid∣ing or escaping in this case.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAving already shewed you what Conscience is, and a∣bout what it is imployed, and how it is imployed, and given you several rea∣sons why we should make it our great care so to live, that Conscience may not reproach us while we live: and having made some Use of the Doctrine, I now come to resolve two questions or cases.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first is, how we may so live, walk and act, and carry our selves, that Conscience may have no cause to re∣proach us another day?</P>
<P N="2">2. If we have so lived, so Walked, so acted, and so carried our selves, that
<PB N="38" REF="000954_0057_0FAD97AE73C6AB50"/>
Conscience hath had just cause to re∣proach us, and doth reproach us; what is to be done that the reproaches of Conscience may be wiped off, that Conscience may be quiet and cease to accuse and condemn, cease to vex and torment? These are the two cases I am to answer.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="case">
<P><HI>Case</HI> 1. How may we so live, walk, act and carry our selves, that Conscience may have no cause to reproach us? You see that <HI>Job</HI> did so live and carry himself, that though his friends did re∣proach him, his Conscience did not re∣proach him; though his friends did charge him, yet his Conscience did dis∣charge him, though his friends did con∣demn him, yet his Conscience did ac∣quit him. He did so live, that he was able to maintain his integrity and Up∣righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness; and doubtless it is not a thing impossible, but we do not set to it, we do not se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about it in earnest. If we be Christians indeed, and not almost Christians, we might so live as Con∣science might have no just cause to re∣proach us. O Sirs, Relations may re∣proach us Wives may reproach Hus∣bands, and Husbands reproach Wives,
<PB N="39" REF="000954_0058_0FAD97AE9215E5E8"/>
Children may reproach Parents, and Servants reproach their Masters, and one Neighbour reproach another; but it is possible so to live, that Conscience all this while may be at peace, and not reproach us. Possibly you may be ready to think and say within your selves, Would we could tell how we might so live, pray let us have some directions how we may so live that Conscience may not reproach us. But before I give counsel should not I know of you whether you will follow it? And in case you will not follow it, why should I give it? Ask your selves there∣fore, if the Minister shall give us no o∣ther counsel than what God himself gives us, should not I follow it? Sirs, if I give you any other counsel than what God in his holy Word doth give you, I would entreat you not to follow it: nay, if you set it at naught I shall not be offended. Consider what <HI>Jethro</HI> said to <HI>Moses, Exod.</HI> 18.23. <HI>If thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so</HI>; so say I. Therefore consider, whether God say as I say, whether God command you so; if so, pray take heed how you do set at nought the Counsel of God. Now the
<PB N="40" REF="000954_0059_0FAD97AF51E36C08"/>
first Direction which I shall give you is this.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="direction">
<HEAD>Direction I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Set God always before you.</HI> And this will be a means so to live, that Con∣science may not reproach you. Assure your selves there is no time wherein Gods Back is turned, no time wherein Gods Eye is not upon you: if you can find a time when God is absent, you may take your liberty and do what you list. You know of what force the Masters presence is among the servants; of what force the Parents presence is a∣mong the Children to restrain them; of what force the presence of a Minister, or a grave, serious and holy Christian, is to restrain People from what otherwise they would take liberty to do. Sure Gods Presence should be of greater force to restrain us, if we do not live in the Apprehension thereof. O if we could but set God always before us, what manner of persons should we be in all holy Conversation, all holy cogi∣tation, and in all holy Communicati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n too! <HI>David</HI> did s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t God alwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s before him, and why should not we do so too? <HI>Psal</HI> 16 8. <HI>I have set the Lord always

You know how persons will carry themselves in the sight of Men, if they have any thing to do in the sight of others, how they will do it; O that we could do all we do as in the sight of God. This was the charge that was given to <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> by God himself, <HI>Gen</HI> 17.1. <HI>Walk before me and be thou perfect</HI>; that is, upright. There is no such way to be upright, as to live in the Apprehension of the Presence of God, and to have this always run in our thoughts, <HI>God heareth, God sees, and God knows.</HI> O that this were written upon your Desks and Shop Boards, <HI>God sees</HI>; O that this were written upon your Tables, <HI>God sees</HI>; O that this were written upon your Look∣ing Glass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <HI>God sees</HI>; O that this were written upon all your Attire and Dress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <HI>God see,</HI>; and O that this were written upon your Naked Breasts and Shoulders, <HI>God sees,</HI> and upon your Faces and Fore-heads too. I do assure you (Sirs)
<PB N="42" REF="000954_0061_0FAD97B0D4294910"/>
that God does see you; O that you would live in the continual Apprehen∣sion of it. God sees thee, God knows what all your thoughts are, what all your designs are, what all your sayings and doings are. Be ever thinking, <HI>God knows, God hears, God sees. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths, Prov</HI> 3.6. This will make you careful to keep Gods Precepts, if in all your ways you look upon God as your Observer and Overseer. This was that which made <HI>David</HI> careful to observe Gods Precepts, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.168. <HI>I have kept thy Precepts and thy Testimonies.</HI> O blessed <HI>David,</HI> how didst thou do this!

There is no hiding from God, he sees all our goings: we cannot set one foot before another, but God sees it. Alas, alas, if a man do but go out of doors, God

sees it, if he goes into the Field God sees it, if he goes to other Houses God sees it, if he goes to his own house, God sees it too. <HI>Prov.</HI> 15.3. <HI>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding the evil and the good.

You will see there is no going out of the sight and pre∣sence of God. Verily (Sirs) to set God always before us, and to live in the Sight and Apprehension of the Pre∣sence of God, this would have such an influence upon our thoughts, words and works, that it would make them pleasing to God; and if so, Conscience would never reproach us for them; for Con∣science will not reproach us for doing that which is pleasing to God.

I pray beware of setting up false rules; I shall name four, which we are very prone to walk by.</P>
<P N="1">1. Beware of setting up the practice of others whether great or good for your rule; the practices of good men are not always agreeable to the rule as they should be; Ministers and others may step aside, and too often do; therefore beware of setting up the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actice of

You will say, this was the practice of such a Mini∣ster, this is the practice of such a Pro∣fessor; but do they walk as Christ walked? if they follow Christ, thou mayst follow them; but if they do not follow Christ, we must not follow them, be they who they will.</P>
<P N="2">2. Beware of setting up the opinions of others, be they never so learned, for your rule, though they be the greatest Doctors in the World, and called <HI>Rabbi</HI> never so much. Set not up the Opini∣on of any for your rule, any further than they have the Word of God for their opinion. When God speaks we must consider who, but when Man speaks we must consider what; I say, when God speaks we must not consider what but who, but when Man speaks, we must not consider who but what. We know God cannot err, but we know that man may err.</P>

Nay further, if there be any question or doubt about any thing, whether it be a sin or no, what shall we do then?
