<HEAD>Good Souldiers A Great BLESSING.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Isaiah III.2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Mighty man, and the man of War—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> was imployed in delivering God's messages to his pro∣fessing people the Jews, when they were chargeable with great degene∣racies, with many and gross sins; some of which are mentioned in the 6, 8, 9 <HI>verses</HI> of the preceeding Chapter, as well as in sundry o∣ther places. For these sins, God by his Prophet threatens them, with various and terrible Judg∣ments. In the first verse of this Chapter he threatens them with Famine: <HI>he would take a∣way the Stay, and the staff, the whole stay of
<PB N="4" REF="000958_0003_0FADE3EA9835E428"/>
Bread, and the whole stay of water.</HI> In the se∣cond verse (containing our <HI>Text</HI>) God threat∣ens to take away their men of chief Note, that were most Eminent, Useful and Serviceable in their <HI>Military,</HI> their <HI>Civil,</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Af∣fairs. Our Text refers to the first of these, their men that were most Eminent, Useful and Ser∣viceable in <HI>Military</HI> Affairs, the <HI>Mighty man,</HI> and the <HI>Man of War</HI>; their valiant able <HI>Warri∣ours,</HI> these God threatens to take away from them in Judgment. From whence we may observe this Doctrine.</P>
<Q>That Valiant, Able Warriours among Gods People, are justly accounted a great Blessing to them.</Q>
<P>This is very plain, otherwise the taking a∣way of such men, would not be threatned as a Judgment, Curse, or Punishment. <HI>War</HI> consi∣dered meerly and absolutely in it self, is not good, nor should it be desired by any man. No War was ever begun or carried on, with sufficient reasons and just grounds on both sides. Either the <HI>Assailant</HI> or <HI>Defendant,</HI> surely sins; one party surely sins, and both commonly suf∣fer. War therefore considered meerly in its self▪ cannot lawfully be desired; for in desiring of it, we desire the sin and misery of some or other, neither of which is lawful in it self. Tho' tis thus, yet in some cases, <HI>War</HI> is not only
<PB N="5" REF="000958_0004_0FADE3EBB0944B68"/>
lawful, but also commendable, yea a necessary duty. Before I speak directly to the Doctrine, I shall endeavour a brief Answer to these two Inquiries, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>To whom does it belong to make War?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>What are the just causes of War?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>To whom does it belong to make War?</HI></P>
<P>For Answer, <HI>It belongs to the Chief Supream Authority, justly Established over a people, to make War.</HI> For the Supream Authority, is to defend the Subjects in their <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and to revenge the gross wrongs done to them by Enemies. It seems just and reasonable also, that the Supream Authority may delegate or com∣municate power, to far distant <HI>Provinces</HI> or <HI>Plantations</HI> under them, to make War in such and such cases, under such and such limitations, as the matter may be circumstanced. Notwith∣standing what has been said, it seems justifya∣ble for the smallest part or handful of any Nation, (tho' they have no direct Order or Commission, from the Supream or Subordinate Authority over them) to make a defensive War, when they are unjustly and suddenly as∣saulted by cruel Enemies; but 'tis no way al∣lowable for private unauthorized persons to make an offensive War. If upon Spoils or Robberies done by some of a Neighbouring Nation, private persons should, without Order or Commission from Authority, go and make
<PB N="6" REF="000958_0005_0FADE3EC2E8FB550"/>
War upon that Nation, they would sin great¦ly. Such a course as this would be likely, to Embroil Nations in continual Wars, Uproars and Confusions.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What are the just causes of making War?</HI></P>
<P><HI>For Answer,</HI> I suppose the most of them may be comprehended under these three gene∣ral heads. Either,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Defence, or self preservation from the unjust assaults of others.</HI> A Peoples fighting for the de∣fence of their <HI>Persons, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> seems altogether reasonable, having nothing to be said against it. Self-preservation, is a prin∣ciple implanted in all men, as well as other A∣nimals, and that by God himself. 'Tis also lawful for a people to make, or help in, a de∣fensive War, when their <HI>Allies</HI> or <HI>Confederates</HI> are unjustly assaulted and molested: thus <HI>Jo∣shua</HI> and the <HI>Israelites,</HI> being in <HI>League</HI> or Con∣federacy with the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> came to fight for them against their Enemies, <HI>Josh.</HI> 10.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Another just cause of War is, Recovery of great damages.</HI> When <HI>Ziklag</HI> was taken and ransacked, and the Wives, Children, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>David</HI> and his men were taken away by the <HI>Amalekites; David</HI> and his men made War upon them, for the recovery of those damage<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and did recover all. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 30. <HI>Ch.</HI> When <HI>Lot</HI> was taken Captive, and his Goods made a prey,
<PB N="7" REF="000958_0006_0FADE3ECD19E9308"/>
<HI>Abraham,</HI> his <HI>Allie</HI> and Friend made War upon the <HI>Aggressors</HI> or <HI>Assailants</HI> for the Recovery of damages, and did deliver <HI>Lot,</HI> and rescue his Goods. <HI>Gen.</HI> 14. I suppose under this Head, may be comprehended the unjust <HI>revolt of Sub∣jects,</HI> and <HI>falling off of Tributaries</HI>; for the gross default of such, it seems Justifyable to make War upon them, to reduce them to their for∣mer just order, duty and obedience.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Another just cause of War may be, the reven∣ging of Injuries.</HI> Though the case may be so circumstanced, that there's no possibility of re∣covering damages, or repairing the loss sustain∣ed, yet it may be not only lawful, but also a duty to revenge Injuries. Thus if our Heathen Neighbours should suddenly burn any of our <HI>Frontier Towns,</HI> &amp; destroy the Inhabitants there∣of, it would then be our duty, were it in our power, to revenge that Injury in the death of all the <HI>Actors</HI> in, and <HI>Abettors</HI> of, such Murder, although we could not possibly recover dama∣ges, or pay our selves for the Goods unjustly destroyed, or taken away. Having briefly premised these things concerning War, which possibly are not wholly forreign to our present occasion, we may now proceed to the <HI>Doctrine</HI> it self:
<Q>That valiant able Warriours among Gods People, are justly accounted a great Blessing to them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000958_0007_0FADE3EDAAFDF758"/>Here it seems very natural to raise these two Enquiries: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Who are to be accounted valiant, able, Warri∣ours? Or when may persons be justly so termed?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How does it appear that such persons among Gods people, are justly to be accounted a great Bles∣sing to them?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>Who are to be accounted valiant▪ able Warriours? Or when may persons be justly so termed?</HI> In order to an Answer, we may note, That Souldiers as such, are Instruments: that the goodness of Instruments is to be judged of bv their fitness or suitableness to obtain the end, whereunto they are designed. The Answer to the second of the premised Questions, about the just causes of War, tells us, that the end of Souldiers as such, or the use they are to be put to, is, to <HI>defend, recover</HI> damages, and <HI>revenge Injuries.</HI> Now the more fit Souldiers are for these Services, so much the more valiant and able they are to be accounted. Note also, Souldiers are either <HI>Rulers,</HI> or <HI>Ruled, Comman∣ders,</HI> or <HI>Private Souldiers.</HI> Now first,</P>
<P N="1">1. As to <HI>Private Souldiers,</HI> they may be said to be valiant and able, when they have these following Qualifications. Namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When they are strong and able of Body to go through hard, difficult Services.</HI> Men are not fit for Souldiers, unless they are sit to endure <HI>hard∣ness,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2 3. Souldiers are often call'd to
<PB N="9" REF="000958_0008_0FADE3F02E782228"/>
Encounter with Storms and Tempests, wet &amp; dry, hot and cold, with hunger and thirst: they are sometimes called to frequent Watch∣ings, long marches, to pass Hills and Dales, craggy Mountains, and deep Rivers, suddenly to Intrench, to build Forts, to scale Walls, and other such like Services, which contain more difficulty in them, than can be easily conceived of. Men had need have strong hardy Bodies, to undergo such <HI>Fatigues.</HI> Softness &amp; delicacy does not become Souldiers, 'tis a disgrace to a Camp. The Souldiers of <HI>Alexander</HI> in a fit of discontent, complained that they were forced to <HI>Fight not only against multitudes of Enemies, but also against Mountains and Rivers. Ateas the Scythian King</HI> gave a great Commend of his Souldiers, when he said to <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Mace∣don, Your Souldiers can fight with men, but mine can fight with hunger, thirst, and such like difficul∣ties.</HI> Souldiers therefore should shun all In∣temperance. <HI>Every man that striveth for the mastery, is temperate in all things.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.25. <HI>Scipio</HI> wept when he came into the Camp, and saw the <HI>Licentiousness, Luxury and Intemperance there prevailing.</HI> When <HI>Alexander</HI> had Conque∣red Kingdoms by his <HI>Grecian</HI> hardiness, he was himself Conquered by <HI>Persian</HI> Softness and De¦bauchery.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When they have valorous couragious spirits.</HI> When they have hearts big enough to attempt
<PB N="10" REF="000958_0009_0FADE3F147B80748"/>
hazardous things, to give a bold and vigorous (though dangerous) <HI>repulse</HI> or <HI>onset.</HI> A Souldi∣ers strength of body wont signifie much, unless he has courage of mind to manage it: without courage, his strength is almost useless in War, unless it be like an <HI>Horse</HI> or a <HI>Camel</HI> to bear and carry burdens. When the <HI>Israelites</HI> were going to War against their enemies, the <HI>Priests</HI> were to say unto them, <HI>Let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrifyed be∣cause of them,</HI> Deut. 20.3. And why should not Gods Priests or Ministers, so incourage Souldiers now? As for faint hearted Souldiers, they were to be dismissed and sent home, least by their cowardly example, the hearts of others should faint also, <HI>Deut.</HI> 20.8. Men dont deserve the honourable title of Souldiers, if they have not the resolute Spirit of Souldiers. If they want courage, a <HI>Plough</HI> or <HI>Spade,</HI> becomes them better than a <HI>Shield</HI> or <HI>Sword.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>When they are well skill'd and accurate in the use of their weapons.</HI> Strength of body and cou∣rage of mind, may sometimes prove useless, yea <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for want of Military skill. What sig∣nifies <HI>Shield</HI> or <HI>Spear, Gun</HI> or <HI>Sword,</HI> unless men know how to use them? <HI>David</HI> upon due con∣sideration▪ chose rather <HI>nakedly</HI> to approach his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, than being furnished with that gallant armour which he had not proved, 1 <HI>Sam</HI> 17.30. For a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to wear a Sword, that knows not
<PB N="11" REF="000958_0010_0FADE3F285861000"/>
how to use it, seems as idle and foolish, as for a Child to boast of a Book, which he cannot read a word in. Souldiers should also know the words of Command, that they may readily ap∣prehend the mind of their Commanders in them, and speedily yield obedience thereunto. So should they understand the <HI>beat of the Drum,</HI> and the <HI>sound of the Trumpet</HI>: otherwise they can't distinguish between a <HI>Charge</HI> and a <HI>Retreat,</HI> and then what follows, but confusion instead of order, and overthrow instead of victory? If these things are not understood, who shall pre∣pare himself for the battel, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.7, 8. Those were highly commended that were <HI>expert</HI> in War, <HI>that had all manner of Instruments of War for the battel, and were men that could keep rank,</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.33, 37, 38. They were well train'd and disciplin'd.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When they are obedient to their Commander.</HI> 'Twas the commendation of those Souldiers, <HI>Matth.</HI> 8.9. <HI>That they went and came, at their Commanders bidding.</HI> And truely without this qualification, Souldiers don't deserve to be com∣mended: 'tis not their business to dispute and capitulate <HI>with,</HI> but yield obedience <HI>to,</HI> their Of∣ficers. When <HI>Roman</HI> Souldiers were <HI>Pressed,</HI> each took his Oath, not to forsake his <HI>Captain</HI> or <HI>Country,</HI> which Oath was called, <HI>Sacramentum Militare. Obtemperaturas sum et facturus quicquid mandabitur ab Impreratoribus, juxta vires</HI>; to the
<PB N="12" REF="000958_0011_0FADE3F2D7218240"/>
utmost of my power, I will obey thy Command∣er in all things. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was wont to say, <HI>'Tis better for a Souldier to fear his Captain, than his enemies. Paulus Aemylius</HI> would say, a Souldier should take care of three things, <HI>That he has a strong body good arms,</HI> and a <HI>mind ready to obey.</HI> When a Souldier was once just ready to smite his enemy with his Sword, he forbore upon the Sounding of a <HI>Retreat,</HI> and being asked by one, why he suffered his enemy to escape, he ans∣wered, <HI>'Twas better to obey his Emperor, than slay his Enemy.</HI> He's not a good Souldier, that knows not how to obey his Commander. I suppose those who have these forementioned qualifi∣cations, may well pass for valiant, able Souldiers.</P>
<P>We may further note, that the more <HI>Pious</HI> persons be, so much the better Souldiers they commonly are. Those who will Curse and Swear, as though they would Damn their ene∣mies into Hell, are sometimes backward enough to look an enemy in the face, much more to smite him to the ground. <HI>Iphicrates</HI> spake like a brutish Heathen, when he said, <HI>A Souldier ought to be coveteous of riches and pleasures that he may the more boldly incounter dangers for the satisfying of his lusts</HI>: It better becomes Christians to say, <HI>Souldi∣ers should be pious and gracious, that so they may the more boldly incounter dangers for the answer of a good Conscience.</HI> Never were there better, bolder, and more couragious Souldiers in the world, than
<PB N="13" REF="000958_0012_0FADE3F3A04BFD78"/>
some of the holiest of men have been. 'Tis mentioned as an eminent commendable effect of <HI>Faith</HI> in some, <HI>That they waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the Aliens, Heb.</HI> 11.34. As <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Tears</HI> are the weapons of the Church, so men most expert at those wea∣pons are most commonly the best Souldiers.</P>
<P>Having spoke these few things of <HI>private Souldiers,</HI> we may now proceed to the other part of the distribution, <HI>viz Officers</HI> or <HI>Commanders,</HI> among whom there are various orders or de∣grees one above another: yet excepting the Chief Supream Commander, who as such, is not to receive &amp; obey, but to give out <HI>Commands,</HI> unto his army; I suppose they are all the more worthy to be accounted valiant, able Souldiers, by how much the more they have, of all the forementioned qualifications. If their hardy bodies will indure uncomfortable lodgings, mean diet, wet &amp; dry, heat &amp; cold, tedious marches, and great fatigues, this might animate their Souldiers to do so too. Commanders should have singular Courage also, according to the Station they are in, they should have enough for themselves, and some to spare to their Souldiers too; that is by way of Ex∣ample and Exhortation. We must not look for great Exploits to be done by that Com∣pany that has a cowardly Captain. A faint hearted <HI>Leader,</HI> will rather encourage the
<PB N="14" REF="000958_0013_0FADE3F45FFA3FB0"/>
feet of his Souldiers to flee, than their hearts or hands to fight. They should have good Skill likewise. 'Tis to be supposed, that every Officer according to his place, be it high or low; is able to Instruct all under him, in their duty, otherwise how can he give proper words of Command, or punish Offenders for not obey∣ing them? You know what is like to become of blind guides and their followers. As for the Obedience of Inferiour Officers, to those that are Superiour; 'tis as needful and commenda∣ble, as the Obedience of any Private Souldiers. Besides these Qualifications, it seems very desi∣rable, that Commanders, especially the chief of them should be,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Men of great Prudence and Conduct.</HI> Great Prudence and Conduct is needful for the orde∣ring of Marches, especially through difficult passages, for the ordering of <HI>Scouts</HI> to discover <HI>Ambushments,</HI> and prevent sudden Surprizal, for Entrenching and Fortifying in commodi∣ous places, for securing of <HI>Stores,</HI> for choosing time and place for battle, and such like things of great weight.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Men well acquainted with their Souldiers, and Under Officers.</HI> This is needful, that so they may chuse and order, for such and such Services, men that are most proper for the same. <HI>Joab</HI> chose the <HI>choice men of Israel for the most difficult Service,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.9. This he
<PB N="15" REF="000958_0014_0FADE3F51213D690"/>
could not have done, but that he knew his Army well.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Men of great Sagacity, Circumspection, Watchfulness and Diligence.</HI> Men that will have not only a careful watchful eye, over all the Affairs of their own Army, but such as will use all proper means to get Intelligence, about the <HI>Number, Skill, Courage, Preparation, Designs,</HI> &amp; <HI>Motions</HI> of the Enemy. The knowledge of these things, gives great advantage on many accounts.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Men of great patience.</HI> Souldiers often meet with such hard lodging, hard fare, with such losses, disappointments and difficulties, that they sometimes begin to murmur against, and find fault with, their Officers, and all their ma∣nagements▪ tho' never so prudent. Thus <HI>Davids</HI> men murmured against him, and talked of sto∣ning him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 30.6. Possibly good pru∣dence and patience, might divert such Storms, which if not diverted, would hurry all into confusion.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Men of resolution to punish Delinquents.</HI> They should forbid all Impiety and Prophane∣ness, Intemperance and Debauchery, Injustice, and Dishonesty; and if such Crimes are com∣mitted, they should see them punished. The <HI>Romans</HI> were wont to punish their delinquent Souldiers, sometimes by <HI>Disbanding of them with disgrace,</HI> sometimes by <HI>with-holding their Wages,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="000958_0015_0FADE3F60F5F12E8"/>
sometimes by <HI>diminishing their food,</HI> sometimes by <HI>beating and cudgelling them</HI>▪ sometimes by <HI>ba∣nishment,</HI> and sometimes by <HI>death. Lamachus</HI> said, <HI>Non licet in bello bis peccare, error enim in bello est mors.</HI> Men must not offend twice in War, for an Error in War is death. Souldiers will not be kept in order, without good Laws, and them well Executed.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Men that are Godly and Conscientious.</HI> 'Tis recorded to the endless praise of <HI>Cornelius,</HI> Cap∣tain of the <HI>Italian</HI> Band, <HI>Acts</HI> 10.2. <HI>That he was a devout man that feared God with all his house, and prayed to him always.</HI> Surely such men are sitter for Commanders, than those who by their prophaneness and debauchery, seem to fight more daringly against God in heaven, than a∣gainst men on earth. How shall we think those will be faithful to their Countrey, and the Cause of it, who will not be faithful to God and his Cause? <HI>Constantius,</HI> the Father of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, removed those professed Christians from being his Courtiers, whom (upon a designed trial) he found more ready to Sacrifice to Idols, than to disobey his Com∣mands, saying, <HI>those who are disloyal to God, will never be true and trusty to their Prince.</HI> How often▪ have Commanders of weak, depraved Consciences, <HI>received bribes, Sold their Army▪ Cause, Countrey and all,</HI> only for their own pre¦sent personal <HI>Preferment, Profit,</HI> and <HI>Pleasure?</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="000958_0016_0FADE3F68EA90D40"/>
Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> said to King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, to this purpose, while <HI>God damn me,</HI> leads the <HI>Van,</HI> and the <HI>Devil take me,</HI> brings up the Rear, there's no likelihood of good success. There's no reason to expect the success of Armies, un∣less Gods presence and blessing be with them: there's no reason to expect his presence and blessing with them, if he is greatly provoked by them, and so he will be by Christian Ar∣mies, if their Commanders are not conscienti∣ous. When <HI>Moses</HI> the chief Commander of <HI>Israel</HI> was praying, then <HI>Joshua</HI> and the Army did prevail. We may now proceed to the se∣cond Enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>How does it appear that such Souldi∣ers among Gods People are a great Blessing to them, and are justly to be accounted so?</HI> In order to an Answer, we need only premise, that a well settled peace, is a great Blessing to Gods peo∣ple. When they have such a peace, their <HI>Persons, Civil and Religious Liberties,</HI> and also their <HI>Estates</HI> are safe. They may sleep safely in their Houses, follow their business without fear or danger, sit quietly under their Vines and Figtrees, freely make use of their own; and which is more than this, they may Serve and Worship God, in obeying all his Com∣mands, and attending on all the Institutions of the Lord Jesus Christ, without disturbance or molestation. Thus it is with Gods people,
<PB N="18" REF="000958_0017_0FADE3F907851C20"/>
who are favoured with a well established Go∣vernment, and a well settled peace. That such a state of Affairs is a great Blessing, will be owned by every thinking Christian; espe∣cially if he considers, that <HI>Peace</HI> is promised as a very comprehensive mercy, in case of Obedi∣ence, and War threatned, as a very compre∣hensive Judgment, in case of Disobedience. <HI>Lev</HI> 26.5, 6, 17, <HI>verses.</HI></P>
<P>We may now answer the Enquiry in say∣ing, such Valiant Souldiers as have been descri∣bed, are very proper means under God.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To continue unto God's People, their Liberties and Properties when quietly Enjoyed.</HI> If Gods people have plenty and prosperity, yet if their envious Neighbours know them to be well fur∣nished with valiant, able Souldiers, they will not much care to molest them. <HI>When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his Goods are in peace. David</HI> with his experienced Souldiers, did mighty Exploits in War, and when he dyed, he left the Land full of able Souldiers, which being known, the Neighbouring Nations dare not disturb <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son, but he <HI>had peace on all sides round about him, and Judah and Israel dwelt safely; every man under his vine and under his figtree</HI> 1 <HI>King</HI>▪ 4.24, 25. But if a people have peace and plenty, without suitable men to defend them, they seem to be an inviting prey to their covetous Neighbours.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="19" REF="000958_0018_0FADE621636003D8"/>2. <HI>Able Souldiers are proper means to recover the Liberties and Properties of Gods People, when taken away.</HI> This was frequently experienced by the Israelites, as we are often told in the Book of <HI>Judges.</HI> The Jews experienced this truth also, as the History of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> plainly informs us. Many other instances might be given were it needful.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Able Souldiers are very proper means to se∣cure the Liberties and Properties (as well as the Lives) of Gods people, when they are indangered.</HI> Able Souldiers are very proper means, to <HI>prop up,</HI> and <HI>steady</HI> a shaking, tottering State. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was much oppressed and further endangered, when the <HI>Philistines</HI> did prevail, win the Victo∣ry, Slay <HI>Saul</HI> and his Sons in Battle; but <HI>David</HI> and his experienced Souldiers, did soon give check to their rage, suppress their power, curb their Insolency, and secure <HI>Israel</HI> from their Outrages. Many Instances of this nature might be given, yea, several in our own Nati∣on. <HI>England</HI> was much threatned, yea by some look'd upon as a devoted Sacrifice, when the <HI>Spanish</HI> (vainly called <HI>Invincible) Armado</HI> came against it an hundred and twelve years ago, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>; yet the brave <HI>English</HI> Souldiers, by the Blessing of God, rout∣ed their Enemies, destroying many of them▪ and hunting others home, as heavy laden with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> before they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with envy

and to secure them when endangered. Yea, since the first planting of this Country by the <HI>English,</HI> our Souldiers have been made a Bles∣sing to God's people here on all these ac∣counts. This is too well known to need a∣ny proof.</P>
<P>Now these things might teach us;</P>
<P><HI>That God's People ought to Train up and encou∣rage, good able Souldiers.</HI> 'Tis true, those happy days are promised and much hoped for, where∣in, <HI>Men shall beat their Swords into Plowshares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks: Nation shall not lift up a Sword against▪ Nation, neither shall they learn War any more,</HI> Mic. 4.3. But those days are not yet come, and possibly before they do come, there will be occasion to urge those other words, <HI>Joel</HI> 3.9, 10. <HI>Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up: beat your Plowshares into Swords, and your Pruning hooks into Spears, let the weak say I am strong</HI> Those are carnal men, who say, Christians should not use <HI>carnal Weapons:</HI> That is, Instruments of War, when the cause of God and his People require the Warlike imployment of them. Christ's Church upon earth is yet <HI>Militant,</HI> in a proper and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as well as in a Spiritual sense. Christians have great reason to learn War, and make War∣like preparations. I suppose all the Lord's Batttels are not yet fought; and we don't know who
<PB N="22" REF="000958_0021_0FADE6231D3F59B8"/>
of us may be call'd to ingage in some of those that remain. Be Exhorted then to learn War, to indeavour after Military skill, a martial spirit, an ability to do Service against Enemies; if the cause of God and his people should call you to it. To incourage you here unto,</P>
<P>Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The necessity of it, in an ordinary course of Providence.</HI> The present condition of the world, and wickedness of men, is such, that we cannot be secure of any thing we have, un∣less we have some force and power, as well as justice on our side. It has been often seen, that under God, Souldiers have been the defence and protection of what God's People do injoy▪ If you have no Warlike force, your wealth and riches will be but an inviting, easy prey, to in∣vading Enemies. Intreaties will not do with those whose tender mercies are cruelty. The force of enemies, must be repel'd with force. Would you have your Country spoiled, your Houses rifled and burnt, your Goods and Riches taken away, your Children dasht against the stones, your Wives and Daughters ravish'd be∣fore your faces, your Women with Child ript open, your Aged Fathers and Mothers barba∣rously dragg'd about the Streets, your Churches overthrown, your selves Captived, Inslaved, or contemptuously slain? If you would avoid such Indignities, Insolencies, and out rages as these
<PB N="23" REF="000958_0022_0FADE623DEDA1240"/>
are (which are frequently perpetrated by an Invading Enemy) then learn War; indeavour after Military skill and courage, to repell the pride and power of enemies. A few well dis∣ciplin'd Souldiers, are commonly of more use and worth, than vast multitudes of untrained men. <HI>Abraham</HI> with three hundred and eigh∣teen <HI>Trained</HI> Servants, overcame four Kings and their Armies, <HI>Gen.</HI> 14. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, with between thirty and forty thousand well disciplin'd Souldiers, routed the unskilfull un∣trained multitude of <HI>Darius,</HI> which consisted, some say of four hundred, some of six hundred thousand men.</P>
<P>Consider,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The eminent examples set before you.</HI> Some of the best of men, have been the best of Souldi∣ers: They have attempted, and done great things in War, for the cause of God and his people. Such were <HI>Abraham, Joshua, David,</HI> the <HI>Maccabees, Constantine</HI> the great; and <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> and Emperor of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> who lived about nine hundred years ago. And not to mention any more, you might be encouraged by the Example of <HI>Our Great KING WILLIAM,</HI> a great enemy to Vice and Wick∣edness, a great and singular friend to, and en∣courager of, Vertue and Holiness; and yet ge∣nerally and most deservedly accounted, as mighty a man of War, as any the World has seen for many Ages.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="24" REF="000958_0023_0FADE624C72B9240"/>3. <HI>Great Commendations are given in Scripture, of Warlike accomplishments, and Warlike actions.</HI> 'Tis spoke to the commendation of some that came to help <HI>David: They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left, in hurling stones, and shooting arrows out of a Bow.</HI> 'Tis said of others, <HI>They were men of might, and men of war, fit for the Battel, that could handle Shield and Buckler, whose faces were like the faces of Lyons, and were as swift as the Roes upon the Mountains,</HI> 1 Chron. 12.2, 8. The heart of in∣spired <HI>Deborah,</HI> was towards <HI>the Governours of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the People.</HI> 'Twas spoke to the praise of <HI>Zebulun and Naphtali, That they Jeoparded their lives to the death, in the high places of the field</HI> Judg. 5.9.18.</P>
<P>Consider,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>God is very angry with those who will not venture their lives in fighting against his E∣nemies.</HI> As you may see, <HI>Judg.</HI> 5.23. <HI>Curse ye Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z, said the Angel of the Lord, Curse ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof, because they came not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mighty.</HI> Here's a bitter Curse upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>habitants of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because they would not venture their lives, in fighting for God's people, and against their Enemies. So <HI>Jer</HI> 48.10. <HI>Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully, and cursed be he that holdeth back
<PB N="25" REF="000958_0024_0FADE625E427DC00"/>
his Sword from Blood.</HI> We should not be cow∣ardly Neuters, or idle Spectators, when the common cause of our Lord Jesus Christ calls for our assistance. We should love him above our lives, and therefore be willing to indanger and expose our lives, when his and his peoples Interest calls for it. <HI>We ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren.</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.16. The Lord Jesus Christ, takes our neglect of, or disregard to his people, as a neglect of, or disregard un∣to himself. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.45, Surely since he has dyed for our Salvation, we should be willing (his Providence calling us to it) to die for his Glory. And great shall be our reward, if we have such a willingness, and our actions are agreeable thereunto. <HI>Titus</HI> the <HI>Roman General,</HI> to incourage his Souldiers in fighting against <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> said, <HI>The Soul of him that dies in War, is presently received into the most pure, airy Element, and from thence carried and placed among the stares of Heaven.</HI> He had no reason to say this, but we have good reason to say, those that sincerely love, fight, and die for, the true Interest of Jesus Christ, shall immediately at death, have their Souls taken above the Stars of Heaven, to be with Christ in Glory. <HI>Those that suffer with him, shall reign with him, but if we deny him, he will deny us.</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.12. Let these few con∣siderations animate you to learn War, to en∣deavour
<PB N="26" REF="000958_0025_0FADE6264E2FBAA8"/>
after Military Skill, Courage, and other Martial Accomplishments: that if Pro∣vidence should call you forth, you may be qualified to do real Service, in defending the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of Gods peo∣ple, in recovering their damages, or revenging unjust Indignities and Outrages committed a∣gainst them. In all your <HI>Artilleries</HI> and <HI>Train∣ings,</HI> you should act like Christians. You must give an account to Christ, of your acti∣ons on Training Dayes, as well as on other dayes. On such dayes therefore you should Conscientiously Serve Christ, by diligently endeavouring after more knowledge, skill, and accuracy in Military Matters, that you may imploy the same, in real Service for Christ and his People, if Providence should call for it.</P>
<P>As for you Gentlemen of the Honourable <HI>Artillery Company</HI>; I wish you may go on, be encouraged and prosper, in those great and generous qualifications, you aspire after. I wish your <HI>Number,</HI> your <HI>Skill,</HI> your <HI>Courage,</HI> with all other desireable Military accomplish∣ments and honours, may be increased. But let none of us so much aspire after being Souldiers, as to forget that we are Christians. If we had the greatest and most desirable Warlike accomplishments and preparations that could be, yet we ought not to trust in them
<PB N="27" REF="000958_0026_0FADE626D4239808"/>
for our defence or protection. <HI>Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm,</HI> Jer. 17 5. We should make the best pre∣parations, and use the best means we can, in all affairs; but we must not have our dependance on any of them, but on God alone. The best means often fail; therefore the <HI>Wise man must not glory in his wisdom, nor the strong man in his strength. The race is not to the swift, nor the battel to the strong,</HI> Eccles. 9.11. Let us use means, but not trust in them. Let us take up with <HI>Sauls</HI> advice, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18.17. <HI>Be valiant, and fight the Lords Battels.</HI> And with that of <HI>Joab,</HI> 2 Sam. 10.12. <HI>Be of good courage and let us play the men, for our people and for the Cities of our God: and the Lord do that which seemeth him good.</HI> An Excellent Speech of a <HI>General</HI> it was; to exhort to the doing of our best, and yet trusting in God, and leaving the event with him. He is a Man of War, <HI>Exod.</HI> 15.3. He teacheth to War, <HI>Psal.</HI> 144.1. He Spirits men to it, <HI>Jer.</HI> 51.11. He helps in War, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32.8. The victory is his, he gives it to whom he will; for he can save by many or by few. We should therefore use the best means we can, and have our whole dependence upon God.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="000958_0027_0FADE627B95A6B38"/>I shall conclude in saying, There is another Warfare, which every one of us should be in∣gaged in. We should get ingrafted into CHRIST, listed under his Banner, resolv∣ing by the help of his Grace, to fight against the World, the Flesh, and the Devil: to fight the good fight of Faith, till we lay hold on Eternal Life: to be stedfast, unmovea∣ble, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as we know our labour shall not he in vain in the Lord.</P>
