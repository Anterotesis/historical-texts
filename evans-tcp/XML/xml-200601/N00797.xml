<P>SƲCH is the fulness of Sufficiency in Christ, that no words can enough ex∣press it: for which reason the Holy Scriptures set him forth under the shadow of many <HI>Metaphors,</HI> which require a Spiritual improvement; all of which put together make up but a dark &amp; deficient description of him: and yet every one of them Commends him to us as an Object worthy of our Love &amp; Trust, inasmuch as they represent him one every way furnished to answer all our wants, which can no where else be supplied; and, but for whom we must needs have pe∣rished in them. The following Sermons set him forth as a <HI>Fountain,</HI> and such an one as is <HI>Opened</HI> to miserable men, together with those Vertues which do more eminently flow from him as such, for the abundant supply of all those that partake in him: and withall it gives us the comfortable notice of a more pe∣culiar &amp; glorious <HI>Revelation</HI> and <HI>Applica∣tion</HI> of it, to be made in these last days.

If thou hast known, what it is to be in a dry and thirsty land, where no Water is, this will be good News to thee. If thou hungrest and thirstest after Righteousness, this will give thee direction. If thou hast ever tasted that he is gracious, thou wilt here find Re∣freshment. If thou art at a loss about the dark Providences which are upon the Christi∣an World, thou wilt here find matter of en∣couragment, in prospect of the better Times wherein this Fountain will be wonderfully exhibited.</P>
<P>Touching the Sermon that is subjoyned to this short Treatise, I need not to apologize for the Seasonableness of Publishing it, unto such as understand the <HI>Genius</HI> of the Age we live in.

<P><HI>ZEchariah</HI> was one of those Extraor∣dinary Prophets whom God raised up and sent to the <HI>Jews,</HI> after their return from <HI>Babylon.</HI> He was con∣temporary with <HI>Haggai,</HI> and began his Ministry about two months later, in the Reign of that <HI>Darius</HI> who encouraged and set forward the building of the <HI>Temple;</HI> to the pursuit of which affair, these two Prophets did joyntly stir up and animate the People of God. Who this <HI>Zechariah</HI> was, and to what Tribe and Family he belonged, we are at a loss, his Genealogy being only reckoned up to his
<PB N="2" REF="000960_0005_0FADE3FD5ED9C420"/>
Grandfather, of whose Stock there is no men∣tion made elsewhere in the Old Testament: only this I suppose is beyond just dispute, that he is the same whom these Jews did barba∣rously murder, for his faithful reproofs given them, and denouncing of Gods Righteous Threatnings against them for their sins; which added to their guilt, and is articled against their Posterity by Christ himself, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.35. This Book is partly <HI>Doctrinal,</HI> partly <HI>Vision∣al.</HI> In the Visional part of it he gives an ac∣count of all the Changes or Revolutions which were to pass over the <HI>Jewish Nation,</HI> till, for their sins, and more particularly, for their de∣spising of Christ, and the Salvation by him offered to them, they should be <HI>laid desolate</HI>; and so abide, till such time as God should a∣gain graciously call them: and there are inter∣woven the Predictions of the Judgments of God on other Nations, so far as they concern∣ed his dealings with this people. Divers of these <HI>Visions</HI> are exceeding mysterious, and the harder to be understood by us, not only be∣cause of the depth of the <HI>Allegories</HI> used, and the intermixing of things fore signified by way of anticipation; but also because they are not as yet accomplished: And here we are more especially to observe those Prophesies which point to the Calling of the <HI>Jews</HI> to Christ, and the Spiritual Glory of that time, which is more than once hinted at in this
<PB N="3" REF="000960_0006_0FADE3FE2C1917D0"/>
Book: as also the Calling of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and the wonderful enlarging of the Grace of God to other Nations. To make the way clear to the words of our <HI>Text,</HI> let us observe, that at the beginning of <HI>Chap.</HI> 12. Our Prophet pre∣dicts an happy and glorious Estate which God will in due time restore <HI>Jerusalem</HI> unto, and he indigita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es a special appointed season in which this should eminently be accomplished: and therefore it is once and again called, <HI>That Day,</HI> as it were with an <HI>Asterism</HI> set upon it. To what day, or article of time this Prophesie particularly points, is matter of debate, as also whether the <HI>Jewish Nation,</HI> and literal <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> be at all aimed at in it. That Gospel Times are pointed to, is very evident by seve∣ral passages which might be observed in the <HI>Context:</HI> or the time af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er which Christ had been put to death by this people: and that some notable gracious dispensat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on towards Gods ancient people is aimed at nextly therein, is, I am perswaded, without doubt; though others also may be comprized in it. Some Expositors, not only re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er; but restrain it to those notable Conversions of the <HI>Jews</HI> on the Preaching of the Apostles, which are recorded in, <HI>Acts</HI> 2 <HI>&amp;</HI> 4. But though there may be accounted then to have been a <HI>Specimen,</HI> or an earnest of it, yet the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty expressions that are here used about it, and al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the ex∣tensiveness of the work mentioned, say that
<PB N="4" REF="000960_0007_0FADE3FECE972F08"/>
there hath not as yet been a full performance of it, but that it is to be waited for, when that General Calling in of the <HI>Jews</HI> shall Com∣mence, of which we have a satisfying account in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. In <HI>Chap.</HI> 12.10. God, by the Prophet, tells us how he will prepare his peo∣ple for such great favours, <HI>viz</HI> he will bring them to a true and cordial <HI>mourning</HI> for the affronts which they had offered to the Lord Jesus Christ, in crucifying of him; and that both universal and particular: and thereupon he proceeds to enumerate several spiritual be∣nefits which shall ensue; the first whereof that is mentioned, is this in our <HI>Text,</HI> and it is a very comprehensive one. The words then are a gracious New-Covenant Promise, of a singular benefit to be bestowed on the Church of God in Gospel Times, and upon every true penitent in it; and particularly on the <HI>Jews,</HI> when he shall come to call them home to him∣self. In them we may observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. The benefit it self which is promised: <HI>A Fountain.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The singular mercy that should be disco∣vered in regard of this benefit, <HI>it shall be Opened.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Subjects to whom this benefit should be applied; <HI>to the House of David, and to the Inhabitants of Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The design of it, or that wherein the

<P N="5">5. The time when this should be, <HI>in that Day.</HI></P>
<P>Give me leave to make a brief paraphrase on this sweet <HI>Text,</HI> which comprehends in it the summe and substance of all Gospel Grace. <HI>In that day] i. e.</HI> The day which is once and again mentioned in the foregoing <HI>Chapter.</HI> The day wherein God will <HI>return to Zion, and have mercy upon her, and build up her waste places.</HI> It is true, this benefit hath belonged to the true Church of God, ever since the Promise of the <HI>Seed of the Woman</HI> was m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de; but there are special times wherein there are more eminent manifestations of Divine favours to the peo∣ple of God, which God would have remarked by them: and so this hath a respect to that happy time which is expected by the Church of God when <HI>all Israel shall be saved.</HI> But that which I would more peculiarly observe, for our own improvement is, it is the day wherein the <HI>Spirit of mourning and Supplication</HI> shall be <HI>poured</HI> upon them; when God shall bring them to true sorrow for Sin, and peni∣tent addresses unto him for peace and pardon: and so it shews the order and way of Gods communicating of this great favour to them. <HI>There shall be a Fountain</HI>] The word, <HI>fountain</HI> cometh of a root that signifies, <HI>to dig for a spring of water</HI>; and in one Conjugation, <HI>to
<PB N="6" REF="000960_0009_0FADE4035157FCB8"/>
flow over abundantly</HI>: and doubtless, Christ himself, in respect of his blood, or obedience and me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, is intended by it; as will after∣wards be observed. <HI>Opened</HI>] A thing is said to be opened, that was before shut or covered; the word is also used for the making of a thing manifest, which was before hidden, or not known, we therefore read of the opening of waters, the opening of treasures, or the unlock∣ing of them, the opening of doors; and a noun from this root, signifieth, a <HI>door.</HI> In summe, a thing is then opened, when it is ex∣posed, and laid before persons, and they have the free liberty given them to come and make use of it. We are not here told who will o∣pen it, but it must needs in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd a work of the Spirit of God, who is the revealer and applier of Christ and his benefits unto men. <HI>To the House of David, and to the Inhabitants of Jerusa∣lem</HI>] By these we may understand those that are the people of God, the seed of Christ, for he is the true <HI>David,</HI> and the Members of the Mystical Body of Christ, for these are <HI>the Inhabitants of Jerusalem.</HI> It may also intend all ranks of men: the <HI>House of David,</HI> may have respect to the Rulers and Nobles, &amp; the <HI>Inhabitants of Jerusalem,</HI> to the meaner sort. <HI>For Sin, and for Uncleanness</HI>] The word, <HI>Sin,</HI> signifies any <HI>Error,</HI> or turning out of the right way: The word <HI>Uncleanness,</HI> properly signifies something that is <HI>removed,</HI> and is used in the
<PB N="7" REF="000960_0010_0FADE406D3F02FE0"/>
<HI>Levetical Law,</HI> for such things are were separa∣ted, by reason of Ceremonial pollution, and might not be touched. When he saith this <HI>fountain is for sin, and for uncleanness,</HI> he intends that it is designed for the taking of them a∣way, and this is done both in <HI>Justification</HI> and in <HI>Sanctification,</HI> as will afterward be observed. And under these two words are comprehended all sorts and degrees of sin: the least errour stands in need of it; and the greatest Pollution may be cleansed by it.</P>
<P>There are several precious truths contained in this portion of Scripture, which I shall make some remarks upon.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE I. That Jesus Christ is a Fountain of saving Good.</HEAD>
<P>WHat is nextly intended by this fountain, Commentators do variously guess; some apply it to the Grace of God, some to the Holy Ghost, some to the Gospel it self▪ and some to Baptism, or to both of the Sacra∣ments of the New Testament. But all agree that it ultimately refers to Christ, as he in whom all that Grace which is provided for the relief of sinful man, is treasured up as in a fountain, according to, <HI>Col</HI> 1.19. <HI>It pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell</HI> This then is one of the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ious <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>les</HI> of Christ; &amp;
<PB N="8" REF="000960_0011_0FADE40733A55810"/>
it is <HI>Metaphorical</HI> or allusive, pointing us to the consideration of an earthly thing, and such as is well known, for our help in the contempla∣tion of him, and the great benefit that accru∣eth by him to his people. In the clearing up of this Doctrine, three things may be inquired into, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In what respect Christ is a fountain?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What is that saving good that is fountained in him?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>How he comes to be such a fountain?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In what respect Christ is a fountain?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The word, <HI>fountain,</HI> may be considered in a double sense; either only as a <HI>Metaphor,</HI> alluding to the repository in which waters are contained, and from which they issue; or else with the addition of a <HI>Metonymie,</HI> with respect unto the waters that are contained in it; and both these are applicable to the <HI>Text</HI>: The former of these belongs to this enquiry, and the latter to the next. As then a fountain is a repository which God hath, in the work of Creation, provided for the treasuring up of waters in, so is Christ a Store-house of all Grace, in whom it is laid up. And there are several respects in which he is thus compared to a fountain, and hath this Title put upon him; more especially,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A fountain is so called from the Plenty of wa∣ters that are in it.</HI> There is a great fulness in a Fountain. Cisterns have but a little in them;
<PB N="9" REF="000960_0012_0FADE407D709C808"/>
small Springs, that are but little veins in the earth, do vent but a little water, because they have not much in them; but a fountain hath abundance in it, it is a vast treasury; there is no want in a fountain, but there may come as many as will to it, and have a full supply of water from it; and such a fountain of Grace is Jesus Christ to his people; for this reason is he said to <HI>be full of Grace and Truth, Joh.</HI> 1.14. And all the people of God are said to receive out of <HI>his Fulness,</HI> verse 16. and because of this abounding sufficiency of his, those that fear him are said <HI>to have no want of any good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, Psal</HI> 34.9. And believers are said to receive <HI>abundance of grace</HI> from him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.17. Hence we are told in <HI>Isa.</HI> 33.21. <HI>The glo∣rious Lord will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A fountain is so called from the Quality of the waters in it.</HI> The waters of a fountain are very much different from those that are in a pool or cistern; and there are two titles that are put upon them in this regard.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are called living waters.</HI> Hence we have such allusive expressions, <HI>Cant.</HI> 4 15. <HI>A Well of living waters Rev.</HI> 7 17. <HI>And shall lead them to living fountains of water.</HI> Not that they properly have a principle of life, or a living Soul in them (for they are not in the order of <HI>Animates</HI>) but <HI>Metaphorically,</HI> in that they have something resembling life▪
<PB N="10" REF="000960_0013_0FADE40894FDEE90"/>
because they run, and overflow, and purge themselves, and have a continual motion. As also from the efficacy of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, because they are salubrious, and very serviceable for the pre∣servation of the life of the Creature. Thus is Christ in respect of his Graces c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed to a fountain, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.13 <HI>Ye have forsaken me the fountain of living waters,</HI> and the Graces which he communicates from himself to such as come unto him, have that <HI>Epithet</HI> given to them, be∣cause they do revive, or give and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> life to them who partake in them; see for this, <HI>Joh.</HI> 4 10. <HI>He would have given thee living water</HI>; and 7.38. <HI>He that believeth in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water</HI>; and on this account the Psalmist asc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibes that to him, Psal. 36.9. <HI>With thee is the fountain of life.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They are called clear and pure waters.</HI> And this follows from the former; for being living, they purge themselves, and always keep clean; A Cistern, or pond, or Well, are apt to gather filth by standing, and to grow corrupt, and to be often disturbed; but a Fountain is clean and pure. Accordingly we have the Spirit of God, in allusion to this, describing the fountain of Grace which God hath provided for his Church, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.1. <HI>He shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal.</HI> Such is Christ, and such are all his be∣nefits; they are holy, and there is no defile∣ment in them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="000960_0014_0FADE40963976F58"/>3. <HI>A fountain is so called from the Diffusiveness of its waters.</HI> The waters in a Well, or a Pond, are shut up, and they move not; but are confined to one place; they are standing: but a fountain is ever running over its banks, and spreading it self far and near, imparting of it self in its streams. Hence we so often read of <HI>running waters</HI> in the Scriptures. Such also is Christ in respect of his Grace. We have an <HI>Allegorical</HI> description given of this in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 47. <HI>begin.</HI> in those waters of the Sanctu∣ary, which <HI>ran from the south side of the Altar,</HI> and encreased as they went along; which point to that we are now considering of. A foun∣tain may be conveyed in streams to many pla∣ces, for the supply of such as want it: and Christ conveys his Grace here and there; and there is never a street in the City of God but is abundantly refreshed with it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A fountain is so called from the Perennity of it.</HI> The waters in a Cistern or pool, waste with using, and may be emptied in time, if constantly repaired to, yea and the waters in them will dry up by degrees; but a fountain is ever full, and hath a fresh supply coming in, as fast as any is drawn out of it, or conveyed from it: if ten thousand should come to it, they may fill all their vess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls, and yet there is no want, nor any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing, but ten thousand more may come after them, and have equal supply. Such is Christ in respect to his Grace;
<PB N="12" REF="000960_0015_0FADE40A1385C1C8"/>
hence all that are a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are invited to him; <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1. <HI>Ho, every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat thirsteth come to the waters;</HI> and we are bidden to enlarge our vessels, and yet we shall be replenished, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81.9. <HI>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it</HI>; and God hath assured us, <HI>Isa.</HI> 45.19. <HI>I said not to the Seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What is that saving good that is fountained in him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We observed, that a fountain is properly a receptacle of waters, and therefore is Meto∣nymically put for the waters themselves that are in it; and we may here keep to the allu∣sion. Water is one of those things that are necessary for the life of man, and afford a ma∣nifold benefit unto it; it quencheth the thirst, it revives the spirits, it comforts the man, it cools and refresheth the body, it is of use also for cleansing or purifying both the body, and such things as are for its use and comfort: and indeed such is the usefulness of this Element, that the want of it makes the man miserable, and if he be not supplied with it, he will un∣avoidably perish. It is therefore reckoned for a singular advantage and happiness to dwell near a fountain of water▪ as <HI>Isa</HI> 33.16 <HI>His waters shall be sure</HI>; and Chap. 32.20. <HI>Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters.</HI> Now that which is here alluded to in this comparison is whatsoever benefit derives from Christ to the Souls of men, for the helping them to obtain
<PB N="13" REF="000960_0016_0FADE40B0118AF78"/>
Eternal Life. These waters comprehend un∣der them, <HI>Grace, and Glory, and every good thing, Psal.</HI> 84.11. peculiarly the Graces of his Spirit are here pointed to, and therefore we have such an expression in, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.16. <HI>Of his fulness we have all received, and grace for grace.</HI> The benefit of which is excellent, and manifold: without it we must needs perish; from and by it derives to us all that is necessary or desira∣ble. There is pardon of Sin, peace with God, Sonship, Sanctification, and Consolation: the most comprehensive of which will be particu∣larly considered of under a following Doctrine. But it is certain that all these are laid up in Christ, and flow from him to his People, as waters do out of a fountain; and are no where else to be had.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>How he came to be such a fountain?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This flows from his Mediator-ship, and may be traced in these four particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Mans Apostasy had cut him off from God as the fountain of life to him.</HI> All mans happiness is fountained in God, and must derive from him by way of participation. He was at first, in his state of Integrity, planted by this fountain, had free access to it, and could refresh himself at all times with it; the streams of it ran down freely on him: but when he sinned a∣gainst God, that made a woful separation, so God tells them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.2. <HI>Your sins have separa∣ted between you and your God</HI>; and since then,
<PB N="14" REF="000960_0017_0FADE40D4B4D3FE0"/>
that is a proper title of sinful men in their na∣tural state, <HI>Psal</HI> 73 27. <HI>They that are far from thee.</HI> God is no longer his portion; of a friend he is become his enemy; all those Glo∣rious Attributes which when for him, would have filled him with satisfaction, are now ar∣med against him, and become a terror to him, being ready to destroy him: and if this be not retrieved he cannot escape perdition.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Gods free Grace constituted Christ in the Of∣fice of a Mediator, that he might procure life and happiness again for man.</HI> Sin had brought man under the Guilt of Death, binding him over to suffer eternal vengeance. Gods Justice was now engaged to execute an holy revenge up∣on him, for the affront which he had offered to his Law. This Justice must be satisfied; man can no more approach to God but by a Mediator, for without one, <HI>God is a consuming fire.</HI> God graciously resolves to bring some of that unhappy race back again to himself, and be a fountain of life unto them, and herein to manifest his rich Grace; for this end he ap∣pointed his own Son to become man, and in our nature to bring about an Atonement, by reconciling God and man one to another and procuring a Redemption for us; for this he put Christ into his Office, and indented with him in the Days of Eternity: <HI>the counsel of peace</HI> is therefore said to be <HI>between them both, Zech.</HI> 6.13.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="000960_0018_0FADE40E70BE2258"/>3 <HI>Christ, by his satisfactory Obedience, purcha∣sed and laid in all that was needful for the Salva∣tion of man.</HI> Had not God put him into Of∣fice, and Commissioned him for this, all his Obedience had been insignificant: for, not only or meerly the value, but the Acceptance of it for us, made it a purchase: and yet had it not been valuable, it would not have done, because Justice and Mercy could not otherwise have agreed in our Salvation, as they must, Psal 85.10. <HI>Mercy and Truth are met together, Justice and Peace have kissed each other.</HI> But Christ bought us at a valuable price, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.12. <HI>Ye are bought with a Price</HI>; and because his death was more eminently concerned in this, hence it is peculiarly Attributed to his Blood, 1 <HI>Pet</HI> 1.18, 19. <HI>Ye are Redeemed,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>with the precious blood of Christ;</HI> and as he bought us out of the hand of Revenging Justice, so he bought all that Inheritance for us, in which our whole happiness is contained, which is called the <HI>purchased Possession.

<P><HI>USE I.</HI> For <HI>Information</HI> in two or three particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Learn we hence the happiness of all those that have gotten an interest in Christ.</HI> All the <HI>Titles</HI> that are put upon him in the Word of God, are to commend to us some excellent benefit that flows from him to those that participate in him. Now, as Christ's Office is to convey saving mercies to us, so herein he ap∣pears glorious, in that they are all stored in him as in a fountain, and that he therefore is a fountain of them. How rich then are all they who are owners of this fountain, that dwell with him? Such are all true believers: these can never want; all that they can need is in him; and there is enough and to spare: this may turn <HI>the valley of Baca into a well, Psal</HI> 84.6. Christ himself hath told us what is the priviledge of those that believe in him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 7.38 <HI>Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water</HI>; and hence the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is such blessed¦ness pronounced on believers, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.8. <HI>He
<PB N="17" REF="000960_0020_0FADE40F5376AA80"/>
shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and sprea∣deth out her root by the river,</HI> &amp;c. Rejoyce then in this your lot, and envy not the world their broken cisterns, though they seem to be never so full.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Here is good news to those thirsty Souls, that have sought for living waters, and found none else∣where.</HI> When God awakens the Consciences of Sinners, and shews them something of the misery which they labour of, they are inquisi∣tive where they may get a remedy; and they seek it at home and abroad, they <HI>go from hill to mountain</HI> in quest of it; they have gone to every pit, hoping to draw waters to refresh their Souls out of it, but they have come away empty and ashamed, and may possibly be rea∣dy to sit down and despair of ever finding a∣ny that will quench their thirst, and refresh their Souls: but be of good cheer, here is a true report made of a fountain of such waters as you need; there is none in the world, nor is there any in your own power: but there is enough in Christ; he is an infinite and inex∣haustible fountain of it; and if there was no more to be said, yet here is encouragement to hope: if there were none at all, your case were then desperate; but if it be any where, and there be enough of it too, think then, I will not abandon hope, for <HI>who knows</HI> but that he may shew me the favour, to give me to drink of these waters of life.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="000960_0021_0FADE410155837D8"/>3. <HI>This may answer their doubt who are afraid to come to Christ, by reason of the greatness of their sin &amp; misery.</HI> When deep convictions of these do make them, instead of making the greater haste to Christ, to discourage themselves there∣by from daring at all to come to him, their <HI>sins are too great to be forgiven</HI> them, their hearts are so hard, that there is no softning of them, their debts are run up to <HI>ten thousand Talents,</HI> they have gone beyond the ordinary sort of Sinners; and sure there is no help in Christ for such as they are: Look now, he is a foun∣tain, yea he is an immense and an incompre∣hensible fountain, whatsoever you want or can desire is to be supplied out of it to the utmost extent of your cravings, yea, indeed he came for that very end, <HI>that where sin hath abounded, Grace might much more abound; Rom.</HI> 5 20. And is therefore furnished accordingly. Hence,</P>
<P><HI>USE II. Let it be to exhort and direct mise∣rable Sinners; and such are all the Children of men in their natural estate, &amp; till they are gotten into Christ, and interested in his Redemption.</HI> Be you then pointed hereby to come to Christ for all your supplies; make him your object, and ad∣dress your selves to him. Many arguments might here be used to press this advice; but I shall only offer two or three which are fetch∣ed from the Doctrine in hand.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You must have a supply or you will perish.</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="000960_0022_0FADE410DCC45970"/>
There is no living in the condition you are at present in; if you sit still you dy unavoidably; your famishing Souls must have something to live upon, and that can be nothing else but these <HI>living waters,</HI> or you will faint and dy. The whole Word of God will assure you of your woful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>felicity, which as long as you abide in your natural state, you labour of, and are perishing in: if therefore there be no sup∣ply to be had, you will sink under this distress, and be undone for ever; and surely such a thought as this, if duly meditated upon, can∣not but stir you up to enquire, and make you restless in seeking where and how you may obtain the supply, by which you may escape the woful misery which is upon you.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>You will be miserably disappointed if you go any whither else for it.</HI> You will have many solicitours, who will say to you, <HI>Turn in hither,</HI> and will promise you fair; but all is a cheat; believe them not; if you will not be misera∣bly disappointed. If you seek to the world, there is not one drop of the waters of life to be found in it, it hath nothing but poysoned waters, which, however they may please your carnal appetites, will not satisfie an immortal Soul. The Worlds Cup may in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oxicate you, but it will never slack your thirst; mans mise∣ry began in his turning to it, <HI>Jer</HI> 2.13. <HI>They have dug to themselves broken cisterns thar can hold no water.</HI> If you seek it in your own
<PB N="20" REF="000960_0023_0FADE411977DBBA0"/>
Righteousness, and take much pains in quest of it by that course, it will deceive you; God expostulates thus with all that will not come to these waters, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.2. <HI>Wherefore do ye spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which satisfieth not?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is enough in Christ to answer all your wants.</HI> Let them be never so many, or never so great, yet know it that fountain hath an immense fulness in it, and can never be drawn dry: Millions of Souls have been satisfied at it, and it is still as full as ever, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.20. <HI>He is a∣ble to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think</HI>: All other waters will dry up, but these never will, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.11. <HI>Thou shalt be like a watered Garden, and like a spring of waters, whose waters fail not.</HI> The Psalmist therefore pre∣sumes on this, <HI>Psal.</HI> 36.8. <HI>Thou shalt make them to drink of the River of thy Pleasures.</HI></P>
<P>And for your Direction.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be affected with your own Necessity.</HI> The reason why this fountain is no more repaired unto, why Jesus Christ is so greatly neglected by the Children of men, is not because they have no need of him, but because they do not rightly resent their need. Were you in the case of those poor <HI>Lepers that sat in the gate of Samaria,</HI> of whom you read, in 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 7 <HI>begin.</HI> or of the poor <HI>Prodigal</HI> in his far Countrey, where he was ready to famish, <HI>Luke</HI> 15. You would soon bestir your selves. Consider then what Sin
<PB N="21" REF="000960_0024_0FADE41313E8F450"/>
hath made you; take the Word of God, and believe it, and there read what a forlorn con∣dition you are in, starving, fainting, dying.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Renounce all trust in broken cisterns, and seek to him alone for Supply.</HI> As long as you look elsewhere, he will not hear you; we are told, in <HI>Jon.</HI> 2.6. <HI>They that embrace lying vanities, for∣sake their own mercies.</HI> And accordingly we are acquainted how it shall be, when God comes to be the portion of the Soul, <HI>Hos.</HI> 14.8. <HI>Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with Idols?</HI> And hence we are directed to come with a declared rejection of other ob∣jects, <HI>verse</HI> 2, 3. <HI>Ashur shall not save,</HI> &amp;c. And one would think your own experience, how often you have been defetaed in seeking to them, were enough to make you thus to do.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Plead his ability, or sufficiency.</HI> Believe it, and let it be your encouragement, and make use of it in your petitions; argue with your selves, as the Prodigal did, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.17. <HI>In my fathers house is enough and to spare, and I perish</HI>; and let it make you to <HI>arise,</HI> and when you come, tell him, your thirsty Souls are ready to expire, and you can find nothing to refresh them; that he hath enough with him, and that he can afford it to you, and how it will be for the glory of his Grace thus to do, when he shall so save a perishing Soul, and make it a monument of his mercy and power to all Eternity.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="22" REF="000960_0025_0FADE41425836C90"/>4. <HI>Now resign your selves up to his mercy.</HI> Re∣solve that because you have found all the pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the World empty, and that here is a full fountain, able to supply you, you will go no whither else, but wait for the communication of grace to you; acknowledging of his Supre¦macy, adventuring on his mercy; and beg of him his Grace to establish this purpose in you; and fear not: this <HI>Fountain</HI> will <HI>open</HI> unto you: which is the next thing.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE. II. Jesus Christ is an Opened fountain in the days of the Gospel.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Prophet is speaking of, and predict∣ing about Gospel times, and tells us, that <HI>in that day there shall be a fountain Opened.</HI> Un∣der the former Doctrine we had Christ com∣mended to us as a fountain of saving good, whose fulness of all Grace and Goodness may invite the poor and needy Soul to repair to him, to have all its wants supplied: In this we have a farther commendation given him by the <HI>Epithet</HI> added, <HI>viz.</HI> That he is a Fountain Opened, which mightily adds to the encourage∣ment of indigent ones to come to him. Un∣der the former <HI>Metaphor</HI> he was exhibited as an <HI>All sufficient</HI> Saviour, and by this he is set forth as a free, ready and <HI>willing</HI> Saviour; that shews what he is in himself; this tells us what
<PB N="23" REF="000960_0026_0FADE4172BD9F7A8"/>
he is willing to be to us, if we would so make use of him.</P>
<P>In pursuit of this Doctrine we may enquire,</P>
<P N="1">1. What is included in the opening of this Fountain?</P>
<P N="2">2. How it comes to be thus opened?</P>
<P N="3">3. In what respect it is said to be opened in the days of the Gospel?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What is included in the opening of this Fountain?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Opening and shutting are contraries; and when it is opened, it supposeth that before it was shut: either it was not known, or it was inaccessible. There is therefore a double opening of this fountain which is here intend∣ed, <HI>viz</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By</HI> Revelation, <HI>or Discovery.</HI> A thing that is hidden or secret, is said to be shut, but when it is published or made known, then it is opened; and it is to be observed, that the dis∣covery of this fountain is by <HI>Revelation</HI>: all the wisdom and understanding of Angels and men, which they had in them by nature, could never have found this out; natures light afforded not a key to unlock this mystery: When it lay in the Cabinet of God's Eternal Counsel, it was a sealed thing, &amp; there was no meer Creature that could open it; but God hath made known this glorious fountain, and set it forth manifestly before us. Now the things which God hath opened to us by it, are;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there is such a fountain provided for
<PB N="24" REF="000960_0027_0FADE418145D3220"/>
mans use.</HI> God had fore-appointed it in the days of Eternity, and made it ready in the fulness of time; but these things were in them∣selves secret, nor had man ever known that there is such a supply laid in for him, if God had not told him of it. Gods counsel about it was in his own breast, and the way in which he effected it was so obscure, that man understood it not till he declared it. Who should tell man that God had so much good will for him, as to provide Salvation for him by a Redeemer, when he had destroyed himself by sin? God only knew his own thoughts, and none could have gues'd at them by any rational arguings, if he had not told them. When God saith concerning the sinful creature, as <HI>Job</HI> 33.24. <HI>Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransome.</HI> He then opens this Fountain.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Where it is; and this is a further degree of the opening of it.</HI> There is some support affor∣ded to us, in being told that there is such a thing; but then the proper enquiry will be, Where is it? Except we be determined about our Object, we are still at a loss: but God hath pointed us here also, and told us who is the fountain, <HI>viz. Jesus Christ.</HI> He hath assu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> us where it is not, and given us the chara∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r of all the <HI>broken cisterns</HI> that we are ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take up at, and told us where only the wa∣ters of life are to be had. Notwithstanding all the predictions which had been of Christ be∣fore,
<PB N="25" REF="000960_0028_0FADE41864019EF0"/>
yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> came he was not known; the World were prejudiced at him, yea and his own were at a loss about him; <HI>Isa.</HI> 52.14. <HI>As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men</HI>; and 53.2. <HI>He hath no form or comeliness, and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him</HI>: And <HI>Luke</HI> 24 21. <HI>We trusted that it had been he that should have redeemed Israel.</HI> He hath therefore pointed out the very person, and given us the characters in his Word whereby he may be known, and assured us that all Salvation is li∣mited to him, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. <HI>Neither is there Sal∣vation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The fulness of sufficiency which there is in this fountain, and how he came by it.</HI> He hath declared all the vertues of it, and the efficacy there is in them: how Jesus Christ came to be a compleat Saviour, and <HI>able to save to the uttermost, Heb.</HI> 7.25. He is for this end laid forth in his Natures, in his Offices, and the whole work of Redemption which was wrought out by him; in the Covenant En∣gagements which there past between his Fa∣ther and him; and in the suitableness of what he hath done and undergone, for the answering of all that was requisite in order to our Salvation, and the acceptance which
<PB N="26" REF="000960_0029_0FADE4191FFCB0B0"/>
it found with the Father on this account. These were dark and dubious things to the wi∣sest of men, but he hath opened them clea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly to us; 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 1.23▪ 24 <HI>We preach Christ Cruci∣fied, to the Jews a stumbling bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, and to the Greeks foolishness, but to them which are called, Christ the wisdom of God and the power of God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>The way wherein we may come at, and par∣take in this fountain</HI> We must c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to it, if ever we obtain life from i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; hence that c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣plaint, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5 40 <HI>Ye will not come to me, that you might have life</HI> There is therefore a way in which we may so come, and this mans rea∣son and light could not have given him any direction about: it is therefore a great piece of the natural mans misery, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3 17 <HI>The way of peace have they not known</HI> This God hath opened to us in the New Covenant, by publishing the terms of it, <HI>viz</HI> Faith and Re∣pentance, and shewing us the fallacy of all the other ways which vain men have taken to ob∣tain it, and miss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the end; <HI>Mic</HI> 6.8 <HI>He hath shewn thee, O man, what is good</HI> Now the way in which God hath discovered all this is in the Gospel, and by the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinances of it, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1 10 <HI>Hath brought life and immortality to light by the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel.</HI> So that men need no longer to be at a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, nor <HI>wander from mountain to hill, seeking rest and finding none.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By the Offers that are made of it, and the invitations given to men to come to it, whereby
<PB N="27" REF="000960_0030_0FADE419D38CDA30"/>
they have a freedom of access.</HI> A thing is then said to be shut up, when it is enclosed, and there is no liberty of coming at it; when therefore it is exhibited and laid open, and all encouragement is offered to repair to it, it is then opened: so is this Fountain.</P>
<P>Here let us observe.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That God, together with discovering it, ma∣keth large and universal offers of it to men.</HI> He not only ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h told us that there is such a thing, but hath invited men to come to it; hath told them what it is designed for, and bidden eve∣ry one that hears of it, and is sensible of his own need, to come to it and partake of it, the offer of it is universal, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1. <HI>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come to the waters</HI>; he excep∣teth none that are willing to come; nay, he hath put in to prevent discouragement in such as may be afraid by reason of aggravated sin and guilt, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.18. <HI>Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow</HI> 55.7. <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and turn to the Lord, for he will have mercy, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>He sends his Ambassadours to plead with men, &amp; that with all urgency, that they will come to it.</HI> He enjoyns them to use all arguments with men, to shew them their absolute need of it, that they must needs perish without it; to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g and pray them to accept of the Recon∣ciliation; and to follow them from time to
<PB N="28" REF="000960_0031_0FADE41AAAE14B80"/>
time with utmost importunity, according to, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.20. <HI>We are Ambassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christs stead be ye reconciled to God.</HI> Nor are they to be discouraged in the work, but to re∣new the Treaty though sinful men do all they can to break it off.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>He makes the largest Promises to such as do come.</HI> How welcome he will make them, how readily he will entertain them, and that notwithstanding all they have been and done to provoke him to deal contrary with them; they shall not lose their labour, but have full satisfaction given them, <HI>Mat</HI> 11.28. <HI>Come un∣to me,</HI> &amp;c <HI>and I will give you rest, Rev.</HI> 3.20. <HI>I will come in, and sup with him, and he with me</HI>; and he hath said, <HI>that he will never cast them out, Joh.</HI> 6.37.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How it comes to be thus opened?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We may come at this in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This fountain was provided on purpose for the Salvation of undone Sinners.</HI> It was for the ad∣vancement of the riches of his Grace that God contrived it before time; and it was because sin had made man to stand in absolute need of it that God revealed it to him in time, hence that <HI>Rom</HI> 5 6. <HI>When we were without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly; Gal.</HI> 4.4. <HI>When the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son,</HI> &amp;c. Had not man plunged himself into mi∣sery,
<PB N="29" REF="000960_0032_0FADE41B79E35DD0"/>
and helplessness in himself, or in the whole Creation, there had been no occasion for it. Hence we have Christ himself decla∣ring the design of his coming in our nature, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9 13. <HI>I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance</HI>; and our Prophet ac∣quaints us what the Blood of the Covenant was for, <HI>Zech.</HI> 9.11. <HI>By the Blood of thy Cove∣nant, I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit, where there is no water</HI>; and that <HI>blood</HI> was no other than what our Text and Doctrine call a <HI>fountain.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Sinners may obtain Salvation by it; they must partake in it.</HI> There must not only be a remedy suitable and sufficient provided, but there must be an application made of it, if ever the Creatures misery be removed by it. Let there be never so full a fountain, never so much plenty of living waters, yet if the man do not drink of them, his thirsty Soul will not be satisfied therewith, but he must perish for all. It is not enough that there is a Christ who is able to give eternal life, who is able to save to the uttermost, but we must have him if we live by him, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.12. <HI>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life</HI>: Except the man drink of these waters they will never profit him; what else is the reason why so many perish, tho there be enough in Christ to save the whole world? Christ himself hath told us a reason
<PB N="30" REF="000960_0033_0FADE41CF77FAC10"/>
of it in regard of such as live under the Gos∣pel, <HI>viz. they will not come to him that they may have life, Joh.</HI> 5.40. For it is by participati∣on in it, that the vertue of Christ's Redempti∣on becomes ours.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is by being united to Christ by faith that they come to partake in him.</HI> Union with Christ is the foundation of Communion with him, and faith is the bond of that Union on our part: he must dwell in us, in order to his communicating of his saving benefits to us, and how that is we are told, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.17. <HI>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.</HI> Hence the Apostle propounds that solemn case, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. <HI>Know you not your own selves, how that Christ is in you, except ye are reprobates?</HI> It is by faith that we receive Christ; unbelief shuts him out, and so hinders us of all saving good by him; if we believe not in him, we shall never receive the waters of life from him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That they may thus believe in him, they must have him Opened to them.</HI> Faith is the act of a reasonable creature, and so it must have a ground for it, <HI>Paul</HI> can say. <HI>I know whom I have trusted,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 1.12 Hence,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He must be opened by</HI> Revelation. There must be a discovery made of him to and in the Soul, by which it may be certified of his fulness and suitableness; that he is able to an∣swer the Souls wants, and to supply its needs, to fill its cravings, and remedy its miseries:
<PB N="31" REF="000960_0034_0FADE41DA2803EB0"/>
what else should move it to adventure its all upon him? it is therefore said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 9.10. <HI>They that know thy name will put their trust in thee</HI>; and in <HI>Rom</HI> 10.14. <HI>How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He must also be Opened by</HI> Encouragement.

<P N="5">5. That he might accommodate this to their nature;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He hath revealed these truths to men extra∣ordinarily inspired.</HI> As they are to come to us by Revelation, so God chose such to whom he would make it; and by whom he would communicate it to others; and on this ac∣count we read, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1 21. <HI>Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,</HI> and 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 3.16. <HI>All Scripture is given by inspira∣tion of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He hath recorded them in his written Word.</HI> In that he hath commended his mind to us,
<PB N="32" REF="000960_0035_0FADE41E50B47958"/>
and hath bidden us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Search the Scriptures,</HI> as we h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe <HI>to have Eternal Life,</HI> and hath given us this reason why we should thus do, <HI>because they testifie of him, Joh.</HI> 5.39. And it is evi∣dent, that wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>soever God would have to be known concerning Christ, and the way to life by him, in this life, is recorded in the Scriptures, and there are we to seek for it, and no where else.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>He hath appointed the Ordinances of the Gospel in which these truths are to be dispensed.</HI> He hath instituted the Preaching of the Gos∣pel, and sent his Ambassadors Commissioned by him for this very end, and that is the great business which they are to intend, and nothing else but what is in subordina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion to this, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2▪2. <HI>I determined to know nothing among you, but Jesus Christ, and him Crucified</HI>; and how doth <HI>Paul</HI> glory in this, <HI>Eph</HI> 3.8. <HI>Unto me, who am less than the least of all Saints, is this grace given that</HI> I <HI>should preach among the Gen∣til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the unsearchable riches of Christ.</HI> They are to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clare this fountain, and to commend it unto men, and pray them to come to it; and thus it stands open for all that will repair to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In what respect it is said to be opened in the days of the Gospel?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A</HI> We are by the days of the Gospel to understand all that time from Christ's having appeared in the Flesh, and accomplished the
<PB N="33" REF="000960_0036_0FADE41F5C2BEDE8"/>
work of Redemption, till the day of Judg¦ment: which is called the <HI>Gospel day,</HI> in oppo∣sition to the times of the dispensation of the Law of <HI>Moses</HI>: else it is certain that it hath been a Gospel day, ever since the Revelation which was made to our First Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts, <HI>of the womans seed breaking the head of the Serpent, Gen.</HI> 3.15. And here we may observe three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is clear from the Word of God, that this fountain was opened to man, before Christ came in our Flesh.</HI> There was a way of Salvation dis∣covered unto man, presently after he had un∣done himself by sin; and there were a great many saved by the vertue of this fountain in the times of the Law: there were then holy men, who were the <HI>Friends of God, men after his own heart,</HI> men that <HI>trusted in him, and waited for his Salvation.</HI> There were Prophe∣sies and Predictions about Christ from the be∣ginning, and those that then believed on him as their <HI>Redeemer, they saw his day and were glad,</HI> they prayed in his name, they had an eye to him in all the Types and Figures which were of him: for that was a truth from the beginning, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any other.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There was a peculiar opening of it after such time as Christ had wrought out the work ef Redemption for us.</HI> The word of God is wont to make mention of things as if they were
<PB N="34" REF="000960_0037_0FADE41FCE30C830"/>
new, when there is a new manner of the Dispensation of them, or when there are very eminent degrees of the manifestati∣on of them unto men: Now, with respect to the opening of this fountain, it was thus after Christ had finished the great affair of satisfying the Justice of God for us, and went to his glory; and that in two regards;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In respect to the Clearness of the discovery.</HI> Those manifestations which were made of Christ under the Law, were very obscure; almost all that was there spoken about him, was under <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Figures,</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies.</HI> Every thing then had a vail upon it, and few were able to see through it; and so they were exceeding ready to tarry at and take up with the shadows instead of the substance; and by that Law, which was given to be a <HI>School-master</HI> to lead them <HI>to Christ,</HI> to fortify themselves against him and his Righteousness, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.2, 3. <HI>They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, for being ignorant of Gods Righteousness, and going about to establish their own Righteousness, they have not submitted to the Righteousness of God.</HI> So that this foun∣tain was then in a great measure covered, but now it is discovered gloriously, and every thing concerning Christ and Salvation by him is spoken plainly; 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 3.18 <HI>We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image, from glory to glory.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In respect to the Extent of the offer that is
<PB N="35" REF="000960_0038_0FADE422D02AEE68"/>
made of it.</HI> Before the Gospel times, Christ was in some respects a <HI>fountain shut up▪ and seal∣ed</HI>; he was opened only to the Nation of the Jews, and such as were Proselyted to them; and that also obscurely: the <HI>Law of Ordinan∣ces</HI> was a <HI>partition wall</HI> between the Jews and other people, so that this was their peculiar pri∣viledge and prerogative; <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.2. <HI>To them were committed the Oracles of God; Chap.</HI> 9.4.5. <HI>Who are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, &amp; the Glory, &amp; the Covenants, &amp; the giving of the Law,</HI> &amp;c. And hence we have that of Christ himself, in <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.22. <HI>Salvation is of the Jews.</HI> Hence the Gospel was to be <HI>first offer∣ed to them,</HI> and on their rejecting it, to be <HI>carried to the Gentiles. Acts</HI> 13.46. But now the partition wall is pulled down, the Law of Ordinances is removed, and there is a way opened for others to come to him, and have peace in him, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.14, 15. <HI>He is our peace, hav∣ing made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us,</HI> &amp;c. Christ there∣fore, when he was to ascend to Heaven, Com∣missioned his Apostles <HI>to go into all the world, and Preach the Gospel to every Creature, Mark</HI> 16.15. The Apostle therefore tells us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.18. <HI>Their sound went into all the earth, and their words into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the world.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is yet a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> opening of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eserved for the day when the Jews shall be called.</HI> There is such a Calling to be expected; there
<PB N="36" REF="000960_0039_0FADE423FAB06618"/>
are Prophesies in the Word of God concern∣ing some <HI>Articles</HI> in the Gospel day, which have not as yet been fulfilled, according to the stately predictions about them; and this we wait for till God shall bring that Nation back to himself. The Gentiles were very great Gainers by the <HI>cutting off of the Jews,</HI> but they shall be far greater by the <HI>graffting of them in again, Rom.</HI> 11.15. Then <HI>shall the knowledge of God cover the earth</HI>; then shall <HI>Christ reign gloriously among his Ancients</HI>; then shall his Kingdom be wondrously exalted; then shall that have an eminent accomplish∣ment, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 55.6. <HI>When God bringeth back the Captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoyce, and Israel shall be glad.</HI> But this will be more insisted on in a following Observation.</P>
<P><HI>USE I. For Information in two particulars</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Learn hence what reason we have to bless God that we live in times and places of Gospel light.</HI> Out of doubt the great advantage of sinful men is to have Christ made known to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. The Apostasy had brought us all into a wilderness, <HI>a dry and thirsty land wherein there was no water:</HI> and had not this fountain been broken up to us, we must needs have perished. Had we lived in the days of the Law? if we had then been of the Nation of <HI>Israel,</HI> it had been a great priviledge, and a singular favour: however, they were dark
<PB N="37" REF="000960_0040_0FADE425736E61C0"/>
times then compared with ours; but if we had been born of and among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> we had been shut out from that Garden in which this fountain was made to spring up. It is prophesied concerning the Gentiles, with what resentments they shall receive the Gospel, <HI>Jer.</HI> 16.19. <HI>The Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit</HI>: How far then is our condition better than theirs was? let us then be thankful to God, that the <HI>Wells of Salvati∣on</HI> are opened to us, and we may <HI>draw waters out of them</HI>; that Christ is preached and offe∣red to us, and we are invited to come to him to have our thirsty Souls satisfied; that these rivers run before our doors: this is not the priviledge of all the world at this day. Think then how highly we are favoured hereby, and let God have the whole glory of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This tells us how justly and inexcusably they will perish, who come not to this fountain.</HI> It is certain that all men in their natural state, are in a perishing condition, being cut off from the fountain of living waters; there is no re∣covering of it again, and li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by it, but in and by Christ, in whom it is stored. Mans ruine had been just if this had never been opened to him; God ows not to the Fallen creature any hope, nor any provision for its recovery: But if, when God hath not only prepared such
<PB N="38" REF="000960_0041_0FADE425D06D4AB0"/>
a remedy, but hath also opened it in the Gos∣pel, wooed men with all earnestness to come to, and accept of it, used all eadeavours with them to perswade them to embrace it; and yet they refuse to hearken to his calls, to ac∣cept of his offers, put him away from them, when he comes to them, will not leave their <HI>broken cisterns</HI> for this <HI>fountain of living waters</HI>; there remains no more hope for these, because there is never another fountain at which their Souls can find refreshment: they despise Christ, forsake him, will none of him, and this makes their perdition inevitable, <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.13. <HI>They that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in of living waters</HI>; and how righte∣ous a th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they should thus suffer?</P>
<P><HI>USE II. Let it be to encourage thirsty Souls to come unto Christ for all they want.</HI> God is wont, in order to his revealing of Christ to, and in Sinners, to awaken in them a deep sense of their misery, and to bring them into sore distress: they are made to feel themselves perishing in themselves, and thereupon their craving Souls are inquisitive whether there be no help to be had for them. Are you then brought into such a strait as this is, let the following advice be acceptable to you.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let your felt want put you upon asking after him.</HI> Before you were under the impression
<PB N="39" REF="000960_0042_0FADE426926AAD08"/>
of these Convictions, you saw no need that you had of him, and that made you to be so far from seeking after him, that when he came and offered himself to you, and bad you to accept of him, you put him away from you, and bad him be gone, made it evident that you had no desire of him; but now let your enquiry be how you may come at him. Your Wells in which you before put your trust, are now sensibly dried up, and afford you no supply at all, ask then after this foun∣tain. Let this be your support under your present distress, that you have heard of such an one, and now make it your business to en∣quire how you may be made to partake in it, how you may get a full draught of these <HI>li∣ving waters.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let this fulness of sufficiency be your directi∣on to go to him and no where else.</HI> Every one that would partake in this benefit, and not fail of this Grace of God, must resolve to forsake all the streams which before they took up withal, for the sake of the fountain; and the prime motive to this, is the apprehension they have of the emptiness of every thing else, and his infinite fulness. Receive then the witness that is born of him in his word, and see how worthy he is of your trust, <HI>who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, Eph.</HI> 3.20. Say, I have tried other objects, and they have failed me, but I
<PB N="40" REF="000960_0043_0FADE42752518F58"/>
have heard that there is enough for me in him; I will therefore go to him, and him only for supply.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let his being opened be your encouragement to prevail with you to come to him, and believe on him.</HI> And indeed, here is that which next∣ly animates poor thirsty Souls to come to him. It is true, if he were not a fountain of Grace, he could not answer our necessity, and make us happy; our cravings can be filled with no∣thing that is less; but still, if this fountain were shut up and sealed, and there were no way discoverable by which we might come at it, the other consideration would afford a poor support to our hope. Goodness indeed is the object of our <HI>desire,</HI> but it is the com∣municableness of this goodness which nextly excites our <HI>hope,</HI> and that is it which must car∣ry us forth vigorously in quest of it: and the more fully this way of participation is mani∣fested to us, and the more freely it is offered in the exhibition of it, the greater must the encouragement needs be. Here therefore is the great demur that sensible Souls are wont to make, <HI>viz.</HI> Is there any way for me to be made a partaker in all this good whereof there is such an abundance in the fountain?</P>
<P>Consider then;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This fountain was provided on purpose for such as you are.</HI> It was Mans miserable ne∣cessity that was the occasion of the providing
<PB N="41" REF="000960_0044_0FADE4280E1CABC0"/>
it; and but for that, it had never been heard of; we are told who are to be made sharers in the benefits of Christ, <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.12, 13 <HI>He shall deliver the needy when he crieth: the poor al∣so, and him that hath no helper; he shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the Souls of the needy</HI> Observe what was the very design of his being anointed, and you will find that was for such as you, <HI>Isa.</HI> 61. <HI>begin.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>He stands open before you in the offer of the Gospel and Ordinances.</HI> There is an offer made of him there to some, and who are they but such whose condition is that which you com∣plain of? the offer indeed is general, and hath no exception put into it, as to the persons who hear it, provided they comply with the terms propounded. You are not exempted; why then should you exempt your selves? the Invitation saith, <HI>Whosoever will, let him come and take of the waters of life freely, Rev·</HI> 22.17. The greatest Sinners are not excluded from, but included in it; <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return a∣gain to me, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is a special and peculiar invitation gi∣ven to all such as you.</HI> Sensible Sinners, distres∣sed Souls, such as are pinched with thirst, and under a feeling of their want; <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1. <HI>Eve∣ry one that thirsteth,</HI> Mat. 11.28. <HI>All you that are weary and heavy laden.</HI> That which you make your discouragement, and seek to hinder
<PB N="42" REF="000960_0045_0FADE42B0FA2FDA0"/>
your selves by, is the very argument of his invitation, <HI>viz.</HI> because you are in distress, and despair of finding succour elsewhere; and concerning such, if they do come upon the call, there are gracious promises of a kind entertainment. How precious a word is that? <HI>Isa.</HI> 41.17. <HI>When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>If you stand off by unbelief and despair, you will grieve his Holy Spirit.</HI> And well he may be grieved. For you to say, there is no hope for such a vile sinful Wretch as I am, is to make him a liar; who again, and again hath told you that his Salvation is laid in for such, and assures you that Sinners must be brought to this sense in order to the application of it.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Know it, that if you now come to him, he will make you very welcome.</HI> He never cast out any comer, nay, when he did but see the poor Prodigal resolving, and arising to go to his Father, you are told how he carried to him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.20. <HI>When he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion on him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an, and fell on his neck and kissed him.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The more unworthy you are, the more will his grace be exalted in you.</HI> Proud, insensible Sinners may and do abuse: b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t such as you will rightly improve that preci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s word, <HI>Rom.</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="000960_0046_0FADE42C2B61CDF0"/>
5.20. <HI>Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound</HI>; if you take heart by it, and betake your selves to him. Come away then to the fountain, and drink your fill of it.</P>
<P>For Direction,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Come now, whiles it stands open, it will not do so always.</HI> He saith, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.2. <HI>Now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation:</HI> Take heed of delays, they will prove your undoing, if you be not careful, read <HI>Luke</HI> 13.25. <HI>When once the Master of the house is risen up, and hath shut the door,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Come as you are, for the fountain is free.</HI> Say not, how shall I purchase these waters of life? You are invited to them <HI>without money or price, Isa.</HI> 55.1. If you have but a thirsty Soul after his Righteousness, you are suitably qualified, and have that gracious encourage∣ment given you, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.6. <HI>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Come to have all your wants supplied here.</HI> Bring them all with you, and cast them upon him; resolve that here is enough, and you shall be satisfied, be not doubting but be∣lieve, and rely on his word who hath said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81.10. <HI>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE III. They are the Seed of Christ, and the Church of God, for whose sakes this fountain is opened.</HEAD>
<P>THE Subjects of this priviledge are the <HI>House of David, and the Inhabitants of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erusalem.</HI> These are <HI>Typical</HI> Expressions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is a spiritual meaning that is to be sought in them, though the <HI>literal</HI> meaning is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot to be excluded; and here is a double <HI>Type,</HI> tho' the thing aimed at in it is one and the same. How far this shall be literally accomplished in bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the parts of it, when the Nation of the <HI>Jews</HI> shall be Converted to the Christian Religion, I shall not enquire now, but con∣fine my present discourse to the Mystical and Spiritual meaning of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>David</HI> was a <HI>Type</HI> of Christ; and in how many things Christ was repre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ented by him, would be too great a digression now to enq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire: but it is certain, that by a frequent Scripture <HI>Metonymie, Christ the Antitype,</HI> is called by the name of <HI>David the Type, Jer</HI> 30.9. <HI>They shall serve the Lord their God, and David their King, whom I will raise up to them. Ezek.</HI> 34 23. <HI>I will set up one Shepherd over them, and he shall lead them, even my Servant David.</HI> and elsewhere. And there are many things spoken in the <HI>Psalms</HI> concern∣ing <HI>David,</HI> that can be properly applied to
<PB N="45" REF="000960_0048_0FADE42DC743D148"/>
none but Christ. By the <HI>House of David,</HI> we may literally understand his natural Posterity, or those that descended from him by Natural Generation, so the word, <HI>House,</HI> is frequently used; under which is shadowed Christ's Spi∣ritual Seed, or those who were given him by his Father, and were to descend from him by a Spiritual Regeneration; such a Seed is pro∣mised him, <HI>Psal</HI> 22.30. <HI>A Seed shall serve him; it shall be counted to the Lord for a Generation.</HI> And under the Type of <HI>David,</HI> the Seed of Christ is eminently set forth, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 89. And it comprehends in it all the Elect of God, whom he tells us that his Father had given to him, and they were in due time to be born of him by a new birth. <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was a City which <HI>God chose out of all the Tribes of Israel, to put his Name there</HI>: there he settled his Ordinances, and therefore is said to have a peculiar respect for it, <HI>Psal.</HI> 87.2. <HI>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more than all the dwell∣ings of Jacob.</HI> And hence it is usually appli∣ed to the Church of God; sometimes to the <HI>Militant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> 26. <HI>Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all</HI>; sometimes to the <HI>Triumphant, Heb.</HI> 12.22. <HI>Ye are come to the Heavenly Jerusalem.</HI> And in the former of these respects it is here to be understood; and then by the <HI>Inhabitants of Jerusalem,</HI> we are to conceive is meant, those who are by the Grace of God brought over to him, and
<PB N="46" REF="000960_0049_0FADE42E1290E248"/>
priviledged with the immunities of the City of God: and this <HI>Typical</HI> application of <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI> is peculiarly celebrated in, <HI>Psal.</HI> 122. So that these are the same subjects with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> former, represented under a divers <HI>Type.</HI> Only we are to observe, that Gods Elect are com∣prehended, because, though they are not at present actually the <HI>Seed of Christ,</HI> and Mem∣bers of the <HI>Militant Church,</HI> yet they are de∣signed to be so, and given to Christ for that end; and by their being in due time made so, it is evidenced that they were appointed to this priviledge from Eternity. Now these are they for whom this fountain is opened. And in order to our distinct taking this up, we may observe;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is certain that this fountain is not in any sense opened to all the world.</HI> There is a two∣fold opening of it, which might have been observed, <HI>viz</HI> there is that which is <HI>outward,</HI> by the promulgation of the Gospel, and that which is <HI>inward,</HI> made by the Illumination of the Spirit. In this latte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ense, none but the Children of God have this discovery made unto them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.7. <HI>The Election hath ob∣tained it, the rest were blinded.</HI> Hence that awful word of Christ, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.11. <HI>It is given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.</HI> But we are now considering it in respect to the for∣mer sense, though as it aims especially at the
<PB N="47" REF="000960_0050_0FADE42EF6719770"/>
latter. And here it must be granted, that Christ is not opened unto any, but such to whom there is some signification made, by which they may be informed concerning him, so as to discover him to be a fountain of life; and this must be either by Immediate Revelation, or by the dispensation of the Gos∣pel unto them: The former is not ordinary, and therefore, whatsoever God will do on prerogative, yet he hath given us no other ground to expect it but in the latter, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14. <HI>How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</HI> But it is notorious that a great part of the World are altogether ignorant of this fountain, and there is none sent to shew it to them, and so must remain strangers to it. For men to think that the light of nature can discover, or that the Sun, Moon and Stars can preach a Christ to fallen man, is a vain and groundless opinion; the Apostle is posi∣tive in this, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.3. <HI>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That this fountain is opened in the outward discoveries and offers of it, to those that are not of the Seed of Christ, or of his mystical Body.</HI> Christ hath a visible, as well as a spiritual seed: <HI>i. e.</HI> such as are only so in outward appearance; there is a <HI>Jew</HI> that is so <HI>outwardly,</HI> and one who is so <HI>inwardly.</HI> Now it is the visible Church of Christ which is the subject of the outward Dispensations of the Gospel, and ex∣hibitions

of Christ therein. Christ is preach∣ed as well to Reprobates as to Elect; the Gospel is afforded, and the Grace of it offer∣ed, as well to those in whom it is a <HI>Savour of death,</HI> as to those to whom it becomes a <HI>Sa∣vour of life,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.15, 16. The <HI>Apostle</HI> tells us, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.6. <HI>All are not Israel that are of Isra∣el. i e.</HI> All do not belong to the true Seed, that have the external denomination: and yet these are they to whom the <HI>Ministration of the letter</HI> is equally afforded.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This notwithstanding the direct aim, and great design of opening this fountain, is for the sake of those that are given to Christ.</HI> This is a great truth, though the carnal minds of natural men are prejudiced at it, and engage in so many earnest cavils against it; and it becomes <HI>a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence</HI> to them, yet it is fully ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rted in the Word of God, and is nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssary to be laid open in the Mini∣stry of the Gospel That then this truth may be cleared up, let us observe the following Propositions.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>That there is a select number of</HI> Adams <HI>ruined Posterity, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od hath appointed to bring to eternl life by Christ.</HI> We must begin here, if we would follow this grace down from the fountain of it. Gods last end in this great affair was the exaltation of the glo∣ry of his <HI>Grace</HI>; but in the ordering of the <HI>Media</HI> by which this was to be brought about,
<PB N="49" REF="000960_0052_0FADE43071B5BD10"/>
there must be a subject in whom it is to be exalted; and that can be no other than a Creature that needed it. This necessity man brought upon himself by his undoing Aposta∣sy, out of the ruines whereof God would pick up such as should be made the monuments of it: and these were not intended to be all, but only some, who are called his <HI>Chosen,</HI> those <HI>whom he hath given to Christ,</HI> those <HI>whose names are written in the Book of Life,</HI> and other like distinguishing notes, differencing them from the rest of mankind: nor could this appoint∣ment be only general and conditional, for then it were improper to say, that their <HI>names</HI> were <HI>written,</HI> or that <HI>God knows who they are,</HI> but we are assured that he doth, 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 2.19.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence it was for their sakes that Christ was prepared and appointed to be a fountain of life to them.</HI> All mankind died in the first Trans∣gression, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. <HI>By one man sin came into the world, and death by sin; so that death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</HI> There must therefore a Well of Salvation be opened for the man, if ever he be restored to life a∣gain. The Son of God, barely considered as a Divine person, could not be so to Fallen man, as the case stands between God and him. He was capable of being made so, but there was a great deal to be done in this af∣fair to bring it about; he must become a Surety for us; he must, as such, take our na∣ture
<PB N="50" REF="000960_0053_0FADE431F39DE5D0"/>
upon him, and in it put himself in our room, under the Law, and comport with the Sanctions of it▪ accordingly he must do and dy for us, and therein fulfil all righteousness; and in that way he became <HI>able to save us to the uttermost:</HI> God is therefore said to have made him all this, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30▪ <HI>Who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and Sancti∣fication, and Redemption.</HI> Now that which was designed in this was our Salvation, and there∣fore it had a peculiar respect to those whom he was to save; Christ therefore declares the very design of this, <HI>Joh</HI> 17.19 <HI>For their sakes do I Sanctifie my self</HI>; and it is a thing altoge∣ther unquestionable, that if it had not been for this, the Son of God had never taken this province upon him, and gone through it, as may be gathered from, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.17. <HI>God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be saved.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>That the Gospel, in which this fountain is opened, was appointed to be the way of the com∣munication of the vertue of it unto these.</HI> It is not enough that there was a fulness of all Grace stored in Christ, but there must be a derivation of the saving vertue of it, to all those that live by it. Now, though the spirit of God, to whom the Application of it be∣longeth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s he who derives it to us from Christ, yet he hath a way in which he so doth; and we are given to understand that
<PB N="51" REF="000960_0054_0FADE4328FD38F38"/>
this is by the Gospel: and therefore the ver∣tue of it is Metonymically assigned to the Gospel, which is called <HI>the power of God to Salvation, Rom.</HI> 1.16. And the reason is, be∣cause as it is to become ours, so God deals with us in bringing us to this faith, according to our nature, as Reasonable Creatures, by shewing us our object, and the fulness and suf∣ficiency of it; by discovering the terms of the Covenant▪ on which we may come to be in∣terested in it; by setting before us all the in∣centives to move us to entertain it; all of which are discovered to us in and by the Gos∣pel; for we are told, 2 <HI>Tim▪</HI> 1.10. <HI>Life and Immortality are brought to light by the Gospel.</HI> When therefore God intends men Salvation, in the ordinary dispensation of himself to them, he makes use of the Gospel as a <HI>Medi∣um</HI> by which he will apply himself to them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Those to whom it is thus to be dispensed▪ live mixt among other men.</HI> It is Gods good pleasure, that his Chosen shall be scattered up and down in the World, and have their dwel∣ling among those that are his Enemies; he therefore calls them <HI>from the Lions dens, and from the mountains of the Leopards, Cant.</HI> 4.8. There are indeed some places in the world that are wholly in darkness, and we know not of any of those that are given to Christ a∣mong them; but in other places they dwell one with another; in some places there are
<PB N="52" REF="000960_0055_0FADE433991E3CA0"/>
more, in others there are fewer of these, but there are no places where Christ hath a Seed, but there are wicked men dwelling with the Godly. The Apostle therefore tells us, that <HI>we must go out of the world,</HI> if we would be <HI>wholly separated</HI> from such, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.10. And we are acquainted that God hath some, whom he will sooner or later make sharers in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> benefit, in every Nation; <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.9. <HI>Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred and tongue, and people, and nation. The tares and the wheat must grow together till the end of the world</HI>; then will a <HI>separation</HI> be made between the one and the other, and not till then, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.40, 41. And these not only dwell together in one City or Town, but oftentimes they live in the same house, and ly in the same bed, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.34. <HI>There shall be two men in one bed, the one shall be ta∣ken and the other left.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That God hath appointed men, who are cal∣led by him unto it, to be the ordinary dispensers of this Gospel.</HI> He could indeed have done it im∣mediately by his Spirit, or he could have em∣ployed the Glorious <HI>Angels</HI> in this Affair, who would have accounted it an honour thus <HI>to minister for the heirs of Salvation</HI>: but he hath Chosen this way in his wisdom, as that which is best accommodated for us, and that wherein he will gain the greater glory to himself, ac∣cording to, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.7. <HI>We have this treasure in
<PB N="53" REF="000960_0056_0FADE4340E29B798"/>
earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</HI> It was for this end that <HI>Jesus Christ gave such gifts to men when he ascended, as Eph.</HI> 4.10 &amp;c. <HI>For the perfecting of the Saints,</HI> &amp;c. And the Apostle gives us to understand, that ordinarily there is no other way for us to come to faith in Christ, and obtain Salvation by him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14, 15. <HI>How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That these cannot distinguish between those that are given to Christ, and others.</HI> They are not acquainted with the secret counsels of God concerning men in particular; they find men equally lying in the rubbish of the Apo∣stasy, and have not been admitted to look in∣to <HI>the Lambs Book of Life,</HI> and there to read whose names stand upon record, so as to ap∣ply themselves to them and to no other: Those whom God hath purposed to shew his special Grace upon, are alike with others in their natural estate, <HI>being children of wrath as they, Eph.</HI> 2.3. There is no difference be∣tween them in their frame and disposition, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.9. <HI>They are all under sin.</HI> In their na∣tural state they are held under the power and dominion of their lusts, and are as ill condi∣tioned as the most, and possibly have run themselves into as great exorbitancies, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.3. <HI>We our selves were sometimes disobedient, serv∣ing

divers lusts,</HI> &amp;c. Nay, they may have set themselves so prodigiously against God, and Christ, that these may doubt of them, and object against them, so did <HI>Ananias,</HI> with re∣spect to <HI>Paul,</HI> when God bad him to visit him, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.13. <HI>Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem,</HI> &amp;c Before God cometh with his power to accompany their ministry to effect, his Servants may meet with more discourage∣ment, from such whom God will bring home to himself by their Ministry at last, than from any others.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Hence they are to open and offer this Grace to all that hear them.</HI> It is true, those offers are to be made upon Gospel terms; they are to preach it as a Covenant, and not only to tell Sinners that there is mercy to be had with God, but to shew them in what way alone they may come by it. However they are thus to exhibit this fountain, and bid all with∣out exception to come to it, they must endea∣our to make all that hear them sensible of their need of it, and then to give them all en∣couragement to come to it; they are to re∣peat their invitation to the <HI>thirsty</HI> to <HI>come to the waters, Isa</HI> 55.1. they are to tell the <HI>wea∣ry and heavy laden</HI>; that if they do <HI>come, Christ will give them rest, Mat.</HI> 11.28. They are to invite the most wicked, to set the hopes of mercy before them, and assure them that if
<PB N="55" REF="000960_0058_0FADE5F7F1B67C78"/>
they comply with the proposals of the Gos∣pel, they shall be welcome, and need not to despair: they are to tell the <HI>wicked,</HI> that if he will <HI>forsake his way, and return to the Lord, he will abundantly pardon, Isa.</HI> 55.7. To let them know that <HI>Christ came to save chief sinners,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15. Nor are there any sins or Sin∣ners exempted but such as have committed the unpardonable sin, which is hard to know, and ought not easily to be charged upon any.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>And there shall a glory redound to God from all those to whom this fountain is thus opened.</HI> It is not to be expected, that all that are invited will come; we read, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.5, 6. <HI>They made light of it, and went their mays, one to his farm, another to his Merchandize: and the remnant took his Servants and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.</HI> There are some that will hear∣tily accept of the Call, and come to Christ with all their hearts; and there are others who will bid him depart, and return scorn and contempt to all the invitations which he gives them. However God will be no loser by these, either the one or the other. Despi∣sers indeed will lose the benefit which they might have been made happy by, had they complied with the Treaty; but God will make his word to obtain its end; <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.11. <HI>My word which goeth out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me void, but shall accomplish that which I please,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Paul</HI> longed for the Con∣version
<PB N="56" REF="000960_0059_0FADE5F9210B6D48"/>
of all his Hearers, but he found it to fall out otherwise in many of them, notwith∣standing he comforted himself in this▪ that his labour should not be lost, but God would be glorified in the issue, whatever the efficacy were, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.15. <HI>We are unto God a sweet sa∣vour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>But yet if it had not been for this seed of Christ, this fountain had not been thus opened.</HI> Christ was exhibited for the discovery of Gods Grace, and though they that despise it shall smart for their so doing, yet the prime design of sending the Gospel, and revealing Christ in it unto any, is mans Salvation by him; and but for this there had been no Christ, and so no offer of him. Mans relati∣on to the <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> exposed him suf∣ficiently to <HI>Revenging Justice</HI>; the <HI>New Cove∣nant</HI> was for the display of <HI>Grace.</HI> If God sends his Gospel to any, it is because he hath some there to be made partakers of his saving mercy, this was the reason why <HI>Paul</HI> must tarry at <HI>Corinth, Acts</HI> 18 9, 10. <HI>Be not afraid,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for I have much people in this City</HI>; and we may suppose the reason why <HI>the Spirit for∣bad him to preach the Word in Asia, and would not suffer him to go into Bythinia,</HI> Chap. 16.6, 7. was because there were none there to be Converted by his Preaching.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Hence these, and only these shall partake in
<PB N="57" REF="000960_0060_0FADE5FA08FB02E0"/>
the saving good of it.</HI> Others partake in the outward benefit of it, but through their sin, it turns to their greater Condemnation: but these are made to enjoy the efficacy of this fountain, and all the vertue of it derives to them for their everlasting good: and in this regard it is opened only for them; <HI>i. e.</HI> for their real good in the event. It is indeed the others fault that they are not savingly bene∣fited by it; but the peculiar grace and favour of God appears to these, not only in afford∣ing the fountain to be opened to them, but also in bringing of them to it, and making them drink of it, and live for ever; and it is certain, that there must be besides the out∣ward offer of it to men by the Word and the Ministry of it, the powerful operation of the Spirit of God, to perswade and enable sinful men thus to forsake their <HI>broken cisterns,</HI> at which they dwelt contentedly, and betake themselves to the <HI>fountain of living waters.</HI> Christ saith, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6 44. <HI>No man can come unto me, except the father which hath sent me, draw him</HI>; and they are only those that did thus belong to Christ in the Covenant of Redem∣ption, to whom he so irresistably and efficaci∣ously applies himself in bringing them over to Christ by faith; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that, <HI>Joh</HI> 10.26. <HI>Ye believe not, because ye are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of my sheep.</HI> And without doubt, all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thus opened for, shall in due time be made happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in it,

<P><HI>USE I. We may here take notice of the won∣derful love of God to his Chosen in Christ.</HI> When the Scripture attributes love to God, it points to his good will in purposing good to be be∣stowed on them, and making them that are appointed thereto to partake therein: and this love is looked upon to be greater or less, ac∣cording to the things that are willed in it, and the benefit received by them: and on this ac∣count, God is said to love some of his Crea∣tures more than others, in that he hath done more for them, and prepared greater blessings to bestow on them. There is a <HI>common love</HI> of God, in which the whole Creation is a sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, appearing in his <HI>benignity</HI> in bestowing on them these favours by which they are pre∣served, supplied, and comforted; to this is to be referred that, <HI>Acts</HI> 14 17 <HI>He did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness</HI>; and <HI>Chap</HI> 17 25 <HI>He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.</HI> But then there is a <HI>special love</HI> which God hath for some of his Creatures, and that was in appointing, providing, and o∣pening this fountain for them, from which they may derive everlasting life. This there∣fore is mentioned in the Gospel with an <HI>Em∣phasis,</HI> as if it were the only love, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4 9.
<PB N="59" REF="000960_0062_0FADE5FD0971B598"/>
<HI>In this was the love of God manifested to us,</HI> &amp;c. &amp; <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>God so loved the world,</HI> &amp;c. Certainly then this love of God to those for whom it was prepared must be great beyond conception: <HI>Paul</HI> thus signalizeth the love of Christ to him, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20. <HI>Who loved me, and gave himself for me.</HI> Now it is certain that this fountain was ordained for the saving be∣nefit of those, and only those whom God or∣dained to eternal life by Christ; but for whose sake it had never been. And though such to whom this fountain is opened in the Dispensa∣tion of the Gospel, are by vertue of it privi∣ledged singularly above others, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 147.20. <HI>He hath not dealt so by any Nation,</HI> &amp;c. Yet the specialty of it appears in respect of those to whom it is applied by the Spirit, and they are made to drink of it, and to live by it; for to these only it becomes effectual in regard of the great design of it: and these are only the <HI>Israel</HI> of God, his Chosen and Called. For though it is Ministerially opened to others, yet spiritually it is to them a sealed fountain, and they participate not in the vertue of it. How infinitely then are these behol∣den to God for Christ? and what praise and thanksgiving ought they to be ever celebrating their gratiude to him withal, for this benefit?</P>
<P><HI>USE II. Learn hence how vain a thing it is for any to boast and be confident, in that they enjoy

the outward Gospel Dispensations.</HI> True, God doth favour such more than he doth them that <HI>sit in the dark,</HI> and have no Gospel <HI>light</HI> shining among them; and they owe him great thanks for such a favour, because by it they are nearer Salvation, as to the means; the fountain is brought to them, and if they pe∣rish for all, it will be their own fault: howe∣ver this outward priviledge doth not give them the security of Salvation. There are multitudes that dy of thirst, notwithstanding the fountain is before them, and they are invited to drink of it, and live, because they will not make use of it; <HI>they will not come to Christ that they might have life, Joh.</HI> 5.40. They leave it for their <HI>broken cisterns,</HI> which will not afford one drop of the <HI>wa∣ters of life</HI> to them; and if they drink ne∣ver so large draughts thereof, it will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quench their appetites.

<PB N="61" REF="000960_0064_0FADE5FF0427F318"/>
for none equally suffer Gods wrath, with those to whom a Christ hath been offered, and they neglected him. God will call those whom he pleaseth, to receive Christ, and live by him; the Saving vertue of the Gospel shall not be lost, although you put it from you, and perish. <HI>Be not then high minded, but fear.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE. III.</HI> We here see of what great impor∣tance it is for us all to <HI>make our Calling and E∣lection sure.</HI> It certainly is a duty incumbent on all, and therefore we are called upon to use <HI>diligence</HI> in it, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. Surely it infinitely concerns all the Children of fallen Adam to get a title to the fountain of life, and take care that they be not mistaken about it. It is not enough to give an Historical credit to the truths of the Gospel, wherein we are told that Jesus Christ is an Alsufficient Saviour, and that all Life and Salvation is fountained in him; though this credit is also necessary in order to our coming to, and believing on him: but our concern is to know whether we are sharers in it, whether it be made ours, and shall assuredly afford us Salvation. It is evident that we are all perishing in our natural state; that this world is a <HI>thirsty and dry wilderness,</HI> where there is no water of life; that all saving good is laid up in Christ, as in a fountain; that all to whom he is offered, do not accept of him; that many who pretend to receive him, will be found

Hypocrites and self deceivers; that to be mis∣taken in this affair another day, will be the Creatures undoing; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one have any claim to this but the Seed of Christ, and Children of the <HI>Church Mystical.</HI> See then that this founda∣tion is laid in you.

<P><HI>USE. IV. Here is matter of Encouragment to awakened Sinners that sit under the Gospel.</HI> Are there any whose thirsty Souls, not only crave after happiness, but find no satisfaction in those objects which sin hath diverted men unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you find your misery, in that you perish with∣out the waters of life, and that this wilderness will afford none, and are thereupon inquisitive after Christ, of whom you have heard a report that he is one that can do it for you: to such this truth speaks seasonably and comfortably. Here is a <HI>Well of Salvation</HI> opened in <HI>this dry and thirsty land,</HI> its waters are healing and sa∣tisfying; there is enough of them, there is a fountain, and it can never fail. And not only are you comprehended in the general invitati∣on
<PB N="63" REF="000960_0066_0FADE5FFD367E540"/>
given to all where the Gospel is Preached, but it is the special direction of it that is given to such as you, and all encouragment joyned with it; the <HI>weary and heavy laden</HI> are singled out in it, <HI>Math.</HI> 11.28. <HI>The poor and needy, and such whose eyes fail them,</HI> are remembred with a gracious promise, <HI>Isa.</HI> 41.17. And indeed, the way in which God perswades and allures pe∣rishing Sinners to come to Christ, is by touch∣ing their Consciences, and making them ap∣prehensive of their woful misery in themselves, and their helplessness any where else, that so the revelation of Christ to them may be very welcome, as showers of rain are to the weary wilderness, that is parched. You have great reason then to <HI>hope in his Grace,</HI> and according∣ly to adventure your selves upon it; for if God be opening of your hearts to receive Christ, it is because he intends to fill them with him; and the emptying you of every other thing, is a step to that.</P>
<P><HI>USE. V. Let this quicken the Children of God, to make a free and full Improvement of this foun∣tain for all the ends of it.</HI> The usefulness of it extends to all the necessities of your Souls; there is no relief that you can need, but here it may be fully supplyed: and your occasions are such as call you every day to come to it.

this fountain to you; he hath rolled the stone from the mouth of it; he hath planted you by it; and is from time to time drawing out these waters, and presenting them to you in his holy Ordinances: why then should you use them sparingly? they are your own, God hath given them you freely, and he bids you to <HI>drink</HI> of them <HI>abundantly.</HI> You many times complain of your pinching want; you thirst, and Oh! that you could have a satisfying draught; why then do you stand off? What! question your title, doubt whether you may make use of your own, and live upon it with greatest contentment? Oh this Unbelief! Pray to God to cure you of it; and endeavour to improve all the encouragement that he hath given you, to make you, with holy boldness, at all times come to him, and bring your vessels with you, that they may be filled. The more you thus do, the more you will please him, and the more happy and delightful will your Pilgrimage be to you, and the more abundantly will you praise and glorifie God for <HI>this un∣speakable gift.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE IV. The great design of Opening this fountain to Gods People, is for Sin, and for Uncleanness.</HEAD>
<P>THis is directly expressed in our <HI>Text.</HI> There are three things mainly includ∣ed in this Doctrine: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="65" REF="000960_0068_0FADE601866DD408"/>1. That it was the sin and uncleanness of man, that gave the occasion for the opening of this Fountain.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the great usefulness of this Foun∣tain, is for the taking away of the sin and uncleanness that man hath contracted.</P>
<P N="3">3. That where this Fountain is savingly applied, it shall take away the Sin and Un∣cleanness of the People of God. These then may be briefly, and yet distinctly taken into consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it was sin and uncleanness of man, that gave the occasion for the Opening of thss Fountain.</HI> We must here distinguish between a cause and an occasion. They go too far, who assign a Causality in sin to the coming of Christ in the Flesh, and his working out of Salvation for us: for though, as will anon be considered, if it had not been for this, he had not so come, yet there cannot properly be assigned any causality in this to such an effect: and they who so think, do not rightly consider the order and causes of Gods Works of Efficiency. They that ascribe a causality to it, reckon it to be an <HI>impulsive cause,</HI> or a <HI>motive</HI> on the mind of God to send his Son into the world on this Errand; but that it cannot be, because the will of God is the su∣pream cause of his purposing the works of Efficiency. And as the Glory of his Grace was the last end of his purpose of <HI>Election,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="000960_0069_0FADE60211C4D018"/>
so the fall of man into sin, and under misery by sin, was a purposed <HI>Medium</HI> to it, and so could not possibly be a <HI>Medium</HI> to that pur∣pose. However in the contrivance of the <HI>Media,</HI> there was an allwise concatenation of one with another, and so the sin and un∣cleanness of man gave occasion for the Co∣ming of Christ. And we may take this short <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That God purposed from Eternity to exalt the glory of his Grace, in some lasting Monu∣ments of it.</HI> If we would take a right ac∣count of any of Gods works, we must be∣gin at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd or Design of them. We are to conceive of God as an Infinitely Wise A∣gent, and therefore to have some worthy End in all that he doth: and according to this we are to conceive pf the wisdom appearing in the means that he useth to bring this end about. Now God hath declared or manifest∣ed himself to us in divers glorious Attributes or Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ections, by which he will make him∣self known; two whereof were his <HI>Grace,</HI> and his <HI>Mercy,</HI> which are often used promis∣cuously for one and the same in the Gospel, when they are referred to the great design under our present consideration, though there is a divers notion which we are to entertain of them; <HI>Grace</HI> being God inclined freely to bestow his favour upon a Creature that de∣serves it not; <HI>Mercy</HI> supposing the Subject to
<PB N="67" REF="000960_0070_0FADE6040EC1D500"/>
be in misery, is God inclined to succour it in that misery. <HI>Grace</HI> may exert it self in a subject that is not in misery; yea, all that God doth for any of his Creatures is free; hence that challenge. <HI>Rom</HI> 11 35. <HI>Who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed him again. Mercy</HI> is restrained to a miserable subject; and that mercy also is a fruit of Grace, because it is free, for the Creatures in∣felicity cannot make it to deserve the Succour afforded it. Now God would have some last∣ing Monuments of these perfections of his, which should for ever be Mirrours in which it should be read, how gloriously Gracious and Merciful he is. The Apostle therefore reduc∣eth the great contrivance of mans Salvation to this, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.6. <HI>To the praise of the glory of his Grace.</HI> His people are therefore said <HI>to be to him for a Name, and for a Praise, and for a Glory,</HI> Jer. 13.11.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In the order of the means to this end, there was nothing wherein God designed the exaltation of this Grace and Mercy, equally with that of Christ in respect of his Redemption and Salvation.</HI> He that designs an end, must chuse and use means for the bringing of it about; and many times there is an order of many means for the ac∣complishment of that which is intended; and in this order there is a subordination of them one to another, in their serving to the design of them: and this is very manifest in the won∣derful
<PB N="68" REF="000960_0071_0FADE60453896B48"/>
counsel of God, for the exaltation of the glory of his Grace and Mercy. Now, as the way in which God chose to glorify these per∣fections of his, was by the Redemption and Sal∣vation of man, in and by which man was to be made the monument of them; so he ap∣pointed Jesus Christ to be the Redeemer and Saviour, in which he had a regard to Christ's <HI>Mediatorial Glory</HI>: Christ therefore tells us, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.22, 23. <HI>The Father Judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgment unto the Son; that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</HI> The person of Christ, considered as God and man, was a great <HI>Medium</HI> in this affair; and for that reason he is called a <HI>Me∣diator,</HI> or a middle person, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.5. <HI>There is one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus.</HI> God therefore constituted him to be such a person, that so in and through him, this rich Grace of his might shine forth to all eternity; and for that reason we are said to be chosen in him for this end; <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4. <HI>with</HI> 6. <HI>According as he hath chosen us in him,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>To the praise of the glory of his Grace.</HI> And that wherein this Glory was to be illustrated was in the Redemption which he was to work out, by which our Salvation was to be procured, &amp; the conferring of this purchased Salvation upon us by him▪ hence that, <HI>Verse</HI> 7. <HI>In whom we have Redemption through his blood.</HI> And indeed, in nothing could the Grace of God, so illustriously
<PB N="69" REF="000960_0072_0FADE60513D86220"/>
appear, as in the appointing of his own Son to be a Redeemer for man, when his case was reduced to that exigence, that in no other way he could be Saved; <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16 <HI>God so loved the World, that he gave his only begott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Son.</HI> Rom. 5.6. <HI>When we were without strength, in due time Christ dyed for the ungodly.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That way might be made for this, there must be a subject for it to work upon, which needed this Redemption and Salvation.</HI> A Redeemer, and Redeemed are Correlates, and one cannot be without the other: This is a <HI>Relative Title,</HI> and therefore if there had been nothing to Re∣deem, Christ could never have born that Title on him: Redemption supposeth a forfeiture, or captivity, which the subject which is to par∣take in it, is fallen under, and from whence his necessity of being redeemed doth arise, in that he is by this means to be restored from it. It is true, there are other ways among men, by which such an one may be delivered, <HI>viz.</HI> either by a free setting him at liberty without any satisfaction made, by the bounty of the Creditour, or by a forcible recovery of him out of the hands of those that hold him; but this is one way, and the only one in the case before us; <HI>viz.</HI> by the laying down of an in∣dented price, or by an exchange of persons, to both of which the case in hand is referred, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.20. <HI>Ye are bought with a price.</HI> 1 Tim. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.6. <HI>Who gave himself a ransom for us.</HI> Gal 3.13.
<PB N="70" REF="000960_0073_0FADE60742ED92A0"/>
<HI>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</HI> Hence God appointing of Christ to be a Redeemer, had a respect to mans falling into such a condition as made him to stand in need of one; which necessity was another <HI>Medium</HI> for the mani∣festation of this Grace and Mercy.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That which was to enhaunce this Mercy was the forlorn state of the subject, and his helplessness out of it, in any other way.</HI> The more there is of Grace and Mercy in it, the more are these Attributes glorified by it: hence every circum∣stance in this affair belongs to the <HI>Media.</HI> The more of unworthiness there is in the sub∣ject, the greater is the Grace afforded to it; and this Grace also holds proportion with the greatness of the kindness it self that is done by it. The more miserable the subject is, the more astonishing is that mercy which Succours it; and the more ample deliverance it affords, the greater is its praise: and that which gives a peculiar lustre to both of these is when the subject is brought into such a streight, that there is but one door at which its help can come in; when there is no other possible way of relief, and then that affords it; we are therefore acquainted how all these circumstan∣ces concentred in the case before us: how miserable we were become, how unworthy we had rendred our selves (who indeed never had any meritorious worthiness in us) may be
<PB N="71" REF="000960_0074_0FADE607F92889B0"/>
read in the word of God: and that our con∣dition was helpless, if Christ had not stept in for our Succour, is there also witnessed to; we are told, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven, given amongst men, whereby we must be Saved:</HI> and we have that remark, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.16. <HI>He saw that there was no man, and he wondred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there was no intercessour, therefore his arm brought sal∣vation unto him, &amp;c.</HI> This therefore is given as a great commendation of Christ, <HI>Psal</HI> 72.12. <HI>He shall deliver the poor, und him that hath no helper.</HI> And God himself mentions this as a memorable thing, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.5, 6. <HI>None eye pitied thee, and when I passed by thee and saw thee pollu∣ted in thy blood, I said unto thee, live.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Way was made unto this by that sin and un∣cleanness that man had contracted to himself.</HI> It is certain, that the <HI>abounding of sin,</HI> made the way for the <HI>abounding of this Grace,</HI> Rom. 5.20. Man indeed, had he kept his primitive integrity, would have been a subject of Gods <HI>Grace</HI>; every thing that he received from God would have been a free favour: but Grace is wonderfully enlarged in and by the Salvation which is provided for and afforded to fallen and sinful man: and as to <HI>Mercy,</HI> in the strict sense of it, man was not a subject nextly capable of it, till sin had made him so; he was not miserable, nor was there any distress upon him which called for succour
<PB N="72" REF="000960_0075_0FADE60811C86610"/>
and compassion. It was sin that hurled him into all his inconveniencies, and those mis∣chiefs that now ly upon him, and have him in pursuit. We are therefore acquainted how this came about, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. <HI>By one man sin came into the world, and death by sin.</HI> And now, when man is brought into such a state, he is a subject fit for Grace and Mercy to work upon, and erect to themselves trophies of honour and glory, in doing for him, by raising him out of that forlorn condition, and bestowing upon him the contrary blessedness. Not as if this miserable estate which man hath by his own folly brought himself into, laid a∣ny obligation upon God to work for him in this way, for it indeed exposed him to his just indignation: but only that it laid open an <HI>Object</HI> that needed it, and upon which, if he saw meet, he might exert those Attributes of his to the highest, and thereby bring to him∣self a Tribute of everlasting praise. When therefore <HI>Paul</HI> had mentioned how notable a subject he had been of this, he could not but shut up the discourse of it with that Doxolo∣gy, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.17. <HI>Now unto the King Eternal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmortal, Invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory, for ever and ever, Amen.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>There were divers steps to this, all of which were ordered by the holy counsel of God.</HI> Every thing that bears the consideration of a <HI>Medi∣um</HI> to this great end, must needs be acknow∣ledged
<PB N="73" REF="000960_0076_0FADE608E85BDD08"/>
unto Gods fore appointment; for <HI>all things fall out according to the counsel of his will</HI>: and though he is not in any respect to be accounted the author of sin, yet he is the Supream Orderer of it, and that according to his <HI>permissive will.</HI> Now there were such steps as these, all of which made way for the in∣troduction of this Grace and Mercy of his.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Creating of man Upright.</HI> That God did so Create him, we are told, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7.29. <HI>God made man upright. Adam</HI> was Created in a state of integrity, which consisted in the rectitude of his nature, by vertue of the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reated principle of <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> which was put into it, and was called <HI>Gods</HI> own <HI>Image</HI> after which man was made, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.26. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if he had not been thus made, he could not have been capable of the follow∣ing transactions that were betwixt God and him: for to require that of a Creature which it was never in a capacity of complying with∣al, had been unworthy of Gods infinite wis∣dom, and altogether inconsistent with that Justice which God laid the foundation for, in the nature and state that he Created man in.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Covenant of Works, and the Sanctions of it.</HI> That there was such a Covenant plighted with man, the Word of God gives us sufficient intimations of: and as it was re∣quisite that man should be a cause by Counsel of his own actions, or else he could not have,
<PB N="74" REF="000960_0077_0FADE60A0DF5EDC8"/>
been treated with in the way of a Covenant which supposeth a <HI>mutual stipulation</HI> between the persons Covenanting; so the works re∣quired of him in that Covenant, could not have been performed by him according to the tenour of it, without the <HI>moral rectitude</HI> of his nature, which we have taken notice of. Now in this Covenant there are considerable the <HI>Sanctions</HI> of it, but for which man could not have been happy or miserable according to it, and his carriage of himself towards it. God therefore, besides a Rule which he gave to man directing him how he might serve him aright, annexed a promise of life in case of Obedience full and perfect, and threatned him with death if he should transgress the precept; which is intimated in that, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2▪ 17. <HI>In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely dy</HI>; and thus man, under the first Cove∣nant, stood a probationer for life or death according as he should behave himself.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The permission of him to fall</HI> That man did eventually fall from his Rule and Happi∣ness, is a thing very notorious. That this fall was a foil on which God drew the lines, and laid the colours of his <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> is no less observable in the Word of God: hence that, <HI>Rom</HI> 5.20 21. <HI>The Law entred that sin might abound; but where sin abounded, Grace did much more abound: that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righ∣teousness
<PB N="75" REF="000960_0078_0FADE60A6B5798A8"/>
unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> And that God had a respect unto this in appointing Christ to be a Redeemer and Saviour, is not to be doubted, inasmuch as this was the very thing from which he was to redeem and save us: this therefore is said to commend that Grace, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.8. <HI>God commen∣deth his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</HI> God therefore must needs have a foresight of this Apostasy, because the assignation of Christ to his Media∣torial Offices had a respect to it; and that man had not fallen but by Divine Permissi∣on, is certain: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could have kept him from it, without offering force to his free will, as he did the glorious Angels that keep their Station, as he doth the perfected Saints in Glory, and as he doth true Believ∣ers in this life from final Apostasy; and this <HI>Permission</HI> must needs flow from his will, be∣cause he is the Supream Governour of all Creatures, and all their actions, according to his holy pleasure. Hence, though God doth not approve of, but hateth sin, yet he saw it good, for an higher end, that there should be sin by his <HI>Permission.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>The miserable estate to which he is reduced by the fall, by vertue of the Curse of the Law.</HI> If man had retained his uprightness, he had never been miserable, and so had not stood in need of <HI>Mercy,</HI> but all miseries are contain∣ed
<PB N="76" REF="000960_0079_0FADE60B265E9220"/>
in that Curse which man is under by rea∣son of sin and uncleanness: and they are no other than what he must righteously suffer, if there be no way of delivery from them; in as much as he hath <HI>procured them to himself by his sin, Jer.</HI> 2.17. Now this misery was a pro∣per result of the threatning conditionally me∣naced in the first Covenant, which the man brought himself under, by transgressing of the Law which was so guarded.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Hence, if man had not by his sin and un∣cleanness involved himself in that misery, there had been no occasion for this fountains being prepa∣red and opened.</HI> There was no <HI>Mediator</HI> in the first Covenant, neither needed there any: God and man were in amity, and this friend∣ship had been confirmed between them upon mans entire conformity to the will of God, and been sealed up to him, upon his eating of the tree of life, which was a <HI>Sacrament</HI> of it. But now when the Covenant was viola∣ted, man was exposed, the Curse was fallen upon him, he was a man of death, there was an opportunity for Gods shewing himself <HI>mer∣ciful</HI> and <HI>gracious</HI>; and for the display of it, to send forth his Son to be a Saviour; and for that end to cause <HI>all fulness to dwell in him,</HI> that might derive from him to the undone creature, as from a Fountain. And this serves to give us some light into the stupendous <HI>mystery</HI> of the Providence of God, in suffer∣ing
<PB N="77" REF="000960_0080_0FADE60BF6842188"/>
of poor man to fall upon the Law, and break himself in pieces; but for which the glorious things of Christ had never been heard of in the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the great usefulness of this Fountain, is to take away the Sin and Uncleanness which man had contracted.</HI> It is certain that Christ is a fountain of all Saving good to sinful man, as hath been already observed: but the Spirit of God doth point us here to some peculiar bene∣fit, that it was designed for, and for that reason do require our particular consideration of. Here then we may enquire;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What we are here to understand by Sin, and Uncleanness?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In what respect Sin and Uncleanness may be said to be taken away?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What is the usefulness of this Fountain for such an end?</HI></P>
<P>Of these in order.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What are we here to understand by Sin and Uncleanness?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There are some who take these two words to be <HI>Synonymical,</HI> and to intend one and the same thing; only allowing an <HI>Emphasis</HI> in the ingemination of things, they suppose them to include all sorts and degrees of Sin. Some, by Sin understand those errors, or ordinary transgressions which men live in the Commis∣sion of; &amp; by Uncleanness the more enormous and Conscience wasting sins which they defile
<PB N="78" REF="000960_0081_0FADE60C92DCB858"/>
themselves withall: some again, by Sin un∣derstand Actual Sin; and by Uncleanness O∣riginal Sin, which is the root of defilement in man, and makes all the actions which he doth, polluted. But there is yet another sense which is more generally entertained, and seems more appositely to belong to the meaning of the <HI>Text,</HI> and recommends to us the excellent ver∣tue of this fountain, and its extensive usefull∣ness, <HI>viz</HI> that by <HI>Sin</HI> we are to understand the <HI>Guilt,</HI> and by <HI>Uncleanness</HI> the <HI>Defilement</HI> that is contracted by Sin. There are two wofull pro∣perties of sin, recorded in the word of God, in which the misery of sinful man is compre∣hended.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is a Guilt that is contracted by it</HI>; which is properly a respect that it bears to the Covenant of works, or the Sanction which was added to the Law which God at first gave unto man, Expressed in, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. <HI>In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dy,</HI> Expound∣ed in, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.4. <HI>The soul that Sinneth, it shall Dy.</HI> This word is therefore used for the pun∣ishment of sin, or rather for the Guilt by which the man lyeth obnoxious unto punishment, <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.7. <HI>If thou dost not well Sin lyeth at the door.</HI> Levit. 20.20. <HI>They shall bear their sin.</HI> And in the Levitical Law it is often used for the Sacrifice that was offered for sin, for the expiation of the Guilt of it, <HI>Lev.</HI> 4 20.24. And frequently else where.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="79" REF="000960_0082_0FADE60D5189BB18"/>2. <HI>There is also a defilement which the Sin leaves behind it upon the man: and that in respect both of Original and Actual Sin.</HI> Original sin is the very pollution of our nature, which makes us unclean things: and hence it is Allegorically and Emphatically set forth by the condition of a New-born Infant, in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. <HI>begin.</HI> And every actual sin leaves a spot, a stain, a filthi∣ness behind it upon the man that commits it, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 20.43. <HI>Ye shall remember your ways and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled.</HI> And this ariseth from the moral respect which sin bears to the Law of God, which is an holy Law, and men are said to be holy when they observe it; and for this reason sin is said to be <HI>an abo∣minable thing, Jer.</HI> 44.4.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In what respect this Sin and Uncleanness may be said to be taken away?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This will be evident from the former; for in what respect Sin and Uncleanness cleav∣eth to the man, in the same it must be removed. There is therefore a double taking away of sin, answerable to the twofold mischief which it doth the man, by its adhesion to him: the former is by <HI>Justification,</HI> the latter by <HI>Sancti∣fication.</HI> And these are two great and compre∣hensive benefits which the Gospel tells us do derive from Christ to us. These were in the old <HI>Mosaick</HI> Law represented, the one by the Sacrifices of Atonement, in which the blood of the offering was made use of; hence that,
<PB N="80" REF="000960_0083_0FADE610805841C0"/>
<HI>Heb.</HI> 9 22. <HI>Without the shedding of blood, there is no remession.</HI> The other by the many washings and purifications that men we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e appointed to make use of. And some think these two were Emblematized in the <HI>blood</HI> and <HI>water</HI> which issued from the body of Christ when he was pierced: Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Sin is taken away by Justification, when the Atonement being accepted for the Sinner, he is par∣doned, and his Guilt removed.</HI> As long as the Law makes its demands of the sinner personally, so long his sin lyeth upon him, &amp; he is Guilty; but when this pardon is bestowed, he ceaseth legally to be a Sinner, <HI>i. e.</HI> He is not a Guilty one, because he is discharged from the Sen∣tence that was out against him: his sin is in that regard as if it had never been; we read in, <HI>Jer▪</HI> 50.20. <HI>In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re shall be none, and the sins of Judah, and they shall n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t be found; for I will pardon</HI> &amp;c. And this is done by Gods accepting of an Atonement, when he saith as, <HI>Job</HI> 33.24 <HI>Deli∣ver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransome</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sin is taken away by</HI> Sanctification, <HI>when God, by his Spirit, applies his Grace to the Soul, by which he mortifyeth sin, and cleanseth it of the de∣filement which cleaveth to it.</HI> This is called the purgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g away of iniquity, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27.9. <HI>By this shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged.</HI> And <HI>the
<PB N="81" REF="000960_0084_0FADE6119DE45800"/>
purifying of our hearts, Acts</HI> 15.9. And we are allusively told how it is done, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.25. <HI>I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness.</HI> And this is nextly applied to Original sin, by the mortifi∣cation whereof we are Sanctified, and as sin decreaseth, so Grace encreaseth, which is our purity.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What is the Usefulness of this Fountain for such an end?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> There are two things to be considered in the Lord Jesus Christ as a Fountain, or a Treasury in whom they are laid up, which do suitably and sufficiently Answer these two oc∣casions of Sinful men, <HI>viz.</HI> his <HI>Merit,</HI> and his <HI>Grace:</HI> I shall give some general glances at each of these.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is an Infinite</HI> Merit <HI>fountained in Christ, for the taking away the Guilt of Sin, &amp; the Justification of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Sinner.</HI> We observed that this Guilt is an obligation lying upon the Sin∣ner by reason of the threatning, to suffer the penalty menaced by the Law. The Removal of this Guilt, with respect to the Sinner him∣self, can be only by a free pardon; for he hath nothing of his own to make compensation to the Law withal: But the removal of it with reference to the Covenant of works, and the Established Rule of Relative Justice in it, must be by Justification. God, as a Judge, must either Justify or Condemn him, upon his
<PB N="82" REF="000960_0085_0FADE6126E1ECB10"/>
Trial: and yet, in Justifying him, he must al∣so pardon him. These two are inconsistent in the procedure of humane Judges, but they are inseparable in Gods process upon believers. It is called <HI>Justifying the Ungodly, Rom.</HI> 4.5. But the ungodliness must be forgiven to the person freely, and so Justification is an act of Grace, <HI>Rom</HI> 3.24. <HI>Being Justified freely by his Grace.</HI> And yet it must be upon a Satisfaction and Merit, else the Law cannot be answered in it, nor the Justice of God consist with his Grace, and it must so do; <HI>Verse</HI> 26. <HI>That God may be just, and the Justifier of him that believ∣eth.</HI> In this Justification there are two things, <HI>viz. the pardon of sin, and the declaring the per∣son righteous</HI>; for which there must be found the Law answered in both parties; the threat∣ning must be satisfied for, which is to be done by a bearing of the whole penalty denoun∣ced against the Sinner for sin; and the con∣dition of the promise of life must be compli∣ed with, which is by perfect Obedience to the whole Law. That this may be done for the Sinner by a Surety, the Gospel assureth us; and that Christ was a Surety on this ac∣count, we are there informed, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.22. <HI>Je∣sus was made a Surety of a better Covenant.</HI> And this is also implied in that, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. <HI>He hath made him sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God through him.</HI> And those several expressions

amount to as much, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53.4, 5, 6. <HI>He hath born our griefs, and carried our sorrows; he was wounded for our transgressions, &amp;c.</HI> Now Christ, by the Redemption that he wrought out, laid in an infinite treasure of Righteousness for this end, and on this account it is called, <HI>the Righ∣teousness of God,</HI> Phil. 3 9.

And <HI>Everlasting Righteousness, Dan.</HI> 9 24. the satis∣faction and merit of it is sufficient to expiate the guilt of all sins, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.7. <HI>The Blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin.</HI> There is a bound∣less Ocean of vertue in him, so that <HI>he is able to save to the uttermost all that come to him,</HI> Heb. 7.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There is an incomprehensible fulness of Grace in Christ, which he is able to communicate to us for our Sanctification.</HI> Not only had he in him an unmeasurable fulness of Grace; and hence he is said to be <HI>full of Grace, Joh</HI> 1.14. to have an universal fulness in him, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.19. <HI>It pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.</HI> Not only to have <HI>Grace poured forth on his lips, Psal.</HI> 45.2. but to be <HI>anointed with the oyl of gladness above his fellows,</HI> ver. 7. Yea we are told, that <HI>God giveth not the Spirit by measure to him, Joh.</HI> 3.34 But he received it as a Fountain or Store house, that he might communicate it; hence that, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.16. <HI>Of his fulness we all receive, and grace for Grace.</HI> For this reason he is said to be <HI>made Sanctifi∣cation to us,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30.

that we can want, but there is enough of it with him to bestow upon us, and furnish us therewith for New-Obedience, that we may be so enabled to glorifie God in our lives: Nor is there any duty that he calls us to, so hard but that he can supply us with abundant ability to discharge it, and carry us through it to his glory. <HI>Paul</HI> could be confident of this, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Christ strengthening of me.</HI> It is the work of his Spirit to convey this Grace from him to us, <HI>Joh</HI> 16.14. <HI>He shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you.</HI> And he who is priviledged with this indwelling Spirit, needs not be discoura∣ged at any thing which God lays in his way as duty, but may confide in this, that Christ can and will be with him, and carry him through victoriously, over all that would obstruct him in it: and this is the ground up∣on which he bids his people, though weak in themselves, not to be afraid, <HI>Isa.</HI> 41.14. <HI>Fear not thou worm Jacob, and the men of Israel, I will help thee saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer.</HI> His Grace hath a cleansing vertue in it; and though we are at present Sanctified but in part, yet this is not through any defect in his vertue, but because he will carry the work on in his, gradually, for holy ends, and that he may learn them the experience of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual warfare, whiles they abide in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>: yet he who carries it on by degrees,
<PB N="85" REF="000960_0088_0FADE614EADF5398"/>
will give us the experience of the fulness of it, when he shall have purged away all our iniquities, and made us entire and spotless, which we are assured is the design to which his Redemption leads, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5 25, 26, 27. <HI>Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctifie,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or a∣ny such thing.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That where this fountain is savingly applied, it shall take away the sin and uncleanness of the people of God.</HI> This shall be the certain and unfailing operation of it. If ever the vertue of Christ's Redemption be communicated to any of the Children of men, it shall certain∣ly have this operation upon them; it is an in∣separable quality of the fountain. This Pro∣position may be laid open in the following Conclusions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the great errand on which Christ was sent into the world, was to take away the sins of his people.</HI> We have before observed that it was our sin that gave the occasion for the opening of this fountain, and why did Christ take an occasion from thence to appear in the state of a Redeemer, but that he might remove it? <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.29. <HI>Behold the Lamb of God, which ta∣keth away the sin of the world. Mat</HI> 1.21. <HI>He shall save his people from their sins.</HI> It was not to reconcile God to sin, but to reconcile Sin∣ners to God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. <HI>God was in Christ
<PB N="86" REF="000960_0089_0FADE615A13F71B0"/>
reconciling the world to himself</HI>; which reconci∣liation could be made in no other way, but by the removal of that which had made the distance, which was nothing else but sin, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.2. <HI>Your iniquities have separated between you and your God.</HI> It was because sin had made the world an Hospital, that Christ was sent into it to come as an healer, a <HI>Physician,</HI> and so he compares himself, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the whole business of his Humiliation was to enable him thus to do.</HI> Christ was not only to be the Physician, but the Physick too; all the sanative vertue by which Souls whom sin had deadlily wounded, might be cured, must proceed from him: there must there∣fore be such a vertue in him; and there must be an infinite <HI>fulness</HI> of it, that it might ex∣tend to all sin, and compleatly heal Sinners of it. He must <HI>be able to save to the uttermost, Heb.</HI> 7.25. And for this he must be a Divine person, cloathed with an Humane nature, and in that nature he must accomplish all that which was necessary for the fitting of him unto this great work. Now this he did in his state of Humiliation; the application of this belongs especially to his Exalted State, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.31. <HI>Him hath God exalted,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to give Repentance to Israel, and remission of sins</HI>; but he laid in for it in his humbled state, which was therefore introductory to the other, as we are told in <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.7, 8, 9. In this he made the
<PB N="87" REF="000960_0090_0FADE616962A1668"/>
atonement, without which Guilt could never have been removed; hitherto belongs that, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. He was <HI>made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God through him,</HI> in this his blood was made cleansing blood, for the purifying us from all our ini∣quities, according to, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.7. <HI>The Blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That the Reason of this was, because there were some that needed it, whom God purposed to make partakers in the benefits of it.</HI> As, if mans sin had not brought him to that exigency, that without such a fountain he must have pe∣rished for ever, Christ had not come; so, if God had not resolved to impart the efficacy of it to some such necessitous ones, he would never have been at the charge of providing it. God did not only intend the provision and exhibition of this fountain, that so if any would come to, and make use of it, they might be saved from their Sins by it; if that had been all, Christ had died in <HI>vain</HI>; for it is certain that none of fallen men would ever of their own accord come to him: that is true of all, till Christ draws them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have life:</HI> The natural man loveth his Sin, and delight∣eth to wallow in the mire of his uncleanness; but God chose some from eternity to be made the monuments of his rich Grace, in taking away all their iniquities; and he provided
<PB N="88" REF="000960_0091_0FADE617B4566830"/>
Christ for this end; and therefore all such as he designed this for, shall come to Christ, <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 6.37. <HI>All that the father hath given me, shall come unto me</HI>; they shall be cleansed, and wa∣shed and healed.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That they may partake in this benefit, there must be a saving application of the vertue of it to them.</HI> These waters quench the thirst of the Soul, by being drank of; they wash off the Guilt and filth which cleaves to the Soul, by being washed with them; they heal the mortal diseases which Sin had infected us withal, by the influence of the sanative ver∣tue of them on the Soul. It is not enough that they have all these good qualities in them: the Gospel therefore acquaints us with an <HI>Application</HI> consequent upon the <HI>Redemption</HI> wrought out by Christ, whereby he becomes ours, and we are saved by him; and hereup∣on life is restrained to our having of Christ, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.12. <HI>He that hath the Son, hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>It is savingly applied to those only who come to him by saving faith in him for it.</HI> Faith is the uniting Grace by which we are made one with Christ, and receive him to be our own for all the ends of his Mediatorship. This therefore is the great Gospel condition on which Christ is offered to be made ours, and we are given to understand, that if thus we do not receive him, we shall not partake in
<PB N="89" REF="000960_0092_0FADE618118951A0"/>
his saving mercies; <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. <HI>He that be∣lieves shall be saved, and he that believes not shall be damned.</HI> And as faith comes to Christ, so it draws the waters out of this fountain, it fetcheth in supplies from Christ continually, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.38. <HI>The Just shall live by his faith.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>God himself is the Author of this Faith in order to our participation in these benefits. Faith is not of our selves, it is the gift of God, Eph.</HI> 2.8. God by his Spirit puts this grace into us, and enables us to exert it, and that which he aims at in this, is to bring us to Christ by it, and so give us a title to these living wa∣ters, that they may be ours, and we may challenge a property in them, and make use of them for all our occasions continually.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Hence all that do thus come to him shall re∣ceive this vertue from him.</HI> Whosoever is uni∣ted unto Christ, the fountain of life, shall <HI>live by him</HI>: Where God gives faith, he gives all that is connected in the promise with it. All saving good is firmly promised to believing; God therefore on our believ∣ing, pardons our sin, the Guilt of it passeth off, our persons are freed from Condemnati∣on: and he sanctifies our hearts, by laying a foundation of holiness in us, which though imperfect at present, and mixed with defile∣ment, yet shall in due time aim at entire holi∣ness, without spot or blemish: Hence we have that title put upon believing, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.
<PB N="90" REF="000960_0093_0FADE61891CB0208"/>
39. <HI>We are of them that believe, to the Saving of the Soul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE. I.</HI> This may serve to Commend Christ to the Sinful Children of men, as a desirable object. And surely, there is nothing that can more set him forth as a suitable and necessary one, than this consideration. In nothing could he have been more accommodable to the con∣dition of fallen man, for his relief. Let then the contemplation of this draw your eyes and your hearts after him, and render him in your esteem most precious and desirable. And to this end Consider.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You are all by nature under the Guilt and de∣filement of Sin.</HI> This is the state of all mankind: and indeed, if we look upon Sin in its relati∣ons, it will infer this. As it relates to the Co∣venant of works, and the Sanctions of that, so it involves <HI>Guilt; Sin is the Transgression of the Law,</HI> and that Law hath ordained Death to be the wages of every Transgression of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23 <HI>The wages of sin is Death.</HI> And by ver∣tue of this Ordination, the Sinner is held a fast Prisoner of the Law, obnoxious to destructi∣on. And if we look upon Sin as it relates to the Sanctity or purity of the Law of God, so it <HI>pollutes</HI> the man, stains him with uncleanness. Now there is none of you but besides the im∣putation of the Guilt of the first Transgression, have a corrupt fountain of Original Sin in you,
<PB N="91" REF="000960_0094_0FADE61AF43FB3B0"/>
and innumerable actual pollutions, which you have made your selves odious withall: hence that, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.9. <HI>Who can say I have made mine heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Your misery is unconceivably great whiles you are under the Dominion of these.</HI> Indeed all mans misery began upon his Sinning: and there are two springs from whence all this in∣felicity flows, <HI>viz. Guilt</HI> and <HI>Filthiness,</HI> nor can it be taken off but by the removal of these. And one would think the greatness of your misery, should rouse you up to seek a deliver∣ance from it: and you may know that it is incomparably great by viewing the effects of it, which are;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By Sin you are exposed to the whole Curse of the Law.</HI> And that is of the very nature of Guilt that attends upon Sin, before it is par∣doned; for <HI>Guilt is nothing else but the binding of the curse upon the Sinner</HI>: And did you but know, or would you but look over and ponder upon the contents of the Curse, as it is record∣ed in the word of God, it would certainly fill you with terrours: It is contracted in a nar∣row word, <HI>Death,</HI> but if that word be spread abroad, and all the contents of it laid open to view, they will fill a prodigious Roll, such as that described in <HI>Zech.</HI> 5.2, 3. All the Evils of <HI>Loss</HI> and <HI>Sense</HI> which the Sinner can undergo, belong to it; all the sorrows that can betide either the body or the soul, are engrossed in
<PB N="92" REF="000960_0095_0FADE61BA3F0DDE0"/>
it; all the punishments in this life, and in ano∣ther world, relate to it: it hath its inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ations in time and the consummation of it is reserved for an amazing Eternity. This is your portion because of Sin; for all <HI>the wrath of God abides on you, Joh.</HI> 3.36.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>By Sin you are become vain and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>profitable: and this ariseth from the Uncleanness that adheres to it.</HI> For such a Creature as man, to live and be in vain, is an inexpressible misery; hence that complaint, <HI>Psal.</HI> 89▪47 <HI>Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</HI> It is acknowledged on all hands that mans formal happiness consists in <HI>Eupraxy</HI> or well doing; it was therefore his great priviledge that he was made at first every way fitted for it, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7.29. <HI>God made man upright David</HI> observes <HI>that in keeping the Commands of God there is a great reward, Psal.</HI> 19.11. To glori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> God is an happy employ∣ment; but Sin hath stript you of this power, and left you utterly unable for it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.23. <HI>All have sinned, and fallen short of the glory of God.</HI> And this hath brought the title o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Vain</HI> upon man, because by it he hath lost the end that he was directed to, and made for; and thus ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Sin put you below the most brutish of bruit Creatures, who do all in their sta∣tion and capacity glorify God: and were you not most stupid, you could not but bit∣terly bewail this infelici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of yours.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is no rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dying of your misery but by
<PB N="93" REF="000960_0096_0FADE61C57414328"/>
removing of these from you.</HI> The man must of necessity be unhappy, so long as there is a Sen∣tence of Death out against him, pronounced by the mouth of an holy and just God, and he goes every moment in danger of the execution of it upon him, and the power of the whole Creation cannot rescue him from it; and so it is with every Unregenerate one, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.21. <HI>There is no peace to the wicked saith my God.</HI> Nor can the sinner serve to the noble end of his being, so long as he is altogether unclean, and hath nothing on him but <HI>wounds, &amp; ulcers, and putrifying sores</HI>; whiles he is a slave to im∣pure lusts, he must needs endure a wretched bondage, and may well cry out as he in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.24. <HI>O wretched man that I am, who shall de∣liver me?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>This relief is to be had no where else.</HI> You may go through the world, and try every thing in it, and whatsoever other help you may possibly find in it, yet in this great case, and only distressing exigence, it can afford you none at all. There is no second being that can take away either the Guilt or the filth of Sin: the whole world will not make a price equivalent for the buying off the Sen∣tence that is upon you, and afford you Re∣demption, this is clearly intimated in <HI>Psal</HI> 49.6, 7. And the reason is given, <HI>Verse</HI> 8. <HI>For their Redemption is precious, and it ceaseth for ever.</HI> All your legal courses, will not take away the
<PB N="94" REF="000960_0097_0FADE61D43897CB0"/>
stain and defilement that is upon you by rea∣son of sin; what saith God to them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.22. <HI>Though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much sope, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This Fountain will answer both these ends compleatly.</HI> The vertue of it extends hither; and it must needs so do, because Gods Infinite wisdom provided it on purpose for this design, and he cannot fail of his end. <HI>David</HI> had contracted horrible Guilt, and polluted himself by his great sin, yet he presumes of being clean from both, if God will but apply this to him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51 7 <HI>Purge me with hyssope, and I shall be clean: wash me and I shall be whiter than the snow.</HI> The effectual application of this will take away sin so throughly, as if it had never been, for we are told in, <HI>Numb.</HI> 23.21 <HI>God hath seen no iniquity in Jacob, nor perverseness in Israel.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>And it stands Open to you for this end, and you are invited to come to it for this purpose</HI> God lays before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the matter of conviction of your great Guilt and contamination, to make you see your absolute need of this fountain; and that this Conviction may not drive you to discouraging distress, he bids you come to it, and apply your selves to obtain the vertue of it, and tells you what wonders it shall do for you upon this account, <HI>Isa</HI> 1.16. <HI>with</HI> 18. <HI>Wash you, make you clean,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Though your sins be

<P><HI>USE. II.</HI> We have here a Rule by which we may Try whether we have a true interest in this Fountain. And it very highly concerns every one to put himself upon this tryal; for Consider;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If you have no title to it, your condition is very fearfull.</HI> That Sin and Uncleanness under the efficacy whereof every unregenerate man abides, is certainly destructive to him: either it must be taken away, or it will work your eternal ruine. This is implyed, when God invites them to Repentance under that encou∣ragement, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.30. <HI>So iniquity shall not be your ruine.</HI> If this fountain had not been pre∣pared and opened, we had all perished without hope: and though there is a good hope set before all such as are pointed to it, and bidden to make use of it, yet if you do not comply with this offer, and receive Christ according to the tenour of it, you will miss of the benefit, and be undone for all. Christ expresly told them in, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.24. <HI>If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall dy in your sins.</HI> And I am sure, that man who dies in his sins is undone to all Eternity.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="96" REF="000960_0099_0FADE440D614AA08"/>2. <HI>If you think you have a Title, and are deceiv∣ed in it, your case is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to desperate.</HI> Of all men, there are none th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> stand in greater ha∣zard of unavoidable rui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, than such as nourish themselves with a good opinion of their safe estate, when it is far otherwise. This fosters in them a carnal confidence, which makes them to neglect that great duty, of <HI>giving all diligence to make their Calling and Election sure,</HI> which is required in, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1 10. This stifles all the Convictions that are offered in the Word and Ordinances, and they fly over their heads, as things which they reckon themselves uncon∣cerned in: and this is the reason why <HI>Publica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Harlots</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> receive the Calls of the Gospel than such as these, because these think that work is over already. And that there will be such self deceivers we are assured, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.26, 27 <HI>Then shall ye begin to say, we have eaten, and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets: but he shall say, I tell you I know you not, whence ye are,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>If indeed you have a Title to Christ, the knowledge of it will afford you much Consolation.</HI> And indeed, what comfort can be comparable to that of one who knows his <HI>Name to be written in Heaven, Luk.</HI> 10.20. That man who is <HI>in such a case,</HI> is happy indeed, beyond all danger of being ever miserable. Surely then, he who knows this to be his condition, cannot but <HI>Re∣joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with joy unspeakable, and full of glory.</HI> And
<PB N="97" REF="000960_0100_0FADE437741CAAF0"/>
for your help in this enquiry; observe;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If this Fountain be yours, you have come to it by a living Faith.</HI> It is offered to us in the Promise, and we receive it by believing. No unbeliever can lay any claim to it, but every true believer can. If you have received Christ, you have believed in him, and if you have be∣lieved in him, you are the Children of God, and heirs of the springs of Salvation, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12. <HI>As many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God, even to them that be∣lieve in his name.</HI> Coming to him, and believ∣ing on him are equivalent terms in the Gospel.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If you have come to him by faith aright</HI>; there are the things that have attended your so coming, and you must search for them:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Have you been acquainted with the proper end and usefulness of this fountain?</HI> True faith is distinguished from false, mainly by the end of it. All that pretend to come to Christ have something that moves them, and which they propose to get by coming; but that which true faith looks after is <HI>Life</HI>; others possibly have thought they did come to him, but it was only as one who, they hoped, would Save them from Hell: but if you have come right∣ly to him, it was to have your Sin and Un∣cleanness done away; and then it was your hearty cry, <HI>Hos.</HI> 14.3. <HI>Take away all iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Have you then felt your need of this Fountain for this end?</HI> It is apprehended want that
<PB N="98" REF="000960_0101_0FADE43859AB0B80"/>
driveth Sinners to Christ; and that which hath been their distressing trouble, will be the discovery of what they went to him for. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you have gone to him to take away your Sin &amp; Uncleanness, that hath been your burden, and you have been made to say, as he, <HI>Psal.</HI> 38.4. <HI>Mine iniquities are gone over mine head; as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</HI> And you have therefore valued this fountain for the vertue of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What are the Fruits of your coming?</HI> Doubt∣less that is a great truth which God hath re∣corded of himself, <HI>Isa.</HI> 45.19. <HI>I said not unto the seed of Jacob, seek ye me in vain.</HI> If you have come in faith, it hath had some success. It may be you value all success according as you experience, comforts and assurances com∣ing in upon your seeking to God, and if you want them, you fear that you have come in vain; but this is a mistake in your search. You came to have your sin purged, and if there be any thing of that done, you are so far an∣swered. Are you then more beaten off from your own Righteousness, and made more to depend upon that of Christ alone? Is sin more vile and hateful to you, and do you more loath your selves for it? If it be thus, then you have your end so far advanced, and be thankfull.</P>
<P><HI>USE. III.</HI> Let this serve to direct Sinners in their right coming to Christ, if they would

have him be a fountain of saving good to them. Herein only will Christ really profit us, if we may obtain Salvation by him; &amp; there is a so coming to him, if we would have grounded hopes of obtaining this benefit from him. And it is to be feared that many deceive themselves about this, who pretend to a great respect for Christ, and talk much of their trusting in him; but were never rightly in∣formed about him, and that for which he was manifested to us. Would you then come, and speed, and be happy in your coming to him, take these Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Take heed to your selves, what you come to him for.</HI> If you mistake here, you will put a cheat upon your own Souls. Christ indeed is a Foun∣tain, but of what? What was he opened for? that is it which you are encouraged by; and your ends must be the same with his, if you would not be disappointed. <HI>Hypocrites</HI> pretend much, but they ever impose upon themselves in this regard. If you come to Christ for Credit, and Ease, and Prosperity in this World, you will find your selves mi∣staken; he hath assured you that you shall meet with trouble and reproach, and many trials in his Service, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16. <HI>ult. In this world you shall have tribulation; his Kingdom is not of this world.</HI> If you come to him only to have your Sin pardoned, and not purged away, you will miss of your aim; for tho'
<PB N="100" REF="000960_0103_0FADE4396134DEA8"/>
he must apply a pardon to you, if ever you obtain it, yet his <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>San∣ctification</HI> are inseparable; and if you seek not the <HI>destruction</HI> as well as the <HI>remission</HI> of your sins, you will find your selves disap∣pointed. Be sure then to come for the purging away of your sins; that being par∣doned, you may <HI>Serve him in newness of life.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Come with an insatiable desire after the obtaining this of him.</HI> Labour to affect your hearts with the burden and bitterness of sin, and <HI>come</HI> as those <HI>that are weary and heavy laden</HI> by it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. God directs to such a sense in order to saving good, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Know and see, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God.</HI> Re∣solve that you can never be well till this ver∣tue derive from him to you, and let your cries be accordingly earnest, importunate, undeni∣able. Resolve that you will follow him inde∣fatigably, that you will never let him alone, nor give him any rest till he hath savingly applied the waters of this fountain to you.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Come with a firm Perswasion of his Suita∣bleness &amp; Sufficiency.</HI> You have seen that there is no such vertue to be found in all the worlds waters, now believe that he can do it for you; come as the Leper did, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.2 <HI>If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</HI> Look then upon him in his Person, in his Offices, and in the
<PB N="101" REF="000960_0104_0FADE43AA0B04558"/>
great work of Redemption, that was wrought out by him, and see how every way fit and able he is for this work; and let this make you fixedly to resolve that you will go no whither else, but that you will wait upon him, till he shall give you the experi∣ence of his love to you in this regard.</P>
<P><HI>USE IV. For</HI> Exhortation <HI>to the Children of God, who are already made partakers of an Inte∣rest in this fountain</HI>; in two particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Acknowledge the rich Grace of God to you, in that he hath not only opened this fountain before you, but in you.</HI> The former indeed is a great favour, and so to be confessed by all that par∣take in it; those that have it are highly ad∣vantaged, had they but an heart to make a right improvement of it; and if they do not so, they will bring great Guilt upon them∣selves by their contempt. How great a kind∣ness then is this that you share in? and do you endeavour to entertain it with suitable resentments: and there are among others, these two considerations which will greatly help you in your gratitude.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Had not God thus done for you, you had pe∣rished in your Sins.</HI> You were under the effica∣cy of sin and uncleanne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in your natural E∣state, and that held you under Guilt and De∣filement, and these would have wrought out your certain destruction, if they had not been
<PB N="102" REF="000960_0105_0FADE43AD8554B38"/>
remedied. There must be a fountain for this, else it could never have been taken away, a <HI>fountain of blood</HI> for the removal of your Guilt, and a <HI>fountain of grace</HI> for the purging away of your pollution. None else but Christ could possi∣bly be such a fountain to you; there is an in∣finite value and vertue requisite to be found in that which can do this for you, which no meerly created being could ever attain unto. If this Fountain had not been revealed to you, you could not have partaken in the sa∣ving vertue of it, because it is applied by faith: they that live out of the reach of the Gospel Dispensation, die without knowledge; and if it had not been opened in you, you had still died in your sins; there are multi∣tudes that do so who have <HI>heard of it with the hearing of the ear,</HI> because they have not cordially embraced it: if he had not savingly applied it to you, you had refused it as well as others, for you had as great a natural ma∣lignity in you against it as any in the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What are you better than others who are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus favoured?</HI> The difference that is put be∣tween you and them is very great, but who hath made it? When he brought this grace of his unto you, you <HI>were dead in trespasses and sins, Eph.</HI> 2.1. When he offered it to you, you regarded it not, but <HI>bad him to depart from you</HI>; you sought it not of him, but he sought you up that he might bestow it upon
<PB N="103" REF="000960_0106_0FADE43B9BD14EB0"/>
you; you gave him all the resistance that an heart full of enmity could do. It was Al∣mighty power that brought you unto it, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possibly you more dishonoured God, by pe∣culiar wickedness, and scandalous provocati∣ons, before such time as he thus appeared to you, than a great many have done, whom he yet hath not so favoured. Can you then suffici∣ciently celebrate his praise?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Be sure to make continual use of it.</HI> You will always stand in need of it, and it ever stands open for you to repair unto, and there is a double usefulness which it serves unto.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Repair constantly to it for renewed pardon.</HI> It was not sufficient that you did so apply to it in your first Conversion; for, though it was then applied to you for the Justification of your persons, yet.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You Sin daily.</HI> Though lust be mor∣tified as to the Dominion of it, yet it is not abolished in you, but hath its dayly breakings out: there is a contrary part in you, that is ever and anon bringing you into captivity. We are told, in <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7.20. <HI>There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not</HI>; and the reason of it is, because there is a <HI>Flesh</HI> in us that is always <HI>lusting against the Spi∣rit, Gal.</HI> 5.17.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Every Sin offers matter of provocatinn to God.</HI> It is a Transgression of his holy Law; it is an <HI>abominable thing</HI> to him, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.4.
<PB N="104" REF="000960_0107_0FADE43D071A4C60"/>
It is that which he <HI>cannot endure,</HI> Hab. 1.13. And though he knows our frame, and will not be always contending with us, or break out in his severity for every frailty of ours; yet there is occasion offered him for his anger, and we must confess with him, <HI>Psalm</HI> 130.3. <HI>If thou Lord, shouldst mark iniquities; Oh Lord, who should stand?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence it calls on you to seek of him For∣giveness.</HI> And this is at least, one main rea∣son, why we are daily and on all occasions to renew that petition, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.12. <HI>Forgive us our debts</HI>: And hence how often have we <HI>David</HI> asking pardon of God, though he was in a state of Justification?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Here only can you obtain it.</HI> You must come to the fountain for it. Whensoever Gods ancient people fell into any sin, there was a Sacrifice presently to be offered for A∣tonement, in order to its being forgiven: and <HI>if we sin,</HI> we must go to this <HI>Advocate,</HI> and make use of him as <HI>our Propitiation,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.1, 2.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Address him continually for the washing of Sanctification.</HI> They that are Sanctified, must be Sanctified again; they were so for whom the Apostle prays, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.23. <HI>The very God of peace Sanctifie you wholly, &amp;c.</HI> There is yet a body of death in you, a fountain of unclean∣ness: and there are the eruptions of it in your actions, which defile you, and you want wa∣shing. Hence,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="105" REF="000960_0108_0FADE43D694CDC58"/>1. <HI>Come hither by the Repentance of faith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in every notable def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lement.</HI> Are you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with any Temptation which draws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the mire? let this drive you to the fountain for cleansing: and this must be by the re∣newal of Repentance: thus did <HI>David, Psal.</HI> 51.7. And this is the only way to purifie your selves, which is the care of every believer, 1 <HI>Joh</HI> 3.3. <HI>He that hath this hope in him, puri∣fieth himself, as he is pure.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Wash in it dayly for your daily pollution.</HI> There is a defilement that cleaves to every thing we do: when we are never so careful to our selves, Sin in us will pollute our best Services. <HI>Paul</HI> complains, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.21. <HI>I find a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.</HI> This therefore should bring you to Christ continually for cleansing.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Be evermore fetching from hence all the Grace you need to perfect you in Holiness.</HI> Let the sense of remaining corruption, put you upon the exercise of renewed and progres∣sive Sanctification; for which you must re∣pair to this fountain of Grace, and apply the promises by which you partake in it, to this end, according to, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.1. <HI>Having th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se promises, let us cleanse our selves from all fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</HI> And never cease from the pursuit of this work, till sin be no more in you, and grace be arrived at its full degree of perfection.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE V. There will be a more peculiar Opening of Christ as a Fountain of Life, when the JEWS shall be Called.</HEAD>
<P>THat the <HI>Prophesy</HI> contained in this and the foregoing <HI>Chapter,</HI> hath a special respect to that Nation, who were the Posteri∣ty of <HI>Abraham,</HI> according to the Flesh, is ge∣nerally agreed on by Christians, and acknow∣ledged by their own Writers; and that what∣soever Earnests there have been, yet th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> com∣pleat accomplishment of it, is still to come.</P>
<P>There are two Propositions in this Doctrine which may be briefly illustrated, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there is a great and general Calling of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> JEWS yet to come</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>That when that time comes, there shall be a more peculiar Opening of this fountain.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION. I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That there is a great and general Calling of the JEWS yet to come.</HI> As there was a time when God rejected them, for the horrible contempt which they cast upon Christ and his Gospel, in which they were made a scorn and a re∣proach to the world, and were dispersed from one end of the earth to another; so there will
<PB N="107" REF="000960_0110_0FADE442585ABDC0"/>
a time come when there shall be a National return of them to God, and they shall accept of Christ for their Lord and Saviour. The truth of this hath been, and still is denyed, and strenuously oppugned by some; and the seemingly long delay of it, hath made many to hesitate about it; and it is not to be won∣dred at, for Christ predicted, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.8. <HI>When the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the Earth?</HI> Which some have interpreted to have a respect to the belief of this truth. But there are others who with as great vi∣gour defend it, and have solidly confuted all the pretended pleadings against it; and al∣though it be not a <HI>Fundamental Article</HI> of Sal∣vation, yet there is so much of Consolation arising from it to the people of God, in these dark days of tribulation upon the Church of Christ, that it is worth our while a little to refresh our selves with the speculation of it▪ And here let me premise, That this truth is purely of <HI>Revelation,</HI> and the Credit of it de∣pends entirely on the <HI>Divine Testimony</HI>; we must therefore <HI>Search the Scriptures,</HI> if we would know whether it be so. And among many Scripture confirmations of it, give me leave to offer a few Considerations; and to make way to this. Observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there are many texts of Scripture which are to be understood of the Spiritual</HI> Israel. The whole mystical body of Christ, made up of
<PB N="108" REF="000960_0111_0FADE44317486360"/>
both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> are frequently called the <HI>Israel</HI> of God, and the <HI>Seed of Abraham.</HI> This must not be denyed; for, as God first Chose that Nation to be <HI>a peculiar people</HI> to himself; so he hath seen meet to put their Name upon the Church, even in Gospel times: and there are some places that cannot bear a∣nother interpretation; See, <HI>Gal</HI> 6.16 <HI>Peace be on them, and on the Israel of God.</HI> We are told of a <HI>Jew outwardly,</HI> and one that is so <HI>inwardly, Rom.</HI> 2.28. And in <HI>Chap.</HI> 9.6. <HI>All are not Israel that are of Israel.</HI> Accordingly there are Prophesies in which Gospel Ordinan∣ces are represented under legal expressions, but must be spiritually interpreted; such is that, <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.11. <HI>In every place incense shall be offered unto my Name, and a pure offering.</HI> And some think that the last <HI>Eight Chapters</HI> in the Pro∣phesies of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> are so to be understood.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There are Promises made to the Jews which did properly refer to their return from</HI> Babylon. There was such a return afforded them after their Captivity by <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> and God before hand gave them many supports, and encouraging promises about it, wherein he prefixed the time when, and the manner how it should be brought about; and there are many discourses in the Prophets which had a proper and direct aim at it: we are therefore told how <HI>Daniel,</HI> by reading of these Prophe∣sies, &amp; making a Calculation from them, came
<PB N="109" REF="000960_0112_0FADE443CF94F7C8"/>
to know that time to be near its accomplish∣ment, <HI>Dan</HI> 9.2. <HI>I Daniel understood by books the number of the years,</HI> &amp;c <HI>that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolation of Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There are Predictions of glorious Things in the Gospel day, that had a special reference to the Power and Efficacy of the word in the</HI> Apostles <HI>times.</HI> The bringing in of the Gospel dispen∣sation, and the great changes that were wrought thereby, was a matter of Admiration, and was therefore often foretold in the <HI>Old-Testament</HI>: and on this account we are acquain∣ted that these and those things were the ful∣filling of such and such Prophesies: particular∣ly, the astonishing <HI>giving of the Holy Ghost,</HI> ap∣pearing in the <HI>Fiery Tongues</HI> given the Apostles soon after Christs Ascention, of which <HI>Peter</HI> gives that account, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.16. &amp;c. <HI>This is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>There are Texts of Scripture that have their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>veral degrees of accomplishment.</HI> Though there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but one thing that is ultimately designed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and till that be brought about, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpleatly fulfilled; yet they shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in some preludious Providences, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in them a <HI>Specimen</HI> of the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and are, as it were, <HI>Earnests</HI> of what is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and so one and the same word may be said to have been accomplished more than once: though that which it mainly in∣tended
<PB N="110" REF="000960_0113_0FADE44493044170"/>
is still expected; which might be instanced in divers particulars</P>
<P>Now from what hath been said, we may proceed to the thing in hand: and in general, observe, That though there be a <HI>Mystical</HI> sense in some Prophesies about <HI>Israel,</HI> yet they go too far, who would restrain all altogether to this, as those do who deny this Doctrine: yea there is a <HI>Compound sense</HI> in many of these things, and they aim both at the one and the other: and though divers things did refer to the return from <HI>Babylon,</HI> yet not all, but some look farther; yea even those that engross tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in them, have a longer reach in them, many of them: and though some things had thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fulfillment in the days of <HI>Christ</HI> &amp; his <HI>Apostles,</HI> yet others had not, but still remain to be brought to pass; and those which then had a beginning have a greater f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llness behind; and that the calling of the JEWS is one of these will be evident, if we consider.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>That there is a Calling of the JEWS men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tioned distributively with that of the Gentiles</HI>▪ and therefore it must be li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erally understood with respect to that Nation, and cannot be re∣strained to the <HI>Mystical</HI> bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Christ, which comprehends all of both sorts in it. This is designedly han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led by the Apostle in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. The thing he there aims at, is to shew that God hath not utte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly cast off that Nation, and he argues it from the reason of their being cast
<PB N="111" REF="000960_0114_0FADE445AD99B0D8"/>
off, <HI>Verse</HI> 11, 12. <HI>Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid, &amp;c.</HI> He therefore as¦serts that there will be a time when they shall be restored again to a Church state, and return into favour with God; for which he also brings Scripture evidence, <HI>Verse</HI> 25, 26. <HI>Blind∣ness in part is hapned to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; &amp; so all Israel shall be sa∣ved as it is written, &amp;c.</HI> Nor can these things be understood <HI>Allegorically,</HI> without violence done to the whole scope of the context.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There is a Calling of the JEWS foretold to be in the days of the Gospel.</HI> Their call and re∣turn from <HI>Babylon</HI> was before Christs coming in our flesh, but there is another spoken of which is to be after that, and therefore God makes mention of doing it a second time, <HI>Isa.</HI> 11.11, 12. <HI>The Lord shall set his hand again the Second time, to recover the remnant of his people, from Assyria, and from Egypt, &amp;c.</HI> And he saith that this <HI>shall come to pass in that day</HI>: which the whole context assures us, is the day of the Gospel after Christ had appeared in our nature: and doubtless whatsoever was Prophesied con∣cerning that People, after their return to their Land must look forward; and many things cannot be understood of any but the Gospel day: and such is our <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Context</HI>; inas∣much as <HI>Zechariah</HI> was one of these Prophets who Prophesied to the returned Captivity; and the tenour of this particular Vision of his
<PB N="112" REF="000960_0115_0FADE4465256A038"/>
points us to the day when Christ had been Crucified among them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>There is a Calling of the JEWS mentioned, that is to be after they had been Rejected, and Dis∣sipated, for their Despising of Christ.</HI> And there∣fore the Casting them off, or unchurching them, and this return of theirs are joyned to∣gether; yea the Apostle in the forecited <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. brings this in as a relief against desponden∣cy, with respect unto the former, where he purposely speaks of their being cut off, and tells us that they shall be grafted in again: See in particular, <HI>Verse</HI> 15, 16. and <HI>Verse</HI> 24. This also is the Call which our <HI>Text</HI> points to, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> evident from, <HI>Chap</HI> 12.10 <HI>&amp;c</HI> Christ there∣fore so speaks of their Rejection as that which had a limited time, <HI>Luk.</HI> 21.24. <HI>Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>There is a National Calling of them spoken of.</HI> There were indeed many of them effectu∣ally Called by Christ and his Apostles, and many that believed in those days; <HI>Three thou∣sand</HI> were <HI>added</HI> at one time, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.41. And <HI>Five thousand</HI> at another time, <HI>Acts</HI> 4 4 Besides many more upon other occasions; <HI>Acts</HI> 2.4. <HI>The Lord added dayly to the Church such as should be saved.</HI> But all this while the Nation stood off, and did not embrace Christ; that there∣fore is yet to come On this account the A∣postle in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. having in the beginning of
<PB N="113" REF="000960_0116_0FADE448D46B8230"/>
the Chapter proved that they were not utterly cast off, because there were so many called al∣ready, proceeds from <HI>Verse</HI> 11. to tell us of a more general return of them, and assures us that it shall be <HI>All Israel, Verse</HI> 26. Not as if every individual shall thus <HI>be Saved,</HI> but the body of that Nation that shall then be living.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>There are such things asserted in the word of God concerning this Call, as have never yet been accomplished.</HI> The happy state of that forlorn Nation, is so set forth as it never arrived to, after their return from <HI>Babylon,</HI> till their being cut off from being a People by the <HI>Romans.</HI> To this we may refer the Prophesy in, <HI>Isa</HI> 65.18. <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd.</HI> And that, <HI>Hos.</HI> 3.4, 5. And that, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.6, 7, 8. Which must needs refer to times yet unfulfilled, for hitherto they are the most scattered, contemptible and scorned peo∣ple in the whole World, and have so continu∣ed for more than <HI>Sixteen hundred years.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>To all let me add, That the Providence of God towards them is to be adored, in that they remain to be a distinct People to this day.</HI> Not∣withstanding all the Calamities that have be∣fallen them, and the horrible Dispersions of them upon the face of the Earth, yet they keep themselves a Separate People in Life, manners, and customs, divers from other Na∣tions; which certainly must be for some glo∣rious end designed by the all-wise God: and what shall we suppose it to be, but that which is thus fore-signifyed?</P>

<P><HI>That when that time comes, there shall be a more peculiar Opening of this Fountain.</HI> There is something to be done in that day, which was never before done in this regard; and that must be with regard to the manner and degree of the manifestation and application of it.

<P N="1">1. <HI>That there are happy Times predicted for the Church, after her wilderness estate shall be over.</HI> As there was a time, when after God had brought his People out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> they went through the wilderness, in order to their glo∣rious Settlement in <HI>Canaan,</HI> so we are told of the Gospel Church, that soon after its being called it should go into the wilderness, and be there for a prefixed time, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.6. <HI>The wo∣men fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared of God, that they should f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.</HI> But God hath promised to it in this world, a more glorious Conspicuous state after these days are ended; and this is celebrated in the four last <HI>Chapters</HI> of that book: and this by some is supposed to be aimed at in, <HI>Cant.</HI> 8.5. <HI>Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?</HI> It being a thing that shall be very surprizing to all that shall observe it.

<P N="2">2. <HI>That these glorious things have not as yet befallen it in their compleat Accomplishment.</HI> I dare not deny, but that there are some things spoken in the Scriptures concerning the Church of God, that must be referred to the <HI>Triumph∣ant</HI> state of it, and it would be a delusion to apply them to its <HI>Militancy.</HI> There must also be an allowance made for our supposing the Spirit of God, who condescends to speak to us in our own Language, to use <HI>Hyperbolical</HI> expressions, and set forth the better condition of the <HI>Militant</HI> Church upon Earth, with words borrowed from the state of Glory to which it shall at length arrive: but we must not think that he goes about to delude us with flourishing Promises, and then put us off with low and little performances. There have in∣deed been wonderful accomplishments for the Church in these latter days, peculiarly since the beginning of the Reformation; but these are little in comparison with the things fore∣told to be brought to pass; we are therefore to look for a transcendently greater Glory be∣hind, and making hast to appear.

In what order these shall be brought about, I dispute not; but God will doubtless prepare the way to the destruction of the Man of Sin who stands in the way, by giving an enlarged Commission for the Preaching of the Everlas∣ting Gospel, which shall <HI>Call</HI> his out of <HI>Baby∣lon,</HI> and convince the Great Ones of their e∣gregious folly in <HI>giving their power to the Beast,</HI> and provoking them to reassume it; which Preaching shall also Call in the Nations of the World that at present are Unconverted; by which the <HI>JEWS</HI> shall likewise be affected, and perswaded to come in with them unto Christ. These things to be sure will be closely connected, and one of them follow upon the other. The Apostle tells us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.25. <HI>Blindness in part is hapned to Israel, till the ful∣ness of the Gentiles be come in</HI>; and <HI>verse</HI> 30, 31. <HI>As ye in times past have not believed God, yet now have obtained mercy through their unbe∣lief, even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy, they may also obtain mercy.</HI> And now it is that these blessed days shall Commence: and therefore when the <HI>Whore is Judged, great Salvations come in,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> are brought in, together with the Gentiles to Celebrate it with their <HI>Hallelujah's, Rev.</HI> 19.1, 3, 4, 6.

<P N="4">4. <HI>That the Happiness of those times will be mainly Spiritual.</HI> Not but that there will be an External Glory then afforded to the Church of God; that is the time when <HI>God will say to Zion, arise and shine, Isa.</HI> 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.1 Then will that prediction be fulfilled in, <HI>Isa.</HI> 2.2. <HI>The Mountain of the Lords House shall be established in the top of the Mountains, and shall he Exalted above the Hills, and all Nations shall flow to it</HI>; and that, <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.3 <HI>The Mountains shall bring forth peace to the people</HI>; and <HI>v.</HI> 7. <HI>In his days shall the Righte∣ous flourish and abundance of peace, so long as the Moon endureth.</HI> Then shall <HI>Satan be bound, and the haters of God shall feign Obedience, and his enemies lick the dust.</HI> Then will that be understood and experienced, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 28.24. <HI>There shall be no more a pricking briar unto the House of Israel, nor any grieving thorn, &amp;c.</HI> But the great glory of these times will be, that Grace will then flourish, and holiness abound.

<P N="2">2. <HI>There have been the gradual Communicati∣ons of this good to the Church and People of God in all Generations.</HI> This fountain hath been and continueth opened to some or other of fallen men from the beginning; and the ma∣nifestations and operations of it have been sometimes more, sometimes less: but there will be more of it than ever in these days; yea it will then arrive to a fulness, not of ab∣solute, but comparative perfection.</P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>In respect of Efficacy.</HI> The vertue of this fountain shall then appear abundantly; the pardoning and sanctifying influence of it shall be to admiration, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.9. <HI>Every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live.</HI> The Spirit will then mightily accompany the dispensation of the Gospel, and Conversions will not be so rare and dubious as now they are, nor the lives of Christians so barren, but then will those Pro∣phesies have a wonderful accomplishment, <HI>Isa.</HI> 32.15, <HI>&amp;c.

<P><HI>USE I.</HI> This Doctrine affords matter of great Consolation to the Children of God under the present evil days.

of heart?</HI> If we look on the present state of Christianity in the world, it appears with a black face; and if we stint our speculations here, it will sink us in despondency; but let us look forward, and we may gather abun∣dant refreshment. Consider then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There are better times yet to come.</HI> It is <HI>night</HI> at present, and the <HI>terrours</HI> of it are apt to affright us; but the Day will break, and let us refresh our selves with that consideration, <HI>Psal.</HI> 30.5. <HI>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</HI> God hath said in, <HI>Psal.</HI> 125.3. <HI>The rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous.</HI> And the Psalmist resolves, <HI>Psal.</HI> 102.13. <HI>Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon</HI> Zion; and 94.14. <HI>The Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</HI> The whole <HI>Creation groans</HI> for this day, and we ought to live upon the <HI>hope</HI> of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.19, 23, Nor need we to fear whether it shall be accomplished, for God hath engaged in it; and we are told, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.7. <HI>The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It will not be long before these days Com∣mence.</HI> Although we cannot tell the day, or month, or year when that time shall be, yet we are fully assured that it is hastening.

predictions, of things that were to intervene and make way to it, have already received their fulfilment? and we may expect that God will make a short work of it, when it draws nigh its accomplishment. Nor need the present face of things, though dismal, af∣fright us; or make us think it afar off, for how often is the darkest part of the night just before the day breaks? and therefore the Church acknowledgeth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 126.1. <HI>When the Lord turned again the captivity of</HI> Zion, <HI>we were like those that dream.</HI></P>

make his remarks on the times that he lives in, &amp; which pass over him, &amp; to judge of them whether the days are good or evil: The ge∣nerality of men take their measures from the observation of outward Providence; if there be outward peace &amp; plenty, they call them happy days; if outward distress and trouble, they call them evil: but we have a better Rule, and more safe for Christians, and that is, to judge according as this fountain is opened a∣mongst us. The more of Christ that a peo∣ple enjoy, the happier are they, and the less he is known and acknowledged in his great design of <HI>Mediatorship,</HI> the greater is the infe∣licity of such a people; <HI>and by this Rule I be∣lieve the times are evil in the most places that are called Christian</HI>; inasmuch as it is a day where∣in the greatest number of those that should preach the Doctrines of Christ, of Redem∣tion, Justification, Sanctification, and Eter∣nal Life to be obtained by him, and so to be the instruments of opening the Foun∣tain to men; do rather endeavour to ob∣scure them, by perverting the great Doct∣rine of Justification by his Righteousness a∣lone, and confounding New Covenant Obe∣dience with meer Morality, or a legal Righ∣teousness. How contrary are these things to those which will be the glory of the Times of refreshment!</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="000960_0127_0FADE5AF55FBF5D0"/><HI>USE. III.</HI> For <HI>Exhortation</HI> to the People of God in two particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be Exhorted to Pray much and earnestly for the Conversion of the JEWS.</HI> This duty seems to be too much neglected in these days; and possibly one great reason of it is, because the belief of this Article runs so low in the Christi∣an world. Be we then roused up to this duty: and there are these Considerations which are very profitable for this end.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The thing is a matter of Faith, and so it Calls for Prayer.</HI> It as a truth not to be doubt∣ed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, since God hath given us the assurance of it in his word, and we ought to <HI>Receive his Testimony,</HI> and thereby <HI>Set to our Seal that he is True.</HI> Now the things that we believe, be∣cause God hath promised them, and which are future, are such things as are proper for us to pray for: they are good in themselves, and worth the des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing; &amp; the strength of Prayer is in this belief: yea this is the way in which God hath said that he will communicate the good promised to his people, <HI>Ezek</HI> 36.37. <HI>I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ael, to do it for them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They once Prayed for us, we therefore owe this duty to them.</HI> There was a time when <HI>God only kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w them of all the Families of the earth</HI>; the Gentiles were <HI>far off:</HI> then they prayed that we might be brought in to Christs

fold; and among others, <HI>Psal.</HI> 67. is a Prayer of the Church of the <HI>Jews</HI> on this account: surely then it is but a due requital for us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Their Miserable Condition Calls for it:</HI> They are objects of compassion, and every tender heart cannot but condole them: nor is it like to be better with them till the happy day of their Conversion cometh. And well may we use a like expostulation which Christ, the An∣gel of the Covenant once did for them of old when in distress, <HI>Zech.</HI> 1.12. <HI>O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem; against which thou hast had indignation.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Benefit which shall come with their Con∣version, to the Gentile Churches, is our great encou∣ragement to importunity in it.</HI> There was no little advantage by their casting off, but the Apostle assures us that their grafting in shall be transcendently more, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.15. <HI>If the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</HI> Surely then we pray for our selves, when we pray for them; and one would think that Interest would not ly.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>These happy Times are to be ushered in by Prayer.</HI> God is well pleased in our Praying for them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 122.6. <HI>Pray for the Peace of Je∣rusalem; they shall prosper that love thee.</HI> And he hath told us, that such a spirit shall be pre∣paratory to that happy day, and help to bring

it in; <HI>Isa.</HI> 62 6, 7. <HI>I have set watchmen upon they walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the Lord keep not silence, and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</HI> When therefore God shall pour out such a spirit of Prayer on his people in this regard▪ it will be a blessed Prognostick of that glorious time, hastening.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let it encourage all that are Godly to leave their Children behind them with Faith and Comfort.</HI> We are some of us going off the stage, and are very sollicitous what shall become of ours when we are gone. There are many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adning considerations that appear in our view, which do sometimes fill us with perplexity; but let such as fear God look through and beyond the present discouragmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and comfort themselves with such thoughts as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese: not only do we leave our Children to a good God, a Covenant keeping God, whose truth and faithfulness we may sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely rely upon; but it is comfort for us to think that that day is not far off; and though we may not live to see the dawnings of it, yet our Posterity may see the breaking of it, and partake in the happy benefits that it shall b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to the Church of God: to nou∣rish our fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h with the contemplation of the glorious dispensations which there shall be in that day, when God will bring his Church out of darkness, into light, and take them out of

<HEAD>DOCTRINE. VI. When God hath brought his Chosen to bewail their Sins, especially the Affronts which they have <HI>Offered</HI> to Christ, and to Pray to him for Mercy, he will then make a gracious Discovery of this Fountain to them.</HEAD>
<P>THE rise of this <HI>Doctrine</HI> is from the Cohe∣rence of the <HI>Text</HI> with that which went before. God had promised to pour out such a spirit upon them, <HI>Chap.</HI> 12.10 <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And here he tells us that in that day this <HI>Fountain shall be
<PB N="128" REF="000960_0131_0FADE5B1E88E62A0"/>
Opened.</HI> In the former Doctrine we consider∣ed this benefit as it refers to the Church in ge∣neral, and particularly to Gods Ancient peo∣ple, considered as a People: In this we come to take an account of it as it refers to Persons, and is applyed to men in <HI>Conversion</HI>; which we are to suppose to be included in the former, as the spiritual aim of it. And that we may come at the right sense of this Doctrine, ob∣serve these Conclusions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there are those whom God hath chosen in Christ, to be made partakers in his saving bene∣fits.</HI> We before observed that if we would take the Considera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the great affair of Gods grace appearing in the good will that he manifests to sinful man, at the rise of it, we must follow it up to the eternal purpose of God, in which the whole Scheam of it was laid out. Now in this purpose of his there was a designation of them that should be the subjects in whom this Grace was to shine forth; and accordingly all was accommoda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for the illustration of it in such a subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct. When therefore the Apostle discourseth of these <HI>Spi∣ritual Blessings,</HI> he runneth them up hither, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.3 4 <HI>According as he hath chosen us in Christ</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Christ must be Opened to these as a Fountain for Sin and Uncleanness, in order to their being Saved by him.</HI> Salvation supposeth some∣thing that they are to be Saved from, which is their present misery. He that is under no
<PB N="129" REF="000960_0132_0FADE5B312707580"/>
evil, needeth no Salvation; they are only the distressed that want it, or will be advantaged by it. And this Salvation must be applyed to the removal of that from which the evil de∣rives: now that which is mans infelicity de∣rives from Sin and Uncleanness; it is the <HI>Guilt</HI> and the <HI>Pollution</HI> of sin that hurts them. As therefore Christ is appointed for this, so he must be discovered to them as such a one, how else shall they accept of and entertain him as so? which they must do, if ever he profit them; for it is by faith that they receive him, and so are advantaged by him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That there is a time when God will Open and Apply Christ to these.</HI> They are born in their natural estate strangers to Christ, and far from Salvation, <HI>Eph</HI> 2.3. <HI>We were Children of wrath, even as others.</HI> They may live a great while in their Alienation from him, and refuse him, though he offers himself unto them: they ever do so till he comes with power. But be∣cause he hath chosen them to obtain Salvation by Christ, he will therefore bring them to this Fountain, and make them to partake in a title to it, and effectual influences of it upon them: Our Saviour hath plumply asserted that in, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.37. <HI>All that the Father hath given me shall come unto me</HI> If Election hath pitched upon a person, Vocation will without fail, sooner or later find him out, and bring him home.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="130" REF="000960_0133_0FADE5B38F03DF40"/>4. <HI>That in order to his so Opening this Fountain, he will produce the fore cited effects in them, by the power of his Spirit,</HI> viz. <HI>a spirit of Mourning, and a spirit of Supplication.</HI> This is the way in which he makes Christ Effectual in men, for the ends of his being a fountain to them.</P>
<P>Now for our right taking up of this order, Let us observe in general, That we are con∣sidering of such as are converted to God, under and by the dispensation of the Gospel and Ordinances, and the effectual application of them. As for Gods proceeding with Elect Infants, who dy before they are capable of being so treated, we are not now enquiring after that. Here then more particularly let these things be considered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That we must distinguish between the Open∣ing of the Fountain</HI> Doctrinally, <HI>and</HI> Savingly. As to the outward discoveries of Christ which are made in the Gospel and Ordinances, they are made to all promiscuously to whom the means of Grace are sent, and the great truths which concern Christ and Salvation by him are urged upon them: but where the Spirit of God doth inwardly reveal Christ in the Souls of any, and makes them sharers in his Salvation, he always b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings them to such a frame: such therefore are the only blessed ones, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.4 <HI>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That we must distinguish between</HI> Passive
<PB N="131" REF="000960_0134_0FADE5B6B9D217F0"/>
<HI>and</HI> Active <HI>Conversion</HI> This distinction is ge∣nerally received among the Orthodox, and by all them who acknowledge that there are the <HI>Habits</HI> of Saving Grace infused into us, in order to our being able to exert Grace in our lives; and the Apostle plainly shews the dif∣ference, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.25. <HI>If we live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit. Passive Conversion</HI> then is that Change which is made in us in <HI>Regenera∣tion,</HI> by the infusion of all saving Graces into us, of which it is said, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17. <HI>If any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new Creature. Active Conversion</HI> consists in the exerting and exercising of these Graces. The former is done by the Spirit alone; in the latter he co operates with us. And we may take from hence this brief accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the present affair.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Gods Elect do many times long de∣spise the offers of Christ that are made to them in the Gospel.</HI> God will have his own to know, that their Conversion, as well as their Salvation, is of Grace, and that they have a nature in them as full of obstinacy and enmity as others: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he therefore leaves them for a season, to <HI>resist his Spirit,</HI> and to shew the desperate malignity that is in them; and they neglect the things of their peace, withstand the offers of a Saviour, and quench the motions of the Spirit in them, that ac∣company the Calls of the Gospel This <HI>E∣phraim</HI> confesseth of himself, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18. <HI>Thou

<P N="2">2. <HI>That there are some common legal works wrought in the Elect, antecedent to their Regene∣ration, or Passive Conversion.</HI> The Spirit of God is wont to begin with men by Convicti∣ons and Terrors, by setting the Law home on their Consciences, which make them afraid: and those are wrought not only in Gods Children, but in others also; and the Elect themselves do too frequently stifle these moti∣ons, out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grow these awakenings, and return again to their former security: the time of their new<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>birth is not yet come, and God hereby lets them see what enemies they are to their own Salvation, and that if he had not come with Almighty Efficacy to them, they had refused him to their destruction, as well as others. How many such common works have some out-grown; and become worse after them? and yet they have had their <HI>months</HI> in which God hath <HI>taken</HI> them, because he had an Immutable love for them. See for this, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.17, 18. <HI>I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart: I have seen his ways, and will heal him.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="133" REF="000960_0136_0FADE5B7D81A78A0"/>3. <HI>That all saving qualifications are wrought in them at once, in Passive Conversion.</HI> When the Spirit of God comes to produce this great Change in the Sinner, he infuseth into him all his Sanctifying Graces: there is a <HI>new man created in him, Eph.</HI> 4.24. There is a perfecti∣on of parts, though not of degrees: <HI>Sanctifi∣cation is throughout,</HI> 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.23. There is therefore no order in the production of these saving qualities in the Soul, but they come in all at once. In Conversion <HI>whole Christ is put on,</HI> it is therefore called a <HI>new birth, Joh.</HI> 3.3. And it is the babe of Grace which is born, and it hath all its members entire.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That God draws the man to exert these Graces in Active Conversion, after the manner of a Rational Agent.</HI> In the exerting of Grace, the man is not only <HI>active,</HI> but <HI>voluntary</HI> too; he acts as a cause by Counsel. As therefore there is the Co-operation of God in this, as well as his operation in the former, according to, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.13. <HI>It is God which worketh in you, to will and to do, of his own good pleasure.</HI> So he works upon the Rational Faculties or Pow∣ers that are put into man; and having sancti∣fied them, he draws them forth to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the new nature into act, upon sight, deliberation, and with perswasion. He is not drawn to it by meer instinct, but he knows what he doth, and why he doth it: he hath a foundation on which he acts every Grace; he knows whom
<PB N="134" REF="000960_0137_0FADE5B893C74350"/>
he believes, in, and why he so doth, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.12. <HI>I know whom I have believed, and am per∣swaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day</HI>; and so of the rest. God is therefore said to <HI>draw us with the cords of a man, Hos.</HI> 11.4.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>In this Conversion the Soul betakes it self to Christ by faith, as to a Fountain opened for Sin and for Uncleanness.</HI> The great Grace celebra∣ted in the Gospel is <HI>Faith,</HI> by which we close with Christ for life, wherein we comply with the main Article of the New-Covenant; and therefore Salvation is ascertained to it, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Whosoever believes in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI> This Grace is not before the others in being, though it leads in the exercise, and doth indeed influence all the o∣ther, being that which fetcheth in help from Christ for the acting of them. Now Christ is the immediate Object on whom Faith fix∣eth; it believes in him for all the good that it wants, and seeth to be stored in him; and that which draws it so to rely on him, is the discovery it hath made of his sufficiency and readiness to answer its great necessity; which is, to be delivered from the guilt and defile∣ment of sin; and that because it apprehends all this to be fountained in him, that it may be communicated by him to all those that stand in need of it; and this it doth upon the invitation given in the Gospel, to all that are
<PB N="135" REF="000960_0138_0FADE5B954853C20"/>
oppressed with the burden of sin, to come to him for succour against it.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>This</HI> Faith <HI>is always accompanied with true</HI> Repentance. In active Conversion these two Graces are in conjunction. I shall not here meddle with the disputes, which of these two Graces is the first: if we speak of their pro∣duction, they are together, and so there is no priority of any Grace, they being created in the same instant: if we speak of the order of nature in their activity, Faith must have the precedency, because it influenceth all the o∣ther; for though there is a <HI>Legal Repentance</HI> before Conversion, yet that which is <HI>Evangeli∣cal</HI> follows upon it, and is no further pleasing to God, than as it is exercised by faith: but in respect to order of time, the man repents and believes at once, and so they are together. It is a penitent Faith, and a believing Repen∣tance that is exerted; they are therefore con∣joyned, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.21. <HI>Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>For the right exerting of these Graces, there is the exercise of a Spirit of Mourning, and of Supplication.</HI> There is a principle of this, or there is such a Spirit habitually put into the man when he is new made, but the improve∣ment of it is in the practising of Faith and Repentance. Here then,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>For the exerting of true Repentance, he draws
<PB N="136" REF="000960_0139_0FADE5BA381617E0"/>
out a Spirit of mourning.</HI> In Repentance we turn from sin to God, in which turning, there is not only an abstinence from the outward acts, but a cordial renouncing and forsaking of those sins which we rightly repent of; and for that end we must be made to see them to be evil and mischievous, and that we have foo∣lishly turned from God to them; the genuine effect whereof upon the heart, is to bemoan our selves by reason of them: and hence the Scripture annexeth mourning unto Repen∣tance, as an inseparable concomitant of it, hence that in, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18. <HI>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning of himself, &amp;c.</HI> And for the producing of this mourning, God offers the conviction of the evil and bitterness there is in our sins, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Know and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</HI> Now there are two passages to be observed in this mourning.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He bewails all his Sins.</HI> Godly Sorrow is for Sin: that is the procuring cause of all the sorrows that poor man is exposed unto, and is therefore that which peculiarly calls for our mourning; and this belongs to that sor∣row which the Apostle tells us is so servicea∣ble to true Repentance, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.10, <HI>Godly sorrow worketh repentance not to be repented of.</HI> It is by this that we embitter sin to our selves, and stir up in us an hatred of it: for, though sorrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a mixt Affection, yet it mainly
<PB N="137" REF="000960_0140_0FADE5BB6B2B6828"/>
partakes of hatred, which is a separating af∣fection, and makes us to reject the Object of it. Now if this sorrow be genuine, it is universal; it bears a respect to all sin; because if it be right, it is exci∣ted by the apprehension of the great evil there is in sin, in the nature, as well as in the effects of it; which evil being in all sin, it must needs extend to all: hence that, <HI>Psalm</HI> 119.104. <HI>I hate every false way</HI>; and where this hatred is, there will be Sorrow for our having hurt our selves by it, and therein dis∣honoured God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He more peculiarly laments the affronts that he hath offered to Christ, who hath been set before him in the tenders of Grace.</HI> This therefore is peculiarly remarked in, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. <HI>They shall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only Son, and be in bitterness for him, as one is in bit∣terness for his first born.</HI> Where the Gospel comes, and Christ is exhibited, together with the need that men have of him by reason of Sin; the convictions whereof are laid before men to perswade them of the necessity they stand in of having him to be their Saviour; and men have made light of there invitations which have been given them; they have not been perswaded of their misery by Sin, and brought to accept of Christ to rescue them from it, and have accordingly despised
<PB N="138" REF="000960_0141_0FADE5BB93D404F0"/>
him, neglected him, chosen lying vanities be∣fore him, and remained in their unbelief; This is the great provocation under the Gos∣pel, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.19. <HI>This is the Condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men chuse dark∣ness rather than light.</HI> This Sin therefore they shall peculiarly mourn for and resent with the greatest sorrow.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>For the exercising of Faith, this Spirit of mourning is ever accompanied with a Spirit of Supplication.</HI> The first breathings and break∣ings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth of faith, are in prayer. When once <HI>Paul</HI> was Converted, that is the next news we hear of him, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.11. <HI>Behold he prayeth.</HI> This is the first sign by which the new-born Christian discovers that he hath life in him. True Prayer supposeth a principle of faith in the man, for only such a prayer as is spirited with it, is acceptable to, and prevalent with God, <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.16. <HI>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much</HI>; compare, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.5, 6. <HI>Let him ask of God, but let him ask in faith.</HI> God hath therefore made it a medium for our participation in the blessings engaged in the New Covenant, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.37. <HI>I will yet be enquired of for this by the House of Israel to do it for them.</HI> In which prayer,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He confesseth and bewaileth his sins before God</HI>▪ Confession of sin is, if not an essential part, yet an inseparable adjunct of prayer, by which sinful man addresseth God for mercy;
<PB N="139" REF="000960_0142_0FADE5BC99233228"/>
hence the promise so runs, <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.13. <HI>He that confesseth and forsaketh shall find mercy:</HI> And for this reason, when God invites back∣sliders to return, and promiseth them accep∣tance, he enters that caution, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Only acknowledge thine iniquity.</HI> Nor indeed can we rightly come to Christ for a pardon and cleansing, unless we lay open our malady be∣fore him; so that there is a tacit confession of Sin in the very petitions that are put up on this account: but God expects that in our solemn addressing of him, we be explicit in it, <HI>Levit.</HI> 26.40. <HI>If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their tres∣pass, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He requests his Converting Grace.</HI> There must be a root of Conversion in the man, be∣fore he can sincerely desire or petition to be Converted; and indeed gracious mourning, confession, and supplication, do follow after that inward and transforming work of the Spirit in the man, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.19. <HI>After that I was turned, I repented, and after that I was in∣structed, I smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed, &amp;c.</HI> However, in the actual turning of the Soul to God, the man finds that it is not in his own power to turn himself, but that he must have it given him of God; and accor∣dingly he asks it of him: thus did <HI>Ephraim, verse</HI> 18. <HI>Turn thou me, and I shall be turned</HI>; and God directs <HI>Israel</HI> to use such words, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="000960_0143_0FADE5BF7A7AA848"/>
14.2. <HI>Take away all iniquity, and receive us gra∣ciously</HI>; and these cries are drawn forth by the efficacy of <HI>preventing Grace.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>He professeth his acceptance of, and reliance upon Christ for Salvations</HI> He acknowledgeth that Christ is an All sufficient Saviour, that there is a fulness of vertue in this fountain to take away all Sin and Uncleanness from him: he answers the Call of the Spirit in the Word, and embraceth the promise annexed to it, and Echo's back to it with acceptance and gratitude, as, <HI>Psal.</HI> 27.8. <HI>When then saidst, seek ye my face, mine heart said unto thee, thy face▪ Lord, will I seek. Jer.</HI> 3.22 <HI>Return ye backsli∣ding Children, and I will heal your backslidngs; behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God</HI>: And thus is the Everlasting Covenant past between God and him; now is he Uni∣ted with the Fountain of Grace, and all the saving vertue of it is derived to him, and this is the usual method of Divine Grace, in bringing a Sinner to participate in the saving Benefits which were purchased by the Lord Jesus Christ for him.</P>
<P><HI>USE I. For Information</HI> in two or three particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>We have here a Rule to judge of the Effica∣cy of the Gospel in the dispensacion of it.</HI> There is a great deal of reason why the People of God should observe, not only who enjoys
<PB N="141" REF="000960_0144_0FADE5C068BDD710"/>
the Gospel in which Christ is opened to men, and where it is that Christ is most clearly and distinctly declared in his whole work; but al∣so what fruit or efficacy there is of it; how far the vertue of this fountain for the ends of its being opened, is made evident by the effects of it upon men: and though the work of Ap∣plication, wherein Christ is made to us Righ∣teousness and Sanctification, for the pardoning and cleansing of our sin, be a secret work, and no man can certainly know it of another, ex∣cept by extraordinary Revelation; and though the things which are the concomitants of this, and evidence to it, <HI>viz.</HI> A spirit of mourning and supplication, are not so obvious, but that men may be mistaken about them, inasmuch as there may be secret Prayer, and bewailing of sin, that is sincere, and accepted with God, which makes no noise; and there may be a shew of much of this, but whether it be sincere, and proceeds from such a spirit given to us, can be judged of only Charitably; yet there is usually so much to be discerned on this account, by such as observe the times, as may make the <HI>hearts</HI> of such as fear God, <HI>Glad</HI> or <HI>Sad,</HI> and many times there are too awful evidences of the general prevailing of the con∣trary spirit, by the notorious appearance of such things as are inconsistent with this. If we speak on a publick account, when God in∣tends to pour out much grace upon a People,
<PB N="142" REF="000960_0145_0FADE5C0D56EF040"/>
he will give a spirit of mourning and prayer; and therefore when there is but a little of this, and much of the contrary to be observed, when it is as, <HI>Isa.</HI> 22.12, 13. <HI>In that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping, and to mourn∣ing, and to baldness, and to gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding with sackcloth; and behold joy, and gladness, slaying of oxen, and killing of sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall dy.</HI> When instead of reforming the sins that are among men, there is nothing mended, but they rather grow worse; it saith, that if there were a spirit of mourning, it would not be so. And when Prayer is neglected; particularly in Fa∣milies, and there are so many houses without it, as is complained, it is to be supposed that secret Prayer is neglected too; and much more that the spirit of Supplication is greatly wanting. Nay, though there be many Fasts kept, for the bemoaning of the prevailing sins, making of humble confessions of them unto God, and asking of his pardon and healing; yet if this be all, and there is nothing amended, nor is the work of the present day in this re∣gard pursued; it will bespeak, that the day for the plentiful accomplishment of this promise that we have under our present consideration, doth not as yet commence. And let serious Christians judge by such Rules, and say, whe∣ther they do not see great occasion for Lamen∣tation on this account. The same observation
<PB N="143" REF="000960_0146_0FADE5C1A87FA148"/>
is also applicable to particular persons.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We may hence learn what little reason the most have to boast of Christ as a Fountain of Sal∣vation to them.</HI> It must needs be a sad sight, to see with what security and confidence the generality do nourish themselves, as if they nothing doubted of a title to Christ, and life by him, and take it amiss to have the reality of it so much as questioned, who yet cannot bear the test of the truth in hand, but must needs fall before it, and stand condemned by it. If it be, as it is, a great truth, that where God applies Christ to men, in the benefits which he hath purchased for Sinners, he pours out upon them a spirit of mourning and supplication, certainly then, all such as are without such a spirit, must needs be strangers to such an Ap∣plication: and without doubt, where such a spirit is put into men, there will be the exerting of it in their lives and practices. When there∣fore there is nothing of this, but the quite contrary notoriously appearing, such mens faith must needs be presumption, and their boasting is of a <HI>false gift.</HI> Think of this then, all you who are so far from mourning for your sins, that you can live in them quietly &amp; contentedly, nay you <HI>Rejoyce in iniquity,</HI> and take the greatest Satisfaction in gratifying of your carnal lusts, who are never well, but when you are <HI>Devising mischief on your beds,</HI> and put∣ting it in practice as soon as opportunity
<PB N="144" REF="000960_0147_0FADE5C259ED7F38"/>
affords; you that can <HI>make a mock of sin,</HI> that can <HI>Drink your stollen waters, and eat your bread in secret, and wipe your mouths, and say, we have done no wickedness.</HI> You that can boast of your lewd pranks, and <HI>shew your sin as Sodom, and hide it not</HI>; you that joyn hard in hand with your lewd companions, and encourage one a∣nother in your wicked courses, surely you ne∣ver had the healing vertue of this fountain ap∣plied to you; and to hope to have your sins pardoned, and yet not cleansed is a vain hope. Think of this also all you Prayerless ones, who instead of calling upon Gods name, abuse it, and <HI>take it in vain</HI> by your profane taking it into your mouths; who can live days, and months, and years without so much as a formal addressing of God; whose houses will one day rise up against you, and testify that you never Prayed in them, either by your selves, or with your families; who never carried your iniquities to God as a <HI>burden too heavy for you to bear,</HI> and with strong cryes besought him to take them away by a free pardon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and powerful purging. Let all such know, that how presumptuously soever you may now cry, <HI>Lord, Lord,</HI> there is a time coming, if mercy prevent not, when he will say, <HI>I never knew you, depart from me all ye workers of iniquity.</HI> And <HI>be not deceived, for God is not mocked.</HI></P>

applications of Christ to them: certainly they are such unto whom God imparts the largest measure of a spirit of mourning and supplication.</HI> Where God intends to build highest, he will lay the founda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion lowest.

God, who hath promised
<PB N="146" REF="000960_0149_0FADE5C4A0CA2E28"/>
that his shall pray unto him (and it is he who giveth prayer to his own) hath assured us of a gracious audience, and a good return to our prayers, <HI>Jer.</HI> 29.12, 13, 14. <HI>Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye shall seek me and find me, &amp;c.</HI> Be not then discouraged; and though you may not at present experience those sensible apprehensions of the efficacy of the Fountain, for the taking away of your Sin, yet doubt not that God will in the best way do it for you, and give you the experi∣ence of it to your abundant Consolation. God w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll exalt his Grace on you in this way, and make it to appear how great is his kind∣ness to you, in taking off your Guilt, and wa∣shing away your pollution: And when you are suitably prepared so to glorifie him, he will fill you with the discoveries of his love, for which you shall admire him for ever.</P>
<P><HI>USE II. For Examination,</HI> Let us hereby prove whether ever this Fountain were saving∣ly Opened to us, and it concerns all to put themselves upon this Trial. For Motive then, Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You are all by Nature under the guilt and defilement of Sin.</HI> Sin and Uncleanness are he∣reditary to all <HI>Adams</HI> Children, and they de∣rive to them in the Channel of Natural Ge∣neration; for this we are told, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.3. <HI>We

are Children of wrath, even as others;</HI> and he demands and resolves, <HI>Job</HI> 14 4 <HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</HI> This then is the condition in which every one is born. <HI>Adams</HI> First Transgression was ours by a legal <HI>Imputation,</HI> and his corrupt Image which he contracted, instead of Gods Image which he lost, is ours by <HI>Propagation</HI>; and thus we come into the world guilty and filthy Creatures, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.5. <HI>Behold, I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> And this Guilt and Defilement are encreased by all the actual sins that we have committed since we came into the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Except this be done away, it will be your ru∣ine.</HI> All Sin in its own nature and operation is deadly. Sin and Death are closely conne∣cted each with the other, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12 <HI>By one man sin came into the world, and death by sin.</HI> The guilt that adheres to sin binds the man under the Curse, and that is Death, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.4. <HI>The Soul that sinneth, it shall dy.</HI> The Law hath already past the Sentence upon the man, and unless it be removed it will without fail take place on him: and the defilement of sin is it self the very spiritual death of the Soul: it hath deprived the man of the life of Sancti∣fication, and he can no more perform a graci∣ous action, than a dead man can a life action; hence that expression, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2 1. <HI>Ye were dead in trespasses and sins.</HI> So that as long as it a∣bides
<PB N="148" REF="000960_0151_0FADE5C612F8CFC0"/>
on him, he cannot at all answer the end of his Creation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Nothing else can do it for you but this Foun∣tain.</HI> There is a sufficiency of vertue in it for this end; God provided it for this very purpose, and he doth nothing in vain: it therefore never failed of producing this ef∣fect, where it was savingly applied. But ex∣cept you repair hither, all your other attempts will prove lost labour: this <HI>Salvation</HI> is no where else to be had, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. There is nothing else that can expiate the Guilt of sin, or make atonement to the Justice of God for the remission of it, but this <HI>one Sacrifice</HI> of Christ: <HI>thousands of rams</HI> will not procure it, God therefore blows upon them with contempt, <HI>Mic.</HI> 6.6, 7, 8. Nor will all the waters of <HI>Abana</HI> and <HI>Pharpar</HI> cleanse this <HI>Leprosy</HI>; it is only the Blood of Christ is cleansing, and <HI>that Blood doth cleanse from all sin,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh</HI>▪ 1.7.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Except it be applied to you it will not have this saving efficacy.</HI> Christ doth not profit all; although his vertue be sufficient, yet all are not pardoned and healed by him: there are mul∣titudes that perish in their sins notwithstand∣ing; and that not only of those to whom he was never revealed in the Gospel, but of such also, who have been told of, and invited to come to him: and whence is this, but because application hath not been made of him to them for this end? Sinners that are outwardly
<PB N="149" REF="000960_0152_0FADE5C92AD0A9B0"/>
called, perish as well as others, and the reason is because they do not answer the Call, and <HI>come to the waters,</HI> the threatning is therefore declared against such, Prov 1.24, <HI>&amp;c.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Till then you know that he hath been thus applied to you, your condition must needs be dubious.</HI> It is from the work of Application that we are to fetch our evidence of our safe estate. It is not enough that there is a Christ, and that he is a Fountain of Salvation, but is he ours? for this reason Professors are put upon it to <HI>prove</HI> and <HI>try</HI> themselves; and the enqui∣ry is not, whether there be such a Fountain, and there be a fulness in it, but whether Christ be in us, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. <HI>Know ye not your own selves, how that Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</HI> And hence we have such an ex∣pression, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.27. <HI>Christ in you the hope of Glory.</HI> And though, if the thing be so, your state is out of danger, yet till you know that it is so, you cannot enjoy inward quiet or sa∣tisfaction.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>There are many who cheat themselves with false hopes on this account.</HI> The natural security in sinful man, makes him ready to take easy satisfaction about his good estate; and the de∣lusions of Satan, and the false reports of a carnal mind, and the fair shews which there

are in a common work of the Spirit, are snares which they are entangled by: there is upon this account great need to be cautioned against rash presumption, lest otherwise you labour of a pernicious mistake; thus the Apo∣stle to them, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.9. <HI>Be not deceived.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The Doctrine in hand affords you a sure Rule of Trial.</HI> Whatsoever difference there may be, in the manner or degree of mourning, or of the impressions which are made on the Conscience, by the <HI>Terrors of the Lord</HI>; yet, when God makes the Gospel effectual for the application of the vertue of this Fountain to a Sinner, he always gives a Spirit of Mourning and Prayer; <HI>i. e.</HI> He gives Grace to mourn and pray after a Godly manner: If therefore you can discover this to be in you, and are not mistaken about it, you have an evidence that will not deceive you. Put your selves then upon the trial of them severally, and that by such R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les as follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hath God poured upon you a Spirit of mourning for Sin? have you received the Grace of God by sorrow? And for proof of this,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Did you ever mourn at all for Sin? if not, this Trial is resolved at once.</HI> He that never mourned for sin, did never partake in the sa∣ving vertue of this fountain: and it is to be feared that a great many forward Professors will fall at this first Trial. There are many
<PB N="151" REF="000960_0154_0FADE5CAAF5347B8"/>
that build high, but did never dig for a foun∣dation. The stony ground hearers Religion begins with joy, as, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20. <HI>He heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it.</HI> It may be you have mourned for the fruits of sin, for your outward losses, bereavements, reproach∣es, pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but it hath not been the Sin that procured them, but the things themselves that stirred up your sorrow: and if the Sin it self was not bitter to you, you never repaired to the Grace of Christ to take it away.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Have you mourned after a Godly sort?</HI> It may be you have been touched with remor∣ses of Conscience, &amp; Sin hath been set home upon you with terror: but that may be, and yet be only a part of the punishment of Sin in this life: there is therefore a double sorrow for sin, <HI>Godly and Worldly:</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.10. And is yours a Godly one? Try it by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Have you ever felt the bitterness of Sin it self?</HI> Many an one finds sorrow by his sins, and is forced to acknowledge that his Sin hath brought it upon him, who yet is not led by it to see and believe that Sin is in its own nature so vile and evil as to be odious. It may be he only reads it in the Law, and he sees that God will maintain his own Law; but mean while he lays the blame, not on the sin that procu∣red his sorrow, but on the Law that had such a Sanction in it: and he is therefore sorry for his sin, only because he is sorry that there is
<PB N="152" REF="000960_0155_0FADE5CBEFCE1920"/>
such a Law, that will not suffer him to sin with impunity: this is no <HI>Godly Sorrow</HI>: it is not acted by Humility, but by pride and prejudice; and he saith as they, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.10. <HI>If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how shall we then live?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Have you been deeply oppressed with the burden of sin, so as thereby to be made weary of it?</HI> Though God improves the troubles and mischiefs procured by Sin, to bring us to see the evil of it, and cry out by reason of the bitterness there is in it, yet in a kindly mour∣ning, sin it self is made to be a burden that we cannot tell how to bear, and hereupon we long to be rid of it, and earnestly seek after a freedom from it; thus it was with <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 7 24. <HI>Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> We seek a pardon, for we are undone without it: but we seek the death of Sin too, nor can we be at quiet, but in the assurance and expe∣rience of the beginning of it in us, and a com∣fortable perswasion that it will ere long be wholly destroyed: hence that groan of his, <HI>Psal.</HI> 38.4. <HI>Mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hath your mourning reached to, and fixed upon the sin of your nature?</HI> It is not enough to have bewailed this or that particular actual Sin, although God usually makes the conviction
<PB N="153" REF="000960_0156_0FADE5CC18842368"/>
of, and the sorrow for such, to be leading to the other: but he that hath truly mourned for Sin, hath been led up from thence to the fountain of corruption which is within, and that hath driven him to seek after the Foun∣tain of Grace which is in Christ: and always true mourning ceaseth not, till it cometh hi∣ther, and lays out its greatest lamentations here: thus it did in <HI>David,</HI> in the forecited, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.5. And in the Church, <HI>Isa.</HI> 64.6. <HI>We are all as an unclean thing;</HI> and in <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 7.21. <HI>I find a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Hath this sorrow wrought in you unto a true Repentance from Sin? Repentance</HI> is one of the saving works of the Spirit wrought in <HI>Appli∣cation</HI>▪ and wherever Christ is communicated to any as a fountain of Grace, there will be this effect of it. Now <HI>Godly Sorrow</HI> is an in∣gredient of this Repentance, and therefore if it be right, it will ever accompany such a thing. <HI>Repentance</HI> is a cordial turning from Sin to God: <HI>Sorrow for sin</HI> is that which helps and promoves this turning, if it be kindly; for it is a separating Affection, and as it de∣rives from hatred of that which procures our trouble, so it will express it, in carrying us a∣way from it; hence that, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.9. <HI>Ye sor∣rowed to Repentance, for ye were made sorry after a godly manner.</HI> If then ye have mourned ne∣ver so bitterly for Sin, yet if you have not
<PB N="154" REF="000960_0157_0FADE5CCD65F8618"/>
reached to such a Repentance, it hath not been right; nor will it evidence your being in Christ.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Hath this sorrow kindled in you an universal hatred of Sin?</HI> When God embitters sin to us, it is to make us to loath it; and if this ha∣tred be of the right stamp, it will not only be against that one sin that hath done us the pre∣sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sensible harm, but all of the kind, but eve∣ry thing that bears the nature of sin on it; we can say as he, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.104. <HI>I hate every false way.</HI> And the reason is, because, if we mourned for sin under the consideration of its being sin, we shall be engaged against every other sin, in which we see the same grounds of hatred or detestation. He that mourns for one sin, and can in the mean while hug another in his bosome, and dally with it, doth not mourn-aright for any:</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Hath your sorrow lookt back to the sins of Youth?</HI> Where God doth indeed give a spirit of mourning, he will make a thorough work of it, he will lead the Soul into a soaking con∣sideration of all that hath been grievous to his holy spirit; he will bring▪ to mind old sins, &amp; those that had been forgotten before, and em∣bitter them to us, and the reason is because those sins also must be repented of, for which there must be a suitable sorrow. Time will not wear off the Guilt of any sin, but Christ must cleanse it with his blood, and in order
<PB N="155" REF="000960_0158_0FADE5CD92F81FF8"/>
thereto we must carry it to him for cleansing; and we cannot do so aright, but by bemoaning our selves before him for it. <HI>David</HI> therefore in his address to God runs up hither, <HI>Psal.</HI> 25 7. <HI>Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my trans∣gressions.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Have you in you an habitual frame of spiri∣tual mourning? Godly sorrow</HI> is not a land-flood, that is raised by some storm, and is dried up again soon after that is over, but it is a living spring, it is an habitual Grace in the Soul, and for that reason it is called <HI>a Spirit of Grace, Chap.</HI> 12.10. And this appears in a constant promptitude to mourn for sin upon every occa∣sion. Every sight of sin stirs up this Godly sorrow. When ever you feel any stirrings of Concupiscence within, it makes you to cry out, <HI>Oh wretched man, who shall deliver me, Rom.</HI> 7.24. If at any time you are over taken with any sin, it makes you to groan, and bewail your selves, and say as he, <HI>Psal.</HI> 38.18. <HI>I will declare mine iniquity, I will be sorry for my sin.</HI> Nay, if you see others to sin, though they commit it without remorse, yet you cannot but mourn for it, as he, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.136. <HI>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.</HI> And <HI>Verse</HI> 158. <HI>I beheld the transgressours and was grieved, because they kept not thy word.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8 <HI>Have you been duly affected in particular with the Affronts which you have offered to Jesus Christ?</HI> This is specifyed, <HI>Chap.</HI> 12.10. <HI>They
<PB N="156" REF="000960_0159_0FADE5CE82DC8F28"/>
shall look upon me whom they have pierced, &amp; they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son, and be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st born.</HI> There is nothing more bitter to one that is truly Converted, than the ill entertainment that he hath given to a Saviour, who came to him, and offered himself to be one to him. It may be you have led a sober li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and cannot charge your selves with the immoralities which others have fallen into: but you have lived under the Calls of the Gospel, and have been many a time invited, and sollicited to come to Christ, to take him for a Saviour; but you have <HI>made light of it,</HI> neglected him, been content without him; you have o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten been inwardly striven with by the motions of the Spirit, but you have quenched them, and grieved him thereby: You have lived in your unbelief, and been contented so to do; you have had a low esteem of him, and of his Salvation; you have relied on your own <HI>Righteousness, and not submitted to his</HI>; you <HI>sought him not, would not come to him for life</HI>; and thus you went on from year to year, till he came to awaken and bring you home to himself. Now all these things come to mind, and they carry an emphatical consideration in them to make you vile in your own eyes, and bewail your impenitence. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ever you looked to Christ with an eye of faith, it hath been with a mournful eye.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="157" REF="000960_0160_0FADE5D155F260B0"/>2. <HI>Have you experienced a spirit of Supplicati∣on?</HI> We observed that it is inseparable from the former: and would you be rightly in∣formed about this, prove your selves by these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Have you found kindled in you a restless desire to be delivered from Sin?</HI> True prayers are the offering up of our real and cordial de∣sires unto God; and hence by discovering the truth of our desires, we may come to know what our Prayers are. Now there is none that prays aright against sin, but he that longs insatiably to be rid of it. There are many that pray to have those miseries removed which they undergo for sin; but this is but <HI>Howling,</HI> and not <HI>Praying</HI>: that is a right expressing of our request on this account, <HI>Hos.</HI> 14.2. <HI>Take away all iniquity.</HI> But the heart must go with it, which it will never do, till we are weary of sin, and the presence of it is an heavy bur∣den to us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Have you found that this deliverance is no where else to be had?</HI> The right prayer, which God hears and accepts, is the prayer of the <HI>needy, the poor, and the destitute, Psal.</HI> 102.17. Christs Office is to <HI>Succour him that hath no helper, Psal.</HI> 72.12. As such therefore he ex∣pects that we come, saying as, <HI>Hos.</HI> 14.3. <HI>Ashur shall not save us,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</HI> And that we may thus pray, it is requisite that we have a deep sence imprinted
<PB N="158" REF="000960_0161_0FADE5D2820FA620"/>
on us, that this is our condition. God makes the So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to despair of any succour from any other hand, he is not only <HI>in a pit where there is no water</HI>▪ but <HI>his eyes fail him, Isa.</HI> 41.17. He finds himself to be engulphed in the waves of destruction, and cryes out as they when just ready to be swallowed up, <HI>Math.</HI> 8.25. <HI>Lord, save us, we perish.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Have you been encouraged to go to God in Prayer for this with hope?</HI> A spirit of Suppli∣cation is a gracious frame, that is put into the heart by the spirit of God; and there are the Graces that are used in the exerting of it: the principal of these is <HI>Faith,</HI> and the first stirring of it is usually in <HI>Hope</HI>; which hope is always at work, and moveth in the genui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e prayers of the people of God. This hope hath not al∣ways alike strength in it; but yet it hath that degree of it, whereby we are enabled to look with some expectation of receiving the good we ask for, at the hands of God. In your distress by reason of sin, you resolved to go to God for help against it; and what was it that drew out this resolution? was it not an appre∣hension that Christ was such a fountain for sin, and at least a resolve that the thing is not impossible; thus therefore he argued, <HI>Jon.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.9. <HI>Who can tell if God will turn and repent, &amp; turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Have you freely confessed your sins in the Ag∣gravations of them?</HI> Right confession always
<PB N="159" REF="000960_0162_0FADE5D3B277D490"/>
flows from a spirit of Prayer. God expects it, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God, &amp;c. David</HI> therefore tells us in what way he went for, and how he obtained a pardon, and the healing of his sins, <HI>Psal.</HI> 32.5. <HI>I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forgavest the iniquity of my sin.</HI> And this con∣fession hath been full and free, and without any covers; for he there saith, <HI>Mine iniquity have I not hid.</HI> It is a false heart that petitions help against sin, and in praying for it pleads excuses and extenuations: This proceeds from a spirit of bondage, and not from a spirit of Adoption.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Have you humbled your selves to Gods foot in your Prayers to him?</HI> A spirit of Prayer is a Soul humbling, a Soul-abasing spirit; hence that, <HI>Psal.</HI> 9.12. <HI>He forgetteth not the cry of the humble</HI>: and 10.17. <HI>Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear.</HI> He that prays as he ought to God, for pardon and acceptance in Christ, is deeply sensible of his great vileness by reason of sin, and of his utter unworthiness of mercy; and hence he goes <HI>with a rope on his head, and sackcloth on his loyns, i. e.</HI> He re∣signs himself to God, with all the Testimonials of his acknowledging that he hath no depen∣dence on any thing but free Grace; that he hath nothing of his own, nor can he oblige
<PB N="160" REF="000960_0163_0FADE5D4657A2590"/>
God, he therefore carries that with him in, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.8, 9 <HI>To us belongs confusion of face; to the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses.</HI> And his address is in that form, <HI>Psal.</HI> 25.11. <HI>For thy name sake O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Have you Prayed for the Purging as well &amp; as earnestly as for Pardon?</HI> Doubtless he that knows what it is to be Guilty before God, will be very importunate in asking forgiveness, and well he may, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <HI>who can stand before Gods anger?</HI> But a kindly resentment of Guilt, so as to justi∣fy God who condemns, will be accompanied with an apprehension of the vileness of sin▪ and that will make us wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of the presence of it, and to loath our selves for it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will draw out our cryes to have it taken away; both these therefore are included in that, <HI>Hos.</HI> 14 2. <HI>Take away all iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Are your Prayers importunate, or in good earnest?</HI> There are many that pray in good words, and it may be with much of noise too, and yet not from a Spirit of Supplication: they are not importunate and cordial requests which they put up. He that is in earnest, will take no denial, but will press with great∣est urgency and resolution: One of the An∣cients complains of himself, that when he prayed against his Lusts, he was afraid lest God should answer him: this was not from the <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI>; and if you are in good
<PB N="161" REF="000960_0164_0FADE5D520894CC8"/>
earnest, you will watch the answer of your prayers, to see what return there is of them. <HI>Psal.</HI> 85.10. <HI>I will hear what God the Lord will say.</HI> 130.5. <HI>My Soul wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning▪</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Do you persevere in Prayer?</HI> As it is the duty of all Gods People so to do, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.18. <HI>Praying always, &amp;c. watching thereunto with all perseverance.</HI> So it is one property of the Spi∣rit of Prayer, and there is a double perseve∣rance to be eyed in this; you are constant and unwearied in your duty, you <HI>pray without ceasing,</HI> 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.17 You resolve as, <HI>Psal.</HI> 116 2▪ <HI>I will call upon him as long as I live.</HI> And you hold on in it against all that would discourage you. If you have not a present answer according to desire, it doth not beat you off, but quickens your ardour, and you say as, <HI>Isa.</HI> 8.17. <HI>I will wait on the Lord, who hideth his face</HI>: If he re∣pulse you, you turn his very repulses into ar∣guments, as that poor woman did, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.25, 26.</P>
<P N="9">9 <HI>And doth the sense of sin always drive you to Prayer?</HI> Do your Consciences at any time reflect, and charge Guilt on you? Doth this always bring you upon your knees, and cause you to pour out your hearts in supplication?

not neglected? These are the motions of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spirit of Supplication in a Child of God. This course we find <HI>David</HI> is on all occasions taking in the <HI>Psalms.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Do it mournfully.</HI> Dry addresses to God are insignificant things, and will find no accep∣tance. Beg of God then to bestow such a Spirit upon you, and labour to express it with all suitable deportment. Labour therefore to embitter your Sin to your selves, with all the proper considerations that may make it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vile, and fill you with the deepest sense of your mi∣sery by reason of it. This is the only way for you to give God his glory both of his Righte∣ousness in condemning you, and his rich mer∣cy in pardoning and healing you. You will never come humbly, unless you come mourn∣ing: and this is the way to obtain the blessing from him. God takes distinct notice of this, and he is pleased with it; see, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18, <HI>with</HI> 20. <HI>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, &amp;c. Is Ephraim my dear Son? &amp;c.</HI> And

<P N="2">2. <HI>Do it with Supplications.</HI> If ever God gi∣veth you the experience of the vertue of the Fountain in you, for the taking away of your Sin and Uncleanness, he will make you to pray for it; he hath said, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.37. <HI>I will be sought to, &amp;c.</HI> Seek his face and favour, confess your sins, and keep not silence; seek to him in Christ's name, and present your petition before him: this is the right return∣ing to God, <HI>Joel</HI> 2.12 By thus doing you will acknowledge Christ to be the Fountain of Grace, when you do seek it of him, and call upon him for it. And for your encou∣ragement, know it, that if you do indeed thus <HI>seek him,</HI> you shall <HI>find him.</HI> If a persecuting <HI>Saul</HI> prays to him, he observes it, and accepts it of him, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.11. <HI>Behold he prayeth.</HI> Yea he hath said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.15. <HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee</HI> and thou shalt <HI>glorify me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let this stir up mourners to pray.</HI> Are there any, whose sins are made their burden, and they are in bitterness by reason of them? instead of nourishing despondent and despair∣ing thoughts in you, and making you to hide away from God, let it drive you to him, to seek his face and favour, his pity and pardon: let it draw forth that request from you in <HI>Psa.</HI> 41.4. <HI>Heal my Soul for I have sinned against thee.</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="000960_0167_0FADE5D805D78778"/>
This is the fittest posture to pray in, and God is ready to hear such in their Souls distress, that cry unto him for his help; <HI>David</HI> puts both together, <HI>Psal.</HI> 6.8, 9. <HI>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping: the Lord hath heard my supplication.</HI> It is good to come unto God in such a case, and make an argument of it, as he did, <HI>Isa.</HI> 38.14. <HI>Oh Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let the Children of God nourish this spirit in them.</HI> A Spirit of mourning and of supplica∣tion is the proper Evangelical Spirit; it is therefore one of the properties that belong to them whom Christ hath pronounced blessed, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.4. <HI>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</HI> Nor is it only proper in our first returning to God, but you will have occasion to use it as long as you live: while you carry about with you a body of death, you will never be without occasion for bitter mourning and lamentation; you will see rea∣son to <HI>go softly</HI> all your days; and as long as Sin stirs in you, and leads you into Captivity, you will need the pity and help of God, the vertue and efficacy of the fountain to derive fresh supplies of pardon and healing to you; and therefore prayer is a duty that you can∣not do without; and no prayer is acceptable to God, but what proceeds from such a spirit.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Be we here directed what to pray for, and endeavour to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>romote in others.</HI> We ought to
<PB N="165" REF="000960_0168_0FADE5D816E1CDA8"/>
seek and use means for the Salvation of Sinners, and peculiarly for those to whom we are tied by the bonds of near relation; and if ever they be saved, they must repair to this fountain for it; and if they so do, and succeed, it must be with mourning and supplication. Let us then use means to bring them to this, by shewing them their need, and shewing them where their help is, and how it is alone to be obtained; and let us bring them to God, and ask for them this grace: and if we see them brought into di∣stress, and made to enquire how they may find redress, let us nourish this in them, and not go about to suppress or stifle it.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This calls all those on whom God hath pour∣ed such a Spirit, to Thankfulness to him for it.</HI> Hath God given us truly to mourn and pray by reason of Sin, he hath done us an uncon∣ceivable kindness; there is no greater token of his <HI>Everlasting Love</HI>; it saith that he hath been laying a foundation for eternal life in us; these tears, and these cries have solid con∣solation in them; they are his gift, and he gave them to us that so he might bring us to himself, and put us into the way of blessedness. Let this then be one thing for which we praise him, and let this nourish and strengthen such a frame in us, to consi∣der that eternal joy is secured to it, for we are assured in, <HI>Psal.</HI> 126.5, 6. <HI>They that sow

<P>IN this Chapter, with the two following an account is given of the substance or heads of a Sermon which Christ preach∣ed to his Disciples, in the audience of a multitude soon after he had called them, The matters contained in this fifth Chapter, may

be reduced to three heads. [1.] He points the way to true Blessedness, by describing the subjects of it in several distinguishing Cha∣racters of them, and declaring wherein they appear to be really happy, <HI>Verse</HI> 3. <HI>to</HI> 13. [2.] He lays open the Office and Duty of such as would approve themselves to be faith∣ful and edifying Ministers of the Gospel, to <HI>Verse</HI> 17. [3.] He asserts the great useful∣ness of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> under the Gospel, assu∣ring us that his design was not to <HI>Abolish,</HI> but <HI>Establish</HI> it; and thereupon proceeds to Vindi∣cate the true sense of it from the corrupt and false glosses of the <HI>Jewish Doctors to the end of the Chapter.</HI> In which he insists upon several <HI>Articles,</HI> which had been more especially de∣praved by them: and the words of our <HI>Text</HI> are an Exhortation which he draws from the whole foregoing discourse; though I know there are some who needlesly restrain it to the next foregoing duty of expressing our cordial love to our enemies, in opposition to the Doctrine of the <HI>Scribes,</HI> who taught <HI>that we should love our neighbour, and hate our enemy.</HI> I know the words are expressed in the Future tense; <HI>Ye shall be perfect</HI>; but yet they are not to be understood <HI>Promissorily,</HI> as some do in∣terpret them; but <HI>Preceptively,</HI> as an injuncti∣on laid upon us. And we have several like instances in this <HI>Chapter</HI>; yea &amp; it is frequent in all languages to use the <HI>Future</HI> for the <HI>Impe∣rative:</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="000960_0172_0FADE5DC96C86D90"/>
You shall do thus or so; intending, I require or command you so to do.</P>
<P>In the words, besides the <HI>Illation, therefore,</HI> which refers to the foregoing discourse, there are two parts;</P>
<P N="1">1. A duty enjoyned; <HI>Be ye perfect.</HI> The subject of this command are Christs <HI>Disciples, verse</HI> 1. The thing required is perfection; which, what it is, will be afterward consider∣ed.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Pattern which is set before us to follow, in our essayes after this perfection; <HI>as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</HI> So that here the Divine perfection is proposed to us for our imitation; and an argument is used to urge it from the consideration of that rela∣tion which he bears to us, he is our Father in heaven; and Children are apt to take after their Parents. Hence that, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.15, 16. <HI>As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is writ∣ten, be ye Holy, for I am Holy.</HI> Here is not an equality intended, but a similitude, together with such a measure as the Creature is capable of attaining unto: for the greatest perfections of the most excellent Creatures, are imperfe∣ctions, compared with God. Nor are all the Divine Perfections here intended: there are those that are by Divines called <HI>Incommunicable,</HI> which we are to admire, but not to aspire af∣ter; and there are those which are said to be
<PB N="170" REF="000960_0173_0FADE5DD57142848"/>
<HI>Communicable:</HI> Namely, such whereof there may be an Image, or dark representation in us; and these are here aimed at. These per∣fections consist in that <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> which are required in the Moral Law, un∣to which we are enabled by the Sanctification of the Spirit, the Graces whereof in us are called, the <HI>Image of God</HI>; by which we imi∣tate him in his Holiness, and Righteousness. That the Duty here required is <HI>Evangelical</HI>; therein appears, because Christ enjoyneth it on his Disciples, and such as can call God their Father, by vertue of the <HI>Adoption,</HI> which we are told cometh in upon believing, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.26. <HI>For we are the Children of God, through faith in Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The only matter of difficulty before us, is to know what is the perfection intended by Christ in this precept, and which he requireth and expecteth that all those who approve themselves to be his <HI>Disciples,</HI> should be always aspiring after. And that which makes it the more difficult, is because the word is variously used in the Scriptures, and differently applied by Expositors to this <HI>Text.</HI> The word signi∣fyeth, that which hath attained its end; and, because when a thing hath so done, it hath reached its perfection according to its capacity, it is <HI>Metonymically</HI> used for it: and so, one that is adult, or grown up to his full <HI>Stature,</HI> is said to be <HI>a perfect man, Eph.</HI> 4.13. And they
<PB N="171" REF="000960_0174_0FADE5DE295200C0"/>
whose Grace is arrived to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fulness in Glory, are called <HI>Just men made perfect, Heb</HI> 12.23. Divines distinguish perfection into <HI>Legal</HI> and <HI>Evangelical</HI>; which is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rue distinction if ta∣ken in a sound sense, but is warily to be un∣derstood. They tell us also, that there is a perfection of <HI>parts,</HI> which is called <HI>Integrality</HI>; and so an infant is a perfect man, because he hath all the parts which belong to that <HI>Speci∣es:</HI> and of <HI>Degrees,</HI> when these parts are com∣pleated, and come to the just measure which nature aspired unto. They speak also of a <HI>Relative</HI> or <HI>Comparative</HI> perfection, when, though a thing be in it self defective, yet when it is compared with another of its own kind, it doth very much exceed or go beyond it; and that which is <HI>Absolute,</HI> which is when it is improved to its utmost capacity; &amp; they observe that perfection is sometimes used for <HI>Sincerity,</HI> in opposition to <HI>Hypocrisy</HI>; when a man not only professeth Godliness, but is the man he pretends to be, such an one is sound or perfect, whereas the other is unsound, and so imperfect. Now all these distinctions have their foundation in the word of God: nor, without distinguishing, can we be able to re∣concile those <HI>Texts</HI> which assert the present perfection of the people of God, even in this life, with those that do deny any here to be perfect; which would else be contradictions, whereas we are assured that the spirit of God
<PB N="172" REF="000960_0175_0FADE5DF580D7C68"/>
doth not contradict himself in his word. Now, though it be easily granted on all hands, that Christ requires <HI>Sincerity,</HI> or an <HI>Upright Heart</HI> of us, yea and <HI>Integrity</HI> too, or a cordial <HI>respect</HI> to be expressed to all his <HI>Commands</HI>; and he will accept of such sinceri∣ty and integrity at the hands of his people in these duties which they perform in faith, seek∣ing for their acceptance in Christ: in which respect, I suppose, <HI>Evangelical</HI> Obedience doth mainly differ from that which is <HI>Legal,</HI> and God is pleased with it, when he rejects the other; yet, how far, <HI>absolute perfection</HI> is comprized in the precept here given by Christ, is a matter of doubt and debate a∣mong many. There are, and those not a few, who with greatest confidence do assert, that God doth not expect or require of his people, under the Gospel Covenant, that perfection in their Obedience to him, which he did un∣der the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI>; but hath abated of the strictness of the Command; and if we do our best, there is no more required of us. Which assertion, though I believe that many who use it, do mean well, and intend nothing else in it than is acknowledged by all the <HI>Or∣thodox</HI>; yet it is a very unsafe assertion in the letter of it; and is one foundation on which the <HI>Papists</HI> do build their Doctrines of mens <HI>merits,</HI> and works of supererogation; yea and many <HI>Protestants</HI> do also introduce
<PB N="173" REF="000960_0176_0FADE5DFA309B230"/>
that absurd and dangerous notion of making our Obedience to be of the matter of our Ju∣stification; because being upon a New Cove∣nant account, we do fulfil the Obedience that is in it required of us, and so, by that Cove∣nant, it bespeaks our <HI>Justification</HI>: Loose Pro∣fessors also are hurt by this opinion; they think they are sincere, and because of this indul∣gence, are too negligent in their duty, and fail in that true Repentance, which they ought every day to be in the renewed exercises of; It may then be of present use to discuss this Case, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Whether that Personal Perfection which God requires of his people under the Covenant of Grace, be the same for kind and degree with that which was required in the Covenant of Works, or any thing short of it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> For the more distinct opening and re∣solving this important Case, let these things be observed.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the question is not concerning</HI> Uncon∣verted <HI>Ones who are under the outward Dispensa∣tion of the Gospel; but those that are under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>race,</HI> i. e. <HI>those that are truly Converted to God.</HI> Touching the former of these, it is to be well observed, that notwithstanding the offer they have made to them, and standing which they have under the Covenant and Promises exhi∣bited by the Gospel to men, in which li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="174" REF="000960_0177_0FADE5E05B6FD1A8"/>
and Salvation is hypothetically promised unto them, and invitations are urged upon them to entertain it on the terms proposed; yet before such time as they have actually embraced the offered Grace, they are truly under the Law as a Covenant of Works: and because they are so, it demands of them personal perfecti∣on both habitual and actual, and that on pain of death; for we are told in, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. <HI>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the Curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are writ∣ten in ihe Book of the Law, to do them.</HI> Hence, as of old, God gave the <HI>Moral Law</HI> a new Sanction, on <HI>Mount Sinai</HI> with thundrings and lightnings, and great terrors, as we are infor∣med, <HI>Exod.</HI> 19. <HI>&amp;</HI> 20. So to make way for the <HI>veiled Gospel,</HI> which was afterwards given to <HI>Moses,</HI> and by him to <HI>Israel,</HI> in those <HI>Ordi∣nances,</HI> or <HI>Ceremonial Institutions</HI> which were delivered to him; so, under the Gospel; to those that are partakers of the outward bene∣fits of it, when he comes to Convert any Sin∣ners among them to Christ, and make them to accept of him, as a Saviour, he lays them under the terrors of the <HI>Law Moral,</HI> by shew∣ing them what is therein required of them, and what they are to expect at the hands of a Righteous God, if those demands be not fully answered; and by this he convinceth them of their misery, and self impotency to
<PB N="175" REF="000960_0178_0FADE5E112FAEAD0"/>
deliver themselves from it, thereby making way for their hearkning after, and giving the greatest welcome to a Redeemer. On this account is the Law called our <HI>School-master unto Christ, Gal.</HI> 3.24. Because by it we are acquainted with our need of him, and excited to seek after him. There is then no doubt to be made, but that the same perfe∣ction is required of them, notwithstanding their being in the visible Kingdom of Christ. Whereas true Converts or such as have believ∣ed in Christ, are delivered from this Severity, <HI>i. e.</HI> they are no longer under the Law as a Covenant pronouncing of them dead men if they fail of their Obedience in the least <HI>punctilio</HI>: and the reason is, because they are brought under the Covenant of Grace, by which they are freed from the former, accor∣ding to, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.14. <HI>Sin shall not have domini∣on over you, for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The question is not with respect to our Justi∣fication before God.</HI> The Justification of fallen man hath not the least regard to any perso∣nal Obedience of theirs, as having an influ∣ence Causall into it; and consequently it can have no respect to any kind of perfection of it. Gospel Justification cometh altogether by the <HI>Imputation</HI> of the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of another to us; <HI>viz.</HI> that of Christ, which was for that end provided by God for us, and is called his
<PB N="176" REF="000960_0179_0FADE5E397DD67D0"/>
Righteousness, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3 9. <HI>The Righteousness that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God by faith</HI>; and so it is not ours Perso∣nal or inherent, but by acceptation for us. It is called the Justification of a Sinner, or of the <HI>Ungodly, Rom.</HI> 4.5. And therefore must needs have a respect to that Law in relation where∣to the man is a Sinner; which is the Moral Law, under obligation whereto all men do stand as they derive from the first <HI>Adam</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom it was given for himself and his pos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣rity; and hence it must have a Righteousness to answer it, every way as perfect as that Law required, which no fallen man is able in him∣self to pay; nor can any offer it for him, but Christ only. They wholly mistake the very nature of Gospel Justification, who allow any Righteousness short of that, to have any con∣cernment in it; and since by the fall man is become <HI>Guilty,</HI> and so subjected to the <HI>Curse</HI> of the Law, if he had a personal Righteous∣ness, as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad as that which the Law required of man in integrity, yet that would not satis∣fie for the removal of his Guilt, without which he cannot be Justified. So that whether it be perfect or imperfect, it signifies nothing here.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Nor is the question about what Obedience of ours will find acceptance with God through Christ.</HI> It is certain, that no Obedience of ours will be at all accepted of us out of him; and it is also beyond doubt that the imperfection which attends the sincere Services of Gods Children,
<PB N="177" REF="000960_0180_0FADE5E46C5F6FA0"/>
will not procure that these Services of theirs should be rejected by him, for if so, it were <HI>impossible</HI> that any of us, in this imperfect state that abides us, should ever <HI>please God</HI> in any thing that we do, which must needs be an in∣vincible discouragement to us in doing any duties that are required of us: but then it is through Christ that they find acceptance with him. In this respect it is that the sincerity which Gods Children do express in their O∣bedience, is so often called <HI>perfection,</HI> in the Scriptures, (<HI>Job</HI> is said to be <HI>a perfect man, and upright, Job</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.1.) by Reason that being offered to God with Christs incense, it finds favour with him, and he smelleth a sweet sa∣vour in it, notwithstanding that according to the Law it would have been utterly rejected, by reason of the concomitant defects. So that the true Believer who serves God in in∣tegrity, is not to be discouraged, because he finds his best to come so far behind of that perfection which the Law prescribes to men, but is to look to the gracious encouragement which is given to them who <HI>love God in sincerity.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>But it is with regard to the obligation to New Obedience that lies upon Justified Believers.</HI> It presupposeth them to be in a state of Justi∣fication, and looks upon them as under the <HI>Government</HI> of Christ, and owing a Service to him. There are indeed those who deny that any such obligation lieth upon the Children
<PB N="178" REF="000960_0181_0FADE5E4E62C04B8"/>
of God, and that the <HI>Law Moral</HI> no longer binds them under duty of conformity unto it, but that upon their believing in Christ, they are freed from any such engagement; this is purely <HI>Antinomian,</HI> and bespeaks all the precept given to the Children of God under the Gos∣pel, to be wholly in vain; or only to concern such as are as yet unregenerate, for the awa∣kening them to betake themselves to Christ, and seek an interest in him by faith, and not at all to belong to those that are already par∣takers in the grace of God; but why then have the Children of God that title of <HI>Obedi∣ent</HI> put upon them, and are called upon to ex∣press it by this conformity? 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.14. <HI>As obedient children, not fashioning your selves accord∣ing to the former lusts, &amp;c.</HI> Supposing then such an Obedience as this to be our duty, which prerequires a principle to be put into us, im∣powring us to a compliance with it, in order to our actual performance of it, our enquiry is about the extensiveness of it, or how far it is our duty to endeavour after perfection in it? and for the clearing of this Case we may take the following Conclusions into Consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the design of the New Covenant, in which the Grace of it is to appear▪ is to bring fal∣len man back to a state of blessedness.</HI> It was because mankind were become wofully mise∣rable by the Apostasy of <HI>Adam,</HI> in which they all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell, and there was no room left for any re∣medy
<PB N="179" REF="000960_0182_0FADE5E64D5200F0"/>
to be afforded to them by the Cove∣nant of Works, inasmuch as the <HI>Law could no longer give life, Gal.</HI> 3.21. And God had a pity for some of that unhappy race &amp; would save them, that he opened a New Covenant, in which he makes the displays of his rich Grace to them. Now, as it was the glory of his <HI>Grace</HI> that God had a regard to ultimately in this Contrivance; so the way in which he would exalt this Attribute, and make it illustri∣ous and for ever admirable, was in their Salva∣tion: So that the Salvation of lost Sinners is inseparably connected with, and nextly sub∣ordinated to this last end of God; because in and by it he will accomplish it. In which Salvation they are delivered from that misery under which they were fallen by reason of sin, unto all that felicity which they had so lost; hence we are told that it is <HI>by Grace that we are saved, Eph.</HI> 2 8. on which account it is called <HI>the Grace of God which brings Salvati¦on, Tit.</HI> 2 11. When therefore the undone Sinner is brought to the enjoyment of perfect felici∣city, then hath the Grace of God accomplish∣ed its design.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That in order to the bringing about of this purpose of God, there are two things requisite to be done for the man,</HI> viz The <HI>Justificatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his person,</HI> and the <HI>Sanctification of his nature</HI> The ground of this, is because there is a double mi¦sery befallen the man by the Apostasy, <HI>viz.
<PB N="180" REF="000960_0183_0FADE5E654F2DE88"/>
Guilt,</HI> which hath rendred him obnoxious to the wrath of God, yea brought him under a sen∣tence of Condemnation, binding him over to suffer the whole Curse that is contained in the threatning of Death, unto the execution whereof the Justice of God stands engaged in the Covenant of works: And <HI>Pollution,</HI> by which his nature is depraved, and fallen under the Dominion of Sin which reigns as a King in him, and so he is rendred utterly impotent to the doing of that which is good, and in which his formal happiness did consist, and all his powers are violently bent to that which is evil: and so long as these two abide upon him he cannot be happy, but must needs be mise∣rable. As long as the man lies under the Curses of the Law, a Prisoner of Revenging Justice, doomed to suffer all the wrath that is contained in the threatnings that are out a∣gainst Sinners, in which the quintessence of all evil is contained; and is held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettered in <HI>Cords of Iniquity,</HI> so as that he can do nothing of that business which he was made for, but is, by the force of his carnal lusts, hurried and precipita∣ted into rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted provocations of God, he must needs be a miserable Creature: Nor can he be recovered to a state of blessedness, but by the removal of both these evils from him; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> either of them remain upon him, he is incapable of being a blessed man in that con∣dition. The former of these is done by <HI>Justi∣fication,</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="000960_0184_0FADE5E71D1D4AF8"/>
and the latter by <HI>Sanctification.</HI> In the one his Condemnation is removed, his Guilt is taken away, he is acquitted from the Law, and delivered from all danger of suffering the dire∣ful penalties of it; yea and is adjudged to life, to partake in the good that is laid up in the promise; in the latter his nature is restored, and renewed again, and he is rendred able to Serve God in newness of life; he who before was unprofitable, is now made profitable; and can glorify God, which was his last end. And for this reason both these benefits of the new Covenant, are so much celebrated in the Gos∣pel: both of these are included in that reason of the Name which was put upon Christ at his birth, <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.21. <HI>Thou shalt call his Name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.</HI> And in Gods <HI>taking away all iniquity from them,</HI> Hos. 14.2.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That the end of this Sanctification, is to make him a fit subject to enjoy true blessedness.</HI> It is true, without Justification of the mans person, and in it a pardon of his Sins applied to him, he cannot be happy; for how is it possible that he should be so, as long as <HI>the wrath of God abides on him,</HI> and he is every moment li∣able to the fearful stroke of Divine Vengeance, which is ready to fall on him, and cut him off! Whereas if once this state of his be chang∣ed, and he is a Justified and Pardoned man, he is forthwith blessed, according to <HI>Psal.</HI> 32.1.
<PB N="182" REF="000960_0185_0FADE5E7D3250BF8"/>
<HI>Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.</HI> Yet this alone is not suffi∣cient for his actual enjoyment of the felicity promised in the New-Covenant; for true blessedness can only consist in the closure of the faculty with its Object, and resting satis∣fyed in it; for without satisfaction the man is not happy; and that it may thus do, it is ne∣cessary that there be a suitableness between the faculty and the object, how else should it either close with, or take real content in it? Now the blessedness which God hath laid in to entertain his people withall, is suited only to Holiness in the subject of it; so that with∣out it, it is impossible that the man should ever participate in it, or be delighted with it, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.14▪ <HI>Without Holiness no man shall see God.</HI> So that the sinful pollution which is upon the very nature of fallen man, by reason of the sin that dwells in him, renders him, in the present condition, and so long as he abides under the prevailing efficacy of it, altogether unmeet for blessedness, yea indeed incapable of it. He cannot have Communion with God, in which his felicity must consist, for God alone is an happifying object; nor, if he could can he take any content to himself in it, because <HI>God is Holy,</HI> and such is the fellowship which he holds with the Creature, than which nothing can be more contrary to the corruption where∣with his nature is defiled. We read of <HI>A meet∣ness
<PB N="183" REF="000960_0186_0FADE5E8CB0AFEF0"/>
for the Inheritance of the Saints, Col.</HI> 1.12· Which meetness implies a suitable disposition in us thereto, in which it is absolutely requisite that there be in us such gracious qualifications as render us conformable to the Inheritance it self; these we have not in us by nature, as we derive it from the unclean fountain from which we are originated▪ for, <HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean</HI>? It must then be done by Sanctification, in and by which we are assi∣milated to our Inheritance; because hereby we are made holy, and so are fitted for the enjoyment of the holy place, and of all those holy things which are there prepared to make us happy in it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That the man can only be truly blessed in the glorifying of God, and enjoying of him.</HI> The blessedness of the Reasonable Creature requires the concurrence of two things to make it com∣pleat, <HI>viz. Well doing,</HI> and <HI>Well being:</HI> nor can either of these be alone. A man is then happy when he fully reacheth the end that he was made for; now man was made for God, not only <HI>Ultimately,</HI> but <HI>Immediately</HI> too; and to lose this end must needs be his misery. Now, Gods Glory being his own last end in all his works of Efficiency, hence it follows that the last end of all these works of his must be to Serve to that glory, how else should he obtain his end by it in the event? And every one of his Creatures is to Serve to this end agreeably

to that nature which God put into it when he made it; in which he bestowed on it a capa∣city of so serving his design by it. Accord∣ingly, man was made capable of doingly this <HI>act∣ively,</HI> inasmuch as he was endowed with such powers as enabled him to act as a cause by counsel, and make choise of his way; and therefore it is only by his so doing that he can reach the great end of his being: in his mis∣sing of this he becomes <HI>Vain,</HI> for what else is vanity, but the missing, or falling short of ones end? That the man may attain this end, it is requisite that he have a power in him to Serve to it; and what else is that power but <HI>Holiness</HI>? Created Holiness in man, is nothing else but that rectitude in his whole nature, and all the powers of it, whereby he is enabled &amp; enclined to live &amp; be to the Glory of God in all things. And from the exerting of this principle do proceed all his holy actions. Man in his lapsed estateis without this principle, having lost it by his unhappy fall▪ it must therefore be again re∣stored to him in <HI>Sanctification,</HI> else he cannot Serve God. Now mans <HI>Well being</HI> is conse∣quent upon the former; God only is an ade∣quate object for him, or a sufficient portion for him, to make him blessed; he must then enjoy him, if ever it be well with him, for in this fruition his actual felicity must consist: for could he obtain and have the full freedom of using all that is in heaven and earth, separate from God, he were still miserable; the Psalmist

<P N="5">5. <HI>That for this</HI> Active <HI>personal glorifying of God, man must have a</HI> Rule.

As there must be an <HI>heart</HI> in us enclining of us to Glorify God, else we cannot move one step towards it, so there must be a <HI>way</HI> according to which we are to encline our selves hereunto. It is certain that there are those things whereby God is dishonoured in the lives of the Chil∣dren of men, as well as those whereby they do honour him; and how should the man be able either to avoid the one, or rightly to

<P N="6"><PB N="187" REF="000960_0190_0FADE5EE01B35D20"/>6. <HI>The</HI> Moral Law <HI>was at first given to man to be this</HI> Rule. As there is a <HI>Common Govern∣ment</HI> which God exerciseth over the Creati∣on, so there is a <HI>Special Government</HI> by which he leads Intelligent &amp; Rational Agents to the end they are appointed to: Now this Law was the Rule of Gods special Government with respect to mankind. This Law is by some made the same with, and by others di∣vers from the law of nature; but if we reck∣on the law of nature, to be that which was engraven on the heart of man at the first, it may be well reckoned for the same. This was every way suited to the nature of man; it was fitted for the guiding of such a creature to its last end, in all the things in which he was con∣cerned: The <HI>sanctified understanding</HI> in man, du∣ring his state of integrity, not only could read the inscriptions of it on his heart, but saw and approved the reasonableness and equity of it; yea, the convictions of a <HI>natural Conscience</HI> in fallen man, do prove that he cannot withstand the righteousness of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.14, 15. Man was to obey this Law in all things, and to be hap∣py in that Obedience, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.5. <HI>The man that doth these things shall live by them</HI>; &amp; see, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.25.

the whole of it unto man, and had a refe∣rence to every duty that was contained there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in. This was the same Law which had a new edition of it at <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> where God pub∣lished it, and registred it on <HI>Tables of Stone,</HI> &amp; summed it up in <HI>ten Precepts,</HI> which comprized in them the summe and substance of mans du∣ty, and wherein he was bound to Serve and Glorifie God in his whole course, reaching both his heart and his life, the matter, manner &amp; end of all he did.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Though the Sanctions of that Law as a Co∣venant be removed, in respect to believers; yet as a Rule, it abides for ever.</HI> Under the Covenant of Grace, neither is the promise of bestowing a reward of life upon mens performing of per∣fect personal Obedience, nor the threatning of punishing the least defect in that Obedience with death, any longer of force in regard of the Children of God: and the reason is, because the Law of Works hath ceased to be a Cove∣nant to them, upon their accepting the terms of, and being admitted into the Covenant of Grace. We do now stand upon other terms with God, through Christ in the New Cove∣nant, whereof we are partakers by faith in him. But still the <HI>Precepts</HI> of the <HI>Moral Law</HI> abide on us as our Duty, there never was any repeal of the Command; nor indeed can they ever cease to be a Rule to man, for the guiding of him in the <HI>right ordering of his Conversation,</HI> in∣asmuch

as they are every way suited to the nature of man, considered as being made on purpose for the actual glorifying of God; so that if we would actually glo∣rify him as men, we must do it in com∣pliance with these precepts. All that is con∣tained in this rule is reduced to those two heads, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.37, 39. <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</HI> And this can never cease to be our duty, so long as we are men; nothing can discharge us from the obligation of loving God and our neigh∣bour, inasmuch as the <HI>Relation</HI> we bear to both cannot cease, and the duty is insepa∣rable from such a <HI>Relation.</HI> It is also cer∣tain that all of these Duties are reinforced in the Gospel; or under the dispensation of the Kingdom of Grace; and may be all of them found on record in the preceptive part of the New-Testament, required of Christians, <HI>as they would walk worthy of the vocation with which they are called</HI>; and are therefore called <HI>New Commands,</HI> because they are there reinforced with arguments fetcht from the consideration of the Grace of God appearing to us; we have this summarily commended to us in, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.11, 12. <HI>The Grace of God which brings Salvation hath ap∣peared to all men; teaching us, that denying

ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live so∣berly, righteously and godly in this present world.</HI> Under which three heads, are comprized all those duties which are required in and by the Moral Law.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>That all the Commands of the New-Cove∣nant, which are purely Evangelical, are inclusive∣ly Comprehended in this Rule.</HI> It is to be ob∣served, that there are some Duties introduced by the New-Covenant, and are enjoyned on all such unto whom it is promulgated, which were not Duties incumbent on man whiles he continued in a state of Integrity, such as <HI>Faith in Jesus Christ, Repentance unto life,</HI> and the several things that are contained in these, as they point to us the way for fallen man to recover Gods favour, and obtain eternal Sal∣vation; and indeed these Duties were incon∣sistent with that sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.

Nor is it to be supposed, that when God at first i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dented with man in the Covenant of Works, and warned him a∣against disobedience, by shewing him the
<PB N="191" REF="000960_0194_0FADE5F1C1467E08"/>
threatning; that he made any discovery to him of an hope that in case of his miscarriage he might be saved, or that he foretold a way of his recovery, in case he ruined himself by trespassing against the command, and bring∣ing of himself under the threatning: doubt∣less he reserved this for the <HI>Opening of the Co∣venant of Grace</HI>: and till he so made it known, man could not possibly so much as guess at such a thing. However, there is thus much contained in the Moral Law, and the light of nature clearly discovered to man at first, <HI>viz.</HI> that the rightful authority and suprema∣cy that God hath over all men, claims a li∣berty for him at any time to enjoyn man in any thing, and make it his duty by vertue of his command to do it, if it be within the power which he at first endowed him withal; and consequently that he ows Obedience to God in whatsoever he shall at any time de∣clare to be his will; hereupon <HI>Positive</HI> Com∣mands oblige men by the light of nature, as well as <HI>Natural</HI> duties, supposing there be a <HI>Revelation</HI> of them made to them. We find therefore that God at first exerted this autho∣rity over our first Parents, when he put them into the Garden, by an arbitrary exempting the <HI>Tree of Knowledge</HI> from their eating of it, under pain of death; nor did they dispute, but acknowledge his Soveraignty over them in that regard, though afterwards the adversa∣ry

used it as a snare to draw them into Sin. And how many such <HI>positive Precepts</HI> did God give to <HI>Israel</HI> of which he renders no other reason but this, <HI>I am the Lord</HI>? Hence there fore, when God once reveals to fallen men that it is his will that they should <HI>repent and believe,</HI> in order to their being made partakers in Pardon and Salvation, it becomes their bounden du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, by vertue of that Command, that they so do; and not only will they miss of Salvation if they neglect to comply with these terms on which it is offered; but they will thereby Sin against God, and so aggra∣vate their Guilt; and in this respect the Gos∣pel may well be called <HI>the Law of Christ.</HI> Hence we are told, <HI>Acts</HI> 17 30. <HI>Now God commandeth all men every where to repent. i. e.</HI> Now when the Gospel is promulgated; and 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3 23. <HI>This is his Commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ.</HI></P>

And that this is required of us will appear, if we consider;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That every thing short of this Perfection is moral impurity.</HI> The Command is the <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Holiness</HI>; and if so, then the perfecti∣on of our Holiness must consist in our be∣ing com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nsura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to that Rule: and what∣soever is contraty to Holiness is impurity; and consequently in what degree soever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come short of this measure, it is by reason of a moral deficiency in us with respect to this Rule; and that can proceed from nothing

but sinful imperfection, which must needs render us so far impure. Now the Holy God who loves <HI>Holiness,</HI> cannot be well pleased with any thing that he seeth in us, that is of another tincture. He may and doth love our <HI>persons</HI> in Christ, which love of his is un∣changeable, and nothing in us shall ever be able to separate us from it. He also loveth his <HI>Graces</HI> which are in us, they being the fruits of his own Holy Spirit; and so far as they are exercised by us, so far he <HI>smells a sweet savour</HI> in the Services that we do. But for all this, so far as we come short by reason of sin in us, and the mixture of it with any thing that we engage in, so far is there something in us which is not grateful to him, according to, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.13. <HI>Thou art of pu∣rer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.</HI> Which must needs intend a look of approbation, for his Infinite Omniscience cannot but behold it so as to know it.

<P N="2">2. <HI>That sincere Christians are commanded to</HI> grow in Grace. This is a Gospel precept enjoyned us by the Spirit of God, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18. <HI>But grow in Grace.</HI> Now this command presumes that there is truth and uprightness
<PB N="195" REF="000960_0198_0FADE5F62682A098"/>
in us; that there is a new principle of Holi∣ness infused into us; for we must have Grace in us, before we can grow in it. Where there is not life, there cannot be growth: there must be a beginning in order to a pro∣gress; and as this is a duty of all new Con∣verts, in whom the Seeds of all the Graces of the Spirit are sown, as, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.2. <HI>As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</HI> It is no less expect∣ed of all Gods people in this life, to whatso∣ever degree they have already attained; and the reason is, because they are not yet arriv∣ed at perfection, so the Apostle argueth, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.12. <HI>Not as though I had already attained, ei∣ther were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that which I am apprehend∣ed of Christ Jesus.</HI> So that though sincerity be accepted in Christ, yet we are not to rest in it, but to labour after more strength, more victory over corruption, more holiness; and when we have reached to any further degree in this than we had before, we are not now to sit still, but to aspire after more and more, and not to cease till it comes to be perfect.

<P N="4">4. <HI>There is a Sacrifice of Atonement appointed even for these defects.</HI> The Sacrifices of old were <HI>Typical,</HI> and had a spiritual aim which was to be apprehended in them: and it is certain, that where there was required by the <HI>Ceremonial Law</HI> a Sacrifice of <HI>Expiation,</HI> it signified that there had been something which was offensive to God, for which there must be a satisfaction made to him, there must be something to reconcile him, if ever the person hoped to have him Atoned to him, but for which there had been no need of such a Sacrifice. Whatsoever therefore required such
<PB N="198" REF="000960_0201_0FADE44FC122E4C0"/>
a Sacrifice to be offered up for it, must needs intimate that it had some ill thing adhering to it, that was offensive to God, and must be removed: Now the very duties that Gods people do, wherein they do sincerely serve him, and express the greatest endeavour after holiness in them, must have the vertue of Christs oblation applyed to them, for the expiation of the defects that accompa∣ny them; this was aimed at in that Leviti∣cal Law, <HI>Levit.</HI> 16.33. <HI>He shall make an Atonement for the holy Sanctuary, and he shall make an Atonement for the Tabernacle of the Con∣gregation, and for the Altar; and he shall make an Atonement for the Priests, and for all the Peo∣ple of the Congregation.</HI> Intimating that all had defilement cleaving to them, by reason of im∣perfections in those who were concerned in them.

of sinful corruption with his grace which discovered him not as yet arrived at full perfection.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The best of men do deprecate the rigour of God in his animadverting upon them; which they would have no occasion to do, if they did not know themselves to be short of that per∣fection which they ought to seek after, and that the want of it belongs to the remaining sin in them.</HI> They do indeed <HI>hope in his Grace,</HI> and accordingly look to receive free Sal∣vation from it; and they believe that this failing of theirs shall not hinder their par∣taking in it, because God hath laid in for their pardon and acceptance in another: but there is a way in which they come to have a title to this Salvation, and on account whereof they may claim it, accor∣ding to, or consistent with the Justice of the first Covenant, under which they once were: and they dare not to put themselves on the tryal of their own holiness for this, and the reason is, because they know it to be so short and defective, that if God should take advantage from what his holy eye sees to be wanting therein, he would have oc∣casion and provocation offered him, to make severe anim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dversions upon them; on this account <HI>David</HI> so pleads, <HI>Psal.</HI> 130.3, 4. <HI>If thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities; O Lord, who should stand? but there is forgiveness with thee,
<PB N="203" REF="000960_0206_0FADE45548378018"/>
that thou mayst be feared.</HI> And makes that deprecation in, <HI>Psal.</HI> 143.2. <HI>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be Justifyed.</HI> And though they can plead their interest in his favour, from the evidence of their integrity, and comfort themselves in it; it being an effect of his distinguishing Grace in them, and having the promise secured to it; yet they dare not plead any personal Righte∣ousness of their own, for the procuring of any favour for them, but renounce it, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.18. <HI>We do not present our Supplications before thee for our Righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.</HI> And for this reason the sense of these defects attending them, makes them oftentimes to tremble at the thoughts of Gods displeasure, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.120. <HI>My flesh trem∣bleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>It is their duty dayly to Pray for Forgive∣ness.</HI> Prayer is One part of <HI>Natural Worship,</HI> and it is not appointed for a Complement, but as a necessary duty for the upholding of Communion between God and men; it being the way in which we are to seek and obtain the good we need, and give him the due acknowledgments of it. In the petitionary part of it then, we are to ask him only for such things as we want: And the apprehension of our want, and his ability
<PB N="204" REF="000960_0207_0FADE45881D62B48"/>
to succcour us, is the motive of our so seeking to him. Now there is such a Peti∣tion which Christ hath directed his Disci∣ples, and such as can call God their <HI>Father,</HI> to prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dayly to him, <HI>Math.</HI> 6.12. <HI>For∣give us our debts. i. e. Our Sins.</HI> And there is ever implied in such a petition, a con∣fession of our debts, else we cannot in earnest ask the forgiveness of them. We then daily want forgiveness; not only a further confirmation of the pardon we re∣ceived in our Justification, but new for∣giveness; and there is none so holy in this life▪ as to be discharged from the obligation of making this petition in pray∣er: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there are many of Gods Children that are kept from precipitating themselves into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ocious sins; nor do any truly gracious ones make a dayly trade of it. This therefore plainly intimates, that the very remaining imperfection, which makes them in their whole lives to fall behind in regard of that absolute perfecti∣on which consists in a compleat conformi∣ty to the Rule, hath that in it which needs forgiveness t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be applied to it by the free Grace of God It therefore hath sinfulness in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, otherwise it could not stand in need o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a pardon: and whatsoe∣ever in us stands in need of that, tells us that we ought to labour indefatigably to
<PB N="205" REF="000960_0208_0FADE459A7665D60"/>
get it taken away as a thing which is evil and bitter.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>One great design that God aims at, in his Ordinances and Providences which he dispenseth to his people, is to purge away these imperfections, &amp; to lead them on towards Perfection.</HI> The <HI>Gospel Ordinances,</HI> which Christ hath appointed to be dispensed to his people, were not only de∣signed for the bringing about the Conversion of Sinners, though that also is purposed in them, we are therefore said to be <HI>begotten by the word of truth, Jam.</HI> 1.18. And <HI>Paul</HI> was sent <HI>to open mens eyes, and turn them from dark∣ness to light, and from the power of Satan to God,</HI> Acts 26.18. But God also aimed at the Edification of Saints by them. They are therefore Christ's <HI>Ascension Gifts</HI> which he hath bestowed on <HI>his Church,</HI> to help them forward to a <HI>sinless perfection,</HI> till when they are not to cease, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.10, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are also the many <HI>Afflictive Providences,</HI> which God seeth meet to exercise his own Children withal in this world, and among other purposes which he intends to bring about hereby, we are told that this is one great thing that he aims at by them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27.9. <HI>By this shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin.</HI> On this account, the afflictions that the Children of God are visited withal, are compared to a <HI>furnace,</HI> and to <HI>a refiners fire,</HI> in which, remaining dross is separated
<PB N="206" REF="000960_0209_0FADE45AF4C89E78"/>
from the good metal, to make it yet more pure. This good effect <HI>Job</HI> encouraged him∣self that he should obtain by his afflictions, <HI>Job</HI> 23 10. <HI>When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold</HI> And surely, that which God useth such courses with us, to take away from us, must needs be a thing, that we should en∣deavour the removal of: <HI>Job</HI> was a perfect man as to integrity, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.1. And yet he needed this trial.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y must be fully perfected in order to their perfect Glorification.</HI> Though the body o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> death attends them through the present li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and giveth them no little molestation in it, yet it shall be wholly put off with it, and they shall no more be pestered with it for e∣ver: There shall be perfection of holiness enjoyed by us, when we come to perfect glo∣ry; nor indeed can our glory be perfect without it: we are told how Christ will pre∣sent his Church to himself at last, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.27. <HI>A glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.</HI> None are admitted into the assembly above, but <HI>Just men made perfect, Heb.</HI> 12.22 When we come there we shall <HI>sin no more,</HI> nor have any dregs of pollution abiding in us, but be entirely conformed to the Image of God; now that which is the perfection which God will bring us to at last, is that which we all ought to be aspiring af∣ter, and restless in pursuit of, till we come to

Let our dependence be here for the acceptance of our poor imperfect duties, acknowledging that but for this they could not but be rejected. Let us in sense of our own imperfection, be ever bewailing of it, and go to Christ to have it sprinkled with his blood. Let us press hard all our lives after more Holiness, prosecuting it with utmost reachings; and let every new acquest by Divine help, make us the more earnest after further degrees of it, and more vigorous in the use of all means to reach them: Nor let us tire and give in, so long as we are any whit behind those who are now totally freed from sin, and in whom <HI>Grace</HI> is arrived at its full stature in <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
