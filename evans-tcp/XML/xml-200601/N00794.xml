<HEAD>A mournful Word to the merry hear∣ted in Zion; with a Word of Com∣fort to her Bowed down Mourners.</HEAD>
<P>FRIENDS that profess the self-denying way of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, (who was a Man of sorrows, and deeply ac∣quainted with grief,) and yet are of a jolly spirit, and of a merry heart, who can laugh and j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st at pleasure, saying, <HI>There is no har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in it.</HI></P>
<P>I have this to say to you, whether y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u will hear or forbear▪ that the Lord is displeased with you, and calls for Mourning and Weeping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cret places instead of Laughter and J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing in Company. And I must needs tell you, that if ever you were rightly bowed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in

You have not drunk suf∣ficiently of the Cup of trembling at the hand of the Lord, and therefore you must come down from your pleasant and delightful Seats, and be humbled as in Dust and Ashes be∣fore the Lord of Hosts, whose fire is in <HI>Zion,</HI> and his furnace in <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>; and you must pass through it again, and again, till all your dross is taken away, and all your light chaff be burnt up. O! Friends, you are those that are at ease in <HI>Zion,</HI> and have taken up a rest too soon, and now the Lord is about to disturb you, and rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you up out of your false security; Blessed are those that are willing to come forth to Judg∣ment

<P>Therefore take warning I pray you, and be humbled before the Lord, and cry mightily to him night &amp; day, that he may take vengeance speedily upon that idle and airy spirit, from whence springs th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se
