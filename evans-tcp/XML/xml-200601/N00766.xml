<HEAD>The Dedication. TO The Reverend Ministers Of the Gospel in London, Sometimes Honoured with the Name of UNITED BRETHREN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend, and Honoured Syrs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Distance of a Thousand Leagues from You, whereat the Providence of our Lord Jesus Christ▪ hath placed the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> hath not rendred them un∣concerned in <HI>Your</HI> Interests. The same Holy <HI>Spirit</HI>▪ which, from our <HI>Common Head,</HI> animates both You and Them, with the Influences of His Grace, hath Taught them, to feel with <HI>Joy,</HI> the <HI>Smiles</HI> of Heaven upon your Interests, and with
<PB REF="000923_0004_0FACA3196CC95118"/>
<HI>Grief,</HI> the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rowns</HI> of Heaven thereupon.</P>
<P>When You were a few years ago, becoming like the Primitive Believers for Your <HI>One Ac∣cord,</HI> and Embracing each other, with the Ho∣nourable Name of, UNITED BRETHREN; the <HI>Tidings were as cold waters to our thirsty Souls,</HI> in this far Countrey, and the <HI>Tidings</HI> were pro∣clamed, and Received with <HI>Joy,</HI> throughout the Churches, in these <HI>American</HI> Colonies. But I will take the Leave to Transcribe and Report unto you, some words, of the Discourse here published Eight years ago, on that memorable Occasion.
<Q><HI>Satan</HI> will doubtless endeavour to undermine this UNION: A certain King of <HI>England,</HI> holding a Treaty of Peace, with a <HI>French</HI> King, in an old Chappel that lay be∣tween their two Armies, both came to a good Agreement; but as they were coming out of the Chappel, a <HI>Snake</HI> suddenly crept out of the old Wall, which they seeing, Drew their Swords, and their Servants at the Door Drew likewise: Upon this, the whole Armies no less furiously than ignorantly advanced upon one another, and Commenced a Battel, wherein a most horrid Slaughter was made, before the mistake was Rectified. Alas, it often thus comes to pass;<NOTE PLACE="marg">[<HI>Blessed Ʋnions page</HI> 85, 86. <HI>Printed</HI> 1692.</NOTE> when the Servants of God have been just Finishing a <HI>Reconciliation</HI> the <HI>Old Serpent</HI> will interpose, &amp; interrupt it all.</Q></P>
<P>And now▪ Your Friends on this Side of the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> are with <HI>Grief</HI> making <HI>Jobs</HI> Reflecti∣on; <HI>The thing which I greatly Feared is come!</HI>
<PB REF="000923_0005_0FACA31A2F5ACD80"/>
With a very condolent <HI>Sympathy,</HI> we feel the Blowes, which the Two <HI>Sticks,</HI> that we thought <HI>made One,</HI> are giving to one another. We flat∣tered our selves with Hopes, of seeing the <HI>Wit∣nesses</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Risen</HI> out of their Graves, when we still see those very Things upon them, that made our A∣postle cry out, <HI>Nonne Cadaverosi estis</HI>? We have Heard, and Read, with no little asto∣nishment, the Contests of <HI>Ʋnited Brethren,</HI> and the efficacious Attempts of <HI>Satan</HI> to break their <HI>Ʋnion</HI>; Unable therefore to forbear thereupon the Lamentations of the Great <HI>Austin</HI> upon the Quarrels between <HI>Jerom,</HI> and <HI>Ruffin, Vae mundo a scandalis; Ecce prorsus impletur, quod veritas ait, Quoniam abundavit Iniquitas, frigescet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> multorum. Quis Amicus non formidetur quasi futurus inimicus, si potuit inter</HI> Hieronymum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ruffinum <HI>hec quod plangimus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>! O misera et miseranda Conditio</HI>!</P>
<P>Our Inveterate Adversary hath had experience for more than <HI>Five Thousand Years</HI> to teach him, That no <HI>Animosities</HI> are so fierce and strong as those that are produced by <HI>Differences</HI> in <HI>Religion; Thundrings</HI> and <HI>Lightnings,</HI> and <HI>Earthquak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> arise with most of Tempest, from the <HI>Fire</HI> of the <HI>Altar</HI>; because, in <HI>Controversies,</HI> of <HI>Divinity</HI>▪ men are easily perswaded that they are Engaged in the cause of the <HI>Deity,</HI> wherein 'tis <HI>a Good-Thing for a man to be zealously affected</HI>▪ But we in these Ends of the Earth have been taught by an experience more than <HI>Fifty Years</HI> Old, That the Minds of men are never more prone
<PB REF="000923_0006_0FACA31AE7E3F9A0"/>
unto unjustifiable Alienations, than when their <HI>Differences</HI> in <HI>Religion</HI> turn upon the point of, <HI>A Sinners Justification before God</HI>: Strange! Nothing raises more sinful <HI>Variance,</HI> and <HI>Preju∣dice,</HI> in men, towards one another, than their Opinions about the Doctrines of a <HI>Sinners Re∣conciliation unto God</HI>; and the <HI>Controversies,</HI> a∣bout the Methods of our coming to a <HI>Peace</HI> with <HI>Heaven,</HI> cause most of <HI>Strife</HI> upon <HI>Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Now albeit the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> have had nothing to disturb them, in their Enjoy∣ing the <HI>Comforts</HI> of <HI>Ʋnion</HI> in that <HI>Important Ar∣ticle</HI> of our <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> for many <HI>Lustres</HI> of years; yet we must humbly crave leave of our Ever-Honoured Brethren, in the City of <HI>London,</HI> to inform them, That it is inexpressibly <HI>Ʋncomfortable</HI> unto us, to understand the Shocks of late given to their <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> in their <HI>Contro∣versies</HI> upon that Article.</P>
<P>And indeed, Sirs, 'tis no less <HI>Ʋnaccountable</HI> unto us, than <HI>Ʋncomfortable.</HI> We can see much Reason that you should <HI>Contend earnestly for the Faith once delivered unto the Saints,</HI> in this Great matter; but we cannot see so much Rea∣son that you should <HI>Contend so much with one another.</HI></P>
<P>We find our Worthy and Honoured <HI>Brethren,</HI> who have been distinguished by the Name of <HI>Congregatio∣nal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">[<HI>See, the Declara∣tion of the Congrega∣tional Ministers, in</HI> London, <HI>against</HI> Antinomian <HI>Errors: Printed,</HI> 1698.]</NOTE> Expressly declaring,
<Q><HI>That</HI> the <HI>Elect,</HI> before they Believe, are not personally and Actually <HI>Justifyed</HI> in the
<PB REF="000923_0007_0FACA31BB1EF66C8"/>
Court of Heaven, but by Believing they are so <HI>Justifyed: That</HI> God seeth the Sins of His own People, and is <HI>Displeased</HI> with them for their Sins, and when Believers do Sin, it is their Duty to <HI>Humble</HI> themselves <HI>Confess</HI> their Sins, and <HI>Pray</HI> for Pardon: <HI>That</HI> since the Sins of Believers, do Impair their <HI>Graces,</HI> and <HI>Com∣forts,</HI> Harden their Hearts, wound their Con∣sciences, Hurt and Scandalize others, Grieve Gods Holy Spirit, Expose to His Fatherly Displeasure, and bring Temporal Judgments upon them; their Sins <HI>Hurt</HI> them, and they should be afraid to Commit them: <HI>That Sav∣ing Faith</HI> lies not in a full Perswasion and Assurance, that our Sins are actually Pardon∣ed; and <HI>Marks</HI> and <HI>Signs</HI> for the <HI>Trials</HI> of our Spiritual Estate are to be sought after: and <HI>Sanctification</HI> Evidenced by the Spirit of God, unto our Consciences, is a certain Sign and Mark of our <HI>Justification; That</HI> the <HI>Law,</HI> de∣livered by <HI>Moses,</HI> continues in its Commands and Curses, <HI>Ʋndissolv'd</HI>; and still is of use, to convince of Sin, that we may see a need of Christ; and therefore is to be <HI>Preached</HI>; and we are to look unto it: <HI>That</HI> though men want Ability to Believe Savingly, yet its the Duty of Gospel Ministers, to make the <HI>Offer,</HI> and Testify unto them, that whoever Believes and Repents shall be Saved; and its the Peoples Duty, to make use of their Natural Faculties, with such External means and workings of the Spirit, as God affords them, that, they may Believe, and Repent, and be
<PB REF="000923_0008_0FACA31C6FED5920"/>
Saved: <HI>That</HI> our Sins were not so laid upon Christ, as to make Him every way as <HI>Sinful</HI> as we; and we are not every way as Righ∣teous as Christ: And none may Expect to be Pardoned in a state of Unbelief and Impeni∣tence; And continued Repentance with Holi∣ness, are necessary to our possession of Eter∣nal Life.</Q></P>
<P>Truly, We cannot imagine, why the Bre∣thren of this perswasion, should be Reproached, or Suspected for <HI>Antinomians.</HI></P>
<P>But we also find our Honoured and Worthy <HI>Brethren,</HI> who have been distinguished by the Name of <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> on all occasions asser∣ting and adoring the <HI>Grace</HI> of the <HI>Holy Gospel.</HI> It were easy from the writtings of such Great men, as (to mention only one <HI>Fratrum Dulce par,</HI>) Dr. <HI>Manton</HI> and Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> to Extract, as rare Schemes of Evangelical <HI>Truth,</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> as any of us all can desire. But what needs it? When besides what hath occurr'd in the <HI>Paci∣ficatory Papers,</HI> which the most Eminent among them have sign'd and sent unto those that have been Jealous of them, their <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>[<HI>Se Dr.</HI> Manton, <HI>on Heb.</HI> 11.4▪ <HI>And Dr.</HI> Bates, <HI>on Psal.</HI> 130.4]</P>
<P>[<HI>Conf. of Faith, Agreed by the As∣sembly of Divines, at</HI> Westminster. <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. <HI>Art.</HI> 1]</P></NOTE> ex∣pressly declares,
<Q>Those whom God effectually <HI>Call∣eth,</HI> He also freely <HI>Justifi∣eth</HI>; not by Infusing Righ∣teousness into them, but by Pardoning their Sins, and by accounting &amp; accepting their persons as Righteous;
<PB REF="000923_0009_0FACA31D23BFB7D8"/>
not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christs sake alone; not by Imputing▪ Faith it self, the Act of Believing, or any other Evangelical Obedience to them, as their Righteousness: but by Imputing the O∣bedience and Satisfaction of Christ unto them; they Receiving and Resting on Him, and His Righteousness, by Faith, which Faith, they have not of themselves, it is the Gift of God.</Q>
Brethren that are thus perswaded, cannot wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>out Extreme Injury, be called, <HI>Arminians.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly, We have the Testimony of that <HI>Man of an Excellent Spirit,</HI> the Reverend Mr. <HI>How</HI>:
<Q>We are all agreed, <HI>That</HI> a Sinner, can never be Saved, but he must be <HI>Justified,</HI> and he must be <HI>Sanctified: That</HI> such <HI>Justification,</HI> and such <HI>Sanctification,</HI> are both the Effects of most absolutely free and Sovereign Grace: <HI>That</HI> the <HI>Righteousness</HI> is entirely and only <HI>Christs,</HI> by which we are <HI>Justified,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> is most entire∣ly and only <HI>Christs,</HI> by which we are <HI>San∣ctified: That</HI> whoever doth sincerely, Evange∣lically <HI>Believe</HI> in God through Christ, Re∣ceive Christ, and is United with Him; and by serious <HI>Repentance</HI> turn to God, and having been made willing in the day of His Power, doth now render sincere <HI>Obedience</HI> to Him; Every such one is Accepted with God: others are liable to abiding wrath: <HI>That</HI> such <HI>Faith,</HI> such <HI>Repentance,</HI> such <HI>Obedience,</HI> even in the most entire Sincerity, are not to be con∣sidered at all, as any cause of a Persons
<PB REF="000923_0010_0FACA31DE9CCD9F8"/>
Acceptance with God; they Characterize the Accepted Person, but cause it not; no inter∣nal Work of the Holy Ghost can be any part of the <HI>Righteousness,</HI> that must <HI>Justify</HI> us before God.</Q></P>
<P>Reverend Syrs▪ let it not be a <HI>Wonder</HI> to you, that your <HI>Divisions</HI> are <HI>so</HI> to <HI>us,</HI> when we can discover so little, that is left for you to <HI>Divide</HI> upon. 'Tis a frequent Occurrence in the <HI>World, Maxima Odia ex levissimis Cau∣sis</HI>; but when such a Thing Occurs in the <HI>Church,</HI> it must certainly be reckoned among the <HI>Devices of Satan,</HI> and, why may it not be ascribed unto his <HI>Energies</HI>? However, We do not see the <HI>least Cause,</HI> for <HI>You,</HI> O ye Men of God, to be suspicious of Each other, as having a Design to betray the <HI>Pro∣testant Religion,</HI> and maintain your Suspicions, with a strong Indisposition to be Cured of those <HI>Evil Surmises</HI>: For <HI>You,</HI> to disparage the Per∣sons and Labours and discourage the Ministry of Each other, and seem to delight in occa∣sions for Disparagement: For <HI>You,</HI> to write against each other, with poinant Invectives; or, do any thing but that whereby <HI>Men may know, that ye are the Disciples</HI> of the Patient JESUS; any thing that can't stand before the <HI>Thirteenth Chapter,</HI> in the <HI>First Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI></P>
<P>We do acknowledge, that in Explaining the Illustrious Article of, JUSTIFICATION, there may be <HI>Varieties</HI> of <HI>Expression</HI> among you. But are they such, we beseech you, as will <HI>Justify</HI>
<PB REF="000923_0011_0FACA31EA75AF768"/>
all the <HI>Discord</HI> that hath arisen thereupon? The words of the Incomparable Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> in his Golden Book, of <HI>Justifica∣tion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">[<HI>pag.</HI> 79, 80]</NOTE> are worthy to be written in Letters of Gold:
<Q>Among per∣sons, who agree in the <HI>Substance</HI> of the Doctrine, there is some Difference about the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> whereby we are Justified, with its proper <HI>Object</HI> in Justifying, and its <HI>Ʋse</HI> in Justification. And an instance we have herein, not only of the weakness of our In∣tellects, in the Apprehension of Spiritual Things, but also of the Remainders of <HI>Con∣fusion</HI> and <HI>Disorder</HI> in our Minds, at least, how true it is, that we <HI>know only in part,</HI> while we are in this Life. For whereas, this Faith is an <HI>Act of our minds,</HI> put forth in the way of <HI>Duty</HI> to God, yet many by whom it is Sincerely Exerc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed, and that continually, are not agreed either in the <HI>Nature</HI> or proper <HI>Ob∣ject</HI> of it. And notwithstanding this <HI>Difference,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do yet <HI>all of them please God,</HI> in the Exercise of <HI>Faith,</HI> as it is their <HI>Duty,</HI> and have that Respect unto its proper <HI>Object</HI> that Secures both their <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Salvation.</HI> And if we cannot on this Consideration <HI>bear with,</HI> and <HI>forbear</HI> one another, in our <HI>Different Conceptions,</HI> and Expressions of those Concep∣tions, it is a Sign we have a great mind to be <HI>Contentious,</HI> and that our <HI>Confidences</HI> are built on very weak foundations.</Q></P>
<P>But how marvellous a thing is it, that your
<PB REF="000923_0012_0FACA32024403E30"/>
<HI>Contentions</HI> do continue, after one side hath gone so far as to tell the other, <HI>If you atten∣tively and deliberately weigh, what we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as∣serted on the Article of Justification, we are Con∣fident, it will Evidently and Ʋndeniably appear, that we perfectly agree with our Brethren, in the Evangelical Doctrine of Justification, even in the very phrases, and modes of Expression</HI>?</P>
<P>Honoured Sirs; We cannot conceal from you, some of those Afflictive Resentments, that your Friends as far off as <HI>America,</HI> have had upon your <HI>Contentions.</HI> We have <HI>Mourn'd,</HI> as often as we have Thought, how much the <HI>Dove</HI> like <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, hath been distasted by the over-flowings of <HI>Gall,</HI> that we have seen, in some Disputations; and <HI>Grieved</HI> by your <HI>Bitterness</HI> towards one another. That <HI>Spirit, in You,</HI> (O ye Followers the <HI>Lamb,</HI>) it <HI>Lusteth</HI> AGAINST <HI>Envy</HI>: You need not be told, That <HI>Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife,</HI> and <HI>Envyings,</HI> are <HI>Works of the Flesh,</HI> to be mor∣tified by that <HI>Spirit.</HI> We have <HI>Mourn'd,</HI> when we have Thought, What <HI>Scandal,</HI> and what <HI>Scoffing,</HI> hath been afforded unto our Common Enemies, by the Treats that you have given unto one another; <HI>They</HI> have <HI>had you greatly in Derision: because you have declined from the Law of the Lord,</HI> whose Dying <HI>Prayer,</HI> and <HI>Charge</HI> it was, <HI>That we should Love one another.</HI> But <HI>we</HI> Remember with Horror, what horrible Storms quickly came upon the Primitive <HI>Christians,</HI> when the <HI>Feuds</HI> among them, were such as to be
<PB REF="000923_0013_0FACA320E2C444C0"/>
Exposed upon the <HI>Pagan</HI> Theatres. We have <HI>Mourn'd,</HI> when we have Thought, what In∣valuable <HI>Opportunities,</HI> to get a Redress of Troublesome Inconveniencies yet remaining upon you, have been Lost, while your <HI>Time,</HI> and <HI>Zeal</HI> hath been misemploy'd, in Studying how to Trouble one another. When your Father <HI>Abraham,</HI> was making overtures of Accommodation to his Kinsman, God imme∣diately shew'd him the <HI>Land of Promise,</HI> and said, <HI>All this Land, unto thee will</HI> I <HI>give it.</HI> But alas, why should Good men, do any thing to delay the Enjoyment of <HI>Promised,</HI> and Expected Salvations! We have <HI>Trembled,</HI> when we have se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n our Nation, by a <HI>Flood</HI> of Wickedness, Ripening apace for the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, and for an <HI>Overflowing Scourge</HI>; and we have been <HI>Afraid,</HI> lest the <HI>Day of Temptation,</HI> of late upon <HI>You,</HI> may have produced those miscarriages, that shall defeat you, of a Share, in any Notable preservation, from the <HI>Day of Destruction,</HI> that <HI>Some</HI> fear to be at hand. Were there any likelihood, that the Fury of the <HI>Caroline Perse∣cution,</HI> could be Revived by any future changes upon the Nation, according to the Good-will, that <HI>High Church-men</HI> continue to Express unto that way of handling you, how likely would be new Sorrows to Chastise your misimprove∣ment of your wondrously Restored Liberty▪ and, <HI>How Righteous the Dealings of God</HI>! With∣out such a Supposition, if little <HI>Birds</HI> will never leave off P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cking at one another, they may soon find, if they will give themselves the Liesure
<PB REF="000923_0014_0FACA321A2C01288"/>
to <HI>Think,</HI> whence there may come a great <HI>Kite</HI> that may Devour all. Or, Suppose a <HI>Plague</HI> (which Mercy forbid) should e're long break forth, upon the bravest and biggest City in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>; the <HI>Scratches</HI> that the Servants of God, have been giving to one another, (which are indeed, <HI>Abominations to be Sigh'd for</HI>!) would be but poor <HI>Marks,</HI> to recommend them unto the <HI>Angels</HI> of Protection! When the Apostle could say, to the <HI>Corinthians, I hear there be Divisions among you,</HI> it was not long before he said, <HI>Many are Weak and Sick among you, and many Sleep.</HI> In Short, We want words, to des∣cribe our <HI>Agony!</HI></P>
<P>Now, because we hoped, it might have some little Tendency, towards the <HI>Cure</HI> of your Dissensions, and Distemper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to let you know, how uneasy they be to the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> where you are most Highly Esteem∣ed, and where you have whole Provinces and Colonies, of your <HI>Ʋnited Brethren,</HI> the Pastors of those Churches, that met a while since in <HI>Boston,</HI> desired some care to be taken, That their dearest Resp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts unto you, might <HI>some way</HI> be signified, with their Hearty Wishes, That the Glorious Graces of the Lord Jesus Christ which adorn you, may prevail over the Distempers of your present <HI>Controversies,</HI> and preserve among you the <HI>Blessed</HI> Name of, UNITED BRETHREN.</P>
<P>Wherefore, being very sure of their Concu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rence to such Wishes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>humbly Take <HI>This Way,</HI>

My Reverend Fathers and Brethren, to Sollicit your <HI>Second Thoughts</HI> upon your <HI>Controversies,</HI> and your laying aside all <HI>Strife</HI>▪ but that of <HI>Love,</HI> May the Souls of your <HI>American</HI> Brethren, that ardently Pray and Long for it, be Refreshed, with the <HI>Melody</HI> of your <HI>Concord</HI>; and may all the Symptoms of <HI>Displeasure</HI> in you against one another, be forever so extinguished, that there may therein be no Tokens of Heavens being <HI>Displeased</HI> at both.

<P>THAT Celebrated saying of <HI>Luthers,</HI> That the Doctrine of <HI>Justification,</HI> is, <HI>Articulus stantis aut cadentis Ecclesiae,</HI> ha's been found most true. It is the <HI>Crisis,</HI> the chief indication of the Churches state, which will <HI>Stand</HI> or <HI>Fall</HI> with <HI>this Truth.</HI> The Churches in <HI>Galatia</HI> Embraced <HI>another Gospel,</HI> when they let go this principle, <HI>That we are Justified by the alone Righteousness of Christ apprehended by Faith.</HI> The parting with <HI>this Truth</HI> has also proved fatal to the <HI>Romish Synagogue</HI>: Without doubt <HI>Paul</HI> was acted by a <HI>Prophetick Spirit,</HI> when in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> he did so largely in∣sist on this Subject.</P>
<P>We esteem the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches to be in several points <HI>Heterodox:</HI> And in some things (especially in the Doctrine of <HI>Free-Will</HI>) in which <HI>Luther</HI> himself (who was a great Cham∣pion) did strenuously assert the Truth, they have deserted him.

<P>THE <HI>Justification of a Sinner,</HI> in the Sight of God, being a matter of greatest Importance, and Concern∣ment to the Souls of men; it hath been the Practice of the Ministers of <HI>New-England,</HI> (according to my Observation) from the Beginning, frequently to acquaint their People with, or to insist upon the true Doctrine of <HI>Justification,</HI> according to the word of GOD; and the <HI>Confession</HI> of our Faith, and concurrence of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Divines and Churches in other parts of the World: and for divers of the most Eminent of the first Ministers to leave upon record the same Doctrine in their Printed works for the benefit of Poste∣rity; Such as Mr▪ <HI>Hooker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Richard Mather,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chaney,</HI> Mr. <HI>Shepard</HI> and Mr. <HI>Norton</HI>: in which Practise they have been followed by the Minister who have succeeded them: As there was a very useful Discourse of Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> on Justification, Published some few years ago; So here is now presented to the Readers view, another little Treatise on the same Subject▪ containing <HI>no other Doctrine of Justification, then
<PB REF="000923_0021_0FACA326F1FDF940"/>
what hath been Preached and Received in</HI> New-England <HI>from the beginning.</HI></P>
<P>It is true indeed that in our first times and for some few years, the <HI>Peace</HI> of these Churches was disturbed by a Company of real <HI>Antinomi∣ans,</HI> who zealously crying up the <HI>free Grace</HI> of God, and the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of Christ for <HI>Justifi∣cation</HI>; but grossly neglecting, slighting and vilifying the Graces and Duties of <HI>Sanctification,</HI> they made their folly appear unto all men, and their Religion quickly came to an end. For by their general removal out of this Colony to <HI>Road-Island</HI> (a place where they might every one <HI>do what was right in their own eyes</HI>) they shew∣ed themselves to be meer <HI>Libertines,</HI> and down∣right <HI>Worldlings:</HI> contenting themselves with the accommodations of a fruitful Island, they cast off the very <HI>Form of Religion</HI>; they and their Posterity (for the generality of them) living about these threescore years past, without any <HI>Churches, Ministers, Ordinances,</HI> or keeping of the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> only professing <HI>Liberty of Con∣science</HI> at large, that men might there be of <HI>any Religion</HI> or <HI>no Religion,</HI> as they would them∣selves: this is notoriously known to all <HI>New-England.</HI> So dreadfully dangerous it is to <HI>turn the Grace of God into Wantonness,</HI> and to pervert the Doctrine of <HI>Justification.</HI></P>
<P>After that Storm was over, and ever since (in my Observation) the Ministers and Chur∣ches of <HI>New-England</HI> have retained and maintain∣ed
<PB REF="000923_0022_0FACA327A89E3D38"/>
the true Doctrine of <HI>Justification,</HI> with an equal care of the true Doctrine &amp; Practice of <HI>Sanctifica∣tion</HI> to be forever joyned with it; professing also and proclaiming to all men, that we take the <HI>Law</HI> of God in his <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> to be the <HI>Rule of Life</HI>; and yet so, as to Fence against the other Extream of Establishing any <HI>Righte∣ousness of our own,</HI> which is equally dangerous to the Souls of men, and which we all naturally and habitually are enclined to, seeking to be Justified, either by works without Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist, or some way or other joyning them with Christ. Hence they have constantly affirmed &amp; maintained, that the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of Christ alone, (<HI>viz.</HI> Christs O∣bedience to the <HI>Law</HI> in <HI>our Stead</HI>) is the only <HI>Material</HI> and <HI>Meritorious</HI> cause, and Gods gra∣cious <HI>Imputation</HI> thereof unto Believers, is the only formal cause of our <HI>Justification</HI>; whence it is that our Sins are pardoned, and persons are accepted as righteous unto Eternal Life.</P>
<P>As for the Reverend and Worthy <HI>Author</HI> of this ensuing work; after he had published ma∣ny fruitful Treatises on other Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts, he hath obliged his Native Country by the Publishing of <HI>This,</HI> which we have now in our hands; which though <HI>Small in Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,</HI> yet is <HI>Great in Worth</HI> and Usefulness; that in my apprehension it may be called <HI>Medulla Theologiae,</HI> in the matter of our <HI>Justification,</HI> and so much the rather, because it is not handled in a way of <HI>Con∣troversy,</HI> but of clearing the <HI>Positive Truth</HI> in re∣lation to so great a Concernment to the Souls of men.</P>
<P><PB REF="000923_0023_0FACA3286A127648"/>Truly, I am not without some hope but that (through the blessing of God) it may be a means of some good, not onely to our selves in <HI>New England,</HI> but also to our Brethren in our Mother <HI>England,</HI> from whence we came. It hath too often been credibly reported here, that for several years, the dissenting Churches and Ministers in <HI>London,</HI> have been under an <HI>Hour of Temptation</HI> by means of <HI>Controversies</HI> raised amongst them, about the Doctrine of <HI>Justifi∣cation,</HI> Preaching and Writing one against ano∣ther, with personal reflections, and passionate expressions, causing Animosities, Distances, and Divisions, to the hindring of Edification: con∣cerning which it may be said, as the Apostle did, <HI>My Brethren these things ought not so to be</HI>: it is to be wished they had never been, and that they may be Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inguished as soon as may be, and that all <HI>Good Means</HI> may be used for that <HI>End.</HI> And who knows but that this Servant of God, though a <HI>Junio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to many of the Reve∣rend Eld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs now contending (as <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b</HI> and his Friends) may (as another <HI>Elihu</HI>) by ascribing all the Glory of <HI>Righteousness</HI> to his <HI>Maker</HI> and R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deemer, and by making <HI>mention of his Righ∣teousness, even of his only,</HI> contribute some∣thing towards the <HI>Reconciliation,</HI> right under∣standing, and good agreement of the <HI>Diss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nting Parties.</HI></P>
<P>But when? <HI>O when</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will the Lord perswade the hearts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Servants, to practise according

<P>I Remember that our good old Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> though he differed from some of his Brethren in the <HI>Souls Preparation for Christ,</HI> yet thus Expres∣sed himself; <HI>Our Brethren speak of Preparative Works, now though some declare such works to be preparations to Conversion, which others take to be fruits of Conversion, yet we all agree in this, that such works must be, and are, in all that are under the Effectual working of the Word and Spirit of Christ, and so the Difference is but Logical, and not Theologica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for we agree in the same truth for the main, though we Express it in a different manner.</HI> In such cases if we cannot judge or speak one and the same <HI>truth,</HI> in one and the same <HI>way,</HI> we must learn, <HI>Placide ferre contra Sentient<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> mildly b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar with difference of judgment one in ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her.

endeavouring to state the <HI>Truth</HI> right between these, and call upon <HI>Christians</HI> to see to their principles and practices in this regard, it is <HI>now.</HI> It is certain, that there is but <HI>One way</HI> for fallen man to be Saved, and that is by <HI>Christ</HI>: It is equally certain, that they who would be Saved by Christ, must be entituled to his <HI>Righteousness</HI>; and that they may so be, they must utterly forgo their own: and <HI>Christs Righteousness</HI> becomes ours only by <HI>Faith</HI> on our part, which is thus derived to us by Gods gracious <HI>Imputation,</HI> according to the tenour of the <HI>New-Covenant.</HI> There was a <HI>Righteousness</HI> required of man, by the <HI>first Co∣venant,</HI> under the penalty of <HI>Death</HI> on defect; his failing in it brings him under <HI>Condemnation</HI>: If he be <HI>Justifyed,</HI> it must be consonant to the <HI>Law</HI> that Condemns him; he must then be found <HI>Righteous,</HI> else he cannot be <HI>Justifyed.</HI> That he may be so, there must be a <HI>Righteousness</HI> that answers all the demands of that Law; and this <HI>Righteousness</HI> must be his, else it will not stand for him: he hath none such <HI>Personal,</HI> nor is capable of it, as the case at present stands, since there is not only the Command to be per∣fectly obeyed, but the forfeiture to be <HI>Satisfyed</HI> for, which he is every way incapable of com∣plying with in himself. It is therefore only the <HI>Righteousness of Christ</HI> that will do; and that this may be his, it must be <HI>Imputed</HI> unto him by God, which is only done upon his <HI>Believing</HI>▪ this then alone can be his <HI>Justifying R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghteousness before God.</HI> But this di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chargeth him not from the <HI>Law</HI> as a <HI>Rule,</HI> but adds new obligations to
<PB REF="000923_0031_0FACA32F2DE6CB20"/>
his performing of sincere Obedience to it: and though it be not a <HI>Condition</HI> of <HI>Justification,</HI> it is yet a <HI>Qualification</HI> of one that is <HI>Justifyed,</HI> and without which he cannot be Saved, that he be <HI>Sanctifyed</HI> throughout. A mistake then in this affair, is of no less Consequence than the loss of a Soul. The ensuing Discourse on this weighty and necessary Subject will therefore be very welcome to any that are duely concerned about their own Salvation, and desirous to be guided in the way to it. There is no <HI>Justifyed Believer</HI> but will be able to Seal to the Truths here declared, on his own Experience; and the <HI>Awakened Sinner,</HI> who is Sollicitous to be rightly informed in his greatest concern, will here have a clue to lead him right, and help him to steer safe between the rocks on the one hand, and the quicksands on the other. For my own part, I must profess, that I was abundantly satisfyed in, and not a little affected with the delivery of these Truths in the <HI>Preaching</HI>; the solidity of the matter, agreeable to the <HI>Gospel of Christ,</HI> and calculated to the sound Judgment of our most Excellent <HI>Reformers</HI>: and the manner, being with great Solemnity, for the Awakening of mens Consciences, and engaging to a seri∣ous Examination of their Foundation, and careful endeavour not to be <HI>found</HI> in any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her <HI>Righteousness</HI> in the great Day: So that I was glad to hear of the making them more Capable of being a Publick benefit. The Doctrine here Delivered, is what was <HI>Declared to the Saints of Old</HI>; it is the <HI>Faith,</HI>
<PB REF="000923_0032_0FACA32FE5806EF0"/>
in which alone I have any Hope of Eternal Life: <HI>If these Truths fall, the Gospel must fall with them.</HI> If the Errors of the times draw men off from <HI>this Foundation,</HI> they will be found on the <HI>Sand</HI> when the Storm cometh, and then Wo to them. I am satisfyed <HI>if the Righteousness of Christ were more prized by us, there would be more real Holiness Practised among us.</HI> My request to God is, that He will Succeed these Faithful Labours of his Servant, with all his other Industrious Endea∣vours, for much Good and Edification: And for the Reverend Author, my wish is, <HI>Serus in C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lum redeas</HI>: Let God Bless his indefatigable thirsting to do Good in his Generation, with a long continuance in his <HI>Harvest,</HI> and dayly experience of plentiful Success.</P>

<P>THE mind of man, is never Ex∣ercised about a more Impor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt CASE than This; <HI>How may Sinful Man be made Righteous?</HI> And the Mind of every Reasonable man must by Thoughts upon this Important CASE, be often cast into Agonies. God, <HI>that forms the Spirit of man within him,</HI> hath <HI>formed</HI> in the <HI>Spirit</HI> of man a <HI>Conscience,</HI> which, in all men that are not Stup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied and Brutified with Senseless wickedness, does with distress think upon
<PB N="2" REF="000923_0034_0FACA33164B27860"/>
that Great Question, <HI>How may I arrive to a Righ∣teousness, that may Entitle me unto the Favours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> God</HI>? Unto this Great Question of every Awak∣ened mind, there is a Satisfying Answer given in the <HI>Gospel</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; and there is no little Demonstration and Confir∣mation of the Christian Religion in this Glory of the Gospel, <HI>That no Religion else, gives an Answer to it, that will in any measure Satisfy.</HI> The <HI>Superstitions</HI> Practised among the ungos∣pellized Nations of the Earth, to obtain a <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> before God, are indeed so very Ridicu∣lous, that no part of mankind, except strangely Enchanted, could be contented with such l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il Practices. The very <HI>Recital</HI> of them, would be a <HI>Comedy.</HI> But the methods of obtain∣ing <HI>Righteousness,</HI> prescribed in the <HI>Christian Re∣ligion,</HI> are full of an evidently Glorious Ma∣jesty: There is nothing in them, unworthy of a <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>That Renowned Preacher of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> our Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> therefore tells the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> That <HI>he is not Ashamed of Preaching the Gospel.</HI> I pray, Sir; Why not? He Replye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Because 'tis that which the <HI>Salvation</HI> of Sinful man, will Turn upon his Receiving, or his Re∣jecting of: And this is manifest, because the only way, how Sinful man may attain unto <HI>Righteousness</HI> is therein <HI>Revealed.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Righteousness</HI> for Sinful man <HI>Revealed</HI> in the Gospel, is called, <HI>The Righteousness of God</HI>; And when it is here said, That it is <HI>Revealed from Faith to Faith,</HI> 'tis an Expression full of Emph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tical
<PB N="3" REF="000923_0035_0FACA33228AB4140"/>
and Remarkable Significations. But the Sum of them all is, <HI>That by Faith, we Appre∣hend this Righteousness:</HI> And that there is <HI>to Faith</HI> Revealed, the <HI>Righteousness,</HI> wherein <HI>by Faith</HI> we are <HI>Interested</HI></P>
<P>In the Epistle to the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> the Arti∣cle of a Sinners being made <HI>Righteous</HI> through <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness of God,</HI> is by the Spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Prophecy most agreeably insisted on: The Holy Spirit foresaw, that the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> would fall into an horrible <HI>Apostasy,</HI> which would very much ly in their confounding that very Article. 'Tis an Article in which lies the very <HI>Marrow</HI> of the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel</HI>! Give Attention, O my Hearers, Give a Great Attention to this most <HI>Glorious Gospel of God</HI>; And, <HI>Hearken, O People, Every one of You.</HI></P>
<P>That which now Entertains you, is this <HI>Doctrine of God your Saviour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Righteousness of God Revealed in the Gospel is Apprehended by the Faith of Every Sinful man that is ever made a Righteous one.</HI></P>
<P>That Illustrious CASE; <HI>How the</HI> JUSTIFI∣CATION <HI>of a Sinner is brought about</HI>? must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e now discoursed and discussed.</P>
<P>The First part of our Discourse must be, to <HI>Explain</HI> this <HI>Gospel</HI> in several <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="4" REF="000923_0036_0FACA332E96FBA20"/>
<HEAD>PROPOSITION. I.</HEAD>
<P>A man cannot be <HI>Righteous</HI> before God, and Accepted and Entitled unto Life, without the <HI>Righteousness of God</HI> Imputed unto him.</P>
<P>Now, to set this All concerning Truth, in a fair View before you all, it must be in general premised, <HI>That Righteousness is that full conformity and Obedience unto the Law of God, which gives a Right unto the Benefits, that are promised unto such Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>More particularly,</P>
<P>We are to know, That God gave unto man, His <HI>Commandment</HI> in the way of a <HI>Covenant.</HI> The <HI>Commandment</HI> thus given by God unto man, is contained in the <HI>Moral Law</HI> God by His <HI>Commandment</HI> required man to perform all the Duties of <HI>Piety,</HI> of <HI>Equity,</HI> and of <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity,</HI> without the least Failure in any circumstance. <HI>Love</HI> to God, <HI>Hope</HI> on God, and <HI>Joy</HI> in God, with an Observance of <HI>Every Thing</HI> that He shall either by the Light of Nature, or by further Command, enjoyn upon us; And all This, without the least, <HI>Imperfection,</HI> or <HI>Interruption</HI>▪ This is the <HI>Moral Law.</HI> And this <HI>Commandment</HI> was put into the Form of a <HI>Covenant,</HI> by Ratifying it with <HI>Promises,</HI> and <HI>Threatnings: Promises</HI> of Blessedness, as the Recompence of <HI>Well-doing; Threatnings</HI> of Misery, upon the least <HI>Rebelli∣on.</HI> So we read, in Matth. 19 17. <HI>If thou wilt Enter into Life, keep the Commandments</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="000923_0037_0FACA333B1AF0650"/>
And so we read, in Gal. 3.10. <HI>Cursed is E∣very One that continueth not in all Things.</HI></P>
<P>We are to know, That the <HI>Commandment</HI> given by God unto man, in that <HI>Covenant,</HI> is the <HI>Rule of Righteousness.</HI> That <HI>Righteousness</HI> whereon is our Claim to <HI>Happiness,</HI> must needs relate unto some <HI>Rule</HI> or other. Indeed <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> is but a <HI>Regular</HI> Acting, an Acting according to <HI>Rule.</HI> The <HI>Righteousness</HI> of man, must ly in his Agreeableness unto the <HI>Rule</HI> that God hath given him. Now the <HI>Law</HI> which God gave unto man, at his First Cre∣ation, is the <HI>Rule</HI> of his <HI>Righteousness</HI>; yea, 'Tis an Eternal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Inviolable, an U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lterable <HI>Rule.</HI> Is that <HI>Law</HI> abrogated! No, Nor never shall it be abrogated throughout Eter∣nal Ages: God will forever <HI>Magnify it, and make it Honourable.</HI> The substance of this <HI>Law,</HI> is, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at man</HI> do universally and un∣changeably cleave to <HI>God,</HI> with all his Fa∣culties, is his Best Good, and his Last End, and his Only Lord; and Obey His Will in all things that he knowes to be so, in which Way soever, and at what Time soever, it be made known unto him. And as long as <HI>God</HI> shall be <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> be <HI>Man,</HI> this <HI>Law</HI> will be in force; Take away this <HI>Law,</HI> and we have no standard of <HI>Righteousness</HI> left unto us. To imagine this <HI>Law</HI> so divested of its Power, to demand <HI>perfect Obedience,</HI> that What is not so, shall be accepted as <HI>Righteousness ac∣cording to Law,</HI> is to <HI>speak Evil of the Law.</HI> Hence we thus Read, in Rom. 3.31. <HI>Do we
<PB N="6" REF="000923_0038_0FACA3346EAC1EC0"/>
make void the Law through Faith? God Forbid: Yea, we Establish the Law.</HI></P>
<P>We are to know finally, That man by Sin∣ning against the <HI>Commandment</HI> of God, is fallen short of <HI>Righteousness.</HI> Truly, No man is able to come up Exactly unto the will of God, in any one Point of the <HI>Law</HI>; but his <HI>Carnal mind</HI> is full of <HI>Enmity</HI> against that Will. And if he could exactly come up to it in every point of the <HI>Law,</HI> yet That could not make A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onement for those Violations of it, wherewith every man is Chargeable. The <HI>First man</HI> immediately Sinn'd against God, in <HI>One</HI> remarkable Instance, wherein the Sovereign Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> made a <HI>Tryal</HI> of his Fidelity. Immediately poor man, lost not only his <HI>Innocency,</HI> but also his <HI>Ability</HI> He <HI>fell short of the Glory of God</HI>; and all his Offspring sell in him and with him. Hence we thus read, in Rom. 5.6. <HI>We are without Strength, and Ʋngod∣ly.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, That the Elect of God may be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aved</HI> from their Sins, and that the <HI>Justice</HI> as well as the <HI>Mercy,</HI> the <HI>Wisdom,</HI> as well as the <HI>Justice</HI> of God, may be glorified in our Salvati∣on; Behold, what a Wonderful Thing is come to pass!</P>
<P>First. There is a glorious <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which our Lord JESUS CHRIST hath <HI>brought in</HI> be∣fore God, for the use of His chosen People An Angel from Heaven once told this thing to a man <HI>Beloved of God,</HI> in Dan. 9.24. The <HI>Messiah,</HI> shall <HI>bring in Everlasting Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000923_0039_0FACA335247B7A40"/>Now the <HI>Righteousness</HI> thus <HI>brought in</HI> by our Lord Jesus Christ, is not His <HI>Essential Righteous∣ness,</HI> or the Holiness, which as He is <HI>God,</HI> be∣longs unto Him. 'Tis His <HI>Mediatorial Righte∣ousness</HI> which our Lord <HI>brings in</HI> for us, or a <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> wherein He acts as a <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and Us. And yet this Expression also is too Wide; The whole <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord, in the Discharge of His <HI>Med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>torial Office</HI> never can be made ours. More particularly then; Tis that part of our Lords <HI>Mediatorial Righte∣ousness,</HI> which belongs to His <HI>Priestly Office,</HI> that He <HI>brings in</HI> for us. The <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord as He is our <HI>Prophet,</HI> and our <HI>King,</HI> 'tis for our <HI>Advantage.</HI> Tis for our <HI>Advantage,</HI> that, as a <HI>Prophet,</HI> He <HI>Speaks in Righteousness,</HI> and as a <HI>King,</HI> He <HI>Reigns in Righteousness.</HI> But what He does <HI>Righteously</HI> in the Execution either of His <HI>Pro∣phetical,</HI> or His <HI>Kingly Office,</HI> is not the <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> intended for us. It is only as He is a <HI>Priest,</HI> that He <HI>brings in</HI> a <HI>Righteousness</HI> for His People. But still this Expression likewise is too wide. There are some things done for us, by our Lord, as He is our <HI>Priest,</HI> as namely, His <HI>Intercession</HI> with God, which are no part of the <HI>Righte∣ousness,</HI> that He <HI>brings in</HI> for us. But then still more particularly; This <HI>Righteousness</HI> is the <HI>Sponsory Righteousness</HI> of our Lord, or the <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> which our Lord in the Capacity of a <HI>Surety,</HI> hath wrought out, and so <HI>brought in,</HI> for those, in whose room He became a <HI>Surety.</HI></P>
<P>You are to Remember, That the <HI>Foundation,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="000923_0040_0FACA335F3E48008"/>
upon which our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>brings in</HI> a <HI>Righteousness</HI> for His Chosen People, is the Eternal <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> made between God and Him. Albeit some with Impiety e∣nough, put the Name of <HI>A Fiction,</HI> on that Eternal <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> which God the Father made with our <HI>Lord Messiah</HI>; yet we cannot read the <HI>Eighty Ninth</HI> Psalm, or the <HI>Forty Ninth</HI> and <HI>Fifty Third</HI> Chapters of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> or a considerable part of the New Testament, without Believing it. Yea, that <HI>Covenant,</HI> is the <HI>Foundation</HI> of our whole <HI>Salvation,</HI> and most particularly of our Lords Coming to answer the Law of God, for our <HI>Justification</HI> In that Eternal <HI>Covenant,</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ is by God Constituted a <HI>Surety</HI> for us. The Lord-Messiah, is now Expressly called, in Heb. 7.22. <HI>A Surety</HI>: Which is as much as to say, That He came under Obligation, to pay our <HI>Debt</HI> unto God. And tho' this <HI>Name,</HI> is but once in the New Testament, put upon our Saviour, yet the <HI>Thing</HI> thereby intended, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rted the whole Bible over▪ Well; That our Lord, in pursuance of this <HI>Covenant,</HI> might actu∣ally appear in the Quality of our <HI>Surety,</HI> He became a <HI>Man.</HI> His meer becoming a <HI>Man,</HI> or, His <HI>Incarnation</HI> simply Considered, seems therefore no part of the <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which our Lord ha's provided for us. But in short, That <HI>Righteousness is, His perfect Conformity to the Law of God, which in becoming a Man, born of a Woman, He became Subject unto.</HI> Now, there are Two parts of this <HI>Righteousness.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="000923_0041_0FACA336B399F9E8"/>
We owe a <HI>Double Debt</HI> unto the <HI>Law</HI>: A <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> and a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Observation.</HI> As <HI>Criminal</HI> Creatures, we Owe a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Sa∣tisfaction</HI>: as <HI>Rational</HI> Creatures, we Owe a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Observation,</HI> to the <HI>Law</HI> of our God. Both the <HI>Penalty</HI> and the <HI>Precept</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> are alike Requisite now to be complyed withal, for the Honour of that glorious Governour of the world, who gave the Law. Accordingly our Lord Jesus Christ, hath answered the <HI>Law</HI> for us, and in Answering it hath <HI>fulfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led all Righteousness.</HI> Our <HI>Surety</HI> had a most <HI>Holy Heart,</HI> and led a most <HI>Holy Life</HI>▪ The <HI>Exceeding Broad Law</HI> of God, could never tax Him for any thing amiss: And He then endured a most bitter <HI>Death,</HI> even the Substance of that very <HI>Curse,</HI> which was by the <HI>Law</HI> of God, our due for our Sin. Instead of all oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and <HI>Offering,</HI> our Lord Messiah said, in Heb. 10.7. <HI>Lo, I Come to do thy Will, O God.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ, hath Endured the <HI>Paenalty</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> for us. The <HI>Sufferings</HI> of our Lord, made a full <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> for all the wrong done by our Sin to the Law of God We are advi∣sed in 2 Cor. 5.21. <HI>God made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin.</HI> And our Lord Jesus Christ, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h performed the <HI>Praecept</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> for us. The <HI>Actions</HI> of our Lord, have been a compleat <HI>Observation</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and of all that is Forbidden, and all that is Required, in it. We are advised, in Joh 8.29. <HI>He did alwayes the Things that pleased the Father.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> which condemns man to <HI>Dy,</HI> still com∣mands

him to <HI>Do.</HI> Through the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of our Lord, our Sins are pardoned; but through the <HI>Doings</HI> of our Lord, we recover the Heirship of a Kingdom. Indeed meer <HI>Sufferings,</HI> as such, are no obedience. Take the Testi∣mony of <HI>Grotius,</HI> about the Faith of the pri∣mitive Church in this point: <HI>Cum duo nobis pe∣perisse Christum dixerimus, Impunitatem et prae∣mium, illud satisfactioni, hoc merito Christi, distincte tribuit vetus Ecclesia.</HI> According to <HI>Law, Happiness</HI> is due to <HI>Righteousness</HI> Well; we are sure [from Gal. 4 4.] That our Lord Jesus Christ, was <HI>made under</HI> that very <HI>Law,</HI> from the <HI>Curse</HI> whereof we are delivered by His answering of it. And the <HI>Righteousness of the Law,</HI> we are sure [from Rom. 8 4] was <HI>fulfilled, by the Son of God, coming in the likeness of sinful F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ, by His perfect <HI>Righteousness,</HI> may then lay claim to <HI>Happiness.</HI> For whom? Even for those, for whom God has Admitted Him to stand as a <HI>Surety.</HI> God put our Lord under the <HI>Law,</HI> that He might thus furnish us, with a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> in all things answering the <HI>Law</HI>; a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which Fallen man condemned by the <HI>Law,</HI> could by no means furnish himself withal; a <HI>Righteousness</HI> wherein the Honour of the <HI>Law,</HI> and of the God that gave the <HI>Law,</HI> is consulted infinitely.</P>
<P>Secondly.

in Rom. 3.22. <HI>The Righteousness of God, is by the Faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve.</HI> And how comes it so to be: 'Tis by a Gracious <HI>Imputation</HI> of God. The <HI>Phrase,</HI> as well as the <HI>Thing,</HI> is all over <HI>Scriptural</HI>: 'tis de∣rided indeed, and blasphemed, by an <HI>Ʋnrighteous</HI> Generation: but those men do <HI>Err not knowing the Scriptures</HI>; or, which is worse, do Sin against their <HI>Knowledge of the Scriptures.</HI> Is it not ex∣presly written, in Rom. 4 6, 11. <HI>God Imputeth Righteousness unto a man without works:</HI> And, <HI>Righteousness is Imputed unto all that believe</HI>? Now, when we say, The <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is <HI>Imputed</HI> unto us, the mea∣ning of it, is, <HI>That God, our Judge, Looks on it as belonging to us, and pleadable by us, in order to our being Judicially dealt withal, according to the merit of it.</HI> It is an Act of meer Grace, in our most Gracious God, by which He makes unto us, an Effectual Grant, of that <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which our Lord Jesus Christ, in Answering the <HI>Law,</HI> under which He voluntarily put Himself, hath provided for us, A <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which antece∣dently to the <HI>Imputation</HI> was not <HI>ours,</HI> is now so made ours, that for the sake thereof, we are both <HI>Absolved</HI> from the <HI>Curse</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and <HI>Adjudged</HI> unto the <HI>Reward</HI> of the <HI>Heaven∣ly Inheritance.</HI> This <HI>Imputation</HI> proceeds not on a <HI>wrong Judgment,</HI> That our Lord J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus Christ has done what <HI>we</HI> did in our <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and that we have done what <HI>He</HI> did in His <HI>Obedience.</HI> But the <HI>Imputation</HI> makes that be∣come <HI>ours,</HI> which was not so <HI>till,</HI> and which

<P>And it is the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ it self, that is <HI>Imputed.</HI> It is not enough to say, That the <HI>Benefits</HI> of it are Communica∣ted unto us: For that is no <HI>Imputation.</HI> How can there an Imputation of a thing, and the thing it self not Imputed: Either the <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ must be <HI>Imputed</HI> unto us, <HI>Conferred</HI> upon us, <HI>Reckoned</HI> as <HI>ours,</HI> when we are made <HI>Righteous</HI>; or else a <HI>Righte∣ousness</HI> of our own Operation: But God knows we have <HI>None</HI> of our own. The Oracles of God have therefore told us, that herein, <HI>We re∣ceive the Gift of Righteousness thro' Jesus Christ.</HI> And by this <HI>Gift</HI> of God, the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, becomes as really our <HI>Propriety,</HI> as if we our selves in our own persons had wrought it. The Right of <HI>Inheritance,</HI> the Lawyers tell us, is the best <HI>Right,</HI> that any can have; when God has made over to us the <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, it is as much ours, as if we came to it, by the Right of <HI>Inheri∣tance.</HI> Hence we read, in Heb. 11 7 Of <HI>an Heir of the Righteousness by Faith.</HI> But by the Gracious <HI>Imputation</HI> of God, the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ being made <HI>ours,</HI> we now stand <HI>Righteous</HI> before God: And as we read, in Rom. 5 19 <HI>By the Obedience of One, many are made Righteous.</HI> In that <HI>Righteousness,</HI> we stand before that <HI>Righteous</HI> God, who <HI>Loves

<P>There is therefore a Transcendent <HI>Excellency</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<P>The <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ is <HI>Apprehended</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> in order to our be∣ing made <HI>Righteous</HI> by it.</P>
<P>Such a Grace as <HI>Faith,</HI> is produced in the Heart of every <HI>Elect</HI> person, when God <HI>Ef∣fectually Calls</HI> that person home unto Himself.

<P>There are these <HI>Conclusions,</HI> that now call for an Acknowledgment.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="000923_0049_0FACA33CAD648B60"/>First, Meer <HI>Natural Reason,</HI> without <HI>Re∣velation,</HI> both External, and Internal <HI>Re∣velation,</HI> would never <HI>understand</HI> the <HI>Mystery</HI> of a Sinners being made <HI>Righteous,</HI> by the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. For the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> wonderfully to become the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of a <HI>Sinner</HI>; It is most <HI>Rea∣sonably</HI> called, <HI>The Wisdom of God, in a Mystery</HI>; and, <HI>The Mystery, which hath been Hid in God.</HI> It is unto Humane <HI>Reason</HI> Incomprehensible. The <HI>Reason</HI> of <HI>Angels</HI> does Admire it, and Adore it, That <HI>God should be Manifest in Flesh,</HI> to bring it about, for <HI>Sinful Flesh</HI> to be <HI>Justi∣fied</HI> before God. Much more then it is above the <HI>Reason</HI> of silly, shallow, sinful <HI>Mortals!</HI> If a man come to <HI>understand</HI> any thing of this <HI>Mystery,</HI> it may be said unto him, as in Matth. 16.27. <HI>Flesh and Blood hath not Revealed it unto thee.</HI> We are beholden to a <HI>Revelation</HI> from Heaven, for all that we know, of the way to become <HI>Righteous.</HI> 'Tis an Impious Thing, to imagine, That without the <HI>Gospel,</HI> a man may Learn how to be <HI>Righteous.</HI> No, <HI>If our Gospel be Hid, it is Hid unto them that are Lost.</HI> Poor man in his Fall, cast himself into such a desperate and complicate Wretchedness, that nothing <HI>Ʋnderstood</HI> by man could Rescue him: He must Eternally perish, if the <HI>Infinite Ʋnderstanding</HI> of God alone, did not put forth it self to Rescue him.</P>

But <HI>Reason</HI> alone, won't perswade a man of this Thing, That God can find in his Heart, for to Save a Sinner on the Account of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of His <HI>Righteousness</HI> alone.

But these men have sad cause to <HI>Search</HI> their own Hearts over again, <HI>Whether they have ever done it themselves?</HI> I re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>member, I have Read of a carnal man, who having a Friend in <HI>Despair,</HI> flouted at it, saying▪

When a Sinner comes to be Enlightned and Affrightned, and in horror of Soul for all his horrible Sins, it can't enter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to his Heart now, that God should be free to Forgive him, and Relieve him, <HI>only</HI> for the sake of what <HI>Another</HI> ha's done for him. Such an Astonishing Mercy of God, cannot be con∣ceived by a Distressed Sinner; and he will not be pacified without some <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Wor∣thiness</HI> of his own, to Commend him unto God. Hence tis said, in 1 Cor. 1.18. <HI>The Preaching of the Cross, is to them that Perish, Foolishness.</HI> A Sinner will count it <HI>Foolishness,</HI> for a man to venture himself wholly upon the <HI>Righteousness,</HI> of one who dyed upon a <HI>Cross,</HI> and who made a <HI>Righteousness</HI> for us by doing so. Tis the Al∣mighty <HI>Spirit</HI> of God alone, who can do that Thing in Joh. 16.10. <HI>Convince the World of Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Convince</HI> a man that the <HI>Righ∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>usness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ will be suffici∣ent for him.</P>
<P>Secondly, A Sinners <HI>Prejudice</HI> against being made <HI>Righteous,</HI> by the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sus Christ, will never be removed, until <HI>Faith</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> infused into his mind, by an <HI>Operation of God.</HI>

any Act of ours, but we are not actually In∣vested with a <HI>Power</HI> to claim the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ for us, until with the <HI>Heart man Believe unto Righteousness.</HI> We are told, in Rom. 4 24 <HI>It shall be Imputed, if we Believe.</HI> This is the Everlasting language of that <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> our Bible. And we are all over the <HI>Gospel</HI> taught that thing, in Rom. 5.1. <HI>Being Justified by Faith.</HI> Indeed he that weighs, what are the properties of a <HI>Condition,</HI> in the sense of the <HI>Civil Law,</HI> will easily decline saying, <HI>That Faith is the proper Condition of our Justification.</HI> However, in the sense that it is commonly taken, Even <HI>That</HI> also is to be Asserted. But it will suffice, if we say, <HI>That Faith is the Instrument of our Justification.</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> we Accept and Apply the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, for our <HI>Justification</HI> before God: And God will not permit us to be called, <HI>Righteous,</HI> until the <HI>Faith</HI> to do This, be given us <HI>Faith</HI> does not <HI>Justify</HI> us, as it is a <HI>Work</HI>; No, 'Tis <HI>Instrumentally,</HI> and <HI>Relatively,</HI> and because it carries us unto the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ alone, for our <HI>Justification.</HI> By <HI>Faith,</HI> according to the Ordination of God, our <HI>Ʋnion</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ, is accomplished. In that <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ and Believers coalesce into one <HI>Mystical Person</HI>; The Holy <HI>Spi∣rit</HI> in that Glorious <HI>Head</HI> above measure, does inhabit Believers in a measure, and produce between them the <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> that is between the <HI>Head</HI> and the <HI>Members.</HI> In this <HI>Ʋnion</HI> is
<PB N="24" REF="000923_0056_0FACA3ADEC8581B8"/>
founded the <HI>Imputation</HI> by which, <HI>He that knew no Sin, having been made Sin for us, we are made the Righteousness of God in Him.</HI> Accordingly, Our Lord Jesus Christ, with a wonderful prevention of His Holy Spirit first layes Hold on us, to make us <HI>Prize</HI> Him, and <HI>Choose</HI> Him, and <HI>Trust</HI> in Him for His <HI>Righteousness.</HI> And then we by <HI>Faith</HI> lay Hold on Him, crying, <HI>In this Lord let me have Righteousness!</HI> And now the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, with His <HI>Righteousness</HI> is made over unto us forever.</P>
<P>'Tis true; We sometimes read, <HI>That Faith is Imputed for,</HI> [or, To] <HI>Righteousness.</HI> 'Tis not unlikely that one Thing intended in it, may be This; That though <HI>Faith</HI> be the <HI>Gift</HI> of God unto us, yet God <HI>Reckons</HI> this <HI>Faith</HI> our <HI>own</HI>; for except the <HI>Faith</HI> be <HI>Reckoned</HI> our <HI>own,</HI> how should it be subservient at all, to bring unto us the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ. But the main thing in∣tended is, That the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ apprehended by <HI>Faith</HI> is <HI>Reckoned,</HI> for our <HI>Righteousness: Faith</HI> is here put for the <HI>Object</HI> of it. There is nothing more usual, than to speak that of the <HI>Instrument,</HI> which is meant of the <HI>Object,</HI> that is by that <HI>Instrument</HI> applied unto. Doth any man Scruple to say, <HI>The Hand feeds the Body</HI>? why so? Because the <HI>Hand</HI> is that which takes the <HI>Meat,</HI> that <HI>Feeds</HI> the <HI>Body. Faith Justifies</HI> a man, even as <HI>the Hand Feeds the Body.</HI> Our <HI>Faith</HI> is not the very Thing, that God <HI>Reckons</HI> to be our <HI>Righte∣eousness</HI>!
<PB N="25" REF="000923_0057_0FACA3AEAC0BC990"/>
For, our <HI>Faith</HI> is <HI>our own</HI>; but the <HI>Righteousness,</HI> whereby God is rendred pro∣pitious to us, is <HI>not our own.</HI> Our <HI>Faith</HI> at best is not <HI>Perfect</HI>; but it is an affront unto Heaven, to dream of standing before it, in any but a <HI>Perfect Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Now, as the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> is <HI>Ordered in all things,</HI> there is an <HI>Order</HI> of things here fixed by God. If we are <HI>Justified by Faith,</HI> sure we are not Justified <HI>Before</HI> it, or, <HI>Without</HI> it. There is this <HI>Orderly Connexion,</HI> in the <HI>Golden Chain of Salvation.</HI> Rom. 8.30. First <HI>Called,</HI> [and <HI>Faith</HI> given to us,] and then <HI>Justified.</HI> We are no more <HI>Justified from Eternity,</HI> than <HI>Sanctified from Eternity,</HI> and, <HI>Glorified from Eternity.</HI> To speak of being <HI>Justified from Eternity,</HI> is to say, That we never were in any <HI>state of Sin</HI> at all. While a man is an <HI>Ʋnbeliever,</HI> how is it with him? We are told, in Joh. 3 36. <HI>The Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> That <HI>Wrath</HI> abides not on the <HI>Justified. Believers</HI> once were, 'tis said in Eph. 2.3. <HI>The Children of Wrath.</HI> When was this, but before they were <HI>Justifyed.</HI> Every <HI>Justifyed man</HI> does most certainly <HI>please God.</HI> Yea, but we find in Heb 11.6. <HI>Without Faith it is Impossible to please God.</HI> Which is as much as to say, <HI>Without Faith tis Impossible to be a Justifyed man.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, and Lastly. Upon <HI>Faith</HI> Appre∣hending the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus
<PB N="26" REF="000923_0058_0FACA3AF66B91DD0"/>
Christ, the Sinner is in that Instant by the God of Heaven pronounced <HI>Righteous.</HI> If it be now Enquired, How and where the <HI>Sinner</HI> is upon his <HI>Faith</HI> pronounced <HI>Righteous?</HI> We may thus conceive of it.</P>
<P>First, the state of the Believing Sinner, is <HI>Changed</HI> from <HI>Guilty,</HI> to <HI>Righteous,</HI> before the Eye of the <HI>Ʋnchangeable</HI> God. There was a Transaction between▪ God the Father, and our Lord-Messiah, from all Eternity, wherein it was Engaged, That such and such <HI>Elect Sinners,</HI> com∣ing to <HI>Believe,</HI> should ever after that be dealt withal as <HI>Righteous</HI> before the Throne of Hea∣ven▪ When the Ever-blessed <HI>Spirit</HI> brings a Sinner to Believe, though now there be no <HI>Change</HI> in the Almighty, yet the Almighty now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees a <HI>Change</HI> in the Sinner. Every person in the Adorable Trinity, now takes Notice, of a <HI>Sin∣ner</HI> becoming a <HI>New Creature</HI>; and this is more than if all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth took Notice of it. But then, in the Next place, the <HI>Word</HI> of God, even the Written and Sacred <HI>Word,</HI> puts upon a <HI>Believing Sinner,</HI> the cha∣racter of a <HI>Righteous Believer.</HI> In this <HI>Word</HI> of God, is the <HI>Justification<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Office.</HI> The <HI>Voice</HI> of God, is in the <HI>Word</HI> of God. This <HI>Word</HI> pro∣nounces a <HI>Believing</HI> Soul, to be a <HI>Righteous</HI> one. The <HI>Promises</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> are Exhibited in this <HI>Word</HI>; and the Language thereof is, <HI>The Lord Jesus Christ, hath purchased a Right unto all these very great and precious Promises; They are all a Recompence due to the Obedience of the Lord Jesus
<PB N="27" REF="000923_0059_0FACA3B026C6D970"/>
Christ, and now, they are all thine, O Believer, upon His Account they are all thine forever.</HI></P>
<P>And, in fine; It seems not <HI>Ʋnscriptural,</HI> That the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Returning Penitent, is pronounced and proclamed, unto the <HI>Angels</HI> of God. Upon the <HI>Repentance</HI> of a Sinner, we are sure, from Luk. 15.10. <HI>There is Joy among the Angels.</HI> Tis thus then, upon the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of a Sinner; They go together. Why may we not judge, That upon a Sinners being brought unto the <HI>Obedience of Faith,</HI> God the <HI>Judge of all</HI> then calls upon His Angels: <HI>q d.</HI>
<Q>Let all the Court of Heaven, and all you Ministers and Attendents of this Heavenly Court, Look upon such a Sinner, as <HI>Righteous</HI> ever after This He has <HI>Believed</HI> upon my Christ, and I have Bestowed the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of my Christ upon him forever!</Q></P>
<P>THE Second part of our Discourse, must be to <HI>Apply</HI> the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which hath been thus <HI>Explained.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be deplored, even with Tears of Blood, that the most of men, yea, of those men, who sit under the Gospel, which <HI>Re∣veals the Righteousness of God from Faith to Faith,</HI> do miserably fall short of this <HI>Righteousness.</HI> But <HI>How,</HI> but <HI>Why,</HI> do they fall short of it? We have a full Account given of it, in Rom. 10.3. <HI>Going about to Establish their own Righte∣ousness, they have not submitted unto the Righte∣ousness
<PB N="28" REF="000923_0060_0FACA3B0E46185B8"/>
of God.</HI> Wherefore it is as <HI>needful,</HI> as <HI>natural,</HI> an <HI>Exhortation,</HI> that is now to be given you.</P>
<P>Beware, O our <HI>Evangelised</HI> People, Beware, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st by Endeavouring to <HI>Establish your own Righteousness,</HI> you loose the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> which hath been <HI>Revealed</HI> in the <HI>Gospel.</HI> Beware, lest you loose the <HI>Everlasting Righteous∣ness,</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ, hath brought in for His Chosen people, and with that <HI>Righ∣teousness, Everlasting Happiness.</HI></P>
<P>You are frequently and constantly Warned of it, That the <HI>End</HI> of all Ungodly men, will be <HI>Destruction.</HI> But it is, of infinite Con∣sequence, that you take a further Warning from God; Even This, That <HI>Self Righteous</HI> men are <HI>Ʋngod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> men. Souls, Beware lest you fall into a Lamentable Snare; Be able to say, <HI>Destruction from God is a Terror to me.</HI> We are Jealous, Lest when you are Awakened by the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God unto some sense of your own <HI>Sinfulness,</HI> the <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> lay you asleep again, by your own <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and Smite into your Temples the deadly Nails that shall fasten you down to the floor of the Eternal Prison.

<P>And give Attention, to a few Necessary <HI>Ad∣monitions.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="admonition">
<HEAD><HI>Admonition</HI> I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Many, Many,</HI> and some of them very <HI>Curious,</HI> are the ways wherein the <HI>Deceived Souls</HI> of men, go to <HI>Establish their own Righteousness.</HI> In that Soul-undoing Vanity, whereby men go to <HI>Esta∣blish their own Righteousness,</HI> there is a <HI>Mystery of Iniquity. Original Sin,</HI> which is <HI>Deceitful above all Things,</HI> indeed spins a fine thred in this <HI>Myste∣ry.</HI> A world of caution is necessary to preserve a man, from this <HI>path of the Destroyer,</HI> 'tis a path
<PB N="31" REF="000923_0063_0FACA3B32DD640C0"/>
so fine, so fair, so clean! and yet it leads a man down to the <HI>Chambers of Death.</HI></P>
<P>We all have occasion for this <HI>Admonition</HI>▪ but none have more occasion for it, than those who under the Influence of a Good Education, have been visibly <HI>Blameless,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Pious,</HI> from their <HI>Early Childhood</HI>: The <HI>Young man</HI> that could say, <HI>I have kept all the Commandments from my Youth,</HI> was one that yet <HI>Lacked this One Thing</HI>; A <HI>Faith</HI> in the Obedience of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> as his only <HI>Righteousness,</HI> after all. It may be there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those among us, that have Lived free from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y known <HI>Scandal</HI> all their dayes: They have <HI>known the Holy Scriptures from their Childhood,</HI> and worshipped God, and Honoured their Pa∣rents, and abhorred every thing that look'd vici∣ous, and been full of concern about their Salvati∣on, ever since they can remember. <HI>You,</HI> O Souls in Peril, <HI>You</HI> above any under Heaven, have cause to beware, lest by a Reliance on some <HI>Righteousness</HI> of your own, you fall short of Heaven at the last. O follow the Pattern of the Excellent Psalmist, who could say, Psal. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.5, 10. <HI>O Lord God, Thou art my Trust from my youth</HI>: And yet, <HI>I will make mention of thy Righ∣teousness, even of thine only.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, <HI>What we say unto you, we say unto all</HI>; Be Jealous of a <HI>Self-righteous</HI> Dispositi∣on, submit therefore to some <HI>Examination.</HI></P>
<P>First; It may be, you are prone to think,
<PB N="32" REF="000923_0064_0FACA3B46CB02B98"/>
that you are in less danger of <HI>Establishing your own Righteousness,</HI> than of any other <HI>Mistake</HI> or <HI>Mischief</HI> whatsoever. I sometimes hear Unexpe∣rienced Christians, thus express themselves; <HI>Me∣thinks to Establish my own Righteousness is the least of all my Temptations; Methinks, I see so much amiss in my self, that I find my self scarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tempted in any Degree, to dream of being Justifyed by my own Righteousness.</HI> Indeed! Saist thou so? <HI>Man,</HI> There is more cause to be Fearful of <HI>Thee,</HI> than of any man, in all the Assembly. That man, who is not aware of his Danger, to Trust in his own <HI>Righteousness,</HI> is very much in Danger of it. As it was said of some, in Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou saiest, I have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable</HI>; So it may be said of some, <HI>Thou saiest, that thou knowest thy self to be wretched and miserable, while thou art yet vainly conceited, that thou hast need of nothing.</HI> There is an innate <HI>propensity</HI> in every man to seek a <HI>Justification</HI> by his own <HI>Righteousness</HI>; This <HI>Foolishness</HI> will not leave a man, till a terrible <HI>Correction</HI> from God, force him unto it; A man must be drag'd through the Flames of Hell, by the <HI>Terrors</HI> of God, before he come to a <HI>Right mind</HI> about it. A man that is not aware of this <HI>propensity,</HI> it may be fear'd, is yet under the Dominion of it. He'l <HI>Dy</HI>; and his <HI>Epitaph</HI> must be that of his <HI>Brother-Idolater,</HI> in Isa. 44.20▪ <HI>A Deceived Heart hath Turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his own Soul; nor say, Is there not a Lye in my Right-Hand?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="000923_0065_0FACA3B4ABE32350"/>If this discover no <HI>Self-Righteous</HI> Persons, I have another Question for it.</P>
<P>Secondly. Don't you utterly <HI>Despair</HI> of any <HI>Compassion</HI> from God, meerly because you have no <HI>Righteousness</HI> of your own? All <HI>Despairing</HI> Sinners, what are they, but <HI>Self-Righteous</HI> wret∣ches: There are none, who more go to <HI>Esta∣blish their own Righteousness,</HI> than some that are least apprehensive of their doing so: And such are they, who <HI>Despair</HI> of Gods being <HI>Merciful</HI> to them▪ only because they are not. <HI>Righteous</HI> in themselves. A Sinner seeing he ha's no <HI>Righteousness</HI> of his own, falls into utter <HI>Despair, 'Tis impossible</HI> (saies he) <HI>that He who made me, should have any Mercy on me, or that He who formed me, should show me any Favour.</HI> Tell such a Sinner, That he is all this while, built upon his own <HI>Righteousness,</HI> he won't Easily Imagine it. But it is easy to Demonstrate it. The Sinner does frowardly thrust away all the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God; he concludes, 'tis im∣possible the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God ever should reach to such a Sinner. But why not? Sinful Soul; what is the Bottom of thy <HI>Despair</HI>? Truly, 'Tis all b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause thou dost not, and thou <HI>durst</HI> not, lay Hold on the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus Christ. Thou can'st not <HI>Believe</HI>▪ That the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, is enough to D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fend thee▪ from the <HI>Revenges</HI> of Heaven. Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il thou can'st see some <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> in thy s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf, thou can'st not <HI>Believe</HI> it possi∣ble, that ever God will do thee Good. Who
<PB N="34" REF="000923_0066_0FACA3B566669100"/>
are Invited unto the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God? We read in Matth. 9.13. <HI>I call Sinners.</HI> We read in Isa. 55.1. <HI>Ho Every one that Thirsteth, Come without Money.</HI> But some dare not come unto this <HI>Mercy</HI>: Why? Because they are all over <HI>Sinners,</HI> and because they have no <HI>Money,</HI> or Merit of their own, to <HI>Buy</HI> it for them. What is all this, O thou Unhumbled Sinner, but a lothness to Trust any <HI>Righteousness,</HI> but thy own for thy <HI>Justification</HI>?</P>
<P>If this also discover no <HI>Self Righteous</HI> persons, let a Third Question be seriously thought upon.</P>
<P>Thirdly. I pray, Deal Impartially; Do none of you fall in <HI>Love,</HI> with your selves, and with what you have done, in your own <HI>Righteous∣ness?</HI> Those persons go to <HI>Establish their own Righteousness,</HI> who are Taken with any Thing, that they themselves have done, or set it so <HI>High,</HI> as to give or ask <HI>Applause,</HI> unto it. Saies the Apostle, in Phil▪ 3.8, 9 <HI>I Count all but Loss and Dung, that</HI> I <HI>may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own Righteousness.</HI> Man, if thou dost not count <HI>Loss,</HI> and, <HI>Dung,</HI> to be a <HI>Name Good</HI> Enough for the <HI>best Thing</HI> that ever thou did'st, thou art in <HI>thy own Righte∣ousness</HI> to this day.

Said the <HI>Pharisee</HI> in Luk▪ 18.12. <HI>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other Men are, I Fast, and I give Tithes</HI>: How the <HI>Self-Righteous Pharisee</HI> is taken with

it! Perhaps, you can call to mind, <HI>I have Pray'd with such Frequency, I have Heard with such Affecti∣on I have given Alms with such Liberality; And I have done such and such a Piece of Service in my Generation.</HI> Don't you now set an <HI>High</HI> Ac∣count upon what you have done? Even so <HI>High,</HI> as to fall into some <HI>Discontent,</HI> when God seems to take no Notice of what you have done. If God visit you with <HI>Crosses,</HI> and <HI>Sorrows,</HI> and Refuse to <HI>Comfort</HI> you, after all that you have done to pacify Him, are not your Souls distur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed within you, as if you were hardly dealt withal? You bring your <HI>Offerings</HI> to God, but God Hides His <HI>Countenance,</HI> and gives you no <HI>Comforts</HI> to Require your <HI>Offerings</HI>: Are not you now very wroth, and with a wrathful <HI>Countenance</HI> are you not ready to Resolve, That you will not <HI>any longer wait upon Him</HI>? Truly They were a sort of People, seeking <HI>Justification</HI> by their own <HI>Righteousness</HI>; of whom 'tis Reported, in Isa. 58.2, 3 <HI>They are as a Nation, that did Righteousness; wherefore have we Fasted, say they, and thou seest it not</HI>?</P>
<P>Are no <HI>Self Righteous</HI> Persons, yet Convicted? Let a Fourth Question then do its part upon us.</P>
<P>Fourthly. Deal Sincerely; Is it not meerly some little piece of your own <HI>Righteousness,</HI> that serves to quiet your Minds, when your own <HI>Guiltiness</HI> does astonish you?

The Thoughts of a Sinner usually run in that Channel; <HI>As I have Provok'd God by Sinning, so will I now Appease Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Mending.</HI> The Rowsed <HI>Conscience</HI> of a Sin∣ner, will sometimes Roar upon him, That he hath been a <HI>Rebel</HI> against God, all his dayes, and that the <HI>Damnation</HI> due to him, for his Rebellion, <HI>Slumbereth</HI> not. But then the Sinner throwes his <HI>Conscience</HI> into a <HI>Slumber,</HI> with purposes to be a <HI>New Man,</HI> and lead a <HI>New Life,</HI> and he fancies, that his <HI>Reformation</HI> will quit scores with the Almighty, and make amends for all his for∣mer Disobedience.

thus, when a Sinner falls into <HI>New Acts</HI> of Sin, that set his <HI>Conscience</HI> all on a light Fire, and the Sparkles of the Fiery Indignation of God begin to Pierce and Scald his very Soul within him; He hears the Thunder of the Wrath of God Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing of him, and the Curses of the broken Law, rattling like so many Heated Bullets from the Cannons mouth about him; what is now the next course of the Sinner to shelter him∣self?

<P>And are none of them Detected yet? A Fifth Question then shall fall upon us.</P>
<P>Fifthly. Deal Thoroughly: After what manner is it, that you come unto the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> for <HI>His Righteousness</HI>! A man may <HI>Establish his own Righteousness,</HI> even then when
<PB N="38" REF="000923_0070_0FACA3B870ACEC18"/>
he is going to the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, and seeming to forego his own. Are you not Labouring after some <HI>Goodness</HI> in <HI>Your selves,</HI> to <HI>prepare</HI> you for the Lord Jesus Christ? When the Lord Jesus Christ calls upon you, to Rely upon Him, for His <HI>Righteousness,</HI> don't you Excuse your selves,
<Q>That you are not fit for Him; It will be a presumption in you to come as yet, unto His <HI>Righteousness,</HI> while you are so full of <HI>Sin</HI>; or till your <HI>Sin</HI> be a little better Mortified?</Q>
And now, are you not seeking after more <HI>Sorrow</HI> for Sin, more <HI>Contrition,</HI> and more <HI>Compunction,</HI> and more <HI>Humiliation</HI>; that you may come <HI>Garnished</HI> and <HI>Purified</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ? Hereupon, does this at last <HI>Embolden</HI> you, and <HI>Encourage</HI> you, to come unto the Lord? It may be, you durst not have cast your selves upon the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, if you had not first per∣ceived some <HI>Symptoms</HI> of a <HI>Mended</HI> Heart and Life upon you Is it so? Then, O man, Thou art a <HI>Self-Righteous</HI> man. It was said, in Matth. 11.5. <HI>The Poor are Gospellized.</HI> A man is then <HI>Gospellized,</HI> when his mind is brought by the <HI>Gos∣pel,</HI> unto the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Revealed in the Gospel.</HI> Now a man must come altogether a <HI>Poor man,</HI> unto that <HI>Righteousness.</HI> Without an utter <HI>Poverty of Spi∣rit,</HI> the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, cannot be aright Received.

bring something of <HI>his own</HI> to <HI>Eclipse</HI> the <HI>Grace</HI> of God!</P>

<P>Sixthly, and Lastly; Be it known unto you, That if you Live in your <HI>own Wickedness,</HI> 'tis very certain you Live on your <HI>own Righteousness.</HI> A man must have some <HI>Righteousness,</HI> to pre∣serve the <HI>Peace</HI> of his own Soul. There is no man, but what knows, that <HI>God</HI> is a <HI>Righteous God,</HI> and that none but a <HI>Righteous Man</HI> can be Accepted with <HI>Him</HI> The worst of men will therefore patch up some <HI>Righteousness</HI> or other for themselves; they would not else be able to bear the furious Reflections of their own <HI>Guilty Minds.</HI> Hence you shall see a Silly Creature, that is an horrible <HI>Drunkard,</HI> and <HI>Swearer,</HI> and <HI>Lyer,</HI> and as Wicked a <HI>Debauch</HI> as can be, yet flatter himself with Assurance of <HI>Heaven</HI>; why?

If a man be not thereupon <HI>San∣ctifyed,</HI> it is apparent he was never <HI>Justifyed.</HI> A man who does not press after an <HI>Inherent Righteousness,</HI> that shall sweetly conform to the <HI>Imputed Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, makes it Evid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt that this <HI>Imputed Righteousness</HI> was never bestowed upon him. As when we derive <HI>Guiltines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> from the <HI>First Adam,</HI> we derive <HI>Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uption</HI> also, thus we receive not <HI>Righteousness</HI> from the <HI>Second Adam,</HI> if we don't Receive <HI>Holi∣ness</HI> with it.

It follows now, that whatever man does allow himself in any way of <HI>Wicked∣ness,</HI> this man does go to <HI>Establish his own Righ∣teousness.</HI> Of such a man, we read, in Ezek. 33.13. He <HI>does Trust unto his own Righteousness, and commit Iniquity; all his Righteousness shall not be Remembred, but his Iniquity that he hath committed, he shall Dy for it.</HI> How often may you see the sad Experiment! There is many a man does commit <HI>Iniquity</HI>: Upon his <HI>Iniquity</HI> he falls into a grievous <HI>Consternarion</HI>; To allay his <HI>Consternation,</HI> he betakes himself unto <HI>Religious Duties</HI>: In all his <HI>Duties</HI> he flies not unto the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. This man

will strangely Return to <HI>Commit Iniquity</HI>; And his Return to <HI>Commit Iniquity,</HI> proves that all this while, he hath <HI>Trusted unto his own Righte∣ousness</HI> He is a <HI>Dead Man,</HI> if he continue so to do!

Wherefore, like <HI>Herod,</HI> men will <HI>do many things</HI>: but, alas, while they go to make a <HI>Righteousness,</HI> of these things, they still <HI>fall short of Entring into Rest.</HI></P>
<P>O our Beloved People; may we say it of you, That you are <HI>Striving</HI> to get rid of Sin, <HI>Striving</HI> to have more broken <HI>Hearts,</HI> and <HI>Striv∣ing</HI> to lead more exact <HI>Lives</HI>! We wish, we may say it. But then, we must also say, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Oh!

<P>Be advised;</P>
<P>First, Your own <HI>Righteousness,</HI> is far from coming up to the Demands of God in His Holy Law; and God will not Annul, or Alter that Holy <HI>Law.</HI> It is the voice of Heaven unto us, in Gal. 2.16. <HI>By the works of the Law shall no Flesh be Justified</HI>: And in Rom. 3.20. <HI>By the Deeds of the Law, there shall no Flesh be Justified in the Sight of God.</HI> I have known some to Live in gross <HI>Immoralities</HI>; and yet they would say, Their <HI>Peace</HI> was made with God.

mayst go ten thousand times farther than this, and yet be altogether distitute of <HI>Righteousness</HI> after all. I tell you truly; As 'tis said, Job 20.6, 7. <HI>Though his Excellence mount up to the▪ Hea∣vens, and his Head reach unto the Clouds, yet he shall perish for ever like his own Dung</HI>; Even so, Though you Lived like men in <HI>Heaven</HI> upon Earth, and though you Spoke with the <HI>Tongues of Angels,</HI> and Shed Rivers of <HI>Tears</HI> for your Sins, and pour'd out <HI>Prayers</HI> that should pierce the very Clouds more than Seven Times a day, and give all your <HI>Estates</HI> unto the poor, and your very <HI>Bodies</HI> unto the Fire: yea, though you were Prophets of God, and could <HI>Remove Mountains</HI>; Yet if you go to make any of This, your <HI>Justifying Righteousness,</HI> I earnestly testify unto you. The Holy God will abhor you after all, and at last make you the Abhor∣ring of all Flesh. To speak in the Language of the Prophet, <HI>I will declare thy Righteousness and thy Works, for they shall not profit thee.</HI> Man, Thou art Condemned by the <HI>Law</HI> of God; Thou hast lost thy Ability to keep the <HI>Law</HI>: And if thou were't Able to keep it, would this make amends for thy former Breaches of it? No, would it not. Some indeed speak much, of <HI>Washing away their Sins by the Tears of Re∣pentance</HI>: But it is an unsafe Speech; Mens <HI>Tears</HI> in this point, are but <HI>Sope</HI> and <HI>Nitre,</HI> which however multiplied, will never <HI>wash away their Sins.</HI> Yea, Though thou shouldest ly, like a glowing Iron in the Fires of <HI>Tophet,</HI> for a thou∣sand Million Ages, it would not make a Com∣pensation

<P>Secondly.

Matthew</HI> the <HI>Publican,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> the <HI>Harlot</HI> came in unto the Lord Jesus Christ, when the <HI>Self-Righteous Pharisees</HI> most <HI>Ʋnjustly</HI> Rejected Him. The man that counts his own <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> worth pleading, will never go aright unto the Lord Jesus Christ for His: Of such 'tis said, in Rom. 9.31, 32. <HI>They attained not unto the Law of Righteousness; wherefore? Because they sought it, not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law.</HI> While men have any <HI>Hope</HI> of <HI>Righteousness</HI> by their own doing the <HI>Works of the Law,</HI> they will have no <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Righte∣ousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>Austin</HI> long since Remarked it; That multitudes of the more moral <HI>Heathens,</HI> would not become <HI>Christians,</HI> as being by their own <HI>Vertuous Liv∣ing</HI> already well-provided for: <HI>Nullum Homici∣dium, nullum Furtum, nullam Rapinam facio,</HI> said they; Let any <HI>wickedness</HI> be found in me, <HI>Et qui me reprehenderit, faciet me Christianum</HI>; I shall be forced then to turn a <HI>Christian</HI> imme∣diately.

Art thou willing to appear clothed with none but such Nasty <HI>Plaisters?</HI> There are <HI>Blemishes</HI> enough, in the most Splendid of all our <HI>Duties,</HI> to Defile them, to Deform <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, to render them very Faulty▪ The Holiest of men may say, as indeed some of them have with much Reflecti∣on said, <HI>I never did any Good work in all my Life, but the Lord shew'd me some Sinful circumstance attending of it</HI>▪ Christian, There are <HI>Motes</HI> in thy brightest <HI>Sun-Beams</HI>; there are <HI>Spots</HI> in thy whitest <HI>Garments</HI>; there is a world of <HI>Dross</HI> and <HI>Alloy</HI> among thy finest <HI>Gold:</HI> If thou art a <HI>Christi∣an,</HI> thou art sensible of it. Yea, and when we have with <HI>Tears</HI> bewayled our own Defects, we have cause to Cry out with him, of old, <HI>Lava meas Lacrymas,</HI> Lord, <HI>My Tears themselves want washing</HI>! We read of, <HI>The Iniquity of our Holy Things.</HI> When we have been waiting upon God, in our most <HI>Holy Things,</HI> we may after all say with that <HI>Perfect</HI> and <HI>Ʋpright</HI> man▪ in Job 40 4▪ <HI>Behold, I am Vile</HI>! The <HI>Exceeding Broad Law</HI> of our God; Let us Consider <HI>that,</HI> and all our pretences to <HI>Perfection</HI> in the most glorious Action that ever we did, will all come to an <HI>End</HI> at once. <HI>Luther</HI> speaks of one who had Lived very Holily; which when some Applauded him for; <HI>True,</HI> said he, <HI>In your Eyes: But the Eyes of man are not like the Eyes of God</HI>! That man, who pretends to have answered the the <HI>Law</HI> of God in any <HI>One Action,</HI> is, to speak truly, An <HI>Ignorant</HI> and an <HI>Arrogant</HI> Fool. Man, Single out any <HI>One Action,</HI> even the most Exact, that ever thou didst, and if thou dare

to put thy Everlasting State upon a Decision by the Exactness of <HI>That,</HI> thou art a <HI>Lost</HI> man, against the world; All the Angels in Heaven can't Save thee from <HI>Confusion world without End.</HI> When one told the Dying Arch Bishop of <HI>Mag∣deburgh,</HI> That the Merit of his <HI>Good Works</HI> would procure a place in Heaven for him, he Cry'd out, <HI>Nul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Modo</HI>; O by no means: But the <HI>Good Works of Christ are sufficient for me.</HI> And when <HI>Bellarmine</HI> had been Essaying to maintain <HI>Justification</HI> by our own <HI>Works,</HI> with an Asto∣nished Soul, at last he Cryed out, <HI>After all, the best way is to plead the Mercy of God, thro' Christ alone.</HI> What said the Psalmist, and Ser∣vant of God! In Psal. 142.3. <HI>O Lord, Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant, for in thy sight shall no man Living be Justifyed.</HI> One of the Ancients ha's this Note upon it, <HI>Non dicit, cum Hoste, sed cum Servo.</HI> It is not said, <HI>Enter not into Judgment with a Rebel,</HI> but, <HI>with a Servant.</HI> When we have <HI>Served</HI> God never so Faithfully, and Zelously, none of our <HI>Services</HI> will serve to <HI>Justify</HI> us.</P>
<P>Secondly. Repair now to the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as the only <HI>Refuge,</HI> by God set before you. In the <HI>Gospel,</HI> you have the <HI>Tenders</HI> of the best <HI>Righteousness</HI> made unto you. Make now your <HI>Echo's</HI> to those <HI>Tenders</HI> of the <HI>Gospel.</HI> As when, the Tidings of <HI>Grace,</HI> were brought from Heaven unto <HI>Mary,</HI> Luk. 1.38 <HI>Mary said, Behold the Hand∣maid of the Lord: Be it unto me according to
<PB N="51" REF="000923_0083_0FACA3C225406080"/>
thy Word!</HI> Thus, when we are told of a <HI>Righteousness</HI> wrought out by the Lord Jesus Christ, which we that have none of <HI>our own,</HI> are all call'd upon, to take for <HI>our Own</HI> forever, let our surprized Souls thereupon say, <HI>Behold, a Poor Sinner against the Lord; Be it unto me according to this Marvellous Word.</HI> Souls, Be not stout-hearted, which is to be <HI>far from Righteousness.</HI> The <HI>Avengers</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> are pursuing of us; <HI>Fly,</HI> O Sinner, <HI>Fly</HI> for thy <HI>Life. Whi∣ther shall I Fly</HI>? Saist Thou. The <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, is a <HI>City of Re∣fuge,</HI> that God hath set open for thee: <HI>Fly</HI> in∣to <HI>that,</HI> saying with him, in Phil 3.9. <HI>Let me be found in Christ,</HI> [the Expression seems to allude unto the <HI>City of Refuge,</HI> (if not unto Isa. 61.10.] <HI>not having my own Righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God, by Faith.</HI> It was foretold in Isa. 45.24 <HI>Surely shall one say, In the Lord I have Righteousness.</HI> Oh! That <HI>many</HI> an <HI>One</HI> would now say so; And say, as all Good men use to do, <HI>When I Look on my self, I Sink, I Dy, I Perish; but when I cast an Eye on my Lord Jesus Christ, I am alive again.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed aright in that <HI>Great Action,</HI> of Repairing to the Lord Jesus Christ, for His <HI>Righteousness,</HI> is indeed a Point of no <HI>small Importance.</HI> 'Tis therefore needful, that in the first Place, you Cry to the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> for that <HI>Grace</HI> which will Enable you
<PB N="52" REF="000923_0084_0FACA3C2EAFE7458"/>
to <HI>Believe</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. Be sensible of that Glorious Truth, in Eph 2.8 <HI>By Grace are ye Saved, through Faith; and that not of your selves: it is the Gift of God.</HI> And, then let your cry to Heaven be, <HI>Lord, let thy Grace bestow that Gift of Heaven, a True Faith upon me.</HI> Never did a∣ny man aright <HI>Believe</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ who only in his own <HI>strength</HI> Attempted it Seeing then, That <HI>no man can Come unto the Son of God, Except the Father Draw him,</HI> Let your Eye, and your Cry be to God, with that Petition, <HI>Draw me, O Lord, that I may Run unto thy Righteous∣ness.</HI> But then, 'tis needful, that in the next Place, you <HI>Cry Mightily</HI> to God, for that <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, on which you would now <HI>Believe.</HI> It is an observable Expression, in Isa. 45.25. <HI>In the Lord shall all the Seed of Israel be Justified. Israel</HI> was one, who came to be so called, by <HI>Wrestling</HI> for a <HI>Blessing.</HI> Them that would be <HI>Justified</HI> by the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, God will have to <HI>Wrestle</HI> for it, with Importunate Supplications. With Agonies of Importunity then <HI>Wrestle</HI> with God, <HI>Oh, most Merciful God, I am Justly and Sadly undone, if thou do not grant me the Righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ; whatever thou deny me, Oh, Deny me not that Righteousness. Faith</HI> first breathes, its First Breath is, in <HI>Prayer.</HI> Your <HI>Prayer</HI> for the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, must be the first Essay and Salley of your <HI>Faith</HI> unto it.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="000923_0085_0FACA3C3AAEED458"/>And then finally, <HI>Profess,</HI> Try whether you cannot with a Triumphing Soul <HI>profess,</HI> That you do <HI>Believe</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, alone. God now demands of you, <HI>Whether you do indeed Believe on His Righteousness</HI>? Try, O Try, whether you can't make this Answer to the Demand, in Mar 9 17 <HI>Lord, I believe, Help thou my Ʋnbelief.</HI> Place thy self, O <HI>Sinner,</HI> before the Judgment Seat of that <HI>Holy God,</HI> unto whose Judgment thy Sin hath made thee obnoxious: and let His Infinite <HI>Holiness,</HI> fill thee with Astonish∣ment.

Now having felt this work, Then let thy Reply be, <HI>Lord, I have nothing, nothing at all to plead, but only the Righteousness of my Lord Jesus Christ▪ That Righteousness has an∣swered thy Law in all things Thy Grace hath made me an offer of that Righteousness: In that
<PB N="54" REF="000923_0086_0FACA3C471CF3498"/>
Righteousness therefore I place all my Hope for ever-more.</HI></P>
<P>In fine; We will describe the solemn Trans∣action of a Soul Repairing to the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, from the <HI>Heaven-taught Experience,</HI> of those who have thus left on Re∣cord, the way of their proceeding in it.</P>
<P>Their Spirits being exceedingly distressed, at the view of their own manifold <HI>Vilenesses,</HI> which they bitterly bewayled before the Lord, they have thus at length concluded.</P>
<P><Q>And yet after all this, Lord, By the Help of thy Grace, I <HI>Believe,</HI> that my precious Lord Jesus Christ, our <HI>Immanuel,</HI> hath fully obeyed and suffered thy will, as a <HI>Surety,</HI> in the room of Elect Sinners. I <HI>Believe</HI> that the <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> of this our <HI>Surety,</HI> is tendered unto me for me to <HI>Depend</HI> upon it, that for the sake thereof, I may become Accepted with God. I <HI>Believe</HI> that whenever thou dost enable me to <HI>Depend</HI> upon this <HI>Righteousness,</HI> thou dost immediately Absolve me from all my Guiltiness, and pronounce me a <HI>dear Son,</HI> a <HI>pleasant Child, whom thou wilt surely have mercy upon.</HI> Yea, I <HI>Believe</HI> that the horrible and prodigious Greatness of my Sins, does nothing to render me uncapable of this Great, and Free, and Rich Grace of Heaven. Oh my God, in this <HI>Belief,</HI> I cast my self at the Feet of the Lord Jesus Christ; <HI>There</HI> will I now ly Waiting, Looking, yea,

Assured, There to Receive thy Favours. Now I know, That my <HI>Debts</HI> to the Dreadful Just∣ice of God are all paid. All that my God will now demand of me, is to Love Him, and Praise Him, and Glorifie my Glorious Redee∣mer for ever-more.</Q></P>
<P>Syrs, Upon a Transaction thus managed, there presently issues from the Throne of God, that Order concerning you, that there was about <HI>Jo∣shua</HI> in the Vision, <HI>Take away the filthy Garments from him:</HI> The Almighty declares unto you; <HI>Behold, I have caused thine Iniquity to pass from thee, and I will cloath thee with change of Rai∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>Very far toward such a Transaction, did seem disposed, when he came to Dy, that Great Em∣perour <HI>Charles</HI> V. one of the greatest men that ever lived. He thus, according to the Account of <HI>De Thou,</HI> then Reasoned with himself.</P>
<P><Q>That in himself, he was altogether unworthy to obtain the Kingdom of Heaven, by his own merits; but that his Lord God, the Lord Jesus Christ, who Enjoy'd it on a double Title, by an <HI>Heirship</HI> from His <HI>Father,</HI> and by the <HI>De∣sert</HI> of His <HI>Passion,</HI> was content with the former Himself, and had freely grantest unto Him the latter Title: That accordingly on His Free Grant, he laid claim thereunto, and in the con∣fidence thereof he should not be confounded: for the <HI>Oyl of Mercy</HI> is poured into the <HI>Vessel of

Faith</HI>; and this is the Faith of a man <HI>Despair∣ing</HI> in <HI>himself,</HI> but <HI>Relying</HI> on his <HI>Lord; Alioquin proprijs meritis fidere, non Fidei esse, sed perfidiae.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Lastly; Being thus invested with the <HI>Righte∣ousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, count not your selves Released from the <HI>Good Works</HI> required in the <HI>Law of Righteousness</HI> Grievous Confusion and Vexation, hath arisen in the Church of Christ, by the corrupt minds of men, Abusing the Evangelical Doctrine, of <HI>Justification by Faith in the Righteousness of God.</HI> The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Ʋngodly men, who Turn the Grace of God into wantonness</HI>; and <HI>Libertines,</HI> Who because our Lord Jesus Christ hath answered the <HI>Law</HI> for His people, count themselves at <HI>Liberty</HI> from the <HI>Law</HI> to all intents and purposes. Our <HI>Justifica∣tion by the Righteousness of our lord Jesus Christ,</HI> must be defended in the sound and safe sense of the <HI>Glorious Gospel,</HI> against the Depravations of <HI>Ʋngodly Antinomianism.</HI> We must come to the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>sound▪ in this Faith:</HI> The <HI>Mystery</HI> of our being made <HI>Righteous,</HI> by <HI>God manifest in Flesh,</HI> is a <HI>Mystery of Godliness:</HI> It hath all over a Tendency to <HI>Godliness.</HI> It is very certain; That our having an <HI>Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous,</HI> when we <HI>Sin,</HI> is written to us, that we may not go on to <HI>Sin.</HI> If any man be so vile, as to make this Inference, <HI>'Tis only the Righteous∣ness of the Lord Jesus Christ, by which</HI> I <HI>am to be Justified; and therefore I am at liberty to go on in the way<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Ʋnrighteousness</HI>: Ah, Deceived

Soul, 'Tis plain, that thou art not yet <HI>Justifyed</HI>; Thy <HI>Spot</HI> is not the <HI>Spot</HI> of the <HI>Justifyed</HI>; Such a venemous Inference is Incompatible to a <HI>Justi∣fyed</HI> man: Thou art yet among the <HI>Ʋnrighteous,</HI> that shall not <HI>Inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>First. Remember, I beseech you, That the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> is to be Received by every Christi∣an alive, as the Everlasting <HI>Rule</HI> of his Life. That <HI>Law</HI> which the God of Heaven Epitomiz∣ed in the <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> written by Him∣self on the famous Tables of <HI>Stone</HI>; 'tis a <HI>Law</HI> which all Christians are forever bound unto the Observation of It is a Caution, that our Lord Jesus Christ hath given us, in Matth 5.17. <HI>Think not that I am come to Destroy the Law</HI> And accordingly, both our Lord Jesus Christ, and His Apostles, often direct us unto the <HI>Law,</HI> as obliging us, to <HI>Love the Lord our God,</HI> and <HI>Love our Neighbours.</HI> When <HI>Moses</HI> went up to Receive the <HI>Two Tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> on which the <HI>Decalogue</HI> was written, he was attended with <HI>Joshua,</HI> when he Received the other Precepts, he was attended with <HI>Aaron</HI> and his Sons Might not this im∣port, That the <HI>Decalogue</HI> was to be observed under the Gospel, in the Times of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as well as of <HI>Moses</HI>: The other Precep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> during the Priest-hood of <HI>Aaron</HI>? It is well Expressed by <HI>Tertullian, Libertas in Christo non f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cit Inno∣centiae Injuriam, manet Lex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ota Piètatis.</HI> 'Tis not possible, That men should be se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> free from

their Obligations to <HI>Glorify God.</HI> The ways in which we are to <HI>Glorify God</HI> are prescribed in the <HI>Moral Law.</HI> To Abolish this <HI>Law,</HI> would be to say, That men shall cease to be a <HI>Creature,</HI> and owe nothing to his <HI>Creator.</HI> Indeed, we have a <HI>Compleat Righteousness</HI> in our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath <HI>Answered the Law</HI> for us. Yea, but for all This, in whatever we come short of <HI>An∣swering the Law</HI> our selves, we must <HI>Mourn</HI> for it as a <HI>Sin,</HI> and Loath and Judge our selves for it. Although we are, <HI>In Christ free from Condemnation,</HI> Yet upon our falling short of doing what is Enjoyned in the <HI>Law,</HI> we must <HI>Condemn</HI> our selves, and Exclaim, <HI>O wretched man that I am!</HI> 'Tis true, the <HI>Law</HI> is, by the Accession of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> brought into some <HI>New Circumstances</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI>; but still, that <HI>Law</HI> is a <HI>Rule of Life</HI> unto us, and it will be in Force, till the very Heavens be no more. Is it not the Definition of <HI>Sin,</HI> in 1 Joh. 3.4. <HI>Sin is the Transgression of the Law.</HI> If we have no <HI>Law,</HI> we could have no <HI>Sin.</HI> But they that are <HI>Justi∣fyed</HI> by the <HI>Righteousness of God,</HI> yet, alas, do fall into <HI>Sin</HI> every day: <HI>If we say, we have no Sin, the Truth is not in us</HI>: And a <HI>Sin</HI> is not at all the less a <HI>Sin,</HI> but it is rather an aggra∣vated <HI>Sin,</HI> for being done by One whom the Lord Jesus Christ hath <HI>Justified from Sin.</HI> When <HI>the Lord hath shewed thee, O man, what is the Good Thing,</HI> even His <HI>Messiah,</HI> and His <HI>Righ∣teousness,</HI> He then Requires thee to <HI>Glorify</HI>▪ His <HI>Messiah,</HI> by <HI>Doing Justly,</HI> by <HI>Loving Mercy,</HI> by <HI>Walking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbly with thy God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="000923_0091_0FACA3C8E65435C8"/>Secondly. Our <HI>Good Works,</HI> or Sincere Essayes, to observe the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> are necessary to <HI>Justify</HI> that <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness of God,</HI> by which our persons are <HI>Justified.</HI> Every <HI>Jewel</HI> ha's a <HI>Counterfeit.</HI> And, <HI>How shall we know that our Faith in the Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ for our Justification, is not a Counterfeit?</HI> Now the <HI>Marks</HI> of a <HI>Justifying Faith</HI> are the <HI>Works,</HI> whereto a Believer is thereby disposed. Sayes the Apostle, in Jam 2 20 <HI>Wilt thou know, O Vain man, that Faith without Works is Dead?</HI> Christians, a <HI>Workless Faith</HI> is a <HI>Worthless Faith</HI>▪ It is an Incautelous and a Dangerous passage, that I have Read; <HI>Men are too apt to think their Peace depends on the subduing of Sin. If their Sins be subdued, then they may have Peace, and if they cannot be subdued, then no Peace; Let subduing of Sin a∣lone for Peace.</HI> But, <HI>wilt thou know,</HI> O Vain <HI>An∣tinomian</HI>? If thy <HI>Faith</HI> do not <HI>subdue</HI> thy Sin, it is a <HI>False Faith</HI>; And, if a man go to Bless himself, saying, <HI>I shall have Peace,</HI> though <HI>Sin</HI> re∣main <HI>unsubdued</HI> in him, <HI>There is no Peace, saith my God,</HI> unto that <HI>Wicked</HI> man. We are to Try our <HI>Justifying Faith,</HI> by This; <HI>Is our Sin subdued by this Faith?</HI> And, <HI>through Faith are we alwayes abounding in the works of the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>It will be of great use, to have this a little more clearly stated. Mind it then;</P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> teaches us. That no man is <HI>Justif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by works,</HI> but a man is <HI>Justified only
<PB N="60" REF="000923_0092_0FACA3C9AD40B398"/>
by Faith.</HI> But the Apostle <HI>James</HI> teaches us, That a man is <HI>Justifyed by Works,</HI> a man is <HI>not justified by Faith alone.</HI> And yet, however some of the Ancients, as well as <HI>Luther,</HI> stumbled at this <HI>Appearance of Contradiction,</HI> they are far from <HI>Contradicting</HI> one another. <HI>Paul</HI> treats of our <HI>Justification</HI> before <HI>God,</HI> and the Right unto Everlasting Life, thereon granted unto us. This is only by <HI>Faith</HI> in our Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>James</HI> treats of that which may manifest our <HI>Justification</HI> unto <HI>Men</HI> that See and Hear our Profession of our <HI>Faith.</HI> Here <HI>Works</HI> are Signi∣ficant. The <HI>Conscience</HI> of a man may be dis∣tressed with a <HI>Twofold Accusation.</HI> First, A man may be Accused of <HI>Iniquity</HI> It may be said, <HI>Thou hast broken the Law, and wrong'd the God that gave the Law, and the dreadful Curse of that Law, now belongs unto thee.</HI> Our Answer to This Accusation is, <HI>My Lord Jesus Christ hath fully Obey'd the Law of God, and Suffer'd for my Disobedience; and I do by Faith Rely on this Righteousness of my Lord Jesus Christ, for Eternal B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essedness.</HI> But next, A man may be Accused of <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> It may be said, <HI>Thou Talkest of thy Faith, but is it not meer Talk? How canst thou prove, that thy Faith is any more than what is in the very Devils themselves?</HI> The Answer to this Accusation must be, <HI>The Works of a Sanctified man, which I am doing every day, are the proof of my Faith</HI>▪ Accordingly, It is asserted by <HI>Paul</HI>; That a man is <HI>Justifyed alone by Faith</HI>; but it is asserted by <HI>James,</HI> That a man is <HI>not Justified by a Faith which is alone.</HI> The Question
<PB N="61" REF="000923_0093_0FACA3CA656A56B0"/>
discoursed by <HI>Paul</HI> is, <HI>How a Guilty person may come to be Acquitted by the Lord, from all the Guilt that lyes upon him</HI>? The Answer to this Question, is, Not by any <HI>Works</HI> of our own, but only by the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is, on our part, only by <HI>Faith</HI> applyed unto us. The Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stion discoursed by <HI>James,</HI> is, <HI>Whether a man pretending to Faith in the Righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, shall be Saved, though he continue without the Works of an Holy Life agreeable thereunto</HI>? The Answer to this Question, is, <HI>No,</HI> such a man ha's <HI>no Saving Faith</HI> at all. <HI>Wilt thou know, O Vain man</HI>? 'Tis a <HI>Vanity</HI> in any man, to <HI>Profess,</HI> that he hath a <HI>True Faith</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ, if his <HI>Faith</HI> be not <HI>Fruitful</HI> in those <HI>Good Works,</HI> which may <HI>Justify</HI> the mans <HI>Professi∣on.</HI> In short, A True <HI>Faith,</HI> will be a <HI>Divine Principle</HI> in the Soul, inclining and assisting a man, to <HI>Live</HI> unto the Glory of that Lord, who ha's made him <HI>Righteous</HI>▪ And particu∣larly, our <HI>Forgiving</HI> the <HI>Trespasses</HI> of others a∣gainst our selves, is a thing of Great Note, a∣mong those <HI>Good Works,</HI> which are to demon∣strate the <HI>Faith,</HI> and the State of One whose <HI>Trespasses</HI> against <HI>God,</HI> are <HI>Forgiven,</HI> through <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. Soul, If thou canst not <HI>Forgive,</HI> it is a sad sign upon thee, Thou never wast <HI>For∣given.</HI> It was well said therefore by <HI>John Hus, Ʋbi bona opera non-apparent ad Extra, ibi Fides non est ad intra: Faith</HI> is not <HI>within,</HI> if <HI>Good Works</HI> are not <HI>without.</HI> A <HI>Vain Faith</HI> it is, that
<PB N="62" REF="000923_0094_0FACA3CB24ED1C18"/>
becomes not <HI>Visible,</HI> and <HI>Incarnate,</HI> by <HI>Good Works</HI> upon it.</P>
<P>Thirdly. A <HI>Justifying Faith</HI> cannot but from the very <HI>Nature</HI> of it, have a <HI>Sanctifying Force,</HI> upon the Heart of the <HI>Believer.</HI> For, the same <HI>Faith,</HI> which Embraces the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <HI>Priest</HI> for <HI>Atonement,</HI> (and <HI>As</HI> doing this, it Justifies!) embraces Him also as a <HI>King</HI> for <HI>Go∣vernment. Faith</HI> ha's <HI>other Designs</HI> besides that of <HI>Justification,</HI> for which it is equally concern∣ed.

The <HI>Holy</HI> Employments, and the <HI>Holy</HI> Enjoyments of the Heavenly World, would be for ever distastful unto us, if we should not carry <HI>Holy Hearts</HI> into that World. Ex∣cept God here, <HI>Work us for that Self-Same Thing,</HI> every <HI>Thing</HI> in Heaven will be disagree∣able unto us. The <HI>Ʋnclean</HI> may not enter into the Temple of God.

<P>Fifthly; and, Lastly: It must not be <HI>For∣gotten,</HI> and I wish it were more clearly <HI>Ʋn∣derstood,</HI> That even <HI>Justifyed</HI> Persons, if they do not <HI>Walk with God,</HI> and <HI>Walk very Circum∣spectly,</HI> may Expose themselves, to the Father∣ly, and the Terrible <HI>Displeasure</HI> of God.

<P>I pray your Attention.</P>
<P>You are to know, That upon <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, a Sinner is <HI>Perfectly Justifyed.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> of God, no more binds him over, to suffer the <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Curse</HI> of God, which is Threatned in the <HI>Law.</HI> The <HI>Curse</HI> of God, no more can take hold upon him; and he ha's a <HI>Formal Pardon</HI> of all his <HI>Former Sins,</HI> with a <HI>Vertual Pardon</HI> of all his <HI>Future Sins.</HI> The <HI>Act</HI> of God, as a <HI>Judge,</HI> in thus <HI>Justifying</HI> of a Believing Sinner, Admits of no <HI>Repetition,</HI> and
<PB N="68" REF="000923_0100_0FAD3CE4CE5C21D8"/>
no <HI>Intercision.</HI> Let a Sinner be <HI>once Justified,</HI> and Absolved from the Sentence of the <HI>Law</HI> upon him, he is then <HI>wholly</HI> so, and <HI>ever</HI> so.</P>
<P>But for all this, Let it not seem Strange unto you, if I tell you, That there is what we may call, a <HI>Filial Guilt,</HI> wherein a <HI>Justifyed</HI> Person may become obnoxious to the <HI>Fatherly Wrath</HI> of God. It is an unsound Position in certain Sermons too much cryed up, among Injudicious Readers; <HI>Though a Believer, after he be a Believer, do Sin often, yet God no longer Stands Offended and Displeased with him.</HI></P>
<P>You may thus Conceive of it.</P>
<P>The God of Heaven ha's in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> Required us to <HI>Adorn the Doctrine of God our Sa∣viour,</HI> by Endeavouring utmost <HI>Obedience</HI> to that <HI>Law,</HI> which our <HI>Saviour</HI> hath answered for us. And He ha's Threatned our <HI>Grosser Neglects</HI> of that <HI>Obedience,</HI> not with <HI>Eternal Confusion,</HI> as He did in the <HI>Law</HI>; but with <HI>Paternal Correction.</HI> The <HI>Paternal Correction</HI> whereto our <HI>Scandalous Faults,</HI> will now Ex∣pose us, lies in a Variety and Severity of <HI>Divine Judgments,</HI> to be dispens'd in <HI>this World</HI> unto us. The <HI>Divine Judgments,</HI> under which we may fall, by our Falls into Rebellion against our <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> are both <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal</HI>▪ The <HI>Spiritual Judgments,</HI> which Godly men may by their Sins bring upon themselves, are <HI>Internal De∣sertions,</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="000923_0101_0FAD3CE3E7EFB1A0"/>
wherein the Spirit of God witholds Influences of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> from them. The <HI>Temporal Judgments,</HI> are <HI>External Afflictions</HI>; And especially such as carry Notable <HI>Retaliations</HI> in them. One <HI>End</HI> of these <HI>Judgments,</HI> is to Amend, and Reform, and cure the miscarriages of Godly Men, and promote a Due <HI>Repentance</HI> in them: And yet another <HI>End</HI> of these <HI>Judgments,</HI> is, to vindicate the <HI>Holiness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, and make all that saw the Miscarriages of those Godly men, to see that the <HI>Lord of the Holy Angels,</HI> will allow no such Things, in any that belong unto Him. When Godly men, have by any piece of notorious <HI>Ʋngodliness,</HI> Laid themselves open to these <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, their way to be Saved from the <HI>Judgments,</HI> is to plead the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ over a∣gain, and thereon penitently to <HI>Confess</HI> and <HI>Forsake</HI> all that has been Amiss. They that already have what we may call, <HI>A Le∣gal Pardon,</HI> may yet want, what we may call, <HI>A Gospell Pardon,</HI> or the dissoluti∣on of their obligation to suffer the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God upon <HI>Earth</HI>; and by penitent <HI>Prayer,</HI> they are every day to seek such a <HI>Pardon.</HI> These Thoughts, are all over Coun∣tenanced in the Oracles of God. Wherefore, Let those that have <HI>Believed unto Righteousness,</HI> yet learn to <HI>Pass the Time of their Sojourning here in Fear.</HI></P>
