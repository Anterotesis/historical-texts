<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THere is a Glorious Prophecy, in Hab. 2 14 <HI>That the knowledge of the Glory of the Lord, shall fill the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea.</HI> We know, That in all Prophetical Scripture, <HI>People,</HI> are still meant by, <HI>Waters.</HI> The Spirit of Prophecy in this passage of Scripture, seems to fore-see, the Improvement and Advancement of Navigation, after the Invention of the <HI>Loadstone,</HI> in the Latter Dayes; The <HI>People</HI> shall then <HI>Cover the Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Ocean</HI> shall be <HI>Covered</HI> with Vessels, carrying of Men, to <HI>Do Business on the Great Waters.</HI> In the Prediction of that matter, 'twas very proper to call, <HI>The People,</HI> by the Name of, <HI>The Waters</HI>; for besides the Resemblance, which at all times they bear unto the <HI>Waters,</HI> upon which they are now Sailing, their Living on the <HI>Waters</HI> Entitles them to this Denomination, just as a Country or City, gives a Denomination to its In∣habitants; <HI>Greece</HI> to <HI>Grecians, Rome</HI> to <HI>Romans.</HI> And it is Predicted, That by means of <HI>Navigation</HI> thus grown towards perfection, it will come to pass, <HI>That the Knowledge of the most Glorious Lord will fill the Earth,</HI> and the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, shall be carried into all Corners of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Lord, Forgive</HI>! the Sinful Neglects of the <HI>Pro∣testant Nations</HI> to make their <HI>Navigation,</HI> Subser∣vient unto the Illustrious Design, of conveying the <HI>Knowledge of the most Glorious Lord,</HI> unto all parts of the Universe. And let Pious and Zealous men, Seriously Consider, what a Shame it is, that the <HI>Protestant Nations,</HI> which do so much Exceed the <HI>Popish</HI> in their <HI>Shipping,</HI> should so far come short of them, in their Endeavours by their <HI>Shipping</HI> to
<PB REF="000932_0003_0FAD92FCB02A5E38"/>
<HI>Propagate</HI> the Noble <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christianity.</HI> I hope, It will not be long, before <HI>Societies</HI> will be E∣rected, in the <HI>Protestant Nations,</HI> which will Study Numberless wayes, as much to out-do the <HI>Popish</HI> ones, in sending abroad the Charms of our <HI>Holy Religion</HI> unto the Regions where they send our <HI>Vessels,</HI> as our <HI>Holy Religion</HI> it self out-does the <HI>Ro∣mish,</HI> or the <HI>Pagan</HI> Idolatry. <HI>God will Bless your Voyages, O ye Christian Societies; The Lord Jesus Christ, will Bless them wonderfully.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, I could not but count it one way of being <HI>Serviceable,</HI> To promote the <HI>Know∣ledge,</HI> and <HI>Service of the most glorious Lord,</HI> among those that profess the Art of <HI>Navigation</HI>; who, tis most proper, should first have it <HI>themselves,</HI> before they will do much to bring <HI>others</HI> into it. A <HI>Ship well-Rigg'd,</HI> is a lovely Sight; a <HI>Ship well Mann'd,</HI> is a better. The Author was willing to do what he could, that the <HI>Ships</HI> belonging to his Neighbours (who are very much a <HI>Sea faring-Tribe,</HI>) should be fill'd with <HI>Good Men</HI>; which is the <HI>best-way,</HI> to be <HI>Well-Mann'd.</HI> He gave them therefore a Short-<HI>Winter-Sermon,</HI> which at their Desire, is now put into their Hands for their more <HI>Perpetual Monitor</HI> If he have not Set it off, with <HI>Ornaments</HI> and <HI>Gaieties,</HI> it may as well answer the End, (your <HI>Ships</HI> do so, and why not <HI>Sermons</HI>?) without them.</P>
<P>I find old <HI>Joachim</HI> hundreds of years ago, Prophe∣sied notable Successes to the <HI>English</HI> Nation, <HI>Propter Bon<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Marinarios</HI>; by means of Good <HI>Marriners.</HI> Who does not <HI>Wish</HI> for it? Go, Little Book; Publish not the <HI>Name</HI> of thy Author, but pursue His only <HI>Aim</HI>; which is, That the Lord JESUS CHRIST may be <HI>known</HI> upon the <HI>Waters.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>[To <HI>North Boston,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI><DATE> 26 d. 9 m. 1699.]</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>It is written, in Jon. I. 16.</BIBL>
<P><HI>The men feared the Lord exceedingly.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT <HI>men</HI> were these? The Beginning of the Chapter tells us, These men were the <HI>Marriners,</HI> of a Vessel bound for <HI>Tarshish</HI>: which <HI>Tarshish</HI> is by some Great Geographers, counted, not the <HI>Tarsus,</HI> that was the Metropolis of <HI>Calicia,</HI> but rather <HI>Tartessus,</HI> a City in a Spanish Island of the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> But we have now, a point of more Importance to prosecute, than that <HI>Geo∣graphical</HI> Controversy and Curiosity.</P>
<P>It has been an Observation, older than the Dayes of <HI>Plato,</HI> That the <HI>Sea is a School of Vice.</HI> It seems, the <HI>Fear of God</HI> is not sound so much among <HI>Sailors,</HI> as one would expect from
<PB N="6" REF="000932_0005_0FAD92FE2B9D0230"/>
their peculiar Circumstances. Tho' <HI>Seamen</HI> are both Afflicted by God, and Relieved by God, above other men, yet there is not al∣ways to be found among them, that <HI>Fear of God,</HI> whereto their Circumstances do oblige them.</P>
<P>'Tis true; In the Sacred Story, we find some <HI>Seamen</HI> remarkable for the <HI>Fear of God</HI>; And such Things as they met withal at <HI>Sea,</HI> were the occasion of it. These were the <HI>Marriners</HI> of the Vessel, that were carrying <HI>Jonah</HI> to <HI>Tarshish.</HI> A <HI>Fearful Storm</HI> was by God sent upon them in their Voyage. Both in the <HI>Coming</HI> of the <HI>Storm,</HI> and in the <HI>Cea∣sing</HI> of the <HI>Storm,</HI> they could not but evident∣ly see, the <HI>Finger of God.</HI> And, behold, the <HI>Fear of God</HI> was the Effect of what they saw. Before the <HI>Storm,</HI> these <HI>Marriners</HI> were poor, forlorn, wretched <HI>Idolaters.</HI> But a Minister in the Vessel told them of the Lord JEHO∣VAH, the True God of <HI>Israel,</HI> the Great God of <HI>Heaven.</HI> After the <HI>Storm,</HI> they be∣came the Worshippers of that Lord JEHO∣VAH, and, <HI>Feared the Lord exceedingly.</HI></P>
<P>Very many of you, O Congregation of the Lord, are <HI>Marriners.</HI> This Neighbour∣hood, above other Parts of the Town or Land, may be called, our <HI>Tribe of Zebulon.</HI> You are Witnesses, O our Sea-faring Neigh∣bours, and all the Neighbours, yea, and the
<PB N="7" REF="000932_0006_0FAD92FEC5862B58"/>
Holy Angels, are Witnesses, of our daily Agonies for your Welfare. <HI>Brethren, our Hearts Desire and Prayer to God, for you, is, that you may be Saved.</HI> We <HI>Fear exceedingly,</HI> Lest you <HI>Steer</HI> those <HI>False Courses</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> which may Entail Disasters on you, and lest you miss of a safe Arrival to the Port of Eternal Blessedness; And we <HI>Love exceedingly,</HI> to do all that can be done, to make you Happy. To Assist you in the obtaining of Happiness, I am willing to set before you, the Example of the <HI>Marriners,</HI> that <HI>Feared the Lord excee∣dingly.</HI> The <HI>Problem,</HI> which we have now to <HI>Work,</HI> is This;</P>
<P>That Sea-faring People should be God-fearing People.</P>
<P>Yea, I will carry the point so far, as to say, That <HI>No men,</HI> are more bound unto the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> than <HI>Seamen.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis to be hoped, That none of our Hea∣rers, will count themselves excused from the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> There are none of us all, to whose <HI>Conscience,</HI> there may not be made that Appeal, in Neh. 5.9. <HI>Ought ye not to walk in the Fear of God?</HI> But the <HI>Sea-faring</HI> Hearers, are to be now Addrest, with this Advice, above the Rest. There are none more obliged than YOU, to <HI>Walk</HI> (and Sail) <HI>in the Fear of God.
<PB N="8" REF="000932_0007_0FAD92FF54AE4408"/>
You</HI> pass thro' <HI>Exceeding Hazzards, You</HI> Endure <HI>Exceeding Hardships, You</HI> Receive <HI>Exceeding Mercies</HI>; and therefore Syrs, it becomes You, to <HI>Fear the Lord exceedingly.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, In the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> now give Attention, to those Admonitions, that will a∣rise unto you, from this Important</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE. In what Manners, and by what Actions, ought <HI>Sea-faring</HI> Persons, to make it Evident, that their Hearts are Fraighted with the <HI>Fear of God</HI>?</HEAD>
<P>By the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> you know, is meant, <HI>Religion.</HI> I am now to set before you the Description of A <HI>Religious Marriner.</HI> There are certain Expressions of <HI>Religion,</HI> whereby <HI>Sea faring</HI> persons must, as by so many <HI>Flags</HI> proclaim, That they have the <HI>Fear of God</HI> within them.</P>
<P>Very particularly.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Let it be a <HI>Sensible</HI> and a <HI>Sorrowful</HI> mat∣ter unto you, That so many of your <HI>Sea-fa∣ring Brethren,</HI> are so <HI>fearfully miserable,</HI> by their wanting the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> All that have the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in them, shew it by this mark; 'Tis a <HI>Grief</HI> unto them, to see others
<PB N="9" REF="000932_0008_0FAD93001860E3F8"/>
without the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> They may all of them say with him, in Psal. 119.158. <HI>I beheld the Transgressors, and was grieved.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Marriners</HI> are a Generation of men, greatly Serviceable to the <HI>Common wealth.</HI> Ordinarily they are men of stout and brave Spirits: They are under God, indeed the very Defence of our Nation: And we are beholden to them, for a very great part of those Enjoyments, whereby our Lives are sweetened unto us. The <HI>Invaluable Benefits,</HI> by the means of our <HI>Sea faring Friends</HI> done unto us, oblige us to no little Value and Friendship for them. What a Trouble should it be, unto all that have the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in them, to see such an <HI>Useful</HI> sort of men, so much abandoned unto all sort of <HI>Sinfulness</HI> and <HI>Wretchedness!</HI></P>
<P>It must be acknowledged unto the <HI>Exceeding Praise</HI> of God; There are many <HI>Marriners,</HI> that <HI>Fear the Lord exceedingly.</HI> We can find many <HI>Seamen,</HI> that are <HI>First-rate Christians,</HI> and exceed other men, for Piety, for Probity, for Charity. When our Lord Jesus Christ singled out His <HI>Disciples,</HI> He chose a company of <HI>Sailors.</HI> Truly, our Lord Jesus Christ, has no truer or greater <HI>Disciples</HI> under Heaven, than some that spend their Dayes, not upon the <HI>Earth,</HI> but upon the <HI>Sea.</HI> But can we say, <HI>They are all such.</HI> I would to God, we could.
<PB N="10" REF="000932_0009_0FAD9300D29BCB40"/>
No, No; As the Psalmist could say, in Psal. 36.1. <HI>The Transgression of the wicked saith with∣in my Heart, That there is no Fear of God before his Eyes:</HI> Thus, All people take notice of it, that <HI>Seamen,</HI> too many of them, too too com∣monly indulge themselves, in those miscarria∣ges, which declare them to be destitute of the <HI>Fear of God:</HI> About the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> we are told in the <HI>Word of God</HI>; (which <HI>Teacheth</HI> it:) That it is the <HI>Beginning of Wisdom:</HI> A man does not Begin to be <HI>Wise,</HI> until he have the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> Now concerning <HI>Wisdom,</HI> we read in Job 28.14. <HI>The Sea saith, It is not with me.</HI> 'Tis the gloss of a famous Interpre∣ter upon it; <HI>Apud Nautas non solet habitare Sapientia</HI>; There are few <HI>Sailors,</HI> that have real <HI>Wisdom</HI> in them.</P>
<P>Now, Syrs, Let the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> cause you to mourn over those <HI>Foolish People,</HI> that want the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> and mourn over all the mi∣series, to which they do by their <HI>Folly</HI> expose themselves. <HI>Mourn,</HI> I say, and Lift up your mournful Cries to God, for His Grace to be Showred from on High, upon the Hearts of your Perishing <HI>Brethren.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II</HI> Let the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> cause you to <HI>make all the Sail</HI> you can, to <HI>Faith in Christ,</HI> where alone, your Souls may be <HI>Anchored</HI> with Eter∣nal Safety. What is the <HI>Fear of God?</HI> The
<PB N="11" REF="000932_0010_0FAD93030A75BFE8"/>
right Notion of it, all the Bible over, is This: <HI>'Tis a Dread of the Divine Displeasure for Sin, driving a man unto the Lord Messiah, for Delive∣rance from this dreadful Displeasure, and from all the Causes and Effects thereof.</HI> Hence, in Psal. 147.11. They that <HI>Fear God,</HI> are described as those that <HI>Hope in his Mercy</HI>; that is, <HI>His Messiah.</HI></P>
<P>Hearken, <HI>Sailors</HI>: You are all of you <HI>Sin¦ners.</HI> Oh, be <HI>afraid</HI> lest the Wrath of God surprize you in your <HI>Sins</HI>; and let the Fright thereof put you upon, <HI>A Fight unto the Mercy of God in the Lord Jesus Christ:</HI> [An Incom∣parable Definition of a <HI>Justifying Faith,</HI> some∣times received in the Churches of God.] Fly away, with Distressed Souls, Fly away to the <HI>Jesus,</HI> who <HI>Delivers from the Wrath to come.</HI> Soul, Thou art <HI>hard Chas'd</HI> by terrible De∣stroyers; <HI>Put ashore,</HI> on the Mercy of God in the Lord Jesus Christ, by Faith, or thou art undone Eternally.</P>
<P>Are you going to <HI>Do Business on the Great Waters!</HI> I must mind you of it, Syrs, That you have a far greater <HI>Business</HI> to do before you go. Get into the Lord Jesus Christ, by committing your Never Dying Souls, into His Ever glorious Hands. A <HI>Sailor</HI> at <HI>Sea</HI> may say with the Psalmist, in Psal. 119.109. <HI>My Soul is continually in my Hand.</HI> But before it come to this, O man, I beg it of thee, if
<PB N="12" REF="000932_0011_0FAD9304CFE7EA28"/>
thou Love thy <HI>Soul,</HI> that thou effectually put thy <HI>Soul,</HI> into the <HI>Hand</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, by Repairing to Him, and Relying on Him, for thy <HI>Righteousness,</HI> thy <HI>Blessedness,</HI> thy <HI>Everlasting Life.</HI> I Remember, the Poet counted him a <HI>Bold</HI> man, that ventured first of all, to go to <HI>Sea; Audax Japetigenus,</HI>— yea, but I earnestly testify unto you; He that will Venture to <HI>Sea,</HI> before he have Savingly closed with the Lord Jesus Christ by Faith, is a <HI>Bold</HI> man, yea, he is a <HI>Mad</HI> man; an hardy, a Sottish, a desperately venture some Creature, It may be said of him, as, in Prov. 23.34. <HI>Thou shalt be as he that lyes down in the midst of the Sea, or as he that lyes on the Top of a Mast.</HI> Sirs; will you go to <HI>Sea,</HI> before you have <HI>made up your Accounts?</HI> Oh, There are sad Accounts between God and you: I beseech you, get them all made up, in your <HI>Believing</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ, for the <HI>Pardon</HI> of all your Sins, before you stir. The <HI>First Ship,</HI> no doubt, that ever was Built, was that famous <HI>Ark</HI> built by <HI>Noah</HI>; a <HI>Ship,</HI> of perhaps forty two thousand Tuns. This <HI>Ark,</HI> was in This, a <HI>Type</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, That the <HI>Salvation</HI> of our Souls does depend on our being <HI>in Him.</HI> Neighbours, Don't step into any <HI>Ship,</HI> until you are first got into that <HI>Ark.</HI> It was said, in Psal. 32.6. <HI>Every one that is Godly, shall pray unto thee, in a Time when thou mayest be found;
<PB N="13" REF="000932_0012_0FAD9306172CA9B8"/>
surely, in the Floods of great Waters, they shall not come nigh unto him.</HI> Don't, Oh, Don't put off the work of <HI>Coming Nigh</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ by Faith, until thou art Lanched forth into the <HI>Floods of great Waters</HI>: It may then be, <HI>All too late.</HI> I lay the Charge of God upon thee, That before thy going to <HI>Sea,</HI> thou Retire, and Ponder, upon the Sinful State of thy <HI>Soul,</HI> and give no <HI>Rest</HI> unto thy <HI>Heavy la∣den Soul,</HI> (a Soul ready to <HI>Sink</HI> under the <HI>hea∣vy Lading of Sin,</HI>) until thou hast found <HI>Rest</HI> for thy <HI>Soul</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ. Said the Psalmist, in Psal. 18.4, 6, 16. <HI>The Floods made me afraid; In my Distress I called upon the Lord, and cryed unto my God: He drew me out of many Waters.</HI> Consider, poor <HI>Sailor,</HI> when thou art going on the <HI>many Waters,</HI> Consider, the Anger of God, at thy Sin, and at thee for thy Sin, is Raised against thee, like an <HI>horrible Tempest</HI>; and be afraid of those Tremendous <HI>Floods</HI>: Oh, plead with the Holy God, that the Lord Jesus Christ, has like <HI>Jonah,</HI> been cast over-board into the Swelling and Roaring <HI>Sea</HI> of Enraged <HI>Justice,</HI> for the appeasing of the <HI>Tempest</HI>; and cry to Him, That <HI>though He hath been Angry with you; His Anger may be turned away.</HI> When the <HI>Sins</HI> of a man are <HI>Pardoned,</HI> they are, as it were, <HI>Cast into the Depths of the Sea.</HI> Let none of you dare to Sail upon the <HI>Depths of the Sea,</HI> until your <HI>Sins,</HI> by being
<PB N="14" REF="000932_0013_0FAD9308634795F0"/>
<HI>Pardoned,</HI> are <HI>Cast into the Depths of the Sea.</HI> 'Tis obtained, by going to the Lord Jesus Christ, and sincerely thus desiring of Him, and thus depending on Him, <HI>O Blessed Lord, Thou art my Lord Redeemer; I come to thee for Grace, and for Glory, and for every good thing. O Save me, as thou art able to Save me, unto the uttermost.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III</HI> Let the <HI>Fear of God</HI> cause you to <HI>Steer clear</HI> of the <HI>Sins,</HI> which are the more frequent <HI>Rocks</HI> or <HI>Shoals,</HI> whereupon the Souls of <HI>Sai∣lors</HI> are <HI>Shipwrack'd.</HI> What is the <HI>Fear of God?</HI> We are told, in Job 28.28. <HI>The Fear of the Lord,</HI> is <HI>to Depart from Evil.</HI> [Compare, Prov. 3.7. and Prov. 16.6.] Let our <HI>Sea fa∣ring</HI> People then be <HI>Sin fearing</HI> people; and count <HI>Sin</HI> the worst <HI>Evil</HI> in the World. In∣dulge not your selves in any <HI>One Sin.</HI> You may see one thing aboard, that may livelily set home this Counsil upon you. If there be but <HI>One Leak</HI> aboard allowed and neglect∣ed, that <HI>One Leak</HI> may prove the Destruction of all. Man, A <HI>Lust</HI> is a <HI>Leak</HI> in thy Soul, if it be allowed, it will prove thy Damna∣tion at the last, it will <HI>Drown thee in Per∣dition.</HI></P>
<P>But there are some <HI>Vices,</HI> which are the <HI>Special Vices</HI> of the <HI>Sea.</HI> Against those <HI>Vices</HI> especially, be all of <HI>you</HI> warned that go to
<PB N="15" REF="000932_0014_0FAD930926BB7B48"/>
<HI>Sea.</HI> As men in several <HI>Nations,</HI> and in seve∣ral <HI>Ages,</HI> thus men in several <HI>Callings,</HI> have that which may be called, <HI>Their own Iniquity</HI>▪ Now, let a <HI>Sailor</HI> be able to say with the Psal∣mist, in Psal. 18.23. <HI>I was upright before God, and I kept my self from mine Iniquity.</HI> If other <HI>Marriners</HI> do those Ill Things which <HI>Marri¦ners</HI> too often are <HI>Used,</HI> or at least are <HI>Tempted</HI> unto, Let it be thy care, O man, that thou mayst say with him, in Noh. 5.15. <HI>But so did not I, because of the Fear of God.</HI></P>
<P>As now; Is not the Sin of profane <HI>Swear∣ing</HI> and <HI>Cursing,</HI> become too notorious among our <HI>Sailors</HI>? Reform that Impiety, Ye pre∣sumptuous <HI>Fighters against God,</HI> Reform it; else you that now Sail in a vast <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>Waters,</HI> must ere long have that blasphemous unruly <HI>Tongue,</HI> tortured in the <HI>Fiery Ocean</HI> of the Wrath of God, where you shall in vain cry, <HI>Oh! for a Drop of Water to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Tongue!</HI> Think on that word, in Jam. 5.12 <HI>Above all things my Brethren, Swear not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Filthy</HI> Speaking, <HI>Baudy</HI> Speaking, Unclean and Obscene <HI>Ribaldry</HI>▪ is too commonly heard in the mouths of <HI>Sailors.</HI> Leave off this <HI>Buse¦ness.</HI> 'Tis more loathsome, then all the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st cast up in the <HI>Vomits</HI> of the <HI>Sea sick.</HI> Make<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not your excuse, <HI>Words are but Wind.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may be such a <HI>wind,</HI> as may s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Waves of Eternal Confusion. Think on
<PB N="16" REF="000932_0015_0FAD930A02C48AB8"/>
that word, in Eph. 5.4. <HI>Let not Filthiness, nor Foolish Talking be among you, but rather giving of Thanks.</HI></P>
<P>The Sins of <HI>Unchastity,</HI> are too often the Sins of <HI>Sailors. Fornication</HI> and <HI>Adultery,</HI> and other Diabolical practices do render many Vessels, horribly <HI>Foul. Sailors,</HI> Be prevai∣led withal, to <HI>Abhor</HI> that Vice, which will render you, the <HI>Abhorred of the Lord.</HI> It were better for you, to drink the nasty <HI>Bildge-water,</HI> than to taste the <HI>stollen waters</HI> of <HI>Un∣chastity.</HI> Think on that word of God, in Heb. 13.4. <HI>Whoremongers, and Adulterers God will Judge.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a significant similitude, in Jam. 3.4, 5. <HI>Behold the Ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small Helm, whithersoever the Governour listeth: Even so the Tongue.</HI>—That Little <HI>Helm</HI> in thy mouth; Govern it, O man, and Restrain it, by the Rules in the <HI>Word</HI> of God; else thou wilt run upon some fatal mischief. Mind, even as if it were hung up in the <HI>Steerage,</HI> that Command of Heaven, in Psal. 34.12, 13. WHAT MAN IS HE THAT DESIRETH LIFE? KEEP THY TONGUE FROM EVIL.</P>
<P>I will add; The First man that ever built a <HI>Ship,</HI> once fell into the Sin of <HI>Drunken∣ness.</HI> Are none of you that <HI>Sail</HI> in a <HI>Ship,</HI>

too liable unto that <HI>woful Sin?</HI> Oh, Beware of that <HI>Beastly Vice. Beastly,</HI> did I call it? I have wrong'd the <HI>Beasts,</HI> by so calling it: <HI>Beasts</HI> will not be <HI>Drunk:</HI> To be <HI>Drunk,</HI> turns <HI>Men</HI> into worse than <HI>Beasts</HI>: A <HI>Drunken</HI> man, is but <HI>Old English</HI> for, A <HI>Drowned</HI> man. Let our <HI>Sai∣lors</HI> take haed of being <HI>Drunkards,</HI> lest God Al∣mighty <HI>Drown</HI> them, yea, <HI>Damn</HI> them, for their being so. Think on that word, in 1 Cor. 6.10. <HI>Drunkards shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly; Whatever <HI>Lewdness</HI> may be too fre∣quently incident unto <HI>Sailors</HI>; I must give you the word, <HI>Bear away,</HI> Oh, <HI>Bear away</HI> from it. We read about the <HI>Ships</HI> of <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> in 2 Chron 20.37. <HI>The Ships were Broken, that they were not able to go their Voyage. Ahaziahs</HI> men were his Marriners; a Wicked, Horrid, Abominable crue, were the <HI>Ships</HI> of that King <HI>Mann'd</HI> withal. Syrs, You'l hazard the <HI>Brea∣king</HI> of your <HI>Ships,</HI> and which is infinitely worse, the <HI>Breaking</HI> of your <HI>Souls,</HI> if you don't <HI>break off</HI> your Ungodly Wayes, and <HI>Shape another Course.</HI></P>
<P>When You are Sollicited unto the doing of my <HI>Ill Thing,</HI> I wish you would fortify your selves, with the Thoughts of <HI>One Thing,</HI> which often occurs unto the <HI>Marriner.</HI> Don't you often Divert your selves with <HI>Fishing</HI>? In do∣ing so, then think with your selves, <HI>The Devil has
<PB N="18" REF="000932_0017_0FAD930B66160BB8"/>
cast out his Hooks, to catch my precious and im∣mortal Soul: His Hooks I am told, are Baited with the pleasures of Sin; or, perhaps with the Hopes of Riches: If I do any Sinful Thing, to ob∣tain these Pleasures and Riches, the Hooks of the Devil have taken me. But if I am Seized by those Hooks of Hell, what, ah what is like to become of me, throughout Eternal Ages!</HI></P>
<P>In fine; 'Tis a common thing, for <HI>Sailors</HI> when they have received their <HI>Wages,</HI> to be gone unto Ill Houses, and there <HI>Squander a∣way</HI> in a <HI>few weeks</HI> at Riotous Living, all that they have got, by <HI>many months</HI> of hard Ser∣vice aboard and abroad. Would not any Considerate <HI>Murriner,</HI> call that <HI>man,</HI> a <HI>Fool,</HI> and a <HI>Sot,</HI> and not worthy to be called a <HI>man,</HI> who should so ridiculously, throw away, what he hath Earned with so much of Diffi∣culty. But, O Silly Sailor, come to thy wits, and think, <HI>In these Impious Courses, I not only throw away all my Earnings, in such an unac∣countable manner, that all mankind will deride me, and I shall tear my own Hair for madness, when I reflect upon it, but I shall throw away my own SOUL also, and for the Shadow of some fil∣thy Delight, which is but for a moment, I shall cast my self into the Burning Lake of the Wrath of God, where the Smoak of my Torment will ascend for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="19" REF="000932_0018_0FAD930C4AE5C798"/><HI>IV.</HI> Let the <HI>Fear of God</HI> keep you from car∣rying any thing <HI>Aboard,</HI> that may Raise a <HI>Tempest,</HI> either on your <HI>Vessel,</HI> or in your <HI>Con∣science.</HI> There was no <HI>Jonas</HI> Aboard, when 'tis said, <HI>The men feared the Lord exceedingly.</HI> Why, show your <HI>Fear of God,</HI> by not carrying any <HI>Jonas</HI> Aboard There is nothing of so much concernment, for <HI>Sea-faring</HI> people, as to have the <HI>Gracious Presence</HI> of God with them, in their <HI>Voyages.</HI> Methinks, you should say with him, in Exod. 33.15. Lord, <HI>If thy presence go not with us, carry us not up from hence.</HI> But you cannot enjoy the <HI>Gracious Presence</HI> of God aboard, if you carry any <HI>Ac∣cursed Thing</HI> aboard. An <HI>Accursed Thing</HI> brought Confusion on a <HI>Camp</HI>; and will bring as much Confusion on a <HI>Ship.</HI> I come unto you then, as the Angel unto <HI>Joshua,</HI> saying, <HI>Put away every Accursed Thing from among you, that so the Blessed God may go with you, and multiply His Blessings on you.</HI> Put away every Thing that will probably expose you, to the <HI>Curse of God.</HI> You <HI>Clean</HI> your <HI>Vessels,</HI> when you are going to <HI>Sea</HI>; I pray, <HI>Cleanse</HI> your <HI>Consciences.</HI></P>
<P>More particularly. One Caution proper for you, is This: That you be sure, you don't <HI>Go out of the way,</HI> when you <HI>Go to Sea.</HI> There was a man, who would needs <HI>Go to Sea,</HI> when
<PB N="20" REF="000932_0019_0FAD930D00CE6BC0"/>
he had no <HI>Call</HI> to be there: But we read in Jon 1.4. <HI>The Lord sent out a great Wind into the Sea, and there was a mighty Tempest in the Sea, so that the Ship was like to be broken.</HI> Be∣fore you <HI>Go to Sea,</HI> seriously Examine, <HI>What Call you have to Go to Sea</HI>? Examine, Whether the <HI>Rules of Christianity</HI> given in the Sacred Scriptures, be observed in your going to <HI>Sea</HI>? Examine, Whether in going to <HI>Sea,</HI> you have done, what you may with peace Reflect up∣on, if you saw the <HI>Ship</HI> foundring, or splitting under you. Could you say, <HI>Lord, I am where thou didst call me to be</HI>? Syrs, Where are your <HI>Sailing Orders?</HI></P>
<P>Truly, 'Twere much to be advised, That the <HI>Enchantments</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> may not have too strong and quick a Force upon some, to make them rashly leave <HI>Good Callings,</HI> by which they might competently subsist ashore. I am far from condemning all that leave their <HI>Cal∣lings,</HI> and go away to <HI>Sea</HI>; but this we have seen, where one hath <HI>Advanced</HI> himself, more than two have <HI>Ruined</HI> themselves, by doing so.</P>
<P>But then, there is another Caution, which is no more than what is Needful for you; This is, That when you <HI>Go to Sea,</HI> you don't go out with the Guilt of any <HI>Injustice</HI> upon you. Of the <HI>Sea faring,</HI> 'tis said, <HI>They do Bu∣siness on the Great Waters.</HI> God will find La∣mentable
<PB N="21" REF="000932_0020_0FAD9310AA64F760"/>
<HI>Business</HI> for you to do on the <HI>Great Waters,</HI> if you have not been True, and Just, and Fair, and Square in your <HI>Business</HI> before you go. Said the Apostle, in 1 Thes. 4.6. <HI>Let no man go beyond, and defraud his Brother, in any matter, because the Lord is the Avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you.</HI> There are <HI>Sailors,</HI> that have taken <HI>Wages</HI> of their <HI>Masters</HI> aforehand and then run away from those <HI>Masters,</HI> to <HI>Ship</HI> themselves with others. Wretch, Go <HI>Ship</HI> thy self where thou wilt, I <HI>forewarn</HI> thee, that thou shalt find, <HI>The Lord the Avenger of all such.</HI> Thus also, How <HI>Un∣prosperous</HI> oftentimes are the <HI>Ships,</HI> about which there has been any <HI>Dishonesty</HI> unrepented of? Cheat no man of his <HI>Dues:</HI> Do not unjustly decline to pay the <HI>Debts</HI> that are owing to any man. <HI>Ships,</HI> either <HI>Built</HI> or <HI>Fill'd,</HI> not by Right, will find their <HI>Sails</HI> of such a Make, that no Good Winds will Blow into them. They that by <HI>Iniquity</HI> in their Dealings, have made <HI>Shipwreck of a Good Conscience,</HI> what can they look for, but every other <HI>Shipwreck</HI>?</P>
<P>And perhaps, it may not be amiss to add this one Caution more, unto all the rest. There are some kinds of <HI>Passengers,</HI> 'tis a dangerous thing to <HI>Ship</HI> them. There are <HI>Sinners,</HI> of whom 'tis said, <HI>Evil pursues them,</HI> and the <HI>Ven∣geance of God</HI> will follow them, Let them go where they will. There are bloody <HI>Murder∣ers,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="000932_0021_0FAD931184082290"/>
and <HI>Pyrates,</HI> and <HI>Atheists,</HI> and those Mon∣sters of Wickedness, that have a mountain of Sin upon them, enough to Sink the strongest Ship under Heaven. Sirs, many a <HI>Ship</HI> ha's been lost, by having a <HI>Jonas</HI> aboard. There are some, in such Ill Terms with Heaven, that if one could help it any way in the World, one would not care to carry them: Tis no safe thing, to <HI>be of their Mess!</HI></P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> Let the <HI>Pear of God,</HI> put you upon <HI>Prayer to God</HI>; the <HI>Prayer of Faith,</HI> and the Holy <HI>Wor∣ship</HI> of God. If there be no <HI>Prayer to God,</HI> there is no <HI>Fear of God:</HI> Unto the <HI>Prayerless Marriner,</HI> it may be said; as in Job 15.4. <HI>Thou castest off Fear, and Restrainest Prayer before God.</HI></P>
<P>Now, <HI>Prayer</HI> must be used before your <HI>Voyages,</HI> if you would have <HI>Preservation</HI> and <HI>Prosperity</HI> in your <HI>Voyages.</HI> Tis no rare thing, for <HI>Marri∣ners,</HI> to use wicked <HI>Superstitions,</HI> and <HI>Sorceries,</HI> &amp; <HI>Fooleries,</HI> that they may obtain <HI>Prosperous Voyages.</HI> To Do those Things, is to go unto the <HI>Devil,</HI> and not unto <HI>God,</HI> that your <HI>Voyages</HI> may be <HI>Prospered.</HI> And however, God may for the present permit the <HI>Prince of the power of the Air,</HI> to Do some odd Things, for the Encourage∣ment of those who <HI>Diabolically</HI> seek unto him, yet the Impiety proves <HI>Bitterness in the Latter End</HI>: Horrible Destruction at last overtakes them that were so Impious. Does any man
<PB N="23" REF="000932_0022_0FAD93121827E238"/>
imagine, That <HI>Prosperity</HI> in our Affairs, is in the power of <HI>Man</HI> and not the gift of <HI>God?</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> himself, is a better <HI>Christian</HI> than such a <HI>Man.</HI> I don't speak this without <HI>Book</HI>; I find in the <HI>Book</HI> of God, that the <HI>Devil</HI> himself said of a <HI>prosperous Man,</HI> in Job. 1.10. <HI>Thou hast blessed the work of his hinds, and his substance is increased in the Land.</HI> If men have their <HI>Substance increased by the Sea,</HI> 'tis by the <HI>Blessing</HI> of God, on the <HI>work of their Hands.</HI> Well, If all <HI>Prosperity</HI> be from God, how can we, without <HI>Prayer</HI> to God, expect <HI>Prosperity</HI>? Never undertake a <HI>Voyage,</HI> without much <HI>Prayer</HI> before the <HI>Voyage,</HI> and about it. Oh, <HI>Pray</HI> much unto the <HI>Lord on High, who is mightier than the mighty waves of the Sea,</HI> That He would Mercifully order, and Happily direct, all your motions towards the <HI>Sea; Pray</HI> to Him, Whose <HI>Way is in the Sea, Lord, Guide me in the way wherein thou wilt have me to go, about my going to Sea.</HI> This is no more than what is required in Prov. 3.6. <HI>In all thy ways acknow∣ledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.</HI></P>
<P>There is a commendable practice among you, to send in your <HI>Notes</HI> unto the Congre∣gation, intimating, That such and such, <HI>Bound to Sea, desire a Remembrance in the prayers of the Congregation</HI> Well; but have you solicitously Employ'd your own <HI>Prayers</HI> over your <HI>Voyage</HI>?
<PB N="24" REF="000932_0023_0FAD9313B0CD02F0"/>
'Tis but a <HI>mocking of God,</HI> for you to ask our <HI>Prayers,</HI> if you make no <HI>Prayers</HI> of your own <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Indeed some very worthy <HI>Marriners,</HI> have used, before their <HI>Voyages,</HI> to carry their Libe∣ral <HI>Alms,</HI> unto these and those <HI>poor Servants</HI> of Christ, that were Eminent for <HI>Holiness</HI>; obli∣ging them to <HI>Pray</HI> for the <HI>good Success</HI> of their <HI>Voyages</HI> every day during the Time of their Absence: And God has Bless'd those <HI>Marri∣ners,</HI> most wonderfully. Nevertheless, <HI>Pray for thy self,</HI> O Marriner, <HI>Pray for thy self.</HI> What man will be content, that none but <HI>a∣nother</HI> shall <HI>Go to Heaven</HI> for him?</P>
<P>But what can <HI>Prayer</HI> do, if it be not the <HI>Prayer of Faith?</HI> Without <HI>Faith,</HI> it is not <HI>Ef∣fectual.</HI> It must be <HI>Faithful,</HI> as well as <HI>Fer∣vent.</HI> Single out such <HI>Promises</HI> of God, as may suit your <HI>Voyages,</HI> and let your <HI>Faith</HI> humbly urge those <HI>Promises</HI> for His <HI>Protecti∣ons.</HI> One of those <HI>Promises,</HI> you have in Psal. 65.5. <HI>O God of our Salvation, Thou art the Confidence of them that are afar off upon the Sea.</HI> Another of them you have, in Isa. 43 3. <HI>When thou passest thro' the waters, I will be with thee.</HI> A Third of them you have in Heb. 13.5. <HI>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> Now go before the Lord, and put these <HI>Promises</HI> in suit: [They are all of them, <HI>Cables</HI> that will hold, be the stress never so great!] <HI>O God of my Salvation,
<PB N="25" REF="000932_0024_0FAD931458DA07B0"/>
according to thy word, I put my confidence in thee for my Salvation, in my going afar off upon the Sea. I am now passing thro' the waters; wilt thou be with me in my passage?</HI> I <HI>am taking my leave of my Friends, wilt thou never leave me? For the sake of my Lord Jesus Christ, who has purchased such Blessings for me, Let thy promised Goodness and Mercy follow me wherever I go.</HI></P>
<P>But then, when you are actually <HI>Embarked</HI> on your <HI>Voyages,</HI> let the <HI>Worship</HI> of God, be maintained aboard. Said the Psalmist, in Psal. 5.7. <HI>In thy Fear I will worship.</HI> If God be not <HI>wor∣shipped</HI> in the <HI>Vessel,</HI> we may say of that <HI>Vessel,</HI> as <HI>Abraham</HI> did of that Country, <HI>There is no Fear of God in this place.</HI> What an happy, what a lovely thing were it, if your Vessels might be, like little <HI>Floating Churches,</HI> for the Devotions therein performed? Those <HI>Masters,</HI> who don't <HI>pray</HI> with their <HI>Families,</HI> are very <HI>Pagans,</HI> worse than <HI>Pagans.</HI> Now let me tell you, <HI>Masters,</HI> your <HI>Companies</HI> at <HI>Sea,</HI> are your <HI>Families.</HI> And, if you would <HI>pray</HI> with them every day, and <HI>Keep good Orders aboard,</HI> you would find, sober and civil men, would covet still to go with you; yea, your men would Bless God for you, throughout the Dayes of Eternity. <HI>Masters,</HI> If any of you are <HI>Prayer∣less,</HI> I urgently come unto you, with the Call of <HI>Jonahs Master,</HI> and I wish your <HI>Marriners</HI> would also come unto you with such a Call,

<P>On the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> still double your Devo∣tions; and Repeat Sermons also on this <HI>Day of God,</HI> by which you may keep alive the Re∣membrance of what you once heard in the <HI>House of God.</HI> Nor let that High <HI>Day,</HI> be needlesly diverted unto such Things, as are improper for it.

<P>If you will do thus, then, as we read in Act. 27.23. <HI>No small Tempest lay on us, and all hope that we should be Saved was then taken a∣way: but</HI> Paul <HI>said, There stood by me the Angel of God whose I am, and whom I Serve; saying,

Fear not, God hath given thee all them that Sail with thee:</HI> Even so, whatever <HI>Tempest</HI> may a∣rise, if you be able to say, <HI>O God, Thine I am, and Thee I Serve</HI>: Who can tell, but, O Ma∣ster, God may <HI>give thee all them that Sail with thee?</HI> If the Lord Jesus Christ, be <HI>aboard</HI> with you, how comfortably are you circumstanced? <HI>Marriners</HI> that behave themselves as the <HI>Disci∣ples</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ shall have Him <HI>aboard</HI> with them.

<P>Would you be duely apprehensive of your <HI>Mortality,</HI> certainly, it would make you <HI>Now</HI> to <HI>do</HI> those Things, which you will <HI>Wish</HI> to have done, when you come to <HI>Dy.</HI> There is no one point, that I would press upon you, with more of Agony than This: If you were now going down in the <HI>Deep</HI>; Suppose an Ir∣resistible <HI>Wind</HI> were driving the <HI>Ship,</HI> into an unavoidable <HI>Wreck</HI>; suppose more than Six Foot Water in the Hold, and the Sides of the <HI>Ship</HI> apace opening the <HI>Port holes</HI> of Death; and no possibility of your ever getting to Land alive. What <HI>Sentiments</HI> of Things, would you have in such a <HI>Deadly Extremity?</HI> Sure I am, you would then wish, <HI>Oh, That
<PB N="33" REF="000932_0032_0FAD931D8A4C2B60"/>
I had not Lived in any Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, but Lived soberly, and Righteously and Godlily in the World.</HI> You would then wish, Oh, <HI>That I had long ago given my self up to the Lord Jesus Christ, and by laying hold on His of∣fered Righteousness, Laid hold on Eternal Life.</HI> You would then wish, <HI>Oh, Let not my Soul now be gathered with Sinners, I wish, I had not been one of them; I wish, I had pray'd without Ceasing; I wish, I had made the Word of God the man of my Counsil; I wish I had never derided Serious Religion, but most seriously practised it.</HI> Wherefore, <HI>Now</HI> use the <HI>Discretion,</HI> to do those Things, which in a <HI>Dying Hour,</HI> you may not Look back with Horror upon; do those things, that may comfort you in a <HI>Dying Hour,</HI> and help you comfortably to say, <HI>Remember, now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth!</HI></P>
<P>And I will add; Methinks the <HI>Shortness</HI> of your <HI>Time,</HI> [How few <HI>Sailors</HI> Live to be <HI>Old men!</HI>] should very particularly cure your <HI>Mis∣pence</HI> of your <HI>Time. Sailors,</HI> I hear, and I fear, 'Tis <HI>utterly a Fault among you.</HI> How many weary Contrivances have you, at <HI>Sea,</HI> to <HI>pass the Time</HI> away? Yea, but thy <HI>Soul,</HI> O man, thy <HI>Soul,</HI> is on the very Banks &amp; Brinks of Eternity. <HI>Cast the Line,</HI> O man; How many Fathom, I pray? Art thou sure, That thou hast one weeks <HI>Time</HI> left unto thee? Now, to be for nothing but <HI>pastime</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="000932_0033_0FAD931EB55A4B70"/>
with this little <HI>Spot</HI> of <HI>Time!</HI> Oh, a little more of this <HI>Time,</HI> in <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Supplications</HI> and <HI>Meditations</HI> over the State of thy <HI>Soul.</HI> That, <HI>That</HI> would be for thy good Account, when <HI>Time</HI> shall be no more. As the Apostle says, <HI>Pass the Time of your Sojourning,</HI> so let it be said, <HI>Pass the Time of your Sailing, in Fear</HI>; even in the <HI>Fear of God.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> Let the <HI>Fear of God</HI> work in you, a zeal rightly to improve the <HI>Works of God</HI>; e∣ven those <HI>Works,</HI> which at <HI>Sea,</HI> you are En∣tertained withal. We read concerning the <HI>Sea-faring,</HI> in Psal 107.23, 24. <HI>They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do business in great Waters; these see the works of the Lord, and His Wonders in the Deep.</HI> Now there is an use which they should make of what they see. And what use? When some had seen the Great <HI>Works</HI> of God, it was said upon it, in Zeph. 3.7. <HI>I said, surely thou wilt Fear me.</HI> When you go to <HI>Sea,</HI> you cannot but see the <HI>Wonders</HI> of <HI>Creation</HI>: See them all, with de∣vout <HI>Wonders</HI> confessing the <HI>Creator</HI> of them all. Your <HI>Ships</HI> carry you to <HI>Do Business,</HI> where you see <HI>Creatures,</HI> that are full of <HI>Won∣ders.</HI> Let it be part of your <HI>Business</HI> there, devoutly to confess, <HI>These are the Works of the Lord</HI>! and adore the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of the Lord, which is display'd in all
<PB N="35" REF="000932_0034_0FAD931F08B2AF40"/>
these <HI>Works.</HI> You'l see many <HI>Wonderful Things</HI> by <HI>Going to Sea,</HI> which they who Travel not from the sight of their own <HI>Chimneys</HI> can see nothing of: The Invention of the <HI>Loadstone</HI> and the <HI>Compass,</HI> about <HI>Three hundred years</HI> ago, has led men to the view of <HI>Wonderful Things</HI> every where, which till then they were more strangers unto; Behold them all with pious Contemplations, and give Glory to the God, Who made all these Things Even the <HI>mute Fish</HI> themselves, do with a <HI>Loud Voice</HI> call upon you, <HI>Fear God, and give Glory to Him.</HI></P>
<P>But then the <HI>Wonders</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> these Entertain you at <HI>Sea,</HI> with yet a more particular Application.</P>
<P>Have you not met with <HI>wonderful Mercies,</HI> with merciful Deliverances and Salvations, up∣on the <HI>Sea</HI>! Let the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> keep you from Forgetting those <HI>Mercies.</HI> The Favours we have received on the <HI>Waters,</HI> the memory of them should not be written on the <HI>Waters</HI>; no, but as it were, on the durable <HI>Marble.</HI> Oh, lay that charge, and charm upon your Souls, in Psal. 103.2. <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and Forget not all His Benefits, who hath Redeem∣ed thy Life from Destruction.</HI> Have you no <HI>Journals,</HI> of what <HI>Mercies</HI> God hath at <HI>Sea</HI> be∣stow'd upon you? 'Tis fit, they should be <HI>Entred.</HI> And when you come home, 'tis well, that you ordinarily publish in the Congregation,
<PB N="36" REF="000932_0035_0FAD931FA69E0C20"/>
your desires to <HI>Praise</HI> the Name of God, for such <HI>Mercies.</HI> Thus we read, in Psal. 107.31, 32. <HI>He brings them unto their desired Ha¦ven. Oh, that men would praise the Lord, for His Goodness, and for His wonderful works to the Children of men. Let them Exalt Him also in the Congregation of the people, and praise Him in the Assembly of the Elders.</HI> But what signifie these verbal <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> if you don't <HI>Live</HI> your <HI>Thanks,</HI> as well as <HI>Give</HI> your <HI>Thanks</HI>? Who is the man, that so <HI>Offers praise,</HI> as to <HI>Glorify God</HI>? We are told, in Psal. 50.23. <HI>He that or∣ders his Conversation aright.</HI> Now, if you would <HI>Order your Conversation aright,</HI> be sure to <HI>Order</HI> it so, as in your <HI>perils</HI> at <HI>Sea,</HI> you would have chosen to have done. It is like∣ly, that like <HI>Jonahs Marriners,</HI> you have laid your selves under <HI>Vows</HI> to God Oh, Remem∣ber the VOWS, you have made in your Di∣stresses▪ <HI>God</HI> will Remember them, if you do <HI>not</HI> Have you not <HI>Vow'd,</HI> That if God spa∣red you in such and such Distresses, you would be more <HI>prayerful,</HI> more <HI>watchful,</HI> and spend your Time to better <HI>purposes,</HI> than formerly? Trifle not with the Eternal Majesty of Hea∣ven: Tremble at His Word, in Eccl. 5.4. <HI>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it, for He hath no pleasure in Fools: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy Hands?</HI> Resolve with the Saint,
<PB N="37" REF="000932_0036_0FAD9320624C5D70"/>
in Psal. 66.13, 14. <HI>I will pay thee my Vowes, which my Lips have uttered, and my Tongue hath spoken, when I was in Trouble.</HI></P>
<P>Again; Have you not seen <HI>wonderful Judg∣ments</HI> at <HI>Sea?</HI> Perhaps, you have <HI>your selves</HI> met with <HI>Disasters</HI> there. Don't fancy now, that a Blind <HI>Fortune</HI> sent those <HI>Disasters.</HI> There is the Hand of God in them all. They speak to you, as in Hag. 1.7, 9. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, consider your wayes. Ye looked for much, and lo it came to Little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it.</HI> You have also been Witnesses, to the Doleful, and Rue∣ful <HI>Calamities,</HI> wherewith others have there been overwhelmed. It was the commination in Isa. 2.16. <HI>The Day of the Lord of Hosts, shall be upon all the Ships.</HI> Our Lamentation has been upon the Execution of that Commi∣nation, in <HI>grievous Things,</HI> that our <HI>Marriners</HI> have met withal. Alas, Alas, How hardly have they been used? What <HI>Cruelties</HI> have many of them suffered; not only from the Hands of cruel <HI>Enemies</HI> abroad, but also from some of their own <HI>Commanders</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> in their own <HI>Ships</HI> at Home? To what consuming <HI>Diseases</HI> have they been exposed, while the <HI>Destroying Angels</HI> have had large Commissions to consume them, and cut them off, and what <HI>Pest houses</HI> have even their own <HI>Ships</HI> been unto them? Upon them there has fallen the seve∣rest
<PB N="38" REF="000932_0037_0FAD93212A7A7F18"/>
share of those <HI>Calamities,</HI> that have of late years distress'd a sinful world; and they have, <HI>Dy'd of Grievous Deaths.</HI> Take warning by these dismal Things, I entreat you; and let such things awaken you unto the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> It was said of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> in Zech. 9.4, 5. <HI>Behold, the Lord will smite her power in the Sea</HI>; And of others it follows, <HI>They shall See it and Fear.</HI></P>
<P>But know it, That if you would <HI>Fear the Lord Exceedingly,</HI> you must <HI>Fear the Lord Sea∣sonably</HI>; I mean, in your <HI>Youth.</HI> We read of One, who <HI>Feared the Lord Greatly:</HI> But that person could say, in 1 King. 18.12. <HI>I Fear the Lord from my Youth.</HI> Our <HI>Sea men</HI> are mostly <HI>Young Men.</HI> And because the <HI>Fear of God</HI> is no more among them, therefore it is, that so few of them ever come to be <HI>Old Men.</HI> Hear∣ken, <HI>Young men.</HI> Do you <HI>Betimes</HI> Devote your selves unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and be able to say unto Him, <HI>Lord, I am thy Servant, devoted unto thy Fear.</HI> There is a <HI>Ship</HI> of the greatest Consequence imaginable; The <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ is that <HI>Ship.</HI> The <HI>Commander</HI> of the <HI>Ship</HI> is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. Come to the Illustrious <HI>Commander.</HI> Request Him to Accept you among His <HI>Mar∣riners.</HI> Commit your selves to His Conduct; That is to say, Enter into <HI>Covenant</HI> with Him.
<PB N="39" REF="000932_0038_0FAD93220D1AD3F0"/>
<HI>Do This,</HI> now in your <HI>Youth,</HI> O my <HI>Young Folks</HI>▪ Lest you never have any Opportunity to do it at all. <HI>Do This,</HI> and you will make a more gainful Voyage, than ever the <HI>Marriners</HI> of <HI>So∣lomon</HI> did unto <HI>Ophir,</HI> or, <HI>Africa</HI>; as much more <HI>gainful,</HI> as <HI>Grace</HI> is <HI>better than the gain of fine Gold.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole; Take my <HI>Wishes</HI> for you all. We read of some, who neglected the Ser∣vice of the Lord Jesus Christ; because, Judg. 5.17. <HI>They did remain in Ships.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That this very Thing may Excite and Assist you, to Serve the Lord Jesus Christ; <HI>Because you remain in Ships.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That <HI>Heaven</HI> may be the <HI>Haven,</HI> which you are all bound unto, and that your <HI>Souls</HI> may, as <HI>Gaius's</HI> did, make a <HI>Good Voyage</HI> to that <HI>Haven.</HI> A Minister going from <HI>New England,</HI> in a <HI>Ship,</HI> that met with a <HI>Storm,</HI> wherein they all were Expecting the Vessel to Sink, said unto the affrighted Com∣pany, <HI>Come, who is now bound for Heaven among you?</HI> Behold, One is now <HI>Wishing,</HI> that you may <HI>All</HI> be so. I <HI>Wish,</HI> That you may have an Eye of daily Observation, upon the <HI>Sun of Righteousness</HI>; and <HI>Look unto Jesus.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That you may duely Regard, the <HI>Pole Star</HI> of the <HI>Scripture</HI>; whereto you will <HI>do well to take heed, as to a Light shining in a dark place.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That you may ply the <HI>Pump</HI> of <HI>Repentance,</HI> with continual Endeavours to get Sin out of the
<PB N="40" REF="000932_0039_0FAD9322C5C278D8"/>
<HI>Hold,</HI> of your <HI>Heart</HI>; and so, <HI>Draw Water be∣fore the Lord.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That when the <HI>Gales</HI> of the Spirit striving with you, are Blowing, you may <HI>Spread the Sails</HI> of your <HI>Souls</HI> before them, <HI>Sailing right before</HI> that Blessed <HI>Wind</HI>; and when He shall say, <HI>Seek my Face,</HI> your <HI>Hearts</HI> may answer, <HI>Thy Face, Lord, I will seek.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That you may often see <HI>What way</HI> you make; and <HI>Commune with your own Hearts,</HI> in impartial <HI>Self Examinations.</HI> I <HI>Wish,</HI> That you may thus proceed on in your <HI>Heavenly Voyage,</HI> however you may be <HI>Afflicted and Tossed with Tempests,</HI> until you come to <HI>Cast Anchor within the Vail.</HI></P>
<P>And, <HI>As for me, God forbid, that I should Sin against the Lord, in ceasing to Pray for you.</HI></P>
