<P>Briefly, Your <HI>Ministers</HI> are desirous to follow their <HI>Studies</HI> closely; and indeed, if they be no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Hard Students,</HI> it is impossible they should be <HI>Able Ministers of the New Testament.</HI> In their <HI>Publick Discourses,</HI> they are not fond of an <HI>Off hand Preach∣ing</HI>; they be not for <HI>Spitting of Sermons</HI>; they would not <HI>give the Lord that which cost them no∣thing</HI>; they would compose well Studied <HI>Meat-Offerings,</HI> not only for <HI>You</HI> O <HI>People</HI> of the Lord, but also for the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> Himself, that <HI>Great King, whose Name is dreadful</HI> It is needful, they shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have good <HI>Libraries,</HI> which, I assure you, are <HI>Costly Things</HI>: And it is needful, they should not be like the <HI>Clerks,</HI> who having large <HI>Libraries</HI> which they seldome look'd into, were by the K. of <HI>France</HI> compared unto men with <HI>Crooked Backs,</HI> which carryed a load they never look'd upon, but they must sit much in their <HI>Libraries,</HI> until they be∣come themselves <HI>walking Libraries.</HI> Besides all this; the <HI>Government</HI> of their <HI>Churches,</HI> takes up no little share of their Time.

Or, Is all <HI>Reason</HI> gone out of the world?</P>
<P>If your <HI>Ministers</HI> are prudently Thoughtful about their <HI>Maintainance,</HI> 'tis because they have Read that Word, 1 Tim 5.8 <HI>If any provide not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his own, he is worse than in Infidel.</HI> And those men are truly <HI>worse than Infidels,</HI> who clamour against an Honourable Provision for the Mini∣stry; the <HI>worst of Infidels</HI> do honourably <HI>Main∣tain</HI> those that are set apart, for the supposed Service of their Souls.</P>
<P>And that which may make the <HI>Repr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of</HI> to those men, who Rob their <HI>Ministers</HI> of their <HI>Dues,</HI> the more pungent is This; That there is a <HI>Sacriledge</HI> in the <HI>Robbery.</HI> Tis a <HI>Robbing of God.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ, in Heaven sayes, <HI>Ye did it unto me.</HI></P>
