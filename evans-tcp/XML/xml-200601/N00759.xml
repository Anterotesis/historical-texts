<HEAD>A PREFACE Containing Directions to CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>YOU may now hear (my dear Lambs) what other good Children have done, and re∣member how they wept and prayed by them∣selves; how earnestly they cried out for an in∣terest in the Lord Jesus Christ: May you not read how dutiful they were to their Parents? How diligent at their Books? how ready to learn the Scripture, and their Catechisms? Can you forget wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estions they were wont to ask? How much they feared a lye, how much they abhorred naughty company, how holy they lived, how dearly they were loved, how joyfully they died?</P>
<P>But tell me my dear Children, and tell me truly, Do you do as these Children did? Did you ever see your miserable state by Nature? Did you ever get by your self and weep for Sin, and pray for grace and pardon? Did you ever go to your Father and Mother, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster, or Mistress, &amp; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g of them to pity you, &amp; pray for you, &amp; to teach you what you shall do to be saved, what you shall do to get Christ, Heaven and Glory? Dost thou love to be taught good things?
<PB REF="000914_0006_0FACA1C2A47557F0"/>
Come tell me truly, my dear Child, for I would fain do what I can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to keep thee from falling into eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asting Fire. I would fain have one of those little ones, which Christ will take into his arms &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> dost thou spend thy time? is it in play &amp; Idleness, &amp; with wicked Children? Dare you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake Gods Name in vain, or swear, or tell a lye? Dare you do any thing which your Parents forbid you, &amp; neglect to do what they command you? Do you dare to run up and down upon the Lords-day? or do you keep in to read your Book, &amp; to learn what your good Parents command you? what do you say, Child? Which of these two sorts are you of? Let me talk a little with you, and ask you a few Questions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Were not these Children sweet Children, which feared God &amp; were dutiful to their Parents? Did not their Fathers &amp; Mothers, &amp; every body that fears God, love them &amp; praise them? What do you think is become of them, now they are dead and gone? Why, they are gone to Heaven, &amp; are singing Hallelujahs with the Angels: they see Glorious things, and having nothing but joy &amp; pleasure, they shall never sin any more, they shall never be beat any more, they shall never be sick, or in pain any more.</P>
<P N="2">2. And would not you have your Fathers love, your Mothers commendation; your Masters good word? Would not you have God &amp; Christ love
<PB REF="000914_0007_0FACA1C36B560650" MS="y"/>
you? &amp; would not you fain go to Heaven, when you die? And live with your godly Parents in Glory, and be happy for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whither do you think those Children go when they die, that will not do what they are bid but play the Truant, and lye, and speak naughty words, and break the Sabbath? whither do such Children go do you think? why, I will tell you, they which Lie, must to their Father the Devil into everlasting burning; they which never pray, God will pour out his wrath upon them; and when they beg and pray in Hell Fire, God will not forgive them; but there they must lie for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. And are you willing to go to Hell to be burned with the Devil and his Angels? Would you be in the same condition as naughty Chil∣dren? O Hell is a terrible place, that's worse a thousand times than whipping, Gods anger is worse than your Fathers anger; and are you willing to anger God? O Child, this is most certainly true that all that be wicked, and die so, must be turned into Hell; and if any be once there, there is no coming out again.</P>
<P N="5">5. Would you not do any thing in the world rather than be thrown into Hell Fire? Would you not do any thing in the world to get Christ, and grace and glory.</P>
<P N="6">6. Well now, what will you do? will you read this book a little, because your good Mother will make you do it, and because it is a little n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w
<PB REF="000914_0008_0FACA1C4F54920E8"/>
Book, but as soon as ever you have done, run away to play, and never think of it?</P>
<P N="7">7 How art thou now affected, poor Child, in the Reading of this Book? Have you shed ever a tear since you begun reading? Have you been by your self upon your knees; and begging that God would make you like these blessed Children? or are you as you use to be, as careless &amp; foolish and disobedient and wicked as ever?</P>
<P N="8">8. Did you never hear of a little Child that died? &amp; if other Children die, why may not you be sick &amp; die? and what will you do then, Child, if you should have no grace in your heart, and be found like other naughty Children.</P>
<P N="9">9 How do you know but that you may be the next Child that may die? and where are you then if you be not God's Child.</P>
<P N="10">10. Wilt thou tarry any longer my dear Child, before thou run into thy Chamber, &amp; beg to God to give thee a Christ for thy Soul, that thou mayst not be undone for ever,? Wilt thou get presently into a corner to weep and pray? Methinks I see that pretty Lamb begin to weep, &amp; think of get∣ting by himself, &amp; will as well as he can cry unto the Lord, to make them one of these little ones that go into the Kingdom of Heaven; Methinks there stands a sweet Child, &amp; there another, that are resolved for Christ &amp; for Heaven: Methinks that little Boy looks as if he had a mind to learn good thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: Methinks I hear one say, Well, I will ne∣ver
<PB REF="000914_0009_0FACA1C667579C08"/>
tell a lye more, I will never keep any naugh∣ty Boy company more, they will teach me to swear, and they will speak naughty words, they do not love God. I'le learn my Catechism, &amp; get my Mother to teach us to pray, and I will go to weep and cry to Christ, and will not be quiet till the Lord hath given me Grace. O that's my brave Child indeed!</P>
<P N="11">11. But will you not quickly forget your promise? are you resolved by the strength of Christ to be a good Child? Are you indeed? nay, but are you indeed? Consider, dear Child, God calls you to remember your Creator in the days of your youth; &amp; he takes it kindly when little ones comes to him, and loves them dearly; and godly people, especially Parents, &amp; Masters and Mistresses, they have no greater joy, than to see their Children walk in the way of truth.</P>
<P>Now tell me, my pretty dear Child, what will you do? shall I make you a Book? shall I pray for you, and entreat you? Shall your good Mother weep over you? And will not you make us all glad, by your turning quickly to the Lord? Shall Christ tell you that he will love you? And will not you love him? Will you strive to be like those Children? I am per∣swaded, that God intends to do good to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouls of some little Children by these papers, be∣cause he hath laid it so much upon my heart to pray for them and over these papers, &amp; through
<PB REF="000914_0010_0FACA1C720F397B8"/>
mercy I have already experienced, that something of this nature hath not been in vain. I shall give a word of direction, and so leave you.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of what you know is naught; as lying, O that is a grievous fault indeed, and naughty words, and taking the Lords name in vain, and playing upon the Lords day, &amp; keep∣ing bad company, and playing with ungodly Children: But if you go to School with such, tell them that God will not love them, but that the Devil will have them, if they continue to be so naught.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do what your Father and Mother bids you, chearfully; and take heed of doing any thing that they forbid you.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be diligent in reading the Scripture, and learning your Catechism; and what you do not understand, to be sure ask the meaning of.</P>
<P N="4">4. Think a little sometimes by your self about God and Heaven, and your Soul, and what Christ came into the world for.</P>
<P N="5">5. And if you have no great mind to do thus, but had rather be at play, then think, what is it that makes me that I do not care for good things is this like one of God's dear Children? I am a∣fraid I am none of God's Child, I feel, I do not love to come unto him: O! What shall I do? Either I will be Gods Child or the Devils; O what shall I do? I would not be the Devils Child for any thing in the World.</P>
<P N="6"><PB REF="000914_0011_0FACA1C7E6AD7D40"/>6. Then go to your Father or Mother, or some Good Body, and ask them what thou shalt do to be God's Child; and tell them that thou art afraid, and that thou canst not be contented, till thou hast got the love of God.</P>
<P N="7">7. Get by thy self, into the Chamber or Gar∣ret, and fall upon thy knees, and weep and mourn, and tell Christ thou art afraid that he doth not love thee, but thou would fain have his love; beg of him to give thee his Grace and pardon for thy sins, and that he would make thee his Child: Tell God thou dost not care who don't love thee, if God will but love thee: Say to him, Father, hast thou not a bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing for me thy poor little Child? Father, hast thou not a blessing for me, even for me? O give a Christ! O give me a Christ! O let me not be undone for ever! Thus beg, as for your lives, and be not contented till you have an answer; and do thus every day, with as much earnestness as you can, twice a day at least.</P>
<P N="8">8. Give your self up to Christ: say, dear Jesus, thou didst bid that little Childr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n should be suf∣fered to come unto thee; and Lord, I am come as well as I can, would fain be thy Child: take my heart and make it humble, and meek, and sensible and obedient, I give my self un∣to thee dear Jesus, do what thou wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with me, so that thou wilt but love me, and give me thy Grace and Glory.</P>
<P N="9"><PB REF="000914_0012_0FACA1C8A7EECF10"/>9. Get acquainted with Godly people and ask them good questions, and endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to love their talk▪</P>
<P N="10">10. Labour to get a dear love for Christ▪ read the History of Christ's sufferings: and ask the reason of his sufferings, and never b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> content till you see your need of Christ, and the excellency and use of Christ.</P>
<P N="11">11. Hear the most powerful Ministers; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> read the most searching books and get you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Father to buy you Mr. <HI>White's</HI> Book fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little Children, and <HI>A Guide to Heaven.</HI></P>

Resolve to continue in well-doing all you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> days; then thou shalt be one of those swee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little ones that Christ will take into his arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and bless, and give a Kingdom, Crown and Glory too. And now dear Children I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done, I have written to you, I have prayed for you; but what you will do I can't tell▪ O Children, if you love me, if you lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Parents, if you love your Souls, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you would scape Hell Fire, and if you would live in Heaven when you die, do you go and do as these good Children, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you may be your Parents joy, your Countrey honour, and live in Gods fear, and die i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his love▪ is the prayer of your dear Friend,</P>

<HEAD>EXAMPLE I. Of one eminently Converted between Eight and Nine years Old, with an account of her Life and Death.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. <HI>Sarah Howley,</HI> when she was between Eight and Nine years Old, was carried by her Friends to hear a Sermon, where the Minister Preached upon Matt. 11.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. <HI>My Yoke is easy, and my Burden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s

light:</HI> in the applying of which Scripture, this Child was mightily awakned, and made deeply sensible of the Condition of her Soul, and her need of a Christ,? she wept bitterly to think what a case she was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and went home and got by her self into a Chamber, and upon her knees she wept and cryed to the Lord, as well as she could, which might easily be perceived by her eyes and countenance</P>
<P N="2">2. She was not contented at this, but she got her little Brother and Sister into a Chamber with her, and told them of their condition by Nature, and wept over them, and prayed with them and for them.</P>
<P N="3">3, After this she heard another Ser∣mon upon <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.1. <HI>He that being often re∣proved, hardneth his heart, shall suddenly be de∣stroyed, &amp; that without remedy</HI>: At which she was more affected than before, and was so exceeding solicitous about her Soul, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he spent a great part of the night in weeping and praying, and could scarce take any rest day or night for some time together; desiring with all her Soul to escape from everlasting flames, and to get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> interest in the Lord Jesus; <HI>O what
<PB N="3" REF="000914_0015_0FACA1CAE35C98D8"/>
should she do for a Christ! what should she do to be Saved!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. She gave her self much to attend∣ing upon the Word preached, and still continued very tender under it, greatly savouring what she heard.</P>
<P N="5">5. She was very much in secret Pray∣er, as might easily be perceived by those who listened at the Chamber door, and was usually very importunate, and full of tears.</P>
<P N="6">6. She could scarce speak of sin, or be spoke to, but her heart was ready to melt.</P>
<P N="7">7. She spent much time in reading the Scripture, and a Book called, <HI>The best friend in the worst of Times</HI>; by which the Work of God was much promoted upon her Soul, and was much directed by it how to get acquaintaince with God, especially toward the end of that Book. Another Book that she was much delighted with, was Mr. <HI>Swinnock</HI>'s <HI>Christian Mans Calling,</HI> and by this she was taught in this measure to make Religion her business. The <HI>Spiritual B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> was a great companion of hers.</P>
<P N="8">8. She was exceeding dutiful to her
<PB N="4" REF="000914_0016_0FACA1CBA2602008"/>
Parents, very loath to grieve them in the least: and if she had at any time (which was very rare) offended them, she would weep bitterly.</P>
<P N="9">9. She abhorred lying, and allowed her self in no known sin.</P>
<P N="10">10. She was very Conscientious in spending of time, and hated Idleness, and spent her whole time either in pray∣ing, reading instructing at her Needle, at which she was very ingenious.</P>
<P N="11">11. When she was at School, she was eminent for her diligence, teachableness, meekness and modesty, speaking little; but when she did speak it was usually spiritual.</P>
<P N="12">12. She continued in this course of Re∣ligious duties for some years together.</P>
<P N="13">13. When she was about fourteen years old, she brake a Vein in her Lungs (as is supposed) and oft did spit blood, yet did a little recover again, but had several dangerous relapses.</P>
<P N="14">14. At the beginning of <HI>January</HI> last, she was taken very bad again, in which sickness she was in great distress of Soul. When she was first taken, she said, O Mother, pray, pray, pray for me, for
<PB N="5" REF="000914_0017_0FACA1CC61AEC1C8"/>
Satan is so busy that I cannot pray for my self; I see I am undone without a Christ, and a Pardon! O I am undone unto all Eternity.</P>
<P N="15">15. Her Mother knowing how serious she had been formerly, did a little wonder that she should be in such agonies; up∣on which her Mother asked her what sin it was, that was so burdensome to her Spirit: O Mother, said she, it is not any particular sin of Omission or Com∣mission, that sticks so close to my Con∣science, as the sin of my Nature; with∣out the Blood of Christ, that will dam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me.</P>
<P N="16">16. Her Mother asked her; what she should pray for, for her; she answered, That I may have a saving knowledge of Sin and Christ: and that I may have an assurance of Gods love to my Soul. Her Mother asked her why she did speak so little to the Minister that came to her? She answered that it was her duty with patience and silence to learn of them: and it was exceeding painful to her, to speak to any.</P>
<P N="17">17. One time when she fell into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, she cried out, <HI>O I am a going, I am a go∣ing:</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="000914_0018_0FACA1CD240924B8"/>
But <HI>what shall I do to be Saved?</HI> Sweet Lord Jesus, I will lye at thy feet; and if I perish, it shall be at the Fountain of thy mercy.</P>
<P N="18">18. She was much afraid of presumpti∣on, and dreaded a mistake in the mat∣ters of her Soul, and would be often putting up ejaculations to God, to deliver her from deceiving her self. To in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance in one: <HI>Great and Mighty God, give me Faith and true Faith, Lord, that I may not be a foolish Virgin, having a Lamp and no Oyl.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. She would many times be laying hold upon the promises, and plead them in prayer. That in <HI>Matt.</HI> 11.28, 29. was much in her tongue, and no small relief to her Spirit. How many times would she cry out, Lord, hast not thou said, <HI>Come unto me all ye that are weary, and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. Another time her Father bid her be of good cheer, because she was going to a better Father; at which she fell into a great passion, and said, but how do I know that? I am a poor sinner that wants assurance <HI>O, for assurance</HI>! It was still her note, <HI>O, for assurance</HI>! This was

her great, earnest, and constant request, to all that came to her, to beg assurance for her; and, poor heart, she would look with so much eagerness upon them, as if she desired nothing in the world so much, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they would pitty her, and help her with their prayers; never was poor creature more earnest for any thing, than she was for an assurance; and the Light of Gods Countenance: O the piteous moan that she would make! O the Agonies that her Soul was in!</P>
<P N="21">21. Her Mother ask'd her, if God would spare her Life, how she would live? Truly Mother, said she, we have such base hearts that I can't tell, we are apt to promise great things when we are sick, but when we are recovered, we are as ready to forget our selves and to turn again unto folly; but I hope I should lie more careful of my Time and my Soul, than I have been.</P>
<P N="22">22. She was full of natural affection to her Parents, and very careful least her Mother should be tired out with much watching: Her Mother said, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>how shall bear parting with thee, when I have scar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dryed my eyes for thy Brother?</HI> she answered, the
<PB N="8" REF="000914_0020_0FACA1CEA32AFDA0"/>
God of love, support and comfort you; it is but a little while, and we shall meet in Glory, I hope. She being very weak, could speak but little, therefore her Mother said, <HI>Child, if thou hast any co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fort, lift up thy hand</HI>; which she did.</P>
<P N="23">23. The Lords day before that, in which she died, a Kinsman of hers came to see her, and asking of her, whether she knew him? She answered, <HI>Yes, I know you, and I desire you would learn to know Christ: you are young, but you know not how soon you may die; and O to die without a Christ, it is a fearful thing: O redeem Time! O Time, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, Time, precious Time!</HI> Being requested by him not to spend herself, she said, she would fain do all the good she could while she lived, and when she was dead too, if possile; upon which account, she de∣sired that a Sermon might be Preached at the Funeral, concerning the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cious∣ness of Time. O that young ones would now remember their Creator!</P>
<P N="24">24. Some Minister that came to her, did with earnestness beg that the Lord would please to give her some token for good, that she might go off triumphing, and Bills of the same nature were sent to several Churches.</P>
<P N="25"><PB N="9" REF="000914_0021_0FACA1CF6412F470"/>25. After she had long waited for an answer of their prayers, she said, <HI>Well, I will venture my Soul upon Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. She carried it with wonderful pa∣tience, and yet would often pray that the Lord would give her more patience, which the Lord answered to astonish∣ment; for considering the pains and agonies that she was in, her patience was next to a wonder; <HI>Lord, Lord, give me patience,</HI> said she, <HI>that I may not dishonour thee.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. Upon <HI>Thursday,</HI> after long wait∣ing, great Fears, and many Prayers, when all her Friends thought she had been past speaking, to the astonishment of her Friends, she broke forth thus with a very Audible Voice, and Cheerful Countenance; <HI>Lord, thou hast promised, that whosoever comes unto thee, thou wilt in no wise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast out; Lord I come unto thee, and surely thou wilt not cast me out. O so sweet! O so glorious is Jesus! O I have the sweet and glorious Jesus; he is sweet, he is sweet, he is sweet! O the admirable love of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n sending Christ! O free Grace to a poor lost Creature.</HI> And thus she ran on repeating many of these things an hundred times
<PB N="10" REF="000914_0022_0FACA1D021AC3D40"/>
over; but her Friends were so astonished to see her in this Divine Rapture, and to hear such Gracious Words, and her Prayers and Desires satisfied, that they could not write a quarter of what she spoke.</P>
<P N="28">28. When her Soul was thus ravished with the love of Christ, and her tongue so highly engaged in the magnifying of God; her Father, Brethren, and Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters, with others of the Family, were called, to whom she spake particularly, as her strength would give leave. She gave her Bible as a Legacy to one of her Brothers, and desired him to use that well for her sake, &amp; added, to him &amp; the rest, O make use of time to get a Christ for your Souls; spend no time in running up and down in playing: O get a Christ for your Souls while you are young; re∣member now your Creator before you come to a sick bed: put not off this great work till then, for then you will find it a hard work indeed. I know by expe∣rience, the Devil will tell you it is time enough; and you are young, what need you to be in such hast? You will have time enough when you are old. But
<PB N="11" REF="000914_0023_0FACA1D0E5466F48"/>
there stands one (meaning her Grand∣mother) that stayes behind, and I that am but young, am going before her. O therefore make your Calling and Election sure, while you are in health. But I am afraid this will be but one nights trouble to your thoughts; but remember, these are the words of a dying Sister. O if you knew how good Christ were! O if you had but one taste of his sweetness, you would rather go to him a thousand times than stay in this wicked world. I would not for ten thousand, and ten thousand worlds part with my interest in Christ. O how happy am I, that I am going to everlasting Joys! I would not go back again for twenty thousand worlds; and will you not strive to get an Interest in Christ?</P>
<P N="29">29. After this, looking upon one of her Fathers Servants, she said, <HI>What shall I do? What shall I do at the great Day,</HI> when Christ shall say to me, <HI>Come, thou Blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for thee.</HI> And shall say to the wicked, <HI>Go, thou Cursed into the Lake that burns for ever.</HI> What a grief is it for me to think, that I shall see any of my friends
<PB N="12" REF="000914_0024_0FACA1D1A2AEA598"/>
that I knew upon Earth, turned into that Lake that burns forever! O that word, <HI>For Ever,</HI> remember that, <HI>For Ever!</HI> I speak these words to you, but they are nothing, except God speak to you too: O pray, pray, pray, that God would give you Grace! And then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prayed, <HI>O Lord finish thy work upon their Souls.</HI> It will be my comfort to see you in Glory, but it will be your Everlasting happiness.</P>
<P N="30">30. Her Grand-mother told her she spent her self too much; he said; I care not for that, if I could do any Soul good. O with what vehemency did she speak, as if her heart were in every word she spoke.</P>
<P N="31">31. She was full of Divine Sentences, and almost all her discourse, fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the last, in the time of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick∣ness, was about her Soul, Christs sweet∣ness, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouls of others; in a word, like a continued Sermon.</P>
<P N="32">32. Upon <HI>Fryday,</HI> after she had had such lively discoveries of Gods love, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he was exceeding desirous to dye, and cryed out, <HI>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly, conduct me to thy Tabernacle, I am a poor Creature without thee: but Lord Jesus, my Soul longs
<PB N="13" REF="000914_0025_0FACA1D262F3D0A0"/>
to be with thee: O when shall it be! Why not now, dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jesus? Come Lord Jesus, come quickly</HI>; but why do I speak thus? <HI>Thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me, dear Lord, is the best; O give me pa∣tience!</HI></P>
<P N="33">33. Upon <HI>Saturday</HI> she spoke very little (being very drowsie) yet now and then dropt these words: <HI>How long sweet J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus? Finish thy work sweet Jesus, Come away sweet dear Lord Jesus, come quickly,; sweet Lord help, come away, now, now, dear Jesus come quickly; Good Lord give patience to me to wait thy appointed time; Lord Jesus help me, help me, help me.</HI> Thus at several times (when out of her sleep) for she was asleep the greatest part of the day.</P>
<P N="34">34. Upon the Lord's day, she scarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spoke any thing, but much desired that Bills of thanksgiving might be sent to those who had formerly been praying for her, that they might help her to praise God for that full assurance that he had given her of His love; and seemed to be much swallowed up with the thoughts of Gods free love to her Soul. She oft commended her Spirit into the Lords hands; and the last words which she was heard to speak, were these, <HI>Lord help,
<PB N="14" REF="000914_0026_0FACA1D326206040"/>
Lord Jesus help; Dear Jesus, Blessed Jesus</HI>— And thus upon the Lords Day, between Nine and Ten of the Clock in the fore∣noon, she slept sweetly in Jesus, and began an Everlasting Sabbath, <HI>February</HI> 19. 1670.</P>

<HEAD>EXAMPLE II. Of a Child that was admirably affected with the things of God, when he was between Two and Three years Old; with a brief ac∣count of his Life and Death.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Certain little Child, whose Mother had dedicated him to the Lord in her womb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when he could not speak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, would be crying after God, and was greatly desirous to be taught good things.</P>
<P N="2">2. He could not endure to be put to Bed without Family duty, but would put his Parents upon duty, and would with much devotion kneel down, &amp; with great patience and delight, continue till duty was at an end, without the least expres∣sion of being weary; and he seemed
<PB N="15" REF="000914_0027_0FACA1D3E5019260"/>
never so well pleased, as when he was engaged in duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. He could not be satisfied with Fa∣mily duty, but he would be oft upon his knees by himself in one corner or other.</P>
<P N="4">4. He was much delighted in hearing the Word of God, either Read or Preach∣ed.</P>
<P N="5">5. He loved to go to School, that he might learn something of God and would observe and take great notice of what he had read, and come home and speak of it with much affection; and he would rejoyce in his book, and say to his Mother, O Mother! I have had a sweet lesson to day, will you please to give me leave to fetch my book that you may hear it?</P>
<P N="6">6. As he grew up, he was more and more affected with the things of another world; so that if we had not received ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> information from one that is of undoubted fidelity, it would seem incredible.</P>
<P N="7">7. He quickly learned to read the Scripture, and would, with great Re∣verence, Tenderness and Groans, read till tears and sobs were ready to hinder him.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="16" REF="000914_0028_0FACA219A19E6648"/>8. When he was at secret prayer, he would weep bitterly.</P>
<P N="9">9. He was wont oftentimes to com∣plain of the naughtiness of his heart, and seemed to be more grieved for the Cor∣ruption of his Nature, than for Actual Sin.</P>
<P N="10">10. He had a vast Understanding in the things of God, even next to a wonder, for one of his age.</P>
<P N="11">11. He was much troubled for the wandring of his thoughts in duty, and that he could not keep his heart alway fixed upon God, and the work he was about, and his affections constantly raised.</P>
<P N="12">12. He kept a watch over his heart, and observed the workings of his Soul, and would complain that they were so vain and fooli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, and so little busied about Spi∣ritual things.</P>
<P N="13">13. As he grew up, he grew daily in knowledge and experience, and his carriage was so heavenly, and his discourse so ex∣cellent and experimental, that it made those which heard it, even astonished.</P>
<P N="14">14. He was exceeding importunate with God in duty,; and would plead with God at a strange rate, and use such ar∣guments
<PB N="17" REF="000914_0029_0FACA21A64FBF4E0"/>
in prayer, that one would think it were impossible should ever enter into the heart of a Child; he would beg, and expostulate, and weep so, that sometimes it could not be kept from the ears of Neighbours; so that one of the next house was forced to cry out, The prayers and tears of that Child in the next house will sink me to Hell, because by it he did con∣demn his neglect of prayer, and his slight performance of it.</P>
<P N="15">15. He was very fearful of wicked company, and would oft beg of God to keep him from it, and that he might never be pleased in them that took delight in displeasing of God: And when he was at any time in the hearing of their wicked words, taking the Lords Name in vain, or Swearing, or any filthy words, it would even make him tremble, and ready to go home and weep.</P>
<P N="16">16. He abhorred lying, with his Soul.</P>
<P N="17">17. When he had committed any fault, he was easily convinced of it, and would get in some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and secret place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with tears beg pardon of God, &amp; strength against such a sin. He had a friend that oft watched him, and listned at his Cham∣ber-door,
<PB N="18" REF="000914_0030_0FACA21B22C0CA20"/>
from whom I received this Narrative.</P>
<P N="18">18. When he had been asked, whether he would commit such a sin again, he would never promise absolutely, because he said his heart was naught; but he would weep and say, he hoped by the Grace of God he should not.</P>
<P N="19">19. When he was left at home alone up∣on the Sabbath days, he would besure not to spend any part of the day in Idleness &amp; Play, but be busied in praying, reading in the Bible, and getting of his Catechism.</P>
<P N="20">20. When other Children were playing, he would many a time and oft be praying.</P>
<P N="21">21. One day a certain person was dis∣coursing with him, about the Nature, Offi∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Excellency of Christ, and that He alone can satisfie for our Sins, and merit Everlas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing life for us; and about other of the great Mysteries of Redemp∣tion: he seemed savingly to understand them, &amp; was greatly delighted with the dis∣course.</P>
<P N="22">22. One speaking concerning the Re∣surrection of the body, he did acknow∣ledge it; but that the same weak body that was buried in the Church-yard, should be raised again, he thought very strange, but
<PB N="19" REF="000914_0031_0FACA21BEBAD3E70"/>
with admiration yielded, that nothing was impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ble to God; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very day he was taken sick unto death.</P>
<P N="23">23. A Friend of his asked him whether he were willing to dye, when he was first taken sick; he answered, <HI>No; because he was afraid of his state as to another world:</HI> Why Child, said the other, thou didst pray for a new Heart, for an humble, and sin∣cere Heart, and I have heard thee; didst thou not pray with thy heart? <HI>I hope I did,</HI> said he.</P>
<P N="24">24. Not long after, the same person asked him again, whether he were willing to dye? He answered, <HI>Now I am willing, for I shall go to Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="25">25. One asked him what should be∣come of his Sister, if he should dye and leave her? He answered, <HI>The Will of the Lord must be done.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. He still grew weaker and weaker, but carried it with a great deal of sweet∣ness and patience, waiting for his change, and at la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t did cheerfully commit his Spirit unto the Lord; and calling upon the Name of the Lord, and saying, <HI>Lord Je∣sus, Lord Jesus,</HI>— in whose bosome, he sweetly slept, Dying as I remember, when he was about Five or Six years old.</P>

<HEAD>EXAMPLE III. Of a little Girl that was wrought upon, when she was between Four and Five years Old, with some account of her holy Life and triumphant Death,</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>MAry A.</HI> When she was between Four and Five years old, was greatly affected in hearing the Word of God, and became very solicitous about her Soul, and everlasting Condition, weep∣ing bitterly, to think what would become of her in another World, asking strange Questions concerning God and Christ, and her own Soul. So that this little <HI>Mary,</HI> before she was full five years old, seemed to mind <HI>The one thing needful,</HI> and to choose <HI>The better part,</HI> and sate at the <HI>Feet of Christ</HI> many a time, and oft with Tears.</P>
<P N="2">2. She was wont to be much in secret Duty, and many times come off from her knees with Tears.</P>
<P N="3">3. She wou'd chuse such times &amp; places for secret Duty, as might render her less observed by others, and did endeavour
<PB N="21" REF="000914_0033_0FACA21D64B19DA0"/>
what possibly she could to conceal what she was doing, when she was engaged in secret Duty.</P>
<P N="4">4. She was greatly afraid of Hypocrisie, and of doing any thing to be seen of men, and to get commendation and praise; and when she had heard one of her Brothers saying, <HI>That he had been by himself at prayer,</HI> she rebuked him sharply, and told him how little such prayers were like to profit him, and that was little to his praise, to pray like a Hypocrite, and to be glad that any should know what he had been doing.</P>
<P N="5">5. Her Mother being full of sorrow af∣ter the Death of her Husband, this Child came to her Mother, and ask'd her why she wept so exceedingly? Her Mother an∣swered, She had cause enough to weep, be∣cause her Father was dead: <HI>No dear Mother, said the Child, you have no cause to weep so much; for God is a Good God still to you.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. She was a dear lover of faithful Ministers. One time after, she had been hearing of Mr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> she said, I love that man dearly, for the sweet words that he speaks concerning Christ.</P>
<P N="7">7. Her Book was her delight, and what she did read, she loved to make her own,
<PB N="22" REF="000914_0034_0FACA21E234C4140"/>
and cared not for passing over what she learned, without extraordinary observati∣on and understanding; and many times she was so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rangely affected in reading of the Scriptures, that she would burst out into Tears, and would hardly be pacified▪ so greatly was she ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en with Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Suf∣ferings, the zeal of Gods Servants, the danger of a Natural State.</P>
<P N="8">8. She would complain oftentimes of the corruption of her Nature, of the hardness of her Heart, that she could Repent no more throughly, and be no more Humble and Grieved for her Sins against a good God; and when she did thus complain▪ it was with abundance of Tears.</P>
<P N="9">9. She was greatly concerned for the Souls of others, and grieved to think o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the miserable Condition that they were in upon this account; when she could handsomely, she would be putting in some pretty sweet word of Christ; but above all, she would do what she could to draw the hearts of her Brethren and Sisters after Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and there was no small hopes▪ that her example and good Counsel did prevail with some of them when they were very young, to get into corners to
<PB N="23" REF="000914_0035_0FACA21EE2DF0C38"/>
pray, &amp; to ask very gracious Questions a∣bout the things of God.</P>
<P N="10">10. She was very Conscientious in keep∣ing the Sabbath, spending the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le time either in Reading or Praying, or learning her Catechism, or teaching her Brethren and Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers. One time when she was left at home upon the Lords Day, she got some other little Children to∣gether, with her Brothers and Sisters, and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ead of Playing (as other naughty Children use to do) she told them, That that was the Lords Day, and that they ought to remember that Day to keep it holy; and then she told them, how it was to be spent in Religious Exercises all the day long, except so much as was to be taken up in the Works of necessity and mercy; then she prayed with them her self, and among other things begged, that the Lord would give Grace and Wisdom to them little Children, That they might know how to serve him, as one of the little ones in the company with her, told after∣wards.</P>
<P N="11">11. She was a Child of a strange ten∣derness and compassion to all, full of bowels and pity: whom she could not help, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he
<PB N="24" REF="000914_0036_0FACA21FA5329D10"/>
would be ready to weep over; especially if she saw her Mother at any time troubled▪ she would quickly make her sorrows he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own, and weep for her, and with her.</P>
<P N="12">12. When her Mother had been some∣what solicitous about any worldly thing, she would, if she could possibly, put her off from her care one way or other. One time she told her, <HI>O Mother, Grace is better than that,</HI> (meaning something her Mother wanted,) <HI>I had rather have Grace and the Love of Christ, than any thing in the world.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. This Child was often musing and busied in the thoughts of her Everlasting Work; witness that strange question, <HI>O what are they doing, which are already i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heaven?</HI> And she seemed to be hugely desirous to be among them that were praising, loving, delighting in God, and serving of Him without Sin. Her Language was so strange about Spiritual matters, that she made many excellent Christians to stand amazed, as judging it scarce to be parallell'd.</P>
<P N="14">14. She took great Delight in reading of the Scripture, and some part of it was more sweet to her than her appointed food; she would get several choice Scrip∣tures
<PB N="25" REF="000914_0037_0FACA22063E70658"/>
by heart, and discourse of them savour∣ly, and apply them suitably.</P>
<P N="15">15. She was not altogether a stranger to other good Books, but would be reading of them with much affection; and where she might, she noted the Books parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ularly, observing what in the reading did most warm her heart, and she was ready upon occasion to improve it.</P>
<P N="16">16. One time a woman coming into the House in a great Passion, spoke of her Condition, as if none were like hers, and it would never be otherwise; the Child said, it were a strange thing to say when it is night, it will never be day again.</P>
<P N="17">17. At another time a near Relation of hers being in some streights made some complaint, to whom she said, I have heard Mr. <HI>Carter</HI> say a Man may go to heaven without a Penny in his Purse, but not with∣out Grace in his Heart.</P>
<P N="18">18. She had an extraordinary Love to the People of God; and when she saw any that she thought feared the Lord, her Heart would e'en leap for joy.</P>
<P N="19">19. She loved to be much by her self, &amp; would be greatly grieved if she were at any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime deprived of a conveniency for secret
<PB N="26" REF="000914_0038_0FACA2212ADD82C0"/>
Duty; she could not live without constant Address to God in secret; and was not a little pleased when she could go into a corner to pray and weep.</P>
<P N="20">20. She was much in praising God, &amp; seldom or never complained of any thing but Sin.</P>
<P N="21">21. She continued in this course of praying and praising of God, and great du∣tifulness and sweetness to her Parents, and those that taught her any thing, yet she did greatly encourage her Mother while she was a Widow, and desired that the ab∣sence of a Husband, might in some mea∣sure be made up by the dutifulness and holiness of a Child. She studied all the wayes that could be to make her Mothers Life sweet.</P>
<P N="22">22. When she was between eleven and twelve years old, she sickned, in which she carried it with admirable patience and sweetness, and did what she could with Scripture Arguments, to support and en∣courage her Relations to part with her, that was going to Glory, and to prepare themselves to meet her in a Blessed Eter∣nity.</P>
<P N="23">23. She was not many days sick before
<PB N="27" REF="000914_0039_0FACA221E7AB0398"/>
she was marked; which she first saw her self, and was greatly rejoyced to think that she was marked out for the Lord, and was now going apace to Christ. She called to her Friends, and said, <HI>I am marked, but be not troubled, for I know I am marked for one of the Lords own.</HI> One asked her, How she knew that? She answered, <HI>The Lord hath told me, that I am one of His dear Chil∣dren.</HI> And thus she spake with a holy Confidence in the Lords Love to her Soul, and was not in the least daunted when she spake of her death; but seemed greatly delighted in the apprehension of her near∣ness to her Fathers House. And it was not long before she was filled with joy unspeak∣able in believing.</P>
<P N="24">24. When she just lay a Dying, her Mother came to her, and told her, She was sorry that she had reproved and cor∣rected so good a Child so oft.

<P N="26">26. A little before she died, she had a great conflict with Satan, and Cryed out, <HI>I am none of his</HI>; her Mother seeing her in trouble, asked her what was the matter?

<HEAD>EXAMPLE IV. Of a Child that began to look towards Heaven, when she was about Four years old, with some observable Passages in her Life, and at her Death.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Certain little Child, when she was about Four years old, had a Con∣scientious sence of her Duty towards her Parents, because the Commandment saith, <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</HI> And though she had little advantage of Educati∣on, she carried it with the greatest Reve∣rence to her Parents imaginable, so that she was no small Credit, as well as Comfort to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was no usual thing for her to weep, if she saw her Parents troubled, though her self had not been the occasion of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. When she came from school, she would with grief and abhorrency say, that other Children had sinned against God by speaking grievous words, which were so bad, that she durst not speak them again.</P>
<P N="4">4. She would be oftentimes admiring of Gods mercy, for so much goodness to
<PB N="30" REF="000914_0042_0FACA22422E4B570"/>
her rather than to others; that she saw some begging, others blind, some crooked, and that she wanted nothing that was good for her.</P>
<P N="5">5. She was many a time, and often, in one hole or another, in Tears upon her knees.</P>
<P N="6">6. This poor little thing would be ready to counsel other little Children, how they ought to serve God; and putting them upon getting by themselves to pray; &amp; hath been known when her friends have been abroad, to have been teaching Chil∣dren to pray, especially upon the Lords Day.</P>
<P N="7">7. She very seriously begged the pray∣ers of others, that they would remember her, that the Lord would give her Grace.</P>
<P N="8">8. When this Child saw some that were laughing, who she judged to be very wick∣ed; <HI>She told them, that she feared that they had little reason to be merry.</HI> They asked whether one might not laugh? She an∣swered, <HI>No indeed, till you have Grace; they who are wicked, have more need to Cry, than to Laugh.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. She would say, that it was the Duty of Parents, Masters and Mistresses, to re∣prove
<PB N="31" REF="000914_0043_0FACA22FF7617998"/>
(those under their charge) for sin, or else God will meet with them.</P>
<P N="10">10. She would be very attentive when she read the Scriptures, and be much affect∣ed with them.</P>
<P N="11">11. She would by no means be perswa∣ded to prophane the Lords Day, but would spend it in some good Duties.</P>
<P N="12">12. When she went to School, it was willingly and joyfully, and she was very teachable &amp; exemplary to other Children.</P>
<P N="13">13. When she was taken sick, one asked her <HI>Whether she were willing to Dye?</HI> She an∣swered, <HI>Yes, if God would Pardon her Sins.</HI> Being asked how her Sins should be Par∣doned? She answerd, <HI>Through the Blood of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>She said; she did believe in Christ, &amp; desired, and longed to be with Him,</HI> and did with a great deal of chearfulness give up her Soul.</P>
<P>There were very many observable Pas∣sages, in the Life &amp; Death of this Child, but the hurry and grief that her Friends were in, buried them.</P>

<P N="7">7. He would be much in reading the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P N="8">8. He was desirous of more Spiritual knowledge, and would be oft asking very serious &amp; admirable Questions.</P>
<P N="9">9. He would not stir out of doors before he had poured out his Soul to the Lord.</P>
<P N="10">10. When he eat any thing, he would be sure to lift up his Heart unto the Lord for a Blessing upon it; and when he had moderately refreshed himself by eating, he would not forget to acknowledge Gods goodness in feeding of him.</P>
<P N="11">11. He would not lye down in his Bed, till he had been upon his knees; and when sometimes he had forgotten his Duty, he would quickly get out of his Bed, and kneeling down upon his bare knees, cover∣ed with no Garment but his linnings, ask God forgiveness for that sin.</P>
<P N="12">12. He would rebuke his Brethren if they were at any time too hasty at their Meals, and did eat without asking a Blessing; his che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k was usually this; <HI>Dare you do thus?

<P N="15">15. When he was sick, he seemed much taken up with Heaven, and asked very se∣rious Questions about the Nature of his Soul.</P>
<P N="16">16.

<HEAD>EXAMPLE VI. Of a poor Child that was awakened when she was about Five years Old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Certain very poor Child, that had a very bad Father, but it was to be hoped a very good Mother, was by the Providence of God, brought to the sight of a Godly Friend of mine, who upon the first sight of the Child, had a great pitty for him, and took an affection to him, &amp; had a mind to bring him up for Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. At the first, he did with great sweet∣ness and kindness allure the Child, by which means it was not long before he got a deep interest in the Heart of the Child, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d he began to obey him with more readiness than Children usually to their Parents.</P>
<P N="3">3. By this a Door was opened for a farther Work, &amp; he had a greater advan∣tage to instil Spiritual principles into the Soul of the Child, which he was not want∣ing in, as the Lord gave opportunity, and the Child was capable of.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was not long before the Lord was
<PB N="38" REF="000914_0050_0FACA233E474A828"/>
pleased to strike in with the Spiritual Ex∣hortations of this good Man, so that the Child was brought to a liking to the things of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. He quickly learnt a great part of the Assemblies Catechism by heart, and that before he could read his Primer with∣in Book; and he took a great delight in learning his Catechism.</P>
<P N="6">6. He was not only able to give a very good account of his Catechism, but he would answer such Questions as are not in the Catechism, with greater understanding than could be expected of one of his Age.</P>
<P N="7">7. He took great delight in discoursing about the things of God; and when my Friend had been either praying or reading, expounding or repeating Sermons, he seem∣ed very attentive, and ready to receive the truths of God, and would with in∣credible gravity, diligence and affection, wait till duties were ended, to the no small joy and admiration of them which observed him.</P>
<P N="8">8. He would ask very excellent questi∣ons, and discourse about the condition of his Soul and Heavenly things, and seemed mightily concerned what should
<PB N="39" REF="000914_0051_0FACA234A55C4CF0"/>
become of his Soul when he should dye: so that his discourse made some Christians eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to stand astonished.</P>
<P N="9">9▪ He was greatly taken with the great kind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of Christ in dying for sinners, and and would be in tears at the mention of them: and seemed at a strange rate to be affected with the unspeakable <HI>Love</HI> of Christ.</P>
<P N="10">10. When no body hath been speaking to him, he would burst out into tears, and being asked the reason, he would say, that the very thoughts of Christs love to sinners in suffering for them, made him that he could not but Cry.</P>
<P N="11">11. Before he was Six years old, he made Conscience of a secret <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and when he prayed, it was with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ra∣ordinary meltings, that his eyes have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d and sore, with weeping by himself for his sin.</P>
<P N="12">12. He would be putting of Christians upon Spiritual discourse when he saw them, and seemed little satisfied, unless they were talking of good things.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is evident, that this poor Childs thoughts were very much busied about the things of another World, for he would of∣tentimes be speaking to his Bed-fellow a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="40" REF="000914_0052_0FACA23568795400"/>
mid-night, about the matter of his Soul; and when he could not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep, he would take Heavenly conference to be sweeter than his appointed rest. This was his usu∣al custome, and thus he would provoke and put forward an experienced Christian, to spend waking hours in talk of God and the everlasting rest.</P>
<P N="14">14. Not long after this, his good Mother dyed, which went very near his heart, for he greatly honoured his Mother.</P>
<P N="15">15. After the Death of his Mother, he would often repeat some of the Promises that are made to Fatherless Children, espe∣cially that in Exod. 22.22. <HI>Ye shall not affect any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or the Fatherless Child; if thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in any wise, and they Cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their Cry</HI>— These words he would often repeat with tears, and say, <HI>I am Fatherless and Mother∣less upon Earth, yet if any wrong me, I have a Father in Heaven who will take my part; to Him I commit my self, and in Him is all my trust.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. Thus he continued in a course of Holy Duties, living in the fear of God, &amp; shewed wonderful Grace for a Child, &amp; died sweetly in the Faith of Jesus.</P>

<HEAD>EXAMPLE VII. Of a Notorious Wicked Child, who was taken up from Begging, and admirably Convert∣ed; with an account of his holy Life and joyful Death, when he was Nine years Old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Very poor Child, of the Parish of <HI>Newington-But<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> came begging to the door of a dear Christian Friend of mine, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a very lamentable case, so filthy and nasty, that he would even have turned ones stomack to have looked on him: But it pleased God to raise in the heart of my Friend, a great pitty &amp; tenderness toward▪ this poor Child, so that in Charity he took him out of the streets, whose Parents were un∣known, who had nothing at all in him to
<PB N="42" REF="000914_0054_0FACA236EA4044D8"/>
commend him to any ones Charity, but his misery. My Friend eyeing the Glory of God, and the good of the Immortal Soul of this wretched Creature, discharged the Parish of the Child, and took him as his own, designing to bring him up for the Lord Christ. A Noble piece of Charity▪ And that which did make the kindness far the greater, was, that there seemed to be very little hopes of doing any good upon this Child, for he was a very Monster of wickedness, and a thousand times more miserable and vile by his Sin, than by his Poverty. He was running to Hell as soon as he could go, and was old in naughti∣ness when he was young in years; and one shall scarce hear of one so like the Devil in his Infancy, as this poor Child was. What Sin was there (that his age was ca∣pable of) that he did not commit? What by the Corruption of his Nature, and the abominable Example of little Begger-boys, he was arrived to a strange pitch of Im∣piety. He would call filthy Names, take Gods Name in vain, Curse and Swear, and do almost all kind of Mischief; and as to any thing of God, worse than an Heathen.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="43" REF="000914_0055_0FACA237A528C1A0"/>2. But this Sin and Misery was but a stronger Motive to that Gracious man to pity him, &amp; to do all that possibly he could to pluck this Fire-brand out of the Fire, &amp; it was not long before the Lord was pleased to let him understand, that He had a design of everlasting kindness upon the Soul of this poor Child; for no sooner had this good Man taken this Creature into his house, but he prays for him, and labours with all his might to convince him of his miserable condition by Nature, and to teach him something of God, the worth of his own Soul, and that Eternity of Glory or Misery that he was born to: And Blessed be Free Grace, it was not long before the Lord was pleased to let him understand, that it was Himself which put it into his heart to take in this Child, that he might bring him up for Christ. The Lord soon struck in with his Godly Instructions, so that an amazing Change was seen in the Child, in a few weeks space he was soon convinced of the evil of his ways; no more News now of his calling of Names, Swear∣ing, or Cursing; no more taking of the Lords Name in vain; now he is civil and respective; and such a strange alteration
<PB N="44" REF="000914_0056_0FACA238633780C0"/>
was wrought in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that all the Parish that r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before, was now rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to talk of his Ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmation; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> company, his talk, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mployment is now changed, and he is like another Creature; so that the Glory of Gods Free Grace began already to shine in him.</P>
<P N="3">3. And this Change was not only an external one, and to be discerned abroad, but he would get by himself, and weep and mourn bitterly, for his horrible wicked life, as might easily be perceived by them that lived in the house with him.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was the great care of his Godly master, to strike in with those Convictions which the Lord had made, and to improve them all he could; and he was not a little glad to see that his labour was not in vain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord; he still experiences that the Lord doth carry on his own work mighti∣ly on the heart of the Child; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> still more and more broken under a sence of his undone state by Nature; he is oft in tears, and bemoaning his lost and miserable Con∣dition. When his Master did speak of the things of God, he listned earnestly, and took in with much greediness and affection what he was taught Seldom was there
<PB N="45" REF="000914_0057_0FACA2392308DB58"/>
any discourse about Soul-matters in his hearing, but he heard it as if it were for his life, and would weep greatly.</P>
<P N="5">5. He would after his Master had been speaking to him, or others, of the things of God, go to him, and question with him about them, and beg of him to instruct &amp; teach him further, and to tell him those things again, that he might remember and understand them better.</P>
<P N="6">6. Thus he continued seeking after the knowledge of God and Christ, and practi∣sing holy Duties, till the sickness came into the house, with which the Child was smit∣ten; at his first sickning, the poor Child was greatly amazed and afraid, and though his pains were great, and the distemper very tedious, yet the fence of his sin, and the thought of the miserable condition that he feared his Soul was still in, made his trouble ten times greater; he was in grievous agonies of Spirit, and his former sins s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ared him in the face, and made him tremble; the poyson of Gods Arrows did even drink up his Spirits; the sence of Sin and Wrath was so great, that he could not tell what in the world to do; the weight of Gods Displeasure, and the thoughts of
<PB N="46" REF="000914_0058_0FACA239E670AED8"/>
lying under it to all Eternity, did ever break him to pieces, and he did Cry ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very bitterly, <HI>What should he do? He was a miserable Sinner, and he feared that he should go to Hell; his Sins had been so great and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many, that there was no hopes for him.</HI> He was not by far so much concerned for his Life, as for his Soul, what should become of that forever. Now the plague upon hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Body seemed nothing to that which was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Soul.</P>
<P N="7">7. But in this great Distress the Lord was pleased to send one to take care fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Soul, who urged to him the great and precious Promises which were made to on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his condition, telling him that there was enough in Christ for the Chiefest of Sinners▪ and that He came to seek and save such a lost Creature as he was. But this poor Child found it a very difficult thing for him to believe that there was any mercy for such a Dreadful Sinner as he had been</P>
<P N="8">8. He was made to Cry out of himself, not only for his Swearing and Lying, and other outwardly notorious Sins; but he was in great Horrour for the Sin of his Na∣ture, for the Vileness of his Heart, and O∣riginal
<PB N="47" REF="000914_0059_0FACA23AA3A4E4A8"/>
Corruption; under it he was in so great anguish, that the trouble of his Spirit, made him in a great measure to forget the pains of his body.</P>
<P N="9">9. He did very particularly confess and bewail his sins with tears; and some sins so secret, that none in the world could charge him with.</P>
<P N="10">10. He would Condemn himself for sin, as deserving to have no Mercy, &amp; thought that there was not a greater Sinner in all <HI>London</HI> than himself, and he abhorred himself as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he vilest creature he knew.</P>
<P N="11">11. He did not only pray much with strong Cryes and Tears himself, but he begged the prayers of Christians for him.</P>
<P N="12">12. He would ask Christians, whether they thought there were any hopes for him, and would beg of them to deal plainly with him, for he was greatly afraid of being d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ceived.</P>

But at last, it pleased the Lord to give him some small hopes that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might be Mercy for him▪ for he had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Chiefest of Sinners; and he was mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to lay a little hold upon such promises, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that, <HI>Come unto me, all ye that are weary an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heaven laden, and I will give you rest.</HI> Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> O! how did this <HI>poor B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> admire and Ble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> God for the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st <HI>Hopes</HI>!

<P N="15">15. The Child grew exceedingly i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Knowledge, Experiences, Patience, Humility</HI> and <HI>Self-abhorrency</HI>; &amp; he thought he could never speak bad enough of himself, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Name that he would call himself by, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Toad.</HI></P>
<P N="16"><PB N="49" REF="000914_0061_0FACA23C2A822420"/>16. And though he prayed before, yet now the Lord poured out upon him the Spirit of Prayer, in an extraordinary man∣ner for one of his age; so that now he prayed more frequently, more earnestly, more spiritually than ever. O how eagerly would he beg to be washed in the Blood of Jesus! and that the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that was over Heaven and Earth, and Sea, would pardon and forgive him all his Sins, and receive his Soul into his Kingdom. And what he spoke, it was with so much life and fervour of Spirit, as that it filled the Hearers with astonish∣ment and joy.</P>
<P N="17">17. He had no small sense of the use and excellency of Christ, and such longings and breathings of his Soul after him, that when mention hath been made of Christ, he hath been ready almost to leap out of his bed for joy.</P>
<P N="18">18. When he was told, that if he should recover, he must not live as he li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; but he must give up himself to Christ, and to be his Child and Servant, to bear his Yoke and be obedient to his Laws, and live a holy life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take his Cross, and suffer mocking and reproach, it may be, persecution for
<PB N="50" REF="000914_0062_0FACA23CE3909D40"/>
His Name sake. Now, Child, (said one to him,) are you willing to have Christ up∣on such terms? He signified his willingness by the earnestness of his looks and words, and the casting up of his Eyes to Heaven, saying, <HI>Yes, with all my Soul, the Lord help∣ing me, I will do this.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. Yet he had many doubts and fears, and was ever and anon harping upon that, <HI>That though he were willing, yet Christ he feared was not willing to accept of him, because of the greatness of his Sin</HI>; yet his hopes were greater than his fears.</P>
<P N="20">20. The <HI>Wednesday</HI> before he Died, the Child lay as it were in a Trance for about half an hour, in which time he thought he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw a Vision of Angels: When he was out of his Trance, he was in a little pett, and asked his Nurse, Why she did not let him go? Go, whether Child said she: Why a∣long with those brave Gentlemen (said he:) but they told me they would come and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me away for all you, upon <HI>Fryday</HI> next. And he doubled his words many times, upon <HI>Fryday</HI> next, those brave Gen∣tlemen will come for me; and upon that day, the Child died joyfully.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="51" REF="000914_0063_0FACA23DA28C15F0"/>21. He was very thankful to his Master, and very sensible of his great kindness in taking him out of the streets, when he was a begging, and he admired at the goodness of God, which put it into the mind of a stranger to look upon, and to take such Fatherly care of such a pittyful sorry Creature as he was. O my dear Mother, (said he) and Child of God, I hope to see you in Heaven, for I am sure you will go thither. O Blessed, Blessed be God, that made you take pitty upon me, for I might have Dyed, and have gone to the Devil, and have been Damned for ever, if it had not been for you.</P>
<P N="22">22. The <HI>Thursday</HI> before he Dyed, he asked a very Godly Friend of mine, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he thought of his condition, and whether his Soul was now going? For he said, he could not still but fear, lest he should de∣ceive himself with false hopes, at which my Friend spoke to him thus: Child, for all that I have endeavoured to hold forth the Grace of God in Christ to thy Soul, and given you a warrant from the Word of God, that Christ is as freely offered to you, as to any sinner in the world; if thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but willing to accept of Him, thou
<PB N="52" REF="000914_0064_0FACA23F89F48DB0"/>
mayest have Christ and all that thou dost want, with Him; and yet thou givest way to these thy doubtings and fears, as though I told you nothing but lies. Thou sayes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou fearest that Christ will not accept of thee; I fear thou art not heartily willing to accept of Him. The Child an∣swered, <HI>Indeed I am</HI>; Why then, Child, if thou art unfeignedly willing to have Christ; I tell the, He is a thousand times more willing to have thee, &amp; wash thee, &amp; save thee, than thou art to desire it. And now at this time Christ offers Himself to thee again; therefore receive Him humbly by Faith free∣ly into thy heart, &amp; bid Him welcome, for He deserveth it. Upon which words the Lord discovered His love to the Child, and he gave a kind of a leap in his bed, and snapt his fingers and thumb together with abundance of joy, as much as to say, <HI>Well, yea all is well, the Match is made, Christ is willing, and I am willing too; and now Christ is mine, and I am His forever.</HI> And from that time forward, in full Joy &amp; assurance of God's love, he continued earnestly praising God, with desiring to dye, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Christ. And on <HI>Fryday-morning</HI> he
<PB N="53" REF="000914_0065_0FACA23FF9745408"/>
sweetly went to rest, using that very ex∣pression, <HI>Into thy hands, Lord I commit my Spirit.</HI> He Died punctually at that time which he had spoke of, and in which he expected those Angels to come to him; he was not much above Nine years old when he Died.</P>
<P>This Narrative I had from a Judicious Holy man, unrelated to him, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Eye and Ear-witness to all these things.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN <HI>the former Part of my Token for Chil∣dren, I did in part Promise,</HI> That if that Piece met with kind entertainment, it might be followed with a Second of the same Nature. <HI>If it did not seem a little to savour of Vanity, I might tell the World what encouragement I have met with in this Work; but this I will only say,</HI> That I have met with so much as hath perswaded me to give this <HI>Little Book</HI> leave to go abroad into the World. <HI>I am not also Ignorant, what Dis∣couragements I may meet with, from some, but as long as I am sure I shall not meet with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> That it's Improbable, if not Impossible, that it should Save a Soul; <HI>I think the rest may easily be answered, or warrantable slighted.

<HEAD>A TOKEN FOR CHILDREN. The Second Part.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="example">
<HEAD>EXAMPLE VIII. Of a Child that was very Serious at Four Years Old, with an Account of his Comfortable Death, when he was Twelve Years and Three Weeks Old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>JOhn Sudlow,</HI> was Born of Religious Parents, in the County of <HI>Middle∣sex,</HI> whose great care was to instil Spiritual Principles into him, as soon as he was capable of understanding of them;
<PB N="62" REF="000914_0072_0FACA245262E79A0"/>
whose Endeavours the Lord was pleased to Crown with the desired success: So that (to use the Expression of a Holy Man con∣cerning him) <HI>Scarce more could be expected or desired from so little a one.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. When he was scarce able to speak plain, he seemed to have a very great awe and reverence of God upon his Spirit, and a strange sence of the things of another world, as might easily be perceived by those serious and admirable questions which he would be oft asking of those Christians that he thought he might be bold with.</P>
<P N="3">3. The first thing that did most affect him, and made him endeavour to escape from the wrath to come, and to enquire what he should do to be Saved, was the Death of a little Brother; when he saw him without breath, and not able to stir, and then carried out of doors, and put in∣to a Pit-hole, he was greatly concerned, and asked notable questions about him; but that which was most affecting of him∣self and others, was, <HI>Whether he must Dye too,</HI> which being answered, it made such a deep impression upon him, that from that time forward, he was exceeding Seri∣ous, &amp; this was when he was about four Years old.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="63" REF="000914_0073_0FACA245E6C92360"/>4. Now he is desirous to know what he might do that he might live in another World, and what he must avoid, that he might not Dye for ever, and being in∣structed by his Godly Parents, he soon la∣bours to avoid whatsoever might displease God; now tell him that any thing was Sinful, and that God would not have him to do it, and he is easily kept from it, and even at this time of day, the apprehensions of God, and Death and Eternity laid such a restraint upon him, that he would not for a World have told a lye.</P>
<P N="5">5. He quickly learned to read exactly, and took such pleasure in reading of the Scriptures and his Catechism, and other good Books, that it is scarce to be parallell'd; he would naturally run to his Book with∣out bidding, when he came home from School, and when other Children of his age and acquaintance were playing, he reckon'd it his Recreation to be doing that which was good.</P>
<P N="6">6. When he was in Coats, he would be still asking his Maid serious questions, and praying her to teach him his Cate∣chism, or Scriptures, or some good thing; common Discourse he took no delight in,
<PB N="64" REF="000914_0074_0FACA246AD4F5D80"/>
but did most eagerly desire to be sucking in of the knowledge of the things of God, Christ, his Soul, and another World.</P>
<P N="7">7. He was lingely taken with the read∣ing of the Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and would be ready to leave his Dinner to go to his Book.</P>
<P N="8">8. He was exceeding careful of redeem∣ing and improving of Time; scarce a mo∣ment of it, but he would give an excellent account of the expence of it; so that this Child might have taught elder Persons, and will questionless Condemn their idle and unaccountable wasting of those Precious hours in which they should (as this sweet Child▪) have been laying in provision for Eternity.</P>
<P N="9">9. He could not endure to read any thing over slightly, but whatsoever he read, he dwelt upon it, laboured to understand it throughly, and remember it; and what he could not understand, he would oft ask his Father or Mother the meaning of it.</P>
<P N="10">10. When any Christian Friends have been discoursing with his Father, if they began to talk any thing about Religion, to be sure they should have his company,
<PB N="65" REF="000914_0075_0FACA247617B3A60"/>
and of his own accord, he would leave all to hear any thing of Christ, and crept as close to them as he could, and listen as af∣fectionately though it were for an hour or two: He was scarce ever known to ex∣press the least token of weariness while he was hearing any thing that was good, and sometimes, when Neighbours Children would come and call him out, and entice him, and beg of him to go with them, he could by no means be perswaded, though he might have had the leave of his Parents, if he had any hopes that any good Body would come into his Fathers House.</P>
<P N="11">11. He was very modest whilest any stranger was present, and was loth to ask them any questions: but as soon as they were gone, he would let his Father know that there was little said or done, but he observed it, and would reflect upon what was past in their discourse, and desire sa∣tisfaction in what he could not understand at present.</P>
<P N="12">12. He was a Boy of almost prodigious parts for his age, as will appear for his solid and rational questions; I shall but mention but two of many.</P>
<P N="13">13. The first was this, when he was
<PB N="66" REF="000914_0076_0FACA248220BA320"/>
reading by himself, in <HI>Dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton</HI>'s Poems a∣bout <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood and the Ark, he asked, <HI>Who Built the Ark?</HI> It being answered, that it was likely that <HI>Noah</HI> hired men to help him to Build it: <HI>And would they (said he) Build an Ark to Save another, and not go into it themselves?</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. Another question he put was this▪ <HI>Whether had a greater Glory, Saints or Angels▪</HI> It being answered, that Angels were the most Excellent of Creatures, and it's to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thought, their Nature is made capable o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> greater Glory than Mans. <HI>He said, he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of another mind, and his reason was, becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Angels was Servants, and Saints are Children▪ and that Christ never took upon him the Na∣ture of Angels, but he took upon him the Na∣ture of Saints, and by his being MAN, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath advanced humane Nature above the Na∣ture of Angels.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. By this you may perceive the great∣ness of his parts, and the bent of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thoughts; and thus he continued for se∣veral Years together, labouring to ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more and more Spiritual knowledge, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prepare for an endless Life.</P>
<P N="16">16. He was a Child of an excellent sweet Temper, wonderfully Dutiful to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="67" REF="000914_0077_0FACA248E26AB310"/>
Parents, ready and joyful to do what he was bid, and by no means would do any thing to displease them, and if they were at any time seemingly angry, he would not stir from them till they were thorowly reconciled to him.</P>
<P N="17">17. He was not only good himself, but would do what he could to make o∣thers so too, especially those that were nearest to him; he was very watchful over his Brethren and Sisters, and would not suffer them to use any unhandsome words, or to do any unhandsome action, but he would be putting them upon that which was good, and when he did at any time rebuke them, it was not Childishly and Slightly, but with great Gravity and Seriousness, as one that was not a little concerned for Gods Honour, &amp; the Eternal welfare of their Souls.</P>
<P N="18">18. He would go to his Father and Mother with great tenderness &amp; compassi∣on, (being far from telling of Tales) and beg of them, to take more care of the Souls of his Brethren and Sisters, and to take heed lest they should go on in a Sinful Christless state, and prove their sorrow and shame, and go to Hell when they dye, &amp; he r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined for ever.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="68" REF="000914_0078_0FACA249A2A308F0"/>19. He was exceedingly affected with hearing of the Word of God Preached, and could not be satisfied, except he could carry home much of the substance of what he heard; to this end he quickly got to learn Short-hand, and would give a very pretty account of any Sermon that he heard.</P>
<P N="20">20. He was much engaged in secret duty, and in reading the Scriptures; to be sure morning and evening he would be by himself, &amp; was no question, wrestling with God.</P>

O Lord, I pray thee to keep my Parents in thy Truth, and save them from this Infection, if it be thy Will, that they may live to bring me up in thy Truth: O Lord, I pray thee stay this Infection that rageth in this City, and Pardon their Sins, and Try them once more, and see if they will turn unto thee. Save me O Lord from this Infection, that I may Live to Praise and Glorify thy Name; but O Lord, if thou hast appointed me to dye of it, fit me for Death, that I may dye with comfort; and O Lord, I pray thee to help me to bear up under all afflictions, for Christ His sake. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q>

<P N="37">37.

<P N="38">38 That she might the better suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her Friends, she still insisted upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which might take off some of their bur∣then, by urging the necessity of Deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪

<HI>We are from the Earth, and to the Earth we must return: Dust is the Mother of us all, the Dust shall turn to Dust, from whence it is; and the Spirit to God which gave it.</HI></P>
<P N="39">39 Then she discoursed of the short∣ness of Mans Life. O what is the life of man! <HI>The days of man upon the Earth are as the grass, and the flowers of the Field, so he flourisheth, the wind passeth over it, and it is no more, and his place knows him no more.</HI></P>
<P N="40">40 She further urged the sin and sor∣row that did attend us in this life, and the longer we Live, the more we Sin; now the Lord will free me from that sin and sorrow. We know not the thoughts of God, yet do we know so much, that they are mercy and peace, and do give an expected end. But what shall I say, my life shall not continue long, I feel much weakness, O Lord, look upon me graci∣ously, have pitty upon my weak distres∣sed heart.

<P N="41">41 She was very frequent in Spiritual ejaculations, and it was no small comfort to her, that the Lord Christ did pray for her, and promise to send His Spirit to

comfort her. It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s said, (said she) <HI>I will Pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter.</HI> O let not Him leave me! O Lord, continue with me till my battle and work be finished.</P>
<P N="42">42 She had very low and undervaluing thoughts of her self, and her own Righte∣ousness; what meant she else to Cry out in such Langauge as that, None but Christ! without thee I can do nothing? Christ is the true Vine! O let me be a Branch of that Vine! What poor worms are we! O dear Father, how lame and halting do we go in the ways of God and Salvation? We know but in part, but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is imperfect shall be done away. O that I had attained to that now: But what are we our selves; Not only weakness and nothingness, but wickedness. For all the thoughts and imaginations of mans heart, are only evil, and that continually, we are by Nature Children of wrath, and are Conceived and Born in Sin and Unrighte∣ousness. Oh! Oh! this wretched and vile thing <HI>SIN!</HI> But thanks to God who hath redeemed me from it.</P>
<P N="43">43 She comforted her self and her Father, in that great Scripture, Rom. 8.15,

16, 17. <HI>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, by which ye Cry</HI> Abba Father. <HI>It is the Spirit that witnesseth with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God; and if Children, then are we Heirs, Heirs of God, and Joynt-Heirs with Christ.</HI> You see thence Father, that I shall be a fellow-heir with Christ; who hath said, <HI>In my Father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and take you to my self, that where I am there ye may be also.</HI> O Lord, take me to thy self.

<P N="44">44 Yea, my dear Child, said her Mo∣ther, He shall strengthen you with His Holy Spirit, until He hath fitted and pre∣pared you fully for that place which He hath prepared for you.</P>
<P N="45">45 Yea Mother, it is said in the Eighty-fourth Psalm, <HI>How lovel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts, my Soul doth thirst, and longeth for the Courts of the Lord; One day in thy Courts is better than a thousand; yea, I had rather be a Door-keeper in the House of God, than dwell in the Tents of the Wicked.</HI>

Read that Psalm, dear Mother, wherewith we may comfort one another. As for me, I am more and more spent, and draw near my last hour.</P>
<P N="46">46 Then she desired to be pray'd with, and begged that the Lord would give her an easie passage.</P>
<P N="47">47 After this, she turned to her Mo∣ther, with much affection, she said, Ah my dear &amp; loving Mother; that which cometh from the heart, doth ordinarily go to the heart, once more come and kiss me before I leave you.</P>
<P N="48">48 She was not a little concerned about the Souls of the rest of her Relations, &amp; did particularly charge it upon her Father, to do what he could possibly to bring them up in the ways of God.

<P N="49">49▪ I formerly wept for my Sister, thinking that she would dye before me, and now she weepeth for me, and then she kissed her weeping Sister. Also she took her young little Sister in her Arms, a Child of Six Months old, and she kissed it with much affection, as if her very bowels had moved within her, and spoke with many
<PB N="101" REF="000914_0111_0FACA1E6A3EBA208"/>
Heart-breaking words, both to her Parents and the Children.</P>
<P N="50">50 Her Father spake to one that was by, to take the poor little Child away from her, from the hazard of that fiery distem∣per, and bid his Daughter to give her from her, for he had already too much to bear. Well Father, said she, did not God pre∣serve the three Children in the Fiery Fur∣nace: And did you not teach me that Scripture, <HI>When thou passest through the Fire, thou shalt not be Burnt, neither shall the Flame kindle upon thee.</HI></P>
<P N="51">51 She had a very strong Faith in the Doctrine of the Resurrection, and did greatly solace her Soul with excellent Scrip∣tures, which do speak the happy state of Believers, as soon as their Souls are sepa∣rated from their Bodies, and what she quoted out of the Scripture, she did ex∣cellently and suitably apply to her own use, incomparibly above the common reach of her Sex and Age. That in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.42. was a good support to her, <HI>The Body is sown in Corruption, but it shall be raised incor∣ruptible; It is sown in dishonour, but it shall be raised in glory; It is sown in weakness, but it shall be raised in power.</HI> And then she sweet∣ly

applyes it, and takes in this Cordial. Behold thus it is, and thus it shall be with my poor mortal flesh: <HI>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, because they rest from their labours, and their works do follow them. The Righteous perish, and no man layeth it to heart, and the Ʋpright are taken away, and no man regardeth it that they are taken away from the evil to come, they shall enter into peace, they shall rest in their beds, every one who walked in their uprightness.</HI> Behold now Father, I shall rest and sleep in that Bed-chamber.</P>
<P N="52">52 Then she quoted Job 19.25, 26, 27. <HI>I know that my Redemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter end upon the Earth; and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for my self, and my eyes shall behold, and not another, though my reins be consumed within me.</HI> Behold now Father, this very skin which you see, and this very flesh which you see, shall be raised up again; and these very eyes which now are so dim, shall on that day see, and behold my dear and precious Redeemer; albeit the worms eat up my flesh, yet with these
<PB N="103" REF="000914_0113_0FACA1E8290FFA68"/>
eyes shall I behold God, even I my self, and not another for me.</P>
<P N="53">53 Then she quoted Joh. 5.28. <HI>Mar∣vel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at this, for the hour is coming in which all that are in their Graves shall hear His voice, and come forth; those that have done good un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Resurrection of Life.</HI> See Father, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall rise in that day, and then I shall be∣hold my Redeemer; then shall He say, <HI>Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit the King∣dom prepared for you before the beginning of the World.</HI></P>

<P N="55">55 My dear Parents, now we must shortly part, my speech faileth me, pray the Lord for a quiet close to my combat.</P>
<P N="56">56. Her Parents replied, Ah our dear Child! how sad is that to us, that we must part? She answered, I go to Heaven, and there we shall find one another again; I go to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="57">57 Then she comforted her self to
<PB N="104" REF="000914_0114_0FACA1E8E5C3E478"/>
think of her seeing her precious Brother and Sister again in Glory. I go to my Brother <HI>Jacob,</HI> who did so much Cry and Call upon God to the last moment of his breath: And to my little Sister who was but three years old when she died: Who, when we asked her whether she would Dye? Answered, Yes, if it be the Lord's will. I will go to my little Brother, if it be the Lord's will, or I will stay with my Mother, if it be the Lord's will. But I know that I shall Dye, and go to Heaven and to God. O see, how so small a Babe had so much give it to behave it self every way, and in all things so submissively to the will of God, as if it had no will of its own; but if it be the will of God, if it please God; nothing for her, but what the Will and Pleasure of God: And there∣fore, dear Father and Mother, give the Lord thanks for this His free &amp; rich Grace, and then I shall the more gladly be gone. Be Gracious then, O Lord, unto me also, be Gracious to me. Wash me thorowly from my Unrighteousness, and cleanse me from my Sin.</P>
<P N="58">58 After this, her Spirit was refreshed with the sense of the Pardon of her Sins,
<PB N="105" REF="000914_0115_0FACA1E9AC77C618"/>
which made her to Cry out, Behold God hath washed away my sins, O how do I long to die! The Apostle said, <HI>In this Body we earnesty sigh and groan, longing for our House which is in Heaven, that we may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loathed therewith.</HI> Now I also lie here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighing and longing for that Dwelling which is above. In the last Sermon which I heard; or ever shall hear, I heard this in the New-Church, which is matter of great comfort unto me.</P>
<P N="59">59. Then she repeated several notable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>criptures which were quoted in that Ser∣mon, afterward she desired to be pray'd with, and put Petitions into their Mouths, <HI>viz.</HI> That all her Sins might be forgiven, That she might have more abundant Faith, and the assurance of it; and the comfort of that assurance, and the continuation and strength of that comfort, according as her necessity should require. Afterwards she prayed her self, and continued a pretty space.</P>
<P N="60">60 When Prayers was ended, she cal∣led to her Father and Mother, and de∣manded of them, whether she had any time angered or grieved them, or done any

<P N="61">61 They answered her, that if a Children had carried themselves so to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parents as she had done, there would b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> less grief and sorrow on all hands tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is; and if any such thing hath escaped the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, we would forgive it withal ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearts, you have done as became a good Child.</P>
<P N="62">62 Her heart being quieted with he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> peace with God and her Parents, she bega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to dispose of her Books; particularly sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> intreated her Mother, to keep Mr. <HI>De Wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Catechise Lectures, as long as she lived for her sake, and let my little Sister hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my other Book as my remembrance.</P>
<P N="63">63 Then (said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e) she felt her breas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exceedingly pained, by which she knew that her end was very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh.

<HEAD>EXAMPLE XIII. Of one that began to look towards Heaven▪ when he was very Young, with many Eminent Passages of his Life, and his joyful Death, when he was Eleven Years and Three Quarters Old.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n Harvy</HI> was Born in <HI>London,</HI> in the Year 1654. his Father was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant, he was piously Educated under his virtuous Mother, and soon began to suck in Divine Things with no small delight.</P>
<P N="2">2 The first thing very observable in him was, that when he was two years and eight months old, he could speak as well as other Children do usually at five years old.</P>
<P N="3">3 His Parents judging, that he was then a little too young to send out to School, let him have his liberty to Play a little about their Yard. But instead of playing, he found out a School of his own accord hard by home, and went to the
<PB N="114" REF="000914_0124_0FACA1F1219F3168"/>
School-Mistress, and intreated her to teach him to read, and so he went for some time to School without the knowledge of his Parents, and made a very strange progress in his Learning, &amp; was able to read distinct∣ly, before most Children are able to know their Letters.</P>
<P N="4">4 He was wont to ask many serious &amp; weighty Questions, about matters which concerned his Soul and Eternity.</P>
<P N="5">5 His Mother being greatly troubled upon the Death of one of his Uncles, this Child came to his Mother and said, <HI>Mother, though my Uncle be Dead, doth not the Scrip∣ture say, he must Rise again: Yea, and I must Dye, &amp; so must every Body, &amp; it will not be long▪ before Christ will come to Judge the World, and then we shall see one another again, I pray Mother do not weep so much.</HI> This grave Counsel he gave his Mother, when he was not quite five years old, by which the sorrow for her Brother was turned into admiration at her Child, &amp; she was made to sit silent and quiet under that smarting stroke.</P>
<P N="6">6 After this, his Parents removed to <HI>Aberdeen</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and settled their Child under an able &amp; painful School-Master there,
<PB N="115" REF="000914_0125_0FACA1F1E73E7A70"/>
whose custome was upon the Lord's day in the Morning, to examine his Scholars concerning the Sermons that they had heard the former Lords day, and to add some other Questions which might try the Understanding &amp; Knowledge of his Scholars; the Question that was once proposed to his Forme was, <HI>Whether God had a Mother?</HI> None of all the Scholars could answer it, till it came to <HI>John Harvy,</HI> who being asked, <HI>Whether God had a Mother</HI>? An∣swered <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as He was God, He could not have a Mother, but as He was Man He had</HI>; this was before he was quite Six Years old His Master was somewhat amazed at the Childs answer, and took the first opportunity to go to his Mother, to thank her for instructing her Son so well; but she replied, that he was never taught that from her, but that he understood it by Reading, and his own Observa∣tion.</P>
<P N="7">7 He was a Child that was Extra∣ordinary inquisitive, &amp; full of good questions, and very careful to observe and remember what he heard.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="116" REF="000914_0126_0FACA1F2A4D19920"/>8 He had a great Hatred of whatso∣ever he knew to be displeasing to God, and was so greatly Concerned for the Honour of God, that he would take on bitterly, if that any gross Sins were com∣mitted before him. And he had a deep sense of the worth of Souls, and was not a little grieved when he saw any do that which he knew was dangerous to their Souls.</P>
<P N="9">9 One day seeing one of his near Relations come into his Fathers House distempered with Drink as he thought, he quickly went very Seriously to him and Wept over him, that he should so Offend God, and Hazard his Soul, and begged of him to spend his Time better than in Drinking and Gaming; and this he did, without any instruction from his Parents, but from an inward Principle of Grace, and love to God and Souls, as it is verily believed.</P>
<P N="10">10 When he was at play with other Children, he would be oftentimes putting in some word to keep them from nagh∣ty talk, or wicked actions; and if any did take the Lords Name in vain, or do any thing that was not becoming of a
<PB N="117" REF="000914_0127_0FACA1F366EE3F60"/>
good Child, they should soon hear of it with a witness; nay, once▪ hearing a Boy speak very prophanely, and that after two or three admonitions, he would not forbear, nor go out of his Company neither, he was so transported with Zeal, that he could not forbear falling upon him, to beat him, but his Mother chiding him for it, he said, that he could not endure to hear the Name of God so abused by a wretched Boy.</P>
<P>This is observed not to Vindicate the Act, but to take notice of his Zeal.</P>
<P N="11">11 He was a Child that took great delight in the Company of Good men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> especially Ministers and Scholars; and if he had any leisure time, he would improve it by visiting of such, whose dis∣course▪ might make him wiser and better; and when he was in their Society, to be sure, his talk was more like a Christian &amp; Scholar, than a Child.</P>
<P N="12">12. One day after School-time was over, he gave Mr. <HI>Andrew Kant</HI> (one of the Minis∣ters of <HI>Aberdeen</HI>) a visit, &amp; asked him several solid Questions, but the Good man asked
<PB N="118" REF="000914_0128_0FACA1F420A0B110"/>
him some questions out of his Catechism: And finding him not so ready in the an∣swers as he should have been, did a little reprove him and told him, that he must be sure to get his Catechism perfectly▪ by heart; the Child took the reproof very well, and went home, and fell very hot upon his Catechism, and never left, till he got it by heart; and not only so, but he would be enquiring into the sence and meaning of it.</P>
<P N="13">13 He was so greatly taken with his Catechism, that he was not content to learn it himself, but he would be put∣ting others upon learning their Catechism, especially, those that were nearest to him; he would not be satisfied, till he had per∣swaded his Mothers Maids to learn it, and when they were at work, he would be still following them with some good question or other; so that the Child seem∣ed to be taken up with the thoughts of his Soul, and Gods Honour, &amp; the good of other Souls.</P>
<P N="14">14 He was a Conscientious observer of the Lord's day, spending all the time either in secret Prayer, or reading the Scriptures, and Good Books; Learning
<PB N="119" REF="000914_0129_0FACA1F4E7B7A210"/>
of his Catechim, and Hearing of the Word of God, and publick Duties; and was not only careful in the performance of these Duties himself, but was ready to put all that he knew upon a strict ob∣servation of the Lor'ds day, and was ex∣ceedingly grieved at the Prophanation of it; one Lords day, a Servant of his Fathers going out of the house upon ex∣traordinary occasion, to fetch some Beer, she took on so bitterly, that he could scarce be pacified, because that Holy Day was so abused (as he judged) in his Fathers house.</P>
<P N="15">15 When he was betwixt Six and Seven Years old; it pleased God to afflict him with sore eyes, which was no small grief unto him, because it kept him from School, which he loved as well as many Boys do their play; and that which was worse, he was Commanded by the Doctor not to read any Book whatsoever at home. But, O how was this poor Child grieved, that he might not have liberty to Read the Holy Scriptures! And for all their Charge, he would get by himself, and stand by the window, and read the Bible and good Books; yea, he was so greedy of reading
<PB N="120" REF="000914_0130_0FACA1F5A2DC54E8"/>
the Scripture, and took so much delight in it, that he would scarce allow himself time to dress himself; for reading the Word of God was his great delight. Yea, though he had been beat for studying so much, yet judging it God's Command that he should give himself up to read∣ing, he could not be beat off from it, till he was so bad, that he had like never to have recovered his sight more.</P>
<P N="16">16 It was his practice to be much by himself in Secret Prayer, and he was careful to manage that work, so as that it might be as secret as possible it might be, but his frequency and constancy made it to be so easily observed, upon which, <HI>One time one having a great mind to know what this sweet Babe Prayed for, got into a place near him, and heard him very ear∣nestly Praying for the Church of God, desiring that the Kingdom of the Gospel might be spread over the whole World, and that the Kingdom of Grace might more and more come into the Hearts of God's People, and that the Kingdom of Glory might be hastened.</HI> He was wont to continue half an hour, sometimes an hour, upon his knees to∣gether.</P>
<P N="17"><PB N="121" REF="000914_0131_0FACA1F66CFB6568"/>17 He was much above the vanities that most Children are taken with, and was indeed too much a man to live long.</P>
<P N="18">18 He was very humble and modest, and did by no means affect fineness in ap∣parel, but hated any thing more than ne∣cessaries, either in cloaths or diet.</P>
<P N="19">19 When he perceived either his Brother or Sisters pleased with their new Cloathes, he would with a great deal of Gravi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y reprove their Folly, and when his reproof signified little, he would bewail their vanity.</P>
<P N="20">20 Once he had a New Suit brought from the Taylors, which when he look∣ed on, he found some Ribbons at the knees, at which he was grieved; asking his Mother, <HI>Whether those things would keep him warm</HI>? No, Child, said his Mother; <HI>Why then</HI> (said he) <HI>do you suffer them to be put here, you are mistaken, if you think such things please <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doubt▪ some that are better than u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Money that this Cost you, to buy them Bread.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21 He would intreat his Mother to have a care of gratifying a proud hu∣mour
<PB N="122" REF="000914_0132_0FACA1F7263B5698"/>
in his Brother and Sisters, he did tell them of the danger of Pride, and how little reason they had to be Proud of that which was their Shame; for said he, <HI>If it had not been for Sin, we should have had no need of Cloathes.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22 At leisure times, he would be talk∣ing to his School-fellows about the things of God, and urge the necessity of a Holy life. That Text he much spoke on to them, <HI>The Axe is laid on the Root of the Tree, and every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down and cast into the Fire.</HI> Every Mothers Child of us that doth not bring forth the fruit of good Works, shall shortly be cut down with the Axe of Gods wrath, and cast into the Fire of Hell; and this he spake like one that believed and felt the power of what he spake, and not with the least visibility of a Childish levity of Spirit. This was, when he was between Seven and Eight years old, and if he perceived any Children unconcerned about thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Souls, he would be greatly troubled a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it.</P>
<P N="23"><PB N="123" REF="000914_0133_0FACA1F7F29EC938"/>23 After this, his Parents removed not far from <HI>London,</HI> where he continued till that dreadful year, Sixty Five; he was then sent to the <HI>Latin</HI> School, where he soon made a very considerable Progress, and was greatly beloved of his Master, the School was his beloved place, and Learning his recreation. He was never taught to write, but took it of his own ingenuity.</P>
<P N="24">24 He was exceeding Dutiful to his Parents, and never did in the least dis∣pute their Command, except, when he thought they might cross the Command of God, (as in the forementioned business of reading the Scriptures when his eyes were so bad.)</P>
<P N="25">25 He was exceeding contented with any mean Diet, and to be sure he would not touch a bit of any thing, till he had begged Gods Blessing upon it.</P>
<P N="26">26 He would put his Brother and Sisters upon their Duties, and observe them whether they performed it or no, and
<PB N="124" REF="000914_0134_0FACA1F8A42595F8"/>
when he saw any neglect, he would soon warn them; if he saw any of them take a spoon into their hands before they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raved a Blessing, he said that is just like a Hog indeed.</P>
<P N="27">27 His Sister was afraid of the dark∣ness, and would sometimes Cry, upon this account; he told her, she must fear God more, and she need then be afraid o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nothing.</P>
<P N="28">28▪ He would humbly put his near Relations upon their Duty, and minding the Concerns of their Souls and Eternity, with more Seriousness and Life, and to have a care of doing that which was for the dishonour of God, and the hazard of the Soul.</P>
<P N="29">29 He was of a compassionate and charitable disposition, and very pitiful to the poor, or any that were in distress, but his greatest pity was to poor Souls; and as well as he could, he would be put∣ting Children, Play-fellows, Servants, Neighbours, upon minding their poor Souls.</P>
<P N="30"><PB N="125" REF="000914_0135_0FACA1F96C3594C8"/>30 One notable instance of his true Charity, I cannot omit. <HI>A certain</HI> Turk <HI>was by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovidence of God, cast into the place where he Lived, which this sweet Child hearing of, had a great pity to his Soul, and studied how he might be any way instru∣mental to do it good; at la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t finding a man that understood the Language of the</HI> Turk, <HI>he used means to get them together, which he at last procured; the first thing that he did, was to put his Friend upon d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scoursing with the</HI> Turk <HI>about his Principles, whether he acknowlede a De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty; which the</HI> Turk <HI>owning; the next thing he enquired after, was,, What he thought of the Lord Jesus Christ. At which the</HI> Turk <HI>was troubled and put off the discourse, and said, he was athirst, and an hungry; which the Child being informed of, by the Interpreter, immediately went to a Brew-house near at hand (his own house being far off) and did intreat the Master of the Brew-house to give him some Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r for the</HI> Turk, <HI>and the argument he used was this</HI>: Sir, here is a poor stranger that is athirst, we know not where we may be cast be∣fore we Dye: <HI>He went to another place, and begged Food for him; using the same
<PB N="126" REF="000914_0136_0FACA1FA2E75E3F0"/>
argument as before, but his Friends hearing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f it, were angry w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th him, but he told th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m he aid it for a poor stranger that was far from home, and he did it that he might think the better of the Christians, and the Christian Religion.</HI></P>
<P N="31">31 He would have a savoury word to say to every one that he conversed with, to put them in mind of the worth of Christ, and their Souls; and their near∣ness to Eternity. Insomuch, that good People took no small pleasure in his Company. The Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lor that made his Cloathes, would keep them the longer before he brought them home, that he might have the benefit of his Spiritual and Christian society; and more frequent visits.</P>
<P N="32">32 He bewailed the miserable con∣dition of the generality of man-kind (when he was about Ten Years old) that were utterly estranged from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, though they called Him Father, yet they were His Children only by Creation, and not by any likeness they had to God, or interest in Him.</P>
<P N="33"><PB N="127" REF="000914_0137_0FACA1FAE6123B28"/>33 Thus he continued walking in the ways of God, ingaged in reading, pray∣ing, hearing the Word of God, and Spi∣ritual discourse, discovering thereby his serious thoughts of Eternity.</P>
<P N="34">34 He had an earnest desire, if it might be the Lords good pleasure, to give himself up to the Lord in the work of the Ministry, if he should live; and this out of a dear love to Christ, and Souls.</P>
<P N="35">35 He was next to the Bible most, taken with reading of Reverend Mr. <HI>Bax∣ter</HI>'s works, especially his <HI>Saints Everlast∣ing Rest</HI>; and truly, the thoughts of that Rest, and Eternity, seemed to swallow up all other thoughts; and he lived in a constant preparation for it, and looked more like one that was ripe for Glory, than an inhabitant of this lower World.</P>
<P N="36">36 When he was about Eleven years and Thre quarters old, his Mothers house was visited with the Plague; his eldest Sister was the first that was visited with
<PB N="128" REF="000914_0138_0FACA1FBA84BB450"/>
this distemper, and when they were pray∣ing for her, he would Sob and Weep bitterly.</P>
<P N="37">37 As soon as he perceived that his Sister was Dead, he said, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done: Blessed be the Lord.</HI> Dear Mother, said he, you must do as <HI>David</HI> did, after the Child was Dead, he went and refreshed himself, and quietly sub∣mitted to the Will of God.</P>
<P N="38">38 The rest of the Family held well for about Fourteen Days, which time he spent in Religious Duties, and preparing for his Death; but still his great Book was, <HI>The Saints Rest</HI>; which he read with exceeding curiosity, gathering many observations out of it in writing, for his own use. He wrote several Divine meditations of his own, upon several Subjects, but that which seemed most admi∣rable, was a meditation upon the Excellency of Christ; he was never well but when he was more immediately engaged in the Service of God.</P>
<P N="39">39 At Fourteen Days end, he was
<PB N="129" REF="000914_0139_0FACA1FC68C67DE8"/>
taken Sick, at which he seemed very Patient and Chearful; yet sometimes he would say that his Pain was great.</P>
<P N="40">40 His Mother looking upon his Bro∣ther, shaked her head, at which he asked, if his Brother were marked; she answer∣ed, Yes Child; he asked again, whether he were marked; she answered nothing; well, says he, I know I shall be marked; I pray let me have Mr. <HI>Baxters</HI> Book, that I may read a little more of Eternity, be∣fore I go into it. His Mother told him that he was not able to read; he said that he was; however, then pray by me, and for me; his Mother answered, that she was so f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of grief, that she could not pray now; but she desired to hear him pray his last prayer.</P>
<P N="41">41 His Mother asked him, whether he were willing to Die, and leave her? He answered, <HI>Yes, I am willing to leave you, and go to my Heavenly Father.</HI> His Mother answered, Child, if thou hadst but an assurance of Gods Love, I should not be so much troubled.</P>
<P N="42"><PB N="130" REF="000914_0140_0FACA1FD21640CC8"/>42 He answered, &amp; said to his Mother, <HI>I am assured, dear Mother, that my Sins are Forgiven, and that I shall go to Heaven,</HI> for said he, <HI>here stood an Angel by me, that told me, I should quickly be in Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="43">43 At this his Mother burst forth in∣to tears. O Mother, said he, did you but know what joy I feel, you would not weep, but rejoyce. I tell you I am so full of comfort, that I can't tell you how I am; O Mother I shall presently have my head in my Fathers bosome, and shall be there, where the <HI>Four and Twenty Elders cast down their Crowns, and Sing Hallelujah, Glory and Praise, to Him that sits upon the Throne, &amp; unto the Lamb for ever.</HI></P>
<P N="44">44 Upon this, his Speech began to fail him, but his Soul seemed still to be taken up with Glory, and nothing now grieved him but the sorrow that he saw his Mother to be in for his Death; a little to divert his Mother, he asked her, <HI>What she had to Supper</HI>; but presently in a kind of Divine Rapture, he Cryed out, <HI>O what Sweet Supper have I making ready for me in Glory</HI>!</P>
<P N="45"><PB N="131" REF="000914_0141_0FACA1FF0D3299E0"/>45 But seeing all this did rather in∣crease, than allay his Mothers grief, he was more troubled, and asked her, what she meant, thus to offend God; know you not, that it is the Hand of the Almighty. <HI>Humble your self under the mighty hand of God, Lay your self in the Dust, and kiss the Rod of God, and let me see you do it, in token of your submission to the Will of God, and bow before Him.</HI> Upon which, raising up him∣self a little, he gave a lowly bow, and spake no more; but went Chearfully and Triumphingly to rest, in the bosome of JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>Hallelujah.</HI></P>

<P>MR. <HI>Thomas Thornton,</HI> the aged and faithful Pastor of <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> was blessed with a Daughter, named <HI>Priscilla,</HI> which at the Age of Eleven, left this world, having first given demonstrations of an Exemplary Piety.</P>
<P>She was one remarkably grave, devout, serious; very inquisitive about the mat∣ters of Eternity; and in her particular Calling very diligent. She was neverthe∣less troubled with sore <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Exercises</HI> about the state of her own Soul: the Anguish of her Spirit, about her <HI>Body of Death,</HI> caused her to pour out many tears and prayers; and she pressed, That some other pious Children of her acquain∣tance, might with her keep a Day of Hu∣miliation together, <HI>That</HI> (as she expressed it) <HI>they might get power against their sinful Natures.</HI> But it pleased God at length to bless the words of her Godly Mother, for the quieting of her mind. It was her singular Happiness, that she had such God∣ly Parents; but it was her Opinion and Expression, <HI>We trust too much to the Prayers

of our Parents, whereas we should Pray for our selves.</HI></P>
<P>At last, she fell Mortally Sick. In the beginning of her Sickness, she was afraid of Dying; <HI>For,</HI> said she, <HI>I know of no Pro∣mise to encourage me.</HI> She could not but own that she had in some measure walked with God; yet she complain'd, <HI>That she had not found God meeting her in her Prayers, and making her Heart willing to be at His Dispose</HI>; and that the <HI>Pride</HI> of her heart, now lay as a <HI>Load</HI> upon it. She own'd, That she had many Thoughts of Jesus Christ, and that <HI>it grieved her that she had Sinned against Him, who had</HI> Done <HI>&amp;</HI> Dy'd <HI>for her.</HI></P>
<P>But many dayes were not past, before she could profess her self <HI>Willing to Dye</HI>▪ with some Assurance of her then going to Eternal Blessedness. Many Thanks and Loves did she now render to one of her Superiors, declaring, <HI>'Twas because they had curb'd her, and restrain'd her from sinful vanities.</HI> And she said, <HI>Were I now to choose my Company, it should be among the People of God; I see plainly that they are the only Company.</HI> She was not without her Conflicts in this time, wherein one of

Will you</HI> Mourn, <HI>when I am so full of</HI> Joy? <HI>I pray Rejoyce with me.</HI></P>
<P>When she was extreamly spent, she said unto her Parent, <HI>O my Father, I have been much troubled by Satan, but I find Christ is too hard for him, and Sin, and all.</HI> She now said, <HI>I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w now that I shall Dye</HI>; and being asked, Whether she were afraid of Death; with a sweet smile she replied, <HI>No not I, Christ is better than Life!</HI> And so she continued in a most joyful frame, till she Dyed: a little before which, it being the <HI>Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-day,</HI> she asked, What time of the day 'twas, and when they told her, 'Twas Three of the Clock; she replied, <HI>What?

Her answer was, That now she was <HI>willing to Dy,</HI> and to leave a thousand worlds, and Father and Mother, and all to go to Christ. She desired, That

And when she see her Father and Mother weeping for her, she said, <HI>My dear Father and Mother, don't mourn for me; you might well mourn for me, if I were to go into utter Darkness; but I am going to God in Heaven. I long to be in the New Jeru∣salem, with the Lord Jesus Christ: And now I can Dye.</HI> And lying a while in an Agony, when she came out of that Ago∣ny, she said, <HI>Mother, did you not hear me Sing?

<P><Q>There was one very Remarkable effect of it. His <HI>Father</HI> was a man of a very Li∣centious Conversation; a Gamester, a Dancer, a very Lewd Company-keeper. The Mother of this <HI>Elect-Vessel,</HI> one day took him, while he was yet a <HI>Child,</HI> and calling the Family together, made him to <HI>Pray</HI> with them. His <HI>Father</HI> coming to understand, at what a rate the <HI>Child</HI> had Pray'd with his Family, it smote the Soul of him, with a great Conviction, &amp; proved the Beginning of his Conversion unto God. God left not off working on his Heart, until he proved One of the most <HI>Eminent Christians</HI> in all that Neighbour-hood. So he <HI>Lived,</HI> so he <HI>Dyed</HI>; a man of more than Ordinary Piety. And it was his manner sometimes to Retire unto those very places of his Lewdnesses, where, having that his little Son in his Company, he would pour out Floods of Tears, in Repenting Prayers before the Lord.</Q></P>
