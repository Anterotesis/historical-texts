<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<L>—IN less than a Year,</L>
<L>Mark me Sir, you'll repent of't, as sure as you're there.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUSBAND.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pray, for God's Sake, my Dear, be a little discreet;</L>
<L>As I hope to be sav'd, you'll alarm the whole Street;</L>
<L>Don't delight so in scolding yourself out of Breath;</L>
<L>To the Neighbours 'tis Sport, but to me it is Death.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="013245_0003_0F8FB51EF65C3E98"/>I submit for Peace sake, to be led by the Nose;</L>
<L>Don't make the World think that we're come to Blows:</L>
<L>If once but a Crotchet in your Head you have got,</L>
<L>For your Husband's Advice, Ma'm, you care not a Groat.</L>
<L>There are many wise People, I'd have you to know,</L>
<L>Who often have ask'd it, and have follow'd it too:</L>
<L>If I speak but a Word, you rave like a Fury,</L>
<L>The Patience of <HI>Job,</HI> Madam, wou'dn't, cou'dn't endure ye:</L>
<L>Had I a Million of Sons, Ah! by the Lord <HI>Harry,</HI></L>
<L>I'd advise every one of them never to marry.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Call the Doctor!—by this un∣usual Palaver,</L>
<L>I fear thou'st been bit, you so foam and so slaver:</L>
<L>Alas! never,—ah!—never, elect him again;</L>
<L>This pride of Delegation, turns many a Brain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUSBAND.</SPEAKER>
<L>You mistook me, my Dear, I did not pretend,</L>
<L>Every Measure of Congress, right or wrong to defend;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="013245_0004_0F8FB5204D0EB278"/>Many Things they've left undone, they shou'd surely have done,</L>
<L>Many Things they have done, they shou'd have sure let alone:</L>
<L>The — <HI>Suffolk</HI> — Appro∣bation,</L>
<L>—</L>
<L><HI>England</HI> — d—m—n</L>
<L>—</L>
<L>Nice Discussions, a wise Man will ever decline,</L>
<L>When his Head and his Heart are o'er heated with Wine:</L>
<L>Men, when drunk, are all Heroes, all prudent, all gallant;</L>
<L>Stark Fools, become Sages; rank Cowards, grow valiant:</L>
<L>High Matters of State should be plann'd be∣fore Dinner;</L>
<L>A Saint in the Morn, is at Night oft a Sinner:</L>
<L>But grant their Resolves were more absurd than they are,</L>
<L>Could you really expect your meek Husband would dare</L>
<L>Oppose such a Torrent, when <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well known,</L>
<L>He dares not say to your Face, his Soul is his own.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<L>God bless us, and keep us! why, my Dearest, till now,</L>
<L>I ne'er heard you so wise, or so witty, I vow;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="013245_0005_0F8FB52076CC32C0"/>I protest this same Congress's a very fine School;</L>
<L>A Man comes back a <HI>Chatham,</HI> who went there a Fool.</L>

<SPEAKER>HUSBAND.</SPEAKER>
<L>You're afraid to hear all, but for once I will speak,</L>
<L>Wherever I am known, I am call'd <HI>Jerry Sneak</HI>;</L>

<L>Prithee! ha, ha, ha, Prithee! my Senator grave!</L>
<L>Sir! I'll make you repent of that Speech, to your Grave;</L>
<L>Why had'st not said, KNOW THEN, like the mighty Congress,</L>
<L>I presume you'd a Hand in that civil Ad∣dress:</L>
<L>Indeed, my sweet Sir, when you treat with your Betters,</L>
<L>You should mind how you speak, and how you write Letters.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUSBAND.</SPEAKER>
<L>That Horse-laugh is all feign'd, with much better Grace,</L>
<L>You know Ma'm, you cou'd hit me a Slap in the Face:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="013245_0006_0F8FB5214B22F7A8"/>Consider, my Dear, you're a Woman of Fashion,</L>
<L>'Tis really indecent to be in such Passion;</L>
<L>Mind thy Houshold-Affairs, teach thy Chil∣dren to read,</L>
<L>And never, Dear, with Politics, trouble thy Head.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Good Lord! how magnanimous! I fear Child thou'rt drunk,</L>
<L>Dost thou think thyself, Deary, a <HI>Cromwel,</HI> or <HI>Monck?</HI></L>
<L>Dost thou think that wise Nature meant thy shallow Pate,</L>
<L>To digest the important Affairs of a State?</L>
<L>Thou born! thou! the Machine of an Empire to wield?</L>
<L>Art thou wise in Debate? Shoud'st feel bold in the Field?</L>
<L>If thou'st Wisdom to manage Tobacco, and Slave,</L>
<L>It's as much as God ever design'd thee to have:</L>
<L>Because Men are Males, are they all Politi∣cians?</L>
<L>Why then I presume they're Divines and Phy∣sician▪</L>
<L>And born all with Talents every Station to fill,</L>
<L>Noble Proofs you've given! no doubt, of your Skill:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="013245_0007_0F8FB521F63CAC90"/>Wou'd! instead of Delegates, they'd sent De∣legates Wives;</L>
<L>Heavens! we cou'dn't have bungled it so for our Lives!</L>
<L>If you had even consulted the Boys of a School,</L>
<L>Believe me, Love, you cou'd not have play'd so the Fool.</L>
<L>Wou'd it bluster, and frighten, its own poor dear Wife,</L>
<L>As the Congress does <HI>England!</HI> quite out of her Life?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUSBAND.</SPEAKER>
<L>This same Congress, my Dear, much disturbeth thy Rest,</L>
<L>God and Men ask no more, than that Men do their best;</L>
<L>'Tis their Fate, not their Crimes, if they've little Pretence,</L>
<L>To your most transcendent Penetration and Sense;</L>
<L>'Tis great Pity, I grant, they had'nt ask'd the Advice</L>
<L>Of a Judge of Affairs, so profound, and so nice;</L>
<L>You're so patient, so cool so monstrous elo∣quent,</L>
<L>Next Congress, my Empress, sha'l be made President.</L>

<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have said it, my Dear, and I'll say it again,</L>
<L>That your famous Congress were a strange set of men:</L>
<L>To you, my dear Love, I may be sometimes too pert,</L>
<L>But then, you know well, Dear, it is but for a Spirt:</L>
<L>Tho' I do now, and then, take the Freedom, to glance,</L>
<L>At your Dreams, and your Visions, I mind the main Chance;</L>
<L>Regard your true Interest, your Health, and your Ease,</L>
<L>And am ever dispos'd, to do just, as you please▪</L>
<L>Sometimes, to be sure, it is not quite conve∣nient,</L>
<L>But since I swore t' obey, I'm always obe∣dient;</L>
<L>I defy you, to say now; you can't for your Life,</L>
<L>That I'm not, at the Bottom, a very good Wife:</L>
<L>Could I see you in Prison, or hang'd, without Pain?</L>
<L>Then, pray, have not I reason enough to complain?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUSBAND.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! for God's Sake, what Hazard of that do I run?</P>

<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Psha, on, but beware, Dear, that you are not undone;</L>
<L>'Twou'd soon break my Heart, tho' we do now and then jar,</L>
<L>Were you ruin'd, or taken, or killed in War.</L>
<L>From the Love I bear you, and our dear Girls and Boys,</L>
<L>I have examin'd this Book, that makes so much Noise:</L>
<L>Without seeing thro' Mill-stones, its soon un∣derstood,</L>
<L>As sure as you are born, this will at last end in Blood:</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cabal, which the high sovereign Power defies,</L>
<L>No matter whether prompted, by Truth, or by Lies;</L>
<L>No Matter for us, whether without, or with Reason,</L>
<L>In Law, they say's deem'd, little short, of High Treason.</L>
<L>Three thousand Miles distant, we may crow and exult,</L>
<L>But can you hope, any State, will bear such Insult.</L>
<L>To your high mighty Congress, the Members were sent,</L>
<L>To lay all our Complaints, before Parliament;</L>
<L>Usurpation rear'd its head, from that fatal Hour,</L>
<L>You resolv'd, you enacted, like a sovereign Pow'r.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="013245_0010_0F8FB525CFA59D80"/>Acts, tho' not enjoin'd, on Pain of Gibbets, and Flames,</L>
<L>Disobey'd, at the Price, of our Fortunes, and Fames.</L>
<L>Your Non-Imports, and Exports, are full fraught with Ruin,</L>
<L>Of thousands, and thousands, the utter Un∣doing:</L>
<L>While, without daring to bite, you're shewing your Teeth,</L>
<L>You've contriv'd to starve, all the poor People to death.</L>
<L>Into all that's most sacred, you've made mad Inroad,</L>
<L><HI>Morocco</HI> itself, wou'd be asham'd, of your Code.</L>
<L>Pretty Sovereigns, in truth! God help us, what Things!</L>
<L>To make deep Politicians, or Statesmen, or Kings?</L>
<L>If <HI>Philadelphia</HI> or <HI>York,</HI> propos'd some wise Plan,</L>
<L>From that very Moment, you all branded the Man</L>
<L>— of Sense and of Honour—derive</L>
<L>—Carpenters-Hall— alive</L>
<L>— murder or rob</L>
<L>— Pieces —Mob.</L>
<L>Instead of imploring, their Justice, or Pity,</L>
<L>You treat Parliament, like a Pack, of Banditti;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="013245_0011_0F8FB52721A9DBE0"/>Instead of Addresses, fram'd on Truth, and on Reason,</L>
<L>They breathe nothing, but Insult, Rebellion, and Treason;</L>
<L>Instead of attempting, our Interests to further,</L>
<L>You bring down, on our Heads▪ Perdition, and Murder.</L>
<L>When I think how these Things must infalli∣bly end,</L>

<L>Lets return to ourselves, if you've Eyes, you will see</L>

<L>Its hardly worth ones while, to show Indig∣nation</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="013245_0012_0F8FB527336764B0"/>At that foolish Bugbear, your Non-Impor∣tation;</L>
<L>For Men do so hunger, and so thirst, after Pelf.</L>
<L>That when thousands are starv'd, 'twill blow up, of itself.</L>
<L>You have read a great deal,—with patient Reflection,</L>
<L>Consider one Moment, your Courts of In∣spection:</L>
<L>Could the Inquisition, <HI>Venice, Rome,</HI> or <HI>Ja∣pan,</HI></L>
<L>Have devised, so horrid, so wicked a Plan?</L>
<L>In all the Records, of the most slavish Nation,</L>
<L>You'll not find an Instance, of such Usurpa∣tion.</L>

<L>And in Grand Continental Congress, had re∣solv'd,</L>
<L>"Let the Bonds of social Bliss, be from henceforth dissolved,"</L>
<L>They could not have plann'd, with more ex∣quisite Skill,</L>
<L>Nor have found, a tame Race, more submiss to their Will.</L>
<L>Let Fools, Pedants, and Husbands, continue to hate</L>
<L>The Advice of us Women, and call it all Prate:</L>

<L>Both by Night and by Day, I will ring in your Ear—</L>
<L>Make your Peace:—Fear the King:—The Parliament fear.</L>
