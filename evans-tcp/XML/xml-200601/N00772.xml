no operation thereupon, to prepare it, for its <HI>Application</HI> unto our selves. The <HI>Matchless Favours</HI> of God unto <HI>New Eng∣land</HI> are now to be set before you, in a <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Catalogue</HI> of them: I say, a <HI>Short</HI> one, for who can in a piece of an Hour, Compose a <HI>Full</HI> one, or one that shall not fall <HI>short</HI> in many Instances? Behol∣ding so much of <HI>New-England,</HI> from eve∣ry Quarter, under such Characters, here come together, I shall take this opportu∣nity, to bespeak your <HI>Hearty Praises</HI> to the Almighty God, for <HI>So Dealing with</HI> New-England <HI>as not with any Nation.</HI> And I have now chosen a Subject, that one, would think should be of all, the least liable to Cavilling Objections, and Excep∣tions.

<P>But I cannot introduce the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of the <HI>Matchless Favours,</HI> wherein our God <HI>hath so dealt with us, as not with any Nation.</HI> Until you have had some Re∣marks
<PB N="7" REF="000930_0006_0FACA35AADD89668"/>
upon the Nature, and Meaning, and Ingredients of those <HI>Hearty Praises,</HI> which we are to render unto the Al∣mighty for His <HI>Matchless Favours.</HI></P>
<P>You will Remember then, That in our <HI>Hearty Praises</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, for His <HI>Match∣less Favours,</HI> we are to Confess, to Admire, to Adore those <HI>Glories</HI> of God which are Conspicuous and Illustrious in His <HI>Favours.</HI> The <HI>Power,</HI> the <HI>Wisdom,</HI> the <HI>Mercy,</HI> and the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of the Great God, gloriously <HI>Shine forth</HI> in His <HI>Dealing so with us, as not with any Nation.</HI> The <HI>Glories</HI> of God, that His <HI>Dealings,</HI> do tes∣tifie and certifie, and signalize unto us, <HI>These</HI> we must very distinctly <HI>Sound forth,</HI> with <HI>His High Praises in our mouth.</HI></P>
<P>But then, you will also Remember, that we are utterly <HI>unworthy</HI> of these <HI>Matchless Favours,</HI> for which we offer up unto God our <HI>Hearty Praises.</HI> When we Reflect on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Dealings</HI> of our God with us, we fearfully add unto our own <HI>unwor∣thiness,</HI> if we don't sensibly▪ say with our Father <HI>Jacob▪ Lord, we are not worthy of the Least of all these Mercies.</HI> Truly, 'tis not because we are better than any <HI>other Nation,</HI> that our God hath <HI>so dealt with

us, as not with any Nation.</HI> We are more <HI>vile</HI> than every <HI>other Nation,</HI> if we don't own our selves <HI>as vile,</HI> as <HI>any Nation</HI>▪ When God had <HI>so dealt</HI> with His people of old, as <HI>not with any Nation,</HI> He, to re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und and confound the <HI>vain Thoughts</HI> of <HI>pride</HI> in them, told them, Deut. 7.7, 8. <HI>The Lord did not set his Love upon you, be∣cause ye were more in Number than any people, (for ye were the fewest of all peo∣ple) but because the Lord Loved you.</HI> Such in <HI>Idem per Idem,</HI> is very good sense, in he Language of <HI>Soveraign Grace; The Lord Loved you, meerly because He Loved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou!</HI> Even so; 'Tis the meer <HI>Soveraign Grace</HI> of the God, <HI>who does all things ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ording to the Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l of his own Will,</HI> that hath <HI>so Dealt with the English Nation as n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with any Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion.</HI> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Ancestors were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, wretched, rue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul Pagans, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur <HI>Indians</HI>; and there are now the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in our <HI>Nation</HI>▪ that there are in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hore <HI>Enslaved Neighbours,</HI> that are under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Houses of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> or of <HI>Austria</HI>▪ Why as the Lord <HI>so Dealt</HI> with thee, O <HI>New-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngland, as not with any Nation!</HI> The very <HI>Iottantots</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> and <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iba's</HI> on <HI>Flo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>da</HI> are a <HI>Nation</HI> as worthy of the Divine

<P>Finally; You will Remember, That we don't offer up <HI>Hearty Praises</HI> unto God, for His <HI>Matchless Favours,</HI> if they be not <HI>Active Praises.</HI> When we Reflect on the <HI>Dealings</HI> of our God, with us, there is that ingenuous Question to be thought upon; <HI>Psal.</HI> 116.12. <HI>What shall we render to the Lord▪ for all His Benefits!</HI> Hath our God <HI>so dealt with us, as not with any Nation?</HI> We are then to study fit <HI>Returns</HI> of <HI>Gratitude,</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> wherein we shall exceed every <HI>other Na∣tion</HI> 'Tis not a formal saying, <HI>Thanks be to God!</HI> that will serve to Express our <HI>Thanks</HI> unto Him, for <HI>so dealing with us, as not with any Nation.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Thanks doing,</HI> and <HI>Thanks living,</HI> that must Express our <HI>Thanks.</HI> Without some agreeable <HI>Fruit∣fulness</HI> in our Conversations, we have no True <HI>Thankfulness.</HI> We are then to think, <HI>What are the Fruits now Expected from a Nation, with whom God hath so dealt as,

not with any Nation?</HI> What must be our <HI>Fruitfulness,</HI> that we may still <HI>Enjoy,</HI> and not <HI>Forfeit</HI> the <HI>Bounties</HI> of God?</P>

<P>And here, concerning the Constituti∣on, of the <HI>Country</HI> it self, where <HI>the Most High hath divided, unto us our Inheritance,</HI> I will not say, God hath <HI>so dealt with us, as not with any Nation</HI>; But this If may say, There is many a <HI>Nation</HI> that is not near so well accommodated.

<P>First, Our <HI>Subsistence,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t has been al∣most by <HI>Miracle</HI>: Our God has <HI>not so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with any Nation.</HI> How strangely was the Settlement of <HI>New England</HI> at first brought forward, and at last brought about; When God <HI>brought a Nation out of the midst of a Nation!</HI> There were some Occurrences in that Thing, which would make that Challenge not unreasonable, Deut. 4.32 <HI>Ask now of the Dayes that are past, which were before thee, since the Day that God Created man upon the Earth, and ask from the one side of Heaven unto the o∣ther, whether there have been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?</HI> And ever since the Settlement, how strangely have we been Relieved, Sup∣ported, Supplied in our frequent, and frightful Exigencies? We have often been in very sore <HI>Distresses</HI>; but being Distress'd, <HI>This poor people has cried unto the Lord, who hath heard and sav'd,</HI> with most seasonable and unexpected Salvations.

Deut 4 7. <HI>What Nation is there, that hath God so Nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things, that we call upon him for?</HI> There have been formidable Attempts of Satan and his Sons, to <HI>Unsettle</HI> us: But what an overwhelming <HI>Blast</HI> from Hea∣ven has, defeated all those Attempts?

and many an one of more general con∣sequence than <HI>That</HI>! But the <HI>Tribulation for Ten Dayes,</HI> which we then had, in a variety of <HI>Calamities,</HI> afforded us a vast variety of <HI>Experiences,</HI> upon which we might set up our further <HI>Ebenezers.</HI> Es∣caped <HI>New-England,</HI> may with exceed∣ing Wonderment, cry out, <HI>Having obtain∣ed Help from God, I continue to this Day</HI>!

<P>But then, Secondly, In the <HI>Government</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et over us, we may and must say it, <HI>Our God has done Great Things for us</HI>!</P>
<P>It is no Little Blessing of God, that

we are a part of the <HI>English Nation.</HI> Our Dependence on, and Relation to, that brave <HI>Nation,</HI> that man deserves not the Name of an <HI>English man,</HI> who despises it.

<P>And if it be a <HI>Matchless Favour</HI> of our God unto us, that we have our claim to <HI>English Liberties,</HI> (though our <HI>Task masters</HI> Twelve years ago, told us we had <HI>None!</HI>) Let us not be insensi∣ble of His <HI>Matchless Favour</HI> unto us, (for it is <HI>Now so</HI>!) that we have a claim to the KING of <HI>England,</HI> as having these Dominions also under His Auspicious Influences.</P>

by the Voice of all the good peo∣ple therein, a KING, whose <HI>Royal Ver∣tues</HI> are such, that we may truly say, <HI>God hath not so dealt with any Nation</HI>: As the <HI>English Nation</HI> is the most Glorious of any under Heaven, so there is no <HI>Na∣tion,</HI> that can boast of such a KING, as ours! A KING Raised by Heaven, to save <HI>Three Kingdoms</HI> from the <HI>Chains</HI> of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery</HI> that were <HI>Treacherous∣ly</HI> prepared for them, and break those that were apace putting upon all <HI>Europe</HI> also: A KING us'd by Heaven, to put an Hook in the <HI>Nostrils</HI> of a <HI>Leviathan,</HI> and make him disgorge at the Peace of <HI>Ryswick,</HI> Cities and Countreys, which contain as much in Bigness, as all the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI>: A KING, whose <HI>Royal Assent</HI> unto sundry <HI>Acts of Parlia∣ment,</HI> has advanc'd the <HI>English Nation,</HI> unto <HI>Priviledges,</HI> richly worth all the millions of Money, that have been spent since the <HI>Revolution</HI>; and the <HI>Scotch Na∣tion</HI> is likewise Restored unto its Desired Faelicity.

<P>When the KING, Resolving to <HI>Favour</HI> us, with a most Exact <HI>Image</HI> of His own <HI>Royal Vertues,</HI> in a GOVERNOUR, gave His Commission unto the truly No∣ble Earl of BELLOMONT for the <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> of these Plantations, we were from almost every Quarter told, That the Nobility of <HI>Three Kingdoms</HI> could not have afforded a person more charming∣ly Agreeable: But since His Excellency's Happy Arrival, we now find, <HI>That the One half was never told us.</HI> You will pardon me, <HI>My Lord,</HI> if I call upon my people to Bless God, and Thank the King, for Your EXCELLENCY, when I am reckoning up the Things, wherein we are <HI>so Dealt withal, as not any Nation.</HI> I do not forget that I am standing in a place, very near Heaven, in which, more than in any under Heaven, <HI>Flatter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> would be offensive: to <HI>My Maker.</HI> Yea, I do Believe, our▪ GOVERNOUR Him∣self, hath so much of the Great <HI>Constan∣tine</HI> in him, that I could not more <HI>Offend</HI> Him, than by going to <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter</HI> him.

Nevertheless, I Judge, it would be no less than a <HI>Sinful Omission</HI> in me, if I should not reckon our GOVERNOUR, among the <HI>Matchless Favours</HI> of our God unto us. I am not <HI>Praising</HI> of Him; for in the Langua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of a <HI>Divine,</HI> I must call to mind, that he is <HI>Nothing,</HI> but what GOD makes him to be: But I am urg∣ing you, to the <HI>Praising</HI> of GOD for Him.

was a publick Officer, at whose House many people every day <HI>gratis</HI> received Reliefs and Soccours.
