Of which fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Citations I shall in this place produce one, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t one, referring thee to the following book for a view of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re of them; It is in <HI>Number 58,</HI> where he quotes <HI>William P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> his <HI>Sandy Foundation p 20,</HI> saying; <HI>W. P there ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s the man Christ, The finite impotent Creature</HI>: Whereas there is no such saying or irreverent expression in the whole book: for where <HI>W. P.</HI> uses the words. <HI>Finite and impotent Creature,</HI> The subject he was there treating of plainly shews, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n be meant it of us sinners that need forgiveness; but not of the Man Christ who never sinned. Than which, what greater abuse could be put upon any mans writings?</P>
<P><HI>Reader,</HI> The substance of this book was wrote near two years ago, but being backward in my self to appear in print, as also the press being long expected here before it came, and when come taken up with other important matters interve∣ning, occasioned the delay of its publication till now.</P>
<P>As for the Errours of the press, which are many, especi∣ally in the former part of the book; and more especially in one place, which is very material to be corrected, without which it will read so, as will m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e it look very gross, and appear to
<PB REF="000948_0003_0FAD964221EF4D38"/>
be false <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; it is in p. <HI>17</HI>: l. <HI>9,</HI> where after, <HI>works sake</HI> the Printer hath omitted, <HI>but for his sake,</HI> which words are in the written copy by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e printed it. I must desire thee (<HI>Reader</HI>) upon occasion to take the trouble of turning to the <HI>Errata,</HI> where I hope thou will find the most material collected. The chief occasion of there being so many errours, was, the Printer being a man of another nation and language, as also not bred to that employment, consequent∣ly something unexpert both in language and calling, and the corrector's not being so frequently at hand as the case required, all which I desire thou wouldst favourably consider.</P>
<P>The Intent of publishing this, was chiefly to prevent any from being deceived, and also to undeceive those that may have been already deceived by this unfair, man's abusive book; for such it is, and as such, let it be added to the Catalogue of those many envious and abusive writings, that have been sent forth in∣to the world, from time to time, to hinder the spreading of truth, and the progress of Gods people in the way of it: all which will surely be accounted for one day, and not witstanding all which, the truth remains the same, and I am satisfied will more and more spread it self, and prevail, in and upon and the hearts spirits of people, notwithstanding the vari∣ous and restless attempts of its Opposers, to hinder it. And as the way of its working, is to cleanse and purify mankind in soul, body and spirit, and make them fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> temples for God to dwell in, by virtue of his holy spirit in us and also entitle us effectually, to partake of the great and un∣speakable benefit, that accrues to mankind, by that one offering of our Lord Jesus Christ, on the tree of the Cross: So it is highly necessary that we more and more come to experience this cleansing work to be wrought in us, in order to be entitu∣led to those afore said benefits. For although our blessed Lord Jesus Christ then offered up himself for the sins of the whole world, yet we read of none, who <HI>by that offering are for ever perfected,</HI> but <HI>those who are sanctified.</HI> Heb. <HI>10:14.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SATANS HARBINGER ENCOUNTERED &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Before I come to the <HI>Book</HI> it self, I shall touch a little upon the <HI>Preface,</HI> and begin with an expression or <HI>Da∣niel Leeds's,</HI> which runs thus.
<Q>It is my real belief, That the <HI>Quakers</HI> at first came forth in life and power, and made a good beginning.</Q></P>
<P>Answer. Did they so? How comes it then to pass, that the first Instruments of that good beginning in life and power, as <HI>G. Fox, G. Whitehead, E. Bourough, R. Habberth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn, Is. Pennington &amp;c.</HI> and their antient works and Writings, must be thus brought upon the stage, by this <HI>Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el Leeds</HI> himself, even in this very book, endeavouring thereby to prove their doctrine false, inconsistent, and little less than a meer heap of confusion? Can such things be an effect of <HI>life and power?</HI> And if he say, They lost that <HI>life and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wer</HI> again, before those books were written: It may then be observed, how in the same Page he insinuates, as if the loo∣sing of it again,
<Q>was through their contending with one another about trifles and Ceremonies, instituting this and that order, and getting into form &amp;c.</Q>
Whereas it is well known, that many of the above named Friends Books were written before the <HI>Institution</HI> of those <HI>Orders,</HI> (as he calls them). Besides, I find in a Paper entitulad <HI>A breif Admoni∣tion &amp;c.</HI> (delivered to Friends here at the yearly meeting in the year 1696., Which as I am credibly informed) was written by <HI>Daniel Leeds,</HI> there being also the two letters of his name, with two letters more subschribed to it) after having expressed what an healthy flourishing Country this was about eight years before, this passage, viz
<Q>Doubtless it might have so continued, if the kernell of life and love had not took wing &amp;c.</Q>
Now hence I observe, That (accor∣ding to this aknoledgement (for such it is implicitely at
<PB N="2" REF="000948_0005_0FAD9643A1E0B2F0"/>
least) the kernel of life and love had not took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng be∣fore the Year 1688; yet most of the books he quotes were written long before that time. But surely no orderly sensible man will imagine, that order and form amongst God's Peo∣ple, will occasion the life and powet to withdraw, whilst the power is not denyed: Is not <HI>God a God of order?</HI> And doth not the <HI>Apostel</HI> say to the <HI>Corinthians? Let all things be done decently and in order</HI> 1 Cor. 14:40. Moreover if <HI>the life and love took Wings,</HI> but about or since the jear 1688, how could those <HI>Orders</HI> which were established above twen∣ty years before be the occasion of it? Again, what Orders have We that they disown? Have We Montly meetings? So have they. Have We Yearly meetings? So have they? Have We Womens meetings? <HI>Daniel Leeds</HI> saith,
<Q>Those Meetings are certainly of service in Deeds of Charity and Hospitality, page 66.</Q></P>
<P>But to proceed, he concludes that page and begins the next with this passage viz,
<Q>When my intentions were first set on this ensuing work, I had taken <HI>G, K's.</HI> books in e∣qually with the rest or else I should have been partial as <HI>Caleb Pasey</HI> has been [<HI>being blinded with prejudice,</HI> as his term is] in only faulting <HI>G. K's</HI> books, but not his Oppo∣sers; but as I proceeded on, at lenght I found <HI>G. K.</HI> (ac∣cording to the example of good men in all Ages) has pu∣blickly acknowledged himself guilty of Errors in divers of his former books, and promised a correction of the same; and now of late we have his Retractation come over in Print.</Q></P>
<P>Answ. A meer flam: For among all the contradictions that we have charged and proved upon him, he has been so far from retracting any part of them, though they contra∣dict his present doctrine, that he boasts in the very Retract∣ing book it self, <HI>That for the most part they are the soundest passages in all his book, and that he can shew a good consistency of them with his present faith.</HI> See pa. 42:43. And now, since <HI>Daniel Leeds</HI> in the close of his Preface asserts his <HI>pro∣ceedings</HI> in his book <HI>to be honest and sincere</HI>; I appeal to all impartial people Since <HI>G. K's</HI> doctrines as charged by us, do
<PB N="3" REF="000948_0006_0FAD964757362768"/>
greatly contradict each other; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et he refuses to retract <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> part of them, Whether I said <HI>G. Ks.</HI> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e other things▪ which probably <HI>D. L.</HI> had no thought about wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he wrote his book, can be any argument in sincerity and truth, for his not taking in <HI>G. Ks.</HI> books, as wel as others, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this wrangling piece of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>As for his counting me <HI>Partial,</HI> because I have not <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> G. K's. Opposers,</HI> as well as <HI>G. K.</HI> I answer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f by <HI>G. K's.</HI> opposers, he mean our Friends, I never had seen cause to be so scrutinous, as <HI>D. L.</HI> hath been, in searching, either into our Friends books or <HI>G. K's.</HI> either, till since that time any farther than what related to the Controversy which <HI>G. K.</HI> had raised amongst us here; and chiefly that about the uni∣versal neccessity of the knowledge of <HI>Christ</HI> in the outward, in order to salvation, without our acknowledging of which I found he would not own the most upright amongst us, to be any better than <HI>Heathens.</HI> Now, upon a time, looking into <HI>G. K's. Universal free Grace of the Gospel,</HI> in pa. 117 I found, that he there would not grant, <HI>That outward know∣ledge, or the knowledge of Christ in the outward was univer∣sally necessary to salvation</HI>; which I presently shewed to an honest Friend, and then a late Friend of his, at <HI>Philadelphia</HI>; and when I came to town again, he told me, he had shew∣ed <HI>G. K.</HI> the passage, and said his answer was to this purpo∣se; <HI>That if h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was in his senses upon his death bed, he would leave it as his last testimony to his Friends about him; That if they should find any thing in his former books, contrary what be now held, they should scrach it out, where they met with it.</HI> Now, had he not presently after this, and after his so uncharitably counting honest Friends to be but Heathens, gone about to perswade his over credulous followers; That he was not changed in his Principles, thereby deceiving and deluding them, should have had no occasion on that account, to have put Pen to Paper, as I did: But I suppose he wa∣rily considered in time; That if he should acknowledge a change in his principles, his New and raw disciples, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alued themselves at that time much upon their being ac∣counted
<PB N="4" REF="000948_0007_0FAD9649E390B898"/>
<HI>Quakers,</HI> and that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a primitive stamp too, would have forsaken him, and his notions also. Well, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n he finds out a way to gloss over this place, and would have us believe, That when he denyed, as aforesaid, the knowled∣ge of <HI>Christ</HI> in the outward to be universally necessary to sal∣vation, his meaning was, that it was not so necessary to salvation begun; as if that difference betwixt our Friends, whom <HI>G. K.</HI> was then vindicating, and other people, was about salvation began only: Yet least that would not do, We must also be told of a distinction, betwixt the express, and the implicite knowledge of <HI>Christ,</HI> and that the express knowledge was not universally necessary, yet the implicite knowledge was. Now these things put me into a farther search, into both his former and latter books, and in his former I still found, where he was concerned to treat of the subject, he alvvais denyed that knovvledge to be essentially necessary to salvation, particularly in his <HI>Umiversal free Grace &amp;c., p.</HI> 117, and <HI>Light of truth triumphant, p.</HI> 6. By his former books, I mean such as bear date before the year 1681. or thereabouts, Which is supposed to be about the time that he wrote (as he acknowledged) 199 of the 200 queries concerning the <HI>Revolution of humane souls &amp;c.</HI> But by his latter books it appears, that he is clearly changed in principle as to the point of doctrine; and I finding things thus, and also how he was receded from his principles in some other matters, wherein he differed with Friends, as About the sufficiency of the Light without something else, and about Preachers being Magistrares, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the confused work he had made about his strange notions of the Resur∣rection, as in my said book is shovvn: This I say, Was the occasion of my Writing that book, that thereby I might shevv to them, especially to the most sincere amongst them, hovv he vvent about to deceive them, by drilling them on, and persvvading them, <HI>we could never prove, he was chaing∣ed in his Principles,</HI> as his ovvn vvords are, see, <HI>Some Fundamental T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uths p:</HI> 13. Printed about the year 1692▪ Wherein he further saith thus;
<Q>I can prove a good consist∣ency
<PB N="5" REF="000948_0008_0FAD964A530C7ED0"/>
of my present doctrine with all [mark all] my for∣mer and latter books.</Q>
Behold now the man; for if this be true, what need he now at a pinch have put out his book of <HI>Retraetations</HI>: why he was driven to it, he must either do it, or else some of his followers might have fallen out with him about it; for some of them were not satis∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with him in that respect; Nay, if we can beleive this D. L. he himself was one of the dissatisfied persons else what makes him say, <HI>He had taken in G. K's. books equal∣ly with the rest, but that he found G. K. had promised a Cor∣rection of them, and that of late his Retraction was come over in prent,</HI> See <HI>D. L.'s.</HI> Preface as before is shewn. But there is one thing more, which I am sure he ought not only to Retract, now his hand is in, but alse deeply to lament, and that is; His so abusing his poor bigotted followers Cas I have already hin∣ted) in his thus deluding them, by so often perswading them, at the first, that he was not changed in his Principles; and when he hath done this, I know not, but as to this point, he may pretty well pass, for such a kind of an honest man, as is so vvith good looking to: But before he dos thus much, I do not see hovv he can be afforded the appellation. And novv to conclude, I do say; that suppose I had seen, and took no∣tice of some passages in our Friends books, which might seem to me like inconsistencys, especially in relation to things not then in controversy, I do not look upon my self equally obliged to expose them, as I did his, which were so palpable, and done for the reason aforesaid.</P>
<P>The next thing I shall take noice of, is, <HI>Daniel Leedss'</HI> pretences in this his <HI>Preface</HI> now be fore me; that
<Q>His pro∣ceeding, here in to expose and publish what follows [in his book] was by emotion heavenly.</Q>
Yet I question not to prove him in his thus doing not only an <HI>Accuser,</HI> but a very false <HI>Accuser of the Brethren</HI>; which to be sure could not proceed from a motion heavenly, and scarse think he can be so infatuated, as to think it did, unless his meaning be; That he was influenced in this action, by the motion of the starrs, that are placed in that firmament of huven, and
<PB N="6" REF="000948_0009_0FAD964B28144100"/>
yet if his meaning be such, it will by no means deserve the credit, that was given to his Idle prediction, publi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in his Almanack for the jear 1695, where he saith;
<Q>All lovers of truth are to take notie, that from and after the 25. of <HI>January,</HI> no person shall find it safer shrouding under the name and denomination of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> than under the name of any other profession of <HI>Christianity</HI> what soever &amp;c.</Q>
For we have all along known▪ that no person not only from and after the month he calls <HI>January,</HI> but at no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> else, hath been, is, or will be any thing the safer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or their being under the denomination of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> and more than that <HI>D.L.s</HI> words be true, were he saies, <HI>his pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ceedings</HI> in this his book was from <HI>a motion heavenly</HI> and that's not at all.</P>
<P>I come now to his book, which he begins under the title of an Introduction, in p: 3. <HI>D. L.</HI> fearing that such licke <HI>seeming contradictions</HI> as he alledges against our <HI>Friends books</HI> might be found <HI>in the scriptures,</HI> he strugles hard before hand to guard against it, by telling us. <Q>They, them∣selves
in their books gave that reason why 'tis so with the scriptures bringing reasons to prove them not the same as given forth, but altered and corrupted. Now this cannot be alledged of their books, decause we have the first im∣pression of them, and there fore they cannot be altered or corrupted.</Q></P>
<P>Answ. Is he there At 'this rate then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s abouts; if he should charge seeming contradictions upun us, for saying this on the one hand, and that on the other, and we can prove the both sides are according to scripture, yet it seems the must not be allowed, because our Friends, have told, how some scriptures have been altered and corrupted, which few professing <HI>Christianity</HI> I suppose vvill deny to be true; never the less, if for the reason the <HI>Quaker</HI> must not bring scriptrre to prove vvhat he hath vvritten, vvhy may not any one else be denyed so to do, in defene of any truth vvhat soever, and so at this rate, any Opposers of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rest truths, may deny any scripture that may be urged
<PB N="7" REF="000948_0010_0FAD964BD6CC5D60"/>
to convince him of his Errour. Well but do our Friends say that some scriptures have been altered and corrupted▪ What does <HI>D. L's.</HI> friend G. <HI>K.</HI> say less in a passage in one
of his books, not yet reracted; vvhere he hath it thus viz <Q>I hope it may be vvithout offence not only queried but also concluded, that the translations of the scripture have divers additions, which men have added without any pretence to divine inspiration: Nor are there wanting di∣vers, both judicious and learned men, so accounted, of good repute, even among <HI>Protestants</HI> who do acknowledge, that some particular words have dropt in to the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew</HI> text, since their first writing &amp;c. All which being granted, yet do not hinder but that the purity of the scripture is sufficiently preserved, viz, in respect of the main and necessary things: See <HI>Truths Defence</HI> p: 59 and 60 &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>And so we say too, see <HI>W.</HI> p<HI>'s Rejoinder</HI> q: 38:39. Now if <HI>D. L.</HI> can make appear, that any scripture that we have brought, or may bring, to prove any truth, be altered or corrupted, he may do it, or else what he hath said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> affects us more than it doth <HI>G. K.</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Christianity.</HI> I shall there fore pro∣ceed to put <HI>D. L.</HI> in mind that at this rate all <HI>Protestants</HI> may be deprived of what proofs they usually bring against <HI>Popish</HI> Innovations. And suppose a Friend, upon any occa∣sion, should exhort people to <HI>serve the Lord with fear &amp;c,</HI> and upon another occasion should tell them, <HI>they might serve him without fear all the daies of their lives,</HI> and should bring <HI>Psal.</HI> 2:11. for the one, and <HI>Luke</HI> 1.74▪ for the other: Now I would know of <HI>D.

<P>Besides, this suppositious excuse of <HI>D. L</HI>'s. suggested in the name of some preachers of late, with his paraphrases therein, will not cover his dishonesty, nor cloak his gross perversions and corrupt citatiens. Do the <HI>Quakers</HI> say that <HI>the scriptures in some places are alterred and corupted?</HI> What then? Will it therefore follow, that they must excuse <HI>D.

Is the scrip∣ture in <HI>English</HI> a translation out of other language, conse∣quently but a copy, liable to mistakes in transcribing and translating, as well as printing; And the Quakers books the original impression?

<P>I come now to his quotations out of our Friends books, which he has placed in two columns, under the notion of contradictions, which, how far he proves them so to be, or how far he falls short of proof, as also how honestly or how dishonestly he deals with them, will appear in the following examination of them (or at least of so many of them as may give the Reader a sufficient tast of the rest; I not having all the friends books quoted on both sides by me) and my remarks thereon, by way of answer thereunto.</P>
<P>I begin first which page 7 (it should be 6) where he quotes <HI>W P</HI>'s <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> p. 22. thus.
<Q>Since <HI>Christ</HI> could not pay what was not his own [Debt] it follows, that in the pay∣ment of his own, the case still remains equally grievou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, since the debt is not hereby absolved or forgiven, but trans∣ferred only.</Q>
Now to this <HI>D.</HI>L. opposes <HI>G.W</HI>'s <HI>Divinity of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st</HI> in answer to <HI>Tho Danson</HI> p. 16 thus;
<Q>How false and blasphe∣mous this charge is against <HI>Christ,</HI> I appeal to all sober Pro∣fessours of Christianity, viz. That when God required satis∣faction of <HI>Christ,</HI> it was due from <HI>Christ.</HI></Q> Upon which <HI>D. L.</HI> makes this observation, viz.
<Q>That as before (Saith he) <HI>W. P.</HI> renders <HI>Geo. Whitehead</HI>'s head's doctrine ridiculous and shame∣ful,
so here <HI>G.W.</HI> renders <HI>W Penn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> doctrine blasphemous▪ for holding, that <HI>Christ</HI> had a debt of his own to satisfy to God &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> It were well if <HI>D. L.</HI> woud be ashamed as he ought to be, of his thus ridiculously and shamefully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>W. P,</HI> by his so basely adding in crotchets the word, [De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>] to <HI>W. P.</HI>'s. words, which is neither <HI>W. P</HI>'s. word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> much as deducible from his doctrine or argument: So th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is but a meer crotchet of <HI>D. L's.</HI> envious brain, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>G. W.</HI> and <HI>W. P.</HI> inconsistent with each other, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to misrepresent <HI>W. P,</HI> as if he beleived, that <HI>Christ</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of sin, when he suffered for our sins; which, as that pas∣sage of <HI>W. P's.</HI> shows no such thing; so the same page pro¦ves
<PB N="10" REF="000948_0013_0FAD964E4BCCC080"/>
the contrary; for the whole Page is cheifly to shew the ridiculous consequences that attend the rigid <HI>Presbyterian</HI> doctrine, of it's being impossible for God to pardon sins upon repentance, without a plenary satisfaction made by another, which consequences <HI>W.</HI> P. calls <HI>Irreligious and Irrational</HI> in 9. respects, the 3d. of which is
<Q>That it was unworthy of God to pardon but not to inflict punishment on the innocent, or require a satisfaction where there was nothing due.</Q>
Now mark, These words plainly imply that <HI>W. P.</HI> counted <HI>Christ</HI> innocent▪ and that there was nothing of debt due from him, which spoils <HI>D. L's.</HI> pretended contradiction. Besides, was it likely that <HI>W. P.</HI> must needs, by <HI>his own,</HI> mean <HI>Christ's</HI> own debt, and so render <HI>Christ</HI> a sinner? A very idle construction; for suppose <HI>Christ</HI> had a debt to pay, according to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> strict rigid sence, must it needs follow from thence, that the debt was his own▪ and so paid it as being due from him? Nothing less: For is it not common among men, for a man to pay a debt for his Friend, which though he pay with his own, yet the debt was not due from him; Even so, <HI>Christ laid down his live for our sins,</HI> but yet not to pay any debt of his own, for as <HI>W. P.</HI> there saith <HI>there was no</HI> such <HI>thing due from him</HI>; no, he laid down his live its true, but it was for us, he was <HI>wounded</HI> but it was <HI>for our transgressions,</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> him self saith, <HI>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends</HI> John. 15.13. Nay though it had been to pay a debt in the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> strict and rigid sense (which as I said was what▪ <HI>W. P.</HI> there dis∣cussed) yet it was not his own debt, though it was his own life he paid it with, as he himself said, <HI>I lay down my life for the sheep</HI> John 10.15. and if for the sheep, then not to pay a debt of his own, and that that is <HI>W. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> genuine sense in that place, I suppose no unprejudiced man will deny; and I charge <HI>D. L.</HI> with most base forgery in this place, for his adding the word [debt] to <HI>W. P's.</HI> words, thereby quite altering the true and real intent of them.</P>
<P>But again, He has as basely rendered, well as falsely quoted
<PB N="11" REF="000948_0014_0FAD965160FD1180"/>
<HI>VV. P.</HI> p. 5. where he hath it thus
<Q><HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> p. 14. <HI>VV. Penn.</HI> saith, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the only God is the Father and <HI>Christ</HI> be the only God, then is <HI>Christ</HI> the Father; which is ridi∣culous and shamefull.</Q>
Now here again I flatly charge him with most grossly perverting <HI>VV. P's.</HI> words sense and mean∣ing, for though <HI>VV. P.</HI> saies If that the only God is the "Father and <HI>Christ</HI> be that only God, then is <HI>Christ</HI> the Fath∣er: yet that he there called this <HI>ridiculous and shamefull</HI> I absolutely deny, and it lies upon <HI>D. L.</HI> to prove, for the place proves it not, and if <HI>D. L·</HI> write again about it, I would advise him, to insert the whole paragraph, that it may be seen, whether any such thing be so much as deducible from what <HI>VV.</HI> P. there saith. And now let me tell him, there needs no <HI>carious wire drawing mincing nor mangling</HI> as he in p, 43. insinuates we should be forced to in our answer to him, to manifest his abuse to W. P. in this matter. Neither was there any occasion for <HI>D. L.</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>agree∣ing upon a consistent Creed,</HI> but if he write again, let it be what is agreeable with honesty, and consistent with truth, that honest men may stand by him in it.</P>
<P>In p: 4 (it should be 7) DL saith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> v In <HI>Dirinity of Christ</HI> "by <HI>G.</HI> W. and G.
Fox,<Q> <HI>they begin in the Epistle with commanding and charging Professours to bring express scripture for their Doctrine saying,</HI> Whether do the scriptures speak of three persons in the Godhead, in these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpress words? And where doth the scripture speak of a humane nature of Christ in heaven?</Q>
&amp;c. A little lower <HI>D. L.</HI> saith
<Q>Now may not the Professours say, Come <HI>G.</HI> W. Come <HI>Quakers</HI> where doth the scripture say, the distinction of Father and Son is not only nominal, but real.</Q>
He having in p. 4. cited these as <HI>G.</HI> W<HI>'s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> words.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We know that those Professors would have tyed our friends up to those very terms of three persons, and also human nature of Christ in heaven &amp;c. And yet at the same time, blamed them for not calling the scriptures the only rule of faith. So that since they would needs tye our Friends up to those very words, twas but reasonable they
<PB N="12" REF="000948_0015_0FAD9652C53ADE00"/>
should be held to their Rule to prove them by. But as for <HI>G. VV.</HI>'s saying, the distinction of the Father and Son is not only nominal but real; I question not, if the Father Word and Spirit be owned to be one God, but <HI>G. VV.</HI> will rest satisfied, without disiring to impose the words nominal and real on any man, though he might use them to satisfie the enquirer. But since <HI>D. L.</HI> would make us beleive he is impartial in relation to G. <HI>K,</HI> why must the <HI>Quakers</HI> be thus struck at, and <HI>G.

<Q>That it is not safe to leave the scripture words, and go to words of mans wisdom, and thereby declare our faith of Christian doctrine.</Q>
And yet doth not the same <HI>G. K,</HI> make abundant use of other words in managing of Controversy, and plead for it too, as in his book called <HI>Antichrists and Sadducees detected</HI> &amp;c. in p. 19. Where he saith,
<Q>I see not why I should be so confined to exspres scripture words in things that I re∣quire no man to own or believe as Articles of faith, but leave them to their liberty &amp;c.</Q>
And now I dare say <HI>G. VV.</HI> and all sensible Friends will say as much.</P>
<P>The next quotation or <HI>D. L.</HI>'s I take notice of is out of <HI>G. F's Great M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stery p:</HI> 264 &amp;c. cited by him in his p: 10 thus;
<Q><HI>Priest sayes,</HI> A man by his own power cannot get into regeneration, for they are dead in sins and trespasses <HI>G. F.</HI> replies, some are sanctified from the womb, and some children are holy; so all are not dead in sins and trespasses &amp;c.</Q>
Now to this he opposes <HI>G VV</HI>'s <HI>Divinity of Christ</HI> in answer to <HI>T. D.</HI> p. 20: thus;
<Q><HI>G: VV</HI>: saies, Condemnation came upon all men—Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned p: 21: Again, <HI>Christ</HI> died for all, so all were dead in sins and trespasses &amp;c.</Q>
<HI>Answ:</HI> That <HI>some are sancti∣fied from the womb</HI> according to <HI>G: F:</HI> is but according to scripture, see <HI>Jerem:</HI> 1:5: <HI>Luke</HI> 1:15: and 1 <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 7:15: And also that <HI>condemnation and death came upon all men</HI> according to <HI>G▪ VV:</HI> is also according to scripture, see <HI>Rom:</HI> 12:18, and so according to <HI>D: L.</HI> may not the scripture be charged

with contradiction in that respect, as well as <HI>G: F:</HI> and <HI>G: VV:</HI> Then; whereas <HI>G: F:</HI> said, <HI>all are not</HI> (mark [are not] which is in the present tense) <HI>dead in sins and trespasses,</HI> it doth not at all contradict what <HI>D.

VV</HI>'s, <HI>that all were dead in sins and trespasses</HI> [were, being the time past] (tho by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, let the <HI>Reader</HI> take notice, that I can find no such words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he place cited by <HI>D. L,</HI> as <HI>G.

<P>In his p: 12 he quotes <HI>W: P</HI>'s <HI>Christian Quaker,</HI> thus,
<Q>Now nothing can bruise the head of the Serpent but some∣thing that is also internal, as the Serpent is; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut if the body of <HI>Christ</HI> were the seed, then could he not bruise the serpents head in all, because the body of <HI>Christ</HI> is not so much as in any one &amp;c</Q>
Whom he would make <HI>T. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wood</HI> to oppose in <HI>Foundation of Tythes</HI> &amp;c p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.240▪ thus,
<Q>Nor do the <HI>Quakers</HI> ascribe salvation to the following the light within, but to <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> to whom the light leads—If any one expect Remission of sins by any other way than by the death of <HI>Christ</HI> renders the death of <HI>Christ</HI> useless.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I do affirm if <HI>D: L,</HI> or any other, comes to know the serpents head bruised in any measure, it must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y some thing internal, neither doth what <HI>T: E.</HI> hath said as above, any waies contradict it: For though we ascribe not our salvation [to our own following of <HI>Christ</HI>] who is <HI>the light of the world,</HI> according to: <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ellwood,</HI> yet that

follows not, but thath <HI>Christ the Light of the world</HI> is he <HI>thath bruises the Serpents head,</HI> and to ascribe our salvation to <HI>Christ the light of the world,</HI> who appears internally, in order there to, is one thing, and to ascribe it to our works, which <HI>Tho. Ellwood</HI> and all sound Friends deny, is another thing. For allthough the Apostle <HI>know nothing by him self</HI> (which is a large degree of growth) <HI>yet there by he was not justified</HI> 1 Cor: 4:4. Nevertheless the same Apostle saith, <HI>By grace ye are saved and thath not of Your selves it is the gift of God</HI> Eph: 2:8. Yet this is no contradiction. And though the Apostle saith <HI>We are reconciled by his death,</HI> yet he also saith, <HI>we are saved by his life</HI> Rom: 5:10, which life is internal: For <HI>in him was life and the life was the light of men</HI> Iohn. 1:4. Neither do we read of any whom Christ <HI>hath forever pefected,</HI> but <HI>those who are sanctified</HI> Heb 10:14. Now thath this doctrine of <HI>Christ</HI> the seed's bruising the head of the serpent inwardly, is owned by <HI>D. L's</HI> great Friend <HI>G: K,</HI> as wel as by <HI>W: P,</HI> is clear from his <HI>Way cast up</HI> p: 99. not yet retracted, thus expessed,
<Q>Though the outward coming of the man <HI>Christ,</HI> was deferred ac∣cording to his outward birth in the flesh, for many years, yet from the beginning, this heavenly man, the promised seed, did inwardly [mark inwardly] come in to the heart, and bruise the head of the serpent.</Q>
Come novv <HI>D: L,</HI> if thou art impartial, as thou pretendest, and art not blinded with partiality and prejudice, lay this which thou idly callest a contradiction in <HI>VV: P.</HI> and <HI>T: E,</HI> at <HI>G: K's</HI> door also: For here he owns the seed which bruises the serpents head to be inward, as vvell as <HI>VV: P</HI>; and that he owns the very same passage of <HI>T: E,</HI> may appear, by his brin∣ging those two very quotations, to prove his doctine con∣sistent with Friends doctrine, in his book called <HI>Heresy</HI> and <HI>Hatred</HI> p: 9.</P>
<P>His necxt lash is upon the matter answered by the foregoing: For as <HI>Christ</HI> the light is the salvation of all that believe, according to G: <HI>F</HI>; so we ascribe our salvation to him alone, according to <HI>T: E,</HI> and this is no contradiction,
<PB N="15" REF="000948_0018_0FAD9654D94C16E8"/>
Alas poor <HI>Daniel!</HI> How far is he gone in to prejudice and blindness, to represent these things as unreconcilable: For upon this, he calls and cry's out "Come, let's see if T: <HI>Ellwood</HI> with al his sophistry and false glosses can recon∣cile these two assertions. Alas poor man! does he want to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve Sophistry and false glosses reconcile sound assertions, while he with his pretended motion heavenly counts them contradictions· But for the sake of some, I shal a little il∣lustrate this matter, with this comparison: Suppose a sub∣ject were sentenced by his Prince, to be cast in to prison, for some great misdemeanor committed against his per∣son, yet the Prince commiserating his poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> condition, Finds out a way to save him, but upon this condition, that he humbly and thankfully receive the same, and no more live in disobedience to him. Now is not his Prince, in this case, by saving him from his deserved punishment, his Saviour, though he live for the future in all obedience to his Prince's commands; Yet he can not ascribe his being saved from the punishment incurred, to any thing but his Princes clemencey and goodness. Even so, <HI>VVe VVho VVere once dead in our sins and trespasses,</HI> and had incurred the dis∣pleasur of God, ascribe our being saved out of that state, and from the punishment due thereto, to the mercy of God alone through <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> but not to any of our own works.

<Q>4thly The man's mistaken if he suppose that vve plead either the Righteousness of a creature, or mans ovvn Righteousness, vvich he himself is inabled to perform, as the cause of our justification: for Christ th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> strengthens us or enables us, by his povver and spirit dvvelling in us, to do the Fathers vvill, he is the ground and cause of our justifi∣cation, and in him vvho is the beloved are vve accepted, not meerly for our ovvn vvorks or obedience, but for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sake, vvho vvorketh in us, and enables us to do those things vvhich are vvell pleasing in his sight,</Q>
Novv is it not strange that <HI>D, L,</HI> should be so infatuated, as to abuse and find fault vvith such sound doctrine; and so at present I shall leave it as such, but the forgery at <HI>Daniel Leeds</HI>'s door, and come ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to examine, vvhether it contradicts W: P: or not; for as he hath not shevvn us vvherein, so I cannot see hovv he can find out his pretended contadiction, For as G: W: ovvns not mans ovvn Righteousness vvhich he is able to perform of himself, to be the cause of our Justification; so neither doth W: P. say o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ovvn that a man of himself is able to per∣form that actual Righteousness, vvhich is necessary to justi∣fication,

therefore no contradiction: But is it not as found doctrine, to say justification comes by actual richteousness, as it is to say, that <HI>Abraham our Father was justified by works, when he of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered up Isaac his Son</HI> James 2:21.

<P>I now must again call upon <HI>D: L.</HI> to be impartial, for if <HI>W: P.</HI> be guilty of errour here, how can his Friend <HI>G: K.</HI> be sound? For it is one of the false doctrins he charges the <HI>New-England</HI> Professours with;
<Q>That justification is only by <HI>Christ's</HI> righteousness without <HI>us,</HI> imputed to us, and received by faith alone, and not by any righteousness of god and <HI>Christ</HI> infused into us, or wrought in us, </Q>see <HI>Pres∣byterian and Independent &amp;c.</HI> p: 204, not yet retracted, and in his <HI>Looking glass to the Protestants</HI> p: 21,
he saith
<Q>this is our faith, that we are justified by an inward righteous∣ness wrought by the Spirit of God in our hearts.</Q>
What Saist thou now <HI>Daniel?</HI> Can <HI>W: P.</HI> be heterodox in this matter, and <HI>G: K.</HI> orthodox? Be impartial; for this of <HI>G: K's.</HI> is so far from being retracted, that it is by him im∣plicitely justified in the Retractation book it self; For there he denies,
<Q>that he hath retracted or renounced any one assertion in any one of his former books, that was judged by him an Article of faith, of which this about justification is one; for saith he: this is our faith, that we are justified by an inward Righteousness &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>His next flingh is grounded cheifly upon his abusing <HI>G: W</HI>'s. words and meaning, as well as that he there in abuseth his Reader, by his forging words in <HI>G. W. s</HI> name which are not <HI>G. W's.</HI> words; but his own as before is shown, and so I shall leave both these misrepresentations of <HI>G. W.</HI> char∣ged to <HI>D.L.'s.</HI> account under the one head of Forgery.</P>
<P>In the same 14th. page he cites W. <HI>P's Rejoinder</HI> p: 287,

thus,
<Q>No present work, how good soever, can justifie any man from the condemnation which is due for the guilt of sin, that is past;</Q>
To which he opposes <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> p: 16, thus,
<Q>God's remission is grounded on our repen∣tance.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> Though <HI>W: P.</HI> saies in the one book, <HI>No present work how good s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever, can justify any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n from the condem∣nation which is due for the guilt of sin that is past.</HI> Yet there is nothing in the other book, that (so much as consequential∣ly) doth say it can: For though it is there said, <HI>That Gods re∣mission is grounded on our re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance</HI>; yet yit is to be observed, that it is called <HI>Gods remission,</HI> and so no present work how good soever, of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs can either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mit or justifie us; for it is Gods remission, and so called by W: <HI>P.</HI> And although W: <HI>P.</HI> saith, it is grounded upon our repentance, yet it is to be un∣derstood in a scriptural sence, and one of the scriptures which <HI>VV: P.</HI> brought to prove what he asserted was 2 Chr. 30·9.
<Q>For if ye turn again unto the Lord, the Lord your God is gracious and mercifull, and will not turn away h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from you.</Q>
Where (saith W: <HI>P.</HI>) how natural is it to observe that Gods remission is grounded on their repentan∣ce; and not that its impossible to pardon, without a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> satisfaction which was his then Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gonist's doctrine; and the several scriptures brought by W: <HI>P.</HI> prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that it was upon <HI>the wicked's returning again to the Lord, that he remitted them, had mercy on them, and abundan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly pardonned them.</HI></P>
<P>Again p. 15 he quotes G. F<HI>'s. Catechism</HI> p: 2
<Q>The light that shews to every man his evil deeds, is <HI>Christ.</HI></Q>
In oppo∣sition to which he produced <HI>W. P s Christian Quaker</HI> p. 91 "We do not say that the light in every man is <HI>Christ,</HI> but of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer:</HI> Tho <HI>G: F.</HI> saies, The light that shews to every man his evil deeds is <HI>Christ,</HI> yet <HI>W. P.</HI> saies nothing to the contrary, so no cnotradiction. And this is certainly true, that the great Light that shews to every man his evil deeds is <HI>Christ,</HI> according to <HI>G: F.,</HI> tho the measure that is contai∣ned
<PB N="19" REF="000948_0022_0FAD9658572487B0"/>
in every man, <HI>W</HI>: P. chuses here rather to call the light of <HI>Christ,</HI> than <HI>Christ</HI> in fulness. And G: K. himself in a late book entituled <HI>Heresy and Hatred</HI> p: 14 say's
<Q>The light within being God and <HI>Christ</HI>;</Q> and yet in the same page he calls it A real measure of the eternal word <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI>
No question but this is sound enough in G: K. though it would scarce be so in us.</P>
<P>He adds a citation out of G: F's <HI>Great mistery</HI> p: 185 viz
<Q>The Devil teacheth them, in whom he sows his seed, not to have the light within them, the seed <HI>Christ,</HI> the Root of God.</Q>
Upon which <HI>D: L.</HI> notes,
<Q>Who must we believe, G: F. or G: W. and W: P.? For here G: F. holds the light within to be not only <HI>Christ,</HI> but even the <HI>Root of God.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> This is partly answered by the foregoing: And whereas G: F. calls the light, the seed <HI>Christ,</HI> it is accord∣ing to Scripture, which saies <HI>Christ is the Light of the world</HI> John 8:12, and also it is said <HI>Gal:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>·16 that <HI>the Seed is Christ</HI>; and whereas G: <HI>F.</HI> saies so o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight withi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is no more than to say, and that in a scriptural sence, <HI>Christ within the hope of glory Coll.</HI> 1:27. and yet in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:7. it is said <HI>But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ</HI>; and surely <HI>D: L.</HI> will not say this is a contradiction. Besides, I remember that <HI>G. K.</HI> in a letter to <HI>John Delaval,</HI> which I have by me in <HI>G. K's</HI> hand writing, in the year 1692, saith;
<Q>To say the man <HI>Christ</HI> is in us, or the light in us is the man <HI>Christ,</HI> I do not contradict it in a true scripture sence, as he is called <HI>the hidden man of the heart,</HI> and <HI>the new man,</HI> but this is a figurative expression, and that in a twofold respect: First by a Metaphor, or Allagory, as he is called <HI>a Lamb, a Lion.</HI> 2dly By <HI>a</HI> Sydechdoche of the giving the name of the whole to the measure.</Q>
Now I say, if <HI>G.K.</HI> be thus allowed to distinguish, why may not <HI>G· F., G: W.</HI> and <HI>VV: P.</HI> and as for <HI>G: F's.</HI> using this expression <HI>The ROOT of God? I ask</HI> Doth not <HI>Paul</HI> also use this expression? viz <HI>The Foun∣dation of God?</HI> 2 Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. 2.19, and as <HI>Christ</HI> is Gods Foun∣dation for us to build upon; so also he is according to <HI>Rom:</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="000948_0023_0FAD9658B1E2D020"/>
11:16:17:18 the <HI>root</HI> for us to grow upon. And <HI>G: K.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his <HI>VVay cast up</HI> p: 114 sais,
<Q>That <HI>Christ</HI> is the Root and vine into which the Saints are grafted.</Q></P>
<P>As to the next clash, It is also partly answered by the foregoing; it relates to something <HI>G: F.</HI> said in answer to a Priest, who commonly in those daies denyed God and <HI>Christ</HI> to be in men according to scripture: Though in this case, I do confess the Priest's words were true in a sence, viz "That whole <HI>Christ,</HI> God and Man is not in men; yet that God is in men is clear according to Scripture, and that <HI>Christ</HI> is in men is clear according to Scripture, and that <HI>Christ</HI> is in men, not only as he is God, but also as man, is clear according to <HI>D: L.'s.</HI> great Friend <HI>G. K.</HI> who in his <HI>VVay cast up</HI> p. 123 saith
<Q>That <HI>Christ</HI> is really present in and among us, not only as he is God, but also as he is man.</Q>
Now since <HI>Christ</HI> as he is God dwelleth in us accord∣ing to Scripture, and as he is man he dwelleth in us ac∣cording to <HI>G.K.</HI> as he is God and man is he not the whole <HI>Christ.</HI> Yet that he doth so dwell in us, as that the whole fulness of the Godhead and manhood is contained in men; I believe, neither <HI>G.F.</HI> not <HI>G.K.</HI> did own, any more than <HI>W.P.</HI> Besides, <HI>G.F.</HI> answer to the Priest was but by way of query, which does not alwaies conclude a judgement▪ For when <HI>Christ</HI> asked the Pharisees, <HI>what think ye of</HI> Christ? <HI>whose son is he? they said unto him, The son of</HI> David; Christ answered by way of query, <HI>How then doth</HI> David <HI>in spirit call him Lord</HI> Matt. 22.42:43. Now by this his answer, <HI>Christ</HI> did not deny himself to be the Son of <HI>David</HI>; for that would have contradicted the scripture, which calls him the son of <HI>David</HI> &amp;c. Matt. 1:1. And so <HI>G.F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> asking a question, cannot be said to be a denyal of <HI>W.P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> assertion, therefore no contradiction.</P>
<P>I come now to his p: 17:18, to what he cites from <HI>G.F</HI> about the soul. To which I say, 1st. It hath been often answered by our Friends, particularly <HI>G.W.</HI> and <HI>W.P.</HI> 2dly Though <HI>D.L.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lights their answers▪ counting them fallacious &amp;c. Yet his peculiar Friend <HI>G.K.</HI> hath but in the year 1692
<PB N="21" REF="000948_0024_0FAD9672B0E76CA8"/>
vindicated, both <HI>G.F.</HI> doctrine about the soul, and also <HI>W.P's.</HI> answers to the Professours, about the very same sub∣ject of <HI>G.F's.,</HI> which <HI>D.L.</HI> cites; see his <HI>Serious appeal</HI> p: 60, not yet retracted, where it may be seen, that what <HI>D.L.</HI> calls in <HI>G.W.</HI> and <HI>W.</HI>P. <HI>Fallacious equivocation,</HI> his Friend <HI>G.K.</HI> calls <HI>a Sufficient vindication.</HI> Now what curious wire drawing will <HI>D, L.</HI> use▪ here, to clear himself from contra∣dicting his great Friend <HI>G.K.</HI> But since among so many learned and Wise men, there have been so many opinions about the Soul, unless he could define better than other folks what the Soul is, and what the <HI>Breath of life</HI> is which <HI>God breathed into man,</HI> by which <HI>he became a living Soul,</HI> his raking up seeming contradictions about it tends to no bo∣dies profit that I know of. As fot what he tells us of the <HI>Ranters</HI> saying, "The Soul is a part of God; therefore to talk of going to hell is an idle story; is very idle in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to cite. For I do believe, as man continued a living soul to God, by vertue of that life which God breathed into him, and as he is restored thereto again by <HI>Christ,</HI> in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hell is not his portion: Yet till then the Soul is not living to God, but death and hell is it's portion; for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> simply is one thing, and its being a living soul to God, is surely another thing.</P>
<P>In p: 18:19 he cites G, F, again thus,

Now <HI>D. L,</HI> to make <HI>W.P.</HI> contradict <HI>G F</HI> quotes out his <HI>Serio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> A∣pology</HI> p. 146 as follows,
<Q>But that the outward person that suffered was properly the Son of God, We utterly deny—<HI>A Body hast thou prepared me,</HI> said the Son;</Q>
so the Son was not the Body, though the body was the Son's Up∣on which saies <HI>D L</HI>
<Q>Let <HI>W P.</HI> reconcile these, and also tell us who is the Father of that outward person.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="000948_0025_0FAD9673DD374B38"/><HI>Answ</HI> Easily reconciled: For as <HI>W: P.</HI> denies the outward person to be properly the son of God; so <HI>G: F</HI>▪s words, as here laid down by <HI>D: L,</HI> do import the same: For he being there answering a Priest, who was mightily crying up the outward Sabbath, which according to scripture, <HI>was a shadow of things to come</HI> Coll 2.16:17 derected him to <HI>Christ</HI> the substance, or body of that shadow, and said, the <HI>body is the life of the world, and the light of the world</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now what is this to <HI>W: P</HI>'s. saying, <HI>The outward pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n is not properly the son of God:</HI> For surely, the body, which is the substance of the shadowy things under the law, is <HI>Christ</HI> indefinitely, which G: <HI>F.</HI> calls <HI>the light of the world</HI> &amp;c. But what <HI>W: P.</HI> meant, was restricted to his outward visible person only; which surely none will say, that that of its self was properly <HI>the light and life of the world:</HI> so that what <HI>W: P.</HI> and G. <HI>F.</HI> both do say is true, and therefore no contra∣diction. And doth not <HI>D. L.</HI> know, that the words [body of Christ] have various significations in scripture? As, first <HI>his Church</HI> is called <HI>his body</HI> Coll 1.18. The bread of the passover is called his body by <HI>Christ</HI> him self Matt 26.26. And that which suffered on the cross was also his body.

<P><HI>D. L.</HI> fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls upon <HI>VV.</HI> P. again p. 19. quoting his <HI>Reason against Railing</HI> p. 91 as follows
<Q><HI>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our Debtors,</HI> were, (saith he) nothing can be more obvious, than that which is forgiven, is not paid; and if it is our duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o forgive without a satisfaction re∣ceived, and that God is to forgive us, as we forgive them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen is a satisfaction totally excluded.</Q>

<Q>Note a self contradiction, for in the one he totally excludes a satisfaction, and in the other he grants it</Q></P>
<P>Answer.</P>
<P>Can <HI>D.</HI> L. be impartial here in? Does he not know, that where <HI>VV.</HI> P: denies it as a payment of a debt, it is in the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> rigid sense, to wit
<Q>That man having transgressed the righteous law of God, and so ex∣posed to the penalty of eternal wrath, it's altogether im∣possible for God to remitt or forgive without a plenary satisfaction; and that there was no other way by which God could obtain satisfaction, or save men, than by in∣flicting the penalty or infinite wrath and vengeance on <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss Christ</HI> the second person of the Trinity, who for sins past, present and to come, hath wholly born and paid it, to the offended infinite justice of his Father. see W: P<HI>'s</HI>: very words <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> p: 16, of which I shall speak more when I come to his <HI>Numb</HI>: 30:</Q>
But as to <HI>Christ</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="000948_0027_0FAD9675D8826230"/>
offering up in us, by which the wrath of God is appeased to us, <HI>VV,</HI> P, expleans in the next paragraph, to wit
<Q>that <HI>Christ</HI> offers himself in his children in the nature of a Me¦diatory Sacrifice; And further saith <HI>Christ</HI> as a Mediator can atone in the consciences of his People at what time they fall under any miscarriage if they unfeignedly repent ac∣cording to 1 John 2, 1, 2. &amp;c.</Q>
Now it is one thing to ap∣pease the wrath of God or man in a <HI>Mediatory</HI> way, and quite another thing to pay the debt that's due in such a strict sense as aforesaid. So that though W, P, denyed such a satisfaction to be made in one book; yet he did neither expresly nor consequently own it in the other; therefore no contradiction.</P>
<P>Now whereas <HI>D,</HI> L. askes
<Q>How many thousand offerings this new Scripture makes of <HI>Christ</HI>;</Q> as many Saints, so many times <HI>Christ</HI> offers himself up a Sacrifice,
For this I shall refer him to his great Friend G. <HI>K,</HI> for satisfaction, if any thing besides abusing the <HI>Quakers</HI> will satisfie him, see G, <HI>K</HI>'s <HI>VVay Cast up</HI> not yet retracted where in p, 157, 158,
he holds
<Q>that <HI>Christ</HI> is a Mediator in the Saints, and that his Spirit as man, prayeth and maketh intercession onto God in the Saints, and cites <HI>Rom,</HI> 8 for it,</Q>
Now dare <HI>D.</HI> L. say, that the praying of <HI>Christ</HI> is not an offering and living Sacrifice to God; and G, <HI>K.</HI> saith
<Q><HI>Christ</HI> hath done so from the beginning, by whom the children of God in all ages have received grace from God,</Q>
And in p, 109 G, <HI>K.</HI> tells how
<Q><HI>Paul</HI> Preacht <HI>Christ</HI> to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> in the time of their <HI>Heathenism,</HI> cruicified in them, and cites <HI>Gal,</HI> 3 5 6</Q>
Now let G. <HI>K.</HI> tell <HI>D,</HI> L. how many crucifyings of <HI>Christ</HI> there is, so many heathen, so many times Christ crucified, But I say again, prejudice blinds man,</P>
<P>Well now to make G, <HI>F,</HI> contradict W, P, in this matter, in his <HI>Numb,</HI> 30, he quotes <HI>Great Mistery</HI> p 63, thus
<Q><HI>Christ</HI> gave himself, his body for de life of the world, he was the offering for the sins of the Whole world, and paid the debt, and made satisfaction,</Q> To which he implicitely op∣poses W, P. as before, to wit, that <Q>a satisfaction is
<PB N="25" REF="000948_0028_0FAD96769C03FF40"/>
totally excluded, and what is forgiven is not paid.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> What <HI>G: F.</HI> said was in answer to a Priest that said, <Q>Every man should not have his sins pardonned;</Q> Which <HI>G.F.</HI> did not deny, but told, how
<Q><HI>Christ</HI> gave himself an offer∣ing for the sins of the World,</Q>
and that he had enligthned every man coming into the World, that all through him might believe and (which was enough to shew, that though all man had not their sins pardonned, yet all were put into such a capacity, as that they might have their sins pardon∣ned, in as much as) <HI>Christ</HI> had offered himself for all (which many of the Professors at that time dinyed) and which offer∣ing the Father was well pleased with, and satisfied in, and so in that sence he made satisfaction, according to <HI>G: F.,</HI> &amp; which <HI>W:P.</HI> in that very book viz <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> p: 32 did really own viz
<Q>That <HI>Christ</HI> in life, doctrine and death, fulfilled his Fathers will, and offered up a most satisfact∣ory Sacrifice, but not (said he) to pay God, or help him, as being otherwise unable to save men.</Q>

Let him see how <HI>Luke</HI> words the matter, in giving account of some of <HI>Christ's.</HI> last words to his diciples, where he saith thus, <HI>And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of</HI> Hierusalem, until <HI>ye be endued with power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>romon high</HI> Luke 24:49.

<P>As to his comparing our Friends writings to those Priests, whom <HI>Samuel Fisher</HI> in his <HI>Rusticus</HI> p: 773. for their in∣consistent arguments against our Friends, twits with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds of No▪ so: so: no &amp;c.</P>
<P>I shall only say thus much, that I hope I have shewed, and yet shall shew here in that there is no comparison to be made between them: For the occasion of <HI>Samuel Fisher's</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o treating the priests, was the so different terms they at times gave to the light (which <HI>D: L.</HI> may disprove if he can) whereupon (saies <HI>S: F.</HI>

<P>Again. in p 30.31. he cites <HI>G. F</HI>'s <HI>Great Mistery</HI> p 289. thus
<Q>God was in <HI>Christ,</HI> and they are one, the Creator; the father in the son and the Son in the father, and <HI>Christ</HI> in you, and God in <HI>Christ,</HI> the Creator. And <HI>Quakers Plainness</HI> p 24. by <HI>G. W,</HI></Q>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> As blind as <HI>D: L.</HI> renders me in his p: 45. about the Resurrection, yet I shal shew him, that I can see a great de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of difference may be betwixt a Co—worker and a Co—Creator.

<P>In his p: 37. he quotes <HI>R.B.'s Apology</HI> p: 95. in these words viz

<P><Q>Tis true (says <HI>G: W) He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> More</HI> had finer and more excellent notions about the Resurrection, than many other learned men, and aimed at the truth and spirituality there of, from the vision of the holy men recorded in the scrip∣tures.</Q></P>
<P>And then in order to make <HI>G: W.</HI> oppose him self, as he would seem to suppose, he offers a quotation out of p. 37<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the same book viz this manner, viz
<Q><HI>G: W.</HI> cites <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> More</HI> about the Resurrection, saying, Flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God; and I think (saies he) there is the same reason of flesh and bones, viz.</Q></P>
<P>I understand natural flesh and bones, not glorified. Thus he cites <HI>G: W.</HI> and then adds this Note,
<Q><HI>G: W.</HI> com∣mends this notion of <HI>H: More,</HI> as savouring of truth and spirituality, and yet renders those <HI>Atheists</HI> that believe the same; for <HI>H: More</HI> does not here deny the Resurrection of the same body that dyeth, only understands it must be glorified.</Q></P>
<P>Answ. Here he has abused <HI>G: VV.</HI> by leaving out the last part of his words; for after the words immortal and incorruptible <HI>G: VV.</HI> adds,
<Q>and yet the same for matter and substance, which words he has skipt over I suppose because they did not suit his purpose.</Q></P>
<P>Then he saith in his note <HI>G: W. commends this notion of</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> More <HI>as savouring of truth and spirituality</HI>; Whereas <HI>G· VV.</HI> says no such thing of him, as appears by <HI>Daniel Leeds</HI> own quotation before produced.

<P>Answ. Now, as there is no such word, so neither can any such thing be justly deduced from what <HI>G: VV.</HI> there wrote: that subject of which he treated in that place being not at all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ether <HI>Christ</HI> had the body of man or not, but about the manner of his saving and just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying men, which <HI>G: VV.</HI> would not have <HI>R. Gordon</HI> to expect, should be as he imagined in his book p: 30, viz,
<Q>That <HI>Christ</HI> as the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> should outwardly appear, in a bodily existence, to save:</Q>
But here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not one word of denying <HI>Christ</HI> to have the body of man, as <HI>D: L.</HI> falsly cites him, and sure it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s one thing for <HI>Christ</HI> to appear to save men by his <HI>ingrafted word, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s able to save the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul,</HI> Iames. 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1, which the <HI>Quakers</HI> press people to come to witness; and an other thing to say, <HI>Christ</HI> has the body of man, outwardly to come on the last day, to reward every man according to his works, which the <HI>Quakers</HI> also believe.</P>
<P>Then 2dly in the same page <HI>D: L.</HI> cites the same book in p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1; thus, paraphrasing upon it. "And in p. 41. he denies <HI>Christ</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s bodily existence without us.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> There is no such word neither; But <HI>G: VV.</HI> spea∣king of <HI>R· G</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s pretended adoration, and claim of salvation, being to <HI>Christ,</HI> only as the son of <HI>Mary,</HI> existing outward∣ly and bodily without us: There upon <HI>G: VV.</HI> saith
<Q>I ask him if he have so considered God the saviour, or the Son from the substance of the Father; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he asks him What scripture proof he hath for <HI>Christ</HI>'s existing out∣wardly bodily without us at Gods right hand.</Q>
By all which
<PB N="37" REF="000948_0040_0FAD96829EBD6668"/>
it plainly appears, that <HI>G.</HI>W. only opposed those terme (viz) <HI>Christ</HI> existing outwardly bodily without us, be∣cause, that would seem to exclude his being as he is God, and as he is in men; and therefore saies to <HI>R.G.</HI>
<Q>And is <HI>Christ</HI> the saviour as an outward bodily existence or person without us distinct from God, and upon that consideration to be worshipped as God, yea or nay. &amp;c.</Q>
Now though <HI>G.</HI>W. opposes <HI>R.</HI>G<HI>'s.</HI> doctrine of <HI>Christ</HI>'s being or existence to be outwardly and bodily without us; yet it does not at all follow from thence, that he believes, <HI>Christ</HI> hath not a body, that hath a being or existence without us. It is one thing to maintain, that <HI>Christ</HI> the Saviour of the World hath a body existing whithout us wich G.W. denied not; and another thing to hold or maintain, that that bodily ex∣istence it self is <HI>Christ</HI> the saviour of the world, which (and no less) <HI>R.</HI>G<HI>'s.</HI> words seem to import. The outward bo∣dily existence of a man cannot be said strictly to be the man, for them when it dies, and the bodily existence is put off, the man would, cease to be. And where it is said of <HI>Christ,</HI> that he <HI>bare our sins in his own body on the three</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.24; It might as well be said, that the body bare our sins on his own body on the tree. So that to conclude, I say it is a mani∣fest falsehood in <HI>D.L,</HI> to say that G.W. denies <HI>Christ</HI>'s bodi∣ly existence without us. <HI>Christ's</HI> body doth exist without us: Yet that bodily outwardly existence is not the <HI>Christ,</HI> without his soul spirit and God head.</P>

What can be a plainer proof? Yet it doth not fol∣low, that his soul dyed; But if D L say otherwise, then it is he and not we that holds those Muggletonian doctrines; however I am sure we do not And so having done with this, I shall pass the rest of this chapter all is it being pretty much of a so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and it being not my intention to answer eve∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> paragraph in the book, as I have already told my Rea∣der, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given him a very good reason too, viz because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not many of the books by me out of which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to examine them by; neither would it be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, since with any unbyass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d persons I must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his credit, in laying open the unfairness
<PB N="41" REF="000948_0044_0FAD96891BCEFCF0"/>
and forgeries he is guilty of in the beforegoing.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to his <HI>third Chapter,</HI> which I find much like his former, it being grounded upon his not being willing to distinguish, in ascriptural sense, between Christ as he was from the beginning, and as he came in the body in the fulness of time.</P>
<P>As for what he here saith of <HI>John Whitehead,</HI> I refer the Reader to <HI>Tho. Ellwood's</HI> book, Called <HI>Truth Defended</HI> &amp;c. p. 124.</P>
<P>As for his saying, That "The true <HI>Chrstians</HI> believe that the true Christ hath a body of flesh and bones &amp;c. To this I answer, That how, or after what manner, Christ's body is now in heaven I shall by no means undertake to determine' it being (I believe) above the capacity of us Mortals so to do: But I shall tell <HI>D.L.</HI> that he hereby brings his great friend <HI>G.K.</HI> under his censure of not being a true <HI>Christian</HI>; for <HI>G.K.</HI> expresly saith of Christ's body, that,
<Q>It is no more a body of flesh blood and bone, but a pure Aethereal heavenly body, see <HI>Way cast up</HI> p. 131 not retracted.</Q></P>
<P>Then, for his bantering <HI>W: P.</HI> about his calling Christ's body holy: saying Can this be other than hypocrisy? "for as is noted at <HI>Numb</HI> 49 50, he holds the body to be earthly and perishing, I would have the Reader note, it proceeds from <HI>W: P</HI>'s vindicating this saying so <HI>Jsaac "Peningtons</HI>' That which Christ took upon him was but the garment of our nature, which is of an earthly and perishing nature.</P>
<P>To which I answer, That Christ's body was a holy body ac∣cording to <HI>W.</HI>P. Surely <HI>D.L.</HI> will not deny; Yet that it was the garment of our nature is not (me thinks) hard to make out: For it is said <HI>Heb:</HI> 2:14 <HI>For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also him∣self likewise took part of the same</HI> [Mark of the same] Now how it is the same, if not of the same nature, for my part I know not; though Christ defiled not his nature
<PB N="42" REF="000948_0045_0FAD968A7436DA10"/>
by sin, as we have done ours, is Certain; and therefore a holy body according to <HI>W·P:</HI> Yet in as much as <HI>he took on him</HI> the seed of Abraham, he surely took on him our nature, unless the seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> be not of our nature, and that this is the garment which <HI>Is. P</HI> meant, I suppose <HI>D.L.</HI> will not deny: Nay the scripture saith expresly v. 17. <HI>In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethern</HI> Yet though Christ was in all things made like unto his breth∣ren, though he took hould of the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and took part of the same flesh and blood with us, which flesh and blood of ours is surely of an arthly and perishing nature; Yet I utterly deny <HI>D: L</HI>'s inference, that <HI>W: P.</HI> renders Christ's body earthly and perishing: For though he took part of the same flesh and blood with us which flesh and blood of ours (as I said) is of an earthly and perish∣ing nature; yet by the mighty power of God, Christ's bo∣dy was raised from the dead, and saw no corruption, and so he dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him, but he ever liveth to make intercession for us, in his soul and spirit and glorious and heavenly body.</P>
<P>I come next to touch upon one passage in his <HI>Chap.</HI> 4, where he thinks he hath gotten I know not what advan∣tage against <HI>W: P,</HI> He cites <HI>VV: P</HI>'s. <HI>Reason against Rai∣ling</HI> p. 165. where <HI>D.</HI>L. saies "W.P. justifies and declares that he abides by there ill names given by <HI>E. Burrough,</HI> p.
<Q>30. &amp;c. to wit, <HI>Thou Iesuit, thou Sot, thou Sorcerer, thou art a Serpent</HI> &amp;c. And yet (saies <HI>D</HI> L) in <HI>Address to Protestants</HI> p. 242, he at once unchristians himself and all his Brethren, for so doing, for saith he, Men that call names for Religion, may tell us they are Christi∣ans, if they will, but no body would know them to be such by their fruits, to be sure they are no <HI>Christians</HI> of Christ's making.</Q>
Upon which <HI>D. L.</HI> cries out
<Q>Good Reader take notice of it; Alas. how has the man forgot him self!</Q></P>
<P>Answ. Alas! how hath <HI>D: L.</HI> abused <HI>VV</HI>: P. and his Rea∣der too; For <HI>VV: P.</HI> doth not declare, that he abides by
<PB N="43" REF="000948_0046_0FAD968AE76F7198"/>
any <HI>ill names</HI> given by <HI>Edward Burrough</HI>: for the word [ill] is not <HI>VVill. Penn's,</HI> but added by <HI>D: L,</HI> which was <HI>ill</HI> done of him: <HI>VV:</HI> P's. words in the page quoted by <HI>D: L.</HI> being these, viz,
<Q>But let it suffice that <HI>Edward Burrouge</HI> gave no harder names than the scriptures by Rule allows. We read of <HI>dogs, bears, wolves, swine, serpents, vipers, foxes, childeren of the Devil</HI> and such like: And as that nature to whom they were then given, thought them hard, so doth <HI>Thomas Hicks</HI> now; But the same power that then gave them, hath now used them to the same end and purpose, and I abide by it.</Q>
Thus far W: <HI>P</HI>; where observe W: P. doth not declare that he abides by any <HI>ill names,</HI> for he useth not the word [ill] but <HI>hard names.</HI> 2dly He sheweth how such like names have been given of old by good men (yea it was by the best of men) and saith, that <HI>E: B.</HI> doing it to the same end and purpose, he abides by it, and since <HI>D: L.</HI> finds fault with it, we may easily guess at his reason for so doing, viz, "twas W: P. that wrote it; For of all the hard names his friend <HI>G: K.</HI> hath given his opposers, I cannot, if it were for my life, find that he blames him for one of them, and to shew, that not only the scriptures and our friends, as above, but that also <HI>G: K.</HI> hath given hard names to his opposers, I shall instance (for brevity sake) but one place out of but one of his books entituled, <HI>The true Christ owned,</HI> see p. 104.105 thus His <HI>false</HI> accusations; his <HI>beast with</HI>
<Q><HI>seven heads,</HI> that he hath coniured out of the sea of his <HI>trobled imagination</HI>; his <HI>Atheistical</HI> and <HI>blasphemous</HI> creed; I have proved him manifestly guilty of <HI>Socinianisim, Ar∣rianis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um, Anthropomorphitism, Muggletonism, Antichrist∣ianism,</HI> and last of all gross <HI>Atheirsm.</HI></Q>
Now where will <HI>D: L</HI>'s sincerity and impartiality be, if he deal not with <HI>G: K,</HI> as he hath dealt with us in this matter.</P>
<P>Then as to what he offers to prove that W: P. unchrist∣ians him self and Brethren at once, because he saith (as <HI>D· L.</HI> quotes him) "Men that call names for religion may tell they are <HI>Christians</HI> if they will &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="000948_0047_0FAD968C8637A108"/>I <HI>answer</HI> Here he hath very unfairly left out that part of <HI>VV: P</HI>'s. words which would unquestionably have shewn such men he there discreyd to be no <HI>Christians</HI>; For <HI>VV: P.</HI> being there treating concerning and speaking against per∣secutors, he hath it thus, viz,
<Q>Men that call names for religion and fling stones and persecute for faith, may tell us they are <HI>Christians,</HI> if they will, but no body would know them to be such, by their fruits.</Q></P>
<P>Now these words [and fling stones and persecute for faith] <HI>D: L.</HI> hath concealed from his Reader, and I am sure, that is a worse errour than <HI>a little failure in Syntax.</HI> But by inserting them, my Reader may see what sort of men they were, whom <HI>VV: P.</HI> rejected, as unworthy of that honourable name, viz <HI>Persecutors for faith, flingers of stones as well as callers of names for re∣lig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI>; And it is well known, that such persecutors, in formers and others, would not only fling stones, but throw dirt too, and also call such names as these; <HI>You Quaking Curr, You Anabaptist Rogue, You Fanatick Dog,</HI> and the like; Now it is clear, that this was the calling names for Religion which W.<HI>P.</HI> meant, and not the calling of names after the manner as the Prophet did, when he called a sort of men, <HI>Greedy Dogs</HI> &amp;c. nor after the manner as <HI>E: B.</HI> did, when he called such like men, <HI>Sot Sorcerer</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But perhaps <HI>D: L.</HI> will say in vindication of <HI>G. K,</HI> that he hath retracted the hard names by him given to his Opposers.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That Retractation is but a meer flam like some of the rest: For how far hath he retracted this? Why his words are of so large an extent, that's that I know no Professor of Christianity but both might and would say as much and yet retract just nothing at all, neither would there be any service in it in order to give the least satisfact∣ion to any concerned who might suppose themselves abused by hard names published; for his retractation is only in ge∣neral terms (viz
<Q>He retracts in general all the hard names that he hath given to such as did nor deserve them) with∣out discharding any particular person or society from the
<PB N="45" REF="000948_0048_0FAD968D15B08D20"/>
scandal of those hard names.</Q>
For instance G.K. in his Antichtists and Saducees detected hath bestowed many hard names upon me, as Antichrist, Saducee or rather Atheist, Bold Ignorant, Miller Philosopher &amp;c. Now since there is great probability that he doth not mean me to be one of those upon whose account he hath retracted the hard names given; So also any of his former Opponents to whom he hath given hard names may say I know not that he means me to be one of them who have not (in his Judg∣ment) deserved them, and now although he seems to make an acknowledgment and blame himself for bestowing hard names on divers, yet since he names none of those diver what satisfaction to me is his pretended retraction in this more than his charging them on me in his former, and what sincerity doth he manifest in it? For those divers he hints at either did occur to his memory at the writing of his book or thy did not: If they did, and he sincere i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his pretension he should have named them; but if they did not then it is a sign he put down what he published by meer rote and in short, he had as good have said nothing about it since every particular person concerned in those hard names may say they are never the more satisfied there by and so all of them still lye at <HI>G: K</HI>'s door.</P>
<P>Upon pruisal of his 5th. Chapter about prophesies I find not above one that he hath mentioned which hath failed: For those he speaks of who have of late prophesied against several towns and places, I never heard that any prefixed a time, nor otherwaies than upon condition, viz unless they did repent, which whether there was not so much repen∣tance in so many of them as might move the Lord to a farther compassion on them is surely more than this D: L: knows.</P>
<P>(As for <HI>D: L</HI>'s ridiculing <HI>G: VV.</HI> about his prophesie concerning <HI>G: K.</HI> viz
<Q>And thus saith the Lord, because thou hast poured out contempt, scorn and reproach upon my servants and people, I will assuredly pour out and bring great contempt and scorn upon thee.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="000948_0049_0FAD968E81F9DC00"/>I <HI>answer,</HI> What farther scorn and contempt may yet come upon him, than what is already come and manifest to the world, even since those words were written by <HI>G: VV.</HI> let time shew; and daies to come make yet more manifest: For scorn and contempt is certainly come upon him, even be∣yond the conceit which <HI>D.L.</HI> speaks of. And although he may slight what <HI>G.W.</HI> said of <HI>G.K,</HI> because as he saith,
<Q>it's The fate of all men, less or more; yet that's no more than those might have said, whom the Apostle compared to <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres,</HI> and of whom he said, <HI>Their folley should be manifest to all men</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3:9.</Q></P>
<P>In his 6. Chapter he flings out his scoffs and taunts about Infallible discerning, and in particular reflects upon our Friends about <HI>Delaware,</HI>
<Q>that they want this spirit of discerning, and to prove it instances the case of <HI>Robert Ewer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now to this I say, Though <HI>G: F.</HI> (as quoted by him) speaks of <HI>a Minister of Christ's having an infallible discer∣ning of a mans state and condition,</HI> Yet he doth not say it is without any respect had to the fruit he brings forth: And (Christ saith <HI>Matt.</HI> 7:16 <HI>By their fruits ye shall know them.</HI> So that I do believe, to know any mans condition without this token, must be an extraordinary and particular gift of God; But by the fruits brought forth, I do believe, according to the words of Christ, people may be known, and that infallibly too, for what is short of that, is not properly knowledge, but barely conjecture. And as for <HI>Robert Ewer</HI> There was not so near an unity bewixt him and our Friends, a considerable time before that business of that Woman at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> was talked of, as <HI>D: L.</HI> may possibly imagine; But it is not the Churches place to dis∣own any Member, before proof be made, of some evil done by him or her, and to prove what I say, I hope I have an Au∣thor very sufficient in <HI>D: L</HI>'s eye, for it is no less person than his great friend <HI>G: K,</HI> who in his late book of <HI>Retracta∣tions</HI> &amp;c. (not yet retracted again that I heare of) hath it thus in p. 3;
<Q>We find no warrant from scripture to re∣ceive
<PB N="47" REF="000948_0050_0FAD968E96AE32B8"/>
an accusation against any, far less a positive judg∣ment, without plain evidence of matter of fact against them, by credible witnesses &amp;c.</Q>
Well then; so far as matter of fact was thus made appear against <HI>Robert Ewer,</HI> he was dealt with according to Gospel order too. But for D: L's telling us, of
<Q>Late ill example of divers of our Preachers, especially of their being unlawfully concerned with women:</Q>
He should either have let us know who they were, or else have been silent about it; for for my part I know them not, but do beleive it is a great slander.</P>
<P>In his p. 64 he banters <HI>W: P.</HI> for saying,
<Q>We ascribe not infallibility to men, but to the grace of God, and to men so far as they are led by it:</Q>
Here upon he makes this reflection, viz
<Q>Behould Reader, and note this Rhe∣torick well! For are not other Professors, yea, all men in the world so far infallible, as well as <HI>Quakers.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ</HI>: Yes. But does not D: <HI>L.</HI> know, that there are multitudes of men in the world, who are so far from being led by the infallible grace, or spirit of God, that they make a mock at, and deride it, and surely, such are very far from being infallibly led by it. But what need was there for <HI>D:</HI> L. to say [<HI>as well as Quakers</HI>] since <HI>W: P.</HI> according to <HI>D: L</HI>'s own citation, doth not restrict infallibility only to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> but to men indefinitely, for saith he [<HI>and to men so far as they are led by it</HI>].</P>
<P>As for his telling, how friends "admit none to travel upon Truth's acount without certificates, I think it is very com∣mendable; but pasting by his mocking, viz, his saying, it is "to help our spirit of discerning, I take notice of what he saith of <HI>G</HI>: W. quoting him out of <HI>Quakers plainness,</HI> thus
<Q>We have a Record in Peoples conscience; as if there fore there was no need of a Certificate, which he <HI>Ishmael like, calls a Pocket Record.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Though he so tauntingly, yet groundleslyt, repre∣sents us to be a sort of people, who think grea things of our selves, as to our spiritual attainm; ants yet, I do beleive,
<PB N="48" REF="000948_0051_0FAD969069399AA8"/>
our Friends do not think they have attained to a greater degree of discerning spirits, than the primitive Christians had, and the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> intimates, their <HI>approving by their letters,</HI> such as went to <HI>Ierusalem</HI> about the Churches service, see 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.3. And the same Apostle, speaking to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> as though he and <HI>Timothy</HI> needed not <HI>epistles of commendation</HI> to that Church, <HI>as some others</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3:1 there by intimated, that though such very emi∣nent labourers needed not such commendations, yet others did. And let <HI>D: L.</HI> observe, that though <HI>G. K.</HI> in his late book of <HI>Retractations</HI> p: 3 &amp;c, saith,
<Q>To know men by their fruits is a gift of the spirit and proceedeth from a true spirit of discerning, that is given universally in some measure to all the faithfull:</Q>
Yet it seems, he him∣self must have that, which D: <HI>L.</HI> calls <HI>A pocket Rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd,</HI> with him to <HI>England,</HI> and that signed not only by his own faction, but also by—perhaps D: <HI>L.</HI> knows who besides.</P>
<P>In p. 66 D: <HI>L.</HI> tells us
<Q>My old friends oft bless them selves thus, viz We are redeemed from a vain life and conversation, more than any society in <HI>Christendom</HI>; We are the only Professours of truth &amp;c. And saies D: <HI>L.</HI> so saies the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> We are not as other men &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Answ. What then? though the proud <HI>Pharisees</HI> were boasters, and cryed, They were not as other men, &amp;c. Yet I hope he will not say; The saints of old were <HI>Pha∣risees,</HI> who said, <HI>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.19; Yet there were some amongst them, who appeared to be very scandalous in their lives and conversations. Neither do we bless our selves, as D: <HI>L.</HI> falsly alledges, because we are in measure redeemed from a vain life and conver∣sation; but it is our very principle, which D: L. cannot be ignorant of to abase self for ever, and only to bless and priase the Lord, who through his Son <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> en∣ables the faithful, to perform what is acceptable in his sight.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="000948_0052_0FAD9690D17CAF40"/>The next thing I shall touch at, is to make some small re∣flection upon what he urgeth against us in his 7th. <HI>Chap∣ter,</HI> under the head <HI>Of the Scriptures,</HI> though the sub∣stance hath been often answered by our friends; and that very fully, in these books amongst many others, viz, <HI>The Christian Quaker,</HI> W.P <HI>s. Invalidity, Reason against R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing</HI> &amp;c. so that I shall need to say the less about it, yet I can∣not wholly pass it by, because I have therein an opportunity offered of discovering his folly, as well as great envy, manifested in his so ridiculously bantering that faithfull labourer in the Lords vineyard, <HI>G.F.</HI> who I believe is now at peace with the Lord, <HI>where the wicked ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se from troub∣ling: and the weary be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rest;</HI> Whom he puts his profane joques upon in P. 74, as if, because <HI>G.F.</HI> said
<Q>Dust is the ser∣pents meat, the Serpent feeds upon dust; therefore <HI>G.F.</HI> meant, the Serpent was literally to feed upon lime and stone houses, called Churches, and thereupon scoffingly queries;</Q>
"Had not the Devil need to have strong teeth, to gnaw upon steeple houses?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> O gross perverter! I remember he tells me in p. 45. that about the Resurrection I carnally apprehend <HI>G.K.</HI> Now I appeal to every judicious Reader, whether I have not more reason to say, that <HI>D.L.</HI> carnally apprehends <HI>G. F.</HI> For though <HI>G.</HI>F. tells the world;
<Q>Their church is dust, a heap of lime and stone gathered together; it is what is true, and obvious to every one that hath eyes:</Q>
And though <HI>G.F.</HI> saies;
<Q>The serpent feeds upon dust, and that is also true, and according to Scripture, which saith, <HI>Dust shall thou eat all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aies of thy</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gen. 2.14.</Q>
Yet that the consequence is, that these two expressions, according to <HI>G.F.</HI> must be fulfilled in a literal sense, viz, that the Devil is to feed on the dust of those sort of walls; <HI>D.L.</HI> may indeed insinuate, but I know not who will be so weak as to believe him.</P>
<P>And now I shall desire the Reader to excuse my stepping back to p. 70, where I find <HI>D.L.</HI> falsly accusing <HI>Tho. Ell∣wood</HI> of <HI>belying the Common Creed,</HI> quoting his <HI>Truth De∣fended</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="000948_0053_0FAD96933B890EF0"/>
p. 70, on this wise, viz,

the book called the Bible, before all books extemt &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> This is a most wicked and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase insinuation, as if, when <HI>G: W.</HI> mentions our preferring the Scripture, he did not thereby intend the Bible. I am persvvaded, it is not only contrary to <HI>D: L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> beleif, but also to his very knowledge: Besides, though other books are, and may be written, by the assistance, and from the dictates of the Spirit of God; yet that doth not hinder the book called the Bible, from having the preference, all things considered. Gold and Silver money are both stamped vvith the Kings Image and superscription, and both are allowed by him to be current Coin, yet the one is preferible to the other. And, vvhereas our Friends, amongst many other, have said, that some Scriptures are corrupted, yet that hin∣ders not, but in the main, they are preferible to all other books: Gold may have some tincture of a meaner metal in it, yet in the main 'tis preferible to all other met∣als.</P>
<P>Again, what a gross inference hath he drawn, from the words he quotes as <HI>Sam: Fisher's</HI> viz
<Q>That were their transcriptions and translations never so certain and entire, by answering to the first original Copies, yet are not capa∣ble to be to all men any other than a <HI>Lesbian</HI> Rule or nose of wax; Whereupon <HI>D:</HI> L. saies, Mark how he affirms, That if the Scripures were never so true, yet they are ca∣pable of being no other than a nose of wax.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Mark how <HI>D: L.</HI> belies his own quotation, in his pretendedly marking <HI>S: F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> words; for the quotation himself offers, saies of the Scriptures, <HI>That they are not capable to be to all men any other than a</HI> Lesbian <HI>Rule or nose of wax:</HI> But in his mark, to render <HI>S: F.</HI> odious, he makes him affirm, <HI>they where capable of being no other than a nose of wax.</HI> Oh Insincere man! Can he be so ignorant, as not to know the difference betwixt saying, The Scriptures can not be to all men of service (which was <HI>S: F's</HI> meaning, in as much as multitudes of mankind never had heard one word of them) and his own saying; That they
<PB N="52" REF="000948_0055_0FAD9695D3CD9C50"/>
are capable of being no other (indefinitely) than a nose of Wax.</P>
<P>Well! upon this perversion of the above quotation <HI>D: L.</HI> comments, saying;
<Q>Now I dare affirm, there is no sort or people else in <HI>Cristendom,</HI> except <HI>Papists,</HI> will speak this of the Scriptures. But experience tells me, That all sensible <HI>Christians</HI> who protest against this Popish prin∣ciple, cannot but have an evidence in themselves to the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th and purity of the Scriptures &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> And what of all this? The question is not a∣bout what evidence sensible Christians have of the Scriptures; nor whether they are to them as a nose of wax; But cheif∣ly▪ about what they are to hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the world, which have them not. And what service they can be of unto such, <HI>D: L.</HI> we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e best to inform us, if he can.</P>
<P>In p. 75 <HI>D: L.</HI> saies;
<Q>But before we conclude this head, take one verdict more from <HI>W: P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Spirit of Truth</HI> p. 36, <HI>The Scripture</HI> (saies he) <HI>is much like the shadow of the true Rule.</HI> Now all men know, That the shadow is a vain empty uncertain thing &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That's <HI>D▪ L's</HI> great mistake; For <HI>Paul,</HI> who said <HI>Heb,</HI> 10.1 <HI>The law having a shadow of good things to come,</HI> surely did not count the law, a vain, empty and uncertain thing. And in chap. 8.5, speaking of the Priests who offered gifts according to the law, saies, <HI>That they served unto the example and shadow of heavenly things</HI>; then surely, those things, which by Gods own appointment, served to the example and shadow of heavenly things, were not vain, empty or uncertain; consequently, it may be easily seen, that this observation of <HI>D: L's</HI> is both vain and empty.</P>
<P>I am now come to his 8th <HI>Chapter,</HI> entituled <HI>Of Ma∣gistracy and Government</HI>; to which I shall give a little touch, and begin where he begins, with a passage he quotes out of <HI>Samuel Jenings's State of the case</HI> p. 73. viz
<Q>Magistracy and Government we alwaies owned to be the Ordinance of God.</Q>
To which he objects in p. 78.
<PB N="53" REF="000948_0056_0FAD9696137A30D8"/>
thus
<Q>Now observe, here <HI>S: Jenings</HI> deals deceitfully and dishonestly in pretending to be what they really are not.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> A high charge indeed! and that too to be fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣ded upon such an honest and innocent expression; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or what though (as <HI>D: L:</HI> quotes him) <HI>W. S.</HI> saith,
<Q>We own Government and Magistracy that stands in the power of God, and executes true Judgment within the gates, casting down sin and evil doers, and setting up Righteous∣ness, and those that walk therein?</Q>
Yet it doth no waies follow, that therefore we
<Q>own no Goverment to be such (so as to be subject to them in all things, by yiel∣ding either active or passive obedience to their commands)</Q>
<Q>but the Government of those who witness Christ to rule and reign in them, as <HI>D. L.</HI> asserts:</Q>
For both <HI>William Sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th's,</HI> and the rest of our friends practice, in general from the beginning, hath proved the contrary; they ha∣ving therein followed Scripture precepts, and the examp∣les of the Saints of old, in owning Government and Ma∣gistracy to be appointed of God, and that to them sub∣jection was due, as aforesaid. Yet surely none vvill think; that they so ovvned them, as to ovvn that in them vvhich vvas corrupt: No, they vvere so far from that, as they did not spare to tell them of it; <HI>Isaiah</HI> saies, <HI>Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves</HI> &amp;c. see <HI>ch.</HI> 1:23, and <HI>Ezekiel</HI> saies <HI>ch.</HI> 22:27. <HI>Her Princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood</HI> &amp;c. But to sum up the matter; if <HI>D. L.</HI> ovvn such a Government as <HI>W: S:</HI> speaks of, it is so far vvell; hovvever, vvhether he do or no, it is such, an one as <HI>the God of Israel, the Rock of Israel</HI> instituted, 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 23:3. vvhen he spake by his Servant <HI>David</HI> on this wise; <HI>He th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</HI> And if <HI>D. L.</HI> do own such a Government, then I would ask, whether he cannot say also with <HI>S: J▪ That he owns Magistracy and Government to be an ordinance of God,</HI> and yet justify the aforementioned Prophets, in so smartly reproving the Princes of their People? and
<PB N="54" REF="000948_0057_0FAD9696EB3A9AC8"/>
next, whether in so doing, he would, or ought to be ac∣counted one that pretends to be what he really is not? Let him well consider this.</P>
<P>As to what <HI>D:</HI> L. produceth against <HI>G: F,</HI> out of a book entituled, <HI>Papers given forth to the heads</HI> &amp;c; where∣in, amongst other expressions, <HI>D: L.</HI> makes <HI>G: F.</HI> to say;
<Q>They are out of the Life and Power that make such work for an Earthly King, and Earthly Powers.</Q></P>
<P>I <HI>Answer.</HI> Though I know not that ever I saw the book he refers to; yet it really seems to me, to be written upon the occasion of so much contending, fighting, killing and destroying one another, in striving who should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e upper∣most, in and about the time of the civil Wars. But that this contradicts <HI>W: P,</HI> or that <HI>W: P.</HI> contradicts this, by his peaceably obtaining a grant from the King, of the Government here, as <HI>D: L.</HI> seems to insinuate in these words, viz;
<Q>Come mark that <HI>W. Penn,</HI> with they industry, in getting Grant after Grant for Kingly and Earthly power <HI>is quite wide of the mark; they being no waies parallel;</HI></Q>
For <HI>W.P.</HI> made no such work to obtain his Grant. (As <HI>G: F.</HI> con∣damnes in the above cited passage) Then pray observe how false he is, in thus telling <HI>W. P.</HI> of his getting Grant after Grant for Kingly power; where, as if he had Kingly power, surely he would be a King, at least his power would not be subordinate to the Kings, which it is well known <HI>W.P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> is.</P>
<P>It is from the like ignorance or worse, that he makes such an use as he does, of <HI>W.P</HI>'s. words, quoted by him out of <HI>Address to Protestants</HI> p. 334. thus,
<Q>If we will give ancient story credit, we shall find, the wordly weapons were never employed by the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> till she be∣came Worldly, and so ceased to be truly <HI>Christian</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
Up∣on which <HI>D. L.</HI> saith:
<Q>I Confess, had not ancient story in∣formed me, that all <HI>Chtistian Societies</HI> have apostatized, when they grew numerous, I should have admired at this Passage, that the same <HI>W. P.</HI> should in so few years after he Wrote it; not only fall into that Apostacy himself, but also draw many more with him.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="000948_0058_0FAD969792C00C80"/><HI>Answer</HI>: But pray What is the Apostacy, vvhich <HI>D. L.</HI> accounts, that <HI>W. P.</HI> and those many more drawn in by him, are fallen into? Why the most I can make of it is, <HI>That People are so far degenerated from Christs commands given to his followers, viz to let the Tares grow up with the Wheat, &amp;c. that they who now pretend to be his, do not make use of worldly weapons, so much to pluck up the tares, as the good wheat, as the divers Persecutions of late years can testifie.</HI> And that this was it that <HI>W. P.</HI> meant, by their making use of worldly weapons, is clear, from the very subject matter he was upon, and treating about in that place. Now if <HI>W. P.</HI> hath never done so, as I beleive he never did, then to be sure, in that respect he is clear from being an Apostate.</P>
<P>And since <HI>D. L.</HI> is so well informed, that <HI>all</HI> Christian Societies <HI>have Apostatized as they grew numerous</HI>; surely, the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> having grown very numerous, they must needs according to D.<HI>L.</HI> be apostatized also: and yet in his <HI>Almanack</HI> for the year 169: he prays, <HI>that she may be a blessing upon</HI> Philadelphia; As if an Apostate Church could be a blessing upon any place.</P>
<P>Then whereas he observes, <HI>that Antient story hath in∣formed him, that all</HI> Christian Societies <HI>have apostatized, when they grew numerous</HI>: I shall now observe likewise, and put him in mind too, how the scene is altered; and that modern story can now inform him of a Society of People lately founded in <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> and his great Friends who (like those that antient story informs us of, though they were apostatized from the light, life and spirit of Christ; yet would still retain to themselves the honourable name of Christians; so those of this nevv Society) though they were gone from the unity and society of the people cal∣led <HI>Quakers,</HI> at the first, would by all means value themsel∣ves much, upon their retaining that name, and that forsooth of the most pure and most primitive sort too, and therefore must be distinguished by the name of <HI>Christian Quakers.</HI> That these are so apostatized, within the space of about
<PB N="56" REF="000948_0059_0FAD96989B668E90"/>
seven years, notwithstanding their not growing numerous, that scarce any of them will own the name; But like <HI>Ba∣bels Builders</HI> are strangely divided amongst themselves; and truly look upon it as a judgment befallen them for their lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty tower building: some being gone to the water, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some to dipping one another; and some to sprinkling with the old popish Ceremony of <HI>God Fathers</HI> and <HI>God Mothers</HI>: some staying at home, and leaving all <HI>Christian Societies</HI>▪ others running into strange notions, as that there are two Gods, and that one of them dyed &amp;c. Some (though very few) now and then keeping a meeting, possibly pretty near the manner of their primitive practice. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus is <HI>the Lan∣guage</HI> of these <HI>Babel</HI> Builders <HI>confounded,</HI> and themselves <HI>scattered abroad,</HI> so that they have already almost <HI>left oft to build the City and the Tower.</HI> God grant they may be a war∣ning to all others, for the future.</P>
<P>But to wave any farther digression, I come again to the point, and do say, That as it is clear, that what <HI>W.P.</HI> wrote there, was intended against those who used such like worldly weapons, in the carrying on of Religious mat∣ters: So it is also clear, that he never thereby meant to insi∣nuate, as if Christ upon his coming into the world, or offe∣ring up himself, had put an end, or commanded an end to be put to all outward Government in matters Civil: For in the same page, <HI>W.P.</HI> intimates;
<Q>That Christ came to reform the lives of men, and to make them better sub∣jects to obey <HI>Cesar</HI> &amp;c,</Q>
So that if subjects be owned, Princes, &amp;c. must be owned likewise; And seeing <HI>W P</HI> owned, that Christ came to make men better subjects to o∣bey <HI>Cesar,</HI> by consequence he must needs have owned, that Christ did allow of a <HI>Cesar</HI> to command such obedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; And I dare say, Whosoever shall read that, or any other o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>W. P's,</HI> books, shall find nothing to the contrary: But for him to charge <HI>W: P</HI>: with Apostacy, because of his being concerned in civil Government, is preposterous; and I further say, for Friends to be concerned in the civil Go∣vernment, is no waies inconsistent with their antient
<PB N="57" REF="000948_0060_0FAD969C2139AD20"/>
principles, or practice either, when they have been called to it by Authority, without an oath: therefore D: L's. insi∣nuation against <HI>W:P:</HI> and us, as if we were <HI>ceased to be Christ∣ian,</HI> because concerned therein, is groundless, and a meer begging of the Question.</P>
<P>Another fling D. L. has in this 81st▪ pa. against W: P, as follows, viz
<Q>But some think W: P: has wit enough to make out to all that see with his eyes, that the sword of the Magistrate viz <HI>Constable's staves, Sheriff's weapons, Stocks, Prisons and Gallows</HI>▪ are not worldly weapons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut spiritual weapons, when used by <HI>Qua∣kers.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> An idle story: One would think he were violently seized with the itch of scribling, For where did W: P: ever take upon him to prove or make out to any man any such thing? Besides, I never u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derstood, that a <HI>Constable's staff</HI> was counted a weapon, he being but a Civil Officer, and his place to keep the peace; but rather that it is a mark or badge of his office, whence it is common with people, when a <HI>Constable</HI> comes to serve a Warrant upon any person, and brings not his Staff with him to ask him, where it is? And I my self was once a <HI>Sheriff,</HI> but neither before, then, nor since, did I ever understand, that such a thing as a weapon, peculiarly belonged to, or was essentially need∣ful in, the due execution of that Office. Then as for <HI>Stocks, Prison and Gallows,</HI> he may call them weapons if he please, but for my part I do not think them so; much less that they come under the Apostle's denomination of car∣nal, when he saies 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10:4, <HI>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty trough God to the pulling down of strong holds</HI> &amp;c. For the weapons which the Apostle here opposes to carnal, being such wherewith they pulled down strong holds, seems to me to allude to such outward wea∣pons, with which the warriours of old did fight, and pull down outward strong holds; Consequently, did not allude to the strong holds themselves, which (in a sense) Stocks and Prisons are. So then, where the Apostle speaks of the
<PB N="58" REF="000948_0061_0FAD969D1A415810"/>
weapons of their warfare not being carnal, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e supposed to intend or allude to stocks, prisons, or the like, but rather to those weapons, with which they of old used to pull them down. As for his sly insinuation a∣bout <HI>W: P's</HI> making out to the people, that Stocks, Con∣stable's staves, Prisons, Gallows &amp;c. are spiritual weapons, when used by the <HI>Quakers</HI>; I shall only say thus much, I can not think, but that he knows better, than he writes, in this Case, as well as in many other matters; and surely the greater will be his condemnation in the great day of Acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, which they (though fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly) so much accuse us of denying.</P>

Yet when <HI>G: K:</HI> got into <HI>England,</HI> and into the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Londons</HI> favour, how quickly did he himself there fall to that work really, which but a little before, he had falsly ob∣jected against others in <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> by instigating, stirring up and endeavouring to prevail with Authority in <HI>England,</HI> to give order, not only to enter into our Meeting houses; but also to search for our Books, and when found, to have them diligently searched and examined by the most pious and jud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cious &amp;c; and if found guilty of vile and gross errours o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which, no question, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and the Clergy must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udges to suppress them by publick Authority; and that for no other reason, but pretended errours in doctrine contained in them?

So that this Suffering propo∣sed by him, would not be on a like ground with their pre∣tended suffering he complains of here, viz, for calling a Governour <HI>Impudent man,</HI> telling him, <HI>He was not fit to be Governour</HI>; for belying Magistrates (as they did here) in print, about their proceedings in the administration of Justice, also for falsly insinuating against Magistrates, <HI>that one was so drunk, that he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain to be carried to bed; and that another was so drunk, that he could scarce gett over the ships side he was in,</HI> with such like stuff, which <HI>G: K:</HI> and his company here (in their impetuous heat to vent their malice on some then in authority in this place, and to render them as odious, as well they could) did not stick to publish, to their great abuse. But alas! the case (on such an occasion as aforesaid) would be far otherwise with the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>England:</HI> For having no such like things as these, justly to lay to their charge there, their suffering would be only on the score of pretended errours in Doctrine, which (as I said) is the common pretence of most Persecutors. Yet since <HI>D: L:</HI> and <HI>G: K:</HI> flout so much at infallible descerning, I would ask them, Upon what pretence they would undertake to pass judgment upon our books? If they say, by the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, Who then (say I) must be Iudge of the Comment? For
<PB N="60" REF="000948_0063_0FAD969F18561A40"/>
it is about that, that Persecutors generally differ with the Persecuted. Therefore were <HI>D: L:</HI> sincere and impartial a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he pretends to be; since he takes upon him to inveigh so much, against the pretended persecution of those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re, why should he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e so mute, as not to rebuke, or so much as take one word of notice, of <HI>G: K's</HI> real endeavours to stir up those in Authority in <HI>England,</HI> to a real persecution there: Since (although the book wherein those passages are contained, was published before the <HI>Retractation</HI> book came forth, yet) he hath not (there in) retracted them: And yet <HI>D:</HI> L: pretends, he would have taken in <HI>G: K's</HI> books, together with ours, if he had not re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cted hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> errours: but his Cloak is too short, and his covering too narrow, to hide his exceeding great partiality under, as in several places of this book I have shewn, particularly in this case.</P>
<P>The next thing I shall take notice of, is his mentioning our Friends ancient Testimony concerning <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ries,</HI> so as <HI>being reviled not to revile again</HI>; and also their cry∣ing against those <HI>who caused people to be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in prison, and took away their goods</HI> upon a religious account, and the like, comparing it with <HI>George Keith, Thomas Budd, John Mc Combe, William Bradford and Peter Boss</HI> their being called to account for their abuses to the Government, see p: 81 to 86. Now this is fallacious, for they hold no parallel, and therein at most he doth but meerly beg the Question, they being not called to account about any Religi∣ous Difference, as I have already shown.</P>
<P>For I do believe, had any other Persons (though they had been such as had never in the least differed with us about Religious matters▪) done as <HI>G: K:</HI> and his Company did, they would not have escaped the notice of the Govern∣ment, any more than <HI>G: K:</HI> &amp;c. I would therefore have them, and all others, duly, and in sincerity and truth, weigh this matter in the right ballance; for although our Friends h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ified, <HI>That we ought to hear injur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> &amp;c. and accordingly have born the injurious Revilings, Impri∣sonments
<PB N="61" REF="000948_0064_0FAD969FDA0992B8"/>
and Spoiling of Goods, acknowledging it o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Principle so to do, when inflicted on any of us for Con∣science sake; Yet on the other hand, we alwaies owned <HI>Magistracy to be an Ordinance of God,</HI> and that <HI>it was for the punishment of evil doers, and to preserve mens Lives, Liberties and Properties</HI>; see <HI>Edward Burroughs's Works</HI> p: 784: 785. And likewise it hath been the practice of our Friends from the beginning, to endeavour to recover their just Rights, by due course of Law from those who were not under the regulation of our Church discipline, nor would otherwise be perswaded to do the thing that was just and right, notwithstanding D: <HI>L's</HI> undue and strained construct∣ion of our words relating to bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Jnjuries &amp;c.</P>
<P>And whereas in his p: 82 he gives us a quotation, said to be taken out of <HI>Sam. Jennings</HI> his <HI>State of the Case,</HI> p. I know not what, which he makes to speak to this purpose viz "That they could do no less than prosecute, and fine <HI>G: K:</HI> and <HI>T: B:</HI> without the violation of their Trust to the King.</P>
<P>I answer, Since he hath not mentioned the page, I can∣not tell wether or no he hath laid down <HI>S.

L's</HI> citation it self; that it was not self revenge they sought, but to prevent the violation of their Trust.</P>
<P>And therefore <HI>D. L.</HI> had no manner of ground, to caution our Preachers to keep their Hearers from reading that part of <HI>Robert Barclay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Apology,</HI> which he hath quo∣ted in his p: 89; For <HI>R.

And as I could produce several instances out of our ancient Friends writings, to prove, that from the beginning, it was against our Prin∣ciples to be concerned in outward Wars and Fightings; So I could also produce divers instances, that from the begin∣ning it was not against our principles to be concerned in outward Government. I shall at present only mention two.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Edward B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rroughs,</HI> in his book entituled <HI>A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust and righteous Plea, presented to the King of</HI> England &amp;c. declares to the King and Council, in the name o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as may be seen in p. 784 785 of his <HI>Col∣lection</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> above) that,
<Q>We do acknowledge Go∣vernment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rule and Magistracy to be an Ordinance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and instituted of him, to be exercised among the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of men. And we beleive rhere ought to be Rule and Government and Authority, exercized and execu∣ted in every Kingdom, Nation, City and Country, for the end aforesaid; to wit, that Evil doers may be made afraid and corrected, limited, restrained and subdued, that sin and transgression may be suppressed, and truth and righteousness promoted, and them that do well praised, and strengthned. And this is the very end of outward government of Kings, Princes, or other amongst men upon the Earth; even that the outward man may be kept in good order and subjection, in his conversation in the world, and may be limited and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rained, from all wrong doing or speaking, against his Neighbours Person or Estate; and if he do, he is punishable by such just Authority. 2dly. The exercise and execution of this just Go∣vernment▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the outward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> afore described▪ ought to be committed into the ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aithful, just and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Lord, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e covetous∣ness, and every evil way, and not to drunkards▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="63" REF="000948_0066_0FAD96F011EADE48"/>
covetous or evil minded persons, ambitious or vain glo∣rious persons, in any Nation &amp;c.</Q>
And in p. 751. he hath it thus viz
<Q>I have before mentioned, what kind of Rulers and Governours we would have; even such as are just men, and men of Truth and Righteousness, that hate covetousness and every evil way, and such are of us &amp;c.</Q>
[Mark <HI>such are of us</HI>].</P>
<P>The second is <HI>Richard H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rn,</HI> who was also an ancient Preacher and Writer amongst the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and who (as did also <HI>Edward Burrough</HI>) dyed so long ago, as in the year 1662. In his discourse with King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, the King asked him thus, as may be seen in the▪ printed account p. <HI>King.</HI> How do you own Magistrates and Magistracy?
<Q><HI>R. H.</HI> Thus we do own Magistrates. Whosoever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et up by God, whether King as Supream, or any set in Autho∣rity by him, who are for the punishment of evil doets, and the praise of them that do well, such we shall sub∣mit unto, and assist in righteous and civil things, both by body and estate; And if any Magistrate do that which is unrighteous, we must declare against it, only submitting under it, by a patient suffering, and not rebel against any, by insurrections, plots or contrivances. <HI>King</HI>: Then the King said, That is enough. Now in this discource there are two things observable; First, <HI>That we owned Magistra∣cy</HI> &amp;c. and Secondly, We then declared, <HI>We should submit to them, and assist them in righteous and civil things</HI> [Mark assist] <HI>both by body and estate.</HI> So that here we see he declared, we could assist the Government in righteous and civil things, not only with our Estates; but also with our Bodies: therefore, so to do is not contrary to our ancient Friends Testimonies.</Q></P>
<P>In p. 85. mentioning <HI>Peter Boss's</HI> tryal, he has a fling at <HI>David Lloyd</HI>; on this wise
<Q>In the tryal of which (saith he) <HI>D. Lloyd,</HI> being Attorney, pleaded for <HI>S. J.</HI> and read a case out of an old Law book, to this effect, <HI>That though a Bishop was seen to be drunk, yet he was not to be reproved.</HI></Q>
In answer thereto, <HI>David Lloyd</HI> denies, that he brought
<PB N="64" REF="000948_0067_0FAD96F189A3E158"/>
any such instance, or that he so much as knows of any such case in any Law-book whatsoever.</P>
<P>In p. 86. he gives us a pretended speech of <HI>Arthur Cook's</HI> on this wise, viz;
<Q>Well, seeing Friends that you are not like to agree, you are absolved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om your Test (or Oath) and are discharged; and we wil have another Jury that shall agree, and find the bill.</Q>
To this, <HI>Arthur Cook</HI> and others then concerned, whom I have discoursed with, say, that No such expression dropt from him, so far as they can recollect; But that he did deliver his opinion; <HI>That seeing the Jury could not agree, another inquest should be awarded, as the law in that case directs.</HI> So that I have sufficient reason to conclude, that this great noise, is no other than a false, as well as base insinuation, against both the <HI>Court</HI> and <HI>Arthur Cook,</HI> in order to represent them all, to be such manner of persons, as were resolved to have the bill found in that case, right or wrong.</P>
<P>In p. 87. mentioning a law made in <HI>England</HI>;
<Q>That no <HI>Quaker</HI> or reputed <HI>Quaker</HI> shall serve on any Juries, or bear any Office or Place of profit in the Government; he makes this reflection,</Q>
<Q>They may see what their ill man∣ners in <HI>Pennsilvania</HI> has brought on them &amp;c.</Q>
To which I answer, This I take to be as idle an insinuation, as any one in his whole book; As if the clause, in that Law made in <HI>England</HI> were added, because of <HI>G. K. Peter Boss</HI> &amp;c. their being prosecuted here, a very silly groundless story.</P>
<P>In p. 88. he publisheth a letter (or at least part of one) in the name of <HI>G. F.</HI> relating to a book of <HI>Tho. Budd's.</HI> Now that letter I know not that ever I have seen, therefore, for divers reasons before given, I shall not credit his quo∣tation, so much as to take any farther notice of it.</P>
<P>In p. 90. he produceth a quotation, said to be taken out of <HI>Richard. Hubberthorn</HI>'s. <HI>Works,</HI> wherein the said <HI>R. H.</HI> blaming a Priest, saith,
<Q>Thou dost allow of going to Law which the apostle did not &amp;c.</Q>
Now to what end should he produce this against us? The most probable sense and in∣tent

<P>His 11 Chapter <HI>Of Swearing</HI> he begins thus, viz
<Q><HI>In</HI> W.

<Q>Now observe, does not this plainly shew, that they held swearing not only allowable, but also good to be used &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> No it doth not; For though they esteemed it as a remedy against corruption, yet it follows not from thence, that they esteemed it good to be used.

<P><HI>D: L:</HI> proceeds in his p: 98 asking
<Q>Was not <HI>W: P:</HI> dotish when he brought this instance to prove the light in sufficient &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Why Dotish? Doth it not prove clearly enough, that the light shewed them, that to falsifie their words was corruption?

<P>He queries farther thus, viz,
<Q>Was it likely that the light or law in the best <HI>Gentiles</HI> would forbid all swearing at the same time when the law (outward) was in force, that allowed and commanded swearing?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Why not? For the outward law, under that dis∣pensation, allowed of hating enemies Matt 5.4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and of wars and fightings; but it is evident, some of the best <HI>Genti∣les</HI> at the same time did not; but were taught more evangeli∣cal precepts, to wit of loving enemies, and ceasing from wars and fightings▪ of which I shall give one or two instances" cited in <HI>G.

Much more might be mentioned, which, though the outward law, under the legal dispensation, allowed and commanded oth∣er things to the <HI>Iews</HI>; Yet <HI>G: K:</HI> himself saith p. 124 of the same book

Thus far <HI>S.

Surely, none more fit, than their great, original Sect Master <HI>G.

Norton's</HI> charging us with deny∣ing the Resurrection of the dead, saith thus, viz,
<Q>That they deny the Resurrection of the dead, this is also a most false charge, which they can never prove; but because we deny their carnal conceptions of the Resurrection, and hold us to scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re words, which is most sate, there fore they have so belyed us. And for the more satisfaction of the Reader (saith he) I refer him to a little book, called <HI>Truth's Principles</HI> published by some noted men of the <HI>Quakers.</HI> In which book, it is expressly affirmed, That we, to wit, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> believe that the same bo∣dy which is laid down shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e raised up at the Resurrecti∣on of the dead, as much as a natural body can be the same with a spiritual body, or an earthly body can be the same with a havenly body, according to the Scripure testi∣mony; <HI>It is sown natural but raised spiritual: And the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is an∣other.</HI></Q>
And this may satisfy any sober enquirer &amp;c. Thus far <HI>G. K.</HI> To all which I say, though this was so lately cited by <HI>G: K,</HI> out of a former book of our Friends, and laid down by him, as one of our priciples, which he counts might satisfy any that inquires in sobriety; Yet, it seems, it will not satisfy him now, for which I fear the chief reason is, for that he himself is gone into Apostacy and bitter enmity.</P>

<P>In the next place, he falls foul upon us about Govern∣ment matters. He begins first with <HI>West Iersey,</HI> the Pro∣vince he lives in; but with what truth he relates things a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done there, I refer to them selves to answer, if they think it worth their while.</P>
<P>But since in his p 104.105 he pretends to give a relation▪
<PB N="75" REF="000948_0078_0FAD96F913A864F8"/>
with reflections, upon some affairs relating to our Govern∣ment of <HI>Pennsilvania,</HI> I shall not pass over that, but detect his abuses of us therein. He hath it thus, viz.
<Q>Next, let us step over into the Government of <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> where in the year 1695 we find Coll. <HI>Benjamin Fletcher,</HI> then Governour of that Province, pressing upon the Assemb∣ly to raise a fund for his Majesties service to wards secur∣ing the Province from the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> but this they could not do, No, it was against their tender conscien∣ces, contrary to their antient testimony and principle; and so no fund was raised.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> This is not so, for Governour <HI>Fletcher's</HI> power here, expired before any Assembly sate, or was so much a cho∣sen in the year 1695. Neither did hein 1694 press the Assem∣bly, to raise a fund, towards the securing the Province from the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians:</HI> So that allowing his one years mistake, as to time; yet his charge in the main is utterly false. Neither was the reason why no mony was reised then, because we pladed (as he falsly incinuates) it was against our tender consciences; for at that time the Assembly was satisfied, they had a very reasonable and sufficient plea, for their not complying with his desires, without alledging matter of Conscience in the Case.</P>
<P>He goes on saying,
<Q>But the next year <HI>W: Penn</HI> got the Government into his hands again, and then the Assembly meets again, and now they must do something towards maintaining the Frontiers at <HI>Albany,</HI> or lose their beloved honour of having the Government: for the Queen had com∣manded it, and <HI>W: P:</HI> had engaged to comply therewith.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> A very idle story; for though the Queens com∣mands to all the Neighbouring Colonies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to maintaining in part the frontiers at <HI>Albany,</HI> affected us amongst the rest; and though, for Conscience sake, the Assemblies here could not perform <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll things therein mentioned: Yet it does not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t all follow from thence, that the Assembly must therefore lose their share in the Government. Had they not the same power of
<PB N="76" REF="000948_0079_0FAD96FDA53A6540"/>
Government under Governour <HI>Fletcher,</HI> as now, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have? Yes surely; Neither was the maintaining any thing of the frontiers at <HI>Albany,</HI> a condition of our Proprietary<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s original gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, or his restoration either. However I shall venture to say (as knowing these matters better than D. <HI>L.</HI>) That the Assembly's here, during the war, were very respectfull at all times to the Queens commands, and so for as their Religious persuasions would admit thereof, were ready to perform them. But what ashame is it for this <HI>D:</HI> L: to insinuate▪ if we so much loved the [honour] of having the government in our hands, as that for he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ thereof, and to keep that up, we would not stick to act against our principles. Whereas I would have him to know, we were never so fond of it, as, I am credibly informed, he is: Who, notwithstanding his parties exclaiming against us for these 5 or 6 years past, as not living up as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> to the Gospel dipens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, because we were concerned in Worldly Government, yet when an opportunity of a place in the Government; of <HI>West Jersey</HI> lately presented (whether for the sake of honour, or revenge, or both, I know not) he presently falls in with it, imbraces it, and becomes a Iustice of the peace; and then who but he for being concerned in Worldly Government, and it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s beloved honour too, such as it is; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough, how far his accepting o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Commission at that time, tended to the subversion of the original rights and priviledges of the people of that Province (I suppose) he could no waies be ignorant. Besides me thinks it looks poorly, meanly and pitifully in him, to accept of a Commission, especially upon such a foot as he did, so soon after his <HI>Keithian</HI> company had so much exclaimed against others, and given caution to all professing the truth, and who were in scorn called <HI>Quakers</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That they should not be concerned in Worldly Government</HI>; They were not to be Iustices, Sheriffs nor Constables; nay nor Iury-men neither, in any criminal cases, see their book en∣tituled, <HI>A Testimony and Caution</HI> &amp;c, p 1 and 2, which was given forth from their Monthly Meeting at <HI>Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>p

Iames</HI> his house in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in the year 1692. I say▪ that he should accept of, and imbrace a Commission, espe∣cially upon such a foot, as he did, after their having thus exclaimed against others, for acting in the like capacity, tho upon a basis that is just and right, and upon a foot th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is firm and honorable, is a great argument to me, of his insincerity and perfidiousness.</P>
<P>He further saith
<Q>Well, to work they went, and soon found a new name for their Act, and then couragiously raise <HI>three hundred pounds</HI> for the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Albany,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ht <HI>Da.

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is also false; for, first, It was not the next year that any was raised. 2 dly What was done afterwards, was to relieve the <HI>Indians,</HI> in habiting beyond <HI>Albany,</HI> who where at p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce with the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and having been robbed by the <HI>French</HI> &amp;c. and forced to desert their dwellings, were left in great distress And it is well known to some here, that if the Assembly at that time, had not agread to have raised mony for them, by saw there was an Es∣say intended to have been made, to have raised a sum for their relief, by charitable subscriptions▪ after such a like manner, as there was some raised here; for the relief of the distressed <HI>English</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> and who were under almost the like circumstances, as the <HI>Indians</HI> were, and which I sup∣pose <HI>D: L:</HI> was not ignorant o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out of Other∣wise wording the Act, and yet intending it for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> use▪ is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtterly false▪ neither hath he so much as at∣tempted to produce any proof of it, but unfairly imposes upon his Reader without it. As he also does, in what he ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h concerning <HI>W P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> ingagement.

but lyes and false hoods. I shall further add before I leave this head; that either <HI>D: L:</HI> had seen the proceedings, Resolves and Acts of these Assemblies, before he wrote his book, or he had not seen them. If he had seen them, the more base man he, thus, contrary to his own know∣ledge, to misrepresent them. If he had not seen them, then may the Reader easily observe, at what a random rate, he ventures to bespatter us; as also it may be percei∣ved, that as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s proceedings therein could not be honest and sincere, as he saies they were, so neither could they proceed from a motion heavenly, as in his preface he pre∣tends to.</P>
<P>But this mischeif maker doth not end his envious lying here, for in the same page, speaking of one <HI>Babi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and his company's stealing a sloop from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> saith thus; "Upon notice of which the <HI>Quakers</HI> very speedily got a company of men together, searcht the Town for arms,
<Q>supplied them with gunns, swords, powder and le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and gave them a Commission, and hired them for 100 L. to recover the sloop from said Privateers, which they did, and <HI>Sam. Carpeter</HI> paid down the 100 pound to the men, and the Assembly has since voted it to be a debt of the Province.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Possibly some may think this to be a very strait story, and as certainly true, as he is cofidently false in it. As first, his affirming that the <HI>Quakers</HI> searcht the Town for arms, this I am credibly informed is false, and that it was not the Quakers who did so, but others. 2.dly Sup∣plied them with guns, swords &amp;c. This was not likely to be true; for, though perhaps, there might be here and there one, that had a fowling piece (not that I have cause to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣pect, that any person furnished them with so much as one) yet, I question whether they had any swords at all, to furn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh them with. The 3 dly, is a third lye; For he saith, they gave them a Commission, which was not so, but a Warrant, to bring them back to justice in their own way, they being not Friends that went by virtue of that Warrant after them.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="000948_0082_0FAD96FFD105D190"/>Then he adds, and hired them for 100▪ pound Whereas this was not to neither; it is true, after the men that follow∣ed them were agreed to go, and in order thereto were got into the boat▪ <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Carpenter,</HI> to incourage them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to them, and promised to give them 100 pound, if they would bring back the sloop and men. And if <HI>Sam. Carpenter</HI> was to blame in it, why did not <HI>G· K·</HI> instead of commending him and others, for what they did in it▪ deal of with <HI>Samuel</HI> about it, and say his evil actions (if they were such) before him, in order to have recovered him? No, not a word of that then, it was Dear <HI>Samuel</HI> with him many months after that, after till he began to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er with, seperate from Friends; and then <HI>Samuel</HI> not joyning with him, he spared him no more than others. Moreover, whereas <HI>D:</HI> L· said, <HI>Sam: Carpenter</HI> paid down the 100 pound, and that the Assembly have since voted it a debt of the Province; Now this is not so neither, for there was no such sum voted; out the man will be medling with things he knows nothing of. Then, as for his saying, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was those whom the <HI>Quakers</HI> got to gether, and furnished with guns and swords and who had Commission, and were nired for 100 pound to do it, that recovered the sloop; here in it is worth one's observation, how prettily he contradicts his friend <HI>G. K.</HI> in the matter; who saies,
<Q>It was <HI>Peter B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss</HI> and one or two more vvith him, that retook the sloop, having neither gun, svvords nor spear, see <HI>Antichrists▪ and Sad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cces detected</HI> p. 7.</Q>
Yet in their <HI>Appeal</HI> to the Yearly Meeting in 1692, <HI>G: K:</HI> among others, saith as <HI>D.</HI> L. here saith, as to those vvho took the sloop. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh they both bear false vvitness, yet their witness a∣grees not together.</P>
<P>I shall next take notice of a passage of his relating to Tythes, which may be seen in his p 107. thus,
<Q>I know none in <HI>Christendom,</HI> no, not the Priests themselves but they vvill deny that they take Tythes, as Tythes, but only as ma∣intenance for preaching, and not as any other part of the Ceremonial Lavv.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="000948_0083_0FAD970090950A78"/><HI>Answ.</HI> It may be so; For what other part of the Cere∣monial Law did Tiths belong to, except to give part to the Stranger, the Fatherless and the widow; tho that part our Priests do not care to perform, to be Sure. But ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>D.

Great Mystery</HI> &amp;c. as to have bemudl'd himself, or dull'd his sight, else he might have there seen, and so have known, That the Priests take Tyths as Thyths; for which I referr him to the fol∣lowing Passages. First in pag. 87. <HI>G. F.</HI> quotes the ex∣pression of a Priest thus,
<Q>The Lord hath given Tyths for the maintenance of the Ministry of this Nation.</Q>
And a littte lower he saith.
<Q>The Priesthood is Changed, but not the Tyths abolished by the coming of any Substance. Secondly in Pag. 245. he quotes Gawin Eaglesheld Thus The Law is not changed that gave Tyths &amp;c.</Q>
Now I hope from henceforth <HI>D. L.</HI> may be satisfied, That the Pries<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s did not deny their taking Tyths as Tyths; Besides, to talk of not taking Tyths as Tyths, is Just as good sense, as to say, D. <HI>L.</HI> dos not tell Lyes as Lyes. But it is yet further observable, That D. <HI>L.</HI> ackowledged That Tyhts for the Maintenance for Preaching, being part of the Ceremoniall Law, and consequently <HI>put an end to by Jesus Christ's. Of∣fering up himself</HI>; And that being the chief Cause why our Fniends refuse to pay them, must needs be an Argument to any sensible Man<HI>'s</HI> understanding, <HI>That we owne Jesus to be the Christ</HI> And we know the Apostle saith, <HI>The Priest∣hood being changed there is made of necessity a Change also of the Law</HI> Heb: 7:2.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to his 13. th <HI>Chap:</HI> about <HI>Miracles,</HI> wherein he seems resolved to Act the part of one that would be Retrogade to any thing acted or done by a <HI>Quaker,</HI> espe∣cially if he thinks he hath found out a way to redicule it; thereof I think I shall not need to say much to it only some passages I shall hint at as followeth.

<P>This, with a great deal more that might be mention'd, was contained in the Book, which, as he was never able to prove, to be as he wro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; so let every Impartial man Iudge, whether these were like to be the <HI>Quakers</HI> Answers, or no, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notwiths<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anding all these Grievous abuses of us by <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>As for D: <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Appendix,</HI> I see little need to speak to it, the most of it being very much like his other rambling stuff, up
<PB N="88" REF="000948_0091_0FAD970750BB3400"/>
and down throughout his whole Book; yet not willing wholely to pass it by, I shall make some few Observations, as followeth:</P>
<P>In his pag: 129: under the head Of infallibility, He quotes a passage out of <HI>G: W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Voyce of Wisdom</HI> pag: 33
<Q>That they, that want Infallibility, are not true Ministers▪</Q>
Now, several of the Books he quotes I want, and this among the rest: Therefore, whether this be fairly quoted or not, I know not; Yer I believe the thing to be true (viz) That where any Minister, is not <HI>Infallibly assured,</HI> that what he ministers to the People, is <HI>from the movings,</HI> and <HI>gui∣dings of the holy Spirit of God, so far</HI> he is not a true Mi∣nister; <HI>If any man speak,</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>let him spea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Oracles of God</HI> 1: Pet: 4:11: then to be sure, it must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> which is <HI>Infallible</HI>: And as God's <HI>Spirit</HI> is <HI>Infallible,</HI> so are it's <HI>teachings</HI> and <HI>guidings:</HI></P>
<P>Now, that G: <HI>K:</HI> (as well as G: W: &amp;c:) hath wrote in defence of Infallibility is clear; for in his Book, Inti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>led <HI>Divine immediate Revelation</HI> &amp;c: p: 13: [not retracted] we have it thus,
<Q>We place not an absolute Infallibility upon any person or persons whatsoever, but we say, the spirit of God in all it's Leadings, Teachings, and Motions, is Infallible, and men onely Conditionally, so far as they receive, and are in unity with those Leadings, Teachings, and Motions, are Infallible: We say further, that every True Christian hath an Infallible Knowledge and Faith, of all such things as are absolutely necessary to salvation▪ But as to other things he may Err, if he be not watchful to follow the Infallible Guidance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God's holy Spirit: But if this Author thinketh, he has no Infallible Faith or know∣ledge of any point of Doctrine, he is a mere sceptic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd unbeliever: for all true Faith is infallible; That which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al∣lible is but mere Opinion, and Conjectural:</Q>
Likewise in his <HI>Help in time of Need</HI> he saith
<Q>Are not ye as bad, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as bad as the Papists) who openly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not led by the Infallible Spirit, and consequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the spirit of God.</Q>

<P>In his foresaid p. 129. He offers a quotation, out of <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> P's. Rebuke to twenty one Divines</HI> p. 22. thus

<P>Tho I want severall of the BooKs, quoted by him, in that part under the Head of <HI>Temporizing</HI>; Yet I shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speak a little to it, to show what a medling Man he is.</P>

<P>He proceeds to Cavil against <HI>W. P.</HI> and offers a Quo∣tation out of <HI>England's Interest</HI> Pag. 36. in these words:
<Q>We say Holy Writt is the Declared Fundamental Law of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven.</Q>

whereas <HI>W. P.</HI> says, some scriptures are Corrupted, Let <HI>D. L.</HI> deny that, if he can, his friend <HI>G.

<P>Next in his page 131. he cites an Epistle of <HI>E. Burruughs,</HI> bearing date 1661. as follows,
<Q>Keep close to the Lord, and to the measure of himself, made manifest in your own hearts; for unto that you are directed, in the begin∣ning, and in it is your safety and preservation to the end, but says <HI>D: L:</HI> afterwards, W:P: controules this plea of <HI>E.

<P>In the next place I shall take some notice of <HI>D. L's. Postcript.</HI> In his p. 137.138. he asks,
<Q>Why this fol∣lowing doctrine, so frequently preached formerly by an∣tient friends, is now let fall, and not preached by any of

<P><HI>Answ▪</HI> This is but a meer begging the question: For as he hath not proved, so I deny, that the doctrine of the light was frequently preached by antient friends i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those terms: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or those words in the above cited <HI>News out of the North</HI>; with several others cited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y him, I can∣not sufficiently speak to them <HI>hauing</HI> not the books, and by what is before written, it is easy to see, that he ought not to be trusted in his quotations, he is so exceedingly perfidious in them: As a farther confirmation of this ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rge, I shall produce another proof as follow∣eth.</P>

either, as this abusive <HI>D: L:</HI> would render us.</P>
<P>In p: 138:139: he asserts this falshood, viz,
<Q>Tis the faith or belief of all your preachers in general. That when you preach or pray, 'tis not you, but Christ in you that prays: I prove this to be your belief by these two reasons: First, You do never in your meetings pray for pardon or forgiviness of sin (Not that I have heard in twenty years due attendance) for seeing 'tis Christ in you that prays, there is no need of it, he being without<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ:</HI> He may as well charge all those holy men of old, who have prayed to God, and yet hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not in all their prayers asked pardon for sin, with the same as he falsly charges us with here, viz, with believing, that it is Christ in us that prays: And in order to prove, that what he objects against us, was not the common practice of the primitive Church, I shall produce an example, which at this time occurs to my mind, as it is rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d <HI>Acts.</HI> 4.24. to 31. where we find, that the Church then assembled together, <HI>lift up theie voices with one accord in prayer</HI> to God; in which prayer, there is not one word of confession of, or begging pardon for sin: And if <HI>D:</HI> L: be so blind, as that he can perceive no difference or distinction to be made, between Christ by his <HI>spirit helping our infirmities,</HI> in our prayers, which we say he doth, and without which we cannot pray <HI>as we ought</HI> see <HI>Rom:</HI> 8:26: and saying, that 'tis Christ in us that prays, which we say not▪ we cannot help it: Then what, or how due his attendance hath been, for twenty years, I know not, but sure I am, I have heard earnest cryes and fervent supplications put up to God in our publick meetings, for pardon and remission of sins, many times in less than ten years.</P>
<P>His second reason is this
<Q>You do not pray to Christ, becaiuse it being Christ in you that prays, it is absurd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Christ to pray to himself.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is again a meer begging of the question, for we say no such thing, as that when we pray, 'tis
<PB N="97" REF="000948_0100_0FAD965E1F878498"/>
Christ prays in us; but as above, 'tis Christ by his spirit that assists his children in their prayers, who said, <HI>Without me ye can do nothing</HI> John 15:5.</P>
<P>He continues in his p. 139. to cast many unjust reflections upon us, in relation to these two heads, of <HI>not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>praying for pardon of sins,</HI> and <HI>not praying to Christ at all</HI>; which is partly answered already, but in order to the more full clearing the latter objection, I shall take notice of one passage more in the same page. After he hath opposed the Apostles, Saints and Martyrs to us, he concludes that paragraph thus, viz,
<Q>Both Apostles and other Christians frequently prayed to Jesus Christ, as well as to God the Father.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This affects not us at all, as to what he insinut∣ates, that we do not pray to Christ, because it is neither against our principle nor practice, and if he will not believe us in relation to this assertion, yet methinks he might credit his Friend <HI>G. K.</HI> in the matter, who in p. 121.122. of his <HI>Way cast up</HI> saith;
<Q>He hath not only himself done so, but also hath heard others expresly naming the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> Although (saith he) when we express not these words, yet if we pray by the movings of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Spirit, we pray in the name of <HI>Jesus</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
And he farther saith;
<Q><HI>I have heard expresly such petitions put up in our prayers at our meetings unto</HI> Christ, <HI>as, Jesus</HI> son of <HI>David</HI> have mercy upon us. O! thou blessed <HI>Jesus</HI> that wert crucified and dyed for our sins, and shed thy pretious blood for us, be gracious unto us—O! thou our mercifull High Priest, whose tender bowels of compassion, are not more straitned, since thy ascension, but rather more in-larged—Thou art our Advocate and Mediator in heaven with the Father, our merciful High-Priest—Thou blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> thou knowest our most secret desires and breathings, which we offer up into thee, in the inablngs of thy blessed life and spirit, that thou maist present them unto thy Father, and our Father, that in thee we may be
<PB N="98" REF="000948_0101_0FAD965F93270BB0"/>
accepted, and our services also; and for thy sake, our de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ects and short comings, our sins and transgressions; that we have committed may be forgiven us. <HI>These and such like expressions, frequently used by us in prayer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth in secret and also in publick, in our assembly's, plainly demonstrate, that we worship and pray unto the Mediator betwixt God and man, the man</HI> Christ Jesus.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far <HI>G. K.</HI> All which affords us matter suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ient a∣gainst <HI>D. L.</HI> in relation to his false charges, and unjust insinuations against us. As first, Whereas in p. 102. he saith, <HI>we deny</HI> Jesus <HI>of</HI> Nazareth <HI>to be in heaven glorified in the true nature</HI> of man: Here <HI>G▪ K:</HI> saies: He hath heard expresly such expressions to <HI>Jesus,</HI> and that they are frequently used by us in prayer, as, <HI>Thou art our Advocate and Mediator in heaven with the Father, Our merciful High</HI> Priest; and which (saith he) plainly demon∣strates, that we worship and pray unto the Mediator betwixt God and man, the man <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>dly</HI> 2 <HI>That</HI> twhen we pray, we do not pray to <HI>Christ,</HI> as <HI>D: L:</HI> charges us in his p. 139: Whereas here G: <HI>K:</HI> confesseth, that we frequently pray to <HI>Jesus</HI> expresly, and that as he is in heaven our Advocate and Mediator, the man <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And 3<HI>dly.</HI> That we frequently pray, <HI>that our sins and transgressions may be forgiven us</HI>; expresly contrary to what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>L▪</HI> falsly alledgeth against us in the aforesaid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Now either it is true that G: <HI>K:</HI> hath heard these expressions, and that they have been frequently put up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Friends in prayer; or it is not true. If it be true; the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is <HI>D. L.</HI> by G.

If it is not true; then will it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all heavily upon <HI>G.

Neither do I know how <HI>G. K.</HI> can retract these testimonies concerning our friends when they

pray, without giving the down right lye to himself For it is not <HI>a little otherwaies wording the matter</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleading <HI>a little failure in syntax</HI>; nor any <HI>curious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drawing</HI> neither, that will help either of them out at this dead lift.</P>
<P>As to his charge upon <HI>G. W.</HI> in p: 140.
<Q>That of late years—in answering books—he has not taken notice of scarce a twentieth part of a book, but onely sends out something, and to please—people and that they may have something to say, when people cry, where is the answer to such or such a book.</Q></P>
<P>I <HI>Answer,</HI> First, he should have told us what book that is which <HI>G. W.</HI> hath given as a full answer to a Book, and yet scarce that twentieth part of the book taken notice of, or else to be sure he doth nothing to the purpose. 2dly. There may be the same reason shewed by <HI>G. W,</HI> why he took no notice of many particular pass ages in some certain books, which he hath answered, as <HI>G. K.</HI> shewed, why he did not answer to many things in <HI>Cotton Mather's</HI> book, see his <HI>Serious Appeal</HI> p. 8: thus,
<Q>Because <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> had not distinctly answered my former book against him: As also that the said <HI>Mather's</HI> book was filled with manifest falshoods, perversions and abuses, sufficiently replyed un∣to, partly by others, and partly by me (sath he).</Q>
Which may serve for an answer to <HI>D. L.</HI> in relation to <HI>G. W</HI>'s. late answers to Opposers (especially Backsliders and Aposta¦tes) books.</P>
<P>At the latter end of the book <HI>D. L.</HI> publishes a letter, said to be sent to him by <HI>a person of note.</HI> Now whoever this <HI>person of note</HI> be, as I know not; so I matter not; but however, <HI>A person of note</HI> I will grant him to be, in that he so abominably abuseth both the <HI>Quakers</HI> and his Reader, and like a man infatuated, imposeth such palpable false∣hoods upon them, of which I shall take some <HI>notes</HI> though he has deprived me of the opportunity of taking <HI>a note</HI> of his name.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI>
<Q>That the thoughts of the suddain stop the

<HI>Philadelphia Quakers</HI> met with, when they were so hot at persecuting <HI>G. K.</HI> and his friends, may in some degree check them, and hinder them from doing what otherwaies they would p. 142.143.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1st. That which they call persecution was not so, but only a calling them to account for their abuses to Aut∣hority here, as may be seen in the book called <HI>A Modest ac∣count</HI> &amp;c. And 2dly. It is false, that they met with a suddain stop when they were doing of it: For our friends were in the Government above four months after the tryal and fining of <HI>G. K.</HI> &amp;c. In all which time, I do not re∣member that any of them were so much as examined upon any account whatsoever by the Authority of the Place, and possibly if they had not given fresh occasion, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight have no more have been said about it to this day: For that business was not so delightfull to those then in Authori∣ty as he and others may imagine.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> He imposes upon his Reader a kind of a miracle, in these words
<Q>Since I was with thee at <HI>Burlington</HI> in 1692. I have thought that God Almighty was then fitting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for some purpose, because of the suddain and mira∣culous recovery, in great Part, of thy speech, from the extream, impediment of stammering, which thou had when I was with thee two years before; and I remember I heard thee then say, thou hadst it from a Child &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In this observation of this person of note, I note two things observable 1<HI>st.</HI> Though I know not that I ever saw <HI>D: L:</HI> yet by what I have heard, it seems to be the greatest miracle of the two, that he should be thus recovered of his stammering tongue, and yet his Neighbours and others who often converse with him, know nothing of it 2<HI>dly.</HI> After this person had told <HI>D: L:</HI> that in this book,
<Q>he had discovered and laid open the Mystery of iniquity more clearly than he had seen it done by any other: for which he prayed God of his bounty to reward him &amp;c:</Q>
he tells him as above, that Since he was with him at
<PB N="101" REF="000948_0104_0FAD966250D15028"/>
<Q><HI>Burlington</HI> in 1692, he had thought that God Almighty was fitting him for some purpose, because of the suddain and miraculous recovery of his speech &amp;c.</Q>
As if God had intended him for some great work to be performed with his tongue; Wereas the great work that has appeared (whe∣ther it be the work of God or the Devil, let the Reader judge) has been the writing of a few scandalous and reproach∣full books, all which might have been done, if his speech had been so totally taken from him, as that he could not have spoken one word.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> He falsly as well as without proof asserts these falshoods,
<Q>Such things as are indeed fundamentals of the Christian Religion, they account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icities, circumstantials, and smaller matters, and care not how confusedly they preach them. But what are really circumstantials or smal∣ler matters, as Tythes, Mint &amp;c: (and not of necessity for a Christians practice) they make the Fundamentals of their Religion.</Q>
All which suggestions I deny as false, and had he but a name, I should require him to prove them.</P>
<P N="4">4thly As groundless as well as proofless is his insinua∣tion,
<Q>That it seems People may sing the <HI>Quakers</HI> writ∣ings, but not <HI>David's,</HI> by their allowance.</Q>
For we allow the singing of <HI>David's Psalms,</HI> full as much, to say no more, and in as true a sense, as the singing of <HI>Quakers</HI> writ∣ings; but we see no sevice in either, to be sung in that formal way, as is commonly and customarily used amongst people.</P>
<P N="5">5thly His flurt about bowing the body, to which he joins, that of
<Q>the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> that live in great Towns and cities, Causing their apprentices to stand bare headed before them &amp;c.</Q>
I shall take no farther notice of, than to tell him; If he had named them, and proved his charge, perhaps he might have received a farther answer to it.</P>
<P N="6">6thly His story about <HI>Walter Clark, Walter Clark</HI> denies, as stated by him; so that I cannot but esteem him false and abusive in this also. To which I may add, as all of a piece, his envious reflection surmised after this manner, viz,
<Q>I
<PB N="102" REF="000948_0105_0FAD9663116DE618"/>
question whether ever they<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be able to wrestle down the worldly Governours with only little guns, till they get "great ones.</Q>
Scoffingly insinuating, as if we were for throw∣ing down wordly Governours with guns. A notorious slander.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>thly</HI> He taxes <HI>W: P:</HI> with
<Q>being turned Painter and seems to charge him, with denying, that <HI>G: F:</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shomaker; because in his <HI>preface</HI> to <HI>G: F's Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnal,</HI> he declares his outward vocation to be a shepherd.</Q>
As if it were impossible for him to have been a Shepherd and a Sho∣maker both; which if this scribler imagines, I would que∣ry, how his <HI>esteemed Friend D: L</HI>: c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to be a Surveyor and Planter, as well as a Iustice of the Peace and Almanack-maker, which are four vocations to the others two.</P>
<P N="8">8<HI>thly</HI> His story

And the reason he pretends to give why this was not put in the <HI>Journal,</HI> viz,
<Q>It would be enough to give the lye to his pretended spirit of discerning.</Q>

Neither would the inserting the thing in the <HI>Journal,</HI> as it really was, have given the lye to the spirit of discerning, <HI>G: F:</HI> was endu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with.</P>

To which I shall onely say, These are very high charges; but the proofs not <HI>made</HI> to <HI>appear,</HI> and therefore refer the Reader to the books of the Friends mentioned by him, both their answers to <HI>G: K:</HI> and Reply<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to <HI>G: K's:</HI> answers to theirs.</P>
<P N="12">12<HI>thly.</HI> As to his saying,
<Q>They thrust in the <HI>Revolution of souls</HI> into the present controversy, though it be no part of the Controversy.</Q>
I <HI>answer.</HI> If <HI>G: K:</HI> will limpose such doctrines upon us, and controvert such points with us, as he cannot (at least to our understandings) make out without introducing this notion of the <HI>Revolution of souls</HI>; This very practice makes the said notion become a part of the Controversy. But that <HI>G: K:</HI> hath so done, is made appear, in the book stiled <HI>A Modest Account &amp;c.</HI> therefore the <HI>Revolutions</HI> is part of Controversy.</P>
<P>And now being about to conclude, I shall take notice of an expression of <HI>D: L</HI>'s: in his p. 140, which is this,
<Q>Now I sincerely profess, that I have done nothing herein but with an honest design, not having wilfully or know∣ingly wronged either books or Authors, in any one passa∣ge.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Therefore I having detected him, and hereby given him to know, that he hath wronged both books and Authors, and that in many passages, he ought now to acknowledge it: For if we could believe his design to be honest and sincere; yet we must needs conclude, that he has wofully mist it in the management; and to make it the more observable to the Reader, as well as to himself, I shall here present to his immediate view a summary collection of a few of the many which might be produced out of this book, he is chargable with.</P>

<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> False it is which he objects against <HI>G: W:</HI> in his p: 30, where he affirms, that
<Q><HI>G: W:</HI> quarrels with the word <HI>God-man</HI></Q>
For according to the place he refers to as cited by himself, <HI>G: W:</HI> speaks thus
<Q>As for those expressions <HI>God man</HI> being born of <HI>Mary,</HI> we do not find them in the scriptures, nor do we read that <HI>Mary</HI> was the Mother of God, but in the Popes Canons &amp;c.</Q>
So that the word <HI>God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man</HI> is not what G: <HI>W:</HI> objects a∣gainst, but <HI>God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man</HI> born of <HI>Mary</HI>; which much alters the case; for to say, God as well as man was born of <HI>Mary,</HI> was too like the Pope's calling <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother of God; for that which was <HI>conceived in her</HI> was <HI>of the holy ghost</HI> but not the holy ghost. <HI>Matt.</HI> 1:20.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> False it is which he quotes in the same page out of G: <HI>W</HI>'s book stiled <HI>Quakers Plainness,</HI> viz,
<Q>That Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, That he is God man, &amp;c.</Q>
Whereas there is no such thing said there for G: <HI>W:</HI> in that place giving some account of our faith, saith,
<Q>Which is that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is come in the flesh, and that he is God man the son of God; yea and God manifest in the flesh &amp;c.</Q>
But not one word of his being God man. No, it only looks like a trick of <HI>D: L:</HI> to render G: <HI>W:</HI> opposite to himself in relation to the former passage, pos∣sibly thinking we were so ignorant, that we could not find out these his unfair and unjust dealings. For that which G: W: makes two words of, with a right disstinguishing▪ stop <HI>D: L:</HI> makes but one with a dash between, thus▪ God man, without any distinguishing stop as G: W: hath it thus, God-man.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> False it is that W: P: (as he affirms p: 5:) says <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> p: 14.
<Q>If the only God is the Father,
<PB N="105" REF="000948_0108_0FAD96655F57AA98"/>
and Christ be the only God, then is Christ the Father, which is ridiculous and shamefull.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>thly</HI> False it is that <HI>W: Ps</HI> says (according to his quo¦tation p. 6. out of <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> p. 22) that
<Q>Christ could not pay what was not his own [debt].</Q></P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>thly</HI> False is his assertion in the same page▪ that
<Q><HI>W: P:</HI> holds, that Christ had a debt of his own to satisfy to God.</Q></P>
<P N="7">7 <HI>thly</HI> False it is which in p. 14. he pretends to cite out of <HI>G: W's Christian Quaker</HI> p. 212,
<Q>That we plead for the Righteousness of a creature [i. e. Christ as man] or mans own righteousness.</Q>
For there is no such word as [Christ as man] as I have a fore shown.</P>
<P N="8">8 <HI>thly</HI> False it is which he produceth p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ as an expression of <HI>G: W's</HI> in his <HI>Nature of Christianity</HI> p: 29, viz,
<Q>Christ has not the body of man.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9 <HI>thly</HI> False it is which in the same page he alledges a∣gainst <HI>G: W,</HI> viz that
<Q>He denies Christ's bodily existence without us.</Q></P>
<P N="10">10 <HI>thly</HI> False it is which he offers in p. 37. as <HI>W: P's San∣dy Foundation</HI> p: 21. Christ as man was finite, viz. came to an end. For these words, viz: <HI>came to an end,</HI> are not <HI>W: P's.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11 <HI>thly</HI> An abominable falshood it is, that in <HI>Sandy Foun∣dation</HI> p. 20. <HI>W: P:</HI> calls Christ, <HI>The finite and impote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> creature,</HI> see p. 38. and many other places of his book.</P>
<P N="12">12 <HI>thly</HI> False it is which in p. 40. he says of <HI>W: P,</HI> viz
<Q>But <HI>VV: P:</HI> makes the benefit of his coming to be no more but to shew man more plain what he saw before as through a glass.</Q>
It being also contrary to what he himself hath cited as his wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds in the same page.</P>
<P N="13">13 <HI>thly</HI> False it is which he asserts in p. 102, viz,
<Q>That the <HI>Quakers</HI> have denyed <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Nazareth.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="14">14 <HI>thly</HI> False it is▪ which he affirms in p▪ 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9,
<Q>That we do not pray to Christ:</Q>
and as false;
<Q>That we never in our meetings pray for pardon or forgiveness of sin.</Q>
His Friend <HI>G: K's</HI> acknowledgment concerning us, as a fore cited, shews the contrary in both respects.</P>

<Q>Therefore I'LL give the world a sign, by which they may know that you do not only abuse, bely &amp;c. charge us falsly in this case: But also, that your own consciences tells you that you are guilty of so doing.

books. The first proposition I suppose he will not deny, and the second he may see (if he be not blind) as plain as his face in a glass; The conclusion then must needs be that <HI>D. L.</HI> hath abused the <HI>Quakers</HI> and their books. The evil of which (I can sincerely say) I heartly desire he may come to a sense of, and true repentance for, before it be too late.</P>
<P>And now, if not withstanding what hath been here so plainly manifested, of <HI>D: L's</HI> abusing our Friends and their writings, any shall yet be so exceedingly prejudiced against us, as not only to continue to vindicate him in such an evil work, but also to bestow such large encomiums on him, as some have done, both by word of mouth and writing, as well in verse as prose; We can then do less but conclude tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it proceeds not from any Christian like desire to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in defence of the truth, but that it is mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> envy and prej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the doctrine, way and practice which we profess and are found in, as well as against us their honest and pea∣ceable nighbours, which own and profess them, that hath done, and doth animate them to such proceeding.

<P>Now <HI>Reader,</HI> If thou truly comparest these Certificates with his charge, thou wilt find, that his contains several lyes. First, In saying, I came with men armed.

Also, In saying, she offered me to take any other thing instead of the Pan. Also, In charging me with saying <HI>I come not as</HI> Iohn Wood the <HI>Preacher, but as the Sheriff of</HI> Gloucester. Now it plainly appears, that in this charge there are six untruths. But if he or any other (to cover his baseness) do say; Be∣cause my Deputy did it I did it: They may as well say, The Ma∣gistrates did it, because they granted the Warrant by which it was done If the Deputy exceeded the Warrant, I am rea∣dy to answer it; If not then <HI>Daniel Leeds</HI> hath manifested his envy against me, in labouring by falsehood to render me ridiculous.

<P>In the same 95th page of his book he saith thus.

<P>Reader Thou maist observe by one of the afore going Certificates, that I said; If they could use any means with the next Court to remit their fine, I would send the goods back again at my own charge. But they used no means, Yet sometime after I engaged the fine to the Magistrates, and got the goods, and sent them as a free gift to the Widow and her Children.
