<HI>It is Communion with God in his</HI> Ordinances <HI>that makes Time there so valuable above all other</HI> 1. Pet. 3. 8. <HI>This</HI> one thing <HI>is</HI> that <HI>the Apostle would not have us ignorant of <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that</HI> one day with God is as a Thousand years, &amp; a 1000 years as one day: <HI>It is true there he Speaks of God's Eternity which is not measured by Time, nor is any Time considerable with it; yet it may be im∣proved with respect to Believers being with God, here is such an immense and universal good that we have more true soul-pleasure with God himself in an</HI> Hour, <HI>than if we had the quintessence of Created Good</HI> all our Dayes, <HI>therein we are tru∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly happy, it is our</HI> Heaven upon Earth. <HI>But if these be Ordinary dayes and under common Esteem with us, that we go not to his House to enjoy God as our</HI> Exceeding Joy, <HI>we have lost our Communion with God (and so far our Happiness) that we are herein like</HI> other <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If this were practically remembered, it might have its Influence to promove our Repentance in be∣wailing those sins and that bitterly that have caused our</HI> Beloved <HI>to with-draw. It is not that Ordinances are not as precious in</HI> themselves <HI>as they have been to us and other Saints, nor is it that they are not as suitable meanes to convey those Blessings, nor is it want of kindness and love in God and Jesus Christ who have the same de∣light</HI>

<P>AFter the many Anxious Enquiries and Debates about the <HI>Summum Bonum,</HI> or <HI>Chiefest Good</HI> of the rational Crea∣ture, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more Ancient and darker Times; It hath been at length, by Him that brought Life and Immortality to light, clearly evinced, and among Christians put beyond dispute, that <HI>This is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. Joh.</HI> 17. 3. Hence in all Ages those with whom this Doc∣trine hath effectually obtained, have held them∣selves obliged highly to prize, and conscienti∣ously, constantly and carefully to attend upon all those waies that have been recommmended to

them by the Stamp of Divine Institution, as meanes of growing in the knowledge <HI>of,</HI> or get∣ting, maintaining, and encreasing their Com∣munion <HI>with</HI> this God in Christ, whom they do value as their Happiness. And for this very reason it is that all pious souls have ever had so venerable an Esteem of the House of God, and the Ordinances or Instituted Worship thereof, as wayes and Meanes appointed unto the End proposed: which by their Encomiums <HI>of,</HI> Joy∣fulness <HI>in,</HI> and Thankfulness <HI>for</HI> while they have had the liberty of enjoying the same, to∣gether with vehement Pantings, and insatiable Longings-after (when bereaved of them) they have plentifully discovered. Insomuch that true Love, and hearty unfeigned Devotion to∣wards the House of God has been look'd at as a Mark of Sincerity where it hath been found. Thus <HI>David</HI> when making his appeal to God about his Integrity <HI>Psal.</HI> 26. 8. brings this for one Argument, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> his <HI>Love to the habitation of His House, and place where his Honour dwells.</HI> And on the other hand the decay of love to God's House appearing either in a total neglect thereof, or Slightiness and Indifferency there∣about, among the Professors of Religion hath been accounted a sad Symptome of the decay of the power of Godliness, a sign of great De∣generacy, and an Introduction of Apostacy; as also an awful Prognostick of great Judge∣ments
<PB N="3" REF="000396_0009_0FA5A8A8948DDB28"/>
if not ruinating Calamity hastning on such a People. This is one of the most bitter provocations of the Lord's Sons and Daughters when they have lost their Affection to their Fathers house, and either care not to come there, or if they do, it is with such cold∣ness formality and Slightiness, and with so little heart and hungring after Fellowship with Himself there, that he accounts himself rather Mock'd than honour'd by such Spiritless and Truthless Performances. this kindles such a fire in his Anger that nothing but the bloud of Christ in a way of unfeigned Repentance and Reformation can put out.</P>
<P>If I mistake not in mine Observation there seems to be a great falling short in that Love and Zeal for the Worship of God, and that Labour and Frequency of waiting upon Him in his House, both on Sabbath dayes and Lecture dayes, that hath been formerly observed in those that have professed Christianity in Truth. Men do not make so great, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Momentous and Necessary a business thereof, as heretofore. A dangerous condition! both as it intimates a Decay in the very Vitals of Religion, and as it makes way for God's Anger to come upon such a degenerate Generation.</P>
<P>Our Fathers have told us how precious the Word of God was in their dayes, and proved their high Esteem thereof by the paines they
<PB N="4" REF="000396_0010_0FA5A8AA259C8A40"/>
were wont to take in travelling many a mile to a Sermon in there own Land; as also by their Leaving <HI>All</HI> to follow the Lord some Thou∣sands of Miles into a Wilderness, that they might freely Enjoy the liberties of his House, and obtain Communion with Him there.</P>
<P>With what an ill face then it does look, that we should flagg in our Affections <HI>to,</HI> and grow Cold in our Attendance <HI>on</HI> those high and va∣luable enjoyments that our Fathers purchased at so dear a Rate, I leave to the sad and serious Consideration of all thinking Christians. Sun∣dry proffitable Lectures round about us quite laid down! And some who keep up Lectures (especially in Country-Towns, where the Ar∣guments of a Market and other secular Business do not induce People to afford their Attend∣ance) are ready to think whether they were not better lay them down also than preach to bare walls, or at least to such thinn Congre∣gations.</P>
<P>My Aym in choosing <HI>this Text,</HI> at <HI>this Time,</HI> and in <HI>this Place,</HI> of general Resort is to bear my Testimony against this growing and dange∣rous Evil, and to endeavour the reviveing of the <HI>first Love</HI> and ancient Affection to the <HI>House</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> of God, as not knowing where∣in I may do better service for our God, and for the People of our God, than by raising the Re∣putation of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>God</HI> among us.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="000396_0011_0FA5A8AACF27E9D0"/>
And the words read furnish me with a suit∣able <HI>Medium</HI> unto such an end, taken from the Topick of Gain and Profit that will redound unto the behoof of them that are serious there∣in. An Argument which if it be Demonstra∣tively urged, and God shall please to <HI>set in</HI> therewith, we shall not need doubt of some good Success. Gain smells sweet in most mens Nostrils. He that baits his hook with Profit, may expect not to toyl in vain, provided it be understood and realized. So sweet and allure∣ing a sound does Gain make, that he who can <HI>harp well upon</HI> that <HI>string</HI> may hope for an at∣tentive Auditory. Therefore doth the Lord bait the net of his Gospel which he lets down in his House with a promise of a great Re∣ward unto all that shall be drawn thereinto. Would men be convinced that there is no way of spending Time so much to advantage as in the House of God, it is to be hoped that the end would be answered. When matter of Gain was discoursed by <HI>Demetrius</HI> and the Craftsmen on the one hand, and Danger of Losing their Religion (tho' indeed it was no Religion) on the other hand (<HI>Act.</HI> 19. 34.) it drew the whole City together, and made them continue for two houres space in one constant Cry to proclaim their Devotion to∣ward <HI>Diana</HI> of the <HI>Ephesians.</HI> Mee-thinks the greater Gain to be gotten by waiting on God
<PB N="6" REF="000396_0012_0FA5A8AE78B87A30"/>
in his House, with the danger of losing our Religion (which by the neglect of that duty is eminently endangered,) should have a greater Influence, and oblige us to attendance, and that with all Seriousness and Joyfulness. Why should not the whole City come together, and spend the two hours allotted for this Exercise in the Worship of the true God, with as great readiness and as little weariness as they did in the service of an Idol?</P>
<P>There needs not much to be said to the Con∣text in order to the clearing of the Text. Briefly, the Psalm seems plainly to have a Re∣ference to some Time wherein the <HI>Psalmist</HI> was deprived of the Liberties of Gods House, which he looks at as a sore Affliction, and does very Pathetically and feelingly bewail the same, adding vehement Soul-longings, even unto fainting, with reiterated and sundry wayes en∣forced supplications that he might be repossess'd of those (at present lost) Priviledges.</P>
<P>Take the Text as related to the Context and it Contains one Reason of the above-mention∣ed Longings and Cryings after the House of God, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> because he saw it to be a place far more for his advantage to dwell in, it was by many degrees better being there than elswhere. And there to be where it is best to be, should be every mans desire.</P>
<P>Take the words seperatly considered in them∣selvs
<PB N="7" REF="000396_0013_0FA5A8B08A810E70"/>
and they are a comparison between a Day spent in the Courts of God's House, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>where; and the preference is given to a day there, and that by the difference of a Thousand to One.</P>
<P><HI>A Day in thy Courts is better than a Thousand,]</HI> Or it may be read <HI>A Day is,</HI> good <HI>in thy Courts above a Thousand.</HI> The Comparative degree [<HI>better</HI>] being so rendered <HI>good before.</HI> Or I know not why it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as well read <HI>[A good day in thy Courts is before a Thousand.]</HI> The House of God is a good place, and all our dayes <HI>there</HI> are good da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in themselves, and its our own fault if they be not so to us.</P>
<P>But I shall not Criticise upon it, the sense comes all to one.</P>
<P>[<HI>A day</HI>] and by like reason a <HI>part</HI> of a day when we spend not the whole day there; there being no Necessity of taking [<HI>Day</HI>] here for a day in propriety of speech, either natural or Artificial: But it may intend any part or por∣tion of Time, less or more that is appointed for that Imployment.</P>
<P>[<HI>In thy Courts</HI>] A Court is a place or space of Ground, more peculiarly impropriated and belonging to the use of an House, sequest∣red or distinguished from that which lies in Common, and through which we have admit∣tance to the House. Take it as referring and belonging to the <HI>Temple,</HI> and then it intends
<PB N="8" REF="000396_0014_0FA5A8B3258D3090"/>
that place adjoyning to the same, into which the people might come to worship God, and to hear his Word read and expounded, and so the Court by a <HI>Metonymie</HI> may be put for the Worship there performed, and the Fellowship with God there obtained. So that when <HI>Da∣vid</HI> speaks of his <HI>faintings for God's Courts,</HI> and his <HI>longings to be there,</HI> he intends to intimate his great Affection <HI>for,</HI> and desire <HI>after</HI> draw∣ing near to God in the Publique Instituted Worship of his House, from which he was now banished. And as their Temple Worship was a Type of our <HI>Gospel Worship;</HI> So to us it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> signifie (and we may improve the whole Psalm to teach us) the worth and glory of the Wor∣ship of God in his House, how it is to be value∣ed or esteemed by us.</P>
<P><HI>Better than a Thousand] i. e.</HI> abundantly better, many degrees better, a certain num∣ber being put here for an Uncertain, and it is to shew that there is as Vast and Inexpressible Difference between them, and that the Prefer∣ence is by many degrees to be given to the House of God: and that there is no Compari∣son between spending of time there and else∣where. He instanceth in a Thousand, and yet tells us that does not reach it, for <HI>one day</HI> there <HI>is beter than a Thousand,</HI> and if you should Add a Thousand more, it would still hold true.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000396_0015_0FA5A8B3ADA3E238"/>
The Words then contain this Doctrinal Conclusion, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<Q>Doct. That it is an exceeding profitable way of spending Time, to spend it in the Publique Wor∣ship of God in his House.</Q>
<P>The best way by a Thousand to one of im∣proving Time, is to Improve it in the way of publique instituted worship. There is more than a Thousand to one difference between Time spent in God's House, and spent any where else. Excellent is the advantage that we may make of Time by using it in the Pub∣lick Worship of God, above any other way imaginable.</P>
<P>Time is one of the rarest Jewels and most precious Talents, with which the Lord is be∣trusting us in this World, our Felicity both here and hereafter depending upon the <HI>well-im∣proving,</HI> of it, and man's Misery arising from hence, because he does not know his Season.</P>
<P>Then of excellent use must this Truth needs be, which tells us how to <HI>husband our Time</HI> after the best manner, so as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make it turn most to account. They that have but little Time had need enquire how they shall doe to make the most of it, why the <HI>Doctrine</HI> directs in that great Enquiry, Spend as much of it as you can in the House of God, Visit God at his House as
<PB N="10" REF="000396_0016_0FA5A8B5A8E62760"/>
oft as you may, Lose no opportunity of being with God <HI>there;</HI> Nothing will be so beneficial to you as your so doing.</P>
<P>And the Doctrine speaks of Publick Wor∣ship in Gods's House, for it is that which the Text and Context intend.</P>
<P>For the proof of this Assertion, there needs the less to be said, because it is so plainly and positively affirmed in the Text, being Com∣mended to our belief not only by the Testimo∣ny of <HI>David,</HI> (a man so able to judge of the worth of a day in God's House, unto which both by the Enjoyment and Want thereof he had been advantaged,) but also coming to us with the <HI>stamp</HI> of Divine Authority upon it. The Spirit of God in <HI>David</HI> gives this Price of a <HI>Day in Gods House,</HI> and therefore we may take it so, and be assured it is not overprized.</P>
<P>Yet because it is so little practically believed it may not be amiss to spend some Time in the Demonstrating thereof.</P>
<P>Now the Text saith that <HI>a day spent in the House of God, is better than a Thousand dayes,</HI> it doth not say <HI>where,</HI> or <HI>how spent,</HI> but leaves it indefinitely, and may be understood of so many dayes spent any where else that we may imagine; and we shall find that Time spent in the House of God is better than any other where.</P>
<P>We may therefore illustrate and prove this
<PB N="11" REF="000396_0017_0FA5A8B733171230"/>
Truth by considering the various wayes of Spending Time, and comparing the advantage gained by being in the House of God, above what is to be gotten other where, the difference will appear, and the Preference be found where the Doctrine places it.</P>
<P>Time is spent either in Idleness or Action, in doing <HI>Nothing</HI> (if at least it be possible for a man at any time not to doe something, as in a sense it is) Or <HI>Something.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Then, <HI>To spend Time in the House of God is a Thousand times better than to spend it in Idle∣ness;</HI> For of Idleness comes no goodness. <HI>In all Labour there is profit, but the talk of the lips tendeth only to Poverty. Prov.</HI> 14. 23. And I fear many an hour that should be spent in God's House is spent so. He that is doing nothing, is getting nothing; for <HI>of nothing comes nothing.</HI> If Conscience tell thee thou hast been standing Idle in the Market place, or doing nothing in thine own house or else-where, thou hadst a Thousand times better been at a Sermon, for there thou might'st have done &amp; gotten some∣thing. A day in the House of God is a Thou∣sand times better than doing (and so getting) nothing, there being no Comparison between something and nothing. Thò also it is worse than so because it is a sin to be Idle, Yea and a most pernicious and ruinating evil; that
<PB N="12" REF="000396_0018_0FA5A8B775D2CF00"/>
which exposes men to Tentation, and is the occasion of any thing that is sinful. <HI>Idleness was one of the sins of Sodom</HI> (Ezek. 16. 49.)</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>If men are doing something and not utter∣ly idle, yet if not well employed, it's a Thousand times better to be in the House of God.</HI> They may not be Sleeping, Idleing, Sitting still, but very busie, and yet if not a doing good, but e∣vil, the dreadful wages that will surely be paid to such in the issue, will plentifully evince this Truth. Every sinner shall one day <HI>say, I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not. Job.</HI> 33. 27. Sin may be sweet in the committing, but bitterness in the end. <HI>Stollen waters are sweet,—but—the dead are there. (Prov. 9. ult.</HI>) Is not much of that Time which is by some spent in the House of God to their great Advantage, by others else-where mispent in Drinking, Carrousing, Gameing, in Riotting and Drunkenness, in Chambering and Wantonness? And what pro∣fit will you find in these things when your ac∣count comes to be made up? The Apostle makes that Appeal to them after they were en∣lightened and sanctified, (and so best able to judge <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 20, 21.) <HI>What fruit had yee while servants of Sin?</HI> what wages for your service? Shame and Death being the end of those waies; Then you had a Thousand times
<PB N="13" REF="000396_0019_0FA5B6C1A2CC0908"/>
better been in the House of God, seeking Glo∣ry and Life.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Time spent in God's House is better than spent about any secular Business or Worldly Con∣cerns.</HI> It's Lawful, yea a Duty to be diligent in your particular Callings, God hath Com∣manded us in the sweat of our brows to get our Bread, and enjoyned us six dayes to la∣bour and doe all that we have to doe, and he hath promised us if we acknowledge him in our waies, to direct our pathes, to prosper us whithersoever we turn our selves, to bless our Labour in the House and Field &amp;c. In all this our Labour there is Profit, but yet no such Profit or gain as is to be had in the House of God. Let men be in their Fields, Gardens, Orchards, in their Shops &amp; Ware-houses let them be Labouring, Merchandizing there, and have never so many advantages before them to get by their Commodities, let them buy and sell and get gain, and as much gain as they would propose to themselves, or could wish; yet still one day in God's House is bet∣ter than a Thousand thus improved. God gives greater wages for working in his House than can be gotten with all our paines and Contrivance in our own. If Farms and Mer∣chandize interfere with your Call of the Gos∣pel, if worldly Cares and Business prove Thorns to Choak th Word, to deaden your

Affections thereto, draw away your Spirits therefrom, and hinder your fruitfulness under the same; they are to be lookt upon as Snares and Traps and Cheaters, and to be treated ac∣cordingly: But use these things how you will, with never so much Care and Circumspection, still your Time in the House of God will be found your best Time.</P>
<P N="4">4. I may add, that <HI>Time is better spent in God's House, than in Religious duties in a private way; Nor can one spend that Time</HI> lawfully, <HI>much less,</HI> profitably <HI>in private devotions, which is appointed for publick Worship, if God gives him an opportunity of enjoying it.</HI></P>
<P>Going to the House of God with the Com∣pany that keep Holy day, is far more eligible &amp; profitable than tarrying at home tho' a man should read a better Sermon in his own House than he may hear in God's House. Doubtless <HI>David</HI> had his waies of secret Communion with God while in the Wilderness, but he was so far from being satisfied therewithal, that those Tasts he had there served only to increase his hungerings, pantings, breathings after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sanct∣uary, and seeing the Glory of God in the beauty of Holiness, which he had seen there. And that is indeed one principal use of pri∣vate Devotions, to prepare us <HI>for,</HI> and in∣crease our desires <HI>after</HI> Publique Ordinances

and Fellowship with God in them. To take up with them in the Neglect of the other, is crosse to one of their main ends, and very injurious to our selves.</P>
<P>For the further prove∣ing of this Doctrine, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Gurnal'<HI>s Epist. De∣dicat. to his Spiritual Armour. pt.</HI> 1. <HI>pag.</HI> 3.</NOTE> I shal give these 2 reasons</P>
<P>Reas. 1. <HI>Because there are a Thousand times better things to be gotten in the House of God than els-where;</HI> and therefore a Day <HI>there,</HI> is better than a Thousand.</P>
<P>Reas. 2. <HI>Because the attending on God in his House, is the only sure way to get not only those things so much better in value, but even those other things also over and above, for the getting of which the House of God is too frequently neglected.</HI></P>
<P>If these two Things be demonstrated, the Doctrine will be abundantly evinced.</P>
<P>The former Reason or Argument may be thus framed.</P>
<P><HI>That place where there are things to be seen and enjoyed that are a Thousand times better than those to be had else where, is the place in which to be one day is better than a Thousand,</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the House of God is the place where there are things to be seen and enjoyed that are a Thousand times beter than those that are to be had else∣where;</HI>—Therefore one day <HI>there</HI> is better than a Thousand.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="000396_0022_0FA5B6C329FDE4A8"/>
Of the former.</P>
<P>Here be the best things to be seen and gotten, Profit, Pleasures, Honour are the Idols that the world wonders after, that they sacrifice their Time, strength and spirits unto: Now that which is true Profit or Gain, real Honour, substantial Pleasure is here, and here only to be had.</P>
<P>Here are true Riches, the Jewel of inestima∣ble value, which he that gets, gets more than the whole world is worth, and this Pearl is hid in the Field of the Gospel, inclosed within the Pale of the Courts of Gods House. The product of the Toyl and travel of many a day, is only a little earth. let a man search <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and down the world, Compass Sea and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ransack the Bowels of the Earth for the hid∣den Treasures that are there, Tire out himself in the Multitude of his way, Waste away his Time, and wear away his strength, rise up early and go to bed late and eat the bread of Carefulness, and when all is done, what hath he gained? why a very small portion, a poor pittance, that which is so far from deserving the Name of profit that it is a meer vanity and vexation of spirit. <HI>Solomon</HI> look'd upon his Houses, Lands, Gardens, Orchards, Men-ser-vants, and Maid-servants, with whatever else he had spent so much time about in the world, and finds that there was <HI>no profit under the Sun;</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="000396_0023_0FA5B6C42EE62E08"/>
but in this Market is that rich Commodity to be had which he is a wise Merchant who sells all that he has to purchase. It is the Scope of Christ (<HI>Prov.</HI> 8.) to prevail with men to hear∣ken to his voice, come to his House, wait day∣ly at his Posts, that being instructed by him they might be followers of him; Now because he knew men would object the necessity of attend∣ing their worldly Business, Farmes &amp; Merchan∣dize &amp;c He therefore obviates that Objection, that there was more Gain to be gotten at his house than in their own Farmes, more profit by hearing his voice than by tilling their Fields, plowing their Land, or by buying &amp; selling, and lets them know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Revenues &amp; Merchandize was better than choice Silver or fine Gold, that all the wealth of the world was not to be com∣pared therewith. <HI>ver.</HI> 10, 11, 12. with <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. 13, 14, 15. It is Rational that men should lay out their mony where they may have the most suitable Commodities &amp; best Peniworths, then come to me (faith Christ) to my House, the Gospel-market, hear and your souls shall live, do not lay out your <HI>mony for that which is not bread Isa.</HI> 55. 1, 2, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As for Pleasures and Delights there are none like those that are to be had in God's House. There is more Sweetness in one hour's Fellow∣ship with God in his House than in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he pleasures of sin for a whole Life-time. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what plentiful Provision the Lord makes

The Lord in his House makes such provision as abundantly exceeds what is to be found in any other, and those that seriously attend there, do find abundant satisfaction therein. <HI>Psal.</HI> 36. 8.—And as for matter of Honour, none like that which God puts upon them who honour him, as all diligent con∣scientious waiters upon him in his House emi∣nently do. It is their glory to come near him and behold his Glory, and there (as in the Context <HI>ver.</HI> 11.) he gives glory and that is true Honour indeed. It is the Honour and Glory of <HI>Angels</HI> to be waiting upon God in his upper House of Glory, &amp; of <HI>Men</HI> to wait upon him in his lower house of the visible Church, where we may both see, speak of and partake in his Glory. To be admitted unto near ap∣proaches to God in his House is a greater Ho∣nour &amp; dignity than to be admitted to stand <HI>be∣fore</HI> &amp; converse <HI>with</HI> the greatest Potentates upon earth. If men account themselves much honour'd by the Company of great men, much more Ho∣nour is it to be in the <HI>Company</HI> and dwell in the <HI>House</HI> of the Great God.</P>
<P>And that which commends the good things of God's House to us above all other, is that they are soul-Blessings, soul-profit, soul-plea∣sures
<PB N="19" REF="000396_0025_0FA5B6C6D254EEA0"/>
&amp;c. Now as much as the Soul is bet∣ter than all the world, so much does soul-pro∣fit exceed all other profits whatsoever; A little soul-good is infinitly better than a great deal of worldly good, and consequently soul-loss is the worst loss. Suppose you should gain a lit∣tle worldly profit or pleasure while you migh have been at a Sermon, yet you lose soul-profit <HI>&amp;</HI> pleasure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> while, &amp; then your loss exceeds your gain. Suppose you should be filling your purse by the one, you are thinning your souls by the other; you get bodily refreshment, comfort &amp;c but you lose soul-benefit, and souls-pining will not be recompensed by your estates-thrive∣ing. <HI>Isa.</HI> 55. 3. <HI>hear and your souls</HI> shall <HI>live,</HI> work, toyl, labour, and your bodies <HI>may</HI> live (tho' possibly they mayn't neither) but hear and your souls <HI>shall</HI> certainly, assuredly, ever∣lastingly live. If men would but consider that they have souls, and thereupon study the worth of them til they find the preference of their souls to their bodies, they would then prefer soul-enrichments in God's House above all worldly profit or pleasure in their own, but while men are carnal sensual and bruitish, minding only their bodies, and those things that do concern their bodies, this Argument will neither be understood by them nor be pre∣valent with them.</P>
<P>Oh pray the Father of spirits, the God that
<PB N="20" REF="000396_0026_0FA5B6C79CD44790"/>
hath made us these souls, that he would also make us to know what our souls be, and what is the Concernment of our souls, above all other Considerations in the world, &amp; then we should realize that the enlightning of the soul, converting of the soul, restoring of the soul, Satisfying the hungerings and thirstings of the foul, strengthening us with strength in our soul, communion with the dearly beloved of our souls, and making our souls to rejoyce in Him, the universal prosperity of our souls, and Salvation of our souls at last, all which good things are to be attained in God's House, are the Best of all blessings and consequently the attending on God there the most profita∣ble and delightful of all duties, and by many Thousand degrees eligible before all other Im∣ployment whatsoever.</P>
<P>More particularly these that follow are some of those things to be gotten in the House of God that are a Thousand times better than what are to be had else where. <HI>e. g.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1.

Dayes of being in the House; of God are dayes of power, in which God is wont by his Word to speak to the Hearts of poor needy waiters upon him, and makes sinners a willing people, <HI>psal.</HI> 110. 3. Here <HI>David</HI> met with that Word which was more worth to him than Thousands of silver and Gold, and more sweet than the Honey and the Honey comb. <HI>Psal,</HI> 19. 10. with 119. 103. He that brings his Heart (not his body only, as many do) to the House of God, and laies it under the drop∣pings of God's Word there, he by so doing laies himself in the way of Light and Life, and puts his soul under the Influence of an Or∣dinance appointed by God for the conveying of all spiritual good to him, it being the Lord's way to do all by his Word. If any of you come to the House of God on a Sabbath day, and there God meet with you and bring your souls within the Net of the Gospel and save you, then you will say it was the best way of spending Time that ever you met with. If the Lord shall please to draw you off from your worldly Occasions and allure you into his House upon a Lecture-day, and there speak to your Hearts, and by his Spirit work upon you for your souls everlasting Good, you will then be as so many living Monuments of the Truth of

this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> you will have the Witness in your selves and be able to set your seals to the experienced verity thereof.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is the best Company to be had, and such as is a Thousand Times better than what you will meet with else where. And Compa∣ny is a very attracting thing; for the sake of <HI>good-fellowship</HI> (falsly so called) is many an hour and many a good day in God's House lost, whereas here is that which is truly and deserv∣edly called <HI>Good-fellowhip.</HI> Here <HI>God Father Son</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> are to be seen and Conversed with, the Vision of and Fellowship with God are the great things here to be enjoyed. Its true, God may be seen and conversed with els∣where, but not in that manner and measure as here, nor at all savingly by those that may but will not wait upon him here. They have seen his goings in the Sanctuary <HI>Psal.</HI> 68. 24. and so may we, the sight of that Beauty which <HI>David</HI> there desired <HI>Psal.</HI> 27. 4. is free for us also.

Now if you can fare so well in the House of God as to get a fight of him, a good look from him, you will account that Time spent unto unparallel'd Advantage.

to be our errand hither, and will be an Heart∣ravishing and transforming Sight, and so a blessed sight indeed. Here may you see (the Beauty of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the manifold and matchless Beauty of the <HI>LORD,</HI> the beauty of his holiness, this is to be seen in his House which is the Ha∣bitation of his Holiness. The Grace, Mercy, Wisdom, Power, Love, and Faithfulness of God are all of them most beautiful things, and these are here to be seen. To see the Lord smiling upon a poor Creature and lifting up the Light of his Countenance over him, Oh how beautiful! Why this is eminently to be seen in his House, Temple-loving kindness worth seeing, and worth thinking on <HI>Psal.</HI> 48. 9.</P>
<P>Especially here is the <HI>Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ</HI> to be seen 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 6. and be sure Christ has a very beautiful face, He is altogether Lovely and every part of him ex∣cellent <HI>Cant.</HI> 5. 10, 16. and in all his Beauty doth he appear in his House, and there is but this one place where he delights in such a glo∣rious manner and in such a measure to shew himself. Something of God's Glory and Beau∣tie does appear in the works of Creation and Providence <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 20. but above all doth he unveil his Glory in Jesus Christ and in that great work of Redemption wrought out by him, in the other we may see his Footsteps
<PB N="24" REF="000396_0030_0FA5B6CAF5188B68"/>
but in this his Face, and this is a fight to be seen at his House. This glorious, beautiful Draught of the great work of Redemption is hung up in his house, his Presence-Chamber, &amp; exposed to the view of all comers. Here may you see all the Attributes of God concurring &amp; Co∣operating in the Contriveing &amp; bringing about man's Salvation through a Redeemer; The Mystery of God manifested in the Flesh which the Angels <HI>stoop down</HI> to look into (as the <HI>Greek</HI> word imports 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 12.) And this manifold Wisdome of God in Jesus Christ is made manifest unto Principalities and Pow∣ers by the Church <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3. 10, 11. there they see it, thence they learn it.</P>
<P>There be two Seasons when especially men desire to be and appear to be beautiful, and do therefore set forth themselves accordingly <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in their <HI>wooing Time,</HI> and on their Espousal or <HI>Marriage day;</HI> So it is with Jesus Christ: Lords Dayes and Lecture-dayes, when the <HI>Gospel</HI> is publickly preached, are Christs <HI>wooing dayes</HI> and therefore doth he then deck and ar∣ray himself with all the <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> that he may allure and prevail with men to have him, that being ravish'd with his Beauty they may consent to his motion. And Sacrament∣dayes are more eminently the dayes of his <HI>E∣spousals</HI> wherein the Covenant that was before secretly made between Christ and the Soul
<PB N="25" REF="000396_0031_0FA5B6CCE96BF930"/>
when there was a mutual Consent and promiss pass'd between them, is now more solemnly Renewed Sealed and Confirmed: Now as a Bride cannot forget her Attire, no more will this great Bride-groom of our Souls neither. This therefore makes <HI>being in the Lords House</HI> so much better than <HI>being elsewhere,</HI> because there is Christ thus to be seen: And a far greater sight it is than that which (tho' great) was but a shaddow of this <HI>Cant.</HI> 3. 11. <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> King <HI>Solomon</HI> in the day of his Espousals, a greater than <HI>Solomon</HI> being here. On those <HI>Festival dayes</HI> doth the Lord Jesus put on all the Robes of his Grace, Love, Righteousness, Meekness &amp;c that he may appear in some mea∣sure as he is among them. He puts on his red Garments, comes in his Blood and Wounds, shews the scars of his Combate with the Ene∣mies of our Salvation, which tho' heart-break∣ing sights too, yet in these are his Love and Good-will to his people gloriously discovered. Thus their eies are blessed with beholding the King in his Beauty <HI>Isa.</HI> 33. 17.

And further to see Christ come in among them according to his promise in the Riches of his glorious Grace manifesting himself to them; I say to see this, is to see the most glorious sight on this side of Heaven, yea it is Heaven it self, tho' Heaven upon earth. Hence it is that Sion is said to be Beautiful <HI>Psal.</HI> 48. 2. yea and the <HI>Perfection of beauty Psal.</HI> 50. 2. And we may thank our selves if when ever we come to the House of God we do not see these matchless Sights, for Jesus Christ has promised his Disciples <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 20. to be alwaies with them while preaching, and consequently with those that are hearing, In the midst of those that are gathered toge∣ther in his Name.

This is such a filling Comprehensive enjoy∣ment that it leaves no room for any thing else. When Christ was disposed to make an eminent discovery of his Glory unto meet witnesses who might afterward give Testimony to the world of what they had seen, he chose <HI>Peter</HI> (who had made such Confession of him and was to suffer such great things for him) and <HI>James</HI> (who was the first of the Apostles that that we read of that laid down his life for Christ <HI>Act.</HI> 12. 1.) and <HI>John</HI> the beloved Di∣sciple, who was to Live long and do much ser∣vice for him, and was favoured with this Visi∣on as a special evidence of his Love to him) I say he took these three and brought them up into the Mount and was transfigured before them <HI>Matt.</HI> 17. 1, 4. upon the sight of which Excellent glory (as he calls it 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 17.) they presently cry out <HI>it's good being here,</HI> and they might have said (for they meant as much) <HI>it's a Thousand times better being here than else∣where, here let us dwell—</HI> (the very Language of <HI>David</HI> in <HI>Psalm</HI> 27. 4.)

Thus in the Mountain of the House of God doth the Lord Jesus reveal and Communicate himself as the soul-satisfying, all∣filling Good. Hence in the close of that <HI>Psalm</HI> where you have a Record of the Glorious things spoken of in God's House <HI>Psal.</HI> 87. 8. there is this <HI>Epiphonema</HI> added [<HI>All my springs are in thee</HI>] They are either the words of the Spirit of God speaking in his own Name, to shew us that in his House are <HI>lay'd up</HI> and in the Word and Ordinances of the same are <HI>held forth</HI> and conveyed the waters of Life, all the springs of <HI>Grace, Peace, Comfort,</HI> yea of all <HI>Good</HI> whatsoever are there to be had, <HI>All</HI> is there, Or they are the words of a gracious Heart spoken by the same Spirit implying thus much, that all the springs of his Edification and Con∣solation as well as of his Regeneration are there; Or that he hath no <HI>Gift</HI> or <HI>Grace, Joy</HI> or <HI>Comfort</HI> or any <HI>Good</HI> worthy of his notice or mention save what he has there▪ and are con∣veyed to him from thence.

<P>Of this same spirit was devout old <HI>Simeon Luk.</HI> 2. 25, 30. who when by the Spirit's conduct he was brought to the Temple and there met with Jesus Christ, he took him in his Arms and and blest God and said <HI>now—let me depart in peace &amp;c.</HI> As if he had said with <HI>Jacob</HI> when he heard of Joseph, <HI>It is enough,</HI> now let me die, I am satisfied, farewell vain world with all the seeming splendor and pretended glory of the same, let me now close mine eies, after this sight I care for nothing else, nor is there any other object that I can now be will∣ing to lend so much as a look unto, this <HI>Glory of the people Israel</HI> (as he calls him <HI>ver.</HI> 32.) hath eclipsed the lustre and stained the beauty of all other glory, I am abundantly replenished with this Sight, so that my full soul loathes all other sweets whatsoever, the whole world, yea &amp; life it self is now <HI>nothing</HI> to me, let me now go immediatly to the place of perfect <HI>Vision &amp; Fruition,</HI> where I shall everlastingly &amp; uninter∣ruptedly be satisfied with his likeness.</P>

The right understand∣ing of the worth of God's Word in his House as it is our appointed &amp; food so our life, would make us deaf to all the <HI>Syren-</HI>Songs that the world or the Devil the prince of it could sing us, whose design is only to delude and destroy us, we should despise and with indignation turn away from that business that would draw us away from a Sermon. <HI>I am born</HI> would the New Creature say <HI>and I must be kept,</HI> I must have food or I cannot live, much less grow, and I must do, both, or never be everlasting∣ly Saved, and in my Father's House is my ap∣pointed food prepared for me, and thither must I goe that I may feed and live.

<P N="5">5. I may add this further that is to be got∣ten in the House of God <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a satisfactory Re∣solution of those Enquiries, an Answer to those Doubts and Scruples which pious, serious, thinking souls are often exercised and puzzled with, but by waiting upon God in his House are enlightned and relieved.

A child of God is the most inqui∣sitive Creature in the world, something he has seen, but withal he sees that there is a great deal more that he hath not seen, and hence is for enquiring. Persons that are studying for
<PB N="35" REF="000396_0041_0FA5B6D6D7CD1808"/>
Knowledge meet with many questions that they cannot answer, many Riddles, Knots, Difficulties, that they cannot understand, un∣tye, see through, and therefore chuse to live near such persons to whom they may repair for Information. Hence young beginners are trained up in Schools under exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>enced, knowing Teachers, by whom they may be in∣structed as there is occasion. Now the House of God is the School where the Lord trains up all his Children, there he teacheth them what they know not, and resolves them in what they are at a stand about. More than a few are the Reasonings that a Believer hath in himself, he lives and walks in the midst of a multitude of Thoughts (especially at some∣times, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 94. 19.) hath many scruples in his mind, spends many a solitary hour in in∣ward doubtings and arguings <HI>pro and co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and comes often to an Ordinance with his head full of enquiries, and his Heart full of care and fear thereabout; but when he comes to the House of God (and thither he goes to enquire) he is there satisfied, God suits a word to his Case, orders an Answer to that question which he had been long poreing upon to litle pur∣pose, speakes to the secrets of his Heart, clears up his doubts and quiets his spirit; A notable instance whereof we find in <HI>Psal.</HI> 73. 17. the psalmist there had been wofully
<PB N="36" REF="000396_0042_0FA5B6D764521880"/>
plunged and dangerously foiled, in somuch that he was almost gone, was ready to repent him of all his Religion, and that from the Prospe∣rity of the wicked whom he saw spared, en∣riched, free from Troubles in their lives and Bonds in their Death, while himself (tho' he had cleaned his Heart and washed his hands in Innocency) was plagued all the day long and chastened every, morning; Now about this he was at an utter loss, could not unriddle this Mystery of Providence, it proved a work too hard for him, to the Sanctuary therefore he goes, &amp; attending upon God there, met with that which answered &amp; settled him. There he learnt <HI>that no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n knows love or hatred by all that is before him.</HI> Eccles. 9. 1. There he un∣derstood that God might out of this absolute Soveraignty, and for other Reasons best known to himself both outwardly proper the worst, and forely afflict the best of men, a Truth which probably he had the notional Knowledge of before but had it not born in upon his Heart with particular application to the pre∣sent Case unto his Satisfaction and Comfort till he came into the Sanctuary. Those that have Christ formed in them are often exercised with the like strugglings within them as <HI>Rebeka</HI> had <HI>Gen.</HI> 25. 21, 22, 23. insomuch that they are ready to say, if it be so, why am I thus?

abrupt expressions importing Anxiety and per∣turbation; But the Word cleares up the mat∣ter by telling them that there are two men in every new Man, and those painful plunges shall have a comfortable issue in the end. By enquiring of God <HI>she</HI> got her Answer, and so may <HI>we,</HI> and the best place for Enquireing is the House of God. Satan cannot make more doubts, the Old-man raise more storms, the unbelieving Heart cause more perplexities than the Lord in his House can answer, allay and extricate out of, and the experience of troub∣led souls will testifie that he is wont so to doe, without which there would be no carying on with Comfort.</P>
<P>In summe then, as much as God is more worth than the Creature, Christ than the world, Grace than Gold, Pearls than pebles, Spirituals than Themporals, Wisdom and it. Merchandize than all the Traffick on the Earth, as much as Heaven is more worth than Vanity, and the House of God which is an Inlet into Heaven exceeds any thing, all-things that this World can produce or afford; so much is a day spent there in and about these more Excellent Things to be rated above a day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proved on any other Account, and so the Assertion is proved that <HI>One Day in the House of God is better than a Thousand.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="000396_0044_0FA5B6D8D9347038"/>
To conlude this Argument, I shall a little further enforce and illustrate it by making this three-fold Appeal,</P>
<P N="1">1. To those that have been and are negli∣gent in giving their attendance in the House of God, cannot spare the Time from their worldly occasions, some keep open their shops at Lecture-time, others come into Town &amp; make their market in the morning and away again before the Sermon, others walk the streets, sit in Taverns or stay in their own Houses while the Sermon is Preaching, and I would ask you what do you gain? what profit do you make of this two Hours Time in a week thus saved from the Publick Worship of God, ask your selves seriously and answer truly what is your gain? how much does it amount to in a day's nay in a year's Time? why one takes a few pence in his shop, another earns a few by a small Jobb of work done the while, another redeems an hour or two from a sermon and gets so much the sooner about his occasions at home another gets a little ease, a little sheep a little drink, and idle, vain Chatt together with it, and I beseech you what does it come to▪ what is your estate advanced or your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any way bettered at the years end? Nay are you not losers every manner of way? Did they who neglected God's House whom the Prophet <HI>Hagga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> reproves <HI>Chapt.</HI> 1. gain any
<PB N="39" REF="000396_0045_0FA5B6D9C644FEE8"/>
Thing by their labour in or about their own houses, or in their Fields while plowing sew∣ing or gathering in? No they were c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsed in their Employmemnt, blasted in their Labours, the Lord did blow upon their Harvest and the wages they earned was put in a bag with Holes, all that they did turned to little or no Account, nothing succeeded with them. God is the same and the Concerns of his House of as great values as ever, and his Anger as hot <HI>now</HI> for slighting and neglecting his Ordinances as <HI>then;</HI> so that could you take an exact ac∣count you'd see cause to own your selves lo∣sers even in your outward estate, and if Blast∣ings, Mildews, Losses by Sea and Land, Dis∣appointments, Impoverishments many waies were lookt at as a just punishment from God for the great Coldness, dead-heartedness and indisposedness, to the Worship of God in his House in special, among other sins that are to be found among us, there would be good Scripture warrant for our so reckoning. Men complain Trading is dead, they do not thrive, they go behind hand, cannot make both ends neet, they rise early, go to bed late, eat the bead of Carefulness and all will not doe, No wonder while God's House is under-valued and neglected.</P>
<P>But suppose thou may'st gain a small matter wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le thou ought'st to have been at a Sermon,
<PB N="40" REF="000396_0046_0FA5B6DD9629C460"/>
and for the gains thereof didst omit an oppor∣tunity of seeing and Conversing with Christ in an Ordinance, be judges your selves in the Case whether you are Gainers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> losers. A few pence gaind! a goodly price that I was valued at will Jesus Christ say: And take this for an everlasting Truth, the same price we put upon the Word of Christ, we put upon Christ him∣selfe. We condemn Judas for betraying his Master for Thirty peices of Silver,. <HI>But who art thou O man that judgest another and doest the same thing?</HI> He that cannot find in his heart to come to a Sermon for fear to miss the taking or earning a little mony would sell Jesus Christ himself at a cheaper Rate than ever Judas did, if he had the like Temptation before him, Nay he does part with him, let him goe (yea &amp; that for ought he knows irrecoverably &amp; forever) for the love of that which he proposes to himself to gain in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mean time. If you will not now believe it a little Time will put it beyond dispute. When an evil day comes, and you want those words to live upon that you might have then heard, and that Instruction and Edification that you might have gained, Conscience wil then tell you that sinned by such Negle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and got no profit. <HI>Martha</HI> got a severe Re∣proof by being careful and cumbered with ma∣ny things, while she should have fate at Christs fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and been hearing a Sermon; and such Re∣proofs
<PB N="41" REF="000396_0047_0FA5B6E005CF1368"/>
shall you have from your own Con∣sciences one day, and should take them now. No man shall ever gain in the winding up by that Time that he pinches out of the Service of God whether Publique, Private, or Secret.</P>
<P N="2">2. My second Appeal is to those that have subordinated all other things to the Service of God, and can make their secular Occasions give way thereunto, and consequently have been and are Careful, Faithful attenders on His Word and Ordinances; and I would ask you, Did you ever lose, did you not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gain by being so imployed? Have you not cause to account those your best Houres? Had you ever any just Cause to repent of your Time so spent? Would you part with what you have met with in the House of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thousand Worlds? Are not all other pleasures and profits most inconsiderable and contemptible things compared with what God's House has afforded you? Say, speak out, that others may be informed and confirmed by your expe∣rience or Have you not found that Illuminati∣on, that Quickning, that Edifying power and Grace, accompanying Divine institutions that was no where else to be found, and that you could never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tend to any thing like there to from all your Labours about the World?</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="000396_0048_0FA5B6E044DC2018"/>
Is not this Doctrine true, have you not found and felt it true? cannot you <HI>give your Evidence in the Case?</HI> Then speak for God and for his House, stand up for the Honour of the same. Tell one another as you have oppor∣tunity of the Good things there, discourse together of the rich Entertainment you have met with, and as you meet with others to whom such discourses may be of use, let them know how you have fared there. The world does not believe that the <HI>foolishness of Preach∣ing</HI> has such vertue in it as the report of the Word attributes to it, any more than <HI>Natha∣nael</HI> could believe that <HI>any Good could come out of Nazareth,</HI> do you therefore testifie to what you have seen, and advise them also to come and see.</P>
<P N="3">3. My third Appeal is to those that after they have sometimes enjoyed, have again lost the Liberties of God's House (and those that have experienc'd both the sweetness of the enjoyment and the bitterness of the bereave∣ment are best able to judge in this Case) Now they will all tell you with one mouth that there is no place to spend Time in like the House of God. And such is the Testimo∣ny of <HI>David</HI> in the <HI>Text;</HI> He had lived at the Well-head, been often drinking of the waters of the Sanctuary, and abundantly satisfied with
<PB N="43" REF="000396_0049_0FA5B6E0F0B3ED10"/>
the Good things thereof, he had lived near the green Meadowes and still waters, and fre∣quently taken his sweet repast there, he had seen the Lord's Glory and Beauty in the Sanct∣uary and had been enlightned, quickned mind comforted there, for which Favours you have him in sundry Psalms tuneing his. Harp and Psaltery and fixing his heart to the Praises of God, and blessing himself and the people is those high enjoyments, in respect of which God had so dealt with Israel as with no other peo∣ple. But now you find him in quite another Frame, longing, fainting, Crying out like a person in great distress, fareing like a poor forlorn, miserable wretch, in a state most sadly afflictive and deplorable, intimating that the could have been glad to change Conditions with the Swallow and Sparrow, to whom he seems to envy that priviledge which they en∣joyed and he was bereaved of go what was the matter? what all'd him? why alas this was his Case (a woful Case indeed!) that sweet, precious, beloved place the <HI>House of God</HI> he could not come at, those Glorious and gainful daies which he had with so much pleasure and advantage spent were now past and gone with him, and when or how to be recovered he knew not, and he so demeans himself as one that both understood what he said, and said as
<PB N="44" REF="000396_0050_0FA5B6E1404BAB18"/>
he meant when he set so high a value upon one of those daies.</P>
<P>Of like nature and scope is <HI>Psal.</HI> 42. and had you seen him at that Time when he Com∣posed it, you would have found him in a most solemn frame, his eyes weeping and himself making meat of his tears when he had wept them, his Heart beating and panting, his soul fainting and poured out within him, and had you consulted with him he would have told; you this lamentable story, and I once dwelt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and had mine Habitation in Jerusalem, that pleasant place where the Eines were be fallen me, &amp; where I had a goodly Heritage &amp; had free access to the House of God, &amp; thither was wont to go <HI>with the Company that kept Holy∣day,</HI> but now I am an Out-cast from the Temple in the land of <HI>Jordan</HI> and the <HI>Hermonies,</HI> I can∣not come to Meeting, I cannot hear a Sermon as I was wont by the loss of which Mercy I have learnt (somewhat more than ever) the worth of it, a loss that can by no other attain∣ment be compensated.—This was the cause of his mourning, and the inward disquiet∣ment and casting down of his soul, and this also caused him to make that Prayer in the following Psalms <HI>ver.</HI> 3, 4. that God would conduct him back to his Holy Hill and to his Tabernacles, that he might again goe to the Altar of God his exceeding Joy, and promises
<PB N="45" REF="000396_0051_0FA5B6E28E55E818"/>
his praises for the hearing of his prayer, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his down-cast soul but the Hopes that those prayers should be heard. And it is to be noted in both these Psalms (the like also may be observed else where) when bemoaning his Exilement he ne∣ver once mentions his own House or his Rela∣tions or family Concerns all which were (be∣yond dispute) according to the value of each very dear to him, but this is the matter with him, <HI>the House of God!</HI> And so when he was driven out of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he saies nothing of his Kingdom, or Palace, or any Relations he left behind, only the Ark and its Habita∣tion, the House of God where the Lord dwelt and afforded his Presence, <HI>This, this</HI> I say he thought and discoursed of, and thereby shewed what lay at his Heart, and how much he prized them above other Things which he accounted not worthy to be mentioned the same day with these. Thus also when sick <HI>Hezekiah</HI> had the Sentence of Death (that was upon him) reversed, and an Addition of fifteen Years promised, he asked a sign where∣by he might be assured about his going up again to the House of God, as if he had valued his Time of going thither more than all his▪ Time besides, or as if his reprieval from the Grave were therefore principally
<PB N="46" REF="000396_0052_0FA5B6E4B43D2370"/>
grateful to him because he might have the li∣berty of rendering the Lord a further visit there <HI>Isa.</HI> 38. 22. the fear of seeing the Lord no more (probably he means in his House the chief place for seeing God) having been most grievous to him in his sickness <HI>ver.</HI> 11. where∣upon he engaged that he would not only goe up thither but dwell there to praise him all the daies of his life.</P>
<P>And at this day how many just and Righteous ones are there in the world that are begging on their knees with Tears in their eies that they might enjoy one of these dayes of the Son of Man that we have plenty of, they would wonder to see the streets and shops so full of people while a Sermon is a preaching which they would gladly leave their very meat to hear. What a Pathetical lecture would they read you of the worth of Sermons and Ordi∣nances! How feelingly would they discourse of these things and tell you that whatever outward good things are left them they do all avail them little or nothing while banished from the House of God, and how affectionate∣ly would they exhort and beseech us to <HI>know in this our day the things of our peace,</HI> to improve every inch of Hearing-Time, and that with utmost Seriousness and Intensness, to believe them while they do give evidence to the Truth of this Doctrine, and in so doing speak what
<PB N="47" REF="000396_0053_0FA5B6E4F4DD6AB0"/>
they have seen and felt, lest we also pay dear for our learning (as they have done) that <HI>one day in the Courts of the Lord is worth a Thou∣sand.</HI></P>
<P>So much may serve for the first Reason or Argument.</P>
<P>The second followes.</P>
<P>Reas. 2. <HI>One day in God's House is better than a Thousand,</HI> Because serious waiting there is not only the way to have these unparaleld Blessings already mentioned, but also the surest and safest way to obtain all other Good things which we need, and for the getting of which the House of God is too often neglected, yea and to have them sanctified and secured too. This being cleared will evince the Truth▪ of the Doctrine against all Gain-sayers.</P>
<P>This is the common Objection, Men cannot come to Meeting on a Lecture-Day because their business will not give leave, this and that work calls for their presence, or else they shall be great sufferers. The Husband-man (especially in seed-Time and Harvest) has no leisure, he must get his seed into the Ground and his Harvest into the Barn. The day-La∣bourer gets his Living by the sweat of his Browes, and <HI>has but from hand to mouth,</HI> and therefore he can spare no time for the Worship
<PB N="48" REF="000396_0054_0FA5B6E5A861F788"/>
of God. The Handicraft's man has work be∣spoken▪ and must <HI>keep touch,</HI> lest he lose his Custome, The Shop-keeper will tell you Rent is high, Trading dead, he has a Family to maintain and therefore must lose no opportu∣nity of taking Mony, and Lecture-dayes are his Market-dayes and he cannot leave his shop, tho' if none did appear to buy (as mee thinks none should that did consider that the doors of Christ's House are then open, where better Commodities are to be bought <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Wine and milk,</HI> soul-maintenance, and that <HI>without mony and without Price</HI>) there would be no occasion for him to sit there to sell. Thus when men want an Heart they never want an excuse, those that have no mind to a Duty will find pretences enough to colour over their neglect of it: But it were an easie matter to Retort the Argments upon themselves and they would argue more strongly the other way. Is not your business for Heaven of as great Concern∣ment and Hast? are you so forward, so much before hand therein as that without any con∣siderable Dammage you can spare ever and anon a Sermon and not miss it?

That even this is the way to promote your worldly Advantage too, the words immedi∣ately following the Text are a proof of it. After the Psalmist had given his judgment upon a day in God's House above a Thousand, and made his Choice of being a door-keeper there rather than a dweller else where, he gives the reason of his so choosing, and its taken from the Good things there to be had, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Grace and Glory, but lest any should say what shall we do for other things, he adds, <HI>No good thing will he with-hold &amp;c.</HI> Christ speakes the same thing <HI>Mat.</HI> 6. 33. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of God &amp; his righteousness, &amp; all other things shall be added unto you.</HI> Whatever else is wanting shall be given into the Bargain, cast in over and above.

You never knew any man impoverished by spending two houres in a week at a Lecture, nor enriched by the Contrary.</P>
<P>I have heard of <Q>a poor man being asked by a pious Minister why he came not to Lect∣ure, answered not want of will but meer Po∣verty hindred him, for <HI>that</HI> day in which he did not work his children must not eat, being advised by the Minister to come to Lecture, and promised to be paid for his dayes work he readily came to Meeting, and as constantly for his Pay at Night, but after a little Time being ask'd the Reason why tho' at Lecture he came not for his mony as formerly, he said that he found God had so blest him that he could main∣tain his Family, by his labour and spare a Lecture time too.</Q>—And if others will try in like manner they shall have the like blessing.</P>
<P>It is said <HI>Mony answers all things</HI> Eccl. 10. 19. yea but the Blessing of God in the way of serious attending on him in his House will an∣swer mony also, will supply that too.

And while the <HI>first love</HI> and zeal for Christ and the things of his House were kept up they had much outward prospe∣rity; our coldness there has brought thinness and leanness both outward and spiritual upon us.</P>
<P>This also is the sure way to have all our other good things sanctified to us: By the Word and prayer are all our outward blessings sanctified 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 5. and without this they are a snare and Trap. If men would observe, there is none but loses as much and more than he gains by robbing God of his Time, or at least he loses the blessing, and what is the outward enjoyment without a Blessing? why, it is for his hurt rather than for his good, and its better to want such things in mercy than to have them in wrath.</P>

<P N="2">2. Hence we are further Informed how care∣ful the Lord is of us also &amp; of our Good as well as of the promoting his own service, in that he does not oblige us to do any service for him, nor to spend one day or hour but so as shall be to

our own highest advantage. No Worship of God shall interfere with our profit, He will dispence with his Worship when works of necessity and mercy for our selves or others bespeak our Attendance, and he never enjoyns it but it is best for us and most for our good. This is great kindness indeed to poor Creatures that He will not be served but when we shall be profited, and has so disposed that it is alwaies for our profit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Him.

Altho' we must deny our selves and take much pains to serve God, if we do it acceptably, yet all this while we are working for our selves, and the Harvest will be our own, and that a Thousand times more than we could have gotten else where.

The spending as much of it as you may in the House of God is the best way of Redeeming it. If men were good Husbands of their Time, it were an easie matter to save ever and a∣non a Day for the Service of God and yet not strike one stroak the less about their other ordinary Occasions; and one day thus Re∣deemed, provided it be rightly improved so as to become a good day to them, is more than a Thousand dayes.</P>
<P N="5">5. From hence also it followes, that it is a greater Blessing to a People to have the Liberties of God's House than to have a Confluence of all this World's Good flow∣ing in upon them.

<P>God so orders it, that the Richest places in the World (as to Things of the World) are very poor upon this account, while his People tho' dwelling in a Barren Land have the Riches of Earth and Heaven both, in having the House of God among them. These Gleanings of Ephraim are better than the Vintage of Abiezer. Suppose a Place in a Temperate Zone, that is an healthy Climate,

<P>Our Fathers coming into this Wilderness, and bringing Christ and the Ordinances of his House along with them, never repented them of the Exchange they had made, nor were so mindful of the pleasant Land from whence they came as to return thither again, tho' they

Never complain of Hard∣ships and Difficulties, the Consideration of the Transcendent Goodness of God to be enjoyed in his House should swallow up all Difficulties whatsoever.

<P>And if we are providentially kept from the House of God by Sickness or otherwise, it should afflict us more than being kept from our own business.

<PB N="65" REF="000396_0071_0FA5B6F85D72C9B0"/>
to have lost a day from or in the House of God, should be by many degrees more grievous to a serious soul; nor should our being driven out of our own houses be so yrksome to us as the Lord's plucking up stakes, or breaking up house among us. We live in Times of Plucking up and pulling down, to be now <HI>seeking great Things for our selves in the world</HI> would be ab∣surd and blame worthy <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</HI> 45. but to be seeking the greater things of God's House, and to be most Thoughtful about the Continuance thereof, and our dwelling therein all the dayes of our life, is very becoming in us, and will be no less acceptable unto God.

Some plead Business, Farmes and Merchant∣dize, they have many things to doe and can∣not tend to hear the Word of God.

<P>If you were brought to an heap of Gold and licensed for an hours time to tell it over, and were to have for your own as much as you could tell, you would not think the Glass too long, nor account your selves wronged if permitted to take part of another Glass, nay a whole one; is not God's word better than Thousands of silver and Gold?

<P>And hence it is <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> because men are weary, they cannot stay till Sermon be ended, or at least with-draw before the prayer after Ser∣mon, and the Blessing in the close of all.

If a man should be telling a tale of more than an hour long, especially if there be any thing of Wit and pleasure in it, you cann't chuse but hear out his story; and if a by-stander should add a parallel as much longer many persons would hardly get away till he were gotten to the further end of it.

<P>To such let me say, What have you no need of a prayer after Sermon that God would write in your hearts what hath been sounding in your ears? Does not God deserve to be ac∣knowledged and praised for the liberty of a Sermon, and do not your souls need a prayer to him that alone is able to teach you to profit, that his labour in speaking and yours in hearing may not be in vain? And in special how dare you turn your backs upon the Blessing, has the Lord appointed &amp; Authorized his Ministers to bless you in his Name, and are you in so much hast that you cannot stay to hear it and share in it? Beware lest God say of you (as of him <HI>Psal.</HI> 109. 17.) because you delighted not in Bless∣ing, so let it be far from you.

Did you come to draw near to God, to sue his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the sanctuary,</HI> and to have Fellowship with him there, did you see and be∣lieve that one day in God's House is worth a Thousand, and have you found it so? why so weary then, why in such Hast to be gone? those that have met with some Tasts would be for more, if the Beginning was sweet you
<PB N="89" REF="000396_0095_0FA5B717DADDF9B8"/>
would have stayed to the latter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. He that comes for Christ to an Ordinance, whether he meet him or meet him not at his Entrance thereupon, he will stay by it; if he meet him, the sweetness of the enjoyment will detain him, if he meet him not, the hopes that he may enjoy him will keep him waiting. If Christ appear to him in his glory, he will say it is good-being here, if Christ as yet appear not, he will account it worth his Labour to continue his attendance in expectation that he may. The sincere seeker cannot be satisfied without finding, the true finder will think he hath never found enough, and therefore will not goe away so long as there is any hope of finding more. He will say with himself, who can tell but the last word in the Sermon, the last clause in the prayer, or the Blessing in the close of the whole may be intended by God as a special Blessing to mee? and accordingly during the whole time of the Duty will keep himself in the way of the Blessing.</P>
<P>Again if any should come to Meeting only for a name, to get and keep a Reputation for Re∣ligion, truly if you think you have made your market and done your errand I doubt you will find your selves mistaken; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a disorderly and unseasonable With-drawing will crack your Credit and lessen your Esteem among
<PB N="90" REF="000396_0096_0FA5B718320E3580"/>
them that are serious and judicious.</P>
<P>They are to be Reproved who tho' they pre∣tend to much Devotion, come to the House of God and <HI>sit there like Gods people,</HI> yet while they offer <HI>the lame and the blind</HI> unto God, reserving <HI>the Male in the flock</HI> for their better friends, dis∣cover their Insincerity unto the Heart-Search∣ing God, who curses such deceivers (<HI>Mal.</HI> 1. 14.) however cunningly and fairly they may carry it before men. The Lord tells the Pro∣phet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> Cap. 33. 31. what a sort of Hear∣ers he had, who both look'd and sate, spoke and in their outward behavior carried it like his people, <HI>but their Hearts went after their Co∣vetousness.</HI> Their Hearts were in their Hous∣es, Fields, Shops, in close pursuit of their worldly Concerns under the Cloak of Exter∣nal Worship. God expects the Heart, if we give him not that, he reckons he hath nothing; if he has the Heart he can overlook many In∣firmities and Defects, while the most specious Appearances and fairest Performances without the Heart, are but bodily exercise and Lip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣bour, little profitable to themselves, but high∣ly provoking unto God. Such Persons give God only the Skin for the Sacrifice, the lame, lean, seeming Services instead of the fat of heart-Obedience, and the Lord gives them as good as they bring, rewarding empty Professi∣ons
<PB N="91" REF="000396_0097_0FA5B718B4FDE330"/>
professions with as empty Expectations. They are deceived that think God will be mocked; he doth not only see men, but see into men and through them, and all those duties will be found too light for his acceptance that have not the heart going with them in the perform∣ance.</P>
<P>It was a pleasant sight <HI>Luk.</HI> 12. 1. to see the people crowding together to hear the Word of God, insomuch that they trod one upon another (and one would think it should be common among us where the people are so numerous, and the access to the Ordinances so easie) but yet even then it is obseryable that Christ began with a caution against Hypocrisie. [<HI>Beware of Hypocrisie</HI>] is a Text fit to be preach'd on before the most zealous and full Auditory. Look diligently that the snake of Hypocrisie lurk not, lye not hid among the tallest and rankest herbs of a forward Profes∣sion. Worshiping of God and coming con∣stantly to his House is like the Apothecaries Oyntment, very odoriferous and grateful, on∣ly the dead Fly of Hypocrisie will spoil the Sa∣voun of it, and make us to lose all that we have wrought thereabout.</P>
<P>USE 3. In the last place this Doctrine may be improved by way of Exhortation, and we are from hence excited unto these three Duties,
<PB N="92" REF="000396_0098_0FA5B7199721AD38"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P N="I">I. To Prize the House of God after the rate given in the Text.</P>
<P N="II">II. That we thereupon carefully attend the same, and this will follow on the former.</P>
<P N="III">III. That we so carry it towards and under those Ordinances as that we may find the Truth of this Text in our own Experience, which is the genuine fruit of our being sincere in the two foregoing duties.</P>
<P N="1">1. Thus prize the Liberties and Priviledges of God'd House, labour to believe that <HI>One day in God's House is worth a Thousand,</HI> in so do∣ing thou wilt shew a <HI>David</HI>-like heart, an heart after God's own Heart. Indeed <HI>David</HI> was taught the <HI>worth</HI> by the <HI>want</HI> of God's House: the Lord grant we may learn at a cheaper rate, usually our Dullness puts him upon such kind of Discipline. We may well and safely take them at the price God has set them, they are not prized too high.</P>
<P N="2">2. So prizing the House of God, attend it accordingly, Here is most profit to be had and therefore omit no season of being here, Wait dayly at Wisdom's posts. You may buy Gold too dear, but the Liberties of God's House you cannot buy to dear, their <HI>fruit is better than Gold,</HI> and their <HI>Revenue than choice Silver

<P>Let not any Ordinary Business divert you from a Sermon. Make Conscience of taking every Opportunity to work while the Day lasts.</P>
<P>And here let me say, If <HI>that</HI> Business hind∣ers you from a Sermon that would not hinder you from a Feast, a merry-meeting, from re∣ceiving mony, from spending an hour or two with a friend that had sent for you, or come to visit you, from making a good Bargain &amp;c. I say if kept from a Sermon by those occasions which would not have kept you from <HI>these,</HI> you will not be able to answer it to God nor to your own Judgment and Consciences neither, when they come to be Serious and Consi∣derate.</P>
<P>Then call upon one another, exhort and en∣courage one another, say <HI>come let us goe to the House of God,</HI> you that have ever tasted the sweet of God's Word, or been made joyful in his House of Prayer tell others what you have found, your Example and Council may be of use of draw others along with you, for which <HI>they</HI> will thank you, and <HI>God</HI> will reward you another day.</P>
<P N="3">3. So attend upon God in his House as that your own Experience may testifie to the Truth
<PB N="94" REF="000396_0100_0FA5A8B9AEE854D0"/>
of this Text and Doctrine, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That One day here is worth a Thousand, that you may be able to say as we have heard, so have we seen in the House of God, we have heard that there is great profit and Gain there to be gotten, and we have found it so. Do not content your selves (as many do) that you have been there but enquire what you have done and gotten there. To goe in a Round of Duties, Secret, Private, Publique without making any pro∣gress or getting any profit, is in it self irrati∣onal and unto God very provoking. You are going up to the House of God to spend a day before him there, now see that it prove a good day to you, that you may have the good of it to your selves, this ought to be every one's Care.</P>
<P>You would think your selves much to blame if being in extream Want you should come to a plentiful market where all manner of supplies are offered you freely, and you carry home no∣thing with you: And yet how often hath ma∣ny an Hearer come into God's House and tar∣ried till the Sermon was ended, but carried a∣way not one penniworth of spiritual good, soul-benefit, and it may be not so much as af∣flicted or troubled to think on it.</P>
<P>How did the Spouse behave her self when her Beloved was with-drawn (<HI>Cant.</HI> 3. 1, to 5. she rises, goes about, seeks, enquires of the
<PB N="95" REF="000396_0101_0FA5A8BC283D3178"/>
Watch-men, never rests till she had found him; and then held him fast and brought him home with her. 'Tis Finding Christ in his House that is the profit of our day's work, that renders Time so advantagiously spent, and therefore this should be sincerely aym'd at, and strenuously endeavoured by every one that comes thither. This was <HI>Mary'</HI>s Case <HI>Joh.</HI> 20. 1,—16. she got up early and her busi∣ness was not to see the Sepulchre where Jesus was laid, or the linnen Clothes and Napkins in which he was wrapt, but to see Jesus himself, <HI>her Lord</HI> was in her heart, and to see Him was her Errand, hence when others went away with no other sight than the Grave and linnen, she waits and weeps and looking into the Grave there sees Angels, unto whom she gives this reason of her weeping because her Lord was carried away, and turning about enquired of the supposed Gardener for her <HI>Lord,</HI> and being thus earnest and unsatisfied in her Enquiries at last she found him.</P>
<P>Thus should every one behave himself having realized to himself that the Ordinances of God's House are wayes of Communion with Christ and that <HI>there</HI> lies the good of them, he should make that his busines and be content∣ed with nothing unless he attains his end: It should not satisfie him that he hath been at the place where Christ is wont to appear, and that
<PB N="96" REF="000396_0102_0FA5A8BDAFE8F038"/>
he hath been at the place where Christ is wont to appear, and that he hath been under Ordi∣nances in which Jesus Christ is wont to be conveyed, but he must goe and wait with an heart fixt for Christ himself, and sadly bemoan himself under a disappointment there, and un∣to such the Lord will make good that word <HI>Isa.</HI> 45. 19. <HI>I said not to the seed of Jacob seek ye my face in vain.</HI></P>
<P>In no Duties is the Word of God more so∣lemn than about those of his House. See the dreadful charge to him that preaches 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6. 13. <HI>I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things, and before Jesus Christ &amp;c.</HI> So again 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 1, 2. <HI>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom, Preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season &amp;c.</HI> In obedience to which Command are Lectures set up; and can you think that you which <HI>hear</HI> are not under a like Charge? Shall they that preach be so charged to preach &amp; <HI>so</HI> preach as in the sight of him that will judge them for their preaching, and may you that are to hear think to scape the Judge∣ment of God if you hear without Seriousness and Profit? Does not his <HI>Strictness</HI> with them that <HI>preach,</HI> more than intimate that he will also be <HI>exact</HI> with them that <HI>hear?</HI> If they must take heed to themselves and their Doctrine,
<PB N="97" REF="000396_0103_0FA5A8C075BA8FF8"/>
you must take heed to your selves and your Hearing. If they must speak so for matter, and manner, and end, as they that look to answer it at the great and dreadful Day; you must hear upon the like peril.</P>
<P>There is no serious preacher of the Gospel but goes with an akeing heart about his work, and when he has preached is ready to condemn himself for fear lest he hath not so spoken as he ought to have spoken; and I believe that there is no serious Hearer but will see cause to ask himself, and have I so heard as I ought to have heard?</P>
<P>Let us pray for <HI>David</HI> spirit, Affection and Experience, of which there is but little now a dayes to be found.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>Take a few Directions.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Be well acquainted with the Being, Na∣ture, Worth, and Need of your souls.</P>
<P>Know that you have souls, how many live as if they had none? Consider also they are immortal Existences and must live for ever. Theu <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your selves with their Needs, listen to their Gravings, and think of what a necessity they are in, of a Supply.</P>
<P>Your souls are a Thousand times better than your bodies, and therefore Providing for them of a Thousand times more Concernment.
<PB N="98" REF="000396_0104_0FA5A8C1A8ECC6B0"/>
Oh, an immortal Soul, eternal Estate, and end∣less Life are momentous Considerations, and should be attended accordingly.</P>
<P N="2">2. This being supposed, it will necessarily follow that you are indispensibly bound to at∣tend all meanes that God has appointed for the Salvation of your Souls. Neglecting means for outward Subsistence, or bodily Main∣tenance will bring you to Penury; then neg∣lecting meanes for your soul's maintenance will issue in Ruin and Misery.</P>
<P N="3">3. Press on your souls the stamp of Divine Authority that is upon the Ordinances of his House. Here God will be found, &amp; if you slight these wayes of his appointing, he will not be found else where. And be assured that God will not deceive you. Here, he hath recorded his Name, and if you wait here, you wait un∣der a Promise of a Blessing, and shall not wait for nothing.</P>
<P>Then come to the House of God out of Con∣science, not out of Custom, nor for any by∣Ends, and if you come conscientiously, you will come constantly, I mean as often as God gives you an opportunity.</P>
<P>To omit one Duty does but make way for our omitting another. Once give way to Hin∣drances
<PB N="99" REF="000396_0105_0FA5A8C3F786E7A0"/>
and you will never be without them, but they will come in upon you like a flood: Make but a Gap once, and you will scarce know how or when to stop it. And who can tel but <HI>that</HI> season which you lose might have been for your Everlasting Advantage? The diseased persons not knowing when the Angel would come down and move the waters, lay there alwayes waiting to prevent the loss of an opportunity; and so should we.</P>
<P>A pious soul if providentially detained from God's House growes the more hungry after it, the want of one meal sharpens his stomach and encreases his Appetite for the next; but a car∣nal heart who out of sloth and slightiness neg∣lects it; will grow every day more carless and unconcern'd than other, like a weak stomach; the more it fasts the more it may.</P>
<P N="4">4. Get suitable preparations for such a So∣lemnity. When <HI>Jacob</HI> was commanded by God to goe to <HI>Bethel</HI> to worship, he advises his people to <HI>put away the strange Gods; wash their garments and be clean</HI> Gen. 35. 1, 2, 3. Every busi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> moment and Importance bespeaks Preparation. A Journy by land, a Voyage by Sea, Entertainment of a great friend call for Preparation; much more then when our work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to meet with and entertain the Lord of Glo∣ry at his House which is appointed for a place
<PB N="100" REF="000396_0106_0FA5B650B180BAC0"/>
of meeting with God <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. 23. Hence that charge <HI>Eccl.</HI> 5. 1. <HI>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear &amp;c.</HI> When there we must be ready, then there must be some time taken to make ready, and that on penalty of <HI>offering the sacrifices of fools.</HI> He that has so great a work to do, and does not prepare for it, does egregiously play the fool. They that observe their own Hearts will find that they are not ordinarily so ready for so great a work of <HI>drawing near to God</HI> as they ought to be; then either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must prepare, or rush in without preparation, and what ill musick must that needs be in God's ear where the Instrument is out of tune? the danger of which we had better believe and prevent than experience.</P>
<P N="6">6. Goe thither with answerable Expectati∣ons: We fare no better in the House God be∣cause we expect no better. Ayming too low is the way to miss the mark. If after humble Preparation our hearts are big with Exqecta∣tion the Lord will not suffer our Hopes to be abortive. <HI>The expectation of the poor shall not pe∣rish</HI> Psal. 9. 18. Such profit as you have heard of is to be had in God's House, believe it, pre∣pare for it, carry your empty vessels, open your mouthes wide, expect to have them filled and they shall be filled. Look what you need and

God promises, and you shall not look in vain▪</P>
<P N="7">7. Let your attendance when there, be pro∣portionable to your expectations in going thi∣ther. Serious Preparation and great Expect∣ation will occasion vigorous Attendance. To come with a sence of great need to a place of full supply, with up-raised Expectations, will oblige a man to look diligently lest he goe a∣way without his Errand.</P>
<P>The servants of <HI>Benhadad</HI> (1. <HI>King.</HI> 20. 31, 32, 33.) saw what an ill case there master was in, &amp; had heard that <HI>Israel'</HI>s Kings were merci∣ful, this gave them encouragement, they pre∣pared themselves accordingly, in the capacity of humble, perishing, self-judging Suppliants, and in most submissive Language presented their Request before <HI>Ahab,</HI> and then it's said <HI>they did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it,</HI> and accordinly obtained their Desire. Why know that we have far greater encour∣ragement to wait upon God in his House, we have an Invitation which they had not, we have a Promise to goe upon, wheras they went at a <HI>Peradventure,</HI> upon an <HI>it may be</HI> only: Our necessities also are greater <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> not for the save∣ing of our bodily lives, but for preservation of the lives of our immortal Souls, that should be ten Thousand times more dear to us; then
<PB N="102" REF="000396_0108_0FA5B6521346F3A8"/>
let us prepare thoroughly, come expectingly; and then attend diligently, and catch up every word greedily, withal waiting for the breathe∣ing of the Spirit in an Ordinance, and we shall find that the King of Heaven is far more graci∣ous and bountiful than the Kings of <HI>Israel</HI> were merciful.</P>
<P N="8">8. Beware how you spend your Time after∣ward. When men have been warmed in an Ordinance they had need see that they do not catch cold. Watching <HI>after</HI> Hearing is as needful as Watching <HI>unto</HI> Hearing. It's noted of the Thorny Hearers <HI>Luk.</HI> 8. 14. that <HI>when they have heard they go forth, and are choak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with cares and riches and pleasures.</HI> Many a precious Sermon is thus lost. As they are like to get but little good by coming to the House of God who come reaking out of their worldly occasions without any prae-consideration or preparation; so they are like to lose or lessen what they have got who rush into the world again without after-consideration <HI>of</HI> or meditation <HI>on</HI> what they have mett with. The <HI>World</HI> was ever a great Enemy to the <HI>Word.</HI> Communing with our own Hearts and Discoursing one with another about what we have heard and seen in God's House, will notably promote our profici∣ency under the same.</P>
<P>When the Lord spake so loud to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> in
<PB N="103" REF="000396_0109_0FA5B653AFD2E798"/>
that dreadful Judgment of the turning the Wa∣ter into Bloud, it is said, <HI>Exod.</HI> 7. 23. that <HI>he turned and went into the house,</HI> and so it never went to his Heart. Had he not turned away his eyes <HI>from,</HI> but kept them fixed <HI>on</HI> that so∣lemn object, it might have reached his Heart. And thus often it proves; many a word, ma∣ny a Conviction, many a good Beginning is lost in the House. From God's House men turn into their own, and <HI>there</HI> in the Business of the House, in the Cares and Pleasures of the House, in the Company of the House, in the various Diversions that they meet with there and elsewhere, all is lost as tho' it had never been.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="considerations">
<HEAD>By way of motive take A few Considerations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Consider whether thy own Judgement and Conscience be not convicted of the Truth of this Doctrine. Doth not Conscience pro∣claim aloud (or at least secretly whisper in thine ears) that all this is is true? Is not God better than the world, and Communion with him than any worldly Gain? And then is it not better for thee to lock up thy doores, shutt up thy shop, and goe to the House of God in the season of it, yea and carry thy people
<PB N="104" REF="000396_0110_0FA5B65411F38908"/>
with thee too, and if they gain thou wilt gain too, if they gain not thou shalt not lose be∣cause thou hast done thy Duty. Now if thou art convinced, think how it will look in an evil day, to have gone on in the neglect of a duty of which thou hast been convinced, especially so profitable a duty as this. Thou mayst possibly silence Conscience for a while, but canst not al∣waies; it will one day cry like a travailing wo∣man, and all the worldly Gain thou hast gotten the while will not stop the mouth of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Know that God will call us to a Reckon∣ing for all the Opportunities that we have had, and for all that we might have had, whether we took them or no. You shall be accountable not only for all the sermons you <HI>have</HI> heard, but also for all those that you <HI>might</HI> have heard, and nothing but a carnal, careless, vain, earth∣ly Heart kept you from. Especially you that have been idleing, fitting still, drinking, game∣ing &amp;c. the while; God will assuredly set you down in his Book Debitors for such a Sermon, &amp; he will be sure to reckon with you when the Books come to be opened. Here is the Pro∣vision made, the Table furnished, your selves invited, your Trencher laid, your portion car∣ved out for you, and you must pay whether you eat or no; and is it not then best to at∣tend and take your share in the Gain, seeing
<PB N="105" REF="000396_0111_0FA5B6563533D7B0"/>
you must bear your part of the Loss?</P>
<P N="3">3. Contempt of God's House and the pre∣cious Ordinances of the same will be very griev∣ous and offensive unto God, and such neglect will be called Contempt.</P>
<P>For God to set up his House among us, and be at the charge of continuing to us the Ordi∣nances of the same, and yet for us to despise and under value them will be highly provoke∣ing. Indeed it is a sin that has all other sins in it, or attending on it. No duty is well done if this be omitted: You cannot rightly serve God in your <HI>own</HI> Houses if you do not while and when you may, attend Him in <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. By this sin we provoke the Lord to shut up the doores of his House among us, to pluck up stakes and be gone from the midst of us. If you refuse to hear, God may justly refuse to speak. <HI>Ezekiel</HI> shall be made dumb to a re∣bellious people.</P>
<P>Let us be awakened, God is threatening to break up House among us, and if ever he so does, our undervaluing of his House will be the cause of it. That <HI>Nail</HI> in God's House which hath been hitherto left us seems to be shaken and loosened, the Lord looks as if he were de parting from us, there be many awful

The Glory of the Lord seems to be standing at the Threshold of the door. To look upon God and see him <HI>going,</HI> upon Ordinances and see them <HI>going</HI> is a most awful sight, for when they go the true glory of a place goes, nor will our other good things stay behind, as wof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l ex∣perience does abundantly testifie.

grow secure and wanton by reason of it, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they did <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 8,—12. or do not prize it as they ought, nor make such Returns as may be expected, but contrariwise profane and pollute it; Then <HI>Goe to my place at Shile</HI> and see what I did to them, and so will I doe to you.</P>
<P>To be deeply humbled <HI>for,</HI> and hasten to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of sprinkling for pardon and cleansing <HI>of</HI> these provoking Evils that have been and are among us, and to get an up-raised Esteem <HI>of</HI> &amp; Affection <HI>to</HI> the House of God is the only way in which we may hopefully and comfortably meet the Lord while he is yet in the way.</P>
<P>To conlude—</P>
<P>If one day in God's House here upon Earth be so much worth, what is a day, yea the <HI>DAYES</HI> of <HI>ETERNITY</HI> worth in that up∣per House, that Presence Chamber, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Father's House, where the Lord will exhibit all his Glo∣ry <HI>before</HI> and solace himself <HI>with</HI> his Children for ever! Think what a sweet time that will be. If <HI>now and then</HI> a Glimpse of his Glory be so takeing and ravishing, what will near, in∣timate, familiar, uninterrupted &amp; endless Fel∣lowship with Father and Son be! If they be blest that may dwell in <HI>this</HI> House, and should still praise him for the same, how will they be blest that shall for ever dwell in <HI>that</HI> House? and what soul-delighting Hallelujahs will be e∣verlastingly sung by those to whom the Lines shall fall in that pleasant place, when they shall

be possess'd of that goodly Heritage! This where we now are is but the Gate of Heaven, the Porch, the Courts belonging to that House of Glory, what then is the inmost Room, the Holy of Holies! If a day in these Courts be worth a Thousand, how many Thousand yea Millions of dayes and years is a day, an hour <HI>there</HI> worth! If this place be so beautifull and Admirable, oh how Amiable is <HI>that</HI> Dwelling∣place! Surely it is good dwelling there. If obscurer Glimpses of God's Glory in his House be so precious and pleasant, what will the Be∣holding of him face to face be, and that for e∣ver and forever too!</P>
<P>Oh then prize this House as the Gate of that, and as the way that leads us thither, and attend upon God therein accordingly, until we can experience the Truth of what <HI>David</HI> here expresses. And be we well assured that God will sooner or later give every sincere At∣Attender on him here just cause to set his hand and Seal to this great Truth <HI>One day in thy House is better than a THOUSAND.</HI></P>
