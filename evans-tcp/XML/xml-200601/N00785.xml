<HEAD>His Excellency's Answer to the said Queries.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THe necessity of building a Fort for defence of the Indians <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in all the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> since his being in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them therefore he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> staggering condition they seem at present) <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Necessity; since if <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <HI>French</HI> will infallibly make advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 'em so as in a very short time to debauch <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, let not the difficulty of building a Fort frighten us, the <HI>French</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taught us the way; their Fort of <HI>Cad<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>que</HI> is as remote from <HI>Canada</HI> as this intended Fort can be from <HI>Albany</HI>; yet that distance did not deter them from building the said Fort, nor has it discouraged them from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with Provision of all sorts. <HI>Lastly,</HI> There is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> makes it necessary to erect a Fort immediately, as much in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the five Na∣tions as may be, for the settlement of a good Minister o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Fort to instruct the <HI>Indians,</HI> which can never be otherwise expected <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be com∣plyed

<P N="2">2 To the second Query, 'tis answered, That the proper place for erecting a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the King's Engineer; but 'tis supposed, it will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Country, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Center of the five Nations, but also, because a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> built <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <HI>French</HI> Fort to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as b<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> most capable of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And in this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proper to commit the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the five Nations, and know of them what part of the Country will be most agreeable to them for the building a Fort, which the said Earl will do at the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he is to have with them this next week at <HI>Albany.</HI> Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the said Fort shall be made with Sod-work, well Ditch't and Pallisaded.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Charge of building such a Fort as is intended, cannot reasonably be supposed to exceed Fifteen hundred Pounds.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Garrison proposed for this Fort is one hundred Men, under com∣mand of a Captain who is to have two Lieutenants under him; the said Garrison to be duly paid and satisfied at the Kings charge, and the said Fort <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> great Guns, six pound. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P N="5">5. The said Earl leaves the management of building the said Fort to the Gentlemen: the House of Representatives, so far as relates to the Receipts and Payments of the said Money.</P>
<P N="6">6 'Tis not practicable to make any answer to the sixth Query, because the Neighbouring Colonies are not in the power of the said Earl to induce them to a Contribution to the charge that has been proposed, neither indeed were it safe to delay this Undertaking so long as till our Neighbours could be ask't the Question.</P>
