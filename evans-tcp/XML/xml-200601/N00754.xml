<HEAD>THE Preface to the Reader:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a Maxim that is granted, not only by all Reformed Christians, but also by the very Heathen Philoso∣phers themselves, <HI>That Truth is the brightest Gem in the Regal Diodem, and that she sets her self off in her own Attire, with a far more shining Luster than all the Praises of Poets, or the extravagant and mis-applyed Commendations of dissembling and hypocritical Parasites.</HI> And I could heartily wish it was the Genius of every mans Disposition to thirst after Truth &amp; Knowledge more &amp; more, and to place a more than ordinary felicity in the en∣joyment of it. It is indeed a noble Prize, and always rewards its adorers with lasting and inestimable blessings. And although so few are found to be Possessors hereof, yet the want of it stains

&amp; sullies the Dignity of humane Nature, but in whomsoever it doth predominate it restrains all evil Passions of the Soul, that promp him to unreasonable actions, bridles and curbs those Appetites that solicite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njustice, banishes all that inordinate fear that enslaves the Soul: It encourages all those noble Seeds of Justice and Fortitude that lead a man on to an entire conquest over his Lusts and distempered Affections; and it instructs a man to discharge his Function, and exercise his Power in a due and regular way. It is that that dignifies mans Nature, and enables to a degree of Ho∣nour much above the inferior Creatures. This doth illustrate a mans Name more than the Trophies of his Ancestors, or the Success of his indisputable Courage and Bravery, or what ever other brave Qualifications in famous humane Arts and Sciences, as well as Tongues and Languages he may or hath attained unto.</P>

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>NOw this (<HI>viz.</HI> Truth) being the subject of the following Discourse, that also by virtue thereof the contrary to it may clearly appear, so by that means the Truth may shine forth in its own lustre, is the end of this my writing. And to that end I may make an orderly Introduction, I shall briefly give the Reader an account of the Reason of it.</P>
<P>Through Grace, from my Youth, my Studies have been bent that way, <HI>viz.</HI> to seek after Truth, since that time that God in his infinite Love was pleased to restrain me from my youthful Vanities, several sorts of which I was naturally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rone unto, being by nature a Child of Wrath as well as others. But these in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat measure God gave me Victory over

when I was about 18 or 20 years of Age. Having formerly had my Con∣versation in the <HI>Church of England,</HI> being trained up according to the Rules of the fame, and being a diligent hearer of their Ministers, having at that time but a weak capacity to judge in matters of Doctrine, whether or no in that case they were right or wrong; I observed the looseness and prophanity both of Priests and People too general amongst them. This drove me from them. And the <HI>Quakers</HI> in that time, that exceeded in Life and Conversation, being much more civilized, and given to Sobriety; this their good Conversation prevailed upon me, wherefore I joyned my self with them. And having walked with them in that way about 13 or 14 years, in which space of time I did consider of some Principles in Religion. And those which came most particularly under my Consideration, was the <HI>Eternal Judgment</HI> and the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead</HI>; which things, by my most diligent search in

For they did not then believe, nor now neither (as I know of) that Water Baptism must be put in practice; and they thought also, that the Light within, or Word in the heart, was to be preferred before the written Word. <HI>Note</HI> further, their profound Mystick or Doctor <HI>John Hart</HI> did pretend to know mens hearts without words or works.</P>
<P>But to proceed, I still continued dili∣gent in the search of sacred Scriptures, in which search God was pleased to en∣lighten my Understanding so far, (and principally from two particular places, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.51. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.47. with respective
<PB REF="000908_0014_0FACA06EE159A4B8"/>
the Person of the Son of God, that I and my Friend <HI>Tho. Rutter</HI> especially (with whom I did often converse, and he with me, being helpful to one another) did clearly perceive, that not only the <HI>Quakers</HI> were wrong from the beginning, with respect to their Principle relating to the Son of God, in <HI>W. Penn</HI>'s asserting, <HI>That the outward Person was not Gods proper Son,</HI> and calling him an <HI>Impoten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Creature,</HI> and others agreeing with him; but also <HI>Geo. Keith,</HI> &amp; many others before him, that had opposed the <HI>Quakers,</HI> were not right themselves. And this gave us yet further occasion to search yet more narrowly, not only the sacred Scriptures, for our In∣struction, but also the <HI>Quakers</HI> Books for our satisfaction, wherein we found that the <HI>Quakers</HI> did absolutely deny that the <HI>outward Person, Jesus,</HI> was Gods proper Son, calling him, <HI>a Body, a Garment, a Vail.</HI> And because <HI>G. K.</HI> did use the same Distinctions and Terms, both in preaching and writing, at last, not∣withstanding his Difference with the
<PB REF="000908_0015_0FACA06FA02DBB60"/>
<HI>Quakers,</HI> we could in reason, no other∣wise conclude, but that in the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n point, about the <HI>Person of Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> he was one with the <HI>Quakers</HI> (as afterwards will appear.) Now because that we pressed in Dis∣course, and sometimes in preaching, the contrary Doctrine, <HI>viz. That the out∣ward Person, Jesus of</HI> Nazereth, <HI>was so far from being an Impotent Creature, that he was Gods proper and eternal Son, and consequently he that the Prophet calls the mighty God.</HI> Which being asserted by <HI>T. Rutter</HI> in one of the <HI>Keithian Quakers</HI> Yearly Meetings, they called him a Blasphemer, and rendered it Heresie; And my self they compared, in one of their yearly Meeting Papers to <HI>Simon Magus</HI> the witch, because I continued to preach Christ (in imitation of G. K. as they rendered it) as <HI>Simon Magus</HI> did in imitation of the Apostles.</P>
<P>But they object against us, <HI>Have all those wise and learned Men, and especially such as</HI> G. K. <HI>been deceived, and should the
<PB REF="000908_0016_0FACA070606A2FF0"/>
Truth be discovered to a Turner &amp; a Smith.</HI> And they brand us of pretending to Im∣mediate Revelation in the point, because we say, <HI>God hath revealed the Truth unto us by his Word,</HI> to wit, the holy Scriptures, wistth the gracious assiance of his good Spirit, in the enlightning of our Under∣standings in the same. But thus it is, as the Apostle saith, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.26, 27, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>For you see your calling Brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many Noble are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things of the World to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the World to con∣found the things that are mighty; and base things of the World, and things which are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.</HI></P>
<P>Now after all these things I being very desirous to be a Partaker in the blessed Ordinance of the Supper, as I had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣form'd the blessed Ordinance of Baptism. I hearing of a Bapt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zed P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ople, to whom
<PB REF="000908_0017_0FACA07124E4B7A8"/>
<HI>John Wats,</HI> as Pastor, preached and ad∣ministred the Ordinances. I sought to come acquainted with them, and going amongst them, was not only well re∣ceived as a hearer, but also as a Preacher, first and last for the space of three years, and upwards, before I joyned my se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f with them in Communion, which after∣wards, through my own inclination to perform the Ordinance of Christ, and their importunity, I did it. Now after I had thus joyne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my self in Communion with them, I continued, as I had former∣ly done, to illustrate and set forth the excellency of Christs Sufferings, and the Nobility and Majesty of his Person, al∣ledging and proving, <HI>That he who suffered and dyed on the Cross, was Gods proper Son, who came from Heaven</HI>; having a zeal against the contrary Doctrine of W. P. who affirmed, <HI>That the outward Person was not Gods proper Son.</HI> And that also, as I insisted upon this Doctrine, I did testifie &amp; declare, <HI>That the outward Person was not any weak and impotent Creature,</HI> as
<PB REF="000908_0018_0FACA071E2CE5AC8"/>
W. P. affirmed he was, but a mighty Saviour, a potent Redeemer, and that also the Scripture did declare of him, That he was a God, and yet not the Father, according to these places, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.6. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.1. <HI>John</HI> 20.28. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.8. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.3. <HI>cap.</HI> 3.16. <HI>cap.</HI> 4 10. <HI>cap.</HI> 1.1. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.3. 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.16. <HI>cap.</HI> 5.20. I thus in sincerity of heart endeavouring to demonstrate the danger of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Doctrine, which I had a great experience of by a careful and diligent search in their most principal Authors, that by understanding their Errors, I might be able to shew the Truth, according to Scripture (as God had been graciously pleased to make it known unto me) even to those People who under a pretence or cloak did pre∣tend to be at great odds with the <HI>Quakers</HI> about these Points, accounting them very erroneous for holding such things; but altho' they did so pretend, yet I per∣ceived soon after, that they were on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Quakers about the outward
<PB REF="000908_0019_0FACA072A43345E0"/>
Person and his Sufferings, and therefore I laboured the more with them to prove by Scripture, <HI>That the outward Person was Gods proper Son,</HI> bringing these for Rea∣sons, 1<HI>st.</HI> Because he came down from Heaven, and, 2<HI>d.</HI> Because he humbled himself unto his Father, by way of sub∣jection as a Son. And this I did, as a Brother, to inform them, that they might not fall into that Error themselves which they looked upon in the Quakers to be a <HI>dangerous Heresie.</HI></P>
<P>Now long before this, and before I joyn'd my self with them in Communion <HI>J. W.</HI> had writ something in opposition to this Doctrine, affirming, <HI>That the outward Person Jesus, that suffered upon the Cross, was a weak, impotent &amp; finite Creature,</HI> exactly imitating W. P. as before.</P>
<P>This, I and my Friend <HI>T. Rutter</HI> ha∣ving a sight of, we accounted it Blas∣phemous, and reproachful to Christ Jesus. But however, we laboured to inform J. W. in meekness, of his danger∣ous Error, as well as Blasphemy, while
<PB REF="000908_0020_0FACA073630AA460"/>
at last he complyes with us, and acknow∣ledgeth his fault: This we hoped was real in him. Upon which supposition that he saw his Error, and had really recanted it, by his importunity I joyned my self in Church fellowship with him, and the rest belonging to that Meeting. But to return, I still continuing to preach and assert among them, <HI>That he that dyed and suffered upon the Cross for the sins of the World, was no impotent, weak nor finite Creature, but one that was a mighty God</HI> (as the Prophet stiled him when he was a Child, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.7.) and yet not God the Father.</P>
<P>And now, to requite me for all my love and labour amongst them, <HI>J. Wats</HI> he sets his wits on work (because he perceived this Doctrine reflected much upon his Ignorance, and because also he could not endure to be out-done by ano∣ther, he being the Pastor) to lay a foun∣dation for Opposition (that he might have occasion to rid me out of the Church) he confidently calls back again
<PB REF="000908_0021_0FACA074C551C548"/>

But this Tyrannical man would yeild to no Christian Moderation nor Reason, being like to those that would neither enter the Kingdom of Heaven themselves, nor suffer those that would; and like to the Tyrant <HI>Procrust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> that would fit every one to his own Bed, by either stretching them out, or chopping them off.

And then they post up and send out their Papers throughout the Country of <HI>Pennsilvania</HI> and some into <HI>Europe,</HI> making a hideous and doleful Noise, terrifying &amp; fearing the Ignorant where-ever they come, and all on purpose to hinder Worship done to the Man Christ Jesus, and to defame me his poor Servant, who pleads for it.

<P>After all this I sought for justice, by making a Christian Appeal to a yearly Meeting of <HI>Baptists,</HI> held in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> the 25th of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1698. but because <HI>Jo.

<P>After this, <HI>April</HI> 13. 1699. <HI>Jo. Wats</HI>

For be∣cause he would by no means yeild that I should have my liberty at such a general Meeting to answer for my self to the sup∣posed Crimes he had laid to my charge; but on the contrary, he would first bring his Evidences to prove what he had charged against me, to be true (altho' his evidences were not legal, being partial men, and parties on his side) &amp; to judge

Hence we did yeild to refer the decision of the management of such a Meeting, to the judgment of 4 or 6 impartial Men indifferently chosen out of the baptized People; but J.

<P N="1">1. THat God (the Son) hath a di∣vine Body &amp; Soul in the form &amp; likeness of a Man.</P>

<P N="3"><PB N="2" REF="000908_0045_0FACA0864A231F90"/>3.

<P><HI>THat God (the Son) &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This being laid down for a Heresie, I shall, by Gods assistance, endeavour to prove it to be a Truth.</P>
<P N="1">§. 1. To deny this point, is to deny the Resurrection of Christ. <HI>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept,</HI> 1 Cor. 15 20. <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in, and found not the Body of the Lord Jesus,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="000908_0048_0FACA0891D113920"/>
Luke 24.3. and v. 6. <HI>The Angel said, he is not here, but is risen· And he bodily ascended up to heaven in the sight of the</HI> Gallileans, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.9, 10, 11. Hence the Apostle tells, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.21. <HI>That our vile Body shall be made like unto his glorious Body.</HI> Now if Christs Body be risen from the dead, it is united again unto his Soul, and both are ascended into heaven. And forasmuch as he is the Mediator, his Body and Soul is as truly Divine as Humane; and further, that he retains the same form in which he rose and ascended, is evident from the Scriptures, which was in the form and likeness of himself, to wit, the Man Christ Jesus, the Mediator, God-man; therefore God hath a divine Body and Soul in the form and likeness of a Man.</P>
<P N="2">§. 2. <HI>Object.</HI> But my Adversaries do object, <HI>If a man should so preach and assert, without di∣stinction, the people would necessarily understand it of God the Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. I did never so preach and assert to my knowledge, in such a frame of words as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s is there laid down, without either more or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess. But if I had, yet the Objection hath no weight against it to prove the Father must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecessarily be understood; but doth rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscover the great ignorance of the Objector,
<PB N="6" REF="000908_0049_0FACA0892E5BF350"/>
(wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch was <HI>T. Clayton,</HI> Priest of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> advocating for <HI>J. Wats</HI> at the Meet∣ing at <HI>Philadelphia, May</HI> 23. 1699.) in the phrase and language of holy Writ; for ac∣cording to this we should necessarily under∣stand the Apostles, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> that God the Father shed his Blood for the Church, and that God the Father laid down his Life, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28. 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.16. because both places are spoken without distinction; but this would not only be absurd, but blasphemous.</P>
<P N="2">2. But what reason have my Adversaries to bring this as an Objection against me, con∣cerning the Father, for if they grant the former to be a truth, (which they cannot well do, seeing they have condemned it for a He∣resie) That God the Son hath a Body and Soul, and the Father hath not, then this make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Gods, according to them, and yet this they condemn for Heresie. And, 2<HI>dly,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Father and Son▪ (as they affirm) are one individed Essence, it will follow that they are but one individed Person, and consequently▪ either the Son must be the Father, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Father hath a Body and Soul, or else the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must deny the Son to have such, or else the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is no Father at all, according to this absur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Opinion.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="000908_0050_0FACA089E77F4078"/>3. They malitiously accuse me and my Friend <HI>T. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utter</HI> of holding, <HI>That God sits in Heaven in the shape of a little old Man</HI> (as they phrase it.)</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This charge is most abominably false and wicked, and it is grounded from this, because we have brought that place of <HI>Daniel,</HI> cap. 7.9. to prove there the <HI>Antient of Days</HI> is intended the Father, and not the Son, because the Son afterwards is mentioned by the Title of <HI>The Son of Man,</HI> vers. 13. And because the Prophet thus sets forth and describes the <HI>Antient of Days sitting upon a Throne, with the Hair of his Head like pure Wool, and his Garments as white as Snow,</HI> they have cast it upon us as though we had been the first authors or promulgators of it, and so for it we are rendered Hereticks. But me thinks they are very partial, they should have placed the Saddle upon the right Horse (as the Proverb is) to wit, upon the Prophet himself, seeing he is the Author of that they call Heresie, to wit, <HI>That God the Father sits in heaven in a most glorious Throne,</HI> pointing out his Eternity under the similitude of <HI>white hairs,</HI> and his Holiness, Justice and Righteous∣ness under the figure of <HI>white Garments.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="000908_0051_0FACA08AA83A5318" MS="y"/>§. 3. But that which makes our Adversa∣ries to rave as they do, not only at us, but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> effect at the Prophet himself, is because thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Principle of Gods sitting on a glorious thron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in heaven, having there his chief Residence contradicts a great, but prodigious Principl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their own, <HI>viz. That God is every wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present alike.</HI></P>
<P>I shall endeavour to refute this monstrou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Principle by Scripture; 2<HI>dly,</HI> shew the absur∣dities that do arise from it.</P>
<P>The Scriptures affirm, <HI>God is in Heaven, and we are on Earth,</HI> Eccles. 5.2. Therefore saith the wise man, <HI>Let your words be few.</HI> This phrase denotes, that Gods chief abode and residence, with respect to his glorious Personal Being, is no where else but in Heaven. Therefore <HI>Solomon in his Prayer,</HI> he prays, <HI>That the Lord would hear in heaven, his dwelling place,</HI> 1 Kings 18 20. And again, the Pro∣phet cryes out, <HI>Heaven is thy Throne,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Isa.</HI> 66.1. Our Saviour saith, <HI>pray, Our Father which art in Heaven,</HI> Mat. 6.9. Hence it ap∣pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that Gods glorious &amp; personal Presence, is only in Heaven, and not every where alike. It is said, <HI>The Lord was not in the Wind, nor in the Earth-quake, nor in the Fire,</HI> 1 Kings 19.
<PB N="9" REF="000908_0052_0FACA08B62BE2E28" MS="y"/>
11, 12. Then not every where alike.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> The Absurdities that do arise from it.</P>
<P>If it were so that God is every where alike, and yet his dwelling place in Heaven, then Heaven must be every where alike also, and Christ must sit at Gods right hand every where, and consequently the holy Angels must be every where, yea, and we were all in Heaven, and there would be no difference be∣twixt Heaven, Earth and Hell; nay, further, this would destroy the very being of God, ac∣cording to the saying of the <HI>Rodian</HI> Poet,
<Q><LG>
<L>Quisquis ubique habitat maxime nusquam habitat, <HI>viz.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He that every where can be,</L>
<L>In no place never found is he.</L>
</LG></Q>
For if God be every where alike, then either every thing is God, &amp; then every thing must be worshipped, or else nothing is God, and so nothing must be worshipped. If we grant the first, that promotes Idolatry in the highest degree of it: If the second, it intro∣duces Atheism in the utmost extream of it: What a mad piece of absurd and jumbled Divinity would this be! But that God is every where present by his <HI>sacred Attributes,</HI>

K.</HI> to oppose this false and absurd Notion, by alledging the contrary, <HI>Christ without,</HI> altho' that phrase is not to be found in the Scripture, yet it is Scriptural. So then it may be lawful for me, when the outward &amp; visible Person is denyed to be the proper Son of God (by W. P. ex∣presly, and J. W. effectively, as also G. K. in holding and believing the eternal Word, (which was the outward Person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be the Light within, 3<HI>d Narrative, p.</HI> 6.) to oppose this Heresie, which the Apostle calls <HI>damnable,</HI> by the same expressions in which he is denyed, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ifie the contrary, viz. <HI>That the outward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the proper Son of God.</HI></P>

But if any should desire to know what the signification of Person is, I shall give them the Definition thereof from <HI>Goldman</HI>; A Person (saith he) is an Individed substance of a Rational Nature. From hence we may conclude, every Substance that is Rational is a Person; and they are of three kinds, <HI>Divine, Angelical</HI> and <HI>Humane</HI>; and every Substance that is Irrational, is not a Person; such are <HI>Annimals, Vegetables, Minerals</HI> and <HI>Insensible Creatures.</HI> Hence it is that Christ i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Person, because he is an individed Substanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a rational Nature, as also, God the Father; therefore the Apostle saith, <HI>That the Son is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> express Image of his Person,</HI> Heb. 1.3.</P>
<P N="3">§. 3. Object. <HI>But although Christ did Per∣sonally appear in the form and likeness of a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="15" REF="000908_0058_0FACA08FE264EA98"/>
before his Incarnation, yet that doth not argue, that he was such an outward Person as he ap∣peared to be, or had such a form and likeness properly, because Angels have frequently appeared in such forms, and yet none do believe that they have such forms properly of their own, but that they borrow or assume Bodies in which they do ap∣pear after this manner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This being laid down for a Principle, it ought to be proved by express Testimony of Scripture, or else no man is bound to be∣lieve it, <HI>viz.</HI> That Angels do assume Bodies in which they appear, and that they do not appear in their own proper Bodies. But see∣ing there is no Scripture to prove this thing, or any thing like it, I shall presume to prove the contrary by Scripture, to wit, <HI>That An∣gels do appear in their own proper Bodies, and not in borrowed or assumed ones.</HI> It is said, <HI>Dan.</HI> 10.6. concerning the Angel that appeared to <HI>Daniel, That his Body also was like the Beryl, and his Face as the appearance of Lightning,</HI> &amp;c. Where note, it is said [<HI>His Body</HI>] meaning the Angel; 'tis not said a borrowed or assum∣ed Body. So then I conclude from hence, it was the Angels own proper Body; from whence also it appears that Angels do appear
<PB N="16" REF="000908_0059_0FACA090E7235538"/>
in their own proper forms, and consequently our Saviour himself, when he did so appear, who was and is the head of the Angels,</P>
<P>The Absurdities that do follow at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of this foolish Opinion, are many, whereof I will give some few. 1st. Then if they do borrow Bodies, it must be some ones Body, that belongs either to the quick or dead. If to the quick, the Person whose Body the Angel doth occupy, would be sensible of the said occupation, and then it would not only be a borrowing or assuming the Body, but the Soul also, and consequently the Person would give a relation of it, to some of his Friends or others, by which means we might have more certain knowledge of such a thing. But of such a thing we never heard. 2. If to the Dead, it must be a Body that hath been newly Dead, or one that hath laid some time in the Grave. As to the first, <HI>one newly Dead,</HI> this would be a Miracle seen and beheld of men, because the dead Bodies of men are never cast out of the sight of the living, until they are entoombed in the Grave, and then we should have more knowledge of it. But this is ridiculous, as well as absurd, and con∣trary to reason. As to the second, If one that hath been some time in the grave, Then
<PB N="17" REF="000908_0060_0FACA09161DAABF8"/>
this would be a Resurrection to that Body without its own proper Soul, which is ab∣surd, and against the Ana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogy of Scripture, 2d. Or else it must be a Body create<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for that purpose, &amp; then every time an Angel appears to men he must have a new creation, in order to his appearance. But enough of this. I hope the Reader by this time may see the folly of such an idle Opinion.</P>
<P>Thus having led the Reader through the <HI>Introduction,</HI> and answered to, and proved the first point of Doctrine, and also removed the Scruple <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>I hope) concerning the phrase <HI>outward and visible Person,</HI> having thus made way for what follows, I now shall proceed to prove the Three Propositions before laid down, both by Scripture, Reasons and Argu∣ments drawn from thence; the which I shall illustrate by the Authority of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hors.</P>

<P>Therefore that outward and visible Person, JESUS, must needs be Gods Son, and none but he.</P>

<P>Now the Father hath been the Creator of all things, visible and invisible; then also the Son.</P>

<P N="8">§. 8.

<P>Now I <HI>Answer</HI>; It is true, I cannot re∣member that ever I preached after that man∣ner,
<PB N="28" REF="000908_0071_0FACA09A8A233318"/>
to use the word <HI>Body,</HI> with relation to his descending from Heaven, but always kept to the Term <HI>Person.</HI></P>
<P>But if I had used it, yet what advantage would my Adversaries have thereby? for I may safely, truly and properly say, that that <HI>visible Body, viz.</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ, came down from Heaven, and not thereby intend at all that Christ brought a Body of flesh from Heaven (which indeed I never believed) for there is a great difference betwixt saying, <HI>That visible Body came down from Heaven,</HI> and <HI>That visible Body came down from Heaven in a Body of flesh.</HI> But if we should understand words and phrases at this rate, we should understand the Apostles, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> That Christ came down from Heaven a Man, because <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>Behold a Man which comes after me, for he was before me.</HI> And <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>The second Man is the Lord from Heaven.</HI> Now these Phrases must be understood in the present Tense, and not in the Preter-perfect; that is, Christ was a Man then, but not a Man before <HI>John,</HI> but a divine Person before <HI>John</HI> was a Man; and so of the rest. So then when Christ, who came down from Heaven, was made a Body of flesh, or a Man, one cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> properly say, That Body or Man came down
<PB N="29" REF="000908_0072_0FACA09B21C9E700"/>
from Heaven, because then there was, nor is now no difference betwixt the Eternal Person and the Body of Flesh; but the Body of flesh now is the Eternal Person, because the Eter∣nal Person was made flesh in the fullness of Time.</P>
<P>But what is the matter, Christs and our Adversaries are so envious &amp; spightful at the body of flesh? (which was Christ) <HI>Answer</HI>; they themselves do plainly tell th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Reasons; <HI>J. Wats</HI> and <HI>W. Pens</HI> Reasons are, because in that regard, He was an impotent, weak, and finite Creature; <HI>T. Clayton,</HI> Priest of the <HI>Church of England</HI>; and <HI>Isaac Penningtons</HI> are, Because (as <HI>T. Clayton</HI> affirmed before credible Evidence) That that Body of flesh would have Rotted, if it had laid longer in the Grave, <HI>Isaac Pennington</HI> saith, <HI>It was of a perishing nature G. Eage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld</HI> saith (in effect) <HI>That that Body of fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh which the</HI> Jews <HI>saw, was not the second Person in the Trinity.</HI> And <HI>T. Fitzwater</HI> a Quaker said (in Effect) <HI>It was not the worlds Saviour.</HI> And so their Reasons are one and the same in the ground; the brief sum of which is to deny the Lord that bought them, which <HI>Peter</HI> calls a damnable Heresie; and then sure such must needs be Hereticks.

<P>BUt against this Doctrine, That the Death of Christ did as truly relate to his divine as Humane Nature, there are divers Object∣ions brought.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. By <HI>W. P</HI> &amp; <HI>J. W. That Suffer∣ings are acts of Impotency and Weakness, there∣fore none but impotent, weak and finite Creatures can suffer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This Objection is not only false in it self, but also highly blasphemous and inju∣rious to Christ Jesus, rendring him an impo∣tent, weak and fini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Creature, who is an Omnipotent and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfinite Creator▪</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> I will prove the Objection is false in it self, and grounded upon a gross Mistake; and prove the contrary by Scripture.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="000908_0105_0FACA0BF22326CD0"/>Though some sufferings are acts of Impo∣tency and Weakness, yet all Sufferings are not such; for (not to go so far back as to the Apostolical Ages, and sufferings of the pri∣mitive Church) never no man of Reason and Judgment, accounted that the Martyrs in Qu. <HI>Marys</HI> days suffered through impotency and weakness, but on the contrary▪ that which carried them through their Sufferings, was Power and Strength. But much more was Christ Potent and strong in the very midst of his Sufferings, and also in his Death; <HI>for through Death he overcame and got the Victory,</HI> Heb. 2.14. Therefore the <HI>Psalmist</HI> Propheti∣cally tells, <HI>That God,</HI> to wit, the Father, <HI>laid help upon one that was</HI> and is <HI>Mighty,</HI> to wit, upon his Son, <HI>Psal.</HI> 89.19. and therefore the Prophet calls him, <HI>The Mighty God,</HI> Isa. 9.6. And <HI>David</HI> further declares of him, <HI>That he is the Lord strong and mighty in Battle,</HI> Psal. 24.10. And hence it is that when the Earth and the Inhabitants thereof were dissolved, he bore up the Pillars of it, <HI>even by his Death, Psal.</HI> 75.3. And hence the Apostle tells, <HI>That God the Father up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eld the Worlds by the Word of his Power,</HI> meaning his Son: wherefore Christ testifies, <HI>That all Power in Heaven and in Earth was given to him,</HI> Mat. 28.18.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="000908_0106_0FACA0BFE1293E18"/>Whence it is, that the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> pro∣phecying of his bitter sufferings, puts the Query, <HI>Who is this that cometh from</HI> Edom (which signifies <HI>Red) with dyed Garments from</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ozrah? <HI>This that is glorious in his Apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength?</HI> The Answer is turned by the Lord himself; <HI>I that speak in Righteousness, mighty to save,</HI> to wit, he that trod the Wine press alone, which was the only begotten Son of God, <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.1, 2, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<P>And because he hath basely abused and per∣verted those Scriptures, to patch and piece this his vile Argument together, I shall en∣deavour to undeceive his unwary Reader, and to rectifie that mistake, and shew the Truth of the said Scriptures.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>first, That Christ is true God,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.20 I need say nothing to that. But as to the next, <HI>That God is a Spirit,</HI> Joh. 4.24.

Now then the next thing to be enquired into, is, What a sort of Spirit this is, which is here spoken, of which the Disciples did suppose our Saviour to be?

Therefore the Kingly Prophet. <HI>David</HI> fore-seeing this by the Spirit of Pro∣phecy,

<DIV3 TYPE="reasons">
<HEAD>Reasons added.</HEAD>
<P>Having thus done answering the Objections that are commonly brought against this Do∣ctrine of Christ dying as he was God, as truly as Man, I shall add <HI>five Reasons</HI> which do fur∣ther confirm the same.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 1. If he did not dye as truly God as he was Man, then he that dyed could not be Gods proper Son, because in that consider∣ation he could not have the Nature of his Father.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 2. Neither could he be a Mediator, if (as <HI>J. Watts</HI> saith) <HI>the Manhood only suffered,</HI> because he is not a Mediator simply as he is Man, but as he is both God and Man</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 3. Neither in that Consideration could he be a Person, because he took not a Person of <HI>Mary,</HI> but brought his Person from
<PB N="91" REF="000908_0134_0FACA0DDE02D55D0"/>
Heaven, as <HI>J. W.</HI> doth grant, but he did not bring his Manhood from Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 4. If that that suffered was only the humane Nature, and that humane Nature was a Person, and yet another Person came from Heaven, this would make two Christs.</P>
<P><HI>Reason</HI> 5 And again, if he that suffered was only Humane, and not a Person, then i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must be an irrational Creature, which to con∣clude would be real Blasphemy.</P>
<P>Now all these Difficulties are easily re∣moved, and those Absurdities avoide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we believe, confess and acknowledge, <HI>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Person, who was both God and Man, suffered and dyed conjunctively in both Natures.</HI></P>
<P>But before I proceed to the next Chapter, I must add here a Supplement to the eighth Objection, which was omitted there.</P>
<P>Whereas I have shewn that whenever th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Scriptures mentioned in the <HI>Eighth Objection,</HI> are understood with relation to Worship, every Person in the Trinity is included under that singular expression, according to that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.7. <HI>These Three are One,</HI> But when or wherever, we find added unto the same, such Official Epethites, Notes and Signes, which do plainly and familiarly <HI>show</HI> to which Per∣son
<PB N="92" REF="000908_0135_0FACA0DEA186F260"/>
it doth belong, and that such Offici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Titles, Epethites and Attributes cannot po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sibly be appropriated (without violen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> done to Gods Word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to any Person in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Trinity, save one, then under that singula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expression, must be understood one singula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Person.</P>
<P><HI>As for Example,</HI> Isa. 44.6. <HI>The King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Israel, The Redeemer,</HI> is said to be God, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>besides him there is none.</HI> Isa. 43.3 <HI>The hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> One of</HI> Israel <HI>Isa.</HI> 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 3▪ 11. <HI>The Saviour.</HI> Exod▪ 24.12. <HI>The God of</HI> Israel.

<P>All which places belong to the Son of God absolutely &amp; properly, &amp; cannot be appro∣priated to the Father, without Violence done to Gods Word, as will appear from these following Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st, The King of Israel,</HI> is Jesus Christ the Son, because he being the Son of <HI>David,</HI> was right Heir to the Crown of <HI>Judah,</HI> even of that temporal Kingdom, whence he is so stiled, as well as that he remains to be King of spiritual <HI>Israel</HI>; and he is reigning on the Anti-typical Throne of his Father <HI>David,</HI> and he shall reign over the House of <HI>Jacob</HI> for∣ever, and of his Kingdom there shall be no

<P>z.

<PB N="102" REF="000908_0145_0FACA198A751E330"/>
And pag. 111. he denyes that the Saints after the Resurrection shall have a <HI>Belly or Outs</HI> (as he coursely words it.) And this Doctrine of G. K<HI>'s</HI> doth exactly agree, for length and breadth, with <HI>W. P.</HI> about the Re∣surrection, <HI>Reas. against Railing,</HI> pag. 153. where he doth ingenuously confess, in the Name of the <HI>Quakers, That they do deny the Resurrection of the natural and corruptible Body,</HI> as G. K. doth. Now G. K. in his 3<HI>d Narrat.</HI> calls this a Fundamental Doctrine of the Chri∣stian Faith, <HI>viz.</HI> the Resurrection of the Body that dyes; and because the <HI>Quakers</HI> do not own it, he judges them Hereticks, and yet he doth d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny it himself; which is very unreason∣able dealing; and upon this very occasion the Apostle doth affirm, <HI>That such a man is inex∣cuseable,</HI> Rom. 2.1. nay, he goes further, and tells, <HI>In that the judgeth another, he condemns himself</HI>; for if it be not mortal, then it doth not dye. But so he saith, <HI>The mortal flesh is not that flesh that shall be raised up Immortal.</HI> Hence G. K. denys the Resurrection of the Body that dyes, which he himself sets down for one of the four Fundamental Christian Doctrines, 3<HI>d Narrative.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> He doth deny that there is any know∣ledge of God, in these words, p. 110. of the

said Book, <HI>God can neither be seen nor known with the Eyes of Mens minds or of their Bodies,</HI> contrary to these Scriptures; <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.8. <HI>John</HI> 17.3.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> He doth not believe the outward Person to be the proper Son of God.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> Because he holds for Doctrine (3<HI>d▪ narrative, p.</HI> 6.) <HI>The Eternal Word,</HI> (which is Christ the proper Son of God) <HI>to be the Light within.</HI> For there he tel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his Note, <HI>tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mething else (meant by him) without which the Light within cannot save is the Man∣hood of Christ.

Now forasmuch as the Eternal Word is Gods proper Son, and none else, which <HI>G. K.</HI> dares not deny, and that he deems is the Light within.

For if so, there would be two Persons which were Christs, <HI>viz.</HI> two Christs; For the Divine Nature did not assume a Humane Person, but a Divine Person which was the 2d. Person in the Tri∣nity, the eternal Son of God, did assume a Humane nature, <HI>viz.</HI> The true Nature of a Humane Body and Soul, although not a Body and a Soul. Now then, the second Person in the Trinity is Gods proper Son, to wit, Christ the Eternal Word, and none but he. But such was the outward Person Jesus, <HI>Ergo.</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="000908_0148_0FACA19B8C1189E0"/>
Now unless <HI>G. K.</HI> believes this; his belief is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one with <HI>G. W.</HI> and <HI>W. P.</HI> in the point.

<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Because he denys that there were <HI>two distinct Angets in the Creation of the Worlds,</HI> as it plainly appears by his denying <HI>G.

this place to prove from the Septuagint there were not two Agents, when as it proves the contrary, according to <HI>G.

K without any d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sparagement to his Learning. But why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he be angry with either <HI>Quaker</HI> or <HI>So∣cini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>?</HI> for if he will not allow the <HI>Quaker</HI> &amp; <HI>Socinian</HI> consequence to be true, then he jumps in his Judgment with them; for that it is
<PB N="107" REF="000908_0150_0FACA19C63380590"/>
which they are for, as well as <HI>Sebellius</HI> and <HI>Muggleton, That there was but one single Agent that had any hand in the Creation.</HI> And hence it is that neither <HI>Sabellius, Socinus</HI> nor <HI>Quaker</HI> will allow that that outward Person was Gods proper Son, because they do not believe he had any such; and this G.K. doth not believe neither; seeing he doth deny there were two distinct Agents. For he that doth deny that there were two distinct Agents in the Creation of the World, doth thereby deny a Trinity of Persons; for if there were not two distinct Agents, then there could not be two distinct Persons, and consequently not three, because every distinct Person in the Trinity is a di∣stinct Agent. And so it follows, that G. K. holds only a distinction in Name and Manife∣station; and this himself saith, in the same page, is the <HI>Sabellian Heresie.</HI> And again, if there were not two distinct Agents, then not two distinct Persons, as before, and conse∣quently no eternal and natural Son of God, as <HI>Socinus</HI> and <HI>Sabellius</HI> will have it. And then it will follow, that the Word was never Incar∣nate, giving the lye to the Apostle <HI>John, cap.</HI> 1.14. And again, it will follow, that the outward Person was not Gods proper Son, as VV.

<P>But to return again, now as <HI>G. Keith</HI> tell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> G. W. the contrary doth appear from the <HI>Septuagent,</HI> so here I tell G. K.

<HEAD><HI>§. 4.</HI> Here follows divers gross Absurdities that do naturally spring from the aforesaid Do∣ctrines.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. If Paradise were the eternal Word, as G. K. will have it, then <HI>Adam</HI> was to dress
<PB N="113" REF="000908_0156_0FACA1A0E3A26BD8"/>
and keep the eternal Word; which is absurd.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> G. K. is very uncertain about Para∣dise, what it is, sometimes he thinks it is Christ, at another time the third Heaven; and then again, the new Earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the Beasts of the field were the fallen Angels, then <HI>Adam</HI> was to give Names to the fallen Angels, and also they were formed out of the ground, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.19.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the Trees of the Garden were <HI>divine Perfections</HI> and <HI>Vertues,</HI> then divine Perfections and Vertues spring out of the Ground, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.9.</P>
<P N="4">4. Again, if the Tree of knowledge was Gods severe Justice and Wrath in Christ (as G. K. will have it) and the Tree of Life in Christ also, and Christ the Garden, according to which, <HI>the Garden, the Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil,</HI> are all one. And, 2<HI>dly,</HI> if there is the <HI>Tree of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the <HI>Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil,</HI> both in Christ, they must both belong to Christ, and then there is in Christ good Food and evil; and then it follows, that <HI>G.

<PB N="114" REF="000908_0157_0FACA1A1A143ABB8"/>
All which is very absurd, as well as reproachful to Christ.</P>
<P N="5">5. If the Soul of Man receives not its being by humane Generation (as G. K saith) then by the same parity of Reason one might say, the Body doth not neither. But if G. K de∣nyes this consequence, and will have it that the Body doth, but the Soul doth not. Then I may argue, according to G. K. that Bodies are capable of generating and propogating without Souls. But G. K. being a Philoso∣pher, might have remembered better this Rule in Natural Philosophy, <HI>viz. Every like begets its like.</HI> Now according to the Rule, if a Body only be begotten, then it was only a Body that did beget it, in which Gignation the Soul was not active or concerned, and then dead Bodies may multiply and increase Bodies as well as live ones. These are foul and gross Absurdities.</P>

Again, if by the Precept enjoyned to Man and Woman in Paradise, <HI>Be fruitful and multiply,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.28. be to be understood only with respect to the multiplication of Bodies, and not of Souls, then by the same parity of Reason, we must understand the same words which relate to the multiplication of Fish and Fowl, with respect only to their

Bodies, and not of Souls; and then it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the Spirits of Fish and Fowl, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Beasts too, have pre-existed also.</P>
