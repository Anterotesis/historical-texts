<HEAD>A Cloud of Witnesses; Darting out Light upon a <HI>CASE,</HI> too Unsea∣sonably made Seasonable to be Discoursed on.</HEAD>
<P>THE CASE before us, is not, Whether People of Quality may not Employ a <HI>Dancing-Master,</HI> with due Circum∣stances of Modesty to instruct their Children how to carry themselves handsomely, in Company? But, whether the <HI>Dancing Humour,</HI> as it now prevails, and especi∣ally in <HI>Balls,</HI> or in circumstances that Lead the Young People of both Sexes, unto great Liber∣ties with one another, be not a <HI>Vanity</HI> forbidden by the Rules of Christianity? And, If it be so, Whether Vertuous and Prudent Parents, will not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Second Thoughts be very cautious, how far <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Children to the Temptations of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Vanity?</HI> If a <HI>Nonconformist</HI> Minister should speak to this CASE, it may be thought Answer enough, That it is HE. Wherefore that the Reader may have no pretence to be Angry at any One such Minister, in the World, we will only bring some other Authorities.</P>

<P>The words of <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> and of <HI>Arnobius,</HI> and of <HI>Austin,</HI> and other Ancient Writers, are so full of Terrors and Thunders, against the <HI>Dances</HI> of

<P>Only we will make so free with <HI>Ambrose,</HI> (who was no <HI>Non-Conformist,</HI> but a <HI>Bishop,</HI> and a <HI>Cour∣tier</HI> too!) as to quote his Advice; <HI>That if Godly Parents would not have the Souls of their Children cor∣rupted and Ruined, they should be very cautious about sending them to the Dancing School.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Scipio Africanus,</HI> complained of it, as a Degeneracy in his Age, that Persons of Quality sent their Chil∣dren to the <HI>Dancing School.</HI></P>

<P>It is well known, That the old <HI>Councils,</HI> Ordained no less a Censure, Than that of <HI>Deposition</HI> for a <HI>Clergy-Man,</HI> and that of <HI>Excommunication</HI> for <HI>other People,</HI> to bear a part in a <HI>Dance.</HI> Particularly, One assembled in <HI>Trullo.</HI> Can. 51. Yea, very many Councils, make it a Crime in <HI>Clergy-Men</HI> to be so much as the <HI>Spectators</HI> of a <HI>Dance.</HI></P>
<P>We will descend unto late ones.</P>
<P>Many provincial Assemblies in <HI>Holland,</HI> have de∣clared, That the Scourge of <HI>Ecclesiastical Discipline</HI> should be employed upon <HI>Dancers.</HI></P>
<P>The National Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> A. 1578. thus Express themselves.</P>
<P><Q>Because Dances are for the most part attended with a levity, unbecoming Christians, and are an offence to the Godly; Especially when practis∣ed in a Time of Common Danger and Calamity: they that go to Dances shall be Reproved; and if after divers Admonitions they persist therein, they are to be excluded from communion.</Q></P>
<P>The Reforming Synod in <HI>Poland,</HI> prohibited the <HI>Dances</HI> too commonly practised; and pronoun∣ced them censurable.</P>
<P>The Discipline of the Reformed Churches in <HI>France,</HI> has this Article.</P>
<P><Q>Dancing is to be suppressed; and those that take the Liberty or Custome to Dance, after they have been several times admonished, shall be Ex∣communicated, when they shew themselves obsti∣nate in their Rebellion. And the consistories are Exhorted well to put this Article into Execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">[<HI>Read this, Ye</HI> Danc∣ing Refugees, <HI>and Reflect on Your strang<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conduct un∣der the dreadful Judgments of God.</HI>]</NOTE> and to Read the same Publickly in the Name

of God, and in the Authority of the Synods: And the said Synods and Colloquies are Exhorted to take heed of, and warn those Con∣sistories that therein do not their Duties, to Cen∣sure the offenders for it.</Q></P>
<P>And in this, 'tis well known, they did but imitate the old <HI>Waldenses.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Divines of the Church of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>Three famous Bishops, have Written against <HI>Mixt Dances,</HI> as unlawful. Their <HI>Names</HI> are, Dr. <HI>DOWN∣HAM,</HI> Dr. <HI>BABINGTON,</HI> Dr. <HI>ANDREWS.</HI> Their words are too long to be Repeated.</P>
<P>An Arch-Bishop, namely, Dr. <HI>USHER,</HI> has Written against these Vanities, particularly in his Catechism. Page 279.</P>
<P>Yea, divers have more lately had the Courage to do so. Amongst the rest, Mr. H. <HI>De Luzancy,</HI> the Vi∣car of <HI>Harwich.</HI> In his Treatise of the <HI>Two Sacraments,</HI> he showes, That <HI>Baptised</HI> Persons <HI>are to Renounce the Pomps and Vanities of this sinful World.</HI> And says he, <HI>p.</HI> 91, 92
<Q>Such are the Vain Conversations, Empty Visits, &amp; Publick Meetings of People of Different Sexes, where the Soul is betray'd by the Eye, and Sinful Creatures are proud of poysoning one ano∣ther. Such are those Methods of Dressing, which are grown a Study and a Trade; and Women are ashamed to appear with the Faces which God has given them, but choose rather to be seen with those of the Devils making. Washing, Painting, PATCH∣ING, are become serious Occupations, and have turn'd out of Doors Morning Devotions. Such are BALLS, and Playes.</Q></P>

and condemn'd even by the very <HI>Papists</HI>?</P>
<P>We know not what <HI>Broad-sides</HI> may quickly be gi∣ven us, from <HI>French Roman-Catholicks.</HI> But there shall Two be now (instead of many more) turned upon us.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Le Jeune,</HI> in his <HI>Le Missionarie de L' Oratoire,</HI> has a whole Sermon, <HI>Contre Les Bals, Les Danses, et autres divertisemens mondains, qui sent allumettes de Luxure.</HI></P>
<P>I will faithfully Translate a few passages out of it.
<Q>The Evil Spirit, has invented and introduced into the World, BALLS, and DANCES, and other Di∣vertisements, which the <HI>Reproved</HI> call <HI>Innocent,</HI> but St. <HI>Augustin</HI> called, <HI>Lugendas Latitius, The Sports which call for Sorrows.</HI></Q></P>
<P>He proceeds to show, how the Sacred Scriptures, which command <HI>Seriousness,</HI> and <HI>Gravity,</HI> and <HI>Mode∣sty,</HI> condemn <HI>Dances,</HI> and begs his Hearers to think on that word; Job. 21.11, 13. <HI>Their Children DANCE, and in a moment they go down to the Grave</HI>; (or as he renders it,) <HI>into Hell.</HI> Says he; <HI>There are some Sins thought Venial, that will End so.</HI></P>
<P>He mentions and commends <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> who ha∣ving heard, That some of his Hearers had been at a <HI>Ball,</HI> immediately he Preached a powerful Sermon a∣gainst it; and among other things that man of God said, (&amp; his words are quoted with Honour by this <HI>Papist</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">[The men of <HI>Rome,</HI> shall rise in Judgment with this Ge∣neration, and shall con∣demn it!]</NOTE>) <HI>If I could Learn, who they were, that were present at these Follies, I would chase them out of the Church; I would not permit them to be present at our dreadful Mysteries</HI>; And he goes on to call them, <HI>The Pomps of the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>The Papist goes on to tell us, That <HI>Chrysostom</HI> observes, <HI>We read not of any Dances at the Weddings of the Holy Patriarchs, and that the Weddings <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Blessings of God the more following of them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000921_0007_0FACA3136EC56B50"/>This <HI>Papist</HI> proceeds;
<Q>When you were <HI>Baptised,</HI> you Renounced these <HI>Follies</HI>; you were Engaged by an Express promise, to shun these <HI>Pomps of the Devil.</HI> If you Return to them, you are guilty of <HI>Persidy,</HI> &amp; <HI>Forgery,</HI> and <HI>Disloyalty.</HI> But how then can one grant you the <HI>Communion</HI> which is much more than <HI>Bap∣tism</HI>?</Q></P>
<P>Sayes he;
<Q>Here you throw away the precious <HI>Time,</HI> which cannot be recovered; the <HI>Time</HI> which is allowed you to work out your Salvation. You Extinguish in your selves the Spirit of <HI>Piety,</HI> of <HI>Charity,</HI> and of <HI>Repentance</HI>; the Spirit of <HI>Devotion.</HI> That Spirit is a precious Balm; or an Essence and a Cordial; nothing so easily grows Dead and Flat: there needs but <HI>One Dissolute Hour,</HI> to ruine in you, all that Spirit of Piety, which you have been gather∣ing for many weeks, by your Meditations, and Supplications. They have no Speech of GOD, at a <HI>Ball,</HI> or at a <HI>Play</HI>; and if at <HI>Collations,</HI> they Speak of GOD, and of Divine Things, of Devotions or of Devout Persons, it is ordinarily to rally up∣on them, and tell merry Stories thereof.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Here are profuse Expences of what should be Employ'd for the Comfort of the Poor, and their Succour in their Miseries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If the Young Gentlewomen would be well provided for in a Marriage, they should prefer a man of Sense and Judgment. Now there is no man of Judgment, who would not choose rather a Young Gentlewoman, that should be Wise, Modest, Reserv'd, and Retired, than a <HI>Dancer,</HI> a giddy, and an idle Damsel.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whence comes it that the <HI>Casaist</HI> informs me not, that the <HI>Ball</HI> and the <HI>Play,</HI> are any other than Indifferent Things? But think you to be Excused from the Judgments of God, because your Faith has been pinn'd on the Sleeve of, an <HI>Alamods Ca∣suist,</HI> who has a mind to render himself com∣plaisant unto your Inclinations, rather than <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="000921_0008_0FACA3142277E210"/>
to St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> and St. <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> and St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and other Fathers of the Church, who <HI>Flatter</HI> you not, because they <HI>Need</HI> you not.</Q></P>
<P>But, because this was a <HI>Church-man,</HI> we will hear no more from him. Let us at last hear a <HI>Courtier.</HI></P>
<P>M. <HI>Rabutin,</HI> in his Instructions to his Children. [In his <HI>Memoirs,</HI> Tom. 2 p. 155.] has these pas∣sages.
<Q>I have ever believed <HI>Balls</HI> to be dange∣rous. Of this, not only my <HI>Reason,</HI> but my own <HI>Experience</HI> made me sensible; and tho' the Authori∣ty of the <HI>Fathers</HI> of <HI>the Church</HI> in this Case, be ve∣ry considerable, yet that of a <HI>Courtier</HI> may be of greater weight. The coldest Constitutions are in∣flamed there. They that are Old, cannot go to them, without making a ridiculous Figure, nor the Young, tho' within the Rules of Decency, without Exposing themselves to great Dangers. It is my Opinion, then, That A CHRISTIAN OUGHT NOT TO BE AT A BALL; And I think it the Duty of the <HI>Guides</HI> of <HI>Consciences,</HI> to <HI>Interdict it fox ever unto those who are under their Di∣rection.</HI></Q>
A <HI>Question</HI> upon the whole.</P>
<P>Whether a <HI>Non-conformist Minister</HI> can be justly Reproached, for his faithful and watchful Endea∣vours, to reclaim his Neighbours, from hazarding their own and their Childrens Vertue, by <HI>Vanities,</HI> which have had no <HI>Good Report</HI> by the Vertuous in all Ages, but been decried, not only by <HI>Fathers,</HI> by <HI>Councils,</HI> by Divines of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but also by <HI>Papists,</HI> both <HI>Preachers</HI> and <HI>Courtiers,</HI> and by the very <HI>Pagans?</HI></P>
<P>Think seriously upon it; and upon Amos 6.3, 5, 6. <HI>Wo to them that put far away the Evil Day and chaunt to the sound of the Viol,—but they are not grieved for the Affliction of Joseph.</HI> And upon Isa. 22.12, 13, 14. <HI>In that Day did the Lord God of Hosts call to weeping and to mourning; And behold Joy and Gladness; Surely, This <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Look</HI> it, Reader; for I Tremble to <HI>Write it</HI>!</P>
