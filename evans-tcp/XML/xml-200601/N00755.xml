<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO get assurance of the Love of God and Eternal Life, should be thy Great Work and Busi∣ness in this World, else how canst thou dye with Comfort, while thou art doubting, whether thy departing Soul shall be damned or saved? Live with God or Devils eternally? If when thou must bid farewell to all things in this World for ever, and enter into an unchan∣geable,
<PB REF="000909_0003_0FACA0E8323CDAE8"/>
everlasting state of joy or tor∣ments in another World, thou knowest not which must be thy Portion: What the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can all thy Friends do for thee? What Comfort can thy Riches, Honours, bring into thy Heart at such a time as this when thou hast not secured thy Eter∣nal Happiness.</P>
<P>For this end God hath given to fallen Man his Word, whereby he might under∣stand his <HI>Misery,</HI> and how he came into it; the <HI>Remedy,</HI> and how he might get out of it; by making known the conditi∣ons and terms, upon which he is freely willing to receive Sinners into his love and favour, and confer upon them Gospel Priviledges here, and Eternal Glorious Life hereafter, and hath set to his Seal, for a firm conveyance of these great Eter∣nal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lessings, upon such reasonable, free, and holy terms, as are propounded in the Gospel.</P>
<P>But after such Love and Grace of God to man appeared, for his <HI>Happi∣ness</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> how great an Ene∣my is Man unto his real happiness, and well grounded comfort! One to his Hap∣piness,
<PB REF="000909_0004_0FACA0E86E0B6638"/>
when he will not come up to the terms of this Salvation: Another to his comfort, when he hath consented to, and accepted of the Conditions thereof, neglects the ratifying Seal of the Coven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of Grace: A third to both, while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> encreaseth his sin, and false deluding comforts, by a prepostero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> coming for the Seal, before he hath performed the conditio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of this Covenant.</P>
<P>And indeed the long absence of <HI>some Believers</HI> from, and the careless hasting of <HI>all ungodly</HI> to, the Supper of the Lord, is much to be lamented. The former being streightly charged by the Lord, <HI>to do this in Remembrance of him,</HI> yet will not▪ The Latter threatned with Damnation if they do, yet will. The former whom God hath habitually prepared for it, and it for them, and yet will not come, are in danger of be∣ing cut off, because they do not, <HI>Numb. 9.13.</HI> The Latter being neither prepared for it, nor it for them, (while such) are in danger of being cut down by death, be∣cause they do, <HI>1 Cor. 11 30.</HI> The one neglect his means of their Spiritual growth; and slight the love, and forget the words of
<PB REF="000909_0005_0FACA0E9285CF648"/>
their dying Lord, as though they could thrive in Grace, while they do neglect their Spiritual Food: The other neglecting the means of their Spiritual Birth, forget the words of the Apostle, <HI>Let a man ex∣amine himself, and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup:</HI> As though Food c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nverted into Poyson, could make a dead man alive. The one dare not omit to pray, and lead a Holy Life, and yet will not come to wash their Hearts; the other will not pray, nor lead a holy life, and yet will come to imbrue their hands in the blood of Christ. Such is the unthankfulness of some, that should, but do not; and the wickedness of some that do, but should not come unto this Gospel Feast.</P>
<P>Now, to prevent these two great evils, for the time to come, (as it might prove at least, I hope to some that might peruse this little Treatise) in which something is said to provoke the one to their duty, and deter the other from their sin and danger.</P>
<P>And because the best are too slight in their preparation for, and the weak un∣skilful

in, and all in some measure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> short of living suitably to the Sacrament; something is contained herein, to excite thy slothful heart to greater seriousness and diligence in preparation before thou con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st, and how it should be done; something for direction, how thou shouldest behave thy self when thou art there, and the manner how particular Graces are to be acted, for the better improving of this Ordinance, and something to direct thee what thou art to do when thou comest from thence; low thou mightest know, whether thou art the better or the worse, and what thou art to do, which of either be thy case. To which are annexed three Dialogues concerning the Lords Supper, for the help of those that are the weaker sort of Christians, that do desire to partake thereof. The first be∣tween a Minister and a private Christi∣an, that desires to partake of the Lords Supper. The second between a weak Be∣liever, that dares not come to, and a strong Believer, that dares not absent him∣self from the Lords Supper. The third between one Believer that hath Assurance, and another that hath hopes, and another that is under doubtings of the love of God, and of good by the Sacrament, as
<PB REF="000909_0007_0FACA0EAA6F46D68"/>
they come away from the Lords Table. In all which, if thou findest any thing pro∣fitable to thy Soul, and tending to promote the Work of Grace wrought in thy Heart, and thy fitness for, and to help thee in this duty, give God the Glory; but where thou findest any thing that savoureth of the weakness of the Author, do not censure, but pray for him, who is willing, according to his own Talent he hath received from the Lord, to further thee in thy way to Heaven and Eternal Life,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Containing the Explication of the Text, and the general Conclusion handled in this Treatise.</HEAD>
<P>THE Riches of the Goodness and Love of God were exceeding a∣bundant towards Man in his first Creation, when God brought him out of the state of nothing, and advanced him to the excellency of the hu∣mane
<PB N="2" REF="000909_0009_0FACA0EC2555BD40"/>
Nature, capable not only of ruling his fellow-Creatures in this World, but of know∣ing and conversing with his Lord Creator, who was graciously pleased to condescend to enter into Covenant with his <HI>then</HI> innocent Creature, that upon condition of his perfect obeying the Will of his Maker, (which he had then power to perform) he should con∣tinue in that state of Happiness. But great were the Riches of his Mercy to Man fallen from so great happiness to so great misery in making a Covenant of Grace, establishing it in the Blood of his Son, adding his Oath, an∣nexing his Seals for the confirmation of our Faith, that we should upon condition of be∣lieving, be Partakers of the great and glorious Priviledges purchased by Christ, promised in the Scripture, sealed in this Sacrament; con∣cerning which the Apostle spends the latter part of this Chapter, 1. In reproving the <HI>Co∣rinthians</HI> for their abuse and prophanation thereof: In that some that were contentious, and some that were vicious, even when they were drunken did approach thereto; who degrading themselves below the rank of men, could not then well act their Reason, when they should have acted Faith, and Love, and other Graces. It is an hainous sin, that those that are reeling in the street should be seen kneeling at the Sacrament. 2. In reducing them to the Primitive Institution, in which there is observable,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Author</HI> of this Ordinance, the Lord
<PB N="3" REF="000909_0010_0FACA0EE1DF0BBE0"/>
Jesus Christ, he alone hath power and Autho∣rity for the appointing of Ordinances in his Church, and for the Instituting of significant Sacramental Signs. He is the King and Pro∣phet of his Church, and hath not left it to his Officers at their will and pleasure to introduce any thing that is a part of holy Worship; for Christ was neither short in wisdom that he could not, nor in goodness that he would not appoint whatsoever was sufficient for the Edi∣fying of his Church, and the Comfort of his People: <HI>Moses</HI> was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle, that he should make all things according to the pat∣tern shewed to him in the Mount, <HI>Heb</HI> 8.5. <HI>Exod.</HI> 25.40. And <HI>Paul</HI> delivered nothing but what he had received of the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Time</HI> when this Ordinance was ap∣pointed by our <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> that same night in which he was betrayed, when he was so near unto his death, and knew all that was to be done to him, and suffered by him; whereby you might perceive the greatness of the Love of your dying Lord, that when he was so full of Sorrow, he made provision for your Com∣fort; and the excellency of this Sacrament, that had its Original from Christ, when he was so near his end, that should be for the main∣taining of his Peoples Spiritual Life, which was ordained by him now drawing near to death. Great and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighty things take up the thoughts of wise and serious dying Men; that sure is great and weighty which our dy∣ing
<PB N="4" REF="000909_0011_0FACA0EE6C343D08"/>
Lord ordained at such a time as this.</P>
<P N="3">3. The external <HI>Elements</HI> and <HI>Signs,</HI> Bread and Wine. In Sacraments there is something seen, and something understood; something perceived by Sense, and something apprehend∣ed by Faith. Sacraments are Glasses for our understanding, and Monuments for our Me∣mories, that by mean and visible signs, we might perceive and call to mind sublime and invisible things. Here is Bread, even bread of Life, to fill the hungry Soul, and Wine to satisfie the thirsty, and to chear the drooping Soul.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Sacramental <HI>Actions,</HI> 1. Of Christ, He took the Bread, and blessed it, and brake it: He took the Cup and blessed it; and did distribute both. 2. Of the Receivers, who are to take and eat, to take and drink; Christ is the Giver, Christ is the Gift: And what Christ in love doth give, Believers with joy and thankfulness should receive.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The Explication</HI> of this Mystery. <HI>This is my Body: This Cup is the New-Testament in my Blood</HI>: The Bread was not turned into Christs real Body; nor the Wine into his Blood: For, did the Disciples eat Christs real Body, when he was with them at the Table? or did they drink his real Blood, which then was in his Veins, and in his Body, and not in the Cup? Or did they not then see that Christs real Body and Blood was really distinct from the Bread and Wine? And did they not see it was real Bread, and taste it was real Bread,
<PB N="5" REF="000909_0012_0FACA0EF213DA4C0"/>
and handle it as real Bread? Or is now Christ's glorious Body subject to Corruption, as is the Bread that is in the Sacrament, and when it is received? Or can a finite Body be in Heaven and upon Earth, in so many places at once, as the Sacrament might be admini∣stred in at the same time? Or do Drunkards and Swearers, Hypocrites and Unbelievers, really eat and drink Christ's real Body and Blood? The meaning is, this is a sign of my Body, and a sign of my Blood, the Commu∣nion of both. As Circumcision is said to be the Covenant, so the Bread is Christs Body; <HI>Gen</HI> 17.10. <HI>This is my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee: Every man Child among you shall be Cir∣cumcised:</HI> But yet Circumcision was not the Covenant, but a Sign and Seal thereof, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4 11. <HI>And he</HI> (that is, <HI>Abraham) received the Sign of Circumcision, a Seal of the Righteous∣ness of the Faith which he had being yet uncircum∣cised</HI>—So the Cup in the Sacrament is said to be the New-Testament or Covenant, but it is not the very Covenant, but the Sign and Seal thereof.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Application of this unto its proper Subject</HI>; Christ declaring who they be that <HI>this</HI> and the things signified do belong unto, <HI>Which is broken for you,</HI> it is according to the mind of Christ, that Believers in the Lords Supper should make particular application of himself, and of the fruits of his Death and Suf∣ferings to themselves: a Believer may take
<PB N="6" REF="000909_0013_0FACA0EFE1C76660"/>
the Bread, and say, The Lord Jesus dyed for me; and the Wine, and say, Christ Jesus shed his Blood for me.</P>
<P N="7">7 A plain <HI>Injunction</HI> given to Believers to celebrate this Ordinance: <HI>Do this.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. The <HI>Frequency</HI> of attending upon God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his Table: <HI>As oft as ye do this.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>End</HI> for which we should approach unto the Table of the Lord: <HI>Do this in re∣membrance of me</HI>: Whenever we celebrate the Lords Supper, we commemorate the Lords Death.</P>
<P N="10">10. The <HI>Time, how long</HI> this Ordinance must be used in the Church, <HI>Till the Lord shall come.</HI> The Lord will come, and till then this Sacra∣ment must continue; but when he comes to take us to himself into his glorious Kingdom, we shall need this and other▪ Ordinances no more: When the end is attained, the means shall cease; but as the Sacraments of the Old Testament did continue till Christs first co∣ming in the flesh; so the Sacraments of the New-Testament shall continue till Christ's second coming in Glory.</P>
<P N="11">11. A serious <HI>Admonition</HI> of the Apostle, that those that come to this Ordinance, be care∣ful how they eat of <HI>this</HI> Bread, and drink of <HI>this</HI> Cup, <HI>ver.</HI> 27. <HI>Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</HI> Unworthy receiving is a great ag∣gravation of their sin and guilt, who shall presume in their heart so to do.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="7" REF="000909_0014_0FACA0F0A1361728"/>12. A suitable <HI>Direction</HI> to a right use of this Ordinance, to prevent that great wicked∣ness and crying sin of being guilty of Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Body and Blood, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. <HI>But let a man exa∣mine himself, and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. The dreadfulness of the <HI>Punishment</HI> that they be in danger of, that come unworthily; and this is either Temporal, <HI>ver</HI> 30. <HI>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep,</HI> that is, are dead; or Eternal, with∣out Repentance, <HI>ver.</HI> 29. <HI>For he that eateth &amp; drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damna∣tion to himself</HI>; which Word is used to signifie as well Eternal Damnation as Temporal Judgments; and <HI>if any Man be damned for un∣worthy receiving, it will be great Damnation.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. One <HI>Cause</HI> or <HI>Reason</HI> specified why some do eat and drink unworthily, <HI>ver.</HI> 29. <HI>Not dis∣cerning the Lords Body,</HI> not distinguishing be∣twixt this and common Bread. Thus you have the parts contained in the Verses in this Chap∣ter, that concern the Institution of the Lords Supper, and of the Apostles Doctrine, in or∣der to a right receiving of the same.</P>
<P>In this little Treatise▪ I shall not endeavour to take in the whole Doctrine of the Sacra∣ment, because many learned and holy men (whose Shoes I am not worthy to un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye) have written concerning the <HI>Nature, Ʋse,</HI> and <HI>Ends</HI> thereof, the <HI>Qualifications</HI> of the Persons that have an immediate right thereto, the Gra∣ces that are to be exercised therein, which are
<PB N="8" REF="000909_0015_0FACA0F1612C4F40"/>
to be drawn forth into act, by se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the <HI>Sa∣cramental Representations,</HI> by considering the <HI>Sacramental Actions</HI> of the Minister that stands in Christs stead, in taking, breaking and distri∣buting; of the Receivers in taking, eating, drinking; all which are signs of something spiritual, not discerned by unworthy Receiv∣ers; by believing and applying of <HI>Sacramen∣tal Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mises. [This is my Body which is broken for you.]</HI> But what I shall speak, shall be com∣prized in some following Conclusions, for the preventing of these following evils.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some that are truly gracious, do live long in the neglect of this heart-warming affe∣ction-inflaming, grace-strengthning Ordinance. Some that have no right to it, will not be ex∣cluded from it, but count that Minister their greatest Enemy that would willingly prevent their being guilty of the Blood of the Lord. Others whom God calls and hath prepared it for, will not be prevailed with to come unto it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some that though they do approach un∣to it, yet it is but very seldom.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some that do come, and that often, are too careless and remiss, that they do not endea∣vour to prepare themselves, as a work of that weight and consequence doth require; and herein some of Gods own people are blame worthy.</P>
<P N="4">4 Some while they be actually engaged in this du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, do not rightly consider the Blood of Christ therein, nor act their Graces there∣upon.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="9" REF="000909_0016_0FACA0F221ECFB78"/>5. Some that are partakers of the Lord: Supper, do not enquire after participation, what benefit they have received thereby.

</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Containing the first Conclusion, and Explica∣tion thereof.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a necessary Duty incumbent upon Adult Believers to partake of the Lords Supper.</HI> 1. <HI>Necessary,</HI> as it is opposed to <HI>Arbitrary:</HI> It is not left to the pleasure of the people of God, that if they will they may; if they will not, they may refuse; but as it is their priviledge that they <HI>may,</HI> so it is their duty, that they <HI>must</HI> receive it. We may, and we must pray; we may, and we must hear: so we may, and we must receive. Yet it is my Observation, that the same Christians that are much trou∣bled if they omit praying, and hearing, and reading the Word of God, and their Consci∣ence doth accuse them for the neglect of these, yet have for a long season absented themselves from the Table of the Lord, and seldom put the neglect thereof amongst their Confessions
<PB N="11" REF="000909_0018_0FACA0F3A0E48070"/>
of sin, as if it were not a sin of Omission and made them not guilty before the Lord,</P>
<P N="2">2. I say, it is a necessary Duty; not necessa∣ry to the <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Essence</HI> of a Christian, for that is supposed: for Conversion must go be∣fore participation of this Holy Ordinance, which is not appointed of God to beget, but to encrease Grace: and Grace must be in Truth, before it can receive its growth by an Ordinance. <HI>Dead M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> must not sit down at the Table of the <HI>Living God</HI>; Here Men come to Christ, and Faith is the <HI>foot</HI> of the Soul; here men must receive Christ, and Faith is the hand of the Soul; here men must fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up∣on Christ, and Faith is the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the Soul; it would be more seemly to set a dead Man at our Table, than that a Man dead in Sin should sit down at the Table of the Lord▪ It is Childrens Bread, and must not be given unto Dogs; But there is a degree of necessity of this Ordinance for the more <HI>comfortable being</HI> of a Christian: You must then bring some Grace with you, and come hither for more; you must bring some Faith, and Love, and Hope, and come hither to have more degrees of all these: Growth supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seth Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. I say, it is necessary, but not <HI>absolutely to salvation</HI>; because where there is Faith in Christ, Love to God, and real implacable hatred unto Sin, there is at least an <HI>Objective</HI> certainty of Salvation, and may be a <HI>Subjective</HI> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtainty without it, though not so usual, nor so full and constant, if it be <HI>wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fully</HI> neglected, where op∣portunity
<PB N="12" REF="000909_0019_0FACA0F4602F8080"/>
of receiving it is afforded; for the wilful neglect of this duty doth administer just ground of jealousie, whether our obedience be true, because not universal unto all Gods Commands, and therefore not universal, be∣cause it extends not unto this▪ <HI>Lo this in Re∣membrance of me.</HI> A Believer without this Sacrament may be sure of Heaven, especially where opportunity of participation is denyed: but a Believer that may receive it, and yet lives in the neglect of it, will not be so fully, well groundedly, comfortably sure that he is sure of Heaven.</P>
<P N="4">4. I say necessary, being so by Gods Com∣mand; what God enjoyns is not arbitrary to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, nor indifferent whether we will do it or no.</P>
<P N="5">5. I say, it is a duty of Believers, that are adult, and have the use of reason; so it is not incumbent upon Infants and distracted Per∣sons, because they are not capable of the con∣dition and antecedent duty unto this, <HI>viz Self-examination.</HI> A diligent strict examination. 1. Of our State, whether in Christ or no. 2. Of our Sins, both of heart and life. 3. Of our Wants 4 Of our Graces, of Repentance for sin, Faith in Christ, Love to God, Obedi∣ence, and a firm and holy purpose of walking with God, must precede the participation of this Ordinance, and therefore such persons as may have grace in the habit, and in no measure capable of Self-examination (as may be the case of some Infants &amp; distracted Persons) lie not under an obligation to celebrate this Ordi∣nance

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Shewing that Christs Disciples must receive the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THat it is the necessary duty of Believers to par∣take of the Lords Supper,</HI> I prove:</P>
<P>First, There is the same parity of Reason that Believers under the Gospel should receive the Lords Supper, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> under the Law should eat the Lords passeover: This was their duty, as is prescribed, <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. where is the First Institution, the manner how, the end for which. And the command for it is again renewed, <HI>Numb.</HI> 9 1, 2, 3. And if a man were unclean that he could not keep it the first Month, yet he must the second: yea, God was much provoked by the Neglect of the Pass∣over, <HI>Numb.</HI> 9.13. <HI>But the Man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Passover, even the same shall be cut off from his People, because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season: that man shall bear his sin.</HI> Here you see was Guilt con∣tracted, and punishment severe to be inflicted, upon the Person that should neglect to eat the Lords Passover.</P>
<P>And there is as great reason for Believers to
<PB N="14" REF="000909_0021_0FACA0F6232C70B8"/>
eat the Lords Supper, as appears by the agree∣ment betwixt them in these particulars:</P>
<P>First, in the <HI>Author</HI> and efficient Cause; God appointed both.</P>
<P>Secondly, In the <HI>Matter</HI> principally signified in both, and that is Christ, and the same bene∣fits and priviledges held forth, and conveyed to Believers in both, as remission of Sin, Justi∣fication, &amp; spiritual Nourishment and Growth in Grace.</P>
<P>Thirdly, In the <HI>End,</HI> to commemorate the mercy and goodness, of God in the deliverance of his People from Captivity of Sin, and Bon∣dage of the Devil.</P>
<P>Fourthly, In the <HI>Instrument</HI> of receiving &amp; applying the thing signified by both, and that is Faith▪</P>
<P>Fifthly, In the <HI>Parts</HI>; in both, something <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sign, and something signified.</P>
<P>Sixthly, In the <HI>Properties</HI> of the Paschal Lamb, which are in Christ our Passover.</P>
<P N="1">1. That was to be without blemish; so was Christ, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53 9. 1 <HI>Pet</HI> 1.19 &amp; 2.22 <HI>Heb</HI> 7.26.</P>
<P N="2">2. That must be a Male; so Christ for Sex and Strength a mighty Saviour, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.32</P>
<P N="3">3. That must be of a year old, in a perfect age; Christ about thirty four years, in the prime of his age.</P>
<P N="4">4 That must be taken out of the flock. Christ must be taken from among mankind, that was partaker of Flesh and Blood, <HI>Deut.</HI> 18.18 <HI>Heb</HI> 2.11.</P>
<P N="5">5. That must be separated from the flock;
<PB N="15" REF="000909_0022_0FACA0F6A206C120"/>
Christ was separated from Sinners, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.26.</P>
<P N="6">6 That rost with fire; Christ with the heat of Gods wrath.</P>
<P N="7">7 That must be eaten; Christ must be re∣ceived by Faith.</P>
<P>That must be eaten,</P>
<P N="1">1. By every Family; Christ to be received by every Person.</P>
<P N="2">2. With unleavened bread; Christ and this Sacrament is to be received in sincerity and truth, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5 7, 8.</P>
<P N="3">3 With bitter Herbs; Christ and this Or∣dinance, with bitter Repentings.</P>
<P N="4">4. Wholly, all of it must be eaten, whole Christ must be received in all his Offices, Pro∣phet, Priest, and King, Christ as the Paschal Lamb must be received with all his appurte∣nances</P>
<P N="5">5. In hast; Christ must be received pre∣sently, without delay.</P>
<P>Seventhly, In the <HI>Subject</HI> that must eat there∣of, they were <HI>Israelites,</HI> and those that were Circumcised. Those that should partake of this Ordinance ought to be <HI>Israelites</HI> indeed; and Circumcised in their hearts, if they would have benefit thereby. Thus you see the great agreement betwixt those two Ordinances: And were the <HI>Jews</HI> bound to observe that, and not Believers under the Gospel engaged unto this; Nay, I may argue, that there is a greater reason why we should be more for∣ward to this duty, in as much, wherein they differ, this is more excellent. As,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="16" REF="000909_0023_0FACA0F76191A890"/>1. In the manner of their signification, the Passeover signified Christ that was to come; the Lords Supper, Christ already come.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Duration. The passeover was to continue till the coming of Christ in the Flesh: The Lords Supper till he come again in Glo∣ry, in the end of the World.</P>
<P N="3">3 In the perspicuity and clearness: In the former, Christs death was signified more darkly, in the latter more plainly.</P>
<P>Now I beseech you, see what the Passeover was to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and consider that <HI>that</HI> the Lords Supper is to us, and there will appear the same parity of reason for our receiving of this, as for the <HI>Jews</HI> eating of that.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is the plain Injunction of our dying Lord, that we should do this in remem∣brance of him; Why do you pray? One rea∣son you will give is, because God Commands it: And if you pray because God commands you, you must then do every thing that God commands you, and so this: Is it not strictly commanded? Read <HI>Luk</HI> 22.19 The whole is commanded. <HI>This do in remembrance of me,</HI> Mat. 26.26, 27. The particular Acts are commanded, <HI>Take, Eat, Drink,</HI> &amp; will you say you will not? Will that become a Disci∣ple of Christ? You say not, you will not, but you know you do not, and that is as bad.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Christ did ordain it for this very end, that believers should have a remem∣brance of him in the partaking of this Ordi∣nance: We are apt to forget the Works of
<PB N="17" REF="000909_0024_0FACA0F8259AC908"/>
God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106.13. Too apt to forget the benefits we received from God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 103.2. But which is most to be wondred at, we are too prone to forget God our Saviour, to for∣get him that delivered us from the curse of the Law, by being made a Curse for us: From the wrath of God, by bearing it himself; from the sting of death, by dying for us, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106.21. <HI>They forgat God their Saviour:</HI> Oh, what memories have we! that can remember our Relations, our Worldly Affairs, and forget that God that made us, and Christ that did redeem us: Now Christ would live in our thoughts and memory, and to heal and help the slippe∣riness thereof, hath instituted this Ordinance, which you cannot partake of aright, but you must remember him</P>
<P>Or will you say you remember Christ without this? That you have no ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to use this Ordinance for that end? Why then, tell Christ so, if you dare; What is this but to correct the wisdom of your Lord by your own folly? but I tell you, you cannot so well remember Christ without this Ordinance as you may, by a careful frequent attendance upon God in it; for it is not a speculative, historical remembrance that he did bleed and dye: for so the Devils thems<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves remember Christs death: Not as a Scholar may remem∣ber his notions; but the remembrance that Christ would have in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>houghts, is,</P>
<P N="1">1 An <HI>Aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctionate Remembrance,</HI> that the sight of your eye shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d affect your heart:
<PB N="18" REF="000909_0025_0FACA0F8E33FA6B0"/>
That you should so remember him, as to love him, and desire him, and delight in him.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>Sorrowful Remembrance</HI>▪ that you should remember him so, that your heart should break, and your eyes should weep: when you remember your sin was the <HI>Judas</HI> that be∣trayed him, your sins were the Spears that pierced his blessed side, and let out the blood from his Holy Heart: That were the Thorn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Crowned him, and the Nails, that fastned him to the Cross. When <HI>David</HI> would sor∣row for his sins, he penneth a Psalm, which he intitles a Psalm to bring to remembrance, <HI>Psal.</HI> 38. And when you would have your heart to sorrow afresh for your Pride and Unbelief▪ and other sins, go to the Sacrament; which is a Sacrament to bring to remembrance; there remember the dignity and Innocency of the Sufferer, the greatness of his Sufferings. 1 From God. 2 From Men. 3. From Devils; the causes of his sufferings, your own wicked do∣ings, and this will help you to a sorrowful remembrance of your sins.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A joyful and thankful Remembrance</HI>; you must look upon your sin, and be troubled that you have done that which put Christ to death, and you must here look upon Christ, and rejoyce that by his death he hath taken a∣way the sins that you had done against God▪</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>A fiducial Remembrance</HI>; that you may so remember Christ, as to trust in him, and rely upon him, and cast the care of your Souls upon him.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="19" REF="000909_0026_0FACA0F9A149BE68"/>5 <HI>A silencing Remembrance</HI>; that you may so rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber Christ, as to silence all the Cla∣mours of an accusing devil, and an accusing C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nscience, and every one that would lay a∣ny thing unto your Charge: When you re∣member Christs death, it will furnish you with suitable supplies to all Charges laid unto you. The Devil will accuse you of sins before and since Conversion, and you cannot deny them; but you may remember Christs death, &amp; say, it is true, I did so, but Christ hath born mine iniquiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in his Body upon the Cross: what now, O mine Enemy! he will tell you of your si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion, of commission, and you can∣not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eny them; but you may reply, Christ hath undergone the punishment that was due to me for them; what now, Oh mine Enemy: the Law of God will accuse and curse you for the breaches thereof that you have made, and you cannot deny them; but here you may re∣member Christ, and say, that he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h perfect∣ly obeyed the Law, and satisfied for your bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king of the Law, and may be comforted: Your own Conscience will accuse you, but here you may remember Christ's Death, and Conscience is answered, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ightly quieted: Thus the remembrance of Christ's death will answer all charges, <HI>Rom</HI> 8.33, 34 And will you neglect it?</P>
<P N="6">6 A <HI>Sin-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>athing remembrance</HI>; you will not only mourn for sin, but loath it too; when you do this in remembrance of Christ, you will abhor the Knife that killed your Fa∣ther,
<PB N="20" REF="000909_0027_0FACA0FA60B7DEA8"/>
and the Sin that killed your Lord; when you remember him and it. Now you cannot have such a remembrance of Christ as this, so well without the Lords Supper, as with it: except you will unadvisedly and wickedly charge Christ with a superfluous Institution of a needless means that hath no tendency in it to beget such a remembrance of him in your thoughts; and whom will you delight to re∣member, if not your Lord? Who shall live in your thoughts, if not your Saviour and Re∣deemer? And how will you thus remember him, if you do neglect the means appointed by him for the attaining of this end?</P>
<P>Shall Christ himself bespeak you to do this in remembrance of him, saying▪ <HI>Do this in remembrance of me.</HI></P>
<P>First, That came down from Heaven to Earth, for your sake, that left the Bosom and the Glory of my Father, to be cloathed in the rags of Humanity for your sake, and will you not do it?</P>
<P>Secondly, Shall he say, Do this in remem∣brance of me, that led a life of suffering, from the Manger in which I lay, to the Cross on which I hung, and will you not do it?</P>

<P>Seventhly, Shall he say, Do this in remem∣brance of me, who will come again at the last day, &amp; openly absolve you before Angels, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and Devils; and will you yet slight it?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Containing twelve Questions to those Belie∣vers that neglect the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P>LET me proceed to shew you the aggrava∣tions of your long neglect of the Lords Supper: I pray you therefore tell me,</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>Is not this to live in the neglect of a plain commanded duty? You see it proved to be your duty, and is it nothing to you to live in a known sin? Nay, and to plead for it too? As you do for not coming to this Ordinance, it may be it is because you doubt of your sincerity, and might not this increase your doubts, when you are parti∣al in your Obedience to Gods Commands?</HI></P>
<P>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st 2. <HI>Is not this great Hypocrisie to com∣plain of the hardness of your Hearts, and yet will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> use the means to have it s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ned? To com∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n of the Power of your sins, and yet will not bring them to the Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of Christ to have them
<PB N="23" REF="000909_0030_0FACA0FCA63835D0"/>
mortified and subdued? Is not this great diss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mu∣lation, to run to Ministers with Complaints in your Mouth, and Tears in your Eyes, because of the prevalency of Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, and yet will not use the means for the further conquering of them? If it be not so, why then do you complain? If it be so why then will you not diligently and conscienti∣ousl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> use the means, that it might be better with you? Oh come, bring your hard Heart unto the Blood of Christ, and see if it will not soften it; bring your strong corruptions to this Blood, and see if it will not weaken them?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 3 <HI>Is not this to set light by a special Token of the love of your dying Lord? The nearer Christ was unto his death, the more lively were the discoveries of his love unto your S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul &amp; will you take no more notice of it? Methinks Christ when he was to die, speaketh thus unto his people, You are they whom I have loved; you are they for whom I will do and die; you are they whom I will always think upon, and in whose Thoughts I love to live; and because the hour of my death is come, and I must go away from you, therefore I will leave you a Memorial of my Death and Love, that as oft as you see it, you may remember me; when you behold it, then think of me: And was Christ mindful of your good and comfort in that very night in which he was betrayed; and will you thus neglect and distesteem it? If your most dear and special Friend upon his death bed had bequeathed you some token of his love, and said, When you behold this, then think on me when I am dead and gone,
<PB N="24" REF="000909_0031_0FACA0FD6759D270"/>
would you throw it by, and never view it? Do not the Expressions of your dying Friends make a deeper, and a more large impression upon your hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and thoughts? And shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not the words and intreaties, and commands of your dying Lord?</HI></P>
<P>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t 4. <HI>Is not this to disesteem a firm Con∣veyance and Assurance of all the Gospel B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essings and benefits purchased by the Death of Christ? Is not this Ordinance Gods bread Seal, to confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m unto your Soul the great and everlasting B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssings of the Covenant of Grace? Would you be con∣tented with the Writings for your Lands and H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uses, without a Seal? or wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d you not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire a Sealing day, and be glad when it comes, that you may be the surer, and your Title made more clear? And are not the pardon of your sins, and your Title to the Kingdom of God greater things? And the assurance of these more, infinitely more desirable? Or do you doubt you have them not, &amp; yet will not come to have your Evidences to be cleared? This Sacrament it is</HI> Signum reme∣morativum, <HI>to bring to your remembrance the Passion of your Lord, where he would testifie to your Conscience, and assure you that he died for you</HI>: It <HI>is</HI> Signum demonstrativum, <HI>a Demon∣stration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his Love, where he would assure you that he loves you: It is</HI> Signum prognosticum, <HI>or</HI> prenuntiativum, <HI>a Prognostick of your future and eternal Happiness, where he would assure you that you shall undoubted<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be Partaker of it, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll you yet neglect it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 5 Is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this too great a sign of the littleness of your Love unto him? Did you
<PB N="25" REF="000909_0032_0FACA0FE2231D478"/>
love him, would you not desire to be there where he is wont to take his walk? Did you love him, would you not desire to eat and drink at his Table, yea, to feast upon him? And to be there where you may find him, and where he manifests himself unto them that love him? Did you hunger after him, and thirst for him, would you not desire to be there, where you may be filled and satisfied?</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 6 Is not this too great a sign of your slighting Communion with him? That you do not set so high a price and valuation of fellowship with him? Or do you complain that you have it not, and yet will not come where you may have it?</P>
<P><HI>Quest</HI> 7. Is not this too great a sign that you set little by the comforts of the Spirit, and the warming joys of the Holy Ghost? Is it not here that God hath shed abroad his love into the hearts of true believers, and sent them away with their hearts full of joy, and their mouths of praises? Or do you complain you have no comfort, and that you are a stranger to spiritual joy, and will not come where you may not only have a taste, but drink full draughts of the Well of Consolation.</P>
<P><HI>Quest</HI> 8 Is it not this to grieve the Spirit of God, and to make him more angry and displeased with you, and to withdraw himself further from your Soul? Can God take it kindly at your hands, when he hath killed the fatted Calf, and made ready his Marriage Supper, and sent his Servants forth to call you
<PB N="26" REF="000909_0033_0FACA0FEE235E388"/>
and invite you, and you turn your back upon it? Do you not provoke him to leave your hearts to great deadness, and let you go sorrowing to your Grave, and never let you taste of the sweetness of these comforts till you get to Heaven? Or how can you complain that God d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>parte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h from you, when you will not come near unto him; that he withdrawe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h from your Soul, when you withdraw from your duty?</P>
<P><HI>Quest</HI> 9 Is it not too great a sign that when you did receive i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, you tasted not of the sweetness of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? and that you missed of the comfort and the ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fit of it, that you have since so long neg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cted it? Do you think you have not cause to repent of your former receiving, when he did not leave an earnest longing in your Soul to come again? Was it possible for you to meet with God, and taste the sweetness of the fulness of Christ, and not desire and long for the like opportunity again? Had you experimentally found the reachings forth of your love to God, and desires after him, and have tasted the sweetness of such actings of love and joy, could you have abstained so long?</P>
<P><HI>Quest</HI> 10. Is it not all one to you, if there had been no such O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinance appoint∣ed? What is it to you, if you receive it not? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it be a Sacrament to others, yet it is not to you: If it be a Seal to others, yet it is not unto you that live in the neg∣lect
<PB N="27" REF="000909_0034_0FACA0FFA27B1278"/>
of it. The Lamb was not the passeo∣ver, but the Lamb killed and roast, and eat∣en, was the Passeover. Nay, let me tell you, it had been better for you if Christ had not ordained it at all; for you could then but have been without the benefit of it, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are now, while you do neglect it: But th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n you would have been without that sin and guilt that now you contract by forbearing of it?</P>
<P>Quest. 11. <HI>Is it not great unthankfulness in you thus to live in the neglect of it? Can you be thankful unto Christ for adding Seals unto his Covenant, while you omit it? Have so many Souls unfeignedly blessed God for this Institution, and will you be guilty of so great Ingratitude?</HI></P>

mistake? For I hope better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation; there∣fore I beseech you in the Fear of God, after true debate and search into your own Soul, answer me these Questions.</P>
<P>First, Do you not see your self utterly lost and undone? Do you not see your misery out of Christ?</P>
<P>Secondly, are you not sensible of the sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat brought you into this miserable Conditi∣on? Is it not the burden your Soul groans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder, and would willingly, heartily willing∣ly be eased of it, as ever sick man was of his sickness, or Prisoner of his chains?

you: I pray you tell me, Is real and unfeign∣ed willingness to be holy, to be like to God, to be in all things guided and directed by the Spirit, and the Word of God, a flower that grows in Natures Garden? Is not the will of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the great rebel against God, and the great opposer of the work of Grace▪ Is it not the complaint of Christ against natural men that they will not come to him, though there∣by they may have Life? <HI>John</HI> 5 40 <HI>How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would I have gathered you, and you would me?

<P N="2">2. Do you say you are willing and Christ is not? <HI>That is your intollerable pride so to think and speak</HI> It is usual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith many dejected Souls, that complain of their own unworthi∣ness, and vileness, and sins, that loath and ab∣hor themselves for their sins, in the great work of humiliation, that yet have this insufferable pride remaining in them, that they are willing but Christ is not. Indeed! have you such good thoughts of your self, and such low, and mean, and hard thoughts of Christ? Is it not Pride enough in you, to have better thoughts of your self, than of other of your fellow Christians, but must you have higher thoughts of your self, than of your Saviour: or do

<P N="3">3.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Second Conclusion, shewing that Believ∣ers must often receive the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THat it is the duty of the Disciples of Christ, often to partake of the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P>Baptism is but once to be administred, but the Lords Supper is often to be received; the frequency of it is not determined, often it must be, how often is not expressed; if you had opportunity every Lords Day, and you re∣deemed and improved it, your Soul may thrive and grow the more in grace and holi∣ness: Meals which are for nourishment must be often; you often eat, and you often drink for the nourishment of Nature, and yet it is not told you how often you must eat, how often you must drink, but the sense and feeling of the want of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, will direct you un∣to this: So if you have but a sense and feel∣ing of the want of this Ordinance, and the things that are there conferred upon Believers, that would guide to a frequent iteration of this Ordinance. Consider therefore,</P>
<P>Do you not often stand in need of being washed in the Blood of Christ? Do you not often defile your self, and gather filth upon your Soul▪ And should you not often apply your self to the Fountain of the cleansing Blood of Jesus Christ?</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="000909_0043_0FACA16C6307E928"/>Secondly, Do you not often blot your E∣vidences, and disturb your peace? and have you not need of the frequent use of that Ordi∣nance, wherein God might renew your evi∣dence and speak peace unto your Conscience? Do you often contract guilt, and should you not often come to have your pardon sealed and confirmed to your Soul in the blood of Christ?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Do you not often need the means of spiritual warmth and quicknings? Are you not often dull, and often dead, and often luke∣warm? and do not those that are often sick, often need their Phisick to purge and make them well? If you are sometime warmed in an Ordinance, do not your affections abate again? That you have not that liveliness of affections, nor that reviving joy, which in the actual performance of the duty you did find? and is it needful to exhort you that have found the benefit of this Ordinance, to go of∣ten to it? Let the Experience of what you have found in it, and the want you do lie un∣der by seldom approaching unto it, quicken your desires after a frequent attendance upon God in it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Do you not often need so great an help for the breaking and so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tning of your heart, for the renewing of your repentance for sin, and strengthning and confirming of your resolutions against it? Is not your heart too apt to fall in love with sin, and to renew its League with sin? Do you not often need to
<PB N="37" REF="000909_0044_0FACA16D222F09A0"/>
be put in remembrance of Gods displeasure against it, his hatred that he bears unto it, &amp; the dreadful effects and deserts thereof, and is not this done more livelily in the Lords Sup∣per? Gods displeasure against sin is more dis∣covered in the Death of Christ, than in turn∣ing the Angels out of Heaven, or <HI>Adam</HI> out of Paradise; or in the Destruction of the Old World, or in the burning of <HI>Sodom,</HI> or in the Damnation of innumerable unbelieving and impenitent Persons.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Do you not often need so great an help for the increasing of your Love to God and Christ? Do you often complain that you love God no more, and will you not more often use this so great a means for the encrea∣sing of your Love?</P>
<P>Sixthly, Do you not often need so great an help for the strengthning of your Faith and Hope, that you may be more able to make a particular application of Christ and his bene∣fits to your Soul, and to have a more lively Hope of the Kingdom of Heaven?</P>
<P>Seventhly, Do you not often need so great an help to put you in remembrance of your Lord Jesus? Are you not too apt to forget him and his Love in dying for you? Is he so much in your Thoughts as he doth deserve? Or is it enough to have some Occasional Thoughts of Christ? Or should you not more solemnly dwell in your Meditations up∣on him? And doth not the Nature and the end of this Ordinance lead and help you to
<PB N="38" REF="000909_0045_0FACA16DE05F5E68"/>
fix your thoughts more permanently upon him, when you see how he was crucified and died for you?</P>
<P>Eighthly, Do you not often need so great an help to make you more thankful for the matchless Love wherewith he hath loved you, and the unparallel'd B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essings he hath purcha∣sed for you, and conferred upon you? Is it not a shame and sin, you are no more in praising God, and rejoycing in him for such priviledges that were procured b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the blood of his only Son, and your dearest Lord? And can you sit at the Table and not have your Souls raised in the highest Admiration of his Love and Mercy to you?</P>
<P>Ninthly, Do you not often need so great an help for the getting and maintaining of more intimate Communion with God, and fellow∣ship with Jesus Christ? Is it not here, that God doth abundantly let forth himself into his peoples Hearts? Is it not here, that Believers feel the goings forth of their Hearts in Love unto him, and Desires after him, and Delight and Joy in him? Do you complain you have so little of God, and will not more often go where you may receive more influences from him.</P>
<P>Tenthly, Do you not more often need so great an help for the closer knitting of your Heart unto the people of God in greater af∣fection and love unto them? Do you love them as you should? Or is there not too great an alienation of your heart and Affecti∣on
<PB N="39" REF="000909_0046_0FACA16EA1F57758"/>
from them? Or doth not this Ordinance which shews you the Love of Christ to all his People incite them that attend upon it, to imi∣tate the Lord Jesus in loving of them? That we should love one another as he hath loved us: When we see we are <HI>one Bread,</HI> and re∣deemed by <HI>one Lord,</HI> and fed at <HI>one Table,</HI> and are washed in the <HI>same Blood,</HI> and enjoy the <HI>same Priviledges,</HI> and are here assured of the <HI>same Inheritance</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI>; doth it not engage us to be of one Heart, and to be kindly affe∣ctionate to one another, as Christ was to us all? Though it is to be bewai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with Tears of Blood, that this Ordinance which should have cemented us in love, and sodered our hearts together, though our corruption hath been the occasion, not the cause of great brea∣ches and divisions in the Church of God.</P>
<P>Thus if you seriously consider your own frequent wants, and often reflect upon your often need of this Ordinance, you will see suffi∣cient reason for your often participation of so frequently needful an Ordinance</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Third Conclusion, proving we are to give great diligence to prepare our selves for the receiving of the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THat whensoever you are to partake of the Lords Supper, you are to be painful &amp; serious in ma∣king preparation for it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="000909_0047_0FACA16F62156720"/>This preparation must be for these reasons, which you may lay to your heart, and find them to be quickning motives to stir you up thereto.</P>
<P>First, From the preparation they were wont to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Passeover under the Law, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 30.3. <HI>They could not keep it at that time, because the Priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently</HI>: They did for a while defer it till they had made more preparation for it: And after their diligence to prepare, they prayed for the pardon of their imperfect preparation, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 30.18, 19▪ <HI>The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his Fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the Sanctuary</HI>: If any man were unclean, he was to stay another Month, and then eat it, <HI>Numb.</HI> 9.10, 11.</P>
<P>That they prepared for the Passeover, ap∣pears by,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Actions they did before the Passe∣over.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Discourse they had with their Chil∣dren before the Passeover.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Time they took up before the Passeover.</P>
<P>First, From the Actions before.</P>
<P>First, Before they did eat the Passeover, they were to cleanse their Houshold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stuff, their Vessels and U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensils from all leavened Bread, that none might be found in them, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cleave unto them.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="000909_0048_0FACA17021B31340"/>The Parallel is, Before we eat the Lords Supper, we must cleanse our hearts and lives from all known sin, that we allow our selves in no known wickedness, that we do not drive a trade of sin, nor be drudges to the Devil, nor Factors for Hell; we may come with many sins <HI>bewailed, striving against, and groaning un∣der them,</HI> but not with one sin <HI>allowed</HI> and <HI>ap∣proved</HI> of.</P>
<P>Secondly, Then they made a stricter search after any bit of leavened Bread, by lighting a Candle, and looking into every little Corner and Chink in the House, the Night before the Passeover.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, a Closer searching of our hearts, by lighting the Candle of Con∣science at the Fire of Gods Word, and look∣ing into every Room and Corner of our Hearts, lest there should be any sin lurking in our Souls, and remaining undiscovered: We should enquire after the sins in our understand∣ing, Will, and Affections, what is amiss in our Love, Delight, Joy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Then having sound the Reliques and Fragments of leavened Bread, they cast it out: That they would not only not use it, but not have it in their sight, that they may not set their Eyes upon it, nor look towards it, or would burn it till it were consumed.</P>
<P>The parallel of this is, The casting away of our sins, when by diligent search we have found it ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. We must not find our sin, to indulge it, but to forsake and kill it: Not to
<PB N="42" REF="000909_0049_0FACA170E61534E0"/>
have our Hearts to hanker after our sin, when we come to the Lords Table.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They had a Form of Words for the cursing of that leavened Bread, which they could not find out, <HI>viz. All the Leaven that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in my power, whether seen by me, or not seen, cleansed by me, or not cleansed; let it be nothing, let it be esteemed as nothing; as the dust of the Earth, let it be scattered and destroyed.</HI></P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, The disowning of every sin, seen or not seen, after this manner, <HI>Lord, if there be any sin in me, which after all my searching of my Heart, I have not found out, let it be accursed, let it be as nothing, as the dust of the Earth; if there be any sin in me, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not dealt severely with, it is not because I love it, but because I could not find it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, From the Discourse they had be∣fore they came, appears they did prepare for it. This was betwixt the Father and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Children.</P>
<P>First, The Children inquired, <HI>What is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meaning of this Service</HI>; Then the Parents answered, It is the Lords Passeover, who passed over the houses of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>E∣gypt,</HI> when he smote the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and deli∣vered our Houses, <HI>Exod</HI> 12.26, 27.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, That Christians should discourse together, or speak unto them∣selves in holy Soliloquy, <HI>viz.</HI> What is the meaning, O my Soul, of this Service, of this Love of Christ in appointing this holy Ordi∣nance? What doth it bring to thy remem∣brance,
<PB N="43" REF="000909_0050_0FACA171A555CCE0"/>
O my Soul? And here you have Oc∣casion of expatiating the whole method of God in exalting the freeness of his Grace in Mans Redemption. <HI>Oh, what meant my dearest Lord in shedding of his blood, and ordaining this for the commemoration of it! Surely it was, O my Soul, to deliver thee from misery, to make thee Partaker of his Grace and Love▪ and to Seal it to thee, and make thee to rejoyce in the remembrance of it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The Children ask, <HI>Why do we eat it with bitter Herbs</HI>? The Parents answered, Because the <HI>Egyptians</HI> made the Life of our Fa∣thers bitter in <HI>Egypt,</HI> that they may be stirred up to greater thankfulness unto God.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, That we should re∣flect upon our sins, which made our lives bit∣ter while we lived in them, and that now we should taste more bitterness in our sins, than ever we found sweetness, pleasure and delight therein.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Why <HI>do we eat it with unleavened bread?</HI> The Parents were to answer, Because the Dough of our Fathers had not time to be leavened.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, That we must make haste to Christ, and eat this New-Testament Passeover with the unleavened Bread of since∣rity and truth: That we must not delay to come out of spiritual-<HI>Egypt,</HI> nor go to Christ in hypocrisie, but in truth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, From the time there was betwixt the taking, and the killing of the Paschal
<PB N="44" REF="000909_0051_0FACA17262A6C9E0"/>
Lamb; the Lamb was taken the tenth day, and killed the fourteenth day of the month, <HI>Exod,</HI> 12.3. <HI>ad</HI> 7. And it is received as a Tradition among the <HI>Jews,</HI> that for the dura∣tion of those four days, the Lamb was tied to their Bed-posts, that in the Evening when they went to bed, and in the Morning when they arose, and in the day-time when they were private in their Chambers; the sight of the Lamb might affect their hearts, and put them in mind of the work they were to do, and be∣think themselves of the greatness of Gods Mer∣cy towards them, in delivering them from <HI>E∣gyptian</HI> Bondage.</P>
<P>The Parallel of this is, That believers, be∣fore the Lords Supper, should take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> compe∣tent measure of time to bethink themselves of the Love of God in delivering them from Sin and Hell, infinitely worse than <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bon∣dage, and prepare themselves to commemorate the Death of Christ, and be partakers of the great Blessing that at the Lords Table true Believers have conferred upon them.</P>
<P>It is not sufficient to spend an hour the night before, or in the morning you are to approach unto it, but some day before to have it in your thoughts, that you may consider the greatness of the work you are to go about.</P>
<P>This Example of the <HI>Jews</HI> is cogent unto us, forasmuch as the Lords Supper is not in∣feriour to the Passeover.</P>
<P N="1">1. Neither in the <HI>Institution</HI> of it; the Passe∣over was by Gods Ordination, and so is the
<PB N="45" REF="000909_0052_0FACA173213EBA18"/>
Lords▪ Supper, but God appointed that by <HI>Moses</HI>: But this was by Christ himself in his own person.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor in the <HI>signification</HI> of it: That to put them in remembrance of their deliverance from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and Typically from Hell: This puts us in remembrance of the love of Christ, in bringing us from misery, and freeing us from torments infinitely worse than <HI>Aegyptian</HI> slavery.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor in the <HI>use and end</HI> of it, this being a seal of the Covenant of Grace, to convey to Believers an assurance of the blessings of the Covenant of promise.</P>
<P N="4">4 Nor in the <HI>manner</HI> of its signification: That a sign of Christ that was to come and suffer; this, that Christ is come, and hath al∣ready suffered.</P>
<P>This is my first Argument why, and Mo∣tive that we should approach to the Lords Supper, after painful and serious preparation: <HI>No Preparation, no participation.</HI> It is not then putting on our finer Cloaths on a Sacra∣ment day, but the Trimming of our hearts, that God expecteth at our hands.</P>
<P>The Second Argument for preparation for the Sacrament, is taken from the <HI>Author</HI> of it, which is God: The more he that doth invite you to his Table is your Superiour, the more you prepare your selves to go to sit down thereat, more than if he be your Inferiour, or your equal. God is infin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely your Superi∣our: Consider what this God is that pre∣pares
<PB N="46" REF="000909_0053_0FACA173E6845A00"/>
this Banquet for you, and prepare for it.</P>
<P N="1">1. He is a great and a <HI>mighty</HI> God, a God of inconceivable Majesty, and transcendent Glory, whose perfection is infinitely above the most raised apprehensions of Angels &amp; Men: and would you go unto the Table of a great King with filthy hands, and in your rags? And would you go to the Table of the great King of Heaven and Earth with a filthy heart, and in your sins?</P>
<P N="2">2. He is a pure and an <HI>holy God:</HI> Indeed every thing here is holy, the <HI>Signs</HI> are holy Signs, the <HI>things signified</HI> are holy things, the <HI>Ends</HI> of the Institution are holy ends, and the <HI>Author</HI> of it is the holy God; and shall our hearts only be unholy? the very externals &amp; utensils about it, are and should be clean; the Cups are clean, the Cloth is clean, else you would be offended, and should not your Heart be clean? If not, would not your God be offended?</P>
<P N="3">3. The Author of this Ordinanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is a <HI>God of infinite Jealousie,</HI> and he is most jealous in the matters of his Worship. In the Second Command, which sets forth the manner of Gods<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Worship, he makes himself known by this Attribute, That he is a <HI>jealous</HI> God; and if his Jealousie should be kindled against you at his Table, it would be uncomfortable, it will be terrible to you.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Author of this Ordinance is an
<PB N="47" REF="000909_0054_0FACA1756FEF6878"/>
<HI>Omniscient God,</HI> and cannot be deceived; if there be but one among a thousand that re∣ceiveth unworthily, his eye will be upon him; he knows his Name, and sees where he sits, God knows the frame of your heart, he knows your end why you are there, and what your diligence was before you came; then come prepared.</P>
<P>The third Argument for diligent preparati∣on is taken from the <HI>matter</HI> of this Sacrament: The more excellent and noble any thing is, the more hainous is the abuse thereof. If a Servant brake and spoil some earthen Pitchers, his Master may more easily pass it by, but if he take his Jewels, and his precious Pearls, and cast them in the kennel, and bury them in the dunghil, he will be more difficultly pacified. If a man shall deal unjustly with a∣nother, it will be displeasing unto God; but if he shall deal unworthily with his Son, he will be provoked: If you should abuse your common Bread and Drink, which God daily gives you for your ordinary repast and nou∣rishment, you commit a Soul-damning Sin; but if you prophane these spiritual dainties, without repentance, your damnation will be aggravated.</P>
<P>Here you have to do with blood, and <HI>then</HI> if ever, you should be serious; but most of all when it is the Blood of God. Consider before you go, that you have <HI>to do with the Blood of Christ,</HI> and let that quicken you to preparation.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="000909_0055_0FACA17625B2F0A0"/>The fourth Argument for diligent prepa∣ration is from the <HI>subject</HI> that is to be par∣taker of it; as we may be considered in a twofold state or capacity.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>What we were.</ITEM>
<ITEM>What we are.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>First, <HI>Every Man is born unfit for the Lords Table</HI>: We were Enemies to God, and therefore except we will come in our enmi∣ty to God, we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st prepare and fit our selves, by being reconciled unto God: We are <HI>born</HI> spiritually dead, and it would not be so loathsome a sight to us to have a dead Corps full of plague sores set down at our Table, as a man dead in Sin to sit down at Gods Table, is loathsome unto God: <HI>Where there is no Life, there is no Appetite; and where there is no Appetite, there is no actual preparation to this duty.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Such as are <HI>truly converted, may yet be indisposed for this duty</HI>; therefore there must be preparation. It is not every one that hath true grace, is presently to be judg∣ed <HI>actually</HI> fit for this Ordinance: As a man that is asleep, is a living, real man, but yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it not fit to eat, and drink, and converse with men; so a man may have Faith, and Love, and Hope, and yet not be fit for this duty, if his Faith be asleep, and Love and Hope be asleep: For a <HI>man that is a worthy Receiver; might re∣ceive unworthily</HI>; my meaning is, That one that is habitually prepared by having the
<PB N="49" REF="000909_0056_0FACA176E613C1C8"/>
truth of grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> receive amiss, by being not actually pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed by the drawing forth of his graces into act and exercise; and how much time must be spent in fervent prayer, in holy meditation, and other duties, before you can feel the actings of Faith and Love, Desire and Delight in God, before you can bring your heart to be broken for your sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fifth Argument for Preparation, is taken from the <HI>Consequents</HI> which will be answerable to our preparation, or neglect thereof, which will be either bad or good For though God doth not bestow the great things in the Sacra∣ment <HI>for</HI> our preparation, yet he will not give them <HI>without</HI> our preparation.</P>
<P>First, The consequents of coming unprepa∣red will be very dreadful.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Such do fearfully increase their guilt, in a very high degree,</HI> in making themselves guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ, though not as an <HI>Actor</HI> in his death, yet virtually as an <HI>Abetter</HI> and <HI>Consenter</HI>; for an <HI>unworthy Receiv∣er, is a Christ murderer,</HI> as he that defaceth the Kings Picture, doth reflect upon his Per∣son. He that dares rush upon the Sacrament with <HI>reigning-sin</HI> in his heart, would be a <HI>Ju∣das</HI> unto Christ, if he were personally upon Earth; and had <HI>Judas</HI> his opportunity, temp∣tations and other circumstances, he would wash his hands in the blood of Christ: that comes, but not to have his <HI>heart</HI> washed in the Sacrament, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.27. And will you
<PB N="50" REF="000909_0057_0FACA177A363D468"/>
<HI>so come,</HI> to have your sin increased, instead of having of it pardoned?</P>
<P>O what a crying Sin is <HI>Blood guiltiness,</HI> tho' it be but the blood of a common man: But what will it be to be guilty of the Blood of the Son of God! Did not the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> cry against <HI>Cain</HI> for vengeance? Oh what a <HI>voice</HI> and <HI>cry</HI> will there be then in the Blood of Christ! and will you have the Blood of Christ <HI>cry against</HI> you, instead of <HI>pleading for</HI> you? Nay, you will sin more than many of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that did actually crucifie him, for many of them did it ignorantly; for had they known him, they could not have crucified the Lord of Glory, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.8. But you know and acknowledge him to be such, and yet will be guilty of his Blood; they did it in his state of humiliation, but you do it in his state of Exaltation. It would have been better for <HI>Judas</HI> if he had not been born, and it would be better for you if you never had received.</P>
<P N="2">2. Such <HI>draw down great Judgments upon themselves</HI>; and no wonder if great guilt and great sin be followed with great Judgments; for God will proportion mens sufferings to their sinnings. <HI>He that cometh without the Wedding Garment on his Soul, shall go away with a Curse upon his Head and Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Consider,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Such <HI>deserve eternal torments, and the damnation of Hell,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.29 <HI>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drink∣eth damnation to himself</HI>: Not to another that
<PB N="51" REF="000909_0058_0FACA17865AE2228"/>
partaketh with him. <HI>Eateth Damnation!</HI> Oh what a dreadful Morsel is damnation! whence you see the reason why the Devil puts on ma∣ny Drunkards to be so eager after this Sacra∣ment, it is that they may drink their own damnation, there is <HI>Death to them in this Cup.</HI> The word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as well as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is ren∣dred damnation in other places, <HI>John</HI> 3.17. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2▪ 12. Yea, this might be the case of a Child of God, that he may deserve damnati∣on, though not be (through repentance) <HI>actually damned.</HI> Damnation <HI>is the desert of this sin,</HI> though not the <HI>portion of the sinner</HI> that is brought to repentance for his sin God may send an Hypocrite from his Table unto Torment. The same <HI>Red Sea</HI> that was Sal∣vation to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> was death and destru∣ction to the <HI>Egyptians. Eateth Damnation!</HI> Oh what a dreadful word is this <HI>Damnation!</HI> And that when a man comes to be Partaker of a Saviour▪ Take heed what you do when you receive: Damnation is not a business to be jested with, nor the Sacrament a work to be trifled at. <HI>Adam</HI> did eat his own death, &amp; so may you your own Damnation.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Such <HI>provoke God to inflict upon them oftentimes heavy and dreadful punishments in this life:</HI> So that though God will not send a Be∣liever to Hell for this his sin, yet he might send him to his Grave for this sin, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.30 <HI>For this cause many are sickly among you, and many weak, and many are fallen asleep.</HI> It is thought that God sent a Plague among the
<PB N="52" REF="000909_0059_0FACA17926A34BE0"/>
<HI>Corinthians</HI> for prophaning the Lords Supper. It is not usual with people in their sickness to reflect upon their unworthy receiving as the Cause thereof: They say, such a time I did o∣ver heat my self, and caught cold, &amp; so my sick∣ness came: But not, I went to the Lords Ta∣ble in my sin, or without actual preparation, and so my sickness came: If unworthy Re∣ceivers had no love unto their Souls, yet for the love they bear unto their Bodies, they should be perswaded to forbear till they were prepared. If Damnation and Hell being out of sight will not affright them, yet Death and the Grave, that is a nearer Object methinks should. Oh how careful should we be to prepare for that which else might be <HI>death to our bodies, and damnation to our Souls</HI>?</P>
<P N="3">(3) Such <HI>Provoke God to take away this Or∣dinance from them.</HI> Gods own People by a∣busing of this priviledge, might forfeit the op∣portunity of approaching unto it: As a Fa∣ther, when he seeth his Children abuse their food, may call his Servants to take away, and set it up, till they shall prize it more, and use it better.</P>
<P>Secondly, The good Consequents are very great if you rightly receive it, with due prepa∣ration and care; and is not that your end in coming to it, that you may be better for it? He that aimeth not at this spiritual advantage in subordination to, and conjunction with the Glory of God, comes he knows not why▪ And to come <HI>for this,</HI> without prepartion, is
<PB N="53" REF="000909_0060_0FACA179E48F1D98"/>
to separate betwixt the end and the mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. Such as come in a right manner, <HI>shall receive more from God when they come:</HI> The time of preparation is your sowing times: When you should sow in tears, and the time of receiving is your reaping time; and he that prepares negligently, shall reap sparing∣ly: he that prepares diligently, shall reap a∣bundantly. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Such shall receive <HI>more grace</HI> from God, they shall come away with more love to God, with m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re desires after God, with more faith in Christ, and hatred to their sins.</P>
<P N="2">2 Such shall receive more <HI>comfort, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI> If you sorroW and weep before you go, you shall come a∣way with your heart full of joy, and your mouth of praises. When you have been for∣mal and lukewarm in your preparation, your heart hath been dull and dead in, and after your receiving; but when lively and diligent, God hath spoken peace unto your Consci∣ence, and assured you of the pardon of your sins, and sent you from <HI>his</HI> Table to your <HI>own,</HI> with a joyful heart, and with a chearful countenance.</P>
<P N="3">3. Such shall be more <HI>acceptable and wel∣come unto God:</HI> What you have done aright, he will graciously accept; and wherein you failed, he will freely pardon? then the <HI>Father</HI> will bid you welcome, and the <HI>Son</HI> will bid you welcome, and the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> will bid you
<PB N="54" REF="000909_0061_0FACA17AA1CD1B50"/>
welcome, when you have been weeping any mourning in secret for your sin, whereby you have crucified the Lord of Life; when you have been begging at the Throne of Grace▪ Lord give me a spiritual Appetite after th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heavenly food: Lord give me power again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my pride, and passion, and earthly mindedness; after you have been searching into every cor∣ner of your heart, that you may find out e∣very <HI>Achan</HI> in your Soul, God will say, <HI>Yonder is a Soul that hath taken pains with himself in secret, and hath cryed unto me for a gracious ac∣ceptance of his person and performances, &amp; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he shall find that he is welcome; for I will sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forth my Spirit, and comfort him, I will giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him my Grace, and quicken him, I will give him my Son, and satisfie him</HI> Oh it will be swe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to have God to smile upon you at his Table<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But to have him frown when you are there will be uncomfortable; and to have hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> withdraw, will make your du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to be unprof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>table: Could you take delight at a Man Table, if he frown upon you for every Mor∣sel that you eat? and will it not be worse when you take the Bread, <HI>then</HI> to have God to frown? And when you take the Cup, <HI>then</HI> to have God to frown, and say, Friend, how came you in hither amongst my Children, when you have not on the Wedding-garment? or if you have Grace, you have not endea∣voured by painful preparation, to have it drawn forth into act and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcise.</P>
<P>Sixth Argument; God makes great <HI>prepara∣tions
<PB N="55" REF="000909_0062_0FACA17B615AD950"/>
for us</HI> in this Ordinance, therefore we should make great preparations when we come to partake of it; and shall not we be preparing to receive, what God is preparing to give? Doth the Great God make prepara∣tions to entertain poor Sinners at his Table, and shall we come rashly and carelesly to it? <HI>Matth.</HI> 22 4. <HI>Tell them that are bidden, Be∣hold I have prepared my dinner, my Oxen and my Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready.</HI> Oh what delightful words are these! Oh that they were delighting to my Soul! Oh how refreshing are these things prepared! and how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the invitation of God to us to come and be partakers of them! Justice might have prepared Torments for us, but behold, Mer∣cy hath prepared precious Priviledges for us! Oh what great things were to be done, that this Supper might be prepared for us. The Son of God must come down from Heaven to Earth, and become the Son of Man; he must suffer and bleed, and dye, and have his gar∣ments dyed in blood, that this Ordinance might be prepared for Believers. Besdes, here are great things prepared to be given to such as do prepare to come rightly to it; here is <HI>pardon</HI> of sin prepared for you; here is <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>comfort</HI> prepared for you; here is further <HI>encrease</HI> of Grace prepared for you: But where are your preparations to receive them? Here is <HI>merit</HI> ready to justifie you: Here is <HI>blood</HI> ready to wash and sanctifie you; here is <HI>righ∣teousness</HI> ready to be imputed to you: But is
<PB N="56" REF="000909_0063_0FACA17C23DEA9B8"/>
your <HI>faith</HI> ready to receive them? Is your <HI>love</HI> ready to be acted towards this Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that hath made them ready for you? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your <HI>heart</HI> ready to give thanks and praises to this God that will bestow these things up∣on you? Or will you give occasion to your God to complain of you, and say, I am rea∣dy to give increase of Grace to yonder Be∣liever, but he is not ready to receive it; he hath not enlarged the capacity of his Soul, by getting greater hungrings &amp; thirst∣ings after it: I am ready to give in peace and comfort, when his Soul wants both peace and comfort, but yet he is not ready to partake thereof.</P>
<P>But if you come in your sins, great an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> terrible things are prepared for you; a hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vy charge is drawn up against you, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you do abuse the blood of Christ; that yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crucifie the Lord afresh: And Conscience i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ready to accuse you, the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> ready to condemn you, <HI>Satan</HI> ready to sei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon you, and <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> ready to invade you, and <HI>Hell</HI> ready to tormen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you, and this is dreadful.</P>
<P>Seventh Argument, <HI>God looketh for great entertainment in our hearts, and at our hands,</HI> and therefore we should prepare for him: God welcomes you unto his Table, and you must welcome God into your heart; and both require preparation. When you expect some Noble Man to come into your house, what preparations do you make for
<PB N="57" REF="000909_0064_0FACA17CE3E233F8"/>
him? Your house is cleansed, your best furniture brought forth, and all your Ser∣vants ready to attend him▪ When you come unto a Sacrament, the great God is to come into your heart, therefore set open the everlasting gates of your Soul, that the King of Glory may enter in: And let eve∣ry room in your heart be washed and cleansed, and hung with the Tapstery, and Embroidery of the Spirit, and let all the Faculties of your Soul and the Graces in your heart, be ready to attend him. Let Love receive him, let Faith eye him, and your Soul have Converse and Communion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith him.</P>
<P>Eighth Argument, <HI>The many Duties that here in order are to be performed, and the many Graces that are here to be exercised, call for dili∣gent preparation.</HI> If you were to perform a∣ny of those duties singly, which you are here to do joyntly, it is your duty to prepare for each of them. Here sometimes you are to pray to him: Here sometime you are to be imployed in pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing of him: Here sometime you are to hear from him: And here some∣time you are to meditate upon him, and upon the great work of Mans Red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mption: and will you not prepare for all these Duties which are so hard and difficult rightly to be done? Here your heart is to be broken, and to be bound up: Here your Soul is to have a mix∣ture of affection of joy, and sorrow; Sorrow that you sinned; and by your sins and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing
<PB N="58" REF="000909_0065_0FACA17DA66DD078"/>
all this sorrow, &amp; sufferings upon your Lord: Joy, that your Lord would die and suffer for your sins; here you are to love him, and to hate your sins; here you are to receive him, and apply him, and all his priviledges to your Soul. And do not such great things as these require your greatest preparations?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Containing several Questions to excite us to greater diligence in preparation.</HEAD>
<P>BUT because your hearts are too apt to do the greatest work with slightness, and where there should be the greatest care and diligence? I shall further add a few considera∣tions to your mind, where with you would do well to urge your heart whenever you are to go unto this Ordinance: In the fear of God I beseech you answer these following demands.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>What if you were to dye this day, what preparation would you have made then?</HI> The same you are to make when you are to receive the Lords Supper.</P>
<P>Two things especially concern a man to get before he dyes, and look what degrees of ne∣cessity there is of both for a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Death, the same proportion of nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssity there is of both for the Lords Supper▪</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="59" REF="000909_0066_0FACA17E62DC0AB0"/>1. <HI>It doth concern a man before he dye, to get the truth of Grace,</HI> that he have real Love to GOD, Faith in Christ, Peace with God thro' Christ, and without this a man cannot dye happily: This is as necessary for a man that is to come to the Lords▪ Supper, that he love God, that he do indeed believe and hate his sins, or else he cannot receive worthily: Wo be to that man that goes down to his Grave before he be converted; and wo be to that man that comes to the Sacrament before he be born again.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It concerns a man before he dye, to get some evidences of his grace,</HI> and this is necessary to his more comfortable dying: a man may have grace, and so be delivered from the hurt of death; but if he have not some evidences of this Grace, he will lye under the fears of death. So a man, before he goes to the Lords Ta∣ble, should endeavour to get the knowledge, sight and evidence of his interest in Christ, &amp; this is necessary to his more comfortable recei∣ving; without which, though he may receive worthily, yet not without some fears; <HI>I fear Christ did not dye for me, I fear this blood was not shed for me, I fear I do not love God</HI>; and so will be deprived of those joyes and comforts which would come in by a particular applicati∣on of Christ to himself; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he can conclude, <HI>Here is blood, &amp; it was shed for me; Here is righ∣teousness, and it is imputed unto me</HI>: I think a man that is not fit to dye, is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to receive: A Man should sit down at the Lords Table
<PB N="60" REF="000909_0067_0FACA17F23084300"/>
with as great care as he would lye down in his Grave; and be as serious for his Soul at this Ordinance as he would upon his dying Bed: <HI>You should go to the Lords Table, as care∣fully as if you were going into another World.</HI></P>
<P>But do you so? Tell me, if you had been to dye this day you come so receive, would you not have prayed more than you have done? Would you not have shed more tears for your sins? would not more of your groans and sighs have pierced the Heavens, and reached the ears of God? Would you not have searched your heart more narrowly? and passed sentence upon your self more im∣partially? And been humbled more deeply? Would you not have said, if I be mistaken a∣bout the truth of Grace, now I am to dye, I am lost for ever? And will you not say, if I be mistaken about the truth of Grace, now I am to sit down at the Lords Table, without my serious Repentance, I am undone for e∣ver? And instead of having the pardon of my sin sealed to my Soul, by my unworthy going, I bind the guilt of all my former sins upon my Soul, as if the other were not bur∣then great enough. I have added this to all the rest, in making my self guilty of the blood of Christ.</P>
<P>But that you may receive with the same, seriousness as if you were to dye, ask your self th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se three Questions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What sin would most disturb the peace of my Conscience, if I were to dye to day?</HI> And
<PB N="61" REF="000909_0068_0FACA17FE49FE290"/>
mourn most for that sin at the Lords Table: What is the Sin that would make you most afraid to die, and be a trouble to your depart∣ing Soul? Would it be your Pride or Passion, or your inordinate loving of the world? Would it be your neglect of secret duty, or your careless performance of it, that you pray∣ed no more frequently, no more ferven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly▪ Would it be that you forgot the Lord so long, and neglected your precious Soul so long, that you have done no more for God, that you have lived no more unto him? That so much of your precious time is gone, and so little of your necessary work is done? Let that cause trouble to your heart, and fetch ears from your eyes, when you are at the Lords Table.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What Mercy is it you would beg from God if now you were dying?</HI> O beg that mercy when you are receiving; if you were dying, would you ask for Riches, or for Honours, or the great things of this World? alas, these would not fit you for your death; or would it be the truth of grace, the favour of God, assurance of his love, an interest in Christ, in his Promises, in his Priviledges, and an evidence of your title to his Kingdom? Would you not then wish, O that God would pardon me, and tell me he hath pardoned me! Oh that he would now be mine, and own me for his own! would not these be your desires if you were to dye?</P>
<P>Desire the same when you are to receive
<PB N="62" REF="000909_0069_0FACA180A4540898"/>
the Supper of your Lord. Will you go thi∣ther with desires after riches, and temporal enjoyments? or with desires that others would think well of you, and esteem you as a Chri∣stian, though you care not to be so? These things will not fit you for receiving no more than for dying: If you were to dye, would you desire to be thought godly, rather than be so indeed? What if one should think you dye with grace in your heart, and you do not? and what if others should think you re∣ceive with grace in your heart, and do not; neither of these would do you real good: beg then the same things when you receive, as you would if you were to die.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What mercy is there you would especially bless God for, if you were to dye?</HI> Give thanks to God for that mercy when you do <HI>receive</HI>: If you were to die, would you chiefly bless God for making of you rich and great in the world? or for making of you truly good and holy towards God? would you not upon a dying Bed bless God for Christ, for the par∣don of your sins, and for the hopes you have of an eternal blessed life? give thanks to God for these, with as great reality at the Lords Table, as if you were going to the Bar of God from a dying Bed.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What if Christ were personally pre∣sent, and were to administer the Sacrament to you with his own hands, what preparation would you make then?</HI> If Christ your Lord and Ma∣ster were now upon the Earth, and were to
<PB N="63" REF="000909_0070_0FACA18162F33848"/>
sit with you at the Table, what care would you have used to have got your heart into an holy frame? If Christ had been with you in your Closet, when you were upon your knees, would you not have prayed more earnestly, and wept more abundantly than you did? If Christ had been with you the night before, &amp; seen you look more into your Shop-Book, than into the Book of God, and the Book of your Heart, and seen you turn over the leaves of your Books of Account, and not the Vo∣lume of your life; and been with you when you were more busie in cleansing of your House, than of your Heart? would you not have blushed to look him in the face at his Table? Why, Christ <HI>as God,</HI> was really with you, when you were preparing of your heart, and took special notice of your diligence, or remisness in that work. He is with you in the morning before you go, he observes what time you rise, what time you spend, what pains you take in order to this duty: And though they be poor, mortal, sinful men, that do admini∣ster this Ordinance to you in Christs Name and stead, yet he requires you should be as se∣rious as if he himself were visibly present; for as he is God, he is really present: And will you not reverence and dread Christ as God, as much as you would Christ as Man? The Ma∣ster of the Feast doth surely come and view his Guests, and if there were one Hypocrite among a thousand Receivers, he would know him by name, and fix his eye upon him, and
<PB N="64" REF="000909_0071_0FACA18220C79230"/>
say, <HI>Friend, What make you here amongst my people, when you have not that love to me as they have, nor take that pains to prepare your self as they have done? Mark</HI> 22.11, 12, 13. He did say, this is the <HI>Judas</HI> that will betray me; and he will say, This is the man that profanes my Table; this is the woman that abuses my Blood: Think of this when you are to come unto this duty, and this dignity, to be a Guest at this Table of the Lord.</P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>VVhat if you should see God strike every unworthy Receiver down dead in the place with the bread in his mouth, or with the Cup in his hand, what preparation would you make then?</HI> Or if God should inflict some painful and tormenting disease upon every one that comes amiss, how careful would you be then? if God should say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Death, as <HI>Absalom</HI> did to his Servants concerning <HI>Amnon,</HI> 1 Sam. 13 28. <HI>Absa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om commanded his Servants, saying, mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ye n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w when</HI> Amnons <HI>heart is merry with Wine, and when I say unto you, Smite</HI> Amnon, <HI>then kill him, fear not, have not I commanded you</HI>? What if God should say to Death, when such a man is receiving the Sacramental Wine, and I say unto thee, Smite him, then kill him; fear not, I have commanded thee! If God should deal with you as he did with the <HI>Israel∣ites,</HI> in Psal. 78.30, 31. <HI>While the Meat was in their Mouths, the wrath of God came upon them, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew the fattest of them.</HI> It would surely be a dreadful sight to se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an unworthy Receiver go down to his Grave, and to Hell
<PB N="65" REF="000909_0072_0FACA182E5594B68"/>
with the Sacrament in his mouth: Or what if God should do as it is exprest in another case, <HI>Job</HI> 20.23. <HI>When he is about to fill his Belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</HI> How would you come then? Or what if you should fall down at the Ministers feet, as <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI> at the Apostles feet, if you should dare to come unworthily, what care would you take then?</P>
<P>You do not know but God may do so, and to venture upon a Tryal here, is dange∣rous. Unworthy Receiving hath been the death, as well as the damnation of many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o come. Therefore beware.</P>
<P>Quest. 4. <HI>What if men could look into your heart, and observe the frame and temper of your soul, what preparations would you make then?</HI> If it should be known to the Minister, and to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Receivers, what time you spent in secret, in praying and self examination, would you not spend more time than now you do? Else many would have a less esteem of your Piety than now they have. If an Holy Man (un∣known to you) had stood at your Closet door and overheard you pray so lukewarmly as you did, would you not have blushed that he should have seen you at the Sacrament? And all this is known to God; and should not the eye and knowledge of God affect you more, than if all the Men in the world could know and see your heart? He sees your <HI>principle</HI> and <HI>end</HI> more exactly than men could do,
<PB N="66" REF="000909_0073_0FACA183A1AC5C80"/>
if your breast were all of transparent glass.</P>
<P>Quest. 5. <HI>What if this were the last opportu∣nity you should ever have to be at Gods Table, what preparation would you make then?</HI> If you were to do that which is of so great concern∣ment, which you must never do more; If God from Heaven should call to you the night before, and say, Now look well to the frame of your heart, that you go with care, and eat in Faith, and come away with profit, for you shall never receive more; would you then be so slight as now you are? Why, how do you know you shall? Are you not Mor∣tal; And have you not seen some at one time at a Sacrament that were dead and in their Graves, and their Souls in Heaven or in He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> before the next? Hath God given you a Leas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of your life? Or hath he told you when you have one opportunity, that he will give to you another? Come then every time as you would do if you were sure it were your last, as you are not sure but it may be indeed your last.</P>
<P>Quest. 6 <HI>What if you were to go from the Sacramental board to Gods Bar, from his Table to his Tribunal, what preparation would you make then?</HI> If God should from Heaven tell you, <HI>The same day you do receive, the same day I will judge you,</HI> the same day I will require an ac∣count of you, how you came, and why you came, and whether you did eat in faith, and drink in faith, and do all as one that did be∣lieve a Judgment, and a life to come; why this may be your case, and thus God might
<PB N="67" REF="000909_0074_0FACA18468D4D9B0"/>
deal with you, and how if he should, after you have come unpreparedly?</P>
<P>Quest. 7. <HI>What if you had been then present under the Cross of Christ, when he was crucified, and seen his Wounds, and heard his dying groans, and were then to come to commemorate this Death of Christ, what preparation would you have made then?</HI> What if you had seen your Lord swea∣ting drops of Blood in a cold season, and seen the Thorns upon his head, the Spear thrust into his side, that you might have a window to look into his heart, to see how he hath lov∣ed you, and seen the Nails in his hands and feet; and were, after such a sight as this, to come unto this Table, with what aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction would you then come? Why, all this is really represented to you in this Ordinance, and should be as certainly believed, as if you had with your eyes beheld it done. What affecti∣ons do some discover in beholding the executi∣on of a common Malefactor? And shall not we before-hand endeavour to raise our affect∣ions when we are to come to see the Cruci∣fixion of our dearest Lord?</P>
<P>Quest. 8. <HI>What if one that hath been damn∣ed for unworthy receiving, should come unto thee from the place of Torment, and tell thee he hath found it a provoking sin, and that which makes damnation more intollerable, to eat unworthily at the Table of the Lord, what preparation wouldst thou make then?</HI> It is no breach of Charity to conceive, or to conclude, that some that have been at the Lords Table, are now in Hell,
<PB N="68" REF="000909_0075_0FACA18525E504F0"/>
and shall be there for ever: for if drunkards, swearers, or hypocrites shall come unto this Ordinance, that shall not save them, <HI>dying such.</HI> Christ himself that at the terrible day of his coming shall judge these men for abusing of his Blood, hath told us before-hand, than ma∣ny such shall be cast into everlasting torments, Luk. 13 25 <HI>When once the Master of the House is risen up, and hath shut too the Door, &amp; ye begin to stand without &amp; to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are</HI>: ver. 26. <HI>Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets</HI>; As if they should say▪ Lord, we think it strange to find the Gat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heaven shut against us; we think it strange that we that have been thy hearers, and have been at thy Table, that thou shouldest not know whence we are, that thou shouldest not approve us nor receive us: But Christ again replies, ver. 27 <HI>But he shall say, I tell you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> know you not whence you are, depart from me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> workers of Iniquity</HI>: As i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he should say, I told you once before, that I did not know you, love you, nor approve you; and though you plead your outward Church priviledges of hea∣ring and receiving, yet I tell you once again, I know you not; go get you gone, go, get you down into eternal torments, depart, depart! You were Professors of Piety, but you were Lovers &amp; Workers of Iniquity. Now, suppose that thou hast known and seen at this Table
<PB N="69" REF="000909_0076_0FACA185E3080C50"/>
with thee, that hath died in his sins, &amp; been damned for them, and hath been in Hell a year or two suffering the Vengeance and the wrath of God for this, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for his other sins, should he come to thee and tell thee, I have known since I departed out of this life, in which thou now dost live, what is the punish∣ment that is due unto unworthy Receivers, for I have felt it; believe me, <HI>though a damned Soul,</HI> for I have felt it; I suffer much for my unjust dealing with men, but I suffer more for my unjust medling with the Blood of Christ; I suffer much for my excessive use of provision at my own Table, for my Gluttony &amp; Drun∣kenness, but I suffer more for abusing of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Lords Sup∣per, when I was upon the Earth. Or suppose he had been an Hypocrite that is now in Hell for this so hainous crime, and should come and tell thee, When I was in thy capacity of life; when it was my time to live where thou now dost, I was admitted to the Lords Supper, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now thou art, and I gave as good an account unto the Minister (as to words and expressi∣ons) as thou hast done; I told him I was convinced of my lost estate, that I was weary of sin, and grieved for it, and was willing to accept of Christ upon his Gospel-terms▪ and this I said with tears in my eyes; that the Mi∣nister thought my Condition good, but I de∣ceived him and my self too, by lying to him; for now I find <HI>I</HI> was not willing to let such a particular lust go, that parted betwixt me and
<PB N="70" REF="000909_0077_0FACA1876FEEEB78"/>
Christ: And the <HI>Congregation</HI> with whom I did receive, did think my condition to be good, because they saw me weep when I took the Bread, and saw my tears run down my cheeks when I took the Wine, but they did not see the Hypocrisie of my heart, nor the sin I did indulge, and would not part with at Christs command: But now I am under the sentence of damnation, and have suffered more than thou canst conceive for this my sin; Oh, I am damned, for the abusing of that Blood that should have saved me! I am for ever dam∣ned for dabling in that Blood as an unholy thing, in which I was often intreated to have had my heart been washed: It is <HI>dreadful, dreadful, dreadful!</HI> Thou dost not know that yet art upon the Earth, what a <HI>dreadful</HI> thing it is to lye in Hell, and bear the punishment that is inflicted upon unworthy Receivers. After such an admonition as this from a damned Soul, what preparations wouldst thou make; why, the Ministers of God do tell thee so, and why wilt thou not credit our Doctrine as much as the words of a damned Soul! Nay, God himself doth tell thee plainly in his Word the greatness of this sin, and the punishment thereof, and wilt thou not believe the true eternal God before a damned Reprobate? Or shall not the words of that God that shall Judge thee, aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct thine heart, and make as deep an impression upon thy Soul, as would the words of one that should come to thee from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ongst the damned?</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="000909_0078_0FACA18822C029F8"/>Quest. 9. <HI>What if Christ should call from</HI> Heaven <HI>as he did to</HI> Saul <HI>in another case</HI>; Saul, Saul, <HI>why persec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>test thou me? So what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he should call to thee while thou art eating, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thou art drinking at his Table,</HI> Sinner, Sinner, <HI>why prophanest thou my Blood? And should mark thee out, and make thee known, what preparation wouldst thou make then?</HI> When Christ was upon the Earth, eating with the Twelve, he said, <HI>Verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me:</HI> Oh what an amazing word was this! how did it fill their hearts with fear and sorrow, yet not knowing who was the Man that should do this! How did they look one upon another! and said, one by one, <HI>Lord is it I</HI>? and another, <HI>Lord is it I</HI>? and were ve∣ry inquisitive to know who was the man that should do this so hainous fact; whom the Lord discovered by a sign, <HI>He that dippeth with me in the dish, the same shall betray me,</HI> that is the Man, that is the Traitor.</P>
<P>So, if while the Congregation is met to commemorate his death, Christ should cry from Heaven, saying, There is one amongst you that is prophaning of my Blood, that is unworthily eating of my Body, that is come hither in his sins; how wistly would they look upon one another, with paleness in their faces, and fear in their hearts, not knowing who should be the Person that is doing this? one saying within himself, <HI>Lord, I hope it is not I</HI>; and another, <HI>Lord, I hope it is not I.</HI> No saith Christ, it is <HI>yonder</HI> man, that hath now the

bread in his mouth, or <HI>yonder</HI> man that sits in yonder seat, and is now taking the Cup into his hand, and drinking of it; this is the man, have him out from among you: If this should be the course that Christ would take, what preparation wouldst thou make then? how narrowly wouldst thou search thy heart? how fervently wouldst thou pray before thou co∣mest, that thou mightest not be the person that Christ should thus cry out against from Heaven; nor thus shame thee before the pub∣lick Congregation? Why, though Christ doth not thus for the present, yet he will discover the sinner, &amp; publish the sin, at a more <HI>Dread∣ful day, and before a greater Congregation</HI>; when all the World shall be gathered together, and before them all, he shall lay this unto thy charge, before Angels, Men and Devils: <HI>This is the man that did carelesly come unto my Table, and did prophane my holy Institution, therefore take him Devils, and drag him down with you in∣to eternal torments, and cast him into the Lake of Fire, where he shall suffer the vengeance of eternal burnings, for his bold adventure in com∣ing unprepared, and in his sins unto my Table: Devils take him with you, for he shall never come into my Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>These questions I would desire you with greatest seriousness to propound unto your self when you are to approach to this solemn duty, and find your hearts to be slight in, and backward to proportionable Preparation to the weightiness of the work.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Containing some Directions to get our hearts rightly disposed for the receiving of the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus far proceeded in proving it your important duty, to prepare your hearts for this Ordinance, and laying down some serious Questions for quick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing you thereunto; I next come to give you some Directions what you must do, that your receiving may be acceptable unto God, and profitable unto you: And they are these four.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Search your own heart, exquiring nar∣rowly into the state of your Soul, how it is betwixt God and you.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Solemnly consider such things a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have a tendency in them to dispose your heart thereto.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Fervently pray to God before you go, that you may receive worthily when you are there.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Seriously discourse with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me</HI> (if you have opportunity) <HI>about such things as may conduce to raise your Affections, and quic∣ken your Graces before you go</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>Strictly search thine own heart,</HI> 1 Cor. 11.28. <HI>But let a man examine himself, and
<PB N="74" REF="000909_0081_0FACA18A61A93FA0"/>
so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</HI> The word signifieth a diligent and narrow search into the Nature &amp; Pro∣perties of the thing that is the Object there∣of, as a Goldsmith proves the goodness of his Mettle. Now, Christian Reader, for thine help therein, I would advise thee to put such Questions as these unto thy self, and after due deliberation with thy self, and prayer unto God, that <HI>he would discover the state of thy Soul unto thee,</HI> give in a true and serious Answer, <HI>as one that knows then must again be called to an Account, and be examined by God himself at the last Day.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>Have I a principle of spiritual life, or am I yet dead in Trespasses and Sins?</HI> O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Soul! the work thou art intending at a Sacrament, it is lively work; and if thou art dead thou canst not do it: thou art to go feed upon the bread of life, and if thou art dead, thou canst not do it. Thou art to feast no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only <HI>with,</HI> but <HI>upon</HI> the Lord? But if thou art dead, thou canst not do it. I find it re∣corded in <HI>Numb.</HI> 19.10, 11. If any man was defiled by reason of a dead body, he was not to eat the Lords Passover till the second month. How much more unfit am I to eat the Lords Supper, if yet my heart be dead, <HI>not only dull, but dead</HI>; there is no converse between the living and the dead; dead men do not con∣verse with living men; and a <HI>dead heart</HI> alto∣gether void of spiritual life, <HI>cannot converse with a living God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="000909_0082_0FACA18B24A5D600"/>In order therefore to the discovering of thy spiritual life, I will propound these following Enquiries, to which give in thy answer seri∣ously, as in the fear of God; and solemnly, as in the presence of that God that doth search thy heart, and know thy state, and let thy Conscience make reply as thou wouldest do if thou wast now to dye.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Hast thou ever had any spiritual sense of things good and evil</HI>? Didst thou ever <HI>see</HI> the excellency and the beauty of Christ, and the vileness and deformity of sin? Is Christ most lovely, and sin most loathsome in thine eyes? Didst thou ever <HI>taste</HI> such sweetness that there is in Christ, in a Promise, or in commu∣nion with God, that it makes thee choose Christ, embrace a Promise, prefer Communi∣on with God above all things in this World? or <HI>didst</HI> thou ever taste such bitterness in sin, that makes thee loath it, and unfeignedly wil∣ling to leave &amp; to forsake it? once thou hadst no relish in spiritual things, but hast thou now? time was when thou didst taste sweet∣ness in thy sin, when thou didst delight there∣in: but is it as bitter to thee now, as then it was pleasant and delightful? Thou hast had an <HI>ear to hearken</HI> to the Temptations of the Devil, the Flatteries of the World, to Sinners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>icing thee to Sin, to the corruptions of thine own heart, calling thee to yield to all these: but thou hadst not an ear to listen to the mo∣tions of the Spirit of God, nor to the voice of the Ministers of God, nor to the voice of the
<PB N="76" REF="000909_0083_0FACA18BE37DBD38"/>
Mercies, nor the Judgments of God, nor to the voice and cry of thy own Conscience▪ but now thou art deaf unto the former, the Devil calls, but thou wilt hear, and Sinners call, but thou wilt not hearken; and thine ears are open to the Latter, if God calls, thou say∣est, <HI>Speak Lord, thy Servant heareth.</HI> If the Spirit whispereth to thy Heart, thou perceiv∣est his meaning, and obeyest, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thou once didst <HI>feel</HI> Ordinances and Duties to be a Bur∣den to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hee, and groanedst under them as a Load too heavy for thee to bear, and this was when thou didst make light of Sin: Christ's <HI>easie</HI> yoke thou thoughtest to be <HI>intolerable,</HI> but Sins <HI>intolerable</HI> yoke thou judgest to be <HI>easie,</HI> because Sin was in thy Heart, as (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Element) in is proper place: But tell me▪ dost thou not now groan under the weight o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin? Dost thou not really think there is no evil of affliction so heavy as the evil of trans∣gression? Doth it not make thee cry out, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of Death</HI>? That now thou couldest, at least sometimes, desire that thou mightest be loosed from thy body of fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh▪ that thou mayst be freed from this body of sin? if so, thou art alive.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Hast th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mortified sin, or hast thou not</HI>; is sin dead or alive? if thy sin do live and reign, then thou art dead; if thy sin be dead, then thou dost live; the life and reign of sin, and the life and power of grace cannot consist in the same Soul at the same time:
<PB N="77" REF="000909_0084_0FACA18CA1735EA8"/>
though sin be in thine Heart yet thine Heart is not <HI>for,</HI> nor in thy sins, though sin be in thy affections, yet indeed Sin hath lost thine affections; as there is sin in thy love, but thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost not love thy Sin; there is Sin in thy joy, but thou dost not rejoyce in thy sin; thou dost not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind those flaming desires of thine Heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter forbidden things, as sometime thou didst; neither hath sin that <HI>universal ac∣knowledged</HI> Authority in thy Soul, as once it had; nor that peaceable possession in thy heart, which once thou wast contented to give and yield unto it; but it is even Death to thee to feel these lusts so much as crawling in thy heart, though they do not rule; if so, then Sin is dead, and thou dost live; if not so, then Sin doth live, and thou art dead.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Canst thou gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an and cry unto the Lord, and will nothing still thee but a Christ</HI>? then surely thou dost live; though thou canst not word thy D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sires at the Throne of Grace (as New born Babes cannot ask, but yet can cry for the breast) nor in such Language (as others) ask for Christ and Grace; yet thou canst <HI>Cry</HI> for Christ, and weep for Grace, &amp; all the Creatures cannot quiet thee till thou hast hopes that Christ is formed in thee: Surely they have spiritual Life, that in this sense do thus cry after Christ.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Dost thou grow in the Graces of the Spirit</HI>? It may be thou darest not say thou hast more Grace, but this thou findest, thou hast more desires after Grace; <HI>that is more
<PB N="78" REF="000909_0085_0FADDF7ED197B920"/>
Grace.</HI> Art thou indeed thankful for a little Grace, but yet art reaching after more? Thou prizest one dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Grace above thousands of Gold and Silver; yet it is not a little will serve thy turn; dost thou grow more weary of thy Sin? Dost thou grow more ear∣nest after Christ, and God, and Heaven? Surely growth is a proof of life.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Dost thou work for God, and Christ, and Heaven, and for thy Soul in a spiritual man∣ner</HI>? Spiritual Operations do discover spiritual life. Many live a natural life, that will not work; but those that be spiritually alive, be at work, though some more, and some less. Dost thou <HI>pray,</HI> and <HI>labour</HI> in thy prayers? Dost thou hear, and take pains with thy heart in hearing? Dost thou do thy work accord∣ing to those spiritual <HI>Rules</HI> which God hath given thee in his Word, or wherein thou fail∣est thou art grieved for it? Dost thou work from a spiritual <HI>principle</HI> of <HI>love</HI> to God, and holy <HI>fear</HI> of him? dost thou pray unto him because thou lovest him? and dost thou ab∣stain from sin, and watch and pray against it, because thou wouldest neither offend or grieve him? Hast thou a spiritual <HI>end</HI> in working while thou livest, that thou mayest glorifie &amp; honour God? Though all thy working in this manner deserve nothing from the Lord; neither dost thou thus labour in all thy duties, <HI>to rely</HI> upon them, and to take thee off from resting upon Christ; yet are they evidences that thou art raised from the death of sin, to
<PB N="79" REF="000909_0086_0FACA18D61E08FC8"/>
a life of grace; and having life thou must have food, and God hath prepared it for thee upon his Table, and thou mayest go and feed thereon. This is the first thing that you should enquire after, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to your state, whether you be spiritually alive.</P>
<P>Quest. 2▪ <HI>Do I hunger and thirst after Christ?</HI> This also will be an evidence of your spiritual life; for dead men do not hunger, they do not thirst: Say then to thy self, Lo, Oh my Soul! thou art invited to a Feast, to a Ban∣quet of Gospel-dainties, to <HI>a Feast of fat things, a Feast of Wines on the Lees, of fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees, well refined,</HI> Isa. 25.6 <HI>Lo, Oh my Soul,</HI> Wisdom <HI>hath kil∣led her Beasts, she hath mingled her Wine, she hath also furnished her Table, she hath sent forth her Maidens, she cryeth upon the high places of the City; whoso is simple let him turn in hither: As for him that wanteth understanding, she saith unto him, Come eat of my Bread, and drink of the Wine which I have mingled,</HI> Prov. 9.2, 3, 4, 5. Thus the Lord doth call thee, O my Soul! to rich and costly provisions, but where is thy hunger? where is thy appetite?

Art thou impatient till he come unt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thee? Dost thou think the time is long till he doth fill thee? Canst thou take any pains th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thou mightest enjoy him? Must thou have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, or nothing will content thee? Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> thou art one whom God doth call; be encou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raged, arise, and go to the Table of thy Lord This is another thing that thou must enquire after, because it is not only thy duty to have life, but to have spiritual hungrings after Christ when thou goest unto the Table of the Lord▪</P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>Do I love God and Christ, or do not?</HI> If I do not love him, what have I to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to go unto his Table? If God be an enemy to me, and I yet an enemy to God, where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore should I go and bring down wrath upon my self? but if I love him, why should I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so dismayed because I am a Sinner, since the Lord is willing freely to bestow all things that are here provided, upon them that love him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The more sin I find I have, if I love him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> see the greater need I have to go unto him.

dined, Jesus said unto</HI> Simon Peter, Simon <HI>Son of</HI> Jonas, <HI>lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love</HI>— And this question Christ put to him the second, and the third time: So do thou before thou goest to this Supper; ask thy Soul, O my Soul! <HI>lovest thou the Lord Jesus</HI>? Canst thou say, the Lord knoweth that I love him? Yet ask again the second time, Oh my Soul, <HI>lovest thou the Lord Jesus</HI>? Canst thou again with <HI>Peter</HI> answer, <HI>Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee</HI>? but that thou mayest be sure, enquire again the third time, Tell me, Oh my Soul! <HI>Lovest thou indeed the Lord Je∣sus</HI>? For there are many that be mistaken, and think they love him, but they do not: Canst thou therefore appeal to God, and say, <HI>Lord, thou that knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee; I</HI> do not indeed love thee as thou hast loved me, yet I love thee: I do not love thee as much as others do, nor as much as I my self desire to do, and that is my grief and sorrow; but yet I love thee, and that is my peace and comfort: And I have these evi∣dences of my love, that makes me say, <HI>Lord, I love thee,</HI> for I hate that which is a grief unto thee, and that because it grieves thee. Lord, <HI>I love thee,</HI> for I am grieved at thy absence, &amp; am rejoyced at thy presence: Lord, <HI>I love thee,</HI> for I love any that are like thee, that bear thy Image, and thy Stamp upon their hearts: O my Lord, <HI>I love thee,</HI> for I love the place and duties where thou wert wont to

warm thy peoples hearts; but if thou bees<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not there, I cannot take up contentedly with them, except I see thee. Lord, I do humbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say, <HI>I love thee,</HI> for I dare not deny but that I am grieved when thou art dishonoured by my self or others; though I grieve for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> less then I should, because I love thee less than I ought. Lord, <HI>I love thee,</HI> for I desire to have an heart that should be willing to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with all for thee; things sinful in themselves at all times, and things lawful when thou cal∣lest me to it. Once more, I humbly say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>love thee,</HI> for <HI>I</HI> would have an heart to love▪ and long, and look for thy coming and ap∣pearance in thy Glory: Come away then, O my Love, (saith Christ unto thee) and com∣memorate the Death of thy Lord whom th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dost love. O my Soul! thy Lord doth ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thee, arise and go unto his Table, where thou shalt see how he hath loved thee, and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou mightest have thy love to him more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣creased and inflamed. Thus thou shouldest enquire concerning thy love to Christ, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thou art to go unto this Feast of Love.</P>
<P>Quest. 4. <HI>Do I believe on Jesus Christ, or do I not? Have I the Faith of Gods Elect? or have I not?</HI> If <HI>I</HI> should not eat in Faith, and drink in Faith, <HI>I</HI> should not receive aright; but if <HI>I</HI> do believe, though my Faith be weak, <HI>I</HI> have a right to him, and to his priviledges which he hath purchased by his death, and will seal unto me in the Sacrament. Then turn thy Speech to God, and say, <HI>Lord, If I do prize

<P>Quest. 5. Once more enquire of thy self, and say, <HI>Have I repented of my Sins that I have committed against the Lord, and am</HI> I <HI>truly humbled for the same</HI>? For how shall I behold my Saviour broken for my sins, if my heart was never broken for my sins? Though I do come short of that degree of brokenness of heart for sin, as some of God's People have attained unto, yet have I that repentance which will prove repentance unto life? Though my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears are not so many as my sins, nor my sor∣row as great as my transgressions, yet have I so much sight and sense of sin, as makes me loath my self, and abhor my sins, and willing to forsake them; and separates me from the love of them, &amp; delight in them: Oh my Conscience, canst thou not bear me witness, that it is the breaking of my heart that
<PB N="90" REF="000909_0091_0FACA1912301AF68"/>
I have broken Gods Commands; that my mourning proceeds from love, and a sense of Gods kindness and his goodness to me; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is my unfeigned desire to be washed from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> filth, as well as delivered from the guilt of sin▪ to be freed from the power and dominion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well as from the punishment and damnation that is due unto me for my sins; that though I did not know but Hell might be my porti∣on, yet I would not sin against the Lord▪ Canst thou not bear me witness, that I do endeavour (though I come short in my en∣deavours) to keep my self unspotted from the World▪ and that I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Garments spotted with the flesh? That sin in the <HI>Temptation</HI> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, is grievous to me, as well as after the <HI>Com∣mission</HI> of it: that I do groan (though not so much as I should) under this body of sin longing for the time when I shall be delivered from it; crying out in the bitterness of my Soul, Lord; when shall it be? Lord, when shall it be, that I shall be perfectly freed from this loathsome body of sin, which (through thy Grace) is so offensive to my Soul? if so, then I will arise, and approach unto this Or∣dinance, where <HI>I</HI> may be assured of my par∣don, and be furnished with further Strength and Power against my Sin. Thus thou shoul∣dest enquire, whether thou hast repented of thy sin, when thou art to go and see what hath been done unto thy Lord, by reason o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy Sins▪ Thus far for Tryal.</P>
<P>Secondly, When thou hast thus proceeded
<PB N="91" REF="000909_0092_0FACA191E6F1BA00"/>
to find out the truth of thy grace, then next go on to solemn meditation, <HI>to consider of those things which might excite and stir up thy graces, the truth of which thou findest to be already wrought in thy heart</HI>; that so thou mightest go unto this Ordinance with lively exercise of grace, that all thy graces might be ready to act according to thy duty in this work: For it will be thy <HI>Sin</HI> to go unto the Ta∣ble of the Lord with dull affections, and deadness upon thy heart; and it is an <HI>aggra∣vation</HI> of thy sin, if it be through want of diligent endeavour to get thy Soul affected and inflamed with love before thou goest. Now for thy help therein, I shall instance in some of those things which will be fit and suitable objects for thy thoughts before thou goest, and not unseasonable to meditate upon while thou art there.</P>
<P>First, Meditate and dwell in thy thoughts upon <HI>the Love of God in the great work of Mans Redemption.</HI> Consider that thou wast in a fallen and miserable estate, under the Curse of the Law, liable to the wrath of God, the Torments of Hell; under the pow∣er of thy lusts, and the bondage of the Devil; and couldst not help thy self, nor recover thy self to the Happiness from which thou didst fall: then get thy heart affected with the Love of God, who in the eternal project of his Councel, hath contrived a way for thy Salvation: And here, if thy heart be not yet affected.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="92" REF="000909_0093_0FACA192A38BFDA8"/>1.

Let all this then awaken thee to sorrow and repentance, before thou goest to the Table of the Lord.</P>

Remember not my sins against thee, but remember what thy Son hath done and sufferd for me; thou commandest me in the Sacrament to remember what thy Son hath suffered that I may be thankful unto thee; do thou remember what thy Son hath suffered, &amp; be thou gracious unto me: that I might see thy smiles, and perceive thy love, when I am there; that I might come from thence with my pardon sealed, my sins subdued, my Soul stren∣gthned to run the ways of thy Commandments, till thou shalt come and take me to thy self, where

<P>Fourthly, Next I would advise thee (i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou hast opportunity) <HI>to discourse with others of such things that may tend to raise, and not to damp thy heart.</HI> When thou hast been ta∣king pains with thy self in secret; when thou comest from thy Chamber, take heed with whom thou dost Converse, and what thou sayest: For if in secret thou didst find thy love excited, thy desires enlarged, thy faith fastning upon Christ; frothy and unseasonable discourse before thou goest, might damp all again: or if in secret thy heart were dull, yet God might bless a word or two in holy dis∣course for the quickning of thy heart, and ras∣sing of thy affections towards him: when thou s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttest at thy Table, or by the fire the Night before the Sacrament, by speaking <HI>of the wonderful grace of God, the Death of Christ, of the benefits thereby, of hope of Heaven, of the coming of the Lord, of the glory there is above, of the Sabbath the redeemed of the Lord shall keep above in the Kingdom of their Father</HI>▪ When the two Disciples were discoursing of Christs Death and Sufferings, Christ came and joyned himself unto them, <HI>Luk</HI> 24▪13, 14, 15.

And this brings me to the next Conclusion, to answer to this Case or Question.</P>
<P>Under what <HI>Consideration</HI> should a believer eye the blood of Christ in the Lords Supper, and have his Graces drawn forth into act, when he doth so consider it?</P>

<P>This Conclusion consists of Two Parts.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="000909_0105_0FACA10663B4B388"/>First, <HI>That a Believer should eye the Blood of Christ in the several properties thereof, in its efficacy and vertue.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That this eying of the Blood of Christ must draw forth those suitable Graces that are to be exercised in the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P>For your help in the first of these, I would advise you to eye the Blood of Christ in these properties, which also set forth the vertue and efficacy thereof.</P>
<P N="1">1. Eye the Blood of Christ in the Sacra∣ment as it is a <HI>precious Blood,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19 <HI>We were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the precious Blood of Christ,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P N="2">2. Eye the Blood of Christ in the Sa∣crament, as it is <HI>satisfying blood</HI>: And this it is because it was such precious blood; it was most precious blood, therefore it was blood of value and merit: The Law of God was transgressed, the Covenant of Works by us was violated, the Justice of God was wronged, and the Sinner was indebted unto Justice, and did owe the suffering of the penalty due for the breach of the Law; which was all mise∣ries in this life, death it self, and the torments of Hell for ever.

<P>Fifthly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sa∣crament, as <HI>justifying blood</HI>; as that which makes you righteous in the sight of God, tho you have no Righteousness of your own in which you may dare to sit before God at his Ta∣ble, or stand before him at his Tribunal. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.9. <HI>Much more then being justified by

<P>Six<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hly, Eye the blood of Christ in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sacrament as <HI>pardoning blood,</HI> as that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which you have the <HI>full,</HI> and <HI>free,</HI> and <HI>ever∣lasting</HI> pardon of all your Sins If Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had never died, you never had been pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>doned; for without <HI>the shedding of bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> there is no remission,</HI> Heb▪ 9 22.

<P>Tenthly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as <HI>heart softning blood</HI>; as that which can dissolve the most stony heart, as that which can break the hardest Sinner. This blood on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> applied to those that were so hard

<P>Eleventhly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as <HI>sin mortifying blood▪</HI> it is indeed <HI>soul saving blood,</HI> but it is <HI>sin killing blood</HI>; and therefore it saves your Soul, because it kills your Sin: As that Physick saves a mans life which removeth his Sickness: That which is life to your Soul, is death to your Sin. In the Sacrament you must look upon your sin, as that which was the death of your Lord, and look upon your Lord as one that is the death of your sin: Sin drew out the life-blood of Christ, and the blood of Christ shed, will draw out the life-blood of Sin: Here you may behold these two great Combatan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>both fighting, both bleeding, both dying,</HI> and they are reciprocal causes of each others death: Christ he bleeds, and sin it bleeds: Christ dies, and sin dies: But Christ gets the Victory, for Christ dieth, and rises again, and lives for e∣vermore; but sin once dead, liveth never more.</P>
<P>Oh! come cast your sins, those cursed <HI>Ae∣gyptians,</HI>

into the Red Sea of Christs blood; and they shall be drowned to death, and never live to reign over you more; your Soul shall be safe by passing thorough this Red Sea, but your sins shall fall and die therein.

<P>Thirteenthly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as a <HI>blood of sprinkling,</HI> as a blood <HI>applicable,</HI> and to be actually applied to your soul; that you may say, Here is blood, and <HI>it is mine</HI>; Here is blood shed, and it was <HI>for me</HI>; Here is blood to be sprinkled, and <HI>I</HI> hope one drop will fall upon my Soul. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.24. <HI>Ye are come to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of sprink∣ling,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.2. <HI>Elect according to the fore∣knowledg of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</HI> Heb 9.19.

it will be sprinkled on your Conscience at the Sacrament: It is not the blood of Christ pou∣red out that will save you, but the blood of Christ sprinkled on your heart, will.</P>
<P>Fourteenthly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as <HI>Satan conquering blood</HI> The Devil put it into <HI>Judas</HI>'s heart to betray Christ, and into the Jews heart to murder Christ; but by his Death and Blood shed he overcame the Devil; and when he was bleeding to death, he triumphed over all infernal fiends: <HI>Col</HI> 2 15 <HI>And having spoiled all Principalities and Powers, he made a shew of them openly, tri∣umphing over them in it.</HI> And by this blood of Christ shall you be enabled to overcome the Devil: <HI>Rev</HI> 12.10, 11. <HI>The Accuser of the brethren is cast down, which accused them before God, day and night, and they overcame him by the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of the Lamb.</HI></P>
<P>Fifteenthly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as <HI>sealing blood</HI>; as that which was poured out, not only to purchase Heaven for you, but also to assure you of it. Christ's blood sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon the Cross, doth ratifie and confirm the Covenant of Grace: <HI>Heb</HI> 9 15. <HI>And for this cause he is the Mediator of the New-Testament, that by means of death, for the Redemption of the Transgressions that were under the first Testament, they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal Inheritance</HI>; ver. 16 <HI>For where a Testament i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, there must also of necessity be the death of the Testator:</HI> ver 17. <HI>For a Testament is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> after men are dead.</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="000909_0116_0FACA10F642520C8"/>
So then when you see Christ's blood shed, remember God hath promised Believers par∣don and eternal life, and this promise is of force. Christ hath bequeathed precious Lega∣cies to his people, and his Will and Testa∣ment is of force, for his blood is shed.</P>
<P>Sixteenthly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as <HI>an innocent blood</HI>; Consider there, it was the just that suffered for the un∣just; in his hands there was no wickedness, in his heart no Sin, in his mouth no guile. The innocent bleeds for the nocent, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.4. <HI>I have betrayed the innocent blood</HI>; and will it not affect you to see innocent blood thus shed.</P>
<P>Seventeenthly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as a <HI>copious Blood</HI>; as being sufficient for you and all the Elect of God: As sufficient for <HI>you,</HI> as if none had been sa∣ved, justified thereby, but your self: There is fulness of merit in it, it is a Fountain, <HI>Zech</HI> 13.1. <HI>In that day there shall be a Fountain opened.</HI> Now a Fountain is,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Living</HI> water, and the blood of Christ is living blood.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is <HI>running water,</HI> it is communicative, it overflows, it feeds the little rivol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts; and the channels in which the blood of Christ doth run, are the hearts of Gods El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is <HI>plentiful</HI> water; there is but little in a Cistern, but abundance in the Fountain.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is <HI>inexhaustible,</HI> and <HI>perpetual</HI>: it o∣verflows, and yet it ever flows. Such is the
<PB N="116" REF="000909_0117_0FACA11105D992E8"/>
blood of Christ; Christ hath not expended all the vertue of his blood upon <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and the Saints that are alrea∣dy got to glory; but there is enough for you, it is a copious blood, if you consider the real quantity of blood which Christ at six se∣veral times did shed. Six times Christ bled for you.</P>
<P N="1">1. In his Circumcision. 2. In the Gar∣den. 3. When he was Scourged. 4. When he was Crowned with Thorns. 5. When his hands and feet were nailed to the Cross. 6. When his side was pierced with a Spear. Thus if you consider the real quantity of his natural blood, it was much; but if you con∣sider the supernatural efficacy and vertue of it, it was infinite.</P>
<P>Eighteenthly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as <HI>perfecting blood:</HI> It was the fruit of Blood that you have any Grace, and it is the fruit of his Blood that your Grace is growing and increasing Grace. You c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣plain your Grace is small, your Love is little unto God, your Faith is weak, and your de∣sires feeble, and faint after Christ, but Christ's blood shall make you perfect. Christ will so moisten your Grace by laying his blood often at the root thereof, that it shall grow, and you shall go from grace to grace, till you come from grace to glory: <HI>Heb</HI> 13 20▪ 21. <HI>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, that great she∣pherd of his sheep, through the blood of the Ever∣lasting

Covenant, make you perfect in every good work, to do his will,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nineteenthly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as <HI>cementing blood</HI>; as that which soders the hearts and affections of Gods people one to another: We are all made to drink of one Blood, which should provoke us to be of one Heart. As Christ shed his blood, and thereby manifested, that be loved all his People; so when we par∣take of it in the Sacrament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we are engaged to love one another as he hath loved us, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.13. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2 13.14, 15, 16.</P>
<P>Twentyethly, Eye the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, as <HI>such blood, that maketh all you do, to be pleasing unto God.</HI> Your best doings would be provocations unto God, had it not been for Christ's dying: If Christ had not dyed, your very praying would have been provoking of God; it is the sufferings and the blood of Christ, that maketh all your religious duties to be acceptable unto God. This is the sweet Incense, which he offers with the Prayers of Saints, <HI>Rev.</HI> 8.3. Through the blood of the everlasting Covenant, is that wrought <HI>in</HI> you, and <HI>by</HI> you, which is plea∣sing in the sight of God; and indeed in this respect you should eye the vertue and efficacy of the blood of Christ in every Duty; your tears are but <HI>puddle water,</HI> and your righteousness but <HI>raggs</HI> without this blood of Christ</P>

<P>Alas, O Lord, my sins are very strong and powerful within me, that sometimes I think they do not only rage but reign, sometime they act so mightily in my heart, that I am apt to think there is nothing but sin in my Soul, and no principle of Grace to check and to control it: My pride is strong, my passion is strong, and my lusts exceeding mighty;

but is not here sin mortifying blood, that can take down the strength and power of it? this blood hath subdued i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in others, and now I will believe it will subdue it in my Soul?</P>
<P>Oh, my Lord, my heart is often dead and dull, that I cannot pray with life unto thee, that I cannot be lively in thy Service; sain I would, but lo my heart is dead, and cannot: But is not here quickning and enlivening blood? why then wilt thou suffer such a heart to be in me?

<P>Thus you may in respect of God, by Faith, make use of all the Properties of the blood of Christ, you may go on in all the rest. Let it suffice that I have shewed you how Faith may be set on work in the former particulars.</P>
<P>Secondly, When you thus consider the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, <HI>set Faith on work to reply unto the Devil.</HI> He will be with you at the Sacrament, to rob you of the com∣fort, and hinder you from that joy that there you might be filled with; but by faith in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood of Christ you may resist him. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hatsoever his Accusations are, from some of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese properties of the blood of Christ, you may put the Devil unto silence.</P>
<P>Doth the Devil cast your sins in your teeth, and rank them in order before your eyes

It may be he will tell thee of thy dulness in thy holy Duties: Thou mayst reply, I did indeed to the grief and burthen of my Soul, find too much deadness upon my heart; and therefore I have brought it to the quick∣ning blood of my dearest Lord, and he will out life into me. What now, Oh mine E∣nemy! Indeed there is nothing that Satan can charge upon you, or bring against you, but from one of these properties of the blood of Christ, you may put him to the worst.

You may go on in any of the rest, as you have occasion to make use of them</P>
<P>Thirdly, When you thus consider the blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, you may <HI>set Faith on work, in apply∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g it to your self</HI>; and stopping the mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of our own Conscience, clamouring against you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lords Table, or else rightly and justly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccusing of you: For Conscience may know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore evil by you than the Devil can, <HI>viz.</HI> ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y vain thoughts and inward sinful workings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your heart: But you may use some of these Excellencies of the blood of Christ, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds sufficient to quiet and to allay it; after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is manner, <HI>Thou tellest me, Oh my Conscience, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such blasphemous vain, distracting thoughts!</HI></P>

<P>Let Faith make particular application of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in all its Vertues &amp; Efficacies, &amp; say, <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Oh my Soul!

Or will you ever do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with delight? <HI>Oh, hadst thou any Love unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord, Oh my Soul! thou couldst not then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hate thy Sin. Oh now my Soul! be wrought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a heightned resolution, with greatest indignati∣on and abhorrence to cast away thy Sins.

hate my sins, and the more I taste of the sweetness of the blood of Christ, the more thou wilt cause my Soul to hate my Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have given you my thoughts for your satisfaction in this question. How you should consider the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, and have your graces exer∣cised when you so consider it?</P>

Had I any warmth of aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction in it?

This you should do after every prayer you make, after every Sermon you
<PB N="132" REF="000909_0133_0FACA137241DAAA0"/>
hear, at the end of every Sabbath, and af∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> every Sacrament you receive. For wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of this reflection, these evils follow.</P>
<P>First, For want of this, many <HI>think they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> better, when indeed they be the worse.</HI> For want of strict and narrow Examination <HI>before</HI> the Sacrament, they think they have faith in Christ, love to God, and repentance for their sins; but what they had was but a Counterfeit of Faith and Love, and other Graces, as Hy∣pocrites may have: So for want of reflection <HI>after</HI> the Sacrament, they might think they had some workings of Faith, and Love, and sor∣row for Sin, and joy in God; and yet it was not so, but something like to these, as Hy∣pocrites might sometimes have in their atten∣dance upon God at his Table, and in hearing of the Word, and other Duties. Hypocrites might shed many tears at a Sacrament, and might have some flashes of Joy through a false apprehension that this Christ did dye for them, &amp; hath applied his blood unto them, and that they are partakers of the benefits of his Death, as Grace, Pardon, Hopes of Heaven, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &amp; yet shall be for ever damned for not having any of these in truth and in reality; and this mistake is very dangerous, and oftentimes per∣nicious: In as much as it doth strengthen the <HI>presumption</HI> of these mens hearts, when they do think their Faith is strengthened, and are more confirmed in their false hopes of Heaven and Eternal Life, and often go away rejoycing at the thoughts of their good Condition, and yet
<PB N="133" REF="000909_0134_0FACA137E1444FC8"/>
might lye for ever roaring amongst the Damned, for their folly and mistake; and might bless God for that which they thought they received from him at the Sacrament, and yet might be for ever cast from God, because they had not that Grace which they thought they felt working in their hearts therein; therefore After-examination is ne∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssary.</P>
<P>Secondly, For want of Examination after the Sacrament, <HI>you will be kept from After-humiliation, and Repentance for your sins com∣mitted at the Table of the Lord.</HI> If you did review and look back upon the frame of your heart, and find you have miscarried in your work and management of your Du∣ty, you should see what cause you have of lying low before the Lord for so great a Sin, as to get no good by such an Ordi∣nance, that tends so much to promote the work of Grace in the hearts of them that come worthily to the same. Your Heart, when the Minister broke the Bread, was not brok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n for your Sin; When you tool the bread, your heart was dull and dead, and did not reach forth the hand of Faith, to lay hold upon Christ and his Be∣nefits, and apply them to your self, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o did play the Hypocrite before God &amp; your fellow Communicants: When the Wine was poured forth, and you saw how Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist did shed his blood for sinners, you could not drop a Tear for your sins that caused
<PB N="134" REF="000909_0135_0FACA138A1124348"/>
it; or if you did, it was not from a heart sensible of your Sin, or of Gods love unto your Soul; when you took the Cup and drank thereof, you did not remember Christ as you should have done: And, while you were present at this Table, your mind wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> filled with distracting Thoughts, and you thoughts were wandring when they should have been fixed on God and Christ: And how shall you be humbled for this, if you do not reflect that you are guilty of suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sins? And how shall you confess this before the Lord upon your Knees, when you d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not afterwards consider how it was with you at that time? And how great a Sin is this, and how bad is your heart, neither to be affected at the Table of the Lord, not to be afflicted in your Soul after you are gone, that it was not so with you! This was your Sin, while you were there tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you got no good thereby: and this is also your Sin, that you do not bewail it when you come away? Whereas it should be lament∣ed from one Sacrament to another, that your heart was indeed so bad and out of frame, when it should have been Delighting in God, and Loving of God, and Sorrow∣ing for your Sin.</P>
<P>Thirdly, For want of Examination after the Sacrament, <HI>you might receive good and not perceive it, nay, perhaps deny it.</HI> As many have Grace, and yet think they have none; so many here might receive good, and yet
<PB N="135" REF="000909_0136_0FACA139628B23C0"/>
think it is not so: Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u go away and soon forget the workings of God up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n your heart, and the workings of your heart towards God; and so are tempted to believe it was no other∣wise with you, than it may be wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>po∣crites in this Ordinance: And because you do not seriously consider, and faithfully keep in your remembrance the experience you had from God, while you were there, you yield to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is temptation when you are come away.</P>
<P>Fourthly, For want of refl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction after the Sacrament, <HI>you are not so thankful after the duty is done, for what you did receive, as else you would be.</HI> Many Hypocrites go away and rejoyce when they should mourn; and many gracious Souls go away and mourn, when they should rejoyce; and <HI>both</HI> because they do not after∣wards refl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct upon the inward working of their hearts, to judge of them according to what indeed they were, God did come into your heart and humble i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; God did come into your heart and break it; God did come into your heart, and caused it to abhor your Sin, and to long after Christ, which you should re∣member while you live, to adore the riches of his Grace, that he should look upon such Sin and Dust as you are, and cause you to feel such operations of his Spirit, that every time you go into secret, you should give him thanks for these his workings upon your heart: But how shall this be done, if you do not often reflect how it was with you, when you were there?</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="000909_0137_0FACA13A217406A0"/>Fifthly, For want of reflection after the Sacrament, <HI>you will oftentimes take up with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are performance of the duty, and rest in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> work done</HI>; and rest satisfied that you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and drunk at the Table of the Lord; though you have not eaten the flesh of Christ, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drunk his blood: and it is too great a sign that you rest in the work done, when you do not consider afterwards how you have done it, not enquire, Did I please the Lord while I was eating? Did I please the Lord while I was drinking at his Table? Did I eat in Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, and drink in Faith? Did I find God coming down into my Soul by his Grace and Spirit, and my Soul ascending up to God by Faith and Love?</P>
<P>Sixthly, For want of this refl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction after the Sacrament, <HI>you will not be so earnestly desirous after renewed opportunities of Receiving, nor have such longings in your Soul to come again.</HI> One would think that the entertainment which God gives unto his People at his Table, the smiles that there they see in his Face, the love that there they perceive to be in his Heart, and the favours there they receive from his Hands, should stir up in their hearts such ear∣nest breathings as these. Oh when might I come again! Oh when shall I be thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again! Christ was exceeding sweet unto my Soul, his Comforts were delightful to my heart; Oh when shall I return again unto this Table, that I might have more of that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a day I found! But if this be so much
<PB N="137" REF="000909_0138_0FACA13AE2A75E50"/>
out of your thoughts, the other will be too much out of your desires.</P>
<P>Seventhly, For want of this reflection after the Sacrament, <HI>you will be less experienced, and less acquainted with the workings of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own hearts.</HI> If you r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>flect upon what your heart did promise when you were there, and how you have come short of your promise, how your heart did work in hatred unto sin, and how afterwards (if it be not strictly watched) it will be ready to consent and yield unto it: if you thus compare your self, what you are at the Sacrament, and what your heart would be if not heedfully observed afterwards, you would be more acquainted with the deceitfulness of your own heart.</P>
<P>Eighthly, For want of this reflection after the Sacrament, <HI>you will be fuller of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubts, and more empty of comforts, than else you would be.</HI> Sometimes God did so powerfully work upon your heart when you were at his Table, in drawing forth your love to him, your hatred to, and sorrow for your sins, that you could not deny that you had grace: But at another time you might lose the sense of this, when it might not be so with you, and then the De∣vil doth assault you, to perswade you that you have no grac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, because now you do not feel the workings of it; but if you would reflect how it was with you such a time at the Sacra∣ment, you might repel this temptation: Tho' I do not now find the lively workings of my love to God, yet <HI>at such a time</HI> in the Sacra∣ment
<PB N="138" REF="000909_0139_0FACA13C638CBD10"/>
I did; though <HI>now</HI> I do not find my heart to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, but is dull and ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rame, yet <HI>such a day</HI> in the Sacrament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I found my sins my burthen, and the brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing of my heart: Then I did feel my heart to burn in love to God and Christ; and this will help to resolve your present doubts, and to expel your present fears, and to resist his temptation of the Devil: But if you do not refl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct, you might lose so good an evidence of the truth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your grace.</P>
<P>Ninthly, For want of this Reflection after the Sacrament, <HI>you will be a grief to the Spirit of God,</HI> whether you did meet with God or no; whether it was well or ill with you when you were there; <HI>If you did meet with God,</HI> and if he did comfort your heart, or humble you for sin, and do not reflect, you grieve the Spirit of God, that he was so kind and loving unto you, and you so soon forget it, to be thankful for it; <HI>If you did not meet with God,</HI> and do not reflect, you grieve the Spirit, that though he absented himself from your Soul, you do soon forget it to be hum∣bled for it.</P>
<P>Tenthly, It argues your end <HI>was not so right as it should have been</HI>; had you aimed indeed at Communion with God, and encrease of Grace, would you not enqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e whether you had attained your end?</P>
<P>Eleventhly, It argues <HI>great carelessness of heart,</HI> and too great a slighting of the benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Sacrament; did you esteem them, you
<PB N="139" REF="000909_0140_0FACA13C781C7C98"/>
would enquire whether you had enjoyed them.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, It argues <HI>you are not so wise for your Soul, as you are for your Body</HI>; not so wise for the things of Heaven, as for the things of this world; for after you have been trading for the things of this Life, you will cast up your accounts to see what are your gains, and what is added to your stock.</P>
<P>Thirteenthly, This <HI>will provoke God in after-duties to withdraw from you,</HI> and to deny that to you in following Ordinances, which you would not so much as enquire whether you had got in former Duties.</P>
<P>Fourteenthly, <HI>You may decline in Grace, and be on the losing hand, and not easily and quickly perceive it,</HI> and fall into a frame of dulness be∣fore you are aware.</P>
<P>Therefore let it be your constant practice, as to examine your self before, that you may know your fitness for this Duty; so to examine your self afterwards, that you may know whe∣ther you are the <HI>better</HI> or the <HI>worse</HI> by this Du∣ty; for every one is made better or made worse by coming to the Lords Table. Phy∣sick makes the Body better or worse: All God's Ordinances will have their operation. The Word is a savour of life or death to eve∣ry one that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears it, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2 15, 16 So ma∣ny are the worse by coming to the Lords Table, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7 <HI>You c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me together not for the better but the worse:</HI> That you are not better, is <HI>satis culpabile,</HI> sufficiently blame worthy; but that you are the worse, this is

<HI>mali auxesis,</HI> the aggravation of your sin. <HI>Grande id nefas, quando medicina non modo non proficit aegro, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in venenum vertit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> It goe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ill with that man whose Food and Physick i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> turned into Poyson, &amp; proves to be his ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; not for his profit, but his detriment.</P>
<P>Here for your satisfaction, I shall enquire after these thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>What are the causes that some go to the Lords Table, and receive no benefit thereby?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>How may a Believer know when he doth re∣ceive benefit thereby?</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Containing the Reasons why some receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> benefit by the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reasons why some are not the better by going to the Lords Table, are such as these:</P>
<P>First, Because <HI>they are not habitually prepared for it</HI>; they have not those necessary qualifica∣tions, nor habitual graces that must be in that mans heart that shall be benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the Sa∣crament: they had no lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and therefore are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> capable of growth and nourishment. Growth of Grace supposeth truth of grace:
<PB N="141" REF="000909_0142_0FACA13DE1947368"/>
They that have not first received a <HI>whole</HI> Christ in the Gospel in all his Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, cannot receive a <HI>broken</HI> Christ in the Sacrament: They are not united unto Christ, and where there is no union, there can be no communi∣on; they are not ingrafted into Christ, and therefore they receive no fruit from the Cross of Christ. All the benefit that must come in by the Sacrament, must be by the exercise of grace, of faith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> love, and sorrow for sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but they that have it not, cannot ex∣ercise it.</P>
<P>Secondly, Because <HI>many that are habitually prepared, may be too slight in actual preparation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>▪ They did not seriously, throughly search their hearts and lives, nor enquire after their sins and wants; they do not solemnly, but slight∣ly pray to God before hand: They do not quicken their hungrings after Christ, nor go with great, believing expectations of receiving great things from God in this duty.</P>
<P>And God will check you at his Table, by withdrawing himself from you, for your neg∣lect before you came? It may be you were busie about the World, when you should have been preparing for your Duty: It may be you were in your Shop, when you should have been in your Chamber, or your Closet: It may be God saw you reading your Account book<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when you should have been reading the History of the Death of Christ in the Book of God, and should have been studying the Book of your own heart: God saw you think<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
<PB N="142" REF="000909_0143_0FACA13EA3AFA2A8"/>
of the World, when you should have been endeavouring to have warmed your<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heart in the believing thoughts of the Love of God, in the great transactions of Man's Re∣demption.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Because <HI>after diligent actual prepa∣ration, you have rested in your foregoing duties, and expected that for your preparations sake, which you must only receive for Christs sake.</HI> It is hard to make diligent preparations, and then deny them when we have done, and expect all through Christ, and after our most serious pre∣parations, to acknowledge them as nothing, and that it will be Free Grace if God discover himself unto us at his Table. Sometimes you may observe, that after greatest enlargements in secret preparation, you have been most strai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned in the duty; Not that God is displea∣sed with your diligence in preparation, but that you lay too great a stress upon your previ∣ous duties; and mounted them up above their place, and would have made a Christ of your duties, and would have de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acted from the merits of Christ, in hoping that from God, because you had prepared, which you must only hope for, because Christ hath dyed: Not but that you may and ought to look after your Prayers which you make, and see what re∣turns the Lord doth give you; but there is a diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rence between an expectation of good things from God <HI>according</HI> to your prayers and preparations; and between an expectation of good things from God <HI>for</HI> your prayers and
<PB N="143" REF="000909_0144_0FACA13F631DD288"/>
preparations; and yet you may disclaim this in word, and in your heart secretly too much rely upon them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Because <HI>God is offended that some sweet and secret sin is too much savoured</HI>▪ Though there might be no reigning sin in you which is inconsistent with the sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of grace, yet there might be too much conni∣vance and favour shewed to some particular Sins: The reason why God smiles no more upon your Soul at his Table, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be, be∣cause you frown no more upon your Sins. God shews no more mercy to you at his Table, because you shew no more severity against your sin; and must not God take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unkindly when you come to commemo∣rate the death of his Son with too much kindness in your heart to sin, that was the cause of his death?</P>
<P>Fifthly, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause <HI>you were too remiss; and let down your Spiritual Watch in the time of receiving</HI> You lost holy time at the ho∣ly Sacrament, by entertaining of, and be∣ing filled with vain distracting thoughts; when you are there you should be careful to do nothing else, and to think of nothing else, but what is pertinent to the duty you are engaged in; your own heart will be fre∣quently stragling if you do not keep it▪ &amp; the Devil will be injecting thoughts of things of another nature: or will fill your minds with thoughts of holy things, but not perti∣nent to your present work: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f you
<PB N="144" REF="000909_0145_0FACA14021A4F210"/>
would receive benefit by your receiving, you must say to Satan, as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> to <HI>Sanballat,</HI> when he would have diverted him from build∣ing of the Wall'<HI>Neh.</HI> 6.2, 3, 4 <HI>Sanballat</HI> sent to him saying; <HI>Come let us meet together in some one of the villages; but they thought to do me mischief. And I sent Messengers to him, say∣ing, I am doing a great work, so that I can∣not come down; Why should the work cease, while I leave it and come to you? Yet they sent unto me four times after that sort, and I answered them after the same manner.</HI> When you are receiving, the Devil would parley with you, but it is to do you mischief, therefore reply unto him, I am doing a great work, so that I have no time to en∣tertain thy suggestions O mine enemy! I have other things to think upon; here is the death of my Lord, and his love in dy∣ing for me, to think upon; and why should this work cease, while I entertain thy sug∣gestions? So far as your thoughts wander, so far your work at the Lords Table stands still. And if Satan solicit you four or more times, still answer after the same manner; be as constant in resisting, as he is in solici∣ting, and you will find benefit by the duty, if you ply your work when you are there.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Because <HI>you have not conscientiously endeavoured to live up to resolutions made in for∣mer receivings.</HI> Did you not there promise, if God would please to manifest himself unto you, and warm your heart, and pardon your
<PB N="145" REF="000909_0146_0FACA140E27C4710"/>
Sin, and speak peace unto your Soul, you would carefully avoid the like Transgressions<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That you would resist Satans Temptations, and be better in every relation, and fill up the duties that God requires at your hands? That you would pray more, and pray better; That you would take heed of after-passion, if God would pardon your former passion? And yet you have come short of all this, not only through unavoidable infirmity, but through carelessness and letting down your Spiritual Watch. When the Temptation hath assault∣ed you again, you have quietly yielded again, and God hath seen as much uncircumspection in your Conversation as before; and do you think the next time you do receive, that God will not make you go away without the com∣fort of this Ordinance, who deny to him the care of your conversation? If you would have God to do you good by his Ordinances, you must walk so holily, when one Ordinance is over, that you may meet with God in ano∣ther, or in the same at another time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XV. Shewing how we may know whether we get good by coming to the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P>THat you may know whether you receive benefit to your Soul by coming to the
<PB N="146" REF="000909_0147_0FACA141A0616208"/>
Lords Supper, you must be careful that you do not Mistake; To prevent which, let me pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mise.</P>
<P>First, Take heed that you do not conclude, <HI>you have no benefit at all because you have not so much as you perceive some other Christians to have</HI>: For Gods discoveries to his People are arbitrary and gradual, when he will, to whom he will, and in what measure he will.</P>
<P>Secondly, Take heed that you do not con∣clude, <HI>you have no benefit at all, if you have not so much as you hoped for, or expected</HI> You aimed at much, and found but little, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do not say it was altogether an emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ordinance to your Soul</P>
<P>Thirdly, Take heed that you do not con∣clude, <HI>you have no benefit at all, if you have it not in that particular and kind that you looked for</HI>: It may be you may aim at a great deal of comfort and joy when you w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt; and God may deny you that, and make you to sorrow and be broken more for your sins; this is spiritual benefit, though not in that way as you looked for it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Take heed you do not conclude the Sacrament <HI>doth you no good at all, if you do not sensibly perceive it in the very act of Receiv∣ing.</HI> or while you are actually under the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>di∣nance; To have no ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by it then, is ve∣ry sad and uncomfortable; but yet limit not the efficacy of the Ordinance only to the time of receiving, but observe how it works with you after it is past; it may be sometimes you

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mourn more, and rejoyce more after∣wards, than when you were at the Table. Now to resolve your doubt, consider, <HI>you do g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t real benefit by the Lords Supper.</HI></P>
<P>First, When you find <HI>your heart thereby moch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>trongly engaged to inward and universal holines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> When you feel your heart more obliged to walk with God with more circumspection &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re than you did before.</P>
<P>Secondly, When you find <HI>your Faith is more increased,</HI> you can rely upon Christ more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ducially than you could before; when you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, you did purpose to take Christ upon his own terms, but when you come away, your purpose is more setled, and you are more resolved in Christs way, to venture the ever∣lasting concernments of your Soul upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>Thirdly, When you find <HI>your love to Christ hereby to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more inflamed:</HI> You loved him truly before, but now you love him strongly; your Soul is sick while he is absent, but when he is with you, you are satisfied; he now dwelleth more in your thoughts than before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he did, a sign, you love him more than be∣fore you did.</P>
<P>Fourthly, When <HI>Commu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> with God in the Sacrament is obtained,</HI> and God gives you the meeting. The Ordinance then will cer∣tainly do you good, when you find your grace go forth in exercise towards God, and the Spirit of God breathing upon your Soul by the powerful influences thereof affecting of you.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="000909_0149_0FACA143208CBBB0"/>Fifthly, When <HI>your Spiritual delight and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in God and Christ is more raised:</HI> Before you did delight too much is the World, and in your Friends▪ and in your Riches, and less in C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rist; but now more in Christ, and less in these; When you think of God you can re∣joyce; when you speak of Christ, your Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> triumpheth in him.</P>
<P>Sixthly, When <HI>your Soul under the sight and sense of sin is more deeply humbled.</HI> If you have not joy in a Sacrament, yet if you have more ingenuous sorrow for your sin, God hath done you good thereby: If you do not come away with a rejo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cing hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, yet if you come away with a weeping eye, proceeding from a truly contrite Spirit, bless God for his mercy to you in that Ordinance.</P>
<P>Seventhly, When <HI>corruption and sin is more hated, and becomes more loathsome to your Soul</HI>▪ When the thoughts of sin are more loathsome to you than the <HI>actings</HI> of it formerly were▪ when you groan more under the weight and load of sin, and do set your self more resolved∣ly against it▪</P>
<P>Eighthly, When <HI>your desires after full enjoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment of God and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ist in glory are more enlarg∣ed:</HI> Here you feel the workings of his Spirit, that makes you long to behold his face in his glorious Kingdom, that the little taste you have of Gods manifested love unto your Soul makes you almost impatient till God shall take you to himself.</P>
<P>Ninthly, When <HI>your heart is more suspected,</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="000909_0150_0FACA143E0B35298"/>
and you wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with a greater Holy Jealousie, that you do not lose the end of your going; and that you have a holy fear, that you break not Covenant with God, when his vows are upon you.</P>
<P>Tenthly, When <HI>you set a high valuation and esteem upon this Ordinance, and prefer it before your necessary food,</HI> and find that your Soul de∣sires, you may come again for this very end, that you might meet with more of God ano∣ther time.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, When <HI>you are more strengthned and emboldened to undergo the loss of all things for Jesus sake:</HI> When you see how Christ hath suffered for you, even unto death, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow count not your very life too dear to lay down for Christ.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, When <HI>you come away truly thank∣ful for what you had, and truly sorrowful you had no more</HI>; If you come away sorrowful, thinking you have not met with Christ, that very sor∣row proves you did meet with Christ, else you had not sorrowed when you think you missed of him: By such things as these judge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Shewing how we are to Live after we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the Lords Supper.</HEAD>
<P>IF you did find no benifit, then do these three things▪</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="000909_0151_0FACA144A1A553B8"/>First, Examine <HI>what may be the cause</HI> why God with-held the benefit of the Ordinance from you: Why it was, it proved an empty duty unto you.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Greatly bewail this before the Lord,</HI> that through your own miscarriage, you should lose the great advantage that might have been received.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Labour to feel the benefit of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Repentance, and exercise of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon Christ, when the Duty is over</HI>; And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the efficacy of it.</P>
<P>If you have had good success, do likewise three things.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Give to God the Glory of it</HI>; take you the Comfort, give God the Glory.</P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>more good you get, the more frequent it</HI>: It is good to be often there where you meet with God.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Let your Conversation after the Sa∣crament witness the good that you receive in &amp; by the Sacrament</HI>: You say so, live so, that all may see it: An holy, suitable conversation, in liv∣ing up to Sacramental Obligations, will con∣vince your self and others▪ that there is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some real good, that you do get by attending upon God therein</P>
<P>But alas! how few do live as becometh those that have been at the Table of the Lord! If you did but listen to their discourse as soon as they are gone from this Ordinance, you should hear some talking presently of the World, or of something impertinent to what
<PB N="151" REF="000909_0152_0FACA14563515608"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey have been about: If you did but fol∣low them from the Lords Table to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn, what unsavoury words should you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear from them! How frothy and vain i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their discourse! And if you observe their actions, even upon the same day, and some∣times in the same hour that they have been eating and drinking at the Table of the Lord, you would perceive that they have presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly forgot where they have been, and what they have been doing, and the obli∣gations that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re was laid upon them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve better. You should see one drunk with passion, another filled with carnal mirth, a∣nother careless in the after duties of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abbath: trace them in their lives in the week following, and you shall see them as worldly, as vain, as negligent as others that never had been at such an Ordinance.</P>
<P>Therefore that I might be instrumental (and Oh that I may) to stir you up to live as becomes those that frequent the Lords Table, I shall speak to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se three things.</P>
<P>First. <HI>Why you should give all diligence in
endeavouring to live suitably to the obligations laid upon you at the Table of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>How you should live and walk after the Sacrament, that your Conversation might be suitable to your Sacramental Obligations.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>What are the Aggravations of this sin, in not living as becometh those that have been at the Table of the Lord</HI></P>
<P>First, It requires your utmost diligence to
<PB N="152" REF="000909_0153_0FACA1462230D2A8"/>
endeavour to live suitably to the Sacrament, if you consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That your priviledge is greater than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> priviledges of many others,</HI> whom God dot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not invite nor call (while such) to come un∣to his Table. God honours you above the wicked in the World, above the ungodly and prophane; and the greater your priviledge and dignity is, the greater should your dil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gence be in living up to after-duties, <HI>Meph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bosheth</HI> esteemed it a great dignity and favou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he should eat bread at King <HI>David</HI>'s Ta∣ble, 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 9 7, 8. And is it not a great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dignity to eat of the Bread of Life, at the Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble of the King of Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Devil will be assaulting you with new temptations, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you unto sin, after you have been at the Table of the Lord.</HI> If God ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h spoken peace unto your Conscience, the Devil will be endeavouring to break your peace; If you have got a pardon of your old sins, he will be tempting you again to the commission of new; and the greater discoveries you hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had of God, when you were there, the greater will his temptations be to draw you into sin, when you come from thence. When Christ was Baptized, and God had owned him, by a voice from Heaven, then he was tempted by the Devil, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.17. &amp; 4 1. And if the Devil will be diligent to tempt you after such a Duty, should not you be diligent to resist him? Or, if you be not, is it not likely you will do something that will be unbecoming
<PB N="153" REF="000909_0154_0FACA146E24F2460"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne that hath been at this Ordinance? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your self be Judge.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>You are to go again in the following <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto your worldly business and employments,</HI> and to trade in things below; and how soon will you lose the sense of Gods love, and the sweet delights your Soul was filled with, by dealing in the world, if you are not watchful?</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Your own heart is apt to grow cold and dull again, after you have been warmed and heated in the Sacrament</HI>; Therefore you must be dili∣gent after such a duty. The water that is heated by the fire still retains a principle that reduceth it to its former coldness, when it is removed from the fire; &amp; so doth your heart▪</P>
<P>Secondly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f you would walk and live as be∣cometh one that hath been at the Table of the Lord, you must,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Endeavour to live and walk as Christ did</HI> when he was here upon the Earth. When, you have been commemorating Christs death, you must come away purposing to imitate his life. For as Christ in his sufferings hath left us an example how we ought to suffer, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2 21. So Christ in his life hath left us an example how we ought to live, 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.6. Then you will walk suitably to that Or∣dinance, which is a Commemoration of Christs death, when you tread in his steps while he lived upon the Earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Walk and live as one that is redeemed by the Blood of Christ should live.</HI> In the Sacra∣ment you have seen the greatness of the price
<PB N="154" REF="000909_0155_0FACA147A25BEDD0"/>
that was paid for you to redeem you from the Torments of Hell, from the Wrath of God, the Curse of the Law, the Power of Sin: Here it is, you see you are redeemed and bought, and therefore you are no longer your own, but his that died for you: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>And ye are not your own</HI>; ver. 20. <HI>For ye are bought with a price; therefore glorifie God, in your B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy, and in your Spirit, which are God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</HI> Oh how should a man redeemed from eternal torments walk and live?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and Live as one that hath been sealed up to the day of Redemption should live.</HI> In the Sacrament you do not only see that you are redeemed, but also that you are sealed unto the day of Redemption: You are assured of Heaven and eternal Life, and Oh how should a person that in the Sacrament hath had the Seal of the Covenant of grace assuring him of Life and Glory, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and live!</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and live as one to whom the Lord hath spoken peace should live.</HI> In the Lords Supper God hath told you, he is reconciled unto you; he hath said unto you, My Son, My Daughter, <HI>be of good chear, thy Sins be forgiven thee:</HI> Then go and live as one pardo∣ned by the Lord should live.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and live as one that hath renewed his Covenant with God should live.</HI> Be as strict a∣gainst sin after the Sacrament, as you did purpose when you were there. God hath a∣vouched himself to be your God, and you have avouched your self to be the Lords, then live accordingly.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="155" REF="000909_0156_0FACA148604EC080"/>1. <HI>Walk and live as one that hath seen such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at a Sacrament as you have seen.</HI> Here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou have seen the dreadful wrath of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst sin, the severity and the strictness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Justice against Sin: Here you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en the evil of Sin, and the deserts thereof; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere you have seen what a precious thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Soul of man is, by the price that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid for it: Here you have seen the love of God and Christ to poor Sinners; then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve with that fear of Sin, with that care of your immortal precious Soul, with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>gence to please and love God, as one that hath such sigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> should do.</P>
<P>But more particularly:</P>
<P N="1">1. After you have been at the Table of the Lord, <HI>you must make Conscience of ab∣staining from those sins that there you did be∣wail,</HI> that there you sorrowed for: To weep for sin at the Sacrament, and to indulge it when you come awa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, is great Hypocrisie. Will you (while there) seem to be griev∣ed for your si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and yet afterwards be un∣willing to forsake it? Did you resolve a∣gainst it, or did you not? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you did not, the Lord forgive you, your sin is great, &amp; your love to sin was great, when you would not so much as purpose to leave your sin, nor resolve against it; no, not when you saw what Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red for sin; if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou did, then do as you did purpose, and resolve: Especially watch most against that sin that you have often<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st found prevailing
<PB N="156" REF="000909_0157_0FACA14922865930"/>
against you, that your heart is most read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to yield unto, and your Conscience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most reproach you for when you were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Table of the Lord. Your endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must be against all sin, but chiefly agains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your chiefest sin. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never smile upon your sin which you see hath put to death you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord the Prince of Life!</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>After you have been at the Sacrament be conscientious in discharging of other Duties which this Ordinance doth engage you to</HI> Yiel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Obedience to the Commands of God, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he hath given you to be the Rule of yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Life: This was your du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y before, but no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is another bond to tye you to it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is a <HI>superadded</HI> obligation laid upon you so to do; and your neglect and diso∣bedience will be more hainous if you do not.</P>
<P>First, Be more frequent, and more fer∣vent in <HI>your secret Addresses unto God.</HI> Be∣sides your worshipping of God in your Fa∣mily (which some that come to the Table of the Lord, do shamefully neglect) be much with God alone. Oh how should you love and delight to have Communion with God in secret, when no Eye doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you but the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of God, whom you hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seen in the Sacrament, hath given his So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to you and for you!</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Labour after growth in Grace</HI>: This should have been in your desires be∣fore you went, and it should be your endea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vour
<PB N="157" REF="000909_0158_0FACA149E1824AF8"/>
when you come from thence to have more love to God than you had before, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have stronger Faith in Christ than you had before, to have more delight in God and Christ, and more ardent desire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than you had before</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Be more resolved to suffer, and to dye for Christ, than you were before.</HI> At the Lords Table you have seen what Christ hath done and suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red for you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you thereby more resolved not only to do, but to suffer also for his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke: Be not only mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e eminent in your active, but more patient in your passive Obedience than before.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Live in love with all that are par∣takers of the same benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with you.</HI> Yea, in this Ordinance you have an example of lov∣ing your very Enemies, as Christ did when he died for you; but a more special and pecu∣liar love you are taught to have to all the Members of Christ's Mystical Body, when you see in this Ordinance, how Christ hath loved them all, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.2 <HI>Walk in love, as Christ al∣so hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Be not so afraid to dye, after you have seen the Death of Christ in the Sacrament represented to you.</HI> Christ hath conquered this Enemy, he hath made Death your Friend to open the door to you, that you may go and live with him who hath died for you.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If you do not live as becomes one
<PB N="158" REF="000909_0159_0FACA14AA2BA1B30"/>
that hath been at the Table of the Lord, con∣sider the greatness of your Sin in these aggra∣vations of it. If you live a loose and carnal life, after you have partaken of this Ordinance.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>You break Covenant with God,</HI> and those promises which you made to him of better o∣bedience: you did again resign your self to be the Lords; If you did not, that was your sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if you did, and do not answer it in your life, this is your sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>You dishonour Christ,</HI> if you live not sui∣tably to this Ordinance; You profess your self to be one of his Disciples, else what did you there? If you be, and do not live accor∣dingly, you dishonour him whom you there have seen so much vilified and reproached by others for you, and yet shall he be reproach∣ed by others, by reason of you.</P>

for the hardness of your heart, or do you not; if you do not, why then do you com∣plain? if you do, your hardness is not the hardness that there is in Reprobates, but such as may be, and is, in the People of God: and this Sacrament is a means to have it softned.</P>

<P>Sense of Sin, and of Gods dishonour, a judging of your self for sin, and unfeign∣ed turning from sin, earnest Prayers for softning grace, a rolling your self upon Christ, tenderness of Conscience, an holy fear of sinning against God; holy care to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ease him, teachableness of heart and holy restlessness till you have Christ, do distinguish your hardness from the hardness of heart in a wicked man.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Imitate those that mourn most for sin; but you conclude not right, that you mourn not <HI>truly,</HI> nor at all, because you mourn no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>gradually,</HI> or as much as others do. The word of God and not the attainments of others, must be the Rule by which you ought to judge of the truth of your mour∣ning for Sin. Besides, if you do not mourn directly, you mourn reflexively; you mourn that you cannot mourn, and you pray that you may mourn. Besides, it is not your tears that can justifie you in the sight of God; for if you could mourn more than any, yet you must be justified freely by the blood of Christ; and so you will when you mourn truly, though less than some others do.</P>

<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may quicken your heart to mourn for sin, from the Torments of Hell, that it hath deserved; but that this is not the princi∣pal ground of your mourning, appears, be∣cause you can mourn and grieve for other mens sins as well as for your own, and when you have no thoughts of Hell, and when you have greatest perswasions of Gods mercy to you, in saving you from wrath to come, you mourn most; and that you mourn as well for the power and filth of sin, as for your misery thereby, and are willing to accept of Christ for your Lord▪ as well as for your Saviour.</P>

<P><HI>Indeed.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>For you could not be willing, if Christ had not first been willing: And it is the into∣lerable pride of your heart, to think that you can be more willing to be, and receive good, than God and Christ is to give and make you good. Besides, then such a one may come &amp; plead at the last day, Lord, I am not damned because I was not willing to accept of Christ, but because thou wouldest not give Christ to me, when I was willing to receive him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Truly I think there shall be no such plea at the day of judgment.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then your condition is good, if you be willing; for if you be willing to receive Christ, and God be willing to give him unto you, you have him, and yet will you not go to commemorate his death?</P>

<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>O Lord what strange conviction is this! surely I had Christ and did not know it: I was happy, and did not perceive it.

<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I do discern you will not suspect, that you your self are not willing, rather than that God is not will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, and so you have more reason to do; but though your heart be so deceitful, that you cannot understand all the particular sinful actings of your heart, yet by serious search, and Prayer unto God, you may know what it is that you do love, desire, and

<P>An holy self-love you ought to have, and that is not inconsistent with predominant love to the person of Christ.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But if</HI> I <HI>had been willing to accept of Christ, to take down the power of sin, it would not have been so strong as yet it is, and the power of sin makes me question the truth of grace.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they have power over your thoughts is your sin, but that they have not such power over your will, that proves your grace, for you would remove them when you cannot: And whether they be injected by the Devil, or do arise from your own heart, if grieved for, groaned under, and striven against, it is no otherwise with you, than with many others of God's dearest Children.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>The day of grace is not past with him that would fain have grace above all earthly riches, nor is the door of mercy shut against him that doth set open the door of his heart for Christ the King of Glory to enter in; &amp; doth importunately pray for the fruits of the Spirit.</P>

<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But alas!</HI> I <HI>cannot pray, how then should</HI> I <HI>receive</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though you cannot <HI>word</HI> your desires, yet you can cry to God, and nothing will still you but a Christ. As the Infant cannot ask, yet cryeth for the Breast. Some might utter words in Prayer, and not pray; &amp; you might want words, and yet pray fervently, accepta∣bly unto God; for Prayer doth not consist in the exercise of parts, memory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but of grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>cannot cry to God, my eyes are dry, and cannot drop a tear; sometimes when</HI> I <HI>am con∣fessing my sins, though so many and so hainous; when others can shed many tears for one sin,</HI> I <HI>cannot shed one tear for many sins.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so with you but sometimes. Besides as there may be tears in the eyes, when there is no sorrow in the heart; so when your eye is

dry, your heart may grieve. An Hypocrite, as he may have more words, so he may have more tears in prayer, than a true Child of God.</P>
</SP>

<P><HI>How then may</HI> I <HI>judge of my prayers, when</HI> I <HI>want these outward signs of sorrow,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your inward frame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heart, when you cannot shed a tear, you feel your heart burthened with, and rising in hatred against your sin? and when you beg for Christ and Grace, you find your heart sincerely reaching forth after both Christ and Grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>do pray indeed, and hear, that</HI> I <HI>may have Christ, but</HI> I <HI>doubt all is in hypocrisie; and that all my duties are the services of an hypocrite; and what did</HI> Judas <HI>get by eating with Christ?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you delight to do a duty so, that no man might know that you do it, and that when you be with others in holy Ordinances, you find you had rather be affected, and not seem to be so to others, than to seem to be affected, and not to be so before God, where is your Hypocrisie? Besides, if you do your duties from a right Principle, love to, and fear of God, in a right manner, <HI>viz</HI> humbly, be∣lievingly, fervently in the name of Christ, and for a right end, that you may glorifie God, have Communion with him, be made more like unto him, that you may have more love to him, and more power and strength against your sin, you are sincere, and not an Hypo∣crite in your duties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>W.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>But sometimes</HI> I <HI>find a secret contentment

in my heart, that men take notice of the outward signs of inward affections, and that when the out∣ward signs are more than my inward affections; is not that Hypocrisie?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes it is, and much to be lamented and opposed: Mourn so if you can, that none but God might perceive it, except when it might be more for the glory of God, and the edifica∣tion of another, that your mourning should be manifested rather than concealed.</P>

<P>Such an Hypocrite a sincere Christian may sometimes be, and is; for as there is some∣thing of Unbelief in one that hath saith in Christ, and something of Pride in one that is humble, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so there is something of hypocri∣sie in every one that is sincere; for in nothing are we perfect as to degrees, while in this life: Therefore as you must not conclude, that your prayers and duties are not accepted of God, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause there are some actings of Unbelief and Pride in them; so neither because there is something of Hypocrisie mingled with them when (as is said) your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and man∣ner, and end, in the main be rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>

<P>You may perform duty from a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inciple of Love, when it is not from a sense of love: when a natural conscience is the principle, it puts you upon the duty, but gives you no strength to perform the duty, but the Spirit of God doth both.</P>
<P>Natural Conscience is satisfied, if the duty be done: But you are not satisfied, except God be enjoyed in the duty▪ Natural Con∣science puts on to duty in time of temporal, or for fear of eternal punishments, but you pray, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That you may please God, have com∣munion with him, and be delivered from the filth and power of sin: when natural consci∣ence only is the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inciple; a Duty i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done with much backwardness of Heart.

When natural Conscience only is the principle, if a man can get an ex∣cuse which will silence Conscience, the Duty with gladness is omitted; but if you are kept (though by lawful cause) from a Duty, it is some grief and trouble to your Soul, and no∣thing but what is weighty, and judged by you to be a Duty also, shall divert you from the Ordinances of God.

The High-Priest, that was a Type of Christ, did bear the Names of the Twelve Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> in the Breast-plate in or upon twelve pre∣cious Stones; but I did see that our great High-priest doth bear the Names of his Elect gravened in his precious heart: And when I did read my Name amongst the rest, what joy and comfort filled my Soul, I am not able to express: His love was stronger than death, the coals thereof were as coals of fire which had a most vehement flame, and methoughts when I drew near unto i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I felt my heart be∣gin to warm.

<P>When I saw the Bread broken, and heard the Minister say, Thus was Christ's Bo∣dy broken for you; and saw him pour out the Wine, and heard him say, Thus was the Blood of Christ shed for you; and when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e did di∣stribute both, and I did take and eat, did take

<P><HI>When else?</HI></P>

<P>When the Congregation was singing forth the praises of the Lord, my Soul being satisfied as with marrow &amp; fatness, my mouth, my heart, my All did praise him; and now my love, my faith, my joy, my sorrow for my sin, were stirring in my heart.</P>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>And how do you know that this is true and spiritual joy, and not such which an Hypocrit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might have at the Table of the Lord?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I find it doth engage me to in∣ward and to universal holiness, inflames my heart with love to God and Christ, increaseth my hatred to my sin, and makes me more watchful against it, and makes my soul to long after full &amp; perfect enjoyment of God in glory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I am glad and do rejoyce in your mercy, while I must bewail my own unprofitableness, even at the Table of the Lord; I must go home &amp; eat my bread with a sorrowful heart, and mingle my drink with tears, while you can go and eat your bread with a chearful spirit.</HI></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, or else I must go home and weep for this as well as you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How doth that appear?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because God doth work variously upon divers Persons, and variously upon the same Person at divers times. Sometimes he breaks the heart for sin, and reserves his comforts for another time: If you do not find your heart inflamed with love and filled with joy, yet if you do find your heart to rise more in hatred unto sin, and to be grieved for it, and more resolve and watch against it, you have receiv∣ed benefit by this Ordinance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Then I must take heed of the stratagems of the Devil, that, as he might not cause me to con∣clude, I have that which I have not; so neither to deny that I have not that which through mercy God hath given to me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will be your wisdom, because it will be your way to get more from God, by being thankful for a little: God will another time give you peace and comfort, if now you will give him thanks that you have wept for your sin, and been grieved for the same.</P>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what may be the cause that I found no more of God in the time of this Ordi∣nance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be you were too slight in your Preparations for this Duty; or if enlarged in them you trusted too much to them, and less to Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist than you should have done; or were not watchful in the time of the Ordi∣nance, or do too much favour some peculiar sin; and God with-holds what you expected, that you might mend that with which he is offended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>This will be mercy, if <HI>I</HI> missed of Com∣fort, that <HI>I</HI> may have less of sin; and shall de∣sire of the Lord, that <HI>I</HI> may find some good by the Ordinance, and your Discourse, now <HI>I</HI> do go in.</P>

<P>Stay, one word more, and that is, that we all remember the Obligations that do lie upon us to walk suitably to the Priviledges we are made partakers of by the death of Christ.</P>

<P>Yes you may, and therefore let us all consider, and bear it upon our hearts, where we have been this day, and how we have re∣newed our Covenant with God, and that his Vows are upon us, and his eyes to observe how we shall walk, and live after we have had, or do hope for peace and joy in him; and that we watch each other, that where any of us fail, the other will reprove in love, and restore him with a Spirit of meekness.</P>
