<P>THe Author was in a <HI>Course of Sermons,</HI> upon, <HI>The Cahpter of Faith,</HI> in the Epistle to the <HI>He∣brews.</HI> One of the <HI>Sermons,</HI> which had nothing else to distinguish it, had a <HI>Singular Impression</HI> upon some of the <HI>Hearers.</HI> The affected <HI>Hearers,</HI> Loving to see <HI>Grace Magnified,</HI> ask'd for a Copy of the Discourse, that they might again have it as <HI>Readers.</HI> The poor, and plain Discourse, is, without any <HI>Ornaments,</HI> but those of a <HI>Con∣stant Preaching,</HI> (sometimes more than twice or thrice in a week,) here Exposed. And perhaps, the less <HI>A∣dorn'd</HI> it is, the more <HI>Ʋseful</HI> it will be to those, whose Edification is therein most aimed at. A Minister of the Gospel, should not be discou∣raged from using all <HI>Opportunities to Do Good</HI>; but rather in Endeavours to <HI>bring forth much Fruit,</HI> render him∣self worthy of the Name, which I find was the Name of a <HI>Spanish</HI> Bishop; namely, <HI>Fructuosus.</HI></P>

Faith,</HI> is, A Reliance upon God for <HI>Life,</HI> through His promised <HI>Messiah.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> (for the Apostle <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eter</HI> tells us, it was he!) calls upon the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> to continue stedfast in the <HI>Faith</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, though the expected Kingdom of the <HI>Messiah</HI> at the <HI>Resurrection from the Dead,</HI> were for a while deferred. The Glorious <HI>Exemples</HI> and <HI>Atchieve∣ments</HI> of a Justifying <HI>Faith,</HI> are here therefore in a <HI>whole Chapter</HI> of them Exhibited.</P>
<P>The last Believer, of whose <HI>Faith,</HI> we have a particular Account and Ap∣plause, in the Apostolical <HI>Catalogue,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow appears before us. It is a <HI>Woman,</HI> for <HI>Faith</HI> is Compatible to both Sexes: and it is a Woman of wonderful Cir∣cumstances, to be found in such a <HI>Catalogue.</HI> For the Larger and Ful∣ler History of the matter, you must have Recourse to the Second Chapter of <HI>Joshua.</HI></P>
<P>It is not among the <HI>Hebrews</HI> only, that the Examples of a Great <HI>Faith</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="000925_0005_0FAD3CF041F023B8"/>
are to be found: We find them a∣mong the <HI>Gentiles</HI> also: <HI>Rahab</HI> was one of them. Now, what was this <HI>Rahab?</HI> What was the <HI>Action</HI> of <HI>Rahab</HI>? What was the <HI>Issue</HI> of the <HI>Action</HI>?</P>
<P>First. The <HI>Person</HI> famous for <HI>Faith,</HI> was, <HI>The Harlot Rahab.</HI> The word that first signified an <HI>Hostess,</HI> did come also to signify an <HI>Harlot.</HI> In those Debauch'd Countreys, and those Brutish Ages, <HI>Women</HI> that kept pub∣lick Houses of Entertainment made them to be <HI>Bawdy</HI> Houses as well as <HI>Drinking</HI> Houses. 'Tis true, in our better Times of Christianity, we often see more Vertuous and Modest women, Employ'd about publick Houses. But the <HI>Old Scandal</HI> should admonish them, to keep the stricter Guard upon their Vertue. <HI>Rahab</HI> it seems, comes under an unhappy Cha∣racter, both for <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Ʋnchasti∣ty:</HI> No doubt the One subordinate unto the Other. The <HI>Rites</HI> of <HI>Idola∣try</HI> were nourished, and maintained
<PB N="6" REF="000925_0006_0FAD3CF1ACB98620"/>
by the Snares of <HI>Unchastity.</HI> The women that served the <HI>Temples,</HI> where men did <HI>Sacrifice to Idols,</HI> were provided also for their <HI>Fornication. Rahab</HI> seems to have been of that quality. And it was not on any Ill Design, that the Honest men of <HI>Israel,</HI> went into the House of a woman of that quality; But God had prepared the <HI>Heart</HI> of the poor woman for their coming to her <HI>House,</HI> Even a <HI>Faith</HI> of Gods fulfilling to His <HI>Israel,</HI> the Great Promise of His <HI>Messiah</HI> to come. She had heard <HI>What</HI> Great Things had been done by God, for His Chosen people, and <HI>That</HI> these Great Things were in Order to the Appearing of the Redeemer of the world, one Day among them. And God set Home what she <HI>Heard</HI>; By this <HI>Hearing,</HI> there <HI>came Faith</HI> unto her.</P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Action</HI> whereto <HI>Faith</HI> inclined this person, was that of <HI>Receiving the Spies with peace.</HI> It was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Young Faith,</HI> which had
<PB N="7" REF="000925_0007_0FAD3CF1C466BD50"/>
been infused into her; and yet a <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung Faith</HI> must be a <HI>Tried One.</HI> Christian, If thou hast any <HI>Faith,</HI> look for some <HI>Trial</HI> of it. The Prince of <HI>Jericho</HI> had got some Information, that certain <HI>Israelitish pies</HI> were come unto her. She not only covered and concealed the <HI>Spies,</HI> and notably assist∣ed their Escape, when she might have gained the Princes Favour by Betraying them, and she ran the Haz∣ard of her very Life by not Betraying them: but also upon her Examinati∣on, she told an <HI>Officious Lye</HI> to pre∣serve them. How contrary now is the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, unto the <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> of man! The way of <HI>Man</HI> usually is This: If there be some little <HI>Infir∣mity</HI> in any One, we Proclame it, we Magnify it, we Aggravate it, with all the Reproach imaginable: And ra∣ther than fail, we will Stigmatize that for an <HI>Infirmity,</HI> which rather is an <HI>Excellency.</HI> On the other side, Behold the way of <HI>God! He</HI> takes no notice of <HI>Rahabs Fault</HI>: But He publishes
<PB N="8" REF="000925_0008_0FAD3CF2913188F8"/>
<HI>Rahab Faith,</HI> with all possible Com∣mendation. <HI>My wayes are not like your wayes, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. The <HI>Issue</HI> of the <HI>Action</HI> produced by the <HI>Faith</HI> of this person; was, Her <HI>not Perishing with them that Believed not.</HI> If there be but <HI>One Be∣liever</HI> in a Multitude, in a Town, in a Land, you see, God will find out that <HI>One Believer,</HI> with singular Expressi∣ons of His Favour. Christian, If thou hast the <HI>least Grain</HI> of true <HI>Faith,</HI> nei∣ther Thou, nor thy <HI>Faith</HI> shall be lost. She <HI>Perished not</HI>! No, when all the rest of the City were dreadfully De∣stroyed in their Sins, <HI>Rahab</HI> had the Pardon of all her Sins. The <HI>Life</HI> of her self, and of all her Family was given to her. <HI>Life,</HI> did I say? Yea, she was honourably Married unto One of the Nobles of <HI>Israel.</HI> And more than so? Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself descended from her: You see <HI>Rahab</HI> her self by Name, among the Ancestors of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000925_0009_0FAD3CF34CA0E518"/>Will you not now Stand astonished, O Congregation? Stand astonished at the Triumphs of <HI>Justifying Faith!</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd with a Just astonishment now give Attention to this <HI>Doctrine</HI> of God.</P>
<Q>The Vilest of Sinners may become the Highest of Saints; and by Believing on the Lord Iesus Christ, Escape the horrible Perdi∣tion, that shall Overwhelm those who Persist in Vnbelief.</Q>
<P>We have these PROPOSITIONS now before us.</P>

Serpent in a <HI>Generation of Vipers: Ra∣hab,</HI> One that had worshipped <HI>Idols</HI> and <HI>Devils</HI> with her <HI>Spirit,</HI> and that with her <HI>Body</HI> perpetrated the most Filthy Villany, the most Loathsome Filthiness: <HI>Rahab,</HI> a scandalous Wretch, a Pagan and a Prostitute▪ This <HI>Rahab</HI> you see incorporated into the only true Church of God, and so distinguished with signal smiles of Heaven. She became a <HI>Mother in Israel</HI>; Yea, a <HI>Mother</HI> to the <HI>Saviour of Israel.</HI> And when <HI>Sal∣mon,</HI> an Eminent person in <HI>Israel</HI> Es∣poused her, it was not because of her Eminency in worldly Riches and Honours; for she had nothing: but because of her Eminency in <HI>Piety.</HI> If her <HI>Piety</HI> &amp; <HI>Sanctity</HI> had not been as Notorious as once her <HI>Wickedness,</HI> doubtless the Oracles of God would not more than once in the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> have celebrated her, as a most <HI>Exemplary Person.</HI></P>
<P>We meet with another woman, that was a very Vile woman. It
<PB N="11" REF="000925_0011_0FAD3CF4C11E4140"/>
was the <HI>Samaritaness,</HI> who Successive∣ly and Illegally procured her self to be Divorced from several Husbands, and was an <HI>Abominable Adulteress.</HI> And yet! We read, Joh. 4.39 This woman did not only become a <HI>Disci∣ple</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ her self, but also was an <HI>Instrument</HI> of <HI>Disci∣pling</HI> many others.</P>
<P>We meet with a Third woman, who was also a very Vile woman. It was <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> who was Emphatically one that every One cal∣led <HI>A Sinner.</HI> And yet! We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Luk. 7.47. <HI>Her Sins, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> were <HI>Forgiven her,</HI> for she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>much.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Genealogy</HI> of our Lord J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sus Christ, there are several <HI>Women</HI> mentioned. But there was in some one Remarkable Respect or other, an Ill Note upon every One of those women. And it is the Note, which one of the Ancients hath upon it, This was, <HI>Ʋt qui propter peccatores venerat, de peccat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribis nascens, Omni∣um
<PB N="12" REF="000925_0012_0FAD3CF6A8B7B8A8"/>
peccata deleret</HI>: Our Lords <HI>Birth</HI> was <HI>from</HI> Sinners of all sorts, to teach us, that His <HI>Death</HI> is <HI>for</HI> Sinners of all sorts.</P>
<P>Will you Believe it, Sirs? There is no Sinner so Vile, but what may come to be <HI>Justified,</HI> and <HI>Sanctified.</HI> It is an amazing passage! 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. <HI>Foznicatozs, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminate, [<HI>i. e.</HI></HI> Self-Polluters;] <HI>Sodomites, Thieves, Ephe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us, Drunkards, Revilers, E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tioners: Such were some of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>but ye are Washed, but ye are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, but ye are Justified, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Lord Jesus, and by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our God.</HI></HI> Yea, Sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a more Civil and Moral behaviour, may finally Perish in their <HI>Ʋnregeneracy,</HI> when persons that have been most notorious and flagitious for the <HI>worst</HI> of Crimes, have become <HI>Regenerate.</HI> Certainly, there were many more Innocent women than <HI>Ra∣hab</HI> in <HI>Jericho,</HI> who perished under the Wrath and Curse of God, when
<PB N="13" REF="000925_0013_0FAD3CF7F4D44AC0"/>
<HI>the Harlot Rahab,</HI> at last became the Saved of the Lord. Most Noted and Awful, are those words of our Lord Jesus Christ, Mat. 21.31. <HI>The Pub∣licans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of God, before</HI> the <HI>Pharisees.</HI></P>
<P>But what is the <HI>Reason</HI> of such a Dis∣pensation in the <HI>Providence</HI> of God?</P>
<P>The Grand &amp; Sole <HI>Reason</HI> of it, is, that First Reason of all Reasons, The <HI>Pleasure</HI> of God. We must fall down before <HI>Sovereign Grace,</HI> and say, Mat. 11.26. <HI>Even so, Father, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seemed Good in thy sight.</HI></P>
<P>More particularly.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> God will display His own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>finite <HI>Mercy,</HI> in receiving the <HI>Vilest of Sinners</HI> to His <HI>Mercy.</HI> When God will show <HI>Mercy,</HI> He will do it like a GOD. Hence, as <HI>God will have Mercy, on whom He will have Mercy,</HI> so He will make the <HI>Vilest of
<PB N="14" REF="000925_0014_0FAD3CF8E151D8A0"/>
Sinners,</HI> the Subjects of His <HI>Mercy</HI>: and He will put up <HI>Injuries,</HI> and pass by <HI>Offences,</HI> that would break the back of all Humane Patience. Thus 'tis said, Hos. 11.9. <HI>I will not Execute the fierceness of my Anger, for I am God, and not man.</HI> The <HI>Free-Grace</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> of God is a <HI>Boundless Ocean:</HI> And God will declare the Glory of His <HI>Mercy,</HI> by casting the Greatest of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins, into the <HI>Depths</HI> of that <HI>Ocean.</HI> The Design of God, in bringing home Sinners to Himself, is to Exercise and Glorify His <HI>Free-Grace:</HI> He does what He does, to <HI>manifest the Exceed∣ing Riches of His Grace.</HI> Now the <HI>Free Grace</HI> of the <HI>most High</HI> God, is Glorified unto the <HI>Heighth,</HI> in Choos∣ing the <HI>Vilest of Sinners</HI> from the rest of mankind, and bringing <HI>them</HI> home unto Himself. As 'tis said; Tit. 3.3, 5. <HI>We were sometimes foolish, disobe∣dient, deceived, serving diverse lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, —but according to His Mer∣cy He Saved us:</HI> Thus, when the most
<PB N="15" REF="000925_0015_0FAD3CF94DEA0EB8"/>
<HI>foolish</HI> and <HI>hateful</HI> of Sinners, and they that wallowed in the <HI>Vilest of Lusts,</HI> are <HI>Saved,</HI> Oh, how much will the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God shine forth in their Salvation! Methinks, I overhear the <HI>Songs of the Redeemed; Lord, If thou hadst not been abundant in Mercy, I tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have abounded in Sin, could never have been Saved! Lord, If thou hadst not De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghted in Mercy, thou would never have Saved me, that have made Sin my De∣light! Lord, Thou art Merciful, and Ready to Pardon, Else I, who have been Ready to Sin, had never found a Pardon!</HI> And the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, make a Con∣sort hereto, with Eternal <HI>Hallelujahs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> God will display the Infinite <HI>Merit</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, by making the <HI>Vilest of Sin∣ners</HI> feel the Efficacy of that <HI>Merit.</HI> If only Sinners, of an Ordinary Ele∣vation in Sin, were Saved, the <HI>Merit</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, would not be seen to be of such an <HI>Unlimited Va∣lue</HI> as indeed it is. But when <HI>Extra∣ordinary
<PB N="16" REF="000925_0016_0FAD3CFA7A2043A8"/>
Sinners,</HI> &amp; the tallest Giants, and the fiercest Monsters, of Sin, come to be Saved, <HI>Then</HI>! Then in∣deed, it is made Evident, that the <HI>Blood o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jesus Christ, the Son of God, cleanses from <HI>All Sin.</HI></HI> Hence 'tis urged, Psal. 25.11. <HI>For thy Names sake, O Lord, Pardon mine Iniquity, for it is Great.</HI> What is <HI>Great?</HI> Why, As the <HI>Sin</HI> is <HI>Great,</HI> so, the <HI>Name</HI> is <HI>Great</HI> the <HI>Name</HI> of God, that is to say, the <HI>Christ</HI> of God. When <HI>Great Sin</HI> is <HI>Pardoned,</HI> it shows, that there is a <HI>Great Christ</HI> who has purchased the Pardon, and that he has paid a <HI>Great Price</HI> for the purchase of it, and that He is, <HI>A Saviour, and a Great One.</HI> When the <HI>Vilest of Sinners</HI> are Saved, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a vast Encouragement unto <HI>other Sinners</HI> to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, who, they see, will not <HI>Cast out</HI> the <HI>Vilest of Sinners,</HI> when they <HI>Come unto Him,</HI> &amp; whose <HI>Blood</HI> is an <HI>Open Fountain</HI> for the <HI>Vilest of Sinners.</HI> Thus the Apostle, 1 Tim. 1.15, 16. <HI>Christ Je∣sus came into the world, to Save Sinners
<PB N="17" REF="000925_0017_0FAD3CFAE06165F0"/>
of whom I am Chief; I obtained Mer∣cy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a Pat∣tern to others.</HI> When the <HI>Chief of Sinners</HI> are <HI>Saved,</HI> there is a <HI>Pattern</HI> given, of what the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ can do for them that come unto it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> God will display the Infinite <HI>Power</HI> of His Holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> by making the <HI>Vilest of Sinners</HI>▪ feel the transforming Effects of that <HI>Power</HI> upon them. When Sinners are Saved, they are not only Released from the <HI>Damnation</HI> whereto they were Exposed by their Sins, but they are also Rescued from the <HI>Dominion</HI> which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sins had over them. In the Saving of Sinners, the old Sinners are made <HI>New Creatures</HI>; They have <HI>New</HI> Principles, <HI>New</HI> Abilities, <HI>New</HI> Dispositions: The Sinners undergo a wonderful <HI>Renovation</HI> in all their Faculties: The <HI>Image</HI> of Satan is A∣bolished in them, and the <HI>Image</HI> of
<PB N="18" REF="000925_0018_0FAD3CFBA7646D48"/>
God Introduced: A <HI>Toad</HI> is turn'd into a <HI>Man,</HI> yea, a <HI>Serpent</HI> is turn'd into an <HI>Angel.</HI> This <HI>Conversion of a Sinner</HI> is a mighty work, and a work that can be done by none but the Almighty <HI>Power</HI> of God: We are told, Eph. 1.19. <HI>We believe according to the working of His mighty Power.</HI> Now, for the <HI>Vilest of Sinners</HI> to have the Experience of such a Change, as that which is undergone in Conver∣sion, &amp; be Changed from the <HI>Slaves</HI> of Hell, into the <HI>Sons</HI> of God; This, Oh! This does manifest the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> with a very mar∣vellous Demonstration. To fetch a forlorn Sinner from the very belly and bottom of Hell, and Extinguish all the hideous Lusts which he is de∣praved withal, and Rectify all that is amiss in him, and make him a very <HI>Picture</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself throughout Eternal Ages: Oh! the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> that shall do such a thing? Tis said, Act. 11.21. <HI>The Hand of the Lord was with

them, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a great Number Believed, and Turned unto the Lord.</HI> Now when the <HI>vilest of Sinners</HI> are <HI>Turned unto the Lord,</HI> He as it were Glories in it, saying, <HI>See what my Hand can do!</HI> One of the Heathen writers in the Primitive Times, made that Cavil ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst Christianity, <HI>That it was a Sanctuary for the vilest of Sinners!

<P><PB N="20" REF="000925_0020_0FAD3CFD039D2BC0"/>And that Enquiry shall be thus Answered. It is a <HI>Looking</HI> to, and <HI>Trusting</HI> in, the Lord Jesus Christ, for <HI>Salvation. <HI>Faith</HI></HI> cannot be bet∣ter described, than in that Call to <HI>Faith</HI> which our Lord has given us, Isa. 45.22. <HI>Look unto me, &amp; be ye Saved.</HI> A man mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> see himself plunged into doleful circumstances of Sinfulness &amp; Wretch∣edness, by his <HI>Fall</HI> from God, &amp; see him∣self unable to help himself out of those doleful circumstances.

the Lord Jesus Christ, as the only One, that shall Recover us to Everlasting Happiness. <HI>Faith</HI> is a <HI>Repairing</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ for <HI>Salvation.</HI> It saith, Psal. 116.4. <HI>I beseech thee, O Lord, to deliver my Soul.</HI> And <HI>Faith</HI> is a <HI>Relying</HI> on the Lord Jesus Chrst for <HI>Salvation.</HI> It saith, Psal 62.5, 6. <HI>My Soul, wait thou only upon God, for my Expectation is from Him, He only is my Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>We will Enquire, <HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the <HI>Salvation,</HI> that we secure by <HI>Believing?</HI></P>
<P>And that Enquiry shall be thus Answered. All the <HI>Benefits</HI> to be derived and expected from the Lord Jesus Christ, are comprized in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> One word, <HI>Salvation.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Justification</HI> is another part of the <HI>Salvation</HI> that follows upon <HI>Be∣lieving.</HI> We read, Rom. 5.1. <HI>We are Justified by Faith.</HI> When we <HI>Be∣lieve</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ▪ <HI>Then</HI> we are accquitted from all the <HI>Curses</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> of God had pronounced upon us; <HI>Then</HI> we are inve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted with the perfect <HI>Righteousness</HI> of that Obedience which our Surety has yielded unto the <HI>Law</HI> for us; we are entituled unto the <HI>Blessedness of the Righteous; <HI>Then</HI></HI> the Great God sayes unto us, <HI>Be of Good Cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sanctification</HI> is one more part of the <HI>Salvation</HI> that follows upon <HI>Be∣lieving.</HI> We read, 2 Thes. 2.13.
<PB N="23" REF="000925_0023_0FAD3CFF44690B28"/>
<HI>God hath Chosen us to Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth.</HI> When we <HI>Believe</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Then</HI> we <HI>Dy</HI> to Sin and <HI>Live</HI> to God, and we are set at Liberty from the <HI>Bondage</HI> of our Corruptions; <HI>Then</HI> the Divine Influences of our Lord <HI>Renew us in the Spirit of our mind,</HI> and Adorn us with His Heavenly Graces, and Assist us to bring forth much of that <HI>Fruit whereby our Heavenly Father may be Glorified</HI>; and render us <HI>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI></P>
<P>But, finally, the <HI>Consummation</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur <HI>Salvation</HI> is in that <HI>Inheritance.</HI> We read 1 Joh. 5.13. <HI>You that Believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Name of the Son of God, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>now, that you have Eternal Life.</HI> If we <HI>Believe</HI> on our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Then</HI> we shall at the <HI>End of our Life, receive the End of our Faith,</HI> even the <HI>Salvation of our Soul,</HI> in <HI>Everlasting Life. <HI>Then</HI></HI> we shall at our <HI>De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arture,</HI> go to be with the Lord on

<P>We will Enquire <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>Security</HI> that our <HI>Salvation</HI> hath by our <HI>Believing,</HI> what is it, and where lyes it?</P>
<P>Our Answer to that Enquiry must be This.</P>
<P>First, <HI>Faith</HI> puts the <HI>Believer</HI> un∣der a <HI>Promise</HI> of <HI>Salvation.</HI> We have the unfailing <HI>Promise</HI> of the <HI>God that cannot Lye</HI>; It is the <HI>Pro∣mise</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="000925_0025_0FAD3D00C109E650"/>
of God, Mar. 16.16. <HI>He that Believeth shall be Saved.</HI> It is the <HI>Promise</HI> of God, Act. 16.31. <HI>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be Saved.</HI> And because of this <HI>Pro∣mise,</HI> 'tis said, Joh. 3.36. <HI>He that Believeth on the Son, hath Everlast∣ing Life.</HI></P>
<P>And then Secondly, <HI>Faith</HI> is the <HI>Instrument</HI> by which the <HI>Believer</HI> does <HI>Receive</HI> the <HI>Promised <HI>Salvation.</HI> Salvation</HI> is all for the <HI>Receiver.</HI> If men won't <HI>Reject <HI>Salvation,</HI></HI> but <HI>Receive</HI> it, they shall have it. Now, <HI>Faith</HI> is a <HI>Receiving.</HI> All the Bles∣sings of the New Covenant are tendered unto us: The Great God makes this Tender, <HI>Wilt thou have my Son, and shall His Righteousness be Imputed unto thee? Wilt thou have my Spirit, and shall His Holi∣ness be Imprinted upon thee? Wilt thou have my Word, for the only Rule of thy Life, and wilt thou have thy Happiness, in my Kingdom for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>?</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="000925_0026_0FAD3D030F200260"/>
The Heart, the conquered Heart, answering, <HI>Lord, I take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, I take it, with all my Heart!</HI> That's <HI>Faith</HI>: Here's <HI>Faith. Faith</HI> is a <HI>Receiving</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the <HI>Saviour.</HI> We read, Joh. 1.12. <HI>They that Receive Him, are they that Believe on H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Name.</HI> Hence it cannot but be a <HI>Receiving</HI> of <HI>Sal∣vation</HI> with Him. When the Lord Jesus Christ is <HI>Received</HI> by any Soul, He sayes unto that Soul, as He said unto <HI>Zacheus, This Day Salvation is come unto thee.</HI> As <HI>Rahab</HI> was <HI>Mar∣ried</HI> unto <HI>Salmon,</HI> so by <HI>Faith</HI> we are <HI>Married,</HI> unto our <HI>Saviour.</HI> When the <HI>Mystical Marriage</HI> is brought about, <HI>He</HI> is ours; but if <HI>He</HI> be <HI>ours, All</HI> is <HI>ours</HI>; and God will with Him, <HI>give us all things.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Perdition</HI> will be the una∣voidable, the irremediable, the in∣tolerable Consequence of <HI>Vnbelief.</HI> The Inhabitants of <HI>Jericho,</HI> from whom <HI>Rahab</HI> therefore <HI>came out</HI> (as

<P>Lay together these CONCLUSIONS</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="000925_0028_0FAD3D0482C30800"/><HI>First.</HI> Though <HI>Every Sin</HI> be a <HI>Destructive Evil</HI>: yet God has pro∣vided a <HI>Remedy</HI> to deliver a Sin∣ner from Destruction. As it was said, Hos. 13.9. <HI>O Israel, Thou hast destroyed thy self, but in me is thy Help</HI>: So may the God of Heaven say, <HI>O Sinner, thy Sin has destroy'd thee, but I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e provided Help for thee.</HI> The <HI>Least Sin,</HI> is against the <HI>Great God.</HI> The <HI>Dignity</HI> of the Ob∣ject affronted, and offended, by Sin, makes the <HI>Destruction</HI> of the offend∣ing Sinner, to be the Demerit of it: There must be a <HI>Destruction to the workers of Iniquity.</HI> But the Lord Jesus Christ, the God-man, has been made a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to God for man. That <HI>Sacrifice</HI> has made <HI>Atonement</HI> for Sin. If we made use of that <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> we should be Delivered from the <HI>Destruction,</HI> whereto we are obnoxius.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly. Vnbelief</HI> is a <HI>Refusal</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="000925_0029_0FAD3D05BA904388"/>
of the only <HI>Remedy,</HI> for the Deli∣verance of a Sinner from <HI>Destruction.</HI> As 'tis said, Heb. 2.3. <HI>How shall we Escape, if we neglect so great Salva∣tion?</HI> Truly, <HI>Vnbelief</HI> is a <HI>Neglect∣ing,</HI> yea, a <HI>Rejecting</HI> of the <HI>Salva∣tion,</HI> which God has prepared for us. Had a Stung <HI>Israelite</HI> Refused and Forbore, to have Look'd unto the Healing Serpent, he must have remained unheal'd; but he could have Blamed none but himself. An Unbeliever is a <HI>Refuser</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of that <HI>Wisdom,</HI> that <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghteousness,</HI> that <HI>Sanctification,</HI> and that <HI>Redemption,</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ is ready to bestow upon us.

<P><HI>Thirdly. <HI>Positive</HI> Vnbelief</HI> makes the <HI>Destruction</HI> of a Sinner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only <HI>Ʋnavoidable,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rremediable</HI>▪ but also of all, the most <HI>Intolerable</HI>▪
<PB N="30" REF="000925_0030_0FAD3D0615D3FF58"/>
The <HI>Negative <HI>Vnbelief</HI></HI> of them that never heard of the Lord Jesus Christ, makes their <HI>Destruction</HI> to be <HI>Ʋnavoidable,</HI> and <HI>Irremediable.</HI> But then; If they that <HI>know not God,</HI> shall be <HI>punished with Ever∣lasting Destruction,</HI> what shall they be, that <HI>Obey not the Gospel of God</HI>? Surely, when our Lord shall be <HI>Re∣vealed from Heaven in flaming Fire,</HI> none shall so Exquisitely feel the Scalds of it, as they that have slighted Him, after they have had Him <HI>Re∣vealed from Heaven, in the Light</HI> of the Gospel to them.
