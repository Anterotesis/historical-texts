<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE Divine Authority of <HI>Ruling Elders,</HI> &amp;c. In Answer to an Objection.</HEAD>
<P>Object. <HI>BEcause it sets up a new Officer in the</HI> Church, <HI>which is a meer humane Creature, having no authority from the Word of</HI> GOD, <HI>nor was ever heard of in the Church of Christ, till</HI> Calvin<HI>'s time, and that is the</HI> LAY-ELDER.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> WE do here freely con∣fess, that we were of opinion, as some are, that the Ruling-El∣der hath no foundation in the Word of God, but is a meer humane Ordinance brought into the Church only in a prudential way; we
<PB N="2" REF="000957_0003_0FAD975FD449BDA8" MS="y"/>
should heartily desire the utter abolition of him: For we are not ignorant, that the Ru∣ling Prelate was brought into the Church upon the same account, for the avoiding of Schism and Division, and afterwards proved the great Author and Fomenter of Schism and Division. And if we would decline the Ruling Prelate, and take in the Ruling El∣der upon the same prudential grounds, it were just with God to make him as mischie∣vous to the Church, as ever the Ruling Pre∣late was: And therefore let us consider what may be said out of the Word of God, for the Justification of this so much <HI>decryed Officer</HI>: Yet first we cannot but take notice that the name of <HI>Lay-Elder</HI> was affixed to this Officer by way of reproach and scorn, by the ad∣versaries of him, and that it ought not to be continued. For though it be evident by Scripture, [<HI>Heb.</HI> 13.17, 24.] that there is a great difference betwixt the Ministry, usu∣ally called the Clergy, and the people com∣monly called the Laity: Yet its also as ma∣nifest, that the Scripture distinguisheth them not by the names of Clergy and Laity: for∣asmuch as all Gods people are therein stiled the Lords Clergy or Inheritance, [1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3. <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.16.] and the Lord is called their Inheritance. And when persons are duly chosen from amongst the people to be Go∣vernours
<PB N="3" REF="000957_0004_0FAD97609124F250"/>
in the Church, as such, they are no longer Lay-men, but Ecclesiastical per∣sons. And therefore we profess a dislike of the name Lay-Elder, and conceive they ought to be called either Governours in the Church, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.23. or Ruling-Elders: as 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. not because their Office is to rule alone (for the Teaching-Elder is a Ru∣ler also,) <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.17. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.12. but be∣cause their Office is only to rule. Now concerning these Ruling-Elders, we confess,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non quia soli, sed quia solum praesunt.</HI></NOTE> that they are Officers somewhat new &amp; strange to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> yet not new nor strange to the Word of God, nor to the Primitive Times, nor (as all know) to the <HI>Reformed Churches.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>They are not new nor strange to the Word of God, neither in the Old-Testament, nor in the New.</HI> The Jews in the Old-Testament, had two sorts of Elders, <HI>Elders of the Priests, and Elders of the People;</HI> suitable to our <HI>Teaching and Ruling Elders,</HI> as appears, <HI>Jer.</HI> 19.1. And these Elders of the people did sit and vote with the Priests and Levites in all their Ec∣clesiastical Consistories, and that by divine appointment. That they were <HI>constituent</HI> members of the great <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> appears, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.8. where we read, that <HI>some of the chief of the Fathers were joyned with the Priests,
<PB N="4" REF="000957_0005_0FAD976151378820"/>
to judge in the matters of the Lord.</HI> And how∣soever, many things among the Jews after the Captivity, did decline to disorder and confusion; yet we find even in the days of Christ, and his Apostles, That the Elders of the people still sate and voiced in the Coun∣cel with the Priests, according to the anci∣ent form, as is clear from <HI>Matth.</HI> 26.57, 59. <HI>Matth.</HI> 27.1, 12. <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.21. <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.23. <HI>Mark</HI> 14.43. <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.66. and <HI>Saravia</HI> himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De divers. grad. Minist. Evang.</HI> cap. 11. p. 108.</NOTE> who disputeth so much against <HI>Ru∣ling Elders,</HI> acknowledgeth thus much: <HI>I find indeed,</HI> (saith he) <HI>Elders in the Assembly of the Priests of the old Synagogue, which were not Priests; and their suffrages and authority in all judgments, were equal with the suffrages of the Priests.</HI> But he adds, <HI>That these Elders of the people, were Civil Magistrates;</HI> which is a poor shift, directly against many Scriptures, which contradistinguish these <HI>Elders</HI> from the Civil <HI>Magistrate;</HI> as appears, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.5. <HI>Judg.</HI> 8.14. <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.23. <HI>Josh.</HI> 8.33. 2 <HI>King.</HI> 10.15. <HI>Ezra.</HI> 10.14. And though it were possible, that some of them might be Civil <HI>Magistrates,</HI> as some Elders among us, are Justices of the Peace; Yet they did not sit under that ca∣pacity, in the Ecclesiastical <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> but as Ecclesiastical Elders.</P>
<P>And that the Jews also had <HI>Elders of the peo∣ple,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="000957_0006_0FAD976212664FD8"/>
sitting and voting in their inferiour Con∣sistories, appears (as we humbly conceive) from <HI>Acts</HI> 13.15. <HI>Acts</HI> 18.8, 17. <HI>Mar.</HI> 5.22. In which places, we read of the Rulers of the Synagogue, who were neither Priests nor Levites, and yet were Rulers in Church-mat∣ters, and had power, together with the Priests, of casting men out of the Synagogue, and of ordering Synagogue-worship, <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.42. <HI>Acts</HI> 13.15.</P>
<P>Now this <HI>Association</HI> of the <HI>Elders of the peo∣ple, with the Priest, in the Jewish Church-Go∣vernment, was by Divine Appointment;</HI> for <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> first instituted it, and afterwards <HI>Jehosaphat</HI> restored it, according as they were directed by God, <HI>Numb.</HI> 11.16. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.8. And it did belong to the <HI>Jewish Church,</HI> not as it was Jewish, but as it was a Church, and therefore belongeth to the Christian Church, as well as Jewish. <HI>For whatsoever agreeth to a Church, as a Church; agreeth to every Church.</HI> There was nothing Judaical or typical in this institution, but it was founded upon the light of nature, and right reason, which is alike in all ages.</P>
<P>But leaving the Old Testament, let us consider what may be said for the Divine Right of the <HI>Ruling-Elder,</HI> out of the New-Testament. For this purpose, we have al∣ready produced three places, which we shall
<PB N="6" REF="000957_0007_0FAD9762D403EAA8"/>
now briefly open; and shew how the Ru∣ling-Elder is proved out of them. The places are, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.7, 8. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17.</P>
<P>The first place is, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. <HI>And God hath set some in the Church, first, Apostles; secondarily, Prophets, thirdly, Teachers; After that, Miracles; then gifts of healing, helps, governments, diversities of tongues;</HI> where we have an enumeration of sundry Officers of the Church; and amongst others,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calvin in locum Chrysostom</HI> up∣on 1 Cor. 12.28. <HI>Estius</HI> upon 1 Cor. 12.28.</NOTE> there are <HI>Helps, Governments.</HI> By <HI>Helps,</HI> are meant <HI>Deacons;</HI> (as not only our <HI>Reformed Divines,</HI> but <HI>Chry∣sostome</HI> and <HI>Estius,</HI> and others ob∣serve) and by <HI>Governments,</HI> are meant the <HI>Ruling-Elder;</HI> which that it may the better appear, we will propound, and prove these six things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That by <HI>Governments,</HI> are meant <HI>men ex∣ercising Government,</HI> the <HI>Abstract</HI> put for the <HI>Concrete.</HI> The intent of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> is not to speak of <HI>Offices</HI> distinct from <HI>Persons,</HI> but of <HI>Persons exercising Offices.</HI> This appears first, by the beginning of the verse, <HI>God hath set some in his Church;</HI> this relates to persons, not un∣to Offices. Secondly, by the 29. and 30. verses, where the Apostle speaks <HI>concretively,</HI> of those things which he had spoken before <HI>abstractively. Are all workers of miracles? have
<PB N="7" REF="000957_0008_0FAD976391336970"/>
all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues,</HI> &amp;c? and so by consequence, <HI>Are all helpers, are all Governours?</HI> And therefore it is, that the Syriack instead of <HI>helps, Governments,</HI> reads it <HI>helpers, Governours.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Governour</HI> here meant, must needs be a <HI>Church-Governour</HI>; for it is expres∣ly said, that he is seated in the Church, and therefore the Civil Magistrate cannot be meant by this Governour, as some would have it; partly, because this is quite besides the whole intent and scope of the Chapter, treating meerly upon <HI>spiritual Church-matters,</HI> not at all of secular civil matters; and part∣ly, because the Magistrate, as such, is not placed by God in the <HI>Church,</HI> but in the <HI>Common-wealth:</HI> and partly, because the A∣postle writes of such Governours, that had at that time actual existence in the Church; and neither then, nor divers hundred years after, were there any <HI>Christian Magistrates.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That this <HI>Church-Governour</HI> is seated by God in his Church; It is a <HI>plant of Gods own planting,</HI> and therefore shall stand firm, mau∣gre all opposition. For it is expresly said, <HI>God hath set some in his Church, first Apostles,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>then helps, then Governments.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That this Church-Governour thus seat∣ed by God in his Church, is not onely a <HI>Church-Member,</HI> but a <HI>Church-Officer.</HI> For
<PB N="8" REF="000957_0009_0FAD976817CA9768"/>
though it be a question amongst the Learn∣ed, whether some of the persons here na∣med, as the <HI>workers of miracles,</HI> and those that had the <HI>gift of healing and of tongues,</HI> were seated by God, as Officers in the Church, and not rather, only as eminent members indued with these eminent gifts; yet it is most certain, that whosoever is seated by God in his Church, as a <HI>Church-Governour,</HI> must needs be a <HI>Church-Officer;</HI> for the na∣ture of the gift, doth necessarily imply an Office. The Greek word for Governments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> is a metaphor from <HI>Pilots,</HI> or <HI>Ship-Masters,</HI> governing their Ships; (hence the Master of a Ship is called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a Governour, <HI>Jam.</HI> 3.4.) and it notes such Officers as sit at the stern of the Vessel of the Church, to govern and guide it in spiritu∣als, according to the will and mind of Christ, which is the direct Office of our <HI>Ruling-Elder.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. This Church-Governour thus seated by God in his Church as a <HI>Church-Officer,</HI> is <HI>an ordinary and perpetual Officer in his Church.</HI> Indeed, here is mention made of Officers ex∣traordinary, as Apostles, Prophets; and of gifts extraordinary, as the gift of miracles, healing and of tongues; but here is also mention made of ordinary Officers, perpetu∣ally to abide, as <HI>Teachers, Helpers,</HI> and the
<PB N="9" REF="000957_0010_0FAD9768D2BB8070"/>
<HI>Church-Governour, or Ruling-Elder.</HI> And that this Officer is ordinary and perpetual, ap∣pears from the perpetual necessity of him in the Church; for a Church without Go∣vernment, is as a Ship without a Pilot, as a Kingdom without a Magistrate, and a world without a Sun.</P>
<P N="6">6. That this Church-Governour thus sea∣ted by God in his Church, as a perpetual Officer, is an Officer <HI>contra-distinguished in the Text from the</HI> Apostles, Prophets, Tea∣chers, <HI>and all other</HI> Officers <HI>in the Church.</HI> This appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Apostles manner of expressing these Officers in an <HI>enumerative</HI> form; First, <HI>Apostles; Secondarily, Prophets; Thirdly, Teach∣ers; After that, Miracles, then gifts of heal∣ing,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the recapitulation, vers. 29, 30. <HI>Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teach∣ers? Are all workers of miracles?</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the scope of the whole Chapter, which is to set down different gifts and offices in different subjects; It is said, vers. 8, 9. <HI>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another, faith,</HI> &amp;c. And for this purpose, the Apostle draweth a simile from the members of man's bo∣dy: As there are different members in
<PB N="10" REF="000957_0011_0FAD976991BBFE48"/>
mans body, and every member hath its different office, and every member stands in need one of another; the Eye cannot say to the Hand, I have no need of thee; nor again, the head to the foot, I have no need of thee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So it is in the Church Ministerial, which is the Body of Christ. God hath set different Officers in his Church▪ some ordinary and perpetual; some extraordinary and temporary: And these different Officers, have different Offi∣ces; some to teach, others to distribute to the poor Saints, others to govern. Are all Tea∣chers? are all Deacons? are all Church-Gover∣nours? and these have all need one of ano∣ther. The Teacher cannot say to the Deacon, I have no need of thee; nor to the Church-Governour, I have no need of thee: But if all these Officers were in the Pastor alone, and only, then might he truly say to the Deacon and Ruling-Elder, I have no need of thee. But now God hath so set the Members in his Body, which is his Church, that every member stands in need one of anothers help and support.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> If it be objected, that the Apostles had all these offices and gifts here mentio∣ned, eminently seated in them; for they were Prophets, Teachers, Workers of Mira∣cles,
<PB N="11" REF="000957_0012_0FAD976A51496A40"/>
and therefore why may not all these be understood of one and the same person?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Though it be true, that the Apo∣stles had eminently all these; yet it is as true, that there are many here named, which had but one of these gifts formally seated in them: And it is also apparent, that some of the persons here named were distinct Offi∣cers in the Church, as the Prophet, and the Teacher. Though the Apostles were Pro∣phets and Teachers, yet the Prophet and the Teacher were Officers distinct from the Apo∣stles; and by a parity of Reason, so were the Governours from the Apostle, Prophet, &amp; Tea∣cher; the scope of the Apostle being (as hath been said) to set out distinct Offices in distinct Officers: are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? The sum of what we have said from this Scripture, then is this, <HI>That God hath seated some men in his Church which have a gift and office to govern, which are neither Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, nor Pa∣stors; and therefore they are Ruling-Elders,</HI> which is the Officer we are enquiring after.</P>
<P>Now this interpretation which we have given, is not only the interpretation of Re∣formed Divines, both <HI>Lutherane</HI> and <HI>Calvi∣nists,</HI> but of the ancient Fathers, and even
<PB N="12" REF="000957_0013_0FAD976B114BAC60"/>
the Papists themselves, as appears by the quotations in the Margent.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gerhardus de Ministeri<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ecclesiastico</HI> Calvin <HI>in lo∣cum,</HI> P.

<P>The second Text is, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.6, 7, 8. <HI>Having then gifts differing ac∣cording to the grace given, whether Prophesie, let us prophesie according to the proportion of Faith; or Ministry, Let us wait on our ministring; or he that teacheth on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation. He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity. He that ruleth, with diligence. He that sheweth mer∣cy with chearfulness.</HI> In which words, we have a perfect enumeration of all the ordi∣nary Offices of the Church. These Offices are reduced, first, to two general heads, <HI>Pro∣phesie</HI> and <HI>Ministry,</HI> &amp; are therefore set down in the <HI>Abstract.</HI> By <HI>Prophesie</HI> is meant the fa∣culty of right understanding, interpreting, and expounding the Scriptures. Ministry comprehends all other employments, in the
<PB N="13" REF="000957_0014_0FAD976BD2BF1E38"/>
Church. Then these generals are subdivi∣ded into the special offices contained under them, and are therefore put down in the cancrete. Under <HI>Prophesie</HI> are contained, 1. <HI>He that teacheth,</HI> that is, the Doctor or Tea∣cher. 2. <HI>He that exhorteth, i. e.</HI> the Pastor. Under <HI>Ministry</HI> are comprized. 1. <HI>He that giveth,</HI> that is the Deacon. 2. <HI>He that ruleth,</HI> that is, the Ruling-Elder. 3. <HI>He that sheweth mercy,</HI> which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Estius in</HI> Rom. 12. <HI>Aliis placet etiam hac par∣te speciale quoddam cha∣risma sive offi∣cium significa∣ri, &amp; misereri dicaturi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s qui ab Ecclesia curandis mise∣ris, potissimum aegrotis, praefect∣us est, iisque praebet obsequia velut etiam hodie fit in ne∣socomiis; qui sensus haud quaquam improbabilis est.</HI></NOTE>Office pertained unto them, who in those days had care of the sick: So that in these words; we have the <HI>Ruling-Elder</HI> plain∣ly set down, and <HI>contra</HI>-distin∣guished from the <HI>teaching</HI> and <HI>exhorting Elder</HI> (as appears by the <HI>distributive particles, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Whether he that teacheth; whether he that exhorteth; whether he that ruleth,</HI> &amp;c.) And here likewise we have the divine institution of the <HI>Ru∣ling Elder,</HI> for so the words hold forth. <HI>Having then gifts differ∣ing according to the grace that is given unto us</HI>; and thus also in the third verse, <HI>according as God hath dealt to every man,</HI> &amp;c. This Officer is the gift of Gods free grace to the Church, for the good of it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000957_0015_0FAD976C91EA3268"/>Against this Exposition of the Text it is objected by those that oppose the Divine Right of the <HI>Ruling-Elder,</HI> that the Apostle speaks in these words, not <HI>of several offices in several persons, but of several Gifs in one and the same person</HI>; for he saith, <HI>having then Gifts differing according,</HI> &amp;c. But we answer:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the word <HI>Gift</HI> is often in Scrip∣ture taken for <HI>Office; as Eph.</HI> 4.8.11. <HI>When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave Gifts unto men,</HI> and v.11. <HI>He shew∣eth what these Gifts were, some to be Apostles, some Evangelists,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Apostle in the <HI>Protasis</HI> speaks not of several Gifts, but of several Offices, and these not in the <HI>same,</HI> but in several <HI>members,</HI> ver. 4. <HI>As we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office.</HI> And therefore the <HI>apodosis</HI> must also be understood not only of <HI>several gifts,</HI> but of <HI>several Offices,</HI> and these in <HI>several subjects.</HI> And this further appears by the very simi∣litude which the Apostle here useth, which is the same he used. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. from the bo∣dy natural, wherein there are many distinct members, and every member hath its distinct Office; and so it is in the Church of Christ.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="000957_0016_0FAD976D5144C2D8"/>3. These gifts here mentioned, and the waiting upon them, do necessarily imply an Office in whomsoever they are; and there∣fore they are set down emphatically with an Article, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. He that hath the gift of teaching, and exhorting, &amp; ruling, and waiteth upon this gift, what is he but a Teacher, Pastor, and Ruling-El∣der? And this must either be granted, or else we must open a door for all members of the Church, even women, not only to preach and teach, but to rule also, and to wait upon preaching and ruling: This truth is so clear, as that the Papists themselves be∣ing convinced of it, do say upon this Text, that the Apostle here first speaks of gifts in general; and secondly, applyeth these gifts to Ecclesiastical Offi∣cers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cornelius a la∣pide, in</HI> Rom. 12.6, 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>v.</HI> 6. and afterwards directs his exhortation to all Christians in general.</P>
<P>The third Text for the Divine Right of the <HI>Ruling-Elder,</HI> is, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. <HI>Let the El∣ders that rule well be counted worthy of double ho∣nour, especially they who labour in the Word and Doctrine.</HI> For the understanding of which words, we will lay down this rule, That e∣very Text of Scripture is to be interpreted according to the literal and grammatical construction; unless it be contrary to the
<PB N="16" REF="000957_0017_0FAD977330A68378"/>
analogie of Faith, or the rule of Life, or the circumstances of the Text: otherwise, we shall make a nose of wax of the Scriptures, and draw <HI>quidlibet ex quolibet.</HI> Now accord∣ing to the <HI>Grammatical construction,</HI> here are plainly held forth <HI>two sorts of Elders;</HI> the one, <HI>only Ruling</HI>; and the other, <HI>also labouring in Word and Doctrine.</HI> Give us leave to give you the true analysis of the words.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is a <HI>Genus,</HI> a general, and that is <HI>Elders.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Two distinct species, or kinds of Elders, <HI>Those that rule well, and those that labour in Word and Doctrine;</HI> as Pastor and Doctor.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here we have two participles, expressing these two kinds of Elders, <HI>Ruling, Labouring</HI>; the first do only rule, the second do also la∣bour in Word and Doctrine.</P>
<P N="4">4. Here are two distinct Articles, distinctly annexed to these two participles, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. They that rule, They that la∣bour.</P>
<P N="5">5. Here is an <HI>eminent discretive particle,</HI> set betwixt these two kind of Elders; these two participles; these two Articles evidently di∣stinguishing one from the other, <HI>viz. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, especially they that labour, &amp;c.</HI> And wheresoe∣ver this word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is used in the New-Te∣stament, it is used to distinguish thing from thing, or person from person; as <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.10.
<PB N="17" REF="000957_0018_0FAD977351FDA2F8"/>

<P>IT is requisite that utmost endeavours should be used, in order to a full sup∣ply of Officers in the Churches, according to Christs Institution. The defect of these Churches on this account is very lamen∣table, there being in most of the Churches only one Teaching Officer, for the burden of the whole Congregation to lye upon. The Lord Christ would not have instituted Pastors, Teachers, Ruling Elders (nor the Apostles have ordained Elders in every Church, <HI>Act.</HI> 14.23. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5.) if he had not seen there was need of them for the good of his People; and therefore for men to think they can do well enough without them, is both to break the second Commandment, and to reflect upon the wisdom of Christ, as if he did appoint un∣necessary

Officers in his Church. Expe∣rience hath evinced, that Personal In∣struction and Discipline, hath been an happy means to Reform degenerated Con∣gregations; yea, and owned by the Lord for the Conversion of many Souls: but where there are Great Congregations, it is impossible for one man, besides his la∣bours in Publick, fully to attend these other things of great importance; and necessary to be done in order to an effectual Reformation of Families and Congregations.</P>

<HEAD>QUESTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WHether are not the Brethren, and not the Elders of the Church only, to Judge con∣cerning the Qualifications and Fitness, of those who are Admitted into their Communion?</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>There is some difference of Apprehension, and yet no breach of Amity or <HI>Union,</HI> as to this <HI>Question</HI> between the Brethren of the Presbyterian, and the Congregational way, the former giving this power only to the <HI>El∣dership,</HI> the latter joyning the <HI>Fraternity</HI> with them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>In Resp. ad Apollon.</HI> p. 13.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> and from him Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> has Judiciously stated and discussed this Con∣troversy. Let their and some other Arguments be duely weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</P>
<P N="1">1. They that have power in Admission have power to Judge whether the Persons to be Admitted are duely qualified for Admission. But this is true of the <HI>Fraternity</HI> as well as of the <HI>Presbytery.</HI> No one can be Admitted into the Church by the Elders without the Con∣sent of the Brethren. The Community is concerned in who are Admitted, and there∣fore should concur therein. Its a received
<PB N="23" REF="000957_0024_0FAD9777D17EAEF8"/>
maxim, <HI>Quod tangit omnes, debet ab omnibus ap∣probari.</HI> And reason says, They that have power to Admit, have power to Judge whe∣ther the Persons who desire it, are fit for that Admittance.</P>
<P N="2">2. They that have power to Judge whe∣ther a Person is fit to be cast out of Commu∣nion, have power to Judge whether he is fit to be received into Communion. <HI>The Key</HI> [the power] <HI>of Opening and Shutting</HI> belongs to the same Persons. But it is clear from the Scripture, that the Brethren and not the El∣ders only have power to Judge whether an Offender is fit to be Excommunicated, <HI>Matt.</HI> 18.17. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.12. All Orthodox Divines agree that Church Discipline should be Ex∣ercised, <HI>Consentiente plebe.</HI> So amongst the Ancients, <HI>Cyprian, Ambrose, Austin, Jerom, Chrysostom, Nazianzene, Theodoret, Theophylact.</HI> And amongst our Modren Divines, <HI>Calvin, Beza, Bullinger, Melancton, Junius, Pareus, Rivet, Trelcatius.</HI> If their consent is necessary, than they have power to Judge whether they ought to consent or no.</P>
<P N="3">3. They that have power to Judge whe∣ther a Person Excommunicated, is fit to be restored to the Communion of the Church, have power to Judge whether Persons never yet received into the Communion of the Church are duely qualified for that Commu∣nion.
<PB N="24" REF="000957_0025_0FAD9778933F5670"/>
But the Apostle writes to <HI>the Brethren,</HI> as well as to <HI>the Elders,</HI> of the Church in <HI>Co∣rinth,</HI> to restore a Penitent, whom they had according to the Discipline of Christ laid un∣der a Church censure, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6. If the Bre∣thren are competent Judges concerning the Repentance of a Lapsed Communicant, they are not incompetent Judges of the Repen∣tance of other Persons that may offer them∣selves to their Communion.</P>
<P N="4">4. When <HI>Saul</HI> desired to joyn to the Church at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he was not admitted until the Brethren were by the <HI>Testimony</HI> of <HI>Barnabas,</HI> together with his own <HI>Declaration,</HI> satisfyed concerning the reality of his Faith and Re∣pentance, <HI>Act.</HI> 9.26, 27.</P>
<P N="5">5. If only Elders have power to Judge who are fit to come to the Sacrament or to joyn to the Churches, then in case there is but one Elder in a Church (as there are very few Churches in <HI>New-Englnd</HI> that have more Elders than one) the Sole power will reside in that one mans hands. Then by a parity of reason one alone would have power to suspend from Communion, which Judicious Presbyterians do not allow of. For the <HI>Lon∣don</HI> Ministers in their Vindication of the Pres∣byterian Government, (<HI>p.</HI> 70, 71.) have these Words.
<Q>It is (say they) as warrantable by the Word of God, for one Minister to assume
<PB N="25" REF="000957_0026_0FAD9779518123E0"/>
unto himself alone the power of Suspend∣ing from the Sacrament, as it is to assume the whole power of admitting to the Sacra∣ment, for <HI>contrariorum eadem est ratio:</HI> For one Minister alone to assume this power to himself, is to make himself a Congregatio∣nal Pope. It is a bringing into the Church a power that would have some resemblance to Auricular Confession.</Q>
Thus said the Presbyterians Fifty years ago.</P>
<P N="6">6. The way to keep Popery out of the World, is for the <HI>Fraternity</HI> in Churches to assert and maintain that power and priviledge, which does of right belong unto them. Certain it is, that in the first Ages of Christi∣anity this power which we plead for, was not taken out of the hands of the Brother-hood. One of the Ancients, whose writings give us the greatest in-sight, into what was the gene∣ral practice of the Churches, in the <HI>Third Century,</HI> makes this past dispute. In <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Cyprian. <HI>Epist.</HI> 40.</NOTE> one of his Epistles, he has these words, <HI>Examinabuntur Singela Prusentibus et judicantibus vobis.</HI> And in ano∣ther, <HI>Vix plebi persuadeo et tales pa∣tiantur admitti.</HI> That he had much adoe to perswade the People to be satisfyed with the. Repentance and Qualifications of some that desired a Reception or Restoration to their Communion. When in after times Church
<PB N="26" REF="000957_0027_0FAD977A11C0CCC0"/>
Members thought with themselves, our Mi∣nisters understand Church Affairs better than we do, therefore we will unconcern our selves, and leave all to their <HI>Conscience</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI>: this very thing (as some Learned men have observed) was that which made way for the rise of Popery. It may be it will be for the Edification of some Readers, if we recite some passages out of our famous Dr. <HI>Owen.</HI> In his Judicious <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Part</HI> 1. <HI>Page</HI> 295, 296.</NOTE> Treatise of Evan∣gelical Churches. He has these Words.
<Q>Dr. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> denyes unto the People all Liberty or Ability to chuse their own Pastors, to judge what is meet for their own Edification, what is Heresy, or a per∣nicious Error, and what is not, or any thing of the like nature. This is almost the same with that of the Pharisees, concerning them who admired and followed the Doctrine of our Saviour, <HI>Joh.</HI> 7.49. <HI>This People which know not the Low</HI>: yet was it <HI>this People,</HI> whom the Apostle directed to choose out from a∣mong themselves, Persons meet for an E∣vangelical Office, <HI>Act.</HI> 6. <HI>The same People</HI> who joyned with the Apostles and Elders in the consideration of the Grand Case con∣cerning the continuation of the Legal Ce∣remonies, and were Associates with them in the determination of it, <HI>Act.</HI> 15. <HI>The
<PB N="27" REF="000957_0028_0FAD977E24368DB8"/>
same</HI> to whom all the Apostolical Epistles, Excepting some to particular persons, were written. And unto whom such directions were given and duties Enjoyned in them, as suppose not only Liberty and Ability to judge for themselves in all matters of Faith and Obedience, but also an especial Inte∣rest in the Order and Discipline of the Church, those who were to say to <HI>Archip∣pus</HI> their Bishop, <HI>take heed to the Ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it, Col.</HI> 4.17. Unto whom of all sorts it is Commanded that they should Examine and <HI>Try Antichrists, Spirits, and false Teachers,</HI> that is all sorts of Hereticks, Heresies, and Errors, 1 <HI>Joh. chap.</HI> 2, 3. &amp;c. <HI>That people</HI> who even in following Ages adhered unto the Faith and the Orthodox profession of it, when almost all the Bishops were be∣came Arian Hereticks. This principle of the Reformation in Vindication of the Rights, Liberties, &amp; Priviledges of the Chri∣stian People to judge and choose for them∣selves in matters of Religion, to joyn free∣ly in those Church-Duties which are re∣quired of them, without which the work of it had never been carryed on, we do abide by, and maintain. Yea, we meet with no Opposition more fierce, than upon the ac∣count of our asserting the Liberties and
<PB N="28" REF="000957_0029_0FAD977E91922B40"/>
Rights of the People, in reference unto Church Order and Worship. But I shall not be afraid to say, that as the Reforma∣tion was begun and carryed on, on this principle: So when <HI>this People</HI> shall thro' an apprehension of their Ignorance, Weakness, and <HI>Unmeetness to judge</HI> in matters of Reli∣gion, for themselves, and their own duty, be kept and debarred from it; or when through their own sloth, negligence and viciousness they shall be really uncapable to manage their own Interest in Church Affairs, as being fit only to be Governed if not as <HI>Bruit</HI> Creatures, yet as <HI>Mute</HI> Per∣sons, and that these things are improved by the Ambition of the <HI>Clergy, ingrossing all things in the Church to themselves,</HI> as they did in former Ages, if the old <HI>Popedome</HI> do not return, a <HI>New One</HI> will be Erected as bad as the other.</Q> Thus far Dr. <HI>Owen.</HI></P>
