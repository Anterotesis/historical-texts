<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I <HI>Have writ the following</HI> Catechism <HI>with great freedom and clearness of Mind, and in a sense of the good hand of the Lord as∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting me, according to the measure of his hea∣venly Gift freely bestowed upon me. The service <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f it is designed not only for</HI> Children, <HI>but such others come to</HI> Age, <HI>who need, and are desirous to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e instructed in the</HI> first Principles <HI>and Grounds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the</HI> Christian Religion. <HI>The</HI> Questions <HI>are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o framed, that the</HI> Answer <HI>to every one of them is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> simple</HI> Yea <HI>or</HI> Nay, <HI>that so the understanding of he Learners may be best reached; and they may answer to many of them, rather from the Truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their Understanding, than from their Memory, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r outward Instruction; for the divine Principle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Truth, even that living Word of Truth, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laced, in some measure, in all men; and when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oings of Truth are plainly and clearly held forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Understanding of People, where the Eye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Understanding is not exceedingly blinded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the inward Ear is not greatly stopped, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord of Truth</HI> within <HI>answers to the Words and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estimonies of Truth</HI> without, <HI>as face answers

to face in Water, or as the Echo answers to the Voice of the Speaker.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>esty endeavoured to treat of the most</HI> Fundamental <HI>and</HI> Necessary Doctrines <HI>of the</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>and which I did judge most proper and suitable to those who are</HI> Young <HI>either in Tears, or in the Knowledge of the Truth, well knowing that</HI> Babes <HI>are to be fed with</HI> Milk, <HI>as</HI> strong Men <HI>with</HI> Meat; <HI>and as the good growth and thriving of Children o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>twardly, and their sound Health, doth much depend on the Milk, or other suitable Nourishment to their weak state, its being good and wholsom, so the growth of such who are as Babes in Christ, doth greatly require, that wholsom and sound Doctrine be administred unto thom; for the Spirit and Power of Christ doth accompany the sound and wholsom Doctrine, delivered by men of a sound Mind, and is that nourishing Virtue that feedeth the Soul; but where the Doctrine is not sound nor true, that pure and holy Spirit doth not joyn with it, to feed and nourish the Soul: And Doctrine and Words, without the Spirit of Christ, is as Milk or Wine that is dead, and hath not the nourishing Virtue in it. Very many of the parti∣cular Heads and Doctrines treated of, are such as are generally assented unto by most of these called</HI> Christians, <HI>of most sorts, being such as concern the common grounds of the</HI> Christian Re∣ligion, <HI>generally acknowledged by all such, whom we can in any Charity judge to be true</HI> Christians;
<PB REF="000514_0004_0FA6A8ABF7AC49F0"/>
<HI>the which seem to me to be most Necessary to be known and believed, as much or more as some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these peculiar things of difference, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Controversie, among the several sorts of the</HI> Professors of Christianity; <HI>and it were well, if these things, both of Doctrine and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that are generally assented unto by all or most sorts, were more seriously minded, recommended and improved generally, there would be more love and good Neighbourhood, and Peace among professed Christians. But when the common things and Practices of</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>generally as∣sented unto, are but too much neglected, and the particular Differences, perhaps in smaller matters, too hotly and indiscreetly, and from a zeal, without good Understanding, too much urged; and instead of seeking to heal Breaches, by running into extreams, rather to widen them; this doth hurt, and layeth a stumbling block before the weak.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The particular Differences that the Truth it self maketh, betwixt things</HI> True <HI>and</HI> False, Good <HI>and</HI> Evil, <HI>are so to be minded, and with a dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rect and godly Zeal to be contended for, that the common Grounds of</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>and the common</HI> Duties <HI>and</HI> Practices <HI>thereof, gene∣rally acknowledged, by not neglected, but duly regarded, recommended and improved; and where the things that are</HI> common matters of Faith <HI>and</HI> Practice, <HI>among all or most sorts, are the more weighty, they require to be the more

weightily regarded: And who do otherwise are greatly to be blamed, as such who take greater care of their Garments than of their Bodies, or such who are more concerned about a Finger and a Tot, to save it, than about the Head, and other prin∣cipal Members. Most of the Common Heads of</HI> Christian Doctrine, <HI>generally assented unto, are of great weight, and therefore should be greatly minded and improved by all. According to our S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>viour's Doctrine,</HI> there are the weigh∣tier matters of the Law, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Judgment, Mercy and Faith, <HI>and the lest weighty; and so in the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tters of</HI> Christian Doctrine, <HI>some are more weighty than others, and of greatest Moment, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these were duly regarded &amp; improved, and received in the love of the Truth, and a suitable walking according, to be sound among Professors of</HI> Christianity, <HI>Charity should be allow'd by them one to another, and they should look upon one another as all Disciples in one School, and under one School∣master, the</HI> Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>though diversly classed, some in a lower &amp; some in a higher degree; or as divers fields of Corn, where some fields have much more Cockle and Tare than other, yet the Corn is good where ever it is found; and it is an excel∣lent field indeed where no Cockle is to be sound, but all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wheat; and such a Church God hath promised to set up in the Earth; see</HI> Isa. 60. 21.

<P>Q. Seeing God hath delivered his Law in∣wardly in mens hearts, why did he also deliver it outwardly by <HI>Moses,</HI> was it not because of <HI>u</HI> mans weakness, that ever since the fall need∣eth outward Helps, and means of Instruction, as well as inward? <HI>A.</HI> Yea.</P>

<P>Q. Was not therefore Christ the <HI>y</HI> Mystery hid from Ages and Generations, until the full∣ness of time, and that both as to his inward and outward Coming, for most part? <HI>A.</HI> Yea.</P>

<P>It doth well become all <HI>Christians,</HI> and especially all <HI>Christian Teachers,</HI> to he well skilled in, and acquainted with the words of the holy Scriptures, throughout, that they might not only be mighty in the Spirit, but in the Scriptures also, as it is said in commenda∣tion of <HI>Apelios, That he was mighty in the Scrip∣tures,</HI> Acts 18.24.

<HEAD>A Short Paraphrase, or Open∣ing, by way of Meditation, on that Prayer which Christ taught his Disciples, com∣monly called, The Lord's Prayer.</HEAD>
<P><HI>OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN.]</HI> It is the exceeding great and unspeakable Love of God Aim, hey, that the alloweth us to call him Fa∣ther, and to come unto him, with the like confidence and freedom of Spirit, as Children come unto their Fathers, when they desire to have what they need from them. This Con∣fidence we have, through the Spirit of his Son, the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y sent into our hearts. God is indeed our Father, first, by Creation, who did create us after his own Image and Similitude, and next, by creating u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a new, and restoring n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the same, after we had fallen there-from by Transgression. We are his Off-spring, and he is nor far from us, but near unto us, for in him we live, move

and have our being. And as Heaven is his Throne, where he dwelleth, and the Earth is his Foot-stool, so as his dear Son Jesus Christ hath taughtous, <HI>his Kingdom of Heaven is in us,</HI> though not comprehended or cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by us, but far extended above all the visible Heavens, beyond all thoughts of mans understanding. And therefore when we pray unto him, our Hearts and Minds must be wrought into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> measure of a heavenly frame, by the operation of his heavenly and divine Power and Spirit revealed in us, that so we may come and draw near unto him with heavenly Minds and Affe∣ctions, putting off the Shoes of our Earthly Affections and Desires, as <HI>Moses</HI> his Servant did at his Command, when he spoke unto him at the burning Bush; for the place where we stand, when we are admitted into his presence, is holy ground; And before we speak unto him in Prayer, we must feel, in some measure, out Tongues and Lips touched with a Coal from his Altar, and our hearts therewith inflamed, and a living Voice &amp; Utterance must be given us, by the help of his holy Spirit, causing the Mouth of the Dumb to speak, the which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Voice is raised and begot in us by the heavenly in breathing and inspiration of his Spirit that cometh into us, as a heavenly and divine Air▪ and is as necessary to form the heavenly Voice that ascendeth unto Gods heavenly Thron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Temple, as the outward and natural Ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="33" REF="000514_0038_0FA6A8CF3B9403A0"/>
necessary to form the natural Voice. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he bare natural and humane Voice cannot as∣cend unto God, nor unto the Heaven where he dwelleth, so as to receive any favourable Re∣turn or Acceptance. And because God is in Heaven, and we on Earth, therefore out words, when we pray, should be few and savoury, and not as the Hypocrites, who think to be heard for their much speaking; and no further ought we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o proceed in words of Prayer, than that holy Spirit of Prayer doth enlarge us, and give the true opening of the Mouth.</P>
<P><HI>SANCTIFIED BE THE NAME.]</HI> The Name of God is most holy forever, even from Everlasting unto Everlasting. Nothing of Holiness, nor of Glory or Majesty can be added unto the same, nor diminished there-from, as in it self. But the sins of men, and the workings of the Powers of Darkness, and of Unclean Spirits and Devils, have greatly pre∣vailed in the Earth, to va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l and hide the Holi∣ness, Glory, Beauty, Majesty and Splendor of his great and honourable Name, in and among the Children of Men. The Eye that once did see him in his Glory, is miserably darkned and blinded, and the Ear that did hear his glorious Voice and Name founded forth and proclaim∣ed, is exceedingly stopt and shut in many, and Sathan hath so far prevailed with many, to make them believe, <HI>that God is no more to be seen on mens hearts, and that his Name, and
<PB N="34" REF="000514_0039_0FA6A8CFFA7F0190"/>
Word, &amp; Voice is no more to be heard upon Earth,</HI> as it was in the dayes past, when he revealed his Name in the hearts of his Servants and Children, which was both seen and heard by them and in them. We are therefore h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re taught to pray, That God would be pleased to reveal his holy Name yet more abundantly in the Earth, that his way may be known upon the Earth, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving Health in all Nations, that men, who are ignorant o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, may know him, and the Soul of those who long for him, and greatly desire to hear and see his glorious Name, may both hear and see it, and rejoyce and praise him. And thus, we are to pray, that <HI>His Name be Sanctified,</HI> that the Holyness, Power and Glory of it may be re∣vealed, and made known to many Souls, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Earth may be filled with the Knowledge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Glory, as the Waters fill and cover the Seas,</HI> as he hath graciously promised.</P>

Nor is Mankind less bound and obliged to do his Win upon Earth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is Angels are in Heaven; for he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Lord of both, he preserveth them both, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nourisheth them with suitable bread &amp; food. He feedeth the Angels with heavenly bread, and Men he feedeth, who believe and truth in him, both with heavenly bread unto their Souls, &amp; with earthly Bread unto their Bodies, so that God is sufficiently and abundantly kind unto men, according to the capacity they stand in, every one to receive his favour &amp; kindness: He offereth his Love freely unto all, and gives to every one as full and large a measure or his goodness, as they are able to receive, and if they could receive more, they should have it from his free and bountiful hand; and withal, He hath given his Servants and Children the sure Promise and Hope, <HI>That he will make them like unto the Angels at the Resurrection of the dead.</HI> And therefore men have no less cause and ground to do his Will perfectly, without any reserve, than his Angels have: His Will is most Pure and Holy, according to his most wise and holy Counsel, and most just and reasonable Laws. <HI>The Will of God is the Sanctification o his People:</HI> He requireth us not to do his Will without a regard to our good and profit; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Will is our Happiness, when we fulfill are perform it, and in obedience to the same through the Grace &amp; Power of his holy Spirit

we are made like unto him, and recover his holy Image and Likeness, and are again renew∣ed into the same, even as by sin &amp; disobedience we lost it, and fell there-from; and not only to bear the Image of the Earthly <HI>Adam,</HI> as he was before the fall, but to bear the Image of the Heavenly <HI>Adam, Christ Jesus,</HI> who never fell, and in him to possess everlasting Life and Happiness. And we believe, that we may, by his Grace, obtain what we soek, <HI>That his Will shall be done in Earth perfectly, as it is in Heaven;</HI> for he hath not taught us to pray for an impos∣sible thing, or what we do not believe that we shall or can attain unto upon Earth, and while in the mortal Body; and we have the noble &amp; excellent Pattern &amp; Example of the Lord Jesus Christ, together with the help of the holy Spirit of Promise, in our hearts, to move us to pray thus unto God who said, <HI>He came down from Heaven not to do his own Will, but the Will of the Father who sent him;</HI> and before he suffered Death on the Free of the Cross, for our sins, when his Soul was exceeding heavy unto death, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>If it be not possible, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Compass from me, not my Will, but they Will be done.</HI> We are therefore to pray, that such a Heart and Mind, like unto him, the Captain of our Sal∣vation, may be found in us, that as he denyed his own Will, which was without all sin, being conceived by the holy Ghost, &amp; brought forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Virgin, a most pure

That the Bread which we are taught to pray for, here, is not the outward Bread, is clear, because of the excel∣le t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o der of the words of this Prayer; and seeing that the Petition for the <HI>daily-Bread,</HI> go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th in order before the Petition for <HI>Forgive∣ness of Sin,</HI> it cannot be understood to be out∣ward Bread; for outward Bread is not to be deared before forgiveness of sin, but <HI>Christ,</HI> the Bread of Life, according to most excellent o der, is to be desired before Forgiveness of Sin, because we can no otherwise have our sins so given us, but as we have Christ, that hea∣venly Bread given unto us; for whoever have Christ, by a true and living faith, being united unto him, have forgiveness of sins, and none ease.</P>
<P><HI>FORGIVE US OUR SINS, AS WE FORGIVE THEM THAT SIN AGAINST US.]</HI> Untill men attain to a perfect and sin∣less state, which most are not yet arriv'd unto, divers are the sins that they fall into, through humane frailty and weakness, and therefore we need daily to pray this Prayer unto God; for granting that some have all their sins for∣given them, yet seeing many others have not, who have a measure of sincerity, (and in that respect belong to the Church of Christ) and are greatly weighted and afflicted with the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce of their sins, and the heavy burden of sin that doth lie on them, not yet removed.
