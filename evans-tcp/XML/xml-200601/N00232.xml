<HEAD>Reasons for the Inditement of the D. of York, presented to the Grand Jury of Middle∣sex, Saturday, June 26. 80. By the Persons hereunder Named.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BEcause the 25<HI>th. Car.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> when an Act was made to throw Popish Recusants out of all Offices and Places of Trust. The Duke of <HI>York</HI> did lay down several great Offices and Places (as Lord High Admiral of <HI>England, Generalissimo</HI> of all his Majesties For∣ces both by Land and Sea; Governour of the Cinque Ports; and divers others) thereby to avoid the Punishment of that Law against Papists.</P>
<P>II. 30<HI>th. Car.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> When an Act was made to disable Papists from sit∣ting in either House of Parliament; There was a <HI>Proviso</HI> inserted in that Act, <HI>That it should not extend to the Duke of</HI> York: On purpose to save his Right of sitting in the Lords House; though he refuseth to take those Oathes which the Protestant Peers ought to do.</P>
<P>III. That his Majesty in his Speech <HI>March,</HI> 6. the 31. <HI>year</HI> of his Reign, doth give for a Reason to the Parliament, why he sent his Brother out of <HI>England;</HI> because he would leave no man room to say that he had not removed all cause which might influence him to Popish Counsels.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That there have been divers Letters read in both Houses of Par∣liament, and at the secret Committees of both Houses from several Car∣dinals and others at <HI>Rome;</HI> and also from other <HI>Popish</HI> Bishops and Agents of the <HI>Pope,</HI> in other Forreign parts, which do apparently shew the great correspondencys between the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Y.</HI> and the <HI>Pope.</HI> And how the <HI>Pope</HI> could not choose but weep for joy, at the reading of some of the Dukes Letters, and what great satisfaction it was to the <HI>Pope</HI> to hear the D. was advanced to the Cath. Religion. <HI>T</HI>hat the <HI>Pope</HI> has granted <HI>Breev's</HI> to the D., sent him <HI>Beads,</HI> ample <HI>Indulgences,</HI> with much more to this purpose.</P>
<P>V. That the whole House of Commons hath declared him to be a <HI>Papist</HI> in their Votes, <HI>Sunday, April</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI> 1679. Resolved, <HI>nemine contra∣dicente,</HI> That the Duke of <HI>York's</HI> being a Papist, and the hopes of his coming such to the Crown, has given the greatest countenance and incouragement to the present Conspiracy and Designes of the Papists against the King and Protestant Religion.—What this Conspiracy and Design is, will appear by a Declaration of both Houses of Parliament, <HI>March</HI> 25. 79. Resolved, <HI>Nemine contradicente,</HI> by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament Assembled; That they do declare, That they are fully satisfied, by the proofs they have heard, there now is, and for divers years last past hath been a horrid and Treasonable Plot and Conspiracy, contrived and carried on by those of the Popish Religion, for the Murthering of his Majesties sacred Person, and for the sub∣verting the Protestant Religion, and the antient well established Government of this Realm.</P>
<P>VI.That besides all this Proof, and much more to this purpose, it is most notorious and evident he hath for many years absented himself from Protestant Churches during Religious Worship.</P>
<P>These are the Reasons why we believe the Duke of <HI>York</HI> to be a Papist.</P>
