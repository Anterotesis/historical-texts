<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly Beloved in our Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>T<HI>HE Church has provided this short</HI> Ca∣techism, or Instruction to be learn'd of every person, before he be brought to be Confirm'd by the Bishop, <HI>where∣in she teaches all things that a Christian ought to know and believe for his soul's health; and she has enjoyn'd</HI> All Fathers and Mothers, Ma∣sters and Dames to cause their Children, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See the Ru∣brick after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Catechism.</HI></NOTE> and Servants, and Prentices, to come to the Church at the time appointed, and obediently to hear, and be ordered by the Curate, until such time as they have learn'd all that is here appointed to be learn'd.</P>
<P><HI>How seasonable and necessary this Injunction is in these dayes, our woful experience does suf∣ficiently convince us, when we reflect on the grass Ignorance and Irreligion of persons in those places where</HI> Catechizing <HI>is neglected, which all sober Christians do sadly deplore.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Since then the Providence of God, who is wont to glorifie His strength in the weakness of the In∣struments He useth, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from a∣mong the meanest</HI> Herdsmen<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg"><HI>Amos.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> <HI>into the pastoral Throne, and has been pleased to commit you to my care; the love I ought to pay to the</HI> chief <HI>Shepherd,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 21. 15, 16.</NOTE><HI>obliges me to</HI> feed all His lambs &amp; His sheep <HI>that belong to

<P><HI>One thing only I most earnestly beg of you all, whether old or young, that you would help me to save your own souls; that ye would learn, and seriously consider, again and again, the terms on which your Salvation is to be had.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As for you who have Families, I beseech you to instil into your Children and Servants their Duty, both by your</HI> Teaching <HI>and your</HI> Example: <HI>In good earnest, it is less cruel unnatural to deny them bread for their mortal bodies, than saving know∣ledge for their</HI> Immortal souls.</P>
<P><HI>Ye that are Fathers or Masters, I exhort you to tread in the steps of</HI> Abraham, <HI>the Father of the faithful, and the</HI> Friend <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Jam. 2. 23.</NOTE> of God, <HI>and like him, to</HI> command <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Gen. 18. 19.</NOTE> your Children and House-holds to keep the way of the Lord.</P>

<P><HI>I passionately exhort and beseech you all, of either Sex, never to cease your conscientious zeal for their instruction, till you bring them to</HI> Confir∣mation; <HI>to renew their Baptismal vow; to make open profession of their Christianity; to discharge their Godfathers and Godmothers; to receive the solemn Benediction of the</HI> Bishop; <HI>to share in the publick Intercessions of the</HI> Church; <HI>and to partake of all the Graces of God's Holy Spirit,

<P><HI>How much the Catechism of our Church may conduce to so desirable an end, you will in some mea∣sure judge by the following</HI> Explication, <HI>as im∣perfect as it is, and which, by God's gracious Assistance, I have so contriv'd, that at one and the same time, it may both</HI> inform <HI>your</HI> Under∣standing, <HI>and</HI> raise <HI>your</HI> Affections; <HI>and that it might the better sute with every ones Leisure and Infirmities, it is Penn'd in</HI> short <HI>Forms of Devotion; to be us'd in whole, or in part, in sepa∣rate</HI> Collects <HI>or Ejaculations, or occasionally, as your spiritual necessities shall require.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN EXPOSITION ON THE CHURCH-CATECHISM, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Question. <HI>WHAT is your Name?</HI></P>
<P>Answer. <HI>N. or M.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why do you answer by that Name ra∣ther than by your <HI>Sir</HI>name?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Because it is my <HI>Christian▪</HI> Name, and was given me when I was made a Christian, and puts me in mind both of the <HI>Happiness &amp; Duty</HI> of a Christian.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Hap∣piness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christian.</HI></NOTE> Where do you learn the Happiness and the Duty of a Christian?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The very next Answer teaches me the Happiness,, and all the rest of the Catechism, the Duty of a Christian.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Who gave you this Name?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>My Godfathers &amp; my Godmothers in my Bap∣tism, wherein I was made a member of Christ, a child of God, &amp; an Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000445_0006_0FA5ABDFF76D9B10"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> Shew me from hence the Happiness of a Christian.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Happiness of a good Christian, is altogether unutterable; he is one who hath Christ for his <HI>Head,</HI> God for his <HI>Father,</HI> and Heaven with all its joys &amp; glories, which are all eternal, for his <HI>Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Shew me, on the Contrary, the condi∣tion of a <HI>bad</HI> Christian.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The misery of a bad Christian is altoge∣ther insupportable; he has Christ for his <HI>Enemy,</HI> the Devil for his <HI>Father,</HI> and Hell (with all its miseries, and torments, &amp; despair, which are all eternal) for his Doom.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Christi∣an's Choice.</HI></NOTE> Which of these conditions do you chuse?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I adore the goodness of God, who has <HI>set before</HI> me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Deut.</HI> 30, 19.</NOTE><HI>life and death, blessing and cursing;</HI> and in great compassion to my soul, has bid me <HI>chuse life;</HI> and with all my heart I chuse life, even life eternal.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Are there not many in the world that chuse <HI>Death?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is too too visible there are: Such is the extreme madness and folly of obstinate Sin∣ners, that they chuse the service of the <HI>De∣vil</HI> before the Service of GOD, and <HI>Hell</HI> be∣for Heaven: the Damnation of such men is holly from themselves <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k.</HI> 23. 11.</NOTE>, and having chosen death, even death eternal it is most just with God to give them their choice.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hos.</HI> 13. 9.</NOTE> Blessed be God who has given you grace to make a right Choice: Tell me what you must do to <HI>obtain</HI> that which you have chosen, Life eternal?</P>

others, the proper Evangelical Grace; and eternal Truth has assur'd me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 10. 27, 28.</NOTE>, <HI>This do, and tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shalt live,;</HI> So that if I truly love God, I shall live beloved <HI>by</HI> God to all Eternity.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The nature of Love.</HI></NOTE> Tell me wherein the Love of God doth Consist.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Love of God is a Grace rather to be <HI>felt</HI> than desin'd, so that I can do no more than rudely describe it: It is the general Inclination and Tendency of the whole man, of all his heart, and soul, and strength; of all his powers and af∣fections, and of the utmost <HI>strength</HI> of them all to GOD, as his Chief, and only and perfect, and infinite Good.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is this Love of God taught in the Cate∣chism?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Catechism having in the entrance of it presented to our Choice the Happiness of a Chrstian, does throughout all the remaining parts of it instruct us in the Duties of a Christian, by which that Happiness is to be attain'd, which are all summ'd up in the <HI>Love of God,</HI> which is here most methodically taught. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The method of Love.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> In what method does the Catechism teach the Love of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In a method so excellent and natural, that if by God's help, I can but faithfully observe it, I shall not fail of the Love of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Explain this method to me.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It teaches me how the Love of God is pro∣duced, how practised, and how preserved.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Shew me more distinctly in what part of the Catechism each of these particulars is cought.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> desire the Love of God, I must first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all contrary Loves out of my heart, and then consider the motives and causes that ex∣cite
<PB N="4" REF="000445_0008_0FA5ABE0D209DFC8"/>
it, the former is taught in the Vow of Bap∣tism, the latter in the Creed.</P>
<P>When divine Love is once produc'd, my next care is to put it in practice, and that is by bring∣ing forth the fruits, or effects of Love, which are all contained in the Ten Commandments.</P>
<P>When the Love of God is produc'd in my heart, and is set on work, my last concern is to pre∣serve, and ensure, and quicken it: It is preserv∣ed by Prayer, the pattern of which is the <HI>Lord's Prayer:</HI> It is ensured to us by the Sacraments which are the Pledges of Love; and more particu∣larly it is quickened by the Holy <HI>Eucharist,</HI> which is the <HI>Feast of Love:</HI> So that the plain order of the Catechisme teacheth me the rise, the progress, and the perfection of Divine Love, which God of His great mercy give me Grace to follow!</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I Beseech God to give you the Grace you pray for, that you may prosecute this method with your <HI>he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> as well as with your words.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is the full purpose of my Soul so to doe, and I trust in God I shall do it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You are to begin with the Vow you made at your Baptism: Tell me,</P>
<P><HI>What did your Godfathers and Godmothers then for you?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>They did promise and vow three things in my name:</HI></P>
<P><HI>First, That I should renounce the Devil and all his works, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Expulsion of contrary Loves in our Baptis∣mal Vow.</NOTE> the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, That I should believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And Thirdly, That I should keep God's holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the same all the days of my Life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="000445_0009_0FA5ABE190219F98"/>
Q. <HI>Dost thou not think thou art bound to believe and doe as they have promised for thee?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>Yes verily, and by God's help, so I will, and I heartily thank our heavenly Father, that He hath call∣ed me to this state of Salvation, through Jesus Christ our Saviour. And I pray unto God to give me His Grace, that I may continue in the same unto my lives end.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> The Promises of Faith and Obedience, which you made in your Baptism, will be mention'd in their proper places, when you come to the <HI>Creed,</HI> and to the <HI>Decalogue:</HI> that which now lies before you is, to shew how your Abre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unciation is pre∣paratory to the Love of God.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As all particular Graces are but the <HI>Love of God,</HI> varied by different instances and rela∣tions, so all particular <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> are nothing but <HI>Concu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> or the love of some one <HI>creature</HI> or another, in competition <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> or opposition <HI>to</HI> the Love of God: Now all the Creatures on which we set our Love, are reducible to these three, the <HI>De∣vil,</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Flesh;</HI> and my heart must be emptied of these impure Loves; before it is capable of Entertaining the pure Love of God.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> If you are conscious to your self, that you have entertained these impute Loves, and have violated your Baptismal Vow, and have in your heart renounced <HI>GOD,</HI> instead of renouncing His Enemies, what must you do to recover that Fa∣vour of God you have lost, and to be deliver'd from the wrath to come▪</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I must through<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of all the breaches of my Vow, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Repentance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Vow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></NOTE> and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> renew it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Express your Repentance for breaking it.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I express it thus:</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="000445_0010_0FA5ABE3D45B70E8"/>
O Lord God, with shame, and sorrow, and confusion of Face, I confess and acknowledge, thy Infinite mercy and Goodness to <HI>me,</HI> my infinite <HI>vileness</HI> and Ingratitude to <HI>Thee.</HI></P>

<P>Thou Lord didst vouchsafe, of a miserable sin∣ner, to make me a member of my Saviour, Thy own Child, and an Heir of Heaven; Glory be to Thee!</P>
<P>I infinitely wicked and unworthy, have despis'd and rejected and forfeited all the inestimable bless∣ings, to which I was Entitled by my Baptisme; Lord have mercy upon me!</P>
<P>Woe is me, wretch that I am, I have cut my self off by my Sins, from being a true <HI>Member of Christ'</HI>s mystical Body, and from all the gracious Influences I might have derived from my Union to Him; Lord have mercy upon me!</P>
<P>Woe is me, wretch that I am, I have by my numerous provocations, lost that holy Spirit of Adoption, whereby I might become Thy <HI>Child,</HI> O God, and call Thee Father, and am become a child of wrath; Lord have mercy upon me.</P>
<P>Woe is me, wretch that I am, I have by my own willful impiety, disclaimed my being an <HI>Inhe∣ritour of the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> and am become an Heir to the Kingdom of Darkness; Lord have mercy upon me!</P>

<P>O Lord God, most gracious and reconcileable, Pitty and pardon me.</P>
<P>I lament, O Lord God, my detestable impi∣ety, for having so long, and so often, and so obsti∣nately offended Thee.</P>

<P N="3">111. <HI>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath Day. Six days shalt thou Labour, and do all that thou hast to do, but the Seventh Day is the Sab∣bath of the Lord thy God: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou shalt do no manner of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, thou, and thy Son, and thy Daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thy Cattel, and the stranger that is within thy gates.

<P>O my good God, keep me alwaies thine, and let nothing ever divorce me from thy Love.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You have laid down proper Rules for inter∣preting the Commandments, Shew me now how they are divided.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Into two sorts or Tables, suitable to the two respects they have, to GOD, and to our Neighbour.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI>Begin with the First Table, and shew me the Number and Order of the Commands which it contains.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI>It contains the four first Commands which relate to God, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The First Table.</HI></NOTE> and to teach us the worship <HI>of</HI> God, even that Reverential Love we are to pay to God, which naturally arises from a true sense of His infinite both Goodness and Greatness.</P>
<P>This Worship of God is either inward or out∣ward.</P>
<P>The <HI>inward</HI> Worship, being that of the <HI>Heart,</HI> is the nobler of the two, and this, together with the right Object of our worship is taught in the first Commandment, as the Foundation of all the rest.</P>
<P>The <HI>outward</HI> is compris'd in the three follow∣ing, which teach us the Regulation of God's Worship in reference to our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in the <HI>Se∣cond,</HI> to our <HI>Tongues</HI> in the <HI>Third,</HI> to our <HI>Time</HI> in the <HI>Fourth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Which are the Duties of the Second Table?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are the six remaining Commands which do all relate to our Neighbour; of which I shall speak in their due place.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="000445_0051_0FA5AC1721233720"/>
<HI>Q.</HI> What have you further to observe of the Commandments in general?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 'Tis observable that those which refer to God are put <HI>first,</HI> to teach us that the Love of God is the chief and original Command, and ought chiesy to be studied; and to teach us also, that all the Duties of the Second Table must yield to the First, when-ever they stand in any Compe∣tition <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Luc.</HI> 14. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Go over all the Ten Commandments in par∣ticular, and shew me how they are all the genuine Fruits and Effects of Divine Love, exercis'd ei∣ther in Doing Good, or Eschewing Evil.</P>

<HEAD>To the poor Inhabitants within the Diocess of Bath and Wells, THOMAS their unworthy Bishop, wisheth the Knowledge and the Love of GOD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly Beloved in our LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Chatechism truly teaches all Christians that they are <HI>not able of themselves to do those things</HI> they have vowed in their Baptism to do, namely, <HI>To walk in the Command∣ments of God, and to serve Him, without His Special Grace,</HI> or favourable Assistance, and this <HI>they are to learn at all times to call upon God for, by diligent Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>How good and seasonable this advice is, you will all see, if you consider what helpless and needy Creatures the very <HI>best</HI> of men are. Alas! our weakness is very great, our wants are very many, our Dependance on God for all things all our lives long, is entire, and absolute, and necessary, and there is no way in the world to gain Help and Supplies from God, but by Prayer; so that it is as easie. and as possible to preserve a natural Life without daily Bread, as a Christian Life without daily Prayer.</P>
<P>It was for this Reason that our Saviour Himself took a par∣ticular care, to teach His Disciples to pray <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lue.</HI> 11. 1.</NOTE>: and it is for the same Reason, and in imitation of our Heavenly Master, that I have joyned these <HI>Directions for Prayer</HI> to the Catechism.</P>
<P>Sure I am, the Zeal I ought to have for your Salvation, can suggest to me nothing more Conducing to the Good of your Souls, than to Exhort and Beseech you all, of either Sex,
<PB N="106" REF="000445_0110_0FA5AD8B9CF8F248"/>
to learn how to Pray.</P>
<P>This is the first general Request I shall make to you, and I am the more earnest in it, because my own sad Experience has taught me, how strangely ignorant common people usually are of this Duty; insomuch that some never pray at all, pretending they were never taught, or that their memories are bad, or that they are not Book-learn't, or that they want mony to buy a Book; and by this means they live and dye rather like Beasts than Men; nay, their Condition is much worse than that of Beasts, for the misery of a Beast doth end at death, but the Misery of a wicked man does then begin, and will endure to all Eternity.</P>
<P>To prevent then as much as lies in me the Damnation of those souls which God has committed to my Care, and to cure that lamentable Ignorance and Forgetfulness of GOD, which is the cause of the Damnation of so very many, I do not only incessantly pray for you my self, but I beg of you all to pray for your selves, and I beseech you to read the following Instructions; or if you cannot read your selves, to get some honest charitable Neighbours to read them▪ often to you, that you may remember them, and God of His Great Mercy reward the Charity of such Neighbours.</P>
<P>If any of you, either by your own Negligence, or by the Neg∣ligence of your parents, or for want of Catechising in your Parish, are wholly ignorant of your Duty: tho it be a most shameful and dangerous thing, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who calls himself a Christian, to know nothing of Christ or Christianity; yet if you are willing to learn, and beg pardon of God for your wilful ignorance hi∣therto, and will sincerely do your endeavour to get saving Know∣ledge, and heartily pray to God to assist you, you shall find, that the very <HI>Entrance of God's Word giveth light, that it giveth Under∣standing unto the Simple</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 130.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I must warn you before hand, that corrupt Nature will be very busie in hindering the learning of your Duty and Thoughts will arise in your mind that the Task will be too hard and too tedious for you to undertake; but I faithfully promise you, to
<PB N="107" REF="000445_0111_0FA5AD8C6FE94628"/>
impose no hard or tedious Task on you, but such as you your selves shall confess to be very complying with your Infirmities; for our most compassionate Saviour teaches me to say no more to you than <HI>you can bear</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh.</HI> 16. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All I shall exhort you to, is, to learn your Catechism, which you may do by degrees; if you learn but a line or two in a day, you will by God's Blessing, in a very short time learn it all over, and you will rejoice, and thank God, for the sudden and happy pro∣gress you have made.</P>
<P>God forbid you should ever think your selves too old to learn to serve GOD, and to be Saved, both which are taught in the Catechism, and therefore the Catechism is of necessity to be learn∣ed: for how can you go to heaven if you never learn'd the way thither? How can you be saved if you do not know your Saviour?</P>
<P>'Tis a great Error, to think that the Catechism was made for Children only, for all Christians are equally concern'd in those saving Truths which are there taught; and the Doc∣trine delivered in the Catechism, is as proper for the Study, and as necessary for the Salvation of a great Doctor, as of a weak Christian or a young Child.</P>
<P>But you will be the more encouraged to learn your Cate∣chism, when you see how excellent a help it will be to prayer, for it will at the same time further your Knowledge and your Devotion, both together; and the prayers I intend to com∣mend to you, are chiefly the very▪ Answers in the Catechism, which being daily repeated, will be the better fix't in your me∣mory, and you cannot imagine any advice for Prayer can be more easie, and Familiar, than that which directs you to turn your very <HI>Catechism</HI> into prayers.</P>
<P>You are by this time (I hope) satisfied, that the Duty to which I exhort you, is no hard task; and yet I will endeavour, by God's Assistance, to make it more easie, by putting you into an easie Method to attain it.</P>
<P>If you are wholly ignorant of your Catechism, let it be your first care to learn such Ejaculations, such short prayers as these, and say them often and heartily.</P>

<P>Such short Prayers as these you may easily get by heart, and the method in which I advise you to proceed, is, that in which <HI>Children</HI> are commonly taught, in regard I am now to look on you as a Child: for there are two sorts of Children; there are Children in Age, and Children in <HI>Understanding</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 20.</NOTE>, and in this latter respect you are Children, and the same method, for the most part, is proper for you, which is proper for those that are Children in age.</P>
<P>I must therefore feed you <HI>with Milk,</HI> before you can be ca∣pable of <HI>strong meat</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 5. 13.</NOTE>, and I must look on you as <HI>Lambs</HI> of my Flock, which I am to use tenderly, and these following Di∣rections which I give to parents▪ for the training up their Chil∣dren in Piety, I do equally design for the training up of you. God of His infinite Goodness, bless them to you both.</P>
<P>I exhort all you who are parents, to instil good things into your Children, as soon as ever they begin to speak; let the first words they utter, if possible, be these, <HI>Glory be to God.</HI> Ac∣custom them to repeat these words on their knees, as soon as they Rise, and when they go to bed, and oft times in the day; and let them not eat or drink, without saying, <HI>Glory be to God.</HI></P>
<P>As their Speech grows more plain and easie to them, Teach them who Made, and Redeem'd, and Sanctified them, and for what End, Namely, to Glorifie and to Love GOD; and with∣al, teach them some of the shortest Ejaculations you can, such as these;</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="000445_0113_0FA5AD924BEEB000"/>
<HI>Lord help me, Lord save me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord have Mercy upon me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All Love, all Glory be to God, who first loved me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord keep me in Thy love.</HI></P>
<P>Within a little time you may teach them the Lord's Prayer, and hear them say it every day, Morning and Evening, on their knees, with some one or more of the fore-going Ejaculations; and by degrees as they grow up, they will learn the Creed, and the whole Catechism.</P>
<P>Be sure to teach your Children with all the sweetness and gentleness you can, lest if you should be severe, or should over∣task them, Religion should seem to them, rather a Burden than a Blessing.</P>
<P>As their Knowledge encreases, so let their Prayers encrease▪ al∣so, and teach them as they go to turn their Catechism into Pray∣ers, after the manner which I shall shew you, and to Confirm and improve their Knowledge, bring them duly to the Church to be Catechised by the parish Priest, that by his familiar and de∣vout Explications of the Catechism, they may learn to understand it, and may be capable of Reading the Exposition on it, and other Books of Piety.</P>
<P>Take conscientious Care to Season your Children as early as you can, with the Love of GOD, which is <HI>the first and great Commandment</HI><NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 22. 38.</NOTE>, and with <HI>the Fear of God</HI> which <HI>is the Be∣ginning of wisdom</HI><NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 111. 10.</NOTE>; for the awful Love, and the Filial Fear of God, must always go together.</P>
<P>The same method you take in teaching your Children, the same you may observe in teaching your Servants, according as you see they want Teaching, and you your selves will reap the Benefit of it, as well as your servants; for the more devout Servants they are of GOD, the more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aithful Servants will they be to you.</P>
<P>Remember, You must teach both your Children and Servants by your Example, as well as by your Instruction, for they learn best by Example; and if they see you give an example of Fraud, or Lying, of Revenge or Calumny, of Uncleanness or Drun∣kenness,
<PB N="110" REF="000445_0114_0FA5AD9272C38390"/>
of Cursing and Swearing and Irreligion; instead of teaching them to obey God, you teach them to <HI>Provoke</HI> Him; instead of Teaching them to honour God, you teach them to <HI>Blaspheme</HI> Him; instead of leading them the way to Heaven, you lead them the way to <HI>Hell;</HI> and you will increase your own Damnation, by furthering theirs, which God forbid you should ever do.</P>
<P>Now that you may the better give a good Example to your Family, I will by Gods help give you a Method of Daily Devo∣tion, taken for the most part out of the Catechism, which will be suitable to all Christians, be they never so well instructed, &amp; which you may by little &amp; little teach your childrens, and which those who have been bred up in Ignorance, and are Children in Understanding, and yet willing to be taught, may learn to say also, as the capacities of either do increase; for a Christian must never stand at a stay, but must be always <HI>growing in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</HI><NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 18.</NOTE>.</P>

Instead of these two last Prayers, you may sometimes say the Ten Commandments, which you may turn into a very good prayer, by saying after every one,</P>
<P><HI>Lord have Mercy upon me, and encline my heart to keep this Law.</HI></P>
<P>Where you not only beg pardon for the sins you have com∣mitted against each Commandment, but you also beg Grace to keep it.</P>
<P>At the end of them you may say,</P>
<P><HI>Lord have Mercy upon me, and write all these thy Laws in my heart, I beseech Thee.</HI></P>
<P>And so conlude with the <HI>Lord's Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>Do not think that this practice of Prayer will be too hard, or too long for young persons, or for labouring people; for if you cannot say them all, say as much as you can; or if you are at day-Labour, and have not Time or Convenience to say them, offer up to God two or three hearty Ejaculations in their place. But if you can get time &amp; convenience, say them all: And I dare assure you, that all the three Forms of Prayer which I commend to you, will not in all take up a Quarter of an hour: and cer∣tainly, that person has very little sense of his Duty, very little concern for his immortal soul, very little Honour for God, or va∣lue for Heaven, who will not spend one quarter of an hour in the space of four and twenty hours, in the Service of God, and the Salvation of his own soul.</P>
<P>I do by all means exhort you, to give your Servants a few mi∣nutes leisure at noon, to pray after your Example, and to use your Children to do the same, for they will soon be able to say the Lord's Prayer, and two or three Ejaculations, and teach them to say these at Noon, as well as at morning &amp; at night, and 'tis incredible to think, how much good this practice will do them, and what great comfort you your selves will reap from the early Devotion of your Children.</P>
<P>To further this Devotion in your Children, instead of idle Tales, and Songs, which pollute their souls, and when they come
<PB N="116" REF="000445_0120_0FA5AD99D1931D70"/>
to be serious, will cost them great pains to unlearn. You must teach them short Psalms by heart, which will excercise their Memories and Piety, both together; and as you teach the Psalms to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I exhort you to learn them <HI>your selves.</HI></P>
<P>You cannot imagine the great benefit of learning Psalms by heart, for when you are under any Temptation, or are in any Affliction, or when you lye waking in the Night, or when you are sick, these Psalms will come into your mind, and the devout Repeating them will yield you most seasonable Conso∣lations.</P>
<P>The very Common People, in the first and purest Ages of the Church, were so sensible of the spiritual Advantages of learning Psalms, that they learn'd the whole Psalter by heart, and sang or said the Psalms in their Shops and at the plow, insomuch that St. <HI>James</HI> makes it the proper Expression of Christi∣an-Mirth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Jam</HI> 5. 13.</NOTE>, <HI>If any be merry, let him sing Psalms.</HI></P>
<P>This is the way to store your own and your Childrens minds with Ejaculations, or short Prayers for all Occasions, which I advise both Old and Young to accustom themselves to, because it is the true way of Praying without ceasing, and it is a kind of Prayer most easie, and may be used at any time of the day, or in any place, and is one of the most efficaci∣ous means in the world to keep us in Gods Favour, which is of all things most desirable.</P>
