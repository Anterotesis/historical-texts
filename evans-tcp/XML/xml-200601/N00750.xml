<Q><BIBL><HI>Ecclesiastes the XII. Verse the I.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me not, nor the years draw nigh, when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shalt say I have no pleasure in them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Book of <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> was wrote by <HI>Soloman</HI> in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Years (as is supposed by most Interpreters) as a Recantation, and Penitential, after he had spent the youthful part of his days in the fullest enjoyments of the things of this life. This Person had the largest Soul and greatest share of understanding that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was given to the Sons of Men. And as he had Wisdom to find out, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had Power answerable to his Wisdom, to procure whatsoever could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> delightful, and pleasing in this World. And being thus furnished with Wisdom and Power, he accordingly set himself to enquire, what was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Good</HI> for the Sons of Men, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght make them happy. And then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> length upon a full Experience of all that this World can afford us, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="2" REF="000904_0004_0FAC9C40A26CE590"/>
us so, he gives us this testimony of it, that it is all but <HI>vanity and vexat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of spirit;</HI> of a frail, empty, perishing and unsatisfying Nature▪ na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is blended with much of sorrowful and vexatious mixtures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that this World can afford us. This he does in the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first <HI>Chapte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>Haman Wisdom, Riches, Honours</HI> and <HI>Pleasures</HI> the great things wherein most Men place their chiefest happyness. And then he proceeds, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> last <HI>Chapters</HI> to let us know wherein our true and onely Felicity really does consist, and that he tells us is in this, that we <HI>fear God, and keep his Commandments,</HI> as that which will yield us solid Comfort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Satisfaction in this life, besides the joyful expectations it will give us in the next.</P>
<P>AND having done this he does then very affectionately address him∣self to young Persons in the words of my Text, that taking it upon his word and experience, the truth of what he had before said, as to the mere <HI>vanity</HI> of all Earthly Enjoyments, and the true satisfaction there is in the <HI>fear of God;</HI> they would not make it their whole business to pursue the empty Enjoyments of this World, which would certainly disappoint them; but betake themselves to an early Piety, so acceptable and well pleasing to their Maker, before Sickness and Old Age force them, whe∣ther they will, or no, to make an unwilling, and a loathed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acrifice of themselves to him. <HI>Remember now</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>SO that these you see, are the kind Admonitions of a Charitable Per∣son (who himself had once been sadly shipwrack'd in a gulf of sensuality &amp; filthyness, they are his kind warnings to you that are younger Persons, to avoid the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Errors; But to betake your selves seriously to the neces∣sary business of Religion betimes, and to make it your first, and earliest choice; to engage your selves in Gods service in your more <HI>youthful, healthier,</HI> and <HI>active days;</HI> and not to defer this weighty Affair, till you are sick, or are broken by the infirmities of Old Age, when it is hardly to be expected that He should at all accept of so heartless, and languid a Service, as we can then pay him.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Solomon</HI> tho a great King, yet being withal a <HI>Preacher,</HI> as he pleases <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o stile himself <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.1. it might be seasonable for him at any time to give so necessary and so impor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant Instruction, as this in my Text. But especially it became him, after so dear an experience, as his own had
<PB N="3" REF="000904_0005_0FAC9C4164BEB530"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of the <HI>vanities,</HI> and follies of youth; particularly to apply himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem. And the case is in some measure the like with us at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>HERE is nothing which is more incumbent upon the Ministers of Gods Church at all times, than to form the principles, and manners of youth, as may appear from that Emphatical Charge of our Saviours to St. <HI>Peter John</HI> 22.15. and in him to all other the Apostles, and Ministers in his Church. <HI>Feed my lambs.</HI> But now at this time especially, we of the Clergy in this Province, have more than an ordinary Call to apply our selves particularly to this Duty.</P>
<P>FOR why? It is now that the Patriots of this Country are giving that Establishment by Law to Religion amongst them; and with that Unanimity, and general Consent, which shews that it is no indifferent thing to them, And this they do so nobly express, In such words, as indeed deserve to be written (both for the perpetual Honour of this Pro∣vince, and for a Memorandum to us of the Clergy, to what purposes we are establish'd) in <HI>Letters of Gold,</HI> on <HI>Pillars of Marble.</HI></P>
<P>IT is for this End they declare they do this glorious Work, that their CHILDREN AND POSTERITY BEING PRESERVED IN THE UNITY OF THE CHURCH, FROM FACTION AND SCHISM, IN HONESTY AND CHARITY, MAY BECOME GOOD AND SOBER MEN, LOVING VIRTUE, FLYING VICE, THE RATI∣ONAL CONS<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>QUENCE OF TRUE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE. And sure then, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f for this reason principally a Clergy are to be here esta∣blish'd; to this work therefore it is in a more especial manner, that they are call'd to exert their Labours, as a most important part of their Ministry.</P>
<P>Well! I can venture here to promise for all those my Brethren, over whom I preside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that with these terms they will heartily comply, and to answer those expectations every one of them shall make it his principal Care. And as the Call we have to this Duty is <HI>extraordinary,</HI> so the me∣thods, which shall be taken, will be more than <HI>common</HI>; so that not one∣ly the Children shall be instructed in the Elements of Christianity, by learning their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by heart; Together with some short <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it; But the youth that are come up to years of Discre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="000904_0006_0FAC9C422548DC60"/>
therefore more capable to receive a more through knowledge in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Doctrines of the Christian Religion, and of their Covenant wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall be taken care of by such a method of instruction in the way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>liar Conference,</HI> as will,, I am perswaded, when try'd by them, be as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleasing, as it will be found profitable to all of them.</P>
<P>BUT then the execution of this grand part of the Ministers Duty will be impossible for them without the concurrence of those committed to their charge, respectively. The persons to be thus Catechis'd and in∣structed are of two sorts, <HI>Children,</HI> and <HI>grown Youth.</HI> The former are uncapable of knowing the benefit of such instructions, so as to be indu∣ced of themselves to desire, or seek the means thereof; and those there∣fore must be brought, oblig'd, and if occasion shall be, must be ordered and made to come to be Catechised, by their respective Parents, and Masters, whose duty it is, with <HI>Joshua,</HI> to take care, <HI>that they, and their house serve the Lord.</HI> And I have great reason to hope that this charge will be duly performed by Parents and Masters throughout the Province, being the Chief persons in the several parts thereof, and whose example therefore will be sufficient to influence others, have so solemnly declar'd to the World, that the end wherefore they Establish Religion is, that their <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Posterity</HI> may be train'd up in it.</P>
<P>THE great work will be to perswade <HI>Youth of riper years</HI> to yeild up themselves to the Tutelage, and Instruction of their respective Pastors, Since that Youth too commonly are vain, headstrong, and averse to serious Admonitions. But besides that the methods which will be taken with them, shall be so free and familiar, as I dare say, would not be disa∣greeable to such as are most advanc'd in years; In order to prepare them to be more complyant with the perswasions therewith of their respective Pastors, I shall make it my present business to engage them especially to an early entertainment, and choice of Religion. In the management of which duty of theirs, I will endeavour by Gods Assistance, to do these two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By way of explication I will shew them wherein the duty consists, and what it is to Remember our Creator.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By way of motive I will shew them how very advantagious it will be ac∣cordingly
<PB N="5" REF="000904_0007_0FAC9C42E28F3E88"/>
to Remember their Creator in the days of their youth; and on the other hand, how exceeding dangerous to defer it to the evil days, the days of sick∣ness, or of old age; those days we our selves have no pleasure in.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND first, let us consider the duty, what it is to Remember our Crea∣tor.</HI></P>
<P>AND to <HI>Remember our Creator</HI> is of the number of those Scripture ex∣pressions, that do imply in the meaning of them, the whole Sum, and Substance of Religion. Thus to <HI>know God,</HI> to <HI>believe in him,</HI> to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear him,</HI> and <HI>to love him,</HI> do all of 'em import no less in Scripture many times, than to be entirely Religious; because that Knowledge, Faith, Fear, and Love are powerful, and active principles within us, influencing those who are possessed therewith, to be in the whole frame of their mind, and will, entirely Religious. And of the same nature is this expression also <HI>Rememember your Creator.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>Remember our Creator</HI> does necessarily suppose a due knowledge of him, for that it is impossible to <HI>remember,</HI> or call to mind what we ne∣ver had any knowledge of. Now Almighty God may be known by his Creatures both in his Nature and Attributes; and in his works of Crea∣tion, Providence, and of Grace; and in those excellent and gracious Laws which he has given to us to govern our Lives and Conversations in this World. And in all these respects it ought to be the chief study of Mankind (whom above all inferiour Creatures he has made capable of such knowledge) thus to know him; especially it concerns Youth to furnish themselves with such knowledge of their Creator betimes, as it is ordered them, and as they are advised here in my Text. <HI>Remember thy Creator, in the days of thy youth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND now if we would know him as to his Nature and Attributes, what other is he, than the supreme Governour of the World, whose knowledge reaches to all things past, present, and to come; which pier∣ces into the most secret Councels and Contrivances of our Hearts; and takes our thoughts in their first motions, even before we our selves have found them, whose Wisdom has allways in its Eye the best Ends, and does often bring about his wise Purposes by means most improbable to our seemings! whose Goodness permits him not to slave his Creatures
<PB N="6" REF="000904_0008_0FAC9C43A15D4280"/>
with rigorous, and unreasonable Impositions. (He commands, nor for∣ces any to tear their Skins with their Nails, to cut their Flesh wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h their Knives, as the worshipers of <HI>Baal</HI> did. He is not so delighted with the reaking streams of Hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Gore, that he would have us sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rifice our Sons, and Daughters to him) But his Commands are all Righteous, Just, and Reasonable; every way fittest for us as Rational Creatures to perform; and every way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending to perfect our Natures to the high∣est pitch of Happyness that Humanity can reach. As a Branch of his Goodness, we may justly add to his Patience, which we may with A∣mazement behold in the Repeated, Continu'd, and in the Numberless Provoca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons, Insolences, and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring Wickednesses of a Profligate, Lewd and Atheistical World. But whose Justice we shall not onely see, but feel, feel in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tmost Severities and Strokes that long abus'd Mercies, that wearied, and tired Patience (tired with forbearing I mean) can lay on, If we will st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll remain Obstinate Rebels to his Laws. Not to speak of his Power, which is never wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting, to what his Will is to perform, or inflict.</P>
<P>Such is our <HI>Creator</HI> in his Nature, and Attributes; such he is in him∣self, and such he will more manifestly appear to us if we shall but medi∣tate upon his <HI>glorious Works</HI> of <HI>Creation, Providence,</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Con∣sider those Excellent and Gracious Laws he has given us to govern our Lives and Conversations in this World.</HI></P>
<P>HIS <HI>Creation</HI>! and Good God! what astonishing Power was his! which, with one Word of his Mouth could call forth out of Nothing, the whole frame of Nature which we behold; rhis Earth which we now tread upon, and yonder Heavens also, which we hope ere long to mount into! And what depth of Wisdom was that, which amongst the Millions of Creatures that he has given Being to, has not made one thing for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought, but all to serve some good End; most of them at least service∣able to the use of Man, and he, to Serve and Glorify his Creator.</P>
<P>WHAT shall I say of his <HI>Providence</HI>? Is not that Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness, and every thing, which preserves us in Being, which pro∣tects us from Dangers, which provides for our Necessities, and which in a Thousand In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ances we see, is careful of us, and bountiful unto us!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000904_0009_0FAC9C446206FFA0"/>IT would take up more than our present time will afford, should I attempt to display his Power, and Wisdom, his Goodness, and Justice, and all his Attributes as they were manifested in his works of Grace, in that Stupendous Bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness of Man's Redemption. Ch how did <HI>Mercy and Truth here meet together, how did Righteo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sness and Peace here kiss each other</HI>! Mercy! was ever Goodness like unto that, which pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng by the fallen Race of Angels, should take us a desperately wicked, and Rebel∣lious Generation into Favour again, on the reasonable conditions we would return to him! Righteousness! was ever Justice and Holyness so manifested, that nothing could attone for our sins less than the Blood of the Son of God! But there would be no end of our Meditations should we once launch out into that Ocean of his Love, and Goodnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as they were seen in the Redemption of us. To hasten therefore to the consideration of them as they were seen in his <HI>Government and Laws.</HI></P>
<P>AND sure Gratiousness, and Goodness were never known in any Governour, if not in God, who has not given us one Precept, but which either tends to the health of our Bodies, or the quiet of our Minds; to pre∣serve Peace in societies, and Love in Neighbourhoods; and which does no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some way or other tend both to perfect, and to render us like unto God here, and to make us happy with him hereafter.</P>
<P>AND so much for the first thing imply'd in this Duty, which is, to <HI>Know our Creator.</HI> To Remember our Creator does necessarily suppose a due knowledge of him; for that it is impossible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Remember, or call to mind what we never had any knowledge of. And what it is to know him, and the necessity of it, you have been now told.</P>
<P N="2">II. AND having thus gaind a Competent Knowledge of our Creator, of his Nature and Attributes; especially as manifested in his works, and in his Laws; It may be easily gathered what it is to <HI>Remember our Crea∣tor thus known.</HI> And what else pray can it be, than always to have a Sense of him in our Hearts and Souls, to have a due Regard to him, to set him always before our Eyes as thus known; and so demean, and de¦port ourselves in reference to him, as is suitable to him, and is fit for us?</P>
<P>TO Remember a Person is not barely to call him to Mind, or to
<PB N="8" REF="000904_0010_0FAC9C4521708430"/>
think of him, but it imply's something more. Scripture Expressions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>hearty</HI> Expre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions, and tho' they are sometimes such as literally sig∣nify some Act of the Mind, yet generally they imply an equal share of the Will and Affections. And indeed such is this Phrase to <HI>Remember our Creator</HI> in vulgar and common Acceptation. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I were bid to Re∣member a Person Understanding and Wise, that sees what I do, and were present with me, I should take it as a caution to act Circumspectly, and carefully in his presence. If I were bid to Remember a good and kind Friend, I should take it as a prompting of me to be grateful to him, and to return him Love and Thankfulness for all his Kindnesses. If I were bid to Remember a severe and upright Judge, I should take it as a warn∣ing to live so honestly, and uprightly as not to come under the severity of his Justice. And lastly, if to Remember one of great and uncontrowl∣able Power, as an Intimation not to offend him. And accordingly such must be the Importance of our Duty, and the Phrase expressing it, Re∣member thy Creator here in my Text. He being Infinite in Knowledge, what can it else imply but that we every where walk before him in Sin∣cerity and Truth, as before one that seeth in secret? Being of unsearch∣able Wisdom▪ knowing both what is best for us▪ and what means ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> best to compass it, ten thousand times better than we can, what else can it mean, but that we entirely resign up ourselves to his disposals, and never murmur under any of his Dispensations? Being he is of abundant Goodness, Good∣ness that knows no bounds, but what his other Attributes necessarily give it; of such Goodness as to give us the best, and most easy Laws, to accept of such Obedience as we are able to pay him▪ and to recompence that little with Rewards so infinitely beyond the Merits of our Performances; when we are bid to Remember him, what else can it import, but that we love him to the intensest Degrees, and obey him with the exactest Obser∣vance, suitable Returns for such Love on his part? And Lastly, being of that unspotted Holyness that he cannot endure Sin, and of that inflex∣ible Justice, that he will certainly punish it with the utmost degrees of Sorrow and Torture, if obstinately persisted in; what but that we with all imaginable Hast forsake our Sins, trembling least his Wrath should o∣vertake us and we should be found in them?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000904_0011_0FAC9C4644761ED0"/>THIS is to Remember our Creator in reference to his Nature and At∣tributes. And so likwise in reference to his Works of Creation, Pro∣vidence, and of Grace, and those Gracious and Excellent Laws he has given us. Since he hath made us, is the Author of our Being, and Well-being, and we have nothing we can claim as our own, but live up∣on his Charity; to Remember him, what is it but that we live wholy to him, to his Honour, and Glory, and that we entirely serve him. Being he exercises a gracious Providence over us, Feeds and Maintains us, Cherishes and Preserves us, and we are beholden to him for all the Ne∣cessary's, Conveniencies, Accommodations, and Superfluities we en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy: To Remember him, what is it, but that in subservience to his Providence, we only use an honest Diligence in our Respective Stations, and then without carking and thoughtfulness, as to the Event, refer the Success to him, resting contented, and satisfied, when matters fall not ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> according to our Designes, returning him our acknowledgments and thankfulness for whatever we have received? Being he has Redeemed us from the power of our Sins, and the Tyranny of Satan; from the former, by gi∣ving us of his Spirit to subdue our Lusts; from the latter, by paying down his own most precious Blood a Ransom for us; To Remember him, what is it, but to give up our selves to him as his purchas'd Posses¦sion, and to serve under his Banner against Sin and the Devil▪ And Lastly, being he as a most gracious Gov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnour, has given us the most reasonable Laws; To Remember him, what is it, but that we render him a most chearful and willing Obedience to them.</P>
<P>THIS now is to Remember our Creator in reference to his Nature, his Works, and his Laws. And this brings me to my Second general Pro∣posal, to shew you, <HI>how advantagi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, accordingly to Remember your Creator in the days of your youth; and on the other hand, how ex∣ceeding dangerous to defer it to the evil day, the days of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or of old Age, those days we our selves have no pleasure in.</HI></P>
<P>AND First pray consider, how very advantagious it will be accord∣ingly, as has been shew'd you, to Remember your Creator in the days of your youth.</P>
<P>A Young Dovotee is the choice Favorite of Heaven. We see it in

A Regular, Pious, young Person, who hates a base Action, that injures no Man, would do good to all Men, breaks not his Parents Hearts by hearing of his lewd Pranks, his infamous Courses. He does not imbitter all the Comforts of their Life, so that the most plentiful Fortunes can afford them no Sa∣tisfaction▪ He does not cause 'em to wish with <HI>Job,</HI> that the <HI>day would pe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ern, and the night in which it was said, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nceived.</HI> He does not by his prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se prodigality, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> living dissipate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose Fortunes, which his Ancestors Industry had got, and his Parents Care have preserved for him; but by his good Hus∣banding the Talent they have already given him, and the useful Em∣ployment it thereof, to the doing good therewith to himself, and others, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them to hope he will add to, not diminish from their Fortunes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Nor lastly, by his horrid Debaucheries does he make himself the Scorn and Contempt, the Hatred and Abhorrence of all that know him; but by his innocent, and useful Conversation, by his tender and merciful Disposition, is the Love and Admiration of all about him.</P>
<P>IT is certainly a most Lovely Object, a Young, Pious, and orderly Person, for as a great Man expresses it,
<Q>There is a peculiar kind of Grace, and Loveliness in the worthy and excellent Actions of Youth, early Habits of Vertue, like new Cloaths upon a young and comely Body, sit very gracefully upon a streight, and wellshap'd Mind, and do mightily become it.</Q></P>
<P>NOR do Men barely love, but admire an early Vertue. For whe∣ther it be that great things are not ordina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly expected from Persons at that Age, or whether from the scarcity of such happy Instances (espe∣cially in such an Age as this, wherein our Youth are distinguished by their Immodesty, Profaneness, Irreverence to God and Men, from other Persons) whatever may be the cause; so it is, that all Men do pay a peculiar Veneration to a young Person full fraught with Wisdom, Ver∣tue,
<PB N="11" REF="000904_0013_0FAC9C4762B0F758"/>
and Goodness. Whose Understanding is well furnish'd with useful Knowledge, whose Lips do utter nothing but wise and sober Discourse, whose Appetites are under Command, whose Passions are calm, whose Affections are orderly, and to Crown all, who is active and zealous in doing Good, and suppressing Mischief. It is hardly to be expressed the Veneration and Esteem such an one does receive from all sorts of Men. <HI>Job</HI> does incomparably well represent it in his own case; I shall there∣fore give it in his own words, Chap. 29. <HI>Oh that I was as in the months past,</HI> Says he, <HI>as in the days of my youth; when the secret of God was upon my Tabernacle, Then when I went out through the Gate, through the City, when I prepared my Seat in the Street; the young Men saw me, and hid themselves; And the aged arose, and stood up; the Princes refrained talk∣ing, and laid their hands on their mouths, the Nobles held their peace, and their Tongue cleaved to the Roof of their Mouth, when the Ear heard me then it Blessed me, and when the Eye saw me, it gave witness to me.</HI> And wherefore all this? Why for his worthy Actions you will find, <HI>Because I delivered the poor that cry'd, and the Fatherless, and he that had none to help him. The Blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I caused the Widdows to sing for joy, I put on Righteousness and it clothed me, and Judgment was as a Robe and Diadem; I was Eyes to the blind, and Feet was I to the lame, I was a Father to the poor, and the Cause which I knew not, I searched out. And I brake the Jaws of the wicked, and pluck'd the spoil out of their Teeth. Then my glory was fresh in me, and my Bow was re∣newed in my hand. Unto me Men gave Ear, and waited, and kept silence at my Council; after my words they spake not again, and my speech drop'd upon them, and they waited for me as for the Rain. And they open'd their Mouth wide as for the latter Rain. If I laughed on them, they believed it not, and the light of my Countenance they cast not down. I chose out their Way, and sat Chief, and dwelt as a King in the Army, as one that comforteth the Mourners.</HI></P>
<P>NOR are the worthy Deeds of a young Person more admir'd by o∣thers, than they are Laudable in themselves. For what a Glorious Scene is it to see a Youth besieged by powerful Temptations on every side, to acquit himself Bravely, and Resolutely to hold out against the

Be∣lieve me Christians, neither <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his Glory, nor the <HI>Alexan∣ders,</HI> nor <HI>Caesars</HI> in the midst of all their pompous Triumphs, were half so great as one of these; for if they had the Eyes, 'tis these have the Hearts of all beholders.</P>
<P>BUT alass! What is the Love, the Esteem, the Glory they receive from others, to the Silent but Sweet Applauses of their own Consciences? Those Happy Persons, who having prepossess'd their Minds betimes with those Principles of Goodness, which would never let them commit a base and unworthy Action, have never felt rhose venomou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and painful Stings, those bitter and severe Remorses, which the wild, and unthinking Youth, have their perpetual Inmates on the account of those enormous Crimes, which their Lust and Revenge have instigated them to commit. It is not these <HI>whose Heart is sorrowful in the midst of Laughter,</HI> whose <HI>Countenance,</HI> like <HI>Belshazers,</HI> even in the midst of their Revels, <HI>Changes,</HI> and whose Thoughts are troubled, so that the <HI>Joynts of their Knees are loosed, and their Knees smite one against another;</HI> and yet whose Ghastly Thoughts are so terrible to them alone, as to force them to that miserable Refuge of Company, and Excess, to silence the Clamours of their upbraiding Consciences, and to stupifie the Sense of their wounded Minds. What shall I say? It is not those that in the day time start aside from every one they meet, as a Constable, and in the night dream of nothing but Gibbets and Halters: that in the days of their

Health, by their Oaths and Blasphemies, their Fornications and Adul∣teries, their Oppressions, and perhaps Murthers, are perpetually load∣ing themselves with an intollerable weight of Guilt, and when the <HI>evil day</HI> cometh, when Sickness, and Adversities overtake them, have no Comforter they can fly unto. And who after all cannot but entertain those melancholy Suspitions, that there may be yet an <HI>after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>: Those <HI>Devils,</HI> and that <HI>Hell,</HI> and that just God, who will adjudge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to both, out of the Belief of which they have all their Life, so vainly laboured to argue themselves. No, no, those happy Persons who have given to God the early possession of their Souls, are utter Strangers to those Gloomy Sorrows, those Hellish Miseries, that such Men do feel.</P>
<P>NAY, but on the contrary, these Early Beginners in Religion, as they have not half that struggling with Flesh and Blood, which Men once accustomed to evil Courses do feel, before they can master their Cor∣rupt Inclinations; So when they have, for some time, habituated themselves to Vertuous, and Religious Performances; these ways seem at length so easy, so agreeable, so natural to them, that they cannot so much as think of, they abhor the very thoughts of doing an ill thing; So true it is▪ that he <HI>who is born of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, because he is born of God.</HI> Nay but at length accordingly as they proceed from strength to strength, from one degree of Grace to another, they arrive at length to such happy tempers, and have their Souls so exactly tun'd to Goodness, that they are unexpressible; the Satisfactions that such do feel in Religi∣ous Exercises, in Devotion, and doing good; So that with <HI>David</HI> they can say, <HI>how sweet are thy words unto my tast, yea sweeter than hony to my mouth.</HI> Psalm 119.103. Such are the Advantages of <HI>Remembring your Creator in the days of your youth.</HI> It makes you the peculiar Favourites of God, it makes you the Darlings of Mankind withal. It procures you Love, and Esteem, and Honour amongst Men; and Lastly, it gives you a perpetual uninterrupted Peace and Pleasure in your own Minds.</P>
<P>BUT on the other side, it is hardly to be express'd, how exceeding dangerous it will be to defer this necessary work to the <HI>Evil Day,</HI> the Days of Sickness, or old Age, those Days we our selves have no Plea∣sure

sure in. However it may appear in some measure (so far at least as to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Youth from such fatal Delays) if they will please to consider.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> WHAT an intolerable Affront they offer to God, to Sacrifice the Choice of their Days to the service of the Devil; the World or their own Lusts; to think to put him off with the Refuse of their Time, the Years that themselves have no Pleasure in. 2<HI>dly,</HI> How extreamly difficult it will prove after a long, and accustomed Forgetfulness of their Maker, to recover any tolerable Sense of him: And 3<HI>dly,</HI> how utterly impossible it will be, by the ordinary methods o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grace (and Extraordinaries, of all Men such have least reason to expect) to Remember him to any pur∣pose. And</P>
<P N="1">I. Consider, what an intolerable Affront they offer to God, who Sa∣crifice the Choice of their Days, to the Service of the Devil, the World, and their own Lusts; and who think to put him off with the Refuse of their time, the Years that themselves have no Pleasure in.</P>
<P>AND indeed can any thing be more disparaging to God, than to think him so penurious of Friends, as to hold himself, and his Kingdom sala∣ble for the Refuse, and Reversion of their Lives, who have Sacrificed the principal part thereof to his Enemies, and their own Brutish Lusts, then onely ceasing to offend, when the Ability of offending is taken a∣way from them? To think this, is doubtless unworthily to Esteem God a very cheap, and easy Master, that will be content, that may be put off with any thing. He did not appear so to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> He ordered <HI>Deut.</HI> 15.19. <HI>To sanctifie the Firstlings of their Flock unto the Lord their God, but if there were any Blemish therein, as if it were lame, or blind, he told them they should not Sacrifice it unto him.</HI></P>
<P>AND can any of us expect then, when we are grown old, and de∣crepit, in the service of our Lusts, and of Satan his Enemy; can we think so slight of God, that he will be glad receive us then? Hear what <HI>Mala∣chi</HI> Says. chap. 7.8. <HI>If ye offer the blind for Sacrifice, is it not evil, and if ye offer the lame and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, is it not evil? Offer it now unto thy Governour, will he be pleased with thee,, or accept thy Person</HI> Saith the Lord of Hosts. <HI>Offer it to thy Governour</HI>▪ What an intollerable Affront therefore is it to think to flatter the Majesty of Heaven, with what a mortal Man would

scorn and despise? Nay, and I may add, consider whether you your, selves would be so served. None of you would receive him as a Servant who is grown old, and useless, in the service of another Person. (You would sooner I am sure, turn off those who have spent their yourhful Strength in your own Service) And now be you your selves Judges, whether it be not a Slight and Disparagement to God, very unworthy of him, to imagin that he will presently accept, as if he were oblig'd thereby, of a few, heartless and languishing Wishes, and Desires from us towards him, when we can serve his Enemies, Sin, the World, and the Devil no longer. But</P>
<P N="2">II. This is not all, you had best further consider how extreamly diffi∣cult it will prove after a long accustom'd Forgetfulness of your Maker, to recover any tolerable Sense of him. All Men who consider any thing will readily own it, that it is a most vile Indignity (such as no Prince that is a mere Man would endure) we do put upon God, when we thus un∣dervalue him; and but that they willingly perswade themselves that he is infinitely Good, they could have no hopes of Mercy after it. But his Mercies they do easily perswade themselves are so abundantly great, that tho' their Provocations have been never so many, yet if they take Care in time to Repent of their Sins, and Return from their evil Ways; God will mercifully accept them, as if they had never sin'd. And we will not dispute the difference at present, that will be made in those Mens Cases, who from the very Beginning have faithfully serv'd God; and those who in the latter part of their Lives onely, after infinite Dis∣honours done him, do yield themselves at last obedient to him. We will grant that even those who after a long Custom of sinning, do at last a∣bominate, and forsake their Sins, shall be Gods Favourites too; but the Question is, how they shall be able to hate, and forsake those Sins they have so infinitely serv'd, and so closely adhered to heretofore. This mighty Change from one contrary Disposition to another, is not so easy as these Men may imagine. There are many difficulties you will cer∣tainly meet with, both in your selves and others, which will ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reamly much obstruct it.</P>
<P>THAT which in our selves will obstruct it, will be the almost inv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦cible
<PB N="16" REF="000904_0018_0FAC9C4B21ED8430"/>
Power of the contary Habit and Custom. To Root out of our Hearts those Customs of sinning, which we have been long used to, is in the Language of Scripture, <HI>to pluck out our Right Eyes, and to cut off our Right Hands</HI>; Such Habits become so interwoven into our very Na∣tures▪ that they become part of our selves, which we cannot easily offer v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olence to. And therefore does the Prophet make it almost an impossi∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thing to alter an evil Custom of sinning. <HI>Can the Etheopian change <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Leopard his spots</HI> &amp;c?</P>
<P>Besides it ought to be considered, that when Men do come to have a Conviction of the evil of Sin, and of the dismal Consequence of a con∣tinuance in it, and do make, to their own seeming, most firm Resoluti∣ons to break off their Sins by Repentance, presently come in those Com∣panions with them in Sin, and what by their Ridiculi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of all Piety and Vertue, and what by the Scorns and Reproaches they with all the Witt that <HI>Satan</HI> can inspire them shall be cast upon Religion, they will at first s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agger those former Resolutions, and at last utterly overturn them; in∣somuch that we many times see these sick-bed Penitents in their Relapses become <HI>ten times more the Children of Hell than they were before.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, how shall such inveterate Habits of sinning, strengthned by the fallacious Sophistry of vile Wretches, be ever broken? By your own power you cannot do it, for that you found too weak at first, And Gods Grace you cannot well expect, for his Holy Spirit was so long Resisted, till it was quite withdrawn.</P>
<P N="3">III. AND this is another Consideration which may well deter Youth from deferring till the latter Days the great Business of Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> how utterly impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sible it will be by ordinary Methods of Grace, (and extraordinaries such of all Men have the least reason to expect) to Re∣member him to any purpose.</P>
<P>AND yet this is the last Refuge of forlorn Sinners, and of such as Resolve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taking their youthful Liberties. They think that God will violently interpose, and will save them whether they will or no. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow many Millions are mistaken, and never open their Eyes to see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mistake▪ till awakened by the Flames of Hell? How many are overtaken suddainly in the midst of their Sins, dying either in a Fever
<PB N="17" REF="000904_0019_0FAC9C4BE2091E98"/>
that takes away their Understandings, or an Apoplexy that de∣prives them in a Minute of their Sense? How many in a Duel, and how many in a fit of Drunkeness? No! it is not to be expected that when the various Talents of Gods Grace have been long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that he should still continue them to us. He promises in∣deed to those that have, or make use of the Talents they have, that more shall be given; But he does assuredly threaten, that from those who have not, shall be taken away, even that which they have. And so God knows it often happens, that the Divine Patience is at length so worn out, that his Grace is wholly with∣drawn from some Men; and they are given up to a Reprobate Sense as irrecoverably lost, and have in Effect the dreadful Sen∣tence upon them, even before they go out of this World.</P>
<P>BUT do we not sometimes see Men Recover at last, by a Mira∣cle of Grace? It is true, but as Miracles are very rare, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> never wrought but upon extraordinary Occasions, so are these Mens Conversion. It was to serve some Grand Purposes in the wise Government of the World, and must not ordinarily be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pended upon. And pray by what extraordinary Methods of Grace is it we do sometimes see old, <HI>inveterate</HI> Sinners Recovered to a Sight and Sense of their Sins? Why by some terrible Blow to them in their Persons, or Families; by some dismal Calamities, and Losses in their Estates, or perhaps by some amazing Stroaks of Conscience. And is this adviseable to put thy self into such a State, that the way to bring thee out of it, is to make thee a most miserable Creature? Can this be a Hopes to be depended upon, by one that values not a Course of Sin, but for the Pleasures of it? How contradictious are the Reasonings of such Men, who indulge themselves in a Course of Sin in their youthful Days, in hopes hereafter to be brought to a better Sense of it. The Sense they must hope to be brought to, will be but little differing from the Pangs of the Damn'd; the better way therefore will be by a timely Religion which has no Remorses following it, to prevent the ne∣cessity
<PB N="18" REF="000904_0020_0FAC9C4CA2401100"/>
of such a sorrowful, and terrible Repentance, as will be requisite in such a Case.</P>
<P>AND now my dearly beloved Youth, let me beseech you in the Bowels of Jesus Christ, seriously to consider, and lay to Heart what I have now told you. Let me intreat you as you would not cast the vilest, the most provoking Contempt in the World up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, by preferring your foolish Lusts before him; as you would not render it extreamly difficult hereafter to Remember him; as you would not render it impossible for you without such Me∣thods of Grace, as you of all Men would have least Reason to ex∣pect, as you would have little Reason to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire; on the other hand▪ as you would do the most pleasing, and acceptable thing to God; as you would acquai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t your selves with the Sweets of an early Piety; as you would ever Resist the unutterable Consolati∣ons of a timely Religion: Nay, and let me add; as you would render your selves the Joy of your Parents, the Darling of your Country, the Hopes, the Eager Expectations of the next Age; let me request you, let me conjure you, to <HI>Remember your Creator in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of your youth.</HI></P>
<P>TO Remember him! How I pray you? Why as I told you be∣fore; study to know him in his Nature and Attributes, in his works of Creation, Providence, and of Grace, and in those Excellent and Glorious Laws he has given us. And then forget not, neglect not to present him often to your Thoughts, as thus known. <HI>Remember him</HI> as a discerner of the Thoughts and Intents of your Hearts, and let this chase away thence all impure, and unchast Thoughts, all unrighteous, and revengeful Thoughts, all impious and ungodly Thoughts, that they have not the least entertainment there. Re∣member him as now sitting in Heaven, and Registering up in a Book all your Words; and let this restrain the Exorbitances of an evil Tongue; so that henceforth you may suffer no Oaths, nor Curses; no Lies nor Slanders: no censuring, nor evil speaking, no Calumnies nor Detractions to be utter'd thence. Remember him next as a Holy and Righteous Judge that Eternally hates Sin,
<PB N="19" REF="000904_0021_0FAC9C4D62EEF670"/>
and will infallibly punish it, if not Repented of: And let this pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a stop to all Acts of Immodesty and Intemperance, of Softness and Luxury, to all Acts of Wrong and Injury, Revenge and Cruelty, Contention and Strife, and lastly, to all Acts of Profaneness and Impiety. Lastly, Remember him as an infinitely good and graci∣ous Governour that will Recompence all your pains, and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣ness, and diligence in serving him, with Rewards ten thousand times beyond the merits of your deservings, and let this make you humble and selfdenying, just and charitable, and peaceable; pious and devout, and resign'd; zealous Lovers of God, and constant Frequenters of his Worship, both in Prayers and Sacraments.</P>
<P>AND what good now is it that impedes this our Remembrance of our Creator? What but a dangerous World, which if we love to the neglect of better things, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> love of the Father is not in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s? What but a foolish transitory World, which believe me my Friends; nay believe not me but <HI>Solomon,</HI> who had the fullest experience of all it can afford us, and yet pronounces concerning it, <HI>that it is all vanity, and vexation of spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Vain it is, for that it neither does▪ nor can perform what we ex∣pect from it: Vain, for that it promiseth satisfaction, but leaves us nothing but disapointment; Vain, for that a single Cross will im∣bitter all its Comforts; Vain, for that the longer we enjoy my Worldly Goods the more flat and insipid do they gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w upon us; and Vain, in that its highest Enjoyments are inconstant and fickle. And as Vain, so Vexatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, for that its Crosses do generally exceed its Pleasures. And lastly, Vain, and Vexatious both, for that it can stand us in no stead at the hour of death, and the day of judgment, when we have the greatest need of Support and Comfort.</P>
<P>AT the hour of Death what support for Men to Remember their foul Frauds, their Revengeful Quarels, their intemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ots, their lewd Companions, their profane Jests! At the day of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udg∣ment, what Comfort to see the Books open'd, the sorrowful Re∣membrancer of all these?</P>
<P>BUT when you come to die, the Reflections that from your

Youth upwards you have <HI>Remembered your Creator,</HI> this to Admi∣ration will support and comfort you both. It will mitigate your Pains under the Tortures of the Stone, it will Refresh your Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its in the flames of a Fever.</P>
<P>BUT this is not half; It will help you to look Death in the Face boldly; It will help you to welcome the stalking Monster; It will fill your Hearts with Joys unutterable; Joys that will almost burst your Earthen Vessels; Joys that are pure and Spiritual, Joys that are the Antepasts of Heaven; <HI>Joys such as Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath ever entered our Hearts to conceive.</HI></P>
<P>NOR is this yet the thousandth part of the Benefit, the early Remembrance of your Creator will moreover yield you; When in the great and terrible Day of the Lord, the Son of God shall ap∣pear from Heaven with an <HI>Euge Bone Serve,</HI> with a <HI>Come ye Good and Faithful Servants, Enter into the Kingdom prepared for you</HI>; you shall immediately in Reward for such your early Remembrance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e translated into <HI>Gods Presence where there is fulness of Joy, and be placed on his Right Hand, where there is Pleasures for evermore.</HI></P>
