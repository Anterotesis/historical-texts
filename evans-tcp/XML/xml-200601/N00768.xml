<P>THe obscure Author of this <HI>Fee∣ble Discourse,</HI> having been One Lords-Day Confined from the Ser∣vice of his Flock, by <HI>Sickness,</HI> reckon∣ed it not amiss on the next Lords-Day, to entertain them, with some of the broken, &amp; shatter'd Thoughts, which he had in the <HI>Sickness.</HI> He had no Intention of publishing them any further; but some of the Hearers, to whom the <HI>Sovereign Grace</HI> of Heaven, had made this poor Sermon more <HI>A∣wakening,</HI> than many that were more <HI>Elaborate,</HI> sollicited his Leave to give it unto the publick.

<P><HI>AND then, I am sure, there is not a man upon Earth, but what stands in Infinite Need of a</HI> CHRIST. <HI>Now to Proclame a</HI> CHRIST, <HI>as the <HI>Healer</HI> of a Dying Soul, and therefore the <HI>One thing Needful</HI> for every Soul, is the Work to be done this day among you.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Self-Righteous</HI> but the most <HI>Ʋnrighteous</HI> Pharisees, conceived no little Malice and Scandal against our Lord Jesus Christ, upon His Admit∣ting

of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into His company. They Cavilled our Lord, as if He had been Himself the <HI>Chief of Sinners,</HI> because He allow'd those, whom the more Superstitious and Ceremonious Jews, distinguished by the Name of <HI>Sinners,</HI> to have Communion with Him. Our Text contains the Vin∣dication of our Lord; <HI>The Whole have no need of a Physician, but they that are Sick.</HI> The plain Sense, and Scope, and Sum of the Text is This;
<Q>A <HI>Physician</HI> must be among the <HI>Sick</HI>: it is his Calling and his Duty to be so. The <HI>Messiah</HI> is the <HI>Physician of Souls,</HI> and all <HI>Sinners</HI> are the <HI>Sick.</HI> You <HI>Pharisees,</HI> that are insensible of your <HI>Sinfulness,</HI> and <HI>Sickliness,</HI> can't expect, that I should Converse with none but you. The <HI>Publicans</HI> feel and own themselves to be <HI>Sinful,</HI> &amp; you must not wonder, if then I visit them.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine of God our Saviour,</HI> which we are now to insist upon, is This;
<Q><PB N="5" REF="000926_0005_0FACA340673A4C20"/>The Lord <HI>JESUS CHRIST</HI> is the Physician of Souls, that are Dis∣eased with Sin, and sensible of their Diseases.</Q></P>
<P>They are the <HI>Thoughts of a Sick man</HI> which are now to entertain you▪ A <HI>Few</HI> Thoughts, and <HI>Faint</HI> ones, are all that must Compose the present Entertainment.</P>
<P>Three <HI>Propositions</HI> ly before us▪</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Sin</HI> is the <HI>Sickness</HI> of the <HI>Soul▪ <HI>Sin</HI></HI> brings Many, Loathsome, Dead∣ly <HI>Diseases</HI> on the <HI>Soul.</HI> There cleaves to every man in the world, a Cor∣ruption, which (after <HI>Austin,</HI>) we call, <HI>Original Sin</HI>: or, a Principle Rebelling against the Holy God, and Transgressing of His <HI>Holy, and Just, and Good Commandments.</HI> This our <HI>Original Sin,</HI> is the <HI>Original</HI> of all the <HI>Sickness</HI> on our <HI>Body.</HI> Hence, when our Lord <HI>bore our Sins,</HI> 'tis said, <HI>He
<PB N="6" REF="000926_0006_0FACA34213A868E0"/>
bare our Sicknesses</HI>▪ Our <HI>Moral Dis∣tempers</HI> are the Cause of our <HI>Natural</HI> ones. And <HI>Original Sin</HI> is it self the <HI>Sickness</HI> of our <HI>Soul.</HI> In regard of <HI>O∣riginal Sin,</HI> it may be said of us, as in Isa. 1.5, 6. <HI>The whole Head is Sick, and the whole Heart Faint; from the sole of the foot, even unto the Head, there is no Soundness; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores.</HI> The man of God once mentioned those two things together, Psal. 103.3. <HI>He for∣giveth all thine Iniquities, He healeth all thy Diseases</HI>: And indeed those two things may meet in one; for our <HI>Iniquities</HI> are our <HI>Diseases.</HI> For this cause, Deliverance from <HI>Sin,</HI> is called by the Name of <HI>Healing</HI>: when 'tis said, Isa. 6, 10. <HI>They Convert and be Healed,</HI> it is as much as if it had been said, By Conversion they be Saved from their <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sin</HI> does to the <HI>Soul,</HI> the same that <HI>Sickness</HI> does to the <HI>Body.</HI> There is a lamentable <HI>Weakness</HI> brought upon the <HI>Soul,</HI> by that <HI>Sickness.</HI> By
<PB N="7" REF="000926_0007_0FACA342AC725778"/>
reason of <HI>Sin,</HI> it comes to pass, that a <HI>Sinner</HI> is, as 'tis Expressed, Rom. 5.6. <HI>Without strength.</HI> Tis a <HI>Sickness</HI> that has taken the <HI>Sinner</HI> quite off his Legs: he is not able to <HI>Run the way of Gods Commandments,</HI> or, to <HI>Walk with God,</HI> or, to <HI>Come unto the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> though his very Life do ly upon it. Yea, <HI>Sin</HI> is a <HI>Sickness,</HI> by which all the Faculties of our <HI>Souls,</HI> are wofully Disordered, grievously Disabled. Our <HI>Understandings</HI> are Enfeebled by <HI>Sin</HI>: they do not now <HI>Receive the things of the Spirit of God,</HI> which are <HI>Spiritually discerned.</HI> It is said of a Sinner, 1. Tim. 6.4. <HI>He knews nothing.</HI> Our <HI>Consciences</HI> are also Weakned by Sin; and being <HI>Weak,</HI> they do not aright perform their <HI>Offices.</HI> It is said of a Sinner, 1 Cor. 8.7. <HI>He has a weak Conscience.</HI> Above all, Our <HI>Wills</HI> are Depraved by Sin. We are <HI>Sick at Heart.</HI> What a <HI>desperate sickness</HI> is an <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>desperately wicked</HI>? An Heart that has the <HI>Stone</HI> in it? A Sinner <HI>will not do,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="000926_0008_0FACA344272E6158"/>
what God requires: Thus we read of some, Jer. 44.16. They said, <HI>We will not Hearken.</HI> And he <HI>will do</HI> what God forbids: Thus 'tis said of some, Joh. 8.44. <HI>The Lusts of your Father ye will do.</HI> And his <HI>Will</HI> makes a most per∣verse and froward <HI>Choice</HI>: It <HI>Chooses</HI> that which is <HI>Evil,</HI> and <HI>Refuses</HI> that which is <HI>Good.</HI> All the <HI>Affections</HI> of his <HI>Will</HI> are out of order. His <HI>Grief</HI> is what should be his <HI>Joy</HI>; his <HI>Fear</HI> is what should be his <HI>Hope</HI>; he <HI>Hates</HI> what he should <HI>Love</HI>; and his <HI>Joy</HI> &amp; <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> are all misplaced. And as the <HI>Diseases</HI> of the Soul use to come under this Distribution, <HI>Oblivio Dei,</HI> and <HI>Angor Conscientiae,</HI> so <HI>Sin</HI> having at this rate <HI>Sickned</HI> the Soul, at last it brings an horrible <HI>Pain</HI> upon the Soul: Even that <HI>Pain,</HI> whereof the wise man sayes, Prov. 18.14. <HI>The Spirit of a man will sustain his Infirmity, but a wounded Spirit who can hear?</HI> And that <HI>Pain,</HI> wherein some have kept Crying out, <HI>O Torture! Torture!</HI> and wish'd but for this mitigation of their mise∣rable
<PB N="9" REF="000926_0009_0FACA344E938CBA0"/>
Anguish, <HI>To ly in the Fire on the Hearth before them</HI>!</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Diseases</HI> that are by <HI>Sin</HI> thus brought upon the <HI>Soul,</HI> have es∣pecially Three sad Characters upon them.</P>
<P>First, They are <HI>Many <HI>Diseases</HI>.</HI> As 'tis said, Jam, 3.2. <HI>In many things we all offend</HI>: thus it may be said, <HI>In many things we are all Diseased.</HI> Every <HI>Lust</HI> is a several <HI>Disease</HI> in the <HI>Soul</HI>: And there is many a <HI>Lust,</HI> wherewith a Sinner is distempered. It is a de∣plorable thing to be Troubled with <HI>many Diseases</HI> together, a <HI>Complication of Diseases</HI>: to have it said of One, as it was of that Great Reformer, <HI>That one man has Diseases enough per∣haps for an Hospital.</HI> But every sin∣ner has <HI>many Diseases.</HI> He has the <HI>Palsey</HI> of an <HI>unsteady Mind</HI>; He has the <HI>Feavour</HI> of <HI>Unchastity</HI>▪ He has the <HI>Dropsy</HI> of <HI>Covetousness</HI>; He has the <HI>Erisypelas</HI> of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger</HI>; He has the <HI>Can∣cer</HI> of <HI>Envy</HI>▪ He has the <HI>Tympany</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="000926_0010_0FACA345AEA7B1F0"/>
<HI>Pride</HI>; He has the <HI>Apoplexy</HI> of <HI>Sloth∣fulness</HI>: And what not?</P>
<P>Secondly, They are <HI>Loathsome <HI>Diseases</HI>.</HI> What shall we say of them? They are as bad as the <HI>Plague. Sin</HI> is called, 1 King. 8.38. <HI>The Plague of the Heart.</HI> All the out-breakings of <HI>Sin,</HI> are but the filthy and nasty run∣nings of so many <HI>Plague-sores.</HI> In∣deed, <HI>Sin</HI> is a <HI>Leprosy</HI>; and there can be nothing more <HI>Loathsome</HI> than such a <HI>Leprosy.</HI> Sin is called <HI>Filthyness</HI>: 2 Cor. 7.1. <HI>Filthiness of Flesh &amp; Spirit.</HI> And the Sinner, is called, <HI>An Abomi∣nable man:</HI> How should it be other∣wise? For <HI>Sin</HI> is an <HI>Abomination.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, They are <HI>Deadly <HI>Diseases</HI>.</HI> Hence tis said, Ezek. 18.4. <HI>The Soul that sins shall Dy.</HI> Men are, <HI>Dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> There is a <HI>Death</HI> comes upon <HI>all men</HI>: Whence <HI>In that all have Sinned.</HI> Every <HI>Sin</HI> is in it self a <HI>Mortal sickness</HI>: If it be not in the <HI>Event</HI> so, 'tis owing to the wonderful Grace of God. <HI>Sin,</HI> if it be not seasonably and effectually Re∣medied,
<PB N="11" REF="000926_0011_0FACA34664922AD8"/>
will prove <HI>Deadly</HI> to the Soul: we are forewarned, Rom. 6.21. <HI>The End is Death.</HI> What is the <HI>Sinner?</HI> It may be said unto every such one, as the Lord said once unto such a one; <HI>Thou are a <HI>Dead man.</HI></HI></P>
<P>But, what shall now be done for us, in this our <HI>Sickness?</HI> I Remember the pathetical words of the Despair∣ing <HI>Spirae; Its neither Plaister, nor Drugs, that can cure a fainting Soul, cast down with the sense of sin, and the wrath of God: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Christ only that must be the Physician.</HI> Prepare now, O my Hearers, to Hear of a <HI>Physician.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The Lord JESUS CHRIST is the <HI>Physician</HI> of the <HI>Sin-sick Soul.</HI> There are several Elegant and En∣dearing <HI>Terms,</HI> whereby our <HI>Saviour</HI> describes Himself unto us, as our <HI>Sa∣viour.</HI> One of those Terms is, that Honourable one of, <HI>A Physician.</HI> When our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Saves</HI> us from our <HI>sin,</HI> He <HI>Saves</HI> us from the
<PB N="12" REF="000926_0012_0FACA3478FEA9D90"/>
worst <HI>sickness</HI> in the world. It is fit therefore, that our Lord Jesus Christ should be called, <HI>A Physician,</HI> when He appears for our <HI>Salvation</HI> from our <HI>Sin.</HI> His Name is that, Exod. 15.26. <HI>The Lord, thy Healer.</HI> His work is that, Psal. 147.3. <HI>He Heals the Broken in heart, &amp; binds up their wounds.</HI> Of Him tis said, Mal. 4.2. <HI>The Sun of Righteousness</HI> [Our true <HI>Phaebus!] shall arise, with Healing in His wings.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Miracles</HI> wrought by our Lord Jesus Christ, when He was Conver∣sant among us, were for the most part, <HI>Healing Miracles.</HI> 'Tis said of Him, Mat. 4.23. <HI>He Cured all manner of Diseases.</HI> In that Quality of the <HI>Miracles</HI> wrought by our Lord, there was this Instruction taught unto us; <HI>That the Lord Jesus Christ, is the <HI>Phy∣sician</HI> from whom our <HI>Souls</HI> may ex∣pect the Healing of all their Maladies.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord Jesus Christ is Appoint∣ed and Anointed by God, for the <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and man:
<PB N="13" REF="000926_0013_0FACA348D6711248"/>
And it is as our <HI>Mediator,</HI> that our Lord Jesus Christ is our <HI>Physician.</HI> In well-ordered Common-wealths, every man may not presume to take upon himself, the Character of a <HI>Phy∣sician</HI>: 'tis a Character for none but such, as after a due Trial, are <HI>Li∣censed</HI> for it. Our Lord Jesus Christ comes to us, as a <HI>Physician,</HI> under the <HI>License</HI> and <HI>Broad-S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l</HI> of the Eter∣nal GOD. Hence our Lord could say, Luk. 4.18. <HI>He hath sent me, to Heal the broken-hearted.</HI> There is no <HI>Malady</HI> of our <HI>Souls,</HI> but our Lord Jesus Christ, as our <HI>Mediator,</HI> ha's now a <HI>Medicine</HI> for that <HI>Malady.</HI> That Glorious <HI>Priest,</HI> has a Cure for our <HI>Guiltiness</HI>; That Glorious <HI>Prophet,</HI> has a Cure for our <HI>Ignorance</HI>: That Glorious <HI>King,</HI> has a Cure for our <HI>Pol∣lution,</HI> and our <HI>Slavery.</HI></P>
<P>But let us Enquire a little more particularly.</P>
<P>Question I. What are the <HI>Means,</HI> whereby our Lord Jesus Christ, as the
<PB N="14" REF="000926_0014_0FACA349650A0A58"/>
<HI>Physician</HI> of our Souls, does <HI>Heal</HI> our <HI>Soul-Diseases</HI>?</P>
<P>It is thus Answered.</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Blood</HI> of our Lord Je∣sus Christ, is the <HI>Grand Medicine</HI> of our Souls. Oh! the admirable, astonish∣ing <HI>Riddle</HI> of the Gospel! <HI>Fusus est san∣guis Medici, et factum est Medicamentum phrenetici,</HI> was the ancient Admiration! The <HI>Blood</HI> of our <HI>Physician,</HI> is the Great <HI>Medicine</HI> for all our <HI>Diseases.</HI> It was the Song of his praise, Rev. 1.5. <HI>He hath Loved us, &amp; Washed us,</HI> (and so Heal∣ed us) <HI>from our Sins, in His own Blood.</HI> The <HI>Blood</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is a <HI>Sin-pardoning Blood,</HI> and a <HI>Sin-subdu∣ing Blood,</HI> and all the Help that we have against our <HI>Sin</HI> lies in the <HI>Blood</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ shed for our <HI>Sin.</HI> We are told, 1 Joh. 1.7. <HI>The Blood of Jesus Christ Cleanseth,</HI> (&amp; so Healeth) <HI>from all Sin.</HI> Our <HI>Sin</HI> has made fear∣ful <HI>Wounds</HI> in our Souls: but from the <HI>Wounded side</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, there has dropt that <HI>Blood,</HI> which is a <HI>Soveraign Balsame</HI> for all our <HI>Wounds.</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="000926_0015_0FACA34A2C5EB038"/>
Hence tis said, Isa. 53.5. <HI>He was woun∣ded for our Transgressions, He was bruised for our Iniquities, and with His stripes we are Healed.</HI> Thus,
<Q>Vulneribus Christs fit Medicina meis.</Q></P>
<P>But, Secondly; The <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Applies</HI> the <HI>Medi∣cine</HI> to our <HI>Souls.</HI> Our <HI>Soul</HI> is <HI>Healed</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> by that <HI>Grace,</HI> which the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ has purcha∣sed. But now, tis the <HI>Spirit of Grace,</HI> who does <HI>Apply</HI> that <HI>Grace.</HI> The <HI>Soul</HI> that had been <HI>Sick unto Death,</HI> is Re∣vived; and is Restored, and brought unto <HI>Life</HI> again, when the <HI>Spirit of Life</HI> operates upon it. A <HI>Soul</HI> is <HI>Healed</HI> in its <HI>Conversion</HI> unto God: Sayes the prophet, <HI>If they Convert, they be Healed</HI> Now a <HI>Conversion</HI> is wrought by the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> upon the Soul. It was said of some, Act. 11.21. <HI>The Hand of the Lord</HI> [that is to say, The Spirit of the Lord,] <HI>was with them, and a Great Number Believed, and Turned unto the Lord.</HI> Men will never <HI>Turn unto the Lord,</HI> until the <HI>Spirit of the Lord</HI> shall
<PB N="16" REF="000926_0016_0FACA34AEB39F2D0"/>
<HI>Turn</HI> them. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Lord Jesus Christ, is, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Sanctifier</HI>; and <HI>The Comforter,</HI> and that is as much as to say, <HI>The Physician.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was said, 1 Cor. 6.11. <HI>Ye are Washed</HI> (and so, ye are Healed) <HI>by the Spirit of our God.</HI></P>
<P>And, Thirdly; The <HI>Ordinances,</HI> and the <HI>Providences</HI> of the Lord Je∣sus Christ, are the <HI>Vehicles</HI> of the <HI>Me∣dicine.</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, That is a <HI>Soul-healing</HI> Word, and a <HI>Soul-quickning</HI> Word. We read, Rev. 22.2. of a <HI>Tree,</HI> and the <HI>Leaves of the Tres were for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealing of the Nations.</HI> Methinks, while I turn the <HI>Leaves</HI> of this <HI>Book,</HI> I have in my Hands the <HI>Leaves</HI> of the <HI>Tree,</HI> that are for the <HI>Healing of the Nation.</HI> Of this <HI>Word,</HI> we are by the <HI>Word</HI> it self <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>It Converts the Soul, it makes Wild the Simple, it Rejoyces the Heart, it En∣lightens the E<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</HI> What a <HI>Catholicon</HI> have we before us? And the <HI>Sacra∣ments</HI> of the New Testament, have an <HI>Healing vertue</HI> in them. When the <HI>Word</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, has
<PB N="17" REF="000926_0017_0FACA34BA7EC0C08"/>
first hopefully begun the <HI>Cure</HI> of a Soul, the <HI>Sacraments</HI> are then to carry on the <HI>Cure.</HI> Hence it was said, Ezek. 47.9. <HI>The waters of the Sanctuary are for Healing.</HI> Indeed, it is a preposte∣rous Thing, to give the <HI>Eucharist</HI> un∣to them, that are altogether Uncured. <HI>That</HI> I had almost called, <HI>Quack-Di∣vinity.</HI> But when the <HI>Word</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ has in a measure dis∣posed the Soul for it, then the <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> of the <HI>Eucharist</HI> are seasona∣ble. Christian, Though thou hast a very <HI>Sick Soul</HI> in thee, yet thou mayst venture to come. The <HI>Providences</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, have also their subserviency to the <HI>Healing</HI> of our Souls. The Lord said, Hos. 7.1▪ <HI>I would have Healed Ephraim.</HI> How? By <HI>Providential</HI> Dispensations. The <HI>Comforts</HI> bestowed upon us; These are to bring our Souls into Frame, &amp; <HI>Lead us unto Repentance.</HI> The <HI>Sorrows</HI> inflicted upon us; These are to make our Souls Better, and hereby our <HI>Ini∣quity is purged.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="000926_0018_0FACA34C6B010880"/>But more Light will come in, by the opening of another Window.</P>
<P>Question II. What is that <HI>Healing</HI> which the <HI>Physician</HI> of our Souls, does by these <HI>Means</HI> Convey unto us?</P>
<P>To this the Answer is;</P>
<P>This <HI>Healing</HI> is the whole <HI>Salva∣tion</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ: It con∣talus all the <HI>Benefits</HI> that flow to us, from His Alsufficient <HI>Mediation.</HI></P>
<P>Very particularly;</P>
<P><HI>Iustification</HI> is one thing, in the <HI>Healing</HI> of a Soul. When the <HI>Good Lord Pardoned the people,</HI> 'tis said, 2 Chron. 30.20. <HI>The Lord Healed the people.</HI> When Sin is <HI>Forgiven,</HI> 'tis <HI>Co∣vered</HI> by a Divine <HI>Plaister,</HI> and so the Soul is <HI>Healed.</HI> When the Prophet sayes, <HI>Lest they Convert and be Healed,</HI> the Evangelist renders it, <HI>Lest they should be Converted, &amp; their Sins should be Forgiven them.</HI> We read, Isa. 33.24. <HI>The Inhabitant shall not say I am Sick, the people shall be Forgiven their Iniquity.</HI> Truly, a Soul sayes, <HI>I am no more so sick, as once I was,</HI> when a man is <HI>For∣given his Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="000926_0019_0FACA34D2B40B930"/><HI>Sanctification</HI> is another thing in the <HI>Healing</HI> of the Soul. A Soul is made <HI>Healthy</HI> when 'tis made <HI>Holy.</HI> In <HI>Sanctifying</HI> a Soul, the Lord fulfils what is written, Jer. 30.17. <HI>I will Re∣store Health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy Wounds.</HI> The Soul is <HI>Viciated</HI> by Sin. To Extinguish, and Extir∣pate the <HI>Vices</HI> of the Soul, is to <HI>Heal</HI> the Soul. A <HI>Sanctified</HI> Soul is an <HI>Healed</HI> one, because the <HI>Vic<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> of it are taken away. By <HI>Holiness</HI> the lost <HI>Image</HI> of God is Renewed in the Soul; and all the powers of the Soul are brought into a better Temper, and Order.</P>
<P>And then, in the <HI>Healing</HI> of the Soul, there is <HI>Consolation</HI> also. This is the <HI>Healing</HI> of the <HI>Broken in Heart</HI>; and a making of <HI>Broken Bones to Re∣joyce.</HI> Thus 'tis said, Isa. 57.18. <HI>I will Heal him, &amp; Restore Comforts unto him.</HI> A <HI>Sad</HI> Soul is a <HI>Sick</HI> Soul. A <HI>Grieved</HI> Spirit, a <HI>Fearful</HI> Spirit, is a <HI>Wounded</HI> Spirit. The <HI>Oyl of Gladness</HI> poured into the Soul, by the Promi∣ses of the New Covenant, is the <HI>Heal∣ing</HI> of the Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="000926_0020_0FACA34DF301F3F0"/>Well, but who shall be partakers of this <HI>Healing?</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The Blessed <HI>Healer of Souls,</HI> will not <HI>Heal</HI> the <HI>Diseases</HI> in the Souls of men, until He has made them <HI>Sen∣sible</HI> of their <HI>Diseases.</HI> Men must be <HI>Sick,</HI> before the Lord will <HI>Heal</HI> them; that is to say, <HI>Sensibly Sick.</HI> It is not every <HI>Sick</HI> man that shall be <HI>Heal∣ed</HI> by the Lord, but they who are so <HI>Sick,</HI> as to see and feel that they <HI>need a Physician.</HI> There must be a <HI>Con∣viction</HI> of Sin, to prepare men for their <HI>Deliverance</HI> from Sin.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reason</HI> of this, is plain▪ 'Tis, Because none but the <HI>Sensible Sick,</HI> will come unto the Lord Jesus Christ for <HI>Healing.</HI> It is not fit that the Lord Jesus Christ should <HI>Heal</HI> the Souls of men, till they look unto Him, that they may be <HI>Healed</HI>: No, 'tis inconsistent with the Glory of God, and the Method of Grace. Indeed, the <HI>Healing of Souls,</HI> does most proper∣ly and suitably Commence in this point. When a Soul is made <HI>Sensible</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="000926_0021_0FACA34EA68C7438"/>
of its being <HI>Sick,</HI> it begins to be <HI>Heal∣ed</HI> of the <HI>Sickness</HI>; The very <HI>Sense</HI> is part of the <HI>Cure.</HI> Until a man be <HI>Sen∣sible</HI> of his own <HI>Sinfulness</HI> and wretch∣edness, 'tis very certain, he will never come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, for the <HI>Healing</HI> of it. Unto the <HI>Insensi∣ble</HI> our Lord will still have cause to say, Joh. 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye may have Life.</HI> No, while a man is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsensible</HI> of the <HI>Sick state</HI> that Sin has brought him into, he will de∣spise the Great Saviour, and <HI>neglect the Great Salvation</HI>; he will trample under foot the Son of God, and count His <HI>Blood</HI> a Thing of no Account: he will prefer <HI>Sin</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all the Heavenly Happiness, that the Lord Jesus Christ has to bestow upon him. And it is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> That a Sinner should be Healed of his <HI>Dis∣eases</HI> while he continues under the Reign of such <HI>Malignity</HI>; Yea, it is as <HI>Unpossible</HI> as it is <HI>Ʋnreasonable</HI>; for this <HI>Malignity</HI> is it self, as they use to say of the <HI>Plague, <HI>The Queen of all Diseases</HI>.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="000926_0022_0FACA34F698209A0"/>But let us Enquire, <HI>who are the <HI>Sensibly Sick</HI>?</HI></P>
<P>First. A man must be <HI>Sensible</HI> of his own <HI>Sinfulness.</HI> A <HI>Sensible Sick</HI> Sin∣ner, is One that sees himself a <HI>Sinner,</HI> and bemoans himself like him, Luk. 18.13. <HI>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI> He sees himself a Sinner by <HI>Nature.</HI> He sayes with the <HI>Sensible</HI> Psalmist, <HI>Behold, I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother Conceive me.</HI> He sees himself a Sinner by <HI>Practice.</HI> He sayes with the <HI>Sensible</HI> People, <HI>My Transgressions are multiplied before God, and my Sins testify against me.</HI> Yea, he sees himself Distempered and En∣dangered, by <HI>Innumerable Sins</HI>: he sayes with him, Psal. 40.12. <HI>Innume∣rable Evils have compassed me about, mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me.</HI> A Soul <HI>Sensibly Sick</HI> is no <HI>Self-Justici∣ary.</HI> He Cryes out, <HI>Lord, I am Vile: I am a Sinful Wretch; my best, my fair∣est and finest Works, are but splendid Sins▪ my Holy Things are Iniquities, I am a meer Lump of Sin; there dwells no Good thing in me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="000926_0023_0FACA3518BCF48F0"/>Secondly. A man must be <HI>Sensible,</HI> that <HI>Sin</HI> has Exposed him to <HI>Every sort of Evil.</HI> He must say, in Lam. 5.16. <HI>Wo is unto me, that I have Sinned.</HI> He is a <HI>Sick</HI> man indeed, that sees <HI>Death,</HI> and nothing but <HI>Death</HI> before him. A Soul <HI>Sensibly Sick,</HI> sees the <HI>Death,</HI> whereto he is by <HI>Sin</HI> become obnoxious. There is a Terror struck into such a Soul, by such a Thought as That, Rom. 6.23. <HI>The wages of Sin is Death.</HI> Such a Soul, is cast into an Agony of Consternation and A∣stonishment at the Condition, which it is by Sin brought into. It sees it∣self Siezed by the dreadful Wrath &amp; Curse of God, &amp; shrieks, <HI>Oh! Wretch∣ed One that I am</HI>! These, These are the Soliloques of a <HI>Sin Sick</HI> Soul; <HI>Alas, What shall I do? Where shall I go? I am Condemned by the Law of God; All the Threatnings and Thunders of it, are directed against me. The Chains of Hell are upon me, and I am held fast in the Bond of Iniquity; and</HI> I <HI>am a Cap∣tive of the Mighty: And if I Dy in this
<PB N="24" REF="000926_0024_0FACA351B17F3038"/>
Condition, what, what will become of me throughout Eternal Ages?</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly; A man must be <HI>Sensible,</HI> that <HI>Sin</HI> is indeed the <HI>Worst sort of Evil.</HI> He must call it, as 'tis call'd, Jer. 44.4. <HI>The Abominable thing.</HI> That man is indeed <HI>Sick,</HI> who feels it a worse thing to be <HI>Sick,</HI> than to be <HI>Poor,</HI> and <HI>Mean</HI>▪ and labour under ten thousand other Inconveniences. A Soul <HI>Sensibly Sick,</HI> looks upon <HI>Sin</HI> as the worst misery imaginable: There appears nothing so miserable unto such a Soul, as to ly under <HI>Sin.</HI> As 'tis said of one, Heb. 11.25. <HI>He Chose rather to suffer Affliction, with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin</HI>; So, such a Soul counts the most <HI>Pleasant Sin,</HI> more bitter, than the most <HI>bitter Affliction.</HI> Yea, the Sin which was once the chief Pleasure of such a Soul, now becomes <HI>more Bitter than Death.</HI> A <HI>Sin-Sick</HI> Soul, makes Ejulations and Exclamations of this Importance; <HI>What a forlorn Creature am I! Better work it for my Body to be
<PB N="25" REF="000926_0025_0FACA352653FA8E8"/>
Blind, than for my Soul to ly under this Blindness; Better for my Body to be Lame, than for my Soul to ly under this Lame∣ness, that my Sin has brought upon me. Bet∣ter were it for me to ly under any pining Sickness, than to have a Soul pining away in its Iniquities.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. A man must be <HI>Sensible,</HI> that he cannot be his <HI>own Saviour <HI>from Sin</HI>,</HI> or the <HI>Healer</HI> of his own Soul. A Soul <HI>Sensibly Sick,</HI> is that in Luk. 19.10. <HI>That which is Lost</HI>; a Soul at an utter <HI>Loss,</HI> about its own Recovery. Then is a man <HI>Sick</HI> to purpose, when he sees that he can't heal or help himself. A <HI>Sin-sick</HI> Soul, is one that utterly despairs of <HI>Healing</HI> his own <HI>Sickness</HI>: but sayes with the Psalmist, Psal. 65.12. <HI>The Lord only is my Salvation.</HI> A Soul <HI>Sensibly Sick,</HI> feels an infinite load of <HI>Sin</HI> lying up∣on it self, and sees it self utterly una∣ble to remove the least part of that load. Such a Soul Cryes out, <HI>I am nothing, I can deserve nothing, I can per∣form nothing</HI>! Yea, all Humane Re∣liefs,
<PB N="26" REF="000926_0026_0FACA353291CA0B0"/>
do fail such a Soul; all Creatures appear insufficient, and insignificant, and <HI>Physicians of no value</HI> unto it. These are the <HI>Sick,</HI> to whom the Lord Himself will be the <HI>Physician</HI>!</P>
<P>Let us Apply these <HI>Faithful sayings.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Repair, O <HI>Sick Souls,</HI> Repair un∣to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, for the <HI>Healing</HI> of your <HI>Sickness,</HI> your <HI>Sin∣ful Sickness.</HI> We are a Congregation of <HI>Sick Souls</HI>: Where am I Preaching, Sirs, but in an <HI>Hospital?</HI> If there be any One Soul in the Congregation, so <HI>Whole,</HI> as to <HI>need no Physician,</HI> Be gone, O Soul, be gone: Why dost thou tarry here? <HI>Heaven</HI> is the only place for such a Soul. But indeed, if any <HI>Soul</HI> be so Conceited of it self, that <HI>it need no Physician,</HI> there is ra∣ther good to say, That there is no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> likely to miss of <HI>Heaven</HI> at the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and there is no Soul under more

desperate Symptomes of a <HI>Sickness,</HI> that will End in <HI>Hell,</HI> and bring to <HI>Hell,</HI> at the last!</P>
<P>Wherefore, Let every Soul now, be found lying at the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ, with that Cry, Psal 41.4. <HI>Lord, be Merciful unto me, Heal my Soul, for I have Sinned against thee.</HI> And with that Cry, Psal. 116.4. <HI>The Sorrows of Death compass me— O Lord, I beseech thee, Deliuer my Soul.</HI></P>
<P>I call to mind, the words used un∣to the Lord-General of <HI>Syria,</HI> labour∣ing under a <HI>Leprosy,</HI> 2 King. 5.3. <HI>I would my Lord were with the Prophet, that is in Samaria, for he would recover him of his Leprosy.</HI> Even so would I say; <HI>I would thy Soul were applying it self unto the Lord Jesus Christ, the Sa∣viour that is in the Heavens; for He would Recover thy Soul of all its Ma∣ladies.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, Let us go to the Lord Jesus Christ, for the <HI>Sick</HI> Souls, that <HI>Cannot,</HI> and <HI>Will not</HI> (their <HI>Cannot,</HI> is indeed
<PB N="28" REF="000926_0028_0FACA354A8727248"/>
a <HI>Will not</HI>!) go for themselves. We read, Mat. 9.3. <HI>Behold, They brought unto Him, a man Sick, and Je∣sus seeing THEIR Faith, said unto the Sick, Son be of Good Cheer.</HI> Thus, let us go to the Lord Jesus Christ, for our <HI>Sick</HI> Neighbours, and especially for our <HI>Sick</HI> Children, and other such <HI>Relatives,</HI> who may be, by Sin indis∣posed unto the <HI>Thing that is Good</HI>; and plead, <HI>Lord, I have such Friends that are yet Strangers to thy Fear, and that follow these and those Evil Courses; Oh, Take them into thy Healing Hands, and Heal them, and Help them, and Change them, and put thy Fear into their Hearts, I pray thee, I pray thee</HI>! Who can tell, what the Lord will do for them, when He sees <HI>YOƲR Faith</HI> so concerned for them?</P>
<P>Consider, What a <HI>Physician,</HI> O Perishing Souls, what a Glorious <HI>Phy∣sician</HI> you are invited unto.</P>
<P>You have a <HI>Physician,</HI> and He is an
<PB N="29" REF="000926_0029_0FACA37AF1E49158"/>
<HI>Able <HI>Physician</HI>.</HI> It is said of Him, <HI>He is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghty to Save</HI>; yea, Heb. 7.25. <HI>Able to Save unto the uttermost.</HI> There are mischiefs which are <HI>Ludibria Me∣dicorum, Incurable</HI> by those that pro∣fess the <HI>Art of Curing.</HI> Yea, but there are no mischiefs too hard for the <HI>Healing</HI> Hand of the Lord Jesus Christ. Be thy Soul never so Un∣done, and never so Forlorn, and never so Dead, yet mayst thou come to the Lord Jesus Christ, with such terms as those, Matth. 8.2. <HI>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst</HI> help me!</P>
<P>Again;</P>
<P>You have a <HI>Physician,</HI> and He is a <HI>Gracious <HI>Physician</HI>.</HI> All may <HI>Come</HI> unto Him, and <HI>Welcome</HI>: He sayes, Joh. 6.37. <HI>Him that Cometh unto me, I will in no wise Cast out.</HI> Here is a <HI>Physician,</HI> that calls upon <HI>All</HI> to <HI>Look unto Him, and be Healed,</HI> yea, and that will <HI>Heal</HI> them for a <HI>Look.</HI> He <HI>Offers</HI> His Kindnesses to every One of us all; even to the <HI>Poor</HI> as well as the <HI>Rich</HI>: and all upon Free-Cost.
<PB N="30" REF="000926_0030_0FACA37BF47BC2B0"/>
How obligingly does He speak, Isa. 55.2. <HI>Come without Money, and without Price</HI>! He not only sayes, <HI>No Cure, no Pay;</HI> But He sayes, <HI>You shall be sure of a Cure, and then all the Pay shall be to Love and Thank the Lord your Healer.</HI></P>
<P>Once more;</P>
<P>You have a <HI>Physician,</HI> and He is the <HI>Only <HI>Physician</HI>.</HI> There is no other <HI>Physician,</HI> that can do you any Good. We are told, Act. 4.12. <HI>There is not Salvation in any other.</HI> All other Ad∣dresses, will but leave your Souls, as <HI>Helpless</HI> as they were before: There is no <HI>Help,</HI> except in the Name of this Lord! As the <HI>Dying Martyr</HI> Cri∣ed out, so may the <HI>Dying Sinner, None but Christ! None but Christ!</HI> Men may try to lick their Souls whole, with their own <HI>Repentances,</HI> and <HI>Re∣formations,</HI> or may Stupify their Souls, with the <HI>Opiates</HI> of worldly Diversi∣ons; but, O man, if thou keep at a Distance from the Lord Jesus Christ, thy Fate will be that, Jer. 46.11. <HI>In
<PB N="31" REF="000926_0031_0FACA37DC4EB8580"/>
vain shalt thou use many Medicines, for thou shalt not be Cured.</HI></P>
<P>Well then; Repair to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all the <HI>Diseases</HI> of your Souls: And spread them all be∣fore Him; Conceal none of them, Smother none of them. He demands of you, as in Mar. 10.51. <HI>What wilt thou, that I shall do unto thee?</HI> Now, as that Blind man answered, <HI>Lord, That I might Receive my Sight</HI>? So do you answer, <HI>Lord, That my Sin may be Pardoned, Lord, That my Sin may be Conquered, Lord, That my Soul may be brought into a Right Frame, and that thy Image may be Renewed in my Soul; and that my Healed, and Strengthned Soul, may walk in thy wayes, and serve thee in Holiness and Righteousness be∣fore thee, all my Dayes</HI>!</P>
<P>But, Let it be done <HI>Seasonably,</HI> Let it be done <HI>Immediately</HI>; Let it be done before it be <HI>too Late.</HI> An <HI>Isra∣elite</HI> Stung by a <HI>Fiery-Serpent,</HI> would
<PB N="32" REF="000926_0032_0FACA37DF0E77478"/>
not put off his <HI>Looking</HI> unto the <HI>Bra∣sen-Serpent,</HI> that was <HI>lifted up</HI> for the <HI>Healing</HI> of the poisoned, and say, <HI>To morrow will be Time enough!</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ is <HI>lifted up,</HI> on His Cross, in His Gospel, that the Souls of men, <HI>Stung</HI> to Death, by the <HI>Old Serpent,</HI> may be <HI>Healed</HI> by their <HI>Looking</HI> unto Him. Oh, Do not say, <HI>To morrow I'll do this</HI>! For thou hast no Assurance of a <HI>To morrow; Boast not</HI> of it! But of this thou mayest be Assured, That thy <HI>Diseases</HI> will not be <HI>To mor∣row</HI> so likely to be <HI>Healed,</HI> as they are <HI>To Day</HI>; The <HI>longer</HI> thy <HI>Diseases</HI> be upon thee, the <HI>harder</HI> will they be to be <HI>Healed.</HI> Oh, Don't slight the merciful Tenders of thy <HI>Physician,</HI> lest the issue be as to them of Old, 2 Chron. 36.16. <HI>The wrath of the Lord arose, till there was no Remedy.</HI> Be∣hold, <HI>Now is the Day of Salvation</HI>!</P>
<P N="2">II. Cherish in your Souls, a <HI>Sen∣sible Conviction</HI> of the <HI>Sickness,</HI> the <HI>Sinful Sickness</HI> that is upon your Souls.
<PB N="33" REF="000926_0033_0FACA37EA7C11FC0"/>
You are <HI>Sinfully sick</HI>; Oh, become <HI>Sensibly sick.</HI> None, alas, None are so <HI>Sick,</HI> as they that are <HI>Sick,</HI> and <HI>know not that they are Sick</HI>: There is a <HI>Madness</HI> in their <HI>Sickness,</HI> and it is well, if with that <HI>Madness in their Hearts,</HI> they don't <HI>go down to the Dead.</HI> None so <HI>Wretched,</HI> as they, to whom it may be said, Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou know∣est not that thou art Wretched and Mi∣serable.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore;</P>
<P>First; <HI>Meditate, Meditate,</HI> upon your <HI>Diseases,</HI> till <HI>Meditation</HI> do pro∣duce <HI>Conviction.</HI> There was a <HI>Con∣vinced</HI> man, who thus came to be so; Psal. 119.59. <HI>I thought upon my wayes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Meditate</HI> on the <HI>Vileness</HI> of all <HI>Sin</HI>; as it not only <HI>Wrongs</HI> your own Souls, but as it is a Denying, and a Defy∣ing of the Infinite God, and as it pro∣cures and incurs, provokes and in∣vokes, His infinite Wrath.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="000926_0034_0FACA37F6B0EF300"/><HI>Meditate</HI> on the <HI>Number</HI> of your own <HI>Sin</HI>; and set before your selves a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of what is <HI>Forbidden</HI> and what is <HI>Required</HI> in the <HI>Commandments</HI> of God; and see how much you fall into what is <HI>Forbidden,</HI> and fall short of what is <HI>Required.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Meditate</HI> on the <HI>Circumstances</HI> that aggravate your <HI>Sin</HI>; the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Vows,</HI> against which you have <HI>Sinned. Muse, till the Fire Burns</HI>!</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>Secondly; If some <HI>Conviction of Sin</HI> be now produced in you, <HI>Don't Sin it away.</HI> It is the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God, of whom 'tis said, Joh. 16.9. <HI>He shall Convince the world of Sin.</HI> Wherefore, Don't <HI>Grieve,</HI> don't <HI>Vex,</HI> don't <HI>Resist</HI> the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God▪ Hearken, Listen to His motions. And having been by Him <HI>Convinced of Sin,</HI> don't fall to <HI>Sinning</HI> again, but, Oh!

fall to <HI>Praying</HI> unto Him, who <HI>Saves His People from their Sins.</HI></P>
<P>But,</P>
<P>Finally; <HI>Don't stay away</HI> from the Lord Jesus Christ, on a pretence, that you have not <HI>Convictions</HI> enough to <HI>Prepare</HI> you for Him. You must not come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, as <HI>Recommended</HI> by your <HI>Preparati∣ons.</HI> 'Tis not under the notion of <HI>Prepared Sinners,</HI> but of <HI>Perishing Sin∣ners,</HI> that you are to come unto Him: though it be also true, That you will not Come, till you are <HI>Prepared,</HI> by seeing that you are <HI>Pe∣rishing.</HI> If you are so far <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced</HI> of Sin, that you dare not stay away from the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Then, Come!</HI> 'Tis said, Mat 9.13. <HI>I am not Come to call the Righteous, but Sinners unto Repentance.</HI> Is thy sight of thy being a <HI>Sinner</HI> such, that no∣thing but a <HI>Saviour</HI> can content
