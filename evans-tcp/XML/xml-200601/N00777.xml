<HEAD>A Faithful Advice, FROM Several MINISTERS of the Gospel, in and near <HI>Boston,</HI> unto the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI>; relating to the Dangers that may arise from <HI>Impostors,</HI> pretending to be <HI>Ministers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is not without some Concern upon our Minds, that in the late Writings of our <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Bretheren in <HI>England,</HI> we find awful Complaints, about <Q><HI>Bold</HI>
<HI>Intruders</HI> into the Work of the Ministry, &amp; the swarming of that <HI>Vermine,</HI> with an hide∣ous Noise, not in <HI>Corners</HI> and <HI>Chambers,</HI> but in the very <HI>Pulpits</HI>; likely to prove an <HI>E∣gyptian</HI> plague;</Q>
upon which they add,
<Q>If these Illiterate Usurpers are not speedily and effectually discountenanced by Mini∣sters and People too, they who are alrea∣dy the <HI>Blemish</HI> of <HI>Nonconformity,</HI> will quick∣ly prove the total Ruine of it.</Q>
But it satis∣fied us more than a little, to hear of their care that the Confusions thus complained, may be prevented, by a <HI>Vote</HI> of this Impor∣tance,
<PB N="4" REF="000935_0003_0FAD922C97225D00"/>
That they would Employ none to <HI>Preach</HI> in any of their <HI>Pulpits,</HI> but such as ei∣ther arrived unto them with credible <HI>Testimo∣nials,</HI> or submitted themselves unto a solemn <HI>Trial</HI> of their Qualifications for the Evange∣lical Ministry. Our <HI>Congregational</HI> Bretheren in <HI>England,</HI> being alarumed with a clamour of the Dangers hence arising to the Interests of our Holy Religion, we do with a like satisfaction find, they have lately published a Declaration, wherein, signifying,
<Q>That inas∣much as they count none meet to dispense the Oracles of God unto others, who are not themselves Qualified for Communion in all Ordinances, their joining themselves to a <HI>particular Church</HI> of Christ, would be a good Expedient to prevent <HI>Ignorant and Rash Intruders into the Ministry</HI>; seeing then, it would be the Duty of <HI>Particular Churches</HI> and their Officers, to take special care, that none of their Communion, who are not <HI>Qualified,</HI> may enter on that Work; they thereupon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, We Express our Dislike, and witness against all <HI>Ignorant</HI> and <HI>Scanda∣lous</HI> persons, Entring on the <HI>Ministry</HI>; and we do in the Bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ, pray and beseech all such as fear God, that they give not the least Encou∣ragement unto the Preaching of men, either <HI>Ignorant</HI> or <HI>Erroneous</HI> in the Great Articles
<PB N="5" REF="000935_0004_0FAD922D522F3E30"/>
of Faith, or <HI>Scandalous</HI> in their Lives and Conversations, or otherwise <HI>Unmeet for this Holy Employment,</HI> Lest they bring the <HI>Guilt of these mens Sins on their own Souls.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In Conformity to this <HI>Watchfulness</HI> of our <HI>United Brethren,</HI> we cannot but in the most publick manner, call upon our Churches, that they beware of all undue <HI>Precipitancy,</HI> in their Admitting <HI>Unqualified persons,</HI> to be Re∣ceived and Employed, in the Character of <HI>Preachers</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>We have indeed often wished, That the Young men brought up in our own <HI>Universi∣ty,</HI> might appear with <HI>Testimonials,</HI> under the Hands of the <HI>Praesident</HI> and <HI>Fellows,</HI> That up∣on <HI>Trial,</HI> they are found <HI>Able</HI> and <HI>Pious,</HI> and likely to be <HI>Blessings</HI> unto the <HI>Churches</HI>; be∣fore the <HI>Churches</HI> venture too far in setting of them up for <HI>Preachers.</HI></P>
<P>But inasmuch as there have sometimes ar∣rived among us, <HI>Deceitful Strangers,</HI> who have set up themselves for <HI>Preachers,</HI> and many un∣wary people have discovered much sinful Folly, in suffering themselves to be <HI>strangely Deceived</HI> by those <HI>Impostors,</HI> it obliges us un∣to a further point of <HI>Pastoral Vigilance</HI> over the <HI>Churches,</HI> whereof we are made the <HI>Overseers.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis well known, That Worthy <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, Retiring to <HI>New-England,</HI> from other Countreys, have all along met
<PB N="6" REF="000935_0005_0FAD922FA2CA6AF8"/>
with Respects from our Churches, <HI>Equal</HI> (to say no more) unto what they have shown unto any of the <HI>Pastors</HI> bred among them∣selves; Heaven is witness, to the Injustice of the Slander by some uttered against us, <HI>That we have been ever uncivil to Strangers</HI>; and the <HI>Strangers</HI> themselves have been Witnesses, that no where under Heaven could they expect more <HI>Civility,</HI> than that wherewith we have ever treated them.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, we have, upon sufficient Oc∣casions Resolved,
<Q>That for the future, no <HI>Stranger</HI> coming as a <HI>Preacher</HI> among us, without sufficient Assurances of his being what he pretends to be, shall be Employ'd in our <HI>Pulpits,</HI> without a solemn Examinati∣on of his <HI>Capacities,</HI> for the Tremendous Work, of Preaching the <HI>Glorious Gospel of God.</HI></Q>
And we earnestly Request, the Reve∣rend Ministers of the Gospel, in the several Associations and Vicinities throughout the Country, to joyn with us, in such a necessary Resolution.</P>
<P>We do also Solemnly Advise, all our People, to beware of Running after <HI>New Preachers,</HI> of whose Endowments and Principles, they have not had a Reasonable Attestation; lest they unawares run themselves into shameful and woful Reflections. The Apostolical Injuncti∣ons, <HI>To prove all Things,</HI> does not invite Un∣stable
<PB N="7" REF="000935_0006_0FAD9232ACD802D0"/>
people, to <HI>Run after all Preachers,</HI> (as they too often pervert the sence of it,) but it only directs people▪ to <HI>Examine</HI> by the Word of God, the Doctrine, which they hear, from those that in an orderly way are to be heard as their <HI>Teachers.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Preaching of the Gospel,</HI> being that Grand Institution, whereon depends the E∣verlasting Salvation of men, Satan seeks it as a mighty Triumph, to pervert it unto their E∣verlasting Destruction. And a people, that <HI>having Itching Ears, do after their own Lusts heap up Teachers to themselves,</HI> do miserably render themselves, obnoxious unto the Im∣pressions of those <HI>New Preachers,</HI> that will se∣duce them unto <HI>damnable Heresies.</HI> Or, suppose the <HI>New Preachers,</HI> do broach no <HI>New Errors,</HI> yet if they shall prove <HI>Cheats,</HI> that have made the <HI>Preaching of the Gospel</HI> only a <HI>Cloak,</HI> for their <HI>Covetous,</HI> or <HI>Lascivious,</HI> or other profane Designs, they that shall have <HI>too suddenly im∣proved</HI> those men, will be <HI>partakers of their Sins.</HI> And the Glorious Ordinances of God will be likely to fall into a loathsome <HI>Contempt</HI> among the people, if Contemptible Fellows can Easily prostitute them unto their pernici∣ous purposes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sermons,</HI> wherein the <HI>Everlasting Gos∣pel</HI> is <HI>Preached,</HI> as well as the <HI>Prayers</HI> made in our Congregations; are to be Considered, as
<PB N="8" REF="000935_0007_0FAD9233C7E11318"/>
a principal part of the <HI>Worship of God</HI> among the People of God: they are to Glorify God, &amp; our Lord Jesus Christ, with agreeable <HI>Confessions</HI> of the <HI>Truths</HI> He ha's Revealed unto us; &amp;, as in the <HI>Peace Offering</HI> of old, <HI>God</HI> hath <HI>His</HI> part in them, as well as the People <HI>theirs.</HI> Hence, whether the people that are the Hearers, be many or few, learned or weak, froward or meek, the <HI>Preacher</HI> must prepare an <HI>Offering,</HI> as far as he can, Suitable for that God, who is a <HI>Great King and whose Name is Dreadful.</HI> But if E∣very piece of Ignorance, and Arrogance, be set up for a <HI>Preacher,</HI> the Name of the Holy God, will be profaned, with an <HI>Offering,</HI> that is made a <HI>Ridicule</HI> in the <HI>Repetition.</HI></P>
<P>We are not unsensible, that one thing, which ha's much Exposed some <HI>Injudicious people</HI> among us, is, An opinion that <HI>Illiterate Men,</HI> may be Serviceable and Admirable <HI>Preachers.</HI> Now, inasmuch as the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> have given this among their Instructions to their Emissaries, <HI>To teach that Learning is needless in a Minister, and if they understand the Gospel, it is Sufficient,</HI> we are sorry that any of our people should be so <HI>Besotted,</HI> not to say, <HI>Bejesuited.</HI> When the Knowledge of the <HI>Tongues</HI> and <HI>Arts</HI> Revived, <HI>Religion</HI> had a Revival with it: And though some <HI>Unlearned</HI> men have been useful to the Interests of <HI>Religion,</HI> yet no man ever decried <HI>Learning,</HI> but what was, an Ene∣my
<PB N="9" REF="000935_0008_0FAD92341FF8A588"/>
to <HI>Religion,</HI> whether he knew it or no▪ When our Lord, chose <HI>Fishermen</HI> to be <HI>Mi∣nisters,</HI> (which often is impertinently pleaded) He would not send them forth, until they had been a considerable while under His <HI>Tu∣ition,</HI> (a better than the best in any <HI>Colledge</HI> under Heaven!) and <HI>then</HI> also He Miracu∣lously Furnished 'em with more <HI>Learning,</HI> than any of us, by <HI>seven Years Hard Study</HI> can at∣tain unto. If God, should be provoked by the <HI>Unthankfulness</HI> of men, to send the Plague of an <HI>Unlearned Ministry</HI> upon poor <HI>New-England,</HI> soon will the <HI>Wild-Beasts of the Desart¦ly there, the Houses will be full of doleful Creatures, and Owles will dwell there.</HI> Ordinarily, that man, who undertakes the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the Gospel, without some <HI>Education</HI> for it, is, we doubt, in as presumptuous an Error, as the unhappy <HI>Uzzah,</HI> that perished in his <HI>Error</HI>: though we also allow different <HI>measures,</HI> and <HI>places,</HI> for that <HI>Education.</HI> And that man was never worthy to <HI>Preach</HI> one <HI>Sermon,</HI> who did not feel, and would not own, that all the <HI>Learning</HI> that can be had, is little enough to accomplish an <HI>Able Minister of the New Testament.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, As <HI>Luther</HI> observed, That God punished the Primitive Churches, with <HI>False Teachers,</HI> for their starving, and sleighting of their <HI>Faithful Ministers</HI>; Thus, we fear the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> may
<PB N="10" REF="000935_0009_0FAD92A3066CF178"/>
suffer mischiefs in Time to come from <HI>False Teachers</HI>; and we see cause to Admire the Compassion of Heaven unto this Land, that such Dangerous Things have all this Time done so little Damage, unto any of our Churches. But as the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> having been warned by the Apostle, <HI>That grievous Wolves would enter in among them,</HI> was afterwards commended by our Saviour, for so taking the warning, that <HI>they Tried them who said, they were Apostles when they were not so, and found them liars</HI>: Even so, we would hope, that after this Day, no <HI>Untried persons</HI> will be Entertained for <HI>Preachers,</HI> in any of our Colonies.</P>
<P>We lay this Advice before our Churches, purposing to do our part, in attending to it.</P>

<HEAD>An HISTORY, Of Some IMPOSTORS, Remarkably and Seasonably detected, in the Churches of <HI>New England;</HI> Written to maintain the Advice Published by some of the Pastors in those Churches relating to <HI>Impostures,</HI> and prevent all future Mischiefs from them.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a notable Discipline, by which the Reformed Churches in <HI>France,</HI> preserved themselves, from the Into∣lerable Mischiefs, arising by the allow∣ance of <HI>Unworthy Preachers:</HI> Their National <HI>Synods</HI> every Time they Sat, would publish a <HI>Roll</HI> of those <HI>Unworthy Preachers,</HI> that could be found creeping in among them, and with a description of their Feature, and Stature, and other circumstances, like what uses to be given in an <HI>Hue in Cry,</HI> this <HI>Roll</HI> would notify the Crimes laid unto their charge, and admonish all People to beware of Entertaining them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="000935_0011_0FAD92A575014660"/>The Churches of <HI>New England,</HI> have <HI>Here∣tofore</HI> been in such <HI>Good Order,</HI> that no man could be Ordained and Received as a <HI>Pastor</HI> in them, without the Concurrence of the Churches in the Vicinity, and a very solemn and publick Action. But a <HI>Good Order</HI> ha's never yet been provided among us, that no Untryed, and Unfit person, shall set up for a <HI>Preacher,</HI> and run about from Town to Town, getting into the too much <HI>unguarded Pulpits,</HI> and threatning our Holy Religion, with no little <HI>Inconvenience.</HI> Now to prevent and redress, this <HI>Inconvenience,</HI> it ha's been by some Considerate persons desired, That some∣thing like the <HI>French Roll</HI> may be Exhibited unto the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> which may Exemplify some few of the many <HI>Cheats,</HI> that have gone to Impose upon them. It is unreasonable to complain, That the <HI>Crimes</HI> of those Cheats are thus <HI>openly</HI> Exposed; for, I beseech you, Sirs, are they not as <HI>openly</HI> Committed? Men are too insensible, of the horrible <HI>Villany</HI> and <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> in the <HI>Crimes</HI> of those Fellows, who set up for <HI>Teachers</HI> to the people of God, when God knows they are wicked <HI>Vagrants</HI> and <HI>Varlets,</HI> designing to abuse the Honest people; if they imagine it, a <HI>severe</HI> Thing, to stigmatize them, in the view of all the affronted Churches. The Faults of the <HI>Paenitent,</HI> indeed should be <HI>Con∣cealed</HI>;
<PB N="13" REF="000935_0012_0FAD92A622371FF0"/>
but these pretended <HI>Preachers</HI> of <HI>Re∣pentance,</HI> are not known to <HI>practise</HI> the <HI>Repen∣tance</HI> which they <HI>Preach</HI> A <HI>Pillory</HI> were a very gentle punishment for the Wretches, who wholly unqualifyed <HI>Steal</HI> into a <HI>Pulpit,</HI> and <HI>Forge</HI> a <HI>Commission</HI> from the King of Hea∣ven unto His Churches. Our <HI>Laws</HI> not pro∣viding such a punishment for them, they that would be faithful to the Churches, will do well (for did not the Apostle as much to <HI>Hy∣menaeus,</HI> &amp; <HI>Alexander</HI>?) to set them up in an <HI>History,</HI> instead of a <HI>Pillory,</HI> with a <HI>Writing,</HI> as it were in <HI>Capitals,</HI> to signifie, THESE WERE IMPOSTORS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTEEMED MINISTERS.</P>
<P>The Consequence and Advantage of this Action, 'tis hoped, will be, That both <HI>Pastors</HI> &amp; <HI>People,</HI> will be more wary of being too sud∣den, in asking to <HI>Preach</HI> for them, those to whom they are utter <HI>Strangers: That</HI> needy and profane <HI>Strangers,</HI> will no more venture to <HI>Preach</HI> in a Country, where their detected Wickedness will be proclaimed for the <HI>Terror</HI> of all that shall come after them: <HI>That</HI> all pious minds will give glory to the Lord Je∣sus Christ, who <HI>Walks in the midst of His Churches,</HI> when they see what <HI>Quick Work,</HI> He has ordinarily made in these Churches, to discover those <HI>Atheistical Preachers,</HI> that have so horribly mocked Him: and admire
<PB N="14" REF="000935_0013_0FAD92A6DB981258"/>
His Gracious and Watchful <HI>Providence,</HI> in still delivering His Churches, from those <HI>Little Foxes,</HI> that would have spoiled them. And now, we will Address our selves to do that, which when 'tis done, what will they merit but the Cardinals Blessing, who will take no warning?</P>
<P N="1">§ 1. THE very <HI>First Minister</HI> (one <HI>Ly∣ford</HI>) that ever came into <HI>New En∣gland,</HI> (which was in the Year, 1624.) at his first coming did Caress the good people at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> with such extream shows of Affect∣ion and Humility, that the people were mightily taken with him, nevertheless within a little while, he used most malignant Endea∣vours to make <HI>Factions</HI> among them, and con∣found all their <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Sacred</HI> Order. At last there fell into the Hands of the Gover∣nour, his <HI>Letters</HI> home to <HI>England,</HI> fill'd with wicked and lying Accusations against the people, of which things being shamefully con∣victed, he did publickly in the Church confess with Tears, <HI>That he had slanderously abused the good people, and that God might justly lay inno∣cent Blood unto his Charge, for he knew not what hurt might have come through his Writings, and that Pride, Vain glory, and self love had been the causes of his miscarriages.</HI> These things he ut∣tered so pathetically, that they again permit∣ted
<PB N="15" REF="000935_0014_0FAD92A79E4A3DF0"/>
him to Preach among them: And yet in two or three months be so notoriously re∣newed his miscarriages, which he had thus bewailed, that his own Wife, thro' the Affli∣ction of her mind at his Hypocrisy, could not forbear declaring her Fears, that God would bring some heavy Judgment upon their Family, not only for these, but some former Impieties by him committed, especially in fearful Breaches of the <HI>Seventh Commandment,</HI> which he had with an Oath deny'd, though they were afterwards Evinced. Being there∣upon Banished, he went unto <HI>Virginia,</HI> where he soon ended his Dayes.</P>
<P>The Disaster thus befalling of this Coun∣try in the <HI>First Minister,</HI> that ever came into it, seems to have been an Intimation from Heaven unto the Country, to beware in all after times, how they suffered <HI>Cheats</HI> in the Evangelical <HI>Ministry</HI> to be Imposed upon them. Nevertheless, there have Crept in se∣veral <HI>Cheats,</HI> among the Churches, which have been speedily, and notably Detected. It will be neither Needful, nor Useful, that they should be <HI>all</HI> Enumerated: <HI>Some</HI> of them shall.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. MAny among us, do still Remember, a Fellow that made himself Me∣morable, by Preaching Zelously on that Text, <HI>Let him that Stole, Steal no more</HI>; when he
<PB N="16" REF="000935_0015_0FAD92A85752AC30"/>
had at that very Time a parcel of <HI>Stolen</HI> Money in his Pocket. The Sum, as I re∣member, was <HI>Five Pounds,</HI> but in the dozed Conscience of the Thief, hardly made the weight of a <HI>Scruple.</HI></P>
<P N="3">§ 3. I Have been informed, That a certain Gentleman in the Southern parts of this I and, having with much pains, taught an <HI>Irish Servant</HI> in his Family, to be <HI>almost</HI> able to read <HI>English</HI>; this fellow, after his Time was out, set up for a <HI>Preacher</HI> in a Neighbour∣ing Plantation: But the Gentleman his Master, happening some Time after to meet our Preaching <HI>Teague,</HI> Severely Chid him, for his presumpteous Arrogance, and among other Expressions, bestowed this pretty <HI>Saty∣rical</HI> Scourge upon him; <HI>If such Fellows as thou art, may set up for Preachers, there will be one Text impossible ever to be Preached upon, or to be fulfilled or understood: The Almighty in one Text, threatens as a Judgment,</HI> A Famine of Hear∣ing the Word of the Lord; <HI>But if such Varlets as thou art, may be Preachers, 'tis im∣possible, that such a Judgment should ever be Ex∣ecuted</HI>!</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. MAny of those persons, who have gone to Insinuate themselves in∣to our Churches, with <HI>Spirits</HI> in them, that
<PB N="17" REF="000935_0016_0FAD92A931C5CE58"/>
were for their Coveteous, or Contentious, or Ambitious, or otherwise Evil Inclinations, displeasing to the <HI>God of the Spirits of all Flesh,</HI> have been immediately and remarkably con∣founded, by their being left unto the Crimi∣minal Folly of Preaching <HI>Stollen Sermons.</HI> The detected <HI>Plagiaries,</HI> have gone off, <HI>as a Thief is Ashamed when he is found.</HI> One happy Hindrance to the Designs of the <HI>Fiery Serpent</HI> have been this <HI>way</HI> afforded among us.</P>
<P>Others <HI>Remember</HI> Instances; I shall not <HI>mention</HI> them.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5 A Young Fellow, (one <HI>Dick Swayn</HI>) that had been Servant unto a Cap∣tain of a Ship in <HI>Boston,</HI> after a thousand Rogueries, had his Time given him, by the Widow of the Captain, when she became so, because that she would not be troubled with so Thevish, Lying and Wicked a Villian. This Fellow was afterwards detected in Vil∣lanies, enough to fill a Volumn, which pro∣cured his going in miserable circumstances to <HI>Virginia</HI>; from whence he got through se∣veral Stages, at length unto the Island of <HI>Providence</HI>! There the Monster set up for a Preacher of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and putting on a Mighty show of Religion, he was Mightily followed and admired; and the people treat∣ed him with a more than ordinary Liberality. Percieving that it was Time to be gone from
<PB N="18" REF="000935_0017_0FAD92A9D2150B28"/>
thence, he forged Letters of his Fathers Death in <HI>England,</HI> by which a vast Estate was fallen to him; under the umbrage of that Forgery, he gets off immediately by a Vessel, that must first carry him to <HI>New England.</HI> Having Preached several Sermons in the Southern parts of <HI>New England,</HI> he comes to <HI>Boston,</HI> in the year 1698. Where in private Houses, he would be ridiculously forward in thrust∣ing himself upon <HI>Prayer,</HI> which he would manage with a Noise, that might reach all the Neighbourhood. He began to Court Opportunities of <HI>Preaching</HI> among the Neigh∣bours; but forgetting to change his Name, the Gentlewoman to whose Deceased Hus∣band he had been a Servant, accidentally coming in to the House is here he lodged, and hearing one of that Name exceedingly cryed up, as a worthy, able, eminent man, ask'd for a sight of him. When to her Astonishment she found it was <HI>Dick,</HI> even that very Scan∣dalous <HI>Dick,</HI> that had plaid for many abomi∣nable Pranks in her own Family some years ago. The Gentlewoman could Scarce be∣lieve her Eyes; and finding the Vagrant not give her any intelligent Account how he be∣came a <HI>Christian,</HI> it was yet more unintelligi∣ble to her, how he became a <HI>Minister.</HI> He begg'd her Pardon for all his old <HI>Knaveries,</HI> but she being advised that he was now practising of <HI>New</HI> ones, took a course that the
<PB N="19" REF="000935_0018_0FAD92AC7A5C3750"/>
people should be deprived of so <HI>Charming</HI> a <HI>Preacher,</HI> as no doubt, some of the Giddy Populace would have counted him. So with∣out any more Disturbance, but only the cheating some credulous Folks, of considera∣ble Sums of Money, he marched off.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. A Fellow, in this present year, 1699 appeared in <HI>Boston,</HI> pretending to be a Minister: concerning whom, an Honest and a Discreet man, in the Country having a just Fear, lest our Charity should unjustly, and unawares▪ take too kind notice of him, wrote me the following Account.</P>
<P><Q>This day, a man, whose Name is <HI>Eleazer Kingsberry,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in discourse with him, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, He had Preached the Gospel four Months; He shewed me a <HI>Certificate</HI> to prove it, with about Twelves Names to it, all Written by his own Hand, (the Instru∣ment was drawn by another,) He also told me, he Preached the last Sabbath, between <HI>Tanton</HI> and <HI>Freetown,</HI> before a considerable As∣sembly; which was confirmed by a man of <HI>Tanton</HI> then present. Considering how God is likely to be dishonoured, and the Gospel scandalized, by him, I thought it my Duty to undeceive you, by giving you, the following Relation. He was born, and brought up in <HI>Wrentham,</HI> and bound pren∣tice
<PB N="20" REF="000935_0019_0FAD92AD61C4AF10"/>
to a <HI>Tailor,</HI> but so Vitious a Servant, that his Master could do no Good with him. He gat <HI>Free,</HI> and Married a Wife; but not long after <HI>Stole,</HI> and left her; and adding to his <HI>Felony</HI> several other Vicious Tricks, he went to the <HI>Westward.</HI> From thence he wrote a Letter to <HI>Wrentham,</HI> which consisted chiefly of <HI>Lyes</HI> and <HI>Curses.</HI> When I now spake with him, I advised him to follow his <HI>Calling,</HI> and provide for his <HI>Wife,</HI> and not seek to Dishonour God, and deceive his People. He replied, As for his Wife, she was a Devillish Jade, and he would never take her more; but when he was Settled, and had an House, he would take her as a Servant; and if she would not obey him, he would kick her into the Fire; but he would go on in <HI>Preaching,</HI> — and he <HI>would wage twenty pieces of Eight, he would get Money, and Credit in a short Time.</HI> — I could fill a Sheet of paper, but I hope, I have said enough to prevent his having any En∣couragement from you; and what further ought to be done concerning him, I leave to your Consideration.</Q></P>
<P>One of the Ministers, in <HI>Boston,</HI> immedi∣ately sent after him, a Letter under a flying Seal, Solemnly charging him, to leave off the presumpteous and Blasphemous course, that he had thus taken up, and return unto his
<PB N="21" REF="000935_0020_0FAD92AD98360B38"/>
Family and Employment; and giving him to understand, that the <HI>Justices</HI> every where should be informed of him, as being, <HI>A Va∣gabond.</HI> Hereupon, the <HI>Vagabond,</HI> as I am told, changed his Name into <HI>Berry,</HI> &amp; Ran away to a place called, Cape <HI>May,</HI> where I am also told, the people were so <HI>Bewitched</HI> with him, that they were almost ready to tear in pieces any man, that should speak diminutively of him.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. BUT tho' this Bird flew away to the Southward, unto Cape <HI>May,</HI> ano∣ther, whose pretended Name was <HI>May</HI> came upon this Coast about the same Time. And on that Occasion, an Excellent and Ingenious person, wrote unto me such passages as these.</P>
<P><Q><HI>May</HI> uses to prove Pleasant and Healthy; but the <HI>Mob</HI> are wont to Dance, at the En∣trance of it, let it prove how it will. Mr. <HI>Parker</HI> used to say, <HI>The people love to Tap a New Barrel.</HI> I think, I once told you of <HI>E. F.</HI> and <HI>M. J.</HI> but lest I have not, I'le give you a word of each.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>E. F.</HI> Sometimes of <HI>Salem,</HI> coming to <HI>New Haven,</HI> on Saturday▪ Even, being Cloa∣thed in <HI>Black,</HI> was taken for a <HI>Minister,</HI> and was able to Ape one, and Humoured the mistake, like him that said, <HI>Si vult populus decipi, decipiatur.</HI> Word being carried to
<PB N="22" REF="000935_0021_0FAD92AE577D9C60"/>
Mr. <HI>J.T.</HI> that a <HI>Minister</HI> was come to Town, he immediately procured him to Preach both parts of the Day. The First was to Acceptation; but in the Last Exercise, he plentifully shewed himself to be a why msi∣cal Opinionist, and besides Railed like <HI>Rab∣shakeh,</HI> and Reviled the Magistrates, Mini∣sters and Churches, at such a rate, that the people were ready to pull him out of the Pulpit.</Q></P>
<P N="8">§ 8. THe same Worthy Person goes on▪
<Q><HI>M. J.</HI> A Welch Tanner by Trade, some time Servant unto Capt. <HI>P.</HI> at <HI>Salem,</HI> left <HI>Salem,</HI> went to <HI>Say-brook,</HI> workt at his Trade, and Stole Mr. <HI>W.'s</HI> Leather Bree∣ches. Thence he went to <HI>Staten Island,</HI> by <HI>New-York,</HI> and Set up for a <HI>Preacher,</HI> being a ready <HI>Prater.</HI> At the Informati∣on of a pedling Trader, he had an Invi∣tation by some few of <HI>Killingworth,</HI> to visit them▪ and Preach in order to Settlement. He came; but hapning to speak irreve∣rently of something in the Scripture, be∣fore some of the people, it occasioned such Division &amp; Tumult, that he was not suffered to Preach, before Mr. <HI>Buckinghams</HI> Advice and consent was obtained; which when sought, he advised them to Enquire first whether this were not the Fellow that
<PB N="23" REF="000935_0022_0FAD92AF1D4F7E88"/>
Stole the Leather Breeches. This proving even so, prevented him at <HI>Killingsworth.</HI> Thence he went to <HI>Brainford,</HI> the night before a Fast, and making known his pre∣tended Function it was counted a good Providence; for they had no Minister, and he was earnestly desired to Preach, and as readily accepted it. But one <HI>Peter Stent,</HI> a Brother that used to Pray and Read a good Sermon among the People, when they had no Minister, knew nothing of this, (for he lived at a Farm,) but in the morning came provided, to Read one of Mr. <HI>A. Grayes,</HI> Sermons. But he found <HI>Morgan</HI> at it, when he came; and when he named his Text, it was the same <HI>his</HI> intended Sermon was on: and out of Curiosity, to see how mens wits jumpt in prosecuting the same Text, he turned to his Book, and found <HI>Morgan</HI> the same with Mr. <HI>Gray,</HI> word for word. He followed him while he was weary, and at length run before, to a place in the Sermon, that spoke of <HI>Glasgow Sinners,</HI> and there Lay wait for <HI>Morgan</HI>▪ but when he came there, he turned it, <HI>New England Sin∣ners</HI>; and that was all the variation in the whole Sermon. The people were mightily affected with the Sermon, and were hot up∣on calling <HI>Morgan</HI> to the Ministry. But <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt</HI> discovered the Cheat. So they dis∣missed
<PB N="24" REF="000935_0023_0FAD92AFDCA315D0"/>
him, and the <HI>Tanner</HI> departed with Liberty to go as far as a New pair of <HI>Shoes</HI> would carry him.</Q></P>
<P N="9">§ 9 <HI>FAscination</HI> is a thing, whereof man∣kind ha's more <HI>Experience</HI> than <HI>Comprehension.</HI> And <HI>Fascination</HI> is never more notoriously sensible, than in Mens Running after <HI>False Teachers</HI> of Religion. When <HI>False Teachers</HI> Imposed on the <HI>Galatians,</HI> the Apo∣stle said, <HI>O Foolish Galatians, who hath bewitch∣ed you!</HI> One cannot easily ascribe unto a Truer cause, than a <HI>Satanick Energy,</HI> the strange <HI>Biass</HI> upon the minds of a multitude, forceably and furiously sometimes carrying them into Follies, from whence the plainest Reason in the World will not Reclame them. What, but such an <HI>Energy</HI> could be upon the minds of many people in <HI>Boston,</HI> after the Arrival of one that went by the Name of <HI>Samuel May,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>July,</HI> 1699. The wonderful Success of <HI>Mahomet</HI> upon a World where Christianity was to a∣nother Degree lost, than it is yet in <HI>Boston,</HI> was no longer a wonder unto us, when we saw the Success of <HI>May,</HI> in a place of so Christian a Character as <HI>Boston.</HI> It was all over pure <HI>Enchantment!</HI> He show'd unto one Minister at his first Arrival, a <HI>Testimonial</HI> of little but some hopes of his being a man of
<PB N="25" REF="000935_0024_0FAD92B188BF0380"/>
<HI>a sweet Gospel Spirit,</HI> Signed with two Names, whereof one was of a man, that once had been a Scandalous <HI>Fire Ship,</HI> among the Churches in this Country: Which when this Blade understood, he would never after show his <HI>Testimonial</HI> to any more of our Mi∣nisters, tho' they earnestly and frequently ask'd him for it. So <HI>Silly</HI> and <HI>Shallow</HI> a per∣son he was, that it was impossible for any but such to be many miputes in his Company without being sensible of it. The first thing that made some to suspect him was, his using to Lift up his <HI>Eyes</HI> and <HI>Hands,</HI> with strains of Devotion used by none others in the Assem∣bly, after he had first look'd about to see who look'd upon him. Numberless marks of a <HI>Cheat,</HI> were daily more and more disco∣vered in him; nevertheless, he was able to imitate a plausible <HI>Utterance</HI> and <HI>Action,</HI> and seem'd so zealously set upon <HI>Inviting men to Christ,</HI> that after Sermon was over, he would make <HI>another Speech,</HI> to put 'em in mind on't. Abundance of the people became so fiercely set for him, that they poured out a thou∣sand expressions of Rage, upon the Faithful Pastors of the Town, that thought not such an <HI>Illiterate</HI> Creature, (who by his own Confession, had never been one year under any Education,) worthy to be set up in the publick Pulpits. Though the bigger and
<PB N="26" REF="000935_0025_0FAD92B2D55B3960"/>
wiser part of the Town, were not seized with this <HI>Bigotry,</HI> yet a multitude became so Furious, that making it their business, to solicit all sorts of persons, to go a <HI>Maying</HI> with them, if any Refused, they could hard∣ly escape some Reproach for it. The <HI>Jews</HI> were hardly more engaged for their <HI>Sabatai Sevi.</HI> The Disciples of this <HI>Money Catcher,</HI> became so <HI>Exceeding Fierce,</HI> many of them, that some sober men, became afraid of <HI>Pas∣sing by that way,</HI> where one must Encounter them. Though he were detected in several Crimes, as, pretending to <HI>Languages</HI> which he knew nothing of, and this in the special Service and Presence of the Lord; and Preach∣ing <HI>Stollen Sermons,</HI> wherein he could not pro∣duce one material Sentance of his own; and horrid <HI>Lying,</HI> in very Repe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Instances▪ Yet his Followers would go on, making <HI>Ri∣diculous Apoligies</HI> for him; and <HI>Malicious In∣vectives</HI> against any that would not yet believe him an <HI>Eminent Saint.</HI> Yea, they began to throw <HI>Bibels</HI> into the Houses of the Ministers, the most insolent that ever I saw. The <HI>Ana∣baptists</HI> Employ'd him at their <HI>Meeting-House,</HI> which was now filled with great Congregati∣ons: and it was an undeserved, an astonishing, a very memorable <HI>Mercy</HI> of God unto the Town, that this man, was now kept from venting any <HI>Heresies</HI> among a people, that
<PB N="27" REF="000935_0026_0FAD92B3B73DEC08"/>
made themselves to become such <HI>Tynder,</HI> for any Sparks, that he might strike into them. And yet it was another Mercy as great as This, that the Young Women in the Town, were not betray'd and debauch'd into fearful Whoredoms. For, at length, Witnesses, Good, Vertuous, Credible Witnesses appear'd, that shew'd him, to have been as dangerous a <HI>Devil,</HI> as the poor Young Women could have met withal, when, by a certain Reverence for him as a Minister, they were prepared for his vile Sollicitations. He perceived these things beginning to break out; and away he new: none of the Endeavours used by his Admirers, to make him stay, could stop him. The <HI>Pastors</HI> of the Churches, had before made this Reflection, That after men of the of most unspotted Piety, have spent whole Prentice-ships of Years, in the faithful, watch∣ful, painful Service of the Churches, and have served them Day and Night; with Prayers, with Tears, with Fastings, with their most studied Sermons, and Writings, and have never such a Reputation with the Churches in Countreys afar off; yet if any <HI>Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing</HI> do come with a few Good Words among them, the <HI>simple Souls</HI> of many▪ will not only follow the <HI>Wolf,</HI> but on his Account bark at the <HI>Shepherds.</HI> This is a <HI>Vanity, that I have seen under the Sun.</HI> But the <HI>People</HI> had now this Reflection to make; That
<PB N="28" REF="000935_0027_0FAD92B517816138"/>
since they had Sinfully sleighted their most Serviceable <HI>Pastors,</HI> who never craved after the <HI>Riches</HI> of this World, they should by the just Judgment of God, be left unto such an Infatuation, as to Enrich a <HI>Craving Beggar,</HI> with many Pounds of their Substance; which <HI>Beggarly Stranger,</HI> immediately apply'd him∣self, (not to instil the Fear of God, and Love of Christ, into your Children, O Injured People, as your <HI>Pastors</HI> do, with a most inde∣fatigable Application! but) to teach them, that Fornication and Adultery is no Sin, and to watch oppotunities of making them, like himself, the <HI>Children of the Devil.</HI> Repent, O Infatuated People; Repent, of what you have done; and let the Ensuing <HI>Letter,</HI> help you more throughly to consider the occasions for your doing so.</P>

A LETTER, Containing a Remarkable HISTORY, OF AN Impostor.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am going to Entertain you, with a very surpising Story, by the Communication whereof, the Wisdom, and Goodness, and Justice of <HI>Heaven,</HI> will become Ob∣servable to many Christian Minds, and the <HI>Devices</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI> against the Interests of <HI>Heaven,</HI> be a little more fully understood, and by being understood, for the future prevented.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="000935_0029_0FAD92B69AF23180"/>The Last Summer, in the very Ship that brought us Letters from our Friends i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the Nonconformists from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fellows, that pretended unto the <HI>Preaching of the Glo∣rious Gospel,</HI> there arrived unto us a man, that pretended the Name of <HI>Samuel May,</HI> and the character of a <HI>Preacher</HI>; having with him a Woman whom he call<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>d his <HI>Wife,</HI> but used her with an <HI>Unwifely Crabbedness,</HI> that gave Scandal to the people aboa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>d. Albeit this man gave me much cause to be suspicious, Lest <HI>he</HI> might be one of those whom our Letters complained of, yet my compassion towards a <HI>Needy Stranger,</HI> whom I saw, in ragged, wretched, forlorn circumstances, cau∣sed me among other wayes of being Helpful unto him, to seek that he might be twice Employ'd in, and Requited for Preaching at our <HI>Private Meetings</HI>; hoping thereby to have a little <HI>Trial</HI> of him His <HI>Plausible Delivery,</HI> presently <HI>Enchanted</HI> abundance of Honest people, who thought <HI>all was Gold that glistered</HI>; but many Dayes passed not, before I found several Things, which made me say, <HI>I doubted, he was a Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing</HI> They that now say, They fol∣low'd this man, because I commended him, wrong me very much; for though 'tis not my manner <HI>to speak ill</HI> of men, till I <HI>know</HI> what
<PB N="31" REF="000935_0030_0FAD92B7EA9BE9C8"/>
I <HI>speak,</HI> and that it is my Duty to <HI>Speak,</HI> yet I let fall words from the very first, that any Intelligent Hearer might see I had some <HI>Fear</HI> about him. The cause of that <HI>Fear</HI> was this; I found, That altho' 'tis no time of any <HI>Persecution,</HI> that should force a∣ny but Ill men to <HI>Conceal themselves,</HI> yet he came Aboard the Vessel under some <HI>Conceal∣ment,</HI> not professing, nor supposed, for to be a <HI>Minister</HI>▪ but rather a <HI>Mendicant,</HI> until they had Sailed many Leagues. I found that he could mention the Name of no one <HI>Minister</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> with whom he durst say, that he had any Acquaintance; Lest, as it should seem, he should happen to mention one, with whom we should be better Acquainted. I found, that he was unaccountably <HI>Shy,</HI> of giving us any satisfactory Account of his O∣riginal, his Education, his former circum∣stances; by no means, could I get him, to tell me, in what Employment, he had spent the first six or seven and twenty years of his Life. What appear'd most <HI>probable</HI> (and since, more <HI>probable</HI>) was, That he was a <HI>Barber. <HI>A blind Charity</HI>,</HI> would still have perswaded me, to keep alive some <HI>hope,</HI> that <HI>Folly</HI> rather than <HI>Design,</HI> might ly at the bot∣tom of his odd conduct; but I soon observ∣ed <HI>something</HI> that made me say to some of my Intimate <HI>Friends, That I fear'd, he
<PB N="32" REF="000935_0031_0FAD92B826A7A140"/>
would prove at last, a smutty, filthy, wanton Fellow.</HI> However, Things not being yet come to that maturity, I contented my self with calling to mind, the Rule which the Old <HI>Briton</HI> gave his Country-men, to discover whether <HI>Austin</HI> the <HI>Monk</HI> were a <HI>Man of God</HI> or no. Thought I,
<Q>If this be an <HI>Honest</HI> man, he is an <HI>Humble</HI> man: If he be a <HI>Faithful Servant</HI> of Christ, he'll plainly let his <HI>Fellow Servants</HI> know what he <HI>is,</HI> what he <HI>intends,</HI> what he <HI>can</HI> do, and humbly re∣fer himself to <HI>Them</HI> for <HI>Direction</HI> and <HI>Assist∣ance.</HI></Q>
We found nothing of This; but though he were wholly <HI>Illiterate,</HI> and not able, even to write a little Common English. (for instance, there were <HI>Eighteen</HI> horrid <HI>false Spells,</HI> and not <HI>One point,</HI> in one very short. Note, that I received from him,) yet this proud <HI>Thraso,</HI> would in his Preaching, Ostentate skill in <HI>Latin,</HI> and in <HI>Greek,</HI> yea, and in <HI>Hebrew</HI>; But God left him to such <HI>Folly</HI> in his <HI>pride,</HI> that he frequently pronoun∣ced the <HI>Exotic Words,</HI> in a manner so ridiculous, as to render it plain, that he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w nothing of them: &amp; in one of those two or three pri∣vate <HI>Preachments,</HI> by which 'twas hop'd, we might have some Taste of his Faculties, he was under such an Infatuation, that he would needs give some <HI>Hebrew</HI> to us; but what he gave us, might be <HI>Welch</HI> or <HI>Irish,</HI> or the <HI>Va∣gabonds
<PB N="33" REF="000935_0032_0FAD92B8DE110198"/>
Can't,</HI> for ought I knew; One Mini∣ster present, knew it was not in six or seven Languages, in all which himself had in vari∣ous Writings Address'd the world, and others of his Hearers besides I, knew that there was no such <HI>Hebrew</HI> in the <HI>Lexicon.</HI> Who, but one <HI>Hypocritically</HI> disposed would have done so? If he were a <HI>Shaver,</HI> 'twas plain however, he was not the most <HI>Cunning</HI> in the world: In the mean time, 'twas a strange <HI>Enchantment</HI> upon the people, that they should after these things, put themselves <HI>into</HI> his Hands. But that his <HI>Humility</HI> might be the more notorious, I was presently informed, that the Blade with an <HI>Arrogance</HI> equal to his <HI>Ignorance,</HI> began to complain, That the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Town, did not immediately Invite him, into their Pulpits; and upon his Complaints, many sinful people, (who have great cause to take no little shame unto them∣selves, for their causeless and shameless Ini∣quity) began to Defame the Ministers, with Slanderous Outcries, <HI>That they were alwayes uncivil to Strangers</HI>; and some could bestow this Comparison upon them, <HI>That here was come, a better Workman than themselves, whom therefore they would not suffer to stay in the Town, if they could help it.</HI> The Pastors of the Churches, being desirous to answer the Expectations of the people, as far as they
<PB N="34" REF="000935_0033_0FAD92B9935A9318"/>
could, in Conscience unto the people them∣selves, and with credit unto the Evangelical Ministry, they sent unto this man, in as Lo∣ving and as Tender Terms, as they could, a Message to this purpose, <HI>That they being sin∣cerely desirous to Encourage him, in doing all the Good he should be found Able to do, and he not having brought Satisfactory Testimonials into the Countrey with him, they pray'd a visit from him, in which they would inform themselves of his Abilities, for the Evangelical Ministry, and with all possible Easiness proceed in their Examining and Advising of him.</HI> To this Message there was brought us from him, an Answer of this purport, <HI>That he knew no Authority the Ministers had to Enquire after him, and he was not bound to give them an account of him∣self,</HI> and more to that Effect. The Mini∣sters had now done but the Duty of <HI>Watch∣men,</HI> that would be found faithful to the Churches and Neighbours; but none of their <HI>Watchfulness</HI> could hinder many of the people, from the great fault of <HI>running them∣selves into Temptation,</HI> by giddily running af∣ter the Instructions of a Fellow, that had <HI>Shunn'd the Light, because his Deeds were Evil.</HI> The people, (whose <HI>Charity</HI> has been for the most part so <HI>Exemplary,</HI> that, methinks 'tis pitty it should ever be <HI>misplaced</HI> and <HI>perverted</HI>) some of them not only made a

large Collection, to pay the <HI>Passage</HI> of this mischievous <HI>Beggar,</HI> and put <HI>Money</HI> into his Pocket; but also fill'd the Town, with so much Lying and Outrage against their faith∣ful Ministers, for not counting such an <HI>Un-Lettered Thing,</HI> a fit Instructor for their Flocks, that I could not but think an hun∣dred times of the people <HI>Bewitched by Simon the Sorcerer,</HI> and say, <HI>That the greatest Blemish, that ever befel the Town, was in the madness, which th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> now discovered.</HI> Who would have believed it, that in a Town so Illuminated as <HI>Boston,</HI> there should be any people of such a principle, <HI>That if the greatest Villian in the World, should arrive a total Stranger among us, and for his True Name, give us perhaps only the first Syllable of his Name, and of a Barber turn a Preacher, the Pastors here must immediately Set him up in the publick Pulpits, or else the people justly load them with all the Calumnious Indig∣nities that can be thought of?</HI> However, the Ministers bore with patience all the Contempt which their Great Lord, saw the people foo∣lishly cast upon them; and no two of them that ever I heard of, ever let fall one word, publickly to <HI>Rebuke</HI> their Folly; But, Syr, You shall see anon, Whether the Lord Him∣self will not <HI>Rebuke</HI> it, and make the people wish, <HI>They had hearkened unto the Voice of their Teachers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="000935_0035_0FAD92BC0EC1D500"/>We have in our Vicinity, a <HI>Small Congre∣gation</HI> of <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> with whom I had al∣wayes Lived in a <HI>Good Correspondence.</HI> For∣give me the vanity, if I say, without judging it proper in this place, to <HI>prove</HI> what I say, That never any Minister so distant from their perswasion, carried it with more civility, and Affection towards persons of their per∣swasion, then I made it my Endeavour to do Because, I believed, there were Godly persons among them, I offered them, that if they should come (as they were likely) to have the Divine <HI>Institutions</HI> fail among them∣selves, I would freely accept them to Com∣munion with my own Flock; and though they should be so scrupulous as to Turn their Backs as often as an <HI>Infant</HI> was <HI>Baptised,</HI> it should not be made an offence. This Offer I made them, I hope not out of a sinful Af∣fectation to <HI>Enlarge</HI> my Flock; The most undeserved Favour of Heaven, has Employ'd my poor Services, in such Assemblies, that I have cause to Study how I may <HI>Serve</HI> them <HI>better</HI> before I go to get them <HI>Larger</HI>; but it was purely from a <HI>Spirit of Charity.</HI> Indeed, <HI>I</HI> had no Answer but this, <HI>We look upon you, as an Unbaptized man, and therefore we cannot hold Communion with you:</HI> But tho' this <HI>New-Comer</HI> were in their Opinion, <HI>An Unbaptised man,</HI> yet they now took this opportunity, to

Invite <HI>him,</HI> unto publick and constant Prea∣ching every <HI>Lords Day,</HI> and <HI>Lecture</HI> besides, in their <HI>Meeting-House.</HI> Indeed, I must so far <HI>Vindicate</HI> these <HI>Brethren,</HI> as to tell you, That they do not seem to me, so much in <HI>Fault,</HI> as divers other people of my own pro∣fession, who Solicited them, and Instigated them, to Set up a Preacher for them, which their own <HI>Pastors</HI> had Refused; and it was on some Accounts a Time of <HI>Temptation</HI> with them. Nevertheless, I cannot wholly <HI>Justify</HI> this <HI>Faulty Action</HI>: And their Setting up such a Fellow, under all these Ill Circumstances, to be their <HI>Publick Teacher,</HI> look'd the worse, because they could not but see, that it nou∣rished in his Numerous Proselytes, not only the sleight of a <HI>Learned Ministry,</HI> but also a disposition which ordinarily Inspired those that were proselyted by him, to become <HI>E∣nemies</HI> and <HI>Revilers</HI> of the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Town. One of those <HI>Ministers</HI> beholding the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which this thing was done withal, freely told the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> That <HI>the Lord Je∣sus Christ, who saw what Principles they acted upon, would certainly make this very man, the Occasion of the greatest Confusion that ever befel them</HI>: And at the same Time, saw cause to Foretel unto many others, <HI>That the Devices of Satan in this matter were, for this man, to Engage many of our weaker People, to be his

<Q>The <HI>Ministers</HI> of this Town, who have by your means been greatly &amp; ungratefully Reviled, will, I suppose, trouble themselves no far∣ther about you, Except some remarkable Occasion oblige them to it: but they will carry their <HI>Flocks</HI> to the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and they will carry their <HI>Names</HI> to the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and they will carry <HI>You</HI> also unto the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>; but I believe, the <HI>Consequence</HI> of This, will very speedily be unto <HI>You,</HI> very uncomfortable.</Q>
He, and his Creatures, went on filling the Town with <HI>Slander,</HI> in Instances, which I desire to <HI>Forgive</HI> and <HI>Forget</HI>: Only one of them, I will mention, because they made more than ordinary Noise about it. Having too just cause to fear, that this Insolent Fel∣low, would <HI>Steal</HI> an Admission to the <HI>Lords Table,</HI> in my own Church, I went unto his House, on purpose to <HI>Forbid</HI> him from it; but they spread a story over the Town, that I came to <HI>Invite</HI> him to it. Many Dayes did not now pass, before I did by a singular Ac∣cident,

meet with a Book of Dr. <HI>Samuel Boltons,</HI> wherein there is a Discourse about, <HI>The Royalties of Faith</HI>; and this Discourse, to my Surprise, I found so very much the same, with what I had my self heard this man de∣liver, that I thought the two Boyes in <HI>Plautus,</HI> were not more alike, <HI>Dixitqu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sibi sua C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncio, Fur es.</HI> I sent for many other of the Hear∣ers, who had better <HI>Memories</HI> than my self, and offered them, to give them a considera∣ble Price for every Sentence they could call to mind, in their Dr. <HI>Samuel May's</HI> Discourse, that I could not show them in my Dr. <HI>Samuel Boltons</HI>; which offer they some of them took, but could not find <HI>One Sentence</HI> for their Ad∣vantage: The Exact Agreement, between <HI>Samuel</HI> the <HI>Doctor,</HI> and <HI>Sam</HI> the <HI>Dunce,</HI> was a diverting Surprize to all that saw it. Here∣upon, a Minister of the Town, visited the man himself, and profered him a <HI>Piece of Eight,</HI> for every material Sentence, that he could produce, of his own Discourse, about, <HI>The Royalties of Faith,</HI> which could not be produced from the <HI>Author,</HI> and in the <HI>Order,</HI> and with his <HI>Flourishes,</HI> and <HI>Expressions,</HI> that were most <HI>Peculiar</HI>; and he set before him the <HI>Cheat</HI> and the <HI>Crime,</HI> that there is in Preaching <HI>Stollen Sermons.</HI> Indeed, because the man had no <HI>Academical</HI> Education (Ex∣cept one should suppose at <HI>Samourgan,</HI> a cer∣tain

He not only Denyed, that ever he had us'd or seen any of Dr. <HI>Boltons</HI> works, (though he was also detected of <HI>Stealing</HI> Three or Four more Sermons, out of this very Book!) but he also called the Great and Dreadful God to Witness, <HI>That the Discourse he delivered, was the pure effect of his own In∣dustry and Invention</HI>; adding, That he had no other way to give Satisfaction, but by Preaching on any Text, that Minister should give him. The Minister told him, That he was astonished at his horrid <HI>Wickedness</HI> and <HI>Atheism,</HI> and that if he were to be believed in this thing, all <HI>Humane Proof</HI> of any thing must come to an End. He proceeded; That he had out-gone, all the <HI>Cheats</HI> that ever had appear'd among us, for being so hardened in <HI>Impiety</HI> and <HI>Stupidity,</HI> as to <HI>Deny</HI> a Fact, wherein he was as plainly Detected, as ever any <HI>Theef,</HI> that was taken with the <HI>Stolen Goods</HI> about him. And he concluded;
<Q><HI>Miserable Man,</HI> Do you ask me for a <HI>Text</HI> to Preach upon? I have a <HI>Text,</HI> more than one, for you, to Think upon. Go Preach, if you dare to do it, upon that Text, Psal 101.7.

<HI>He that telleth Lies, shall not tarry in my sight.</HI> Preach, if you dare to do it, upon that Text, Psal. 50.16. <HI>Unto the Wicked God saith, what hast thou to do, to declare my Statutes?</HI> Preach, if you dare to do it, upon that Text, Rev. 21 8. <HI>All Lyars shall have their Part in the Lake.</HI> And if you dare carry on your <HI>Impiety</HI> so far, Preach upon that Text, Rev. 2.23. <HI>All the Churches shall know, that I search the Reins and the Hearts.</HI> But let me faithfully and Solemnly, and as a <HI>Minister</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and as one speaking to you in the Name of <HI>God,</HI> and in the Fear of <HI>God,</HI> Admonish you to <HI>Repent</HI> of your Wick∣edness. I doubt, you will not <HI>Repent,</HI> and therefore, I tell you, <HI>I am verily perswaded, the Lord Jesus Christ, who knowes, your Secret Wickedness will bring it out. I verily Believe, That in your Detection, the Glorious Lord <HI>Iesus Christ, will make all the Churches to know, that He searches the Reins and the Hearts</HI> of the Children of men. Remember, I told you so, and that many Months will not pass, before this come to pass: It may be, I may Live to see it.</HI></Q>
He Trembled &amp; Quiver'd, when the Minister spoke these things unto him; yet he Repented not, but in a few Hours, he set the people a Railing at that Minister, in many Corners of the Town, for, <HI>Abusing a Precious, Godly, Worthy

man.</HI> Some Advised, the <HI>Arresting</HI> of that Mi∣nister, in <HI>Great Actions,</HI> for <HI>Defaming</HI> of this <HI>Excellent Person</HI>; And others had the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> so little in Exercise with them, as to cry out, <HI>That if this man had been guilty of all that was charg'd on him, yet for that Minister to speak such Things to him, was as great an offence as his.</HI></P>
<P>I had reason, to desire, That the <HI>Truth</HI> might now appear, a little more irrefraga∣bly; and therefore I went unto the Officers of the <HI>Anabaptist</HI> Church, declaring, <HI>That I apprehended my self able to convict the man whom they Employ'd as a Publick Teacher among them, of being a Cheat, and of having horribly Ly'd against his Conscience, in several repeated and Notorious Instances; and that I desired on my own behalf, and on the behalf of the other Ministers in the Town, that they would appoint a place, the next week, where I might prove my Charge to his Face, and they should be Judges of it.</HI> I could not have Imagined it; But the Church being informed of my Demand, im∣mediately Renewed (as I am told) their <HI>Call</HI> unto him, to continue his <HI>Preaching</HI> a∣mong them; and by their <HI>Minister</HI> and <HI>Ano∣ther,</HI> there was an Answer of this Importance brought unto me, <HI>That inasmuch as this man was not a Member of their Church, they did not apprehend themselves concerned, to take any notice
<PB N="43" REF="000935_0042_0FAD92C1D8ABAC80"/>
of what I had offered.</HI> Whereto my Reply was, <HI>Well, I have done my Duty, and I hope, you have considered, Whether it will be for Christ's Honour, or for your own, to Employ a man, as a Publick Preacher, against whom such a Charge is urg'd, and may be prov'd, if you will but hear it.</HI> And thought I, How much will Christians act besides themselves, when <HI>Led into Temptation</HI>! From this Time, even from <HI>September,</HI> (I think) to <HI>December,</HI> I con∣cern'd my self no further: being satisfied, that it would not be long before the Lord Jesus Christ, who saw how impiously this man <HI>mocked</HI> Him, would <HI>Search him out,</HI> and cloath with perpetual Confusion, those that would persist in Assisting such a <HI>Mocker</HI> of Heaven. One would have thought that considerate people after this warning would have been as much afraid of seeing such a <HI>Spectre</HI> in a <HI>Pulpit,</HI> as if he had been the <HI>Hol¦der forth,</HI> which they say, sometimes appears in the <HI>Coper Mines</HI> of <HI>Sueden.</HI> But many people, instead of taking the warning, went on still, under the Influences of this <HI>Ignis Fa∣tuus,</HI> to treat me (and much better men) with Numberless &amp; Furious Abuses for giving it; and with a <HI>practical Commentary</HI> upon the Distempers mentioned in the Beginning of the first Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> I praise the Lord, for His making me unwilling to

<HI>Remember</HI> them, and I pray <HI>Him</HI> to cast them out of His <HI>Remembrance.</HI> At last the malice went so far, that they began to throw in∣to my House, insolent, bitter, bloody <HI>Li∣bels,</HI> wherein, albeit the nameless Writers Confess <HI>A great Esteem for me, for my mo∣derate Spirit towards them that differ from me,</HI> yet they now in most venemous Terms of Rage, flew upon me for my <HI>Reviling an Eminent Worthy Stranger,</HI> (as they express it) and <HI>Persecuting</HI> one who had the <HI>Root of the matter in him,</HI> and one who had now the Liberty of a more <HI>Unstained Pulpit,</HI> than any of those which had been deny'd him. All these, and many more such things, wherein I <HI>heard the Defaming of many,</HI> I bore, I hope, I may say, <HI>Silently,</HI> and <HI>Patiently,</HI> &amp; it was a great Fault in me, if not <HI>Prayerfully</HI>: &amp; if I did not set my self, to consider, <HI>What Holy Lessons were to be Learnt out of such Temp∣tations:</HI> In which <HI>Lessons</HI> I should have been sufficiently <HI>Requited Good,</HI> for the <HI>Cursing</HI> of all the <HI>Shimei's</HI> in the Town. But, thought I, what <HI>Spirit</HI> possesses these Touchy Folks, that they can't let me be quiet? I do nothing to Disquiet them: Or, Does that <HI>Spirit</HI> see, that his <HI>Time</HI> is but <HI>Short,</HI> e're the Displea∣sure of Heaven, put this <HI>Boutefeu</HI> and his Disciples, to the Blush, which had been fore∣told unto them? Truly; Syr, I had no Re∣medy,

but humbly to carry my Complaints unto the Lord, who knew my Faithfulness.</P>
<P>This <HI>Evil Worker</HI> now apply'd himself un∣to the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI> with private Intimations, That for four or five years, he had been con∣vinced in his Conscience, that <HI>their way</HI> was the <HI>Right way,</HI> and that he was now in some Trouble of Conscience for his having De∣lay'd so long to Declare himself, but it should not now be long before he did. When Things were now become just Ripe, for the <HI>Devices</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> to take effect; behold, how the Wonderful Providence of Heaven defeat∣ed them! <HI>The Lord sent an Evil Spirit,</HI> be∣tween this man and the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> that had adhered unto him. Even <HI>They</HI> began to find their <HI>Eminent Worthy Stranger,</HI> Guilty of such <HI>Lying,</HI> and such <HI>Lewdness,</HI> and such Damna∣ble <HI>Coveteousness,</HI> (especially, when upon their not carrying Money to him, on a Lords-Day, wherein he Preached not, he flew out as I am told, like a <HI>Dragon,</HI> spitting this among other <HI>Fire,</HI> at them, <HI>I see, no longer <HI>Pipe,</HI> no longer Dance!</HI>) that they came to fear, he was a <HI>Cheat,</HI> and wished, they had never seen him.

sudden, he will be gone; and none of the charming offers that were made him, if he would continue, could procure his continu∣ance any longer in the Countrey. He that had often told us, his coming from <HI>England,</HI> was with a purpose to see his Uncle in <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> whom it may be, no man else ever saw, now without one look towards <HI>Virginia,</HI> Ships himself to Return for <HI>England.</HI> But, God will no longer be <HI>mocked!</HI></P>
<P>A Vertuous and Laudable Young Gentle∣man, in the Neighbourhood, Lets fall a word unto one of his Friends, <HI>That he was informed, this man had used some uncivil carriage towards a Woman that belonged unto one of the Churches in the Town.</HI> Some of the Hearers go and complain, that this Gentleman said, <HI>The man had got such a Woman with Child,</HI> whereupon some of the mans Friends began to be ob∣streperous. The Ingenuous Young Gentle∣man, was too well beloved, by all that knew his constant piety, to be suspected of speak∣ing a <HI>Falshood</HI>; and the Trouble on the minds of his Friends for him, immediately made se∣veral Discreet and Honest <HI>Women,</HI> to speak out more plainly, how able <HI>They</HI> were to Assert the Truth, of what <HI>he</HI> had really spo∣ken.

It had been Remark'd by some, That this Villian, though in <HI>Publick Prayer</HI> he were ex∣traordinarily Devout, yet he had a strange Indisposition to <HI>Private Prayer.</HI> And there was enough to render <HI>Prayer</HI> uneasy to his Guilty Soul; for while he was <HI>Feasting</HI> with the Abused Neighbours, <HI>he had Eyes full of Adultery, that could not cease from Sin.</HI> The Burning Jealousie of the Lord Jesus Christ, will now bring out the Villany of this man, and <HI>Make all the Churches to know that He searches the Reins and the Hearts.</HI> The <HI>Hypocrite</HI> had made such a show of zeal, in his performances on the <HI>Stage,</HI> that every one said, <HI>This man must be either a great Saint▪ or a great Rogue</HI>; and as to one of these, I question, whether a <HI>greater</HI> ever came into his Land.</P>
<P>Sir, I durst not blot my paper, with all the Abominable Things, that are testified up∣on <HI>Oath,</HI> against this <HI>Eminent Worthy Stranger.</HI> But the Sum of the Testimonies, deposed up∣on <HI>Oath,</HI> before the Magistrate, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 7. 1699. by several Women of unblemish'd Reputati∣on, is.

of getting them alone, and then would often affront them with Lewd, Vile, and Lascivious Carriages, which rendred it a dangerous Thing to be alone with him, and abundantly assured them, that he was a <HI>great Rogue,</HI> and that, if they had been for his Turn, he would have stuck at no Villa∣ny towards them. That he would also talk at a vile rate, and among other things, he would plead, <HI>That there was no Sin in Adultery.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Testimonies after T<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, increased on our Hands, which assured us, That on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> with his <HI>Bible</HI> in his Hands, he could sollicit Young Women to Wantonness; Yea, and Endeavour to Intoxicate them, that he might pursue his vile Purposes upon them. Yea, That when he heard of a Young Wo∣man affected with his <HI>Ministry,</HI> he would find her out, and spend several Hours to∣gether in rude actions and speeches, to her, and urging her to Ly with him, which he said, was <HI>no Sin,</HI> for <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> did as much; and adding, <HI>They need not fear being with Child by him, for none ever were so</HI>! More of this prodigious <HI>Devillism</HI> was testi∣fyed against this <HI>Eminent Worthy Stranger</HI>; and other horrid stuff begins to come to Light, and I suppose would soon be <HI>found,</HI> if <HI>sought for</HI>: but I abhor to rake any further in such a <HI>Dunghill.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="000935_0048_0FAD92C67230FBD8"/>They that fill'd the Town with other Im∣piety, by setting up this <HI>Filthy Dreamer,</HI> have now a Time to Admire the Favour of Hea∣ven, (more than their own <HI>prudence</HI>) That there was not Set up a Congregation of <HI>Ni∣colaitans,</HI> in the Town, and that the Young People, have not been debauched into fear∣ful Whoredomes, and Led away to the <HI>Un∣clean Spirit,</HI> like the <HI>Transylvanian</HI> Children, which danced after the <HI>Pied Piper,</HI> into the Cave of <HI>Hamelen.</HI></P>
<P>But I have observed, That whereas grievous <HI>Times of Temptation</HI> are ever now and then, sent upon our <HI>Churches,</HI> if the Servants of the Lord Jesus Christ can, for a while bear to be <HI>buffeted</HI> by the Foolish Rage of those <HI>Times,</HI> and apply themselves to Humble <HI>Prayer,</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> before the Great Lord, who holds the <HI>Tempter</HI> in a Chain, and if instead of answe∣ring to <HI>Reviling</HI> with <HI>Reviling,</HI> they are only quickened unto more of <HI>Holiness,</HI> and <HI>Useful∣ness,</HI> the <HI>Times</HI> do not prove <HI><HI>Dayes</HI> of Temp∣tation,</HI> but meer <HI><HI>Hours</HI> of Temptation</HI>; and <HI>Nubeculae cito transiturae,</HI> presently at an end. And so it was, in the <HI>Storm of Temptation,</HI> which by <HI>Satan,</HI> was now Raised in our Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>It has in some former years commonly happened unto me, That when I visited in the way of my <HI>Pastoral Duty,</HI> persons <HI>Pos∣sessed</HI>

I have a thousand times thought, That the Lord ordered This for some Intimation unto me, that when <HI>Times of Temptation</HI> come, wherein <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> have as much Operation on the <HI>Minds</HI> of many people, as they have upon the <HI>Eyes</HI> of <HI>Energumens,</HI> a Minister of the Lord Je∣sus Christ, that will be faithful unto His Interests, must look to be all over <HI>Disguis'd,</HI> by misrepresentations, unto the <HI>Minds</HI> of them that are under the power of <HI>Tempta∣tion.</HI> A Minister shall strictly Impose that <HI>Law of Kindness</HI> upon his <HI>Lips,</HI> to speak not one Intemperate or Injurious <HI>Word,</HI> on the greatest provocation; and yet be Re∣presented, as a man full of <HI>Bitterness.</HI> He shall be always <HI>Devising Things</HI> to Relieve the miserable, and Spend more than many others do imagine possible to be spent in <HI>Pi∣ous Uses,</HI> and scorn to take many <HI>Little Gains,</HI> that might lawfully be taken, and yet they shall cry out of him, for <HI>Uncha∣ritableness</HI> and <HI>Incivility.</HI> He shall never once in his Life, ask a <HI>Salary</HI> from his

<P>THE <HI>Vilest</HI> of Creatures, do some∣times creep into the purest of <HI>Churches.</HI> Yea, some that set up for Zealous <HI>Teachers</HI> of <HI>Godliness,</HI> are <HI>Secretly</HI> the most <HI>Ungodly</HI> Wretches in the World. Our Lord Jesus Christ, in His Holy

and Wondrous Providence, often detects these <HI>Woful Hyprocrites.</HI> But when such <HI>Hypocrites</HI> are detected, He so orders the Detection, that His <HI>Churches,</HI> not only <HI>Should,</HI> but <HI>Shall</HI> take Notice of it.</P>
<P>There was at <HI>Thyatira,</HI> One that set up for a <HI>Teacher,</HI> and was marvellously.

Our Lord Jesus Christ now declares the <HI>Use,</HI> that He will have to be made of such a matter; And His <HI>Doctrine</HI> unto us, is This.</P>
<Q>The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who Searches the Reins and the Hearts of men, will by won∣derful Dispensations of His Providence, make all the Churches to Know, that He is indeed an Heart-Searching Lord.</Q>

<P N="1"><PB N="56" REF="000935_0055_0FAD92CE953E85B8"/><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ should <HI>know,</HI> That He is very <HI>GOD,</HI> and the <HI>Son of God.</HI> Who is it that saith, <HI>All the Churches shall know, that I am He, who Searches the Reins and the Hearts!</HI> We find it here, <HI>These Things saith the Son of God.</HI> It is the prerogative of <HI>God</HI> alone, to <HI>Search the Reins and the Hearts.</HI> To say, <HI>I am He that Searches the Reins and the Hearts</HI>; tis no Language for the Mouth of a Creature. It was said, in Jer. 17.10. <HI>The Heart, who can know it? — I JEHOVAH, Search the Heart, I Try the Reins.</HI> When our Lord Jesus Christ says, <HI>I am He that Searches the Reins and the Hearts,</HI> He alludes unto that very Oracle; tis as much as if He had said, <HI>I am the Lord JEHOVAH.</HI> Thus we read in Jer. 11.20. <HI>O Lord of Hosts, who tryest the Reins and the Heart.</HI> We cannot be sensible, That our Lord Messiah <HI>Tryes the Reins and the Hearts,</HI> if we are not sensible, that He is, <HI>The Lord of Hosts.</HI> The <HI>Incommunicable Attributes</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> are ascribed unto our Lord Jesus Christ.

our Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>Lord of Glory.</HI> The <HI>Godhead</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is then to be Known and Own'd in all His Churches. Indeed, they are no <HI>True Churches,</HI> which do not own the <HI>Godhead</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ. If this <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> be not laid in the Foundation of <HI>Churches,</HI> they are not <HI>Founded upon a Rock,</HI> and the <HI>Gates of Hell,</HI> will <HI>prevail against them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scriptures</HI> of God, have called our Lord JESUS CHRIST, Expressly, <HI>The True God,</HI> and, <HI>The Great God,</HI> and, <HI>God over all</HI>: And the <HI>Churches</HI> of God, must accordingly ac∣knowledge Him. This is indeed a <HI>Great Mystery</HI>; but with every <HI>Godly</HI> man, it is a <HI>Mystery</HI> beyond all <HI>Controversy,</HI> That our Lord Jesus Christ is, [1 Tim. 3.16.] <HI>God manifest in Flesh.</HI> Yes, The <HI>New Testament</HI> speaks at this rate, will a <HI>Jew</HI> say; But give me the <HI>Old Testament</HI>; where will you find any such passage in the <HI>Old Testament.</HI> Well, <HI>To the Old Testament thou hast Appealed; Thither thou shalt Go!</HI> If the <HI>Messiah</HI> were not <HI>God,</HI> why did <HI>Job</HI> say, <HI>In my Flesh I shall see God?</HI> I can find you a <HI>Jewish Rabbi,</HI> who gathers from hence, <HI>That the Word of God, shall one Day take Flesh in a Woman.</HI> Or, if this be not plain enough, I am sure, tis plain in Psal. 45.6, 7. <HI>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever: God, thy God hath anointed thee.</HI> 'Tis plain, in

Isa. 9.6. <HI>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given, His Name shall be called, God, the Mighty.</HI> We are very certain, That the Name JEHO∣VAH, is peculiar to <HI>God</HI> alone; yet even this peculiar Name, is given to the <HI>Messiah,</HI> (who is therefore called, <HI>He which was, and is, and is to come:</HI>) You have it, in Zech. 12.10. JEHOVAH sayes, <HI>They shall Look on me, whom they have pierced</HI>; It may be there is nothing more worthy of Note in all the <HI>Jew∣ish Talmuds,</HI> than that Note on this Text, <HI>Peace be on him, who sayes, That these things are to be said of Messiah.</HI> Several of the <HI>Rabbi's</HI> own, That the <HI>Messiah</HI> is meant, when tis said, <HI>JEHOVAH shall build up Jerusalem.</HI> Thus, when we read in Jer. 33.16. <HI>This is the Name, whereby He shall be called, JEHOVAH our Righteousness</HI>: And in Jer. 33.16. <HI>He that shall call it, is, JEHOVAH our Righteousness:</HI> The Ancient <HI>Jews</HI> themselves Expound it of the <HI>Messiah</HI>: They ask, <HI>What shall the Messiah be called?</HI> They Reply, <HI>The Eternal JEHOVAH.</HI> The Objection which the Modern <HI>Jews</HI> make against this most comfortable Article of our Creed, is, That the <HI>Messiah</HI> is <HI>Man,</HI> and therefore cannot be <HI>God.</HI> But let them An∣swer one Question; Is not the Second person in <HI>God</HI> able to <HI>Unite</HI> a <HI>Man</HI> unto Himself? They dare not say, but <HI>God</HI> is able to do such a Thing. And there is a Sentence in the
<PB N="59" REF="000935_0058_0FAD92D0D90E0448"/>
Bible, which Expressly affirms, That there should be a <HI>Man</HI> in the World, who should be <HI>God,</HI> as well as <HI>Man.</HI> You have it, in Zech. 13.7. <HI>Awake, O Sword, against the Man, that is my Equal, saith JEHOVAH, the Lord of Hosts.</HI> There was a <HI>Man,</HI> whom the Jewes did Stab with a <HI>Sword</HI>; but of this <HI>Man</HI> tis said, <HI>He is an equal to the Lord of Hosts</HI>; He must therefore be <HI>God</HI> as well as <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, must preserve this <HI>Faith</HI> among them: 'tis their very <HI>Life</HI>; all their <HI>Hope,</HI> and all their <HI>Joy,</HI> is <HI>Enwrapped</HI> in it. But the <HI>Faith</HI> of our Lords <HI>Deity,</HI> cannot be preserved, without the <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>Trinity.</HI> We don't know <HI>God,</HI> if we don't know Him as <HI>One God in Three Subsistences.</HI> It is therefore maintained by some Learned Christians, <HI>That the God of the Spragogue, is not the God of</HI> Abraham, <HI>and</HI> Isaac, <HI>and</HI> Jacob. The <HI>Three Subsistences</HI> are so Exhibited unto us; in 1 Joh. 5.7. <HI>The Fa∣ther, the Word, and the Spirit</HI>; and in Psal. 33.6. <HI>The Lord, and the Word of the Lord, and the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Now, in Believing the <HI>Trinity,</HI> the <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, must particularly Believe, That their Lord is the <HI>Son of God.</HI> That <HI>person</HI> in God, which is usually called, by the Name of, <HI>The Word,</HI> is also called by the Name of, <HI>The Son.</HI> Why?
<PB N="60" REF="000935_0059_0FAD92D2AD99B0D8"/>
Because He proceeds from the <HI>Father,</HI> by an unutterable, an Inconceivable, an Eternal <HI>Ge∣neration.</HI> The Jews have a Tradition, that when the <HI>Messiah</HI> comes, He will tell us the <HI>Right Name</HI> of the Eternal God; He has done it, in Mat. 28.19. <HI>His Name</HI> is, <HI>The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Except the <HI>Churches,</HI> thus acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ, as the <HI>Son of God,</HI> they can∣not call <HI>God</HI> their <HI>Father,</HI> they cannot propose to be themselves by <HI>Adoption,</HI> the <HI>Children of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> The <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, should <HI>Know,</HI> That the Lord Jesus Christ has an <HI>Exact Knowledge</HI> of all men, and of all that is in <HI>Men</HI>▪ More particularly;</P>
<P>We are to <HI>know,</HI> That the most <HI>Hidden</HI> and <HI>Secret,</HI> Things are <HI>known</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ. 'Tis the Voice of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom without falling into the <HI>Ubi∣quitarian</HI> Error, we must call our <HI>Omnipresent</HI> Lord, in Jer. 23.24. <HI>Can any hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see him? saith the Lord Reins</HI> and <HI>Hearts</HI> are things altogether <HI>Out of sight.</HI> But the Things that are most <HI>Out of sight,</HI> are <HI>Seen</HI> by the Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>Men</HI> may see the <HI>Face</HI> of other men; but the Lord Jesus Christ sees the very <HI>Reins</HI> and <HI>Hearts</HI> of all men; there is nothing to be <HI>Hidden</HI> from him, tho' it be never so <HI>secret.</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="000935_0060_0FAD92D407D00BB8"/>
Be it <HI>Known</HI> among the <HI>Churches,</HI> That (Job 34.21, 22.) <HI>His Eyes are upon the wayes of man, and he sees all his goings; Neither is there any Deadness nor Shadow of Death, where the Workers of Iniquity may hide themselves.</HI></P>
<P>Again; We are to <HI>Know,</HI> That all our <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and the very <HI>Thoughts</HI> of all men, are fully <HI>known</HI> unto our Lord Jesus Christ. Let our <HI>Minds</HI> be constantly kept Awake, by that word of our Lord, in Ezek. 11.5. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.</HI> The <HI>Reins</HI> and the <HI>Hearts</HI> of men, are the <HI>Forge</HI> wherein their <HI>Thoughts</HI> are minted. <HI>The Thoughts are free,</HI> we say; but they are not <HI>free,</HI> either from the <HI>Law,</HI> or from the <HI>View,</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ. There are neither <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> nor <HI>Ill Thoughts</HI> in the Souls of any men, but our Lord Jesus Christ is infallibly acquainted with them; He will <HI>Requite</HI> the one, and <HI>Revenge</HI> the other. The Scribes of Old, were not the only persons, of whom it might be said, <HI>The Lord knew their Thoughts.</HI> No, Let it be <HI>known</HI> and said, by every man in all the <HI>Churches,</HI> [Psal. 139.2.] <HI>Lord, Thou knowest my Thoughts afar off.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover; We are to <HI>know,</HI> That the most <HI>Secret Conditions</HI> of men are <HI>known</HI> to our Lord Jesus Christ. The <HI>Interiour,</HI> and <HI>Spiritual</HI> State of men, the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knows</HI> what it is, 'Tis said, <HI>He Tries the Reins and
<PB N="62" REF="000935_0061_0FAD92D502DA1A40"/>
the Hearts</HI>: How? As men <HI>Try</HI> Metals, whe∣ther they be <HI>Counterfeit</HI> or no. Our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Knows</HI> all the Members in His <HI>Churches</HI>; which of them are <HI>Sons of Zion, comparable to fine Gold,</HI> and which of them are <HI>base Metals,</HI> only <HI>guilt</HI> over with Gold. Ma∣ny a man does not <HI>know himself</HI>; but there is no man whom the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knows not.</HI> If there be <HI>Sincerity</HI> in the Soul, the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knows</HI> the <HI>Sincerity.</HI> Hence an Embassador of God, that had been great∣ly <HI>Defamed,</HI> among those who did not <HI>know</HI> him, cheerfully made his Appeal to his Hea∣venly Lord, in Jer. 20.12. <HI>O Lord of Hosts, who triest the Righteous, and seest the Reins and the Heart, unto thee I have opened my cause.</HI> There is no where an <HI>Israelite indeed,</HI> of whom our Lord Jesus Christ may not say, <HI>I have seen that man</HI>! If there be <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> in the Soul, the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knows</HI> the <HI>Hypocri∣sy.</HI> Hence, when there were some, who seem'd such <HI>Strict Preachers,</HI> that every one said of them▪ <HI>They are either great Saints, or great Villians,</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ so <HI>knew</HI> them, that He could say what they were; in Mat. 23.27, 28. <HI>Hypocrites, Ye are like whi∣ted Sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful out∣wardly, but are within full of all uncleanness: Ye appear outwardly Righteous unto men, but within ye are full of Hypocrisy and Iniquity. Hypocrisy</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="000935_0062_0FAD92D5646834A8"/>
may carry a very fair Show of <HI>Sincerity.</HI> A <HI>Devil</HI> may appear as an <HI>Angel of Light</HI>: And the <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> may be so like the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>God, Pray</HI> so like them, and <HI>Speak</HI> so like them, and <HI>Look</HI> so like them, that no man may <HI>know</HI> them asunder. Yea, but they are <HI>known</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, e∣very man of them all!</P>
<P>Furthermore; We are to <HI>know,</HI> That the most <HI>Secret Intentions</HI> of men are <HI>known</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ. The <HI>Counsels</HI> of men, these may have the <HI>Reins</HI> and the <HI>Hearts,</HI> for the <HI>Seat</HI> of them. Our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knows</HI> all that is in them; that is to say, All that we Consult, and Resolve with our selves. If we have any <HI>Holy purposes</HI> to Glorify the Lord Jesus Christ, and Edify His people, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself <HI>knows</HI> all that we have purposed. When there was in the <HI>Heart</HI> of a Good man, a Design to do a Ser∣vice for the House of God, we read, in 1 King 8.18. <HI>The Lord said unto him▪ Whereas it was in thy Heart, thou didst well in that it was in thy Heart.</HI> And if there are any <HI>Wicked purposes,</HI> that men have taken up within them∣selves, what is <HI>purposed</HI> cannot be so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but the Lord Jesus Christ will <HI>know</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 'Tis no rare thing, for men to <HI>pretend</HI> one thing, and <HI>intend</HI> another; but the Lord Je∣sus Christ sees through all <HI>pretensions.</HI> We
<PB N="64" REF="000935_0063_0FAD92D61E6426C0"/>
read, in 1 Thes. 2.3, 4, 5. <HI>Our Exhortation was not of Deceit, nor of Uncleanness, we speak not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our Hearts, neither used we at any time a cloak of Coveteousness, God is witness.</HI> There were those that <HI>Preached</HI> the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and yet they drove a filthy Trade of <HI>Uncleanness</HI> and <HI>Coveteousness,</HI> in what they did: Now, saies the Apostle, the Lord Jesus Christ, who <HI>tries our Hearts,</HI> He <HI>knows,</HI> who did, and who did not so: There is no putting a <HI>Trick</HI> upon the Lord Jesus Christ; it is said of Him, <HI>He weighs the Spi∣rits of men.</HI></P>
<P>Yet once more; We are to <HI>know,</HI> That the most <HI>Secret Affections</HI> of men are <HI>known</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ. In the <HI>Reins</HI> and the <HI>Hearts</HI> of men, do their <HI>Affections</HI> operate. Our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knows,</HI> how the Souls of men do <HI>Stand Affected.</HI> Have we any <HI>Desires?</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knows</HI> them all. We may say with him, in Psal. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.9. <HI>Lord, all my Desire is before thee.</HI> Have we any <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rows</HI>? The Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knows</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all. It was said by Him, in Exod. 2.7. <HI>I have heard their cry, I know their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Do we <HI>Love</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ? Our <HI>Love</HI> is not <HI>unknown</HI> unto the Lord whom we <HI>Love.</HI> It may be said, [<HI>Joh.</HI> 21.17.] <HI>Lord, Thou knowest all things, Thou
<PB N="65" REF="000935_0064_0FAD92D6DD62CFD8"/>
knowest that I love thee.</HI> If <HI>Carnal Affections</HI> [even those of the very <HI>Reins</HI>] are flaming and raging within us, they are <HI>known</HI> to Him that is, <HI>The God of the Spirits of all Flesh.</HI> And if our <HI>Affections are set upon the Things that are above,</HI> where our Lord Jesus Christ is, they are <HI>known</HI> unto the Lord, that we have cho∣sen for the Object of them.</P>
<P>Yea, Finally; The <HI>Knowledge</HI> which our Lord Jesus Christ hath of all these Things is a very <HI>Exact</HI> and <HI>Perfect Knowledge.</HI> 'Tis said, <HI>He Searches the Reins and the Hearts.</HI> The <HI>Exactness</HI> of the <HI>Knowledge,</HI> is implied in the Expression of <HI>Searching.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches</HI> to the <HI>Bottom</HI> of all things. [See Heb. 4.12, 13.] We are therefore in∣formed concerning our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>He hath Eyes like a Flame of Fire.</HI> He needs no other <HI>Light,</HI> but His own <HI>Eyes,</HI> to discover the most <HI>Se∣cret</HI> Things in the World. There is nothing so <HI>Secret,</HI> but the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, will penetrate like swift Lightning, into the Bowels of it. When the Wretches of old, heaped their Ludibrious and Abusive Treats upon our Lord Jesus Christ, one Abuse with which they treated Him was, <HI>They Blindfolded Him,</HI> as they imagined. Poor Fools! To imagine, that they could extinguish or intercept the <HI>Sight</HI> of Him that <HI>made the Eye</HI>! A little <HI>A∣tom,</HI> as well might put out the <HI>Sun!</HI> Be it
<PB N="66" REF="000935_0065_0FAD92D7B67786F8"/>
<HI>known</HI> unto you, O ye <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord; There is nothing <HI>unknown</HI> unto your Glori∣ous Lord.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> When the <HI>Wonderful Providence</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, by Discovering <HI>Secret Sin∣ners</HI> in His <HI>Churches,</HI> makes it Evident, that He <HI>Searches the Reins and the Hearts of men,</HI> it becomes the <HI>Churches,</HI> to take much Notice of that <HI>Wonderful Providence.</HI> When are the <HI>Churches</HI> to <HI>know,</HI> That the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches the Reins and the Hearts of men?</HI> They are <HI>Then</HI> especially to <HI>Know</HI> it, when the Lord Jesus Christ, by strange Discoveries of <HI>Cheats</HI> in His <HI>Churches</HI>▪ gives a Demonstrati∣on thereof. But then, the <HI>Knowledge</HI> that the <HI>Churches</HI> are to have implies, that they take due <HI>Notice,</HI> a <HI>Serious,</HI> Notice, and an <HI>Awful</HI> Notice of it.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Great Day of Judgment</HI> indeed, the Lord Jesus Christ will most Eminently make all the <HI>Churches</HI> to <HI>Know,</HI> that He <HI>Searches the Reins and the Hearts of men.</HI> There will a Day come (the Day of our True <HI>Davids Kingdom,</HI> the Day wherein the <HI>Creation</HI> shall be delivered from the <HI>Vanity</HI> now upon it.) When, as we are told, in Eccl. 12.14. <HI>God will bring every Work into Judgment, with eve∣ry Secret Thing, whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</HI> Not only will all the <HI>Churches</HI> that
<PB N="67" REF="000935_0066_0FAD92D8B41D6A58"/>
ever were found among mankind, then find that the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches the Reins and Hearts of men,</HI> but <HI>all mankind</HI> will be with all possible Solemnity convinced of it. In that Illustrious Day of God, when <HI>God shall Judge the Secrets of men by Jesus Christ,</HI> and when <HI>God will bring to Light the Hidden Works of Darkness,</HI>
<Q>Cunctaque Cunctorum Cunctis arcana patebunt;</Q></P>
<P>Heaven and Earth shall then <HI>know,</HI> and it shall be terribly proclaimed from the <HI>Rising of the Sun to the Setting thereof,</HI> and as far as the Trumpet of an Archangel can sound the Proclamation, <HI>That every thing is known unto our Great Lord Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>But before that <HI>Last,</HI> and <HI>Great,</HI> and <HI>Notable Day of the Lord,</HI> there do oftentimes fall out, most amazing Things, to show the <HI>Churches,</HI> That the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches the Reins and Hearts</HI> of the Children of men. The Word of the Lord Jesus Christ, hath particu∣larly Cautioned us, against being too <HI>Quick</HI> and <HI>Rash</HI> in receiving men as <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, for fear, lest it quickly appear that those pretended <HI>Ministers,</HI> are secretly Rotten, Profane, Unclean Creatures; and then we <HI>partake</HI> in the Guilt of the <HI>Miscarri∣ages</HI> that are found chargeable upon these
<PB N="68" REF="000935_0067_0FAD92D911B4D640"/>
Intruded <HI>Ministers:</HI> Now, saies the Apostle, 1 Tim. 5.22, 24. <HI>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other mens Sins; some mens sins are open before hand, going before to Judgment, and some, they follow after:</HI> The <HI>Sins</HI> of some <HI>Candidates</HI> for the <HI>Ministry,</HI> are not open before <HI>Trial</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> is past upon them, and they are Judg'd fit for <HI>Ordi∣nation,</HI> but however it won't be long before their <HI>Sins</HI> do break out, unto the Astonish∣ment of all the <HI>Churches,</HI> that were too <HI>sudden</HI> in setting of them up.</P>
<P>Consider of it, O ye <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P>First; The <HI>Wonderful Providence</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, in discovering, of <HI>Secret Sinners,</HI> does plainly discover, that He <HI>Search∣es</HI> the most <HI>Secret Sins,</HI> in the <HI>Reins</HI> and <HI>Hearts</HI> of men. By various and curious and exqui∣site <HI>Methods,</HI> does the <HI>Wonderful Providence</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, bring about the Disco¦very of <HI>Secret Sinners.</HI> And those <HI>Methods</HI> of <HI>Providence</HI> do confirm This; That our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knows</HI> the Sinners, and all their <HI>Secret Sins.</HI> Men must with some Agony of Soul, now cry out, [Psal. 90.8.] <HI>Lord, Thou hast set our Iniquities before thee, and our Secret Sin, in the Light of thy Countenance.</HI> Men may <HI>Cover their Sins</HI> a long while; but they don't <HI>prosper</HI> in their doing so: God makes a <HI>Dis∣covery</HI> of them. Sometimes the Holy God
<PB N="69" REF="000935_0068_0FAD92DBCFCE3BF0"/>
smites them with such Horror of <HI>Conscience,</HI> that as 'tis said, in Psal. 64.8. <HI>They shall make their own Tongue to fall upon themselves.</HI> An <HI>Achan</HI> is brought into such Distress and Hor∣ror of <HI>Conscience,</HI> that he shall not be able to forbear Confessing, <HI>Thus and thus have I Sin∣ned, and thus hath my Sin found me out.</HI> And sometimes the Holy God leaves them to such horrible <HI>Scandals,</HI> that all the Neighbourhood shall with Abhorrence gaze upon them. There was an <HI>Impostor,</HI> that had <HI>bewitched</HI> the people; he seem'd very pious, until God left him unto that Impiety, which made every one to say, as in Acts 8.21, 23. <HI>Thy Heart is not Right in the sight of God, I perceive thou art in the Gall of Bitter∣ness and the Bond of Iniquity.</HI> A <HI>Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing</HI> will go on, perhaps many months together, until God permits the Clawes and the Teeth of a <HI>Wolf</HI> to be dis∣cern'd upon him in some <HI>Scandalous Acti∣ons.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knew</HI> the <HI>Se∣cret Villanies</HI> of these men, from the Be∣ginning; but now he makes <HI>all men</HI> to <HI>know</HI> them; and when <HI>that which was done in Darkness is heard in the Light,</HI> when <HI>that which was done in Closets, is proclaimed on the House tops, Then</HI> 'tis proved, That the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>knew</HI> all along, what was done in <HI>Darkness,</HI> and <HI>in the Closets.</HI> The
<PB N="70" REF="000935_0069_0FAD92DD26BD6B60"/>
Lord Jesus Christ says upon such occasi∣ons, as He said concerning those infamous <HI>False Prophets</HI> of Old, in Jer. 29.23. <HI>They have committed Villany in Israel, and have committed Adultery with their Neighbours Wives and have spoken Lying Words; even I know, and am a Witness, saith the Lord</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; 'Tis most Remarkably in <HI>E∣vangelical Churches,</HI> that the Lord Jesus Christ, who <HI>Searches the Reins and the Hearts of men,</HI> does by His <HI>Wonderful Providence</HI> discover the <HI>Secret Sins</HI> of men. In <HI>Congregations</HI> formed according to the Will of the Lord Jesus Christ i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is that <HI>Secret Sinners</HI> run the <HI>great∣est hazards</HI> of that Vengeance, in Prov. 26.26. <HI>His</HI> Sin <HI>is covered with Deceit, his Wicked∣ness shall be shew'd before the whole Congregation▪ Churches</HI> of a pure Constitution, represent the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI> unto the world: Men can't Sin at so cheap a rate in the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they may in a dark <HI>World,</HI> or in <HI>Churches</HI> that are undistinguish'd from the <HI>World.</HI> The <HI>Pure Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, are <HI>Golden Candlesticks</HI>: Can men think to Sin undiscovered in the midst of such <HI>Candlesticks</HI>? There are <HI>Angels</HI> burning in the Heads of them▪ There is a special and a dreeadful <HI>presence</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, in <HI>Churches,</HI> that maintain the <HI>Order of the Gospel.</HI> Hence there are stupendous Dispensations of
<PB N="71" REF="000935_0070_0FAD92DE6B240D58"/>
His <HI>Providence</HI> in His <HI>Churches,</HI> to bring out those that shall there provoke his Infinite Majesty. Men may go on in a <HI>Course of Profanity,</HI> under a <HI>Cloak of Piety,</HI> for some while among the <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; and they may applaud their own Contrivance, as long as▪ they can Enjoy the Applause of the Deluded Neighbours. The Jealous Lord Jesus Christ beholds their Hea∣ven daring Abominations, but with a Day of patience, He gives them a <HI>Space to Repent</HI> of the Abominable Things, by which they thus dare the Justice of Heaven. It may be said of them, <HI>They consider not in their Hearts, that I remember all their Wickedness, tho' their do∣ings are before my face, saith the Lord.</HI> At last, the Jealousy of the Holy Lord breaks forth like Fire against them, and abandons them to some <HI>Follies</HI> that fully discover them. The Lord Jesus Christ, in His Burning Holiness, gives them up to an <HI>Unclean Spirit,</HI> a <HI>Lying Spirit,</HI> a <HI>Thieving Spirit,</HI> or some other <HI>Evil Spirit,</HI> and the Infatuated Wretches are expo∣sed with Consternation and Execration to all the World; As it was said, in Psal. 52.6, 7, 8. <HI>Thy Tongue deviseth mischiefs: O thou deceit∣ful Tongue, God shall take thee away, and root thee out; the Righteous also shall see and fear, and laugh at him; Lo, this is the man, that strengthened himself in his wickedness; but I am
<PB N="72" REF="000935_0071_0FAD92DF13C65CD8"/>
a Green Olive Tree in the House of God.</HI> Thus, 'tis an Exclamation made in all the <HI>Churches; Lo, this is the man, that would needs appear some body among the Churches of the Lord Jesus Christ; but the Lord Jesus Christ hath made all the Churches to know, that they were Deceiv∣ed in him.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. When the <HI>Wonderful Providence</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ in His <HI>Churches,</HI> by Discovering the <HI>Secret Sins</HI> of men, showes that He <HI>Searches the Reins and Hearts</HI> of Men, it is the Duty of the <HI>Churches</HI> to take much <HI>Notice</HI> of it. The <HI>Providence</HI> of the Lord Je∣sus Christ, sometimes does very Tremendous and Surprising Things, in His <HI>Churches,</HI> for the Discovering of <HI>Secret Sinners.</HI> The <HI>Advo∣cates of Sin,</HI> will do all they can, to Resist that <HI>Providence</HI> of Heaven, and make nothing of <HI>That,</HI> which is plainly, <HI>The Finger of God.</HI> By such Doings, men bring upon themselves the Guilt of all the <HI>Sin,</HI> they go to Smother and Shelter, and the <HI>Providence</HI> of Heaven remains irresistible. Such <HI>Partners</HI> with <HI>Sinners,</HI> will do well to Tremble before that Word of God, in Psal. 28 5. <HI>Because they regard not the works of the Lord nor the operation of His Hands, He shall Destroy them.</HI> In the mean time the <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, are to <HI>Take Notice</HI> of what He does in His <HI>Notable Providence.</HI> When our Lord Jesus Christ
<PB N="73" REF="000935_0072_0FAD92DFE924E9C8"/>
gives us to see, That He <HI>takes Notice</HI> of His <HI>Churches,</HI> and of what is done among them, it becomes His <HI>Churches</HI> to <HI>take Notice</HI> of His <HI>Providence.</HI> Why, There are <HI>Lessons</HI> of Great Consequence, which the <HI>Churches</HI> are to Learn from that <HI>Providence,</HI> wherein they see Him <HI>Searching the Reins &amp; Hearts</HI> of men. Tis a most <HI>Observable</HI> Thing, that is done by our Lord Jesus Christ in His <HI>Providence,</HI> when <HI>Secret Sinners</HI> are discovered. Now all the <HI>Churches</HI> are to <HI>Observe</HI> what is done: For, [Psal. 107.43.] <HI>Whoso is Wise, will observe these things.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> The <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, when they see Him <HI>Searching the Reins and the Hearts</HI> of men, in the Memorable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of His <HI>Providence,</HI> they should make a <HI>Good Use</HI> of what they see. All the <HI>Churches</HI> are to <HI>Know,</HI> That the Lord <HI>Searches the Reins and the Hearts</HI>; But how are they to <HI>Know</HI> it? Words of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> in the Sacred Language, import Suitable <HI>Resentment.</HI> Now,</P>
<P>First. All the <HI>Churches</HI> are to <HI>Know,</HI> That the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches the Reins and the Hearts,</HI> for the <HI>Comfort</HI> of such <HI>Hearts,</HI> as are <HI>Sound before Him.</HI> Christians, Are your <HI>Hearts</HI> Vexed with any <HI>Temptations,</HI> or grieved for any <HI>Corruptions</HI>? I may say unto you, <HI>Let not your Hearts be Troubled</HI>: But <HI>Know</HI> for your
<PB N="74" REF="000935_0073_0FAD92E1561486E0"/>
<HI>Comfort,</HI> under your <HI>Uneasiness,</HI> That the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Knows</HI> all that renders your <HI>Hearts</HI> uneasy, and is ready to Succour you. Can you say with him, in Psal. 57.7. <HI>My Heart is Fixed, O God, my Heart is Fixed?</HI> It is <HI>Known</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, who indeed was He that <HI>Fixed</HI> it. Yea, If there be but the least Spark of <HI>Grace</HI> in thy <HI>Heart,</HI> O man, Tis all <HI>Known</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ. There is not one <HI>Good Motion,</HI> but it is the Lord Jesus Christ that <HI>Moved</HI> it, and He <HI>knows</HI> what it is. Have any of us been <HI>Ac∣cused</HI> and <HI>Reproached</HI> by an Angry Generation of men, and are <HI>Ill Constructions</HI> made of our <HI>Faithfulness?</HI> What a comfortable <HI>Cordial</HI> may this be to our <HI>Hearts,</HI> That our Lord Je∣sus Christ <HI>Knowes</HI> how <HI>Faithful</HI> our <HI>Hearts</HI> have been unto Him? As he said in Job 16.19. <HI>Behold, my witness is in Heaven, and my Record is on high</HI>; though my <HI>Friends do Scorn me</HI>: The Servants of the <HI>Churches</HI> cannot Escape the Severe censures of men, if they do what the Lord Jesus Christ would have them to do: But since <HI>all the Churches Know,</HI> That the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches the Hearts,</HI> how Joyfully may we apply unto Him, <HI>Lord, Thou knowest my Heart, I have said nothing, I have Writ nothing, I have done just nothing, but what my Heart assured me, it was my Duty to do</HI>!</P>
<P>Secondly. All the <HI>Churches</HI> are to <HI>Know,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="000935_0074_0FAD92E2C35A5660"/>
That the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches the Reins and the Hearts,</HI> for our <HI>Caution</HI> against <HI>Regard∣ing Iniquity in our Hearts.</HI> What a <HI>Caution</HI> have we, Sirs, What a powerful <HI>Caution</HI> against all Attempts, to <HI>Mock</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ, with <HI>Hearts</HI> that are <HI>Deceitful above all things,</HI> while they are <HI>Desperately Wicked?</HI> Let us in our <HI>Churches</HI> labour to approve our <HI>Hearts</HI> unto our Lord Jesus Christ, and let us not go to <HI>Mock</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ, with any meer <HI>Shows</HI> in Religion. What said the Man of God, in Job 13.9. <HI>Is it Good, that He should Search you out? Or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock Him?</HI> Let it be <HI>Known,</HI> Oh, let it be <HI>Known</HI> to all the <HI>Churchers,</HI> That the Great God, who will not be <HI>Mock'd,</HI> will thoroughly <HI>Discern,</HI> and will terribly <HI>Confound,</HI> all those that go to <HI>Mock</HI> Him.</P>
<P>There are some such <HI>Cautions</HI> as these to be set before us.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Since our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches our Hearts,</HI> Let us make sure, that our <HI>Hearts</HI> have the <HI>Religion,</HI> that we seem to have in our <HI>Lives.</HI> Let no man among us, be that man, in Jam. 1.26. <HI>A man that seemeth to be Religious, but Deceiveth his own Heart.</HI> Make no Empty <HI>Profession</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI>; Let us <HI>Inter∣nally,</HI> and <HI>Practically</HI> be, what we <HI>Profess.</HI> Do we give our <HI>Names</HI> to our Lord Jesus Christ in His <HI>Churches</HI>? Let us give our
<PB N="76" REF="000935_0075_0FAD92E344419980"/>
<HI>Hearts</HI> unto Him, as well as our <HI>Names.</HI> We <HI>Profess</HI> that we <HI>Believe</HI>; But we must▪ <HI>Believe with all the Heart.</HI> We <HI>Profess</HI> that we <HI>Re∣pent</HI>: But we must <HI>Repent with the whole Heart.</HI> Make sure of <HI>New Hearts,</HI> and of <HI>True Hearts,</HI> and of Souls Renewed with a real <HI>Principle</HI> of Religion Especially, when you joyn your selves unto the <HI>Churches</HI> of the <HI>Heart-Searching Lord,</HI> be careful, O my Hearers, be careful to <HI>Search your own Hearts,</HI> and by an impartial <HI>Self Examination,</HI> assure your selves, of your being by an <HI>Heart-work</HI> of real Conversion prepared for it.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Since our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches our Hearts,</HI> Let us Bring <HI>our Hearts</HI> unto Him, in all the Exercises of <HI>Religion,</HI> &amp; offer the <HI>Inwards,</HI> as well as the <HI>Outwards.</HI> Let us not be like those, of whom tis said, in Isa. 29.13. <HI>This People draw near me with their Mouth, and with their Lips do honour me, but have removed their Heart far from me.</HI> Remember we, that the <HI>God</HI> whom we worship, is a <HI>Spirit</HI>; and <HI>He will be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth</HI>; if we do not worship Him <HI>in Spirit,</HI> we do it not <HI>in Truth.</HI> It is not Enough, that we serve the Lord Jesus Christ, with <HI>External Appearances:</HI> The <HI>Righ∣teous Judgment</HI> of God, is not according to such <HI>Appearances.</HI> What said the Psalmist, <HI>Bless the Lord, O my Soul</HI>? In <HI>Praying,</HI> Let us
<PB N="77" REF="000935_0076_0FAD92E3AC6710C0"/>
be able to say, <HI>Lord, I Lift up my Soul unto thee.</HI> In <HI>Hearing,</HI> be able to say, <HI>Lord, I hide thy Word in my Heart.</HI> Oh, do not go to put off the <HI>Living</HI> God, with a <HI>Dead</HI> Carcase of Devotions.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> Since our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches our Hearts,</HI> Let not our <HI>Hearts,</HI> in declaring for the Interests of <HI>Religion,</HI> have any Indirect Glances at inferiour Interests. For persons to put on a <HI>Cloak</HI> of <HI>Zeal</HI> for the Lord Jesus Christ, but aim only at Advancing of them∣selves, and their own Corrupt Humours, it will provoke Him that <HI>Searches the Hearts,</HI> to say unto them, as in Act. 5.4. <HI>Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine Heart? Thou hast not Lyed unto men, but unto God.</HI> When we attend the <HI>Means</HI> of Grace, the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches our Hearts,</HI> whether it be meerly for <HI>Credit,</HI> or <HI>Custome</HI>; or, whether it be to <HI>Draw Water out of the Wells of Salva∣tion.</HI> When we seek after <HI>Church-fellowship,</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches our Hearts,</HI> whe∣ther it be to Gain a <HI>Good Esteem</HI> among men; or, whether it be to <HI>build up our selves in our most holy Faith</HI>▪ When we give our <HI>Alms,</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches our Hearts,</HI> whether it be to avoid <HI>Contempt</HI> on Earth; or, Whether it be to <HI>Lay up a Treasure in Hea∣ven.</HI> When we are forward in prosecuting
<PB N="78" REF="000935_0077_0FAD92E4729518C0"/>
<HI>Offendors,</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches our Hearts,</HI> whether we have a single Respect unto the <HI>Honour</HI> of God; or, whether we Respect a piece of <HI>Revenge</HI> upon our Ad∣versary. Oh, Let nothing be done in the <HI>Churches,</HI> on <HI>By Ends,</HI> or for <HI>Self-Ends</HI>; be∣cause the <HI>Churches</HI> are to <HI>know,</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches our Hearts,</HI> for the <HI>Ends</HI> which they are acted withal.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> Since our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Searches our Hearts,</HI> and makes the <HI>Churches to know,</HI> that He doth so, Let none in our <HI>Churches,</HI> under <HI>seeming Sanctity</HI> indulge any <HI>Secret Villany.</HI> The <HI>Pharisees</HI> of old, were a very demure, and precise kind of men; yea, there were notable <HI>Preachers</HI> among them: and yet! [see Joh. 8.9.] Their Consciences flew in their faces, that they were secretly, Lewd, Wanton, Filthy <HI>Satyrs</HI>▪ and the <HI>Abhorred of the Lord.</HI> For persons to carry a Face of more than ordinary strictness and fervour in <HI>Religion,</HI> and yet for these persons to be ve∣ry <HI>Devils in secret,</HI> what is this to be indeed, but even <HI>Devils Incarnate?</HI> All Temptations with which the Devil urges you to Sin, from the notion of <HI>Secrecy,</HI> repel with this Answer, <HI>'Tis impossible there ever should be a Secret Sin.</HI> As one solicited unto Lewdness, with this Ar∣gument, <HI>The Doors are shut,</HI> replyed, <HI>No, but
<PB N="79" REF="000935_0078_0FAD92E515F88300"/>
you have not shut the Lord Jesus Christ out of Doors</HI>! We read, <HI>God is terrible out of His Holy Places.</HI> Why, <HI>Churches</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, are <HI>Holy Places: Church-Members</HI> are in <HI>Holy Places</HI> If you that are in these <HI>Ho∣ly Places,</HI> will <HI>secretly</HI> allow your selves in <HI>Unholy practices,</HI> be it <HI>known</HI> unto you, O ye <HI>Mockers</HI> of the Lord that <HI>knows</HI> what you do, 'tis a <HI>Terrible Thing,</HI> that He will do up∣on you. Especially, Let the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel▪ beware, that they <HI>Seek not the over∣sight of a Flock of God for filthy Lucre</HI>; and beware that while <HI>they Prophesy in the Name of the Lord, they be not the Workers of Iniquity</HI>: Lest the Judgments of the Lord Jesus Christ, should Thunder strike them, as He did those Young Ministers, upon whose Tragical Death He said, <HI>I will be Sanctified by them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be Glo∣rified.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, Let us all make that Petition, unto the Lord, who <HI>Searches the Reins and the Hearts,</HI> in Psal. 139.23, 24. <HI>Search me, O God, and know my Heart; try me, and know my Thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and Lead me in the way Everlasting.</HI></P>
