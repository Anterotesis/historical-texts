<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are here presented with a <HI>Re∣viv'd Poem,</HI> with such Additions and Enlargements as makes it very diffe∣rent from the First Impression. It is suited to the present State of the <HI>Protestant Church,</HI> shewing the <HI>Causes</HI> of her pre∣sent <HI>Calamity,</HI> with an Enumeration of some pre∣vailing sins; the <HI>Plots</HI> and <HI>Contrivances</HI> of <HI>ROME</HI> against <HI>SION;</HI> the Marks of the <HI>Antiebrishi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Beast</HI> and <HI>Scarlet Whore,</HI> with her <HI>Arraigument</HI> and <HI>Condemnation,</HI> (illustrated in difficult places with Marginal Notes.) Also some probable Discove∣ries of the Churches Redemption, and the ap∣proaching Glory of the Latter Day.</P>
<P>We have now a plain Prospect (by the Gracious Discoveries of Providence) of those Horrid and Execrable Plots, which the restless Adversary has contriv'd against the Peace and very Being of <HI>SION,</HI> and which were much in the dark when my Muse first bewail'd its Condition, and suspected, that this <HI>Epidemical Mischief</HI> (now Reveal'd) was then a hatching.</P>
<P><PB REF="000344_0003_0FA4AB5D57E96620"/>
In a Subject of Grief, a quaint and ornamental Method is not to be expected: for an abrupt and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bbing Delivery is more natural in the Delineati∣ons of Sorrow, then a studied well poiz'd and arti∣ficial Harrangue. The Subject is Divine and too lofty for so weak a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Generous Reader to a candid and mild Constru∣ction. I have writ according to the measure of Light received, and have contributed my Mite (in a well-meaning Spirit) to reduce us to our selves.</P>
<P>Against the <HI>Reigning Evils</HI> which expose us to Temporal and Spiritual Enemies, many <HI>wholsome Precepts</HI> from <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> are given.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rise, Progress,</HI> and <HI>Persecutions</HI> of the <HI>Man of sin,</HI> are succinctly delivered, with the Evidence of Approved <HI>Historians,</HI> (some of them <HI>Papists</HI>) whose <HI>Evidence</HI> against <HI>Themselves</HI> ought to be con∣vincing. There cann't be too many <HI>Defendants</HI> against so Vigorous and <HI>Assailant</HI> as <HI>Rome</HI> is.</P>
<P>There are many Excellent Tracts that discover the <HI>Villanies</HI> of Popery, and I wish they were more common. It is a great comfort that the Spirit of the <HI>Nation</HI> is so much (and justly) incensed against it. And that our Parliament is so Thorow and Resolved to crush that <HI>Interest,</HI> whose Principles teach them to be (to all <HI>Hereticks,</HI> for so they call <HI>Protestants</HI>) Traiterous <HI>Subjects,</HI> ill <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and worse <HI>Sover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igns.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="000344_0004_0FA4AB5F2B9AB458"/>
To promote the <HI>Just Odium</HI> of my <HI>Native Coun∣trey</HI> against so <HI>destruction</HI> and <HI>malignant</HI> an <HI>Enemy,</HI> is (in part) the Design of this <HI>Essay;</HI> (which being of small bulk and price, may possibly come into more hands them larger Volumns.) If it con∣tributes any thing in order to that End, it answers the Expectation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
