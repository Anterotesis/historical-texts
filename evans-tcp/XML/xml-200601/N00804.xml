<HEAD>The Epistle Dedicatory, To the Churches of Christ in <HI>N. England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT can incur no just Censure that we address our selves to the Churches of Christ here in the following Sheets, inasmuch as they are but a Reply to a Book lately dedicated unto them. Nor does our zeal, (we hope) for Truth, the Honour of God, &amp; the Safety, Peace &amp; Flour∣ishing of these Churches come short of what our Reverend Author may be inspired with in his performance We make the same glorious Pretence with him to maintain &amp; defend the Order of the Gospel, altho' we cannot allow what is suggested in the Title page. That every Principle so strenu∣ously contended for in that Treatise, is either professed or practised by the Churches of Christ in <HI>New-England.</HI> One part, at least, therefore of his Book the Reverend Author ought to have published in his own Name, and not have obtruded it on the Churches here, whose Practise never gave grounds to suspect them leavened with so gross thoughts, as particularly his Doctrine of the Ordination of Ministers is.</P>
<P>We will not guess at the Authors secret aim, or whom in particular he raises his Batteries against We'd cha∣ritably hope he has no private Interest to bribe him in this Affair; and we hope for a like favourable and candid Con∣struction of this Reply. Indeed the Name prefix't to that faulty Treatise, may be presumed, with a multitude of prejudiced People, to weigh down all the Reasons and
<PB REF="000967_0004_0FAE3981ACD72428"/>
Arguments which can possibly be brought for their Con∣viction. And we have no such advantage to boast of; yet are happy in this, that we are not over-awed by any Name, and the Truth we know is greater, and more venerable than all things.</P>
<P>Its well known how liberal some men are of the odious brand of <HI>Apostates,</HI> for every one who cannot digest the late published Orders: but, without arrogance, we assume, as more due, the Title of <HI>Proficients,</HI> and doubt not to make it out, that our dissent from many of them is so far from a going back from any Gospel T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth or O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der, that it is rather a making progress, and advancing in the Evan∣gelical Discipline.</P>
<P>It is a groundless Calumny which is suggested, <HI>That a latitude beyond what our Author contends for, is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a betraying the liberties and priviledges which our Lord Jesus Christ has given to his Church, or the Brethren of the Church.</HI> These we profess to prize and stand for, and would by no means lose. But wherein do they consist? not in the Brethrens challenging any part of the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nisterial Work! Not in imposing upon others any thing which Christ has not imposed! which is but a debarring Christians of the Pri∣viledges they have a right to. But they consist (as we conceive) in such things as these. That our Consciences be not imposed on by Men or their Traditions, Christ being the alone Lord of the Conscience, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.23. That Believers are through Christ, freed from the guilt and do∣minion of Sin, from the curse of the Law, and from the sting and terror of Death. That we have the liberties of Gods House and Ordinances, &amp; therein communion with God. That we may have the benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the gifts of his Ministers for edification, and such like, according to the Apostles Doctrine, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.22.</P>
<P><PB REF="000967_0005_0FAE39826EE28488"/>Nor is that Objection less frivolous, when if we appear less Rigid than others of the Reverend Authors severity, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reflected on as casting dishonour on our Parents, &amp; their pious design in the first settlement of this Land No, we reverence our Ancestors, and the Memory of their di∣vine Zeal and Constancy, and would derive it as a Truth sacred to our Posteri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, that it was a religious Interest which carried them through all the amazing Difficult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es &amp; Discouragements in that Undertaking But yet, the par∣ticular design or end has been some-what differently con∣veyed unto us.</P>
<P>Some have carried it as if the great end were the Con∣version of the <HI>Heathen</HI>; and there have been great Com∣plaints by s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of late, how this has been neglected and contradicted, and another course taken up, whereby in∣stead of bringing the <HI>Heathen</HI> into the Church of God, many whose Fathers and themselves were once of the visible Church, are now strangely left out, scarce any face of Religion remaining among them.</P>
<P>As for this, we bewail it, and look upon it as a Reproach to the Land, and would therefore countenance no such Principles or Practices as have any tendency to such Apostacy.</P>
<P>Again, some have made this the great Design, to be freed from the Impositions of Men in the Worship of God, wherewith they were sometimes burthened; and as they fought freedom for themselves, we cannot suppose they design'd to impose upon others In this we are risen up to make good their grounds.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> in his Sermon of the <HI>sinful∣ness of Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shipping God with Mens Institutions,</HI> p. 27. gives this as the errand of our fore-Fathers into this Wil∣derness,
<PB REF="000967_0006_0FAE39832205FDD0"/>
namely, to sequester themselves into a quiet corner of the World, where they might enjoy Christs un∣mixt Institutions, and leave them uncorrupted to Posterity; and the gain-saying or counter working this, is, as he in∣timates, to cast dishonour upon them, or call them fools.</P>
<P>This Charge falls heavy on those who are for imposing their will on others We crave no more but to enjoy the Institutions of Christ unmix't And it appears very st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ange that those who fled from an Act of Uniformity, should presently impose on themselves, on their Neighbours, and entail the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>schief on their Posterity.</P>
<P>Some indeed would make the design of our first Plan∣ters to consist in some little Rites, Modes or Circumstances of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurch Discipline, and those such as the Word of God no where requires These are the men who dishonour their Country, and their Fathers Memory, by making their great design to lie in so small matters. And it is notorious there has been no agreement in these points from the be∣ginning. Its known there was <HI>Anti-Synoda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia</HI> printed, and who had a hand in it, <HI>and how modest his Dissent was,</HI> and in what terms they contradicted what the Synod had established, tho' the like is criminal and insufferable in any other.</P>
<P>These Principles in Church Discipline are also wrote against in English by the <HI>Assembly of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vines,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dry,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rutherford,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, &amp;c.</HI> In a word, if it be the Truth, according to Gods Word, we stand for, it would not be grievous to any of our pious Ancestors, were they now on Earth; neither will it be grievous to them now in Heaven: nor should it be grievous to any good Man to receive Conviction. We refer all therefore to the Word of God, <HI>to the Law and to the Testimony.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="000967_0007_0FAE3983E68557E8"/>In the <HI>Preface</HI> or Epistle to said Book, we find several things that might be justly excepted against, but designing neither to be contentious nor volumnious, we shall speak but to one or two.</P>
<P>In <HI>pag.</HI> 8. the Reverend Author is pleased to number up seven or eight erronious Doctrines, as he apprehends them to be; &amp; the consequence from all is this, that if we espouse these Principles, we give away the whole <HI>Congregational Cause</HI> at once. Whence we perceive now the professed cause which the Author engages in; tho' we hope it is not the Name or the Party, but the Truths they defend. We shall have occasion to examine these Principles hereafter; it may suffice here to say, they are <HI>craftily</HI> &amp; <HI>unfairly worded,</HI> &amp; in the Dress they are here clad, we do not espouse them; yet according to their most fair &amp; genuine construction there is a great deal of Truth in most of them. And this is but a block the Author politickly casts in the way, which at last we fear may but discourage some from em∣bracing the Congregational way, seeing it must need<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fight for its life against some Truths. <HI>Its hard kicking against the pricks, Acts</HI> 9.5.</P>
<P>Another thing Remarkable in the <HI>Preface</HI> is the Authors heat and warmth, pag. 9. <HI>Shall we then by Silence betray the Truth?</HI> shall we retort, therefore we are bold to speak too. <HI>Who is on the Lords side? Who?</HI> shall we answer, we are▪ we trust (through Gods Grace) together with you; and all other siding we would have in contempt. <HI>Is there no one that will stand up for the Churches of Christ?</HI> God for∣bid but we should, had others declined it! <HI>The good People in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m then ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well think their Watch-men are all either dead or a sleep:</HI> or if they talk light and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eady, they may conclude them in a trance, or not quite awaked. <HI>For
<PB REF="000967_0008_0FAE39849F88EBF8"/>
which cause it is that I dedicate this ensuing Dissertation.</HI> And for the same cause we address you in the following answer. <HI>It is not my cause, but yours.</HI> Nor is it ours, but the Churches▪ and every good Christians in common. <HI>Did I say yours? nay, it is Christ cause.</HI> We list under the same Banners, and would to God we were all as really, as we would seem to be divested wholly of carnal self— for truly our present De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence is become the peculiar concern of these Churches.</P>
<P>But why all this heat? we would not interpret too hard: but these Expressions seem plainly to carry this sense, <HI>That every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> published Orders, is an opposer of Truth, not on the Lords side, Enemies to the cause of Christ, and the Churches of</HI> New-E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and. Where∣upon the Reverend Author ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es himself, and sounds an Alarm to the Churches, <HI>To put d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn all such</HI> If this be not involv'd in it, we would beg his Pardon, and be in∣formed better. But truly, <HI>Sir,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is a mistaken Zeal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dly lavish'd away, and not kindled from above; for we know no such conspiracy against the Truth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our Lord Jesus Christ, or against the good of the Churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> altho' we are not proselyted to some of your particular Opinions. It appears to us, that the Reverend Authors infirmity in this matter, is the same with the Apostle <HI>Johns,</HI> Mark 9 38. <HI>Master, we saw one casting out Devils in thy Name, and he followeth not us; and we forbad him, because he followed not us.</HI> Which too forward zeal our Lord cheeks, and reconciles the matter, <HI>Vers.</HI> 39, 40. <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esus answered for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d him not; he that is not against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is on our part.</HI> But in this case, as in many others we could instance in, if need were, the Reverend Author, tho' very zealous for a time, yet is not very steady &amp; constan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;
<PB REF="000967_0009_0FAE398754E161F8"/>
for before he ends his book, he comes about again, in pag, 139. where he proposeth his Brothers Essay for Union wherein he shows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow inconsiderable the Differences are between those of the <HI>Presbyt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rian</HI> and <HI>Congregational judg∣ment,</HI> that they need no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to purcha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Peace. And yet by the cry just now, you wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d have though all the Truths of Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peled under foot, the Cause of Religion deserted▪ and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble War, commenced by the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> against the order of the Gospel.</P>
<P>It is observable, that the Reverend Author in the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sser∣tation of the following Questions, makes use of abundanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Quotations from several famous Persons in their Gene∣rations; but in some the sence is perverted to a wrong end, beside the obvious intention of the Writers; in some he brings them in contradicting at one time what they said at another, and sets some in opposition to others. And where he endeavours to confirm his Tenets by the Testimony of some, he might, if he had pleased, have brought many others to contradict the same thing. But this is a good-way to amuse the Reader, and to cloud his mind, and to terrifie him, by mustering a legion of inar∣tifical Arguments. We shall be sparing in Quotations, and pass by many cited by the Author, tho' we approve them not. Only we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e leave to present one Quotation, which may be of use to us all along, being we are unwil∣ling to be imposed on to believe what God never spoke, or to do what God never requir'd. It is that of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> in his fore-quoted Sermon, <HI>pag.</HI> 23.24.
<Q>Hence it follows, that there is nothing to be received by us on this account, but what has G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds Seal affixed to it. Its therefore enough to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t us down resolved against any such thing, if we can say there is a silence about it in the
<PB REF="000967_0010_0FAE39889D7FD1A0"/>
Scripture, that God has no where commanded it in his Word, either expresly, or by just and necessary conse∣q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence, its no Order of his devising. Scripture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut any Tradition gives a full condemnation, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t ever Pleas men may bring for it, as, <HI>That it is profitable, many have been edified by it, it is a prudent way to secure the Interest of Religion; many wise, holy learned Men have pleaded for it and practised it; that there is much of decency in it, and the thing it self is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wayes harmful.</HI> All this is fully answere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that one word, <HI>God has spoke no∣thing about it,</HI> Heb. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.4. <HI>It never entered into his heart to enjoyn it,</HI> Jer. 7.31.</Q>
Thus he.</P>
<P>This being publickly practised and printed so long a go by so eminent a Minister, and never since contradicted, we take it for granted, that none have any thing to say against it. And we are thankful to him for furnishing us with a Doctrine so fully laid down, to bear off the Institutions, Traditions and Impositions that men would lay upon us.</P>
<P>But it is high time now to consider th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Questions which the Reverend Author propounds, and the Answer he gives to each of them. In which attempt we shall offer no other Apology for our brevity, save that our Author him∣self might have been as brief, and yet full as clear and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>victive.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 1. <HI>Whether particular Churches ought to consist of Saints and true Believers in Christ?</HI></P>
<P>It is granted that the matter of a particular Church (for the Question is not stated with reference to the Catholick) is visible Saints. And tho' the Answer is not given in the words, yet we would charitably hope his sense is the same, with the united Mini∣sters in <HI>London.</HI>
<Q>That none shall be admitted as members in or∣der to Communion, in all the special Ordinances of the Gospel, but such as are knowing and found in the fundamental Doctrines <HI>of the Christian Religion,</HI> without scandal in their Lives, and to a judgment regulated by the word of God, are Persons of visible Godliness and honesty, credibly professing cordial subjection to <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></Q>
Had our Reverend Author only said t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s much (and indeed more is needless) he had saved us the labour of any Reflections on this part of his Essay. But there is one passage
<HI>in p. 15 which we cannot but except against.</HI><Q> A Scripture, <HI>sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> which has respect to the times of the Gospel, severely rebukes those Ministers, which shall bring men that are uncircumcised in heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unregenerate persons) into the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctuary, into the Church of God, to eat the Bread and drink the Blood, which they that are there, partake o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Ezek 44.7, 9.</HI></Q>
A hard saying, and who can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear it.

<P>But what will the Reader think if we should make an Apology after all for the Reverend Author, and assure him he means no more, than that Ministers ought not to admit known Infidels or Prophane; for, for his part, he pretends not to know mens hearts. We only can intreat the Reader not to <HI>rebuke</HI> the Author too severely for his inconsistency, for he may mean well, and all parties are agreed. Unless he should imagine himself at∣tacqued by the Reverend Author of the Doctrine of instituted Churches.</P>
<P>Q. 2. <HI>Whether there ought not to be a Tryal of Persons concerning their qualifications and fitness for Church communion, before they are admitted thereunto?</HI></P>
<P>We shall not here examine the force of the Authors arguments, whether they unresistably conclude, or not; and whether the consequence is good from the tryal of the Apostles, the Porters at the Temple, or the 12 Angels at the Gates of the Mystical <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to the tryal of Church Members. It suffices that the Reverend Au∣thor has modestly stated this Truth, and cited us to a merciful Bar, the judgment seat of a rational Charity, where the Judge avoids severity, and the tryal is managed with abundant tenderness: the

This is indeed the part of the good shepherd, and we could now gladly commit our selves to the Reverend Au∣thors Pastoral care. So many good words remove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of a rigid Tryal. But alas! the Clouds return upon us, and a black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, as follows.</P>
<P>Q 3 <HI>Whether a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not the Brethren, and not the Elders of the Church only, to judge concerning the qualifications and fitness of those who are admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted into their Communion?</HI></P>
<P>The Reverend Author allows there may be a difference of appre∣hension, as to this point, and yet no breach of Union. We think so too, and therefore as we continue to honour the Person, though we expos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his opinion; so we ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the negative will not deserve the popular cry, <HI>Oh Apostacy! Apostacy!</HI> The difference, as the Reverend Author tells us, is betwee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Brethren of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Congregational way,</HI> the former givi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g this power only to the Eldership, the latter joyning the fraternity with them. He takes up for the latter; but whether he proves it, the world may see when we have considered his Arguments.</P>
<P>In the fore-going Chapter, when he would prove there ought to be a tryal of Persons, he tells us of the <HI>Porters that were set at the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gates of the Temple,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 23.19. but those Porters were Officers 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 6.1. so he Instances in the Twelve Angels at the Gates of the Mystic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which tho' it may imply that the Gates were kept, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not that the fraternity were the keepers. He instances also in <HI>Phillip</HI> and <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> which if it argues any thing, is applicable only to the Officers, and not to the Brother-hood.</P>
<P>But to examine his strength in this Chapter what he calls argu∣ment, may more truly be stiled dogmatical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffirming, or a more mean begging the Question. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill pag. 24, 25. he quote a Scrip∣ture or two in proof of his assertions, <HI>scil.</HI> 1 <HI>Corinth.</HI> 5.12. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6. in both which places the Apostle is writing to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Church a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Corinth,</HI> about excommunicating the Incestuous Person fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his sin, and the restoring him again upon his Repentance. And we remit the Reverend Author to the same holy Apostle for an answer. It is that known place, 1 <HI>Corinth.</HI> 12. <HI>chap.</HI> where he compares the
<PB N="4" REF="000967_0014_0FAE398C2695BF20"/>
Church to a mans Body, and shows the distinct offices and opera∣tions of the respective Members, as the Eye and Ear, the Hand and Foot. And to render the allusion the more intelligible, he names the Officers God had set over his Church, as more immediately re∣ferred to <HI>v.</HI> 28. God has set some in his Church, first, <HI>Apostles,</HI> secondarily, <HI>Prophets,</HI> thirdly, <HI>Teachers</HI>— and in the close of the 14. chap. he adds, <HI>Let all things be done decently and in order.</HI> The result of all is this.</P>
<P>The Apostle would have every one to keep his proper place and sphere, and do his own work, <HI>scil.</HI> in the Censure of the faulty Person, the Eldership were to do theirs, the Brotherhood not to usurp or arrogate any thing above their Province. For as the Apostle queries, <HI>v.</HI> 19. <HI>are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? i. e.</HI> in a govern'd Body we cannot expect all should be Governors, <HI>vid. Pool'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Annot.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Text also produced to prove the power of the Brethren, <HI>scil. Mat.</HI> 18.17. and if he shall neglect to hear them, <HI>tell is to the Church.</HI> This Text has been often brought on this account, and sometimes on other accounts and as often answered, yet here brought again, but it will not answer the end.</P>
<P>The Context supposes an Offender, and the wronged party pro∣ceeding against him; and here are three steps the dissatisfied Person is directed to take, in order to heal the wound given, 1.) To tell the Offender his fault in private. 2) To tell him before 2 or 3 wit∣nesses, and if the end be not obtained; 3.) To tell it to the Church. Suppose now a Person acting according to this Rule (as we could give instances if need were) when the first step did not gain his Brother, nor the second answer the end, at last the dis∣satisfied Person carried the case to the <HI>Pastor,</HI> and now he reckoned he had told it to the Church. The Pastor sending fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Offendor presently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onvinced him, brought him to Repentance, and to give satisfaction, and the thing was issued. Here the Rule was attended, the Church told, the offendor healed, the wronged Person satisfied, and the matter issued, when the Brotherhood all this while knew nothing of it. It is evident from the next verse, that by the Church must be meant those who had Power to bind and loose, which Power Christ had given to the Apostles. Moreover let the sense be that the Offence is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old to the Rulers first, and then by them to the
<PB N="5" REF="000967_0015_0FAE398CF2B86FA0"/>

Pools Annot.</HI></P>
<P>But if Scripture will not prove the Power of the Brethren, possibly some venerable Maxim may do the feat. <HI>Quod tangit omnes deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t ab omnibus approbari.</HI> But alas! this Maxim gives so much to the Sisters, as to the Brethren. Surely it is no divine Oracle, it neither came from Heaven, nor is it according to the man∣ners of men upon Earth. If a master of a family take in a sojou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nor or a servant; all are concerned, but their vote is not asked. If a Cap∣tain list a Souldier, all the Company is concerned, but it is done by his Authority, without asking their leave. And pray carry this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to the Colledge, and see if the President and Fellows will stand by it in their admissions. If it be objected, that even in all these cases if there be any sufficient reasons presented by those con∣cerned, a prudent Ruler will yield to it; we easily grant it, and therefore its not unfit that men be proposed to the Congregation, if there be any thing to object against their lives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Another argument for the Brethrens Power in admission, is, lest the whole Power should sometimes reside in the hands of a single Minister, and that this is unreasonable we have a Speech quoted from the <HI>Presbiterian Ministers</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> But it is strangely perverted from their true meanning, as appears not only from the whole series and scope of the Book, but also from what is expressed in the page quo∣ted (<HI>p.</HI> 71.) where they say,
<Q>That the Power cannot be placed in the whole Church collectively taken.</Q>
The Scripture makes an exact distinction between Rulers and ruled. They only plead that there should be more Rulers in a Church then one; or that, when there are more, then the Power belongs to the whole meaning, the ruli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g Elders as well as the Teaching. And what is that to the Power of the Brethren? One officer has Power in plain cases to act in the Kings name.</P>
<P>Indeed our Saviour did frequently send forth his Disciples two and two. But yet <HI>Phillip</HI> was sent alone to baptize the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nuch. It will not excuse a Minister in the neglect of Christs work, because he has no fellow labourers with him.</P>

<P>The Reverend Author answers in the Negative, and adds, that the Churches of <HI>N.

<P>But about he wheels again, and seems to plead hard for it, or something like it, which he calls the Practice of the Churches of <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>This he would recommend from a story receiv'd from the Re∣verend Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> but we have heard another story from the same Reverend Person, how when one of the Brethren was highly com∣mending his neighbours Relation, and preferring i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to others, the said Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> turned upon him, and said, <HI>An Brother! don't be so much taken with fine words, but look to the mans conversation.</HI> The Author relates another story from the Reverend Mr. <HI>How,</HI> of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e who through importunity was brought to make a relation, and made the Congregation weep, when he did it; but whether for joy or grief, we are left in the dark.</P>
<P>The Author gives us his arguments, but they do not reach his end.

<P>Again, the Relation of Experiences is pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for, in that God may be Honoured by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.

<P>But the Question is, Whether they are an instituted means for any of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ends? Whether appointed by God, to promote his glory, edifie the Congregation, or gain love? If not, they are but the Institutions of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and therefore to be rej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted, as the before quo∣ted Mr. <HI>Willa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> instructs us.</P>
<P>God has appointed the preaching the Gospel, the Sacraments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cation, and the promoting Christian love among his people; but we read nothing of these impos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d relations, neither when Christ himself, nor when his Apostles after him, adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nistred this holy Sacrament. Nor is there any appearance of such a Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tom in the primitive Church.</P>
<P>Indeed, there are some occasions, as our Author observes, on which a Person who has had a rema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kable Conversion, may declare it: but there's neither p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecept nor rule in the Word of God, that it should be done at this set time, and in publick.

The last Scripture we shall name, which has been equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly abused with the rest, is that in 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3·15. <HI>That Christians should be ready to give a reason of the hope that is in them, to every one that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>keth it,</HI> to wit, in a proper place and time, for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and on sufficient Reasons, where there is Authority to command, or it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red with modesty. The sense indeed is, that we sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d be ready to defend our Faith against the scoffs and cavil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Infid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l and Perse∣cutors: and that it is a shame to Christians not to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to argue for their Religion, and confu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e gain-sayers. So that if you would infer hence any publick Speech in the Church, it m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st be rather a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Apology</HI> for the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istian Religion, or a Sermon to prove its reason∣ableness and evidence; but neither is it in the least intimated that <HI>this</HI> should be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de a stated term of Communion; and we are sure the Church has no more power to debar the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om any Christian priviledge then to require Oaths, Subscriptions, and Conformity to a Thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and more Ceremonies.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000967_0019_0FAE39C9100BAA80"/>We have but one Remark more to make here, and that is, the Apostle requires this reason of our hope to be given with meekness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P>But it seems the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Corruption of this laudable practice which the Author do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>well to censure; and that is, when some, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no good intentio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir own, get others to devise a Relation for them. The Author may be satisfied there is something of truth in such reports; neither Charity nor Interest should make us too incre∣dulous. But then he passes a severe sentence on such Lyars to the holy Ghost.

<P>In the <HI>Preface</HI> we have the Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hors own description of this Co∣venant, where he calls it <HI>expl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Covenanting with God and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church,</HI> and sometimes with <HI>God and his People.</HI> But we renew our Com∣plaint, that we are yet most miserably in the dark.

If but one, whether it binds the person that en∣ters into it, to perform the same Duties to God, and to the Church? and in case a person be dismissed, whether it is from his whole duty or from a part of it? and whether God and his Church Promise the same thing to the party covenanting? These Queries are offer'd only to provoke a clear state of the thing debated, which should be clear∣ed to the understandings of people, before its imposed on their Con∣sciences, as a term of Communi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P>But before our Author ends this Chapter, he puts another disguise,
<PB N="11" REF="000967_0021_0FAE39CA6099A848"/>
and a more taking face on this matter. He would insinuate that the Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch Covenant, as practised in <HI>New-England,</HI> is nothing more than the publick Profession of Faith, and promise of a holy Lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for which he quotes both Synods and several p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivate Reverend mens Names.

Its by this Coven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt that a Person or People are united to Christ the head, and do become Members of his body. By this the Catholick Church is constituted, and we have an interest in all those Priviledges th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t belong to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elievers, as such. This is the Covenant we own, and which we renew every time we attend the publick Wor∣ship of <HI>God, Psal.</HI> 50.5. and this Covenant ought to be explicit, op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly professed an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> published to the World. It is a false and abusive in n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion (but frequently made in an awful Desk) that People are against all explicit Covenanting, or the open renewal of it; for there is no pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tence for such a Calumn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that we can hear of: It must there∣fore arise either from idle Fears, or some mischievous Policy.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> We also highly a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prove of a Covenant of Reformation. A great Duty in times of Apostacy, and gross corruption of Manners; to cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nant to put away th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se and those reigning sins, to return to the Lord, and perform such particular Duties as have been visibly neglected. Of this we have frequent instances in Scripture, <HI>Ezra</HI> 10.3 5.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly</HI> We may also allow a Covenant between Minister &amp; People, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eby they bind themselves to those respective Duties, that the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of God has made incumbent on them, on account of that Re∣lation.</P>
<P>But we altogether deny a Church Covenant in the following sense,
<PB N="12" REF="000967_0022_0FAE39CE1BC920F0"/>
and say, Our Lord Jesus Christ has no where appointed in his Word, that there should be a Covenant enter'd into by some Persons of a Christian Society, exclusive of the rest, whereby they being in Cove∣nant one with another, should thereby call themselves a Church of Christ, making the Ordinances of Christ, or any of them to depend on this Covenant, so that those who scruple it, or refuse to joyn i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, shall on that account, not enjoy them. And that those who are thus covenanted, or the major part of them, have power to make or un∣make Officers, to admit or reject Church Members, to mannage Dis∣cipline, to order the affairs of Christs House in his Name, as if they had warrant and commission from him so to do. Of such a Church Covenant neither <HI>Moses,</HI> nor Christ himself, the Prophets nor the Apostles have spoke any thing. None of the Scriptures, Arguments or Quotations of our Reverend Author prove any thing of it. We will take leave therefore to call it Mans Covenant, and not Gods, for it has not Gods Seal affixed to it; &amp; though good, wise or learned men may endeavour to obtrude it, and pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad, its harmless, edifying, or for the Interest of Religion, yet according to the afore-quoted Rule of the reverend Mr. <HI>Willard,</HI> we are to reject it, and shall do so, till it comes with a divine Stamp.</P>
<P>But possibly this may be called a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>srepresentation.</HI> You will say, Who owns it, or will plead for it in this Dress? <HI>We Answer,</HI> by querying, Whether there be not several that own and plead for the things contained in it? We wish there were a less Number. But to evince it, let us take it into the several parts. Are there none that plead for a seperate Covenant, which some (and generally the lesser part) must enter into? and if it be good, and for good ends, why must so many be excluded? If it be to reform Manners, if to maintain the Ministry and Worship of God, if to lay stricter Bonds of Duty, if to bring men more effectually to submit to Discipline, why then are not the whole brought in? for the whole Congregation are oblig'd to these Duties, and why must the Covenant be seperate?</P>
<P>Again, do not some plead, it is requisit, in order to a Persons par∣taking of the Lords Supper? But did our Lord Jesus Christ require any such thing when he first instituted that holy Sacrament? Did the Apostles when they administred it? Was it the term of Communion in the primitive Church? or where is the Scripture that comma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s
<PB N="13" REF="000967_0023_0FAE39CF192F9DD8"/>
it? and why should Gods holy Ordinances be annexed to Mans Cove∣nant? Again, do not some plead, that those who thus covenant, have the Power to make and unmake Officers? The Reverend Au∣thor will not scape here, whose Opinion in this matter we shall see herea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter. And, <HI>finally,</HI> do not some pretend, That these are the Persons commissioned by Christ, for the admitting and rejecting of Church Members? This the Reverend Author defends with all his Might, under the third Question, tho', as we showed, he could find no Proof. And so much for the Church Covenant, which is a stranger to the Scripture, and has no foundation in the Word of God.</P>
<P>Q. 6. <HI>Is publick Reading of the Scriptures, without explication or ex∣hortation there-with, part of the Work incumbent on a Minister of the Gospel?</HI></P>
<P>The Author does not mean, (as we suppose,) if there be no ex∣plication or exhortation throughout the whole time of exercise. If he doth, he fights with the air, for we know no Sect of Men but have some explication, tho' many among us neglect reading. We therefore take his sense to be this, If no explication follow immedi∣ately without the interposition of Prayer, or any other part of divine Worship. For we conceive that the ordinary preaching the Word may very properly be call'd <HI>exposition, explication</HI> &amp; <HI>exhortation,</HI> and that in every Sermon there is a competent portion of Scripture for one time explicated and applyed. Nor can we imagine, the Re∣verend Author means that every clause a Minister reads in publick should be in a formal manner explicated: Methinks it should satisfie, if after one or more Chapters read, some select clause, verse o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> para∣graph be insisted on and expounded, <HI>i. e.</HI> chosen as a Text, and preached on.</P>
<P>We are obliged to the Author, if but for quoting the Text in <HI>Ti∣mothy,</HI> where it is given him in charge, as his Ministerial Work▪ <HI>To give attendance to Reading, as well as to Doctrine &amp; Exhortation. That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Jews <HI>were wont to read the Scriptures in their Synagogue,</HI> saith the Reverend Author, <HI>we all know; and that it was their Duty to read the Scripture at some set and solemn Times, we also know; for so it was ap∣pointed,</HI> Deut. 31.11. Again, he grants that in <HI>Justin Martyrs</HI> time <HI>the Scriptures were read, and thereupon followed a Sermon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000967_0024_0FAE39CFAED188E0"/>We should have been th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nkful if he had added more Proofs, by way of Encouragement (as he could easily have done) and thereby confirmed some that are apt to stagger. He could have told how the Assembly of Divines at <HI>Westminster,</HI> do order and advise to it: He could have quoted the many famous Churches that do practise it at this day: He could have named several famous Ministers in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and some i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>New-England,</HI> that plead for it, and practise it. He could have told of more than the bishop of <HI>De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> that complain of the neglect of it, and that to use the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of a most emine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Divine not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>as the most just Reproach that the Churches of</HI> New-England <HI>labour under.</HI> He could have told, for encouragement, that it is a clause in our publick Confession of Faith in <HI>New-England, chap.</HI> 22. which treats of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath day, <HI>Sect.</HI> 5. <HI>The reading the Scriptures, Preaching and hearing the Word of God, singing of Psalms, as also the Administration of Baptism and the Lords Supper, are all parts of the Religious Worship of God, to be perform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in Obedience to God with Ʋnderstanding, Faith, Reverence and godly fear. Finally,</HI> He could have told us (had he searched all our <HI>New-England</HI> Antiquities on this head) now in the Preface to our Version of the <HI>Psalms,</HI> the reading of <HI>David</HI>'s <HI>Psalms as other Scriptures</HI>) in Churches, is taught to be one end of them, as well as si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging of them, which is another end.

some places have no Communicants, and there all grant this Right and Priviledge belongs to the whole: if afterwards they come to have some Communicants, by what Rule or Reason do they take away that Priviledge which belonged to others before? In short, let our Author find one Text that limits or confines it to the Communicants alone, and then deprive the Majority.</P>
<P>But since Scripture fails him, he has another Refuge, <HI>viz.</HI> the Au∣thority of the Synod, and the Law of the Land. The last of these we think excepts <HI>Boston,</HI> and of both we need only say, that as they were done by men, so they may be altered and undone by the same men, when they please.</P>
<P>It is also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inted, <HI>That this may prove fatal to the Churches.</HI> But there is no danger, Truth does no harm; and we rather think it may be retorted on the Author and his Practice. There was lately a grievous Complaint made by a principal Man of <HI>Swanzy,</HI> before some Ministers and others, That the Law which gives the Power to the Communi∣cants only to call a Minister, is like to ruin them and their Posterity forever, by excluding them from an able and orthodox Ministry, and the Ordinances; for the <HI>Baptists</HI> taking advantage thereby, have set up a gifted Brother, and spoil the place of the publick Ministry.</P>
<P>Qu. 10. <HI>Is it expedient that Churches should enter into a Consociation or Agreement that matters of more than ordinary Importance, such as the gathering a new Church, the Ordination, Deposition, or Translation of a Pastor, be done with common consent?</HI></P>
<P>The Reverend Author answers, <HI>That it is both expedient and neces∣sary</HI>; though he had answered as well, had he said, <HI>It is altog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther needless.</HI> but lest we be mis-understood in this matter, let the Reader carefully observe, We do not mean that the Communion, or Fellow∣ship, or Prayers, or Assistance, or Duties that the Church or People of God owe to one another, are needless. But for particular Churches, that are parts, and result from the Catholick, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lted to the Head, and in Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enant with him, and bound to per∣form all Duties both to the Head &amp; to all the Members respectively; for such to talk of ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing into an agreement on this account, seems very idle and needless. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ustrate the matter; If a Servant has
<PB N="21" REF="000967_0031_0FAE39D5D5A35268"/>
bound himself to a Master, he need not go to make new Covenants to carry it dutifully to the Mistress, lovingly to the Children, faith∣fully to the fellow Servants, this being all contained in the Masters Covenant. So, if a Person marry a Husband, she has no need to make a new Covenant with his Father, that he shall be her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather, or that his Brothers, Sisters or other Relations shall become hers, this being all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mplyed in the Marriage Covenant: The respective Duties must be perform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, but there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s no need of new agreements or cove∣nants to be ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red into Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> as quoted by the Reverend Auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, express<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s this well. <HI>They are bound in Consci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce to give an account of the wayes to Churches about them, or to any other who shall req<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; and this not in an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bitrary way, but as a Duty they owe to God and Man.</HI> The united Brethre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <HI>London</HI> speak yet more fully in the Chapter of <HI>Communion of Churches,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1. <HI>We agree that parti∣cular Churches ought not to walk so dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct and seperate from each other, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot to have care and tenderness to one ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er.

<P>It is to be obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rved, that by this means the Brethren in a Synod will surpass th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, and by a Cabal may easily out vote them Wherefore we can never believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat our Lord Jesus Christ has lest every private Brother an equal Vote with any of his Officers, in ruling o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnaging his Church.

We confess such a Man would be tempted to stand up for the Brethrens Autho∣rity, which is his own support, and the mean while the Church is like to be well govern'd.</P>
<P>But what is a further Outrage to the sacred Office, the Author will not let Ministers fit as Officers of Christ, or as Persons aut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orized by him; for thus he expresses himself, pag. 86. <HI>Its not their Office, but the Churches Delegation, that giveth Power to the Members of Synods, the specificating Act in which Synod all Power, and so the right of a decisive Vote is founded, is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Churches Delegation.</HI> And to prove thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he instance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the first Synod that ever sate, as he ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that <HI>Acts</HI> 15. a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opy and Samplar left to all succeeding Generations. But how Comical is this? as if that was so constituted, or its Members delegated by particular Churches Or, how long had this inspired Synod sat before that case was brought before them? or were they summoned upon this single occasion? Truly the Author begs the whole, and proves nothing of it.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Reverend Author tells us in the same page, <HI>That of these Delegates from the Churches, the Elders ought to be the principal, or principally concerned.</HI> A mighty grace ineed! yet even this cannot be allowed, and he consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tent with himself; for in the next page he tells us, <HI>There are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome Brethren in the Churches, whose Gifts and Abilities are beyond their Pastors, and some again are more Noble and Honourable.</HI> Now if they are alike delegated, and those can act no more in the Name of Christ than the other, pray why should they be the principal? Why may not a Brother of equal Authority assume and arrogate the first place to himself, which if he chance to do, we leave the Author to be catechized by him, and to do Pennance pati∣ently by his own Principles.</P>

<P>The presence of Christ must be supposed, when ever a person is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to his Ministry; but seeing our Lord Commissions none im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>diately, such must be present as have Power to authorize, Com∣mission and give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he charge in his Name. When ever a Call is given, received and accepted, whether it be by Words, Message or letter, both Minister and People are conceived, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present face to face. But the Circumstances of Times, Places, Persons, Distance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> must determine this matter; which as they may fall on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, may sometimes render it both prudent, regular and necessar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, (&amp; then its the Voice of Providence) for a Minister to be ordained in one Land, and to serve in another.</P>
<P>Q. 14. <HI>Is the Practice of the Churches of</HI> New-England <HI>in granting Letters of Dismission or Recommendation from one Church to another, ac∣cording to Scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, and the Example of other Churches?</HI></P>
<P>The Reverend Author refers to many Scriptures to prove the Af∣firmative, but not one of them reac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es the Question, or prove a dismission for this end, <HI>scil</HI> to take a pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son off from being a Mem∣ber of one Church, to be made a Member of another. The Epistles or Letters he refers to, are all Apostatical or Ministerial, not the Let∣ters of one Church to another, some only excepted, which is men∣tioned as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Brethren; but <HI>Apollo,</HI> on whose behalf they wrote, was not a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber of their Church; nor do they write to those in <HI>Achaia</HI> to receive him as a Member, but rath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r as a Minister, or as a Christian of eminence and singular goodness.</P>
<P>Indeed the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e may be a good use of Letters of Recommendation, and especially among stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs. And where a Member removes from one Church to another, a mutual satisfaction may be laboured after.
<PB N="29" REF="000967_0039_0FAE39E022DFCF88"/>
But we cannot but think such Letters frivilous, when in the same Town, and at two streets distance, a Person known over all the Town for an exemplary Conversation, prefers ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers Ministry. Civility will const<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain such persons to acquaint their Ministers of their pur∣poses, and the same Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istian Civility obliges such a Minister to ac∣q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint the other Pastor (if need be) to whose Ministry they repair, that they have carried themselves well in his Communion, and that he hopes they may prove blessings in all other.</P>
<P>But as for the Brethren, We need not go to them, to make a second Speech, now to ask leave to with-draw, and to render an ac∣count to every impertinent Talker who thinks the man Married to him, and that his bed is broke into, or that there's no just reason for a divorce.</P>
<P>Moreover, some people are forever dissatisfied; neither con∣veniencies of Habitation, liking the others Ministry, profiting under it, or dislike of some Customs and Practices which he would willingly be rid of the light of, can satisfy. And what must the grieved person do further in this case? Why, truly he has done his duty, and may hear and communicate, where God and his own sober Conscience directs him. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ought any Minister of Christ, to reject his claim to the Lords T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble with him.</P>
<P>To say no more, our Reverend Author having in a former Treatise proved that persons baptized are thereby subjects of Discipline, We think they all ought to be accountable to the Society where they are; there persons b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing dismissed by the Provid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of God, whether they have letters of dismission or not. Else by their principles, an ordained Minister in <HI>London,</HI> formerly of Communion with a Church in <HI>Boston,</HI> being called to Office in a particular Church, and having accepted the Pastoral Care thereof, must first send over a Pacquet to <HI>New-England</HI> for a Letter of dismission. And don't you think he would be well imployed?</P>
<P>Qu. 15. <HI>Is not the asserting that a Pastor may administer the Sacra∣ment to another Church besides his own particular Church, at the desire of that other Church, a declension from the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st principles of</HI> New-England, <HI>and of the Congregational way?</HI></P>

Mr. <HI>Jer. Burroughs,</HI> which we thank him for, having never heard it before.

<P>We would offer here one Query more.

<P>But to detain the Reader no longer, 'tis enough and enough that the Reverend Author justifies it as lawful; for then doubtless it may be sometimes proper: for that would be a strange thing indeed, that is always lawful, and never (in no Circumstances▪ not in that of Mr. <HI>Burroughs</HI> himself) can be proper.

<P>Qu. 17. <HI>May the Churches under the</HI> Presbyterian <HI>and</HI> Congrega∣tional Discipline <HI>ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tain Communion with one another, notwithstanding their different Sentiments, as to Church Government?</HI></P>
<P>The Author answers, <HI>That they may and ought to do so.</HI> And truly, had this Book contained only this one Question and Answer, it might have turned to more Edification than the whole. He tells us, There was greater Differences than these in the <HI>Apostolick Churches.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thinks then we of latter Days may the better bear with one another, the effusions of the Spirit of Peace and Truth being since much restrained</P>
<P>The Reverend Author observes further, <HI>That both Perswasions have been Confessors and fellow Sufferers, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thinks this should endear them.</HI> We think so too, but to our sorrow, some of us have heard how it hath been in <HI>England,</HI> &amp; now, alas! we see it verified in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uthor, that when their own Persecution ceases, they carry on the Tragedy on others. We do not wonder at what the Author saith Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> told him, <HI>That if all</HI> Independants <HI>were like</HI> N. England Independants, <HI>he would soon be one.</HI> For we can easily guess what deceived that ex∣cellent Person (whose Moderation suited his Piety &amp; Devotion) into so endearing an Expression. He form'd his Idea of <HI>New-England Independency</HI> by the Authors plausible carriage when in <HI>London,</HI> which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh for that time might be very sincere, yet either the difference of the Climate, or that his Dominion here is more rightful, quite alters him. We are assured, the Author is esteemed more a <HI>Presby∣terian</HI> than a <HI>Congregational Man,</HI> by scores of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Friends in <HI>London.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ is lov'd and reverenced for a moderate Spirit, a peaceable Dis∣position,

and a Temper so widely different from his late Brothers in <HI>London</HI> He was most conversant at the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Board, and oftenest in their Pulpits, and professed the greatest Reverence for their Persons. And no wonder Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> should be so enamoured of such <HI>Independents!</HI> Did our Reverend Author appear the same here, we should be his easie Proselites too. But we are loath to say how he forfeits that venerable Character, which might have conse∣crated his Name to Posterity, more than his Learning, or other honorary Titles can. To confirm what we have here said, the Author declares how Instrumental he was to promote the Union betwixt the United Brethren in <HI>London.</HI> We only wish he would be as cordial and active to keep it, as he was to make it; or else the World will think his Zeal for it was, because far enough from home, where In∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est was not touched.</P>
<P>As for the thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Articles of Ʋnion,</HI> which the Author transcribes, we would endeavour to maintain them, and all the rest. But there are s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Cases and Times, when Ministers of some particular Opi∣nio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s will not bear to be consulted wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. Or if there is a necessity of di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying their Opinions for once, it is best not to consult them, mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly to do their Counsels the more Despight. We think this modest and ingenuous Nor can it be reas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nably ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected that a <HI>Congregational Classi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (if such there be) should be consu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted in those th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich are properly <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esbyterian,</HI> their Prejudice, in favour of their own Opinions, rendering them unfit to advise with in that matter; and the more serious the appl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cation to such is, the more severely would they think themselves bantered.</P>
<P>As to his Query, <HI>Whether the embodying into a Church state be not a mighty matter?</HI> We must needs profess, we want some better account what that is, before we can so esteem it. We read nothing in Scripture of gathering a Church, or embodying it into a Church state, unless it refers to the converting and baptizing of <HI>Heathen,</HI> and then admi∣nistring the Ordinances of the Gospel in a stated way to competent Numbers, whose convenience will permit th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to meet constantly at one and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same place of Worship. All further Solemnity in this matter is <HI>ex abundanti,</HI> and therefore the matter seems not so very weighty.</P>

<P>And here we must do justice also to those who have first openly as∣serted and practised those Truths among us.

That the Pro∣ponant for the Lords Table be ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mined of his Baptismal Vow, his sense of spiritual Wants, Sinfulness and Wretchedness, his Hope, Faith, Experiences, Resolutions through the Grace of God But then come two words, <HI>Covenant</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> in Capital Letters, as a Lyon R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpant, insulting a couching Classi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, a bleeding Presbytery. But if we look over the Answer to the last Question in <HI>The young Mans claim to the Sacrament</HI> (whereto these words in our Author do refer) we shall find, that the Proponant p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omises nothing more than to be su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct to the censures administred unto him b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor of the Church and its Officers.</HI> So, Sirs, the <HI>Brethren</HI> are dropt, wittingly, no doubt, by the quick sighted Author.
