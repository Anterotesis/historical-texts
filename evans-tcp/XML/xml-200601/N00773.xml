<Q>In sinning against <HI>God,</HI> the sinner does not act like a <HI>Reasonable man.</HI></Q></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to act more like a <HI>Beast,</HI> than like a <HI>Man,</HI> for any man to sin a∣gainst the God that made him.

<P>Now,</P>
<P>In the first place, We have a <HI>Rea∣sonable Demonstration</HI> of this Asserti∣on, in the <HI>Divine Testimony</HI> of <HI>The Scripture.</HI> We don't <HI>shew our selve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> men,</HI> if we don't Receive that Book▪ which we call, <HI>The Bible,</HI> or, <HI>The Scripture,</HI> as a <HI>Divine Testimony.</HI> It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ands not with <HI>Reason</HI> that any but the <HI>Holy God,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould be the Author of such an <HI>Holy Book.</HI> It is highly Reasonable, That the God, who <HI>is Good,</HI> and who <HI>does Good,</HI> should by <HI>writing teach His good Statutes</HI> unto us. But if we <HI>shew our selves men</HI>; we

shall no where find any Book but This, where we shall see <HI>Written</HI> the <HI>Statutes</HI> of God. All the <HI>Wicked</HI> Force of <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Hell,</HI> hath been Employ'd for the suppression of this <HI>Book</HI>: If it had not been <HI>Gods Book,</HI> it could not have been preserved. The <HI>Mysteries,</HI> the <HI>Prophecies,</HI> and the <HI>Majesty</HI> of the <HI>Book,</HI> are the evident Signatures of a <HI>God</HI> upon it.
