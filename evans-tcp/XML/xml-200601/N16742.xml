<P>ART. 6. The Consuls and vice-Consuls res∣pectively may establish a chancery where shall be deposited the Consular acts and deliberations, all effects left by deceased persons, or saved from shipwreck, as well as testaments, obliga∣tions, contracts and in general all the acts and proceedings done between, or by persons of their nation.</P>

<P>ART. 7. The Consuls and vice-Consuls res∣pectively shall have the exclusive right of re∣ceiving in their chancery, or on board of vessels, the declarations and all the other acts, which the captains, masters, seamen, passen∣gers, and merchants of their nation would make there, even their testaments and other disposi∣tions of last will; and the copies of the said acts, duly authenticated by the said Consuls or vice-Consuls, and under the seal of their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nsulate, shall receive faith in law in all the tribunals of <HI>France</HI> and the United States.</P>

<P>ART. 8. The respective Consuls and vice-Consuls shall receive the declarations, consu∣lates and other consular acts from all Captains and masters of their respective nation on ac∣count of average losses sustained at sea <HI>by leakage or throwing merchandise over board</HI> and these Captains and masters shall leave in the chancery of the said Consuls and vice Consuls the consulates and other consular acts which they may have had made in other ports, on account of the accidents which may have hap∣pened to them on their voyage. If a subject of his M. C. M. and a citizen of the U. S. are interested in the said cargo, the average shall be fixed by the Tribunals of the country, and not by the Consuls or Vice-Consuls: <HI>and the Tribunals shall admit the acts and declarations, if any should have been passed before the said Consuls and Vice-Consuls:</HI> but when only the subjects of their own nation, <HI>or foreigners</HI> shall be in∣terested, the respective Consuls or vice Con∣suls <HI>and in case of their absence or distance their agents furnished with their commission</HI> shall offi∣cially nominate skilful persons <HI>of their said na∣tion</HI> to regulate the damages and averages.</P>

S. shall run a shore on the coasts of <HI>France,</HI> the Consul or vice-Consul nearest to the place of shipwreck shall do whatever he may judge proper, as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the purpose of saving the said ship or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssel, its cargo and appartunances, as for the storing and security of the effects and merchandise saved. He may take an inventory, without any officers mili∣tary, of the custom house, justices or the police of the country interfering, otherwise than to facilitate to the Consuls, vice-Consuls, captain, and crew of the vessel shipwrecked or run a shore, all the assistance and favour which they shall ask, either for the celerity and security of the salvage and effects saved, or to pre∣vent all disturbances.</P>
<P>To prevent even any kind of dispute and discussion in the said cases of shipwreck, it has been agreed, that where no Consul or vice-Consul shall be found to attend to the salvage, or that the residence of the said Consul or vice-Consul (he not being at the place of shipwreck) shall be further distant from the said place than that of the com∣petent territorial Judge, the latter shall im∣mediately there proceed therein with all the celerity, safety and precautions prescribed by the respective laws; but the said territorial Judge shall retire on the coming of the Consul or vice-Consul and shall resign to him the procedures by him done, the expences of which the Consul or vice-Consul shall cause to be reimbursed to him.</P>
<P>The merchandise and effects saved shall be deposited in the custom house, or other nearest place of safety, with the inventory of them, which shall be made by the Consul or vice-Consul▪ or, in their absence, by the Judge who shall have had cognisance thereof, and the said merchandises and effects shall be after∣wards

<P>ART. 10. The Consuls and vice-Consuls shall have on board of the vessels of their respective Nations, full power and Jurisdiction in Matters, Civil. <HI>They shall cause to be executed the respective laws, Ordinances and rules concerning Navigation, on board the said vessels,</HI></P>
<P>And for this purpose they shall go there without being interrupted by any Officer or other person whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>They may cause to be arrested every vessel carrying the flag of their respective Nation; they may sequester them and even send them back respectively from the U.

<P>Art. 11. In cases where the respective subjects shall have committed any crime, they shall be amenable to the Judges of the Country.</P>
<P>Art. 12. All differences and suits between the subjects of His M. C. M. settled in the U. S. or between the citizens <HI>and subjects</HI> of the U. S. settled in <HI>France, and all differences and suits concerning Commerce, between the subjects

<HEAD>1788. CONVENTION between His most Christian Majesty and the United States of America, for the purpose of defining and establishing the functions and privileges of their re∣spective Consuls and vice-Consuls.</HEAD>
<P>His Majesty the most Christian King and the United States of America having by the 29th article of the Treaty of amity and com∣merce concluded between them, mutually granted the liberty of having, in their respe∣ctive States and Ports, Consuls, vice-Consuls, Agents and Commissaries, and being willing in consequence thereof to define and establish in a reciprocal and permanent manner the functions and privileges of Consuls and vice-Consuls, which they have judged it convenient to esta∣blish of preference, His M. C. Majesty has no∣minated the Sieur Count of Montmorin of St. Herent, Marechal of his Camps and Armies, Knight of his Orders and of the Golden Fleece, his Counsellor in all his Councils, Minister and Secretary of State and of his Commandments and Finances, having the Department of fo∣reign affairs, and the United States have no∣minated Thomas Jefferson, Citizen of the United States of America and their Minister Plenipotentiary near the King, who after having communicated to each other their respective full powers, have agreed on what follows:</P>
<P>ART. I. The Consuls and vice-Consuls named by the M. C. K. and the U. S. shall be bound to present their commissions according to the forms which shall be established respectively by the M. C. K. within his dominions, and by the Congress within the U. S. there shall be deliver▪
<PB N="2" REF="021525_0002_0FB4092A58F0F2E0"/>
to them, without any charges, the Exequatur necessary for the exercise of their functions; and on exhibiting the said Exequatur, the Governors, Commanders, Heads of justice, bodies corporate, Tribunals and other Officers having authority in the ports and places of their consulates, shall cause them to enjoy immediately, and without difficulty, the pree∣minencies, authority and privileges, recipro∣cally granted, without exacting from the said Consuls and vice-Consuls any fee, under any pretext whatever.</P>
<P>ART. II. The Consuls and vice-Consuls and persons attached to their functions that is to say, their Chancellors and Secretaries, shall enjoy a full and entire immunity for their Chancery and the papers which shall be therein contained: they shall be exempt from all personal service, from soldiers billets, militia, watch, guard, guardianship, trustee-ship, as well as from all duties, taxes, impositions, and charges what∣soever, except on the estate real and personal of which they may be the proprietors or possessors, which shall be subject to the taxes imposed on the estates of all other individuals: and in all other instances they shall be subject to the laws of the land as the natives are.</P>
<P>Those of the said Consuls and vice-Consuls who shall exercise commerce shall be respectively subject to all taxes, charges and impositions established on other merchants.</P>
<P>They shall place over the outward door of their house the arms of their Sovereign: but this mark of indication shall not give to the said house any privilege of asylum for any person or property whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="021525_0003_0FB4092BCBD06A00"/>ART. III. The respective Consuls and vice-Consuls may establish Agents in the different ports and places of their departments where necessity shall require. These Agents may be chosen among the merchants either national or foreign, and furnished with a commission from one of the said Consuls: they shall confine themselves respectively to the rendering to their respective merchants, navigators, and vessels all possible service, and to inform the nearest Consul of the wants of the said mer∣chants, navigators and vessels, without the said Agents otherwise participating in the immu∣nities, rights and privileges attributed to Con∣suls and vice-Consuls, and without power under any pretext whatever to exact from the said merchants any duty or emolument whatsoever.</P>
<P>ART. IV. The Consuls and vice-Consuls respectively may establish a chancery, where shall be deposited the Consular determinations, acts and proceedings as also testaments, obliga∣tions, contracts, and other acts done by, or between persons of their nation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> left by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or saved <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shipwreck.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="021525_0004_0FB4092D4C951990" MS="y"/>They may consequently appoint fit persons to act in the said chancery, qualify and swear them in, commit to them the custody of the seal, and authority to seal commissions, sen∣tences and other consular acts, and also to dis∣charge the functions of notaries and registers of the Consulate.</P>
<P>ART. V. The Consuls and vice-Consuls res∣pectively shall have the exclusive right of re∣ceiving in their chancery, or on board their vessels, the declarations and all other the acts, which the captains, masters, crews, passen∣gers, and merchants of their nation may chuse to make there, even their testaments and other disposals by last will: and the copies of the said acts, duly authenticated by the said Consuls or vice-Consuls, under the seal of their consulate shall receive faith in law, equally as their originals would, in all the tribunals of the dominions of the M. C. King and of the United States.</P>
<P>They shall also have, and exclusively, in case of the absence of the testamentary executor, guardian or lawful representative, the right to inventory, liquidate and proceed to the sale of the personal estate left by subjects or citizens of their nation, who shall die within the extent of their consulate: they shall proceed therein with the assistance of two merchants of their said nation, or, for want of them, of any other at their choice, and shall cause to be deposit∣ed in their chancery, the effects and papers of the said estates; and no officer military, judi∣ciary, or of the police of the country shall disturb them or interfere therein, in any man∣ner whatsoever: but the said Consuls and vice-Consuls shall not deliver up the said ef∣fects, nor the proceeds thereof to the lawful representatives or to their order, till they shall have caused to be paid all debts which the deceased shall have contracted in the country; for which purpose the creditor shall have a right to attach the said effects in their hands as they might in those of any other individual what∣ever, and proceed to obtain sale of them till pay∣ment of what shall be lawfully due to them. When the debts shall not have been contracted
<PB N="5" REF="021525_0005_0FB4092ECBDEFC78"/>
by judgment, deed or note, the signature where∣of shall be known, payment shall not be ordered but on the creditor's giving sufficient surety resident in the country, to refund the sums he shall have unduly received, principal, interest and costs: which surety nevertheless shall stand duly discharged after the term of one year in time of peace, and of two in time of war, if the discharge cannot be formed before the end of this term against the representatives who shall present themselves.</P>
<P>And in order that the representatives may not be unjustly kept out of the effects of the deceased the Consuls and vice-Consuls shall notify his death in some one of the gazettes published within their consulate, and that they shall retain the said effects in their hands four months to answer all just de∣mands which shall be presented: and they shall be bound after this delay to deliver to the persons succeeding thereto what shall be more than suffi∣cient for the demands which shall have been formed.</P>
<P>ART. VI. The Consuls and vice-Consuls respectively shall receive the declarations, protests and reports of all captains and masters of their respective nation on account of average losses sustained at sea: &amp; these captains and masters shall lodge in the chancery of the said Consuls and vice-Consuls, the acts which they may</P>
<P>have made in other ports on account of the accidents which may have happened to them on their voyage. If a subject of the M. C. K. and a citizen of the U. S. or a foreigner are interested in the said cargo, the average shall be settled by the tribunals of the country and not by the Consuls or vice-Consuls; but when only the subjects or citizens of their own na∣tion shall be interested, the respective Consuls or vice-Consuls shall appoint skilful persons to settle the damages and average.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="021525_0006_0FB409304A4AFAB0"/>ART. VII. In cases where by tempest, or other accident, French ships or vessels shall be stranded on the coasts of the U. S. and ships or vessels of the U. S. shall be stranded on the coasts of the dominions of the M. C. K. the Consul or vice-Consul nearest to the place of shipwreck shall do whatever he may judge proper, as well for the purpose of saving the said ship or vessel, its cargo and appurtenances, as for the storing and the security of the ef∣fects and merchandise saved. He may take an inventory of them, without the intermedling of any officers of the military, of the customs, of justice, or of the police of the country, otherwise than to give to the Consuls, vice-Consuls, captain and crew of the vessel ship∣wrecked or stranded all the succour and fa∣vour which they shall ask of them, either for the expedition and security of the saving and of the effects saved, as to prevent all di∣sturbance.</P>
<P>And in order to prevent all kind of dispute and discussion in the said cases of shipwreck, it is agreed that when there shall be no Consul or vice-Consul to attend to the saving of the wreck, or that the residence of the said Consul or vice-Consul (he not being at the place of the wreck) shall be more distant from the said place than that of the com∣petent Judge of the Country, the latter shall immediately proceed therein, with all the dispatch, certainty and precautions prescribed by the respective laws; but the said territorial Judge shall retire, on the arrival of the Consul or vice-Consul, and shall deliver over to him the report of his proceedings, the expen∣ces of which the Consul or vice-Consul shall cause to be reimbursed to him, as well as those of saving the wreck.</P>
<P>The merchandise and effects saved shall be deposited in the nearest custom house, or other place of safety, with the inventory thereof which shall have been made by the Consul or vice Consul, or by the Judge who shall have proceeded in their absence, that the said effects and merchandise may be afterwards delivered,
<PB N="7" REF="021525_0007_0FB40931CC06C028"/>
(after levying therefrom the costs) and without form of process, to the owners, who being fur∣nished with an order for their delivery from the nearest Consul or vice-Consul, shall reclaim them by themselves, or by their order, either for the purpose of reexporting such merchandise, in which case they shall pay no kind of duty of exportation, or for that of selling them in the Country, if they be not prohibited there, and in this last case, the said merchandise, if they be damaged, shall be allowed an abatement of entrance duties pro∣portioned to the damage they have sustained, which shall be ascertained by the affidavits taken at the time the vessel was wrecked or struck.</P>
<P>Art. VIII.
