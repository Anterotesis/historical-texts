<P>'TIS well known, to all that know the ancient <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>only People,</HI> which the God of <HI>Heaven</HI> then had on <HI>Earth,</HI> That the Lord by His <HI>Laws</HI> required His People, to offer their <HI>First Fruits</HI> unto Him. Yea, The <HI>First Sons</HI> of men that ever were <HI>Born</HI> into the World, actually and practically acknowledged their Obligations to offer their <HI>First Fruits</HI> unto the Lord. And the <HI>Pa∣gans</HI> themselves found the <HI>Tradition,</HI> of paying their <HI>First Fruits</HI> unto the Lord, so agreeable unto the <HI>Light of Na∣ture</HI> in them, that even among the <HI>Pagans</HI> also, it was a Note of the Highest <HI>Profanity,</HI> for any to Refuse the pay∣ment thereof. Yea, a famous Writer among them writes of a People so Irreligious &amp; Atheistical, that God had not their <HI>First Fruits,</HI> which, he sayes, <HI>Were by a Sudden De∣solation so strangely destroy'd, that there were no Remainders, either of the Persons, or of their Houses, Left.</HI></P>
<P>It is Observed, That a dreadful <HI>Desolation</HI> is in a thou∣sand ways continually carrying off the <HI>Young men</HI> of this Country; And it may be concluded, That the moral cause of this woful <HI>Desolation</HI> is, because our <HI>Young People</HI> do no more offer their <HI>First Fruits</HI> unto the Lord.</P>
<P>The obscure Author of the Short Sermon, here Ex∣posed, was willing to bespeak the <HI>First Fruits</HI> of <HI>Piety</HI> in the <HI>Young People</HI> of his Flock, for their Glorious Lord; and he made some fresh and sad Instances of <HI>Desolation</HI> among them▪ to be the <HI>Occasion,</HI> and the <HI>Argument</HI> of his Doing it. A Speech once made by a General from a <HI>Tomb Stone,</HI> was once vainly counted Ominous. Hea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n can make a Speech made, as it were, from a <HI>Grave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>one,</HI> Acceptable and Serviceable.

<HI>Men</HI> of our Land. If it were a special Article in the Afflictions of <HI>Job,</HI> That the <HI>Young Men</HI> in his Family were cut off, with an <HI>Untimely Death</HI>: Alas, how many, how many of our poor Fami∣lies are in like sort Afflicted, by <HI>Deadly Strokes,</HI> carrying off our <HI>Young men</HI> before their Time! The Sons of <HI>Job,</HI> were suddenly Snatch'd out of the World. If they had <HI>their Life among the Unclean,</HI> as <HI>Elihu</HI> seems to fear they had, it was none of their pious Fathers Fault; They had a Father full of Prayer, and Care, and <HI>Fear,</HI> con∣cerning them, lest they should <HI>Bid Farewell</HI> to the <HI>Fear of God:</HI> And there is ground for <HI>Hope,</HI> that they might be such as were not <HI>Lost,</HI> when they were <HI>Dead.</HI> Nevertheless they <HI>Dy'd in Youth</HI>; and their <HI>Death</HI> was attended with some very Tragical Circumstances. We often have a <HI>Report</HI> brought unto us, concerning our Sons, <HI>The Young men are Dead.</HI> Three <HI>Young men</HI> went well out of their Fathers Houses, one morning the last Week: and before the next Evening, the <HI>Report</HI> was brought, <HI>The Young men are Dead.</HI> And it is not long since other <HI>Young men,</HI> have in the very same <HI>way,</HI> come to the same <HI>Untime∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> End</HI> The <HI>Report</HI> hath been brought many &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Time unto us from abroad concerning the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>men</HI> of our Acquaintance that from hence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> abroad, <HI>The Young Men are Dead.</HI> Many <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Neighbours have their Sons and their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> absent from them; and that which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Absence the more uneasie is, the
<PB N="7" REF="000934_0005_0FAD92EE37E1EC68"/>
Dread of having that <HI>Report</HI> shortly brought un∣to us, <HI>The Young men are Dead.</HI> Such a <HI>Report</HI> was brought unto <HI>Job,</HI> and after many and bit∣ter and heavy Afflictions the bringing of this <HI>Report</HI> unto him, was the Last and the Heighth of all, until painful and pining <HI>Sickness</HI> at length arrested also the <HI>Body,</HI> of that Holy man. The Remark which we have now to make is,</P>
<P>That as All Men must Dy, so Young men may Dy.</P>
<P>Persons may be liable to the Stroke of <HI>Death,</HI> even in the Time of <HI>Youth.</HI> 'Tis observed by the Learned <HI>Amyraut,</HI>
<Q>That the Saints of old, thought that God sent them into the World for two ends; the one, to advance His <HI>Glory</HI> as much as they were able; the other, to Enjoy therein the Testimonies of His <HI>Favour,</HI> in Tem∣poral Blessings for a course of years, which is the <HI>Ordinary Term of Life: Death</HI> before the <HI>Full Age</HI> of a man, they therefore deprecated, as among the Testimonies of the Divine <HI>An∣ger</HI>; as if a <HI>Young Plant</HI> should complain to the Gardiner,, for cutting it off at the Root, when it is just beginning to <HI>Bud.</HI></Q>
Nevertheless we see it every day come to pass, that <HI>Plants</HI> of <HI>all Ages</HI> are <HI>Cut down</HI> by the Knife of <HI>Death.</HI> What one says of the <HI>Grammarian,</HI> may be said of eve∣ry Child of <HI>Adam,</HI> That being able to <HI>Decline</HI> all other <HI>Nouns</HI> in every <HI>Case,</HI> he can <HI>Decline
<PB N="8" REF="000934_0006_0FAD92EEE1569778"/>
Death</HI> in no <HI>Case</HI> at all. <HI>All Ages</HI> from a sad Experience have given us a full Demonstration of it; That persons are Seized by Death at <HI>all Ages. Young men</HI> Dy as well as <HI>Old men</HI>; yea, more Dy while <HI>Young men,</HI> than ever come to be <HI>Old men.</HI> We say, There are <HI>Skins</HI> of all Ages in the Market, and <HI>Skulls</HI> of all sizes in <HI>Golgotha.</HI> Yea, more Dy before <HI>Thirty,</HI> than after <HI>Sixty.</HI> And that which puts a doleful Accent on this Remark is, That <HI>Young men</HI> may Dy very <HI>Sud∣denly</HI>; and as <HI>Job</HI> speaks, and as <HI>Jobs</HI> did, <HI>In a moment they go down to the Grave. Death</HI> does not always make a slow Dispatch, by some Di∣sease, upon <HI>Young men</HI>; it sometimes Dispatches them with a <HI>sudden</HI> Violence. The <HI>Thunder,</HI> and the <HI>Whirlwind,</HI> that overwhelm'd the Sons of <HI>Job,</HI> is not more <HI>sudden</HI> in its violence. There are numberless <HI>Accidents,</HI> by which the <HI>Angels of Death,</HI> do their Excution <HI>at once,</HI> when they have a <HI>Commission</HI> to take <HI>Young men</HI> into their Hands. <HI>Drowning</HI> is one of those <HI>Accidents,</HI> than which there is none more frequent; Thus is <HI>the Lamp of Young men put out</HI>! It is <HI>at once</HI> plung'd into the Water, and in less than three minutes perhaps it is <HI>put out.</HI> Before <HI>Clock work</HI> was ad∣vanced, the best Instrument for measuring of Time known in the English Nation, was that poor one of K. <HI>Alfred, The Burning of a Candle marked into twelve parts.</HI> If such an Instrument ought new to be allowed for a Resemblance of Humane <HI>Life,</HI> we must say upon it, <HI>Alas, How of∣ten
<PB N="9" REF="000934_0007_0FAD92EF95D62620"/>
is a Candle blown out before the Six hours of the Twelve are spent! Young men</HI> may be <HI>Well</HI> and <HI>Gone,</HI> in half an Hours Time. In the Forenoon <HI>Young men</HI> may think themselves likely to Live yet some scores of years; In the Afternoon something befals them, whereupon the Report shall come, <HI>The Young men are Dead.</HI></P>
<P>The Thing which we are now to Endeavour, is, to make some Agreeable and Profitable <HI>Im∣provement</HI> of this plain <HI>Remark.</HI></P>
<P>Since our <HI>Young men,</HI> are so many of them <HI>Dead,</HI> and so Suddenly, and so Awfully <HI>Dead,</HI> what <HI>Improvement</HI> should the <HI>Living</HI> make of their <HI>Untimely Death?</HI></P>
<P>Let our Improvement Ly in these points of Christianity.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Are the <HI>Young men Dead?</HI> Let <HI>All People,</HI> and especially let <HI>Young People,</HI> seriously Lay to Heart, the <HI>Death</HI> of so many <HI>Young People</HI> among us, and the surprizing, the amazing manner of their <HI>Death.</HI> It was threatned, in Psal. 28 5. <HI>Because they regard not the Works of the Lord, He shall destroy them.</HI> Young People, would you not be <HI>Destroy'd</HI>! Then seriously <HI>Regard</HI> those <HI>Works of the Lord,</HI> by which He hath already <HI>Destroy'd</HI> so many of you. Very lamentable was the Condition of that people, concerning whom the Lord said, in Isa. 9.17. <HI>The Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="10" REF="000934_0008_0FAD92F065E844F8"/>
shall have no Joy, in their Young men.</HI> Alas, My Neighbours; We may Lament this as our own Condition; In the <HI>Deaths</HI> which carry off so many of our <HI>Young men,</HI> we may read this Thing written, with Dismal and with Direful Charact∣ers of Blood, <HI>The Lord has much Wrath against their Young men.</HI> The <HI>Wrath</HI> of God hath been Burning like a Formidable <HI>Fire</HI> against our Land; Our <HI>Stupidity</HI> is paenal and fatal, and the <HI>worst part</HI> of that <HI>Wrath,</HI> if we are insensible of it. Now a very sore Ingredient of our Calami∣ties under it, hath been that, in Psal. 78.63. <HI>The Fire consumed their Young men.</HI> The <HI>Deaths</HI> of our <HI>Young men</HI> have been inflicted at such a rate, that we may cry out with the Prophet; <HI>The Curse hath devoured our Land, and few desirable Young men are left.</HI></P>
<P>I know not well, how to give <HI>Orderly Relati∣on</HI> of the <HI>Confusion,</HI> into which our <HI>Young People</HI> have been daily falling for many years together. But give me leave to take the words of that Prophet, whom they call, <HI>The Weeping Prophet,</HI> and [<HI>Where are you, O Tears, when we speak of such a matter!</HI>] Say, <HI>I am full of the Great Wrath of the Lord, and I will tell you, how it has been poured on the Assembly of our Young men together.</HI></P>
<P>First, By the <HI>Sword</HI> of an Extended and Pro¦longed <HI>War,</HI> Our <HI>Young men are Dead</HI>: they were brought forth, and brought up, <HI>for the Murderer.</HI> The Almighty and provoked God, pass,d upon us that Sentence, in Jer. 18.21. <HI>Let their Young
<PB N="11" REF="000934_0009_0FAD92F1EF2E2000"/>
men be Slain by the Sword.</HI> And accordingly, our <HI>Young men</HI> were for many years together, Press'd into the <HI>Wars</HI>; but the <HI>Pressing of</HI> them was but <HI>Numbring <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for the Slaughter.</HI> What were the Enemies, that for many years together vexed us, but those, of whom we might say, and sigh, <HI>The Lord has called an Assembly against me, to Crush my Young men.</HI> But then, Our <HI>Young People</HI> terrified by the Hardships Ashore, have gone to <HI>Do Business on the Great Waters</HI>; and the Storms of the Divine Displeasure have so pursued them there also, that more of our <HI>Young men are Dead.</HI> It hath been with our <HI>Young People,</HI> as it was with <HI>Zidons,</HI> in Isa. 23.4. <HI>The Sea hath spoken, I do not nourish up young men.</HI> Wonderful <HI>Ship∣wrecks</HI> have sunk <HI>Multitudes, Multitudes</HI> of our <HI>Young men,</HI> into the deep <HI>Valley of Destruction</HI>: God has cast them into the <HI>Place of Silence,</HI> and the <HI>Waters have compassed them about, they have gone down to the Bottom of the Mountains, the Bars of the Pit have been about them for ever.</HI> And of those that have Escaped <HI>Shipwrecks,</HI> how many, [<HI>God knows!</HI>] how many have Sailed unto their <HI>Long Home</HI> at the <HI>Ports</HI> where they have arrived; and so <HI>come short Home? Themistius</HI> Elegantly com∣pares the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Old men,</HI> to going out of an <HI>Inn,</HI> the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Young men</HI> to a <HI>Shipwreck</HI>; alas, how often does it happen unto us every year, by a <HI>Literal Shipwreck</HI>? The <HI>Sea</HI> has been the <HI>Snare</HI> of our <HI>Young men</HI>: and a <HI>Snare</HI> of <HI>Death.</HI> For this invites us to Reflect upon a Third <HI>Way
<PB N="12" REF="000934_0010_0FAD92F2A4E0BC20"/>
of Dying,</HI> wherein our <HI>Young men are Dead.</HI> Not only Contageous and Epidemical <HI>Distempers</HI> have been raging in our own Towns, whereby our <HI>Young People,</HI> have been chiefly prey'd upon; but our <HI>Young People</HI> have gone into <HI>Frigats,</HI> and gone unto <HI>Islands,</HI> that have been so many <HI>Post-Houses,</HI> for their <HI>Sickliness.</HI> We are from thence often informed, as in Jer. 9.21. <HI>Death has cut off the young men from the Streets,</HI> and from the <HI>Ships</HI>: and for that cause, there are many <HI>Mourners in our Streets.</HI> But in fine, lest here should not be <HI>Deaths</HI> enough, to take off our <HI>young men,</HI> behold, how many <HI>Casualties,</HI> do ever now and then, produce this Report among our Neighbours, <HI>The Young men are Dead</HI>! Ever now and then, our <HI>Young men</HI> are <HI>Drown'd,</HI> perhaps by Two or Three at a Time, or by <HI>Falls,</HI> or <HI>Shot,</HI> or some other <HI>Quick Mischief,</HI> they are hurried away into the <HI>Land of Darkness.</HI> Now when two <HI>Young men</HI> were kill'd with a <HI>Sudden Death,</HI> in <HI>Israel,</HI> it was Enjoyned, in Lev. 10.6. <HI>Let the whole House of Israel bewayl it.</HI> Even so, since there have been so many <HI>Young men,</HI> detach'd from us by a <HI>Sudden Death</HI>▪ I must call upon you all, to <HI>Bewayl</HI> it before the Lord.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Are the <HI>Young men Dead</HI>? Let <HI>All People,</HI> especially let <HI>Young People,</HI> consider, <HI>How Soon,</HI> [they know not, <HI>How Soon</HI>!] the Time of their <HI>Death</HI> may overtake them. The <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Young men,</HI> has a Voice to <HI>All men</HI>; especially
<PB N="13" REF="000934_0011_0FAD92F351E6B7C8"/>
if it be a <HI>Sudden Death,</HI> 'tis then a <HI>Speaking Death</HI>: And the language of it, is that in Pro. 27.1. <HI>Boast not thy self of To morrow, for thou knowest not, what a Day may bring forth.</HI> Syrs, the <HI>Sudden Death of young men,</HI> does naturally Lead us to this Consideration; That ordinarily there is not any man, who doth on any Day infallibly know what shall on that <HI>very Day</HI> befal him. [<HI>Nescis quid serus vesper vebat.</HI>] Where is the man, that when he Rises in a morning, may presume to say <HI>I shall Out live this Day,</HI> or, <HI>This Day shall not be my Last</HI>! It was said by the <HI>Wise man,</HI> (and every <HI>Wise man</HI> will often think of it!) in Eccl 9.12. <HI>Man knoweth not his Time; as the Fishes are taken in an Evil Net, and as the Birds that are caught in the Snare, so are the Sons of men snared in an Evil Time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. Time</HI> here means, the <HI>Changes</HI> that are in <HI>Time</HI> to come upon us. 'Tis ordinarily so; The most knowing of Mortals, may every Day say, <HI>I don't know what Changes are this Day to come upon me.</HI> The <HI>Nets,</HI> the <HI>Snares,</HI> of Dis∣asters are, for ought we know continually Spread for us: and silly Creatures that we are, we know not when we shall fall into them. No Day does ordinarily arrive to any man, but for ought he knows, <HI>That very Day may bring forth his Death unto him.</HI> He was an <HI>Old man,</HI> that said, in Gen. 27 2. <HI>I know not the Day of my Death.</HI> But show me the
<PB N="14" REF="000934_0012_0FAD92F669CC4D58"/>
<HI>Young man</HI> that must not say so too. O that <HI>all men,</HI> and peculiarly <HI>Young</HI> men would after <HI>this Day,</HI> Live every <HI>Day,</HI> in some sort as if it might prove their <HI>Last.</HI> 'Tis oftentimes the portion of <HI>Wicked</HI> men to <HI>Dy suddenly.</HI> Little did the Inhabitants of the four Criminal Cities, <HI>Know what a Day would bring forth,</HI> when they were at <HI>Sun rise</HI> in the midst of their Debaucheries, but before <HI>Sun set</HI> the <HI>Vengeance of Eternal Fire</HI> took hold upon them. Little did the <HI>Philistines know what a Day would bring forth,</HI> when they were in the midst of their profane <HI>Sport,</HI> but they were immediately <HI>Crush'd unto Death,</HI> by the fall of an House about their Ears. Little did the <HI>Assyrians know what a Day would bring forth,</HI> when they were full of Merry and Jolly Expectations over-night, but were by the next morning made Lifeless carcases by the irresistible <HI>Thunder</HI> of God. Little did <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira know what a Day would bring forth,</HI> when they came into the Congregation in perfect Health; but were carryed Home <HI>Dead</HI>; they <HI>Dy'd upon the Spot.</HI> Oftentimes 'tis the Portion of <HI>Godly</HI> men also to <HI>Dy Suddenly</HI> Little did the People that were Sacrificing at the Temple, <HI>Know what a day would bring forth,</HI> when they were going to shed the Blood of their <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> but had their own <HI>Blood</HI> shed with that of their <HI>Sacrifices.</HI> Little did the honest Folks, that were waiting under the Tower of <HI>Siloam, know what a Day would bring forth,</HI> one minute before the Tower
<PB N="15" REF="000934_0013_0FAD92F74A06F0B8"/>
fell upon them. Little did <HI>Uzzah know what a Day would bring forth,</HI> when he laid his Hand up∣on the Ark. Little did the Prophet sent unto <HI>Jeroboam, know what a day would bring forth,</HI> when a Lyon was waiting to devour him. In short, as Dy'd an <HI>Ahab,</HI> so Dy'd a <HI>Josiah.</HI> Yea, and <HI>Young men,</HI> may <HI>Dy Suddenly</HI> as well as other men. It was a true Speech of <HI>Aquinas, An old man ha's Death just before his Face, but a Young man ha's Death just behind his Back. Death</HI> may Smite a <HI>Young man,</HI> as soon as an <HI>Old man.</HI> And the same uncertainty, that men every Morning have about what may befal themselves in their <HI>Death</HI> before the Evening, the same they have about the other <HI>Calamitous Changes</HI> that may befall them, and a∣bout the <HI>Calamities</HI> that may befal any others that belong unto them. One that, ha's an <HI>Husband</HI> or a <HI>Father</HI> in the Morning, does not <HI>know</HI> but this Day may make them, a <HI>Widow</HI> and an <HI>Or∣phan.</HI> A <HI>Job</HI> has his <HI>Children</HI> about him, in the Morning, and he did not <HI>know,</HI> that before Night his <HI>Children</HI> should be <HI>his</HI> no more. In such <HI>Ignorance,</HI> does the <HI>All wise</HI> God, keep the Children of men concerning their own futurities. By this <HI>Ignorance</HI> we are the better kept in a <HI>Filial Faith,</HI> on the <HI>Fatherly Care</HI> of that God, in <HI>whose Hands are our Times.</HI> 'Tis indeed the only <HI>Ignorance</HI> that is the <HI>Mother of Devotion.</HI> I will use upon it, the Expressive words of the Learn∣ed <HI>Heinsius, Non quaedam ignorare tantum, sed et ignorare quaedam velle, Humilitatis C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ristianae par∣tem

non Exiguam Existimamus.</HI> 'Tis a part of a Good <HI>Christian,</HI> to <HI>Affect</HI> such an <HI>Ignorance.</HI> And as it is a <HI>Judgment</HI> upon <HI>Wicked</HI> men, that they must not <HI>know</HI> aforehand, <HI>what</HI> is to befal them, or, <HI>when</HI> it shall befal them: For hereby, as the Psalmist speaks, in Psal. 73.13. <HI>How are they brought into Desolation as in a moment?</HI> So, 'tis a <HI>Favour</HI> unto <HI>Godly</HI> men. If they <HI>knew what a Day would bring forth</HI> such a <HI>knowledge</HI> would but make <HI>Sorrow</HI> for every <HI>Day.</HI> It would utterly take away the <HI>Comfort</HI> we take in any thing under the Sun, if we <HI>knew</HI> aforehand, <HI>When</HI> and <HI>How</HI> we are to take our leave of that Comfort. As the man of God <HI>Wept,</HI> when he beheld <HI>Hazael</HI> in 2 King. 8.12. <HI>Because</HI> (as he said) <HI>I know the Evil that thou wilt do:</HI> Thus if a man <HI>knew the Evil</HI> that is anon to befal himself or his house, he would so fall a <HI>Weeping</HI> at it, that he would be able to Tast no sweetness in the <HI>Gifts of God</HI> unto him. Consider, O my <HI>Young</HI> people, consider; You know not what may <HI>Suddenly</HI> come upon any of you.</P>

It is very certain, [<HI>The Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it!</HI>] That for to Dy <HI>Unconverted,</HI> is to Dy <HI>Miserable. Be not Deceived,</HI> my <HI>Young</HI> Folks; To go out of the World, without <HI>Conversion,</HI> is to go into <HI>Confusion</HI> world without end. Endless and Easeless <HI>De∣struction</HI></P>
