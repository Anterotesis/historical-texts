<HEAD>To my Much Honoured FRIENDS; The Pious and Valiant COMMANDERS, Of the FORCES now engaged a∣gainst our Indian Enemies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Request <HI>from One of</HI> you, <HI>was that which</HI> I <HI>esteemed a</HI> Command, <HI>for my</HI> Preaching <HI>of a Sermon fill'd with</HI> Coun∣sils <HI>and</HI> Comforts <HI>to part of the Forces now under your auspicious Conduct. I was too dull to apprehend it either an</HI> Impudent <HI>or an</HI> Improper <HI>thing for me to do</HI> That, <HI>While I found a Minister (and Him none of the</HI> Oldest <HI>neither</HI> ) <HI>charged with a very great Solemnity,</HI> Preach the Word, Be in∣stant in season, out of season, WATCH thou in all things, fulfil thy Ministry.</P>
<P><PB REF="000488_0003_0FA672EDEBA61A50"/>
<HI>That which most wants an excuse is the</HI> Printing <HI>of it; which is a Service that I have not been so much a</HI> Voluntier <HI>unto. But the Reasons that pro∣duc'd my L</HI> abour <HI>in</HI> Preaching, <HI>which were, my</HI> Desire <HI>to save the </HI> Souls, <HI>and mend the</HI> Lives, <HI>and promote the Edification of those, for whom</HI> my Hearts Desire and Prayer to God, <HI>is,</HI> That they may be Happy; <HI>and my</HI> Ambition <HI>to Encounter and Abolish what I can, the</HI> Unchristian Temper <HI>of those who take advantage from the other Difficul∣ties and Entanglements of the Country, to refuse do∣ing them part in carrying on the</HI> Indian War; <HI>the</HI> same <HI>Reasons have procur'd my</HI> Consent <HI>to</HI> Printing <HI>of this Little Sermon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As I never can endure that mischievous Imperti∣nency, of making the first or chief Exercise after our Hearing, to be upon that Question,</HI> How did you like the Sermon to day? <HI>So</HI> I <HI>am not much concer∣ned about the Reception and Entertainment which may be given to</HI> this <HI>poor</HI> Sermon <HI>by the Readers of it. My not having more than half a day to prepare it in, made it incapable of being thus</HI> Written, <HI>till since the Delivery of it; and it is now</HI> written, <HI>as near as well could be to what it was when</HI> Spoken: <HI>without many more</HI> Additions, I <HI>suppose, than may somewhat</HI> Ballance <HI>the</HI> Omissions made <HI>in the Transcription. The</HI> Substaneous <HI>and so much</HI> Ex∣temporaneous <HI>uttering of a Sermon, indeed I am so far from accounting a matter of</HI> Applause, <HI>that</HI> I <HI>do esteem it</HI> Evil <HI>and</HI> Sinful, <HI>and never free from Blame, unless Gods</HI> Providence, <HI>and not our</HI> Election <HI>have made it</HI> Unavoidable; <HI>nor is any thing in the world

more fulsome and nauseous, than for a Preacher to value himself upon such a</HI> Crime, <HI>as</HI> his not spen∣ding much time in Study. I <HI>do therefore beg par∣don, that I offer you what is no</HI> better Studied; <HI>not without expectations; that whether</HI> you <HI>pardon me, or no, there are those that will make me run the</HI> Gant∣lets <HI>of their</HI> Censures <HI>for it; and yet had I never so much leisure for</HI> study; <HI>I would not,</HI> I <HI>could not offer you a more</HI> Needful Thing <HI>than the</HI> Matter, <HI>how∣ever I might offer you a more</HI> Curious <HI>thing than the</HI> Method <HI>of this Discourse. Accept the Sermon as a Little Messenger now sent into the</HI> Camp, <HI>after my</HI> Brethren, <HI>with a little</HI> parched Corn, <HI>to refresh them, against their Facing of the</HI> Philistines; <HI>and I beseech you, let none of them have their</HI> Anger <HI>so kindled, as to tell me,</HI> Why camest thou down hi∣ther? I know thy Pride; <HI>for give me leave to say it,</HI> What have I now done? is there not a Cause?</P>
<P>Gentlemen! <HI>It is the</HI> War of the Lord <HI>which you are now Engaged in: and it is the</HI> Help of the Lord, <HI>that we are at Home affectionately imploring for you. We have made a fair and just purchase of our Country from the Natives here; not encroaching on them after the</HI> Spanish Fashion, <HI>in any of their</HI> Properties <HI>and</HI> Possessions. <HI>Yet they are now mo∣lesting of us in the Enjoyment of what</HI> our God (<HI>be∣cause</HI> our Right) <HI>hath made</HI> our own; <HI>which my Pen cannot mention without</HI> Jehoshaphats <HI>Ejacula∣tion,</HI> We destroy'd them not, but behold how
<PB REF="000488_0005_0FA672EF60465058"/>
they Reward us, to come to cast us out of thy Possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. O our God, Wilt thou not Judge them? I <HI>be∣lieve,</HI> I <HI>am perswaded, and Confident,</HI> He will. <HI>But</HI> your <HI>Wisdom and Courage is now to be Employ'd in order thereunto; and we all wish you such large mea∣sures of</HI> Both, <HI>as the</HI> matter does require. <HI>You are some of you, such as in the</HI> former War, <HI>ventu∣red as far as any men Alive; and the</HI> God of Ar∣mies <HI>then blessed you, not only with</HI> safety, <HI>but with</HI> a success <HI>also, which we should be very</HI> unworthy <HI>if we should be</HI> unthankful <HI>for. As you have thereby learn'd what a Treacherous, Barbarous, Dangerous Enemy you have to deal withal; so you are not with∣out a gracious</HI> Invitation <HI>to Trust in God for your fu∣ture</HI> preservation; <HI>You may animate your selves with such an Hope as that,</HI> The Lord that delive∣red me out of the paw of the Lion, and out of the paw of the Bear, He will also deliver me out of the Hands of the Philistine, <HI>Your for∣mer Deliverances whereof the</HI> Honourable Wounds <HI>upon some of you are perpetual Monitors and Memori∣als, are a Dish of</HI> Leviathans Heads <HI>well draft, for your Faith to feed upon.</HI> Feed <HI>and</HI> Fight <HI>now with a</HI> strong Faith; <HI>By</HI> That <HI>you may</HI> wax Valiant in fight, <HI>and</HI> turn to flight the Armies of the Aliens.</P>
<P>Gentlemen! <HI>Your</HI> Forces <HI>are Happy in</HI> you; <HI>none of you being that Debauched sort of</HI> Captains, <HI>which will</HI> Drink <HI>and</HI> Swear <HI>and</HI> Curse <HI>and</HI> Pro∣fane <HI>the Sabbath, and at the same time give out that

Perilous Word of Command,</HI> Follow your Leader <HI>alas,</HI> whither <HI>do they</HI> Lead <HI>them! But I assure my self that you are such as have long since Listed your selves under the</HI> Banner <HI>of the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> [<HI>Let</HI> His Banner <HI>over you be</HI> Love!] <HI>and are concerned that all your</HI> men <HI>may under that Banner oppose the </HI> Lusts which war against their Souls <HI>Tis the design of this publication that</HI> you <HI>may be as Happy, in your</HI> Forces; <HI>and that those</HI> For <HI>whom and</HI> With <HI>whom you are every day pouring out your Prayers to the</HI> Lord of Hosts, <HI>may not want En∣couragements to any of those Combates, in which you would see them all Victorious. You are in the Head of</HI> Companies, <HI>whom you are generously willing not only to</HI> Live, <HI>but also to Dy withal; and the chief thing that I am pursuing is, That whether Death</HI> join <HI>you to them, or</HI> part <HI>you from them,</HI> You may meet them all e're long at the Right-hand of the Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>I have had many Fears upon my Spi∣rit, lest the wonderful</HI> Deafness <HI>to, and</HI> Contempt <HI>of the Everlasting Gospel found in the</HI> Rising Gene∣ration <HI>here, may not cause the Lord Jesus to say,</HI> That He will not have pleasure in our young men; <HI>but that he will take them</HI> off, <HI>and lay them</HI> waste <HI>by the plagues of a destructive</HI> War. <HI>To pre∣vent such</HI> Omens, <HI>may be motive enough unto</HI> many <HI>such endeavours as you are here treated with. May</HI> These <HI>Warnings reach some of them that had slighted too many others heretofore! I have done when I have told you, That I hope you have not all your</HI> Forces <HI>with you; all the</HI> praying people <HI>of</HI> New-England
<PB REF="000488_0007_0FA672F2CE7055B8"/>
<HI>have Embarked themselves with you, and assist your present Expedition. It was not at all Displeasing unto His Majesty, our most Gracious and Illustrious King</HI> WILLIAM, <HI>to hear those words in a Speech made unto Him by one concerned for us,</HI> It may be Hum∣bly spoken to Your Majesty, The very Prayers of your poor subjects in <HI>New-England,</HI> may do Your Majesty as much Service as an Army of Forty Thousand Men. <HI>'Twill surely be a satisfa∣ction unto</HI> you, <HI>to think what an</HI> Army <HI>of Prayers</HI> (quasi manu facta, <HI>as</HI> Tertullian <HI>expresses it) as every day besieging and beseeching of Heaven for your Prosperity. We are no ways tainted with a Po∣pish Fancy, of I know not what,</HI> Protection <HI>to arise from the</HI> Bodies <HI>of the</HI> Dead Saints <HI>that are inhum'd among us; though a very</HI> Rich Crop <HI>of them will be afforded by this little Spot of Ground, at the</HI> Re∣surrection of the Just. <HI>'Tis foretold of Antichrist,</HI> He shall honour the God of <HI>Mahuzim,</HI> besides, (<HI>for</HI> so <HI>I read it</HI> ) the God which his Fathers knew not, Besides, <HI>the Lord Jesus Christ whom they despise, our Neighbours, the</HI> French, <HI>like other Papists, have their</HI> Mahuzim, <HI>that is, their</HI> Defen∣ders, <HI>or</HI> Guardians; <HI>and those are the</HI> Saints De∣parted. <HI>Hence even some of the</HI> Ancients (<HI>or shall I call them by a</HI> contrary <HI>Name? for,</HI> Antiqui∣tas seculi est Juventus mundi) <HI>themselves, be∣times became so vain, as to count the Reliques of the</HI> Dead Saints, <HI>the</HI> Towers <HI>and</HI> Ramparts <HI>of the places that Enjoy'd them; and the</HI> Dead Bodies <HI>of two Apostles in the City made the Poet cry out,</HI>

<P><HI>But instead thereof, you have the</HI> Prayers <HI>of</HI> Li∣ving Saints <HI>to increase your</HI> Protection <HI>in the worst of your Adventures.

<P>WHEN there was made unto the famous and faithful <HI>John</HI> of old, that Application whereof we have that Ac∣count in Luc. 3. 14. <HI>The Souldiers demanded of Him, saying, What shall we do?</HI> We find that He left them not without those Divine <HI>Words of Com∣mand</HI> which He thought proper and useful for them. 'Tis in Conformity to <HI>his</HI> Great and Good Exemple, that I count my self under Ob∣ligations at this Time to attempt the satisfaction and answer the Expectation of the <HI>Souldiers,</HI> those worthy Leader has brought them into
<PB N="2" REF="000488_0010_0FA672F4B113A8E0"/>
Assembly, that they might hear a short Sermon adapted unto <HI>Their</HI> peculiar Circumstances. We are informed in the Sacred Pages, that in the Expedition of the <HI>Israelites</HI> against the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> There came down <HI>those that Handled the Pen of the Writer.</HI> 'Tis the unhappiness of the Expedi∣tion which <HI>we</HI> are at this day concerned in, that our present and pressing Dangers involve every person some way in it. Even <HI>Scholars</HI> must ei∣ther Accompany or Encourage <HI>souldiers;</HI> and they that have handled none but <HI>Pens,</HI> must ei∣ther carry or sharpen <HI>Swords.</HI> We are in the <HI>Briars of</HI> a Perplexity, wherein, <HI>Omnis Homo Mi∣les est.</HI> Every man is in his way to <HI>bear Arms;</HI> and <HI>Those</HI> that I have to assist you with, I must fetch out of that <HI>Christian Panoply</HI> the Holy Bi∣ble.</P>
<P>'Tis <HI>there,</HI> my Fellow-Souldiers, that <HI>I</HI> find the <HI>Copy</HI> of a Renowned <HI>Souldier,</HI> to suit <HI>your</HI> En∣quiries, when you repair unto me with your <HI>What shall we do</HI> Behold in <HI>That</HI> of the Psalmist, both your own <HI>Condition,</HI> and your own <HI>Direction.</HI> Your <HI>Condition</HI> is, <HI>To have your Lives continually in your Hands.</HI> Your <HI>Direction is, To not forget Gods Law.</HI></P>
<P>The Text now offered unto your Considera∣tion, is in the <HI>longest,</HI> and yet the <HI>sweetest</HI> of all the Psalms. 'Tis in a <HI>Psalm,</HI> which (as one saith) consisteth of words, <HI>Non tam Legenda quam Vivenda,</HI> to be <HI>Lived</HI> rather than <HI>Read</HI> or <HI>Heard;</HI> 
<PB N="3" REF="000488_0011_0FA672F5582DAE98"/>
a Psalm, which (as another says) is, <HI>Quanto trolixior eo prestantior,</HI> having an <HI>Excellency</HI> tran∣scendent like its <HI>Prolixity;</HI> a Psalm which the wittiest of the Ancients in a Dream or Vision had presented unto him, as <HI>The Tree of Life in the midst of the Paradise of God;</HI> What shall I say more? a Psalm which well deserves to be set as the <HI>Preface</HI> of the Scripture, being the <HI>Encomi∣um,</HI> and indeed the <HI>Epitome</HI> of it all.</P>
<P>A <HI>Coherence,</HI> and so an <HI>Analysis,</HI> of the several Paragraphs in the Psalm, is not sollicitously to be sought: the Regard had unto the Order and Number of the <HI>Hebrew Letters,</HI> throughout the whole, giving us cause to look for a Cohaerence of <HI> Letters</HI> rather than of <HI>Matters</HI> in it; however in our Context there seems to be some Depen∣dence. We have here the Lovely <HI>David,</HI> that Eminent <HI>Servant</HI> and <HI>Souldier</HI> of the Lord, affer∣ting his own Integrity, against the Temptations of a <HI>Various Assault;</HI> an Assault both from <HI>Snares</HI> and <HI>Swords.</HI> He was Assaulted one while by <HI>Fraud;</HI> and as to the Temptations thereof he says, <HI>The Wicked have laid a Snare for me, yet I have not erred from thy Precepts.</HI> He was Assaulted another while by <HI>Force;</HI> &amp; as to the Temptations thereof, he says, <HI>My soul is continually in my Hands; yet I do not forget thy Law.</HI> Suppose this incomparable General, now skulking and scow∣ling about the <HI>Woods,</HI> in the Wilderness of <HI>Pa∣lestine;</HI> pursued like a <HI>Patridge,</HI> by that bloody Fowler <HI>Saul,</HI> with all his cruel <HI>setting Dogs</HI> a∣bout
<PB N="4" REF="000488_0012_0FA672F61CAD0C98"/>
him. Suppose him now in <HI>Arms,</HI> and <HI>thus Expressing</HI> of himself. Behold in our Text:</P>
<P>First, the <HI>Affliction</HI> of a great <HI>Souldier.</HI> 'Tis, <HI>my soul is continually in my Hand.</HI> By the <HI>Soul</HI> may be meant the <HI>Life,</HI> which does consist in a Vital Union between the <HI>Soul</HI> and the <HI>Body.</HI> But how may this be said to be. <HI>In the Hand? I</HI> remember <HI>Austin</HI> upon this place, confesses, he could not conceive what the psalmist meant. But <HI>Jerom</HI> hits the Nail, by noting that it is an <HI>Hebraism, Quo significatur vitam habere periculo Ex∣positam;</HI> signifying <HI>to go in Danger of ones Life.</HI> The <HI>Graecians</HI> have a Proverb, as well as the <HI>He∣brews</HI> to the same purpose; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> He hath his <HI>Soul</HI> in his <HI>Hand.</HI> To put it out of Doubt, that this is the Intent of the Psal∣mist here, we find it elsewhere, that when the <HI> Life</HI> of this very person had been obnoxious to an extraordinary Danger, 'tis thus deciphered in 1 Sam. 19. 5. <HI>He did put his Life in his Hand.</HI> And hence the never enough Regarded and Commended <HI>French</HI> Translation, so renders the passage, we are now upon, <HI>Ma Vie a este conti∣nuellement en Hazard;</HI> my <HI>Life</HI> has been conti∣nually in <HI>Hazard.</HI> A Souldier must continual∣ly look to be <HI>Hazarding</HI> of his <HI>Life.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly the <HI>Affection</HI> of a good <HI>Souldier.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Yet I do not forget thy Law.</HI> A Souldier must in∣deed <HI>Forget</HI> all things, but <HI>Gods Law,</HI> and his <HI>own Sword.</HI> For the <HI>Object</HI> which he is to be Affected with, 'tis <HI>Gods Law,</HI> That is one of the <HI>Ten
<PB N="5" REF="000488_0013_0FA672F707246650"/>
Words,</HI> one of which is used in almost every verse of this glorious Hymn, to denote, <HI>The ways and means by which the blessed God reveals His Will unto the Children of Men; and the Will it self revealed in those ways and means.</HI></P>
<P>And then for the <HI>Respect</HI> which he is to place upon this <HI>Object,</HI> it is, <HI>Not Forgetting.</HI> But we are to bear in mind, That according to the Received Rule of Expounding <HI>Scripture Phrases</HI> to <HI>Remember,</HI> denotes also, to <HI>Know,</HI> to <HI>Love,</HI> to <HI>Do.</HI> All <HI>That</HI> is intended here.</P>
<P>And hence the <HI>Doctrine</HI> here provided for you is,</P>
<P>That the Remembrance of Gods Law, is a Thing of no small Importance to them that have their<HI> Lives </HI>continually in their<HI> Hands.</HI></P>
<P>As the little <HI>Time</HI> given me for Preparation, will not allow me to be very <HI>Accurate</HI> and <HI>Perti∣nent</HI> in improving my present opportunity, which until too late yesterday I knew nothing of: so the little <HI>strength</HI> left me by the excessive <HI>La∣bours</HI> of this morning supervening upon the <HI> Languors</HI> of a late Illness, will not permit me to be <HI>long,</HI> in this Discourse; I have only two <HI>Propositions</HI> to entertain you with,</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="6" REF="000488_0014_0FA672F79A8FF128"/>
<HEAD>Proposition I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To have their</HI> Lives <HI>in their</HI> Hands, <HI>is a</HI> Condition <HI>which the Children of Men are liable unto.</HI></P>
<P>There is indeed a Threefold <HI>Condition</HI> which brings the <HI> Lives</HI> of Men into the <HI>Hands</HI> of Men, with a <HI>Gradual Descent</HI> from <HI>Generals</HI> to <HI>Specials,</HI> it may be set before you.</P>
<P>The first Condition of this kind, is, that of <HI>All Men:</HI> Accordingly our Observation is,</P>
<P N="1">1. Men have their <HI> Lives</HI> brought into their their <HI>Hands,</HI> in point of <HI>Mortality.</HI> Our <HI>Lives</HI> are come out from our <HI>Hearts</HI> unto our <HI>Hands;</HI> and they are in a sort ready to <HI>shake Hands</HI> with us. Our <HI> Lives</HI> do as it were take us by our <HI>Hands,</HI> and say, <HI>Well, I am going, Fare you well.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Lives</HI> are come into our <HI>Hands</HI> for the <HI>Brevity</HI> of them. Once indeed there was a <HI>Longevity</HI> in Fallen Man that seem'd almost Aemulous of that <HI>Immortality,</HI> which Upright man should have had experience of. The An∣tediluvian <HI>Patriarchs</HI> might have broke up Com∣pany, with probable Agreements to have met again in the same <HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Form</HI> an Hundred Years afterwards. But that <HI>LONG LIFE,</HI> is
<PB N="7" REF="000488_0015_0FA672FC9AE41C08"/>
by our <HI>Vice,</HI> and Gods <HI>Curse,</HI> now terribly Ab∣breviated. Our own <HI>Corruption</HI> has Enfeebled the principles of Life in our Successive Genera∣tions, and Gods just <HI>Malediction</HI> has confirm'd that <HI>Feebleness,</HI> whereby we <HI>Dy before our Time, for being wicked overmuch.</HI> The <HI>Sacred Law</HI> of God has now Abridged our Lives into <HI>Seventy Years,</HI> and the <HI>Common Law</HI> of Man, into <HI>Seve<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Our <HI>Lives</HI> are now IN our <HI>Hands,</HI> and we have not an <HI>Handful</HI> thereof. The psalmist could say in Psal. 39. 5. <HI>Behold, Thou hast made my Days as an Hands Breadth.</HI> In an <HI>Hands Breadth</HI> may be grasped the whole of the <HI> Lives</HI> which we have in our <HI>Hands.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Lives</HI> are likewise come into our <HI>Hands</HI> for the <HI>Uncertainty</HI> of them. What is in our <HI>Hands</HI> is <HI>Extra nos,</HI> 'tis uncertain whether we shall keep it or no. Our <HI>Lives</HI> are so in our <HI>Hands,</HI> that we know not whether they will stay with us. They may be wrested out of our <HI>Hands:</HI> and in a Turn of an <HI>Hand</HI> they are gone, before we are aware. 'Tis said in James 4. 14. <HI>What is your Life? It is even a vapour.</HI> It is as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Vapour,</HI> or a Candle, that we bear (not in <HI>Horns,</HI> but) in <HI>Hands.</HI> 'Tis liable to be Extinguished by every <HI>puff</HI> of Wind.</P>
<P>The Second Condition of this kind, is, that of <HI>Old Men.</HI> And so our Observation is,</P>
<P N="2">2. Men have their <HI> Lives</HI> brought into their <HI>Hands</HI> in point of <HI>Infirmity.</HI> Aged persons Lean with their <HI>Hands;</HI> and on their <HI>Staves</HI> they car∣ry
<PB N="8" REF="000488_0016_0FA672FD589AEF58"/>
their <HI> Lives.</HI> The <HI> Life</HI> may be put for the <HI>whole Man;</HI> with the <HI>Old Man</HI> 'tis come into the <HI>Hands;</HI> his <HI>Feet</HI> cannot now support him. 'Tis said of him in Eccles 12. 3. <HI>The strong men,</HI> (i. e. his Legs) <HI>bow themselves;</HI> and so the <HI>Trembling</HI> Hands must be the <HI>Keepers of the House.</HI> All the strength left him, and all his <HI> Life</HI> is in his <HI>Hands.</HI> He does all things with a <HI>Staff in Hand,</HI> and so with a <HI>Life in Hand;</HI> as 'tis noted of the Gray-headed and Decrepit <HI>Jacob,</HI> in Heb. 11. 21. <HI>He Worshipped, leaning on the Top of his Staff:</HI> When he rose off his Couch to worship God, he could not rise without a <HI>Staff;</HI> his <HI> Life</HI> was relieved and exerted mostly by his Aged palsey <HI>Hand.</HI></P>
<P> The third Condition of this kind, is that of <HI>Confessors,</HI> and that of <HI>Souldiers.</HI> And our Ob∣servation upon it is,</P>
<P N="3">3 Men have their <HI>Lives</HI> brought into their <HI>Hands</HI> in point of Danger to <HI>Loose their Lives.</HI></P>

We are sometimes to venture our <HI>Lives;</HI> and when we do so, We may say, as in 1 Sam 28. 21. <HI>behold I have put my Life in my Hand.</HI> That which is in our <HI>Hands,</HI> is easy to be <HI>Taken</HI> away; yea, What is ready to be <HI>Given</HI> 
<PB N="9" REF="000488_0017_0FA672FDB1211E30"/>
away, we take in our <HI>Hands.</HI> In both respects, our God often calls us to have our <HI>Lives</HI> in our <HI>Hands.</HI> We are sometimes to engage in those things, wherein 'tis but a <HI>Peradventure,</HI> whether we shall ever come off <HI>Alive.</HI> Yea, we are sometimes not only to <HI>Expose</HI> our <HI> Lives,</HI> but also to <HI>Resign</HI> them, and let them go out of our <HI> Hands,</HI> and pour them forth as a <HI>Drink-offering</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P>This is the case of <HI>Confessors.</HI> They Dy <HI>Of∣ten;</HI> they are as 'tis said in 2 Cor. 11. 23: <HI>In Deaths often.</HI> Yea, they Dy <HI>Daily;</HI> they can say as in 1 Cor. 15. 31. I <HI>Dy Daily.</HI> That is, They are <HI>Often,</HI> they are <HI>Daily</HI> in Danger in Dy∣ing; and so they have their <HI>Lives</HI> in their <HI>Hands.</HI> There is a Number of people in the World, who profess the Truths and Ways of God, and serve Him according to His Word. This people are a sort of <HI>Army,</HI> under the Colours and Com∣mands of the Lord Jesus Christ; but the <HI>Anci∣ent Legend</HI> (pardon me that I call it <HI>so</HI> ) of the <HI>Thebaean Legion</HI> is verifyed in the usage that they meet withal. They have so many <HI> Hands</HI> against them, that their <HI> Lives</HI> are in their <HI> Hands;</HI> and from that <HI>Flock of Slaughter,</HI> now one, and then another is made a prey to <HI>Wolvish</HI> Persecutors; before whose Rabid Violence, they say, <HI>Lord, For thy sake We are killed all the Day Long.</HI></P>
<P>And this is the case of <HI>Souldiers</HI> too. It was remarked by a notable man of that Character, in 2 Sam. 11. 25. <HI>The Sword Devoureth One as
<PB N="10" REF="000488_0018_0FA672FE656DF478"/>
Well as another.</HI> The Hebrews call <HI>War,</HI> by a Name that signifies, <HI>A Devourer.</HI> And Souldi∣ers carry in their <HI>Hands,</HI> what the Monster feeds upon; the <HI>Leviathan</HI> devours the <HI>Lives</HI> of them who do Encounter him. The <HI>Lives</HI> of Souldi∣ers are where their <HI>Arms</HI> are, even in their <HI>Hands;</HI> for they know not whether they shall return <HI>Alive,</HI> out of the Battels which they are push'd upon.</P>
<P>And it is for a double Reason that our God carves out such a condition for us.</P>
<P>First, It is to check our <HI>Worldly-mindedness:</HI> It was said unto that good man, in Jer. 45. 5. <HI>Seekest thou great things for thy self, seek them not; for—thy Life will I give unto thee for a prey.</HI> When our Life is for a <HI>prey,</HI> our Life is then in our <HI> Hand;</HI> we have it by a meer <HI>snatch</HI> as it were. This now prohibits our <HI>seeking of great things for our selves,</HI> in as much as we cannot secure to our selves the Enjoyment of <HI>That,</HI> which alone makes us capable of Enjoying all other Sublu∣nary Things. By bringing our <HI>Lives</HI> into our <HI>Hands,</HI> our Hands are knock'd away from too fast a gripe or grasp after Secular Objects. When our <HI> Life</HI> is in our <HI> Hand,</HI> God has a voice in His <HI>Month</HI> to this purpose, <HI>Dream not of mighty Things, no, nor of any Things in this Transitory World, until thou hast better Assurance of thy continuance here.</HI> The blessed God thus inviteth us, and obligeth us, to look after the glorious <HI>Crowns</HI> and <HI>Joyes</HI> in another World. He Inviteth us, and obli∣geth
<PB N="11" REF="000488_0019_0FA672FF1D04CD70"/>
us, <HI>To set our Affections upon the Things which are above;</HI> and, <HI>To Look at the Things which are not seen and are Eternal;</HI> and to make sure of an <HI> Hope in Christ,</HI> without which we see (when we have <HI> Life in Hand) our selves to be of all men most miserable.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; It is to cure our <HI>Creature-Confidence.</HI> It was said by the Apostle in 2 Cor. 1. 9. <HI>We had a Sentence of Death in our selves, that we should not trust in our selves, but in God, which raises the Dead.</HI> A Condemned Malefactor carries his <HI> Life</HI> in his <HI> Hand,</HI> from the Bar. We are sometimes in as perilous a Likelihood of <HI>Dying,</HI> as a condemned Malefactor; and we are hereby called upon to <HI>Trust</HI> in God alone for the Reversing and Repea∣ling of the <HI>Sentence.</HI> By having our <HI>Lives</HI> in our <HI>Hands,</HI> we are under a Necessity of Reliance upon God alone to keep them there. When we have our <HI>Life</HI> in our <HI> Hand,</HI> we have also that <HI>call</HI> in our <HI>Ear, Do not Lean upon any Temporal Visible Interest for the preservation of thy Life; let all thy Expectations be, as all thy Salvations are, from God alone.</HI> The Lord breaks down the Hedge on e∣very side of us, and we Ly open to Death every way: 'tis that we may reserve our <HI>Dependance</HI> for all support, and all succour, to be placed upon God alone; 'tis that we may learn the Song of him that returned with his <HI>Life</HI> in his <HI> Hand</HI> from the maw of the great <HI>Shark; Salvation is of the Lord.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The</HI> Direction <HI>proper for them that have their</HI> Lives <HI>in their</HI> Hands, <HI>is to Remember the Law of God.</HI></P>
<P>When you have considered a few <HI>Conclusions,</HI> your thoughts will rightly apprehend the Intent and Extent of this Assertion.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>Conclusion I.</HEAD>
<P>Their <HI>Memories</HI> being Fraighted aud Stored with Divine <HI>Truths,</HI> do marvellously assist those that have their <HI>Lives</HI> in their <HI>Hands.</HI></P>
<P>Our Souls have an admirable Faculty of lay∣ing up in themselves the <HI>Images</HI> of Things which have made their <HI>Impressions</HI> on us. This is our <HI>Memory.</HI> We have both a <HI>Retaining</HI> Me∣mory, which is more <HI>Sensitive</HI> and a <HI>Regaining</HI> Memory, which is more <HI>Rational:</HI> a Memory, that can both <HI>keep Safe</HI> and <HI>fetch Back</HI> what <HI>Idaeas</HI> we have been Entertained with. This <HI>Memory</HI> is a <HI>Treasury,</HI> to be replenished with such Things as the <HI> Law</HI> of God affords unto us. 'Tis Re∣quired in Prov. 3. 1. <HI>My Son forget not my Law.</HI> 'Tis Resolved in Psal. 119. 16. <HI>I will not Forget thy Word.</HI> The <HI> Law</HI> of God contains <HI>Command∣ments</HI> 
<PB N="13" REF="000488_0021_0FA673009B90D2E0"/>
every one of which are <HI> Holy, and Just, and Good;</HI> it contains <HI>Promises,</HI> every one of which are <HI>Great and Precious;</HI> it contains <HI>Threat∣nings,</HI> every one of which are <HI>Quick and Power∣ful</HI> and these are all to be Treasured up in our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> When they have been communica∣ted unto us, we are to take heed that, <HI>Menasseh,</HI> or <HI>Forgetfulness</HI> be not the Name of our Souls. The Distillations of Gods <HI> Law,</HI> like <HI>Manna,</HI> fall about our Tents from Day to Day: our Duty now is that in 2 Pet. 1. 15. <HI>To have these Things always in Remembrance;</HI> and Gods Law will not like <HI>Manna,</HI> corrupt, but rather swee∣ten, by being Reposited until <HI>To morrow.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> of our God is both <HI>Written</HI> and <HI>Preached</HI> among us: now 'tis declared in Heb. 2. 1. <HI>We ought to give earnest heed unto the Things, lest at any time we let them slip</HI> or, Lest we be like <HI>Leaky Vessels</HI> thereunto. The <HI>Truths,</HI> couched in the <HI>Law</HI> of God are to be like <HI>Nails</HI> fastned in our Souls; never to be removed, never to be displa∣ced. After we have been sitting under the Dispensations of Gods <HI>Law,</HI> He will ask of us, as in Heb. 12. 5. <HI>Have you forgotten the Exhorta∣tion?</HI> To which we should be able to Reply as the Psalmist of old, <HI>Lord, I have not forgotten thy Law.</HI> And hence we should Receive the Truths therein offered unto us, with that Affecti∣onate and Agreeable Ejaculation, <HI> Lord, keep it for ever in the Imagination of the Thought of my Heart!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000488_0022_0FA67303027C2B60"/>
Now those of you that carry your <HI>Lives</HI> in your <HI>Hands</HI> will have this peculiar Benefit, by having of Gods <HI> Laws</HI> thus in your <HI>Minds.</HI></P>
<P>First, your <HI>Memory</HI> will suggest <HI>Necessary</HI> Truths unto you. You cannot always come at those Ordinances, which are the <HI>Wells of Salva∣tion,</HI> being driven to wander in the Dry paths of a <HI>Solitary Wilderness.</HI> But your well-<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Memories will supply you with the <HI>words whereby you may be saved,</HI> &amp; bring a <HI>Little Sanctuary</HI> to you when you are Banished from the <HI>Great Ones.</HI> They will render you the <HI>Instructed Scribes</HI> which will not want Things <HI>Now</HI> and <HI>Old,</HI> for the Re∣past of your Souls in the Desert which you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ange forth into. <HI>Salvation</HI> was to come unto <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by your <HI>Hearing</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> were here; it may now come unto you by your <HI>Remembring;</HI> for the Apostle said, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 2. <HI>Ye are saved, if you keep in Memory, What I Preached unto you.</HI></P>
<P>And, Secondly, Your <HI>Memories</HI> will suggest <HI>Seasonable</HI> Truths unto you. You are going into a Warfare, wherein you will often have occasi∣on for some <HI>Advice</HI> from God. While you were among us, you could seldom labour under any Doubt, or Snare, but you would have it met withal, in the Ordinances, that you consci∣entiously repair'd unto; you might say with him, I <HI>went into the Sanctuary of God, then I un∣derstood.</HI> But your <HI>Memories</HI> must now be your <HI>Monitors;</HI> if they be not <HI>Empty,</HI> they will not
<PB N="15" REF="000488_0023_0FA67303A6752378"/>
be <HI>Silent.</HI> It was said by some that were hurri∣ed away from the place where the Institutions of the most High did use to be maintained, in Lam. 3. 21. <HI>I Recal to mind, therefore I have Hope.</HI> So you may quickly have cause to say, <HI>I Recal to mind, and I have Life;</HI> and, <HI>I Recal to mind, and I have light;</HI> and, I <HI>Recal to mind, and I know what I have to do.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Conclusion 2.</HEAD>
<P>'Tis a <HI>Practical Remembrance</HI> of Divine Truths, which they that have their <HI>Lives</HI> in their <HI>Hands</HI> are to be most concerned for. Let <HI>Remembring</HI> and <HI>Practising</HI> go <HI>Hand in Hand,</HI> since you have your <HI>Life</HI> in your <HI>Hand.</HI> It is said in Numb. 15. 39. <HI>Remember all the Commandments of the Lord, and Do them.</HI> Behold, God has joined these two, and <HI>what God has join'd Let no man put asunder.</HI> The <HI>Best Remembrance</HI> is that which produces <HI>Repentance.</HI> 'Twas said, in Matth. 26. 75. Pe∣ter <HI>Remembred the words of the Lord Jesus; and he went out and wept bitterly.</HI> Thus we should so <HI>Remember the</HI> Law of God, as to <HI>weep</HI> for all our Violations of it; <HI>weep</HI> and Mourn and Bleed at the Thoughts of our own Unanswe∣rableness thereunto. And, The Best <HI>Remem∣brance</HI> is that which produces <HI>Obedience.</HI> 'Twas said, in Psal. 22. 27. <HI>They shall Remember, and Turn unto the Lord.</HI> Thus we should so <HI>Remem∣ber</HI> the Law of God, as to <HI>Turn</HI> from all our
<PB N="16" REF="000488_0024_0FA6730465EC9A58"/>
own Behaviours that are contrary thereunto to <HI>Turn</HI> from all Sin to God in Christ for ever. A little of this <HI>Remembring</HI> will go further than the Largest and Longest <HI>Repetition</HI> else. A Pious Person being asked, <HI>What do you Re∣member of the last Sermon?</HI> Reply'd <HI>I don't Remember much; but so much</HI> I <HI>do Remember that I shall En∣deavour to mend a miscarriage that the Sermon con∣vinc'd me of.</HI> That was <HI>Well</HI> Remembred! Tho' your Memories may serve you like a <HI>Sieve</HI> that seem'd full while it was in the Water, but has nothing in it, immediately on its Taking out; yet therein however let them be like the <HI>Sieve,</HI> that they shall be made <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>clean</HI> by the <HI>Waters of Life</HI> that are passing thorough them. This is the <HI>Remembrance</HI> which you are to be most ambitious of.</P>

<P>Our having our <HI>Lives</HI> in our <HI>Hands</HI> ought not to Affright us from any thing that the <HI> Law</HI> of God makes incumbent on us.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> is, I suppose, the principal Intendment of the Psalmist here; <HI>q. d.</HI> Tho' I have my <HI> Life</HI> in my <HI>Hand,</HI> yet I will do no Indirect Thing, to keep it there.

You should have no more <HI>Carnal</HI> Joyes and Griefs, no more <HI>Carnal</HI> Hopes and Fears, then a man whose <HI> Life</HI> is going out at his <HI>Hands</HI> Gratify not any <HI>Enemy,</HI> by a <HI>Sinful Compliance,</HI> to Escape Danger; for God can <HI>Re∣strain</HI> your <HI>Adversary.</HI> 'Tis said in Proverb 16. 7. <HI>When a mans ways please the Lord, his Enemies shall be at peace with him.</HI> Oftentimes to prevent mis∣chiefs from <HI>Enemies</HI> our Way does <HI>Displease</HI> the Lord: but we then take a <HI>Wrong Way!</HI> God can make <HI>Pharoah</HI> afraid of <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI> afraid of <HI>John.</HI> The Lord has <HI>Hornets</HI> to buz and sting Terrors into those whom we may be too much terrified withal.

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>Conclusion 4.</HEAD>
<P>Some people that have their <HI>Lives</HI> in their <HI>Hands,</HI> are more prone to <HI>Forget the Law of God,</HI> then others that undergo less Dangers are. This may seem an Intimation, or Insinuation of the Psalmist here; <HI>q. d. I</HI> been't like other people who carry their <HI>Lives</HI> in their <HI>Hands.</HI> I extream∣ly <HI>Value</HI> the <HI> Law,</HI> which they commonly <HI>Forget.</HI> 'Tis very <HI>strange,</HI> and very <HI>sad;</HI> but also very <HI>True;</HI> That there is often <HI>least Grace</HI> in the <HI> Hearts</HI> of those that most have their <HI> Life</HI> in their <HI>Hands.</HI> How it comes to pass, I don't know; but so it is, That they whose <HI>nearest</HI> and <HI>oftnest</HI> Approaches unto <HI>Eternity</HI> should awaken them to be the <HI>Best</HI> People in the World, are frequently the <HI>worst</HI> of all.</P>
<P>We see it in <HI>Sailors</HI> and in <HI>Souldiers.</HI> As for them that follow the <HI>Sea,</HI> 'tis said of them, in Psal. 107. 22. <HI>They Reel to and fro, and Stagger like a Drunken Man; and are at their Wits Ends.</HI> 
<PB N="19" REF="000488_0027_0FA6730A301D8140"/>
Thus 'tis with them in regard of <HI>Storm;</HI> and when that is over, 'tis <HI>thus</HI> again with them in regard of <HI>Sin</HI> too; even after they come a Shore, still (and upon a sadder Account) they will many of them <HI>Reel to and fro, and Stagger,</HI> not <HI>like a Drunken man;</HI> but thro' <HI>being</HI> really so. They make deeper Descents towards Hell by their <HI>Vice</HI> than in their <HI>Ship;</HI> and no <HI>Sea-sickness</HI> will turn into a <HI>Sin sickness</HI> with them. Tho they may <HI>pray</HI> in a Tempest, how horribly will they <HI>Swear</HI> and <HI>Curse,</HI> and how filthily will they <HI>Talk,</HI> when they are out of their Amazements! It has been doubled, Whether they were to be reckon∣ed among the <HI>Living</HI> or the <HI>Dead.</HI> But the sense of this keeps <HI>few</HI> of them, from those Remar∣kable Extravagancies; which quickly plunge them down into the Congregation of those that <HI>Roar under the Waters for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>And as for them that follow the <HI>Field,</HI> For∣give the plain Dealing, my Fellow-Souldiers, if <HI>I</HI> tell you, That <HI>Wickedness,</HI> Impiety, Profanity, is one of the Things that has made <HI>their</HI> Cha∣racter <HI>Extraordinary</HI> in the World. <HI>Their</HI> Names are up, for an Acquaintance with an Excess of Rudeness and Lewdness, and all manner of <HI>Debauchery.</HI> How rarely have Armies been the <HI>Schools</HI> of true Vertue and Honour? but not ra∣ther the Nurseries of all those Abominations, that would render the lowest <HI> Hell</HI> Visible and Incarnate here. It was complained in Psal. 119. 6. <HI>The Bands of the Wicked have Robbed me.</HI> How

<P>That <HI>Armies,</HI> have but few <HI>Christians</HI> in them. We say, That <HI> Laws</HI> are not Heard, where <HI>Arms</HI> are Clashing. Alas, no <HI> Laws</HI> are so much drown∣ed and slighted there, as the <HI> Laws</HI> of the <HI> Holy One of Israel.</HI></P>

Esteem, that I look upon you, my good Friends and Neighbours; as many of you as have given cause for that Acknowledgment of you, in Judge 5. 2. <HI>Praise the Lord, for the people willingly offered themselves:</HI> and while I am touch'd with an <HI>Am∣bition to Assist</HI> you (I might have said, to <HI>Accom∣pany</HI> you) in your present Expedition, I cannot find a fitter way to do it, than by giving you that part of a Sermon, which your worthy Com∣mander has asked for you. You may say like that Souldier, in Judg. 12. 2. I <HI>put my Life in my Hands, and passed over against the Children of Am∣mon:</HI> God grant you may quickly say the rest▪ <HI>And the Lord delivered them into my Hand.</HI> That you may Happily and Cheerfully go on, with what you have <HI>in Hand,</HI> a few <HI>Counsils,</HI> a few <HI>Cordials,</HI> and a few <HI>Blessings,</HI> are to make up the Remainder of our present Exercise.</P>

<P>By way of <HI>Counsil,</HI> give me leave to say,</P>
<P>First, Be sensible that you go forth with your Souls, as well as your <HI>Lives</HI> in your <HI>Hands.</HI> That word, <HI>A Soul, A Soul!</HI> methinks it sounds bigger than a <HI>World.</HI> A Precious and an Im∣mortal <HI>Soul;</HI> O 'tis too big a Thing to be thrown away. Think, That you have every one of you, a <HI>Soul,</HI> which is a <HI>Jewel</HI> too valuable to be <HI>Despised:</HI> he is a <HI>Fool</HI> indeed, of whom it may be said, <HI>He Despises his own Soul.</HI> Now you are going forth against <HI>Indians</HI> with your <HI>Souls</HI> in
<PB N="24" REF="000488_0032_0FA6730FA33B68C0"/>
your <HI>Hands,</HI> pray, be apprehensive that you should not make <HI>Indian-Bargains</HI> about those In∣estimable <HI>Souls.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> would sell to the <HI>Europeans</HI> at their first Arrival in the Southern Regions, the best Jewels, and Metals, for a few <HI>Glass-beads.</HI> Let your Thoughts be, that you have <HI>Souls</HI> not to be so basely <HI>Truckt</HI> away; <HI>Souls</HI> not to be Sold for <HI>Songs,</HI> whatever the <HI>Flesh,</HI> the <HI>World,</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI> may <HI>sing</HI> unto you. It is wholsome Advice, in Prov. 4. 20. <HI>Keep thy Soul with all Diligence.</HI> Consider, <HI>That</HI> you, have <HI>Souls,</HI> which will stand like <HI>Rocks</HI> in the Sea of Eterni∣ty for ever; and O Consider, <HI>What</HI> will become of them <HI>Souls,</HI> if they be not <HI>New-born</HI> before their Departure hence. There was a profane <HI>Souldier,</HI> who on One side of his Sword, had a Shape of a <HI>God,</HI> on the other side the Picture of the <HI>Devil,</HI> With this Motto under it, <HI>Si tu non <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, iste rogitat;</HI> If He won't have me, here's <HI>One</HI> will. Hideous Monster! But this <HI>Disjuncti∣on</HI> is too certain and Awful a Thing to be play'd withal.

I beseech you, be not <HI>prodiga Gens Animi,</HI> or unaffected with the <HI>Worth</HI> and the <HI>State,</HI> of your own <HI>Souls.</HI> No, Take the <HI>First Opportunity</HI> to confess and bewayl your many <HI>Sins,</HI> with a sincere purpose, <HI>I will not offend any

more.</HI> Take the <HI>First Opportunity</HI> to Accept and Embrace all the <HI>Sure Mercies</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, with a gracious Promise, <HI>Lord, I will now be thy Servant Devoted to thy Fear.</HI> You must <HI>quickly,</HI> and you should <HI>boldly,</HI> look <HI>Death</HI> in the Face, with your <HI>Souls</HI> in your <HI>Hands;</HI> in order thereunto, Let me utter that proper word of Command, <HI>Make Ready!</HI> I say, <HI>Make Ready!</HI> Get out of your unrenewed Estate, and <HI>Make Ready,</HI> that at the first Alarum e're long, you may have nothing to Do, but, <HI>Fight and Dy.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Let them be none but Pure-hands in which you carry your <HI>Lives.</HI> We read in Isa. 1. 15. <HI>When you spread forth your Hands, I will bide mine eyes from you; for your Hands are full of Blood.</HI> Even so, there are <HI>Hands full of Luxury,</HI> there are <HI>Hands full of Injustice;</HI> but those <HI>Hands</HI> are not <HI>clean</HI> enough for your <HI>Lives</HI> to be carried in them. Wherefore as 'tis said, in James 4. 8. <HI>Cleanse your Hands, re Sinners:</HI> Let me call upon you, <HI>Cleanse your Hands, ye Souldiers.</HI> Let there be no Uncleanness, no Disorder found in your <HI>Hands.</HI> Endeavour to have a <HI>pure Camp;</HI> and be <HI>Like the Host of God.</HI> We read sometimes of a <HI>Church</HI> in an <HI>House;</HI> Why should you not as well study a <HI>Church</HI> in a <HI>Camp?</HI> Keep your <HI>Camp</HI> as free from Swearing, Drinking, Gaming, Riot∣ing, and Sabbath-keeping, as any <HI>Church</HI> in the World; and let God be worshipped in your <HI>Camp</HI> as frequently, as Devoutly as in a <HI>Church</HI> This, <HI>this</HI> will render you <HI>Terrible as an Army

with Banners.</HI> You may have <HI>Military Valour.</HI> enough to conquer an <HI>Indian;</HI> but you must also have <HI>Christian Valour</HI> to subdue a <HI> Lust.</HI> When <HI>Peter</HI> had Armed people round about him, how nimbly, how stoutly did he draw upon them! but presently after a sorry Damosel made him give way to that which <HI>Broke all his Bones</HI> O be so Valiant, as to put out of your <HI>Hands,</HI> all that may not be Convenient for the <HI>Lives</HI> which you carry there.</P>
<P>Thirdly. While you have your <HI>Lives</HI> in your <HI>Hands, L</HI> et your Ends in your <HI>Eyes</HI> be such as they ought to be. Be not acted by <HI>Lucre,</HI> by <HI>Revenge,</HI> by any sorry or Dirty Principles in your present Undertaking but be acted by a sin∣cere Desire to Defend the people of God, from a crew of <HI>Unjust Men,</HI> that are <HI>skilful to Destroy,</HI> 'Tis said, in 1 Cor. 10. 31. <HI>Whatever you Do, Do all to the Glory of God.</HI> Even in the meanest Ac∣tions; the <HI>Glory of God</HI> is to be the <HI>Star</HI> to Guide us, the <HI>Spur</HI> to move us. A Godly Man, among our first Planters here, while he was cutting of Wood, being asked, <HI>Who</HI> it was for? answered, I <HI>am Cutting of Wood for God.</HI> If in <HI>Cutting</HI> of Wood, much more in <HI>Killing</HI> of Men, you should be able to say, <HI>I am at work for God.</HI> Be not the <HI>Souldiers of Fortune,</HI> as they are called; but be the <HI>Souldiers of Jesus;</HI> and let the Account that you may give of your Concerns be this, <HI>I would do all I can, that the Churches of God may have Rest, and that therefore those may be cut off, who Trouble

<P>Fourthly, Don't part with your <HI>Lives</HI> out of your <HI>Hands,</HI> without such Demonstrations of Courage as may Confound your Adversaries. Let it not be said at your Death, He <HI>Dyed as a Fool Dyes,</HI> Have <HI> Life</HI> in your <HI>Hands,</HI> while you have <HI>Lives</HI> in your <HI>Hands;</HI> and let them be <HI>Live∣ly Hands</HI> too, in which you carry your <HI>Lives:</HI> To run from a <HI>Press,</HI> is a thing not so generous; and the speedy Rebukes of Heaven, have been Conspicuously Dispens'd unto some that have done it here. But to Run from a <HI>Fight,</HI> is a thing too Cowardly sure for any <HI>New-Englander</HI> to be guilty of it! Let me Exhort you, in the words of that Famous General, 2 Sam. 10. 12. <HI>Be of good Courage, and let us play the men, for our people, and for the Cities of our God, and the Lord do that which may seem good unto Him.</HI> When the Day of Battel comes, then (to speak Apo∣stolically) <HI>Quit you like men, be strong.</HI> It is the Glory of the <HI>Horse,</HI> and much more is it for the <HI>Souldier,</HI> his Rider, <HI>So,</HI> then to <HI>mock at Fear,</HI> and <HI>not be affrighted</HI> nor <HI>turn back from the Sword;</HI> but to go on Rejoycing to <HI>meet the Ar∣med Men.</HI> Your Enemies have made themselves notorious for this Quality, That as <HI>Difficilius est invenire quam vincere,</HI> it is easier to <HI>kill</HI> them than to find them; so they can rarely Take any but
<PB N="28" REF="000488_0036_0FA67314350D15D0"/>
a shaking Trembling Aim at one that boldly fa∣ces them. <HI>Face</HI> them then, and when you do it, imagine you have that voice from Heaven sounding in your Ears; Josh. 1. 9. <HI>Have not I commanded thee:</HI> [such a Commander have you!] <HI>Be strong, and of a good Courage; Be not af∣fraid, neither be thou Dismay'd; for the Lord thy God is with thee, whithersoever thou goest.</HI> At the first Appearance of the Tawny Pagans, then <HI>Courage!</HI> bray Hearts: <HI>Fall on!</HI> Fall on Couragiously, with that Assurance in Psal. 3. 6, 7. <HI>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people that have set themselves against me. O my God, thou hast smitten all mine Enemies.</HI> Yea, when once you have but got the Track of those Ravenous how∣ling <HI>Wolves</HI> then pursue them vigorously; <HI>Turn not back</HI> till they are <HI>consumed: Wound</HI> them that they shall not be <HI>able to Arise;</HI> Tho' they <HI>Cry;</HI> Let there be none to <HI>Save them;</HI> But <HI>Beat</HI> them small as the <HI>Dust before the Wind,</HI> and <HI>Cast them out,</HI> as the <HI>Dirt in the Streets.</HI> Let not the Expres∣sion seem Harsh, if I say unto you, <HI>Sacrifice them to the Ghosts of the Christians whom they have Mur∣dered.</HI> They have horribly Murdered some scores of your dear Country-men, whose Blood cries in your Ears, while you are going to Fight, <HI>Vengeance, Dear Country-men! Vengeance upon our Murderers.</HI> Let your <HI>Courage,</HI> in the Name of God be daring enough to Execute that <HI>Vengeance</HI> on them.</P>
<P>But what <HI>Cordial</HI> shall I procure, which may

inspire you with such a <HI>Valour?</HI> Let me set before you, a few Thoughts which may raise your Spi∣rits to an Elevation, beyond what the Rattling Noises of any <HI>Drums</HI> or <HI>Trumpets</HI> can fetch them to.</P>

<P>Wherefore, First, Know that your Quarrel is <HI>Just.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Call</HI> and <HI>Press</HI> of your Su∣periours; is enough to justify <HI>you</HI> in doing of <HI>your</HI> part, for prosecuting of the <HI>War.</HI> If the injust∣ice of a War be notoriously Evident and Appa∣rent, Judicious Casuists then determine, that e∣very <HI>private Souldier</HI> is to declare his own Dissatis∣faction, and render himself rather <HI>Passive</HI> than <HI>Active</HI> in it, and <HI>Suffer,</HI> sooner than <HI>Engage;</HI> like <HI>Souls</HI> Footmen, when bidden to fall upon <HI>the Priests of the Lord.</HI> But where a War is not thus evidently and apparently <HI>unjust,</HI> the <HI>private Souldier</HI> must use an Implicit Reliance on the Command of the <HI>Supream Power: They</HI> must an∣swer for it.</P>
<P>☞ Besides <HI>this;</HI> Your <HI>Superiours</HI> themselves have also enough and enough to justify <HI>Them,</HI> in pushing on the present War, with the utmost <HI>Expedition</HI> and <HI>Extremity.</HI> Such were the <HI>obscure measures</HI> taken at that time of Day, that the <HI>Rise</HI> of this War, hath been as dark as that of the River <HI>Nilus;</HI> only the Generality of <HI>Thinking people</HI> thro the Country, can remember <HI>when</HI> and <HI>why</HI> every one did foretel, <HI>A War.</HI> If any <HI>wild English</HI> (for there are <HI>such</HI> as well as of another Nation) did then, <HI>begin</HI> to provoke and Affront the <HI>Indians,</HI>

yet those <HI>Indians</HI> had a fairer way to come by Right, than that of <HI>Blood-shed;</HI> nothing worthy of, or calling for any <HI>such</HI> Revenge was done un∣to them. The most <HI>injured</HI> among them all, (if there were any <HI>such</HI> ) were afterwards dismissed by the <HI>English,</HI> with <HI>Favours</HI> that were then ad∣mirable even to <HI>our selves;</HI> and <HI>These</HI> too, instead of surrendring the <HI>persons,</HI> did (as we are credi∣bly informed) increase the <HI>Numbers,</HI> of the <HI>Murderers.</HI> But upon the Revolution of the <HI>Government,</HI> the State of the War, became wholly <HI>New;</HI> and we are more arriv'd unto <HI>Righteousness as the Light,</HI> and <HI>Justice as the Noon Day.</HI> When the <HI>Helm</HI> of this little Vessel was taken out of the Hands of those whose palpable Enmity to the Glorious Designs of His Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> added unto the innumera∣ble <HI>Oppressions</HI> and <HI>Vexations</HI> which we had sustai∣ned under them, had made us as <HI>Suspicious</HI> as we were <HI>Ignorant,</HI> what <HI>Port</HI> they intended for; we <HI>then</HI> found our selves actually Entangled in a <HI>War.</HI> A Great <HI>Sachim</HI> of the East, we then im∣mediately applyed our selves unto, and with no small Expences to our selves, we Engaged <HI>Him,</HI> to Employ his Interest for a good understanding between us and the Party of Indians then in Hostility against us. <HI>This</HI> was the <HI>Likely,</HI> the <HI>Only</HI> Way, of coming at those Wandring Salvages; But that very <HI>Sachim</HI> now treacherously (by whose <HI>Advice,</HI> I know not) of an <HI>Embassador</HI> became a <HI>Traytor,</HI> and annexed himself with his

What can be now said, by any Rational man, against the proceed∣ing of the <HI>War?</HI> Shall we permit the whole Province of <HI>Main</HI> to be over-run by the <HI>Indians</HI> (and their <HI>Abettors</HI> ) because the <HI>Manners</HI> of some people there please us not? But how can we answer <HI>this</HI> unto Their <HI>Majesties?</HI> or, are we <HI>Rich</HI> enough to Loose without Regret, the Best part of the <HI>New-English</HI> Trade? And are we so fond, so mad, as to imagine that the <HI>Indians</HI> will stop <HI>there?</HI> No, they have <HI>already</HI> made their Incursions into <HI>Piscataqua</HI> and in the <HI>Massachusets</HI> too have they been shedding Blood. Certainly, my Countrymen; 'Tis Time to Look about us, We are driven upon a <HI>purely Defensive War,</HI> which we may now make <HI>Justly Offensive</HI> to the first Aggressors in it. If you now ask, as he in Job 13. 14. <HI>Wherefore do I put my Life in my Hand?</HI> Behold, there is <HI>at Hand</HI> an Answer for you. 'Tis

Because a combination of <HI> Ill Men</HI> (if such <HI>Beasts</HI> may be called <HI>Men</HI> ) have, <HI>without any cause</HI> As∣signed by <HI>Them,</HI> or Afforded by <HI>us,</HI> been shed∣ding the Blood of our <HI>Neighbours,</HI> whom we are <HI>to Love as our selves;</HI> and whose <HI>Death</HI> is Design∣ed by those Execrable Cannibals, but as a <HI>Break∣fast,</HI> or a <HI>Prologue,</HI> to praecede <HI>our own.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Know that your Service is <HI>Good</HI> You are Fighting for the Defence and Suc∣cour of the Blessed <HI>Thrones</HI> which our <HI>David,</HI> our Jesus has here Erected for himself. 'Tis <HI>Christo Duce &amp; Auspice Christo,</HI> 'tis <HI>for</HI> Christ, and <HI>with</HI> Christ, that you are concerned.

'Twas said, in 1.

You are Fighting, that the <HI>Churches</HI> of God may not be Extinguisht, and the <HI>Wigwams</HI> of Heathen swar∣ming in their room: You are Fighting that the <HI>Children</HI> of God may not be made <HI>Meals</HI> or

<P>Thirdly, Know that your helper is <HI>Great.</HI> You will be <HI>Too many</HI> for your Adversaries; in∣as much as, you have with you, the <HI> Hosts of the Lord;</HI> the very <HI>Angels</HI> are your Companions in your present Enterprize. An <HI>Angel</HI> said once to an Apostle, <HI>I am thy Fellow-Servant;</HI> and many an <HI>Angel</HI> does now say to you, <HI>I am your Fellow∣Souldier.</HI> 'Tis mentioned as the Employment of the <HI>Angels,</HI> in Cant. 3. 7, 8. <HI>Behold, His Bed, which is</HI> Solomons; <HI>the Valiant are about it; they all hold Swords, being Expert in War; because of Fear in the Night.</HI> It is <HI>your</HI> Employment also; thus <HI>you</HI> stand about this <HI>Bed,</HI> this <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord Jesus, and the <HI>Angels</HI> are with you in it. But what cannot one <HI>Angel</HI> do? An Army of an <HI>Hundred Fourscore Five Thousand</HI> cannot stand be∣fore Him.

of his wicked <HI>Children;</HI> whose <HI>Dayes</HI> we may therefore think, shall not be <HI>Long in the Land.</HI> Indeed, They have none to Assist them, but the worst <HI>Auxiliaries</HI> in the World; the <HI>Divels</HI> and the <HI>Papists.</HI> The <HI>Divels</HI> have a great Hand in Exciting and Supporting of them; and hence the last Winter, from the mouth of a possessed Child among us <HI>They</HI> gave (I think) a very broad Notice of the Slaughters which the <HI>Summer</HI> would produce. That <HI>These</HI> have had a <HI> Long,</HI> and an <HI>Old </HI> Iinterest in <HI>America</HI> cannot be reasonably questioned by them that shall read what was written even before the Birth of our Saviour, by <HI>Diodorus Sicul<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, In very Ancient Times</HI> says he, <HI>the Phenicians tossed with Storms, after many days, ar∣rived unto this Vast Island</HI> (as he calls it) <HI>which then had stately Buildings in it.</HI> Hither the <HI>Divels</HI> did seduce a wretched party of Mankind, that they might have them out of the Gospels Way when it spred thro' the <HI>Old World,</HI> by the Mi∣nistry of the Apostles; and here they have Reigned as <HI>Kings,</HI> as <HI>Gods,</HI> without control, over millions of people for Ages not a few. It has given a terrible Alarum to them, that the <HI> Silver Trumpets</HI> of the Gospel, are now at length soun∣ding in their Territories, and it puts them into a Flaming Rage, that the <HI>Way to Salvation by Je∣sus Christ,</HI> is proclaimed here. Many are the <HI>Wiles</HI> which they have used, for the Discourage∣ment of these <HI>Notable Beginnings</HI> in which our Lord Jesus is taking the <HI>utmost parts of the Earth

for his Possession.</HI> Hence 'tis, that their <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssais,</HI> who have more than once been disquieting of us in our <HI>Proper∣ties</HI> and <HI>Possessions;</HI> now have also taken Arms again to make us miserable. But as these Attempts and Attacques of Hell upon us, have been all Abortive heretofore, so we may Apprehend that they will still miscarry. The Barba∣rians may (as 'tis by Escaped Captives reported that they <HI>have</HI> ) by their Diabolical <HI>Charms,</HI> keep our <HI>Dogs</HI> from Hurting of them, but they shall not so keep our <HI>Swords</HI> from coming at them. <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> among us, hath wonderfully made the <HI>Divels</HI> themselves to fly before it; so shall <HI> These</HI> too find unto their Cost. Tho' the <HI> Papists</HI> may likewise contribute what Help they can unto these Miscre∣ants and say <HI>Mass</HI> with them (as of Late) after their Lit∣tle Victories, yet we need not be disanimated; but <HI>the ra∣ther</HI> from thence prognosticate their Approaching Ruine. For we too much Distrust our own Observation, if we do not now think, that the whole <HI>Papal Expire,</HI> (which was of late replanting a <HI> Tabernacle</HI> in the <HI>Glorious Holy, Moun∣tain between the Seas</HI> ) is very near its <HI>En<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> when <HI>none shall help it;</HI> and that the <HI>twelve Hundred and sixty Years,</HI> during which the people of God, were to be harrassed by it, are not far from their Expiration. In a word, you may go forth with such a Triumph as that in Psal. 20. 7, 8: <HI>Some Trust in Chariots, and some in Horses</HI> (some in<HI> Satan,</HI> and some in <HI>Antichrist) But wee will Remember the Name of the Lord our God. They are brought down and fallen; but wee are Risen and stand Upright.</HI></P>
<P>And for a close, Let me mind you, that while you <HI>Fight,</HI> Wee'l <HI>pray.</HI> Every good man will do it, in <HI>secret</HI> and in <HI>private</HI> every day; and <HI>publick</HI> Supplications also will be al∣ways going for you. We will keep in the <HI>Mount</HI> with <HI>our Hands lifted up,</HI> while you are in the <HI>Field</HI> with your <HI>Lives</HI> in your <HI>Hands,</HI> against the <HI>Amalek</HI> that is now annoy∣ing this <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness. It was the <HI>Watch Word</HI> which a Battel once Commenc'd withal <HI>Now for the Fruit of Prayer! Now for the Fruit of Prayer.</HI> To gather that <HI>Fruit</HI> will be your Errand into the Thickets of our <HI> Scythian Desarts.</HI></P>

<P>We wish, That your Enemies may not have their <HI>Lives</HI> in <HI>their Hands,</HI> but in <HI>Gods Slings;</HI> and that God would <HI> Sling them out, as out of the middle of a Sling:</HI> While <HI>you</HI> that have your <HI>Lives</HI> in your <HI>Hands,</HI> may have <HI>your Souls bound up in the Bundle of Life.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, we wish That your Heads may bee Covered in the <HI>Day of Battle;</HI> that you may by the Almighty God bee made the <HI>Liberatores Partie,</HI> the <HI>Saviours</HI> of your Countrey; and that if any of you must Breath your last in the High places of the Field, your <HI> Souls</HI> may bee Re∣ceived by Him, that has <HI>Armies in Heaven, Clothed in fine Linen, White and Clean.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis with these <HI>Wishes,</HI> that wee <HI>Bless</HI> you in the Name of the Eternal God; and the Whole Congregation will say, <HI>AMEN, AMEN!</HI></P>
