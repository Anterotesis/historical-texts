<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author has thought proper to form this poem into a dialogue, as it furnished an opportunity of displaying, with more perspicuity, the natural gasconading arrogance of France, and the just retort and manly independence of her opponents. He likewise considered the Hudibrastic measure best adapted for interspersing that requisite burlesque which the subject required: how near he has come to the celebrated Butler, or whether he has had him at all in view, is left to the ad∣mirers of that author to decide.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>QUARRELS arise we know not why,</L>
<L>Yet they exist we can't deny,</L>
<L>Different in habit and in feature,</L>
<L>Some private, some of public nature.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The ladies jar at every meal,</L>
<L>They think it witty and genteel;</L>
<L>To backbite and to scandalize</L>
<L>Is charming in the fair ones' eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The nymph will quarrel with her swain,</L>
<L>Because she knows 'twill give him pain;</L>
<L>She's so tenacious of her lover,</L>
<L>He must not look at any other;</L>
<L>Thus are we trammel'd when we court,</L>
<L>And made the butt of woman's sport:</L>
<L>And ask the damsel why she teazes?</L>
<L>Most like she'll say, because she pleases,</L>
<L>It is her fancy to perplex him,</L>
<L>The more she loves, the more she'll vex him,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="033526_0004_0FF774F7F9F5C4C0"/>
Will ne'er desist nor give him quarter,</L>
<L>But keep him always in hot water,</L>
<L>Until she's gain'd him and his riches,</L>
<L>And then perhaps she'll wear the breeches.</L>
<L>The sex, alas! tho' fam'd for beauty,</L>
<L>Think contradiction is their duty;</L>
<L>But we must yield and seldom flout them,</L>
<L>Because we cannot live without them.</L>
<L>Yet man is frail as well as woman,</L>
<L>Tho' 'tis not always quite so common.</L>
<L>Some think their love cannot be zealous,</L>
<L>If of their wives they are not jealous,</L>
<L>When they most likely are the reason,</L>
<L>For acts of matrimonial treason.</L>
<L>T' avenge an insult to his jewel,</L>
<L>He must of course provoke a duel;</L>
<L>And should he 'scape this bold affray,</L>
<L>And "live to fight another day,"</L>
<L>He only lives to see his spouse</L>
<L>Gallant with others and carouse,</L>
<L>To feel each morn his horns a sprouting,</L>
<L>Which must be <HI>pleasant</HI> past all doubting.</L>
<L>But these are jars in private station,</L>
<L>A mortal stab to reputation,</L>
<L>A kind of murder in the retail,</L>
<L>Of which there is a lengthy detail.</L>
<L>But public feuds should widely alter,</L>
<L>And no man should by wholesale slaughter.</L>

Men are not mushrooms—by this light!</L>
<L>Nor can we get an army in a night.</L>
<L>King Solomon the wise, we're told,</L>
<L>Had children e'en an hundred fold;</L>
<L>But then t' account for all these lives,</L>
<L>He had an army form'd of wives:</L>
<L>The case is alter'd now you know,</L>
<L>We dare not even marry two.</L>
<L>This maxim therefore I'll propose,</L>
<L>Before two nations come to blows,</L>
<L>To have a proper explanation,</L>
<L>And cooly weigh the disputation.</L>

<L>COME, come, messieurs, you must advance,</L>
<L>Consider now the strength of France;</L>
<L>They have your interest in view,</L>
<L>And only act as <HI>friends</HI> to you.</L>
<L>You've made a fine elab'rate speech,</L>
<L>Yet seem'd to've soar'd above your reach;</L>
<L>Reflect a little, and beware,</L>
<L>There is no foothold in the air;</L>
<L>Mind that yourselves you don't enthrall,</L>
<L>Perchance you may receive a fall,</L>
<L>A fall perhaps you will deplore,</L>
<L>As you may never rise no more.</L>
<L>France she entreats with eyes brim full;</L>
<L>You'd view the state of poor John Bull;</L>
<L>How he must meet our rage and fury,</L>
<L>And very soon, I do assure you;</L>
<L>Perhaps you know not our intention,</L>
<L>Permit me therefore, just to mention:</L>
<L>England—that <HI>paltry! bit of land,</HI></L>
<L>We mean to conquer and command;</L>
<L>'Twill yield the moment we appear,</L>
<L>We'll petrify the dogs with fear;</L>
<L>Balloons are made, and rafts constructed,</L>
<L>By which our hosts will be conducted;</L>
<L>Through clouds of smoke Balloons will sail,</L>
<L>And drop upon their coast like hail;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="033526_0019_0FF774DB31103610"/>
Chock full of men they'll all appear,</L>
<L>And darken e'en the very air;</L>
<L>So true they're steer'd, they'll drop with ease,</L>
<L>On whatsoever spot they please;</L>
<L>And some they really do intend,</L>
<L>Shall in the <HI>palace yard</HI> descend;</L>
<L>Alarm the House of <HI>Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI></L>
<L>And issue out a gen'ral summons;</L>
<L>With which all members shall comply,</L>
<L>Or in an instant they shall die.</L>
<L>Then farewell Anti-gallic glory,</L>
<L>Good by t'ye <HI>Billy Pitt</HI> the <HI>tory,</HI></L>
<L>Dundas and him this storm shan't weather,</L>
<L>But both shall go to h—ll together.</L>
<L>Others they'll order and arrange,</L>
<L>To light exactly in th' <HI>exchange;</HI></L>
<L>Confuse the merchants and the jobbers,</L>
<L>And all the speculating robbers,</L>
<L>Who'll fell their stock, if you'll believe me,</L>
<L>From tribes of <HI>Dan</HI> to tribes of <HI>Levy;</HI></L>
<L>They'll swear it was by their desire,</L>
<L>And <HI>France</HI> is Israel's Messiah;</L>
<L>Tune up the <HI>psalt'ry, harp</HI> and <HI>sackbut,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As there were no fiddlers in those days.</NOTE></L>
<L>And banish those who scrape <HI>on catgut;</HI></L>

<L>Our spacious <HI>rafts</HI> would make you stare,</L>
<L>Some two, and others three miles square.</L>
<L>To view this mighty floating army,</L>
<L>Would quite astonish, and alarm ye.</L>
<L>As thick as hops, or hives of bees,</L>
<L>You'll see them gliding on the seas;</L>
<L>They're all so frolicksome and skittish,</L>
<L>In hopes to broil and roast the British,</L>
<L>To eat and drink like any glutton,</L>
<L>And cut them up like pork or mutton.</L>
<L>On every raft is fix'd a battery,</L>
<L>That would to atoms quickly shatter ye.</L>
<L>Each man, I'm told, you may rely on,</L>
<L>Is near as brave as <HI>spitting L—n;</HI></L>
<L>Whose deeds atchiev'd by <HI>wooden sword,</HI></L>
<L>Surpass description, 'pon my word.</L>
<L>These rafts are meant, should ere they meet,</L>
<L>To sink and burn the English fleet;</L>
<L>And after that, the mighty host</L>
<L>Shall land upon the British coast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As France is matchless at invention,</L>
<L>Another thing I'll beg to mention.</L>
<L>They mean to carve a <HI>wooden</HI> fish,</L>

<L>To hold his powder and his ball,</L>
<L>His gun, accoutrements and all;</L>
<L>Some bread and garlic, and a sausage,</L>

Vast shoals of these are now a making,</L>
<L>For this important undertaking!</L>
<L>They'll dart from ev'ry port and quarter,</L>
<L>And swim so <HI>nicely</HI> thro' the water,</L>
<L>All arm'd with fins and massy scales,</L>
<L>Like <HI>grampuses</HI> or <HI>sharks</HI> or <HI>whales;</HI></L>
<L>And ev'ry now and then you know,</L>
<L>They'll raise their snouts to puff and blow.</L>
<L>Quite unsuspected will they swim,</L>
<L>For who'd e'er think of such a whim?</L>
<L>No one would doubt but they were fish,</L>
<L>Unless they saw them on a dish,</L>
<L>Which they'll prevent by swimming deep,</L>
<L>And keeping watch when e'er they sleep.</L>
<L>How France will laugh when looking over,</L>
<L>And see them on the beach at <HI>Dover;</HI></L>
<L>And how the country folks will yell,</L>
<L>When every fish shall drop his shell,</L>
<L>And stand erect in full array,</L>
<L>To take their towns, to kill and slay.</L>
</LG>

<L>Still on the wing for vast contriving,</L>

<L>To fink or swim like <HI>duck</HI> or <HI>drake;</HI></L>
<L>When e'er they hear a cannon pop,</L>
<L>A cord is pull'd and down they drop.</L>
