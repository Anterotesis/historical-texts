<HEAD>A VINDICATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>GRIEVOUS complaints have been made against the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> for his silence under the heavy charges, which some have endeavoured, of late, to fix upon him. But it ought to be considered, the design of his kind visit was not to <HI>dispute,</HI> but to <HI>preach.</HI> And why should he throw away his precious time in writing to <HI>convince</HI> those, who seem resolv'd not to be convinced? Besides, there may be danger in dis∣puting; For 'tis a known maxim, <HI>The spirit may be dis∣puted away.</HI> And when he has so many calls to constant <HI>labour in the word and doctrine,</HI> is it not rather his duty to attend on this business? I am sure, the <HI>Country</HI> has need of some such <HI>eminent</HI> man of God to revive <HI>that spirit,</HI> which was so much the glory of the <HI>late times.</HI> And as he is to be here but a little while, he can't be too diligent in going about from place to place, to promote the cause of the people nick named <HI>new-lights;</HI> for it is certainly upon the decline, and must fall and die, if, instead of con∣stant laborious preaching, he should give way to the <HI>impor∣tunity</HI> of those, who, through ignorance, might put him upon <HI>medling with controversie.</HI></P>
<P>However, that there may be no longer any pretence for complaint, that due notice is not taken of the hard things objected against Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> I shall be at the
<PB N="4" REF="005704_0003_1026C8A211EF4348"/>
trouble to consider whatever has been <HI>publickly</HI> offered tending to give the world a <HI>bad opinion</HI> of him.</P>
<P>Only, I shall not think it impertinent to make this previous remark; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That it's no valid objection a∣gainst any man, much less a <HI>Gospel-minister,</HI> to be much spoken against, and represented as a <HI>disturber of the peace,</HI> an <HI>enemy to order,</HI> and a <HI>promoter of discord.</HI> As good men as Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> have been thus <HI>traduced.</HI> And it may be expected in a time of <HI>great revival of religion,</HI> that men's corruptions should vent themselves, in throwing <HI>Families,</HI> and <HI>Churches,</HI> and <HI>Towns</HI> into <HI>great confusion.</HI> PHARISEES, tho' friends to the outside of religion, yet can't bear to see it flourish in its <HI>power.</HI> And if, at such a time, they are filled with rage, and spit their venom, it's no other then may be expected. A state of <HI>external peace</HI> and <HI>quiet,</HI> on a <HI>religious</HI> account, bodes ill to a peo∣ple: As, on the other hand, when the peace of <HI>formalists</HI> and <HI>carnal professors</HI> is disturbed, and they cry out of those who are the <HI>instruments</HI> in reviving a <HI>spirit of zeal</HI> and <HI>forwardness in religion,</HI> it is a hopeful symptom. Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI> s being so much the object of the ill will and clamour of your <HI>half-way christians,</HI> is so far from being an argument in prejudice of his <HI>character,</HI> that it's the very thing a <HI>zealous christian</HI> would look for.</P>
<P>I now come to consider the <HI>objections</HI> that have been made against him.</P>
<P>And I shall <HI>first</HI> take notice of what has been said a∣gainst his <HI>Itinerant preaching.</HI> And as this seems to be the <HI>greatest difficulty</HI> in the minds of many, I shall be <HI>more large</HI> in my <HI>vindication of him upon this head.</HI> If I can remove away this prejudice, I shall the more easily be heard in what I have further to offer.</P>
<P>'Tis pretended, that the <HI>Itinerating</HI> practice this good man has taken up, is an <HI>occasion</HI> of <HI>bitterness,</HI> and <HI>clamour,</HI> and <HI>evil speaking;</HI> and that it has produced <HI>alienations, con∣tentions</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="005704_0004_1026C8A3EA24FC78"/> 
and <HI>Schisms.</HI> And is it any thing strange, that <HI>evil</HI> should <HI>accidentally</HI> follow upon that which is <HI>good?</HI> There is no security against the <HI>humours,</HI> and <HI>passions,</HI> and <HI>wills</HI> of men. It <HI>ministers</HI> will be <HI>envious,</HI> and set them∣selves against <HI>their brother,</HI> because he has <HI>superior faculties,</HI> and meets with <HI>greater applause,</HI> who can help it? Would they but be humble, and modest, and prefer the man who so far <HI>out shines</HI> them, we should hear little of <HI>those disorders,</HI> which are now so loudly complained of. In short, if Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> is CALLED to this work of <HI>Iti∣nerating,</HI> he must not <HI>disobey the call,</HI> tho' the lusts of <HI>Pharisees</HI> should make them <HI>wrathful</HI> and <HI>contentious.</HI></P>
<P>And that he is THUS CALLED will appear evident beyond all reasonable contradiction, (let your <HI>letter-learned</HI> Gentlemen from the <HI>College</HI> say what they will) if you only consider in what an <HI>extraordinary</HI> way he was <HI>form'd</HI> and <HI>trained up</HI> for, and then <HI>led into this practice,</HI> as we have the account in the <HI>history of his life;</HI> which is the more worthy of <HI>special</HI> notice, because in writing it, he "received (<HI>preface to his life</HI>) assistances from the <HI>holy spirit</HI> in bringing many things to his remembrance, which otherwise he should have forgotten."</P>
<P>There is something observable in the <HI>very place</HI> of his <HI>birth</HI> into the world. For he was <HI>"born in an Inn."</HI> And is it any wonder, if this <HI>memorable circumstance</HI> "has been of service to him in exciting him to follow the ex∣ample of his saviour, who was <HI>born in a stable, and laid in a manger belonging to an inn?"</HI> And 'tis really sur∣prising, that, while even an <HI>infant,</HI> "his mother was us'd to say, she expected more comfort from him then any o∣ther of her children." It must indeed be owned, (<HI>pag.</HI> 2.) <Q>he was <HI>froward</HI> from his mother's womb,—soon gave pregnant proofs of an <HI>impudent</HI> temper,—was addicted to lying, stealing, sabbath breaking, and other vices.</Q> But yet (<HI>pag.</HI> 3.) <Q>he had early (even before his re∣pentance,
<PB N="6" REF="005704_0005_1026C8A865A67938"/>
for these sins) such movings on his heart as were sufficient to satisfy him, that <HI>God loved him with an everlasting love,</HI> and had <HI>seperated</HI> him, even from his <HI>mother's womb,</HI> for the <HI>work</HI> to which he was after∣wards pleased to <HI>call</HI> him.</Q> And tho' as yet in an <HI>unconverted</HI> state, and so a motley mixture of <HI>half beast</HI> and <HI>half devil,</HI> he had (<HI>pag.</HI> 7.) great foretastes of the <Q><HI>Divine love,</HI> and was filled with such <HI>unspeakable rap∣tures,</HI> in St. <HI>John'</HI> s Church, that he was carried out even beyond himself.</Q> But what deserves a more than ordinary remark, (<HI>pag.</HI> 4.) <Q>he was always fond of being a <HI>Clergy-man,</HI> and used frequently (when a child) to imitate the ministers reading prayers, and to make <HI>little sermons in little books as long as his finger.</HI></Q> And so strong was his inclination to the <HI>ministry,</HI> <Q>that while he was employed (<HI>pag.</HI> 6.) in a <HI>common tavern,</HI> put on his blue apron, washed mops, cleaned rooms, and became a professed and common <HI>drawer,</HI> he <HI>composed two or three sermons,</HI> and dedicated one of them to his elder brother.</Q> Nay, he was favoured with an <HI>intimation from heaven,</HI> signifying it to be the <HI>will</HI> of <HI>God</HI> that he should be a <HI>minister;</HI> <Q>For as he was going (pag. 11.) on an errand for his mother, an <HI>unaccountable</HI> but <HI>very strong impression</HI> was made upon his heart, that he should <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>print</HI> quickly.</Q> 'Tis true his <HI>mother</HI> upon his innocently telling her the story, "like <HI>Joseph'</HI> s parents when he told them his <HI>dream,</HI> turning short upon him, cry'd out, what does the boy mean? Prithee hold thy tongue." And the prophane carnal part of the world may treat this <HI>undoubted revelation</HI> in the same light rude manner. But Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI> s remark will rebuke them as it did her. "God (says he) has since shewn from whom this <HI>impression</HI> came."</P>
<P>And the traces of Divine providence in making way for his going to the <HI>University,</HI> that he might be fitted for the <HI>ministry,</HI> were very <HI>signal.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005704_0006_1026C8AB58F98A18"/>
I observed before, that <HI>He</HI> was station'd as a <HI>common Drawer</HI> in an <HI>Inn.</HI> But, upon his mother's being obliged to leave the <HI>Inn,</HI> and <Q>his quarrelling (pag. 6.) with his sister, and carrying his resentment to such a height, that his <HI>proud heart</HI> could scarce suffer him to speak to her for three weeks together,</Q> an end was put to his busi∣ness in the <HI>tavern.</HI> And having now little or no imploy∣ment, "much of his time (pag. 8.) was spent in <HI>reading plays,</HI> and sauntering about from place to place." But lo! while he was <HI>Idly</HI> wasting his time, one morning, in <HI>reading a play</HI> to his <HI>sister,</HI> he was <HI>moved</HI> to speak to her in the following words, (pag. 8.) <Q><HI>sister,</HI> I believe <HI>God</HI> intends something for me which we know nothing of: As I have been diligent in business, I believe many would have me for an apprentice; but every way seems to be barred up, so that God, I think, will provide for me some way or other.</Q> Some may think these words no more than <HI>common ones;</HI> and indeed Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> himself, at the time, seems to have had the same opinion of them. But as he <HI>piously</HI> observes, <Q><HI>God</HI> afterwards <HI>shewed</HI> him, they came from him.</Q> And this is too evident to ad∣mit a denial; for in a little time a way was opened for his <HI>maintainance</HI> at <HI>College.</HI> Upon this he re-enter'd his <HI>old School;</HI> which I could not omit to mention, because it was the occasion of his giving a <HI>specimen</HI> of what the world might, in time, expect from him. <Q>His <HI>Master</HI> (pag. 9.) set him a <HI>theme</HI> to translate into <HI>Latin.</HI> And tho' he had made no application to the <HI>Classicks</HI> for so long a time, he had but one considerable fault in his exercise. This he <HI>believed</HI> (as well he might) somewhat surprised his ma∣ster, and has afforded him matter of praise and thanks ever since.</Q> There are other instances of his <HI>uncommon</HI> promptness at <HI>School,</HI> and such as were evident <HI>Prog∣nosticks</HI> of that <HI>spirit</HI> and <HI>manner,</HI> in which he would appear when he should come forth into the world, <Q>He was re∣mark'd
<PB N="8" REF="005704_0007_1026C8ACDE0D40A8"/>
(pag. 9.) for his <HI>elocution,</HI> and <HI>making speeches</HI> be∣fore the corporation at their annual visitations.</Q> And such was his dexterity at <HI>reading</HI> and <HI>acting plays,</HI> even while he was at <HI>school,</HI> <Q>that his <HI>master</HI> compos'd something of <HI>this kind</HI> for him, (pag. 5.) and caused him to dress himself in <HI>Girls cloths</HI> (which, as he says, he had <HI>often</HI> done) to <HI>act a part</HI> before the Corporation.</Q> This indeed has since caused him much sorrow; <Q>But <HI>God</HI> (as he religiously notes, pag. 5.) brought <HI>good</HI> out of this <HI>evil,</HI> as it was a means of strengthening his memory, and <HI>teaching him a proper gesture of speaking,</HI></Q> even <HI>that</HI> which <HI>now</HI> appears so <HI>beautiful,</HI> and recommends him to the love and esteem of so great a part of the world.</P>
<P>I might go on, and take a view of Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> after his Entrance into <HI>College;</HI> especially his <HI>spiritual exercises, temptations, self denials,</HI> and <HI>acquirements of Divine Know∣ledge.</HI> But this would carry me too great a length. How∣ever, I can't wholly pass over this period of his life. How sorely was he exercised by <HI>Satan?</HI> How many were his Temptations? of how long continuance? He seems indeed to have been rather <HI>disordered in his mind</HI> than <HI>"im∣posed on by the Devil,"</HI> when, because he could not compose his <HI>College theme,</HI> <Q>he imagined (pag. 24.) he was <HI>directed</HI> by the <HI>holy spirit</HI> to go down in the Hall, confess he could not make a theme, and so publickly suffer for his master's sake.</Q> And 'tis probable, he was under the like <HI>disorder,</HI> when he "who used (pag. 23.) to be most <HI>forward</HI> in exhorting his companions, could set whole nights without speaking scarce any thing." But to what short of some <HI>satanick</HI> exercise could it be owing, <Q>that he tho't (pag. 21.) the <HI>Devil would appear to him</HI> every stair he went up, as <HI>Servitor,</HI> about <HI>ten at night,</HI> to the Gentlemen's rooms? And that he was so <HI>troubled by the Devil,</HI> when he lay down to rest, that, for some months, he scarce slept above three hours in a night?</Q> And how
<PB N="9" REF="005704_0008_1026C8AE6913F9D8"/>
great was his <HI>self denial,</HI> when, <Q>in order to get (pag. 22.) the mastery of his sensual appetite, by the help of Jesus Christ, he left off <HI>eating Pye, fruit,</HI> and the like; chose the <HI>worst sort of food;</HI> wore <HI>mean apparel, wollen gloves,</HI> a <HI>patched gown,</HI> and <HI>dirty shoes?</HI></Q></P>
<P>But I must not forget to relate the <HI>extraordinary manner</HI> in which he was set free from his <HI>spiritual</HI> troubles, and filled with the <HI>Joy</HI> of a <HI>sound convert.</HI> This I can't express so well as in his <HI>own</HI> words, which are these (pag. 29.) <Q>one day perceiving an <HI>uncommon drought</HI> and a <HI>noisome clamminess</HI> in my mouth, and using things to allay my thirst, but in vain; it was <HI>suggested</HI> to me, that when <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> cried out, <HI>I thirst,</HI> his <HI>sufferings</HI> were near over.—Upon this I threw my self upon the bed, cry∣ing out <HI>I thirst, I thirst:</HI> Soon after I perceived my load go off, a <HI>spirit of mourning</HI> was taken from me, and I knew what it was <HI>truly to rejoice in the Lord.</HI>—At first, after this, <HI>I could not avoid singing Psalms, wherever I was.</HI></Q> Was there ever a more clear and unexceptionable <HI>conversion?</HI> Was there ever a conversion attended with more <HI>uncommon</HI> circumstances? Here was a <HI>suggestion:</HI> And from whence came it, unless <HI>immediately</HI> from the <HI>third heavens?</HI> And here likewise was the more <HI>special occasion</HI> of it, an <HI>uncommon drought and a noisome clamminess in his mouth.</HI> And what was the <HI>thing</HI> intimated by this <HI>suggestion?</HI> Why, that he should cry out, as <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> did just before his sufferings ended, <HI>I thirst, I thirst.</HI> And what was the <HI>effect?</HI> Why, his <HI>immediate freedom from spiritual trouble,</HI> and a heart <HI>truly to rejoice in the Lord.</HI> And <HI>how</HI> was this made evident? Why, in <HI>singing Psalms wherever he was.</HI> Can even an <HI>Infidel,</HI> after this stupen∣dous account, call in question the <HI>truth</HI> of his <HI>conversion,</HI> or the <HI>spirituality</HI> of his <HI>joy</HI> arising herefrom? It would favour of <HI>prophaness</HI> to admit of the least doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005704_0009_1026C8B1C4B381A8"/>
And the <HI>manner</HI> of his <HI>acquiring Knowledge in Divine Things</HI> was as much beyond that which is common to <HI>or∣dinary</HI> men. For "he read (pag. 31.) the holy scriptures on his knees, laying aside all other books, and praying over, if possible, every line and word." In which way, as he remarks, "he got more <HI>true</HI> knowledge in <HI>one month</HI> than he could acquire from <HI>humane writings</HI> in a year." His laying aside all other books, must not be understood too strictly, but with the <HI>exception</HI> of <HI>Burkitt'</HI> s and <HI>Henry'</HI> s expositions, which were of admirable use to him. And no wonder, for <Q>many months did he (pag. 34.) kneel to study and pray over these books, as tho' he had been sitting at his master's feet.</Q> And behold! what <HI>special communications</HI> he received <HI>immediately</HI> from the <HI>spirit of truth!</HI> <Q>The <HI>holy spirit</HI> (says he, pag. ibid) has from time to time <HI>let me</HI> into the knowledge of divine things: And I have been <HI>directed,</HI> by watching and reading the holy scripture in this manner, even in the <HI>minutest cir∣cumstances, as plainly as the Jews were, who consulted the</HI> URIM <HI>and</HI> THUMMIM <HI>at the</HI> HIGH PRIEST'<HI>s breast.</HI></Q> Was there ever a man, since the <HI>apostolic</HI> times, so <HI>wonder∣fully</HI> instructed in the things pertaining to the Kingdom of Christ? And is it possible any one should be so blinded with <HI>prejudice</HI> as not to see, that he was furnished in an <HI>ex∣traordinary</HI> manner for <HI>uncommon</HI> service in the ministry of the Gospel?</P>
<P>'Tis true, he was invested with the <HI>sacred office</HI> in the <HI>ordinary</HI> way. But what a <HI>wide difference</HI> may you discern between <HI>him</HI> and <HI>most other</HI> ministers? 'Tis remarkable, tho', about a fortnight before his ordination, <Q>he strove and prayed (pag. 41.) for several days together, and had mat∣ter eno' in his heart, yet he was <HI>so restrained that he could not compose any thing at all.</HI></Q> This may look like a trivial circumstance, but it gave occasion for the <HI>pressure</HI> of that passage in the <HI>acts</HI> upon his heart, (pag. ibid.)
<PB N="11" REF="005704_0010_1026C8B7B1B520D0"/>
<HI>"We essayed to go to Bythinia, but the spirit suffered us not:"</HI> And it was owing to this, that we are able so clearly to see the <HI>resemblance</HI> between <HI>him</HI> and the <HI>inspir'd young Ezekiel.</HI> For it was upon <HI>this occasion,</HI> that he has pointed us to the passage wherein "God said (pag. ibid.) to that <HI>young prophet,</HI> just after he had given him a <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>public commission, Thou shall be dumb, but when I speak un∣to thee then shalt thou speak."</HI> And it must convince the most <HI>violent opposer</HI> Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> has in the world to con∣sider, <Q>that the very morning (pag. 43.) after his <HI>or∣dination,</HI> upon waiting upon <HI>God</HI> in <HI>prayer</HI> to know what he would have him to do, those words, <HI>speak out Paul,</HI> came with great power on his heart.</Q> And the effect was little short of <HI>miraculous,</HI> <Q>for <HI>immediately</HI> his heart was enlarged, <HI>God spake to him by his spirit,</HI> he was no longer <HI>dumb.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And as the <HI>manner</HI> of Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI> s <HI>preparation</HI> for the ministry, and of his <HI>first entering</HI> on this service, very evidently <HI>distinguish</HI> him from <HI>other</HI> ministers; shall any wonder that he is not <HI>stationed</HI> in some <HI>particular parish? Do men light a candle, and put it under a Bushel?</HI> Like the <HI>sun</HI> in the heavens he should diffuse his benign influences far and wide, that all, so far as is possible, may receive benefit. Thus he has done, and thus he is resolved to do, in spite of all the <HI>opposition</HI> of <HI>men</HI> and <HI>devils.</HI> And set none think he takes too much upon him; for <HI>God taught him,</HI> when he quitted his <HI>parish</HI> at <HI>savanna,</HI> to <HI>preach at large. "God</HI> (says he, Journ. from <HI>N. England</HI> to <HI>Falm.</HI> pag. 12.) seems to <HI>shew</HI> me it is my duty to <HI>evangelise, and not to fix in any particular place."</HI> And has not he, and all the world, reason to believe, that he is doing the will of the <HI>Lord,</HI> while he goes from Country to Country, and Town to Town, preaching the name of <HI>Jesus?</HI> What wonderful success does he every where meet with? How sweetly are people melted? How do their hearts leap for
<PB N="12" REF="005704_0011_1026C8B9A9388938"/>
joy? What troops attend him? How many Towns are alarmed at his coming? What crowds follow him, and admire him as some great power of God? And more than all this, han't his <HI>call</HI> to <HI>this manner</HI> of preaching been confirmed by the incontestible evidence of <HI>miracles?</HI> 'Tis true, he acknowledged in the high church-yard of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> discoursing on those words of <HI>Nicodemus, John</HI> 3. 2. <HI>No man can do those miracles which thou dost, unless God be with him;</HI> I say he frankly acknowledged (vid. <HI>state of religion in N. England, printed at Glasgow,</HI> pag. 67.) that he had cur'd no <HI>bodily</HI> diseases; but he declared publickly, at the same time, that <HI>greater miracles</HI> than these had been wro't, MIRACLES ON THE SOULS OF MEN. And he appeals to the world, in his 4th <HI>Journal,</HI> pag. 10. 17. in such words as these, <HI>"Has not God set his seal to our Mi∣nistry in an</HI> EXTRAORDINARY <HI>manner? Have not the Lepers been cleansed, the dead raised? Have not many that were spiritually blind, received their sight? And many that have been lame, strengthened to run the way of God's com∣mandments▪ That these</HI> NOT ABLE MIRACLES <HI>have been wro't, not in our own names, and by our own power, but in the name, and by the power of Jesus of Nazareth, cannot be denied."</HI></P>
<P>And will any, after such clear and strong evidence of his <HI>Divine mission,</HI> reflect upon him for his <HI>zeal</HI> and <HI>diligence</HI> in ob-ying the <HI>heavenly call?</HI> Is it nothing that he has been so <HI>wonderfully</HI> form'd for and trained up to, this ser∣vice? That he has been in so <HI>extraordinary</HI> a manner called to it, and succeeded in it? What would men have? If they will be <HI>blind,</HI> they must be <HI>blind.</HI> There is no help for it, if they won't see the <HI>sun</HI> when it shines at <HI>noon day.</HI></P>
<P>The other <HI>objections</HI> against Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> are of <HI>trivial</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="005704_0012_1026C8BB617191B8"/>
importance. This being so fully answered, a few words may suffice for the rest.</P>
<P>He has been <HI>charged</HI> with <HI>uncharitableness;</HI> and to make good the <HI>charge</HI> we have been told of his "reflections upon Arch Bishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI> Commissary <HI>Garden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>H—n</HI> of <HI>Newport."</HI> But a <HI>distinction</HI> ought to be made between <HI>uncharitableness,</HI> and <HI>true christian faithfulness.</HI> And shall a man be called <HI>censorious</HI> and <HI>uncharitable,</HI> be∣cause he is <HI>faithful</HI> in opening a <HI>brother</HI> to himself, and shewing him his danger? Or because he guards the world against the <HI>infection</HI> of <HI>bad books,</HI> which are the more likely to do hurt, as they appear under the name of an <HI>Arch∣Bishop?</HI> This is rather an instance of <HI>charity,</HI> than an ar∣gument of the <HI>want of it:</HI> And <HI>this charity</HI> in Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> is the more <HI>noble,</HI> as by the very <HI>exercise</HI> of it he expos'd himself to the clamour of <HI>lukewarm for malists.</HI></P>
<P>A mighty noise also has been raised against him as an <HI>uncharitable</HI> man, because he has intimated it to be his <HI>belief</HI> concerning the <HI>Colleges,</HI> "that <HI>their light was darkness, darkness that might be felt."</HI> But did he not mention the <HI>ground</HI> of his belief, <HI>it's being complained of by the most godly ministers?</HI> And have not the <HI>Gentlemen of the College</HI> given <HI>awful reason</HI> for fear, lest there should be too much <HI>truth</HI> in what these <HI>godly ministers have complained of?</HI> Who have been more <HI>violent</HI> in their <HI>opposition</HI> to the <HI>good work,</HI> Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> has been the <HI>great instrument</HI> in <HI>reviving</HI> in the land? And if our <HI>Colleges</HI> were not in an <HI>evil state,</HI> how came it about, that so much money was collected, in all parts of the land, for <HI>building</HI> and <HI>endowing</HI> the <HI>Shepherd's Tent,</HI> that <HI>Nursery</HI> of <HI>true converts</HI> for the <HI>maintaining and carrying on the good work</HI> in our Churches? Alas! that our hopes were so soon dashed in pieces! We have this, however, to support us, that we may, in a little time, expect a supply from the <HI>Orphan house,</HI> out of the <HI>dear

lambs,</HI> trained up under the care of that <HI>experienced Chri∣stian,</HI> and <HI>able Divine,</HI> the Reverend Mr. <HI>Barber;</HI> a Gen∣tleman chosen and approbated by Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> as a man after his own heart.</P>
<P>The last instance of his <HI>uncharitableness</HI> is collected from those words in his <HI>New-England Journal,</HI> <Q>I fear many, nay, most that preach, do not experimentally know Christ.</Q> And if he meant the <HI>ministers in this land,</HI> wherein was he blame-worthy? Is there not <HI>reason</HI> for such a fear? Don't <HI>many,</HI> nay, <HI>the most,</HI> of <HI>our ministers</HI> oppose the <HI>good work?</HI> Can this be denied? And what <HI>blacker mark</HI> can they have upon them? I am sure Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI> s opinion of this kind of persons was, (Jour. 4th. pag. 17.) that they were in danger of the guilt (it not actually under it) of the <HI>Blasphemy against the holy Ghost.</HI> And such emi∣nent <HI>men of God</HI> as Mr. <HI>E—ds,</HI> Mr. <HI>T—t,</HI> Mr. <HI>C—r,</HI> and others I could name, were of the same mind. And shall Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> be complain'd of, because he han't <HI>charity</HI> for <HI>this sort</HI> of men? How much better would it be for the Churches, if all such <HI>pharisees</HI> and <HI>wolves in sheep's cloathing</HI> could be removed from their places?</P>
<P>It has likewise been mentioned to Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI> s disho∣nour, that he is an <HI>Enthusiast.</HI> But zealous forward Chri∣stians, especially <HI>ministers,</HI> must expect to be spoken of in names of <HI>obloquy.</HI> I may appeal to all who have ever read Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI> s writings, whether they ever saw in them any one real mark of an <HI>enthusiastical</HI> turn of mind? 'Tis true, he appears from the <HI>current strain of them all,</HI> to be a man <HI>extraordinarily</HI> assisted, directed and conducted. And we have <HI>abundant reason</HI> to think, no one, since the days of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> has had such constant and <HI>immediate</HI> commu∣nications from another world. And if men will miscal this <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> I can only pity their <HI>prophaness.</HI> May it

not be feared, whether they an't <HI>back-door</HI> friends to all influences from above? And if they don't take care, they may commence <HI>Infidels</HI> e're they are aware.</P>
<P>In fine, Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> has been charged not only with <HI>violating his subscriptions;</HI> but with <HI>breaking his promises,</HI> by <HI>praying</HI> and <HI>administring the sacrament</HI> without the Use of the <HI>forms</HI> in the <HI>book of common prayer.</HI> But as I am not acquainted with the <HI>subscriptions</HI> and <HI>canons,</HI> and such∣like trumpery of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> I can rest satis∣fied with an <HI>implicit faith</HI> in Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI> s <HI>honesty</HI> and <HI>inte∣grity;</HI> and the rather, as I have so abundantly proved him to be a man under an <HI>extraordinary</HI> guidance.</P>
<P>I know not what reception this <HI>Essay</HI> of mine will meet with in the world: But this I know, that I had a <HI>good in∣tention</HI> in writing it; and I heartily wish my design may be answered, in <HI>opening the eyes of people,</HI> and leading them into <HI>just conceptions</HI> of the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> who is so much the <HI>subject</HI> of the Controversies of the present day.</P>
