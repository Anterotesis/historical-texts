<HEAD>TO THE READER</HEAD>
<P>AT the Time when (a few Months past) these <HI>Sermons</HI> were Preached, I had not the least thought of Printing them. But several of my Hear∣ers have not only importuned my Consent thereunto, but brought me transcribed Copies as they were tak∣en from me in Short-hand, with a desire that they might be sent to the Press; and that therefore I would first <HI>peruse</HI> them: which I have done; and must as∣sure the <HI>Reader,</HI> that if he does expect any thing <HI>Curious</HI> or <HI>Critical</HI> in what is herewith emitted▪ he will find himself disappointed, There is nothing <HI>Elaborate</HI> therein more than what is usual in the or∣dinary Course of my Ministry. Only <HI>the great saving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruths of the Gospel</HI> are plainly delivered, wiib <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Inculcations</HI> as I have thought might be proper and edifying in a <HI>Popular Auditory.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>CHRIST</HI> shall be Glorified, and the Souls of any of his Elect Benefitted by this Publication, I shall not repent of my Consenting thereunto, in the Bless∣ed Day of His <HI>Appearing.</HI> Let Him <HI>Come Quickly.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apostle in this, with the preceed∣ing and following Verses, Exhorts Believers to adorn their Profession of the Gospel, with an Holy Con∣versation. There are several <HI>Motives</HI> menti∣oned, whereby this Exhortation is urged.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause the Gospel it self does so Teach
<PB N="6" REF="000998_0005_0FAEE82728802A00"/>
men. <HI>The Grace of God which brings Salvation,</HI> the Gospel which is a Doctrine of Grace, and which does bring to men the Tidings of Sal∣vation, teaches them to <HI>deny all Vngodliness,</HI> that they should be careful of being Guilty of Sins against the First Table of the Moral Law: and to <HI>deny all worldly Lusts,</HI> that they should Abstain from all Sins against the Second Table of that Law: and that they should <HI>Live Soberly</HI> in respect of themselves: <HI>i. e.</HI> that they should be Temperate, &amp; Live <HI>Righteously</HI> in respect of men. And that they should <HI>Live Godly,</HI> which implieth the Exercises of Duties of Piety and Religion, which have God for their Object. This does the Gospel Teach men.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Motive the Apostle useth, is, in that such a Life is the way to Blessedness; as in the words which have been read. Ho∣liness is the way to Happiness. They that bring forth Fruit to Holiness, shall in the End have Everlasting Life. Against this might be objected, we see Holy men many times mise∣rable in Outward respects, and they that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive Godly are Persecuted. The Gospel assures us, that we shall be exposed to Reproaches▪ and many Sufferings in this world. True, (sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the Apostle) but then you must remember, there another World besides this; &amp; in that you shall
<PB N="7" REF="000998_0006_0FAEE827D01AE8D8"/>
be <HI>Blessed</HI>: In that other World, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take place, at the Appearing of the Great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ. <HI>The Great God, and our Saviour</HI>; The meaning i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Great God, even our Saviour. The Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which is translated <HI>Appearing,</HI> is not in Scripture Attributed to any, but the Second Person in the Trinity. There is a twofold <HI>Appearing</HI> of Christ.</P>
<P N="1">1. His <HI>Incarnation</HI> is called His <HI>Appearing</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.10. By His <HI>Appearing</HI>▪ He has brought Life and Immortallity to light. The Son of God did appear in the form of a man to Save the world, and therefore to Dy, that He might accomplish Salvation for all that should believe on Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. But then, there is a Second <HI>Appearing</HI> of Christ, which is yet to be expected, Namely, His <HI>Appearing</HI> to Judge the world. He has once <HI>Appeared</HI> to Save the world, He will again <HI>Appear</HI> to Judge the world. And this is by way of <HI>Eminency</HI> called His <HI>Appearing.</HI> The Original word signifies an <HI>Illustrious</HI> and <HI>Glorious</HI> Apppearing.</P>
<P>The words afford unto us Three Doctrines.</P>

</LIST>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there is a Blessed Hope which Believers Look for.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth before us may be opened, by enquiring into three particulars.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What is meant by this Blessed Hope?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What is implyed in Believers looking for it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What Reason they have to look for it?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Q. 1. <HI>What is meant by this Blessed Hope?</HI></P>
<P>For Answer, <HI>Hope</HI> is here put for the Good hoped for. 'Tis a <HI>Metonimical</HI> Expression usual in Scripture. So Fear is sometimes put for the thing most feared; as we read concerning <HI>Iacob,</HI> that when he took a solemn Oath, he did Sware by <HI>the Fear of his Father Isaac, Gen.</HI> 31.13. That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by that God who was the chief Object of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his Father <HI>Isaac,</HI> that God whom his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther <HI>Isaac</HI> did fear above all things. So Love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sometimes put for the thing most loved, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent.</HI> 2.7 <HI>Christ</HI> is called the Believers <HI>Love,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being the chief Object of his love. So the
<PB N="9" REF="000998_0008_0FAEE82ADCCEB5C8"/>
good contained in the Promises, is called the Promise Heb. 10.36. <HI>Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you might receive the Promise.</HI> The meaning is, the good contained in the Promise. Thus Hope is put for the good hoped for, Gal. 5.5. <HI>For we through the Spirit, wait for the Hope of Righteousness by Faith.</HI> By the Hope of Righteousness is meant the Righteousness which we hope for. We (sayes the Apostle) do by the assistance of the Spi∣rit of God, Hope for a Righteousness that will Justifie us, that will make us appear Just and Righteous before God; not by our own works, but by Faith, Colos. 1.5. <HI>For the Hope which is laid up for you in Heaven.</HI> The meaning is, <HI>the good hoped</HI> for which is laid up in Heaven. And this is called a <HI>Blessed Hope,</HI> on a double account.</P>
<P N="1">1. In respect of the <HI>Subject</HI> of it, Namely <HI>Blessed Ones.</HI> Such as are made partakers of Regenerating Grace, 1 Pet. 1.3. <HI>He has Be∣gotten us again to a Lively Hope.</HI> None have a lively hope but such as are begotten again, and have a right unto the Inheritance which is <HI>Re∣served</HI> in Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis called a <HI>Blessed Hope,</HI> in respect of the <HI>Object</HI> of it, Namely <HI>Blessedness</HI>: that is it which Believers hope for. They hope for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reater Blessedness then that at present they enjoy. Their Blessedness is indeed, begun in
<PB N="10" REF="000998_0009_0FAEE82B91B7F320"/>
this Life Joh. 3.36. <HI>He that Believeth</HI> has <HI>E∣verlasting Life.</HI> He <HI>has</HI> it in the beginnings of it. A man whose Sins are Pardoned, is a Blessed man, Psal. 32.1. <HI>Blessed is the man whose Sins are forgiven,</HI> and unto whom God does not impute Iniquity. That man that has Spi∣ritual Blessings bestowed on him, (in which <HI>Blessedness</HI> doth chiefly consist) is truly a Blessed man, That man that has Grace in his Soul, and that has a sure Title to an inheritance in Heaven, is a Blessed man. Nevertheless, though Believers here are as to their <HI>State</HI> Blessed, they are subject to many miseries, many afflictions and sorrows must they undergo while in this world; As <HI>Iob</HI> said, Job 2.10. <HI>Shall a man re∣ceive good at the hands of God, and not evil.</HI> In this world Believers do not receive only good, but evil. But in the World to come, they shall then receive good &amp; not evil. It was therefore said of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> Luk. 16.25. That <HI>in his Life time, he had his Evil things, but now he is Comfort∣ed</HI>; now he is gotten into the other World, there is no more evil things attending of him, there is nothing but what is comfortable. But to speak more particularly, there are several things comprehended in this <HI>Blessedness,</HI> which is the object of the <HI>Believers</HI> Hope.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>They hope for</HI> Salvation <HI>at the Appearing of the Great God our Saviour Iesus Christ.</HI> When He appears He will appear to them as a Savi∣our.
<PB N="11" REF="000998_0010_0FAEE82C692B6DC0"/>
And all that Good, all that Blessedness which is contained in this Comprehensive word, <HI>Salvation</HI> is that they hope for, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.8. Putting on the Breastplate of Faith, and Love, and for an helmet, <HI>the hope of Salvation.</HI> There is Salvation in respect of Deliverance from outward Evils. This Believers hope for, Isa. 60.20. <HI>The dayes of thy mourning shall be ended.</HI> And there is <HI>Salvaton</HI> in respect of Deliverance from Spiritual &amp; from Eternal Evils. Sin is a Spiritu∣al evil; the temptations of Satan are spiritual evils; &amp; the Torments of Hell are Eternal Miseries. There is the Worm that Dyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; the Fire that never shall be Quenched. Believers hope for deliverance from this, Isa. 45.17. <HI>Israel shall be Saved in the Lord with an Everlasting Salvation.</HI> Deliverance from Everlasting Misery, is an Everlasting Sal∣vation. And this is that which Believers ex∣pect, at the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Salvation of them all, will not be perfect∣ed till then, Heb. 9.28. <HI>He shall appear the Second time without Sin unto Salvation.</HI> The Redemp∣tion of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> was a Type of this Salvation. <HI>Moses</HI> then said to them, (as in the 14. <HI>Exod.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) <HI>The Egyptians which you have seen this day, you shall see them a∣gain no more for eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> So when Christ shall Ap∣pear, those evils that have been Afflictive to His People, they shall see them no more for ever. Neither Temporal Evils, as Hunger,
<PB N="12" REF="000998_0011_0FAEE82D370FFA50"/>
Thirst, no more Pain, no more Crying, nor a∣ny Spiritual Evils, neither Sin nor the Temp∣tations of Satan, shall molest them any more for ever. Now then this will be a Blessed Day, and therefore the hope of it is a Blessed Hope.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Believers hope that at the Appearing of the Great God our Saviour Iesus Christ, their dead bo∣dies shall be restored to Life again.</HI> Isa. 26.19. <HI>Thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise.</HI> As for dead Believers, when the dead Bodies of the Prophets shall arise they shall arise too. The Resurrection of the Body is a special object of the Believers <HI>Blessed Hope.</HI> It was therefore a principle thing in the Doc∣trine <HI>Paul</HI> Preached, &amp; that he was Persecuted for, Act. 23.6. <HI>For the Hope of the Resurrecti∣on of the dead am I called into Question.</HI> And a∣gain, Act. 24.15. <HI>I have Hope towards God, that there shall be a Resurrection from the dead.</HI> Not∣withstanding, their immortal Souls must be separated from their Bodies for some time, they know not how long, and in the mean time their bodies consumed in the rotting Grave. Believers hope that then they shall have the very same Bodies restored to them again, which their immortal Souls were in before Death made a separation, but wonderfully and glo∣riously Changed as to the qualities thereof. 'Tis true also concerning Unbelievers, wicked
<PB N="13" REF="000998_0012_0FAEE82DE3C9DD80"/>
men, that they shall rise out of their Graves, and enjoy the very same Bodies that they had in this world. We may not think, that the Bodies that have sinned, shall escape the Fire of Hell, and that another Body that never sinned, shall suffer instead of it. Thus as to Believers, they shall have the very same Bo∣dies. That Body that did serve God and Glorifie Him in this world, shall be made to live again in that Day. As the Body of Christ now in Glory, is the very same which did lye in the Grave. That very Body that was Crucifyed, is now at the Right-hand of God. So shall it be as to Believers on Christ, 1 Cor. 15.53. For <HI>this Corruptible, must put on Incor∣ruption, This</HI> Corruptible and not another. And the Resurrection of the Body which is the Blessed Hope of all Christians, will be at the Appearing of Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.23 We shall rise every one in their own order, <HI>they that are Christs at His Coming.</HI> It will be <HI>at the Last Day. Martha</HI> said to Christ, when He told her that her Brother should rise again, Joh. 11.24 <HI>I know that he shall rise again, in the Resurrecti∣on at the last day.</HI> And this is also signified &amp; sealed to Believers in the Sacrament. When they partake at the Lords Table, this Glorious Truth is signified, and the Promise of it seal∣ed unto them. Joh. 6.54 <HI>He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood has Eternal Life, and I will
<PB N="14" REF="000998_0013_0FAEE82EA51CABE0"/>
Raise him up at the last day.</HI> That very Body, that did Sacramentally eat the Flesh of Christ, and that did drink of the Blood of Christ, He will Raise it up at the Last Day. And this blessed truth, has ever been the Faith and Hope of Believers, even in all ages of the world. This was that <HI>Iob</HI> did hope for and was assured of, Job 19.26 <HI>I know that my Redeemer Liveth, and that He shall stand on the Earth at the latter day, and though after my skin worms destroy this Body, yet in my Flesh I shall see God.</HI> It is as much as if he had said, I know that there will be a Glo∣rious Appearing of the Great God my Saviour, and that though my Body be consumed in the rotting Grave, it shall be restored to Life in that Blessed Day.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Believers hope that at the Appearing of the Great God our Saviour Iesus Christ, their Bodies shall undergo a Blessed Change.</HI> Not only that they shall be restored to Life, but be Blessedly Changed from what they are. They are now subject to many infirmities, which will then be perfectly and forever removed from them Phil 3.21 <HI>He shall Change our vile Bodies.</HI> We look for a <HI>Saviour</HI> from Heaven that shall Change our vile Bodies: whatever it is makes our Bodies subject to vileness, to meaness, that shall be done away. There are Bodily infirmi∣ties which are the fruit of Sin, and some part
<PB N="15" REF="000998_0014_0FAEE82F4DA65E98"/>
of the Curse. So are all Bodily Diseases. There are some Bodies subject to Chronical dis∣eases, which are <HI>Ludibria Medicorum,</HI> all the Physicians in the world cannot cure them. <HI>Asa</HI> was Diseased in his Feet, and sought to the Physicians, and doubtless had the Advice of the Ablest Physicians in the Kingdom, but they could not help him. The Resurrection will Cure all Diseases. The Diseases which the Bodies of Saints carry to the Grave with them, shall not come out of the Grave, again. There are Bodily infirmities also, which are not the effect of Sin, which men would have been subject unto if they never had sinned; such as Hunger, Thirst, want of Sleep, and the like. If <HI>Adam</HI> never had sinned, his Body would have stood in need of Food, that so it might be continued in Life. Therefore be∣fore ever he had sinned, God said to him, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.16. <HI>That he might eat of all the Trees in the Garden of Eden,</HI> one only excepted. And we find <HI>Adam</HI> subject to Sleep before ever he sinned against God. But after the Resurrection, they shall be freed from the sinless infirmi∣ties of Humane nature, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.30. <HI>In the Re∣surrection they are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</HI> Now the Angels of God in Heaven, never Sleep, Eat, Drink, nor need they any such thing to support their Natures. So shall it be with Believers after the Resurrection. They
<PB N="16" REF="000998_0015_0FAEE8300CBDEAC8"/>
shall Hunger no more, neither Thirst any more. Their Bodies shall then be endowed and adorned with Glorious properties, which the body of <HI>Adam</HI> in his first Estate had not. They will be more happy in respect of their Bodies, then <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradise was. They will have a greater Glory on their Bo∣dies than he had. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.43. <HI>The Body is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own in Dishonour, it shall be raised in Glory.</HI> That <HI>Glory</HI> may in special <HI>intend</HI> a <HI>Lustre,</HI> that the body will have on it; like that which was on the face of <HI>Moses</HI> when he had been with God in the Mount And like that which was on the Face of Christ, when transfigured in the Mount, and His <HI>Face did shine like the Sun.</HI> Their bodies shall have no Impediment to the operation of their Souls. Now their bodies are a great hindrance to the operation of the Soul. They will not be so after the Resur∣rection. Yea, and they shall be Immortalized bodies. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.52, 53. <HI>The Dead shall be Raised incorruptible and we shall be changed. For this Corruptible, must put on Incorruption, and this Mortal must put on Immortality.</HI> In that re∣spect also, they shall be more happy then <HI>Adam</HI> in his first Estate was. <HI>Luk.</HI> 20 36. <HI>They shall be Equal to the Angels, neither can they Dy any more.</HI> This is more then could be said of <HI>Adam.</HI> His body was not so immortal that it could not dye, for it did dye after he
<PB N="17" REF="000998_0016_0FAEE830C9A58B20"/>
sinned. But as for Believers, at the Appear∣ing of Christ, their Bodies shall be made like to that Body which Christ has now in Heaven. <HI>Phil,</HI> 3.21. <HI>He shall change our vile bodies, that it may be fashioned like unto His Glorious Body.</HI> Therefore it is said, they shall <HI>bear the Image of the Heavenly</HI>: 1 Cor. 15.49. <HI>As we have born the image of the Earthly, so also we shall bear the image of the Heavenly.</HI> As we have born the image of the Earthly <HI>Adam</HI> in respect of the Mortality of our Bodies, we shall bear the image of the Second <HI>Adam</HI> in respect of Im∣mortality as to our Bodies.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Believers Hope that at the Appearing of the Great God our Saviour Iesus Christ, they shall see Him with exceeding Ioy.</HI> True it is, Unbelievers in that day shall see Christ: they that have slighted Him, despised Him, and would not believe the Gospel, they shall see Him in that day. Yea, all the men in the World, or that ever were, or shall be; they shall see Him in that day. The <HI>Iews</HI> that Crucified Him, <HI>Pilate</HI> that Condemned Him, shall see Him in that day; but little to their comfort. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.7. <HI>Every Eye shall see Him, and all they that pierced Him, and all the Kings of the earth shall wail.</HI> They shall see Him to their Wo and Wailing, when then they shall think with themselves, This is He
<PB N="18" REF="000998_0017_0FAEE8330EE64908"/>
that we h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve despised, now we see that He is the Great God, who will Judge us for all our slighting and despising of Him. Thus they will see Him to their Amazement and Everlasting Terror. But believers shall behold Him to their unspeakable Joy and Comfort. There∣fore the Apostle having described the manner of Christ's coming to judge the world, adds 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.18. <HI>Comfort one another with these words.</HI> This was that which comforted <HI>Iob</HI> under all his afflictions, that at the last day he should see Christ. <HI>Iob</HI> 19.27 <HI>In my flesh shall I see God, with these Eyes shall I see Him.</HI> That is one Reason why Believers shall have their bodily sight restored to them at the last day, that so with their bodily Eyes they may behold the Glorious Body of Jesus Christ. That is a blessed thing: to have seen Christ though in his state of Humiliation, was a blessed and desira∣ble thing: therefore did Christ say <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.16, 17 <HI>Many Prophets and Righteous men have desired to see the things that you see and have not seen them. But blessed are your Eyes for they see, and your Ears for they hear.</HI> The holy Prophets desired nothing more then that (if it had been the Will of God) their Eyes might have seen the Son of God appearing in Flesh. But what a blessed thing will it then be, to see Him in His state of Exaltation? <HI>Ioseph</HI> knew it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be a joy to his Father to hear of his Glory,

<P>We proceed unto the Second Enquiry.</P>
<P><HI>2. Enqui.</HI> WHat is implyed in Believers Looking for this Hope?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. It does imply a firm belief con∣cerning what is here expressed. For a man will not look for that which he does not be∣lieve▪ Ever shall be▪ No more will they look
<PB N="29" REF="000998_0028_0FAEE83E23807488"/>
for the appearing of Christ, that do not believe that he will appear This Hope is an assured hope. Believers so Hope for, so Look for Christs appearing, as that they are sure that they shall see him, Job 19▪25 <HI>I know that my Redeemer lives, and that He Shall stand on the Earth in the Latter Day, and that in my flesh I shall see God.</HI> The Apostle also sayes, 1 John 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2 <HI>We know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him.</HI> Tis true, that there are be∣lievers who do not know their own interest in this Blessedness, that have Doubts and Fears, through the weakness of their Faith. Nevertheless, this they know and beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and are sure of, that Christ will appear from heaven. They that do not believe this, do not look for the Blessed Hope.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Looking for the Blessed Hope does imply <HI>frequent</HI> thoughts concerning it. As a person that looks for the return of an absent Friend, has <HI>frequent</HI> thoughs concern∣ing him, so they that look for Christs coming, will have <HI>frequent</HI> thoughts concerning him▪ <HI>David</HI> sayes, Psal▪ 94▪19▪ <HI>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy Comforts delight my Soul·</HI> He had multitudes of thoughts, but there was one thought that did in a special manner delight his Soul, that did comfort him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no thought did delight and comfort more
<PB N="30" REF="000998_0029_0FAEE83EF9D89FD0"/>
than that of desiring the coming of the <HI>Messiah.</HI> A man that looks for this is still remembring of it. As the <HI>Psalmist</HI> speaks, Psal. 42.6 <HI>I re∣member thee from the Land of Iordan, and of the Hermonites, from the Hill Missar. Iordan</HI> was <HI>Eastward</HI> of the land of <HI>Canaan, Hermon</HI> was <HI>Northward, Missar</HI> (as some observed) was <HI>Southward.</HI> Thus they that look for the ap∣pearing of Christ, where ever they be, in what part of the world soever, thoughts concerning Christs Apppearing come into their mind.</P>
<P N="3">3· This Looking for the Blessed Hope does imply a Longing for it· The man that looks as he ought to do for the Appearing of Christ, <HI>Loves that Appearing.</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.8 He longs to see that Blessed Day. Believers in the dayes of the <HI>Old-Testament,</HI> who did look for the First Ap∣pearing of the Son of God, they wished for, longed for, prayed for it continually, and did desire nothing more. Mat. 13.17 <HI>Many Pro∣phets and Righteous men have desired to see those things which you see.</HI> That was to see the day when Christ would appear in the world. <HI>A∣braham</HI> saw it and was glad· It was a joyful Meditation unto him, to think that Christ should come into the world. When God told him' that <HI>in Him all Nations should be Blessed:</HI> In which was implyed, a promise of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> that made his heart glad within him· So they
<PB N="31" REF="000998_0030_0FAEE83FED505B68"/>
that look for the Second Appearing of Christ, wish and long for it. 2 Pet. 3.12 <HI>Looking for, and hastning unto the Coming of the day of God.</HI> They that <HI>Look</HI> for it as they ought to do, <HI>hasten to it</HI>; that is with holy wishes and de∣sires. Cant. 8.14 <HI>Make hast my Beloved, and be thou like to a Roe on the Mountains of Spices</HI>: The words are a Prayer for the coming of Christ. The Spirit and the Bride say Come; as in Rev. 22.20 <HI>Come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</HI> That is the Spirit of one that does aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r a due manner look for the <HI>Blessed Hope, and the Ap∣pearing of our Saviour Iesus Christ,</HI> his heart <HI>within</HI> him sayes, <HI>Come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. and Lastly, This Looking for, does imply a Preparing for the Blessed Appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ. As one that looks for another to come, especially if it be a Great person, he will make suitable preparation for him So they that look for the Appearing of the Great GOD our Saviour Jesus Christ, will make a suitable preparation. They are a People ready, a People <HI>prepared for the Lords coming.</HI> Mark 13.33 <HI>Watch and Pray for you, know not when the time is.</HI> You know not when the Lord will appear, therefore you must be alwayes upon your Watch, and alwayes Pray∣ing, and live a life of Prayer, alwayes Watch
<PB N="32" REF="000998_0031_0FAEE8408AB8EB38"/>
against those things that would unfit you for the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus for the Second thing, pass we to the Third.</P>
<P><HI>3. Enqui.</HI> What Reason have Believers to look for the Blessed Hope?</P>
<P><HI>For Answ.</HI> 1. The Reason why they should look for this Blessed Appearing of Christ, is because of the <HI>Certainty</HI> of it. If it were a doubtful matter, they would not have so much reason to look for it. But it past all doubt▪ Their Hope is that that shall not be disappoint∣ed, Rom. 5.5▪ <HI>Hope maketh not ashamed.</HI> When Believers hope for the coming of Christ, they shall not be ashamed by being disappointed. As for the time of Christs Appearance, and of their arriving at the Blessed Hope, it may be sooner than they look for, or longer; but as to the thing it self, they never shall be disappointed. The Anchor of their hope, tis an Anchor that will hold, Heb. 6.19 <HI>Hope is the Anchor of the Soul, su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and stedfast.</HI> Therefore it is called <HI>a Good Hope,</HI> 2 Thes. 2·16 <HI>God has given us Everlasting Consolation, and good Hope through Grace.</HI> That is a <HI>good Hope,</HI> when a man hopes for good and shall certainly attain that good. Believers are as sure to enjoy their hoped for Blessedness, as if they now had it in actual possession. They are as sure to rise
<PB N="33" REF="000998_0032_0FAEE8415E7CB7D0"/>
out of their Graves at the Last Day to Eternal Life, as if now it were done. They are as sure when the Judgment is over to go with Christ to Heaven, and to be with Him there to Eternity, as if now they were there. Eph. 2.6 <HI>He has raised us up together, and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Iesus.</HI> We are as sure to be raised up together in that Bles∣sed day, when the Great God our Saviour Christ shall appear, and as sure then to ascend into Heaven, as if now we were there. This is Evident from several things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In that the Good and Blessedness which they hope for, is in a sure Hand and in a safe Place.</HI> In whose hands is it, but in the Hands of the Al∣mighty God, 2 Tim. 1.12 <HI>I know whom I have believed, who is able to keep that I have commit∣ted unto Him.</HI> What was that <HI>Paul</HI> had com∣mitted to God? It was his Soul, his Salvation, and all that Good he hoped for in another World. He had committed it all into the Hands of God, whom he knew was able to keep it for him. As a man that has a Jewel, and is afraid of losing it, if it were in his own keeping, therefore does commit it to the keep∣ing of a faithful Friend, that is more able to secure it for him· So it is here: And it is well for us that our Blessedness is not in our own keeping, for if it were, we should certainly
<PB N="34" REF="000998_0033_0FAEE84230947E30"/>
lose it. Our First Father did so. <HI>Adam</HI> his Life was put into his own hands, and he lost it, and proved a bankrupt when the Stock of the whole world was in his hand. But now the Blessedness of Believers being in Gods hand, who has ingaged to keep it for them, they are sure of it. None shall deprive▪ them of it. As Christ sayes concerning His <HI>Sheep,</HI> they shall have Eternal Life, John 10.29 <HI>My Father is Greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of His hands.</HI> As for Believers, and their Eternal Life, tis in the Hands of God. And as their hoped for Happiness is in a sure hand, so 'tis in a <HI>safe Place.</HI> That sure hand keeps it in a safe place▪ The Scripture speaks of a <HI>Treasure</HI> in Heaven, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.20 What is that <HI>Treasure in Heaven</HI>? 'Tis that same thing with the <HI>Blessed Hope.</HI> There no Thief can break through and steal. 'Tis <HI>Laid up</HI> there, Col. 1 5 <HI>The hope which is laid up for you in Heaven·</HI> The Blessedness you hope for, is laid up in a safe place: 'tis laid up in Heaven for you. 'Tis therefore said to be <HI>Reserved</HI> there, 1 Pet. 1.4 <HI>An inheritance reserved in Heaven for you.</HI> This is mentioned as the reason why the Hope of Believers is so sure and stedfast, because what they hope for is out of sight. 'Tis in Heaven, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.19 Here they are in a tempestuous Sea; but come what Storms can, they are safe e∣nough, because of their Anchor-hold, which

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Believers Hope of Blessedness is built upon a sure and never failing Foundation.</HI> And therefore, 'tis a sure Hope they have reason to look for it. For what is the Foundation of it?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mself is the Foundation of the Believers Hope.</HI> The Blessed God is the Object of the Blessed Hope, Psal. 71.5 <HI>O Lord my God thou art my hope.</HI> Jer. 14.8 <HI>The hope of Israel and Sa∣viour thereof, in the day of trouble.</HI> He is there∣fore styled <HI>The God of Hope, Rom.</HI> 15.13 the God of hope, not only He that is the <HI>Author</HI> of the Grace of hope, but the <HI>Object</HI> of the Be∣lievers hope. The Glorious Attributes of God, is the Foundation that the believers hope is built upon. Psal 147.11 <HI>He takes pleasure in them that hope in his Mercy.</HI> Then the Divine Mer∣cy is the Object of their hope. Now the Mercy of God will not fail. Lam 3.22 <HI>His Com∣passions fail not.</HI> Therefore the hope that is built thereon, will not fail. The Love of God is the Foundation of the Believers hope, and that is unchangeable. Jer. 31.3 <HI>I have Loved thee with an Everlasting Love.</HI> The Faithful∣ness of God is the Foundation of the Believers hope, and that fails not. Psal 89.31 <HI>He will not suffer his Faithfulness to fail</HI></P>

And there are two immutable things in it, in which 'tis impossible God should Lie: there is the Promise of God, and the Oath of God. When God did Swear to <HI>Abraham</HI> that he would give the <HI>Land of Canaan</HI> to his Children, that was not all God intended by that Oath to <HI>Abraham,</HI> but he intended this also, that to <HI>Abrahams</HI> Spiri∣tual Children, <HI>viz.</HI> Believers on Christ, He would give Everlasting Blessedness in the <HI>Heaven∣ly Canaan,</HI> that was implyed in the Holy Oath of God unto <HI>Abraham</HI></P>

That <HI>Covena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of Grace,</HI> which God has made with Believers is built up∣on the <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> which He has made with his Son Jesus Christ. <HI>Isa.</HI> 53.10 Notwithstanding the Mercy of God, they could have had no hope, had it not been for Christ, because God is Just as well as Merciful. And who could have satisfied the Justice of God? Who could have made Atonement for the sins
<PB N="38" REF="000998_0037_0FAEE846319E8F78"/>
of men? Yea, for the sins of all the men in the World, that shall believe on the Name of Christ? The Angels of Heaven could never have satis∣fied the justice of God, for any one sin: Only Christ the Son of God could do it. And he has done it by the Price of his own Blood. Heb 10 19 <HI>We have boldness to enter in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the holiest of all by the Blood of Iesus.</HI> We have good Hope that we shall be blessed in Heaven to Eternity because of the Blood of Jesus. Heb▪ 7.19 <HI>The Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.</HI> What is that but Christ? That Sacrifice Christ as our Priest has offered, is a <HI>better hope.</HI> That is it believers may build upon: they may safely venture their Souls on the merit of Christs most precious Blood; that has purchased for them all the blessedness they hope for. Moreover, the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of Christ is a ground of Hope to believers. For what can hinder men from being Blessed but only Sin? Now from the Resurrection of Christ, a believer may conclude his Sins are Pardoned: that God has been satisfied in the Death of Christ, otherwise He would never have been raised from the Grave. Therefore does the Apostle say, Rom. 4.25 <HI>He arose again for our Iustifi∣cation.</HI> For Christ was brought to the Prison of the Grave as our Surety. Well, but in as much as God let Him out, and by an Almigh∣ty Arm broke the gates of the Grave, and let
<PB N="39" REF="000998_0038_0FAEE847206DC9D0"/>
the Prisoner go forth, we may conclude the Debt is paid; that Christ has made full satis∣faction for all our Sins, and therefore we shall not fail of the Blessedness we hope for.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Believers hope is built upon their Vnion with Christ.</HI> Col 1.27 <HI>Christ in you the Hope of Glory.</HI> Therefore believers have a sure hope of Glory, because Christ is in them. Christ dwells in them by his Holy Spirit. He has taken an E∣ternal possession of them. Were it not for this, notwithstanding all that Christ has done, men could not hope for Blessedness: But now the believer may say, in as much as Christ is in me and I in Him, therefore shall I live forever, Joh 14.19, 20 <HI>Because I live therefore you shall live also, you in me and I in you.</HI> I am United to you sayes Christ, therefore as sure as I live, you may conclude you shall live also. So long as a mans Head is above water, he cannot be Drowned. Christ is the Head of Believers: They are the Members of his Mystical Body, being by Faith United to Him▪ That Head lives forever, and is now in blessedness; and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all they be also in Gods time. As long as their Union to Christ abides they need not fear, and that Union never shall be dissolved. Therefore it is set forth in Scripture by that of a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onjugal Relation,</HI> Hos. 2.19 <HI>I am betrothed to thee forever.</HI> So long as the Eter∣nal
<PB N="40" REF="000998_0039_0FAEE84787F454C8"/>
Son of God, and the Immortal Soul of the Believer shall live so long shall the Relation between Christ and him continue.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Reason why Believers should look for this Glorious Appearing of Christ is, because of the Exceeding Greatness of that Blessedness which they thus hope for. Eph. 1.18 <HI>That being enlightned, you may kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w what is the hope of His Calling, and what the riches of the Glory of His inheritance in the Saints.</HI> Riches of Glory is called an Inheritance, be∣cause Saints have a right to it by vertue of being made Heirs. They are Adopted, God has Adopted them, so do they become heirs. Therefore the inheritance is theirs, and there is Riches in it. Men give Portions to their Children according to their Riches. Well, but the Portion that God will give to His Chil∣dren, HIS <HI>Inheritance</HI> is Unspeakably great. Therefore should they Look for it, Wait for it▪ it is worth Waiting, Looking, and Pre∣paring for. All the pains that can be taken, when it comes, it will infinitely make amends for. There is nothing more desirable than Life. This Blessedness is called Life, Rev. 2 10 <HI>I will give thee a Crown of Life.</HI> A Kingdom is the greatest Happiness men on Earth are capable of enjoying. Therefore this blessed hope is expressed by that of of a Kingdom, Jam. 2.5
<PB N="41" REF="000998_0040_0FAEE8480A194038"/>
<HI>The Poor of this world, Rich in Faith, Heirs of the Kingdom, which He hath promised to them that Love him.</HI> No Heart can conceive, no Tongue can express the Exceeding Greatness of this Glory: 1 Cor. 6.9 <HI>Eye has not seen, Ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of man to conceive, what God has Prepared for them that Wait for Him</HI>: that Look for this Blessed Hope. Thus we see the Doctrine Confirmed in the things that have been mentioned.</P>

For which cause they cast Stones at him. For which of my good Works said Christ, do you Stone me; Not for any good Works, (say they) Joh. 10.33 but for Blasphemy because thou being Man makest thy self God. But their Fore-Fathers, the holy Patriarks of Old, did believe and did take com∣fort in the Faith of it, that God would Assume the Nature of man. Thus <HI>David</HI> believed, Psal. 110.1 <HI>The Lord said to my Lord.</HI> The <HI>Messiah</HI> was to be <HI>Davids</HI> Son, yet he calls him his Lord. So then, he did believe that his Lord would become a Man, that the great God would appear in Humane Nature, and that He should be of his Family too. And long before <HI>David, Iob</HI> had the same Spirit of Faith,

he believed that God would appear in the Na∣ture of man.

<PB N="53" REF="000998_0052_0FAEE8541422F010"/>

But then in respect of his Person, as he is the Son of God, so the Father and He are Equal: <HI>My Father and I am one. Ioh.</HI> 10.30 That is the Second Demonstration of the Truth before us.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The incommunicable properties of the Great God are to be affirmed of Iesus Christ.</HI> There are Properties and Attributes of God which are <HI>Communicable,</HI> such are Wisdom, Holiness, Goodness and the like. But they are not in Creatures in that proportion as they are in God. All the wisdom and goodness that is in all the Angels in Heaven, is like but as a drop of water to that which is in the Ocean, com∣pared with that which is in God. But then, there are also <HI>Incommunicable Properties</HI> of the Divine Nature, which cannot be affirmed of any but the Great God.</P>
<P>As now, <HI>Eternity</HI> is an Incommunicable Pro∣perty of the great God. <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.27 <HI>The Eter∣nal God shall be thy Refuge.</HI> He alone is the Eternal God. That is Eternal, which has
<PB N="54" REF="000998_0053_0FAEE854EBC04D58"/>
neither beginning nor ending. There are some Creatures which shall never Dy; Angels and the Souls of men are Immortal. But there is no Creature which has not had a beginning. But God is from Everlasting: Psal. 90.2 <HI>From Everlasting to Everlasting, thou art God.</HI> This must be said, and it is necessary unto Salvation that we should believe this, con∣cerning Christ. We may not think that He was not, until he was born of the <HI>Virgin Mary.</HI> He was God in Heaven before he was Man on Earth. Therefore, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 6.62 <HI>What do you say,</HI> (sayes Christ) <HI>if you shall see the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?</HI> Christ was before in that Heaven whether he did ascend, even before ever he was seen among men in this world. <HI>Abraham</HI> lived about two thousand Years before Christ was born, and yet Christ was before <HI>Abraham:</HI> Joh. 8.53 <HI>Before</HI> Abra∣ham <HI>was, I am,</HI> sayes Christ. He was then before he came into the world: when the world began Christ was. Time began with the world: but in <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1.1 it is said, <HI>In the Beginning was the Word,</HI> that is Christ, and <HI>the Word was with God.</HI> When the world began Christ was with God, yea before the world began: Joh. 17 5 <HI>The Glory which I had with thee before the world began.</HI> And therefore from all Eternity: Mic. 5.2 <HI>Whose goings forth hath been of Old, from Ever∣lasting.</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="000998_0054_0FAEE8558CC349C8"/>
Christ is from Everlasting, therefore He is the great God.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Omnipotency</HI> is another Incommuni∣nable Attribute of the Great God. There are Creatures which are said to be Mighty. Angels are styled <HI>Mighty Ones: Ioel</HI> 3.11 But there is no Creature which is Almighty: But Christ is so. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.8 Christ there sayes, <HI>I am the Alpha and Omega.</HI> He is styled, <HI>the Lord God Omnipotent.</HI> When the day shall come (and it will come, and God grant it may come quickly) when Christ shall Reign Glo∣riously before the whole World, then will it be said, as in Rev. 19 6 <HI>The Lord God Omni∣potent Reigns.</HI> Christ is the Lord God Om∣nipotent, and therefore He is the great God.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Omnipresence</HI> is an Incommunicable Attribute of the Great God. <HI>Ier·</HI> 23.24▪ <HI>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth saith the Lord.</HI> That is peculiar to God to fill Heaven and Earth, to be in all places at the same time. And ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this is to be affirmed concerning Christ: Joh. 3.9 <HI>None hath ascended into Heaven, but the Son of Man who is in Heaven.</HI> To be in Hea∣ven and on Earth too at the same time, is pe∣culiar to the great God: Yet it is true con∣cerning Christ Therefore Christ said, in Mat. 18.20 <HI>Where there are two or three gathered to∣gether in my Name, there am I in the midst of
<PB N="56" REF="000998_0055_0FAEE856539703C0"/>
them.</HI> Where ever there are Christians Assem∣bled together in the Name of Christ, there is He in the midst of them; yet they may be far distant one from another, it may be Ten Thousand Miles, as far as the East is from the West.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Omniscience</HI> is an Incommunicable Property of the great God There are some men that know a great deal, that have very enlarged Understandings, and Angels know much more than they; but none of them knows all things: none of them has an <HI>Infinite Vnde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣standing</HI>; that is proper to the great God, Psal 147.5 <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat is the Lord, his Vnderstanding is infinite.</HI> But this must be affirmed of Christ, that he knows all things, as <HI>Peter</HI> confessed to him, Joh. 21.17 <HI>Lord</HI> (sayes he) <HI>thou know∣est all things.</HI> To see what ever is in the hearts of men, is peculiar to the great God: 1 King. 8.39 <HI>Thou only knowest all the Hearts of the Children of men.</HI> And yet this is to be said concerning Christ: He knows how the hearts of men stand inclined and affected; He knows what ever is there. There is not a thought in the heart, but it is known unto Him. The Son of God has Eyes like to a flame of Fire. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.23 <HI>He Searches the Reins and Heart</HI>: therefore he is the great God. That is the Third Demonstration.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="57" REF="000998_0056_0FAEE85709FFE020"/>4. <HI>Iesus Christ has done, does do, and will do such things, as none but the great God can do.</HI> He has done that which none but the great God can do. None but God can Create: Isa. 40.28 <HI>The Eternal God, the Creator of the Ends of the Earth.</HI> None but the great God is the Creator: But Christ is the <HI>Creator.</HI> There is is not any <HI>Creature</HI> in the world, but came out of his hands, it was made by him: Joh. 1.3 <HI>The world was made by him, and there was noth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng made without him.</HI> All Creatures are either visible or invisible, belonging either to the upper or lower world, all of both those were made by Christ: Col. 1.16 <HI>He has Cre∣ated all things that are in Heaven or on Earth, Visible and Invisible, by him and for him they were Created·</HI> So to be the Author of that which is a true and proper Miracle, is peculiar to God: Psal 136.4 <HI>He only does great Wonders.</HI> That God only who is the God of Nature, can change the course of Nature, and act above the Constituted order of Nature, when ever he shall please. But Christ has done glorious Mi∣racles, and that by His own Power. The <HI>Iews</HI> had a marvellous expectation that when the <HI>Messiah</HI> came, he would do wonderful things; that he would be the Author of many Mira∣cles. They had reason to expect it from the Scriptures of the <HI>Old Testament.</HI> And when
<PB N="58" REF="000998_0057_0FAEE85B2A0CC928"/>
Christ came, some said, <HI>When the Messiah comes, shall he do more Miracles than this man does?</HI> He did such Miraculous things, the like was never done in the world before. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 9.32 The man that had been Born blind, and was by Christ made to see, sayes, <HI>Since the world began it was never heard, that a man should open the Eyes of one born Blind.</HI> 'Tis true, the Apostles did Wonderful things, Miraculous things; but it was not they, but Christ by them that did <HI>them.</HI> Therefore <HI>Peter</HI> said to some, Acts 3.12 <HI>Why do you look on us, as though we had by our own Power done this.</HI> No, it was by ver∣tue of the Power of Christ, that we did it sayes the <HI>Apostle</HI>· But when Christ did Miraculous things, they were done by him through his own Power. Therefore he said to the <HI>Leper,</HI> Mat. 8.3 <HI>I will be thou Clean. I will,</HI> none but the great God might speak such a word, or say <HI>I will</HI> that it shall be so. It shews, that Christ had an all Powerful Will; that he can do what ever he will do. And therefore He is the great God.</P>
<P>And there are such things done by Christ at this day, as do Declare him to be the great God. None but the great God can preserve and uphold the world in being. All <HI>Crea∣tures</HI> would return to <HI>their first nothing,</HI> if the infinite Arm of God did not uphold them: Neh. 9.6 <HI>Thou even thou art Lord abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, thou
<PB N="59" REF="000998_0058_0FAEE85C0EEFF1B0"/>
hast made Heaven and Earth, and all things that are therein, and thou preservest them all.</HI> It is Gods work to preserve the Creatures that are in the world. Now this is true concerning the Lord Jesus Christ: <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.3 <HI>He upholdeth all things.</HI> The Son of God upholds all things by the Word of his Power; then he is the great God. Therefore Christ sayes, Joh. 17.5 <HI>I work hitherto.</HI> Namely in upholding the world, in preserving the world, in governing the world and all Creatures therein. <HI>Preservation</HI> is a continued <HI>Creation</HI>; and so does Christ work hitherto.</P>
<P>And <HI>He will</HI> do such things as Declare him to be the great God. For he will raise the Dead from their graves, and none but the great God can do that: Acts 26.8 <HI>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should Raise the Dead?</HI> Were there not a God of in∣finite Power, it were impossible as to those Bo∣dies that have been devour'd by Fishes in the Sea, and by wild Beasts upon the Land, which has been the <HI>Fate</HI> of many a true Believer. It was a common thing in the dayes of the <HI>Roman Pagan Emperors,</HI> to throw Christians to the wild Beasts to Devour them. Now that those Bodies that have been Devoured by <HI>Beasts</HI> should be restored to Life, how incredible may it seem to carnal Reason? The Pagan Persecutors, would burn the bodies of Chris∣tians
<PB N="60" REF="000998_0059_0FAEE85C4D163458"/>
many times, and throw the Ashes into the Rivers on purpose to confute their fancy, that their bodies would arise again. Who but an infinite God, can make those very bo∣dies to come together and live again? But Christ can do it, and will do this very thing. Joh. 6.14 <HI>He that Believes</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>I will raise him up at the Last Day.</HI> When <HI>Laza∣rus</HI> Died, and had been Dead and Buried four Dayes, Christ stood over his grave, Joh. 11 43 and said, <HI>Lazarus come forth</HI>; and he that was Dead did come forth at the word of Christ. So at <HI>the great Day</HI> (which Lord let it com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> quickly!) <HI>Christ</HI> will stand over the Earth and say, <HI>Ye Dead come forth out of your graves</HI> And all the Dead shall come forth, every one in his own order· Therefore, <HI>Iohn</HI> 5.25 28 sayes Christ▪ <HI>The hour shall come when the Dead shall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear it shall Live; and all that are in their graves shall come forth.</HI> He then is the great God, that can command all the Dead to come to Life again. That is the Fourth Demonstra∣tion of the Truth before us.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The great God only is the Object of Divine Worship.</HI> Matth. 4.10 <HI>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m only thou shalt Serve.</HI> God only is to be Served, that is with Religi∣ous Service and Worship.

<P><HI>We see the Reason of several Glorious things which are to be Affirmed concerning the Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> As now, we see here the reason why Christ did not faint, and sink under that Burden of his Office, as <HI>Mediator</HI>▪ It was be∣cause He is the great God. Had any meer Creature had that burden on him, were it an Angel, he could not have subsisted under it. He is able to perform His Office of a <HI>Mediator</HI> in all respects· Christ is able to discharge his Prophetical Office, to Instruct all the Elect of God, in all Ages. There are Hundreds of Thousands, yea, Millions of Souls, that he has instructed as a Prophet: This is because he is the great God; otherwise if he had been no more then a man, then a creature, he could not have done it. Whence is it he did not sink under the weight of his Sufferings? Christ suffered such things, as no man in the world ever did the like. It is said, <HI>His visage was marred more than any of the Sons of men.</HI> Yet he did bear up under those sufferings. He suf∣fered, not only in his Body, but also in Soul, when he <HI>made His Soul an Offerring for Sin.</HI> How should he have been able to bear up un∣der the Wrath of the Father, that lay upon him when he was Surety for the Elect of God,
<PB N="66" REF="000998_0065_0FAEE860D8976900"/>
but that he is God? And so his Divine Na∣ture did support his Humane Nature, and made him capable of enduring such things, as never man did or could do. Likewise, we see the reason why the Sufferings of Christ were in∣finitely Meritorious, <HI>viz.</HI> because he was God. That the Elect of God might be redeemed from Death, it was necessary that a Life should be given for them, yea, and a Life that was more worthy, then the Life of all Men and Angels was given for them; that is the Life of him who is God: 1 Joh. 3.16 <HI>God laid down his Life.</HI> That cannot but be a Life that is infinitely precious Some mens lives one of them is more precious then a hundred thou∣sand of other men.

Acts 20 28 <HI>God has purchased his Church with his own Blood.</HI> God, that is Christ, who is the great God.

<PB N="67" REF="000998_0066_0FAEE86351C87D80"/>
Christ, because he is the great God is enough to make Atonement for the greatest sins that ever men were guity of. Suppose they have been guilty of never so many sins, there is Merit enough in Christs Blood to obtain the Remission of them all, because he is the great God. This also is the Reason, why <HI>the Man Christ Iesus</HI> is exalted above all Men and An∣gels: It is because that Man is one person with the Son of God, therefore is he set above all Angels, and Arch-Angels· Angels in heaven are all made subject to him.

<P>Lastly <HI>Let us then give unto the Lord Iesus Christ, that which is due to the great God alone.</HI> Let us give him our very Souls: Prov. 23.26 <HI>Give me thy Heart.</HI> That is the Voice of Christ, thy <HI>Heart,</HI> thy <HI>Soul,</HI> give it to me.

<P>We come now to speak to the latter part of the Doctrine;</P>
<P><HI>Namely,</HI> THat Iesus Christ is our Sa∣viour.</P>
<P>For Clearing the Truth before us, three Particulars may be Enquired i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to.</P>
<P N="1">1. How it does appear that Jesus Christ is a Saviour?</P>
<P N="2">2. What manner of Saviour He is?</P>
<P N="3">3. For whom He is a Saviour?</P>
<P>Q. 1. <HI>How does it appear that Iesus Christ is a Saviour?</HI></P>
<P>Answ· 1. <HI>It is Evident from the Names which are given to him in Scripture.</HI> This Name of SAVIOUR, is given to Him; 2 Pet. 3.18 <HI>Our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ.</HI> Very often in Scripture is he described by this <HI>Name.</HI> Yea, he is called <HI>Salvation</HI> it self: <HI>Luk.</HI> 2 30 <HI>Simeon</HI> said, <HI>Mine Eyes have seen thy Salvation.</HI> Because he had with his Eyes seen Christ, whom he calls Salvation. Therefore the Name of
<PB N="73" REF="000998_0072_0FAEE867D00B4CC0"/>
<HI>Iesus</HI> is given to him. An Angel from hea∣ven, did declare that he should be called by that Name, and for this reason, in that he should be a Saviour. <HI>Mat.</HI> 1.21 The Angel said to <HI>Ioseph</HI> concerning Christ, <HI>Thou shalt call his Name</HI> Jesus, <HI>for he shall Save his People from their Sins.</HI> Jesus signifies a Saviour. It comes from the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word, <HI>Iasha, Salvavit,</HI> as much as to say, He that Saveth. So that Name <HI>Shiloh</HI> is given to him: <HI>Gen.</HI> 49.10 <HI>Vn∣til Shiloh come</HI>: that is until Christ come. <HI>Shiloh</HI> is as much as to say, one that is the Author of tranquility, and safety. And he is called by that Name of a <HI>Redeemer:</HI> Isa· 59 20 <HI>A Redeemer shall come to Zion·</HI> When Christ came into the world, then did a <HI>Redeemer</HI> come to <HI>Zion.</HI> And in the next words to the <HI>Text</HI> before us, it is said, <HI>He gave himself that he might Redeem us from all Iniquity.</HI> And he is called a <HI>Deliverer. Moses</HI> was a Typical <HI>De∣liverer,</HI> whence <HI>Stephen</HI> said of him, Acts 7.35 <HI>That God sent him to be a Ruler, and Deliverer of the People. Moses</HI> was a <HI>Deliverer</HI> from <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and from the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but Christ is a <HI>Deliverer</HI> from the <HI>Pharaoh</HI> of Hell, and the <HI>Egyptians</HI> of Hell. It is from him that we are <HI>Delivered from the Powers of Darkness. Col.</HI> 1.13</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Iesus Christ and he only, is a fit person to be a Saviour for the sinful Children of men.</HI> He
<PB N="74" REF="000998_0073_0FAEE869F74B78C8"/>
that shall be our Saviour, must be both God and Man, which is true concerning Jesus Christ, and of him only.▪ Our Saviour must be God. The great God he is called a <HI>Saviour: Isa.</HI> 43 11 God sayes, <HI>I am the Lord, and besides me there is no Saviour.</HI> And in Isa▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5.21 <HI>He is a Iust God, and a Saviour.</HI> If Jesus Christ had been a man only, he could never have b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en the Saviour of one Soul Nor might we then have trusted to him for salvation: Psal. 146.3 <HI>Trust not in the son of man, in whom there is no help.</HI> If Christ had been the son of man only, there could have been no help, no salvation in him, or to be hoped for by him. It is said, <HI>Ier.</HI> 17.5▪ <HI>Cursed is he that trusteth in man, and that maketh flesh his arm.</HI> But therefore Christ is God. We are by reason of sin, fallen into the hands of mighty Enemies; such as all the men in the world could never have saved one soul out of their hands: Isa. 49.24 <HI>Shall the Prey be taken from the Mighty, or the lawful Captives be delivered?</HI> The Mighty had made a prey of the Souls of men: and no Mortal could take the prey out of the hands of <HI>those Mighty.</HI> Moreover, we were fallen into the hands of <HI>Almighty justice.</HI> And who could save us from the Omnipotent hands? God sayes, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.39 <HI>I wound and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</HI> He then that can deliver out of the hands of Di∣vine
<PB N="75" REF="000998_0074_0FAEE86AD0C3B7B0"/>
Justice, by making Atonement for sin∣ners, must needs be more than a man. And yet 'tis necessary, that <HI>the Saviour</HI> should be <HI>Man,</HI> that so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e might in a way of Suffering, make satisfaction for the sins of men. It was requisite that the same Nature that had sinned, should suffer that so satisfaction may be made for sin: <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.14 <HI>Forasmuch as the Children are partakers of Flesh and Blood, he also himself took part of the same: that through Death, he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil.</HI> He did not take to him the Na∣ture of Angels, but the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of <HI>Abraham</HI>; the same Nature that <HI>Abraham</HI> had. If Christ had been God only, then he could not have suffered for sin▪ for the <HI>God-head</HI> cannot suffer. 'Tis said, Acts 17.79 <HI>We ought not to think that the God-head is like unto Gold or Silver, or Stone graven by art and mans devices.</HI> So we ought not to think <HI>the God-head</HI> can suffer any thing. No▪ Eternity cannot Dye. Therefore God must become Man, that so he might be a Saviour for man. This is according to that Eternal agreement which was between God the Father and the Son, before the world be∣gan; that the Son of God should assume the Nature of man, and be made a sacrifice for the sins of men. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.5 It is said, <HI>Sacrifice and Offering thou wouldst not, but a Body hast thou prepa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for me.</HI> When 'tis said, God had no
<PB N="76" REF="000998_0075_0FAEE86C1F1C10C8"/>
pleasure in sacrifices and offerings, the mean∣ing is, that all the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> and <HI>Offerings</HI> ap∣pointed by the <HI>Mosaical-Law</HI> could never ap∣pease God, or satisfie Divine Justice. Could never purge the Consciences of men from the guilt of sin, it was impossible that they should; therefore a Body is prepared by God for Christ. The Son of God must therefore as∣sume a Humane Body, and a Rational Soul; and that Nature must be made a sacrifice for the sins of men. And for such a Person as the Son of God to be sacrificed, is an infinitely greater thing then if all the men in the whole world had been made a sacrifice. Thus then Jesus Christ is a Saviour, being both God and Man.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Iesus Christ is vested with a Glorious Office, that so He might be our Saviour.</HI> There is <HI>a Sal∣vation-Office</HI> that does belong unto him. And in respect of that, he is said to be not only <HI>Iesus,</HI> but <HI>Christ</HI>: Mat. 16.16 <HI>Thou art Christ the Son of the Living God.</HI> And he is said to be the <HI>Messiah</HI>: Joh. 1.41 <HI>We have found the Messiah, which is by Interpretation Christ. Messi∣ah</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> are words of the same significa∣tion, only <HI>Messiah</HI> is an <HI>Hebrew</HI> word, and <HI>Christ</HI> a <HI>Greek</HI> word; and both of them signi∣fie <HI>the Anointed</HI>: Psal 2.2 <HI>They imagine a vain thing against the Lord, and against His Anoint∣ed.</HI> In the <HI>Hebrew</HI> it is against <HI>His Messiah</HI>▪
<PB N="77" REF="000998_0076_0FAEE86CD35F7518"/>
which in our singing Psalms is well Translated, <HI>against His Christ.</HI> The Priests and Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> who were Anointed with Oyl, were in that respect <HI>Types</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ; who was Anoint∣ed not with any material Oyl, as they were; but with the Oyl of the Spirit of God This <HI>Anointing</HI> does imply both his call <HI>unto,</HI> and fitness <HI>for</HI> his Office. Psal 45.7 <HI>The Lord thy God has Anointed thee with the Oyl of Glad∣ness, above thy Fellows.</HI> In respect of his Office, he is said to be a <HI>Shepherd</HI>: Joh. 10 11 <HI>I am</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>the good Shepherd.</HI> It belongs to a <HI>Shepherd</HI> to save his sheep from Wolves and Devourers. So Christ as the good <HI>Shep∣herd,</HI> has saved his <HI>Elect</HI> from the Devourers of Hell, that would have Destroyed them. In respect of his Office, he is said to be a <HI>Bishop of Souls</HI>: 1 Pet 2.25 <HI>He is the Shepherd and Bishop of our Souls.</HI> A <HI>Bishop</HI> must endeavour to the uttermost of his power, the salvation of the souls of those under his care. And in respect of his Office, he is said to be a <HI>Messenger</HI>: Mal. 3.1 <HI>He is the Messenger of the Covenant.</HI> That Covenant of Grace, which speaks of salvation was made for Christs sake, is confirmed by his Death, and the salvation therein promised, is for his sake also bestow∣ed. Again, on the account of his Office, he is said to be a <HI>Surety.</HI> He is <HI>the Surety of a better Covenant. Heb.</HI> 7 22 He has undertaken
<PB N="78" REF="000998_0077_0FAEE86DAD132770"/>
to perform all that was needful to be done in order to our Salvation; to pay our Debts, and to satisfy the Law for us; therefore is he called a <HI>Surety.</HI> In respect of his Office, he is said to be a <HI>Mediator: Heb.</HI> 12.24 <HI>Iesus the Mediator of the New-Covenant.</HI> He is the Mediator of the New-Covenant, because He doth interpose between God and Man, and in a way of Mediation ob∣tains our salvation. And hence, he is said to be a <HI>Prophet</HI>; and by way of Eminency <HI>That</HI> Prophet: In <HI>Ioh.</HI> 6.14 He is <HI>That P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ophet that should come into the world.</HI> Sinners have Blind Minds, Darkned Understandings: they are out of the way unto salvation, and cannot of them∣selves find the way. But therefore the Pro∣phetical Office of Christ is a <HI>Remedy</HI> against that <HI>Misery.</HI> For Christ as a Prophet has in∣structed us in the <HI>way unto Salvation</HI>; and has declared unto us all that is needful for us to know that we may be saved. The Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> could say, Joh. 4.25 <HI>When the Messiah comes He shall tell us all things.</HI> Christ as the Prophet of His Church, has told us all things, that are necessary to be known. No man needs to know any more, in order to his obtaining Eternal Life, then what Christ as a Prophet has Revealed. The Scriptures are able to make wise unto <HI>Salvation.</HI> Now Christ as the Great Prophet of His Church,
<PB N="79" REF="000998_0078_0FAEE86E4EE26CC0"/>
has given the Scripture to His People. A∣gain, Christ is said to be a <HI>Priest: Heb,</HI> 3·1 He is <HI>the High Priest of our profession. Aa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> was the high Priest of the <HI>Iewish</HI> Profession: <HI>Christ</HI> is the high Priest of our <HI>Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an</HI> Pro∣fession. And he has therefore made Atone∣ment for the sins of His People. Sin has made a breach between God and Man. No doubt when the Devil had caused man to sin, he hoped he had Ruined him for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> question but the holy Angels stood amazed, and looked on man as a lost Creature, until they knew that the Son of God interposed and undertook to be a Priest for them, and to make Atonement for them by being Bruised, that so their sins might be satisfied for. By Him we receive the Atonement, and He is a Propitiation for our sins. It belonged to the Priest also to offer Incense, and to intercede for the People. So has Christ done, and in that way does he perfect our Salvation. <HI>Heb</HI> 7.25 <HI>He is able to Save unto the Vttermost, since he ever Lives to make Intercession.</HI> Christ has also a <HI>Kingly-Office</HI> belonging to Him. The <HI>Iews</HI> when they write of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> are wont to call him, <HI>the King Messiah.</HI> So does the Scripture say of Him that he is a King. Joh. 1.49 <HI>Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</HI> The Son of God is the King and Ruler of the <HI>Vniverse,</HI> but of <HI>Israel</HI> of his
<PB N="80" REF="000998_0079_0FAEE86F0A4662E8"/>
Church, of the People of God, in a peculiar manner. And therefore he is their <HI>Saviour</HI>▪ Isa. 33.22. <HI>The Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, He will Save us.</HI> It belongs to a King to protect his Subjects against their E∣nemies, to save them from those that would Destroy them. So does Christ do: Acts 5.31 <HI>He is a Prince and a Saviour.</HI> Inasmuch as He is a Prince, He is a Saviour. He is <HI>the Prince of Life,</HI> for that he is the Author of Life and Salvation, to those whom God has given to him. And this Office that Christ is vested with, it is God that has called him to it. He is the Christ of God: Hence <HI>Luk.</HI> 2.26 He is called, <HI>the Lords Christ.</HI> So that God has called him to this Office. And he is therefore said to be <HI>sent of God. The Father has sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.</HI> 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4.14 God has given him a commission under the great Seal of Heaven: Joh. 6.27 <HI>Him has God the Fa∣ther Sealed.</HI> Christ did not undertake to be the Prophet of His Church, without a call from God thereunto. Deut 18.18 <HI>I</HI> (sayes God) <HI>will Raise up a Prophet, and will put my words into his Mouth, and he shall speak all that I shall Command him.</HI> Christ is the Prophet there spoken of. Nor did Christ make himself a Priest, without being called of God to that Of∣fice: <HI>Heb.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.4, 5 <HI>No man taketh this Honour to himself, but he that is called of God; so also Christ
<PB N="81" REF="000998_0080_0FAEE87152196088"/>
glorified not himself to be made a High Priest.</HI> He did not interpose in the Controversy be∣tween God and man, until God called him to it. So as to that Office of a King, Christ was called of God unto it. Therefore, Psal. 2.6 God sayes, <HI>I have set my King upon my holy Hill of Sion.</HI> God calls Christ His <HI>King,</HI> as being appointed by Him to that glorious Office of a King, over the Souls of men. There∣fore it is said, Psal. 4.3 <HI>Know that the Lord hath set apart him that is Godly for Himself·</HI> The words are partly indeed to be understood con∣cerning <HI>Davids</HI> being set apart to the King∣ly Office, but principally concerning Christ, who was set apart to be Prophet, Priest and King, God set him apart thereunto. In respect of this Office that Christ is vested with, in or∣der to his being a <HI>Saviour,</HI> He is styled <HI>Gods Servant</HI>: Isa. 42.1 <HI>Behold my Servant, whom I uphold mine Elect, in whom my Soul delighteth.</HI> Gods Servant, for this was the greatest un∣dertaking that could be. And Christ has done the greatest Service for God then ever was, in saving his Elect. <HI>Ioseph</HI> did great service for the King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when he saved the Lives of all his Subjects. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> con∣fessed to him, Gen. 47.25 <HI>Thou hast saved our Lives.</HI> In that <HI>Ioseph,</HI> was a <HI>Type</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> who has done wonderful service for God the King of Heaven; in that He has saved the
<PB N="82" REF="000998_0081_0FAEE8721BB00340"/>
Lives of all His Children, all His Elect. So then we see that Christ is a Saviour on the account of his Office.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Iesus Christ has purchased our Salvation, and therefore he is our Saviour.</HI> That is one way in which Captives are Redeemed, <HI>viz.</HI> when a Price is paid and their Liberty Pur∣chased for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m So it hath been here▪ We were all in miserable Servitude and Slavery, but Christ▪ hath laid down a Price, whereby he hath purchased our Freedo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: 1 Cor. 7.23 <HI>Ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bought with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rice,</HI> sayes the Apostle. With a Price, what was that Price? It must ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds be some great matter: For an Immor∣tal Soul is more worth than all the world. Therefore must it be some great matter that shall Purchase the Redemption and Salvation of Souls. All Men and Creatures in Heaven and in Earth, were not able to lay down a Price sufficient, to Purchase the Redemption of a Soul: Psal. 49.8 <HI>The Redemption of their Soul is precious, and ceaseth forever.</HI> But Christ could do it, &amp; has done it. He has laid down that which is a Price sufficient. He has given that for their <HI>Redemption,</HI> which is worth as much as all the Souls in the world are worth, and infinitely more. For in 1 Tim. 2.6 <HI>He gave Himself a Ransom for many. Himself</HI> is more worth than all the men in the world.
<PB N="83" REF="000998_0082_0FAEE872E56F4468"/>
They said to <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.3 <HI>Thou art worth ten thousand of us.</HI> Christ is more worth than Ten Thousand worlds. And yet he has given Himself to Purchase the salvation of his People. He has given his own Life for it: Mat. 20.28 <HI>He ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Life a Ransom for man.</HI> And who can say what that Life is worth. For whose Life is it? The Apostle <HI>Iohn</HI> tells us, 1 Joh. 3.16 <HI>Hereby percei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e we the Love of God, because he laid down his Life for us.</HI> It is the <HI>Life of God.</HI> Christ has given his own Blood to Purchase our salvati∣on: Acts 20.28 <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Church of God which he has Purchased with his own Blood.</HI> That is which Christ who is the great God, has Pur∣chased with his own Blood. The Blood of a man is a precious thing, of more value then the Blood of all inferiour Creatures. How Precious then is the Blood of that man, who is the Great God? We were in slavery to sin, but Christ by his Precious Blood, has Pur∣chased our Redemption from that Captivity. 1 Pet. 1.19 <HI>Ye were Redeemed from your vain Conversation, not with Silver and Gold, but with the precious Blood of Christ.</HI> We were become the subjects of Satan, but Christ by Death, has Purchased our Deliverance from that mise∣ry: Heb. 2.14, 15 <HI>Through Death he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> destroy∣ed the Devil, and delivered them that were in Bon∣dage.</HI> We were miserably in Debt, and not

able to pay our Debt; but were in the hands of a cruel Jaylor, that would hold us in Pri∣son as long as possibly he might. But Christ Purchased our Liberty by paying the Debt for us. He payed the Debt not to the <HI>Iaylor,</HI> no, but to the supream Judge, who was also our <HI>Creditor</HI>: Eph. 15.2 <HI>He gave himself an Offer∣ing to God.</HI> Christ has been offered to God.

So has the Right-hand of Christ, dash∣ed in pieces the Enemies of our salvation. There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not one Enemy but Christ has sub∣dued it. Sin is the worst Enemy we have, and Christ has caused it to be Condemned: Rom. 8.3 <HI>He has Condemned Sin.</HI> By shed∣ding his Blood, he has caused sin to be Con∣demned. And then by the Power of his Al∣mighty Spirit, he subdues the sins of his People. Mic. 7.19 <HI>Thou wilt subdue our Iniquities, and wilt cast our Sins into the depth of the Sea. Pha∣raoh</HI> and his Host were subdued by being cast into the depth of the Sea. Thus does Christ by his Almighty power, subdue the iniquities of his People. He Redeems us not from the <HI>Damnation</HI> of sin only, but from the <HI>Dominion</HI>

They be nothing before his Al∣mighty Power: Luk. 11.21, 22 <HI>The strong man keeps his Palace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill a stronger then he comes.</HI> The <HI>strong man</HI> there spoken of is <HI>Satan</HI>; and the stronger then he is <HI>Christ</HI>: who can overc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Satan and dispossess him, and subdue him when he will. Hence the Disciples came with great joy to Christ saying, Luk. 10.17 <HI>Lord, even the Devils are subject to us through thy Name</HI>; that is to say, through thy Power. The Devils cannot stand before the Almighty Power of Christ. He then has overcome that

great Enemy, yea all the Powers of Darkness. Hence 'tis that Christ is represented in Scrip∣ture, as a <HI>Mighty Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rior.</HI> Psal. 45.3 <HI>Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh, O most Mighty.</HI> The words are spoken and to be understood of Christ. He is compared to a <HI>Great General. Ioshua</HI> saw a man appearing over against him with a drawn Sword in his hand, and he went to him, <HI>Iosh</HI> 5.13 and said, <HI>Art thou for us, or for our Ad∣versaries? Nay,</HI> (sayes he) <HI>but as Captain of the Host of the Lord am I come.</HI> And <HI>Ioshua</HI> fell on his Face to the Earth, and worshiped him. For he then perceived that the person who appeared to him, was Christ the Son of God, that was to come into the world as <HI>the Captain of our Salvation. Heb.</HI> 2.10 The Glo∣ry of our Salvation is all owing to Him that is our Captain General. If we had not had such a <HI>Captain,</HI> such a <HI>Lord-General,</HI> we should never have <HI>been</HI> Saved, but our Enemies would have Ruin'd us for ever. But Christ having overcome them all, is therefore represented as a <HI>Conquerer,</HI> and as one that does Triumph after his Victory. The Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> repre∣sents him as having on him the Glorious ap∣parrel of a <HI>Conquerer,</HI> returning from his Victo∣ry with his Garments sprinkled with the Blood of his Enemies. <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.1 And the Apostle sayes, Col. 2.15 <HI>He has spoiled Principalities and Powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing

over them in it.</HI> He has spoiled them, taken away the Prey from them, and Triumph'd o∣ver them, made Captives of them that had made Captives of his People: Eph. 4.8 <HI>He has led captivity captive. Believers</HI> are said to be <HI>Conquerers</HI> But 'tis through Christ▪ that they overcome, Rom. 8.37▪ <HI>We are more then Conquerers through him that hath Loved us.</HI> 'Tis through him. So then we see that Jesus Christ is a Saviour.</P>

It is said, <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.9 That Christ <HI>is the Author of Salvation to all that Obey him.</HI> But he is not an Author of salvation to them that continue in their Disobedience. What will become of them, when the Great God our Saviour shall Appear to Judge the world?

There are Millions that know not God that will Perish in that day. But above others such as Obey not the Gospel, they know God, and know Christ, as to External knowledge, and Revelation of him, but they <HI>Obey not the Gospel.</HI> Oh! that there were not one soul here this Day concerned in what I am now speaking. That there were not one soul that did Disobey the Gospel, and the Voice of God and Christ therein. But my Friends, does not the Gospel require you to Believe? Is not this Gods Commandment, that we should Believe in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ? The great Commandment of the Gospel is, that men should go to Christ, give themselves unto him; look up to him, and depend on him for Pardon, Life, Grace, yea for all that their souls stand in need of. Well, then they that remain in a state of Unbelief cannot be saved. They are in a state of Damnati∣on, and not of Salvation. <HI>He that Believes not is Condemned already.</HI> He is under a Sentance of Condemnation, and that sentance will <HI>most</HI> certainly be Executed upon him, if he con∣tinues in his Unbelief.

A Question is <HI>Propounded,</HI> but is not <HI>Answered,</HI> nor can be; How great? <HI>It is laid up</HI>; where? In heaven. How great is that Salvation, that Blessedness?

And how are we indebted to Him? It cost Christ dear to obtain this Sal∣vation for us: He has obtain'd it in no easie way.

shall see him, and they shall <HI>All</HI> know who he is. Rev. 1.7 <HI>He comes in the Clouds o heaven, and every Eye shall see him, and they also that Pierced him.</HI> Not only the <HI>Iews,</HI> but <HI>all</HI> others shall see him then. When Christ came <HI>First</HI> into the world, the sins of his People were <HI>imputed</HI> to him, and then he Dyed to make Atonement for sin. It will not be so at his <HI>Second</HI> Coming. <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.28 <HI>He shall Appear the Second time without Sin</HI>: without having any sin <HI>imputed</HI> to him. At his first coming, his work was to <HI>Save</HI> his people by Dying for them. God sent his Son into the world, to be a Pro∣pitiation for our sins. But his second coming shall be to <HI>Iudge</HI> the world. Thus both the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Second Appearing</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, was by the Spirit of God Revealed un∣to the Prophets. 1 Pet. 1.11 <HI>The Spirit which was in them did testifie before hand, conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning the Sufferings of Christ, and of the Glory that should follow.</HI> That implyes a <HI>Two-fold</HI> coming of Christ▪ Although in the <HI>Old-Testament,</HI> both these Appearings are spoken of without any express Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinction of a <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Secon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> coming; nevertheless that is asserted which does necessarily imply it. For the Prophets speak of him as one that shall come to Dy for the sins of his People. <HI>Daniel</HI> sayes, <HI>that the Messiah shall be cut off</HI>; and yet he speaks of him as one that shall come in <HI>the Clouds of
<PB N="119" REF="000998_0118_0FAEF0DAEA54BB20"/>
heaven to Iudge the world</HI>; which implyes two comings. So the Prophet <HI>Zechariah,</HI> speaks of the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s being Crucified; and also that he shall come with all his Saints. These things Evidently imply a <HI>Two-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old coming</HI> of Christ. Yea, this Gospel was Preached in the very <HI>First Ages</HI> of the world. It was then Revealed that the Son of God should be made of a Woman, and that he should be bruised to Death, in order to the Salvation of his people. And yet, in the Age before the Flood, it was Revealed that he should come to <HI>judge the world.</HI> So did <HI>Enoch</HI> Prophesy above <HI>Four Thousand Years</HI> ago, as the Apostle <HI>Iude</HI> observes, 14, 15 <HI>verses: Enoch Prophesied, saying, that the Lord should come with Ten Thousand of his Saints, to Execu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e judgment.</HI> So that this <HI>Two-fold Appearing</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, is held forth unto us in the Scriptures, both of the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New-Testament.</HI></P>

All the Promises made unto the People of God, shall in that Day receive their full ac∣complishment.
<PB N="128" REF="000998_0127_0FAEF0E551332AF0"/>
The Scripture is full of Pro∣mises, and those Promises shall all of them be performed to the utmost, in the Day of Christs Appearing. For what is it that the Lord hath Promised to Believers?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He has Promised that they shall have a Glorious Resurrection unto Eternal Life.</HI> That their Dead bodies shall Rise again. Christ proved against the <HI>Sadduces</HI> that there shall be a Resurrection of the Dead, because of the Co∣venant of God. Mat. 22.31 <HI>As touching the Re∣surrection of the Dead, have you not heard that God said,</HI> (He said it to <HI>Moses</HI> in the Bush) <HI>I am the God of</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob; <HI>he is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living.</HI> And therefore because of the Covenant, <HI>Abra∣ham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> must Rise out of their Graves. Believers have given themselves to God, Body and Soul; they have not only given their Souls but their Bodies also to Christ. So then, God is in Covenant with them in respect of their bodies, as well as of their souls. As for the Soul, that is immortal, and by vertue of the Covenant their Bodies that are Dead, shall be Raised to Life again. And this is a great part of that Blessedness which believers hope for. They have hope towards God that there shall be a Resurrection from the Dead▪ Sayes <HI>Paul, for the hope of the Resurrection of
<PB N="129" REF="000998_0128_0FAEF0E62BB646F0"/>
the Dead am I called in Question.</HI> At the Resurrection, their bodies shall undergo a bles∣sed glorious Change; they shall be made like to the Glorious body of the Son of God. Their bodies shall then be freed from all such Evils as at present they are subject unto. They shall never endure any Pain more, they shall never be subject to any Disease in the least any more. Aye, and they shall not be subject to Mortality any more. Luk. 20 26 <HI>The Children of the Resurrection are equal to the Angels of God, neither can they Dye any more.</HI> Their bodies are then so Immortalized as that they cannot Dy any more. And this Blessedness they shall have at the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore <HI>Iob</HI> sayes, Job 19.25 <HI>I know that my Redeemer shall stand on the Earth at the latter Day.</HI> And sayes he, <HI>although worms shall after my skin destroy this Body, yet in my Flesh I shall see God, at the latter day.</HI> Now that Latter Day is the same with the Day of the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then is it that <HI>Iob</HI> and all be∣lievers shall have a Glorious Resurrection vouchsafed to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lord has Promised that all their Obe∣dience shall be Rewarded.</HI> They have not done any service for God and Christ, but it shall have a Glorious Reward; though never so

Much more then, they that have done great services for the Lord Jesus Christ shall be Gloriously Rewarded in that Day.

In that Day he shall shine as the Stars for ever &amp; ever. So shall they that have Suffered for the Name of Christ: That man that has been Reproach∣ed for his Faithfulness to the Interest of Christ, that man that▪ has been Reviled, and Evil spoken of for standing up in the cause of Christ, shall have a great Reward. <HI>Blessed are you</HI> sayes Christ, <HI>when men Reproach you and speak all manner of Evil of you, Great shall be your Reward.</HI> And when shall they have this reward? It shall be at the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. Rev. 22.12 <HI>Behold I come,</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>and my Reward is with me.</HI> When Christ comes He brings his blessed Reward along with him.

have great reason to Long for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Day o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Iudg∣ment.</HI> To long for that Day of the Glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious Appearing of the Great God our Saviour Jesus Christ. As the Saints of Old did long for the First Coming of Christ. <HI>Abraham</HI> by Faith saw that Day, and was glad; and many Prophets and Righteous men desired to see it. So Be∣lievers should long for the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Pet. 3.12 <HI>Looking for and Hatning to the Coming of the Day of God.</HI> You must no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only Look for, not only Believe that such a Day will come, but you must Hasten to it, that is by earnest desires, by longing wishes; we should Pray for the coming of this Day. Thus Christ has taught us to Pray, <HI>Thy Kingdom Come.</HI> We must therefore Pray for the Day of Judgment. For the Kingdom of Christ will not come in all the Glory of it, before that Blessed Day. And when we Pray, <HI>Thy Will be done on Earth as in Heaven,</HI> we Pray for the Day of Judgment. For then and not till then will the Will of God be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Then will the Saints that shall <HI>come down from Heaven,</HI> the Saints in the <HI>New-Ierusalem</HI> do the Will of God with as much Perfection on Earth, as now it is done in Heaven. So then, we are to Pray for this Coming of the Lord. And great reason Believers have so to do, because of that perfect Salvation which they shall then
<PB N="136" REF="000998_0135_0FAEF0EF39A1A598"/>
be made partakers of. By Hope we are Saved. We hope for a perfect Salvation <HI>in that Day,</HI> therefore should long for that Day. 1 Pet. 1 13. <HI>Hoping for the Grace that shall be brought to you at the Revelation of Iesus Christ.</HI> Grace, that is Glory proceeding from the meer Grace of God, without any Merit of ours, shall be brought to us at the Revelation of Jesus Christ. When H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be Reveal'd from Heaven, we shall be Immortal then. Suppose w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Die and go to the Grave before this Glo∣rious Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ, yet He will R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise us up in that Day to a blessed Immort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llity. Or, suppose Christ shall come quickly, as he will; but suppose so quickly as to be here while we are yet alive, when the Son of God comes down to judge the Earth, we shall in one Moment be made Im∣mortal. All Believers shan't Die that shall be found alive at the appearing of Christ, <HI>but all shall be Changed in a Moment, in the twinkling of an Eye.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.51, 52. A Glorious Change will pass on them as to their Bodies, there∣fore they have cause to Long for this Blessed Day.</P>

<P><HI>Will the Appearing of the Lord Iesus Christ be a Blessed Day to Believers, what then will it be
<PB N="137" REF="000998_0136_0FAEF0EFD500C520"/>
to Vnbelievers?</HI> Unto all Christless Sinners, to those whom Christ at His coming shall find without an Interest in him▪ it will be a Ter∣rible Day to them. A Dreadful day it was when the Lord came down on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> it was a Day of Blackness, and Darkness and Tempest; the Mountain shook and was all on a light Fire. Well, but when the Son of God comes down from Heaven to judge those that have Transgressed that Law, what a Terrible Day will it be? 2 Cor. 5.11 <HI>We knowing the Terror of the Lord perswade men.</HI> The Day of judgment is called, <HI>the Terror of the Lord.</HI> No Tongue is able to Express, no Heart is able to Conceive <HI>the Terror</HI> of that Day. For when the Lord Jesus Christ the Great God and our Saviour shall Appear, all men must come before His Judgment-Seat: And as for Christless Sinners, their sins shall be discovered in the hearing of Heaven and Earth. All the world will hear what secret sins they have been guilty of Eccles. 12.14. <HI>God will bring every work with every secret thing into Iudgment, whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</HI> All the evil all the sins that wretched Creatures have committed in seeret, will then be told of. Many a Guilty sinner would be ashamed to shew his Head among men, if what he has done in secret should be told and spoken of before the world. Well, but at this Day of
<PB N="138" REF="000998_0137_0FAEF0F0992608B8"/>
Christs Appearing, all the World shall be told of thy secret abominations, thy secret filthiness, and secret thefts will then be known. Now Sinners think to hide them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>es by telling a Lye; Aye, but it will be in vain in that Day to go about to hide any thing from the Infinite and Omniscient God. And there will then be a Sentence passed upon all Christless Sinners, by the Mouth of the Lord Himself. And what will that Sentence be? It may make the Rocks to rend to hear what it shall be. <HI>They shall be Sentenced to be Burnt to Death,</HI> and that they shall continue in those Ever∣lasting Burnings World without end. That is the Sentence Mat. 25.41. <HI>Then shall the King say,</HI> (the King <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Son of God he is the King of the world, He will say) <HI>Depart ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire.</HI> Will not this be a Dreadful day to Sinners? And as sure as the Sentence is passed, Execution will fol∣low. For there is no Appeal from this Sen∣tence to an higher Court. And the Judge by a words speaking, can cause the Executi∣on to be done; He has Thousands and Milli∣ons of Angels to Execute His Commands, and to do His Pleasure; more Angels then there are Men in the world, one of which is able to deal with Millions of men. Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st will in that Day come with all his Angels, and
<PB N="139" REF="000998_0138_0FAEF0F186ED21E0"/>
the Mighty Angels shall bind sinners up in Bundles, and throw them into the Fire.</P>

<P>Lastly, <HI>Oh! Let us make sure that we be Prepared for this Coming of Christ.</HI> And there∣fore, let us often be thinking of it. Let this Glorious Day often come into our minds. O Sinner often think with thy self, if Christ should come down from Heaven this Night, what account have I to give to him? If He should call me before His Judgment-Seat this Night, what account can I give of what I have done for God and Christ in the world? Think, if the Lord Jesus Christ should come down from Heaven this day, what wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld He say to me? Would He say to me, <HI>Come thou Blessed?</HI> Or, would he not say to me, <HI>Away thou Cursed?</HI> And remember as Death leaves us, so will the Judgment which will be at the Appearing of our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> find us. We have no time to prepare for it, but while we live in this world. Heb. 9.27. <HI>It is ap∣pointed unto men once to Dye, but after this the Iudgment.</HI> There will be a General judgment, but first a Particular judgment; So soon as ever t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Immortal Soul of a sinner is parted from his Body, then a <HI>Iudgment</HI> is passed on him, and that Judgment will be proclamed at the
<PB N="140" REF="000998_0139_0FAEF0F25A0992B8"/>
Last Day, though now none knows what it is. And when the soul is separated from the body, either Christ will command His Angels to conduct that Soul to Glory in Heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or permit Devils to carry it to the place of Tor∣ment. Oh, then Prepare for this Coming, since <HI>Iudgment</HI> will find us as <HI>Death</HI> leaves us. God calls aloud to us all to Prepare, yea, to Young People as well as others. Does not God take away some of them, and that sud∣denly? In the week past, Three Young Men as likely to live as any here this day, over Night were Well, and Dead the next day. There is a Voice of the Lord in that awful stroak of his. And what does the Lord say? The Voice of God unto you all is, Oh! Let every one be alwayes Prepared for the Ap∣pearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. Every one, Young and Old, be alwayes Prepared for <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Iudgment.</HI> Oh that Young Per∣sons would think of that and do accordingly. And remember, that as Judgment leaves us, so must we be to all Eternity. <HI>Hebr.</HI> 6.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ We read of <HI>Eternal Iudgment</HI>; because at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ, men shall be Sentenced to an Eternal state of Happiness or of Misery. They must then be Sentenced either to Eternal Weal or to Eter∣nal Woe. If <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Iudgment</HI> find us in Christ, then shall we inherit Eternal Life;
<PB N="141" REF="000998_0140_0FAEF0F2CCF33368"/>
but if they find us out of Christ, then must we go away from His presence into Everlast∣ing Punishment. Oh then think of these things. And if we would be Prepared for the appearing of Christ, we must make thorough work of it in Repentanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Sin, in turning from sin to God. Acts 17.31. <HI>Now God commands all men eve∣ry where to Repent, because He has Appointed a Day wherein He will Iudge the World by the Man whom He has Ordained.</HI> In that Day if men be found among the Impenitent ones it will be a sad Day to them: better thou hadst never been Born. Therefore Sinner, Repent of every sin that thou hast been Guilty of. Live not another day in any sin: For believe it from the Lord, if there be any one Sin that Death shall come on thee before thou hast Re∣pented of that Sin, at the Day of Judgment thou wilt wish thou never hadst been Born. And Oh, let us make sure that we be found in Christ▪ That was the Apostles great care, that <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Iudgment</HI> might find him in Christ. Nothing else will stand a Man in stead in the Day of His appearing. It is not being found in the Church that will stand you in stead at that Day. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being found among Civil Moral men: at that Day many will be found among such, that will not be found in Christ at all. And if thou art not
<PB N="142" REF="000998_0141_0FAEF0F6F30F0B80"/>
found in Christ, <HI>that Day</HI> will be a Dismal Day to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> Let us endeavour to be like Jesus Christ. If we are like Him, when He appears we shall be more like Him. If we are lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Him now in respect of Grace, we shall be like Him then in respect of Glory. Christ did alwayes the things that please God: If there be such an Heart in us, then may we Think of the Day of Judgment with Transports of Joy. 1. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4.17. <HI>We may have Boldness in the Day of Iudgment; because as He is, so are we in this world.</HI></P>
