<HEAD>John 6.37. —And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Chapter we have the sacred Story of Christ's feeding five Thousand men with five Loaves and two Fishes, together with the Consequents of that Miracle. One Effect of it was, that many followed Christ, hoping that He would have fed them again in a way <HI>extraordinary.</HI> The Lord Christ did re∣prehend them for their vanity, in desiring to live an idle life, and then hoping that they should be fed by Miracle. He also took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to exhort them to labour after meat for their souls: He does therefore set forth the excellency of spiritual bread, shewing how much it does transcend the Manna which the Children of Israel lived upon in the Wil¦Wilderness;
<PB N="2" REF="000415_0007_0FA5B663B9F0D708"/>
thereupon the <HI>Iews</HI> desired that they might alwayes feed upon that bread <HI>ver.</HI> 34. <HI>Then said they to Him, Lord evermore give us this bread.</HI> It is evident that they had car∣nal imaginations in their minds still, dreaming of bread for their bodies, which might cause them to live a long time in this world. There∣fore in answer to that request of theirs, the Lord Jesus Christ does both inform and re∣prove them.</P>
<P N="1">1. He informs them, What that Bread of life which He spake of, is, and what it is to eat thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> that He Himself is that Bread, and that to beleeve on Him, is to eat there∣of, <HI>ver.</HI> 35.</P>
<P N="2">2. He reproveth them for their Unbelief, <HI>ver.</HI> 36. <HI>But I say unto you, that you also have seen me and beleeve no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> They had seen Christ with bodily eyes, and they had seen his <HI>Mira∣cles</HI> too, and yet they had not seen Him with an eye of Faith; they did not close with Him as the true <HI>Messiah,</HI> as the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World.</P>
<P>In this verse there are two things asserted,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Reason why some that have the out∣ward means of Faith, yet never beleeve. It is because they are not by the Father given to Christ. All <HI>such</HI> shall <HI>first</HI> or <HI>last</HI> believe on Him.
<PB N="3" REF="000415_0008_0FA5B663E9A51260"/>
But if men be not given to Christ, let them hear never such sermons preached, nay, tho never such Miracles should be wrought before their eyes, they will not beleeve.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another thing asserted in this verse, is, the great benefit which does follow upon com∣ing to Christ as in the words before us to in∣sist on; the meaning of which may be spoken unto under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from them, which is,</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>That if any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, whoever he be, shall indeed come unto Iesus Christ, He will in no wis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cast him out.</HI></P>
<P>For the clearing of this Doctrine, three things may be enquired into,</P>
<P N="1">1. Who are Comers unto Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. What is imply'd in this expression, that <HI>Christ will in no wise cast him out that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. How it does appear that Christ will in no wise doe so.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>Who are Comers to Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> what is meant by coming to Him?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. <HI>The Comer to Christ is the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Beleever.</HI> In the thirty fifth verse of the Chapter, Christ saith <HI>He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</HI> So in <HI>ver.</HI> 44, 45, 65, Believing on Christ, is called a coming to Him. Ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="4" REF="000415_0009_0FA5B6648A008048"/>
are various Metaphors whereby Faith is set forth in the Scripture: There is the <HI>Eye</HI> of Faith, hence Beleeving is called a <HI>Looking</HI> on Christ <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. There is the <HI>Ear</HI> of Faith, so Beleeving is called <HI>Hearing; Hear and your souls shall live.</HI> there is the <HI>Mouth</HI> of Faith, thus Beleeving is expressed by that of <HI>eating</HI> Christ, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 6.57. <HI>He that</HI> eateth <HI>me shall live by me.</HI> There is the <HI>Hand</HI> of Faith, thence Beleeving is said to be a <HI>Receiving</HI> of Christ, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1▪12. And there is the <HI>Foot</HI> of Faith, thence Beleeving <HI>on</HI> Christ is said to be a Going <HI>to</HI> him and Coming <HI>to</HI> him: As Vnbeliefe is expressed by that of <HI>not</HI> coming to Him <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me that you might have life. i. e.</HI> you will not <HI>beleive.</HI> And Unbeleif is said to be a Departing from the Lord, <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.12. so Faith is Coming to Him; Not a meer <HI>bodily</HI> Coming to Christ, for so these <HI>Capernaits</HI> and many others came to him, who had no true faith; but a coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him with the <HI>Soul.</HI> The Gospel calls upon men to forsake all for Christ, he whose heart and soul does obey that Call is a true Believer. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Believer <HI>Cometh to Christ as the most excellent Person his soul can desire.</HI> 1. <HI>Pet</HI> 2.7. <HI>To you that believe He is precious.</HI> The Jews
<PB N="5" REF="000415_0010_0FA5B6680CF70FB0"/>
followed Christ for his Loaves, and not for his Person, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 6.26. Notwithstanding the Mira∣cles done by Christ, which were enough to convince any one that he is the Son of God; yet they did not beleeve Him to be so, and therefore were not right Followers <HI>of</HI> him, or Comers <HI>to</HI> Him. When God brings a man home to Christ, He lets him see that surpassing Excellency in his Person, as to cause the soul to fall in love with Him, and to choose Christ rather than any other person. <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.9, 10, 16. <HI>What is thy beloved more than anothers beloved? my beloved is the chiefest among ten thousand, yea he is altogether lovely.</HI> This is the Language of the real comer to Christ▪ The beleeving soul seeth Christ to be a love∣ly Christ indeed, and therefore cometh <HI>to</HI> Him as being enamoured <HI>with</HI> Him. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 6.4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>He that seeth the Son and beleeveth on him.</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n must <HI>see</HI> a beauty and excellency in the Son of God, or they will not beleeve on Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Beleever <HI>cometh to Christ for Salva∣tion.</HI> He seeth that Christ is in himself <HI>lovely</HI>; and from that consideration goeth to Him. Moreover, he seeth all that life and Salvation in Christ which his soul stands in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of, and therefore cometh to Him. It's true (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> intimated) that in closing with Christ, respect is to be had to His Person, and not to His be∣benefits
<PB N="6" REF="000415_0011_0FA5B669529C82D8"/>
only. Nevertheless a man in Com∣ing to Christ <HI>may</HI> and should have respect to his own Salvation. It is a very needless scru∣ple which some have concerning their Com∣ing to Christ, as if it were not right, because <HI>Desire of Salvation puts them upon it</HI>; so it <HI>may</HI> be, and so it <HI>should</HI> be. Christ Himself calls upon men from that very Consideration to come unto Him. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 7.37. <HI>If any man thirst let him com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> A man <HI>may</HI> and <HI>should</HI> come to Christ that so he may drink, that he may <HI>from</HI> and <HI>by</HI> Christ receive the waters of life for his soul. The Believer co∣meth to Christ as to a Priest, who has by the Sacrifice of himself purchased life for every comer to him. He looketh for Reconciliation with God only by the Sacrifice which Christ has offer'd for that end: He casts his soul and all the eternal Concerns thereof, upon the Me∣rit and Mediation of Jesus Christ. He look∣eth for all Acceptance with God, for the Pardon of all sins, for eternal life in another world, for the alone sake of Christ and <HI>His</HI> Righteousness; thus does he come to Him.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Beleever <HI>cometh to Christ to be</HI> In∣structed <HI>by Him.</HI> Unto this the words of my Text have a peculiar respect. <HI>He that cometh to me</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>b. e.</HI> he that cometh to
<PB N="7" REF="000415_0012_0FA5B669D7E72BD0"/>
me to be my Scholar, my Disciple, as long as he is really willing to learn of me, I will not turn him out of doors. When the woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> acquainted the Citizens that she had met with one who told her all things that ev∣er she did, they went out of the City and came to Him. Thus 'tis with the Beleever; he has heard report of Christ's being the great Pro∣phet of God, and therefore he cometh to Him for instruction: he believes that Christ knowes the mind of God <HI>fully,</HI> and he is willing that Christ should reveal unto him whatever God would have him to beleeve or to practise in order to Salvation. His soul thirsteth after the wholsome waters of Tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, and he comes to Christ that he may receive thereof. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa.</HI> 55.1. This then is implyed in <HI>Coming</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, even a Closing with Him in respe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of His <HI>prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ical</HI> Office, a being subject to the Teach∣ings of His Word and Spirit.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Beleever <HI>cometh to Christ to be</HI> ruled <HI>by him</HI>▪ Many are ready to declare their willing∣ness to have Christ to be their Saviour, who have no mind to have Him to be their <HI>Ruler</HI>; They do not desire to be under the strict and holy Government of Christ, whereas true Faith implies a closing with Christ in respe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of his <HI>Kingly</HI> Office. Hence tis expressed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>receiving Christ Iesus the</HI> Lord. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.6.
<PB N="8" REF="000415_0013_0FA5B66B64941708"/>
He that cometh to Christ with an unfeigned desire to be His Servant, and a Resolution to comply with all His holy commands, is such a Comer to Him as He will in no wise cast out. <HI>Luk.</HI> 6.46. <HI>Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings and doeth them.</HI> Hence beleevers are styled the Servants of Christ. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.22. <HI>Gal,</HI> 1.10. There is a Covenant between Christ and them, as there is a Covenant be∣tween Master and Servant. Beleevers are under a Promise, yea, an <HI>Oath</HI> of Fidelity to Christ, to be <HI>His,</HI> and <HI>His only,</HI> and <HI>His for∣ever.</HI></P>
<P>We proceed therefore to the <HI>second</HI> Inquiry, <HI>VIZ.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What is implyed in this Expression, that Christ will in no wise cast him out that comes to Him?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. <HI>There is more implyed than is plainly expressed in these words.</HI> Tho the expression is negative, yet positive Good is conteined there∣in. In general when it is said <HI>I will in no wise cast him out,</HI> the meaning is, I will give him all the kind entertainment which his soul can desire. He shall have all the Good which a Disciple of Christ can expect.</P>
<P>More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>He that comes to Christ, the Lord Iesus will</HI> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>concile <HI>him to God.</HI> He undertaketh for
<PB N="9" REF="000415_0014_0FA5B66C27A9F228"/>
any man, for every man that shall come to Him, to make his peace with God. Suppose a sinner to have been guilty of never so many Crimes and Provocations, if he cometh to Christ, He will bring him into God's Favour▪ For He has by his death made Atonement for sins, and obtained Reconciliation for Sinners; and whoever cometh to Him, has an Interest in all the Mercy purchased by His Death. And Christ by his Intercession does commend the Comer to Him, unto the Favour of God. He saith before God the Father, This sinner is one of them that I dyed for, and therefore do Thou for my sake forgive all his Sins, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e reconciled to his soul.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If men come to Christ, He will accept them under His Instruction.</HI> He will not refuse to admit them into His School, He will in no wise shut the doors of His House against them in that respect. Therefore He saith, <HI>Come to me and</HI> learn. <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28, 29. They that come to Him, He will learn them. Christ speaketh by <HI>David,</HI> saying, <HI>come to me, you Children, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> Psal. 34.11. It is a blessed thing to be received into Christ's School, to become the Disciple of such a Master, the Scholar of such a Teacher; yet this blessedness belongs to every one that cometh to Christ. Hence Wis∣Wisdome
<PB N="10" REF="000415_0015_0FA5B66D0843B130"/>
speaketh as <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.32. <HI>Hearken to me O ye Children, for blessed are they that keep my wayes, hear Instruction and be wise, and refuse it not, blessed is the man that beareth me, watch∣ing dayly at my gates, waiting at the posts, of my doors.</HI> They that come to Christ with A sin∣cere desire to be instructed by Him, He will teach them all things which are needful for them to know in order to Life and Salvati∣on. 1. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2.20.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>If men come to Christ, He will take them under His Protection.</HI> They that have a true desire to be His subjects, and to have their souls secured under the wings of His Power, it shall be so. He will gather them under <HI>His wings,</HI> Mat. 23, 37.

Christ is a Protector to them that resort unto Him. When <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iather</HI> came to <HI>David,</HI> he said to

him, <HI>Abide thou with me, fear not, with me thou shalt be in safeguard.</HI> 1. Sam. 22.23. They that fled to <HI>David</HI> were safe from the fury of <HI>Saul</HI>; so they that come to Christ, are safe from the rage of Satan, who does per∣secute their souls.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>They that come to Christ, He will never cast them out of his favour, but bring them safe to Heaven at l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st.</HI> Hence Christ does not only say, I will not cast him out that comes to me, but I will <HI>in no wise</HI> do it.

<P>Quest. 3. <HI>But how does it appear that Christ will in no wise cast him out that cometh to him?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>If Christ should cast any out that come to him, he should act contrary to the will of his Father,</HI> which he never did, and we may besure he never will do. If a man cometh to Christ, it is the Father that draweth him. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 6.44. <HI>No man can come to me except the</HI> Father <HI>which hath sent me draw him.</HI> Now if when a soul come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to Christ, he should be re∣jected by him, the Father would draw one way and Christ draw another way, which can not be. Christ speaking to God the Father, saith, <HI>Thou and I, we are one. Ioh.</HI> 17.22. The Father, and Christ as Mediatour are one in respect of Will and Design; they both will and design the same thing. Therefore Christ himself does by this Argument pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that he will not cast him out that cometh to him Wherefore in the next words he sayth, <HI>For I came down from Heaven not to doe mine own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but the Will of him that sent me▪ and this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Fathers Will which hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, that of all which he hath given me, I should l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se nothing.</HI> If Christ came into the world to do the
<PB N="13" REF="000415_0018_0FA5B66F20AE8808"/>
Will of God, and this be the Will of God, that he should not lose so much as one of them that are given to him; we may conclude, that no Comer <HI>to</HI> him, shall be rejected <HI>by</HI> him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Grace of the Lord Iesus, the good∣ness of his nature is such, as that he will in no wise cast out them that come to him.</HI> He is of a most gracious Disposition, and therefore rea∣dy to accept of returning sinners <HI>Ioel</HI> 2.13. <HI>Turn ye unto the Lord your God, for He is gra∣cious and merciful.</HI> Hence if the greatest sin∣ners in the world should come unto the Lord Jesus with an heart really desirous to be his Disciples, he will not cast them out. <HI>Paul</HI> before his Conversion had bin a Blasphemer &amp; a Persecutor of Christ &amp; his Church, and ve∣ry injurious both to God and man, yet when he was brought to submit himself unto Christ, and to say, <HI>Lord what wilt thou have me to do,</HI> the Lord would in no wise cast him out. why? <HI>The Grace of our Lord</HI> (i. e. of our Lord Je∣sus Christ) <HI>was exceeding abundant.</HI> 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.13.14. There is Grace and abundant Grace, yea <HI>exceeding</HI> abundant Grace in the Lord Jesus. Therefore if any man come to him, he will in no wise cast him out.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Christ did never yet cast out any that came to Him.</HI> We read of many in the Gospel that
<PB N="14" REF="000415_0019_0FA5B66FE00192B0"/>
came to Christ for help and healing as to their bodies, but we do not read of so much as <HI>one</HI> whom he would not have compassion on. In∣deed he <HI>made</HI> as if he would have rejected the Woman of <HI>Canaan</HI> when she came to him, but he never intended it, only was willing to try her Faith: And why was this? but to let us know that if men come to Christ with their souls, they shall surely find acceptance with him. Many have come to Christ, yea, many <HI>thousands</HI> but he never rejected any one of them. Tho some of them which came to Christ, were such as one would have thought he would never have given entertainment to, having been the vilest wretches in the world; yet when they came to Christ with a true de∣sire to be his Disciples, he never did reject so much as one of them; therefore we may con∣clude he never will do so.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Christ dyed for those that shall come to him.</HI> Therefore he will in no wise cast them out. If God has given to a man a heart to come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ, he may be sure that Christ hath dyed for him. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 12.32. <HI>And I, if I be lif∣ted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</HI> If a soul be drawn to Christ, 'tis certain that Christ was lifted up on the Cross, there to bleed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> die for the salvation of that very soul. And
<PB N="15" REF="000415_0020_0FA5B670B2EF4E80"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Christ has loved him, so as to dye for him, he will never cast him out. Sinners may look upon Christ dying on the Cross, and see him with his armes open, ready to embrace them.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Christ does invite and call upon Sinners to come to him.</HI> If a man does invite another to come to his house, will he thrust him out of doors when he does come? And shall we then think that the blessed <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> will do so? When he was on the earth, he did personally invite Sinners to come to him. See a glorious Scripture for this, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 7.37. <HI>In the last day, the great day of the feast, Iesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.</HI> If <HI>any</HI> man (saith Christ) be he who he will, <HI>if any man</HI> desireth the waters of life for his soul, let him come to me he shall be welcome. Christ was willing that all should know this; therefore he went into the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣ple to proclaim it, and that on the <HI>feast,</HI> and on the <HI>last</HI> day of the feast, when there wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the greatest Concourse of People, <HI>and he stood</HI> that he might be seen of all, and <HI>cryed,</HI> that he might be heard of all, Come to me, saith Christ, any man that has a <HI>Thirst,</HI> a de∣sire after Salvation. And now Christ is gone to Heaven he calls from <HI>that</HI> Temple, and bids Sinners come to him▪ <HI>Heb.</HI> 25. <HI>See that

ye refuse not him that speaketh, for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven.</HI> He inviteth and calls Sinners to come to him by his written Word, the <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> which are the Word of Christ. Therein he sayth, <HI>Look unto me and be ye saved, all ye ends of the earth.</HI> Isai 45.22. The Scriptures are a gracious Letter which Christ has sent from heaven, inviting who will, to come to him, and be saved by him. And he concludeth the letter with a most sweet and blessed invitation to come to the waters of life. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.17. Christ also doth still continue to invite sinners to come to him, by his <HI>Messengers</HI> whom he sends to preach the Gospel in his Name. <HI>Wisdom hath sent forth her Maidens, she crieth upon the high∣est places of the city, whoso is simple let him turn in hither, come eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</HI> Prov. 9▪3, 4, 5.

Argument will appear further, if we consider the Properties of this invitation, whereby the <HI>Lord Iesus</HI> does call upon sinners to <HI>come unto him.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is a real, earnest Invitation.</HI> Christ's heart is in it. Hence he is troubled &amp; grieved at the heart when Sinners will not come to him. When he had often Invited the <HI>Iews</HI> to come under his wing and they would not, he wept over them, saying to <HI>Ierusalem, O that thou hadst known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace.</HI> He does most affect∣ionately call upon sinners to come to him. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 7.37. <HI>He cried and said come unto me.</HI> A loud cry argueth earnestness. Christ is mar∣vellous importunate in his urging sinners to come to him. He is not willing to be put off, or to take denial. See else, <HI>Isai.</HI> 55.1, 2. — <HI>Come ye to the waters, — come ye, — yea come.

<P><HI>It is an often renewed and long continued In∣vitation.</HI> Mat. 22.37▪ — <HI>how often would I have gathered you under my wings</HI>! Where is the Sinner that liveth under the Gospel, that can say how often he has been invited to come unto Jesus Christ! <HI>Behold he stands at the door and knocks, Rev.</HI> 3.2. He does not give one knock at a sinners heart, and away, but he <HI>stands</HI> there; and knocks <HI>again,</HI> and calleth <HI>again.</HI> He knocks at a sinners heart by Mer∣cyes, by Afflictions, by Sermons, and by ma∣nifold dispensations. There are some sinners that Christ continueth Inviting of them, all their dayes. <HI>He stretcheth out his hand, i. e.</HI> he beckens to them that they should come to him <HI>all the day long.</HI> Isa. 65.1. As long as the day of Grace lasts, so long does Christ continue <HI>calling</HI> the sinner to come to him, Now there are some that the day of Grace lasts as long as life in this world (tho it is not so with all) continnueth.</P>

Is not murder a crying sin? But to murder the Son of God! is a crime beyond parallel: Yet those very men that embrued their hands in the blood of Christ, when they came hum∣bly to him for mercy, beleeving on Him whom they had crucified, he received them &amp; obtain'd their peace with God. If thou dost come to him, Hee'll wash thy soul in his Blood.

them, or that their is not merit enough in the Blood of Christ to obtain forgiveness for so great a sin as that is, but because they have not an heart to come to Christ. The Unpar∣donable Sin is alwaies attended with final Im∣penitency, and everlasting Hardness of heart. And this Objection is a meer Temptation of Satan, who seeketh thereby to discourage souls from coming to Christ, He useth to tell those who never did nor ever shall commit <HI>the great Transgression,</HI> they have been guilty of it. Tell me, hast thou any desire to come to Christ? Dost thou prize his blood? then 'tis certain thou never wast guilty of the unpardonable sin, for <HI>such</HI> trample under foot the Son of God, and count his blood an unholy thing. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.24. Art thou a malicious persecutor of the <HI>wayes</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of God? if not, <HI>I</HI> dare pro∣nounce unto thee, that thou wast never guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost; for there never was any man guilty of that sin, but that he was given up to a spirit of persecution; He is filled with rage against the Servants of God, because they fear his Name, and dare not sin against him. Yet again, Didst thou ever mali∣ciously blaspheme or speak evil of that which thou knowest was the work of God's Spirit? If thou hast not done despite to the Spirit of Grace, thou hast not committed the sin against

the Holy Ghost. I must confess it is to be feared, that many of the malignant adversa∣ries of the Truth in these late dayes, have bin judicially given up by God to commit that sin; yet I will say, I am perswaded there is not one soul in this Congregation this day▪ that ever was guilty of it. O yet let not this, nor any other Objection discourage any one among you from coming to Christ.</P>
<P>For Direction here.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>See thy absolute need of Christ.</HI> Without this no one will come to him. For men are naturally averse to nothing so much as to this, so that they will not come to Christ, ex∣cept sense of extream necessity compel them to it. Will a man that thinks himself well, run to a Physician for help? The whole have no need of a Physician but the sick. <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.12. But if men see their absolute need of Christ, then they'll be willing to go to him. When the sons of <HI>Iacob</HI> saw themselves like to perish by the Famine, they would go to Joseph for bread, that they might live and not dye. An Israelite when he saw the Avenger of blood pursuing of him, was made willing to betake himself to the <HI>City of refuge.</HI> Behold sinner, the <HI>Avenger of bloud</HI> is at thy heels! if thou dost not make haste to the City of refuge, hee'll
<PB N="32" REF="000415_0037_0FA5B685F8FD2C20"/>
overtake thee and slay thy soul. Know that without Christ, thou hast a soul within thee that must perish to Eternity. If thou hadst been guilty but of <HI>one</HI> sin in all thy life, thou must lye and dye for ever under the wrath of God, if Christ save thee not. But what wilt thou do then having been guilty of so many and great sins? thou canst not save thy self▪ all thy <HI>own</HI> Righteousness, all thy Prayers, Sor∣rows, Tears, if thou couldst weep Seas of blood cannot save thee. Nay Heaven and earth cannot save thee without Christ. None but <HI>Christ</HI> can deliver from the Wrath to come.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Beware of those things which will keep thee from closing with the Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> Inordi∣nate affection to the world, keeps many a man from Coming to Christ: So it was with the young man in the Gospel, his heart was so set upon the world that he neglected to close with Jesus Christ. Thus in the Parable they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were bidden to the Wedding of the King's, son but would not come; what hind∣red them? <HI>Mat▪</HI> 23.5. <HI>they went their way one to his Farme and another to his merchan∣dise.</HI> Again, Love to some Sin, keeps men from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Christ. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.44. <HI>How can you beleeve, which receive honour one of ano∣ther?</HI> If a man has a lust of Pride which he

loveth, a lust of Drunkeness, a lust of Un∣cleaness, or any other lust which he loveth so as not to be willing to part with it for Christ, how can he believe? And <HI>evil Com∣panions</HI> keep many a soul from going to Christ. The Scripture therefore saith, <HI>Forsake the foolish and live.</HI> Prov. 9.6. And again, <HI>Arise from the dead,</HI> (h. e. come away from thy dead Companions in sin,) <HI>and Christ shall give thee light.</HI> Ephes. 5.14. Why do not Young men come to Christ, when the Gospel calls them? Alas <HI>some</HI> of them have thoughts about it, but this or that vain Companion hinders them▪ As ever thou dost desire an Interest in Christ, or Salvation <HI>by</HI> Him, thou must break off thy Companionship with those vain persons that will prove the Ruin of thy Soul.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When thy Heart is made willing to part with</HI> All <HI>for Christ, venture thy soul upon Him.</HI> Let this Scripture <HI>him that cometh to me, I will in no, wise cast out</HI> encourage thee. Many of the Elect of God have at their first Con∣version been much encouraged by it. Cast thy self and soul into the armes of the Son of God. Venture all thy everlasting Con∣cerns upon the Lord Jesus. Remember how
<PB N="34" REF="000415_0039_0FA5B6889D2AB0A8"/>
it was with the Leprous men whom we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of 2. <HI>King.</HI> 7.4. <HI>They said one to another▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sit we here until we dye, if we sit still here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dye; and therefore come. let us fall unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Host of the Syrians, If they save us alive we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but dye.</HI> So think with thy self, If I sit still and keep at a distance from Christ, I shall certainly dye, if I goe to him, I shall but dye, and it may be I shall live, therefore I'le venture and goe to Christ. Resolve as <HI>Esther</HI> did, <HI>If I perish I perish</HI> (said she) yet I'll go into the Kings presence. so say thou, I'll go to the Son of God, and if I perish▪ I'll perish ly∣ing at his feet: Nay, then thou shalt never perish.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Chapter contains the substance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Sermon preached by the Prophet <HI>Ieremie,</HI> Wherein he declareth that Destroying Judgments were coming upon the Jews: and mentions the reason of it▪ <HI>name∣ly,</HI> Because of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Impenitency and obstina∣cy in Sin. That they were obstinate in their evil way, appeared by their Refusing to heark∣en to the good Counsils and Admonitions of those whom God had sent to them. And this evil was aggravated,</P>
<P N="1">1. In that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been a long time spo∣ken to The Prophet tells them that at the day when he delivered that S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmon, He had

himself bin preaching to them three and twen∣ty years, and all that time urging them to Repentance, but they would not regard what was spoken to them in the Name of the Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>▪ this was great contumacy.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their Obstinacy was yet more aggravat∣ed, in that God had told them of their sins, and what would be the Consequent thereof, not only by <HI>Ieremie,</HI> but by many <HI>other</HI> Pro∣phets. <HI>ver.</HI> 4. <HI>the Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the Prophets, rising early and sending them; but you have not hearkened, nor enclined your ear to hear.</HI> The Lord speaketh after the manner of men, and sayth his heart was up∣on it, (as a man whose heart is engaged in business will <HI>rise early</HI> to see it done; thus God did earnestly endeavour) to reclaim them from their evil wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, but they would not hear, tho Prophet after Prophet was sent unto them for a long time together. This argued great hardness of heart, to contemn such per∣sons, as the holy prophets were, and not <HI>one</HI> of them, but many of them, yea <HI>all</HI> of them.</P>
<P>The words which have been read, express the <HI>Summe</HI> of the Doctrine taught by the Pro∣phets, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That every man should turn from his evil way▪</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="39" REF="000415_0043_0FA5B68F55A56990"/>2. That men should not <HI>delay</HI> that work. They did not only say, Turn, but turn <HI>NOW.</HI> The Doctrine therefore at present to be insist∣ed on is,</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That every sinner unto whom the word of the Lord cometh, is bound to turn from his evil way,</HI> and that NOW <HI>without delaying.</HI></P>
<P>The Explication and Confirmation of this Truth may be expressed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 4 propositions, all which are Comprehended in the Doctrine delivered.</P>
<P>Propos 1▪ <HI>Sin is an evil.</HI> In the Scripture sin is often compared to a <HI>way,</HI> It is therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the 1st. Psalm and the 1st. verse <HI>Blesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the man that standeth not,</HI> (h. e. that remain∣eth not) <HI>in the way of</HI> sinners. <HI>h. e.</HI> in <HI>Sin,</HI> which is the way that sinners delight to abide in. Hence men are said to <HI>walk in sin, Eph.</HI> 2.2, And to <HI>go on</HI> therein, <HI>Psal.</HI> 68.21. And it is an <HI>evil</HI> way▪ Wisdome saith, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> evil <HI>way doe I hate.</HI> Prov. 8.13. <HI>h. e.</HI> the way of sin: which is also called <HI>the way which is not good,</HI> Psal· 36.4. Sin is said to be an evil way especially in 2 respects,</P>
<P N="1">1. In that men thereby go from God the <HI>Chief Good.</HI> That which leads men from God the chief Good must needs be an <HI>evil</HI> way. Now is this true of <HI>Sin.</HI> Men by Sin turn from God; and the more they sin the
<PB N="40" REF="000415_0044_0FA5B6901E6B0878"/>
further doe they goe from God. <HI>Ier.</HI> 2.5. <HI>They are gone</HI> farr <HI>from me.</HI> A sinner has bin do∣ing nothing else but departing from God all his dayes; so that there is an infinite distance be∣tween God &amp; him. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.13. <HI>You were sometimes farr off.</HI> h. e. farr off from God, and from Heaven. And the longer a man liveth in sin, the greater is the separation between God and his soul. For his back is turned upon God. <HI>Ier.</HI> 32.33. <HI>They have turned to me the</HI> back <HI>and not the face.</HI> And therefore the longer a sinner shall goe on in his present way, the fur∣ther will he be from God and from Heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd from all Happiness. Sin then is an evil Way. It appears to be so,</P>
<P N="2">2. In that it is a way which if continued in, will bring to misery at last. All men look up∣on <HI>Punishment</HI> as evil: Now Sin if it be not turned from will certainly be punished at last. <HI>Ier.</HI> 2.18. <HI>Know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing and</HI> bitter <HI>that thou hast for∣saken the Lord thy God.</HI> Bitter Punishments are sometimes inflicted on sinners in <HI>this</HI> world. Temporal Judgments on the Bodies, Estates, Names, Families; and spiritual Judgements on the Souls of sinners use to follow upon the going <HI>on</HI> in sin. To be sure if sin be not tur∣ned from, it will end in death. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.22. <HI>The end of these things is death.</HI> Hence sin is
<PB N="41" REF="000415_0045_0FA5B69062973D68"/>
compared to a <HI>way,</HI> because it <HI>leads</HI> men to de∣struction. <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.27, <HI>Her house is the</HI> way <HI>to</HI> Hell, <HI>going down to the chambers of death.</HI> Hell is an undesi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able place; therefore Sin which is the <HI>way</HI> thither, must needs be an <HI>evil</HI> way.</P>
<P>Propos. 2. <HI>Every sinner hath a way of Sin.</HI> That's implyed in the Text, when it is said, Turn you <HI>every</HI> man from <HI>his</HI> evil way. Every man that is in a state of Sin and unregeneracy, does walk in some way of sin or other which he must turn from. This is the Difference between a Regenerate and an Vnregenerate man▪ A Regenerate man may inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fall into into sin, but then hee's out of his way which he useth to walk in. <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.128. <HI>I hate every</HI> false <HI>way.</HI> And in <HI>verse.</HI> 101. he sayes, <HI>I have refrained my feet from every evil way.</HI> Hence Sin is said to be unto the Lord's people, a <HI>way not cast up.</HI> (i. e. not frequented) <HI>Ier.</HI> 18.15. Never since the world began did a godly man <HI>walk</HI> in that way. There's a dif, ference between <HI>sinning</HI> and having a <HI>way</HI> of sinning. There is no man that doeth good &amp; sinneth not, and there is no good man that has a <HI>way</HI> of sinning. <HI>Psal.</HI> 139. <HI>ult. See if there be any</HI> way <HI>of wickedness in me.</HI> But every unregenerate man has a way of wickedness which he chooseth to goe in. A <HI>Way</HI> of sin

<P>Propos. 3. <HI>Every sinner unto whom the Word of God comes, is bound to turn from his evil way.</HI> The first thing which God required of man was that he should not sin at all. The Law required that: nor does the Law speak any thing of Repentance, but the <HI>Gospel</HI> does. The Law requireth that men should not turn from God; The Gospel requireth that men having turned from God, should turn to him again. Faith and Repentance are the great duties required in the Gospel. This was the Scope and summe of all the Apostles preaching. <HI>Act.</HI> 20▪21. <HI>Testifying both to the Iewes and also to
<PB N="43" REF="000415_0047_0FA5B6919BF15DB8"/>

Hence it is sometimes called <HI>Conversion.</HI> When a man is gone out of the right way, and turns back again, <HI>that's</HI> Conversion. So tis with sinners: They are all gone astray; but God in the word of the Gospel calls aloud to them that they should turn back again. And that <HI>turning from sin</HI> which the Word of God requireth, is to be both <HI>External</HI> and <HI>Internal.</HI> It is necessary that a Sinner should lead a new life, that his outward Actions, and Conver∣sation should be Reformed. <HI>Ier.</HI> 7.3. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your waies and your doings,</HI> but thats not all which God requireth. He calls for the <HI>Heart.</HI> Many a man turns from sin outwardly for fear of Punishment either from God or man, who yet loveth it in his heart still. But the Word of God requireth that men should hate sin. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.9. <HI>Abhor that which is evil.</HI> When a mans heart within him is turned and set a∣gainst sin▪ as sin, then he has truly experienced that Conversion which the Word of God re∣quireth. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.31. <HI>Cast away from you

all your Transgressions, and make you a new heart.</HI> Thats a new heart which hates Sin▪ and lovet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Holiness. And that Sinners might be per∣swaded to this turning, the Word of God is full of gracious Promises unto repenting, re∣turning sinners. God in his Word assureth them, that they shall find mercy, whatever their Provocations and Rebellions have been. <HI>Isai.</HI> 55.7. <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way, and let him return to the Lord and he will have mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y on him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon.</HI> God promiseth the Sinner his life if he will return. He saith, <HI>turn your selves and live you.</HI> And if the wicked be warned from his wicked way, <HI>he shall save his life. Ezek.</HI> 3.18. and 18.32. Heaven is promised to re∣turning sinners. Thus in my Text, <HI>Turn every one from his evil way — and dwell in the land for ever and ever.</HI> There's something Spi∣ritual ultimately intended in those words▪ <HI>viz.</HI> that every one that truly repents of sin shall dwell in Heaven for evermore, of which dwell∣ing in the land of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naan</HI> was a Figure. And the Word of God denounceth no less than E∣ternal Death to every Sinner that will not turn. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.11. <HI>Say unto them, as I live saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wicked: but that the wicked should turn from his way and live.

Thus saith God to every soul of of man, unto whom his Word cometh, thou must either turn from thy evil way, or burn for ever in the fire that shall never be quench∣ed.</P>
<P>Propos. 4. <HI>Men ought not only to turn from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very evil way but to doe it</HI> Now, <HI>and in no wise to delay that matter.</HI> Thus did the Prophets with one voice declare, as is in the Context intimated. And indeed this follows upon what has bin spoken. If God command men to turn, it is necessary that they should doe it <HI>now.</HI> For every Commandment of God ought to be immediately complyed with. There ought to be no delaying, or disputing whether what the great GOD requireth should be obeyed or no. When the Lord commanded <HI>Abraham</HI> to circumcise his Family, it is noted that <HI>in the self same day</HI> he did as God said to him. <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.23. And when he was required to Sacri∣fice his only son, its recorded of him, that <HI>he rose</HI> early <HI>in the morning,</HI> and went to the place

And when <HI>Paul</HI> was called to the Apostleship, he did not consult with flesh and bloud, <HI>h. e.</HI> he did not ask counsil of any man whether he should do what God required of him, but immediately fell about the work, <HI>Gal,</HI> 1.16. Thus every divine precept ought <HI>present∣ly</HI> to be complyed with. So should this of turning from every evil way. And there is Infinite Reason that men should turn <HI>now</HI>; as we cannot but see if we duly mind, either what they are commanded to turn <HI>from,</HI> or whom they are to turn <HI>unto.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What is it that sinners are to turn</HI> from? It is from <HI>Sin,</HI> which is an unprofitable thing. Men don't use to stand considering whether they shall retain a thing which they are sure they shall never gain any thing <HI>by:</HI> Now they may be sure they shall never gain any thing by sin. <HI>Rom,</HI> 6.21. <HI>What fruit had you of those things whereof ye are now ashamed?</HI> There is nothing but shame and Sorrow to be gained by sin. Yea, it is not only an <HI>unprofitable,</HI> but a <HI>hurtful</HI> thing. If a man were running in∣to the mouth of a bloudy serpent ready to devour him, would he stand pausing upon it whether he should turn back? No, he would
<PB N="47" REF="000415_0051_0FA5B6950288CDC0"/>
presently turn about. Sin is a cruel Serpent which devoureth immortal souls, and there∣fore it is the greatest madness in the world for men to make a question whether he should not presently turn from such an evil.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Who is it that sinners are to turn</HI> unto? It is unto God in Jesus Christ. <HI>Ioel.</HI> 2.12 <HI>Turn you even to me with all your heart, saith the Lord.</HI> Even unto that God who is the Fountain of Living water. He in whose favour is Life, and whose Loving Kindness is better than <HI>life</HI> it self. He who will give Grace and Glory, and will with-hold no good thing from them that shall turn unto him.</P>
<P><HI>VSE.</HI> Let it be a word of earnest Exhor∣tation. <HI>Oh that every Sinner would be perswad∣ed to do as the Doctrine sayth,</HI> To turn from his evil way, and to do it <HI>Now</HI> without De∣laying.</P>
<P>Consider 1<HI>st. The Sinner that will turn</HI> Now <HI>shall be happy.</HI> Whatever thy Sins have been, suppose they were never so <HI>many,</HI> or never so <HI>great,</HI> if thou dost turn <HI>now,</HI> God will par∣don thy sins and save thy soul. It may be that there is some sinner that has secret fears and Questionings with himself, <HI>If I should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from my evil way, would God accept of so</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eat a <HI>sinner as I have been?</HI> I Answer, If
<PB N="48" REF="000415_0052_0FA5B69585EB9830"/>
thou wilt turn <HI>now,</HI> I do assure thee in His name, God will accept of thee. For His Word saith, <HI>Behold</HI> now <HI>is the</HI> accepted <HI>time, behold</HI> now <HI>is the day of Salvation.</HI> 2. Cor. 6.2. Now, <HI>Now,</HI> is your time to turn to God if you would find Acceptance with Him, or de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire to be saved. If thou dost not turn <HI>now, just</HI> now, its more than I or any man living can assure thee that ever thy soul shall be saved▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do you find in Scripture that He that turns <HI>to morrow,</HI> shall be accepted? <HI>Boast not thy self of</HI> to morrow, <HI>for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</HI> The Apostle says in the 3d. Chapter to the <HI>Hebrews, To day,</HI> if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. And again <HI>to day,</HI> and a <HI>third</HI> time <HI>to day.</HI> But he that will harden his heart against the voice of God in his Word calling him to Repentance <HI>to day,</HI> it may be will think of Repentance when it is too late.</P>
<P>Consider. 2. <HI>That no man ever repented him that he turned to God too soon, but every man in the world either</HI> has <HI>or</HI> shall <HI>be sorry that he turned no sooner.</HI> There never was an Instance of a man truly converted, who wished he had not been converted so soon. There have been some that have turned from Sin in their youth,
<PB N="49" REF="000415_0053_0FA5B69624D0E570"/>
yea, in their Childhood; ask any such, doe you repent of your early Conversion, they will say no, but we wish we had turned a great deal sooner. <HI>Austin,</HI> I remember saith, <HI>Nimis sero Te amare cae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i!</HI> Alas O Lord, I be∣gan to love Thee later than I wish I had done. And there is no unconverted sinner in the world, but he will one day wish that he had turned from his evil wayes sooner. If e∣ver the Lord give him Repentance unto life, then will he be sorry in his heart, that he was so long before he had any saving acquaintance with God and with Jesus Christ. <HI>Paul</HI> speak∣eth sorrowfully of his late Conversion. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.8. <HI>And last of all he was seen of me, as of one born out of due time.</HI> He was troubled to think that he had lived so many years in the world before he knew Christ Or if a sinner shall be so unhappy as to dye in his evil way, he will for ever wish, when it is too late, that he had hearkened to the Call of the Gospel requiring him to turn Now. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.28. <HI>Then shall they call upon me but I will not answer, they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.</HI> When the day of Grace is past, and when the day of life is spent and gone, Sinners will reflect upon themselves with infinite anguish, and say, What Fools were we that did not turn from sin in time, but now the sun is set, and the day
<PB N="50" REF="000415_0054_0FA5B69A71846828"/>
is become dark over us <HI>for ever.</HI> Had we sought after Reconciliation with God soon∣er, we might have obtained it: but Wo and Alas for us, now it will never be.</P>
<P>Consider 3. <HI>In</HI> other <HI>matters men are unwill∣ing either to delay, or to</HI> be <HI>delayed.</HI> There is many a poor foolish sinner, that if he does but hear of a <HI>Play</HI> to be acted, or any thing which is a matter of sport and pastime, he'll be early at it: He will not let slip the time, but rather be too soon than too late. But when he is called upon to look after the Sal∣vation of his own soul, he puts that off from day to day, as if <HI>that</HI> could <HI>never</HI> be too late. In worldly matters, especially if they be of moment, men have so much wisdome as to dispatch them out of hand. It was said of <HI>Boaz</HI> when an affair that did greatly concern him was to be issued, <HI>The man will not be at rest until he hath finished the thing this day.</HI> Ruth. 3.18. And yet as to the work of Repentance, and making their peace with God, than which nothing can be of greater Concernment, Sin∣ners can be at rest from day to day; nay, from <HI>year to year,</HI> tho that work be not finish∣ed, nor so much as begun: How sad is it to consider! You cannot bear Delayes from others, yet must the great God bear Delayes
<PB N="51" REF="000415_0055_0FA5B69B56449F60"/>
from you? If any of you should command his servant to do such a work <HI>presently,</HI> but he sayes hee'l take his own time and not yours, how would you bear it! But when God commands you to turn <HI>now,</HI> will you take your own time and not God's to doe it? You cannot bear delayes from God himself: If men be in any distress, they are ready to say, Lord make hast to our help! Hear us <HI>speedily</HI>! Make no tarry∣ing; Why then when God calls to you to turn from your evil way, make hast and make no tarrying. If any amongst you should be in grievous tormenting pain, and should cry un∣to God for help, but he should put you off, and say, Twenty or thirty years I'le consider about the matter; how impatient would you be! And will you then say to God, I'le turn from my evil wayes 20 or 30 years hence, whenas the Lord saith, Do it <HI>NOW.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Let Sinners sadly Consider <HI>Whom they Gratifie, and whom they grieve by delaying their Conversion.</HI> They please their greatest enemy, and displease their best Friend. You cannot gratifie your Adversary the Devil more: who is it that saith to you, Wilt thou think of tur∣ning from thy sins? it will be soon enough for that hereafter. No one but the Devil or such as are stirred up by him, will suggest such a
<PB N="52" REF="000415_0056_0FA5B69BA549D278"/>
thought unto thee. He knoweth that if he can but perswade thee to delay thy Conversion a while longer, he shall make sure of thy soul. He alwaies tells sinners either that it is too <HI>soon</HI> for them to turn unto God, or else that it is too <HI>late.</HI> If he should see thee in earnest a∣bout that matter, he would say it is too late now: But as long as thou art careless about it, he saies it is too <HI>soon</HI>; thereby hoping to perswade thee to delay until it be too late <HI>in∣deed,</HI> and then he will deride thee for thy Fol∣ly. So that if a man would study to gratifie the Devil, he could not do it more than by <HI>Deferring his repentance.</HI> But then, whom doe you <HI>greive</HI> thereby? All the <HI>good</HI> men that know thee are grieved for thee: thy nearest Relati∣ons are so if they fear God. It may be thou hast a Godly Father, or a godly Mother: They are grieved to see that thou dost continue still in thy natural unconverted estate. And the Angels of Heaven are grieved by thee. There is joy in the presence of the Angels of God over one sinner that repents, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.10. So that Sinners who delay their Repen∣tance hinder the joy of Angels. And that which is yet sader is, thou grievest the heart of <HI>God</HI> by thy delaying to turn again from thy evil way. The Lord (to speak of Him after the manner of men) thinks the time long, and
<PB N="53" REF="000415_0057_0FA5B69C3044F2E8"/>
is grieved that thou shouldst slight his Calls, and disregard his Commands for so long a time. He saith, <HI>Wash thine heart from wickedness,</HI> — how long <HI>shall vain thoughts lodge in thee?</HI> Jer. 4.14. And again <HI>wilt thou not be made clean?</HI> when <HI>shall it once be? Chapt.</HI> 13.27. Yet again, hear another Scripture, <HI>How long</HI> will it be, e're they attain to innocency? <HI>Hos.</HI> 8.5. <HI>How long! When? How long?</HI> The Spirit of God is grieved by thy long delayes. He looketh upon thy Delayes as Refusals and flat Denials. He saith thou art unwilling to return, and that, thats the reason of thy delaying so long. This must needs grieve and provoke Him. And why wilt thou displease that God who hath been so kind to thee?</P>
<P>Consider 5. <HI>The Infinite danger which is in mens Delaying their Conversion.</HI> Every Sinner had need make haste about this matter, be∣cause a little Delay may cost him his <HI>Life.</HI> The Angel said to <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (Genes.</HI> 19.17.) <HI>Escape for thy</HI> Life, <HI>look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou be consumed.</HI> So I say to thee, O sinner, don't stay in thy present estate, but make hast to Christ as for thy life, lest if thou lag &amp; lin∣ger the fire of <HI>Hell</HI> take hold on thee sudden∣ly, and thou be consumed. 'Tis a dangerous
<PB N="54" REF="000415_0058_0FA5B69EA78EF7E8"/>
thing for a man to deferr his Repentance tho but for one day. One days delay may cost a man the Life of his soul. When <HI>Michal</HI> told <HI>David,</HI> saying, <HI>If thou save not thy life to night,</HI> to morrow <HI>thou shalt be slain,</HI> He went and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led and escaped. 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 19.11, 12. Thus O Sinner, If thou dost not turn from thine Ini∣quities <HI>this day,</HI> it may be to morrow thou shalt be slain. So that it is a very dangerous thing for any man to put off his Repentance a <HI>day</HI> longer: because of the uncertainty of life it is so. When once Death has given the fatal Blow, it's too late for the Sinner to think of turning and making his peace with GOD. <HI>Isai.</HI> 38.18. <HI>They that go down into the</HI> pit <HI>cannot hope for thy truth.</HI> The Sinner whose Body is gone down into the pit of <HI>Death,</HI> and whose soul is gone down into the pit of Eter∣nal <HI>Darkness,</HI> cannot hope that he shall ever be Converted, or that ever his soul shall be saved. And who knoweth how soon the Ar∣row of Death may strike him! The Thun∣der-bolt of Death may kill thee before another morning. Then turn from thy sins <HI>now.</HI> I have diverse times put you in mind of an Ex∣pression of that famous Minister of Christ, Mr. <HI>Bolton,</HI> who would sometimes say, <HI>I would not be in my unconverted estate again one day, tho I might have all the world for it, lest happly death
<PB N="55" REF="000415_0059_0FA5B6A05120CFB8"/>
should come upon me that day, and so my immor∣tal soul be lost for ever.</HI> And it is a dangerous thing for men to delay their Conversion, because the longer they delay it, the more unlike are they ever to be converted. Sinner it is possi∣ble and most probable that <HI>now or never</HI> is thy time to repent in. The longer thou dost de∣lay, the more unwilling and the more unable to turn art thou like to be. For Satan will get faster hold on thy soul; and the longer he has held his Possession the more difficult will his Departure be. We read of one in the Gospel, that the Divel was cast out of him with exceeding Difficulty, and when it was as∣ked <HI>how long is it ago since this came to him</HI>? Answer was made, <HI>of a</HI> child. <HI>Mar.</HI> 9.21. Thus where the Divel has a long time held his possession of a soul, its a hard matter to get him out. And <HI>SIN</HI> as well as Sathan will have deeper rooting and stronger hold on the soul, if Conversion be delayed. The sins of men are like Bonds upon their souls, It was said to <HI>Simon Magus, Thou art in the</HI> bond <HI>of iniquity.</HI> Now the longer men continue in sin, the stronger do they make that woful bond: they will find their souls so fetter'd in the bloody chains of sin, as that it will be a wonder if ever they get loose <HI>Ier.</HI> 13.23. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his
<PB N="56" REF="000415_0060_0FA5B6A0C67A37E8"/>
spots? then may ye also do good that are accusto∣med to do evil.</HI> Can it be? it would be strange if it should: Such a thing will be a kind of a Miracle. The sinner is in a grave: Every Sin he doth commit is as it were another stone cast upon that grave which will make his Resurrection the more difficult. And there is infinite danger in mens delaying their Conver∣sion, lest God should say of them as He did of the old world of ungodly ones, who deferred their Repentance. <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. <HI>My spirit shall not alw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes strive with man.</HI> Or as it was said of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> Ezek. 24.13. <HI>Because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</HI> It may be thy delayes may provoke God to inflict <HI>spiritu∣al</HI> Judgments upon thee; to give thee up to <HI>judicial Blindness</HI> and <HI>Hardness of heart.</HI> There is a most awful passage in the <HI>Evangelical</HI> Pro∣phet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> which Scripture is often menti∣oned in the New-Testament, to shew that Sinners under the Gospel are greatly Concern∣ed in it, Viz. that <HI>Chapt.</HI> 6.10. <HI>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert and be healed.</HI> If God should say of thee, There's such a sinner, I have a
<PB N="57" REF="000415_0061_0FA5B6A182E4C4B8"/>
long time called upon him by the Ministry of the Word, to turn from his evil way, but he has delay'd his Repentance from one year to another; therefore I am now resolved that he shall <HI>never</HI> be converted, and that my Word for the future shall have no other effect upon him but to harden his heart and aggravate his eternal Condemnation. I say, if God should thus resolve concerning <HI>thee,</HI> He would be <HI>just,</HI> and thou for ever <HI>miserable.</HI> O trem∣ble lest thy sinful delayes should provoke the Lord to say of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hee,</HI> as He did of the barren <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ig tree <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.19. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow on <HI>thee hence forward f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</HI></P>

<PB N="58" REF="000415_0062_0FA5B6A228B9A8C0"/>
but they have Convictions: They know they must repent of sin, but they purpose to do it <HI>hereafter</HI>; and so by deferring the matter, their souls are eternally ruin'd e're they are aware. Hell is full of <HI>delaying</HI> Sinners. The Devil has not a greater stratagem to ruin souls by than this. He that will never repent while <HI>to morrow,</HI> will <HI>never</HI> repent at all. Therefore the Devil's great Design is, to perswade the Sinner still to deferr his Repentance until <HI>to∣morrow,</HI> that so it may <HI>never</HI> be.</P>
<P>Let these Considerations awaken every one that is in a State of Sin, <HI>Now</HI> to turn and live. There are some of you that have continued a long time in a natural unregenerate estate: Perhaps you have lived in the world, 30, or 40, or it may be <HI>sixty</HI> years, and in an unconverted estate to this day. It is time to seek the Lord. 'Tis high time for you to consider your wayes and to look about you. Think not with thy self, I'le repent when I come to lye down up∣on my sick bed. How dost thou know that thou shalt lie upon a sick bed at all? It may be some sudden Stroak will take thee out of the world, and where will thy soul be <HI>then</HI>? Or if thou shouldest be visited with Sickness, thats no sutable time to repent in▪ perhaps thou wilt then <HI>lie unto God with thy mouth, and
<PB N="59" REF="000415_0063_0FA5B6A48E437570"/>
flatter him with thy lips.</HI> Sick-bed-Repentance is very seldome true. How often do we see, that Sinners on sick beds make fair promises, to God and man, but when they are recover∣ed they become as bad or worse than ever they were before. Yes, and it may be then thou wilt cry out, <HI>it is too late now.</HI> Did you never hear of a man who delaying his Repentance till he came to lie upon his sick bed, when he was told he must repent of sin, replyed, <HI>all too late</HI>: and when he was exhorted to pray un∣to God for pardon of his past transgressions, he made the same reply, <HI>All to late</HI>! If I had hearkned to this Counsil sooner, it had been happy for me, but <HI>all's too late now</HI>! If thou delayest thy Repentance till then, perhaps this will be thy bitter Cry when thou shalt feel thy departing soul going into the oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r world.</P>
<P>And You that are young, Remember what the Scripture saith, <HI>Thou shalt not delay to offer the</HI> first <HI>of thy ripe fruits.</HI> Exod. 22.29. I be∣sheech, I exhort, I charge every soul of you, who are yet in your sins, that you <HI>Turn NOW</HI>▪ Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not, but <HI>then I must never see merry day more.</HI> Suppose that were true▪ Is it not bet∣ter to live a mournful life in this world for a short time, and then to be in <HI>fulness of joy,</HI> and to have <HI>pleasures for evermore,</HI> than to live <HI>a short life and a merry,</HI> but afterwards thy soul

to smoke for it in the ever-burning lake▪ I have read of a man who when he lay on his Death-bed, uttered this Expression, <HI>I have en∣joyed the pleasures of Sin for a short season, and now I must be in torment for it, for more than mil∣lions of millions of ages.</HI> Oh consider of it. And remember also, that no man has any true joy or solid Comfort, in any thing until such time as he hath turned from his sins, and made his peace with God, through Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>To Direct and Help you here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Practice that great Duty of Self-Exami∣nation.</HI> Look into thy heart and way, and see if there be not some sin, which thou must of necessity turn <HI>from,</HI> or dye <HI>for</HI> it. Some, their Sins are so notorious that they ca'nt but know that they live in sin. Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, Drunkards, unclean persons and such like, they cannot but know that they must Re∣pent or perish. But then there be others, who are of a civil, blameless Conversation before men, and these are more apt to be deceived. But search thy heart, and perhaps thou wilt find that Sin <HI>reigns</HI> there. It may be there is some sin of Commission which thou livest in, which thy heart delights in. Or some sin of <HI>Omission,</HI> perhaps thou dost live in the Neglect
<PB N="61" REF="000415_0065_0FA5B6A621B7CA48"/>
of Prayer from day to day, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.40. <HI>Let us search and try our waies, and turn again to the Lord.</HI> If men would search impartially, they would be more likely to turn. Alas many do not turn, because they think that work is done already; whenas they have turned only from <HI>some</HI> sins, and not from <HI>all.</HI> Take heed left some secret unknown sin which thou art unwilling to see prove the ruin of thy soul. O for the Lords sake be not deceived: And therefore examine your own hearts and estates before the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Set your selves to consider seriously of those things wherein your souls, and everlasting estates are concerned.</HI> Sinners are apt to put off all good Exhortations, by saying, <HI>they cannot con∣vert themselves.</HI> True, but you may use the meanes; of which Serious Consideration is none of the least.

I say, if sinners would but <HI>consider</HI> this, they would surely make as great hast out of their sins, as ever <HI>Lot</HI> did out of <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In the Lord's Name and strength, take up a firm Resolusion</HI> now <HI>to turn from sin.</HI> There are many that have faint purposes that way, but they do'nt come up to a full Resolution. <HI>Austin</HI> in his <HI>Confessions</HI> acknowledgeth that it was so with him; He had thoughts of turn∣Turning

<P>O let thy heart within thee resolve so too. And therefore resolve <HI>now</HI> upon Prayer to God that it may be so. Resolve to continue praying as <HI>Ephraim</HI> did, <HI>Turn thou me O Lord, and I shall be turned.</HI></P>

<P>It shall be more tolerable for the Land of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI> in the Day of Iudgement, than for that City.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter we have both the <HI>Commis∣sion,</HI> and the <HI>Instructions</HI> which the Apost∣les received from the Lord Jesus Christ, when they were first sent forth to preach the Gospel. The Lord instructed them unto whom they should first go and make a tender of the Gospel: Only to the <HI>Iewes,</HI> and not to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> until such time as it would be seen whether the Jewes would accept thereof or no. In the preceding verse the Lord directs them how they should behave themselves to∣towards
<PB N="65" REF="000415_0069_0FA5B6A927B57B48"/>
such as would reject them and their Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> that they should shake off the dust of their feet against them; and we find that in after times the Apostles practised ac∣cordingly. <HI>Act.</HI> 13.51. Whereby they de∣clared that they looked upon such Persons tho' <HI>Israelites,</HI> as prophane and as abominable as any Heathen, and therefore such as they would no more hold Communion with; but that they would go away from them, and car∣ry the Gospel to others who would give it a better Reception. The Jewes looked upon the very earth or dust which was brought out of Heathen Lands to be impure, yea, as unclean as the Ashes of a dead Carcase which they might not touch. Hence by shak∣ing the dust of their feet against them, they would signifie that they were such Sinners as did defile the very ground they trod upon, and so as abominable as any Heathen.</P>
<P>In this verse there are Two Things con∣tained,</P>
<P N="1">1. A Declaration of the grievous punish∣ment which shall come upon them that despise the Gospel. It shall be more tolerable for So∣dom and Gomorrha than for such. <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI> are instanc'd in, because they were made the most terible Example of Divine Ven∣Vengeance
<PB N="66" REF="000415_0070_0FA5B6A9D268D848"/>
that ever was in the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. When this punishment shall be inflicted, <HI>viz.</HI> At the Day of Judgment. Hence the words are spoken in the future Tense: 'Tis not said, it <HI>is,</HI> but it <HI>shall be</HI> more tolerable for Sodom &amp; Gomorrha, so that a Punishment <HI>yet to come</HI> on the Sodomites is spoken of.</P>
<P>The Word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> afford unto us several Doctrines, I shall only mention <HI>Three</HI> as being the prin∣cipal.</P>
<P>DOCT. 1. <HI>That there shall be a day of Iudg∣ment.</HI></P>
<P>Doct. 2. <HI>That at the day of Iudgment all sin∣ners shall not suffer alike, but some will have a farr more intolerable Punishment than</HI> others <HI>shall.</HI></P>
<P>Doct. 3. <HI>That they who have despised the Of∣fer of the Gospel shall at the Day of Iudgment fall under the heaviest CONDEMNATION.</HI></P>
<P>At present only concerning the first of these Doctrines, Viz. <HI>That there shall be a day of Iudgment.</HI></P>
<P>For the clearing of this Doctrine, there are three things to be enquired into. 1. How it does appear that there shall be such a day. 2▪ What kind of day it will be. 3. The Rea∣son why there must be such a day.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>How does it appear that there shall
<PB N="67" REF="000415_0071_0FA5B6AC198FA3E0"/>
be</HI> a Day of Judgement?</P>
<P>ANSW. 1. <HI>The Scripture does abundantly bear witness to this truth.</HI> In the Old Testa∣ment there are many Testimonies concerning a Judgment <HI>to come.</HI> So in the Book of Psalms▪ as in <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.3, 4. and 96.13. not to mention other places. And the Prophets, in special <HI>Isaiah, Daniel, Malachi</HI> speak expres∣ly and distinctly of this Judgment. Hence the <HI>Iews</HI> themselves acknowledge that there will be a general Day of Judgement. But in the <HI>New Testament</HI> this (as well as many other great Truths) is more clearly and abundant∣ly made known. Yea, the <HI>Form</HI> of Judgment is there described, as in the Latter end of the twenty fifth Chapter of <HI>Matthew</HI> we may see▪</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Light of Nature, and that Conscience which is in men, sheweth that there must needs be a Iudgement to come.</HI> Conscience is a mans judgment of himself, as subjected to the Judgment of God. The Apostle sheweth that the Gentiles doe by nature the things contain∣ed in the Law; their Conscience bearing wit∣ness, and their thoughts accusing or excusing <HI>in the mean while</HI> h. e. until the day come that God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.15.16. Before the great day of Judgment come, they are judging and
<PB N="68" REF="000415_0072_0FA5B6ACA5A47D68"/>
impleading themselves, There is a day of judgement kept in the Conscience, which prov∣eth that God will have a Day of Judgement for all men. If men were not to be judged by <HI>God,</HI> they would never enter into judgement with <HI>themselves.</HI> Hence there are secret, aw∣ful fears upon the spirits of Sinners with re∣spect unto this Day: Yea sometimes in the <HI>worst</HI> of sinners. When <HI>Felix</HI> heard <HI>Paul</HI> rea∣soning co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erning Righteousness and Tempe∣rance and <HI>IVDGMENT to come,</HI> he tremb∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. <HI>Act.</HI> 24.25. Especially when Sinners ly upon sick-beds, and Death-beds, Consci∣ence tells them they must appear before the Judgment seat of the GREAT GOD and answer for all the evils they have done. Or if men commit any great sin, conscience tells them they must to Judgment for that sin. He that shall tell a Lye against his Conscience, or commit any such grievous sin, has that in his own breast (a <HI>Conscience</HI>) which is a Preacher of Judgement to him, because of that Sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Providence of God does so order matters in the World, as that we may from thence con∣clude that there will be a Day of Iudgment.</HI> e. g. He permits <HI>wrong</HI> Judgment to pass a∣mong men in the world. <HI>Guilty</HI> men are here <HI>acquitted,</HI> and innocent men are oftentimes
<PB N="69" REF="000415_0073_0FA5B6AF8D9D9880"/>
<HI>condemned.</HI> Psal. 44.21. Solomon did from that Consideration conclude, that things will one day be called over again, and another Judgment be passed by Him who is the Su∣pream and righteous JUDGE of all the world. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 3.16. Great and Heinous sinners do sometimes escape punishment, not only from men, but from the Hand of God in this world. Though some such are punished to shew there is a Providence, yet others escape to shew that there is a Judgment to come, 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.24.</P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What kind of day will the</HI> Day of Judgment <HI>be?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>It will be a</HI> great <HI>Day. Iude</HI> spea∣keth of <HI>the Iudgment of the</HI> great <HI>day.</HI> ver. 6. Hence it is called <HI>that day.</HI> 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.12. There never was such a day <HI>before,</HI> and there never shall be such a day <HI>after</HI> this. It is styled <HI>the day of God.</HI> 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.10, 12. Great &amp; emi∣nent things are expressed by the Name of <HI>God</HI> in Scripture.</P>
<P>It will be a great day, 1<HI>st.</HI> In respect of the great <HI>Multitude</HI> which then shall be judged; The whole world: <HI>God hath appointed a day wherein He will judge the</HI> world. <HI>Act.</HI> 17.31. Whole Nations, yea <HI>all</HI> Nations shall be gather∣ed before His Judgement seat. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.32. Not only such as shall be found alive on the
<PB N="70" REF="000415_0074_0FA5B6B1C1894F80"/>
earth, when the Judge shall come down from Heaven, but such as are <HI>dead,</HI> whose souls have been Thousands of years either in Heaven or Hell, must then to Judgement. 2. Tim. 4.1. What a great day will that be, when all the men that ever were in the world or that ever shall be, must every mothers Child of them appear before the Judgment Seat of the great GOD! All <HI>good</HI> men shall be <HI>judged</HI> tho' not condemned. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.34. And all <HI>wicked</HI> men, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. <HI>The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them, &amp; they were iudged every man according to their works.</HI> Nay, the <HI>Angels</HI> that have sinned shall then be judged. They are reserved for everlasting Chains unto the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udgement of that great day. Therefore it is that the Apostate Angels tremble at the thought of this day: When they saw the Son of God they cryed and roared and said, <HI>Art thou come to torment us before our time? Mat.</HI> 8.29. They know that there are hotter chains reserved for them, than those which at pre∣sent they are in; and the dismal thought there∣of makes all the Devils in Hell to tremble. 2. The day of Judgement will be a day of great <HI>Discovery.</HI> Hence it is called a <HI>day.</HI> In the Night things ly hid, but in the day they are discovered: So in the dark night of this
<PB N="71" REF="000415_0075_0FA5B6B205E93AB8"/>
present world, many things are unseen and unknown▪ which then all the world shall see &amp; know. <HI>Lue.</HI> 12.2. It will be a day of great discovery in respect of the works and Dispen∣sations of God. Hence 'tis called a <HI>day of Re∣velation.</HI> Rom. 2.5. The Works of Creation and the Mystery of Redemption, and the strange Mysteries of Providence, and Wisdom, and Righteousness of God in all, will then be revealed to the Admiration of men and An∣gels for ever. There will also be a great Dis∣covery of <HI>men</HI> in that day. The Spiritual and Eternal estates of all (which are now known to God onely) will then be made manifest to the whole world. It will be seen who were sheep and who were goats: who were Wheat and who were Tares: who were wise and who were foolish Virgins. Many that hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made a great Profession, that walked in Fel∣lowship with the people of God, that sate down with them at the Lord's Table, will then be found standing at the left hand of Je∣sus Christ, and their Hypocrisie discovered. And it will be a Day of great Discovery, as to the <HI>Workes</HI> of men. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12.14. <HI>For God shall bring every work into Iudgement, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be e∣vil.</HI> Secret Thefts, secret Uuncleanesses, Se∣cret Adultries, all will come out, and the whole
<PB N="72" REF="000415_0076_0FA5B6B361A2A050"/>
World shall hear of those things at the day of Judgment. Yea; the very <HI>thoughts</HI> of men will be discovered. The secrets of all hearts will be disclosed in that day 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.5. The good Designes and gracious purposes which have been in the hearts of holy men, the Lord Jesus will then reveal them and speak of them to their praise, before all the World. And the evil purposes, and wicked thoughts which have been in the hearts of ungodly men shall then be told of, to their everlasting shame.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Day of Iudgement will be to the Vn∣beleeving world a most</HI> terrible <HI>day.</HI> Hence it is expressed in the Scripture by that of <HI>the terrour of the Lord,</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.11. There have bin terrible <HI>Types,</HI> &amp; forerunners of this dread∣ful day. Those lesser days of judgment, which have been in the world, when God has called whole Nations to an account, and executed Judgment upon them, were Types and fore∣runners of the General Judgment; and thence are in the Scripture set forth by Expressions which are most proper to the great and last Judgement. The Terrour of this day no heart is able to conceive, nor tongue able to express. But it appears especially in 4 par∣ticulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. In that it will be a <HI>Fiery</HI> day. This vi∣visible
<PB N="73" REF="000415_0077_0FA5B6B419DB9548"/>
World is subject to a <HI>two-fold</HI> Destruc∣tion, one by Water, the other by Fire: that by water was accomplish'd on the old world in the Dayes of <HI>Noah</HI>; the other by Fire will take place at the day of Judgment. 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.7. <HI>The Heavens</HI> &amp; <HI>the earth are reserved unto</HI> fire <HI>against the day of judgement.</HI> &amp; ver. 12. <HI>Look∣ing for the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, &amp; the Ele∣ments shall melt with fervent heat.</HI> The Scrip∣tures both of the Old and of the New Tes∣tament speak of this fire. <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.3. <HI>Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i.</HI> 66.15, 16. The Day of Judgment will be∣gin with flaming fire. <HI>Dan.</HI> 7.9, 10.2. Thes. 1.8. Yea, and <HI>end</HI> so too, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.9. Now what a terrible day will that be▪ when all the earth shall burn at once, and the Heavens be all on a light flame also!</P>
<P N="2">2. There will be the most terrible, amaz∣ing <HI>noise</HI> that ever was heard in the world. 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.10. <HI>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise.</HI> The very <HI>noise</HI> of the fire which then shall prevail every where will be terrible to hear. If a Town be on fire, what a noise does it make! The Rattling of the Flames is terrible to hear. But what then will it be, when all the <HI>World</HI> shall be on fire▪ What an amazing noise will those rattling
<PB N="74" REF="000415_0078_0FA5B6B4F07E2F40"/>
flames make all the World over! And ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will be then the most terrible Thundrings and Lightnings that ever were known. If when the Lord came down to publish the Law on mount Sinai, there were Thunderings and Lightnings, so that all the people in the camp trembled; how much more when He shall come to <HI>judge</HI> the <HI>breakers</HI> of that Law. And what fearful out-cries and roaring Lamentati∣ons will amazed Sinners make in every Cor∣ner of the world! As undoubtedly they did in the Old World, when they saw that the <HI>windows</HI> from on high were opened, and there was no escaping that flood of death which was round about them. So it will be much more when Sinners shall behold a flood, a River, a <HI>Sea</HI> of <HI>FIRE and Brimstone</HI> that they cannot goe from.</P>
<P N="3">3. At the Day of Judgement there will be the most terrible <HI>Destruction</HI> and <HI>Devastation</HI> that ever was. All the <HI>wicked</HI> in the world shall then be destroyed. <HI>Mal.</HI> 4.1. <HI>For behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud▪ yea and all that</HI> do wickedly <HI>shall be stub∣ble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts,</HI> Therefore the day of Judgment is called <HI>the day of Perdition of un∣godly men.</HI> 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.7. And there will be a terible Destruction, not only of men but of
<PB N="75" REF="000415_0079_0FA5B6B5A3E87D58"/>
other creatures in that day, <HI>wherein the hea∣vens b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing on fire shall be dissolved, and the ele∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ts shall melt with fervent heat.</HI> ver▪ 12. The Greek word translated <HI>Elements</HI> is <HI>stoikeia,</HI> which signifieth <HI>Hosts</HI>: All the Host of crea∣tures which are in this lower heaven shall at the day of judgment be no more able to live than if they were (as indeed they shall be in) a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnace of fire, whose fervent heat cannot be endured. And the Apostle saith, that <HI>the earth also, and the workes which are therein shall be burnt up.</HI> There are living creatures there∣on, Beasts of the field, and creeping things. There are works of Nature, Trees, Herbs &amp;c. And there are works of Art, Houses, Towns, Cities, &amp;c. These shall all be consumed at the last day. What a terrible day will that be when there shall not be a house left standing in all the world!</P>
<P N="4">4. The Day of judgment will be concluded with the Pronunciation and Execution of a most terrible Sentence upon all Christless Sin∣ners. The man whom God has ordained to to judge the world, (<HI>h. e.</HI> his Son <HI>Iesus Christ'</HI>) will then pronounce a Sentence of <HI>eternal death</HI> upon as many as shall be found in their Sins. How will their Hearts ake, and every joint Tremble▪ when they shall hear that Sentence wherein every word does

breathe forth Death and fire <HI>Mat.</HI> 25 41. <HI>De∣part from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepar∣ed for the devil and his angels.</HI> There will be no appealing from this Sentence, nor shall it ever be reversed. And the Sentence will no sooner be pronounced, but Execution will be done immediately. For the Angels of Heaven will be all standing by, and see it done forth∣with. The Sentence is, That sinners must be <HI>burnt to death for ever,</HI> that they must be thrown <HI>alive</HI> into the lake which burns with fire and Brimstone. The Holy Angels will see this done. They are the Reapers that shall gather the Tares together, and bind them in bundles to burn them. <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.30.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The day of Iudgement will be unto true Be∣leevers on Iesus Christ a</HI> good <HI>Day.</HI> It will be to them a day of Rejoicing <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.16. A <HI>comfortable day,</HI> 1. Thes. 4.18. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. It will be to <HI>them</HI> a day of <HI>Salvation Heb.</HI> 9.28 And indeed, The Salvation of believers is not consummated before that day. Its true, that their souls are in perfect Blessedness as soon as they depart out of this world. Therefore the Apostle speakes of the <HI>Spirits of just men mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perfect. Heb·</HI> 12.23. But their Bodies are not glorified until the Day of Judgdment, not till the Resurrection at the last day; which

is therefore called <HI>the day of Redemption, Eph·</HI> 4.30. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.23. When that blessed day shall dawn upon the world, the Saints of God shall never more be subject to any misery. It will be a <HI>time of refreshing</HI> from the presence of the Lord, <HI>Act.</HI> 3.19. A time of <HI>Rest.</HI> 2. Thes. 1.7. And there shall be no more sor∣row. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.4.</P>
<P N="2">2. Believers shall at the Day of Judgement be publickly absolved and acquitted from the guilt of all their sins. A sentence of <HI>Abso∣lution</HI> will be passed upon them. They will be pronounced blessed; and there are none bles∣sed but they whose sins are forgiven. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.34. Hence the Scripture speaketh of Sins be∣ing forgiven in the world to come, <HI>h. c.</HI> at the Day of Judgement. <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.32. It is Controverted amongst Divines, whether the secret sins of Believers will be at all spoken of at the day of Judgement: Some think they shall <HI>not,</HI> because that would tend to their Reproach and shame. But there is much to be said for the Affirmative, that they shall <HI>some</HI> of them be spoken of: For some of the Elect of God did commit their sins with such as are Reprobate; now if the sins of these Reprobate must be spoken of, then must the Sins of the <HI>Elect,</HI> who had Fellowship with them in their wickedness; but then they shall

not be condemned, nor any reproach cast up∣on them for what they have done. In point of condemnation they shall be as if they had never sinned. <HI>There is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesus. Rom.</HI> 8.1. There was Condemnation to them before they were in Christ, but since that, there neither is nor ever shall be any Condemnation to them.

The Lord Jesus will then say to the true Believer, Tho' thou wast guil∣ty of many and great sins, yet because I dyed for thee, and thou didst believe on me, thy sins are all forgiven, and therefore do thou rejoice for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3.

And their Kingdom they shall not have in heaven only, but in this lower visible world▪ <HI>under the whole hea∣ven</HI>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 7.27. In the place where they ser∣ved God and where they suffered for his Sake there they shall reign. But they must not look for a Temporal Dominion in this world: They must stay till the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and the day of judgment, and then they shall reign. <HI>In the morning.</HI> i. e. in the morning of the day of judgment or at the resurection <HI>the upright shall have Dominion Psal.</HI> 49.14. <HI>In the Re∣generation</HI> (whereby the Resurrection is inten∣ded) <HI>they shall sit upon thrones</HI> Mat. 19.28. Tho Christ only shall pass the Sentence of death upon the reprobate world, yet the Saints shall sit with Him upon Thrones of judgement, as Assistors and Aprobators of that judgement.</P>

<P>Reas. 3. <HI>There must be a day of judgement that so</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>the son of God may be glori∣fied before all men and Angels.</HI> For Christ is the person whom God the Father has appoin∣ted to be the Judge of the World. <HI>Act.</HI> 17.31. <HI>He hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom He hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead</HI> Christ's Resurrection is an evidence of this. His Exaltation began in his Resurrection: we
<PB N="82" REF="000415_0086_0FA5B6BEA7A1C850"/>
may from thence conclude that the last degree of His Exaltation▪ which is in His sitting to judge the world at the great Day, will in the appointed time take place. It is said concer∣ning <HI>Ioshuah,</HI> (who in that as well as in ma∣ny other respects was a Type of Christ) <HI>On that day the Lord magnified Ioshuah in the sight of all Israel. Chapt.</HI> 4.14. So on the Day of Judgement, God will magnifie His Son Je∣sus Christ in the sight of all the world. God will have all the world to know, that His Son <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s more than a man; that the honour due to God shall be given to him. Therefore hath He made Him the Judge of all. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 5.22, 23. <HI>The Father judgeth no man, but hath com∣mitted all judgement to his Son, that all men should honour the son,</HI> even as <HI>they honour the Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her.</HI> Moreover, Christ will come to judge the world in greatest State, Majesty and Glory that ever was, or that can be conceived. <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.30. <HI>They shall see the Son of man coming in pow∣er and in great GLORY.</HI> Hence His second Coming is called His <HI>glorious appearance, Tit.</HI> 2.13.

All the <HI>Angels</HI> in heaven shall come down from thence to wait upon the Son of God in that Day, <HI>Mat▪</HI> 25.31. <HI>The Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy Angels with Him.</HI> Hence <HI>Dan∣iel</HI> in his Vision of the Day of Judgement, be∣held a Thousand Thousand ministr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng to Him, and ten Thousand times ten Thousand stood before him.

As when a great Person is com∣ing to this or that place, many go out to meet him; so when the Son of God shall visit this lower world with His Personal presence, all the Saints on Earth shall <HI>meet Him</HI> in the Air. And this may be the true meaning of that Scripture <HI>Luk.</HI> 17, 34. where Christ saith <HI>In that night there shall be two men in one bed, the one shall be taken and the other left.</HI> One shall be taken and caught up by the holy An∣gels to meet the Lord Jesus in the air, and the other shall be left to perish in that Fire

which shall then consume the world. More∣over, At the Day of Judgement, the Son of GOD shall sit upon a most <HI>glorious Throne,</HI> Matth. 25.31. <HI>Then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory,</HI> that is to say, His most <HI>glo∣rious</HI> Throne: So that He will reign then vi∣sibly before the world. It is most true, that Christ reigns now in <HI>Heaven,</HI> but the greatest part of the Children of men in this world, do not know nor believe that: But therefore at the Day of judgment He shall reign in the <HI>vi∣sible, lower</HI> world. <HI>Ier.</HI> 23.5. <HI>A King shall reign and prosper and execute Iudgment and jus∣tice in the earth.</HI> Christ's Judging the world belongs to his <HI>Kingly</HI> Office, <HI>Math.</HI> 25.34.

<P><HI>VSE. Let every soul endeavour to be prepar∣ed for this Day.</HI> A Day of Judgement will come. All that are wise will make it their chief endeavour to give up their Account with joy and not with grief <HI>in that Day.</HI></P>
<P>Consider. 1. <HI>That all and every one of us must make our personal appearance, before that dreadful Tribunal.</HI> 2.

If God that made Heaven and earth <HI>will</HI> bring him into judgment, how shall
<PB N="87" REF="000415_0091_0FA5B6108A1B3FF0"/>
he escape? Not a soul of man shall escape the Tryal. The Great God has resolv'd, and said, and sworn, that every one shall come before His Tribunal. <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.10, 11, 12. <HI>We shall all stand before the judgement seat of Christ; For it is written, as I live saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to mee and every tongue shall confess to God: So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</HI> If but <HI>one man</HI> should escape apearing, the Oath of God must be broken, which is impossible. O man, as sure as the Lord liveth, thou shalt stand before his judgment seat, and be tryed and judged, either to <HI>everlasting Life,</HI> or <HI>ever∣lasting Death.</HI></P>
<P>Consider, 2. <HI>That at the day of judgment, men must be called to a very particular and strick Account.</HI> All the Actions of their Lives must then be look'd over. The things which they did whilst their souls continued in their bo∣dies, they must be accountable for them. <HI>God shall bring every work into judgment. Eccles.</HI> 12.14.

words, for <HI>Oaths</HI> and <HI>Curses,</HI> and <HI>Blas∣phemies</HI> which they have poured forth out of an evil mouth. And what a dreadful account will many Sinners have to give up for these things in the day of judgment▪ Yea, men shall be called to an account in that day, not only for all that they have done, but for all they have <HI>received.</HI> It is said in the <HI>Parable</HI> concerning the <HI>Talents, after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them.</HI> Matth. 25.19. Whatever Talents God shall entrust any man withal, <HI>first</HI> or <HI>last</HI> a day of reckoning will come. The Lord Je∣sus will say to some at the great Day, You had such Estates in the world, but what did you do with your Riches? did you improve them for God, or did you not abuse them for sin and to dishonour His Name? He'le say to another; Thou hadst a Talent of understand∣ing, thou hadst Wit and Memory and Learn∣ing above many others, but how didst thou make use of thy parts? He will say to ano∣ther, You enjoyed the meanes of grace, you heard many Sermons: Did not you live in <HI>New-England?</HI> and whose Ministry did you live under there? What account can you now give concerning all the Sermons which you have heard? Did you repent of Sin and believe on the Son of God, and deny all Un∣Ungodliness

and worldl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lusts, and live sober∣ly, righteously, and Godly in the world?</P>
<P>Consider. 3. <HI>That as death leaveth a man, so judgement will find him.</HI> All the time which men have to prepare for Judgment is only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are in this world. There is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e whither thou goest. For there is a particular Judgement passeth upon e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery soul at death, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27. <HI>It is ap∣pointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment</HI>▪ When once a mans soul is out of his body, it appears before the Judge of all, and is sentenced, either to Life or Death for ever; which particular judgement will be published at the Last Day. If death find a man unprepared, so will Judgment. There∣fore it highly concerns every man to prepare now. Miserable Sinner, thou knowest not how soon death may come upon thee like an armed m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and dragg thy soul before the Judgment seat of GOD! It may be <HI>this night</HI> it will be so. Death sometimes giveth no warning before it comes. Remember that Scripture, <HI>Amos.</HI> 4.11. <HI>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomor∣rha.</HI> And how was that? verily by Thun∣der and Lightning from Heaven. And has it not been so amongst us also? There have
<PB N="90" REF="000415_0094_0FA5B612E9401EA0"/>
been (to my observation) about Twenty per∣sons in this Land, who have at several times, and places been killed with Lightning: some such very lately. Therefore if God fell upon <HI>them,</HI> and struk them dead in a moment; how doest thou know but that it may be so with <HI>thee?</HI> If thou continuest unprepared for Death and Judgment, thou knowest not but that the next Thunder-storm that cometh, may prove to thy soul, as snares, and fire, and brimstone, and an horrible Tempest.</P>
<P>Consider. 4. <HI>As Iudgment shall find a man so it will be with him to all Eternity.</HI> Eterni∣ty will fasten its iron Teeth upon thy soul then. Hence the Scripture speaketh of <HI>Eter∣nal judgement.</HI> Heb. 6.2. because men shall then be judged to an eternal estate either of weal or of woe. The wicked shall then goe away into everlasting punishment, and the Righteous into Life eternal. If Judgment find a man in a good estate he shall be for ever with the Lord, he shall be where there is <HI>Fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore.</HI> But if judgement find him in his sins, he shall be cast into a dungeon out of which he shall <HI>ne∣ver</HI> come, even into blackness of darkness for∣ever. O think of this one word, If Judgment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd thee in thy sins; after thou hast been in
<PB N="91" REF="000415_0095_0FA5B613AB62EF00"/>
misery as many millions of Ages as there have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> minutes since the world began, thou art no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earer to an end of thy misery than thou wast the first hour that the Son of God passed on thee a sentence of eternal death.</P>
<P>For Direction here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Think often on the</HI> DAY of JUDGMENT, <HI>and what will then become of thee.</HI> Often set the Thought of that come into thy heart. One of the Auncients hath such an Expression as this:
<Q>Wherever I go, whether I am at home or abroad, alone or in Company, Meethinks I am still hearing the last Trump sounding, and that heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh king voice of the Son of God, <HI>Arise you dead, and come to IVDGMENT.</HI></Q>
Think what will then become of thee Must I then goe to Heaven or Hell? If the Lord Jesus should come to Judge the world this night, what would He say to mee? what Answer can I give to Him concerning my Time in this world, how I have spent it? Would the Lord say to me, Come thou blessed! or will He not say, Go thou cursed.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Make</HI> through work <HI>of it, in the mat∣ter of Repentance.</HI> Thoughts of the Day
<PB N="92" REF="000415_0096_0FA5B6144DE94B68"/>
of Judgment should awaken hereunto. <HI>Act▪</HI> 17.30, 31. <HI>Now God commands all men ev∣ry where to repent, because he hath appointed a Day in which he will judge the world.</HI> As for impenitent sinners that live so, and dye so; the longer they live the worse it will be for them at the Day of Judgement. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.5. <HI>But after thy hardness, and impoenitent heart, treasurest up wrath against the Day of wrath.</HI> — An impenitent Sinner adds to the heap of Wrath by every sin which he does commit. Those Treasures of wrath which he has been heaping up for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> miserable soul will never be spent. O therefore confess Sin: Enter into judgement with thy <HI>self now,</HI> if thou wouldst not have <HI>God</HI> enter into Judgement with thee <HI>at that Day.</HI> And <HI>forsake</HI> Sin: He that confesseth and <HI>forsaketh</HI> shall find mercy. Nor is it enough to forsake <HI>some</HI> sins <HI>only,</HI> but <HI>all</HI> known sin. If thou hast been a Swearer, confess that sin before God, and forsake it. If thou hast been a Drunkard, confess that sin and forsake it. Or if thou hast lived in Wantonness, Uncleaness, Self-po∣lution (the sin which young men are com∣monly damn'd for) confess it to God and for∣sake it. Or if thou hast lived in any other sin, O turn from it unto God with thy whole heart. If thou shouldst continue to live but

in <HI>one</HI> sin, at the Day of Judgement thou wilt wish that thou hadst never been born. Re∣pent and turn from all your Transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Make sure of an Interest in Christ.</HI> When the Flood came, they in the Ark were safe, but all others perished: So at the day of Judgment, they that shall be found in Christ, will be happy, but all others must into the fire that never shall be quenched.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THese Words are part of a Sermon preached by our Lord Jesus Christ to His Disciples. He does therein compare Himself to a vine, and Believers on Him to vine branches; shewing that they can no more bring forth fruits of acceptable Obe∣dience unto God of themselves, than a branch that is separated from the Vine can bear grapes.</P>
<P>In the preceding verse, our Lord exhorts His Disciples <HI>to abide in him,</HI> i. e. to continue constant and stedfast in the way of Faith and
<PB N="97" REF="000415_0101_0FA5B61B22066B30"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bedience. And the Motive whereby he urgeth that Exhortation is, because then God will hear their prayers. <HI>If you abide on me, and my words in you, ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you.</HI> which is to be understood with this Li∣mitation, so farr as they should ask things agreable to the Will of God. The words now before us are a Confirmation of that Asserti∣on. If Christians that bring forth much fruit glorifie God, then we may be sure that he will hear their prayers, I shall not insist on any Observation from the Contextural Considera∣tion of the words, but from them as in them∣selves considered, the Doctrine is.</P>
<P><HI>That fruitful Christians, especially such as are</HI> abundantly fruitful <HI>glorifie God.</HI></P>
<P>For the clearing of the Truth before us, 3 Things may be enquired into. 1. What's im∣plyed in this <HI>Fruit.</HI> 2. When Christians may be said to be <HI>abundantly fruitful,</HI> or to bear <HI>much</HI> fruit. 3. In what respect such are said to <HI>glorifie God</HI></P>
<P>QUEST. 1: <HI>What is implyed here in fruit?</HI></P>
<P>ANSW. 1. It does imply <HI>a work of Grace in the soul.</HI> All those Graces which are wrought in the souls of believers are compa∣red to fruit in the Scripture: yea, unto <HI>pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sant</HI> and <HI>savory</HI> fruit <HI>Cant.</HI> 4.13, 16. <HI>Thy

plants are an orchard of pomegranates with plea∣sant fruits. — let my beloved come into his gar∣den, and eat his pleasant fruits.</HI> Faith is com∣pared to fruit. When the <HI>Colossians</HI> believed, tis said, <HI>the Gospel brought forth</HI> fruit <HI>amongst them. Chapt.</HI> 1.6. And all graces are called fruit▪ <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.9. <HI>The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness.</HI> Thus <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.22, 23. <HI>But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffer∣ing, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, tem∣perance.</HI> Hence godly men are compared to good trees which bear good fruit, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.33. They are called <HI>trees of righteousness,</HI> Isa. 61.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As the Habit of grace, so all the Actions thereof are fruit.</HI> All Graces motions and ope∣rations, whether internal in the heart, or ex∣ternally manifested, are Fruit. Where there is true grace, it will surely discover it self. Grace is compared to Life in the Scripture, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.9. <HI>You hath be quickened.</HI> Now Life discovers it self, at leastwise by breathings; So does grace in the soul alwaies discover it self by breathing after Christ, and after Holi∣ness. Now all discoveries of a gracious frame of heart, are the <HI>Fruit</HI> here spoken of. Therefore</P>

<PB N="99" REF="000415_0103_0FA5B61CA03D1CE0"/>
is so. A godly desire and purpose in the heart is so. When a man is thinking and contrive∣ing with himself how he may promote the Glory of God and Good of men, those thoughts are fruit. As <HI>David</HI> when he was thinking to build an House for the Name of God, that godly intention was <HI>pleasant fruit</HI>▪ And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> had many gracious pur∣poses and designs working in his heart, which <HI>Timothy</HI>▪ who was intimate with him knew much of. 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.10. <HI>Thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,</HI> — God seeth, and delights to see holy purposes, and sincere real intentions in the hearts of His servants to glorifie His Name.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Gracious</HI> words <HI>are fruit.</HI> It is said of Christ, that <HI>gracious words procceeded out of his mouth.</HI> When it is so with Christians then they are fruitful.

<P>We come then to the 2<HI>nd.</HI> Enquiry, <HI>viz▪</HI></P>
<P><HI>When may Christians be said to bear much fruit?</HI> And the Answer to that is clear from what has been said in shewing what the <HI>fruit</HI> here spoken of is. In two words,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They that have much</HI> grace, <HI>bear much fruit.</HI> There is a marvellous difference among true Christians as to <HI>degrees of</HI> grace. Tho' every Believer hath every grace in some de∣gree, yet it may be he has no grace in that eminent degree which some others have. Hence some Christians are compared unto <HI>Babes,</HI> others unto <HI>grown men.</HI> 1. Cor. 3.1. Some to <HI>children,</HI> others, to <HI>fathers</HI> 1. Joh. 2.13.
<PB N="102" REF="000415_0106_0FA5B61EEB58A248"/>
As there is a Difference in spiritual gifts, that one Saint does very much excel another; so there is in grace. The grace of one does ex∣ceed the grace of another, as much as the strength of a <HI>man</HI> is above the strength of a <HI>child.</HI> Now inasmuch as grace is <HI>fruit</HI> (as was shewed) the more grace any man hath, the more <HI>fruit</HI> does he bear.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They that do most good are most fruitful.</HI> Grace will prompt a man to be doing good. Hence the more grace he hath▪ the more <HI>good</HI> will he desire and endeavour to do. The Lord Jesus Christ, who is in this Chapter compared to a vine, was the most fruitful vine that ever was. Like <HI>Iotham</HI>'s Vine, and like his Fig-tree▪ which had <HI>good fruit,</HI> whereby <HI>the heart of God and man was c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eered.</HI> Judg. 9.11, 13. He was alwayes doing good, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 8.24. <HI>I doe alwayes the things that please Him,</HI> Now no∣thing pleaseth God but that which is good. When a Christian is in some measure like <HI>Christ,</HI> that all that have occasion to converse with him, <HI>are,</HI> or <HI>may be</HI> the better for him, then he is one that bears much fruit. As (I remember) <HI>Iunius</HI> saies concerning that Lear∣ned and holy <HI>Vrsin,</HI> that <HI>He never went to con∣verse with him about any matter, but he was the better for it, he heard something from him that was for his edification.</HI> This is to <HI>bear much fruit.</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="000415_0107_0FA5B61FDBEFBBC0"/>
When a Christian shall be very instrumental for the good of others, he is abundantly fruit∣ful. It was said of <HI>Iehojada,</HI> that he had <HI>done good in Israel both towards God, and towards his house.</HI> 2. Chron. 24.16. So they that have done much good in their Generation, have brought forth much fruit. And the truth is, A man cannot do greater good in this world, than to promote the good of the souls of men: Therefore to be <HI>abundantly</HI> instru∣mental in the Conversion, and Edification <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> souls, is to be <HI>very fruitful.</HI> That some take to be especially intended in the words of my Text, <HI>If you bear much fruit,</HI> h. e. by private and public endeavours for the good of im∣mortal souls, then God will be glorifyed. Hence in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6<HI>th</HI> verse of this Chapter Christ sayes, <HI>I have ordained you▪ that you should goe and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain.</HI> The fruit which the Apostles brought forth by the Sermons which they preach'd, and by their Writings, remains to this day unto the Edification of the Church of God.</P>
<P>We proceed then to the 3<HI>d.</HI> Enquiry▪ viz▪</P>
<P><HI>In what respects, or upon what accounts fruit∣ful Christians are said to glorify God?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>Because fruitful Christians do make it appear that God is a glorious One.</HI> Men are
<PB N="104" REF="000415_0108_0FA5B620611ED220"/>
not said to glorifie God, as though they made him more glorious than he was before, for that is impossible: Their goodness does not extend to Him: God's Essential Glory is infinite, and therefore its impossible that there should be any addition thereunto: But when Christians bear much fruit, they delare His glory before the world. They make it ma∣nifest that the LORD is a Glorious GOD. 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.9. <HI>That you should shew forth the</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raises <HI>of Him,</HI> or the <HI>vertues of Him.</HI> The <HI>Virtue,</HI> the Power of God is shewed forth, when his people are made fruitful. When grace is wrought in the soul, the mighty <HI>Pow∣er</HI> of God (which is his <HI>Glory</HI>) is exerted and manifested. And so it is when they <HI>act</HI> and <HI>exercise</HI> grace. <HI>e. g.</HI> When a Christian does exercise much patience under affliction, the power of God is thereby magnified and mani∣fested to the praise and glory of his Name. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.11. <HI>Strengthned with all might accord∣ing to his</HI> glorious <HI>power, unto all patience and long-suffering with Ioyfulness.</HI> Its wonderful to see with what patience some Christians en∣dure their Temptations and Afflictions: but it is from the glorious power of God strength∣ning their hearts and spirits. Again, That such poor, weak creatures as the children of men are, should be enabled by Faith to
<PB N="105" REF="000415_0109_0FA5B621FAE22860"/>
encounter with and to overcome sin, Satan, &amp; the world! this shewes the glorious power of God. Besides all this, The more a Christ∣ian does abound in fruits of Charity and Ho∣liness, the more like he is unto God. The Lord is good, and <HI>He does good:</HI> Therefore they that doe much good are like to Him. <HI>do good</HI> (said Christ) <HI>that you may be the chil∣dren of your Father which is in heaven.</HI> Mat. 5.44, 45. that is to say, that you may be like to Him, as children resemble their Father: That the world may <HI>in</HI> you and <HI>by</HI> you see som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thing what God is, what glorious perfections are in his Nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When Christians bear fruit as they ought to do, they cause the Name of God to be blessed and praised.</HI> That may be meant by these words, <HI>Herein is my father glorified.</HI> h. e. this will tend to his praise. Isai. 60.21. <HI>Thy people shall be all righteous, — the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.</HI> h. e. by meanes of whom I shall have praise and glory. As for fruitful Christians, there are many that do bless them, and bless God <HI>for</HI> them. All the Churches in <HI>Iudea,</HI> when they understood what a fruitful Christian <HI>Paul</HI> was, they blessed God for him, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.23, 24. <HI>They heard that he which persecuted us in times past, now preached the faith which once he destroyed:
<PB N="106" REF="000415_0110_0FA5B62289677880"/>
&amp; they glorified God in me.</HI> By meanes <HI>of</HI> him &amp; <HI>for</HI> him they praised God. <HI>Titus</HI> also, was a fruitful Christian, and the holy Apostle blessed God for him, 2. <HI>Gor.</HI> 8.16. <HI>But thanks be to God who put the same earnest care into the heart of Ti∣tus for you.</HI> And he exhorts the <HI>Corinthians</HI> un∣to <HI>fruitfulness</HI> from this consideration, that then many would bless God for them. If you (saith he) be serviceable unto others, they will glo∣rify God▪ and there will be many Thanksgiv∣ings to God, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.12.13. Yea, The F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itfulness of Christians doth sometimes cause the world to think and speak well of the Name of God; that the world will say, sure∣ly God is a good God, whose servants are thus good, &amp; that God is a holy God whose servants are thus holy. Hence Christ said to his Disci∣ples, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.16. <HI>Let your light so shine before men that the may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>I pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed to make some <HI>Aplication</HI> of this Doctrine. 1 <HI>st.</HI> By way of <HI>Instruction</HI> or <HI>In∣formation.</HI></P>
<P>Instr. 1. <HI>Hence fruitful Christians are dear to God.</HI> His <HI>Glory</HI> is dear to him, and there∣fore they that are active instruments in glori∣fying his Name, must needs be dear to him. <HI>They abide in his love,</HI> as Christ here speaks. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd thence it is that their prayers can do much
<PB N="107" REF="000415_0111_0FA5B624AC0C2368"/>
with God. Whatever they ask, he is ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o grant them. They no sooner <HI>speak,</HI> but <HI>speed.</HI> It is because God has a special delight in the persons of such as love to glorifie his Name, and so in their <HI>prayers.</HI> The Lord Je∣sus Christ said, <HI>Therefore doth my Father love mee, because I laid down my life. Ioh.</HI> 10.17. So God does therefore love some Christians a∣bove others, because they are more fruitful, and He has more glory to his Name by them than he has by others. Not that God's love of <HI>Good-will</HI> does at all depend upon the works or goodness of men: Nor was He at all mo∣ved from the fore-sight of any fruit or gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cious Qualifications in them, to set his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon them; but because He has loved t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m, therefore they become fruitful. Only His <HI>love of delight</HI> in them, is more or less according to the measure of the fruit which they bring forth to his praise and glory. Men if they have Vines or Trees in their Orchards which are very fruitful, they take a peculiar delight in them. So does the Lord doe. <HI>Iob</HI> was the most fruitful Saint in the world in his time; and how was the Lord taken with him! <HI>Cap.</HI> 1.8. <HI>Hast thou considered my servant Iob, that there is none like him in the earth!</HI> The Lord seems to <HI>glory</HI> in having such a good and use∣ful servant as <HI>Iob</HI> was. <HI>Moses</HI> was a most
<PB N="108" REF="000415_0112_0FA5B6263A585338"/>
fruitful man, and brought more glory to God than any one in the world in the Age wherein he lived, and God delighted in him: yea, he was so dear to God as that He could not bear to have any one speak an ill word of him, <HI>Numb.</HI> 12.7, 8, 9. But especially when <HI>Young</HI> men are abundantly fruitful, the Lord does <HI>exceedingly</HI> delight in them: As we see in that instance of the Apostle <HI>Iohn,</HI> of whom Ecclesiastical Story reports that he was the youngest of all the Disciples, but <HI>one and twen∣ty</HI> years old when he began his public Ministry and Apostleship: and he was <HI>the disciple whom Iesus loved.</HI> To see a man so <HI>young</HI> so set up∣on glorifying God, was very pleasing. If a man has in his Orchard a <HI>young</HI> tree loaden with fruit, he takes delight in looking upon it: A young man that is alwayes doing good, the Great God never looketh upon him but with delight.</P>
<P>Instr. 2. <HI>Hence it is a very great mercy to have an oportunity of being fruitful.</HI> there is no creature capable of a greater happiness than to be an active instrument of glorifying God. Therefore opportunities that way are singu∣lar mercies. I remember an eminent Divine that was wont to say, <HI>My</HI> opportunities <HI>are my greatest riches.</HI> To be improved in publique Service for God amongst his people is a won∣wonderful
<PB N="109" REF="000415_0113_0FA5B62668BEF820"/>
favour; and it is a very evil thing to decline all such advantages for Service to the Name of God. Not that a man is alwaies bound to make use of every opportunity: For God may be so gracious to him, as to put ma∣ny great opportunities into his hands, more than he can make use of. And then he must consider with himself, <HI>In which of these shall I be like to bring the greatest and most lasting glory to the Name of God?</HI> and let him be sure to doe that. But when men shall out of passion or discontent, or for any carnal ends, decline all publique Service for Christ and for his People, it is certain that their hearts are not set upon glorifying God as they ought to be, and that they don't act grace but corruption. Moreover, It is a great happiness to be call'd to Suffer for God's Name and Truth. <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.29. <HI>Vnto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but to</HI> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffer <HI>for his sake.</HI> Not that Sufferings are in <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mselves</HI> desire∣able, only as then and thereby we have an op∣portunity to glorifie God. In that respect if you be reproached for the Name of Christ, happy are you, for on your part He is glori∣fied. Its then a great mercy to have an op∣portunity to be either <HI>doing</HI> or <HI>suffering</HI> for Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="000415_0114_0FA5B6279D87EBD8"/>Instr. 3. <HI>Hence they that call themselves Christians, and yet bear litle or no</HI> fruit, <HI>are a dis∣honour to the blessed Name of God.</HI> And yet alas how many such are their! Christians who are barren fig-trees, or barren Vines in the Lord's garden, that have the leaves of Profession growing on them, but not the Fruits of pract∣ise: That when the Lord cometh to them looking for fruit, He findeth <HI>nothing but leaves,</HI> a meer formal profession, of whom He may justly say <HI>cut them down, why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umber they the ground</HI>? There are others that have <HI>blossoms</HI> only. Convictions of sin and Duty, and be∣ginnings of Reformation are Blossoms. Many have had <HI>these</HI> who never brought forth the fruit of true Repentance, and Faith, and Ho∣linass. Oh how have they dishonoured God, and what a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> case are their souls in! Naturalists <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that if a tree blossome, and yet does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bear fruit, it is many times a sign that it will dye; So when persons have Convictions, and Troubles of Consci∣ence, and begin to set upon the practice of ho∣ly Duties, but notwithstanding these illumi∣nations are not throughly <HI>converted,</HI> it is a sad sign that their souls shall dye forever. The Apostle speaks of <HI>trees whose fruit withered, without fruit▪ twice dead,</HI> Jude. 12. They that
<PB N="111" REF="000415_0115_0FA5B627CD5D7688"/>
have had convictons, and some external Re∣formations; and after that return to their former evil waies again, are <HI>twice dead.</HI> And don't we see some <HI>withered prosessors</HI> of Reli∣gion! The time was when they made a fair show, a glorious profession, but all is wither'd away into sapless Formality. Such may well fear that they were never truly implanted in∣to Christ, and therefore are they cast forth and withered.</P>
<P>And there are many true Believers, which tho' they bear fruit, yet but little fruit com∣paratively to what they should and might do. What barren hearts have they! Not so many holy thoughts therein as ought to be! what barren lips, that are not filled up with profit∣able discourse! This, verily is the great sin of many professors: They spend whole hours in Company with one another, and yet not <HI>one</HI> edifying word all that time. Nay, it may be their Comunications such, as they would be ashamed to say what they had bin speaking, if the holy Lord Jesus should suddenly break in upon them and demand what their discour∣ses were about. As he did when his Disci∣ples were in a house at <HI>Capernaum,</HI> the Lord asked them, <HI>what was it that you disputed among your selvs by the way? And they held their peace, for they had been disputing who should be the greatest.</HI> Mark. 9.33.34. They were asham'd
<PB N="112" REF="000415_0116_0FA5B628C6F17740"/>
to tell what discourses had pass'd amongst them. Is there not a great deal of unfruit∣ful Discourse amongst Christians when they meet occasionally? On a time there happ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned to be a number of Christians together, and their Discourse being frothy and fruitless, a young man in the room who was of a more serious and holy temper than the rest, took his pen and ink and for a while in Short-hand wrote down what every man said, and having so done, he pray'd them to tell him what eve∣ry man of them had spoken since they came together, but if you cannot (said he) I'le read to you what has passed in discourse: You (said he) spoke these words, and you (said he to another) uttered these words, and you (said he) to a third, had these Expressi∣ons: and when they heard over again what foolish talk had been among them, they were all ashamed. Certainly many good people are not so mindful as they should be, that of <HI>every idle word</HI> they must give an account to Christ in another world. Such dishonour God by their unfruitfulness.</P>
<P>And are men duly careful to glorify God with their outward <HI>Estates?</HI> Do they bear much fruit in <HI>that</HI> respect? Some that have considerable estates, how little good do they do with them! They can lavish out of the

<P>The Motive in the Text, is enough if there were nothing else to be mentioned. Where is there a man that has the heart of a Christi∣an in him, but above all things in this world, he desireth to glorifie God? <HI>So shall you be my Disciples,</HI> saith Christ. It is the spirit of a true Disciple of Christ to desire that God may be glorifyed, and therefore to endeavour to be fruitful. But moreover,</P>

But <HI>Private</HI> Christians also, may bear much fruit: They may set such an Example as many others may be the better for: And by their prayers they may doe much good.

No man did ever bring forth fruits of Righteousness, but it was by Christ Jesus, and therefore no man will be <HI>full</HI> of those fruits, Except he be in Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us labour for a Publick spirit, and for</HI> much <HI>of such a spirit.</HI> The reason why men bring no more fruit to the Glory of God, is because they have so much of a private, selfish spirit prevailing in them. All seek their own, not the things which are Christ's. The Prophet complain'd <HI>Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit to</HI> himself. <HI>Hos.</HI> 10.1. The man that's all for himself, will certainly be an <HI>empty, fruitless</HI> vine. the most fruitful Saints have alwaies been eminent for a publick Spirit. <HI>David</HI> was one that did bear much fruit, and he was of a publick spirit. <HI>He served his gene∣ration.</HI> He had great Advantages to have served <HI>himself,</HI> but his heart was set upon ser∣ving the generation wherein he lived. And <HI>Solomon</HI> brought forth much fruit: He also was of a <HI>publick spirit</HI>; wherefore he built <HI>God</HI>'s House before his own, and made quic∣ker dispatch with it. <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and <HI>Morde∣cai</HI> were fruitful Servants of God, and they
<PB N="118" REF="000415_0122_0FA5B62DFB4F1330"/>
were men that denied themselves much out of respect to the publick interest. Amongst the Apostles there was none did bear so much fruit as <HI>Paul▪ (In labours more abundant than they</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) And he was of a very public spirit. He made it the chief design of his life to do good to many. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.33. <HI>Not seeking my</HI> own <HI>profit, but the profit of</HI> many <HI>that they might be saved.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us be alwaies bearing fruit.</HI> That's the way to bear <HI>much</HI> fruit. He that bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fruit every day, will at last bear much fruit. A Christian should not let one day pass, with∣out some good. And therefore it is good for a man, as duly as the day passeth over his head, when night cometh, to call himself to an account before he goeth to sleep, and to ask, <HI>Where have I been this day? How have I spent my</HI> time <HI>this day? Have I gained any spi∣ritual good to my self, or done any good to</HI> others <HI>this day?</HI> Thus doe, and if upon Examina∣tion, you find that your time has been spent unprofitably, Oh fall down and mourn in the presence of God, and say, <HI>Alas O Lord, I have lost a day!</HI> I have read of a great <HI>Mo∣ralist,</HI> that would doe not much less than this comes to. How much more should a <HI>Christi∣an</HI> be careful to spend his time well every day! And he should endeavour to doe good where∣wherever
<PB N="119" REF="000415_0123_0FA5B62E88617648"/>
he cometh. He may doe good in whatever place he shall be. If he be in Com∣pany with others, he may doe good with his Tongue. Some have said concerning Dr. <HI>Preston,</HI> that he was the most fruitful Christian in the world in that respect. He would upon all occasions set on foot Edifying Discourse, either something that should tend to promote Knowledge, or should be helpful as to the practical part of Christianity. Or, If a man be alone; he may do good with his head and heart, he may be contriving for God's glory. He may be often thinking with himself, <HI>What shall I doe for God?</HI> Is there nothing that I may yet doe for God and His people, more than I have hitherto done? Yea, a Christian should endeavour so to walk, as that all he does may be <HI>fruit unto God.</HI> Therefore holy Thoughts of GOD should be still running in his mind. I could name a man to you, that could say, <HI>For the space of these</HI> ten years, <HI>excepting when I have been asleep, Thoughts of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave not been out of my heart a quarter of an hour together.</HI> We should have thoughts of God, in our Eating, Drinking, Buying, Selling, and in <HI>all</HI> that we doe. And explicit aymings at His Glory, should be in our hearts and thoughts very frequently every day. So will
<PB N="120" REF="000415_0124_0FA5B630E2C39110"/>
all that we do become fruit, and then we shall bear <HI>much</HI> fruit.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let us set before us the most holy and fruitful Examples for our Imitation. Take, my brethren, the prophets for an Example</HI> Jam. 5.10. Such as we read of in the Scripture who were Eminent for God, we should consider their Example, and endeavour to become like them. Or such of the Saints as we our selves have known or heard of. And hence the reading of the Lives of holy &amp; eminent servants of Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s certainly a good, and profitable thing: It may (by the blessing of God) be a meanes to cause us to become like to them in Holiness and Fruitfulness. But above all let us set the Example of <HI>IESVS CHRIST</HI> before us, and learn of Him. The best of men have had their failings, and so are not a perfect Copy to write after: But Christ did all things well, and never did amiss in <HI>any</HI> thing. <HI>He went up and down doing good. Act.</HI> 10.3. He came no where, but He did some good, brought forth some fruit there. We should remember that example. And if a Christi∣an be exercised with any Temptation, sup∣pose him to be persecuted, made the re∣proach of the world, slandered, and his life fought after! let him think with himself,
<PB N="121" REF="000415_0125_0FA5B632E2AC5BA8"/>
How did Christ carry it under such Tempta∣tions? Let me demean my self as near as I can as He did. Or if he be put upon any Service, Let him consider, If Christ had been called to such a Service, how would <HI>He</HI> have manag'd that work to the glory of the Father? And as He was, so let me be in this world. Every one of us here, calls himself a Christian: He that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself also <HI>so</HI> to walk, even as He walk∣ed. So shall we bear much fruit, and glorifie God.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSAL. LXXIII.28.</HI></BIBL>
<P>But it is good for me to draw near to God. —</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THere are two great Truths asserted in this <HI>Psalm,</HI> from both of which these words are an Inference.</P>
<P N="1">1. That God is good to his Servants, not∣withstanding all the evils which may befal them in the world. <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</HI> Tho' such may meet with many afflictions, yet God is good, yea and good to <HI>them</HI> in all. He intends them good and not hurt by the Temp∣tations which they may at any time be exer∣cised with. Now if God be so good to His
<PB N="124" REF="000415_0127_0FA5B6342E167258"/>
People, it must needs be good, and the best Course they can take to draw near to Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another thing asserted in this Psalm, is, That tho' wicked men who are strangers to God may be in present prosperity, yet it will not be long before they utterly perish, <HI>ver.</HI> 27. <HI>For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish, thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</HI> And therefore he concludes that it is good to draw near to God. If they perish that are <HI>far off,</HI> the Best and safest course is to get and keep <HI>near.</HI> Inasmuch as it cannot be <HI>ill</HI> with those that are <HI>with</HI> Him, nor <HI>well</HI> with those that are <HI>without</HI> Him, its a Rational and a necessary conclusion that <HI>it is good to draw near.</HI> And whereas the <HI>Psalmist</HI> sayes, It is good for <HI>me,</HI> Two Things are implyed,</P>
<P N="1">1 That for his own part he was resolv'd to practise according to what he here makes Pro∣fession of. 2. That tho the generality of men did not draw near to God, yet it would be good for them so to doe. He does not intend that it would be good for <HI>himself only,</HI> but it is equally true of all other men, and so they should find it, would they be perswaded to make the Experiment.</P>
<P>The Doctrine then is,</P>
<P><HI>That it is good for</HI> every <HI>man to draw near to God</HI>▪</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="000415_0128_0FA5B6349543C960"/>Drawing nigh to God is not not only in it self a good thing, but its good for them that sincerely do so.</P>
<P>Here <HI>two</HI> Things are to be enquired into. 1. When a man may be said to draw near to God. 2. How it does appear that it is good so to do.</P>
<P>QUEST. 1. <HI>When may a man be said to draw near to God?</HI></P>
<P>ANSW. 1. <HI>When he is brought out of a state of Nature into a state of Grace, he is brought near to God.</HI> There is a drawing nigh to God in re∣spect of a man's state, as well as an actual draw∣ing nigh to Him. A Sinner is in a state of Se∣paration from God. Therefore men in a state of sin are described to be <HI>a farr off. Eph.</HI> 2.13. It is said of the Prodigal, that <HI>he was a great way off.</HI> Luk. 15.20. Sin has made a vast and woful distance between the blessed God and the souls of men: it hath set their souls at an infinite distance from Him: But by true Conversion they are brought near to Him a∣gain. The Prodigal Son, when he came to himself, said, <HI>I will arise and</HI> go <HI>to my father.</HI> A repenting sinner <HI>goeth</HI> to God. Hence Repent∣ance is sometimes call'd a <HI>drawing nigh to Him.</HI> Jam. 4.8. <HI>Draw nigh to God, &amp; he will draw nigh to you, cleanse your hands you sinners &amp; purify your hearts you double minded.</HI> The Apostle having
<PB N="126" REF="000415_0129_0FA5B6355AB61AB0"/>
shew'd the evil of several vices, he prescribes one <HI>Catholic</HI> Remedy for them all, viz. <HI>Repentance,</HI> which he calleth a Drawing nigh to God, a Cleansing the hands, a Purifying the heart, an Humbling of themselves &amp;c. There must be Union and Reconciliation before there can be Communion. <HI>Amos.</HI> 3.33. <HI>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</HI> You and I (says God) are not agreed, and therefore how can we hold Communion? A sinner is an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emy to God, but a <HI>Converted</HI> sinner is become re∣conciled to Him. <HI>He is made</HI> nigh <HI>by the blood of Christ, and so hath</HI> access <HI>unto the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather.</HI> Eph. 2.13.18. Men by being <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nigh,</HI> they <HI>draw nigh:</HI> being by Faith and Repen∣tance <HI>brought</HI> ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to God through Jesus Christ, they ever after <HI>draw</HI> near to Him. This layeth the Foundation of all that Com∣munion which we have with God. It neces∣sarily implyes Union and Reconciliation with Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When men enter into Covenant with God, they draw near to Him.</HI> Such are said to <HI>joyn themselves to the Lord.</HI> Jer. 50.5. <HI>Isai.</HI> 56.6. As they that are wholly strangers to the Cove∣nant are said to be <HI>without God</HI> Eph. 2.12. &amp; to be <HI>far off</HI> Act. 2.39. So the Lord's Covenant people are said to be <HI>near</HI> to Him <HI>Isa.</HI> 57, 19. <HI>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, to him that is
<PB N="127" REF="000415_0130_0FA5B6361BB5C7D0"/>
far off</HI> &amp; <HI>to him that is near.</HI> That is, to the <HI>Gen∣tile</HI> and to the <HI>Iew. Paul</HI> hath respect to that Scripture in <HI>Isaiah,</HI> when he says, <HI>Christ came</HI> &amp; <HI>preached peace to you that were a far off</HI>; h. e. to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> who were strangers to the covenant: <HI>and to them that were nigh,</HI> i. e. to the <HI>Iews,</HI> who were nigh to God in respect of the Co∣venant. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.17. On this account the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were nearer to God than any other Nation in the world. <HI>Psal.</HI> 148.14. <HI>The Children of Israel, a people</HI> near <HI>unto Him.</HI> There is an <HI>external Covenanting</HI> with God, such may be <HI>really</HI> farr from God, yet they are as to their visible state near to Him. <HI>Ier.</HI> 12.2. <HI>Thou art near in their</HI> mouth, <HI>and far from their</HI> reins. And there is an Internal Cove∣nanting with God, when men give not their names only, but their <HI>hearts</HI> to God, devoting themselves entirely to His fear, and renounc∣ing all other Lords and Lovers in Compari∣son of <HI>Him,</HI> and for <HI>His</HI> sake. They draw near to God, who can truly say as His peo∣ple do <HI>Isai.</HI> 26.13. <HI>O Lord our God, other lords have had dominion over us, but by Thee only will we make mention of Thy Name.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When men</HI> worship <HI>God, they draw nigh to Him.</HI> Thus the <HI>Chaldee Interpreter</HI> para∣phraseth upon the Text, <HI>It is good for me to come to the worship of God.</HI> There is a <HI>special</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="000415_0131_0FA5B636D9419380"/>
Presence of God where He is worshiped; e∣specially in His <HI>Publique</HI> Worship. <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.24. <HI>In all places where I record my Name, I will come unto thee.</HI> When men come to worship, they are said to gather round about the holy God whom they serve, <HI>Psal.</HI> 89.7. <HI>God is greatly to be feared in the Assembly of His saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are</HI> about <HI>Him.</HI> Hence the Priests of old were said in a peculiar manner to draw nigh unto God, because they were constantly employed in holy Ministrations, <HI>Exod.</HI> 19.22. — <HI>the Priests which come near to the Lord.</HI> Their whole employment was a divine Service. <HI>Ezek</HI> 44.15. <HI>They shall come near to me, to minister to me, and they shall stand before me, to offer un∣to me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God.</HI> When men come to hear the Word, they draw near to God: They approach into His special presence, and must therefore attend with all humility and reverence, because in coming to hear, they present themselves into the presence of the <HI>Infinite</HI> MAJESTY. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 5.1. <HI>Keep thy foot,</HI> i. e. Be reverent in thy behaviour; For among the Eastern Na∣tions, Uncovering the foot did signifie the same that uncovering the head does with us, being a Testification of humble and reverend

respect, <HI>when thou goest to the Mouse of God, and be more ready to hear than to offer the sacri∣fice of fools.</HI> Which words shew that in hear∣ing the Word, men have to doe with God. They come into his <HI>House,</HI> &amp; approach into his <HI>solemn Presence.</HI> In <HI>Prayer</HI> also, men draw <HI>near</HI> to God. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.22. <HI>Having such an high p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iest, let us draw</HI> near <HI>with a true heart in full assurance of faith.</HI> The Apostle's meaning is, let us in sin∣cerity of heart pray unto God, being fully as∣sured that He will accept of us for the sake of Jesus Christ. Prayer is call'd a <HI>visiting of God,</HI> Isai. 26.16. A knocking at His door, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.7. <HI>Knock and it shall be opened to you.</HI> By Prayer men knock at heavens door. Prayer is nothing else but the souls Going up to God. Psal. 25.1. <HI>Vnto thee O Lord do I lift up my soul.</HI> When the Psalmist sayes it is good for me to draw near to God, Part of his mean∣ing is, it is good for me, that I should hear the Word of God, and that I should pray to Him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When men joyn themselves to the Church and and People of God, they draw neer to him.</HI> For there is a special presence of God in His Church. The name of that place is <HI>Iehovah Shammah,</HI> h. e. <HI>The Lord is there.</HI> Ezek. 48. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. His Church is his House. That particu∣lar Church in <HI>Ephesus,</HI> was <HI>the house of the living God.</HI> 1. Tim. 3.15. Every Church
<PB N="130" REF="000415_0133_0FA5B6384D7BC070"/>
is a Sanctury. Therefore God dwells therein <HI>Psal.</HI> 26.8. <HI>I have loved the habitation of thine house, and the place where thine</HI> honour <HI>dwells.</HI> His <HI>Honour</HI> i. e. GOD Himself, (Who is expressed by the Name of <HI>Honour,</HI> as also by the Name of <HI>Majesty</HI> &amp; of <HI>glory</HI>) dwells in His Sanctuary. He is to be seen there. <HI>Psal.</HI> 27.4. <HI>One thing have I desired,</HI> (h. e. one thing in a more peculiar manner) <HI>that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to be∣hold the Beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in His holy Temple.</HI> So that the Lord appears in His Beauty to those that are in His House, and there make enquiry after him. <HI>Psal.</HI> 63.2. <HI>To see thy Power and glory, as I have seen Thee in the Sanctuary.</HI> Every true and pure Church is Sanctuary, where much of God is to be seen. He walks in the midst of his Golden Candlesticks. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.1. Those holy Ordinances whereof the Church is the proper subject have much of God in them. Hence the Spouse speakes as in <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.4. <HI>The King hath brought me into his chambers,</HI> and Chapt 2. ver. 4. <HI>He brought me to the ban∣queting house.</HI> The holy Ordinances of God, are Christ's Chambers▪ and his Church is the Banquetting house where He does feed and feast the souls of his people. It is in a very peculiar manner true with respect to
<PB N="131" REF="000415_0134_0FA5B63C098F99F0"/>
that Ordinance of the Lords Supper, which is not regularly Administred but in a Church Assembly, Believers draw near to God therein, as near as is possible for men to do in this world. There the Lord is wont to shew him∣self after a gracious manner to the souls of his people, who do by Faith attend upon Him. When <HI>Ioseph</HI> and his Brethren did eat &amp; drink together in the same room, there was an in∣timacy of Communion between them, so there is between Christ and Believers in that Ordinance of the Lord's Supper. Christ, Himself is in the same Room, yea, and at the same Table with them.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>When men</HI> exercise Grace, <HI>then they draw near to God.</HI> This is the best drawing nigh to God; that which is most acceptable to <HI>Him,</HI> and most profitable to the souls of men. And it is peculiar unto true Believers. There is a drawing near to God externally; so <HI>Hypo∣crites</HI> may draw nigh unto him. <HI>Mat.</HI> 15▪8. <HI>Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah proahesy of you, saying, This people draweth near to me with their</HI> mouth, <HI>and honoureth me with their</HI> lips, <HI>bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their</HI> heart <HI>is far from me.</HI> There is more, over an Internal drawing near to God▪ which Hypocrites are strangers unto. They may have Communion with <HI>duties,</HI> but they have not real Communion with <HI>God</HI> in Duties. This
<PB N="132" REF="000415_0135_0FA5B63D3873EB68"/>
internal Communion with God, consists in those inward actings of Grace whereby the soul is carried out towards God. As now, When the Affections which are as it were the the <HI>feet</HI> and <HI>wings</HI> of the soul, are earnestly carried out after God. The soul that does indeed pant and breathe after Communion with God draweth near to him. <HI>Psal.</HI> 42:1, 2. <HI>As the hart panteth after the water brooks; so panteth my soul after Thee O God: My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God, when shall I come and appear before God?</HI> The soul which loveth and longeth to be where God is, hath Communion with him. <HI>Isai.</HI> 26.9. <HI>With my souul have I desired thee in the night, yea with my spirit within me will I seek Thee early.</HI> When there are actings of love and delight in God, the soul draweh near to Him Love is a marvel∣lous uniting affection. 1. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4.16. <HI>He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</HI> Therefore the more a Christian does exercise that grace of Love to God, the nearer will his Communion with God be. So when a man does renew and exercise Repentance towards God, he draweth near to him. Wherefore the <HI>Psalmist</HI> says, <HI>The Lord nigh unto them is that are of a broken heart. Psal.</HI> 34.18. He that con∣fesseth sin, with a broken heart for it, draw∣eth nigh unto God, and God draweth nigh to
<PB N="133" REF="000415_0136_0FA5B63D8F261128"/>
Him. The like is to be said concerning the Actings of Faith: As the wotkings of Unbe∣lief in the heart, are a soul-departure from <HI>God,</HI> Zeph. 3.2. <HI>She trusted not in the Lord, she drew not near to her God.</HI> So when the soul does indeed act faith upon Jesus Christ, when there is not only prayer but <HI>Faith</HI> in prayer, then there is a drawing near to God.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>This drawing near to God, implies constan∣cy in the way of Obedience.</HI> The <HI>Hebrew</HI> word [<HI>Kirbath</HI>] which is here used, signifyeth to <HI>cleave unto.</HI> Some read the words, <HI>Bonum est mihi</HI> adhaerere <HI>Deo,</HI> It is good for me that I should <HI>cleave unto</HI> God. This is call'd <HI>a walking with God &amp; an abiding with God</HI> 1. Cor. 7.24. They that are constantly careful to walk so, as not to displease the Lord, He delights to meet them, and to hold Communion with them. <HI>Isai.</HI> 64▪5. <HI>Thou</HI> meetest <HI>him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness.</HI> And therefore the Lord Jesus Christ hath said, <HI>If a man love Me, he will keep my words, and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him. Ioh.</HI> 14.23. But thus for the 1<HI>st.</HI> Enquiry▪ We proceed 2<HI>ly</HI> to enquire, <HI>How it does appear that it is good for every man to draw near to God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>ANSW.</HI> Several things may be mentioned which are clear Demonstrations of the Truth and Doctrine now before us.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="134" REF="000415_0137_0FA5B63EAD496240"/>1. <HI>To be separated from God, is the greatest</HI> Evil. Therefore to draw near to Him, must needs be <HI>good.</HI> Its a dismal thing to be banish∣ed out of the Lord's presence. <HI>Hos.</HI> 9.12. <HI>Wo unto them when I depart from them!</HI> A greater wo than that there never was, nor can there be. When the Sun withdraweth nothing but darkness follows. A great Part of the Punish∣ment of the of the Apostate Angels, is in their being Eternally separated from the face and favour of that God which made them. Guilty, trembling <HI>Cain</HI> thought his punishment into∣lerable in this respect. <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.13. <HI>Cain said unto the Lord, my punishment is greater than I can bear.</HI> Why, how so? <HI>ver.</HI> 14. <HI>From Thy face I shall be hid.</HI> Verily, The damned in hell have not a greater punishment than that inflicted on them. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.41. Depart <HI>from me ye cursed into everlasting fire.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> and <HI>sadest</HI> word in that dreadful Sentence is, <HI>DEPART from ME.</HI> There is more of Terrour in <HI>that,</HI> than in all the Fire and Brim∣stone of hell. In God's Favour is Life, and His loving kindness is <HI>better</HI> than life: There∣fore to be cast out of his Favour is <HI>worse</HI> than any Death. And if so, To have Communion with <HI>Him</HI> is the greatest happiness. For,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God is the Chief Good.</HI> There have
<PB N="135" REF="000415_0138_0FA5B64016DD7460"/>
been great disputes among those whom the world has accounted wise men, about the <HI>Chief Good. Austin</HI> observes that there were no less than <HI>two hundred eighty eight</HI> Opinions amongst the old Philosophers about the <HI>Chief Good.</HI> But <HI>we</HI> are are sure, that there is no Chief Good but God only. The young Noble-man in the Gospel did not know that Christ was God, and therefore when he called Him good, the Lord said to him, <HI>Why callest thou me good? there is none good but One, that is God.</HI> Matth. 19.17. There is no Chief Good but God. He is <HI>infinitly</HI> good: He is an <HI>alsufficient</HI> good. His Name is <HI>El-Shaddai:</HI> h. e. the God who is <HI>sufficiency.</HI> He has enough in Himself to satisfie his own infinite Self: And therefore more than enough to satisfie all creatures, whatever the wants, whatever the desires of of the souls of men may be; there's enough in God to satisfie them all. God is a <HI>Vniversal Good</HI>; so that it is impossible for a man to be miserable, if he hath God. This, doubtless was the reason why Jacob said, <HI>I have all. Gen.</HI> 33.9. It is translated, <HI>I have enough,</HI> but that was no more than <HI>Esau</HI> said: The <HI>Hebrew</HI> Expression is, <HI>Ieshli-Col,</HI> h. e. <HI>To me there's all.</HI> viz. because of his interest in God. Though a soul should have nothing else, If he hath God, he hath enough, he has <HI>all.</HI> All

outward losses are easily made up in God. Hence our Lord said, There is no man that hath left house, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for My sake &amp; the Gospel's, <HI>but he shall recieve an hundred fold now in this time.</HI> Mar. 10.30. Why! he shall have that Comfort in GOD which all these Creatures could af∣ford, and <HI>a hundred times more.</HI> The Cheif good is eminently <HI>all</HI> good. So that tho a man should loose all his worldly possessions, if he has drawn near to God, he may truly say, I have lost nothing: he may stand upon the ru∣ins of the whole world, and say I have lost nothing. And therefore may rejoice in all af∣flictive Changes and Bereavements. <HI>Hab.</HI> 3.17.18. <HI>Although the fig tree shall not blossome neither shall fruit be in the vine, the labour of the Olive shall fail, and the field shall yeild no meat, the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls, yet I will re∣joice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</HI> Observe how full and particular the Prophet's Expressions are: here is the Fig tree, and the Olive tree, and the Vine, and the Field, and the Flock, and the herd, if one of these should fail, relief might be hoped for from another of them; nay, Nay but, saith he, though they should <HI>all</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="000415_0140_0FA5B6414FB54938"/>
fail, though all creatures in the world should fail, God will never fail, and there's Com∣fort enough in that: happiness is in the Frui∣tion of <HI>HIM.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To draw near to god, is the way to be de∣livered from evil.</HI> The NAME of the LORD is a strong Tower which the Righteous run into and are safe. In evil Times <HI>God is good to Israel.</HI> Let what will happen in the world, they that draw near to him are safe. The Wiseman saith, <HI>surely I know that it shall go well with them that fear God.</HI> Eccles. 8.12. Such as are very careful to walk with God, do sometimes experience wonderful Tempo∣ral Preservations: As we see in <HI>Noah,</HI> unto whom God said, <HI>Come thou and all thine house into the Ark, for thee have I seen righteous be∣fore me in this generation.</HI> And in the Prophet <HI>Ieremie,</HI> whose very life was struck <HI>at</HI> &amp; sought <HI>after,</HI> and that by the great Ones of the world, but <HI>God hid him</HI>: he appeared for <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>God</HI> appeared for him. So He does often for his servants that keep in with Him. He is to them a very present Help in the time of Trouble. He shall hide them in the secret of his Presence from the pride of men, and keep them secretly in a Pavillion from the strife of tongues. However they shall have <HI>Spi∣spiritual</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="000415_0141_0FA5B6420B8DE6A8"/>
Preservations: The Lord will deli∣ver them from every evil work, and will pre∣serve them to his heavenly Kingdom. And if a Christian be grieved with inward, per∣plexing Thoughts, by drawing near to <HI>God,</HI> he may obtain help against them. This was the case of the <HI>Psalmist</HI>▪ as the Context shew∣eth: he was <HI>almost gone</HI>: his unbelieving thoughts had like to have been too hard for him: but he went into the Sanctuary, and there by drawing nigh to God in prayer, and hear∣ing of His Word, he got the victory over his Temptations, and a further Establishment in the wayes of God. All his Temptations issued in this, that he was made more sensible of his own infirmity, and had a more clear Discovery of Divine grace. This did he get by drawing near to <HI>GOD.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Communion with God, is a most sweet and comfortable thing to a gracious soul.</HI> Indeed Un∣regenerate men do not think so, because they never had Experience of it, but they that know what comunion with God meanes, have found Sweetness and Delight therein which cannot be expressed. Hence <HI>David</HI> could say, <HI>One day in Thy</HI> Courts, <HI>is better than a thou∣sand else-where. Psal.</HI> 84.10. Excellent was the Reply of a Noble Protestant, when
<PB N="139" REF="000415_0142_0FA5B642D413B5A0"/>
the Papists tempted him with offers of mo∣ney to forsake the Truth, and to turn Pa∣pist, <HI>Let that man's money perish with him, that does not prize one hours Communion with God, above all the gold and silver in the world</HI>▪ Communion with God in hearing his Word is sweet. Hence the Church saith of Christ▪ <HI>His mouth is most sweet,</HI> Cant. 5.16. When a Promise is set home upon the soul by the Spirit of God, how sweet is it! Or, when a man has been in great doubts and darkness about his spiritual estate▪ or concerning his way and Duty, but some word of God does enlighten and direct him, how sweet is it! what refreshing does his soul within him find! <HI>The statutes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Lord are right, rejoicing the heart, sweeter also than the honey and the honey comb.</HI> Psal. 19.8, 10. And Communi∣on with God in <HI>Prayer</HI> is sweet, <HI>Isai.</HI> 56.7. <HI>I will make them joyful in my house of prayer.</HI> Some of God's Children have found that Joy &amp; Comfort therein, as to make them forget their outward Afflictions. A holy man once having buried a Child who was dear to him▪ after he had gone and poured out his soul be∣fore God in secret, was chearful, an inti∣mate Friend enquirng the reason, he gave this Answer, <HI>I could be content to bury a child
<PB N="140" REF="000415_0143_0FA5B643D7D735E0"/>
every day, on condition that I might meet with as much of God every day as I have done this day.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The soul that draweth near to God, is</HI> bet∣terd <HI>thereby.</HI> Many times consolation followes thereon, but if not, that which is better than Comfort h. e. More Holiness is the fruit of sincere approaches unto God. Never any man did draw nigh to God after a right man∣ner but he was the more holy for it. The more Communion men have with GOD, the less Communion they will have with Sin. Every Act of real Communion with God tends to mortification of sin. This is one reason why the Saints in glory become <HI>impeccable.</HI> The <HI>Beatifical Vision</HI> makes them that they cannot sin. The more intimacy of Communion with God any soul shall attain unto, the more like will he be to God. A∣mongst men, he that shall converse much with another, will be apt to be like to him, and to drink in something of his spirit with whom he holds a free and familiar Conversation; So they that converse much with God, will sure∣ly become more like to him than what can be said of any other men. When <HI>Moses</HI> had near and intimate Communion with God in the mount, Divine Impressions were left upon his face: So are there upon the face of that
<PB N="141" REF="000415_0144_0FA5B6472D9353F0"/>
soul which shall be much in Communion with God. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. <HI>Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>All the Saints of God have found it good for them to draw near to Him.</HI> So that Uni∣versal Experience proves the Truth▪ of my Doctrine▪ As tis said in Job. <HI>To which of the</HI> Saints <HI>wilt thou turn thee?</HI> So I say, ask any of them whether it be not so, and they will ev∣ery one of them answer and say as the <HI>Psal∣mist</HI> heroe does, <HI>It is good for mee to draw near to God.</HI> Enquire of them, You have been at the Lord's Table, but did you ever find it good to be there? they'le say, we have met with <HI>God</HI> there, and we never met with him, but we found it good for us. Enquire again, Have you not found it good to draw near to God in the word and prayer? and they will give the same Answer. Some of them have spent many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole dayes in secret prayer to God, and some of these have they found to be like <HI>dayes of Heaven.</HI> How has the great God condescended to reveal Himself to His servants after a wonderful manner, when drawing near to Him in that Duty! It is
<PB N="142" REF="000415_0145_0FA5B649103ACCE8"/>
related concerning that eminent Saint Mr. <HI>Brewer,</HI> that not long before his death, he had such enlargements in his Closet-Duty as made him wholly regardless of this lower world. Once when his near Relation told him she feared he had injured himself by his rising so early, he replyed,
<Q>If you had seen such glorious things as I saw this morning in private praer with God, you would not have said so; for they were so wonder∣ful and unspeakable, that whether I was in the body, or out of the body with <HI>Paul</HI> I cannot tell.</Q>
This indeed was extraordi∣nary: But where is there a godly man, but he can truly say, he hath found that of God in Secret Prayer which he would not be with∣out for all this world? And if we could speak with the Saints in glory, They would every one of them say <HI>It is good for me to draw near to God.</HI> As <HI>Peter</HI> said when he saw Christ transfigured on the holy Mount, <HI>It is good for us to be here.</HI> So do the Saints in heaven say, Here we have our fill of Communion with God, It is good for us to be here. This is the <HI>Heaven of Heaven</HI> it self. A life of un∣interrupted Communion with God, that's Heaven. <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.23. <HI>To be with Christ which is far b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter.</HI> There's marvellous Rhetoric in that expression: <HI>[pollo mallon kreist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r▪] It is
<PB N="143" REF="000415_0146_0FA5B64A7B16ADB0"/>
much more better:</HI> The Apostle useth Com∣parative upon Comparative, which riseth high∣er than the superlative degree. Nothing is better, nothing is so good as to live a life of everlasting Communion with God and with Jesus Christ. One well saith, that <HI>The Saints in glory are alwayes experienting, and yet ever learning this Truth to Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>USE. 1. <HI>It is matter of heart-bleeding Lam∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utation, that there are so few who draw near to God.</HI> Alas, how many are there that con∣tent themselves to live in a state of estrange∣ment from God! They are Aliens to the Life of God, yea to a life of Communion wirh Him. The natural man knoweth not what it is to have Communion with God: All our Communion with God in this World is in some Ordinance or other, either Prayer, or Meditation, or Hearing the Word, or Reading, or in some other Ordinance, but are not these neglected? Church-Fellowship and the Lord's Supper are Divine institutions▪ It is lamentable to consider that so many of the rising Generation, do neither prize nor prepare themselvs for such enjoyments, they sin griev∣ously against the hope of their Fathers. For our Fathers came into this Wilderness for no other end, but only that so they might
<PB N="144" REF="000415_0147_0FA5B64B196E2D78"/>
build a Sanctuary for the Name of God, and enjoy Communion with Him therein. Now that their Children after them should so ma∣ny of them be careless about things of this Nature, is a Lamentation and shall be for a Lamentation. And are there not more than a few, that live in the neglect of prayer? Ah ungodly souls! The Scripture saith, <HI>every one that is godly shall pray.</HI> Psal. 32.6. He then that liveth without prayer, has no godliness, no grace in his soul. Are there not some that don't so much as pray in their Families? Men may make excuses for such neglects if they will, but there is a Scripture which falls upon them like a Thunderbolt of Death, and they cannot escape it, I mean that in <HI>Ier.</HI> 10.25. <HI>Pour out thy fury upon — the Families which call not on Thy Name.</HI> If there be a prayerless Fa∣mily in <HI>Boston,</HI> if there be a prayerless Family in <HI>New-England</HI> (as alas there are many) let them look to it, for the Fury of the Al∣mighty is ready to be poured out upon them. Others there are who neglect Closet Prayer. Verily, I cannot see how such a man can have the true fear of God in his heart, that does in his ordinary Course live a whole day together without secret Communion with God.</P>
<P><HI>VSE.</HI> 2. For Exhortation</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="000415_0148_0FA5B64BCF3B98E0"/><HI>Let men, yea, let</HI> every man <HI>be so good to</HI> himself <HI>as to draw near to God.</HI> Consider the present Times call for this. It's a dark and cloudy day: Without doubt there is a gra∣cious day of Mercy &amp; Salvation to the Church o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God near at hand. It may from Scripture and History be demonstrated that the <HI>Twelve hundred and sixty years</HI> allowed for the <HI>Beast</HI>'s Continuance is almost expired. But a little before break of day, how dark is it like to be▪ Now a child is not affraid though he be in the dark, if his Father has him by the hand. No more need we be affraid o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evil Tidings, if we <HI>draw near to GOD.</HI> It is now a great Question, <HI>What shall we do that we may be ac∣counted worthy to escape those things that are com∣ming on the world?</HI> The best Answer which I can think of is this, <HI>Let us draw near to</HI> God <HI>and</HI> one another <HI>in the Lord.</HI> And then God will either keep the storm from coming to us, or if it do come, it will but blow us the sooner to Heaven.</P>
<P>For Direction.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Take heed of sin.</HI> A great Sin is like a violent blast which bloweth the soul far from God suddenly. Sin and guilt upon the Consci∣ence makes a man affraid to look God in the face. When <HI>Adam</HI> had sinned he endeavour∣ed to run away from God, and to hide him∣himself
<PB N="146" REF="000415_0149_0FA5B64C955B3D48"/>
(had it bin possible) from His holy presence. Therefore watch against sin. Es∣pecially against such sins as will break peace with God, &amp; interrupt Communion with Him. All scandalous Sins will do so; yea, and sins of Infirmity, if they be not mourned for.</P>
<P N="2">2. In all our approaches unto the holy God, <HI>Let us be sure to bring</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>with us.</HI> Let every soul make sure of an Interest in Him, without Whom there is no drawing near to God. When the Law was given at Mount <HI>Si∣nai,</HI> the people stood <HI>afarr off</HI>: So Christless Sinners who are only concerned in the Cove∣nant of Works, are <HI>afarr off.</HI> The Lord saith to them as sometimes <HI>Ioseph</HI> to his Brethren, Except you bring Christ with you, you shall not see my face. And Beleevers must depend upon Christ for all acceptance with God, and that as to <HI>every</HI> Duty. The Apostle speakes of <HI>a better hope by which are draw nigh to God, Heb.</HI> 7.19. what is that <HI>Better Hope</HI> but the priestly Office, the Merit &amp; Mediation of Jesus Christ? were it not for that we should have no hope. How should Sinners come near that God who is a consuming fire, without a Mediator? Christ is is the way, and none can come to the Faher but by Him.</P>
