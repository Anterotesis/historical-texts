<P>Before I en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er further into the Proceedings of the last Assembly it will not be amiss to look back into, and enquire out the Causes of the Dissolution of the former, who took more pains to reconcile and unite the divided Inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts of their Country, than any that went before them.

If our Readers will consider this Correspondence, &amp; how steadi∣ly those Gentlemen have since adhered to the Chief Justice's Interest in the Affair of the Articles, exhibit∣ed against him, they will not think, those Gentlemen unjustly charged with deserting the Service of their Country at that Time with intent to screen the said Chief Justice from a deserved Publick Censure. Immediately after the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssolution of the last Assembly, his Excel∣lency the Governour, was pleased to issue Writs for Electing Members for a new Assembly; We imagine it cannot supprize any judicious Persons, that the Ar∣ticles of Complaint, against Mr. Chief Justice <HI>Smith</HI> should miscarry, when he shall be acquainted with the great Expence and Dilig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of that Gentleman to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his Friends into the House, he work'd upon the Hopes, the Fears and the Avarice of the Electors to gain his Point, every Election throughout the whole Province was more or less influenced by that Gentleman or his Friend: It is indeed much greater Cause of wonder, how there came to be so great a Minority as was in that House, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in so great a

Defection from the Interests of their Country, and not∣withstanding so powerful, so assiduous an Interest car∣ried on by that Gentleman and his Friends at the Last Election, with so much Profuseness and Extrava∣gance, so many Gentlemen should obtain Seats in that H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use, contrary to the Expectations and Designs of himself and his Friends. And that notwithstanding all Mr Chief Justice, his Assiduity and Expence at <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wbern,</HI> all his Perswasions and Promises of passing such favourite Bills as those, he depended upon were most Interested in, that after this, this very Assembly, which he flat∣ter'd himself he had moulded to his Wishes, should refuse to Vote the Articles against him, false, or him Innocent and Upright, contrary to the Motion of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecurer Friends in that House, and his own Expectations, and that those his own Friends, should not r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct the Articles against him, but only reject the Evidence and should unfortunately leave those Articles so much his dread, upon their Journals, still subject to a further Examination and Inq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iry.</P>

<P>We aprehend it will be proper for the clearer Un∣derstanding of the present Controversy for us to make our Observations upon the Proceedings as they passed in the House, Day by Day, rather then to Observe upon the whole at once, which may possibly render them confused and intricate so that we may unfortunatly by that Means disappoint the World.</P>
<P>On Monday <HI>Feb</HI> 11th Mr. <HI>Benjamin Peyton</HI> Member for the County of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> made the Motion afore∣mentioned, upon which ensued a very warm Debate, in which the Gentlemen, who were concerned in the Articles, seemed to decline the producing them to the House, at that Juncture for Reasons very plain and obvious, but the Gentlemen on the other Side tumul∣tuously insisting that the Chief Justice should be voted innocent and upright▪ notwithstanding no Accu∣sation then lay against him▪ and Mr. Speaker being very forward to put the Question, which he often during the Debate stated thus, <HI>Viz</HI> Whether Mr. Chief Justice <HI>Smith</HI> should not be declared by the House an impartial and upright Judge, and that he should re∣ceive the Thanks of the House for his good Services? It was then thought high Time to put a stop to such ex∣travagant Proceedings, and since Argument and Reason, had been found ineff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctual, to have recourse to some other Method, which induced Sir <HI>Richard Everard</HI> Baronet to rise up and accuse the said Chief Justice

of high Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors, and to pray a sufficient Time might be granted to exhibit Articles for that purpose to the House, and he was seconded by Mr. <HI>Samuel Swan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> The Chief Justice's Friends, who did not apprehend such a Consequence would proceed from Mr. <HI>Peyton's</HI> Motion, were very much Alarm'd thereat, and they knew that nothing could save their Friend, but straitning the Gentlemen who were to pro∣duce the Articles, as to Time, upon which those Gen∣tlemen insisted that they might be produced the next Morning, which occasioned another Debate, and the House were told that it looked as if they had no real Design to give their Country any Relief as to the Matters which might be contained in the Articles, since they seemed so desirous to Contract the Time, that the Articles ought to be well considered before they ap∣peared in the House, and that in the like Cases at home, sufficient Time was never deny'd; at last Mr. Speaker put the Question, If the Gentlemen should be allowed Time till Saturday, to prepare and bring in their Articles? which was carried in the Negative, but no notice is taken of this Division in the Journals of the House, and as many other Things are neglected in the course of this Proceeding, we shall upon every Division which happened upon any Question, relating to the Affair in Hand, constantly set down the Names o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Persons who Voted for and against the Question.</P>

</LIST>
<P>It is necessary here to mention two Points of no small Consequence to the Articles, which were deter∣mined by the House with dividing, and of which no mention is made in the Journals, the first was a Mo∣tion of Sir <HI>Richard Everard's</HI> to the House, seconded by Mr. <HI>Swann,</HI> that the Evidence which should be produced against the Chief Justice might be taken in writing, which was bore down by so great a Majority, that the Gentlemen who proposed the Question did not think proper to call for a Division upon it, the other was a Motion made to alter the Method of voting in the House, that upon any Question, the Names of the Members for and against the Question
<PB N="30" REF="004582_0031_100D69F20F6DEBB0"/>
might be taken in writing, which was also refused by the House; these two Motions being determined as aforesaid, the Gentlemen who were for the Articles were under a necessity to take Minutes of the Exami∣nations of the Evidences themselves▪ and it is from those Minutes that the Matters of fact in this Narra∣tive, as far as relates to the Articles are taken, and we assure the World that they are as near as may be exact as they were given in Testimoney to the House.</P>
<P>And whenever any Division of the House happn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d after that Determination upon any Question relating to the Articles, we constantly committed to writing the Names of the Members who Voted with us.</P>
<P>The seventh Article which thro' Accident came to be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct of the first E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiry was allow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by all Persons to be fully and substantially proved, and no one doubted but that the House would be of that Opinion which when Sir <HI>Richard Everard</HI> moved for, Mr. Spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ker who well knew that if the House was of Opinion that any one Article was proved, they could not avoid charging the Chief Justice with the Articles so pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved, obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted against that Motion, and desired that the House would not give their Sense of the Evidences to each Articles seperately in it's pro∣per Course, but that they would suspend any Deter∣mination whatsoever until they had gone thro' the whole Charge. This produced a warm D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bate in the House, and upon the Question it was carried accord∣ing to Mr. Speaker's desire by the Majority of one Voice.</P>
<P>Mr. Speaker could have no other view in this Proposal of his but only to perplex the Understandings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Members of the House by mixing such Articles which he knew ware) as Affairs had be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n managed) dif∣ficulties to be proved, with such Articles as he was confident wou'd be fully proved, and that the Question at last might be reduced to this, (as in fact it was) whether the Proofs that were produced and heard to Support the said Articles were sufficient for this House to Impeach the said Chief Justice. That was
<PB N="31" REF="004582_0032_100D31AEB1BB2F98"/>
the Question, and many of the Members who voted against the Articles afterwards owned that many of the Articles were sufficiently proved, but that the whole were not so well proved as might be expected in order to a Conviction: the small allowance of Time laid insuperable Difficulties upon the Gentlemen on the side of the Articles. Whether those Articles to which no Proof was produced, or which were not fully prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, could have been sufficiently proved we leave the World to determine, after they shall have perused the Proofs contained in the Appendix to this Narrative, and which would have been produced to the House, had Time been allowed But to return to the matter of fact given in Evidence to the House▪ upon the seventh Article; Mr. <HI>Iohn Bryan</HI> on his Examination upon Oath before the House declared that some Time be∣fore the last Circuit-Court held at <HI>Newbern,</HI> one <HI>Wal∣ker</HI> was committed to Prison by Captain <HI>George Roberts,</HI> upon the Complaint of Mr. <HI>Ioseph Hannis</HI> upon Sus∣picion of having stolen a Negro from the said <HI>Hannis,</HI> that some Time after the Commitment of the said <HI>Wal∣ker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hannis</HI> came to the said <HI>Iohn Bryan</HI> he being one of His Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty's Justices of the Peace for the County of <HI>Craven</HI> and desired him to let <HI>Walker</HI> out of Prison, for that his Negro was come home, and he was fully perswaded that his Accusations were ground∣less against him, and that he was sure <HI>Walker</HI> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver had the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gro; but he the said <HI>Iohn Bryan</HI> fearing that thro' Ignorance he might do wrong, he advised with <HI>William Wilson,</HI> Esq, Sherriff of <HI>Craven</HI> County, and with Mr. <HI>Seth Pilkington</HI> Guardian to the said <HI>Walker,</HI> who represented to the said <HI>Bryan</HI> that is was a very ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Case that <HI>Walker</HI> should be kept in Prison upon that Account, because the very Negro for which he was committed was Justice <HI>Walker</HI>'s Negro, in right of his Mother agreeable to a Law of the Island of <HI>Barbados,</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Hannis</HI> was possessed of that Negro no otherwise than as Administrator to the said <HI>Walker</HI>'s Father, but as Mr. <HI>Hannis</HI> who had been the Accuser had absolutely acquitted him, they were
<PB N="32" REF="004582_0033_100D69F44A8E2218"/>
of Opinion that the said <HI>Bryan</HI> might discharge h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the said <HI>Walker</HI> without any Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zard, and that if they were Magistrates they would do it; and Mr. <HI>Seth Pilkington</HI> the Guardian of <HI>Walker</HI> furth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r told Mr <HI>Bryan</HI> that if he would Discharge <HI>Walker</HI> he would give him his Bond to ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y him, which he afterwards did That the said <HI>Bryan</HI> upon this and having likewise examined the Commitment of the said <HI>Walker,</HI> which he found to be with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut Date, and without mentioning for what he was committed, and Mr. <HI>Hannis</HI> having informed him that he had en∣tered into no Recognizance to Prosecute the said <HI>Walker,</HI> he Discharged the said <HI>Walker</HI> out of Prison, and the said <HI>Bryan</HI> further declared upon his said Ex∣amination before the House that at the Circuit-Court at <HI>Newbern,</HI> he had information given him that the Chief Justice was displeased at this Proceeding of his, and that before the end of the Court he must expect to be call'd upon to Answer for so doing; upon this, the said <HI>Bryan</HI> attended about the Court and near the Court-House; but that he never heard himself call'd upon for that purpose, but one Day being near the Court-House Door he heard the Affair mentioned in Court with much heat by the Chief Justice, who pronoun∣ced the said <HI>Iohn Bryan</HI> fined <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> Procla∣mation Money, that he knows of no Information or Presentment made or fil'd against him, neither was there to his Knowledge any Oath made by any Per∣son against him, nor was he inform'd or believed that any was taken That the said <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hn Bryan</HI> heard a certain Person in Court whom he believes and took to be Mr <HI>Herritage</HI> Attorney at Law, move the said Chief Justice that he wou'd be pleas'd to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd for the said <HI>Bryan,</HI> and hear what he had to say for himself, that he was sure if his Honour was but acquainted with the Case he would mitigate the Fine, that he hoped his Honour meant <HI>Ten Pound</HI> Bill Money. The said <HI>Bryan</HI> declared upon his Oath that he heard some Person whom he took to be the Chief Justice, and was afterwards inform'd it was him, reply in these
<PB N="33" REF="004582_0034_100D69F6C6C34ED8"/>
Words as near as he could remember, I am well inform∣ed in the Affair, do you know Sir my Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iments better than I do my self, I do pronounce <HI>Iohn Bryan</HI> fined <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> Proclamation Money, and that to enlighten the Gentleman's Understanding; and the said <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hn Bryan</HI> further declared that an Execution was issued Signed by the said Chief Justice, directed to the Sheriff of <HI>Craven</HI> County to levy the said Fine upon the said <HI>Bryan,</HI> and that in Consequence of the said Execution he paid to <HI>William Wils<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sheriff the Sum of of <HI>seventy five P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unds</HI> Current Money of this Province, and took the said Sheriff's Receipt for the same. The Receipt mentioned by the said <HI>Bryan</HI> was pro∣duced to the House by Sir <HI>Richard Everard.</HI> There are some other Circumstances which would have been still a stronger support to this Article, forgot by Mr. <HI>Bryan</HI> in his Examination, for which we refer the Reader to the Appendix</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>William Herritage</HI> Attorney at Law and Clerk of the House of Burgesses, was call'd upon by Mr. Speaker in order to clear up this Article on the side of the Chief Justice, tho' by what he said he left it worse than he found it, after b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Sworn, he was ask'd if the said <HI>Bryan</HI> had been call'd in Court to Answer to the Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce for which he was fin'd, to which he b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieved he was, when the Court sat in the Morning of that Day in the Afternoon of which the said <HI>Bryan</HI> was fined, he also Swore that he appeared for the said <HI>Bryan</HI> at his D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire, but agreed to take no Fee for so doing and being asked whether he moved the Chief Justice in Court that <HI>Bryan</HI> might be sent for, and that the Fine might be Mitigated, he declared that he had so done, and that the Chief Justice made Answer to his Motion much as Mr <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hn Bryan</HI> had Sworn, and being further ask'd if any Enquiries had been made into <HI>Bryan</HI>'s Offence in open Court, if there was any Information against the said <HI>Bryan</HI>▪ or any Evid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce examin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon Oath in Court in Rela∣tion to the said <HI>Bryan</HI>'s Offence for which he was fined, he answered that he knew of none such.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="004582_0035_100D69F89E423B28"/>This was the whole Substance of Mr. <HI>Herritage</HI>'s Examination which was very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from answering the Ends intended by it; we leave to the World to judge if any Evidence be wanting to support this Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cle, and whether this Article alone is not sufficient to take away the Preten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of any Judge to the Character of Impartiality and Uprightness.

<P>Mr <HI>Ioseph Anderson</HI> Attorney at Law and formerly Clerk of the General Court, being upon Oath, was examined before the House as follows; he was asked if the said Chief Justice had taken the Oath directed to be taken by all Justices of the Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral Court for observance of the Jury Act, and whether the said Chief Justice had observed that Act, to which he re∣ply'd that the Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Justice had taken that Oath, and followed the Directions of that Act in drawing Jurors at a General Court in which he presided before he went for <HI>England</HI> but that ever since his return he had absolutely dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egarded that Act</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hibald Hamilton</HI> Attorney at Law, being Sworn was asked by the House; if the Jurys at the General Court since he had practised the Law at the Court, had been drawn according to the Dir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions of the Jury Act; to which he reply'd that the Jurors who were Summoned to app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve at the Gene∣ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urt have not been drawn by B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lot according to the Jury Act, but have b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en constantly Summoned by <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nire</HI> from the Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Justice without any regard to that Law▪ and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r ask'd if he ever heard the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f Justice a knowledge that Law to be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Force, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Oath by that Law directed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; Answered, that he heard the said Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Justice in open Court declare the Act of this Province for appointi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g indifferent jurym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in all Cases <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and criminal to be in Force, and that he had taken the Oath by that Act enjoined.</P>
