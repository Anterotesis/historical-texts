<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the preaching of the Cross, be to them that perish foolishness; <HI>and the Ministry of the Gospel, is by the World esteem'd a mean and contemptible Thing: Tet</HI> Infinite Wisdom <HI>has contriv'd, and</HI> Infinite Grace <HI>improv'd this Engine, for the bea∣ting down the strong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olds of Sin and Satan, in the Hearts of Men, for the rescue of Sins miserable Captive's, for the advancing the kingdom of Grace, and erecting Trophies, on the Ruines of Satan's In∣terest in the World. This it is, that has dissipated that Darkne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Heathenism, which heretofore co∣ver'd the face of the Earth: This, that has demo∣lished the Temples, laid waste the Altars, and ex∣tirpated the Votaries of the Heathen Gods; and seat the Gentile Worship packing to Hell: This, that notwithstanding its Original mean Appearance, has conquer'd and baffled all the proud Philosophy of</HI> Greece <HI>and</HI> Rome: <HI>This, that so stoutly withstood, and finally triumph'd over the fiercest Opposition of the haughty</HI> Monarchs <HI>and</HI> Potentates <HI>of the Earth: By this, are</HI> Christ's Ways made known in the Earth, and his saving Health among the Nati∣ons: <HI>And in a Word, By this,</HI> are the Eyes of
<PB N="ii" REF="002525_0004_0FDB5F52EB6FDF80"/>
poor perishing Sinners open'd, and they turned from Darkness unto Light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may have an Inhe∣ritance among them that are sanctified.</P>
<P>AND <HI>as this</HI> sacred Institution, <HI>is of last Im∣portance to the Souls of Men; so it is of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Con∣cernment, that</HI> they th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> take this Office upon 'em, are called of God, as was Aaron. <HI>For, as on the one Hand,</HI> it has pleased God, by the foolish∣ness of preaching, to save them that believe; so <HI>is it an awful Truth on the other Hand,</HI> That who∣soever entreth not by the Door, into the Sheep∣fold; but climbeth up some other way, the same is a Thief, and a Robber. <HI>He that appointed</HI> the Ministry of Reconciliation, <HI>as the ordinary Means of Salvation, That</HI> we cannot believe in him, of whom we have not heard nor hear without a Preacher; <HI>has also hedged in this weighty Trust, from the Intrusion of vain Pretenders, that</HI> none may Preach, except they be sent.</P>
<P>HENCE <HI>it appears a most d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring Usurpation, for any to assume the Character of</HI> Christ's Ambas∣sadors, <HI>that have not their Mission from him. And it would therefore be a commendable Zeal, in the </HI> High Church Party, <HI>to depreciate our Ministry, and to decl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> against our</HI> Invasion of the sacred Function; <HI>if their Arguments were answerable to their</HI> Confidence. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for such a small upstart Sect, gravely to attempt, by Arguments a hundred times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ed, to Unchurch all the</HI> Protestant <HI>World, but themselves; and to nullify all their</HI> Ordinan∣ces;

<HI>Rather exposes their Bigottry to Contempt, than their</HI> Zeal and Charity, <HI>to the envy of any thinking Person.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have no Sollicitude, to find out more of the Au∣thor of the Discourse herein impugned, than is dis∣cover'd p. 5. by his</HI> Jacobi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Principles, of</HI> Passive Obedience, <HI>and Non-resistance: nor should I have esteem'd his Arguments worthy of Notice, were it not for the malign Influence, they may have upon the</HI> Laity, <HI>for whose Use they were calculated, and into whose Hands, they are so carefully put. But for their sakes, an</HI> Antidote <HI>was thought Need∣ful.</HI></P>
<P>AN Apology <HI>may be justly expected from me, for undertaking a Task, that should have been left to some abler Hand: But I have none but this to make, That I could bear of no other, like to ap∣pear in the Cause; and therefore thought it neces∣sary, to hold up the</HI> Shield.</P>
<P>IF <HI>some Arguments occur in this Dissertation, that have been used before, in the same Controver∣sy, it must be remembred, that</HI> Truth is always the same; <HI>and that</HI> the same Thing must be re∣peated, to those that are dull of hearing.</P>
<P>I <HI>know that this Discourse must stand or fall, by the Reader's Censure; and therefore shall say no∣thing about it, but that I hope, it won't be wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A DEFENCE OF Presbyterian Ordination.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing more necessary, in the right managing of Controversy, than a fair stating the Debate; that Men fight not with their own Shadows, nor combate in the Dark: But of this, our Author had especial Reason to be cautious, since he design'd his Discourse for the Use of the <HI>Laity,</HI> who are not to be startled with such Questions, least they stumble at the Thre∣shold.</P>
<P>BUT though his Province was to <HI>Harrangue,</HI> and not to <HI>Argue,</HI> on which score, he may be excused from once mentioning the Question in debate; yet it may be of some Service to the clear understanding of this choice Discourse, to know the state of the Controversy. I shall therefore briefly, and fairly state the Case, in these two Propositions.</P>
<P N="1">I. WHETHER <HI>Bishops</HI> are by <HI>Divine Right,</HI> Supe∣riour to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and have by vertue of that Superi∣ority, the sole Power of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="002525_0006_0FDB13AEA63D5E20"/>II. WHETHER the English <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> that have some scores, and even hundreds of Congrega∣tions under their Inspection; with their <HI>lordly Dignity,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Power,</HI> are the only Scripture <HI>Bishops,</HI> on whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>ministerial Authority,</HI> and <HI>sacred Administra∣tion</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o necessarily depend.</P>
<P>BOTH of these, should have been most clearly, and fully prov'd in the Affirmative, before ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Author had erected his <HI>Trophies,</HI> and concluded his Pamphlet, with such confident Boasting, and pathetical Admo∣nitions.</P>
<P>IT's my present Business to examine his Perfor∣mance, and if in the Conclusion it appears, that he cannot find one Word in the Bible, to support this <HI>Prelacy;</HI> nor add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce any <HI>Commission</HI> from the <HI>King</HI> of the Church, for this extensive <HI>Dominion,</HI> or <HI>lordly Dig∣nity;</HI> I hope <HI>Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> may yet deserve, a more fa∣vourable Character in the World, than <HI>Intruders into the sacred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unction,</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the sacred Service;</HI> as the <HI>Prefacer</HI> of this Discourse, modestly stiles them.</P>
<P>THE first Thing that offers to our Consideration, (after some Account of the noble Views of this Au∣thor is a remarkable piece of <HI>History,</HI> which take in his own Words. p. 2. <Q>Now the Church, however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar∣rassed and disquieted, with a great variety of Dis∣putes and Debates, about Points of Doctrine and Discipline; yet heard little or no Noise made, for above 1400 Years, about this Point of Church Go∣vernment. One <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erius</HI> sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed a Debate, but had so few to second him, that it died with himself, and left his Name on Record among Hereticks.</Q> This deserves particular Consideration; for he would doubtless hereby insinuate, that <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cesan Epis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opacy,</HI> universally obtain'd in the Church, for the first four∣teen hundred Years; and met with no Opposition, but by <HI>Aerius,</HI> who got nothing by his upstart Opi∣nion,
<PB N="3" REF="002525_0006_0FDB13AEA63D5E20"/>
but the infamous Character of <HI>Heretick.</HI> But</P>
<P N="1">1. WOULD it not have been more to his Pur∣pose, to have proved, that <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy</HI> of the modern Stamp, was ever known in the Church for the first three hundred Years, or ever once asserted by any Author of Note, within that Time? This would have been an acceptable Performance; such I dare say, as the World was never yet blessed with. But what occasion of Proof? He no doubt conclu∣ded, that the <HI>Laity</HI> were obliged to take his Word.</P>
<P N="2">2. WAS there <HI>no Noise about this Point of Church Go∣vernment, for fourteen hundred Tears?</HI> Can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e have the Front, to publish such a Story to the World! I'm sure, he is not exceedingly well qualified to write upon this Subject, if ignorant, that <HI>Jer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> one of the most <HI>learned,</HI> and <HI>judicious</HI> of all the <HI>Fathers;</HI> did as exprestly assert, and vindicate the co-ordinacy of <HI>Bi∣shops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as ever <HI>Aerius</HI> did. Does he not in his Epistle to <HI>Evag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> expresly tell us, that <HI>the Apostle clearly teches, that Presb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters are the same with Bishops; and that afterw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rds, One was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lected, and put before the Rest, for the remedy of Schism?</HI>—And does he not in his Commentary on <HI>Titus,</HI> largely prove the Identity of <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>presbyter,</HI> by the very same Ar∣guments, that are used by the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> now? and plainly affirms, that <HI>a Presbyter is the same with a Bi∣shop; and before that by the Devil's Instin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arties in Religion, and it was said among the People, I am of Paul, I of Apollo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and I of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rches were govern'd by the common Council of Presbyters, &amp;c.</HI> And was <HI>Jerom</HI> the only Person among the Ancients, who maintain'd this Doctrine?

<P>I should now take my leave of this <HI>Historical in∣troduction,</HI> were it not for a pleasant Continuation, (or rather Contradiction) of this Story, in the very next Word: <Q>The goodly Order, (says he) and Go∣vernment instituded by Christ, stood firm for many Ages, and under it the Church flourished, and the Christian Religion mightily prevail'd, notwith∣standing the violent Persecutions of those Times: But at length it was invaded and suppressed, by the <HI>Usurpation</HI> and <HI>Tyranny</HI> of the <HI>Roman Papacy,</HI> a secu∣lar Power and Dominion was set up, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></Q> Was there <HI>no Noise for fourteen hundred years, about this Point of Church Government,</HI> and yet this Government invaded and suppressed, by the <HI>Usurpation</HI> and <HI>Tyranny</HI> of the <HI>Roman Papacy;</HI> and a secular Power and Dominion erected upon its Ruines? These Consequences do then, most naturally follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the Church Government he contends for, is the same with the <HI>Papal Hierarchy,</HI> according to the Pattern of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> before the Year of Christ 1400. For until that Period, there was <HI>no Noise about this Point of Church Government;</HI> nor was it <HI>suppressed by the Roman Papacy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THAT the <HI>Usurpation and Tyranny of the Roman Papacy,</HI> did not commence till the fifteenth Century. For by this, the Government he propugns, <HI>was sup∣pressed, and a secular Power and Dominion set up.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it's time I dismiss this <HI>History,</HI> and consider another, no less Remarkable; which I find in p. 3. where after a just Lamentation of the unhappy Dif∣ferences, by which the Church at the <HI>Reformation,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="002525_0008_0FDB5F5C56631828"/>
was disturb'd, and the common Enemy diverted; he proceeds to tell us, that <Q>among other Differences, this was one, that while the greatest and most con∣siderable Part of the reformed Church, retain'd the ancient Order and Government; and vindicated it from the Usurpations, and Encroachments of the <HI>Papacy;</HI> others, (upon what Consider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions I shall not en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uire) were pleas'd to set up a new Form, and Model of Policy.</Q></P>

Truly this Paragraph, That <HI>the greatest and most considerable Part of the reformed Church, retaind'd the ancient Order and Government,</HI> would tempt me to think so; had it been reconcileable to the rest of his Discourse.

<P>THUS we see, that the <HI>Divine Right of Episcopacy,</HI> was not known in the primitive Church; nor once profess'd by any of the foreign Reformers; and I may add, as little believed by the <HI>Church of England</HI> her self, in the beginning of the Reformation.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="consideration">
<PB N="9" REF="002525_0009_0FDB5F5DEC5A1C58"/>
<HEAD>The First HEAD consider'd.</HEAD>
<P>HE first undertakes, <HI>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what sacred Offices were instituted by Christ and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Apostles, in the Church.</HI> And the Sum of what he offers on this Head is, That these Offices were threefold.(I) <HI>The Twelve Aposties, whose Commission</HI> (he tells us) <HI>we have at large,</HI> Mat. X. (2) <HI>The Seventy Disciples, sent forth with the same Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ission, and the same Power: But though; their Commission was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch the same, with what was given to the Apostles, (who had not as yet receiv'd their full Commission) yet it is most certain, that they were two distinct Orders of Gos∣pel Ministers. (3). Deacons, who were invested with some share of the Apostolick Office, particularly of Preach∣ing and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as well as managing the publick Stock of the Church.</HI></P>
<P>I shall first take Noti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of his Instance of the <HI>Twelve Apostles,</HI> and the <HI>Seventy Disciples.</HI> Is it <HI>most certain, that they were two distinct Orders of Gospel Mi∣nisters?</HI> How does this appear? <Q>The <HI>Twelve</HI> (says he, P 10.) were particularly honour'd with the Ti∣tle of APOSTLES; but the <HI>Seventy,</HI> though they were sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forth immediately by Christ, are no where so called.</Q> But what is the meaning of the Word APOSTLE? Does it not signify a <HI>Messenger,</HI> or one Sent? And was it not because they were <HI>sent forth,</HI> that our Lord gave to the <HI>Twelve,</HI> the Title of APOSTLES? And were not the <HI>Seventy</HI> also said to be APOSTELEIN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Sent,</HI> Luk. X. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? Which every Body that understands any Greek, knowns to be the Word, from whence APOSTLE is deriv'd. And does not the <HI>Evangli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> with Allusion to the Mission of the <HI>Twelve,</HI> tell us, fore cited Luk. X. 1. That <HI>af∣ter these things, the Lord appointed other Seventy also, and</HI> SENT <HI>them?</HI> Other <HI>Seventy</HI> What?

<PB N="10" REF="002525_0010_0FDB5F5F56AC2360"/>
he did not appoint 'em such now, they were so be∣fore: But other <HI>Seventy Apostles,</HI> or <HI>Messengers,</HI> which is the same thing. These indeed, were not sent out as the <HI>Twelve,</HI> to Gospelize the Nations after Christ's Resurrection. And therefore, were never APOS∣TLES, in the Gospel Dispensation: But for this Temporary Mission, had the same Commission, the same Powers, and the same Denomination with the <HI>Twelve.</HI> If they were not expresly called <HI>Messengers,</HI> they are said to be SENT, which implies it.</P>
<P>BUT there's one invincible Argument yet to be consider'd; and that is, <Q>When a Vacancy falls in the College of <HI>Apostles,</HI> by the Apostacy of <HI>Judas,</HI> what a solemn Work was there, at the translation of one from the Number of Disciples, (of the <HI>Seven∣ty</HI> I suppose he means) that he might be reckon'd and numbered with the Eleven.</Q> But who told him, that <HI>Matt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ias</HI> was one of the <HI>Seventy?</HI> Is it possible to prove this? If not, it is not <HI>put beyond all Question,</HI> as he vainly boasts: But on the contrary, it's beyond all Question with me, that instead of being two dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct Orders of <HI>Gospel Ministers,</HI> they were neither of them <HI>Gospel M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nisters</HI> at all, by vertue of the <HI>Commissi∣on</HI> he speaks of. For how could they be <HI>Gospel Mi∣nisters,</HI> before there was any <HI>Gospel Church?</HI> Certain it is, that they were then under the <HI>Jewish Oeconomy;</HI> and that the Christian Church was founded on Christs Resurrection, &amp; therefore, could not have <HI>Officers,</HI> be∣fore it had a Being. But what need I insist? These Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages are effectually answer'd, beyond all possibi∣lity of Reply, by two of his own Party. Hear what they say.</P>
<P><Q>WHEREAS (saith Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. on Luk. X. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>) some compare the <HI>Bishops</HI> to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> the <HI>Seventy</HI> to the <HI>Presby∣ters</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="002525_0010_0FDB5F5F56AC2360"/>
of the Church; and thence conclude, that divers Orders in the Ministry, were instituted by Christ himself. It must be granted, that the An∣cients did believe these two to be divers Orders; and that those of the <HI>Seventy,</HI> were inferior to the Order of the <HI>Apostles;</HI> and sometimes they make the Comparison here mentioned: But then it must also be granted, that the Comparison will not strictly hold. For the <HI>Seventy</HI> receiv'd not their Mission, as <HI>Presbyters</HI> do from <HI>Bishops;</HI> but immedi∣ately from the Lord Christ, as well as the <HI>Apostles;</HI> and in their first Mission, were plainly sent on the same Errand, and with the same Power.</Q> Thus he. And</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sage</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vind. of the Prin. of the Cypr. Age, Cap. 6. Sec. 5.</NOTE> has more plainly and fully clear'd the Cause. <Q>It is obviously observable (says he) in the Evangelical Records, that the Christian Church was not, could not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded, till our Saviour was risen; Seeing it was to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded on his Resur∣rection. Our Martyr <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rian,</HI> as appears from his Reasonings on divers Occasions, seems very well to have known, and very distinctly to have observed, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves, got not their <HI>Commissi∣on</HI> to be Governours of the Christian Church, till after the Resurrection; and no Wonder, for this their Commission is most observably recorded Joh. XX. 21, 23, 23. No such thing any where recorded, concerning the <HI>Seventy.</HI> Nothing more certain, than that <HI>that</HI> Commission which is recorded Luk. X. did constitute them only <HI>Temporary</HI> Missionaries, and that for an Errand, that could not possibly be more than <HI>Temporary.</HI> That <HI>Commission</HI> contains in its own Bowels, clear Evidences, that it did not In∣stall them, in any standing Office at all, much less,
<PB N="12" REF="002525_0011_0FDB5F667433C118"/>
in any standing Office in the Christian Church; which was not yet in being when they got it. Could that <HI>commission</HI> which is recorded Luke X. any more constitute the <HI>Seventy,</HI> Standing Officers in the Christian Church, than the like <HI>Commission,</HI> recorded Mat. X. could constitute the <HI>Twelve</HI> Governours of the Christian Church? But it's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the <HI>Commission</HI> recorded Mat. X, did not constitute the <HI>Twelve,</HI> Governours of the Christian Church; other∣wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, what need of a new <HI>commission</HI> to that pur∣pose, after the Resurrection?</Q></P>
<P>NOW let the Reader judge, whether the disparity of the <HI>Twelve</HI> and <HI>Seventy,</HI> ben't a very tottering Foundation, to build their <HI>Episocopacy</HI> upon.</P>
<P>BUT it's Time I take notice of his Third sort of Officers; and consider whether <HI>Deacons</HI> were invested with some share of the <HI>Apostolick Office,</HI> particularly of <HI>pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ching</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> The only way to know what was their Office, and what their Power, is to have recourse to their Original Institution; we find it in Acts VI. 2, 3. <HI>It is not reason, that we should leave the Word of God, and serve Tables; therefore Brethren look you out, seven Men of honest Report, full of the Holy Ghost and Wisdom, whom we may appoint over this Business.</HI> Is here the least shadow of Authority, for their <HI>preach∣ing</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?</HI> Is not is propos'd as the whole of their Work, to <HI>serve Tables?</HI> And is it not plainly in∣sinuated, that they had no Authority to <HI>preach</HI> or <HI>bap∣tize,</HI> in that the care of the Church Stock, was com∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed unto them on purpose, to disentangle those from secular Encumbrances, whose Business this was; that they might not be forc'd <HI>to leave the Word of God?</HI> I would therefore, with respect to these <HI>Deacons,</HI> re∣mind this Author of the Apostles Challenge, Rom. X. 15. How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> except they be sent?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002525_0011_0FDB5F667433C118"/>BUT he tells us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> That <HI>Philip by his preach∣ing, converted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and initi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the Converts there, into the Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Baptism.</HI> To which it's sufficient Answer, that <HI>philip</HI> was an <HI>Evangelist.</HI> Acts XXI. 8. and in that Capacity, <HI>preach'd</HI> and <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptized.</HI> He infinuates indeed, that he was dignified with that honourable Title, on account of his <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>bap∣tizing:</HI> But I'm sure he can't find the least hint in the Bible, to countenance such an Insinuation. But were it granted, that <HI>Deacons</HI> as such, may be <HI>Evange∣lists;</HI> they must then have Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction: For <HI>the Work of an Evangelist</HI> (saith Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) was this, to lay the Foundations of the Faith in barbarous Nations, to constitute them Pas∣tors,</HI> &amp;c. and so at length, according to his own Scheme, <HI>Deacons</HI> are become superiour to <HI>Presbyters,</HI>and even co-ordinate with the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves.</P>
<P>THUS we see, that there is not such a difference as he pretends p. 12. <HI>between these Gospel Deacons, and those so named under the Presbyterian Model.</HI> If any of these want <HI>Ordination,</HI> it is in those Congregations, where there is not Church Stock to commit to their Care. And I confess, we are not very fond of ordaining Men to a Work, that we know 'em not furnished to discharge.</P>
<P>HAVING thus undermin'd his Foundation, his Fabrick must necessarily fall. I'll however take the Pains to pull it to pieces, and see what Materials it's made of.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS on the Second HEAD.</HEAD>
<P>HIS next Business, he tells up P. 13. is, <HI>to make it appear how these Offices were distinguished, and to demon∣strate an Imparity among them.</HI> This he essays, by such a tedious and impertinent Harrangue; that <HI>di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="8 letters" DISP="〈8 letters〉"/>s

estinvenire, quam vincere.</HI> It's much more dif∣ficult to know what he would be at, than to answer his Arguments, if there be any thing under this Head, which deserves that Name.</P>
<P>BUT that I may make way for a distinct Consi∣deration of what he ought to have prov'd under this Head, I'll state the Case particularly.</P>
<P>THE Office of <HI>Apostles,</HI> was either <HI>Extraordinary</HI> and Temporary, or <HI>Ordinary</HI> and Perpetual. 'Twas by vertue of their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Office, that they were denominated APOSTLES. Which appears from this, that this Title was given them, on Account of their being sent abroad, of their unfixed Charge, and iti∣nerary Circumstances; and therefore, none but these thus <HI>extraordinarily</HI> sent forth, are any where in Scrip∣ture, distinguish'd by that Appellation. But even they themselves, as ordinary Officers in the Church, are stiled <HI>Presbyters.</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> V. 1. and 2 <HI>Feb.</HI> V. 1. and 3 <HI>Job.</HI>V. 1.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Apostles</HI> were <HI>extraordinary</HI> Officers, he himself grants; and tells us, p. 33. (as such) what their Powers and Gifts were, which take in his own Words. <Q>'Tis acknowledged, that some Things peculiar to the first <HI>Apostles,</HI> were <HI>Extraordinary</HI> and Temporary, and expired with their Persons: such as, their hav∣ing been Eye and Ear Witnesses of Christ's Life, Doctrine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Miracles, Suffering, Resurrection, and Ascentio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; their having received their Commission immediately from Christ, their being infallible Guides, in delivering the Doctrines of the Gospel, their unlimitted commission to all the World, and Jurisdiction over all churches, their Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> con∣fer miraculous Gifts on others, to discern, Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its, and to back their Censures with corporal Puni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ments, as on <HI>Annanias</HI> and <HI>Sapp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ira,</HI> and <HI>Elimas.</HI></Q> Thus for their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Power. But besides this,
<PB N="14" REF="002525_0012_0FDB5F67926D3190"/>
they had <HI>ordinary</HI> Functions, common to other <HI>Mini∣sters</HI> of the Gospel; Such as Preaching, dispensing the Sacraments, ordaining others to the Work of the Ministry; and governing the Church. These things premised, I come now to consider the Question, which should have been,</P>
<P>WHETHER the <HI>Apostles</HI> in the exercise of their ordinary Function were <HI>Bishops,</HI> superior to <HI>presbyters.</HI> This he ought to have demonstrated, if he would have done any thing to the Purpose: But what his Performance is, we shall see by the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uel.</P>
<P>THE first Method he proposes for clearing the Cause, is indeed the only right one, and if duly pro∣secuted, will infallibly answer. It is to consider their <HI>Commissions.</HI> Let us then consider them.</P>
<P>As for the first <HI>Commission</HI> he speaks of, I've alrea∣dy shewn, all Discourse upon that subject to be meer tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing. But true it is, that <HI>when Christ was to leave the Earth, having finished the Work of our Redemp∣tion, be gave the Apostles their Commission, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t 'em into the actual Exercise of their Apostolick Power and office.</HI> Mat. XXVIII. 18, 19, 20. and Joh. XX. 21. Upon this he makes a long <HI>common-place,</HI> in which he dex∣trously acquits himself. But it's to be observ'd, that he all along considers the <HI>Apostles,</HI> as acting by ver∣tue of this <HI>Commission,</HI> in the exercise of their <HI>extraor∣dinary</HI> and temporary Power; and therefore, (as we heard before) spends his Breath to no Purpose Where∣fore, since I have no Controversy with him, about their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Power, I shall not waste Time, in animadverting on the Imperfections of his Discourse, on that Subject: But immediately consider, whether he finds any distinct <HI>Commission</HI> for <HI>Presby<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers,</HI> where∣by their Authority appears subordinate to that of the <HI>Apostles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in their ordinary Function. He promises P. 18. <Q> To consider the <HI>Commission,</HI> given to the other
<PB N="16" REF="002525_0013_0FDB5F6FE3B042D0"/>
Order of Church-Officers instituted by Christ, the <HI>Seventy Disciples,</HI> in whom the Order of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and ordinary <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> is suppos'd to be founded.</Q> And why does he not produce it? If there were any such <HI>Commission,</HI> it is easy to tell us where we may find it. But the plain Truth is, had he search'd till <HI>Dooms-day</HI> for a <HI>Commission</HI> for <HI>Presbyters</HI> distinct from what was given to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> he must have return'd with a <HI>Non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inventus.</HI> And <HI>where it is not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad, the King must lose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Right.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Consideration, of the Unity of the <HI>Commis∣sion,</HI> furnishes me with an Argument, unto which I challenge the whole Tribe of the <HI>Prelatists,</HI> to give a Rational Answer. It is this.</P>
<P>THEY <HI>that are authorized by the same Commission, have the same Office and Authority.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>all the Ministers of the Gospel,</HI> (the Apostles themselves, in their ordinary Capacity not excepted) <HI>are authorized by the same Commission.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE, <HI>it necessarily follows, that they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same Office and Authority.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Major</HI> of this Argument is self evident; and the <HI>Minor</HI> must stand good, until our Adversaries can produce two <HI>Commissions,</HI> by which Gospel <HI>Ministers</HI> are authorized to the discharge of their Trust.</P>
<P>ENOUGH has been said already, about the Suc∣cession of ordinary <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> to the <HI>Seventy;</HI> that there needs no more Words about it.</P>
<P>BUT he has one old thread-bare Argument, to prove the Imparity he pleads for, which has been so often exploded by those of his own Party, and so of∣ten resuted by the <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> that the mention∣ing it at this time of Day, is perfectly ridiculous. However, let's hear what he has to say. <Q>From the Account we have (says he, P. 19, 20.) of them, and their Ministry, in the Sacred History; we can't
<PB N="17" REF="002525_0013_0FDB5F6FE3B042D0"/> 
frame a more just and true Notion of this second Order of Church Officers, than that they were in∣stituted to be Assistants and Helpers to the Apostles in the Work of the Gospel. And I know nothing which will give us a better Reason for this Notion, than this Consideration; that as it is the same <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> the same <HI>Master-builder,</HI> who had framed the Civil and Ecclesiastical Policy among the Jews, under the Legal Dispensation, who does erect this new Fabrick of the Gospel Church; so it's reasonable to expect as great Symmetry and proportion between the one and the other, as the Difference of the two Dispensations will allow, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></Q> Unto which he adds Instances of <HI>Aaron</HI> and his Sons, install'd in the Priests Office, and the <HI>Levites</HI> subor∣dinate unto them; and <HI>Moses</HI> in the State, and the <HI>Seventy Elders</HI> subordinate unto him.</P>
<P>THIS Argument, (as indeed most others, adduced by the Party) was consecrated in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> School <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Bellarm. de Cler. Cap. 14.</NOTE>. And the <HI>Romanists</HI> have more Reason to be fond of it, than our <HI>Episcopalians;</HI> unless they also, are for an Universal <HI>Papacy.</HI> For as the <HI>High Priest</HI> in the Jewish Church, and <HI>Moses</HI> in the State, were but one; with the other Orders under them, so should there be (by this Argument) but one <HI>Bishop</HI> (the <HI>Pope</HI>) in the Chri∣stian Church; to whom all others should be sub∣jected.</P>
<P>BUT let the Cause be duly weighed, and I think neither of these can get much by it.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEN, has not our Lord dissolv'd the Jewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Polity, chang'd their Priesthood, and erected another Constitution? Hear the <HI>Apostle</HI> on this Head, Heb. VII. 12. <HI>For the Priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity, a change also of the Law.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="18" REF="002525_0014_0FDB5F715567B4B0"/>2. THE Jewish <HI>High Priest</HI> was appointed for a particular Function, which no Officer in the Gospel Church, has any Concern with. <HI>He was daily</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>to offer up Sacrifices, first for his own Sins, and then for the People.</HI> Heb. VII. 27. and <HI>to enter into the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e alone, once every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, not without Blood; which be offer'd for himself, and the Errors of the People.</HI> Heb.

<P N="3">3. THE whole <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nick Priestbood</HI> was Typical, and had its full Accomplishment in Christ the Anti∣type; it cannot therefore, have any Continuance under the Gospel. The <HI>Apostle</HI> call's this Legal <HI>Priest∣hood,</HI> with all its Appendages, <HI>a Shadow of Good things to come.</HI> Heb. X. 1. And when the Substance is come, the Shadows are done away. But after all,</P>
<P N="4">4. I'm willing to grant, that <HI>the same Lord and Law∣giver,</HI> (to use this Authors Words) and <HI>the Same Master Builder,</HI> who appointed his Worship and publick A∣doration in the <HI>Jewish Synagogue,</HI> has translated the same into the Christian Church; and thereby has maintain'd a great <HI> Symmetry and Proportion,</HI> between the one and the other. But this is so far from being any Service to the impleaded <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> that it utterly destroys it. Let us hear what two of the most learn∣ed and judicious Divines the Church of <HI>England</HI> could ever boast of, say on this Subject.</P>
<P>THE first is Dr. <HI>Bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observat. on the 1 Can. p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>. <Q>Among the <HI>Jews,</HI> (saith he) he who was the chief of the <HI>Synagogue,</HI> was called CHAZAN HAKENESETH, <HI>The Bishop of the Congregation,</HI> and SHELIACH TSIBBOR, <HI>The Angel of the Church.</HI> And the Christian Church being model'd, as near the Form of the <HI>Synagogue,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="002525_0014_0FDB5F715567B4B0"/>
as they could be; as they retain'd many of the Rites, so the Form of the Government was conti∣nued, and the Names remain'd the same.</Q> And a∣gain <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Observat. on the 2 Canon P. 83.</NOTE>,<Q>In the <HI>Synagogues,</HI> there was first one, who was called the <HI>Bishop of the Congregation;</HI> next the three Orderers and Judges of every thing about the <HI>Synagogue;</HI> who were called TSEKENIM, and by the Greeks <HI>Presbuter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i,</HI> or <HI>Gerontes,</HI> that is <HI>Elders;</HI> These order'd and determin'd every thing that con∣cerned the <HI>Synagogue,</HI> or the Persons in it.

<P>THE second is Dr. <HI>Stillingsleet</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iten. P. 257.</NOTE>, <Q>What shew of Reason (says he) can be given, why the Apostles should slight the Constitution of the Jewish Syna∣gogue, which had no dependance on the Jewish Hierarchy, and subsisted not by any Command of the Ceremonial Law? The Work of the Synagogue not belonging to the Priests as such, but as Persons qualified for instructing others. And again, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">bid. p. 264.</NOTE> We are to take Notice, that the Rulers of the Church under the Gospel, do not properly succeed to the Priests and Levites under the Law; whose Office was Ceremonial, and who were not admitted by any solemn Ordination, unto their Function.</Q> Thus he, with much more to the same Purpose. By which we see, that if our Author <HI>Knows nothing that will give us a better Reason of his Notion,</HI> of the <HI>Imparity</HI> of <HI>Gospel Ministers</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than the different Orders in the <HI>Jewish Priest∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood,</HI> (as he tells us P. 19. he does not) we are not like to be much distress'd with his Arguments.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002525_0015_0FDB5F72E77D44A8"/>THUS having done with the Consideration of the <HI>Commissions</HI> given to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and those of a dis∣tinct Office and Order, he promises P. 23. <Q>To shew next, the <HI>Apostles</HI> Authority over other <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> in the Church, from Several Instances of their exercising it, in several Respects and Ways, as is recorded in the sacred History.</Q> And he grave∣ly undertakes for eight Pages together, to exemplify this. But what need of this Pains? Since it's what was never yet called in Question; nor ever like to be, unless his weak trifling Reasons on the Subject, give occasion for it. But has he brought one single Instance to prove, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> as <HI>Bishops,</HI> in the Exercise of their ordinary Office, were superior to other <HI>pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers?</HI> Not one Syllable to this Purpose! But on the contrary, we find him P. 25. mentioning <HI>Timothy,</HI> (a <HI>Bishop,</HI> as he afterwards tells us) as an Instance to prove, that those inferior <HI>Pastors</HI> serv'd with the <HI>Apostles in the Work of the Gospel, as Sons with their Fathers.</HI> And also bringing in the <HI>Ru∣lers of the Church</HI> among these inferior Orders, P. 29.

<P>THERE's no need I should longer attend upon his impertinent Discourse on this Subject; I will therefore hasten to some</P>

<P>WHICH is <HI>to examine, whether any of these Offices were Extraordinary and Temporary; and to prove that they were not: But design'd to be perpetual, and standing in the Church.</HI> And this he tells us P. 32. is <Q>The Hinge, on which the whole Controversy depends;
<PB N="21" REF="002525_0015_0FDB5F72E77D44A8"/>
ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, all the Authority and Obligation of Christ's Institution, as to the present Church.</Q> One would think, that we are now in a fair way for compromi∣sing all the Controversy between the <HI>Prelarists</HI> and the <HI>Presbyterians;</HI> and of procuring general Releases from both Parties; for he acknowledges, <HI>That the Apostles extraordinary Powers</HI> (as we have heard him be∣fore describe them) <HI>are ceased;</HI> and <HI>that it was only the ordinary Power and Authority of the Apostles, which was to serve the Edification, good Order and Government, of the constituted Church in all succeeding Ages;</HI> which he pleads for. And if the perpetual Permanence of the <HI>Apostles</HI> ordinary Office, will satisfy; I'll be Security for all the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in the Realm, that they shall heartily acknowledge it: And demand no other Terms in order to their Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ormity, than this very reasonable one; that the <HI>Episcopalians</HI> shall plead for no other Powers, as belonging to the <HI>Apostles</HI> ordina∣ry Function, but what they can prove from Scripture. But it's well, if this don't prove a Bone of Contenti∣on at last; for I find this Author, without the least Shadow of Proof, P. 34. a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erting it to be part of their ordinary Office, <Q>To superintend both Pastors and People, to settle good Constitutions, agreeable to the Word of God, for the orderly and decent Per∣formance of all the Ordinances of Religion, publick Worship, and other Affairs of Discipline, as the Ex∣igence of the Church should require, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></Q> And if these things be not granted him, all his fine Scheme will come to nothing, and his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aborate Treatise</HI> may be even used for waste Paper. And yet the <HI>Presbyte∣rians</HI> can by no Means by brought into these Con∣cessions.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY can't allow, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> as ordina∣ry Officers, were to <HI>superintend</HI> both <HI>Pastors</HI> and Peo∣ple; because there is not one lisp in the Bible, of
<PB N="22" REF="002525_0016_0FDB5F747026EB68"/>
such a <HI>Superintendency</HI> belonging to any ordinary Of∣ficer. But on the contrary, the whole Government is committed to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> without any to <HI>superintend</HI> them. See 1 Pet. V. 1, 2. <HI>The Elders who are among you I ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort, who am also an Elder,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the Oversight</HI> (Epis∣copountes) <HI>thereof.</HI> Whence I argue,</P>
<P><HI>IF presbyters are not only to Feed the Flock of God; but to take the Oversight thereof, or to discharge the Bishops Office over it,</HI> as the Original Word signi∣fies. <HI>They are under the Superintendency of no ordinary Officer in the Church.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>the former is the Words of the Text; and there∣fore the latter true.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. NOR can the <HI>Presbyterian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> grant, that Christ has left it with any ordinary Officers, to settle any <HI>Constitutions</HI> in his Church. Because (as our Author himself truly tells us p. 39.) <HI>We know what a dreadful curse is pronounced against them, who either add to, or take away from, the Institutions of Jesus Christ, in the</HI> 18 <HI>and</HI> 19 <HI>Verses of the </HI> XXII <HI>Chap. of the Revelations of St. John.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> are so incredulous, as not to take his bare Word in this Case, though given with the most positive Air; yet they have such Sparks of good Nature left, as to agree with him in this Conclusion; That <HI>there is nothing more evident, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Examination; than that Christ in instituting these Orders and Offices</HI> (in their ordinary Exercise) <HI>design'd, that they should be standing and unalterable Constitutions in his Church, to continue to the end of the World.</HI> And we will allow him too, the unalterableness of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Office; if he intends no more, (as he tells us P. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. he does not) than <HI>their ordinary Power and 
<PB N="23" REF="002525_0016_0FDB5F747026EB68"/>
Authority, which was to serve the Edification, good Order and Government of the constituted Church, in all succeed∣ing Ages.</HI> But is he means, as it seems he does, that the <HI>Apostolate</HI> (properly speaking) is a standing Order in the Church; here we must part ways, and he must bring very good Arguments to prove it, before he can make me his Proselyte. And whether he has such to offer, I'll now particularly consider.</P>
<P>HIS first Argument is taken from their <HI>Commission,</HI> and the Promise subjoyn'd, <HI>Lo I am with you alway, to the end of the World! But how could that be,</HI> (says he) <HI>if their Office was to expire with themselves?</HI> How indeed? <HI>We must therefore</HI> (as he says) <HI>understand it as a Promise not to them only; but to their Successors also.</HI> But the Question is, What is this Succession, unto which the promise is made? Is it a Succession in the <HI>Apostolate</HI> only? If so, there is then no <HI>Commission</HI> given, nor Promise made, to any but <HI>Apostles,</HI> and so consequently, there is but one Order of Gospel Mi∣nisters in the Church; none but <HI>Apostles,</HI> to discharge any Ministerial Function. But I hope he will allow us enough of these, to <HI>Disciple all Nations, to Baptize and to Teach 'em, whatsoever Christ has commanded.</HI> And I'M sure, the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> will be no loosers by that Bargain, let these <HI>Paroc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial Apostles</HI> be called <HI>Bishops, Presbyters,</HI> or what else our Author pleases. In a Word, this Argument is so far from establishing an Impari∣ty among the Ministers of the Gospel, that it plainly proves, that there is but one Order in the Church, since the <HI>Commission</HI> is but one; and the succession to the <HI>Apostles</HI> by vertue of that <HI>Commission,</HI> but one. If <HI>Bishops</HI> be the <HI>Apostles</HI> Successors; there are no <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> inferior to them. If <HI>Presbyters</HI> be the <HI>Apostles</HI> Successors, there are no <HI>Bishops</HI> Superior to them. Let which will be assum'd, the Consequence is the same. Thus we are prepar'd to attend his second Argument.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002525_0017_0FDB5F7C073FBA68"/>WHICH is taken from 1 Cor. XII. 28. <HI>God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that Miracles, then Gifts of Healing, Helps, Governments, diversities of Tongues.</HI> Whence he triumphs, <Q>God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath Set,—even he who settled the Ordinances of Heaven, which none can alter, hath fixed these different Orders in the Church.</Q> If this be so, that these Orders are fixed in the Church, these Consequences must necessarily follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT there are not only <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> but also <HI>Prophets</HI> distinct from both, fixed in the Church: For these are not only named with the o∣thers; but forced into a Class, distinct from them both. First <HI>Apostles,</HI> SECONDARILY <HI>Prophets,</HI> thirdly <HI>Tea∣chers.</HI> And thus, he who the last page, would allow us but <HI>One</HI> Order of <HI>Ministers,</HI> has now furnish'd us with <HI>Three,</HI> and by both spoil'd his own Scheme.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT will also follow, that <HI>Miracls, Gifts of Hea∣ling, and diversities of Tongues,</HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Church, and of perpetual Permanence. This Consequence cannot be evaded, by saying; that <HI>they are not distinct Offices from these, but extraordinary Gifts confer'd on them.</HI> For (to use his own Words) <HI>God hath Set, even he who settled the Ordinances of Heaven,</HI> which none can al∣ter, hath as well set <HI>Miracles, Gifts of Healing, and di∣versities of Tongues,</HI> as <HI>Apostles, Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers.</HI> To say that these are <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> the others not, is to quite destroy his Argument, from God's having SET those in the Church. For the Text assures us, that he hath SET these there also.</P>
<P>HIS third Argument, is taken from Eph. IV. 11, 12, 13. <HI>He gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Teachers; for the perfecting the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry, for the edifying the Body of Christ; till we all come in the Unity of the Faith,</HI> &amp;c, <Q>where it is plain, (says he) these Offices were
<PB N="25" REF="002525_0017_0FDB5F7C073FBA68"/>
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>inue till the Church should be perfected, fully brought in, and fully advanced; and till it should be beyond all hazard of being seduced; that is to say, until the end of the World.</Q> This Text is very agreeable to the former, and the Answer may be the same; that if these Offices are to continue to the end of the World, they are all of 'em to continue so long, and then we shall have four Orders of Church-Officers, besides <HI>Deacons,</HI> when he pleads for but three in all. And were that absurd, and even ridiculous Assertion of his p. 38, granted him, That <HI>these different Designations, dont import diffe∣rent Offices, but different Exercises of the same Office:</HI> yet the Text makes these as permanent as the other. His <HI>Apostles</HI> therefore, must (according to that Noti∣on) be <HI>Prophets,</HI> and <HI>Evangdists,</HI> to the end of the World, as well as <HI>Bishops.</HI> And when we find these fixed <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cesan Bishops,</HI> whilst such, not only endowed with the Gift of <HI>Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y,</HI> but travailing through the World, to <HI>Evanmgelize</HI> the Nations; we'll allow 'em to be the Apostles Successors.</P>
<P>BUT the plain Truth of the Business is, that the <HI>Apostolate</HI> was a Temporary Office, calculated only for the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant State of the Church; and as Such, trea∣ted of in both these Texts. And the ordinary Office of <HI>Pastor</HI> and <HI>Teacher</HI> only, to continue <HI>until we all come in the unity of the Faith.</HI> That the <HI>Apostolick Office</HI> was <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> and admitted of no Succession, I thus Prove.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Apostles</HI> had an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Call to their Office; and were never brought into it, in an ordi∣nary Way, and therefore when a Successor was ap∣pointed to <HI>Jud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> Act. I. they chose him by <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> that the Affair might be left wholly to God's De∣cision; and did not presume to separate him to the Work, by <HI>Ordination.</HI> Nor indeed, did the <HI>Apostles ever ordain</HI> any, to their own Office and Order. I 
<PB N="26" REF="002525_0018_0FDB5F7E2330F4F8"/> 
Challenge the World to produce one Instance of such an <HI>Ordination.</HI> But on the contrary, it is essential to the <HI>Apostolical</HI> Character, that they be <HI>Apostles, not of Men, nor by Men: but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the Dead,</HI> Gal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I. 1.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE were <HI>extraordinary</HI> Qualifications ne∣cessary to the Apostolick Office. We have them par∣ticularly mentioned, when a Successor was to be chosen to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Acts I. 21, 22. <HI>Wherefore of these Men which have companied us, all the time that the Lord Je∣sus went in and out among us, beginning from the Baptism of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, unto that same Day, that he was taken up from us; must one be crdain'd, to be a Witness with us, of his Resurrection.</HI> Whence it plainly appears, that none could be admitted into the <HI>Apostolate,</HI> but such as had seen Jesus, both before his Death, and after his Re∣surrection.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Apostles</HI> had an universal and <HI>unlimited Commission;</HI> and were sent to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Kingdoms, to Gospelize the Infidel Nations. On which account especially, they are distinguish'd by the Title of A∣POSTLES, as we heard before. It is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but Nonsense, to talk of <HI>Diocesan Bishops</HI> succeeding them, whose <HI>Power</HI> is limited.</P>
<P N="4">4. THERE were <HI>extraordinary</HI> Gifts confer'd on the <HI>Apostles,</HI> to qualify them for the Exercise of their extraordinary Power and <HI>Commission;</HI> such as the Gifts of Miracles, of Tongues, infallibility of Doctrine, transcendent E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icacy and Energy in Preaching, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> And as <HI>Spanbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius</HI> truly affirms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 3.

<P>HE teils us p. 41. That <HI>be need but do it, of the suc∣cessers to the Apostles; for when that is done, the other come in of course.</HI> But I enquire, how do they come in? Do they come in <HI>at the Door,</HI> or <HI>climb over the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld?</HI> I'm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, except they are Successors to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in their ordinary Office, he can find no <HI>Commission</HI> in the Bible, to bring them in. However, let us follow him in his own Path.</P>
<P>AFTER a triumphant Narrative of the Feats he has perform'd, under the former Heads; (which I think I have sufficiently animadve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed upon already) he proceeds to this Argument:</P>
<P><Q>EITHER <HI>Bishops</HI> must be the true Successors to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> or else they have no successors at all; and the <HI>Apostolick</HI> Order and Office is quite extinct; and the Church is totally depriv'd of the prime and chiefest Office, instituted by Christ, for its Edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ica∣tion, good Order, and Government.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Argument I acknowledge, is invincible; and therefore, I must yield the Cause, that <HI>Bishops are the Apostles true Successors;</HI> and that none but they have any Powers from the <HI>Commission,</HI> or any Claim to the
<PB N="28" REF="002525_0019_0FDB5F7FF7E31160"/>
Promise given to the <HI>Apostles.</HI> But then, the Ques∣tion is, who these <HI>Bishops</HI> are, whether the <HI>Arch-Bi∣sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> who su∣perintend many hundred Congregations; and none but such: Or whether it be the <HI>Pastor</HI> of each par∣ticular Congregation. If the latter be granted, we have no Quarrel with him on this Subject. If the former be supposed, he would have done well to have offered some Proof upon that Head. For though the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> do allow the Succession of <HI>Bishops,</HI> to the Apostles; they are not so good humour'd as to grant, what he in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuates P. 44. Without the least shadow of Proof; that these <HI>Bishops</HI> are superior to ordinary Pastors and Teachers; or that they pro∣perly succeed to the <HI>Apostolick Office.</HI> But whether we'll allow it or not, he is resolved to stand by the Cause, and defend it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possible. And could he justi∣fy what he further offers, as an Argument for his <HI>Episcopal Succession,</HI> he would I confess, bid very fair for it.</P>
<P><Q>IT's evident(says he) also from Scripture, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their own Time, did con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er on others the <HI>Apostolick</HI> Power and Authority.</Q> But how is this evident? He makes it evident to any Man that is resolved to believe it, from the Election of <HI>Matthi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> to the <HI>Apost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>late.</HI> <Q>Their (the Apostles) first work (says he P. 45.) was to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se one to succeed <HI>Judas;</HI> and by the direction of God, <HI>Matt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s</HI> is receiv'd into the Number of the Apostles.</Q> Did the <HI>Apostles</HI> con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er on <HI>Matth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> the postolick Power? No! It plainly appears that they neither did, nor could do it; in that they so solemnly refer the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se to God, by a <HI>Lot,</HI> and depend upon his immediate Direction. If they could (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuates) have committed the <HI>Aposto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck</HI> Office, into the Hands of other faithful Per∣sons, why did they lot <HI> ordain Matthias</HI> to the Charge,
<PB N="29" REF="002525_0019_0FDB5F7FF7E31160"/>
without referring the Election to God's immediate Decision? or why did they number him among the eleven <HI>Apostles,</HI> without <HI>Ordination?</HI> The Reason of this plainly is, because this Office was <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> and the Call to it must therefore be so too.</P>
<P>BUT he has more Evidence to produce, well wor∣thy of our most serious Attention! It is this. <Q>So when <HI>James</HI> the Brother of John, is killed by <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rod,</HI> another of that Name, was <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></Q> And is not this an invincible Argument, to prove, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> (who according to him were all of 'em Bishops) did confer upon others, the <HI>Apostolick Power</HI> and Authority, because <HI>James,</HI> who was one of the Apostles, was <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem?</HI> But he tells us. <HI>That this James, some will have to be another, than James commonly called the les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, one of the first Twelve Apostles.</HI> But who are these some? and why will they have it so? I'm sure no Man living can give a good Reason, why this <HI>James</HI> he speaks of, was not the Son of <HI>Al∣pheus,</HI> numbred with the <HI>Twelve.</HI> Mat. X. 3. And I'm as sure, that there is not one Word in the Bible to support this chimerical Notion, of his <HI>Episcopacy.</HI> And this, I think every body will be convinced of, when they see what is offer'd for the Proof of it. I will therefore give the Reader the Entertainment, of every Word this Author offers, to confirm this Point. And</P>
<P>FIRST he tells us <HI>'Twas be, to whom St. Peter</HI> (as <HI>Bishop of Jerusalem) notifies, his miraculous Deliverance.</HI> Acts XII. 17. A most convincing Argument! For we know, Peter could not notify his Deliverance, to any but Bishops.</P>
<P>HE subjoins, 'Twas <HI>he, who presided in the Council of Jerusalem.</HI> Acts XV. But how does that appear? I'm certain, there is not the least li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p of that kind, in the place refer'd to, unless his declaring his <HI>Sentence,</HI> or Opinion, of the Affair debated, be supposed an Evi∣dence
<PB N="30" REF="002525_0020_0FDB5F811803F300"/>
of it; and if so, <HI>Peter</HI> must also be <HI>President</HI> of that <HI>Synod;</HI> for he, as well as <HI>James,</HI> declares his O∣pinion of the Case before them. But were it granted, that <HI>James presided</HI> in the <HI>Synod</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> what will he get by it? Is every <HI>Moderator</HI> of a <HI>Synod</HI> a <HI>Bishop,</HI> in the Sense he pleads for? If so, there are many more <HI>Bishops,</HI> than he is willing to allow.</P>
<P>THUS we are come to the last Proof, of <HI>James's Episcopacy,</HI> and that is, <HI>It was He to whom St. Paul made his Address, when he came thither; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of whom he speaks, in the 19 Verse of the first Chap. of the Epistle to the Galations, whom he calls an Apostle, and the Lord's Brother.</HI> The Argument stands thus, <HI>Paul went in unto James;</HI> therefore <HI>James</HI> was a <HI>Bishop Paul</HI> calls him <HI>an Apostle, and the Lord's Brother;</HI> therefore he was <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem. Risum ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s amici.</HI> Can Men pretend to found their Faith upon such ridiculous Whimsies, the very mention whereof, is enough to excite Mirth, in the most <HI>fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gmatick Complexion.</HI></P>
<P>AND now let us see, what more he can offer to make it <HI>evident, that the Apostles did in their own time, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the Apostolick Power on others.</HI> <Q>Certain it is, (saith he) that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> were received in∣to the <HI>Apostolick Office; Paul</HI> immediately called there∣unto by Christ, at his Conversion; but <HI>Barnabas</HI> in the ordinary manner, when he received that new Name from the <HI>Apostles,</HI> which signifies Son of Con∣solation.</Q> I hope he won't pretend, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er'd the <HI>Apostolick</HI> Power on <HI>Paul,</HI> since he ac∣knowledges his immediate Call: And the <HI>Apostle</HI> him∣self informs us, 1 Cor. XV. 8. That <HI>Christ was seen of him, as of one born out of due time.</HI> By which it appears, he had that necessary Qualification for the <HI>Apostolick</HI> Office, a <HI>Sight of Christ.</HI> Though his Vision of Christ, and Commission of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, were late, and mira∣culous, on which account h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stiles himself <HI>an Abor∣tive.</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="002525_0020_0FDB5F811803F300"/>
And as to <HI>Barnabas,</HI> does he bring the least hint from Scripture, to prove his <HI>mediate</HI> Separation to the <HI>Apostolate,</HI> though he so confidently asserts it? Did he think, that his bare Word would be taken in this Case, without the least pretence of Proof? Or that it was a sufficient Argument, to prove his <HI>mediate Call,</HI> that <HI>he receiv'd a new Name from the Apostles, which signifies Son of Consolation?</HI> By a like Argument, this Author may expect to be an <HI>Apostle</HI> himself? he ha∣ving so famously merited the Name of <HI>Boanerges,</HI> by his Thunder against the Schismaticks. But I'm weary of such trifling, and will therefore see, if he can find any thing more to the purpose; when he comes to give <HI>Instances of some raised from among the ordinary Pas∣tors, to the Apostolical, or Episcopal Order.</HI></P>
<P>HIS first Instance is, The most Reverend Father in—, his Grace, <HI>Timothy,</HI> Lord <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> of <HI>Ephe∣sus.</HI> Of whom he tells us, p. 47. <HI>That Paul actually gave him an Episcopal power, over the Church of Epi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus, and the Presbyters and Pastors thereof.</HI> To which I An∣swer:</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Scriptures</HI> no where give so much as the Title of <HI>Bishops,</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus;</HI> and how then came they by that Character? The <HI>Postscripts</HI> do in∣deed call 'em <HI>Bishops;</HI> but every one conversant in Books, knows, that they are no part of the Canon of Scripture, nor to be found in any ancient Copy of the <HI>New Testament.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Timotby</HI> was so far from being <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Epbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> that it's abundantly evident from Scripture, he never was fixed there at all. Particularly, it's unaccountable if <HI>Timothy</HI> was there, that <HI>Paul</HI> should make no men∣tion of him, in his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Ephesians;</HI> as he does in all his other <HI>Epistles</HI> to the Churches, that to the <HI>Galati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> only excepted . It's a sure Evidence, that he was neither <HI>Bishop</HI> there, nor <HI>resident</HI> there. But let us
<PB N="32" REF="002525_0021_0FDB5F8294718158"/>
take a particular View of his <HI>Peregrinations,</HI> as we find them recorded in the Scriptures; and it will thence plainly appear, that if he was a fixed <HI>Bishop</HI> at any place, he was a pattern of <HI>Nonresidency.</HI> We find him at <HI>Corinth,</HI> when <HI>Paul</HI> wrote from thence, his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Romans.</HI> Rom. XVI. 21. He was with <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Phillippi,</HI> when he wrote his first <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Corin∣thians.</HI> 2. Cor. I. 1. He was with <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> when he wrote his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Phillippians</HI> from thence. Phil. II. 19. And also when he wrote his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Collossians.</HI> Col. I. 1. He was also his Companion when he wrote both his <HI>Epistles</HI> to the <HI>Thessalonians;</HI> as appears from the first <HI>Verse</HI> of each <HI>Epistle.</HI> We find him likewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e invited by the <HI>Apostle</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> to be helpful to him in the <HI>Ministry.</HI> 2 Tim. IV. 9, 10, 11. From whence, he intened to take him along with him, <HI>to visit the Churches of Judea.</HI> Heb. XIII. 23. To all which I may add, he was a <HI>preacher</HI> for some con∣siderable time, to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> 2 Cor. I. 19. And now, would it not make a Man smile, were he never so serious; to hear of a <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> who has the whole World for his <HI>Diocess;</HI> especially, when there is not the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Word in the Scripture, to coun∣tenance his having any fixt Charge there. Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ad∣versaries</HI> do indeed urge to that purpose, 1 Tim. I. 3. <HI>As I besought thee to abide still in Ephesus, that thou might∣est charge some, that they preach no other Doctrine.</HI> But the Argument is the quite contrary way. For to what end should the <HI>Apostle</HI> entreat a <HI>Bishop,</HI> to tarry in his own <HI>Diocess,</HI> when he could do no other, without of∣fending God, and neglecting his Duty?</P>
<P N="3">3. IT's certain, he was no Bishop of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> when the <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> took his last leave of that Church. For then he commits to the <HI>Presbyters</HI> the oversight thereof, and gives 'em a most solemn Charge of the <HI>Church,</HI> as the proper <HI>Bishop</HI> of it. Acts XX. 17. 28.
<PB N="33" REF="002525_0021_0FDB5F8294718158"/>
And yet this is the last time they ever saw the <HI>Apos∣tle's</HI> Face, as is evident from Verse 25. But it's time I consider, what our Author adduces, to prove this <HI>Episcopacy</HI> of <HI>Timothy.</HI></P>
<P><Q>HE is instructed (says he) in all the Exercises of the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Power, particularly to command and charge them, (the <HI>Pastors</HI>) that they <HI>Preach sound Doc∣trine.</HI></Q> And han't every <HI>Minister</HI> Authority, as <HI>Christ's Ambassador,</HI> to charge his Brethren as well as others, to be <HI>faithful?</HI></P>
<P><Q>HE was also (says he) to prescribe <HI>Rules</HI> for pub∣lick Worship; particularly that <HI>Prayers</HI> be offered up for all in Authority.</Q> That is, he was exhorted, 1 Tim. II. 1, 2, <HI>To Supplications, Prayers, and giving of Thanks, for all Men; for Kings, and for all that are in Au∣thority.</HI> Therefore was to prescribe <HI>Rules</HI> for publick Worship. The meaning no doubt is, that he was by his <HI>Episcopal Authority,</HI> to put out a New <HI>Common Prayer Book;</HI> since there is no praying for <HI>kings, and all in Authority</HI> without.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Instance of his <HI>Episcopal</HI> Power, as∣sign'd by this Author, is, That he was <Q>to examine and judge, Persons duly qualified for the <HI>Sacred</HI> Of∣fices of the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pel; and give imposition of Hands to, or to <HI>ordain</HI> none, but such as are found duty qualified&amp;<HI>c.</HI></Q> And what Inferrence would he make from hence? But that <HI>Timothy</HI> had the Power of <HI>Or∣dination,</HI> which he would have had, were he but a common <HI>Presbyter.</HI> If he would infinuate, that be∣cause <HI>Timothy</HI> was admonished, <HI>to lay Hands suddenly on no Man;</HI> he had the sole Power of <HI>Ordination;</HI> it's just as much to the purpose, as if he should argue, that he had the sole Power of <HI>exhorting and teaching,</HI> because the <HI>Apostle</HI> charges him, to <HI>be instant, in sea∣son, and out of season, in preaching the Word.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002525_0022_0FDB5F8BC552D2D0"/>A further Argument of this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Authority, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thus proposes. <Q>He was to guard di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gently against false Doctrines, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>educing Spirits, and to put the Brethren in mind, and command them, that they give not heed to such Doctrines and Seducers.</Q> And is not this the Duty of every Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pel <HI>Minister,</HI> without this superior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Authority?</P>

And therefore, there was no need of his continuance with them, under the Character of a <HI>Bishop;</HI> nor did he tarry long with them, as Dr. <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>by</HI> not only acknowledges, but proves from <HI>Scripture.</HI> <Q>As for <HI>Titus,</HI> (Says he) he was only left a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Crete,</HI> to <HI>ordain Elders in every City,</HI> and <HI>to set in order the things that were wenting;</HI> and having done that Work, he had done all that was assign'd him in that Station; and therefore, St. <HI>Paul</HI> sends for him the very next Year, to <HI>Nicopolis,</HI> Tit. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll. 12.</Q> Thus he, to which nothing need be added, since whatever occurs on this Head, has been parti∣cularly answer'd already.</P>
<P>THUS having quit out Hands, of the <HI>Episcopacy</HI> of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> his <HI>Hierarchy</HI> has but one Refuge more to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to, and that is the <HI>Apocaliptick Angels,</HI> who I suspect will also fail him, and not prove his Guar∣dians in this conflict.</P>
<P><Q>What has been hitherto observ'd, makes it to me very evident, (says he) and I think, may make it to any other unprejudiced Person, at least highly pro∣bable, that the <HI>Angels</HI> of the Seven Churches of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were Persons of the <HI>Apostolical</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Order. For since there was such an Order of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> instituted by Christ in his Church—who else could these <HI>Angels</HI> be, but Officers of this higher Order?</Q> In answer to which, I'll endeavour to imitate his Brevity, and waving all other Arguments, to disprove this fond conceit; will only offer plain <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that these <HI>Angels</HI> are (as the Word <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> frequently is) taken in a collective Sense, as including not only the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> but even the whole <HI>Churches</HI> themselves. Thus
<PB N="37" REF="002525_0023_0FDB5F8D16E97E68"/>
the <HI>Epistles</HI> are directed, <HI>unto the Seven</HI> CHURCHES <HI>in Asia,</HI> Rev. I. 4, 11. and always concluded with this <HI>Epiphonema, He that bath a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ear to bear, let him bear, what the Spirit saith unto the</HI> CHURCHES. And thus in the <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Church of <HI>Ephe∣sus,</HI> is there such a commendation for <HI>Labour and Pa∣tience,</HI> such a Complaint <HI>of the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of their first Love,</HI> such an Exhortation to <HI>Repentance,</HI> and threatning to <HI>remove their Candlestick out of its place,</HI> as are altogether incompatible to a single Person. And what clears this Case, beyond all possibility of Reply, is the <HI>Plural</HI> Expressions, so frequently applied to these <HI>Angels.</HI> For Instance; When the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Church of <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rna,</HI> is exhorted <HI>to fear none of there things,</HI> &amp;c. it is subjoined; <HI>The Devil shall cast some of</HI> YOU, <HI>into Pri∣son, that</HI> YE <HI>may be tried, and</HI> YE <HI>Shall have Tribula∣tion,</HI> &amp;c. Chap. II. Verse 10. Was it some of the <HI>Bishop,</HI> that was to be <HI>cast into Prison,</HI> and a number of him, to be <HI>tried,</HI> and to <HI>have Tribulation?</HI> So like∣wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e verse 13. <HI>Antip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> faithful Martyr, was stain among</HI> YOU, <HI>where Satan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>welleth.</HI> Was he slain among the <HI>Bishop,</HI> and had the <HI>Bishop</HI> only, such bad Quar∣ters, where <HI>Satans seat was?</HI> And to the same purpose, Verse 24. <HI>But unto</HI> YOU <HI>I say, and to the rest in Thy∣atira.</HI> With several other like Passages, which can by no means agree to a single Person. And how then did it become so very evident to this Author, that <HI>these Angels were of the Episcopal Order?</HI> I confess, I can't envy him the Satisfaction he obtains from such Evidence, but will leave him to the fruition of it, while I take a short View of the <HI>History,</HI> with which he concludes his Arguments, and see, whether he has been more happy in this, than in that, with which he began his <HI>Dissertation.</HI></P>
<P><Q>ALL the <HI>Records</HI> (saith he) we have of the anci∣ent and primitive Church, do harmoniously attest,
<PB N="38" REF="002525_0024_0FDB5F8F0115B9A8"/>
that this <HI>Order,</HI> and these <HI>Offices</HI> instituted by Christ, were inviolably preserv'd for many Ages, and so po∣sitive are they, as to that prime Office of <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Bishops,</HI> that they give us particular <HI>Catalogues</HI> of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> who succeeded the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in go∣verning the most famous and principal Churches in the World.</Q> It would have been a needles Toil, for this Author to have given his Reader any <HI>Docu∣ments</HI> of this, or to have produc'd one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se an∣cient <HI>Records,</HI> or so much as one of the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the Church, to prove this bold Assertion; for he knows that the <HI>Laity</HI> are easily put off with Confidence and Assurance. And it is also needless for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to heap up contrary Authorities, against <HI>bold</HI> and <HI>blind</HI> Affir∣mation. I shall therefore only propose to his Con∣sideration, the Answer of their own Dr. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iren. part, 2 cap. 6.</NOTE>, to these frivolous Pretences. Who observing, that <HI>Eusebius</HI> makes it a most hard Matter to know, who succeeded the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in the Churches they plan∣ted; adds, <Q>Say you so, is it so hard a Matter to find out, who succeeded the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in the Churches planted by them, unless it be mentioned in the wri∣tings of <HI>Paul,</HI> what becomes then, of our unquesti∣onable Line of Succession, of the <HI>Bishops</HI> of several Churches, and the large <HI>Diagrams</HI> made of the <HI>Apos∣tolick</HI> Churches, with every one's Name set down in his Order, as if the writer had been <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>renceaul</HI> to the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves? Is it come to this at last, that we have nothing certain, but what we have is Scripture? And must then the Tradition of the Church be our Rule, to interpret <HI>Scripture</HI> by? An excellent way to find out the Truth doubtless, to bend the Rule to the crooked Stick.</Q> And the same Author justly observes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 300.</NOTE> <Q>That from such Rea∣sonings
<PB N="39" REF="002525_0024_0FDB5F8F0115B9A8"/>
of the Fathers, and their mentioning of Successions of <HI>Bishops,</HI> it can never be prov'd, that <HI>Bishops</HI> were of a higher Order, or had any Power over <HI>Presbyters;</HI> nor that in all places, there was so much as any Difference at all between them; nor that they mean'd ought, save a <HI>succession of Doc∣trine.</HI></Q> Thus Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> unto which nothing need be added.</P>
<P>I will therefore proceed to consider <HI>Calvin's</HI> Au∣thority, whom he brings for his Voucher in this Case, and would no doubt by this, and several other Quotations from him, have his <HI>Lay Reader</HI> suppose he is wholly on his side. He indeed finds him ac∣knowledging, that the Ancients had <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Arch∣Bishops;</HI> and he might have added, <HI>Lectors</HI> and <HI>Acolyths,</HI> for <HI>Calvin</HI> mentions these too among the rest, in the place refer'd to. But why did he not tell us, that ac∣cording to <HI>Calvin,</HI> <Q>The <HI>Bishop</HI> had no Dominion over his Colleagues, the <HI>Presbyters;</HI> but was among them as the <HI>Consul</HI> in the <HI>Senate,</HI> to propose Matters, to enquire the Votes, to preside in Counsels, Admo∣nitions, and Exhortations; to direct the Affair by his Authority, and to put in Execution, what was decreed by common Council. And that even this is introduced by <HI>Humane Consent,</HI> is confessed by the An∣cients themselves.</Q> I say, why did he not inform us of this also? The Reason is obvious, it would quite have spoiled his Argument, and who would be an Evidence against himself?</P>
<P>THUS, I've gone through all his Arguments, for the Proof of the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of <HI>Prelacy;</HI> and must submit it to the Readers Judgment, whether any of 'em remain unanswer'd.</P>
<P>HIS next Business is, to propose three <HI>Objections,</HI> against the Doctrine he propugns; and he discovers his Prudence and Caution, in proposing 'em as fa∣vourably
<PB N="40" REF="002525_0025_0FDB5F902D1B9798"/>
as possible to his own Cause, that he might find something to answer. But it would have been kindly done of him, to have allow'd the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> to state their own <HI>Objections:</HI> And I dare say, if he had undertaken to have given any satisfying Answer to the <HI>Reasons</HI> brought by them, against his Doctrine; he would have found Work enough for his Life time. I'll take liberty to propose some few to them, which he may consider at his Leisure.</P>
