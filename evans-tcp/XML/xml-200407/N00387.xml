<P>IN true Love and Good will I have writ the following Treatise unto you, hoping it may find entertainment with some among you, to give it the Reading, and seriously to consider what ye read; and my earnest Exhortation and Advice is unto you, that in all your reading, whether in this or any other Book, ye turn your minds to that Light of Christ within you, wherewith he hath enlightned you, and all men, as the holy Scriptures declare; and that ye may believe in Christ, the Light, and Life, in you, who is the Wisdom and Power of God, and who was in all the holy Prophets and Apo∣stles,
<PB REF="000472_0004_0FA67382586A0FA0"/>
and whose Spirit that was in them that gave forth the holy Scriptures, both of the Old and New Testament; and the same Spirit only doth, and only can give to all Readers of the holy Scripture, a true and right understan∣ding of them, and of all other Books, that treat of Doctrines and Matter of Religion, whether they have proceeded from a measure of the same holy Spirit: And if ye believe in Christ the Light, the Life, the Wisdom, and Power of God in you, and joyn your Minds to his inward divine Illumination, He will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>noint the Eyes of your <HI>Understanding,</HI> with his <HI>Spiritual Eye-Salve,</HI> and then your Eyes shall be opened to see and understand <HI>what ye read;</HI> and through your faith in him he will also open and circumcise your inward Ears, and cause you still more and more to be ac∣quainted with his living Voice and Words in you, all which are Spirit and Life; and this will give you a spiritual savour and taste, whereby ye shall be able to try and judge of things that differ, whether Men, or Books, whether Spirits, or Doctrines, what are of God, and what are not of him; for although the Scriptures are the best outward Test or
<PB REF="000472_0005_0FA6738679779410"/>
Touchstone, or Rule whereby to try all Do∣ctrines of Men, or Books, yet it is the holy Spirit of Christ, and his Light inwardly shin∣ing and enlightning the dark Hearts and Vn∣derstandings of Men, that gives them ability rightly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> understand the Scriptures, other∣wise the Scriptures are as a sealed Book, both to the learned and unlearned; For though the <HI>Jews</HI> had the Scriptures of the old Te∣stament, which prophecied of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of <HI>the Time and Manner of his Coming,</HI> and how <HI>he was to suffer Death for the sins of men, and to rise again and ascend into Glory,</HI> yet none of them had that <HI>Understanding,</HI> but such only as were turn∣ed <HI>to his divine Illumination in their Hearts,</HI> and were acquainted with his <HI>holy Spirit, Light and Life in them.</HI> And the like grave and wholsom Advice I recommend unto you, which a certaìn Antient <HI>Christian</HI> gave unto <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> before his Con∣version to the Christian Faith, to wit, <HI>That he should diligently read and search the holy Scriptures, which should give him more Content than all</HI> Heathen <HI>Authors; but withal, that he should mind the

Gate, the LIGHT, by which only he could enter into the true Understanding and Knowledge of them.</HI> The which Pas∣sage the said <HI>Justin</HI> relateth in his Works, and <HI>John Fox</HI> hath it also in his <HI>Martyro∣logie</HI> taken out of him. And though in this Treatise I have affirmed and sufficiently de∣monstrated, that your <HI>Visible Churches</HI> are no <HI>true Churches of Christ</HI> yet I do not say nor conclude, that none of you belong to Christs true Church in any true regard; But on the contrary, I have that true Charity, Faith and Hope concerning a Remnant among you, who have in the least measure true H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngerings and Thirstings after Righteous∣ness, and a great inward longing and panting of Heart and Soul after the Lord Iesus Christ, to know him and enjoy him, more nearly than by all Hear-say or report of him, and whose Souls are sick of love for him, and feel your need and want of him, as the sick that need th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Physitian,</HI> that ye do in∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, even all such of you, bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng to Christ, and are the real Members of his Body, which is his Church: for where any living Desire is after Christ, and where any true

<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. Although they contain a full and sufficient Declaration of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <HI>Christian Doctrine,</HI> yet they do not contain the whole Mind, Will and Counsel

of God, as some say they do. Because there are many things, wherein God doth reveal of his Counsel to his Children, which are not in Scrip∣ture either expresly, or consequentially, alto∣gether necessary to their Peace and Comfort; as to instance in some particulars:</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> It is a part of the counsel of God, for a <HI>Christian</HI> to know his <HI>inward Calling,</HI> and whe∣ther he be indeed one of God's <HI>called</HI> and <HI>chosen Ones</HI>? whether <HI>in favour with God,</HI> and <HI>justified</HI> and <HI>sanctified</HI>? And though the Scripture doth give infallible Signs and Marks of such an e∣state, yet no Scripture, nor Scripture-conse∣quence can infallibly assure any man that he hath these marks; but it is the <HI>spirit of God</HI> that only can and doth give them this assurance, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. 2<HI>dly,</HI> All tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Preachers and Ministers of Christ ought to know the mind and will of God, <HI>whether they be called of God to the Work of the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nistry,</HI> which Call is an <HI>inward Call,</HI> that is alto∣gether necessary, to their faithful discharge of so great a Work; but this they cannot know simply by the Scripture. 3<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly,</HI> Every true <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> should know his inward Call, to <HI>Pray,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, or perform any Religious Duty or Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice unto God, as <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said'st, Seek <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Face, my Heart answe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed thy Fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> O Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>: I will seek; hide not t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Face f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Psal</HI> 27.8.

And as <HI>Rebecca,</HI> when the Twins struggled in her Womb, enquired at the Lord, and said, <HI>Why am I thus?</HI> And the Lord answered her. Also in the case of Marriage, every true <HI>Christian</HI> man and woman ought to enquire and wait for God's counsel, with whom to be joyned in Marriage, that they may know indeed the Lord's joyning of them, and that they marry in the Lord; but this can∣not be known by any Scripture, or consequence from Scripture, but the Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of the Lord must reveal it, even the same that led <HI>Abra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am's</HI> Ser∣vant to take a Wife to his Son <HI>Isaac.</HI> And every <HI>Christian</HI> should know the will and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounsel of God in his outward Vocation, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is of God, and so abide therein, as the Scripture saith, <HI>Let every man abide in the Calling wherein he is called of God.</HI> And as the Servants of God in dayes past, in travelling and sojourning f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om place to place, received the counsel of God, so do these now that wait for it in uprightness of Heart, as really as holy men did of old; and as <HI>Phillip</HI> received the Word of God, which he cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not find in the Scripture, either expresly or consequentially, when the Spirit said unto him, <HI>Ioyn thy self to this Charriot,</HI> when he was sent to preach Christ to the Enuch; and as <HI>Peter</HI> was sent to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anias</HI> to <HI>Saul</HI>; and many other the like

For whereas too many make the outward passages of Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idence their rule, as to say, <HI>If Sickness, or some outward Impediment hinder not</HI>; they constitute that to be the Will of God: and whereas many remove from one place to another, and divine Provi∣dence doth not hinder them, and yet in that re∣moval they have not had God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s approbation, and it hath not had a bless<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng to follow it, but on the contrary; for leaving their place, they have been exposed to sad Temptations, and have fallen under them. And <HI>lastly,</HI> there are many precious living Solloquies and Intercourses be∣twixt the Lord and the Souls of his dear Chil∣dren, while he answers the returns of their Prayers in living Testimonies, and words of his holy Spirit; which though they are agreeable to Scripture, yet are not express Scripture words, but are the real Words and Dictates of the holy Ghost, speaking Peace and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>solation to them, beyond all utterance or demonstration of Speech, and wonderfully quickning and strengthning them in the inward man, as we find in the <HI>Psalms,</HI> and in the <HI>Song of Solomon,</HI> and other places of

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Concerning new divine Revelations &amp; Inspirations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THe places of Scripture, which they com∣monly bring against all <HI>new divine Revela∣tions</HI> and <HI>Inspirations of the Spirit of God,</HI> prove no such thing, as will easily appear to any that are impartial and unbyassed in their understanding, if they will but read and consider them, which places are these following, as they are alledged and quoted by them called the <HI>Assembly of Divines at Westminster,</HI> in their <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession of Faith,</HI> cap. 1. sect. 1. <HI>Prov.</HI> 22.19, 20, 21. <HI>Isa.</HI> 8.9, 10. which places, if they prove now, that all new Revela∣tion is ceased, they do as much prove, that it ceased in the days of Christ and the Apostles, yea, in the days of the Prophets that did succeed them. Is it not admirable blindness that these men did not see how impertinent these Citations are? And as for all the places of the new Testa∣ments cited by them, as <HI>Luke</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.3, 4. <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.4. <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.4, 7, 10. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.1, 2. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.19. they do no more prove what these
<PB N="10" REF="000472_0020_0FA6739907DEC540"/>
intend than the former; for by their own con∣fession, <HI>divine Revelation</HI> and <HI>Inspiration</HI> continued after all these places of Scripture were writ, for divers inti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Books of Scripture were writ after them here alledged: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd if they say, that all <HI>new Revelation</HI> did cease, how soon, all these Books of Scripture were in being, then they must also affirm, that all new Revelation did cease to divers of the Apostles, long before they deceas∣ed, because divers of them, and particularly <HI>Iohn</HI> survived after he wrote his book of the <HI>Revelation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is most readily granted, that God in his infinite Wisdom and goodness was pleased, that there should be Oracles and Testimonies of his Truth and Gospel committed to writing, accor∣ding to which the Doctrines and words of men, however so holy, that should come in after ages, should be tryed and examined; <HI>for the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets</HI>; but this doth not prove in any wise, all cealing of Pro∣phecy, or divine Revelation, or Inspiration by the same Spirit. The Apostles Doctrine and Preaching was tryed by the Noble <HI>Bereans,</HI> whe∣ther it was according to the Scriptures of the old Testament; but it doth not there follow, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did not preach by divine Revel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion and Inspiration. And both Christ and the Apostles proved their Doctrine gene∣rally out of the Scriptures of the Prophets; but that doth not argue that they did not Preach by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> divine Revelation.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="000472_0021_0FA673A0768CA538"/>3. But for the further clearing of the matter, we are to distinguish betwixt <HI>new Revelation</HI> of <HI>new Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>new Revelation</HI> of <HI>ancient Do∣ctrine.</HI> The Apostles had a new Revelation, yet not of any new Doctrine, but the very same that Christ and the Prophets preached before them, and all agreed in the same Doctrine for Substance, and yet had their own peculiar Vi∣sions and Revelations, which were new to them, to wit, new, though not in kind or specie, yet in particular or individual unto them. And so it is, as to us, we plead not for any new Reve∣lation of any new Doctrine, Faith or Gospel, differing from what Christ, and the Prophets, and Apostles have taught before us, and is large∣ly and fully declared in the holy Scriptures; but for a new Revelation of the same Doctrine, Faith and Gospel which was revealed unto them: For as the Faith of the Prophets and Apostles is not enough to us, but we must also <HI>have the like precious Faith with them,</HI> 1 John 1.12. and we must see with our <HI>spiritual Eyes,</HI> and hear with our <HI>spiritual Ears,</HI> and handle with our <HI>spi∣ritual handling</HI> the <HI>Word of Life,</HI> as they did, so it must be newly revealed to us, and in us.</P>
<P N="4">4. And if all new divine <HI>Revelation</HI> and <HI>Inspi∣ration</HI> be ceased, then all spiritual seeing and hear∣ing is ceased, and neither God nor Christ is, or hath been heard or seen spiritually, as the Saints did see and hear formerly, nay, not in the least degree, and all inward spiritual Sensation and
<PB N="12" REF="000472_0022_0FA673A138CF6560"/>
feeling is gone, and all use or exercise of spiri∣tual Senses, which is sad tydings to poor Souls. But if any g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant that there is any true and real spiritual <HI>hearing, seeing, tasting,</HI> and other spi∣ritual Sensations of God, and divine things, they must also grant true divine <HI>Revelation</HI> the same in kind and nature with what the Saints had of old; for what is the proper object of the in∣ward hearing, and seeing, and tasting, and feel∣ing? is it not God and Christ? as <HI>David</HI> invited others, saying, <HI>O taste and see that God is good.</HI> And as the Spouse said in the Song, <HI>I sate down under his Shadow with great delight, and his F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit was sweet unto my taste; his Left-hand is under my Head, and his Right-hand doth embrace me; he hath brought me to his banqueting Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se,</HI> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd again, <HI>The King hath brought me into his Wine-Cellar.</HI> And can these sweet and heavenly Ex∣periences be witnessed without <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> or <HI>Inspiration</HI>?</P>
<P>And whereas some say, <HI>It is Revelation by the Word and Spirit going along together, but not by the Spirit alone without the Word.</HI></P>
<P>I Answer, granting it to be so in a true sense; for the Prophets and Apostles had both the Word and the Spirit going along together in their <HI>divine Revelations,</HI> according to <HI>Isa.</HI> 50.21. and that did not hinder them to be real and pro∣per in their kind. Put that God hath limited and confin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself so, as never to give any inward enjoyment of himself to the Souls of his
<PB N="13" REF="000472_0023_0FA673A1DBDB35D8"/>
dear Children, by any inward sense, sight or hearing, but what is conveyed unto them always by means of Scripture words, is a most extrava∣gant presumption to affirm, without all Scrip∣ture proof; for beside that, the Soul may hear God speaking other words to it inwardly, than express Scripture words, though not contrary or disagreeing; it oft falls out, that the inward and spiritual seeing, tasting and feeling may be enjoyed and witnessed, without all words com∣posed of Letters or Syllables, even <HI>in a deep in∣ward stillness and quietness,</HI> according to these words, <HI>Be still, and know that I am God.</HI> And as the outward seeing, tasting, smelling and feeling may be used without the present use of the outward hearing, so may the inward and spiritual se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, tasting, smelling and feeling be used at times and seasons, without the inward and spiritual hearing of any Words formally composed of Letters and Syllables, or Scripture words, or so much as inwardly thought o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> con∣ceived, which men of spiritual Experience, who have their spiritual Senses cannot but readily grant. We find by common experience, that Words fall short to give us a sufficient and satis∣factory knowledge of outward and natural things; and therefore we de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire rather to see, taste and handle them, than to hear the best or most true report of them. We love rather to see a pleasant Country, then to hear of it only; and every good Child loveth to see his Parents,

<PB N="15" REF="000472_0025_0FA673A50BAA6788"/>
cannot be without an inward and intimate, or immediate Revelation of him? And if words fall short to give to men a sufficient and sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>factory knowledge of natural and outward things, how much more then to give a sufficient &amp; satisfacto∣ry knowledge of God and Christ, and divine things, as his Love, his Life, his Peace, and that inward Comfort and Consolation th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is in his presence? For the Scripture saith, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.9, 10. <HI>Ear hath not heard, nor Eye hath not seen, nor hath the Heart of man conceived these good things that God hath prepared for them that love him, and wait for him</HI>: Where we see all words fall short to discover these things; <HI>But God hath revealed them to us</HI> (said <HI>Paul) by his Spirit.</HI> And thus God did promise as a general priviledge to all his People, of all Nations, even to bring them to his holy Mountain, and to destroy the face of the Covering spread over them, and make unto them <HI>a Feast o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at things, full of Marrow, and of Wines upon the Lees well refined</HI>: And what is this but the enjoyment of himself, seen and tasted by them? And do not all true Believers <HI>eat the same spiritual Bread,</HI> and <HI>drink the same spiritual Drink the Rock that followed</HI> Israel <HI>of old</HI>? which Rock was Christ? And surely this is beyond all Words or Declaration, and according to this the joy of God's people is called <HI>a Ioy unspeakable,</HI> even such as words cannot express; and the <HI>Peace of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od</HI> is said <HI>to pass Vnderstanding,</HI> and the <HI>love of Christ, that it passeth Knowl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge,</HI> because no Words, either spoken or conceived by men, can

give the knowledge of these so great and divine and profound Mysteries, but only the spirit of God, that searcheth the deep thing, of God, can discover them. Again, we find by common ex∣perience, that all outward teaching of men, pre-suppose certain Principles of know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edge of na∣tural things, which they profess to te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, which Principles are partly known (wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout men's teaching) by the outward sense of them, and partly by inward Notions of Knowledge, innate in the minds of men; and therefore it were alto∣gether in vain, for a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chitecture</HI> or <HI>Navigation,</HI> to teach a man these Arts, who is altogether blind, and sense<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, and stupid, and hath not any inward clearness of his natural judgment; And even so it is, as to spiritual and divine things, all outward teaching of them doth pre-suppose some Principles of Knowledge of these very things, and some inward divine and spiritual sense of them, or at least some in∣ward ground and capacity, whereby that divine sence may be excited in them.

places, to prove the <HI>necessity of divine Revelation</HI> then these are, the one plainly implying it, the other plainly expressing it.

And whereas they bring <HI>Paul</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s words, saying, <HI>God hath revealed them to us,</HI> to wit, <HI>these deep things of God,</HI> to prove the inward Il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umination of the Spirit of God to all Saints, as well as to <HI>Paul</HI>; the same proveth <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> as it is ex∣presly so called by <HI>Paul</HI> in this very place; for they must needs grant, that the <HI>divine Illumina∣tion</HI> which <HI>Paul</HI> had, was <HI>Revelation,</HI> properly so called, and what he had he holdeth it forth, as common in kind to all Saints and Believers.

should have such a grudge and prejudice at all <HI>new Revelation,</HI> a Word so frequently used in Scripture, and yet pretend so great kindness to <HI>new inward Illumination,</HI> which is the same; for it passeth their skill, or any mans else, to divide or seperate the one from the other.</P>
<P N="6">6. But the great knack, nicety or mystery of this distinction lieth in this, that <HI>inward Illumi∣nation</HI> is only <HI>Revelation,</HI> subjective or effective; and in that sence, some of that sort of men, say, <HI>They own the necessity of inward Revelation, and hold it to be all one with Illumination.</HI> But they deny all inward objective Illumination, or Re∣velation, that is to say, any inward Revelation of any inward object, inwardly proposed to the Eye or Ear, or other inward spiritual Sence and Faculty of the Soul, the alone object of the Souls whole <HI>knowledge, faith, fruition, enjoyment of God</HI> and <HI>communion with him,</HI> being the Scriptures, or God, Christ and divine things not in themselves seen, or enjoyed, but as they are to be seen and known, or revealed in the words of Scripture: Hence they who use this distinction, say, the <HI>in∣ward Lig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>spirit,</HI> being only <HI>effective,</HI> or <HI>subjective,</HI> but not <HI>objective,</HI> is <HI>medium incognitum ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd,</HI> or <HI>principium incog∣nit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> that is to say, an unknown Principle, or mean of knowing and assenting, which may be illustrated by this similitude, that there is an inward vigor of Life, and natural Spirits, that are necessary to enable the outward Eye to see outward things and Objects; but that
<PB N="21" REF="000472_0031_0FA673AD0386C560"/>
inward vigor of natural Life and Spirits, is not the object of the Eye, nor seen by it; or other∣wise some may, or do understand by <HI>subjective inward Revelation,</HI> or Revelation on the part of the subject, the Soul's inward knowledge, or perception, as in the outward sight of things of this World, there is the vision of the Eye, or its sight and perception, and the Object seen, and perceived by the Eye: Also, in <HI>hearing,</HI> there is the hearing, or perception of the Ear, and the thing heard, be it Voice, or sound of Man, Beast or Bird, or musical Instrument. And thus, ac∣cording unto these mens Doctrine, the alone adequate formal Object of all <HI>faith, knowledge, fruition, enjoyment, sight</HI> and <HI>sense</HI> of the Souls of the most excellent Saints, either now living, or that have lived in all Ages past since the Apostles lived, is the Scripture-words. But this is all meerly begged, and taken for granted, without all proof, and altogether contradictory to the experience of all the true Saints of God, who have an inward sight, knowledge and enjoyment of God, far surpassing all Words or Writings; And thus, according to these mens Doctrine, all the knowledge or sight that the Saints have of God in this Life, is but as one that seeth <HI>Eng∣land</HI> in a Map, but never saw the Land it self; or as an hungry man, heareth and readeth good words of Meat, but neither seeth, nor tasteth it; and as a Woman heareth of a Husband she is mar∣ried unto, or seeth his Picture on a Table, or on

Paper, or readeth a Book that describeth his Beauty and Personage, but is never admitted to see him, or hear himself, nor to touch, handle or embrace him; all which are sad tydings to Souls that love God and Christ; but the best is, they are utterly false, and the experience of the Saints abundantly prove them to be false; and such dark ignorant blind Doctrine, proveth suf∣ficiently what dark ignorant blind men these have been, or are, who have so published their own shame and folly to the face of the World, and as blind and ignorant are these Teachers, who have since received and published the same blind Doctrine. But if the inward Light, or Illumination be altogether an unknown Principle to him that hath it, having no Evidence, or Light, or Demonstration of its own, whereby to discover it, how shall any man be sure, or know surely that he hath any inward divine Light or Illumination; for no Scripture can tell him that he hath it, or that he hath the Works of one that is divinely illuminated. One would think the bear naming, or mentioning such Doctrine, is enough to refute it, as to say, God and Christ is, and can only be known by words, or report and hear-say, whereas the Scripture saith, <HI>Ear hath not heard, nor Eye seen, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at these things are, which God hath prepared for his Children</HI>: And yet all Scripture words the Ear doth hear and the Eye doth see.</P>
<P N="7">7. But to come to the Conclusion of the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ter,
<PB N="23" REF="000472_0033_0FA673B0A273E2A0"/>
it is to be noticed, or considered, that there is a Doctrinal and sensible knowledge of God, or <HI>discursive</HI> and <HI>intuitive</HI>; as for the <HI>do∣ctrinal</HI> and <HI>discursive</HI> knowledge of God, it is granted, that it cannot be without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, either of Scripture, or some other words given by the same Spirit; and also it is granted, that Scrip∣ture words, in God's ordinary way, are neces∣sary to give to men the said <HI>doctrinal knowledge</HI> of God and Christ, and many deep and mysterious things of the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith and Religion; but this doth not prove the ceasing of <HI>new divine Re∣velation,</HI> but rather indeed establisheth it; for the Prophets and Apostles, who had <HI>divine Reve∣lation,</HI> were profited, taught and edified by their fellow-Prophets and Apostles; and especi∣ally the latter Prophets, were much helped by the Words and Writings of the fore-going Prophets, as <HI>Daniel</HI> confessed, he understood by Books, to wit, by <HI>Ieremiah</HI> his prophecy, the number of the Years of the Captivity, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.2. And Christ opened the understanding of the A∣postles, to understand the Scriptures of the Old Testament, what they did declare of him; and <HI>Paul</HI> freely confesseth, that the Scriptures of the Prophets were writ for his Learning, as well as of other men, and yet he had great plenty of <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> beyond what many of them had; and <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>he had more knowledge then his Teachers,</HI> and yet no doubt profited by them, and especially by the Prophet <HI>Samuel,</HI> and others
<PB N="24" REF="000472_0034_0FA673B0F3E318A8"/>
that lived with him, and before him. Next, as to the <HI>sensible</HI> and <HI>intuitive knowledge of God,</HI> it can be, and oft is without all Words, either out∣wardly heard, or inwardly conceived, I mean words co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sisting of Letters or Syllables, such as are not the things, but signs of things, even as we have a sensible and intuitive knowledge of a Land, by seeing it, and eating the Fruit of it, and drinking the good Wine or Milk of it, tho' we are not hearing or reading of it, nor think∣ing of any words that ever we read or heard of it. And so, often the Souls of God's people enjoy a sweet sight, taste, and repast of him in a deep inward quiet and stillness of mind, having no words of any sort, that can be expressed in Letters or Syllables, so much as in their present thoughts or remembrance; and this is the most excellent degree of Knowledge, and as far excel∣leth and transcendeth the other sort, as the sight, taste and feeling of a thing doth the report or hear-say of it. It is also acknowledged, that oft it pleaseth God, to joyn of his Life to Scrip∣ture words, as <HI>Promises, Prophecies,</HI> or any others, as we hear, read, or meditate on them, and make them as Conduits, Pipes or Cisterns, or as Cups and Flaggons, to convey the divine Influences of his Life, and living Spirit of Life, and love to our Souls, but then they hinder not our <HI>Revelation,</HI> to be a real, and true, and pro∣per <HI>Revelation,</HI> as well <HI>objective,</HI> as <HI>subjective</HI>; for as in drinking of outward Wine in a Glass,
<PB N="25" REF="000472_0035_0FA673B1D4860B28"/>
or Cup, we not only see the Glass or Cup, that revealeth the Wine, but also the Wine it self, and the Wine is the most desireable, and pleasant, and acceptable object of both our sight, and taste, and feeling, so that we regard the Glass or Cup little or nothing for it self, but for its use and service to us; and if there be no Wine, or other refreshing Liquor in the Cup, we care not to use it, it hath no taste unto us, nor service, but as the Wine is in it: And thus it is with the living Soul, that thirsts after the living God, and to drink of his Spirit, that quickens and refresh∣eth the Soul, when it seeth or perceiveth any divine Virtue or Life (as God is pleased, when, how, or by whom to joyn of the same to it) in Scripture words, either preached, read, or me∣ditated, it is very glad, and most gladly maketh use of them, and giveth God thanks for his great mercy; but without Life be joyned unto them, it is no more wisdom, nor discretion to use them, then for a man to put an empty Flaggon or Cup to his Mouth to drink at it.</P>

They preach altogether an absent Christ, as some of them say, <HI>Christ is not really and pro∣perly in his People, or if present, a Christ altogether either dumb or silent, that being so near to the Soul, as to be in it, never speaketh one word in it, and al∣ways hideth his Face, and never giveth to the Soul one glance or shine of his Countenance.</HI> But if they be ashamed of this Doctrine, which yet is the very purport of it, who deny all <HI>inward new Re∣velation,</HI> and <HI>new Visitations</HI> of the Lord's love unto the Souls of his People, then let them be ashamed to preach, teach, or write, that there is no <HI>new Revelation</HI> of God and Christ, nor no <HI>immediate</HI> or <HI>inward teaching,</HI> no <HI>inward</HI> and <HI>im∣mediate calling,</HI> or <HI>sending</HI> to the Ministry; and let them be ashamed to own themselves to be the Successors of the ancient <HI>Protestants,</HI> who did acknowledge <HI>immediate Teaching,</HI> and <HI>calling un∣to the Ministry,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit of Prophecy</HI>; and some of them had it, as <HI>George Wishard,</HI> and

And therefore in respect of any outward Rule and Standard, the Scripture is sufficient, and to be preferred in all respects to any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter Writings, or Testimonies, or Records whatsoever; first, because writ from a greater measure and depth of divine Wisdom; for though the Spirit be one, yet it hath diversity of Gifts and Operations, and Administrations, and all men divinely inspired, had not the same clearness of divine Knowledge, <HI>Numb.</HI> 12.6, 7, 8. <HI>Moses</HI> exceeded the Prophets generally, <HI>David</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>Solomon</HI> exceeded many of them; and <HI>Isaiah</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>Ieremiah</HI> exceeded others of them; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mong the Prophets some were as Fathers, some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Sons; hence we read in Scripture, that <HI>God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Father of Lights,</HI> and of these Lights, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o us, some are higher, and some lower, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome mystick Writers, both among <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> have taken notice of, out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cripture it self; hence they say, <HI>Moses</HI> drank <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Fountain, <HI>Samuel, David, Solomon,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome others, drank at the Streams, and others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f an inferior degree, at the Pond or Cistern:

and they further say, <HI>Moses</HI> had his Revelations from <HI>Binah, Abraham</HI> from <HI>Gedulah,</HI> a step lower; <HI>Isaac</HI> from <HI>Geburah,</HI> yet lower; <HI>Iacob</HI> from <HI>Tipheret,</HI> yet lower, but pertaking of both, signified by his dwelling in Tents, betwixt the Tents of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac; David</HI> some∣times from <HI>Tipheret,</HI> and sometimes from <HI>Nezah</HI> and <HI>Hod</HI>; hence we read some of the Inscrip∣tions of his <HI>Psalms</HI> to <HI>Nezah,</HI> and sometimes from <HI>Malcuth</HI>; and they say that the ordinary Prophets had their Revelations from these two divine Measures, <HI>Nezah</HI> and <HI>Hod,</HI> called, <HI>Exod.</HI> 38.8. <HI>The Looking-Glasses of the Lords Hosts that Assemble at the door of the Tabernacle,</HI> (see the <HI>Heb.</HI> text) but <HI>Moses</HI> had liberty to go into the heavenly Tabernacle it self, and so had some others. And that God did make himself more known to <HI>Moses,</HI> than to <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob,</HI> is clear, from these words of his to <HI>Moses</HI> at the Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, <HI>I appeared to</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob <HI>by the Name of God Almighty, but by my Name Ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovah, was I not known to them, Exod.</HI> 6.3.

Prov.</HI> 24.3, 4. Therefore Wisdom is a degree above Understanding, and Understanding a degree above Knowledge, all which divine Measures are set in order, as the parts of a Tree, with Root, Branches and Tops, or as the Members of a mans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody, by way of Alle∣gory and Analogy, <HI>Cochmah, Binah</HI> and <HI>Daath</HI> belonging to the Head, <HI>Gedulah, Geburah</HI> to the right and left Hand and Arm, <HI>Tipheret</HI> to the Body, <HI>Nesah, Hod</HI> and <HI>Iesod</HI> to the Thighs and Legs, &amp;c. and <HI>Mulcuth</HI> lowest of all; all which make up, by way only of allegory and analogy the parts and Members of the <HI>Son of Man,</HI> or heavenly <HI>Adam,</HI> as both <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> saw him upon his Throne. The English Names of these Hebrew words, all which are found in Scripture, in their true order, are these following, <HI>Cochmah,</HI> i. e. Wisdom, <HI>Binah,</HI> i. e. Understanding or Prudence, <HI>Daath,</HI> i. e. Knowledge, (see 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.11.) <HI>Gedulah,</HI> i. e. Magnificence, <HI>Geburah,</HI> i.e. Power, <HI>Tipheret,</HI> i. e.

Foundation, and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lcuth,</HI> i. e. the Kingdom. And secondly and most especially, we give the Preheminence to the Scriptures be∣yond all latter Writers, because we are well assured that the Scriptures throughout are pure, without all mixture of Error or Mistake; and this is generally granted by all Christians, that the Scriptures are really so, being duly and rightly translated, but we are not assured that
<PB N="32" REF="000472_0042_0FA673B85E6455A0"/>
any mans or mens Writings since, are altogether pure and free of all mixture of Error and human Weakness, until they be duly examined and found to agree to the holy Scriptures, and to the inward testimony of the holy Spirit; for altho' whatever the Spirit of God inwardly revealeth, is infallible and pure from all mixture of Error, and whatever any man <HI>saith</HI> or <HI>writeth,</HI> as he hath receiv'd it from that, his Testimony is pure, and without mixture; but we are not assured that any man or men are in that state of Perfection, that they may not by humane frailty, in some measure or way, more or less, decline or depart from the <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>infallible Teachings of the Spirit of God</HI>; for as it is possible they may purely and chastely keep unto them, so for want of due watchfulness and holy care, they may more or less depart from them, and so there may be a mixture of Truth and Error, both in their Understandings and Words; and therefore they are not to be taken on trust, but both their Doctrine in all things is to be tryed by the Scripture, and their Spirit by the Spirit of Truth, as every one is able, accor∣ding to what he hath received. All which doth not hinder but that the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> in our day both teacheth and leadeth infallibly, although the Disciples and profe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed Followers of it at times, by weakness, may be liable to Mistakes.</P>
<P N="3">3. And as concerning that phrase or expression that some use, <HI>That the Spirit of God speaking in the Scriptures, is the supream Iudge of all Contro¦versies
<PB N="33" REF="000472_0043_0FA673B929F68208"/>
of Religion,</HI> although it is no Scripture phrase, nor proper, but figurative, as when a man is said to speak in his books or Writings; yet in a figurative sense it might be allowed, if they did not confine all the speaking of the spirit of God to his only and alone speaking in the Scriptures, so as that the Spirit speaketh not at all, as they would have it, in the Souls and hearts of men, as he used to do in the Prophets and A∣postles. And because they have a wrong sense of it, and that it is not proper, but figurative, it is better not to use it. And in the room of it, I say, the Spirit of God speaking in some measure in the Heart of every true Believer and Spirtual man, opening &amp; expounding the Scripture unto him, in the due and diligent use of reading, hearin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and meditation of Scripture words, or any other means of God's appointing for our Institution, and especially in the frequent use of fervent and earnest Prayer, Praying earnestly with <HI>David,</HI> who was richly indued with <HI>divine Revelation, Op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n my Eyes, that I may see the wonderful things of thy Law</HI>; And most especially in our being found in the way of Righteousness, and faithful Obedience, to what is already revealed unto us; for as we are found here, we have good warrant to expect that where any doubt, or Controversie in Doctrine, or in the meaning of a place of Scripture doth arise, that God's holy Spirit, whom Christ hath promised to his Disciples, to <HI>teach them all things, and to lead them into all
<PB N="34" REF="000472_0044_0FA673B9DDEDFCC0"/>
Truth,</HI> will indeed judge and decide the matter in question, in their Hearts, by his secret Love and Teaching or Revelation. And let it be no∣ted, that I say, it is not the Spirit abstractly considered from the Scriptures, or our due use of them, or the duty that God requireth of us, but it is the holy Spirit opening, or expounding the Scriptures unto us, in <HI>reading, hearing, me∣ditation, prayer, waiting,</HI> and <HI>obedience</HI> to what we already know, that is the Judge of all Con∣troversie in matter of Doctrine.</P>
<P N="4">4. Next, as to the <HI>Rule,</HI> as the Scripture is the best and only external or outward Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and Standard, it is worthily preferred to all ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er outward Records and Testimonies; yet because we both believe the Scriptures not simply for their own Testimony, but for the inward Wit∣ness and Testimony of the Spirit, and also be∣cause we can only understand the Scriptures but by the said inward Witness and Testimony of the holy spirit; therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the inw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd Witness of the spirit, or the spirit inwardly witnessing both to the truth, and true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of Scripture, is the greatest and primary Rule, as <HI>Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> plainly testi∣fied, saying, <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we receive the Testimony of men, the Testimony or Witness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God is greater; and he that believes ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the Witness in himself, and hath set to his Seal that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od is true.</HI> And therefore <HI>Paul</HI> recomme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded his Doct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine to the <HI>Witness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Spirit</HI> in the Hearts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsciences of the Hearers, and told the <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssadonians,</HI> 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1.5.

<P N="1">1. BEcause of the near and close connexion and dependance, that the things mention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the Title of this Chapter, have with the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of what is delivered in the preceeding Chap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, therefore I do see it meet to treat of them in this place. The common Doctrine and Opinion of these, who deny all new Revelation of the holy Spirit, is, that natural and acquired Parts of Letter-learning, without <HI>divine inward Revelation</HI> or <HI>Inspiration,</HI> is sufficient to qualifie a man to be a Minister of the Gospel, and is necessary to his <HI>esse,</HI> or <HI>being</HI> of a Minister, and Grace or true Piety and Holiness, is only accidental, and doth but only contribute to his <HI>bene esse,</HI> or making him the better. By Letter-learning, they do not only mean human Arts and Sciences, and the knowledge of <HI>Greek, Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> but
<PB N="36" REF="000472_0046_0FA673BB67F1F3C0"/>
especially a Letter-knowledge of the Scripture, without any s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving Grace, or illumination of the Spirit, as bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> essential to a Minister: And indeed th y say ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeable enough to their own Doctrine; for if all new Revelation of the Spi∣rit is ceased, what is left behind to qualifie a man to be a Minister,but only natural and ac∣quired parts of Letter-learning? Nor can they with any Reason, affirm, according to their Do∣ctrine, that true Piety and Holiness is essential to a Minister, otherwise no man is a Minister without it, and then it doth follow, that no man can infallibly be known whether he be a real Minister, yea or nay; for if divine inward Re∣velation be ceased, then all infallible discerning of mens Spirits, and spiritual estates is ceased, and no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n can know another infallibly, whether he be a Saint or Hypocrite; for they grant that a H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pocrite may ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all the outwards of a true <HI>Christian,</HI> as the <HI>Pharisees</HI> that made clean the out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide, but their inward was full of Rottenness and Uncleannes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And if a man cannot be known to be a true Minister, according to their Doctrine, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople are in a woful case, as con∣cerning that they call their <HI>Sacraments,</HI> and e∣specially that call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d he <HI>Supper,</HI>which they say cannot be adminis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed but by a true and real Minister; and if any that is not a true Minister, should presume to do any such thing, as to Bless, or Consecrate, and set apa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>read and Wine from common use, it would be no <HI>Sacrament</HI>

at all, as some, or most of them affirm.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now that divine Revelation and Inspira∣tion, is necessary to the Being or Essential Con∣stitution of a Minister of hrist, is evident from the Doctrine already delivered; because it is necessary to the <HI>being</HI> or <HI>essential</HI> Constitution of every true <HI>Christian.</HI> No man is, or can be a true <HI>Christian</HI> without inward divine Revelation or Inspiration, and therefore without the same, no man can be a true <HI>Christian,</HI> or Gospel-Minister, for that which is absolutely necessary to constitute a true <HI>Christian,</HI> or Believer, is absolute∣ly necessary to constitute a true <HI>Christian</HI> Minister, otherwise it might be said, a man may be a true Christian Minister, and yet no true Christian. But every true Minister of Christ, as he ought to be a true Christian, so he ought to be more then an ordinary Christian, so as to exceed or excel them, both in spiritual Knowledge, and other spiritual Gifts, even as in natural teaching, the Master or Teacher should exceed the Schollar; for if divine inward Revelation, and Inspiration, together with other spiritual Gifts, are the com∣mon priviledge of all true <HI>Christians,</HI> in some de∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee, more or less, according to their several g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owth and capacity, much more are they to be found in the true Ministers of Christ, who are both to feed the Babes with Milk, and the strong men with Meat, and to be, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.19, 20. the guide of the Blind, a Light of them which are in Darkness, and Instructors of the Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P N="3">3.

But the great cause and reason, why all tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ministers &amp; Preachers of the Gospel should not only be truly godly and holy men, but also should be indued with some more than ordinary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the holy Spirit, and communications <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not common to all <HI>Christians,</HI> at least in degree, though one spirit in all, is, That the Ministry of every true Minister of Christ, is a Ministration of Grace, of Spirit, of Life and Power, which doth emanate and flow forth from or through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Minister or Preacher, as living Waters th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t emanate or flow from a living <HI>spring</HI> or fountain, which reach and flow into the hearts &amp; inward parts of the Hearers, such as are sensible, and whose hearts God is pleased to open to receive them, and sometimes to the opening and making alive the dead souls and hearts of many hearers, whereby not only many that are spiritually dead, are made alive, but the living are made more living, and livingly refreshed and strengthened; and though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his can hardly, or not at all be received by many, yet thousands can witness it from living experience, That they have felt streams of divine Life, Power and Vertue to spring and flow forth, from the Spirit of Christ, in faithful Preachers, into their souls and inward parts, to their exceeding refreshing, and strengthning in the inward man; and the Scriptures abundantly confirm it, that so it was in the primitive Times, the Ministers of Christ, were the Ministers of the Spirit and Power of

God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the outward and audible Words that reached the outward Ears, were only as a Conduit of Conveyance, to convey and transmit that heavenly Virtue that flowed through them; and therefore the Ministers of God are called in Scripture <HI>flames of Fire,</HI> and their Words and Preaching have a divine and spiritual Fire, and Heat in them, that exceedingly warm and melt the cold and congealed Hearts of many Hearers, and that Fire is a living Fire, or Power of Life to quicken them. And this was it that made the two Disciples, going to <HI>Emanus,</HI> say, <HI>How did our Hearts burn within uss, while he spoke to us by the way, and opened the Scriptures unto us?</HI> And when Christ preached to the People, it is said, <HI>he spoke with Authority,</HI> that is, Power, and not as the <HI>Scribes</HI>; and so did the Apostles, as <HI>Paul</HI> declared, <HI>That his Preaching was in Demonstration of the Spirit, and of Power.</HI> And Christ and the holy Spirit spake in him to the People, when he preached; and so did it in all the other A∣postles and Ministers of Christ, and the Hearers, who had and knew Christ in their own hearts, had a Proof sufficient that Christ spoke in <HI>Paul,</HI> by what they felt of that spiritual Virture and Power that did flow forth through him in his Ministry. And according to this, <HI>Peter</HI> exhorted, <HI>That he who ministers, should minister of the Power that God giveth, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God</HI>; So they ministred not only Words, but Grace, and Power, and Life to

And thus there is a communication of the Grace, and Graces of God, not only be∣twixt Ministers and Hearers, but among all the Faithful, who are as one living Body, but many Members, and every Member a living Member, and ministring Life one to another, as it is in the natural Body; and this is that <HI>Communion of the Saints</HI> that the Scripture testifieth, that they had together in the Spirit, which did knit their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earts together in Love, unto all Riches of the fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l assurance of Understanding, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.2.

But he that speaketh Words, as suppose Scripture-words, and not by the Spirit of Christ speaking in him, there is no divine Seed in the Words, there is the form or body of the Words, but there is no Soul or Life in them, as he speaks them. And these men are like that Harlot which took hold of <HI>Iosephs garment,</HI> but himself she could not enjoy: so many get the outward form of the <HI>words of Truth,</HI> but the Spirit of Truth they have not, and who have it not, cannot minister it: And therefore <HI>Paul</HI> imputeth all the good Fruit and Success of his Ministry not to himself, but to the Grace of God that was with him▪ and in him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.10. How then can a graceless man have any fruit or success in his Ministry, seeing all fruit and success belongeth not to the man, however so well furnished with natural or ac∣quired parts, but to the Grace of God? It is <HI>Grace, Grace,</HI> that maketh a man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Preaching ef∣fectual to the hearers, and that Grace is in the Minister, and worketh both in him, and with him in the Hearts of the hearers, where God is pleased to concur, and give the blessing and in∣crease; and thus the Grace of God is like a good
<PB N="52" REF="000472_0062_0FA673D364A4EBA0"/>
Seed and Plant, that not only bringeth forth Fruit in that little spot of Earth, where it was first planted, but spreadeth abroad, and filleth many other parts and places with it, and hath new Roots and Seeds continually encreasing and multiplying.</P>
<P N="7">7. And as concerning the <HI>Call to the Ministry,</HI> It is worthy of great observation, how they are pinched and narrowed to give any colou∣rable account of their <HI>Call,</HI> who deny all inward and immediate <HI>calling to the Ministry,</HI> and espe∣cially such of them, who say, <HI>The Church of</HI> Rome <HI>is no true Church, but a Harlot, and the Pope is Antichrist</HI>; as the <HI>Westminster</HI> Confession of Faith doth expresly call him, <HI>cap.</HI> 25. <HI>sect.</HI> 6. and yet the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ministers generally derive their Call from him; and I have heard divers of them expresly affirm it, being questioned about their Call, whether <HI>immediate</HI> or <HI>mediate</HI>? they have an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wered <HI>mediate,</HI> from the Apostles; and then being u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged to show the Line of Suc∣cession, through which that <HI>mediate Call</HI> is convey∣ed unto them, they have plainly said, <HI>The Popes of Rome,</HI> as one lately, a Preacher in <HI>New-England</HI> said, before some Hundreds of People, <HI>That their Call to preach, was by the Popes of Rome</HI>; and so according to their own Doctrine, by Antichrist. Surely these men do not believe that Christ is in them, either to call, or furnish them in their Ministry, who must go so far as <HI>Rome</HI> to bring it, and from him too whom they
<PB N="53" REF="000472_0063_0FA673D4215E9A40"/>
call Antichrist. But they think <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Pope however much distant from them, is much nearer then Christ and Heaven, from whom the true Ministers have their Call.</P>
<P N="8">8. And as all true Preaching ought to be by the Inspiration and moving of the Spirit of God, so all true <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Sing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g,</HI> both in private &amp; in publick: for still that is it which the Scrip∣ture enjoyneth, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 6.18. to <HI>Pray always with the Spirit,</HI> or <HI>in the Spirit</HI>; and no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, either in Preaching or Praying, but by the holy Ghost. And I charge them to produce one Instance, where Praying without the Spirit is commanded any where in Scripture, or was ever practised by any of the Saints, with∣out the Inspiration of the Spirit. Do they not grant, that all the Prayers recorded in Scrip∣ture, did proceed from divine Inspiration and Revelation? And if their Pray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs do not, they are quite of a Bastard kind; for the true Wor∣shippers worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth, and the Father seeketh such to worship him, and none else. And whereas some say, <HI>Then men who neglect Prayer, are excusable, because they have not the Spirit to move them to Prayer.</HI> I answer; Not, they are not in the least excusable, for as he that oweth a sum of Money to his Prince, though he hath not wherewith to pay his Debt, is still Debtor, and yet must not pay with false Coyn, but true; so he, who hath not the Spirit's assistance and help to Pray, is still
<PB N="54" REF="000472_0064_0FA673D4E96BF548"/>
obliged to Pray, but not without the Spirit, and and that he hath not the Spirit's help at all sea∣sonable and requisit times for Prayer, it is his own default, who hath resisted the Spirit, and provoked him to with-draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his necessary as∣sistance from him; for the Spirit of the Lord is ready to give his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sonable help to all men, to help them both in Prayer, and Thanksgiving, and all other commanded Duties and Perfor∣mances. And as for <HI>Singing on a Book,</HI> and with <HI>artificial M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sick,</HI> and <HI>notes</HI> or <HI>tones,</HI> it is no part of Gospel-worship, being no where either com∣manded, or practised in the New-Testament. And it is strange, that these men should be against Praying on a Book, and yet Sing on a Book, for if the one be not spiritu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, the other is not.</P>
<P N="9">9. There are others, such as these called <HI>In∣dependents</HI> and <HI>Baptists,</HI> who deny all immediate Call to the Ministry, and yet betake themselves to as poor and shiftless evasion, about their Call, as the former. They say, <HI>They have the Call of the Church.</HI> But still the question is, whence had the Church her Power, either <HI>immediately</HI> or <HI>mediately</HI>? &amp; then the former difficulty return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth: for they cannot say, their Church hath bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> visible from the Apostles days; and besides, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Church is posterior to the Ministry, for by tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Preachers and Ministers, people come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> converted, and so to be made fit Members, of Church, and therefore the Ministers, by whom
<PB N="55" REF="000472_0065_0FA673D7618275F0"/>
their Church was first raised, or gathered, can∣not have their Call from the same, for that were to put the Effect before the Cause; or to say, the Church called the Ministers, and the Ministers called the Church, is to run into an Arcle; as to say, the Egg bringe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h forth the Hen, and the Hen bringeth forth the Egg, to wit, first of all, which is impossible.</P>
<P N="10">10. And as concerning <HI>true Gospel-Mainte∣nance to the Ministry</HI>; any Maintenance that may be necessary, to any that are poor, and have not of their own, according to the Scripture, in ought to be free and voluntary, without force of human Law &amp; compulsion; for the Scripture saith, <HI>He that preacheth the Gospel, should live by the Gospel.</HI> It doth not say, by human Laws, and straining of mens Goods and Cattel, as the Preachers both of Old and <HI>New-England</HI> have done; and they ought to relie upon the gracious Care and Providence of God, that never suffer∣ed his Ministers to want: for when Christ sent forth his Disciples without Bag or Scrip, at their return they said, <HI>they wanted nothing.</HI> Se∣condly, there should be no bargaining in the case betwixt the Minister and the People, for that is altogether mercinary, and proveth them to be Hirelings, and the Servants of men, who have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o hired them. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> they should receive on∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to supply their present Necessities, and labour with their Hands, as honest <HI>Paul</HI> did, that he might make the Gospel of Christ without charge,
<PB N="56" REF="000472_0066_0FA673D8645CAB88"/>
who would not abuse his Power in the Gospel, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.18. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.9. <HI>I was chargeable to no man.</HI> And 1 <HI>Thes</HI> 2.9. <HI>Because we would not be chargeable,</HI> and 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3.8. For why may not Ministers, when they do not Preach, or other∣wise labour in the Ministerial Work, work with their Hands to supply their Necessities, to live honestly and worthily, as many Preachers at this day (as well as formerly) do, both Work and Preach by turns, and as they have freely received, so they give freely; and these no man ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> charge them, that they have made their <HI>Gospel chargeable,</HI> as the Preachers both of Old and <HI>New-England</HI> have done, who have put the People to great charge of many Thousand Pounds yearly, and yet the People is not profited under them and they have by force taken, or caused to be taken, from many who did not hear them, nor own them to be Ministers of Christ, for which they have no president either in the Old or New Testament.</P>
<P N="11">11. And whereas they who plead, <HI>That true Piety is not essential to a Gospel-Minister:</HI> first, bring <HI>Iudas</HI> for a president, to which it is easily answered; <HI>first,</HI> that it is said, <HI>Iudas fell from his Ministry by Transgression,</HI> and therefore some time he stood; and it is more then ever they can prove, that <HI>Iudas</HI> never had any measure of true Piety or Sanctification, when Christ did first send him forth; for although he might have covetous and evil Inclinations, that doth not
<PB N="57" REF="000472_0067_0FA673D8AAF2ACB8"/>
argue that he had nothing of true Sanctification, according to their own Doctrine, who affirm, <HI>That a man may have true Sanctification, and yet have not only strong evil Inclinations, but very evil Practices.</HI> But 2<HI>dly,</HI> when <HI>Iudas</HI> was called, the pure Gospel dispensation had not taken place, and did not until Christ rose from the Dead, and gave the holy Ghost. Next they say, <HI>Christ told the People, that the</HI> Pharisees <HI>sate in</HI> Moses <HI>Chair, and he did not forbid them, but rather encouraged them to hear them, saying, Do what they say, but do not as they do.</HI> To this it is answered, The <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Scribes</HI> teaching belonged to the Law; and so they pass from the true state of the Question, which is, whether Ministers of the Gospel need not true Holiness to make them true Ministers? 3<HI>dly,</HI> They object <HI>Paul</HI>'s words con∣cerning some that preached Christ not sincerely, and yet he said, Christ was preached, and therein he rejoyced. To which I answer, that doth not justifie their Preaching, but it holdeth for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the great Power and Wisdom of God, that causeth all things to work together for his own Glory, and the good of his, as when by Persecutions, and Reproaches, and Slanders, and false Accu∣sations, and contending against the Truth, the Truth doth the more spread and flourish, as hath oft been known, and therein God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervants have rejoyced; yet this doth not justifie these Persecutors, Lyers, and false Accusers.</P>

<P N="1">1. IT hath been a common thing among both <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> Teachers, in Old and <HI>New-England,</HI> to accuse the honest People, called in derision <HI>Quakers,</HI> of being guilty of blasphemy against God and Christ, and the holy Ghost, for no other cause, but that they express their Faith of the great Mystery of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, in Scripture words, and have not freedom to use the words of man's wisdom, and that come on∣ly from the spirit of man, and have not pro∣ceeded from the Spirit of God, whereby to ex∣press and declare their Faith of so great and glo∣rious Mystery: And by means of this so great Accusation, and others as false and injurious, they prevailed with the Magistrates of <HI>New-England,</HI> to cause to be put to Death three dear and precious Men-Servants of the Lord, and one dear and precious Maid-Servant of the Lord, be∣side many other cruel Sufferings inflicted upon others, for which great Cruelty and Barbarity, the Hand of the Lord hath been manifestly stretched out against them, in manifest Judg∣ments and Plagues, that divers among them
<PB N="59" REF="000472_0069_0FA673DD93F081E8"/>
have since acknowledged. And therefore let all men know, to whose Hands this may come, that the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> ever denyed, but on the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntrary, faithfully believed, and do still faithfully believe whatever is recorded in the holy Scriptures, of that great Mystery, to wit▪ that God is one, and that the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost is that one only, true and living God, the Creator and Upholder of all, and Lord and King of all visible and invisible things, &amp; that the Father is begotten of none, the Son is begotten of the Father, from everlasting, and before all Time; and the holy Ghost hath proceeded from the Father, and from the Son, from Everlasting, and before all Time; and that the Son is God manifest in Flesh, who came in the Flesh, in the fulness of time, as the Scrip∣ture declareth; and that the Lord Jesus Christ, whom the Apostles preached, that dyed for our Sins, and rose again for our Justification, and is ascended and gone into Heaven, is that alone Son of God, and the only begotten of the Fa∣ther, in whom the fulness of the God-head dwel∣leth bodily, and the Lord Jesus Christ in the intire and perfect nature of Man, consisting of Soul and Body, is gone into Heaven, and is in Heaven; and that his Body that was crucified, and buried, did not see Corruption, but was raised on the third day, and after forty dayes did ascend, and was glorified, according to which glorious Body of the Lord Jesus Christ,
<PB N="60" REF="000472_0070_0FA673DDD9156300"/>
we believe that at the Resurrection of the Dead our Bodies shall be changed, and be made like, or conform. <HI>Acts</HI> 1.11. and that the same Je∣sus, who is ascended, and was taken u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into Heaven, shall so come in like manner as they did see him go into Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. And as concerning God, we believe, that he is a Spirit, <HI>infinite, unchangeable</HI> and <HI>incom∣prehensible, omniscient, omnipotent</HI> and <HI>omnipresent, infinitly wise, holy, powerful, good, merciful</HI> and <HI>gracious, just</HI> and <HI>righteous,</HI> that he is <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Love</HI>; and whatever the Scripture doth declare of him, we faithfully believe; although this Name of him, to wit, <HI>Light,</HI> the Faith-publishers at <HI>Westminster</HI> have altogether omitted in their Confession, whether heedlesly or designedly, that I leave; but it seemeth they knew little of him, if any thing at all, by that Name; and yet it was the Message that the Apostles heard from him, and declared unto men, <HI>that God is Light, and that he is in the Light,</HI> to wit, <HI>in Christ, who is the Light of men; and that if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have fellowship one with another, and the Blood of his Son Iesus Christ cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anseth us from all Sin,</HI> 1 John 1.5, 6, 7. And indeed it suits most with their Doctrine, that all inward divine Revelation is ceased, either to conceal, or deny that God is Light, as to us, and in us, or in any of his Saints, or that Christ is Light to and in his Saints; for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Light, yea, of all true Light, is to
<PB N="61" REF="000472_0071_0FA673DEA7E7ED58"/>
reveal, and make it self manifest by it self, as well as other things; and this description the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> giveth of it, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.13. <HI>What∣ever maketh manifest is Light,</HI> according to the <HI>English</HI> Translation; or as it may be as well translated, the Light is that which maketh ma∣nifest every thing, to wit, both it self, and all other things: and this description of <HI>Light</HI> be∣longeth only to God and Christ, and the holy Spirit, in the full extent of it; for no created Light, visible or invisible, can manifest or re∣veal all things, the outward light of the Sun can only manifest some outward things, but not all, it cannot let us see what is under the Earth, or in the bottom of the Seas, but God can, and doth search all Deeps, and can reveal or make manifest every thing, however so hid; and there∣fore the Name <HI>Light</HI> doth more properly belong to God, the Father of Lights, and to Christ, and to the holy Ghost, than to any created Light, visible or invisible; and yet a publick Preacher in <HI>New-England,</HI> in the Town of <HI>Hampton,</HI> be∣fore some Hundreds of People, most of them his common Hearers, did affirm, <HI>That God was not properly Light, but only by a Figure borrowed from the outward light of the Sun: and to say, God was Light, and Christ was Light, was the funda∣mental Error of the</HI> Quakers. And though some of his Brethren have blamed his Rashness, yet it cannot be denyed, but he said that which was most consequential &amp; agreeable to his Brethren's

Doctrine, and the <HI>Westminster Confession of Faith,</HI> which the Church of <HI>New-England</HI> hath espou∣sed to be her Confession of Faith also; for if God do not at all reveal himself immediatly, or any other things, he is not Light at all unto his Saints now on Earth; as we may well say, if the outward Sun should with-draw his Beams alto∣gether from the Eyes of men, or that some dark body should be interposed alwayes betwixt the Sun's light and men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Eyes, the Sun should not be Light unto men; for it is the nature and pro∣perty of all Light, to reveal it self immediatly to every one, or else not at all, and alwayes to be its own Messenger, and to discover, teach and direct men by its own Light and Evidence, and not by any other thing. For to say, the Sun doth not lighten u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immediatly, when it giveth us its Illumination, is a great Contradiction that the Assertion carrieth to it self; for what∣ever means or mediums the Sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s light passeth thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh to our Eyes, as the Air, Glass, and the Tunicles of our Eyes, or suppose some Lattise or thin vail, or cloathing, yet its still immediate, or if it be reflected from a Looking-glass, or any other Object, yet the Light it self coming to our sight through all these means, or mediums, and not stopping or staying by the way, nor em∣ploying some other Messenger in its room, to carry the tydings of it to us, it is still immediate, &amp; the Light hath a self-evidence, whereby to make it self known, without any other help or instru∣met, whereby to make it known. And thus God is

Light, and thus not only the Saints knew God to be Light, but also divers of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who had not the Scriptures, knew <HI>God to be Light</HI>; as <HI>Plo∣tinus,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, <HI>As we see &amp; know the Sun by his own Light, so we see and know God by his own Light:</HI> And <HI>Pythagoras</HI> &amp; <HI>Plato</HI> declared <HI>God to be Light</HI>; and it was one of <HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s rules, <HI>Let none pre∣sume to speak or teach of God, without his Light,</HI> wherein he saw further and better into the true Mystery of Preaching and Teaching, then these blind Faith-makers at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and <HI>New-England</HI> Preachers, who have espoused that blind and da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k thing called their <HI>Confession of Faith.</HI> And <HI>Plato</HI> taught, <HI>That God created the Soul of man in a Region of divine Light, and then it con∣versed with the true substance of Light, and of every other thing; but by its Sin, it was thrust down into a Cave, or Dungeon, where it only conversed with Shadows and Figures, or Images of things, which are the things of this outward and perishing World.</HI> And this doth well agree with the Scripture, that saith, <HI>God drove out the Man from the Garden</HI>: And thus the mind of man losing the inward en∣joyment of God, the true Light, did joyn it self to the perishing things of this World, where it can find no true Rest, for they are but Figures and Shadows; and the Scripture calleth this world a Fashion or Figure, and Scheme, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.31. And why is Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t called <HI>the true Light,</HI> and <HI>the true Bread</HI> in Scripture, and <HI>the Truth,</HI> but to signifie unto us, that he is indeed more

truly and properly, and satisfyingly the Soul's true Light and Food, than the outward Light and Bread is unto the Body, or outward man? And therefore in comparison of God, all crea∣ted things of Heaven and Earth, are said to be <HI>nothing,</HI> and <HI>less then nothing,</HI> and the <HI>Nations are as nothing,</HI> and <HI>less then nothing before him,</HI> Isa. 40.17. And therefore as the Name <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing,</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> doth most properly belong to him, as Christ said, <HI>There is none good, but God.</HI> So the names <HI>Light, Life</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> do most properly belong to him, though it is most readily gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted, that he doth infinitly surpass and excel all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat men can either speak, or think of him, and that he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th a Name that none knoweth, but he himself; but since it hath pleased God to call himself by the Name <HI>Light,</HI> spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king unto men in the Lan∣guage of the Sons of men; I say, in the language of men, the Name <HI>Light</HI> doth most properly, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout all Figure, belong to God and Christ, and this the Saints in Light well knew; but they who know not the Light, and believe not in it, it is no wonder that they think that God or Christ is Light only by a Figure or Metaphor, from the outward Light: for indeed the <HI>Anima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or natural man, that only followeth his natural Thoughts and Apprehensions, doth not kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, but by Figures and Shadows: And though I plead for the <HI>immediate Revelation</HI> of God and Christ in the Hearts and Spirits of his Saints, who is their Light and Life, yet the means are

owned and acknowledged in their place, as good men are Means, good Books, and especially the Scriptures are means whereby to transmit the Light of God and Christ unto us, as he is plea∣sed to make use of them, and not otherwise, even as the Air, or Glass of the Window, can∣not convey any light of the Sun unto us but when the Sun shineth; for when the Sun with∣draweth, and hideth his Face, the Air and the Glass hath no Light to convey unto us: and thus it is as to all Men, and Books, and Means, they can convey no Light to us, but what, how, and when <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> is pleased to send forth through them unto us; and this <HI>Da∣vid</HI> well knew, when he prayed, saying, <HI>O send forth thy Light, and thy Truth, to lead me and guide me to thy holy Hill, and lift up the Light of thy Countenance upon u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Psal. 43.3. Psal. 4.6. And as it pleaseth God often, to transmit the Beams of his divine Light, Life and Love into our Souls, through Means and Instruments, as good Men, and good Books, and especially in reading or meditating in the Scriptures, and also good Angels, who are ministring Spirits, and do mi∣nister to the Heirs of Salvation, so many times it pleaseth him to bring them into a solitude, or solitary place, <HI>Hosea,</HI> and there to speak unto them, and reveal himself, to the unspeak∣able satisfaction of their Souls, whithout all means whatsoever, save only that great, and al∣ways most necessary and desireable Mean, the

Lord Jesus Christ, in and through whom the Father doth always speak, and reveal his Glory to his dear Children, even as Christ declared, saying, <HI>No man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him.</HI> For none of all the Prophets or Apostles did know, or con∣verse with God, but as the Son did reveal him, who is that most lovely and aimable skreen, cloathing or vail, through which the Glory of the Father shineth forth into our Souls, meekly, and gently, and yet most sweetly, according as every one is able to receive.</P>
<P N="3">3. And they who deny all inward divine Re∣velation of God in his Saints, ever since the A∣postles dayes, and would wholly exclude the Saints from all inward enjoyment of God and Christ, in their own immediate Light, Glory and Brightness, may be justly charged with <HI>Blas∣phemy</HI> against the great love and kindness of God to his People: and such of the Priests of <HI>New-England,</HI> who have blasphemously called the Light of God in his People, <HI>A stinking Vapour from Hell</HI>; and do blaspheme against the Light of God and Christ in all men, in a Day of Visi∣tation, that is given to lead and bring them un∣to God, <HI>a meer human and natural Light, corrupt and dark,</HI> as some of them have called it, and as they generally esteem of it.

And whereas these Faith-publishers at <HI>Westminster</HI> in Old <HI>England,</HI> and at <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> do say in their Confession, <HI>cap.</HI> 26. <HI>sect.</HI> 3. <HI>This Communion which the Saints have with Christ, doth not make them in any wise pertakers of the Substance of his God-head, and that to affirm it is impious, and blasphemous.</HI> It deserveth our se∣rious consideration, and to examin where the Impiety and Blasphemy lie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, whether at their door who deny it, or theirs who affirm it? even <HI>that the Saints are pertakers of the Substance of his God-head.</HI> And first, as to their Proof from Scripture, they cite <HI>Col.</HI> 1.18, 19. <HI>And he is the Head of the Body, the Church, who is the beginning, the first-born from the Dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence; for it pleased the Fa∣ther, that in him should all fulness dwell.</HI> But this place of Scripture saith not that the Saints are not pertakers of the Substance of the God-head of Christ, but the contrary may be proved from this very place, which calleth him, <HI>the Head of the Body, the Church.</HI> For as it is the same Sub∣stance of Life, that is in the Head, &amp; in the Body, and every Member of it. So it is the same divine Life and Spirit, that is in Christ, the Head, and all his Members, and that Spirit is the holy Spirit, and that Life is the Word, and the Word

and the Spirit are one Substance and Beeing with God, as the same Confession saith, <HI>cap.</HI> 2. <HI>sect.</HI> 3. And that the Saints are pertakers of the divine Nature, and of the holy Ghost, the Scripture expresly declareth it, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. and <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4. So that it is marvelous blindness, or inadver∣tency in these men, so to contradict the express Scripture testimony: And for the Word <HI>Sub∣stance,</HI> with respect to the inward enjoyment of God and Christ, the Scripture hath it expresly in several places, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8·21. <HI>That I may cause those that love me to inherit Substance; and I will fill their Treasures.</HI> And <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.34. <HI>Knowing that in your selves</HI> (for so the <HI>Greek</HI> doth bear it) <HI>ye have in Heaven a better, and more enduring Substance.</HI> For as they had it in Heaven, so they had an earnest of it on Earth, in their Hearts; and that all fulness dwelleth in Christ, doth not prove that his Saints enjoy none of that fulness, but on the contrary. <HI>Out of his Fulness,</HI> as said <HI>Iohn, we have all received, and Grace for Grace,</HI> John 1.16. And not only the Saints receive Gifts and Graces from Christ, but they receive him, and the Father in him, and with him, to live and dwell in them, according to <HI>Iohn</HI> 17.23. <HI>I in them, and thou in me.</HI> And yet this doth not infer that the Saints are equal with Christ, that they have the same Spirit and Life with him, and through him, and by and from him, as it doth not prove that the Foot i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> equal with the Head, because the same Soul or
<PB N="69" REF="000472_0079_0FA673E940FD4FA8"/>
Spirit that is in the Head, is in the Foot; and the same Life that is in the Root of a Tree, is in the Branches; and as Christ said, <HI>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches.</HI> And if the Saints do no wise pertake of the Substance of the God∣head of Christ, I ask them, what do they per∣take of him? Do they pertake only of the Sub∣stance of his Manhood without the Godhead, or of neither? If the first, then the Manhood of Christ, as they pertake of it, is without the Godhead, which is Blasphemy indeed; or if the second, that is to say, the Saints do neither per∣take of the Substance of his Godhead, nor of the Substance of his Manhood, then they pertake nothing of Christ at all substantially, according to their Doctrine. O miserable Teachers! What then do they pertake of him, if nothing <HI>Substanti∣ally</HI>? of his Accidents, as they commonly say, <HI>All Graces are nothing but Accidents.</HI> Then here is a new sort of Doctrine of <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> as these of <HI>Rome</HI> say, <HI>The consecrated Wafer or Cake, hath the Accidents of Bread in it, as the colour, taste and smell of Bread, but nothing of the Sub∣stance of Bread is there.</HI> So say these Faith-makers, <HI>The Saints that did see, smell, taste and feel of Christ in antient times, that which they did spiritually see, smell, taste and feel with their Souls and Hearts, is only Accidents, and no Substance.</HI> This is more strange than that other, that there is no Substance of Bread in the Cake, but only the Accidents. But why was not your reverend

Brother, as ye called him, <HI>Iohn Owen,</HI> taxed with Blasphemy, for affirming, <HI>That the holy Ghost doth dwell in Believers really</HI> (&amp; as he worded it personally) <HI>together with his Graces.</HI> And <HI>Sa∣muel Rutherfold,</HI> a great <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> who said in one of his printed Epistles, <HI>He will have none of the Graces of Christ without himself, and if the Graces did come unto him without Christ, he would send them away the Gate (or way) they came.</HI> And as for the other Scriptures they cite, they prove in∣deed that the Lord Jesus Christ is but one, &amp; there is none else, nor is any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, or men, or Angels equal to him, which we most cordially believe; but they say, not in the least, nor by any just consequence, can it be gathered, that the Saints do not pertake substantially of God. And to show the great inequality betwixt Christ and the Saints, not only in the measure and degree, but in the manner or kind of pertaking of the holy Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, which is one Substance with God Christ, the Son, hath God, and the holy Spirit, without any middle, or mediator betwixt the Father and him, but the Saints only have, and enjoy the Father, and the holy Spirit, through Christ the mediator, and together with him, and in him: And this I hope will satisfie all so∣ber and impartial men, to clear the Doctrine of the <HI>Qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers,</HI> that it is according to Scripture.</P>
<P N="4">4. Next, as concerning the <HI>Decrees of God,</HI> these Faith-publishers say, <HI>That God hath un∣changeably ordained whatsoever comes to pass, yet
<PB N="70" REF="000472_0081_0FA673EAB6CF3C18"/>
so as neither is God the Author of Sin, nor is Violence offered to the will of the Creatures:</HI> Whereby it plainly appeareth, they hold that God hath or∣dained and decreed all manner of Sins and Blas∣phemies, Adulteries▪ Thefts, Robberies, Ho∣micides, Regicides, &amp;c. which is abominable and blasphemous Doctrine, with a witness. They need not blame the <HI>Ranters,</HI> seeing they are so fully one with them in Doctrine; for that is one of the worst Doctrines that the Ranters have, <HI>That God doth all, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d hath unchangeably ordained and decreed all things, both good and bad</HI>; for certainly whatever God hath ordained and decreed to come to pass, he is the doer of it, for he executeth (that is, bringeth to pass) all his own Decrees, as they confess in their large <HI>Catechism,</HI> ans. to Quest. 14. and that they say, <HI>yet so, as God is not the Author of sin</HI>; they say it indeed, and so say many of the worst sort of <HI>Ranters,</HI> but how they clear their Doctrine of so unavoidable consequence, they have not told the world, nor ever can they sufficiently clear it. And for the Scriptures they bring, as espe∣cially <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.11. <HI>That God worketh all things after the counsel of his own Will</HI>; here is nothing mentioned of the sins of men and Devils: It is plain both from Reason, and Scripture, that by <HI>all things</HI> must needs be understood <HI>all his own Works,</HI> &amp; not the Sins of men and Devils, which he is not the Author of; as when we say, <HI>every wise man doth all things by Wisdom, and wise Coun∣sel</HI>;
<PB N="72" REF="000472_0082_0FA673F21A9E6848"/>
none is so foolish as to put this gloss upon it, <HI>that he doth all foolish things.</HI> It is an approved Maxime and Rule, <HI>Verba sunt intelligenda, secun∣dum subjectam materiam,</HI> i. e. Words are to be understood according to the subject matter. It is worthily granted &amp; acknowledged, that God worketh all good things, all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> is of him, all <HI>good Thoughts, Words</HI> &amp; <HI>Works, &amp;c.</HI> But all Sin is of the Devil, and evil men, as <HI>Iohn</HI> said, <HI>Whosoever committeth Sin, is of the Devil, and the Lust o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Flesh, the lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, is all of the Devil, and not of the Father.</HI> And as Christ said, <HI>The Devil when he speaketh a Lye, he speaketh of his own.</HI> It is also granted, that when any commit Sin, the power whereby they act, is of God; but when they Sin, they abuse that Power; and also whatever Sin cometh to pass, is not without God's permission, and that is not a bare permission, but a most holy and wise ordering, and bounding of it to his own Glory. And as to <HI>Acts</HI> 2.23. a main place, that <HI>Ranters,</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> Tea∣chers abuse and wrest, (as they do other Scrip∣tures, to their own Destruction, if they repent not) it giveth them no strength at all. For it saith, <HI>Him</HI> (to wit, Christ) <HI>being delivered by the determinate Counsel and Fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken,</HI> &amp;c. So we see, that he was deli∣vered, or exposed unto them by the determinato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Counsel of God, but that they did kill him by the determinate counsel of God, the Scripture
<PB N="73" REF="000472_0083_0FA673F37786EF70"/>
saith not. For to <HI>deliver</HI> is one thing, and to <HI>slay</HI> is another. Our worthy Friends that were put to Death at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> they de∣livered up their Lives freely into the Hands of these Murtherers, and so did many of the Mar∣tyrs, not accepting deliverance; and yet they did not kill themselves, as these bloody Persecu∣tors use to alledge. And that its said, <HI>God hard∣neth whom he will.</HI> His hardning, is not the ma∣king their Hearts hard, with infusing any evil Spirit into them, but that he justly with-draws his good Spirit from them, for great Sins for∣merly committed, and so leaveth them to harden their own Hearts. As it is said, <HI>That</HI> Pharoah <HI>hardned his Heart.</HI> And thus do many sober and judicious <HI>Protestants</HI> understand the Words.</P>
<P N="5">5. Again, as concerning <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Repro∣bation,</HI> first, as to the Election and Predestina∣tion of the Saints unto eternal Glory, and Hap∣piness, whatever the Scripture saith of it, or of any other Doctrine, we do readily believe and acknowledge it, as, That God hath chosen the Saints in Christ Jesus before the fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dation of the World, that they should be holy and un∣blameable before him in Love, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.4. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.29. <HI>For whom he did fore-know, he also did predestinate, to be conform to the Image of his Son,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and whom he did predestinate, them he called, and whom he called, them he justified.</HI> And what Christ said to the Disciples, <HI>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you, to bring
<PB N="75" REF="000472_0084_0FA673F399950AB0"/>
forth fruit, &amp; that your fruit should remain, Iohn</HI> 15.16. and 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 4.10. <HI>Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the Propitiation for our sins</HI>; and vers. 19. <HI>We love him, because he first loved us.</HI> A most sweet and comfortable Testimony, as all the other. But we no where find in al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Scripture, that God hath <HI>Reprobated</HI> any part of Mankind, be∣fore the foundation of the World; nor is it said, that men hate God, because he first hated them; and because God hated them, he made them, on purpose to damn or destroy them, and decreed and ordained them to sin, that he might take occasion thereby to damn them. No such thing at all is found in the holy Scriptures, nor can be gathered from them by any just conse∣quence; for although it be allowed, that Gods purpose and holy Will concerning them that finally perish, is from before the Foundation of the World (for there is no new Will or Purpose in God, the Thoughts and Counsels of his heart being from everlasting, as himself is) yet that Will of God regardeth and considereth them that shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inally perish, not simply as men, nor yet simply as sinners, either for <HI>Adam's</HI> sin, or other sins that they have formerly committed, be∣fore that great <HI>Sin of final Vnbelief</HI> &amp; <HI>Impenitency,</HI> but it doth regard and consider them, as having a day of Visitation, and a Call to Repent, and a tender of Grace, Love and Mercy from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and as ha∣ving
<PB N="74" REF="000472_0085_0FA673F45DDDBC98"/>
resisted and rejected the same, and hardning their hearts against it, and that finally, until the Day of their Visitation be over, whereby they declare themselves unworthy of eternal Life, and that they are none of Christ's Sheep, but Goats, to be put at the left Hand; and if any say, <HI>If these men were not Elected before the Foundation of the World, it will follow that they were Reprobated before it.</HI> I answer; it doth not follow; for E∣lected and Reprobated are not contradictory terms, being both positive, and <HI>Election</HI> signi∣fieth a Preference of some before others, but that doth not argue a total <HI>Reprobation</HI> of others, when God did elect some. But at the End of the World, and in the Conclusion it is granted, that all who are not elected, are but Reprobates, to wit, when all God's elect Seed every where, are gathered out, selected and seperated from others, as so many Grains of pure Gold from all the Dross, Tin and Lead that they have been ming∣led with for a time, here in this world, that then nothing will remain but that which is Re∣probate, and which the Scripture calleth <HI>repro∣bate Silver,</HI> the pure being wholly separated and selected from the impure, the Gold &amp; Silver from the Dross, the Wheat from the Tares, the Sheep from the Goats, and the good Fish from the bad, and the Children of the Kingdom, from the Children of the wicked One, he who hath Ears to hear, let him hear, and the wise in heart let them understand, for unto them it is given,
<PB N="76" REF="000472_0086_0FA673F51E382138"/>
but unto others, as Christ said, in Parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing that they may not hear, nor understand. And also it is readily granted, that there is a special and pe∣culiar, and singularly gracious Care and Provi∣dence of God, towards all that shall be saved from the beginning of the world to the end, and the number of them is most infallibly known unto God, and every one of that number shall certainly be saved, and none of them shall finally perish, but in the proper season and time shall be graciously <HI>visited, called, converted, justified, san∣ctified,</HI> and last of all <HI>glorified,</HI> and this without any Violence done to their rational Faculties or Free-will; for God doth well know how to gain and prevail upon the Understanding, and Will, and Inclinations of his People, by such gentle, and yet prevalent and overcoming Perswasions and Allurements, and Motions of his holy Spirit of Grace, of Light and Life, as shall infallibly gather them unto himself. And it is also grant∣ed, That as God hath provided that Grace, whereby some shall certainly be saved, so by the same all are put under a capacity or possibility of Salvation: and therefore that any are not saved in this world, is not because of any want, or defect in the sufficiency, or efficacy in the Grace in its own Nature; but because of them, whom God in his infinite Justice and Counsel permits finally to resist it, even as in the Parable of the Sower, the Seed was one and the same in all the
<PB N="77" REF="000472_0087_0FA673F5E16A65C8"/>
four Grounds, but the Grounds differed one from another, and that one Ground was good, was of God, but that others were bad, was of themselves; and the word <HI>Election</HI> doth proper∣ly enough signifie, <HI>selectory, seperating</HI> and <HI>setting a part</HI> or <HI>refining,</HI> as when Gold or Silver is sepe∣rated in the Furnace from the Dross. And thus seperation hath had it various degrees and pro∣gress, from first to last, as when Gold or Silver is purified or purged in the fire seven times, and then in the seventh time, it hath no mixture, but is all pure, or as when Liquor is poured from Vessel to Vessel several times, or as Wheat is winnowed again and again, until all the Chaff be separated. And in this sense we find the word <HI>Election</HI> used in Scripture divers times. <HI>Isa.</HI> 14.1. <HI>For the Lord will have mercy on</HI> Jacob, <HI>and will yet chuse</HI> Israel. And <HI>Isa.</HI> 49.7. <HI>And he shall chuse thee.</HI> And <HI>Zach.</HI> 1.17. <HI>And the Lord shall yet comfort</HI> Zion, <HI>and shall yet chuse</HI> Jerusalem. And Zach. 2.12. <HI>He shall chuse</HI> Jerusalem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And Isa. 48.10. <HI>I have chosen thee in the Furnace of Affliction.</HI> And in this sence of the Word, as it signifieth a selecting or seperating the pure from the impure, <HI>Election</HI> doth go before <HI>Repro∣bation,</HI> and is not coevous with it. But whe∣ther that <HI>Election</HI> in Christ before the Foundation of the world, doth in some sort signifie a <HI>selection</HI> or <HI>setting apart</HI> in <HI>Christ</HI> the Head, who was before the Foundation of the world, &amp; is said to be <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amb slain from the Foundation of the World,</HI> as some mystick Writers affirm, it is not my present

<P N="6">6. But the place of Scripture which they main∣ly abuse and wrest, to prove this reprobate Do∣ctrine of theirs, of an absolute Reprobation of the greatest part of mankind, even before they are born, and that not only Babes and Sucklings on the Mothers Breasts, but in the Womb are absolute Reprobates and cast-aways, and that some, yea, many <HI>Infants dye in a state of Reprob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion, and perish eternally</HI> (only for <HI>Adams</HI> sin im∣puted unto them (as they say, without any knowledge or consent of theirs) and corrupt Nature derived into them) and that all such Reprobates never had, or ever shall have any opportunity of saving Grace, whereby it was possible to them at any time to be saved. The place of Scripture, I say, they mainly abuse and wrest, to favour this evil and pernicious Do∣ctrine, is that in <HI>Rom.</HI> 9·11, 12, 13. But for the opening and vindicating of this place of Scrip∣ture, let it be considered, that here is only a pre∣ference mentioned of <HI>Iacob</HI> before <HI>Esau,</HI> how that the Elder shall serve the Younger, but this saith nothing of <HI>Esau</HI> his being absolutely repro∣bated. The great design of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> being to show that God had chosen the Line of <HI>Iacob</HI> before the Line of <HI>Esau,</HI> and given unto that Line and Posterity of <HI>Iacob,</HI> a Preference and Dignity over the Line and Posterity of <HI>Esau,</HI> and that the reason of this Preference was not
<PB N="79" REF="000472_0089_0FA673F8E053BDD8"/>
any Works that they had done, but for some other cause hid in the secret counsel of God; and this Preference did appear, first, in chusing the Line and Posterity of <HI>Iacob,</HI> to be his Church in that peculiar Dispensation of the <HI>Mosaical Law,</HI> and given them many Prophets, and other ex∣cellent men, to be raised up among them, and honouring them with many great and signal Ap∣pearances, Signs and Wonders; whereas the Posterity of <HI>Esau</HI> was not so highly favoured, and yet they had a divine Dispensation among them, which did suffice unto that present time and state. Secondly, in that God did chuse the Line of <HI>Iacob,</HI> and his Posterity, out of whom Christ should be born after the Flesh, and also the A∣postles, and that out of <HI>Iacob</HI> the Gospel should go forth and be preached to all the World. 3dly, That the Nation that should come of <HI>Esau</HI> should really become Servants, and Tributaries to the Nation of <HI>Israel</HI>; and this was fulfilled in <HI>Da∣vid</HI>'s time, and was also a Figure of another thing to be spiritually fulfilled. And therefore this <HI>Election</HI> doth not infer any <HI>Reprobation</HI> of <HI>Esau,</HI> or his Posterity, as to their eternal estate, no more then when <HI>David</HI> said, 1 <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron.</HI> 28 4, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>The Lord God of</HI> Israel <HI>chose me before all the house of my Father, for he hath chosen</HI> Judah <HI>to be the Ruler, and the House of</HI> Judah, <HI>the House of my Father, and of the Sons of my Father, he liked me to make me King over all</HI> Israel; <HI>and of all my Sons, he hath chosen</HI> Solomon <HI>my Son.</HI> So here are di∣vers
<PB N="80" REF="000472_0090_0FA674269DFFB3E8"/>
Elections; first, <HI>Judah</HI> out of all the Tribes; secondly, the Family of <HI>Iesse,</HI> out of the Tribe of <HI>Iudah</HI>; thirdly, <HI>David</HI> out of all the Sons of <HI>Iesse</HI>; and fourthly, <HI>Solomon</HI> out of all the Sons of <HI>David,</HI> and yet no absolute Reprobation of any that were not so chosen, as to their eternal state. And because many of the People of <HI>Israel</HI> were proud, because of this choice and prefe∣rence that God made of their Nation, above the Nation of <HI>Esau,</HI> so as to make them a Church to himself, when the Nation of <HI>Esau</HI> was not so favoured, for Reasons best known unto God, and for that cause did conclude, that they were always to remain a People singularly favoured of him above all other People, from first to last. To beat down this vain Conceit of theirs, <HI>Paul</HI> telleth them, <HI>first,</HI> That they are not all <HI>Israel,</HI> which are of <HI>Israel: Secondly,</HI> That as God did prefer, and make choice of the Nation of <HI>Israel,</HI> to be a gathered People and Church unto him, before the Nation of <HI>Esau,</HI> and that without any regard to their Works, or to the Works of their Fathers, but for some other hid Cause and Reason in the depth of Gods secret Counsel; so God could as freely, yea, and would prefer the poor <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who were no People, to be a Peo∣ple unto him, and a Gospel-Church, to become true Believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, when in the mean time the bulk and body of the Nation of <HI>Israel</HI> should be rejected, and cast off, at least for some time, from having any such dignity

and favour (a Remnant only being reserved, ac∣cording to the Election of Grace, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.5.) and this <HI>Paul</HI> proveth at large, from Verse 25 of that 9th Chapter, to Verse 33. and doth fur∣ther prosecute it in the two following Chapters. Verse 25. &amp;c. <HI>As he saith also in</HI> Osee, <HI>I will call them my People, which were not my People, and her beloved, which was not beloved.</HI> And verse 30. <HI>What shall we say then? that the</HI> Gentiles <HI>which fol∣lowed not after Righteousness, have attained to Righ∣teousness, even the Righteousness of Faith; but</HI> Is∣rael, <HI>which followed after the Law of Righteousness, hath not attained to the Law of Righteousness, be∣cause they sought it not by Faith,</HI> &amp;c. So, we see how <HI>Paul</HI> maketh the Parallel, that as God once preferred, or chused <HI>Iacob</HI>'s Nation, before the Nation of <HI>Esau,</HI> so again he prefered and chused the <HI>Gentiles</HI> (that had no good Works to recom∣mend them, and to move God to make that choice) out of his free Mercy, before the People of <HI>Israel</HI>; and of these <HI>Gentiles,</HI> no doubt, many of them did belong to the Posterity of <HI>Esau,</HI> and also of <HI>Ishmael,</HI> yea, of <HI>Cain</HI>; for their is an ex∣press Promise made to the Remnant of <HI>Edom,</HI> and of all the <HI>Heathen,</HI> upon whom his Name is, or shall be called, <HI>Amos</HI> 9.12. <HI>And it is but a Remnant also of</HI> Israel <HI>that is saved, until the great¦fulness of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>come in, and then all</HI> Israel (to wit, the true <HI>Israel,</HI> which is not all who are of <HI>Israel</HI> after the Flesh) <HI>shall be saved</HI>; see <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.27. and 11.5.25, 26. And lastly, it is
<PB N="82" REF="000472_0092_0FA6742C401EB360"/>
to be again considered, that what God spoke unto <HI>Rebecca,</HI> before the Children were born, not having done Good or Evil, did not so much regard the singular Persons of <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> as their Posterities, as is clear from <HI>Gen.</HI> 25.23. <HI>And the Lord said unto her, Two Nations are in thy Womb, and two manner of People shall be sepa∣rated from thy Bowels; and the one People shall be stronger t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an the other People, and the Elder shall serve the Younger.</HI> So we see here, the words are said of the Nations of <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> and not the Persons of them; for we read not any where that ever <HI>Esau</HI> in Person served <HI>Iacob,</HI> but only in his Posterity, as was fulfilled in <HI>David</HI>'s time, when the <HI>Edomites</HI> became Tributaries to the People of <HI>Israel</HI>: nor was it said before the Chil∣dren were born, <HI>Iacob have I loved, and</HI> Esau <HI>have I hated,</HI> as it is commonly alledged, but many hundred Years after he was deceased. And if it had been so said, it could not prove an ab∣solute rejection either of <HI>Esau,</HI> or his Posterity, as to their eternal state; for God is said in Scrip∣ture to hate all Evil-doers, and yet many Evil-doers repent, and obtain Salvation; and there∣fore Hatred doth not signifie absolute and final hatred, either in God or men: for it is said, <HI>Iacob loved</HI> Rachel, <HI>and hated</HI> Leah; that is, he loved <HI>Rachel</HI> more: and Christ said, <HI>He that hateth not Father and Mother for my cause, is not worthy of me</HI>; that is, He that loveth me not more than Father and Mother. And therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

conclude this whole passage in <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.11, 12. doth not prove the absolute Reprobation of either <HI>Esau,</HI> or o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Posterity, because many of <HI>Esau</HI>'s posterity had a Promise of Salvation, as is already proved from <HI>Amos</HI> 9. And if <HI>Esau</HI> had been an absolute Reprobate, the Scrip∣ture would never have said, <HI>That</HI> Isaac <HI>by Faith blessed</HI> Jacob <HI>and</HI> Esau <HI>concerning things to come,</HI> Heb. 9.20. And that Faith was the Substance of things hoped for, and had a regard to the spi∣ritual Blessing of <HI>Esau,</HI> and of his Posterity; for though <HI>Iacob</HI> got the first Blessing, yet <HI>Esau</HI> got the second, and their two Blessings did not dif∣fer in Substance, but in some weighty Circum∣stances of order and time; and <HI>Isaac</HI> prophesied in <HI>Esau's</HI> Blessing, that he should have the fat∣ness of the Earth, and dew of Heaven (the same, but the order inverted with <HI>Iacob's</HI> blessing) and that in process of time he should be a free Peo∣ple, to wit, in Gospel dayes, signified by these words, <HI>Gen.</HI> 27.40. <HI>And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt have Dominion,</HI> to wit, in Christ, in Gospel dayes, <HI>in thy Posterity, that thou shalt break his Yoke from off thy Neck.</HI> And so we find that divers (<HI>Mark</HI> 3.8.) <HI>Idumeans,</HI> that were of <HI>Esau,</HI> followed Jesus; and <HI>Iacob's</HI> putting on <HI>Esau's</HI> goodly Rayment, signified how in Gospel dayes, the true Believers of <HI>Iacob,</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> should become one Body of a Gospel-Church, and in this Body they of <HI>Esau</HI> should be as Hands, but the Voice is <HI>Iacob's,</HI> that is, the Word of

God, in the preaching of the Gospel, should be sounded out of <HI>Iacob's</HI> Line, to wit, from the Prophets and Apostles, who were of <HI>Iacob.</HI> And there is no ground from Scripture, that <HI>Esau,</HI> as to his Person, was not saved; yea, <HI>Lu∣ther,</HI> and <HI>Moller,</HI> and <HI>Oecolampadius,</HI> all famous Protestants in their day, judge rather that he was saved; and the whole passage of <HI>Iacob</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> beside that it hath its historical fulfilling, is a Figure of two inward Seeds and Births, none of which are reprobated, but the other prefer∣ed. But if some alledge <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.17. to prove that absolutely <HI>Esau</HI> was rejected, and did perish, because its said, <HI>He found no place of Repentance, though he sought it carefully with Tears.</HI> I answer, That doth not prove his final rejection, but only that he could not be heard to have that first Bles∣sing recalled, which was already given to <HI>Iacob.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Where now shall these men find any place in Scripture to prove, that there are any <HI>reprobate</HI> Infants? or that any Infants dying in Infancy go to Hell, and perish eternally, only for <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin, although that Sin was fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>given to <HI>Adam,</HI> and Thousands more equally guilty, by their own confession? If they shall alledge, as some do, that place in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.14. <HI>For the unbelieving Husband is sanctified by the Wife</HI> (viz. that believeth) <HI>&amp; the unbelieving Wife is sanctified by the Husband, else were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</HI> Yet this cannot prove their Intention▪ For they dare not confidently say, that all Infants

of <HI>believing Parents</HI> are elected, otherwise they must say, that <HI>Esau</HI> was elected, both whose Parents were Believers. Although some in Church-Covenant have gloried, that none of their Children, while Infants, were Reprobates, because they were in covenant, and yet at that same time pleading that <HI>Esau</HI> was a Reprobate in his Mother's Belly, forgetting that both <HI>Esau</HI>'s Parents were more holy then they. And if any further urge, <HI>If there be no reprobate Infants, that then all Infants are sanctified and holy, both the Children of unbelieving Parents, as well as of Be∣lievers.</HI> I answer; It doth not follow by any necessary consequence, although to admit of that Consequence, is much more tollerable, then to say, that any Infants perish eternally, only for <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin. And as for the general state of Infants, and how they are particularly disposed of immediately after Death, who dye in Infancy, seemeth a great depth, and is a great mystery, and is best known unto the Lord: For it is gene∣rally granted, that God hath his way to reach to Infants, and deal with them, both in the Womb, and upon the Mothers Breasts; and therefore let us leave secret things unto God, until he reveal them, and be satisfied with what he hath revealed. Now this is plainly revealed, and declared in the Scriptures, that the Con∣demnation is not simply that <HI>Adam</HI> sinned, or his Posterity in, and with him, <HI>but that Light is come into the World, and men love Darkness more
<PB N="86" REF="000472_0096_0FA67431F9CDAB20"/>
than Light</HI>; And as by the offence of one, to wit, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Adam,</HI> Judgment is come upon all to Condemnation; even so by the Righteousness of one, to wit, Christ the second <HI>Adam,</HI> the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee Gift is come upon all to Justification of Life. And though men generally are by Nature, Chil∣dren of Wrath (if it should be granted or allow∣ed, that by <HI>Nature,</HI> signifieth their natural con∣dition, as they are born into the world) yet by the great Mercy, Grace and favour of God, they all have an opportunity or possibility to be converted, and become the Children of God. And what that Holiness or Cleanness is, that the Children of one, or both the believing Pa∣rents have, is a great Mystery, I am sure to many who have that Scripture place oft in their Mouthes, and greatly glory in it, that they are in Church-Covenant, and therefore they are holy, and their Children; also some call it federal or Covenant-Holiness, but what it is they know not, whether it be any real thing, or principle of Holiness, lodged or placed in their Children, more than in the Children of others that are not in their Church-Covenant, they dare not affirm; for many, yea, very many Children of professed <HI>Christians</HI> of all sorts, when they grow up to Youth, are as unholy, and sometimes worse, as the Children of Unb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lievers. But that Children generally either of Believers, or Unbelie∣vers, are actually sanctified from the Womb, or in the Womb, cannot be proved from Scripture,
<PB N="87" REF="000472_0097_0FA674329786CFD8"/>
or any Observation that we can make. It is re∣corded as a rare and great thing, that <HI>Iohn</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> was sanctified from the Mother's Womb, and the like of <HI>Ieremia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and so per∣haps may be gathered of <HI>Moses,</HI> or some others, but these rare and singular Examples, rather prove, that Children are not in general, actually and <HI>de facto</HI> holy from the Womb; and therefore that Holiness of Children, mentioned 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. must only signifie some more near capacity in them, than in others, to become actually holy in time to come, and that not of all Children after the Flesh, but the Children of Promise, as <HI>Paul</HI> distinguisheth these two sorts of Children of the same Parents, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.8. But who are the Children of the Flesh, and who are the Children of the Promise? though it be well known unto God from the beginning, yet commonly it is not known unto men, until they discover themselves by their Works and Fruits.</P>
<P N="7">7. As concerning the general state of Mankind by means of <HI>Adams</HI> fall, what the Scripture saith of it, is readily believed and granted, and it is safest in all things, to keep to Scripture words, especially in all cases and matters that are in Controversie. For the Scripture is a rich Trea∣sury or Store-house, sufficiently to afford us Words whereby to express our Faith in all mat∣ters of <HI>Christian Doctrine</HI>; and it is not safe to leave the Scripture-words, and go to words of mans wisdom, and thereby to declare our Faith

of Christian Doctrine. Now the Scripture saith, <HI>That in</HI> Adam <HI>all dye,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.22. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. <HI>That by one man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and so Death passed upon all men; for that all have sinned</HI>: And that Christ hath dyed for all men, proveth that all men were dead, as <HI>Paul</HI> argueth the case. And <HI>David,</HI> though he was the Son of a good Father, yet be∣wailed the state wherein he was conceived and born, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.5. <HI>Behold I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> And that under <HI>Moses</HI> Law, an Offering was to be offered up for the Mother and the Child, (<HI>Levit.</HI> 12.4, 5, 6.) when it was Born, and that the Mother should be unclean so many dayes after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irth of the Child, doth certainly signifie a Seed, or Principle of Sin and Corruption, to be conveyed from the Parents to the Children, in the ordi∣nary way of Generation, and that the menstru∣ous Humour was held in Scripture to be such a filthy and unclean thing, which is called, <HI>The Fountain of her Blood,</HI> Levit. 20.18. hath the same signification; also, the Circumcision of Children on the eighth day. And its said in <HI>Iob</HI> 25.4. <HI>How can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean, that is born of a Woman?</HI> to wit, in the ordinary way of Generation. And here the natural state of man is declared, before his spiri∣tual Regeneration in Christ Jesus: and though that was said by <HI>Bildad,</HI> one of <HI>Iob</HI>'s Friends, yet it is confirmed by <HI>Iob</HI> himself, Chap. 14.4.
<PB N="89" REF="000472_0099_0FA674342353E260"/>
<HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</HI> But this Seed, or Principle of Sin and Cor∣ruption, is not charged or imputed unto men, until they joyn and consent unto it, and actually obey it, as is clear from <HI>Rom▪</HI> 5.13. <HI>For until the Law, Sin was in the World, but Sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</HI> Now, when is it that there is no <HI>law,</HI> but in the time of <HI>infancy,</HI> wherein Children are not capable of any Law, or of do∣ing Good or Evil, any more then when in the Womb? For until Children begin to have the use and exercise of their reasonable understand∣ing, so as to know the Right-hand from the Left (according to <HI>Ionah</HI> 4.11.) they cannot be un∣derstood to be under the Law. But to say, that any Infants are eternally damned for that first Sin, and without any actual Sin, or Transgres∣gression of theirs committed in their own Body, is expresly contrary to Scripture, that saith, <HI>The Soul that sinneth shall dye; and every one shall re∣ceive according to the Deeds done in the Body, good or evil; and he that soweth to the Flesh, shall reap Corruption, as he that soweth to the Spirit shall reap Corruption, and Life eternal.</HI> And therefore none shall finally perish, or be lost, for that first Sin, according to Scripture, but for their actu∣al Disobedience here in this world, and their final Unbelief and Impenitency. For as concern∣ing the Judgment and Punishment of the first Sin, it was immediatly inflicted after the Fall, to wit, the Death of all in <HI>Adam.</HI> But Christ the second
<PB N="90" REF="000472_0100_0FA67434DD8E8740"/>
<HI>Adam,</HI> by his death, for all that dyed in <HI>Adam,</HI> doth give unto all his free Gift, that cometh up∣on all unto Justification of Life; and thus the Plaister is as broad as the Sore, and the Medi∣cine as universal as the Disease; and it is not simply the Sin▪ or Disease, but the refusing and rejecting the Medicine and Physician, that is the cause of any mans final destruction. And how, or in what manner <HI>Adam</HI>'s Children and Poste∣rity were concerned in that first Sin, whether only by <HI>Imputation,</HI> as some say, or by <HI>real Par∣ticipation,</HI> as others say, the Wise in heart may easily judge: Let it suffice at present, to say, that <HI>Adam's</HI> Children, being his Branches, and he their Root, they do really partake with him both in the defilement, and also in the promised Seed, in order to their Restoration; for when God said to <HI>Adam, In the Day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely dye</HI>; His Children and Posterity were included. So when God said, <HI>I will put enmity between thee</HI> (to wit, the Serpent) <HI>and the Wo∣man, and between thy Seed and her Seed, it shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bruise thy Head, and thou shalt bruise his Heel.</HI> Their Children and Posterity are equally included; for <HI>Adam,</HI> after his Fall, being restored and made an holy Root, as is generally acknowledged, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Paul</HI> declareth, <HI>If the Root be Holy, so are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Branches; and if the first Fruit be holy, the Lum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is also holy.</HI> And as God promised unto <HI>Noah</HI> and to his Sons, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9.8. <HI>And behold I establis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Covenant with you, and with your Seed afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

And God renewed the Promise to <HI>Abraham,</HI> to make him the Father of all Nations and Families of the Earth, and that in him they all should be blessed, and in his Seed; not that this should be fulfilled by his being their Father, according to the Flesh, or in the way of carnal Generation; but through Christ, who is the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> by whom the Blessing and Grace of God was to come upon all. (<HI>Rom.</HI> 4.16, 17.) and in this respect <HI>Abraham</HI> is called the Father of us all, as it is written, <HI>I have made thee a Father of many Nations, before him whom he believed, God quickening the Dead, and calling the things which were not, as though they were</HI>; to wit, the Dead in <HI>Adam,</HI> are all in due time quickned by Christ, the promised Seed of

other elect Persons, who are uncapable of being outwardly called by the Word, that they are re∣generated, and saved by Christ through the Spi∣rit, who worketh when, where, and how he pleaseth; the same, these called <HI>Quakers</HI> say, concerning the honest and faithful <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who were obedient to the Light of Christ in them, and were not outwardly called by the Word, or by outward Preaching; yea, and were uncapable of being outwardly called, when living in such re∣mote Places and Ages of the world, where the outward Preaching never came within their reach. For as a deaf man is uncapable of hear∣ing a mans Voice, so is a man that hath his Hear∣ing, (to wit, the faculty or sense of Hearing) uncapable of hearing the Voice of a man, that is at a greater distance than his hearing can reach it. And seeing they plainly confess, that there are such elect Persons in the world, not only In∣fants, but these come to age, who are Regene∣rated, and saved by Christ through the Spirit, who worketh when, where, and how he plea∣seth, as their Words are, (and the Words are true, and a good use can be made of them against themselves, who have confessed them) then let them forever be ashamed to cry out any more against the honest People, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> for saying, These honest <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who have not heard of Christ outwardly preached unto them, belonging to God's Election, are saved by Christ, and regenerated through the Spirit of Christ.

And if the Spirit work when, where, and how he pleaseth, to wit, both in Infants, and persons at Age, who are not outwardly called by the Word, or uncapable of being so called, then let them recal and condemn their false Doctrine, that saith, <HI>God hath committed his Counsel wholly to Writing; and the former ways of God's revealing his Will unto his People are now ceased, and there is no new Revelation:</HI> as they have expresly, and without any reserve or exception, affirmed, <HI>cap.</HI> 1. <HI>sect.</HI> 1. and <HI>sect.</HI> 6.

<P N="7">7. But whether any are, or can be saved or justified, without the express Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified, and risen again, is one Question; and whether without all outward

hearing of Christ crucified, outwardly Preached unto them, is another Question: for without all outward preaching of men, the mystery of Christ crucified can be revealed, and preached inwardly to men by the Spirit of God, and by the same Spirit, Faith can be wrought in them by that inward hearing, as these men confess. And though it may seem hard and difficult, to prove that all honest <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who did by Na∣ture (to wit, by the Principle of the <HI>divine Na∣ture</HI> implanted into the true Nature of Men) the things contained in the Law, had that express Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified, and raised again; yet it is more hard and difficult unto them, who affirm they had it not, to prove it, seeing the Spirit, who worketh when, and where, and how he pleaseth, might reveal it unto them; and that they grant, <HI>the Spirit doth work in all elect Persons, who are not outwardly cal∣led by the Word, and doth regenerate and save them by Christ.</HI> And to the further clearing of this matter, we are to consider, that the Work of Salvation is not a thing that is commonly done in an instant, but hath its gradual Steps, its <HI>beginning, progress</HI> and <HI>finishing,</HI> even as Faith it self hath; for as at the first instant of a man's sincer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believing, he is entred into a state of Salvation, so as his Faith groweth, his Salva∣tion doth gradually encrease and grow with it, the which <HI>Salvation</HI> is not only a <HI>Salvation from W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath to come,</HI> or from Hell sire and torment,

And verse 10. <HI>Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired, and searched diligently, who prophecyed of the Grace that should come unto you.</HI> Verse 11. <HI>Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them did signifie, when it testified be∣fore-hand the Sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow.</HI> And Verse 13. <HI>Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the Grace that is to be brought unto you in the Revelation of Iesus Christ</HI> (so the Greek hath, viz. <HI>Enapokalepsei</HI>) And Phillip. 1.6. <HI>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it unto the Day of Iesus Christ.</HI> And as the Work of the outward Creation, is distinguished into six Dayes, and that a Day of Sabboth, or Rest, which is the per∣fection: So the Work of the inward Creation, which is the creating men anew in Christ Jesus, by way of Analogy, may be said to have its six Dayes, and then the spiritual Sabboth, or Rest, according to <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.9. <HI>There remaineth therefore
<PB N="110" REF="000472_0120_0FA674516F2AC888"/>
a Sabboth to the People of God.</HI> And verse 11. <HI>For me that is entred into his Rest, hath ceased from his own Works, as God did from his.</HI> And verse 11. <HI>Let us labour therefore to enter into that Rest,</HI> &amp;c. Where its plain , the Writer doth hint at the said Analogy. Now though it ought to be granted, that the Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified and raised again, doth belong to the finishing and perfecting of the Saints Salvation, yet it is most clear and plain from Scripture, that it doth not universally belong to the beginning of it. For we can prove most clearly from Scripture, that the good Work of God, even the Work of Sal∣vation was begun in them, who had not that Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified; as first, to instance in <HI>Nathaniel,</HI> of whom Christ gave a noble Testimony, <HI>Behold an</HI> Israelite <HI>in∣deed, in whom is no Guile,</HI> John 1.47. And yet at that time he had not Faith in Jesus of <HI>Naza∣reth,</HI> as being come in the Flesh, but reasoned or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uestioned, saving, <HI>Can any good thing come out of</HI> Nazareth? Philip <HI>saith unto him, Come and see,</HI> &amp;c▪ Next, to instance in the Disciples of Christ, who for sometime, after they had followed him, and that <HI>Peter</HI> had confessed to him, that he was the Son of God, and that Christ had told him, his Father had revealed it to him; yet the mystery of his Death and Resurrection was for all that hid from him, and the rest of them: For this, see <HI>Mark</HI> 9.31. <HI>For he taught his Disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the
<PB N="111" REF="000472_0121_0FA6745400AC9F68"/>
Hands of men, and they shall kill him, and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third Day.</HI> And verse 32. <HI>But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</HI> See again, <HI>Luke</HI> 9.43. But that instance of <HI>Cornelius</HI> is a most manifest and clear demonstration of this Truth: for this <HI>Cor∣nelius</HI> was a <HI>Gentile,</HI> and uncircumcised, and there∣fore no Proselite of the Covenant to be sure; and though some alledge, that he was a Proselite of the Gate (according to that distinction that was among the <HI>Iews</HI> of a two- fold sort of Pro∣selites, one of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> that received Cir∣cumcision and the Law, another of the <HI>Gate,</HI> that did not receive Circumcision) yet this is but barely alledged without all proof. But if he was a Proselite of the <HI>Gate,</HI> it is certain at that time, when the Angel was sent unto him, he had no express Knowledge, nor Faith of Christ cruci∣fied, for that was the thing, which <HI>Peter</HI> was sent to preach unto him, by hearing of which he was to receive the holy Ghost, and be saved; for the Angel told him, <HI>That</HI> Peter <HI>should speak Words to him, by which he &amp; all his House should be saved</HI>; see <HI>Acts</HI> 11.14. Now although at that time, when the Angel appeared unto him, <HI>Cornelius</HI> had no Know∣ledge nor Faith of Christ crucified, yet he was in a good estate; and well were it for many called <HI>Christians,</HI> that they were in as good estate as he then was in: When the Angel appeared to him, he told him, <HI>That his Prayers, and his Alms were come up for a memorial before God,</HI> Acts 10.4.
<PB N="112" REF="000472_0122_0FA674545842D890"/>
And it is said of him, verse 2. <HI>He was a devou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man, and one that feared God, with all his House, which gave much Alms to the People, and prayed unto God alway.</HI> And with respect to this, <HI>Peter</HI> began his Preaching, saying, <HI>Acts</HI> 10.34, 35. <HI>Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of Persons, but in every Nation he that feareth him, and worketh Righteousness,is accepted of him.</HI> Now who dare be so bold to say, <HI>Cornelius</HI> at this time had no real and true beginning of Salvation, or of saving Grace and Faith, before <HI>Peter</HI> did preach Christ crucified &amp; raised again unto him? For although <HI>Cornelius</HI> had not at that time Faith in Christ crucified, yet he had (without all que∣stion) Faith in God, and in the Word of God that was in his Heart, and that Word was Christ in him, though the Mystery of Christ was not fully revealed unto him at that time, and in that state he was accepted of God, &amp; yet not for his Works sake, but for Christ. And therefore, men may have a beginning of true Faith, and of a true Work of Salvation begun in them, when the Mystery of Christ crucified, and raised again, is not revealed unto them. For that Mystery (being so great as it is) was not in that Day, to wit, before Christ came and suffered in the Flesh, preached, as one of the first and most necessary things to be first known and believed, as with∣out the Faith and Knowledge of which no man could be in any degree blessed, otherwise, when Christ began to Preach, he would have preached

it as one of the first things; and when he sent his Disciples to preach the Gospel, before he suf∣fered Death, he would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ven them an ex∣press Commission to preach it to all People, how he was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be crucified, and raised again the third day, but the Mystery of it at that time they knew not, and therefore could not preach it then: Nor did he preach it himself, when he be∣gan his Ministry, nor for a considerable time af∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erwards, until the time drew near that he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o suffer.

And therefore it may be very safely concluded, that the express Kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wledge and Faith of Christ cru∣cified, is not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bsolute and indispensible neces∣sity (especially where it hath not been preached, nor revealed) unto the beginning of a man's Salvation, although it is really of absolute and indispensible necessity unto the finishing and per∣fecting

of it, because, as hath been already said, our inward renewing unto God, when perfected, in us, is a renewing us perfectly, and not in part only, into the Image of God; and a part of that perfect Image, is the perfect Knowledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God, and of Jesus Christ, whom to know is Life Eter∣nal; and that perfect Knowledge requireth men to know him, as he came in the Flesh, and died, and rose again, which is that <HI>great Mystery of Godliness,</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI> called it, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16. But if these men, who own that said Confession of Faith, enquire, whether all these honest <HI>Gentiles</HI> that lived in the world, or do now live in the world, who have not had Christ crucified, out∣wardly preached unto them, but were diligent to frame their Lives according to the Light that was in them, died in a state of Salvation? I say, yea, they did; and this I may the rather say according to their own Doctrine. For what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they had not the perfect Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified, when they lived? yet they might have it at their Death, to wit, in the pas∣sing through the Valley of the shadow of Death, according to <HI>Psal.</HI> 23.4.

going down to the Pit; I have found a Ransom, or Attonement</HI>; see the <HI>Hebr.</HI> or Margine of the <HI>English</HI> Bible. Or if I should say, they receive this perfect Knowledge of Christ after Death, it is according to your Doctrine, who say, <HI>The Souls of the Righteous (generally</HI> or <HI>universally) af∣ter Death,</HI> (note, <HI>after Death) being then made perfect in Holiness, are received into the highest Heavens,</HI> &amp;c.

<P N="8">8. And as concerning the diversity of the Dis∣pensations of the divine Grace given unto men,
<PB N="116" REF="000472_0126_0FA6745C2DDD41B8"/>
in the several Ages and Places of the world, ac∣cording to the several States▪ and Capacities of men in the world, the Scriptures testimony is very plain and clear, which declareth both of the manifold Grace, and manifold Wisdom of God, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.10. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3. And <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.10. <HI>Paul</HI> mentioneth the Dispensation of the fulness of time, as being the greatest, with respect to the fore-going Dispensations, before that fulness of time came, and they may be distinguished, as <HI>Paul</HI> doth distinguish them very plainly into three, to wit, <HI>Diversity of Operations, but one God; and diversity of Administrations, but one Lord; and diversity of Gifts, but one Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> 1 Cor. 12.4, 5, 6. The operations belonging to the Law, as inwardly dispensed, the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ministrations to the Prophets, and to Christ's coming in the Flesh, and to the Apostles, their Preaching, both before Christ was crucified, and rose again, and afterwards the Gifts to the holy Spirit, as they were the effect, and fruit of the Apostles Preach∣ing, and the end of it; And according to the Scripture, the first is that divine Dispensation proper to Men, as Children, in the Knowledge of God, and in Virtue; the second, to that which is proper to Men, as in Youth, or middle Age; the third as proper to Men of full, or ripe Age. And each of these Dispensation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be said to have their proper and peculiar inward <HI>Baptism,</HI> or <HI>spiritual Washing</HI>; the first being the Baptism of the Father, the second being the Baptism both
<PB N="117" REF="000472_0127_0FA6745ED3D61830"/>
of the Father, and of the Son; the third being the Baptism of the Father; the Son, and the holy Ghost, which Christ commanded his Disciples to administer, after he rose from the dead, and gave the holy Ghost, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19. which is not to be so understood, as if the three; to wit, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, did not work together in all these three Dispensations; for certainly they did; but because in the first Dispensation, God only was known as Creator, and Father of all mankind, in the second, both the Father and the Son were known, and in the third, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost are known, and the Mystery of the three, and of the more abundant divine Grace that accom∣panieth this Knowledge, largely opened and revealed. And though I say the first belonged to the Law, as inwardly dispensed, yet that very Dispensation of the Law was not meerly Legal, but had Grace and Mercy mixed with it: For no Dispensation, without the Grace and Mercy of God, could have been in any respect serviceable unto men; therefore the Law, both as outward∣ly and inwardly administred, had always some measure of divine Grace mixed with it; and therefore in the second Commandment, the sub∣stance of all the Ten Commandments, being commonly acknowledged to have been delivered by God himself to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who had not the written Law, God did reveal himself <HI>to be a gra∣cious and merciful God, visiting the Iniquities of the
<PB N="118" REF="000472_0128_0FA6745EE4FE0FF0"/>
Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation, but showing Mercy to Thousands of them that love him, and keep his Commandments.</HI> And as I have already proved from the express Testimony of the holy Scripture, by the Obedi∣ence of one, to wit, the Lord Jesus, who dyed for all, the free Gift and Grace of God is come upon all unto Justification of Life, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.18. And Christ himself is the Mystery hid in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> being that <HI>Word of Faith</HI> which <HI>Moses</HI> preached in the <HI>Iews,</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> in the <HI>Romans,</HI> Chap. 10.</P>
<P N="9">9. And since it is so, that Christ is really that Light that doth lighten the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and is Light in them, who have not heard him outwardly preached unto them it is no less than real Blas∣phemy (though pardonable upon Repentance) to say, as the <HI>Presbyterean</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> Tea∣chers of both Old and <HI>New-England</HI> have said in their Confession of Faith, <HI>That the Light in men,</HI> (which they call, the Light of Nature) <HI>that doth so far manifest the Goodness, Wisdom and Power of God, as to leave men inexcusable, yet is not sufficient to give that Knowledge of God, which is necessary unto Salvation</HI>; as they expresly affirm <HI>cap.</HI> 1. <HI>sect.</HI> 1. And <HI>cap.</HI> 10. <HI>sect.</HI> 4. they say ex∣presly, <HI>Men not professing the Christian Religion</HI> (to wit, the Faith of Christ's Death and Resur∣rection) <HI>cannot be saved, be they never so diligen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to frame their Lives according to the Light that is in them</HI>; Which here again they call <HI>the Light of Nature.</HI> And as for the expression, <HI>the Light

of Nature,</HI> it may be safely enough owned (in a true Scripture sense) though not in the sense of them, who do so call it. For as Christ is called the <HI>Light of men</HI> in Scripture, (<HI>Iohn</HI> 1.4. <HI>In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men</HI>) so he may be very well called the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> to wit, lightning the dark Nature of man; and not only so, but quickning and sanctifying Na∣ture in all men, who joyn thereunto, and the <HI>Word of God in the Heart, Iames</HI> calleth it, <HI>Ton Ephuton Logon,</HI> the innate Word, <HI>i. e.</HI> put into the Nature of men, which is able to save their Souls. But the <HI>Presbyterean</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> Teachers of Old and <HI>New-England,</HI> by the <HI>Light of Nature,</HI> mean only that it is some natural Fa∣culty of man's Soul, as to say, his natural Under∣standing, or his natural Mind &amp; Conscience: And according to them, there is no other Light, or Principle of Knowledge or Virtue in man, gene∣rally and universally, nay, not in any who pro∣fess not the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> though ever so diligent to frame their Lives according to the Light that is in them, as they expresly affirm; and yet in manifest Contradiction to their own Doctrine, they have confessed, <HI>That Persons elected, are saved by Christ, and regenerated through the Spirit, who are uncapable of being outwardly called by the Word,</HI> cap. 10. sect. 3.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Concerning Iustification, and the Nature of true Faith, whether Assurance is of the Nature of it.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHen the Scripture saith, <HI>God justi∣fieth the Vngodly,</HI> Rom. 4.5. It is not to be understood that he doth justifie them in their Ungodliness, but from it; as the like man∣ner of Speech is used, <HI>Acts</HI> 13.39. <HI>And by him
<PB N="124" REF="000472_0134_0FA674635C2D3220"/>
all that believe, are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the Law of</HI> Moses. For seeing, according to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law of God, <HI>He that justifieth the Wicked is an Abomination to the Lord,</HI> Prov. 17.15. God himself can do no such thing, as to justifie a wicked or ungodly man in his Ungodliness.</P>
<P N="2">2. As it is only the true Believer, who hath Faith in Christ Jesus, whom God justifieth; so it is only he who is truly sanctified, and regene∣rated or born again of the Spirit of God, whom God doth justifie, who are called the Seed of <HI>Israel,</HI> Isa. 45.25. <HI>In the Lord shall all the Seed of</HI> Israel <HI>be justified, and shall glory.</HI> For as a Rich man, when he dyeth by his Will or Testament, leaveth his Goods or Riches not to Strangers, but to his own Kindred, as his Brethren, or Children, and to his Wife; so o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Lord Jesus Christ hath left by his Will and Testament, when he dyed, his Spiritual Goods, to wit, <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mission of Sin, Iustification, Adoption</HI> and <HI>Eternal Life,</HI> only to his true spiritual Kindred, to wit, his Brethren, who are born from Above, and spi∣ritually related unto him, who are the true Chil∣dren of God, by spiritual Regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghost, and who are his true Church, and Body, and of his Flesh and Bones, according to <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.30.</P>
<P N="3">3. And therefore not only <HI>Faith,</HI> but true inward <HI>Sanctification,</HI> and a thorow inward renewing into the Image of God, and Conformity of the whole
<PB N="125" REF="000472_0135_0FA674641B12EC68"/>
man, unto the Image of the Son of God, is a Condition and Qualification necessarily required, in order unto mens being perfectly justified in the sight of God; and as no man is justified, but who is sanctified, so no man is any more, or further justified than he is sanctified.</P>
<P N="4">4. According unto which, God doth justifie men, not only by Faith in Christ, but by a real inward Righteousness or Holiness, which he doth beget in them by his holy Spirit, and not only <HI>Faith,</HI> but <HI>Love, Hope, true Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Holiness, Meekness, Temperance</HI> and <HI>Humility,</HI> and all other Evangelical Virtues, and Fruits of the holy Spirit, are the Instruments and Means whereby men obtain free Justification through Christ Jesus, and whereby they are enabled, and fitted or qualified to apply Christ Jesus, and his Righteousness unto them, so as to have the same imputed unto them, and made theirs, to wit, Christ, and all his spiritual Blessings, Gifts and Benefits, and his Death, and Sufferings, and Obedience, with all the blessed Effects and Fruits of it. For as a Line that is straight, cannot be applyed unto another Line that is crooked, but unto a Line that is straight; so cannot the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Righteousness of God, be applyed unto men for Justification, unles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these men be made righteous, as he is in likeness, or conformity unto him, although not equal un∣to him: And therefore <HI>Iohn</HI> did seasonably give the warning and caution, fore-seeing that many
<PB N="126" REF="000472_0136_0FA67467A3625598"/>
would claim to be righteous, or justified, when they were not really doers or workers of Righte∣ousness, 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.7. <HI>Little Children, let no man deceive you; he that doth Righteousness, is righteous, even as he is righteous.</HI> And the same <HI>Iohn</HI> said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.14. <HI>Blessed are they that do his Command∣ments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life,</HI> &amp;c. Which is equivelent to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being justified, seeing Justification doth include in its Nature, a Right, or Interest in Christ, who is that Tree of Life.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is therefore a gross Error, and a false and Antichristian Doctrine, in these Faith-pub∣lishers at <HI>Westminster,</HI> espoused by the <HI>Presbyte∣rean</HI> and <HI>Independant</HI> Teachers in <HI>New-England, That God doth justifie men, not by infusing Righte∣ousness into them, but by pardoning their Sins, and accepting them as righteous,</HI> &amp;c. cap. 11. sect. 1, 2. And also, that, they say, <HI>Faith receiving and resting on Christ, and his Righteousness, is the alone Instru∣ment of Iustification,</HI> is another great Error. For as <HI>Faith</HI> may well be compared to one Hand of the Soul, whereby it receiveth and embraceth the Lord Jesus Christ; so <HI>Love,</HI> whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h is an in∣ward Evangelical Grace and Virtue, that is shed abroad or infused into the Soul, by the holy Ghost, may be compared to another H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d and Arm, whereby it doth receive and embrace him. And all the inward Evangelical divine Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tues and Graces that are wrought and begot in the Soul, by the holy Spirit of Christ, are, so to speak, as

For seeing all men generally have sinned, no mans best Obedi∣ence for Sin formerly committed, can be a Ransom unto God, but Christ alone is the Ran∣som, even he who was crucified, and rose again, (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18.) <HI>The I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st having suffered for the Vnjust, that he might bring us unto God.</HI> And as no man c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n redeem the Soul of his Brother, so nor can he redeem his own Soul; <HI>For the Redemp∣tion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul is precious, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> forever,</HI> Psal. 49.8. <HI>viz.</HI> to be the Work of man, but it is only and alone the Work of him, who is both God and Man, according to verse 15. <HI>But Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will redeem my Soul from the Power of the Grave,

<P N="7">7. And seeing Remission and Pardon of Sin for Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sake, is a part or branch of <HI>Iustification,</HI> as these Faith-publishers do acknowledge, and that it is of such necessity, that none may expect pardon without it, as they confess, <HI>cap.</HI> 15. <HI>sect.</HI> 3. Is it not very manifest, by their own Confession (though in plain contradiction to their own Doctrine) that Repentance is a neces∣sary Instrument and Condition whereby to obtain Justification. And indeed the Scripture layeth equal weight upon Repentance and Conversion, as it doth upon Faith, in order to obtain Remis∣sion or Pardon of Sins, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.19. <HI>Repent ye there∣fore, and be converted, that your Sins may be blot∣ted out.</HI> Acts 26.18. <HI>To turn them from Darkness unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they may receive Forgiveness of Sins,</HI> &amp;c. And when the Scripture saith, <HI>Titus</HI> 3.5. <HI>Not by Works of Righteousness, which we have done, but according to his Mercy he saved us.</HI> It is clear, that Works before, or without true Faith are understood, and not the inward Work of San∣ctification, as is clear from the following Words, <HI>by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghost.</HI> And if the real inward Work of <HI>San∣ctification</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> had not been necessary to Salvation, the Scripture would not have said,
<PB N="130" REF="000472_0140_0FA67471D3E60E20"/>
<HI>Work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling: And if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the Deeds of the Body, ye shall live.</HI> And therefore when <HI>Paul</HI> doth so earnestly plead that men are not justified by the Works of the Law, it is evident, he doth only exclude these legal Performances an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ob∣servations that the <HI>Iews</HI> rested in, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not Faith in Christ. And that no Works, however so good or holy, being performed by men, ought to be rested in, as a Foundation or ground of Ju∣stification, for that were to exclude Christ, and make his Death of no effect. And again, when <HI>Iames</HI> doth plead so earnestly, that <HI>men are justi∣fied by Works, and not by Faith only,</HI> giving an in∣stance in <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Rahab,</HI> he only placeth Faith and Works together (<HI>viz.</HI> such Works as accompany true Faith, and work together with it) as necessary Instruments and Conditions, whereby to obtain Justification, but not to be the Foundation thereof.</P>
<P N="8">8. And whereas <HI>Paul</HI> generally so much useth that manner of Speech, of <HI>Iustification by Faith,</HI> it is manifest that by Faith, he doth not mean only that single Virtue called <HI>Faith,</HI> but as by way of <HI>Synerdocle,</HI> the most eminent, or noted part, is put for the whole, as when in Scripture as well as in common Speech, the Head of a man is put for the whole man, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.4. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 17.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Even so by Faith, the Apostle in these places doth mean the whole complex or systeme, or in∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re body of the Evangelical Virtue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Graces,
<PB N="131" REF="000472_0141_0FA6747299D1B5F0"/>
whereof Faith is as it were the Head, and is first in order of Nature, at least, in respect of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other, and sometimes also by Faith he under∣standeth, the whole Evangelical Dispensation and Doctrine, as especially in that noted place, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.23. <HI>But before FAITH came, we were kept under the Law,</HI> &amp;c. And verse 5. <HI>But after that FAITH is come,</HI> &amp;c. Where certainly <HI>Paul</HI> doth not mean only that single Virtue, called <HI>Faith,</HI> but the whole Evangelical Dispensation, with all the spiritual Gifts and Graces of it. And again, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</HI> which hath the same signification. And thus in common Speech among <HI>Christians,</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Writers, the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith doth signifie the whole <HI>Christian</HI> Religion and Obedience; and so Unbelief in Scripture is put for all other Sin that men generally are under, before they be∣lieve, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.32.</P>
<P N="9">9. True Faith in Christ Jesus, (on whom alone the Soul resteth, as on the true Foundation, for Ju∣stification, and all other divine and spiritual <HI>gifts</HI> &amp; <HI>blessings</HI>) is not only a believing in him, as he is the <HI>Word,</HI> which was in the beginning with God, and is God, by whom all things were made, and which was in all the Prophets, and faithful and holy men in all Ages, but as the same Word did take Flesh, and was God manifest in the Flesh, ju∣stified in the Spirit, &amp;c. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16. which <HI>Paul</HI> called, <HI>The great Mystery of Godliness,</HI> to
<PB N="132" REF="000472_0142_0FA6747320A80BE0"/>
wit, <HI>Christ crucified, and risen again, made of a Woman, made under the Law, the Son of God, that did come in the likeness of sinful Flesh, made like un∣to us in all things Sin excepted; who being in the form of God, and thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself, and took upon him the form of a Servant; and was found in the true Form and Nature of a Man, the Seed of</HI> Abraham <HI>and</HI> David, <HI>conceived by the holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>at</HI> Bethlem, <HI>in the Land of</HI> Judah. And thus the true Faith doth not divide Christ, but receiveth him, and joyneth the Soul unto him intirely, to wit, the whole and intire Christ, both as he did come outwardly in the Flesh, and as he did, and doth inwardly come in the Spirit; and as the said true Faith doth not divide him, so nor doth it divide his Offices, but taketh or receiveth him in all his Offices, as <HI>King, Priest</HI> and <HI>Prophet, Shepherd, Physitian, Husband,</HI> &amp;c. And as he is called (<HI>Ierm.</HI> 23.6.) <HI>The Lord our Righteousness,</HI> in Scripture; so as none can have him to be their Righteousness and Justifi∣cation, but who have him to be their Lord, King and Ruler in them, and their Sanctification, Wisdom and Redemption. And thus every tru∣ly believing Soul, is as the true Mother of the Child, who would not have the Child divided; but she who was not the true Mother of the Child, she would have the Child divided; a true Figure of all false <HI>Christians,</HI> who would have Christ divided, and say, <HI>They believe in Christ

without them,</HI> but do not believe and recceive Christ within them, as God the Father doth in∣wardly reveal him; or as <HI>Ranters,</HI> and other high Notionists, who pretend to believe in Christ, as he is the Word and Light in them, but slight and blaspheme against Christ that was crucified without them. Whereas the true Be∣liever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth both believe in Christ, and receive Christ, as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame in the Flesh, and was crucified for our Sins, &amp; rose &amp; ascended into Heaven, &amp; is now in Heaven glorified, in the intire and per∣fect Nature of man, in Soul and Body, appear∣ing in the presence of God for us, our Advocate with the Fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and also doth believe in him, and receive him spiritually, to live and dwell in his Heart, as he is the Lord that Spirit, and the second <HI>Adam,</HI> or heavenly Man, the quickning Spirit, who is the true spiritual Meat and Drink to every believing Soul, even as Christ said, <HI>I am the true Bread of Life, he that eateth me, shall live by me.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. And this true Faith, in the least true mea∣sure o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, as it is in act or exercise, hath assu∣rance in it, of the Love and Mercy of God re∣vealed in Christ Jesus; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rue infallible Assurance is of the very Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of true Faith, as it is exercised on Christ, its true and proper Object and Foundation, and upon the Love and Mercy of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Father revealed in Christ; hence <HI>Paul</HI> said; <HI>That his Gospel came un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o these to whom he preached, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Speech only, but

But without divine inward Revelation, which begetteth Assurance, there is no true Faith, but only Opinion, or Conjecture, seeing there is no midst betwixt Assurance and Opinion, or Con∣jecture; and therefore these Faith-publishers, have denyed the true Faith of God's Elect, when they say, <HI>It may be without Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance, and that infallible Assurance doth not belong so to the essence of Faith, but that a true Believer may wait long, and Conflict with many Difficulties, before he be par∣taker of it</HI>; see Chap. 18. Sect. 3. And it is yet as strange, that they affirm, <HI>That a man without divine new Revelation</HI> (which here they call <HI>Ex∣traordinary,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hough in their first Chapter, they have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nyed all new divine Revelation, even since the Apostles) <HI>can be infallibly assured, that he is in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour with God</HI>: the which Assurance they seem to ground upon the <HI>inward Evidences of the Graces of God, and the Testimony of the Spirit of Adoption, witnessing with our Spirits that

we are the Children of God.</HI> But whether this be not a manifest Contradiction, one while to assert the nece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sity of the inward Evidence of Grace, and the Testimony of the Spirit witnessing with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God; and another while, yea, with the same Breath, to deny all inward Revelation of the Spirit; and to say, <HI>The Spirit worketh only effectively, and not objectively, and therefore is only</HI> medium incogni∣tum assentiend, to wit, an unknown Principle of assenting, let the wise in heart consider and judge. For seeing no place of Scripture, telleth us, that we have these infallible marks of God's Children, and yet the Spirit doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell, or witness it, to or together with our Spirits; this certainly is <HI>a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovum effatum,</HI> or new Truth, or saying, no where either expresly or consequentially con∣tained in the Scripture; or if they say it is con∣tained in Scripture, at least consequentially, to wit, that <HI>I.D.</HI> or <HI>I.

It is wonderful, that these men have such inve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erat Prejudice against divine inward Revelation, that rather than assent to so blessed and comfor∣table Doctrine, they will run into the most pal∣pable Non-sence and Contradiction. And when they start from the Testimony of the Spirit, as implying divine inward Revelation, they run at last to the Testimony of a man's own Heart and Conscience, not well considering that the bare
<PB N="136" REF="000472_0146_0FA674767540F328"/>
Testimony of a man's Heart and Conscience can∣not infallibly assure him, or if it could, it is no divine Testimony, but only human, and there∣fore no true object of divine Faith.</P>
<P N="11">11. But as the least true measure of Faith, as it is lively acted or exercised upon Christ in∣wardly revealed, hath an infallible Assurance in it; so this Assurance doth only reach to the pre∣sent state of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aithfulness, as it is continued in, until it please God to reveal to the Soul, that it shall be preserved faithful to the last, which so high degree of Assurance, many true Belie∣vers have not attained unto, God reserving that to such as he counteth worthy to reveal the same. But the first degree of Assurance, to wit, whereby the Soul is infallibly assured, that for the present, it is in the way and state of Salva∣tion, and as it abideth, and continueth to walk in that living Way and Path it hath begun in, it shall be eternally saved, is a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lessed and com∣fortable degree, and such as for which every Soul that hath it, has great cause to praise God. Nor doth this degree of Assurance hinder, but that the Enemy of the Soul's peace may raise up Clouds and Fogs of doubting and unbelief, which may for some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime obscure that Assurance, if the Soul be not duely watchful, and diligent to re∣tain the same.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Whether true beginnings of Sanctification can be fallen from totally? And whether it is true, that no man by any Grace of God given him, or to be given him in this Life, can perfectly keep the Com∣mandments of God, but doth daily break them, in Thought, Word and Deed?</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THat real and true beginnings of <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Sanctification,</HI> or <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real Righte∣ousness</HI> may be fallen from, is clear from many Testimonies of the holy Scripture, especially <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Where, <HI>first,</HI> is described the state of some, who do fall away, what it was before they so do; as 1<HI>st,</HI> that they were enlightned, so as to have tasted of the heavenly Gift; 2<HI>dly,</HI> to have been made partakers of the holy Ghost; 3<HI>dly,</HI> to have tasted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come; and surely, all this could not be without some real beginning of <HI>true Sanctification. Se∣condly,</HI> The state of such is described, when, or after they do so fall away, that <HI>They crucifie to themselves the Son of God a fresh, and put him to an open shame</HI>; and also the great danger they are in; so that it is impossible to renew them again unto Repentance: But how far this Impossibi∣lity doth extend, whether to a simple Impossi∣bility, or only in some respect, is not the present business to determine, &amp; to the same purpose the

Author writeth, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.26, 27, 28. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> Chap. 11. doth not only affirm, That many <HI>Iews</HI> and People of <HI>Israel,</HI> who were the natural Branches, were broken off from the Root, (which Root is Christ) by unbelief, but wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neth the be∣lieving <HI>Gentiles,</HI> of their great danger, also to be cut off, if they did not keep in holy fear and watchfuln<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, see Verse 20.21, 22. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Apostles, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iude</HI> set before the <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> the fearful Examples of the fallen Angels, &amp; of the old World, and also of the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> who were saved out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to be a warning and caution unto them, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they should fall after the same manner. Now the fall o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Angels▪ was a total falling away, and so wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that of <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness, who thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they did eat that spiritual Meat, and drink tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spiritual Drink, to wit, the Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ, as <HI>Paul</HI> ex¦presly declared, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. yet were over thrown in the Wilderness for their <HI>Idolatry, For¦nication,</HI> and other great Sins, they were de¦stroyed of the Destroyer; so that in that day God did swear against them, they should no enter into his Rest; see 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. throughout compared with <HI>Iude,</HI> and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. throughout <HI>Fifthly,</HI> The Parable of the Seed that was sow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the stony and thorny Ground, that sprang up and afterwards withered, did signifie (as Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expresly did expound it) some that believed so

a time, and afterwards did fall away. And this Faith was not altogether a false Faith, otherwise it had not been blame-worthy in them, to have left it, or cast it away; for it is rather com∣mendable, than reproveable, to cast away what is false and hypocritical, and not real: Nor doth it argue, that their Faith was not true or real, that it sprang up in the stony and thorny Ground. For many that are real and sincere Believers, at there first believing, feel their Hearts to be both stony and thorny Ground, and yet with diligence and labour, through the Pow∣er and Grace of God, come to get their Hearts in process of time, so changed and renewed, that they become good Ground, and bring forth good Fruit to the end: so the more stony and thorny that the Heart is, the more labour is to be used to make it good, which by the Grace of God may well be done. <HI>Sixt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly,</HI> The Parable of the ten Virgins, five whereof were foolish, hath the same signification, for these five foolish Virgins had some Oyl in their Lamps, but not being wise to get enough, they spent what they had, and so their Lamps went out; for though they had Oyl in their Lamps, (otherwise their Lamps could not have gone out) yet they had not in their Vessels, as the wise Virgins had, and so when they were called at midnight, to meet the Bride-groom, they had no Oyl at all, nei∣ther in their Lamps, or Vessels; see <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. from Vers. 1. to 12. <HI>Seventhly,</HI> It is expresly said,

But to say, as these Faith-publishers say and affirm, That <HI>no men once sanctified in the least measure, can fall totally from their Sanctification, though committing Murder and Adultery as wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the case of</HI> David (see Cap. 17. Sect. 1. and Cap. 11.5. of their Confession) <HI>nor from their Iustifi∣cation,</HI> is not only a most false and pernicious Doctrine, but a most wonderful piece of Con∣fusion. For if he that is both Murderer and A∣dulterer in the very act, and remaining in that or these Sins, without Repentance for some time, are really Saints, and justified; then who may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said not to be Saints? or what difference is there betwixt the Saints, and no Saints, betwixt the Godly and the Wicked, good men and evil men If a man that is both Murderer and Adulterer, be a real Saint, and a justified man, then the worst of men may generally believe they are true and

<HI>David</HI> was well sensible, when, after God was pleased spiritually to visit and awaken him again, he prayed unto God, saying, <HI>Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me,</HI> Psal. 51.10. And thus according to these false Teachers, there is no mortal Sin, that any Soul once quickned in the least degree, can commit; and the same Sin that is mortal in the unbeliever▪ is not mortal in him that once was a believer, as <HI>Murder, Adultery,</HI> yea, <HI>Incest,</HI> or worse, is no mortal Sin, in one, and yet is a mortal Sin in the other. Doth not this loose the reins to all sort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Wickedness, and make God a respecter o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Persons, and Faith a sort of Proof, that though men, once having Faith, commit the worst sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Sins, as <HI>Murder, Adultery, Incest, Rapine</HI> yet their Faith is a sort of proof unto them, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> none of these Sins doth or can kill them?

And why, ye estimate your Church more holy then the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>? But is not your Church and Doctrine in this respect much more unholy? For the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> saith, <HI>All gross, or great Sins, as Fornication, Adultery, Murder, and the like, are re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly mortal Sins, in all that commit them, without respect of Persons; and whoever commit such Sins are fallen from their state in Grace.</HI> And so saith the Scripture, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.9, 10. <HI>Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>shall inherit the King∣dom of God.</HI> The which Kingdom of God is a state of Grace, as well as of Glory. And here we see the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> maketh no distinction be∣twixt one that hath formerly believed, and one that hath not believed, but without distinction, or respect of Persons, he concludeth in general against them all, that while such, they cannot in∣herit the Kingdom of God. But according to this <HI>Westminster</HI> and <HI>New-England</HI> Confession of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, Fornicators, and Murderers, and Adul∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erers, that have at any time once believed, do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till inherit the Kingdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God, to wit, a state of Grace, which is, in a true sence, the Kingdom of God, and is frequently so called in Scripture. And thus it doth most evidently appear, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hei <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Doctrine in this perticular is Antichristian, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd contrary to the Doctrine of the holy Scrip∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures. And to say, that Murder or Adultery in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im that hath once truly believed, is not a mortal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r killing Sin, but is a mortal Sin in him that hath

<P N="2">2. And as for the Scriptures, they bring in their said Confession, to prove their false Do∣ctrine, let them be impartially examined, and they will be found to prove no such thing; some of them being expresly conditional, as that in 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>For if ye do these things, ye shall never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all.</HI> Here it is only promised conditionally, but not absolutely, that they shall not fall, to wit, <HI>if they give all diligence to add to their Faith Virtue,</HI> &amp;c.

wit, a <HI>hainous Sin,</HI> or <HI>Crime,</HI> which <HI>Iohn</HI> call∣eth, <HI>A Sin unto Death,</HI> 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 5.16, 17. And here he distinguisheth betwixt a Sin unto Death, and a Sin that is not unto Death, <HI>viz.</HI> that doth not totally slay the Soul's Life, but woundeth it, and killeth only in part, as some small wandring or evagation of mind, or giving way (through slackning the Watch) unto a vain Thought, for some small time; something of Anger, or Passion, upon some suddain occasion; something of glo∣rying in Sufferings, or Services, or K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wledge, or in spiritual Attainments; something of too forward and hasty Zeal, and divers like suddain Motions, that a gracious and godly Soul may be tryed and afflicted with, that are as Thorns in the Flesh, and do wound &amp; afflict the Soul, but are not suffered to proceed so far, as to carry it forth in∣to any secret gross Crime, either inwardly in the Heart, or outwardly in Word or De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Hence both in the Old, and New-Testament, we find divers kinds and degrees of Sin, more or less hainous, and these expressed by div<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs both <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Words: the more hai∣nous are called, <HI>Iniquities, Vngodliness, Impiety, Vnrighteousness, Perverseness, Rebellion</HI>; and others of an inferior Nature, are called <HI>Tres∣passes, Debts, Omissions, Faults,</HI> &amp;c. Now the least kind or degree of Sin doth weaken and wound, yea, kill in part the Soul's spiritual Life, as when in the natural Body some Member is mortally wounded, and killed, and yet the whole
<PB N="146" REF="000472_0156_0FA674852D70C448"/>
Person is not slain thereby; but all gross Sins, such as <HI>Fornication, Adultery, Murder, Theft, Robbery,</HI> &amp;c. make havock, waste and destroy the Soul's Life, and kill the whole man, whom, notwithstanding, God in his infinite mercy may and doth, at times, restore. For we read of no Sin unpardonable, but that of Blasphemy against the holy Ghost, and doing despite to the Spirit of Grace. And such who are come to this noble degree and state of <HI>Sanctification,</HI> are describ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.2, 3. <HI>Blessed are they that keep his Testimonies, and that seek him with the whole Heart, they also do no Iniquity, they walk in his wayes.</HI> And such have their Calling and E∣lection made sure unto them; such are not meerly or barely Servants nor Sons of the Bond-woman, but Sons of the Free-woman, and throughly re∣newed &amp; born of God, <HI>who doth not commit Sin, for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remaineth in them,</HI> 1 John 3.9. <HI>And he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</HI> For indeed to him that is born of God, Sin is contrary to his new Nature, as much as Holiness or Righte∣ousness is contrary to the Devil's Nature, or as one contrary thing can be to another, as it is contrary to a Fish to live on dry Land, or for a Sheep or Dove to live in the bottom of the Seas. But who-ever commit any gross thing, as <HI>For∣nication, Murder, Adultery, Theft, Robbery, Per∣jury,</HI> &amp;c. never arrived to this pure and perfect state of Sonship, were but Servants, and not purely and perfectly Sons; and yet the state of
<PB N="147" REF="000472_0157_0FA67487EFDD3450"/>
the Servant is a true and good state in its place, and as faithfully improved, leadeth on infallibly to the state of pure and perfect Sonship; and such who have attained to this pure and perfect state of Sonship, can say with <HI>Paul,</HI> Gal. 4.31. <HI>So then Brethren, we are not Children of the Bond-woman, but of the Free.</HI> And with <HI>Iohn,</HI> 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 2.19. <HI>They</HI> (to wit, such who were not true Sons, but at best only Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vants) <HI>went out from us, but they were not of us,</HI> &amp;c. To wit, Sons and Children of the Free-woman, or the Children of the New Covenant, they were only of <HI>Hagar,</HI> that signifieth the Law, or first Covenant. And to conclude, the Righteousness and Holiness of the first Covenant, may be totally fallen from, such as was that of the Angels, who fell, and <HI>Adam</HI> the first man, he fell totally, and so may they who are not further advanced, then to bear the Image of him, the earthly <HI>Adam</HI>; but the Righteousness and Holiness of the New Covenant, (such as they attain unto, who are throughly born of God, and are made over∣comers and Conquerors, yea, <HI>more then Conque∣ror<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as the Scripture phraseth it, and are made conform to the Image of Christ, the second <HI>Adam,</HI> the Lord from Heaven, heavenly) can∣not be fallen from, or lost; such having over∣come, are made Pillars in the House of God, so as no more to go out, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

stedfastness in Holiness and Righteousness. But who are thus far advanced, and who are not, al∣though infallible Signs and Marks of distinction may be given of these two so differing states, God only infallibly knoweth, and they to whom he doth reveal it: for it is God that must make known by the inward Revelation of his holy Spirit, who hath these marks, otherwise men may presume to have them, when they have them not. And of these infallible Signs and Marks, some of them are, to <HI>love God with the whole Heart,</HI> to <HI>love him purely and perfectly,</HI> to <HI>love him for himself,</HI> and to <HI>desire to enjoy him,</HI> as he is a <HI>God of Holiness, Purity</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> more then for Gifts, or Comforts, or Rewards, that are of an inferior Nature; to <HI>hate</HI> and <HI>fear Sin,</HI> more then all punishment for Sin; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have no inward inclination, or desire to revenge In∣juries, but most willingly and heartily to <HI>forgive</HI> and <HI>bear</HI> them; to <HI>love Enemies,</HI> from the very inward ground and bottom of the Heart, and alwayes to render <HI>good</HI> for <HI>evil,</HI> and <HI>blessing</HI> for <HI>cursing.</HI> Now he that is in the state of a meer Servant, or Son of the Bond-woman, may en∣deavour to practise all these things in Word and Deed, as outwardly, and may have many inward wrestlings, and endeavours inwardly to bring his Heart to the inward Conformity of this most holy and spiritual Law; but until he be more inwardly changed and renewed, and born again by a second inward Birth, he cometh not

And <HI>first,</HI> That the said Doctrine is expresly con∣trary to Scripture, see <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.18. <HI>Being then made free from Sin, ye became the Servants of Righteousness.</HI> And Chap. 8.2, 3, 4, 5. and Vers. 9. and Chap. 6.6, 7, 8. <HI>Iohn</HI> 8.32, 33, 34, 35, 36. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 4.13. <HI>Coloss.</HI> 1.28. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.19.

that they shall not depart from him.</HI> And surely all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is doth plainly hold forth a freedom from a total sinning, and that daily in Thought, Word and Deed. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The very end of Christ's coming was to save his People from their Sins, and not in their Sins, to put an end to Sin, and to finish Transgression, and bring in everlast∣ing Righteousness, (<HI>Dan.</HI> 9.24.) and to do or effect that which the Law could not do, <HI>viz.</HI> to destroy Sin, and him who hath the power of Death, to wit, the Devil, <HI>that the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not af∣ter the Flesh, but after the Spirit,</HI> Rom. 8.4.

And if they cannot be fulfilled by men, and yet many Thousands cast into Hell-Fire for not fulfilling them, they are very grie∣vous, which God forbid we should think.

It is a fearful thing to teach or believe such Doctrine in a matter of so great moment, so to smooth and daub with un∣tempered Morter, and to flatter People, to tell them, They not only may, but must live and dye in their Sins, and yet immediately after Death, they shall go into Heaven, if once they have believed, their Faith secureth them, though they sin daily in Thought, Word and Deed, and break all God's holy Commandments every day, and that there be no Health, nor Soundness in them. And indeed it is the great love that People have to Sin and Iniquity, that maketh them plead so earnestly for it; for if they were weary of Sin, and did hate it, as a most cruel Tyrant, they would be glad to hear of a possibility of deliverance from Sin here in this world. And they that plead so much for Sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> live and dye in it, they plead for the Devil's Kingdom, and are his Servants and Mi∣nisters in that respect, and not the Servants and Ministers of Christ.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="160" REF="000472_0170_0FA6749717257DC8"/>6. But to clear the Doctrine of <HI>Perfe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on,</HI> as it is believed and preached by the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> take these following considerations; (1st.) It is not an absolute Perfection that we plead for, as attainable in this Life, as many of you have falsly accused us, &amp; particularly <HI>Samuel Norton,</HI> in his <HI>New-England Memorial,</HI> pag. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>57. as in many other things he doth most falsly charge that People in his said Book; for we say, That the highest degree of Perfection attainable in this Life ought not to be sit down and rested in by any, but there ought to be a continual pro∣gress, by the best, in Holiness, and in conformity to the Image of the Son of God, until the very last moment of their Life; for Christ himself, who was free from all sin, yet was perfected fur∣ther, as he was man, and did grow both in Grace and Stature; and <HI>Adam</HI> in the innocent state, was still to have increased in Virtue and Goodness, and then he would not have fallen, as he did. (2<HI>dly.</HI>) This perfection or freedom from Sin, and Possibility by the Grace of God, to keep his Commandments, we do not say it is attained by every one, at their first Conversion or entrance into the true Faith; but on the contra∣ry, we say, many true Believers, and who have a true measure of sincerity towards God, are yet short of that state of a sinless Perfection; and that it is not attained, but by great diligence, and wrestling against sin, through the ability of the Grace of God, and much watching and
<PB N="161" REF="000472_0171_0FA67497EB78E030"/>
prayer, and using all the means appointed of God, both inwardly and outwardly, to attain to that blessed Conquest and Victory over sin. (3<HI>dly.</HI>) The most perfect in this Life, have need to watch and pray, that they enter not into Temptation; for as <HI>Adam,</HI> in Innocency, and in the Garden, did sin, and by his sin lost his In∣nocency, so may men that are inwardly come to this state, if they be not duly watchful, sin a∣gainst the Lord; therefore it is not the impos∣sibility of sinning in all respects, that we plead for, but the possibility of not sinning, and that by the Grace of God, and not otherwise. Altho' some may arrive to that state in Holiness, in conformity to the second <HI>Adam,</HI> that they nei∣ther sin, nor can sin, in that sence as the Scrip∣ture doth intend it, 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.19. which doth at least hold forth, that such who are attained to this noble degree of Holiness, they cannot com∣mit any gross sin (although in some things, not for want of love, but not having a full and per∣fect Knowledge in all things, they may a little fall short, as a most loving Child, not perfectly understanding the Fathers mind in all things, may do a thing amiss, and yet without breach of true Love to his Father, and therefore his Father doth not charge it upon him as a crime; and the like example may be of a most loving Wife, to her Husband, who retaineth her chaste and per∣fect Love to her Husband, and yet may do some things not according to his mind; for as the
<PB N="162" REF="000472_0172_0FA674989674F660"/>
Scripture saith, <HI>Love is the fulfilling of the Law</HI> and he that faileth not in his Love, and trans∣gresseth not against the Law of Love, though in some case he may fall short in understanding, God doth not impute it to be a crime unto him. (4<HI>thly</HI>) It is not temptations or motions unto sin, that may arise either from the Devil, or the World without them, or from the natural and mortal part in them, that we plead a freedom from; for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is readily granted that such Temptations may and do follow the best men, and therefore they ought to watch against them, and resist them, the which if they do, and that they no wise joyn and consent to Temp∣tation, it is not sin unto them, according to that saying of an Antient, <HI>Non nocet sensus, si desit Consensus,</HI> i. e. the sense of the Temptation doth not hurt, if the consent be not given unto it. (5<HI>thly.</HI>) The Seed or Principle of Evil, tho' it remain in the mortal, or natural part, &amp; at times move to evil Thoughts and Desires, &amp;c. yet not being in any wise joyned nor consented unto, nei∣ther outwardly in Word or Deed, nor inward∣ly in the least Thought or Desire, or delight and love of the Heart yielded unto, nor obeyed, is not imputed to be Sin unto men, who do not joyn to it, nor obey it, even as the Seed and Principle of God's Grace, of Truth, Holiness, and Righteousness, that is in the Hearts of wicked men, and oft moveth in them to turn and convert th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m unto God from the evil of
<PB N="163" REF="000472_0173_0FA6749D81BA2768"/>
their wayes, yet not being consented, or yield∣ed unto, nor obeyed by them, it is not in that case their Righteousness, nor doth it make them in any respect righteous, unless they joyn and yield unto it, in true Obedience. (6<HI>thly.</HI>) It is not the same degree and stature of Perfection, that God requireth of every one, but accord∣ing to that measure and degree of Grace and Light that God hath imparted to every one, to some more, to others less, but to every one sufficient to the present time and state. For he that was faithful in the improving his two Ta∣lents to make them four, was accepted▪ although he made them not ten, as he that was faithful in his five, and made then ten, and they were both proportionally rewarded; hence we read of good and holy men, who are said to be perfect in their Generation, according to the Light and Grace that God gave them, in their Day and Age. And the high Priest that had on his Breast the <HI>Vrim</HI> and <HI>Thummim,</HI> that signifieth Lights and Perfections, was a Type of Christ, our great and only high Priest, who hath the <HI>Vrim,</HI> that is Lights, and the <HI>Thummim,</HI> that is Per∣fections, and distributeth of these Lights and Perfections variously towards his Saints and Children, but to all sufficiently. And so the degree of Perfection, and perfect Obedience ought to answer to the degree of Light and Grace that God giveth through Christ unto every one, and he who is faithful in that de∣gree,

So that Faithfulness in the Work and Service of God, is that which doth render a man perfect in the sight of God, according to the ability of Light and Grace received, whether in the state of a Child, Young-man, or Elder in Christ.

no other qualification, to constitute or make the Members of their visible Church, but a Profession of the true Religion: So that no∣thing of true Piety or Holiness, nothing of the Spirit of God, nothing of an inward Possession of Christ, or his Life, and Power, or Grace, or heavenly Presence and Appearance, is requisit to constitute any Members of their visible Church; and thus though all the Members of their visible Church were gross and notorious <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> and meer empty <HI>Formalists,</HI> having only a Form of Godliness, without the Power of it, they are sufficiently qualified to be their Church-Members; yea, notoriously <HI>slanderous Persons,</HI> notoriously <HI>Lyars, Deceivers, Drunkards, Adulterers, Thieves, Murderers,</HI> are qualified Members of their Church; for all these and the worst of men may profess the true Religion.

<P N="2">2. We find no such Church in all the Scrip∣ture, owned to be a Church of God, or Christ, that the outward Form or Profession of true Re∣ligion doth make a Church of God or Christ. But on the contrary, these who have the Form of Godliness, but have not the Power of it, and deny the Power, the Scripture bids, <HI>turn away from them; For of this sort are they which creep in∣to Houses,</HI> &amp;c. see 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.5, 6. And conse∣quently these can be no true Church of Christ. And as for the distinction of the Church, visible and invisible, it may be owned in a sence, but not in that sence given by them, as if to profess the true Religion was sufficient to make a Peo∣ple to be a true visible Church of Christ. For the invisible Church, and the visible, do not dif∣fer in Substance or Nature, but in some circum∣stances of Time, Places, and outward Actions. And it may be well allowed, that a Company, or Assembly of truly holy Men and Women, meet∣ing together at certain Times and Places, that are known to People among whom they dwell, and calling together upon the Name of the Lord▪ and teaching, and instructing, and edifying on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another, every one using his spiritual Gift o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ministration, whether in <HI>Praying</HI> or <HI>Prophecying</HI> to the Edification of the whole, may be calle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a <HI>visible Church,</HI> insomuch that they appear i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> external or outward and bodily Works an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Actions that are visible. But as the Body with∣out Life or Spirit is dead, and cannot properly be called a Man, so a Church or Assembly of Peo∣ple, only professing the true Religion (but having nothing of the true Life and Spirit of Christ, and whose outward and bodily Services and Works have no inward and spiritual Virtue and Life in them, which is that Salt that maketh them savoury, and doth recommend them unto God, so that he savoureth a sweet savour in them) cannot be truly and justly acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unted a true Church of Christ: For we no where find in Scripture any Society, or company of People called <HI>the Church of Christ,</HI> who had nothing but the Profession of the true Religion; and al∣though <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> &amp; meer <HI>Formalists</HI> did outward∣ly at times mingle or mix with sincere <HI>Christians,</HI> and did assume the same outward Profession with them in former Ages, as such were among the Churches of <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Galatia,</HI> &amp;c.

And therefore it ought to be the work of all the true Members of the true Church, to purge out the old Leaven, and to be a seperate People from

by one Spirit they are all baptized into one Body, and do all drink into one Spirit: And this is the true gathering of a Church, or Churches of Christ, that is far beyond all Profession of true Religion, or outward Signs, or Ceremonies, as that of <HI>water Baptism,</HI> which <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and others use to Initate or enter People into their Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, or outward Covenants, and Contracts or Bonds, which these called <HI>Independents</HI> us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to initiate or enter People into their Church, all which outward things are but mens Inventions, as they are now used, whereby to gather, and make up Churches: and all this is but mans ga∣thering and work, made Things, Likenesses and graven Images of heavenly things, which the Lord hath forbidden, saying, <HI>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness of any thing in Heaven above,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. For whatever men make, or set up, whether it be Church, Ordinance, or Service, without the Spirit and Power of God, inwardly moving, assisting, teaching, leading, guiding and order∣ing them so to do, is but mans work, a thing of man's making; and all such made Things, made Faiths, made Churches, made Worships, made Ordinances, without the Spirit and Power of God inwardly revealed, are to be abolished, shaken and removed, and the Voice of God will do it, whose Voice of Old did shake <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> and the Lord hath said, <HI>Yet once more I shake not the Earth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, but the Heavens also.</HI> And

And this is more then a Profess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the true Religion; for it is not every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at professeth the true Religion, to whom the Father in Hea∣ven hath revealed the Lord Jesus Christ, as he did unto <HI>Peter,</HI> and as he doth unto every true and faithful Believer, and Confessor of Christ. And the true Church that is built on this Rock, and every Member thereof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are not only hearers and professors of the Words and Do∣ctrine of Christ, but they are doers of them: But they who do not, although they both hear and say, they are foolish Builders, and build upon the Sand; and such are all these visible Churches, who have no other thing to qualifie them, but to profess the true Religion. Now, to profess the true Religion, carrieth a two-fold sence, one is, that the Religion which People profess, they call, or profess it to be the true Religion; and in this sence, every one that pro∣fesseth any Religion at all (if he be in earnest) professeth the true Religion; that is, he esteem∣eth or professeth his Religion to be such. The other sence is, that the Religion that is pro∣fessed, is indeed the true Religion, and is not only so called, or professed: And according to this sence, your visible Churches, whether <HI>Pres∣byterian</HI> or <HI>Independent,</HI> are no true Churches: For the Religion ye profess, is not the true Re∣ligion of Christ Jesus, which he, and the Pro∣phets, the Evangelists and Apostles did teach, as I have already proved in many weighty per∣ticulars,

But ye who say, <HI>All inward divine Revelation of Christ is ceased</HI>; ye build not on Christ, but on a meer Hear-say, and Historical report of him: For how can ye build on him, when ye have no belief that Christ is nearer unto you, than in some remote place beyond the Skies. Can the Walls of the House be built on a Foundation that is altogether remote from it? Must not the House and the Foundation be im∣mediately joyned together? And must not this Foundation be seen, and felt by every Member? And is not this incomparably more then the best Profession of true Religion? O ye blind Lea∣ders of the Blind! how doth my Soul pitty you, and the poor People more especially, who are led by you, and whom ye are still seeking to lead, until both ye and they fall into the Ditch; and ye ill deserve your Wages, and the many Hundreds, yea, Thousands of Pounds, that poor People pay Yearly unto you, and work sore and hard to feed you, and cloath you, and your Wives and Children, to Luxury and Wanton∣ness, many of you, while in the mean time, un∣der colour and pretence of feeding the Souls of the People, ye famish and starve, yea, poyson and kill them with your false Doctrine, as I have, through God's assistance sufficiently made ap∣pear, and I hope yet more to make appear, as I have occasion given unto me.</P>

And Christ Jesus, the living, elect, preci∣ous Corner-stone, the sure Foundation is laid in <HI>Zion,</HI> and that <HI>Zion</HI> is not only the heavenly <HI>Zion</HI> above, but the Church and People of God on Earth; and Christ Jesus is one both in Hea∣ven without us, and also within us, even the man Christ Jesus, the same that took hold of the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and is the Son of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> according unto that Seed, and he is exalted in heavenly Glory in that same Seed and Nature, in the whole and intire and per∣fect Nature of man, in Soul and Body, having put off nothing that he had upon Earth; but these Weaknesses and Infirmities which he did take on him for our sake, even Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> he who was crucified for our Sins, and rose again for our Justification, who was dead, and is alive, and lives for evermore; and he who by true Faith is joyned to the Spirit of Christ, by the same he is joyned both to Christ in him, and also to Christ in Heaven, and also to all the Saints in Heaven, and the innumerable company of Angels, and Spirits of just men made perfect▪ and also unto the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and both God and Christ are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only in remote places, and Heavens without us but also in us, and in all his Saints, as he hath said, <HI>Ier.</HI> 23.23, 24. <HI>Am I a God at Hand, sait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord, and not a God after off?

But if ye did preach the Letter, and have not that infallible and unerring Spirit of Christ, which was in the true Ministers of Christ in former Ages, and is now in his true Ministers in this Age, ye are but at best Ministers of the Letter, and not Ministers of the Spirit, and therefore not Ministers of the New-Testament. And what is the use and end of your Governments but to keep poor People in Bondage under you, and your false Doctrine? and if they do not be∣lieve it, but witness against it, then ye cast them out of your Synagogues, and yet then will force Maintenance from them, as many of you have done.

Or when gave he you such Commis∣sion? Or suppose ye had such Commission, sure∣ly ye are very unfaithful unto it, who creep each of you into a House, or Town, and there only pretend to teach a few that come to hear you. So did not the Apostles, but travelled from place to place, and from one Nation, City and Coun∣try to another, and had no certain dwelling place by virtue of their said Commission; but so do not ye, but commonly keep to one place, un∣less a fatter Benefice, or more yearly Sallary and Hire invite you to another.

Nay, alas! ye know it not in your selves, and preach against it, and therefore ye are not like to be Instruments to bring others to know it.

AS for the term, or word <HI>Sacrament,</HI> it is no where to be found in all the <HI>English</HI> Translation of the Bible received among <HI>Pro∣testants,</HI> nor is there any Word either in the <HI>He∣brew</HI> or <HI>Greek,</HI> that doth properly answer unto it, unless they will translate the <HI>Greek</HI> Word that signifieth <HI>Mystery,</HI> to signifie a <HI>Sacrament,</HI> as the old <HI>Latin</HI> hath it in <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.32. <HI>hoc est magnum Sacramentum,</HI> i. e. This is a great Sa∣crament; for which our <HI>English</HI> Translation rea∣deth more properly, This is a great Mystery. But if <HI>Sacrament</HI> signifie <HI>Mystery,</HI> then there must be as many <HI>Sacraments</HI> as <HI>Mysteries</HI>; and Faith it self is a Sacrament at that rate, and true Preach∣ing and Prayer, and every other Religious mat∣ter and thing, all which are holy Mysteries. And they who say, there are two Sacraments have borrowed these two out of the seven, professed by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> having cast off, and re∣jected five of the seven, for which the said
<PB N="181" REF="000472_0191_0FA674F054703938"/>
Church doth accuse these latter Churches of Sa∣criledge, and spiritual Robbery, to abolish and take away five of the seven Sacraments, or ra∣ther indeed the sixth also, seeing they believe it only to be but a Figure, to wit, that called the <HI>Eucharist</HI>: And to say the truth, they have not one whit more probabilty, but rather less, for the two Sacraments that they have reserved, than for the other five that they have rejected: And they have no cause to accuse the People call∣ed <HI>Quakers,</HI> of Sacriledge, for denying these two, until they clear themselves of Sacriledge for denying five, and give better grounds for reserving these two, than as yet they have given.</P>
<P N="2">2. And as for <HI>Infants Baptism,</HI> and sprinkling a Child of eight dayes, or more or less, on the Fore-head, and call it <HI>Baptism,</HI> it hath no foot∣ing in all the Scripture, neither of Precept nor Practice, as will easily appear, by considering the places of Scripture they cite for it. And first, for <HI>Sprinkling</HI> on the Fore-head, instead of <HI>Dipping,</HI> they cite <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.10. to 22. But this Sprinkling was not of Water, but of Blood; and we do not read that it was only on the Fore-head; and the Cups and Vessels that were sprink∣led with Blood or Water, were sprinkled all ever, and not in one single place. And why did <HI>Iohn</HI> baptize Christ by dipping into Water, and others that he baptized, if sprinkling on the Fore-head was sufficient in that day? Next, as
<PB N="182" REF="000472_0192_0FA674F115F903E8"/>
to the baptizing of Infants, they cite for it <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.9. <HI>Where God commanded</HI> Abraham <HI>that every Man-child of his Posterity should be Circumcised, and therefore every Infant of one, or both the believing Parents are to be sprinkled with Water.</HI> But this Consequence is meerly begged, but nothing proved. For the first, we find an express com∣mand to <HI>Abraham</HI>; For the second, we find nei∣ther Command nor Practice in all the Scripture, nor was the practice of Baptizing Infants in use, for an hundred of Years; and more, after the A∣postles da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, among Professors of <HI>Christianity.</HI> And let it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> granted, that Infants have a right to the Grace signified by Water-Baptism, it doth not therefore follow, that the Figure or Sign belongeth unto them, because they have also a right to Christ's Body and Blood, and yet they confess, the Supper is not to be administred unto them. The next place they cite, is <HI>Coloss.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.11, 12. where <HI>Circumcision</HI> and <HI>Baptism</HI> are joyned together, but neither the Circumcision, nor the Baptism there mentioned, is outward, as is clear, especially of Circumcision, that is said, <HI>to be made without Hands</HI>; and therefore it is not the outward of the Flesh, but the inward of the Heart; and so is also the Baptism there menti∣oned, vers. 12. <HI>Buried with him in Baptism, wherein also you are risen with him, through the Faith of the operation of God.</HI> Ye see here is nothing of out∣ward Water: Nor are all they who are bap∣tized with outward Water, either buried with
<PB N="183" REF="000472_0193_0FA674F216E2FE58"/>
Christ, or risen with him, but many still alive in old <HI>Adam,</HI> and that too generally. The next place they cite, is <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19. But this saith nothing of <HI>Water,</HI> and if it were granted that Water-baptism is understood, as it neither is, nor ought to be granted, yet it will not prove that Infants should be any more baptized than taught, seeing <HI>teaching</HI> and <HI>baptizing</HI> are joyned together. Another place they cite is, <HI>Luke</HI> 18.15, 16. where Christ biddeth to <HI>suffer little Chil∣dren to come unto him, and forbid them not,</HI> and that <HI>he blessed them, and laid his hands upon them,</HI> we read in Scripture; but that he baptized them either with dipping or sprinkling, we read not, but on the contrary it is expresly said, <HI>That Iesus himself baptized none,</HI> to wit, <HI>with Water,</HI> see <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4.2. Their last place they cite is <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.16. <HI>If the Root be holy, so are the Branches</HI>; but this doth not prove that Infants are more to be bap∣tized, than to have that called the Supper administred unto them: And these Branches mentioned by <HI>Paul</HI> in that place, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.16. were really the unbelieving <HI>Iews,</HI> that because of their Unbelief were broken off at that time, yet the Root being holy, to wit, <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the promised Seed, <HI>Paul</HI> had hope of their conversion, as many as did belong to Gods election, as he expresseth it, vers. 28. and these were not the immediate Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> but forty Ge∣nerations after <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Isacc,</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI>; and therefore this Scripture saith as much for
<PB N="184" REF="000472_0194_0FA674F2E2BEF560"/>
the aged unbelieving Children of unbelieving Parents, if they have descended from any of their fore-Fathers, upwards of forty Generations, that were Believers; and if up to forty, why not up to sixty, and further? yea, to <HI>Noah,</HI> who is the common Father of all men, with whom God established his Covenant, and with his Seed after him, until the end of the World, that all his Seed through Christ, might receive the benefit of the same, unless they do wilfully reject it; of which I have said something alrea∣dy in Chap. 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. And as for <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> in general, we say, it did only properly belong to <HI>Iohn's</HI> Mini∣stry and Dispensation, and is expresly contra-distinguished from the Baptism of Christ, both by <HI>Iohn,</HI> and also by Christ himself; for <HI>Iohn</HI> did <HI>baptize with Water unto Repentance,</HI> but Christ, who cometh after <HI>Iohn,</HI> and was before him, who is more worthy than <HI>Iohn, he baptizeth with fire, and with the holy Ghost</HI>; and no doubt there was a spiritual blessing and Grace conveyed unto People, by <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Baptism, while it stood in force; for God never ordained any outward thing, but as it was rightly done, in its day and season, it had some spiritual blessing accompany∣ing it, as all the Sacrifices and Services of the Law: And if any were raised up by the Lord, as <HI>Iohn</HI> was, and could prove, and instruct their being sent to baptize with Water, as he was, these to whom they should be sent, ought gladly
<PB N="185" REF="000472_0195_0FA674F71E4CD600"/>
to receive it; but to do it by bare imitation, or a meer pretended Call, which they cannot prove to be either mediate or immediate, is gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at pre∣sumption, yea, superstition; and to call that a Command of God, which he hath given them no command to practise, is to set up the Precepts of men in the room of Gods Commandments, as the Phar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es did of old, and is a taking of his Name in vain, for which he will not hold them guiltless. And they can never prove, by all their art and skill, that <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> is commanded by Christ, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.18, 19. for all Gods com∣mands and precepts, especially of publick insti∣tution, relating to the Church, are express, in so many express Words, and are not left to be gathered by uncertain and doubtful Conse∣quences. When God sent <HI>Iohn</HI> to baptize with Water, Water was expressed; but in the A∣postles Commission to baptize, no mention is made of Water, nor no words of Institution commanded to be used, but the command is, <HI>Go, teach and baptize all Nations into the Name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.</HI> And the Name of either the Father, or the Son, or the holy Ghost, is most frequently, if not always used in Scripture, to signifie Power and Life, as <HI>the Name of the Lord is a strong Tower: thy Name is as Ointment poured forth,</HI> &amp;c. And whereas they object, first, <HI>That the Apostles could not bap∣tize with the spiritual Baptism.</HI> I answer, yea; they could Instrumentally and Ministerially,
<PB N="186" REF="000472_0196_0FA674F883E5AA58"/>
as well as they could convert, and beget Sons and Daughters unto God; for they were Mini∣sters of the Spirit, and did minister of the Spirit, both in <HI>Preaching,</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> and <HI>laying on of Hands,</HI> although God only was the principal worker and author. Next, they object, <HI>That</HI> Peter <HI>and</HI> Paul, <HI>and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> others, baptized some with Water, and that Christ was baptized with Water.</HI> But none of these prove what they in∣tend, for Christ was baptized by <HI>Iohn,</HI> and also he was circumcised according to the Law, and <HI>Paul</HI> circumcised <HI>Timothy</HI>; and the Apostles ge∣nerally in that day thought fit both to use, and tolerate the use of <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> that belong∣ed to <HI>Iohn,</HI> and divers other things of the Law, which by permission, for a time, and not by any Gospel standing Commission; otherwise <HI>Paul</HI> would never have said, he was not sent to bap∣tize, but to preach the Gospel; nor would he have thanked God that he had baptized so few: for it were strange to think that <HI>Paul</HI> would thank God, that he did not so fully obey a Go∣spel precept. In short, if these who are so zea∣lous for <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> were cordially zealous, for the inward and spiritual Baptism, they might be the more born with, as Men bear with Chil∣dren, that use Likenesses and Figures of things, that sute most with the age and state of Children, and Charity might be allowed them in that case, to be as Children or Babes in Christ, if they did hunger and thirst after Righteousness, and did
<PB N="187" REF="000472_0197_0FA674FAEB45F120"/>
wait for the inward appearance and coming of Christ's Kingdom, and the Revelation of it in their Hearts, as some such there may be. But these, who altogether are for the outwrad Bap∣tism and Supper, and deny wholly the inward and spiritual Baptism and Supper of Christ, which is only known and received by the holy Spirit's inward Revelation, no Charity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be allowed unto them, to judge them true <HI>Christians</HI> in any degree, not so much as Babes, but alto∣gether, for the time, Hypocrites and Formalists.</P>
<P N="4">4. Next, concerning the Supper: We grant that Christ had an outward Supper with his Dis∣ciples, when he did eat the Pascal Lamb with them; and this was a real Supper, and not like that which ye now use, that is neither substantial Supper nor Dinner, being only a little crumb of Bread, scarce so big as a Nut, and a spoonful of Wine, or two, which hath little outward Sub∣stance, and no inward and spiritual Signification unto you, as ye use it, while ye altogether deny, that the Saints are pertakers of the substance of Christ, or that Christ really and substantially dwelleth in his Saints; and while ye also deny all inward Revelation of him in these latter Ages, Your Supper is a meer shadow, and none of Christ's Supper, nor of his Institution. For when Christ did sup with his Disciples, in the Night wherein he was betrayed, he began with the Cup, and blessed, or gave thanks, and said, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke this, and divide it among your selves.</HI> And
<PB N="188" REF="000472_0198_0FA674FB95820EC8"/>
next he took Bread, and blessed, or gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, <HI>This is my Body, this do in Remembrance of me</HI>: Like∣wise after Supper he took the Cup, saying, <HI>This Cup is the New-Testament in my Blood, drink ye all of it,</HI> Luke 22.14. to 20. So we see, he used the Cup twice, and began and ended with it, but so do not ye; and though ye seem greatly to blame the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> for not giving the Cup to the People, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Bread, and charge them with mutilating, or dismembring the Institution; if so, do not ye the same in part? seeing ye use the Cup but once, and Christ used it twice, and began with it, but so do not ye. And seeing ye say, <HI>Ye have not that infallible Spirit that Christ had, and gave to the Apostles</HI>; and that we find you wholly ignorant of Christ's Body, and that ye have no discern∣ing of it, nor no taste and favour of his Flesh, which is Meat indeed, nor of his Blood, which is Drink indeed, and know not the inward and spiritual supping with Christ, we cannot believe, nor acknowledge, that ye <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Inde∣pendent</HI> Teachers, have any power to bless either the Bread, or the Cup, as Christ did, or to mi∣nister, or give of his Body and Blood to any People, which true Ministers of Christ have done, and do at this day, to my certain know∣ledge and joy, and to the certain knowledge and joy of many thousands with me, and that often in the use of outward eating and drinking, being
<PB N="189" REF="000472_0199_0FA674FC6BC33F40"/>
sanctified and blessed by the Word of God and Prayer, as we have sat down together, whether many or a few, we have truly witnessed the ful∣filling of that saying, <HI>Luke</HI> 24.35. <HI>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of Bread.</HI> And as it is, Vers. 30, 31. <HI>And it came to pass, as he sate at Meat with them, he took Bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them, and their Eyes were opened,</HI> (Note, even as <HI>Ionathan's</HI> Eyes were opened, or lightned, when he did eat the Honey; and as <HI>Isaac</HI> blessed <HI>Iacob</HI> when he did eat what he had pre∣pared of savoury Meat for him; and as the Angel blessed <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he did eat of the Calf, and the Cakes that were set before him; and as <HI>Melchizedeck</HI> blessed <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he brought him Bread and Wine; and divers other the like examples) <HI>and they knew him,</HI> &amp;c. Even so can many say at this day, to God's praise, in the outward Eating and Drinking together, as they have sate together, and waited in true silence, until God has been pleased to move some one or other of his faithful Servants and Ministers of his Word of Life, and of his Flesh and Blood, which is spiritual, to pray unto the Lord, or give Thanks, their outward eating and drinking hath been so blessed unto them, that at one and the same time they have eat both the outward Bread with the bodily Mouth, and the inward Bread, which is spiritual, with the inward &amp; spiri∣tual Mouth; and they have also drunk outwardly
<PB N="190" REF="000472_0200_0FA674FD23EBC918"/>
the outward Cup, and inwardly the inward and spiritual: and so at the same time, they have fed at a two-fold Table, &amp; have been both inwardly and outwardly refreshed, nourished and strenth∣ned; and this also often-times, in the use only of inward Prayer and Thanskgiving, as well as of both inward and outward; and yet we neither do, nor can limit the spiritual and inward eat∣ing of Christ's Body, and drinking of his Blood, to any outward eating or drinking whatsoever. As neither did the ancient <HI>Christians,</HI> who said, <HI>That all true Believers eat Christ's Flesh, and drink his Blood, daily and hourly</HI>; and so we believe. And no doubt, Christ did really give his Body and Blood unto his Discip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es at that time, and it was not a bare Figure or Sign that he gave them, but in the use of the Bread and Wine, he gave them at the same time, an inward enjoyment of him. And all this we own, and are very glad of such occasions, when we have them, to sit to∣gether, and eat and drink both outwardly and inwardly, enjoying a two-fold Table and Sup∣per at one time, and finding the Lord himself spiritually present, and blessing both unto us, and enabling us to receive both his Spiritual and Temporal Blessings, with <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Thank∣giving</HI>: And such breaking of Bread we own, from House to House, even outwardly as well as inwardly, with singleness and gladness of Heart, as the <HI>Primiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Christians</HI> did of Old, sometimes in a lesser Number, and sometimes in a greater:
<PB N="191" REF="000472_0201_0FA674FDDC68DF78"/>
for at that Supper above-mentioned, <HI>Luke</HI> 24.30. there were only present these two Disciples, besides Christ himself; so that it is not the num∣ber, whether greater or small, that is essen∣tial. And also we do believe, and say, that it is our Duty, not only in these more solemn Eat∣ings and Drinkings, to remember the Lord's death, and what he hath done, and suffered for us, when we thus eat &amp; drink together, perhaps many belonging to divers Families, but also in all our other Eatings and Drinkings, and at all other times, as it doth please the Lord to enable us; and every true <HI>Christian</HI> hath the Lord's Death, Resurrection, and his great Love, and what he hath done and suffered for us, printed as in Ca∣pital Letters, upon his very Heart and Soul, and writ as a living Epistle, with the Spirit of the living God, upon fleshly Tables; and that this ought to be done, not only to his more abun∣dant inward and spiritual coming unto us, but to be perpetuated, and continued by all true <HI>Christians,</HI> to the end of the World, and the last coming of Christ. And now tell me, where∣in we are behind you? or wherein we fall short of you? or what excellency, worth, or value hath your Supper above, and beyond ours? But on the contrary, hath not ours the advantage every way? seeing we have more frequently, both the outward and inward Eating and Drink∣ing together, then ye have the outward; and alas, the many l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an and dead Souls among you,
<PB N="192" REF="000472_0202_0FA674FEDAD2ED98"/>
void of inward and spiritual discerning, taste o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> savour, too manifestly demonstrate, ye are ge∣nerally strangers to the Supper of the Lord. And we also acknowledge the outward Eating and Drinking, is but a figure of the inward, and therefore ought not to be rested in, but the Substance, that is invisible and eternal, ought to be minded, and sought after above all. And though we are not for holding up, or preaching of Figures meerly institute, for to signifie and represent a thing to come, as were these under the Law; yet such a Figure as is natural, and necessarily to be used by us all, as eating and drinking, we may not reject: for the outward eating and drinking is a natural and necessary Figure of the inward, even as the whole outward World is a Figure of the inward and spiritual, as <HI>Paul</HI> doth expresly call it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.31. see the <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. And concerning that ye call your <HI>Christian-Sabboth,</HI> which ye say is the first Day of the Week; and ye do possitively affirm in your Con∣fession, <HI>That the Sabboth was changed from the last Day of the Week, from the Resurrection of Christ, unto the first day of the Week, and so to continue unto the end of the World</HI>; see Confess. cap. 21. sect. 7. But ye bring no sober proof for any such change, and the Scriptures ye cite say no such thing, as <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.2, 3. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.10. <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.8.10. <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.17. That plaee in <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.2, 3. saith nothing of the <HI>first Day,</HI> but of the <HI>seventh Day</HI>: And
<PB N="193" REF="000472_0203_0FA674FF544139F8"/>
what that <HI>seventh Day</HI> is, ye cannot demonstrate. And as to the next Scripture, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.10. where <HI>Iohn</HI> sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, <HI>he was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day.</HI> Although it is more then ye can prove from Scripture, that the <HI>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Day</HI> of the Week is that <HI>Lord's Day</HI>; yet taking it for granted, it doth not therefore follow that it was appointed to be the <HI>Christian Sabboth</HI>: But it might be so call∣ed, because Christ rose upon that day, and ho∣noured that day solemnly, not only with his ri∣sing upon it, but appearing at sundry times on that day to his Disciples, betwixt his Resur∣rection and Ascention: and that the <HI>Christians</HI> did usually and more solemnly meet on that day for publick and religious Worship, in honour of our Saviour, than on other da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, we readily grant; and so also do we, according to the Ex∣ample of the ancient <HI>Christians.</HI> And all true <HI>Christians</HI> should employ more of their time in religious Works and Services, both in private and in publick, than the <HI>Iews</HI> did, and ought not to fall short of them, but exceed them. And that beside other times set apart for the worship of God, both in publick and in private, it is com∣mendable in <HI>Christians</HI> to set apart the first day of the Week from common and ordinary labour, not only for an ease to their Servants and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>attel, but also that they may with the more freedom, and cheerful readiness attend upon the Lord, and his Service, without all incumberance. For experience doth prove it, that even bodily Rest
<PB N="194" REF="000472_0204_0FA675006029E300"/>
from toil and labour, doth contribute to the ease of the Mind, and is a help, being duly used, to disburthen it from divers weights. For if the Body be over-charged with labour, it is a hurt and clog unto the Mind in divers respects? But all this doth not prove, that the first day of the Week was appointed for a Sabboth, and put in the room of the seventh day of the Week en∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yned to the <HI>Iews,</HI> and People of <HI>Israel</HI>; for that outward Sabboth that was enjoyned unto th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, was a Sign an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Figure, as all other out∣ward Sabboths which they had, were, as of Weeks, Monet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Years, as well as of Dayes. And when the pure Gospel and Christian Dispensation did take place, all these figurative and shadowy Sab∣boths were changed to the Substance, and that Substance or Body is Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, according to <HI>Coloss.</HI> 2.17. But to say, the <HI>Iewish</HI> Sabboth is chang∣ed into the first day of the Week, is to put the first day of the Week in the room of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is a great dishonour unto him; for he is the End and Perfection of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law, and of all the shadowy and figurative Ordi∣nances thereof: and as the outward Temple th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the <HI>Iews</HI> had, is not to be changed into anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> outward Temple, but Christ is the true Temple o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Christians,</HI> wherein they meet, so he is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sabboth, and not any outwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d day.

But it mentione<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="195" REF="000472_0205_0FA67503ACE51678"/>
the seventh day, wherein the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d rested from all his Works, and that Rest signifieth the per∣fection or finishing of them; although as it is said, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. the Works were finished from the Foundation of the World; and therefore that seventh day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth signifie Christ Jesus, the first and the last, who is the alone true Rest and Sabboth of all the Faithful, as he invited, saying, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest.</HI> And con∣cerning this spiritual and divine Sabboth, or Sabbatism, it is said in <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.9, 10. <HI>There∣fore t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re doth remain a Rest unto the People of God: for he that is entred into his Rest, he also hath ceased from his own Works, as God did from his; let us labour therefore to enter into that Rest,</HI> &amp;c. And verse 3. <HI>We which have believed, do enter into Rest.</HI> By all which it doth plainly appear, that the New-Testament understandeth the <HI>Christian Sabboth,</HI> not of any outward Day, but of Christ, which the outward Sabboths of the <HI>Iews</HI> did by way of Allegory signifie and hold forth. And lastly, as to <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.17. where Christ saith, <HI>he came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it</HI>: It is not to be understood that he came to keep up, and perpetuate the Types and Figures of the Law, but to put an end to them, and in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and place thereof to fulfil all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Equity and Justice, that they did signifie or hold forth, which is as the Kernal: otherwise ye might argue as much for upholding the outward

<P>THe Burden of the Word of the Lord that came unto me on the twenty first day of the fourth Moneth, 1688. in the Town of <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> to declare it unto <HI>Boston</HI> its Inhabitants, and to the Inhabitants of <HI>New-England,</HI> who have been, or are concerned in opposing, and hardning their Hearts against the inward appearance of God, and of his Son Christ Jesus, in the Hearts of his Servants, and in the Living Testimonies they have born unto you, to call you to believe in the Light of his Son Christ Jesus, who hath enlightned you all, and every one of you, and to turn you from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Sa∣tan unto God. Oh! repent, repent for your great Sins, and Transgressions of all sorts, that ye have committed against the Lord, and against

his holy and divine Light and Gift in all your Hearts, and especially Repent of your great <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> all Teachers and People of <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>New-England</HI> every where, who call your selves <HI>Christians,</HI> and have a Name to live, but are dead, who draw near unto God with your Mouths, and honour him with your Lips, but have removed your Hearts far away from him, and who have the Name of Christ oft in your Mouths, and think to cover you with his impu∣ted Righteousness, while ye are ignorant of his Life, and holy Power &amp; Spirit, and divine Nature in your Hearts, and while ye are daily crucifying the Lord of Glory afresh, and puting him to open shame, and treading under Foot the Blood of the Covenant, as the holy Scripture declareth con∣cerning some that professed Christ Jesus in for∣mer Ages. And this is the state of many of you, yea, of the generality of you, both Teachers and People of <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> of all sorts, a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Names excepted, whom the Lord doth honour, and they shall walk with him in White, although ye have sought to dishonour them.

<P>I being well assured, both by the Spirit of God in my Heart, and the Testimony of the holy Scriptures, that the Doctrine ye preach to the People is false, and pernicious to the Souls of People in many things, do earnestly desire and entreat you, and every one of you, the Preachers in the Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> to give me a fair and publick hearing, or meeting with you, either in one of your publick Meeting-Houses, or in any other convenient place, where all who are desirous to come may have liberty, and let the time be as soon as may, as either to day in the Af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernoon, or to morrow in the Fore-noon,

And is your Preaching to the People so little effectual that many Years teaching them, is not sufficient to save them from the danger of two or three Hours fair debating of things?

Suppositions, <HI>If this,</HI> and <HI>If that</HI>; so that in six Lines or seven, ye have five needless Suppositions, and labour as men in a Sweat, or at least seem so to do, to find out the design or intention of my Writing unto you, the which is plain, without any enquiry; for I told you very pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inly, the end of my writing, was to inform you, That ye preach unto the People many false and unsound Principles, pernicious to the Souls of People. And if ye could not receive my In∣formation, I proffered to debate these things fairly with you. And though I neither had, nor have the least mind to Cavil, yet I most assuredly believe, that the Peace of your Churches is not the true Peace of Christ, but that both ye and they are set down in a false peace and rest. And therefore he, who at the command of Christ Je∣sus, and by the motion of his eternal Spirit, doth proclaim a holy War, and soundeth an alarm in your Ears, that Christ himself is come, and more abundantly coming to take away your false Peace, and to send a spiritual Sword and Fire unto you, is really your best Friend, and such a Friend I am unto you, whether ye will hear or forbear. For I came not unto you in my own will, but a necessity from the Lord, by his living Motion in my Heart, and his living Word, that was, and is as a Sword and a Fire, did lie upon me to clear my self among you. And seeing your Churches are no true Churches of Christ, as I have sufficiently demonstrated in this Treatise,

their peace is no true peace, and therefore must and will be broken, and the sooner it be broken, the better it will prove to many poor Souls among you, in order to their being gathered un∣to the Lord. And whereas ye say in your Let∣ter, <HI>If he would have a publick Audience, let him Print</HI>: Ye see how I have complyed with your Proposal, yet not in your will, but in the will of the Lord, who hath laid it upon me, and hath assisted me in this undertaking, to write this Treatise, and direct it more perticularly unto you, and more generally to all the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> Teachers and People, both in <HI>New-England,</HI> or elsewhere, to whose Hands by divine Providence it shall come. And I require thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reasonable demand of you, that seeing ye have said, <HI>Let him Print,</HI> that after it is come unto you, ye would seriously read it, and if it please God by it, as an Instrument, to convince you, through his eternal Spirit, give God the Glory, and confess to the Truth: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut if other∣wise, that still ye think ye have Truth on your side, then appear in Print openly to defend your Cause, not with Railing and Lyes, but solid Ar∣guments, if ye can produce them. And if in some places I seem to have appeared sharp unto you, or your Brethren, in this undertaking, I would have you to consider, that on a due ex∣amination, my Arguments and Reasons are full as sharp as my Charges or Conclusions; and sharp <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remisses can well allow to have sharp
<PB N="211" REF="000472_0221_0FA67517CDB97D20"/>
Conclusions. And what sharpness or tartness, or seeming Severity I have used, true love and compassion to Souls, as well as zeal to God's Glory hath constrained it. Sweet potions of Physick are not always the most safe. The true Prophets of God were generally led and moved of God, to reprove sharply the false Prophets of Old. And Christ, and the Apostles, and other true Teachers, did sharply reprove false Tea∣chers in that day; and there is the same cause now, and the same Spirit of Truth, and true Zeal now that moveth in God's true Servants in measure in this day. The precious Souls of many Thousands lie at stake, and therefore there ought to be plain dealing, and no daubing with untem∣pered Morter, or sowing Pillows under Arm∣holes. I know the wrath of man doth not work the Righteousness of God, and I have la∣boured to keep free from that human Passion: and whether I have kept clear and free of it, I can, and do freely submit to the Judgment of the spiritual man, who hath a spiritual discern∣ing, and is able to judge; but to the carnal man's Judgment I have no reason to submit. And as I f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eely submit my Spirit to be tryed, so the Do∣ctrine to him that is able, and above all, I ap∣peal to the holy Scripture, as the best outward Test and Touch-stone, and to the inward open∣ing of the holy Spirit, in all that are sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible of it, without which ye cannot but err, not know∣ing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God. Ye
<PB N="212" REF="000472_0222_0FA67519125C1A90"/>
decline my coming privately to your Houses, ci∣ting for your Warrant, <HI>Iohn</HI> 2. vers. 10. but I had no such design; however, ye miserably mis∣apply that place of Scripture, as ye are wont to do many more. For ye take it for granted, that I bring another Doctrine, than the Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles, which I altogether de∣ny. Secondly, what <HI>Iohn</HI> did write, was to a private Woman, and therefore doth not qua∣drate to you, who reckon your selves publick men, and Rulers as well as Teachers and Pastors in the Church; and I do not find any command or practice in all the Scripture for you to decline a fair Dispute with men, suppose Hereticks or false Teachers, unless ye have first dealt with them, in order to convince them: And even ye ought not to reject an Heretick, till after the first and second Admonition, according to Scripture, but ye never as yet gave me your first: And he who is an Heretick, is self-condemned, which I bless God, I am not; and ye pretend not to that spiritual discerning, whereby ye can know me to be such. It is not always one, nor divers Errors or mistakes in Judgment, that maketh men wor∣thy of that odious Name of <HI>Heretick.</HI> The A∣postle <HI>Iohn,</HI> and all the other Apostles had the infallible Spirit of Truth, and that gave them a discerning infallibly to judge both Doctrines and Spirits; but this ye neither have, nor lay claim to: And yet we find that the Apostles did not shun to discourse and debate with men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="213" REF="000472_0223_0FA6751BAB6BEBC8"/>
Principles, as occasion and season required. And Christ also did unweariedly reason with Oppo∣sers of all sorts, <HI>Iews, Pharisees, Sadducies,</HI> &amp;c. And <HI>Paul</HI> disputed daily in the School of <HI>Cyrannus,</HI> with them that opposed, and with <HI>Epicurians</HI> and <HI>Libertines,</HI> and others at <HI>Athens,</HI> &amp; went into the <HI>Iews</HI> Synagogues, &amp; reasoned with them; &amp; did not excuse themselves with your silly Evasion, that these men were false Teachers, and there∣fore ought not to be disputed with. The Scrip∣ture commandeth, that in Meekness we should instruct them that oppose themselves, if God peradventure may give them Repentance. And though this is not the work of all private <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> who have not a publick Gift of teach∣ing, and are not called to that Work, yet this is no defence unto you, who pretend to be pub∣lick Teachers. And if it be so, that false Tea∣chers are on no account to be received into Houses, ye little consider how this Weapon may ere long be turned against your selves: For my hope is, that in due time, many People, both in <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> shall have their Eyes opened by the Spirit of the Lord, which ye blaspheme, to see your sort to be these false Tea∣chers, who bring not the Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles, and the Houses ye Preach in, not being your Houses, but the Houses of the People, they shall not any more receive you into them, and this warrantably enough, according to your own words. But seeing ye are so unwilling that any called a <HI>Quaker,</HI> should come into your
<PB N="214" REF="000472_0224_0FA6751C5C34CF58"/>
Houses, why should ye receive their Goods? to wit, their Kettles, Pewter, Houshold-stuff, Corn and Cattel, as some, yea, many of your Brethren have done, and used them as your own, though injustly taken away from the true Owners, be∣cause they would not give you Maintenance. A rare and unparalled practice, no where to be tra∣ced in all the Scripture, nay, not by false Pro∣phets and Teachers, in like manner as ye have done. And when our honest Friends have ex∣postulated with you, <HI>Why ye crave Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of them, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o do not hear you</HI>? ye have oft told them, <HI>The Door is open, and have invited them to come</HI>; yea, and some have been fined for not coming to your Houses, some call Churches, but now, by your words, no <HI>Quaker</HI> (because, as ye suppose, he bringeth not the true Doctrine) is to be received into your Houses; and if this be not a contra∣diction, and a piece of Confusion, like most of your work, let the impartial judge. And your citing places of Scripture so frequently, contra∣ry to the very intention and end of them, as I have sufficiently proved in this Treatise, I know not to what other thing I can better compare it, then to <HI>Turk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> Pirats at Sea, who hang out an <HI>English</HI> Flag or Colours, on purpose to deceive the unwary Marriners.

<HEAD>A brief Answer to some gross Abuses, Lyes and Slanders, published some Years ago, by <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te Teacher of a Church at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> in his Book, called, <HI>An Essay for the recording of Illustrious Providences,</HI> &amp;c. and by <HI>Samuel Norton,</HI> in his Book called, <HI>New-England's Memorial.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe said <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> in the eleventh Chapter of his Book, called, <HI>An Essay,</HI> &amp;c. relateth a long Story of three mad <HI>Quakers,</HI> cal∣led, <HI>Thomas Cases</HI> Crew, one of them being a man called <HI>Denham,</HI> and two Women, who went down to <HI>South-hold,</HI> and they met with <HI>Samu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Banks</HI> of <HI>Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld,</HI> the most blasphemous Villain, as they call him, that ever was known in these parts, and some other Inhabitants of that Town on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> where they fell a Dancing and Singing after their Diabolical manner; and how at that time they proselited one, called <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omas Harris</HI> (belonging to <HI>Boston</HI>) to be of their way, and how after some short time, the said <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ris</HI> was found dead by the Sea-side, with three Holes like Stabs in his Throat, and no Tongue in his Head. And two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther Stories he subjoyneth, concerning these of the same Crew or Company, called the <HI>Singing and Dancing
<PB N="217" REF="000472_0227_0FA6751E264E8C90"/>
Quakers</HI>; the last hath in it a Relation, how the said <HI>Ionathan Denham</HI> (alias <HI>Singleterry</HI>) and one <HI>Mary Rosse,</HI> did many frentick and Diabolical Tricks, and among others, that he sacrificed a Dog at <HI>Plymouth</HI>-Colony in <HI>New-England.</HI> And all these Stories he doth relate, on purpose to abuse that honest and sober People, called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> without making any distinction, nor giving the least Information to the World, how that the Body of People called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, do not in the least own these ungodly and wicked People, men∣tioned by him, called <HI>Thomas Cases</HI> Crew, nor any others of that sort, but have all along de∣clared against them, and shewed the greatest dislike and abhorrency of their Spirit and ways, that is possible, and all their mad and frentick Tricks and Freaks of Singing and Dancing, or any others of all kinds: And the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> have suffered more Abuses and Inso∣lencies, by that ungodly and wicked Crew of <HI>Thomas Case,</HI> and others of that Spirit, than any other People in these Countries, whereof many sober People that do not profess themselves to be <HI>Quakers,</HI> can bear Witness both in <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and in <HI>Road-Island,</HI> and also at <HI>Newer∣sinks</HI> in <HI>East-Iersey,</HI> how for many Years they have molested them, frequently at their Meet∣ings, and more especially at our Friends general Meetings at <HI>Oyster-Bay,</HI> and <HI>Rhoad-Island,</HI> and divers other places. And when the said <HI>Ionathan Denham</HI>; and <HI>Mary Rosse</HI> were whipt by the
<PB N="218" REF="000472_0228_0FA6751ED96BC830"/>
order of the Magistrates of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> there were some of the honest People, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> pre∣sent, who openly declared before the People, That the <HI>Quakers</HI> did not at all own them to be of their Society; and did declare their loathing and abhorrency of their Practices, and that they could not own them to be sufferers for Christ's sake: And though they assume to themselves the Name of <HI>Quakers</HI> and call themselves the <HI>new Quakers,</HI> yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wll not follow, that they are of the Society of that sober and honest People: for it is not the Name or Profession, that is the sign, or mark of distinction owned by that Peo∣ple, who own none to be of their Society or Fel∣lowship, unless they walk in the Truth, as well as profess it; and the Truth leads into all Sobri∣ety and Gravity in all things, but into none of these mad Gestures, and ungodly Singings and Dancings, under the pretence of Raptures of heavenly Joy. For although we own Singing with the holy Spirit, and with understanding and discretion, and giving Thanks unto God, according to the Scriptures, and the example of the Primitive <HI>Christians,</HI> yet the Singing of such ungodly Persons we never did, nor can own; and we believe that Weeping and Howling, and bit∣ter Mourning is more proper for them. And for <HI>Dancing,</HI> it was never a thing owned by that People, nor is at this day; only <HI>Thomas Case</HI> and his Crew lately, or of late Years, have run into that, and other mad Practices, by <HI>Satan's</HI> Insti∣gation,
<PB N="219" REF="000472_0229_0FA6751FA92A1218"/>
nor does that Crew or Company of <HI>Tho∣mas Case,</HI> nor himself agree in professed Prin∣ciples, with the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> unless it be in some general things, common to all sorts: For they are plain <HI>Ranters</HI> and <HI>Libertines,</HI> and upon due search and examination, their chief Principle doth agree with the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> Confession of Faith, rather then with the <HI>Quakers.</HI> For these ranting Crew of <HI>Case's</HI> followers, and himself, do say, <HI>That whatever they do, they are constrained to do it, and cannot do otherwise.</HI> And is not this the same that your <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> saith, <HI>That God hath fore∣ordained infallibly, and unchangably whatever com∣eth to pass, without making any distinction</HI>? And this <HI>Increase Mather</HI> hath exactly followed, and imitated the practice and example of the ancient malicious and persecuting <HI>Heathens,</HI> who, when any unlucky thing happened to be said or done, by any called <HI>Christians,</HI> although they were no <HI>Christians,</HI> but only assumed the Name on pur∣pose to deceive, these malicious <HI>Heathens</HI> did throw it all upon the <HI>Christians,</HI> without making any distinction. And the like concerning these <HI>Rusticks,</HI> that rose up in War against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir law∣ful Princes in <HI>Germany,</HI> and the mad Crew that followed <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Leiden</HI>; the Adversaries of Truth did impute all this as the proper effect of the Reformation. And thus also in Old <HI>England,</HI> the ungodly Sayings and Practices of <HI>Ranters</HI> and <HI>Libertines,</HI> have been odiously cast upon the
<PB N="220" REF="000472_0230_0FA67520574B8428"/>
People called <HI>Quakers</HI>; whereas it is well known that the People called <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akers,</HI> have always with great zeal, opposed the <HI>Ranters</HI> and <HI>Liber∣tines,</HI> both in their Principles and Practices, and have shewed their Zeal against them, both in Disputing and Printing against them, more then any People have done; and have been a great occasion and means of suppressing that evil spirit in them, so that little of it hath for many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears openly appeared in Old <HI>England</HI>; and the same Ranting Spirit is greatly decaying of late Years, in these <HI>American</HI> parts, and we hope ere long it shall quite be gone. And let the impartial judge, whether it can be any other thing but Malice, as well as Rashness (as he hath shewed his rashness and folly in some other passages of his Life, if not Malice, that hath occasioned him for some∣time past to abscond, and depart from the place, where he preached at <HI>Boston</HI>) in this <HI>Increase M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her,</HI> to charge the Crimes of the Guilty up∣on the Innocent, without distinction, when it is notoriously known, both i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>New-England,</HI> and in all other place<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, where the Peo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le called <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> live, that they never did own any of these People, from the first instant, that they appear∣ed in any of these Practices. And seeing ye of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> cannot but acknowledge, that too many unlucky and unchristian Practices have fallen-out, and have been committed by your Church-Members, as <HI>Whoredom, Drunkenness,</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="000472_0231_0FA6752162F6E1C8"/>
and the like, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet if when upon your first discovery of these things, ye have disowned them, and sufficiently cleared your selves of them, we are more men, and more reasonable than to charge these things upon you; And when <HI>Iudas</HI> betrayed Christ his Lord and Master, though he was one of the twelve, and numbred amongst them, should therefore this great Crime of <HI>Iudas</HI> be cast upon the eleven that were In∣nocent? Or when <HI>David</HI> committed these two great Sins of <HI>Murder</HI> and <HI>Adultery,</HI> should this be cast upon the faithful People of God in that day, who were in Society formerly with him? Or should the Crime of the incestuous Person at <HI>Corinth,</HI> because of him, be cast upon all other <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ristians</HI>? If this be not equal, (as all sober men will say, it is not equal) it is no more equal, but abominably injust, to throw the Crimes of <HI>Tho∣mas Case,</HI> or his Crew, upon the honest People called <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akers,</HI> of whose Society and Spirit they are not. And the said <HI>Increase Mather</HI> may with the same Impudence, charge all the abomi∣nable Heresies of the <HI>Mamchees, Nicolatians, Eb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onits,</HI> and all others upon the <HI>Christians,</HI> be∣cause all went under that general Name of <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> in these days. And these of <HI>Case</HI>'s Crew, they call themselves <HI>Christians,</HI> and so doth <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> doth it therefore follow, that their Crimes on that only account should be charged upon him? Let him see how he can answer to these things, or any of his Brethren,
<PB N="222" REF="000472_0232_0FA6752614A73370"/>
or Kindred for him, in his absence. It wanteth to be insert in his Book, that what hath befallen him of late, is a remarkable Judgment of God upon him, for his Injustice to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and his unjust charging the Innocent with the Crimes of the Guilty. Nor is his last Story, concerning one <HI>Robert Churchman,</HI> living at <HI>Balsham</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI>-Shire in Old <HI>England,</HI> related by <HI>H. Moor,</HI> of any more weight or validity, to dis∣credit the Religion or Profession of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> then the former. Why? the said <HI>Churchman</HI> had only some inclination to be a <HI>Quaker,</HI> (but we do not find in all the Relation, that ever he was a professed <HI>Quaker,</HI> and owned by that People) and some Whimsies, or Fancies did take him in the Head for some time, that he supposed he was inspired with the Spirit of God, and that the Spirit of God did speak in him; And at last, it appeared that it was not really so, but that the man was under some mistake, or delusion, or suppose a real poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of the Devil, or was mad: What can all this say in the least, to discredit the <HI>Quakers</HI> Religion, or Principle? Have there not been mad People, and whimsical, both of the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and <HI>Independent</HI> Churches? Yea, doth not <HI>Increase Mather</HI> relate how, that <HI>Ann Cole</HI> of <HI>Hartford</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> that was esteemed a godly and gracious Woman, and I suppose a Member of some <HI>Independent</HI> Church, or <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> otherwise it is not like he would have so com∣mended
<PB N="223" REF="000472_0233_0FA67528A89A4980"/>
her, that she was really bodily possessed with the Devil (see his fifth Chapter) but this doth not infer, that either the <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> or <HI>Independent</HI> Profession of Religion, by <HI>Increase Mather</HI> his own Judgment, is of the Devil; Yea, and some belonging to their Churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> have very lately been convicted of Witchcraft at <HI>Boston.</HI> It cannot be denyed, but that Madness, and melancholly Whimsies and Fancies, may befall some of all Professions, cal∣led <HI>Christians,</HI> the causes of which are best known unto the Lord. But it is altogether un∣manly and inhuman, as well as Unchristian, to charge these things upon the whole Profession. We have always asserted it, that it is one thing to profess to be led by the Spirit of God, and another thing to be really and in deed led by it. We are not ignorant how many have both said and done very bad things, under a pretence of being led by the Spirit of God, and of having the Spirit to be their Rule; and yet this is no Argument against the leading and rule of the Spirit of God, no more than it is an Argument against the Scripture, that many have done bad things, and pretended they have had the Scrip∣ture to be their Rule in what they did; as in the late Wars, in Old <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> when they rose up against the lawful Authority, wherein many both <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and <HI>Independents</HI> were concerned, they all did pretend they had the Scripture to be their Rule in what they did;
<PB N="224" REF="000472_0234_0FA6752A004E6E20"/>
and yet surely, the Scripture was no Rule nor warrant unto them in these bad Practices. The leadings of the true Spirit of God are known, both by the first Motions, and also by the Effects and Fruits that follow after; and that is <HI>to deny all Vngodliness</HI> and <HI>Vnrighteousness,</HI> and <HI>to live Soberly,</HI> and <HI>Godly,</HI> and <HI>Righteo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly in this present World,</HI> and to follow, and be found in doing whatsoever things are <HI>true, honest, just, pure, vir∣tuou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and <HI>praise worthy,</HI> and <HI>of good Report</HI> a∣mong these who have a spiritual Ability to judge of things that differ, as too many have not. And we are well assured, that the Spirit of God ne∣ver teacheth, nor leadeth any to think, say, or do what is contrary to the declared Will of God in the holy Scriptures, nor to that holy and righteous Law, that is writ by the Finger of God upon the Hearts of men universally, which is the substance of the Decalogue that God writ upon the two Tables of Stone. And we readily grant, that who-ever pretend to follow the Spi∣rit of God, to be their inward Guide and Rule, should be very cautious and wary, lest the evil Spirit that doth, and can transform himself into many Likenesses, but always short of the Truth, step in and deceive. But there is a most sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and sure way for every one, to be sure, that they are not deceived, and shall never be, in any matter of moment, and that is for every one to be faithful unto God in these moral Du∣ties, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r things which they know in∣fallibly,
<PB N="225" REF="000472_0235_0FA6752A19776CA8"/>
and are generally agreed upon by all <HI>Christians,</HI> to be good things, for such have the Promise of God, that they shall be preserved from being deceived. And whereas the said <HI>In∣crease Mather</HI> hath writ so many remarkable Judgments of God, that have come upon noto∣rious Offenders, on purpose to record them in Print; and that he saith, Cap. 11. <HI>We may not judge of men meerly by outward Accidents, which be∣fall them in this World,</HI> &amp;c. And some Lines af∣ter, he saith, <HI>Nevertheless a Iudgment may be so circumstanced, as that the displeasure of Heaven is plainly written upon it in legible Characters</HI>: And in this he saith true▪ but he should have added, that such men who can read the same, must not be blind, but have the true Eye opened in them, otherwise they will make a wrong Construction of these things. There wants to be inserted, or added to his Book the many signal and manifest Judgments of God, that came upon the People of <HI>New-England</HI> in general, and upon divers perticular Persons, the main actors, for that horrible Persecution they raised against that ho∣nest People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and putting to death four of the Lord's Servants, for which the Name of these Actors and Abettors, are a stink over many places of the World: And of these Judg∣ments in general, the <HI>blasting of their Wheat</HI> gene∣rally ever since they put our worthy Friends to Death at <HI>Boston</HI>; and the <HI>Indian</HI> Wars that soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter followed, whereby many <HI>English</HI> were de∣stroyed;

and after that, but of late Years, a dreadful Visitation of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> called by some the <HI>black Pock,</HI> that cut off very many, both at <HI>Boston,</HI> and elsewhere, of which they were fore-warned by a Woman that came from <HI>Bar∣badoes,</HI> and went into some of their Meetings, with her Face all made black, for a Sign of what was coming upon them, she being one of these People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and owned by them in that very Testimony, which she declared, she was moved by the Lord to come from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to bear among them, her Name being <HI>Margaret Brewster,</HI> to which may be added, the taking away their Charter, and Power (which they so grosly abused, in turning the Sword against the Innocent) one cause of which was their perse∣cuting the <HI>Quakers</HI> unto Death, and the mani∣fest Judgments of God that came upon divers perticular Persons, notorious Persecutors of that innocent People, are very observable, as Major <HI>Adar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> who joyned in passing sentence of Death against some of these Servants of the Lord who suffered Death at <HI>Boston,</HI> who not long after was killed with a Cow; and that <HI>Horton,</HI> Preacher at <HI>Boston,</HI> a great Persecutor, who dyed suddain∣ly, as he was walking in his House after Sermon, and Captin <HI>Davenport,</HI> another great Persecutor, who was killed with Lightning. And though the said <HI>Increase Mather</HI> doth relate the suddain Deaths of both these men, he altogether omitteth these great Circumstances, of their being great

Persecuetors; the which omission, whether it was wilfully in him, or not, I shall not deter∣mine. But it is the more memorable, that the said Major <HI>Adarton,</HI> being warned before-hand, of the Judgment of God, he made light of it, as I was informed by some in <HI>New-England,</HI> who had the Relation of it, from some that did so warn him, being of that persecuted People. And also it is very memorable, how one of these persecu∣ted Servants of the Lord, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> did plainly fore-tell, <HI>That the House of Governor</HI> In∣dicot, a greater Persecutor, <HI>should be left desolate, and become a Dunghill</HI>; as did accordingly come to pass, and hath been observed by divers, to have been a real Prophecy, divine Justice and Provi∣dence did so bring it about. There are many other Instances and Examples might be mention∣ed, some of which I refer to <HI>George Bishop</HI> his Book, called, <HI>New-England Iudged,</HI> to be there read and considered. I shall only add one passage mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which I was informed of, and had it writ from some of the People of <HI>Barnstable,</HI> how that from an honest man, a <HI>Quaker,</HI> in the Town of <HI>Barnstable,</HI> were taken four Cows, with some Calves, the <HI>Quaker's</HI> Name being <HI>Ralph Iones,</HI> who is yet alive; and these Cattle were taken away by the Preacher of that Town, his Son-in-law, who had married his Daughter, and returned to the Priest as a part of his Wages. The Priest sent to <HI>Ralph Iones</HI> to tell him, <HI>He might have two of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> returned to him, if he would send for them</HI>: But
<PB N="228" REF="000472_0238_0FA6752C54A270B0"/>
he never sent, and so the said Priest used them, and disposed of them as his own, killed one of the Calfs, and sent a part of it to his Daughter, that lay in Child-bed; she no sooner did eat a little of the Calf, but fell into a great trouble, and cryed, <HI>Return home the man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Cows, I hear a great noise of them</HI>; and so dyed in that trouble. The Priest alledged the <HI>Quakers</HI> had betwitched his Daughter, although it cannot be proved, that ever they had any business with her. But to what evil Construction will not Malice, and Hypocri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and Covetousness bend a thing? Some time after the said Preacher killed some of these Cows, to be eat in his House, saying, <HI>He wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld try if the</HI> Quakers <HI>could bewitch him</HI>; and not long after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dyed, even before the Flesh of these Cows were all eat. The passage is so fresh in that Town, that it is acknowledged by divers of the Neighbours to be true: And as great havock was made upon thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> honest Man, and upon many in <HI>Sandwich,</HI> a neighbouring Town, and in many other places, so mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h more might have been expected, had not their Violence been res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rained by the King's granting an Indulgence to all tender Consciences</P>
<P>Next, as to <HI>Samu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Norton,</HI> in his Book, called <HI>New-England</HI>'s <HI>Memorial,</HI> pag. 157. he chargeth the <HI>Quakers</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and damnable Doctrine in the following perticulars. 1. <HI>That the holy Scriptures were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> man, nor a se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tled and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe.</HI> The which charge is false; for we have granted, that the

Scriptures are a Rule of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife, &amp; so we do still, and the best outward Rule that can be found: but we say, they are not the only Rule, nor, being com∣pared with the inward Rule of God's holy Spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are they above it, but inferior and under it, and ought only to be used in Subordination to it. And if the Scripture were the only Rule, as our Adver∣saries say, then all poor <HI>Heathens</HI> should have no Rule, nor Law, and consequently no Sin, nor Judg∣ment, which is false. And we deny not, but the Scriptures are a means of our enlightning, as God the Father of Lights, is pleased to cause his Light to shine unto us in our Hearts, in the seri∣ous a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d faithful hearing, reading and meditating on the Scriptures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but not otherwise, even as the Air, or Windows of a House, are means of letting in the Sun's light to us; but if the Sun shine not, neither the Air nor Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dow can give us light. 2. <HI>That they denyed the Manhood of the Lord Iesus Christ, and affirmed, that as Man he is not in Heaven.</HI> This is a notoriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Charge, which they can never prove: An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Trea∣tise in several places, I have given a large Testi∣mony to the Man Christ Jesus in Heaven; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how he is the Object and Foundation of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣stians</HI> Faith, as <HI>the Mystery of his coming in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Death</HI> and <HI>Sufferings,</HI> &amp;c. is inwardly opened, re∣vealed and applyed by the holy Spirit in men's Hearts. 3. <HI>That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y deny the Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> This is also a most f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lse charge, which they can never prove: but because we deny their car∣nal

Conceptions of the Resurrection, and hold us to Scripture-words, which is most safe, therefore they have so belyed us. And for the more satis∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of the Reader, I refer him to a little Book called, <HI>The Principles of Truth,</HI> published by some noted men of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in which Book it is expresly affirmed, <HI>That we</HI> (to wit, the <HI>Quakers</HI>) <HI>believe, that the same Body which is laid down, shall be raised up at the Resurrection of the Dead, as much as a natural Body, can be the same with a spiritual Body, or an earthly Body can be the same with a heavenly Body, according to the Scriptures Testimo∣ny; it is sown natural, but raised spiritual, and the Glory of the Heavenly is one, and the Glory of the Earthly is another.</HI> And this may may satisfie any sober enquirer; And <HI>Paul</HI> writing concerning the Resurrection of the Dead, saith, <HI>That is not fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st which is Spiritual, but that which is Natural,</HI> (or Animal) <HI>&amp; afterwards that which is Spiritual,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.46. and vers. 49. <HI>As we have born the Image of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, we shall also bear the Image of the Heavenly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> He that readeth, let him understand.</HI> 4. <HI>That an absolute Perfection in Holiness, or Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>attainable in this Life.</HI> 5. <HI>That they placed their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tification upon their Patience, and Sufferings for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nions, and on their righteous Life</HI>; both which are grosly false Charges, and the contrary of which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> showed in this Treatise at length in their prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> places. 6. <HI>They allowed not, nor practised any civil Respect to Magistrates, Parents</HI>▪ &amp;c.

other ways sufficient whereby to show both our Civil and Christian Respect to Magistrates and Parents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (without either doffing the Hat, or cringing) and that both in Words and Je∣stures.
