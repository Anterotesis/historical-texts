<L>IS this the once fam'd mistress of the north?</L>
<L>The sweet retreat of freedom? dearly pur∣chas'd!</L>
<L>A clime matur'd with blood; from whose rich soil,</L>
<L>Has sprung a glorious harvest.—Oh! my friend,</L>
<L>The change how drear! the sullen ghost of bondage,</L>
<L>Stalks full in view—already with her pinions,</L>
<L>She shades the affrighted land—th' insulting soldi∣ers,</L>
<L>Tread down our choicest rights; while hoodwink'd justice</L>
<L>Drops her scales, and totters from her basis.</L>
<L>Thus torn with nameless wounds, my bleeding country</L>
<L>Demands a tear—that tear I'll freely give her,</L>

<L>Oh! Brutus, our noble ancestors,</L>
<L>Who liv'd for freedom, and for freedom dy'd:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="013063_0004_0F8FF8F5B36DC198"/>
Who scorn'd to roll in affluence, if that state</L>
<L>Was sicken'd o'er with the dread name of slaves:</L>
<L>Who in this desart stock'd with beasts and men,</L>
<L>Whose untam'd souls breath'd nought but slaugh∣ter—</L>
<L>Grasp'd at freedom, and they nobly won it;</L>
<L>Then smil'd and dy'd contented, Should these heroes,</L>
<L>Start from their tombs and view their dear possessi∣ons,</L>
<L>The price of so much labor, cost and blood,</L>
<L>Gods! what a pang 'twould cost them; yes, they'd weep,</L>
<L>Nor weep in vain. That good old spirit,</L>
<L>Which warm'd them once, would rouse to noble actions.</L>
<L>E're they would <HI>cringe</HI> they'd bathe their swords in blood;</L>
<L>In heaps they'd fall, and on the pile of freedom,</L>
<L>Expire like heroes, or they'd save their country.</L>

<SPEAKER>Brutus.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! Cassius, you inspire a noble passion,</L>
<L>It glows within me, and every pulse I feel,</L>
<L>Beats high for glory.—I sprang, and Oh! it fires me,</L>
<L>I sprang from men, who fought, who bled for freedom:</L>
<L>From men, who in the conflict laugh'd at danger:</L>
<L>Struggl'd like patriots, and through seas of blood,</L>
<L>Waded to conquest.—I'll not disgrace them.</L>
<L>I'll show a spirit worthy of my fire.</L>
<L>Tho' malice dart her stings;—tho' poverty</L>
<L>Stares full upon me;—tho' power with all her thun∣der,</L>

<L>You're not alone—there are, I know, ten thousand,</L>
<L>Ne'er bow'd the knee to idol power—Repeated in∣sults</L>

<L>Whose blood has long creep'd sluggish thro' his vains,</L>

<L>We have lately seen a piece of pageantry,</L>

<L>The period dawns, when all those parricides,</L>

<L>Oh! patriots rouse. The distant branches lop'd;</L>
<L>The root now groans—let not the thought of <HI>power,</HI></L>

<L>'Tis not a <HI>conquest,</HI> merely, leads to fame—</L>

By all that blood, that precious blood they spilt,</L>

<L>By life—by death—or still to catch you more,</L>
<L>By LIBERTY, by BONDAGE. I conjure you.</L>
<L><HI>All.</HI> Nor is it vain. We swear, e'er we'll be slaves,</L>
<L>We'll pour our choicest blood. No terms shall move us.</L>

<L>Carnage, blood and death, shall be familiar,</L>

<L>HAIL happy day! In which I find my wishes,</L>

<L>The stage is clear. Whatever gilded prospects</L>
<L>E'er swam before me—Honor, places, pensions—</L>
<L>All at command—Oh! my full heart! 'twill burst!</L>
<L>Now patriots think, think on the past and tremble,</L>
<L>Think on that gloomy night, when, as you phras'd it,</L>
<L>Indignant justice rear'd her awful front,</L>
<L>And frown'd me from her—when ten thousand monsters,</L>
<L>Wretches who only claim'd mere outward form,</L>

<L>Broke my retirement—rush'd into my chamber,</L>

<L>The happy period dawns, when thou shall swell</L>
<L>The chair of state, and roll in wish'd for honors—</L>

<L>Of liberty in Servia's free born sons,</L>
<L>Destroy their boasted rights, and mark them slaves:</L>
<L>To ride triumphant o'er my native land,</L>
<L>And revel on its spoils—But hark!—it groans!</L>
<L>The heaving struggles of expiring freedom!—</L>
<L>Her dying pangs—and I the guilty cause:—</L>
<L>I shudder at the thought—why this confusion?</L>
<L>The phantom conscience, whom I've bid adieu—</L>

With life, you largely suck'd the lust of power.</L>

<L>Thy easy flow of passion, happy talent!</L>
<L>Which work'd on unsuspecting minds so strangly,</L>
<L>Push'd on the plan, and pav'd the road to honor.</L>
<L>With this in view, you'd imitate devotion,</L>

<L>While these with transport listned to the tale,</L>
<L>Gaz'd as they heard, and wonder'd how they lov'd</L>
<L>To catch this prize, in what have you not toil'd.</L>
<L>When nature slept, thy busy mind awoke,</L>
<L>And por'd on future scenes, and plan'd thy fate.</L>
<L>Then, when the ties of virtue and thy country,</L>
<L>Unhappy check'd thy lust of pow'r—like Caesar,</L>
<L>You nobly scorn'd them all, and on the ruins,</L>
<L>Of bleeding freedom, sounded all thy greatness.</L>
<L>And what a rich, a glorious compensation</L>
<L>For dangers past—gilded all o'er with pensions,</L>
<L>Here like a mighty deity you sit,</L>
<L>Enthron'd in state, nor envy Jove his thunder.</L>

<L>Mean while at humble distance I pursue,</L>
