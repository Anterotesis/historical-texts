<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Amiableness of Religion in itself, the innumerable Advantages that flow from it to Society in general, as well as each sincere Professor of it in parti∣cular▪ cannot but recommend it to the Choice of every considerate Person, and make even wicked Men, as they wish to die the Death, so, in their more sober Intervals, envy the Life of the Righteous. And indeed we must do the World so much Justice as to con∣fess, that the Question about Religion does not <HI>usual∣ly</HI> ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se from a Dispute whether it be necessary or not (for most Men see the Necessity of doing something for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Salvation of their Souls;) but when is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Time to set about it Persons are convinc'd by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Experience, that the first Essays or Endea¦vours

towards the Attainment of Religion are attend∣ed with some Difficulty and Trouble, and therefore they would willingly defer the beginning such a seemingly ungrateful Work as long as they can. The wanton Prodigal, that is spending his Substance in rio∣tous Living, cries, A little more Pleasure, a little more Sensuality, and then I'll be sober in earnest. The covetous Worldling▪ that employs all his Care and Pains in <HI>heaping up Riches, tho' he cannot tell who shall gather them,</HI> does not fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter himself that this will do always; but hopes, with the rich Fool in the Gospel, to lay up Goods for a few more Years on Earth, and then he'll begin to lay up Treasures in Heaven And, in short, thus it is that most People are convinced of the Necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of being religious some Time or another; but then, like <HI>Felix,</HI> they put off the acting suitably to their Convictions, till (what they imagine) a more conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nient Season: Whereas, would we be so humble as to be guided by the Expe∣rience and Counsel of the wisest of Men, we should learn that Youth is the fittest Season for Religion; <HI>Remember now thy Creator,</HI> (says <HI>Solomon,) in the Days of thy Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth</HI> By which Word Remember, we are not to understand a bare speculative Remembrance, or calling to Mind, (for that, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad Faith, will pro∣fit us nothing) but such a Rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbrance as will con∣strain us to Obedience, and oblige us out of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ati∣tude to perform all that the LORD our GOD shall require of us For as forgeting GOD, in Scripture Language, impl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> a total Neglect of our Duty, in like Manner r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>embring him, signifies a perfect Per∣formance of it: So that, when <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lomon</HI> says, <HI>Remem∣ber thy Creator in the Days of thy Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth,</HI> it is the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me as if he had said, Keep GOD's Commandments; or in other Words, B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> religious in the Days of thy Youth, thereby implying that Youth is the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sea¦son for it.</P>

I SHALL in the following Discourse, <HI>First,</HI> endea∣vour to make good the Wise Man's Proposition imply'd in the Words of the Text, and to shew that Youth is the fittest Season for Religion</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> By Way of Motive. I shall consider the many unspeakable Advantages that will arise from remembring our Creator in the Days of our Youth.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>Lastly,</HI> I shall conclude with a Word or two of Exhortation to the younger Part of this Audience.</P>
<P>AND <HI>First</HI> then, I am to make good the Wise Man's Proposition implied in the Words of the Text, and to shew that Youth is the fittest Season for Religion: <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth.</HI> — But in order to proceed more clearly in this Ar∣gument, it may not be improper, first, to explain what I mean by the Word <HI>Religion.</HI> By this Term, then. I would not be understood to mean a bare outward Profession or naming the Name of CHRIST; for we are told, that many that have even prophesied in his Name, and in his Name cast out Devils, shall not∣withstanding be rejected by him at the last Day: Nor would I understand by it barely being admitted into CHRIST's Church by Baptism▪ for then <HI>Simon Magus, Arius,</HI> and the Heresiarchs of old might pass for re∣ligious Persons, for these were baptized; nor yet the receiving the other Seal of the Covenant, for then <HI>Iudas</HI> himself might be canoniz'd for a Saint; nor in∣deed do I mean any or all of these together, consider'd by themselves: but a thorough, real, inward Change of Nature, wrought in us by the powerful Operations of the Holy Gh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, convey'd to and nourish'd in our Hearts, by a constant Use of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Means of Grace, evidenc'd by a good Life, and bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit.</P>
<P><PB REF="004448_0006_100D9DA45F6AF030"/>THE attaining this real, inward Religion, is a Work of so great Difficulty, that <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> a learned Doc∣tor and Teacher in <HI>Israel,</HI> thought it altogether im∣possible, and therefore ignorantly asked our blessed LORD, how this Thing could be? And <HI>truly</HI> to rectify a disord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd Nature, to mortify our corrupt Pas∣sions, to turn Darkness to Light, to put off the old Man, and put on the new, and thereby to have the Image of GOD reinstamp'd upon the Soul, or in one Word, to be born again, however light some may make of it, must, after all our Endeavours, be own'd by Man impossible. 'Tis true, indeed, CHRIST's Yoke is said to be an easy or a gracious Yoke, and his Bur∣then light; but then it is to those only who have been accustomed to bear and draw in it. For, as the wise Son of <HI>Syra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> observes,
<Q>At first Wisdom walketh with her Children in crooked Ways, and brings them into Fear; and torments them with her Discipline, and does not turn to comfort and rejoyce them, till the has try'd them and proved their Judgment.</Q>
— No; we must not flatter ourselves, that our depraved Na∣tures can be renewed, unless we submit to a great many Difficulties The spiritual Birth is attended with its Pangs, as well as the natural: For they that have experienc'd it, (and they only are the proper Judges) can acquaint you, that frequent Acts of Self-denial must be exercised, a constant regular Discipline kept up, lest, after all, when we come to the Birth, we should want Strength to bring forth.</P>
<P>BUT if 'these Things are so,' if there are Difficul∣ties and Pangs attending our being born again, and Discipline must be called in, what Season more proper than that of Youth; when, if ever, our Bodies are robust and vigorous, and our Minds active and coura∣geous, and consequently we are then the best qualifi∣ed to endure Hardness as good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST·</P>
<P><PB REF="004448_0007_100D9DA7CE8FA940"/>WE find in secular Matters People commonly ob∣serve this Method, and send their Children abroad among the Toils and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tigues of Business, in their younger Years, as well knowing they are then fittest to undergo them And why do they not act with the same Consistency in the grand Affair of Re∣ligion? Because, as our Saviour has told us, <HI>the Children of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rld are w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r in their Generation, than the Children of L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>secondly,</HI> if pure Religion and undefiled con∣sists in the total R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>newal of our corrupted Natures, then 'tis not only a Work of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficulty, but of Time: For, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not, so neither is the new Creation compleated in a Day. No, good Men know, by certain Experi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, that it is a long while e're old Things can pass away, and all Things become new in them. The strong M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n arm'd has gotten too great Possession of their Hearts to be quickly driven out, and they are obliged to combat many a weary Hour, e'e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Corruptions, which is the Armour in which the strong Man trusted, be wholly taken from him. Nay, they find their whole Lives short enough to perfect the Work of Regeneration, which they were sent into the World to do, and never expect to say, 'tis finish'd, till with their blessed Master they bow down their Heads and give up the Ghost.</P>
<P>AND, if this be the Case▪ if the Renovation of our Nature be not only d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficult, but requires so long a Space to compleat it in; then, it highly concerns every one to set about it betimes, and to <HI>work their Work while it is Day, before the Night cometh, when no Man can work.</HI></P>
<P>COULD we, indeed, live to the Age of <HI>Methuselah,</HI> and had but little Business to employ ourselves in, we might then be more excusable, if we made no other Use of this World, than, what too many do, <HI>take our Pastime therein</HI>; but since our Lives are so
