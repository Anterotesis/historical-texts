<HEAD>THE LIFE and DEATH OF Old Father <HI>IANUS,</HI> The vile AUTHOR of the late <HI>Wicked COURANT.</HI> A SATYR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAREWELL, old JANUS, since at last thy Doom,</L>
<L>Which some have fear'd, but more desir'd, is come;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="002758_0002_0FE623A86AF61F88"/>Who in thy Life wast deem'd a Publick Pest,</L>
<L>And whom bright Fame shall restlesly molest:</L>
<L>The Smart you've giv'n to Vice, each Wound de∣clares,</L>
<L>And now thy mangled Name shall pay th' Arrears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou impudently didst, with open Mouth,</L>
<L>In Presence of great <HI>Error,</HI> plead for <HI>Truth</HI>;</L>
<L>With trait'rous Rage, for injur'd Justice fight,</L>
<L>Rather than roundly swear that Wrong was Right.</L>
<L>What tho' your Voice for <HI>Liberty</HI> was rear'd,</L>
<L>With your own Rules your Practice interfer'd;</L>
<L>For, when some only wanted <HI>leave</HI> to sin,</L>
<L>Thou, like a cruel Tyrant, <HI>rein'd</HI> them in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft you presum'd to check the lawless <HI>Rake</HI>;</L>
<L>And from the <HI>Proud</HI> their flaunting Folly's take:</L>
<L>And yet, O Shame! thy self too proud to bend,</L>
<L>By sordid Arts, to buy a faithless Friend.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="002758_0003_0FE624021AA28AE0"/>Stiff in the Right, a thriftless Fool remain'd,</L>
<L>While prudent Flatt'rers veer'd with every pros∣perous Wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How often hast thou treacherously reveal'd</L>
<L>Those <HI>shuffling Tricks,</HI> which long had slept con∣ceal'd?</L>
<L>Not a clean Piece of mystick Knav'ry done,</L>
<L>But thou must sound it round the wond'ring Town;</L>
<L>Till thro' your Zeal, is barb'rously betray'd</L>
<L>The gainful Secrets of the cheating Trade.</L>
<L>Baseness unparrellel! to bring to Sight,</L>
<L>Things which you knew deserv'd to see the Light!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What harm had sly <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> design'd,</L>
<L>That in your Scrolls the <HI>Fair</HI> shou'd be arraign'd?</L>
<L>That you should cry her down in every Street,</L>
<L>And make the World believe she was a Cheat?</L>
<L>When all can say, that view her artful Dress,</L>
<L>She only differs from th' Upright, in <HI>Grace.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="002758_0004_0FE624089BA93510"/>
<L>Still to provoke, your Magick rais'd a <HI>Glass,</HI></L>
<L>Which made each Villain hate his <HI>own dear Face</HI>:</L>
<L>And while in Sight your pois'nous Arrows flew,</L>
<L>In base Disguise you skulk'd from publick View;</L>
<L>That when the Guilty, whom your Rancour strook,</L>
<L>Roar'd for Revenge, they knew not where to look.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when inspir'd by Night, some rambling Fool,</L>
<L>On Mischief bent, resolves to fight by Rule;</L>
<L>With a dark Lanthorn's overpow'ring Blaze,</L>
<L>On our confounded Sight he rudely plays:</L>
<L>Out flies a Cudgel from behind the Light▪</L>
<L>We struggling feel the Blows, but know not whom we fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long you disturb'd the <HI>jovial Sinners</HI> Sports,</L>
<L>And, with bold Front, besieg'd th' Imperial Forts.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="002758_0005_0FE623B17B91C950"/>Witness, great BACCHUS, how he charg'd your Troops,</L>
<L>And dar'd t' atttack your Vot'rys at their Cups;</L>
<L>In horrid League with great APOLLO join'd,</L>
<L>To break your Empire, and improve the Mind.</L>
<L>Then rush'd presumptuous on our Ladys <HI>Hoops,</HI></L>
<L>And sunk their Int'rest low with amorous <HI>Fops</HI>:</L>
<L>While some were with his sawcy Satyr stung,</L>
<L>That only lash'd the Vertuous with their <HI>Tongue.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When persecuted <HI>Wit</HI> forsook the Press,</L>
<L>He dar'd the beauteous Suff'rer to caress;</L>
<L>And with Politeness oft in Custom's Spite,</L>
<L>Was known, vile Wretch, to walk in open Light.</L>
<L>But, what inflames his Guilt, he wrote good Sense,</L>
<L>Yet never at the <HI>College</HI> did Commence;</L>
<L>And like a Felon, stole a loftier Fame,</L>
<L>Than some that in the List can show their Name.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="002758_0006_0FE5F45BF5EBCD70"/>Nor did those Wreaths which round his Temples bloom,</L>
<L>In th' honest Way of learned Dullness come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Those baffled <HI>Bards,</HI> who once triumphant reign'd,</L>
<L>Were by his Wit in barb'rous Silence chain'd.</L>
<L>He tore the Lawrel from great HERWICK'S Brows,</L>
<L>And wou'd refined Poetry impose;</L>
<L>But, Ah! no Thanks to him, our Climate better knows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All that had felt th' Impressions of his Teeth,</L>
<L>Were forc'd to pray with Veh'mence for his Death;</L>
<L>Convinc'd, that till the scribling Foe was dead,</L>
<L>There's not a Vice would love to rear its Head.</L>
<L>Kind <HI>Av'rice</HI> grip'd, in Hopes his Fate to bring,</L>
<L>And famish'd <HI>Envy</HI> lent her blunted Sting.</L>
<L>But, midst their sweet Repast, Old JANUS teems</L>
<L>With unsuspected Spite, and guileful Schemes;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="002758_0007_0FE6240A51411188"/>Till all was ripe, then stretch'd beyond their Reach,</L>
<L>And left them nibling round his DYING SPEECH.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, vext with Fleas, the <HI>Fox</HI> to save his Blood,</L>
<L>Contrives Deliv'rance from some neighb'ring Flood:</L>
<L>Softly he sails from Shore, then gently dives,</L>
<L>And on a Woolly Ark, the rav'nous Vermin leaves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Therefore adieu! No more shall impious Strolls</L>
<L>Be pain'd to practice o'er thy vertuous Rules.</L>
<L>Now may th' imperious Wife the Breeches claim,</L>
<L>And Husbands sna<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le without deserved Blame:</L>
<L>With Nonsence Fraught, shall Jinglers swarm the Town,</L>
<L>Like Rats and Mice, when once the Light's with∣drawn:</L>
<L>The Golden Days of Ignorance return,</L>
<L>And <HI>Wit,</HI> like JANUS, meet with gen'rous Scorn.</L>
