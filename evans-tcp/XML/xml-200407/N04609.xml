<P>AN ADDRESS To the INHABITANTS of NORTH-CAROLINA; OCCASIONED By the difficult Circumstances the Govern∣ment seems to labour under, for Want of a <HI>Medium,</HI> or something to answer in lieu of Money; for the Encourage∣ment of the People, in regard to Business: To which is added, A PROPOSITION for a <HI>Paper-Currency,</HI> whereby the Possessors of the Soil may, in a very honourable Manner, and with cheerful Hearts, discharge their Quit-rents and publick Taxes: And whereby, also, new Life may be given to Trade and Commerce, so far as is necessary; which will be a natural Inducement to the fair Trader to settle and re∣side in the Government, as well as the only Means to propagate Navi∣gation (that necessary Branch of Business) in all its proper Parts.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is evident. That Mankind is liable to fall into many Casualties, and meet with grievous Misfortunes, in travelling through a howling Wil∣derness, by taking indirect Measures and following wrong Courses: And would it not be high Ingratitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f not a gross Sin in any M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, who seeing his Neighbours in immin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Danger, on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of a Desert, even almost arrived at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ink of Destruction, and not call earnestly to them, and labour hard to inform them of right Ways, in which they might travel with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Safety?

<P>It is gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rally allowed, That from the Liberties of <HI>Magna-Charta,</HI> all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree-born Subjects to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> have a native <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, not only to think their own Thoughts, but to speak freely also in all Cases, Matter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to their own Affairs, whether Publick or Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

grievous Hurt of many of the Commonalty? However, let that terminate as it may, what is past cannot be revoked; nor can Yest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rday be recalled: But does it not now (especially at this Juncture) highly behove the Inhabitants, to shape better Courses, and take more direct Measures, respecting a <HI>Medium,</HI> for publick Uses, as well as for Trade and Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, lest the Government be reduced to the lowest Poverty, exposed to op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and appear ridiculous and scandalous in the Eyes of its neighbouring Gov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, and the Commonalty be destroyed in their In∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rests?

And when a Method is prescribed for the on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, doubtless it may serve for the other also.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, some may query, What Proposal can be made, whereby the King shall be honourably tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted, in Regard to his Quitr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> Oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, per∣haps, will answer and say, Let us rate our Manuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, in Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to pay our Quit∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts and publick Charges: But if it is possible to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scribe some r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Method, to pay our Quitrents in Gold or Silver, according to Pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, Will it not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n be a gross Imposition, to pay the King his Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, with our lumb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring Commodities? And to say, we will make him Amends, by und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvaluing our Labour, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t him have our Commodities at a low Rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: Pray what will all this amount to, but a bur∣thensome and base Imposition upon the Inhabitants, and the on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Way to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hearten the People, and give the Government, on each Hand, the Advantage over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>? And will it not, also, have a direct Tendency to discourage the further Settlement of the Country? Which all must allow will not be very consistent with the King's Inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, as well as for the common Advantage of the Province.</P>
<P>If this be the distressed State of <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> for want of a proper Currency, or useful <HI>Medium,</HI> whereby every Man may be enabled (honourably) to discharge his Duty to his King, in Respect to his Quitr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts, as well as to promote Trade and Commerce (that necessary Article) in the Government, let it be well considered and examined into, Whether a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Emission of Pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Bills cannot be made useful to relieve the Inhabitants in their Distress, when all the former Emissions have had a Tendency, rather, to lead the Commonalty into further Intanglements, and to ag∣gravate their Punishment? Let it be now examined into, Whether a new Emission of Bills cannot be projected, that shall afford them Relief. Cannot a Scheme be cal∣culated for a Paper Currency that shall circulate freely, and be serviceable, in com∣mon, to the Inhabitants, both gentle and simple, and not be liable to be hoarded up in Chests and Coffers, and hid in Holes and Corners, and in the End be made a Trap and Snare to the Commonalty? To which may be answered, Yea; as may more fully appear, by a Scheme h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to annexed. Have not the Commonalty a na∣tive Right (according to the <HI>Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> Establishment) to hear, see, think, speak, and act, rationally, for themselves? Is not the General Assembly of <HI>North-Carolina</HI> constitut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from Home? Does it not consist of three Branches, <HI>to wit,</HI> Governor, Council, and House of Burgesses, in Representation of King, Lords and Commons, in <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> If so, Are not then the House of Burgesses, in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> one Branch of the Legislature? Are they not elected, to that Service, by the major Vote or Voice of the Commonalty? Are they not thus appointed, by each several

County, in the Province, to give due Attendance at the General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssembly, there to appear, as Eyes for the Commonalty, as Ears for the Commonalty, and as Mouths for the Commonalty? And, as they are thus sent forth, as it were, with the Lives and Liberties of the Commonalty in their Hands, to represent and serve the Com∣monalty, in carefully guarding the Country, that no unwholsome Laws be inad∣vertently made, that may prove burthensome and destructive to the Inhabitants; how ess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntially necessary is it, then, for every honest-hearted Burg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, to think free∣ly, and speak freely, in Behalf of the Commonalty, as he is in Duty bound, and, if possible, to suffer no inadvert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Proposal whatsoever, to be passed into a Law, that may in any wise be hurtful to the Commonwealth? And how vile must all such Burg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses appear, in the Eyes of every honest-hearted, thinking Man, who, for sinist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Views and Self-interest Sake, will betray so great a Trust? And inasmuch as there is too great an Aptness in Man, to be warp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and swayed by Self-interest and sinister Views; how essentially necessary is it therefore, for every of the Com∣monalty, to a Man, in every County, to be exceeding thoughtful and more than common careful, for the future, in the Choice of their Burgesses? For let it be con∣sidered; Is there any Man made a Burgess, till he is elected and created a Burgess by the Commonalty? Is it not then the Commonalties immediate Concern and Business, to elect Men, who seek to be strictly just in their Principles, who will la∣bour faithfully, also, to serve their King and Country▪ with Integrity of Heart, in Matters of so great Consequence as are c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmitted to their Charge? Let it be con∣sidered further, also; Can a legal General Assembly be held in the Province without a proper Set of such Burgesses? Is not the House of Burgesses one Branch of the Legislature, without whom no authentick Law can be enacted or made in the Go∣vernment? If the Case be so, let it again be considered; If wild St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rage be made in the Province, whose Door then do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Fault lie at? Does the Fault lie at the Governor's Door, who represents the King's Person, and sits in General Assembly, waiting to give his Assent to all wholsome Laws that are enacted, having the Con∣currence of both Houses? Let Charity be extended to the Governor; let him be excused. Is it owing then to the Council or Upper House? If it is known that the Misfortunes and heavy Burthens the Commonalty labours und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re owing to them, Why then are they not tax'd with it? Or is it not owing rath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to the Weak∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, Simplicity, and Folly of the Commonalty themselves, whose Right and Pri∣vilege it is, to nominate and appoint the whole House of Burgesses, who are a House of Instruments created by the Commonalty, to give Attendance in the Ge∣neral Assembly, in the Commonalties Stead and Place; there to act in all Matters and Things redounding to the King's Inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and the Commonalties Good? Now if the Commonalty neglect this great Privilege and Point of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r Duty, are they not then grossly to blame? If the Commonalty, instead of voting for M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of In∣tegrity, who have the Good of the Country at Heart, will vote for selfish Men, who, with private Views, are seeking in every Shape, privately to milk and gull the Commonalty, to advance their own private Interests; are not the Commonalty then much to blame, when instead of carefully chusing judicious Burgesses, who will labour faithfully to serve them in their Str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ights and Difficulti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and strive hard to relieve them in their Distress, do perhaps care and make Choice of heavy Task-Masters, who lord it over them? And what shall be said then in this Case? Does it
<PB N="4" REF="005726_0007_0000000000000000"/>
not evidently appear▪ That it is chiefly, if not altogether, owing to the Though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Conduct of the Commonalty, whether they move forward or go backward, whether they stand still, or whether they entirely fall? How highly then does it be∣hove them to double their Diligence, as in Duty bound, for the Interest of their King, the Promotion of his Country, and for their own Good? Can it be supposed there are any, who (knowing the miserable and distressed State the Commonalty la∣bours under) when a solid Proposition is made in General Assembly for the Country's Relief, that will presume to discourage or strike a Death to it, except it be such who are empty or void of Wisdom, Honesty, and common Humanity; even such whose vi∣cious Inclinations move them to think, that by keeping the Commonalty in a State of Poverty and Distress, they may have the greater Opportunity to gull Mankind, reach∣ing, in their Imaginations, after the Fat and the Fleece, when the poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heep, by being kept to short Meat, are not able to get it? Which has also a direct Tendency, not only to sink the Value of the Government and destroy its Prosperity, but it ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s also, in the End, to frustrate all such Men in their vicious Views and Mistaken Notions, of acquiring Honour and Int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rest to themselves; and by their avaricious and mean Way of Thinking and Acting, they may be instrumental to reduce the Government and themselves also, to a low State of Poverty and Shame. Wherefore let it be duly considered, whether it is not a Duty incumbent upon the Commonalty, when they have elected their several Burgesses, to caution them strictly to obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve, that when∣ever a Proposition is offer'd in General Assembly, in Behalf of the Publick, that nothing be acted thereon, either for it or ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst it, but what shall be expos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to publick View in Print, whereby the Commonalty, whose Right it is, may be satis∣fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, who are seeking the King's Interest, and the Commonalti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Good, and who are (in their mistaken Imaginations) seeking their by-Ends, and pursuing their own selfish Views. With what Abhorrence ought all such selfish Burgesses to be looked upon, whose Actions, and plausible Projections and Schemes, have a direct Tendency to the Downfal, Disgrace and Shame of any People? Whereas, on the other Hand, every honest, sincere-hearted Burgess, that leaves all selfish Views, and seeks the com∣mon Good of his fellow Creatures; whose Labours, Projections and Schemes, have a Tendency to teach Frugality and promote Industry, is worthy of double Honour; without doubt it will be allowed on all Hands, that to propagate and promote In∣dustry in the Province will redound to a publick as well as a private Good, which if wisely order'd, in a publick Manner, will produce all Manner of Necessaries of Life, so far as the Soil and Climate will bring forth: And this Thing called Industry, or Labour, with the Produce of it, must be allowed to be the Foundation and main Wheel of all Trade and Commerce: All which, if prudently entered upon, and honestly pursued, may be a Means to advance the King's Interest, by rendering his Government more valuable, and make the Commonalty a happy People; but if the Foundation Work is never properly laid, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Wheel in Trade and Com∣merce never set a going, how can it be expected the Buildings shall ever go forward, or that the smaller Wheels and lesser Movements shall ever go round to a publick Advantage?

<P><PB N="6" REF="005726_0009_0000000000000000"/>The foregoing being left to your Consideration, it may not be amiss to say something <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>specting a <HI>Paper Currency</HI>; That is to say, on what Footing it may be most proper to put it forth, and how it may be most carfully improved, for the King's Int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st as well as for a publick Benefit, since every common Capacity knows, or may know, that by taking wrong Paths, or indirect Measures, Mankind is led into Difficul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, if not to entire Ruin; which, in Order to escape, let the fol∣lowing Ideas or Comparisons be solidly considered off:</P>
<P>Admit there were two wealthy Housholders, having, each of them, many Sons and others of the Houshold, and each of those Housholders put forth a Quantity of Bills of Credit, for each of their Families Use and Service; the first Housholder f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnishes his Sons, and others of his Houshold, with their several <HI>Quotas</HI> thereof upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, making the said Bills their Mark and Cent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, by obliging them to pay in a∣gain the same Bills of Credit, with Interest, except they will redeem them with the Produce of their Labour at a very under Price; in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>smuch then the said Bills will answer in li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u of their Labour, which they for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>know must go at an under Price: How natural is it therefore, for those Sons and Servants of his, to turn Idle-packs, by jockeying, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rking, and perplexing each other, that by any Means they may procure said Bills, to discharge their Obligations, rather than to lie under the Name or Notion of a Disadvantage? The one, perhaps, in his Streights, sells a Plantation, and another a Yoke of Oxen, the Third a breeding Mare or Cow, under a Notion of getting those Bills of Credit; which Manner of trafficking and trifling away their Time, neither adds to their Lands, nor increases their Cattle, nor cultivates the Earth; the Consequence of which is, that what the one gets, the other must loose: And by thus neglecting their proper Business, their Houshold comes to Poverty and Shame.</P>
<P>But the other Housholder, wisely considering, that Food and Raiment were all that they wanted to support this Life, and inasmuch as Bills of Credit had no intrin∣sick Value in themselves, and, of Consequence, would be of no Service, except they were made to answer in lieu of Money, to make an even Ballance between Neigh∣bour and Neighbour, for proper Utensils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to encourage Industry, whereby to procure Necessaries of Life; he therefore, neither obliged them, nor yet encou∣raged them, to pursue those Bills of Credit, (as pursuing Birds in the Air) neither did he make those Bills their Mark or Center, which, when caught, afforded them neither Food nor Feathers; but wisely made the Necessaries of Life their Mark, and Gold and Silver their Center; obliging them to bring in the said Necessaries of Life, at their just Value, whereby the Houshold were plentifully and cheerfully fur∣nished with the Comforts of Life, and all were encouraged together.</P>
<P>Well, if this be a proper Comparison, that conveys any Idea, is it not Time then to consider well of what is already written, together with the Tendency of it? and also of the great and mighty Handy-works of the Creation, which are evident to our View, and may teach to any People Knowledge? It is evidently seen that all Sorts of Creatures, of what Kind soever, have, in some Sort, a Scrabble in the World to live and support their Species; some Beasts, in the Wilderness, feed upon Grass, and other Herbs, and some upon other Fruits of the Earth; the Catterpiller spins her Webb on the Oak or Apple Tree, and depends for Food on the Leaves thereof, which come by Nature, (without any Cultivation or Propagation of their
<PB N="7" REF="005726_0010_0000000000000000"/>
own) and they often times eat themselves out and peris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; some Sort of Birds find Use for Hair and Feathers, to build their Nests, others make Use of Sticks; the fishing Hawk is diligent (after her Kind) to get Fish for the Support of hers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf and Specie; the Eagle, we may observe, is very dexterous, also, to look out sharp, tho' not with any View of lending the industrious Hawk a helping Hand, lest they shou'd both come to Poverty and Want; but the brightness of her View is only to take away what is already caught.</P>
<P>In a peculiar Manner, we may behold the industrious Bees; it may be observed of them, that so soon as they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uietly hived and got settled, and not confused in their own Government, they immediately set to work with Courage, and gather their Wax, and draw Honey from almost all Sorts of Flowers: We may obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve also the Toad, which is an Annimal that often lies partly hid under Ground, whose na∣tive Food is Worms, Flies, and Fleas; notwitstanding which, at Times, they will hop round those Hives of Bees, and when they find them engaged in their Wax and Honey, they are so avaricious and hungry after them, (whether by Instinct or ill Habit I leave) that without any Thought how, or wherewith they shall be sup∣ported for the future, they make those industrious Bees their Prey; and those Bees, with their Honey in their Bowels, (when eaten by them) altho' extracted from spaci∣ous Flowers, yet it's the Nature of that under-ground Animal to convert it to Poison, yea, of a poisonous Quality to all those who suffer their Hands to partake thereof or their Heads to be infused with it: And it is even further worth our Ob∣servation, that when diligent Bees multiply and swarm, the young Swarms, natural∣ly incline to assume to themselves their native Manner and Form of Government; notwithstanding which, many of them (through Loss of their native Guide or Want of proper Aid) get shatter'd, confused, and become useless in the Creation, even unworthy of Notice, although surrounded with rich and spacious Flowers: How apt are such ill-governed, shattered, and confused Swarms (for want of regular Guides to lead them in a native and free Manner) to grow lazy, contentious and quarrelsome? In and amongst such Swarms, Strife is often created, (no doubt with some seeming, though rude, Authority) whereby they are prompted, in an angry Humour, to sting, poison, and kill each other, to the total Destruction and Over∣throw of themselves, even in their own Hives. Now, were it given to those Bees (which are created innocent in their own Nature) to conceive and see clearly, that the Reason of their lazy, indolent, contentious, and quarrelsome State, was owing to a poisonous Disposition in their unnatural Guides, by which they have suffered th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mselves to be govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; and could see also, it's poisonous Quality, how nearly resembling the Toad, that converts all h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nds with his Mouth to Poison: How natural is it to conclude, that those disordered and misled Swarms would be surprized at their own State and Condition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd be ready to fly for Shame, with Abhorrence of their past rude Conduct, and consult better Measures, to establish their Hive in a peaceable and better Settlement for the future.</P>
<P>But Mankind (the most noble of all in the Creation) seeing the Weakness and Frailty of all those Creatures, it may be reasonably thought and expected of and from them, That they will act upon more rational Principles, in getting the Neces∣saries of Life, and supporting their Specie in the World, than either the dumb Beasts of the Field, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lighty Fowls of the Air, or the creeping Insects which crawl upon the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005726_0011_0000000000000000"/>And is it not evident also to our View, that when a Hive of Bees are not shattered nor confused amongst themselves, but having regular Guides to aid them in a pru∣dent Manner, How mutually do▪ they proceed in their Business? whose Interest is inseparable, they being depend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t one on another, in regard to the Preservation and Support of each other; all being engaged and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ployed in their proper Work, to the mutual Advantage of their little Community.

In order that it may be so, I am willing (if it may be so received) to cast in a Mite, in some proper Structure or Building, furnished with all necessary Proposals, founded upon Reason, that may invite the Governor, Council, and House of Burgesses to view it; tending strictly to the mutual Benefit and Welfare of the Province of <HI>North-Carolina</HI>; having due regard to the King's Honour and Interest therein, which consists in the Pros∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity and flourishing State of his Kingdom and People.

(if rightly considered) is, that those Bills of Credit (if wisely negociated) will ter∣minate to the furnishing the publick Treasury with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n equivalent Sum, in Gold and Silver, to redeem them; and they also, in the mean Time, be a Means (gradually) to introduce a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vely Trade in the Government; which will admit of a Growth, and may, eventually, be far more valuable to the Province, that ten Times the Value given it from far, which will as evidently appear hereafter.</P>

Now if this Hundred Thousand Pound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Bill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Credit aforemention∣ed, (which in themselves are of no Valu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may have a Tendency to furnish the tran∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt Traders, and all Buyers and Sellers in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovince, with a wholesome and safe <HI>Medium</HI> in their Trade and Commerce, and may tend also to enable the Government to introduce, carry on, and support a lively Trade, according to the provincial Scheme afore described; and out of their Nothingness, may tend (with prudent Ma∣nagement, in a reasonable Run of Years to enrich the Province with One Hundred Thousand Pounds in Gold and Silver, (which in itself has an intrinsick Worth,) therefore I query; If this Proposition were set on Foot, and was thus to opperate, to the enriching the Government a Hundred Thousand Pounds, in a reasonable Run of Years, pray, who then has the Inhabitants of the Province been at work for? Hath it not been for themselves? Is it not evident, that they borrow the Money of themselves? Do they not set themselves up in the World upon their own Founda∣tion, even upon the Value and Credit of their Lands; and by one Consent have improved those Bills to their own Advantage, without Use or any other significant Incumbrance, saving only the Charge of making them; which is paid also out of the same Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cie?</P>
<P>Thus, the Author is of Opinion, It may be clearly seen, that the Province of <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> from its miserable State of Poverty, (saving the solid Soil, which is immoveable) may not only provide itself with a credible <HI>Medium,</HI> to stand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast and steady in its Value, but may thereby raise itself up in the World, and be enabled to build on a right Foundation; even first of all, in their Business at Home; secondly, on a proper Bottom, for Navigation, Trade, and Commerce Abroad; and save themselves from the vast Charge of supporting Navigation, in the Neighbouring Governments, at the Expence of the Inhabitants of <HI>North-Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>Hence may also be seen, on due Consideration, That the Streams formerly men∣tioned, which are running out on every Hand, to the impoverishing both Publick and Private, may, by this Scheme, (if honestly pursued and improved) be turned and brought home, proportionably, to every of our Doors; whereby the Welfare of the Country may be credibly recovered, to the Honour of the King, and to the common Comfort of all the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>And further to evince, That such a Scheme, improved in such a Manner, would have such a Tendency; the following explanatory Accounts are formed, under a Supposition, that a Hundred Thousand Pounds were granted, by Act of Assembly, as aforementioned; and that Ten Thousand Pounds, of the same, were alotted as a proportionable <HI>Quota,</HI> to be negociated by an Agent or Trustee in <HI>Craven</HI> County, for the Account, common Benefit, and Use of the Province of <HI>North-Carolina</HI>; and the Formation of the aforementioned Accounts is introduced by an Account

<P>Now, if this be the good Effects of negociating and turning One Thousand Pounds, in <HI>Craven</HI> County, Pray, let it be considered, That as this is but One annual Tenth of what is negociated in the Province; the Treasury, then of Consequence, will be fur∣nished or supplied, from the sev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral Counties in the Province, with Ten Thousand Pounds, for every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive Turns in Trade; and will have good in its Favour at every five Turns in Trade aforesaid, Two Thousand Four Hundred and Twenty Two Pounds Fifteen Shillings and Ten Pence in Bills of Credit.</P>

<P>And on the other Hand, it is said, That Sugar, by the small Quantity, is sold from 4 to 8 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound; which being reduced, at Six for One, is 2 to 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound, our Money: Melasses is said to be sold, from 16 to 18 <HI>d. per</HI> Gallon, by the Hogshead; which being reduced, at Six for One, is 8 to 9 <HI>s. per</HI> Gallon, our Mo∣ney: Thus it may appear, by a reasonable Computation, to any Eyes, except they are blind, and to any ones Understanding, except it is stupified, that what Sugar the Inhabitants of <HI>New-York</HI> expends in their Families, at 2 to 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound, our Money; we cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the same in our Families here▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 5 to 7 <HI>s.</HI> and 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound, in ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; and so, in like Mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, what Melasses they expend in their Families, at 8 to 9 <HI>s. per</HI> Gallon, our Money; we must expend the same in our Families here, at 25 to 30 <HI>s. per</HI> Gallon, in our Way of Trade, or otherwise go without it.

<P><PB N="23" REF="005726_0026_0000000000000000"/>Well, if the Case be so, pray consider then, What does all this amount to?

Is not this proper Business for you? And that you weightily consider those Affa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, and as carefully pursue proper Remedies?

Or is it not rather, so far inconsistent, with a ratio∣nal Idea, that the Labourer is obliged to work upon such Terms, the Effects whereof, will hardly purchase him wherewith to cover his Nakedness, unless the Employer suffer Loss? I appeal to your own Consciences, Is not the State of the Government even such?

What Encouragement is this; to introduce Foreigners for the further Settlement thereof? Or, How shall a poor Man be able to support his Family, or comply with his Landlord, for his Rents? Or be they not so poor, in common, for Reasons before-mentioned, that they become rather a Charge to him▪ Which Way, in the Uni∣verse, can you think, that the Inhabitants (excepting such as join upon the other Governments) shall be able to discharge themselves, even of their Quit-r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts, &amp;c. and carry on their other Affairs on such heavy and discouraging Terms and Con∣ditions as the Government of the Province now stands?

<P><PB N="25" REF="005726_0028_0000000000000000"/><HI>Firstly,</HI> I would propose, That an Agent or Trustee be appointed (by a Majority of Votes) in each County, to provide suitable Store-houses for Merchandize.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Each Tithable to bring in (annually) for a Term of Years, such a Part of the Produce of his Labour, as you may, discr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tionally, think to be sufficient to supply the Inhabitants with foreign Necessaries.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Let the Agent or Trustee afore-mentioned, for each County, be autho∣rized to receive the Produce, aforesaid, from each Tithable, in such as shall be good and merch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntable, and of the Manufacture of the Province, suitable for a foreign Market, and at such Prices as the same Commodities are (in common) sold for, at <HI>Philadelphia, New-York,</HI> or elsewhere, for Money of equal Value.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Let these Agents or Trustees be so qualified and furnished with Instruc∣tions, That (as they receive those annual Tithables, in Country Produce, as afore∣said) they have Orders to exchange or barter the same away, to and with any Ship Masters and Merchant Traders, as shall or may import suitable Goods and Mer∣chandize into the Government, always observing, duly, to contract with said Ship Masters and Merchant Traders, that such a Proportion of the Pay, for the said Country Produce, as you may think proper, be in Silver and Gold, and the other in Goods and Merchandize by Wholesale, agreeable as it is purchased in the Go∣vernments afore-named, for the Account and Benefit of the Publick, even such Goods and Merchandize as may be adjudged the most suitable for the Use and Ser∣vice of the Inhabitants; and when the said Goods and Merchandize are so pur∣chased by the Agents or Trustees, that they be impowered further to deliver to every of the Inhabitants (in Proportion to their Tithables) the said Goods and Mer∣chandize, at prime Cost, as purchased by the Agents or Trustees aforesaid, as also their Proportions of Silver and Gold; reserving only a certain <HI>Quota</HI> or Proportion, for defraying the Charges of Commissions of Porter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, &amp;c.</P>
<P>By thus negociating Trade and Commerce, in a publick Manner in the Govern∣ment, for a certain Term of Years, I humbly conceive, that by a reasonable Com∣putation it will appear, that fifty Pounds, then, will be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r more valuable to each In∣habitant, than an Hundred Pounds is now.</P>
<P>For whereas, in our present Manner of trafficking, when the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> can ex∣pend Sugar in their Families, at Two to Four Shillings <HI>per</HI> Pound our Money, we must, at same Time expend it in our Families, at Five to Seven Shillings and Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound; and when the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> can expend Melasses in their Fami∣lies, at Ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht to Nine Shillings <HI>per</HI> Gallon, our Money, we must at same Time expend it in our Families, at Twenty Five to Thirty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Gallon; and when the <HI>New-Yorkers</HI> can purchase Salt, at Twelve to Eighteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Bushel, we (in our wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and rude Manner of trafficking must purchase the same here, at Thirty to Forty Shillings; and even so it is, in some Proportion, with all other Goods and Merchandize; and when they defray their Charges of clearing their Lands by then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mber, we must be at an immence Charge to burn it in Heaps.</P>
<P>Now, admit the Query was put to the Inhabitant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> Man by Man, whether they would chuse to remain in the perplexed State and Condition they are now in, in respect to Trade or Commerce, as well as in regard to paying their Quit-rents and publick Taxes, &amp;c. Or whether they would chuse, rather, to be taxed Five, Ten, or Twenty Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI>▪ to promote such a Trade as
