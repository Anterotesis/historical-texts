<P>THE following Reply to Mr. <HI>Bryant's</HI> Letter of Remarks, would have appeared in Print much sooner than it does, if I had been determined to have written any thing of this Nature, upon my first receiv∣ing it; But, finding it filled with Railery instead of Reason, for some time I did not know but it would be for the best, to let it pass as unworthy of publick Notice: However, at length (with others) thinking it might be for the Glory of God, to make some Reply to it, I wrote what is here offered to publick View. — Yet after it was written, it lay by me several Months before I was fully determined to pub∣lish it to the World. This, I hope, may be a sufficient Excuse for its appear∣ing so late.</P>

<HEAD>A REPLY, &amp;c. To Mr. <HI>BRYANT.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Beginning of <HI>Iune</HI> last, I received and read your <HI>Letter</HI> to me, containing <HI>Remarks</HI> on my Sermon: And cou'dn't but observe, you talked something more <HI>orthodoxly</HI> (if the Word may be used with any Pro∣priety, in Relation to either of your Per∣formances) as well as more craftily in this, than you did in your <HI>Sermon:</HI> which occasioned me to think whether mine had not produc'd some <HI>good Effect,</HI> and brought you to a <HI>better Understanding.</HI> However, one Thing was <HI>clear</HI> to me, by your <HI>sly</HI> but <HI>harsh Reflections</HI> in it upon me, <HI>viz.</HI> that you were very <HI>angry</HI> with me, for preach∣ing and printing the <HI>Truth,</HI> in Opposition to your <HI>Errors.</HI> But why did it put you into such a Heat, Sir? Were you not angry <HI>without a Cause?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006764_0005_0000000000000000"/>You say (REM. pag. 27.)
"We are all agreed in the divine Right of <HI>private Iudgment.</HI>"
i. e. We may all <HI>think</HI> for our selves: And pray, why not <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>print</HI> too as there may be Occasion? Has not one of the youngest Sons of <HI>Iohn Calvin</HI> (as you call me) as good a Right, by the Press or Pulpit, to publish <HI>Truth</HI> to the World, as you, one of the young Seed of <HI>Iames Arminius,</HI> have to preach and print <HI>Errors? Errors</HI> (I say) condemn'd almost universally by Protestants, by the Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> by the Churches of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> and by innumerable learned and godly Divines, from the Reformation down to this Day; and as I ap∣prehend, by the Scriptures themselves, the Oracles of God. Let the World judge.</P>
<P>I freely own, that when I studied my Sermon and preached it to my own People, I had no View to a further Publication of it: but only designed to guard them, whose Souls I desire always to <HI>watch for, as One that must give an Account,</HI> against the Errors contained in your's (printed and dispersed among us) which there, according to my Apprehension, appear very barefac'd, and without their usual Masque. But having preach'd it in <HI>Braintree</HI> at the Request of some People there, a Copy for the Press was desir'd by the Hearers; to whose Importunity, after much Reluctance, I at length yielded.</P>
<P>And since you have been so free, in the Vindication of <HI>your Self</HI> and <HI>Error,</HI> as to take it under your Considera∣tion, and make some <HI>friendly Remarks</HI> on it, as you stile what you have done; you will doubtless allow me to be so free, in the Vindication of <HI>my self</HI> and the <HI>Truth,</HI> as to make as friendly a Reply to what you have written. However, 'tis but what you might reasonably expect: For <HI>ab alio expectes alteri quod feceris.</HI></P>
<P>And what I have to say, I shall range in the following Order.</P>
<P N="1">1. I will <HI>compare Notes,</HI> to see if in Fact it be as you say; <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>that upon comparing Notes it would be found, there is <HI>no Controversy</HI> between us, only in opening the <HI>Text.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="006764_0006_0000000000000000"/>2. I will say something in Favour of <HI>my Arguments,</HI> and shew that they <HI>stand good,</HI> notwithstanding what you have said to invalidate them.</P>
<P N="3">3. I will inquire whether you sufficiently prove <HI>your self</HI> to be a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> and <HI>me</HI> to be <HI>not one,</HI> in opening the Text.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to <HI>compare Notes,</HI> that we may see if your Ob∣servation be just, as to the Difference between us.</P>
<P>You say (REM. pag. 9.)
"There is <HI>no Controversy</HI> between us, only in opening the <HI>Text.</HI>"
But if what you say be true, I have really a much meaner Esteem of my Sermon than ever; and can't in that Case but seriously wish, it might be buried in perpetual Oblivion. How∣ever, "<HI>saying</HI> and <HI>proving</HI> differ," you observe. (REM. <HI>pag.</HI> 11.) And I confess, 'tis easier Saying, than Prov∣ing: Doubtless <HI>you</HI> thought so in the present Case: for you roundly <HI>assert,</HI> that if <HI>Notes</HI> were <HI>compared,</HI> there would be found <HI>no Controversy</HI> between us only in open∣ing the <HI>Text</HI>; but don't so much as attempt to <HI>prove</HI> your Assertion, by selecting Passages out of each Ser∣mon, which stand in the most <HI>seeming Opposition,</HI> and <HI>reconciling</HI> of them: No, not the least Appearance of this— And you was very <HI>subtle</HI> in taking the Method you have done; tho' I fear, not very <HI>honest:</HI> for 'tis beyond your Skill (Mr. <HI>Bryant</HI>) and the Skill of all your Counsellors and Assistants, to <HI>reconcile</HI> the two Sermons, which go upon two Schemes so opposite and inconsistent. You can as easily unite the two Poles, or reconcile Light and Darkness.</P>
<P>But tho' <HI>you</HI> did not see it in your Way, and for your Honour, to <HI>compare Notes,</HI> I see it is in mine, and think it but just in me to do this; since you have in a Sort put me upon it, and especially since this <HI>comparative View</HI> of Things may serve very much to open the Eyes of those who are too apt to take Things upon Trust, and to imagine there is really <HI>no Controversy between us,</HI> but about the Meaning of one single Passage of Scripture, only because <HI>you,</HI> with an Air of Assurance, tho' with∣out a Shadow of Reason, say this is the Case.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006764_0007_0000000000000000"/>Now that we may have the clearest View of the <HI>Dis∣agreement</HI> and <HI>Opposition</HI> of the two <HI>Sermons,</HI> I will select some Passages out of each, and set them in two Columns, <HI>opposite</HI> to one another.</P>

<P><HI>Good Works</HI> are not to be looked on, or considered as the <HI>Cause</HI> of the Justifica∣tion and Salvation of Man; but only as the <HI>Fruits</HI> and Effects of <HI>Iustification,</HI> and a <HI>Part</HI> of the <HI>Salvation</HI> pur∣chased by Christ.</P>
<P>That Men are not justify∣ed and saved for any thing <HI>wrought in</HI> or <HI>done by</HI> them <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (i. e. <HI>that the whole of Salvation is of free Grace</HI>) SER. pag. 22, 23.</P>
<P>That when Persons are justified, the <HI>moral</HI> Image of God, lost intirely by the Fall, which consists in Knowlege, Righteousness, and true Holiness, is <HI>restored</HI> and reinstamped on the Soul <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that they are naturally and NECESSARILY incli∣ned to obey the <HI>moral Law</HI> in all its Precepts. (SER. pa. 15.)</P>
<P>The justified by Christ's Righteousness have seen God to be infinitely lovely in himself <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that they do <HI>love</HI> him, and CAN'T but love him intirely, and above every other Object. (SER. pag. 16.)</P>
<P>That such a <HI>Friendship</HI> subsists between God and his People as can <HI>never</HI> be broken — And they have the Word and Oath of God that they <HI>shall be kept,</HI> and at length actually put into Possession of heavenly Glories. (SER. pag. 28, 29.)</P>
<P>That the <HI>wedding Gar∣ment,</HI> of which you read in the Gospel; and the <HI>fine Linnen white &amp; clean</HI> in the Revelation, principally in∣tends

the Righteousness of <HI>Christ,</HI> and not the <HI>personal</HI> Righteousness of Men. (SER. pag. 14.)</P>
<P>I do thro'out <HI>my</HI> Sermon (omiting here to transcribe particular Passages at length) clearly hold forth, so that he that runs may read, and which indeed was the main Design of it, That the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of CHRIST is the Merit and <HI>Matter</HI> too of a Sinner's <HI>Iustification</HI> in the Sight of God— That Men are justi∣fied <HI>without Works</HI> — That the best Works of the best Men have <HI>no Hand</HI> in the Affair of Justification, as the <HI>Merit</HI> or <HI>Matter</HI> there∣of — That <HI>full</HI> Satisfaction has been made to the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Iustice</HI> of God for the elect World by <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> — That a holy <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> are a <HI>Part</HI> of <HI>Sal∣vation,</HI> and not the <HI>Cause</HI> thereof in any Shape what∣ever.</P>

<P>That when Men hear of our being <HI>saved by Grace,</HI> they conceive of it so, as to destroy all <HI>moral Agency</HI>; and set themselves down with this vain Tho't, that Nothing on their Part is <HI>necessary</HI> to Salvation, but if they are designed for it, they shall be <HI>irresistibly driven</HI> into Heaven, whe∣ther they <HI>will</HI> or no. (SER. pag. 7.)</P>
<P>That when Men medi∣tate on the <HI>unchangeable Love</HI> God bears <HI>good Men,</HI> they make this groundless Inference, that <HI>they</HI> are <HI>un∣changeable</HI> also. (SER. ibid.)</P>
<P>That 'tis a Doctrine na∣turally tending to <HI>Licenti∣ousness,</HI> for any to say, that the Believer is already in such a State of <HI>Salvation,</HI> as that his final Happiness is as certain as if he was now in the actual Possession
<PB N="6" REF="006764_0009_0000000000000000"/>
of it. (SER. pag. 25, 26.)</P>
<P>That the <HI>wedding Gar∣ment</HI> in the Gospel, and the <HI>fine Linnen white and clean</HI> in the Revelation, is the <HI>personal</HI> Righteousness of Men. (SER. pag. 15, 16.)</P>
<P>You (Sir) in <HI>your</HI> Sermon do affirm, that our <HI>whole</HI> Happiness is <HI>suspended</HI> on our <HI>personal good Behaviour</HI> and patient Continuance in Ways of <HI>Well-doing.</HI> (SER. pag. 7.)</P>
<P>From hence [<HI>i.</HI> e. <HI>from the common Notion, that the</HI> Text designs the <HI>Righteous</HI>] this odious Character of <HI>filthy Rags</HI> has been trans∣ferred to the moral Attain∣ments of Men under the Gospel, and the Righteous∣ness of the most improved Christian hath been gene∣rally spoken of as no better a Qualification (even ac∣cording to the merciful Te∣nour of the Gospel, and considered as the CONDI∣TION of that final Happi∣ness, which is in the Hands and at the Disposal of Jesus Christ, who according to the good Pleasure of the supream Father of all is consti∣tuted the only Mediator between God and Man) no bet∣ter a Qualification, I say, in this mediatorial and infi∣nitely gracious Scheme, to appear before God with <HI>Ac∣ceptance,</HI> than <HI>filthy Rags</HI> are to dress and adorn the Body for a Visit to the King and Court on Earth.

<HEAD>Mr. <HI>BRIANT'S</HI> Notes.</HEAD>
<P>That <HI>personal</HI> Righteousness is the Condition of all God's Favours; —It opens all the Stores of Heaven. (SER. pag. 20, 21.)</P>
<P>To speak freely, I confess, I never yet saw with what Face a Man can pretend to exhort others to the Practice of Righteousness, who is constantly telling them, per∣haps in the same Breath, that <HI>all their Righteousness,</HI> when they have obtained it, will be nothing but <HI>filthy Rags.</HI>
"God is already satisfied in all his Demands, his Law, his Honour, his rigorous relentless Justice, are all satis∣fied, and there is nothing left for Man to do,"
but to believe this undoubtedly, and the more surely, the less Grounds he has for it, to rely upon it, that he is righte∣ous, and shall be accepted as such:
"The Believer indeed may, if he pleases, out of meer Generosity, add Works of Righteousness of his own, but there is no real Need of it; for his main Interest is secure without it."
He is already in such a State of Salvation, that his final Hap∣piness is as certain as if he was now in the actual Posses∣sion of it. The plain Truth of the Case is this; Either our Righteousness is of some Use &amp; Significancy in the Affair of our Salvation, or it is not. Either it has some Connection with, and actual Influence on our Happiness, or it is of no real Necessity as to us. (SER. pag 25, 26.)</P>
<P>All those who decry <HI>moral Vertue</HI>—as a Thing of <HI>no Avail</HI> towards the obtaining the divine <HI>Favour,</HI> and the Privileges and Rewards of Christianity, do in Effect subvert the very fundamental Principles both of natural and revealed Religion. (SER. pag. 29, 30.)</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>Now (Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>) the Sum of what I have quoted from you, I think, any one that does not shut his Eyes, must see, is necessarily this, <HI>viz.</HI> That our <HI>whole Hap∣piness</HI> is suspended on our own <HI>personal Righteousness</HI> — That <HI>personal Righteousness</HI> is the Condition of our Justification, and that wherein Man may appear before God with Acceptance— That <HI>personal Righteousness</HI> opens all the Stores of Heaven—That the Law, Honour,
<PB N="8" REF="006764_0011_0000000000000000"/>
and Justice of God are not so fully satisfied already by Jesus Christ, but that there is something left for <HI>Man</HI> to do by Way of Satisfaction—That Man's main Interest is not secure without he performs this Part of satisfying Work— That <HI>personal Righteousness</HI> is of some Use and Signifi∣cancy in satisfying the Law and Justice of God, and so in appeasing the divine Wrath, and procuring Salvation.— In a Word, that <HI>personal Righteousness</HI> will obtain for us the divine Favour.—Such mighty Things it will do: and yet, amazingly strange, you say, there is <HI>no Merit</HI> in it: And you challenge me and all my Attestators, to point out one single Passage in your Sermon, where the Doctrine of Justification by the Merit of Man's perso∣nal Righteousness is asserted, or from whence it can by good and necessary Consequence be inferred.</P>
<P>If (Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>) you really are, what you pretend to be, and don't feign your self a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> then I think, when you say, there is <HI>no Merit,</HI> you must intend to be understood in a sound <HI>Calvinistical,</HI> and not in a rotten <HI>Arminian</HI> Sense. But if only the <HI>latter</HI> be your Intent, namely, to exclude <HI>Merit</HI> in no other Sense than the <HI>Arminians</HI> do (who reject, perhaps with as much Dis∣pleasure as you can, the <HI>Papists</HI> Doctrine of Merit of <HI>Condignity,</HI> tho' at the same Time harmonizing well enough with them in their Doctrine of Merit of <HI>Con∣gruity</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Papists</HI> say, One must <HI>dispose</HI> and <HI>fit</HI> himself by <HI>Faith</HI> (i. e. Assent to the Gospel) <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>good Works,</HI> to partake of CHRIST. This they call <HI>Meritum ex Congruo.</HI>— And is not this the Doctrine of <HI>Arminians</HI>; and the Doctrine of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> when he says, that Forgiveness of Sins thro' the Merits of Christ is upon the Condition of Faith, Repentance, and good Living? Pray, what is the Difference between the <HI>Papists</HI> saying, that we must fit our selves to partake of Christ, by Faith, Repen∣tance and good Works; and Mr. <HI>B's</HI> saying, that Faith, Re∣pentance and good Living are the Condition of Forgiveness of Sins thro' the Merit of Christ? So that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> will find it a difficult Task to clear himself of this <HI>Popish</HI> Merit of Congruity.</NOTE>) what is then become of your <HI>Calvinism?</HI> And how will you clear your self, when <HI>Calvinists</HI> charge the Doctrine of <HI>human Merit</HI> (at least in some low Sense) upon you?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006764_0012_0000000000000000"/>What, Sir, is there <HI>no Merit at all</HI> in that, upon which our whole Happiness is suspended! <HI>No Merit</HI> in that, in which we can appear before God with Acceptance! <HI>No Merit</HI> in that, which opens all the Stores of Heaven! <HI>No Merit</HI> in that, which satisfies the Law and Justice of God, at least in Part! <HI>No Merit</HI> in that, which obtains the divine Favour! Certainly <HI>your Expressions</HI> concern∣ing the Efficacy and Benefit of the <HI>personal</HI> Righteous∣ness of Men (which appear as strong as those commonly used concerning the Righteousness of <HI>Christ</HI> himself) do strongly insinuate and imply some kind of <HI>Merit</HI> in Man's personal Righteousness; whatever was the Inten∣tion of <HI>your Heart</HI> in using them: and upon a more careful Review of them, Sir, I believe, you might see it, as well as others. However, while they stand as they do at present, those in the World
"who have Sense enough and will trust their own Facilities so far as to judge in themselves what is Right,"
I believe, will think you did intend by them to recommend the Doctrine of <HI>Merit</HI> (of some Sort) in Man's <HI>personal</HI> Righteousness; and this, notwithstanding you just hint towards the close of your Sermon in a <HI>Parenthesis,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A <HI>Parenthesis,</HI> we all know, only includes something that may be left out in reading, and yet the Sense of the Writer remain intire.</NOTE> that Forgiveness of Sins and final Acceptance with the Father is thro' the Merits of his Son.</P>

a <HI>temporal, national</HI> one.— You explode my Notion of <HI>original Sin,</HI> as vilifying hu∣man Nature, and grounded on misapply'd Scripture-Characters of an abandon'd <HI>People.</HI>—You explode like∣wise my Notion of <HI>Iustifi∣cation</HI> by the imputed Righ∣teousness of <HI>Christ</HI>; and maintain, it is moral Virtue makes us amiable before God, and Forgiveness of Sins is suspended on our own <HI>personal</HI> Righteous∣ness. — So, under the <HI>o∣ther</HI> Heads mentioned, you advance Opinions directly contrary to mine: and in short, the Current of your whole Sermon appears quite opposite to the plain Scope and Tenor of mine.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>This, I apprehend, is a fair Representation of the different Opinions advanc'd in our two Sermons: And yet (Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>) you say very confidently,
"There is <HI>no Controversy</HI> between us, only in opening the <HI>Text</HI>;"
and
"that if I aim at you in the rest of my Sermon, I have miss'd the Mark, and must charge again to do Execution;"
—that
"I have mistook the Man, and been fighting with my own Shadow."
—But surely every un∣byass'd Judge must see, from the comparative View which has been given, that there is indeed a general Controversy between us, extending <HI>throughout our Ser∣mons,</HI> and not confin'd meerly to our opening the <HI>Text</HI>; and so, that I have hit the <HI>Mark</HI>; and by Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Reply to my Sermon, that I have hit the <HI>Man</HI> too.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006764_0014_0000000000000000"/>But, Sir, if after all I should have happen'd to take you wrong, and your Sermon should not really be cal∣culated nor intended to oppose these glorious <HI>Protestant</HI> and <HI>Calvinistical</HI> Doctrines, I will assure you, my Mistake has not been wilful. And I will readily ask your Par∣don, when I am convinced of my Mistake: And let me honestly tell you, I should be exceeding glad to be con∣vinced of it.</P>
<P>And (Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>) if you did not design to contradict and oppose these Doctrines in your Sermon, but did then and do now believe and embrace them in your Heart, you may easily satisfy me and others, only by some seri∣ous and plain Declaration in the next Piece you shall have Occasion to publish, that you did not design any Op∣position to these sacred Truths; but did then and do now believe them, any Thing in your Sermon of a contrary Aspect notwithstanding. — I do (dear Sir) if you can possibly comply, earnestly request this easy, and (I think) reasonable Thing of you: And if you don't gratify me herein, you must allow me to think still, that you do in your Sermon and Heart too really oppose these Doctrines, commonly called the <HI>Doctrines of Grace</HI>; for whoso be∣lieves them with his Heart, I must suppose, will readily confess them with his Mouth, or his Pen.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have fairly <HI>compared Notes</HI> with you: and by this comparative Survey, it may easily be seen, that our Harmony (a strange Kind of Harmony) lies in Discord.</P>
<P>I am in the next Place,</P>
<P N="2">II. To say something in Favour of the <HI>Arguments</HI> I us'd to support my Construction of the controverted <HI>Text</HI>; and to shew, that they remain good, notwithstand∣ing what you have said to invalidate them.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, please to remember that I said,
"The Prophet by the Phrase, <HI>All our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags,</HI> did not <HI>design a Description</HI> of the <HI>hypocritical Perfor∣mances</HI> of some of the <HI>worst</HI> of Men, as some seem to imagine, but the <HI>personal Righteousness</HI> of some of the best."
— SERM. pag. 5.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006764_0015_0000000000000000"/>This Exposition, I said (and I said as I verily thought) might be argued and evidenced from the <HI>Context.</HI> The Context I enquired into as carefully as I was capable of, and found this Chapter a Prayer of the Prophet in the Name of the Church of God, i. e. some of the best Men; and consequently the Text, a Part of it, an humble Confes∣sion &amp; Acknowlegement that <HI>all their Righteousnesses</HI> were as <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> considered comparatively, and especially in Respect of Justification in God's Sight; tho' in other Respects truly good and valuable: Agreable to that parallel Expression or Confession of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> after his Conversion, and so when he had real Righteous∣ness, Phil. 3.8, 9. <HI>I account all Things but Loss &amp; Dung,</HI> &amp;c. Therefore I can assure you, Sir, it was not from the least Suspicion I had in my own Mind (as you insinuate) that the Context would not favour me, that I omitted any Proofs from thence: No, Sir, but partly for fear of being too lengthy; tho' principally because I really tho't that the Arguments the Text contained, and which I offered, were sufficient in Number and Strength to ans∣wer the End.</P>
<P>But you are pleased, not only to find Fault with me for not analysing the Context, but with my Arguments taken from the Text, and to say, there is no Weight in them, and that you and others are astonished at me that ever I should publish them to the World.—But we will review them a little, and examine whether they are in∣deed without any Weight, and so weak and inconclu∣sive, as to afford just Matter of Astonishment to you and your Brethren. What if you should (Sir) reconsi∣der them a little more without Prejudice, and in their proper Light, which I shall endeavour to set them be∣fore you in? This possibly may recover you out of your astonished Frame.</P>
<P>The Thing I laid down to be prov'd (which 'tis needful you, and every other Reader should keep in Mind, to see the Drift and Force of my Arguments) was this, <HI>viz.</HI> "That the Prophet in the Text did not DESIGN A DES∣CRIPTION of the <HI>hypocritical Performances</HI> of some of the
<PB N="13" REF="006764_0016_0000000000000000"/>
WORST of Men, as some seem to imagine, but the PERSONAL RIGHTEOUSNESS of some of the best.</P>
<P>And this Exposition, <HI>i. e</HI> both the <HI>negative</HI> and <HI>positive</HI> Part of it, I said, might be evidenced by Arguments taken from the Text. Three I collected out of it for that End.</P>
<P N="1">1. I took one Argument from the Word <HI>Righteous∣nesses.</HI> —And what I say here, is expressed in these Words, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That if the Words <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Righteous∣nesses</HI> in Scripture, where we have the Character of the Wicked given, perhaps more than a thousand Times, and in a variety of Terms, are never used to intend the <HI>hypocritical Performances</HI> of wicked Men [meaning the very <HI>worst,</HI>] but for something <HI>truly good</HI> and <HI>excellent</HI>; then we must suppose, the <HI>latter</HI> and not the <HI>former</HI> is intended in the Text: and I appeal to you all, whether the Words are not constantly used in this Sense from the Beginning of <HI>Genesis</HI> to the End of the <HI>Revelation.</HI></Q>
—Now, Sir, I did not suppose, that this Argument, exclusive of all Reference to the Con∣text, and of other Arguments taken from the Text, did in any Measure prove the <HI>positive</HI> Part of my Exposition; <HI>viz.</HI> That the Word <HI>Righteousness</HI> here designed the Righteousness of the <HI>best</HI> Men: But the <HI>negative</HI> Part of it, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was not used in a <HI>designed Description</HI> of the hypocritical Performances of some of the WORST of Men, as some seem to imagine. And in this I had my Eye particularly upon <HI>your Exposition</HI> of the Text; which was, that the Prophet here is ONLY confessing
<Q>and lamenting the <HI>aggravated Sins</HI> of the WORST of Men. (SER. pag. 9, 10.) The <HI>Iews</HI> (you say) were at this Time sunk into a wretched State of Degeneracy, even beyond their common Character.—Their Wick∣edness was general and extraordinary. They were al∣most universally of a corrupt Heart &amp; polluted Life— They were <HI>given up</HI> to the most <HI>detestable Immoralities.</HI>— In common Life they practised all Manner of <HI>Villany,</HI> &amp;c.— and all the <HI>Religion</HI> they had, consisted in a few <HI>canting Terms,</HI> and in observing <HI>some external Rites.</HI>—</Q>
<PB N="14" REF="006764_0017_0000000000000000"/>
And upon the whole, you say,
<Q>No marvel then, if this be a just Representation of their Case (and who∣ever consults the sacred History, will find them <HI>vastly worse,</HI> rather than any Ways injur'd by this Character) if their <HI>moral Character,</HI> I say, was at least as bad as I have represented it, no Man can wonder, that the Pro∣phet says—<HI>All their Righteousnesses were as filthy Rags.</HI></Q>
(SER. pag. 10, 12, 13, 14.) Here, Sir, you plainly exhi∣bit your Sentiment, that by the Word <HI>Righteousnesses</HI> is meant, either <HI>aggravated Wickedness,</HI> or at best only a <HI>Religion</HI> that lay in a few <HI>canting Terms,</HI> and the <HI>Obser∣vance of a few Rituals,</HI> exclusive of all <HI>moral</HI> Performan∣ces; they being destitute (according to your Account) of the least <HI>Appearance</HI> of <HI>moral Vertue.</HI>—Now, in Oppo∣sition to this Sentiment of your's, I laid down my first Argument, which I thought sufficient to disprove your <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> tho' it might not so directly establish my own. My Design herein was to shew, that the Word <HI>Righte∣ousnesses</HI> was never used in Scripture to intend "detesta∣ble Immoralities", or "the aggravated Sins of the worst of Men", as your Expressions seem to import; neither was it ever used (as far as I can find) to denote meerly such <HI>hypocritical Performances</HI> as you speak of, namely, the using <HI>a few canting Terms</HI> and <HI>observing a few Rites and Ceremonies of Worship,</HI> while destitute of all moral Vertue; but always intended something <HI>good</HI> and <HI>excel∣lent (materially</HI> so at least) that is, it <HI>chiefly included moral Vertues,</HI> or those Duties which carry in their Nature something of moral Excellency; tho' not excluding <HI>ritual</HI> Observances, in which there is nothing good, ex∣clusive of the divine Institution.</P>
<P>This, I say, is what I aimed at in this Argument, tho' perhaps it is not quite so cautiously or clearly expressed as it might have been: And in this you have no Reason to glory over me, since you your self appear to be equally incautious and confus'd in your Discourse▪ where you express your self so as to make your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, as if by <HI>Righteousness</HI> is meant <HI>Wickedness</HI>▪ tho I would cha∣ritably hope you did not mean <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> But it that was not
<PB N="15" REF="006764_0018_0000000000000000"/>
your Meaning, to be sure this was, that the Word <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> intends no more than a few <HI>canting Terms</HI> and <HI>Rituals,</HI> or the <HI>hypocritical Performances</HI> of the <HI>most im∣moral</HI> and very <HI>worst</HI> of Men. This is what I have de∣ny'd: And I again challenge you to bring <HI>one Text,</HI> from the Beginning of <HI>Genesis</HI> to the End of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> where the Word <HI>Righteousness</HI> is to be taken in <HI>this Sense only,</HI> exclusive of <HI>all moral Services.</HI> I think, I may ven∣ture to say, if you can produce one clear Text to the Purpose, I will give up my first Argument as quite im∣pertinent.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Argument was taken from the Word <HI>All.</HI>— And what I say is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That if there were any <HI>righteous</HI> among the <HI>Iews</HI> at the Time <HI>Isaiah</HI> refers to in the Text, and God always had a <HI>righteous Seed</HI> among them, then the Prophet does stile personal Righteousness <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> when he says, ALL <HI>our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags.</HI> I did think (and indeed I have not seen Cause, from any Thing you have said to the contrary, to alter my Mind) that considering either the <HI>Context,</HI> which is evidently a Prayer of the <HI>Prophet</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Church</HI> of God, or the Term <HI>All,</HI> which may be taken in an unlimited Sense, when it don't contradict the Context or the Analogy of Faith; therefore, I say, I did and do think, that the Prophet did design (at least) all that <HI>pious</HI> Body by the Term <HI>All,</HI> whether he meant to include the <HI>Wicked</HI> in it, or no; and therefore that it contain'd an Argument of some Force in it to my Purpose.</P>
<P>But you, Sir, have seen fit to contradict it: And the Substance of what you say, is this, that I take the Word <HI>All</HI> here in too <HI>unlimited</HI> a Sense: But how do you prove it? Why, you make some Shew of arguing, in several Ways. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. By quoting some Passages of Scripture, where the Word <HI>All</HI> is used only for a <HI>major Part,</HI> and sometimes for a <HI>minor,</HI> which you say that <HI>I</HI> will readily acknow∣ledge. Indeed, Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> I wish you had said also that <HI>you</HI> did readily acknowledge them, in the same Sense as you concluded that I would: but I find you more ready
<PB N="16" REF="006764_0019_0000000000000000"/>
to declare <HI>my</HI> Sentiments, than your own; possibly, be∣cause <HI>mine</HI> will bear the Test better.— But to return, The Sum and Scope of what you say here, if put into Form, lies in this short Argument. If the Word <HI>All</HI> is sometimes used in Scripture for only a <HI>Part (major,</HI> or minor) then it <HI>must</HI> be so used in the <HI>Text</HI> we are up∣on: But we find it so used sometimes <HI>elsewhere:</HI> There∣fore it <HI>must</HI> be so here.— Wonderful <HI>Conclusive!</HI> Admi∣rable <HI>Logick!—Risum teneatis Amici!</HI></P>
<P>This is an Argument (Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>) which if it holds, you may do Wonders with; for by the same Train of Reasoning, you may prove, that the Term <HI>All</HI> is not to be taken in an unlimited Sense any where, in the whole Bible. But this you must know is contrary to Fact. So that what you say on this Head amounts to just Nothing. And of this you your self indeed seem to be sensible, when you make that Concession (REM. pag. 16.)
"I know it will <HI>not follow,</HI> that because <HI>All</HI> is sometimes taken in a limited Sense, that it must therefore be so taken in the Text."
Well Sir, if so, why did you insist on it at such a Length? If you yourself did not think, it <HI>followed,</HI> why would you endeavour, by your long Ha∣rangue, to make your Readers think it <HI>followed?</HI> Some of them, you might be sensible, would not be well able to see into the Justness of Consequences; who therefore might be easily imposed upon by a <HI>Sophism,</HI> and induced to imagine, you said <HI>Something,</HI> when really you said <HI>Nothing</HI> to the Point.</P>
<P>You could not but be conscious (Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>) that my Argument would retain its full Force against you, not∣withstanding all you had said, 'till you cou'd prove that there is a <HI>Parity of Reason,</HI> or equal Ground for restrain∣ing the Word <HI>All</HI> in our <HI>Text,</HI> as there is in the other Texts you quoted. But this you don't so much as at∣tempt: which is a strange Defect, especially in one that pretends to understand so well the Rules and Principles of Reasoning. What could this Omission arise from, but a Conviction of the <HI>Disparity</HI> of the Cases in View? Your first Consideration then may be dismiss'd as a labour'd Impertinency.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="006764_0020_0000000000000000"/>2. Another Thing you offer in Proof of my taking <HI>All</HI> in too unlimited a Sense, is,
"That our understand∣ing the Prophet in this <HI>unlimited</HI> Sense necessarily runs us into a strange <HI>Mixture</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> of <HI>Characters</HI>; putting the <HI>most vicious</HI> upon a <HI>Par</HI> with the <HI>most holy,</HI> in Point of <HI>Acceptance</HI> with their Maker."</P>
<P>Well▪ Sir, and what if my Expressions upon my Argu∣ment taken from the Word <HI>All,</HI> should be so understood, as to set even the most vicious upon a <HI>Par</HI> with the most holy, in Point of <HI>Acceptance</HI> with their Maker; not as to the <HI>Reality</HI> of the Thing, but as to any <HI>Grounds</HI> in them∣selves for it? Would this necessarily run us into a strange Mixture and Confusion of Characters? If so, I think, the Scriptures of Truth themselves run us into a strange Mixture and Confusion of Characters; for they every where do set them upon a <HI>Par</HI> in this Respect, as to any Grounds or Reasons in <HI>themselves</HI> of the divine Favour toward them. Supposing (Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>) a Mi∣nister of Christ should be preaching, to a <HI>mixed</HI> Multi∣tude, consisting of Saints and Sinners (which is no un∣common Case) upon the Doctrine of <HI>Iustification</HI> by Christ thro' Faith alone, and should tell his Hearers that the <HI>Righteousnesses of</HI> ALL <HI>of them</HI> were <HI>as filthy Rags,</HI> in the Affair of <HI>Iustification before God:</HI> Would this at all <HI>confound Characters?</HI> Would this set Saints and Sin∣ners upon a <HI>Par</HI> in any <HI>other</HI> Respect, than in Point of <HI>Iustification</HI> by their own <HI>personal</HI> Righteousness; in which Respect all the Children of <HI>Adam,</HI> Saints &amp; Sin∣ners, are indeed upon a <HI>Par</HI> (tho' you an't willing to allow it) and this, notwithstanding God has of his free and rich Grace found out and revealed the mediato∣rial and infinitely merciful Scheme, you make mention of. Now this is the very Case, Sir: And hence it ap∣pears, there is really no more <HI>Weight</HI> or <HI>Pertinence</HI> in what you say here, than in what you said before; which, by your own Confession, you was sensible was nothing to the Purpose: Nor wou'd it have been any thing but an ingenuous Part in you, Sir, if you had also confessed <HI>this</HI> to have been nothing more to the Point in Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="006764_0021_0000000000000000"/>Besure, there is not, as I can see, the least Shadow of Reason in the Objections you have offer'd, to invalidate my second Argument. But it must be said of you, <HI>Hic homo multa loquitur, sed nihil probat.</HI></P>
<P>I think my Way now clear to proceed to the Defence of my last Argument.</P>
<P N="3">3. A further Argument was taken from the Word, <HI>Our,</HI> in the Text. Which I express'd in my Sermon thus: If any, after what hath been said, suppose the People of the <HI>Iews,</HI> at the Time, were generally, yea, universally abandoned to extraordinary Wickedness and Hypocrisy, yet they won't say, the <HI>Prophet</HI> was; he was a <HI>good</HI> Man, all allow,—and yet this personally righteous Man says, not all <HI>their</HI> Righteousnesses, who were aban∣doned Wretches, but <HI>all</HI> OUR <HI>Righteousnesses,</HI> mine as well as theirs, <HI>are as filthy Rags:</HI> so that the Prophet does mean the personal Righteousness of the <HI>best</HI> Men; and these he stiles <HI>filthy Rags.</HI></P>
<P>The Word <HI>Our</HI> in the Text being an <HI>appropriating Term,</HI> I thought, that the Prophet, when he used it, did <HI>include,</HI> and not exclude, <HI>himself</HI>; and so, that there was some Weight in an Argument taken from this Word, to demonstrate the Point I was upon, and accordingly us'd it for that Purpose. However, I was not then ap∣priz'd, that it ever had been improved for that Purpose by any before me: But am confirm'd in the Propriety and Force of the Argument, since I find by Mr. <HI>Foxcroft</HI>'s judicious Piece upon <HI>Isaiah</HI> 64.6. <HI>&amp; Phil.</HI> 3.8. compared, that the <HI>Protestants</HI> in general have tho't there was some Weight in it, and accordingly improv'd it against the <HI>Papists,</HI> just as I have done against Mr. <HI>Briant:</HI> Nor am I unwilling to keep the <HI>Reformers</HI> good Company, tho' I part with Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s and <HI>Papists.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sir, I might have proceeded to consider particu∣larly what you say to prove the Insufficiency of this Ar∣gument; But as this will be done very sufficiently, I doubt not, in the design'd <HI>Appendix</HI> by one of the Rev. <HI>Attestators,</HI> I shall refer you thither, and wave saying any Thing more to it my self. But will pass to the next general Head propos'd, which was,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="19" REF="006764_0022_0000000000000000"/>III. To inquire into the Validity of the Pleas which you produce to prove your self a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> and me <HI>not</HI> one, in opening the <HI>Text.</HI>—Yet before I come directly to consider your Proofs, allow me to premise one Re∣mark; that if the <HI>Difference</HI> between you and me lay only in opening the single Passage of the <HI>Text</HI>; and you had said, the Prophet intended the <HI>worst Works</HI> of the <HI>worst Men,</HI> but I, that he intended the <HI>best Works</HI> of the <HI>best Men,</HI> I say, had the Difference lain only here, and we had been <HI>harmonious</HI> in other more substantial Respects; I could have heartily subscribed a Letter to you (tho' I per∣ceive, you can't to me)
"<HI>Your Brother in the Faith and Fellowship of the Gospel,</HI>"
for I should have thought you had "<HI>Faith</HI> enough for <HI>Fellowship.</HI>" And it was not that, Sir, I had principally in View in my Sermon, as any one may see who reads it; no, I can truly say it, tho' I thought you was out of the Way in your Exposition of the <HI>Text,</HI> yet this was not the main Thing in your Ser∣mon, which I judg'd to be amiss, and meant some Ani∣madversions upon in mine, but your sly and crafty Op∣position to the <HI>Doctrines of Grace</HI> (distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>Calvinistical</HI>) especially this, that the <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> of Jesus Christ is the <HI>sole Matter</HI> of a Sinner's <HI>Iustification</HI> in the Sight of God.</P>
<P>Now your Opposition to these Doctrines, I think, I have fully shewn under my Head of <HI>comparing Notes</HI>; and so, that you are diametrically opposite to <HI>Calvin</HI> in the most of your <HI>Sermon,</HI> however harmonious with him you may pretend to be in opening the Text. But truly it is pretty strange, that you should be so exactly <HI>Calvi∣nistical</HI> in opening the <HI>Text,</HI> and so diametrically opposite to <HI>Calvin</HI> in the Tenor of your <HI>Sermon.</HI> One would have thought surely▪ that if you had taken the <HI>first</HI> Step so precisely with <HI>Calvin,</HI> you would some where in the rest of your Performance have taken a <HI>second</HI> with him, which I <HI>don't see</HI> you have done. This Conduct, at least, gives some Grounds to suspect your <HI>Calvinism</HI> even in your opening the Text. However, you pretend to be a <HI>Cal∣vinist</HI> so far: and if confident Pretension might pass for
<PB N="20" REF="006764_0023_0000000000000000"/>
Demonstration, the Point would certainly be settled in your Favour. But, beside pretending it, you endeavour to prove it, even by citing <HI>Calvin</HI>'s own Words in his <HI>Commentary</HI> on the Text: Two Paragraphs you select for this End; <HI>viz.</HI> (1)
"Here, there be some that tor∣ment themselves because the Prophet speaking of the <HI>Defilement of Sin,</HI> takes in and represents the Case of all the <HI>Iews</HI> without Exception, amongst whom there ne∣vertheless remained some <HI>pure</HI> Worshippers of God; but <HI>in vain,</HI> and without Cause, because he does not here speak of <HI>every Individual,</HI> but of the <HI>whole Body.</HI>"
— Again,
"This Place is wont to be cited by some, that they may prove, there is so far from being any Thing <HI>good</HI> and <HI>valuable</HI> in our Works, that they are in God's Sight <HI>noisome</HI> and <HI>filthy</HI> Things; but this appears to me to be very <HI>foreign</HI> from the Sense of the <HI>Prophet.</HI>"
<HI>These Quotations</HI> from <HI>Calvin,</HI> you say, favour <HI>your Exposition,</HI> and prove you a <HI>Calvinist</HI> in opening the <HI>Text.</HI> But (Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>) let us see your Argument; and try the Force of it: it is this; Because <HI>Calvin</HI> speaks in his Commentary on this Text, what is above recited, there∣fore when I say, the Prophet designs the <HI>hypocritical Per∣formances</HI> and <HI>extraordinary aggravated Wickedness</HI> of some of the <HI>worst</HI> of Men, it must follow, that I am a <HI>Cal∣vinist.</HI> But is this (Sir) a <HI>genuine</HI> Consequence from the Premises? Verily no, in no wise: for there is not the least Hint in the Words cited from <HI>Calvin,</HI> that he car∣ries the Text in the same Sense as you do; and indeed I think, you cou'd not but know, in Fact he does not. So that I may with Justice say (to put no worse Con∣struction upon it) that if Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> was not a better <HI>Linguist,</HI> than <HI>Logician,</HI> or did not know better how to turn <HI>Latin</HI> into English, than he does to draw <HI>Consequen∣ces</HI> from Premises, you would certainly have needed some <HI>Elbow-Friends,</HI> as well as a Dictionary, to construe <HI>Calvin</HI> so well as you happen to have done; yea, that perhaps you would "look upon <HI>Latin</HI> as the Language of the <HI>Beast,</HI>" and been "startled at it."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="006764_0024_0000000000000000"/>But it may be, you will say, if you have not proved yourself a <HI>Calvinist</HI> in opening the Text, yet you have prov'd <HI>me</HI> an <HI>Anti-Calvinist,</HI> at least so far. Indeed, Sir, I con∣fess, the Paragraphs you have quoted from <HI>Calvin,</HI> if viewed as standing <HI>alone,</HI> and not in Connection with the rest of his Commentary on the Text and Context, do seem to look that Way: And what then? <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">If this should be <HI>really</HI> the Case, Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> might as well prove me not a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> because not a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> (as <HI>Calvin</HI> was) but a <HI>Congregationalist:</HI> For when a Man is called a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> it is never meant in this rigid Sense, that he thinks exactly with <HI>Calvin</HI> in <HI>every Point</HI> of Doctrine, any more than Discipline, or that he puts the <HI>same Construction</HI> upon <HI>every Text</HI> of Scripture (which I believe never was, nor ever will be the Case;) but his gene∣ral <HI>Agreement</HI> with him in Principles, and particularly in the <HI>five Points</HI> of Doctrine, which are so strenuously opposed by <HI>Arminian</HI> Writers.</NOTE> Would it be any thing very strange? I think not. For could it be rationally expected, that "one of CALVIN'S <HI>youngest Sons</HI>" should so early commence such a compleat <HI>Cal∣vinist,</HI> as to open every Text in the Bible just as <HI>Calvin</HI> did; I cannot believe this of any of his <HI>oldest Sons.</HI> I think, Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> it is pretty well for the Time, that my Opinion so exactly quadrates with his in those <HI>five Points,</HI> which Protestants in general have concur'd with him in, but which <HI>your</HI> Sermon (Sir) if I can understand it, is calculated to oppose.</P>
<P>After all, 'tis possible, if we should view what <HI>Calvin</HI> says in his Commentary on the <HI>Chapter</HI> which contains our Text, and what he says on the <HI>Text,</HI> which stands connected with what you have quoted from him; I say, if we should view what he says in its <HI>Connection,</HI> 'tis possible I might be found to be something more <HI>Calvi∣nistical,</HI> even in opening the Text, than either Mr. <HI>Bri∣ant</HI> is, or is willing to allow <HI>me</HI> to be. Let us fairly try the Case, by repairing to <HI>Calvin</HI> himself.</P>
<P>This 64th Chapter of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> you can't but be sensi∣ble, if you've read <HI>Calvin,</HI> he considers as a Prayer of the <HI>Faithful</HI> in the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Captivity, or of the Prophet in
<PB N="22" REF="006764_0025_0000000000000000"/>
the <HI>Name</HI> of those <HI>Faithful,</HI> which is all one.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hence <HI>Calvin</HI> says on the 8<HI>th ver. Haec Precatio non promiscuè quibuslibet, sed residu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s tantum Filiis Dei dictata fuit.</HI> That is,
"This Prayer was not dictated by the Prophet to be used by <HI>every one promis<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>us<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> but <HI>only</HI> by the <HI>Sons of God</HI> that remained"
<HI>viz.</HI> after the Destruction of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> by the King of <HI>Babylon</HI>▪</NOTE> And he accordingly begins his Comment on the 6th Verse thus: <HI>Pergunt FIDELES in sua querimonia; deplorant enim statum suum, quod Deus nullam rationem videatur.—Caeterum hîc duo notari debent: primúm, FIDELES reatum suum fateri, ac merito se paenas dare; deinde, nihilominus con∣queri de gravitate paenarum quas sustinent: non ut expostu∣lent cum Deo, sed ut ipsum ad clementiam provocent: quem∣admodum ubi reus judicem flectere conatur, miserias ei suas et calamitates exponit. Hîc se nonnulli torquent, quód Propheta de scelerum inquinamentis loquens, sine exceptione Iudaeos omnes exprimat; in quibus tamen nonnulli resta∣bant puri Dei cultores: sed frustra; quia non loquitur de singulis, sed de universo corpore; quod, cúm infra omnes homines abjectum atque extrema clade affectum esset, panno sordido comparat. Hic locus citari à quibusdam solet, ut probent adeò nihil esse meriti in operibus nostris ut coram Deo putida ac foetida sint: sed hoc mihi videtur alienum à Prophetae Sententia, cum de toto genere humano non loqui∣tur, atqui eorum querimoniam describit, qui in exilium missi, iram Domini in se sentiebant: ideoque se cum justitiis suis panno inquinato similes esse fatebantur.</HI>— Which I render into English thus; The FAITHFUL go on with <HI>their Complaint</HI>; for they lament their Case because God does not seem to take any Notice of them.—Two Things ought to be noted here; first, the FAITHFUL confess <HI>their Guilt,</HI> and Desert of the Punishment inflicted on <HI>them</HI>; and then, nevertheless complain of the Weight of it: not that they would quarrel with God, but that they would urge him to Clemency; as when a Criminal en∣deavours to move the Judge to Compassion, he repre∣sents to him his Miseries and Calamities. Here some distress themselves, that the Prophet speaking of the Defilements of Sin, taxeth <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Iews,</HI> without Ex∣ception,
<PB N="23" REF="006764_0026_0000000000000000" MS="y"/>
among whom nevertheless there remained some sincere Worshippers of God: But in vain; because he does not speak of every Individual, but of the <HI>whole Body</HI> [i. e. of the CHURCH of God, as <HI>Calvin</HI> explains himself on, v. 8.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Says <HI>Calvin</HI> there, <HI>Omnes dicendo, non loquitur de singulis, ut <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> admonui, sed totum corpus ecclesiae comprehendit.</HI> In English thus▪ The Prophet, in saying <HI>All,</HI> don't speak of every Individual, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I noticed before [viz. <HI>in the Passages quoted by Mr.</HI> Briant] <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the whole Body of the <HI>Church.</HI>—</NOTE>] which being abject beneath all Men, and extremely miserable, he compares to a <HI>filthy Rag.</HI> This Place is wont to be cited by some to prove, that there is so far from being any Thing of Merit in our Works, that before God they are noisome and stinking Things: but this appears to me to be foreign from the Scope of the Prophet; because he does not speak of the whole human Race, but only sets forth the Complaint of those [<HI>viz. of the</HI> CHURCH, <HI>or Faithful</HI>] who being sent into Banishment, were sensible of the Wrath of God upon them; and therefore confess <HI>themselves</HI> with <HI>their Righteousnesses</HI> to be <HI>as a filthy Rag.</HI>— Thus speaks Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Commentary on the controverted Text.</P>
<P>And now let the World judge, which is most <HI>Calvi∣nistical</HI> in opening it; Whether Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> who says, the Prophet is
"only confessing and lamenting the <HI>ag∣gravated Sins</HI> of the <HI>worst</HI> Men,"
"such as were utterly destitute of true Righteousness,"
"utterly averse to Duty and Obedience"
and
"<HI>given up to the most detestable Im∣moralities</HI>":
—Or I, when I say, that the Prophet designs <HI>not</HI> the Worst, but the best Men, and that <HI>all their Righteousnesses are,</HI> in some Respects, <HI>as filthy Rags.</HI></P>
<P>But however <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Sentiments may appear as ex∣pressed in his <HI>Commentaries,</HI> it is plain, that he is fully with <HI>me</HI> in his <HI>Institutions.</HI> For there (3 <HI>Lib.</HI> 2 <HI>Cap.</HI>) speaking of Faith and the Fruits of it, and quoting our <HI>Text,</HI> he has these Words: —Nimirum si ipsae quoque Justitiae omnes, ad lumen veritatis inspectae, velut pan∣nus menstruatae inveniuntur, Injustitiae deinceps quales reputabuntur? Which I english thus; Truly if even
<PB N="24" REF="006764_0027_0000000000000000"/>
all our <HI>Righteousnesses</HI> themselves, view'd in the Light of Truth, are found to be <HI>as filthy Rags,</HI> what then shall our <HI>Unrighteousnesses</HI> be reputed?—</P>
<P>But not to insist on this Passage, which it may be you had not met with, there is enough in CALVIN'S <HI>Com∣mentaries</HI> to spoil your glorying on the Head of <HI>Calvi∣nism.</HI> What he says on the <HI>other Parts</HI> of this Prayer, is directly against you, but is too long to recite here: And what he speaks on the <HI>Text</HI> it self, does not in the least favour <HI>your</HI> Exposition. For in whatever Sense he takes the Words, 'tis plain he supposes the <HI>Righteous</HI> are comprehended in them, if not solely intended. How then comes it to pass, Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> that you have had the Face to tell the World,
"That you have proved <HI>yourself</HI> intirely <HI>Calvinistical</HI> in your Sense of the <HI>Text</HI>"— "That you might with Reason be charg∣ed with <HI>stealing</HI> your Interpretation from <HI>Calvin,</HI> rather than in the <HI>least</HI> contradicting him"— "That you have very honestly represented <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Meaning,"
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And upon this Foundation have gone into a warm and long Expostulation with me and my Attestators!
"How shall we account for this <HI>(real)</HI> enormous Blunder in you"?
It will doubtless occasion various Thoughts in the Minds of Men; and some, it is probable, that will be pretty severe upon you; at least as severe as that my <HI>(supposed)</HI> Blunder occasion'd in your Mind about me. However, Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> you must allow us to exclaim against the Growth of <HI>Arminianism</HI>; and to think, we have some Grounds for it, particularly in Relation to <HI>you,</HI> 'till you afford us <HI>better Proofs</HI> of your being a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> than you have yet done: And you must not think it strange, if we are not at all affected with your pathetic Expostulation, when it is evidently so groundless and altogether impertinent.</P>
<P>Thus I have gone through what I proposed.—Yet before I conclude, let me observe to you, Sir, that your <HI>friendly Remarks</HI> (as you call them) are full of <HI>unfriendly Reflections,</HI> not on me only, but on others: And parti∣cularly on one in the Ministry, whom you have had the
<PB N="25" REF="006764_0028_0000000000000000"/>
Front to call "a <HI>verbose, dark, Iesuitical</HI> Writer," <HI>&amp;c.</HI> meaning that <HI>Reverend Gentleman,</HI> who hath done the Part of a <HI>faithful judicious</HI> PROTESTANT, in laying open the POPISH <HI>Mystery of Iniquity,</HI> contained in your <HI>Sermon</HI>; tho' he did not see fit to mention it or the Author, as judging that to answer <HI>Bellarmine</HI> was to answer <HI>Briant,</HI> his and your Construction of the Text and Arguments upon it being so near a-kin, that One would suspect you of <HI>stealing</HI> from him rather than from <HI>Calvin.</HI> I don't so much wonder that you thought Mr. <HI>Foxcroft's</HI> Sermon <HI>verbose,</HI> and that your <HI>Patience</HI> tired, while he was replying to the <HI>Papist,</HI> seeing it was in Effect a chastising your "<HI>impudent Piece</HI>", as the late <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>venerable</HI> Mr. WALTER (now with God) gave it it's Character upon perusing it.— But one would have thought, the Gentleman's <HI>Age,</HI> and known <HI>Ability,</HI> and Repute among us, would have demanded <HI>better Treatment</HI> from you, were it not that you found his Arguments so strong and so well-manag'd, that your best Artillery (<HI>poor</HI> indeed!) to play against them, was <HI>scurrilous Reflection.</HI> (But surely you forgot, that Text was in the Bible, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.1. Which I leave you to look and read.)—And what good <HI>End</HI> (Sir) did you propose to your self, in bantering, reflecting, and railing, at such a Rate, and unprovok'd too? Did you think by it to do what you would seem to be against, and blame others for doing, (REM pag 27.) where you say,
"Some Men think to <HI>carry their Cause</HI> meerly by the Applica∣tion of a few <HI>odious Appellations</HI>; instead of bringing forth their strong Reasons, they fall to <HI>Railing</HI> and <HI>Scolding</HI> and <HI>calling Names,</HI> which is but a more sly and covert Way of reviling and abusing an Opponent, and is looked on by the rational Part of Mankind, as no∣thing but Phrensy and a blasphemous Prostitution of the Name of God, to countenance our <HI>unsanctified Spleen</HI> against others, and to give a Currency to our own <HI>sense∣less Divinity</HI> among the thoughtless Multitude."
—Truly, Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> when I read these Lines of yours, and find how you yourself frequently
"fall to <HI>Railing</HI> &amp; <HI>Scolding</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="006764_0029_0000000000000000"/>
and <HI>'calling Names</HI>"
in your Book, I can't help thinking whether you did not take this Method with a View to give a Currency to your own — <HI>Divinity</HI> among the thoughtless Multitude: And I can scarce keep out of my Mind that inspired Passage, Rom. 2.1. <HI>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O Man; for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest another, doest the same Things.</HI></P>
<P>I just remind you (Sir) of <HI>these Things,</HI> which I beg you to consider seriously and dispassionately, that you may take Shame to yourself, and fly to the Blood of Sprinkling for Pardon, and learn to preach and print with a better Spirit and Christian Temper for the Time to come.</P>
<P>I shall now close my Letter with some borrow'd Words: But excuse me, Sir, from doing it in the Words of an <HI>Arian</HI> Writer, as you do your <HI>Sermon,</HI> in the Words of Mr. JAMES FOSTER, whom you describe
"a late ele∣gant Writer and Instructor how to <HI>preach</HI> CHRIST."
A fine Preacher of Christ, &amp; Teacher of others to preach him, sure, a Denier of the Divinity of Christ must be! I hope, Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> you don't copy after this your <HI>ele∣gant Writer,</HI> nor take your Instructions from an <HI>Arian</HI> in Preaching; 'tis sad if you do! By the Way let me just ask you (Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>) why you did not insert in your Sermon, these <HI>remarkable</HI> Words of your celebrated Au∣thor, <HI>viz.</HI>
"That to <HI>preach</HI> CHRIST, is not — to make his <HI>Person</HI> and his <HI>Offices</HI> INCOMPREHENSIBLE."
Which Words you could not but see, for they lie between the Sentences you quote from him? — Why (if I may pre∣sume to answer for you) because this <HI>Aria<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Sentence would have spoiled all.—I shall not close in this Author's Words, I say: Nor yet in the Words of the Writer, that you close your <HI>Remarks</HI> with, "who is in <HI>Heaven</HI> now" you say. 'Tis possible, Sir: But let me tell you, with∣out Breach of <HI>Charity,</HI> if his <HI>Heart,</HI> when he died, was not sounder, than his <HI>Head</HI> was, when he penn'd these <HI>remarkable</HI> Words, which you adopt, <HI>viz.</HI>
"The <HI>Condi∣tion</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="006764_0030_0000000000000000"/>
of our <HI>Acceptance</HI> with GOD always was, to endea∣vour to be like God in Purity and Holiness, Justice and Righteousness, Mercy and Goodness, to <HI>cease to do Evil, and learn to do well</HI>;"
I a little suspect what his End has been, &amp; whether he is not lodged in some lower Region.— But the Words I will close with, shall be those of the <HI>General Assembly</HI> of the Church of SCOTLAND in an <HI>Act</HI> of theirs, containing Advice to <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI>; which wholesom Words of Advice, I pray God, that Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> and I may consent to and follow. They are these.
<Q>We recommend to Ministers, that in their Sermons they insist frequently upon the Truth, Necessity and Excellency of <HI>supernatural Revelation</HI>; the supreme <HI>Deity</HI> of the SON and HOLY GHOST, as well as of the FATHER; together with the <HI>Oneness</HI> of the <HI>God-head:</HI> Our sinful and lost Estate by <HI>Nature,</HI> the Necessity of <HI>supernatural Grace,</HI> and of <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of CHRIST, without which the best Works cannot please God: And that they make it the great Scope of their Sermons to lead Sinners from the <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> to a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> for Life &amp; Salvation, and from <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Self</HI> to precious Christ:— That in pressing Obedience to the <HI>Law,</HI> they shew the Nature and Ex∣cellency of <HI>Gospel-Holiness</HI>; and enforce Conformity to the moral Law both in Heart and Life, <HI>not</HI> from Principles of <HI>Reason</HI> only, but also and more especi∣ally of <HI>Revelation</HI>▪ And in Order to attain thereto, it is necessary to shew Men the Corruption and Depra∣vity of human Nature by their Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> their natural <HI>Impotence</HI> for, and <HI>Aversion</HI> to, what is <HI>spiri∣tually</HI> Good; and to lead them to the true and only <HI>Source</HI> of all Grace &amp; Holiness, viz. <HI>Union</HI> to CHRIST, by the Holy Spirit's working <HI>Faith</HI> in us, and renew∣ing us more and more after the Image of God: And to let their Hearers know, that they must be <HI>first</HI> ingrafted into CHRIST, as their <HI>Root</HI> before their, <HI>Fruit</HI> can be Savoury unto God; that they must have <HI>a new Principle</HI> to animate, and a <HI>new End</HI> to direct them, before their Actions become gracious, and ac∣ceptable
<PB N="28" REF="006764_0031_0000000000000000"/>
in the Sight of God; and that they teach them the Necessity of <HI>living by Faith on the Son of God,</HI> in constant looking to, and Dependance on him, as the great Author of all gracious Influences, for the Performance of every Duty; and withal, after the best Performances and Attainments, they must <HI>count them but Loss and Dung</HI> in Point of <HI>Iustification</HI> before God, and make it their great Desire, only to be <HI>found in</HI> CHRIST <HI>and his Righteousness.</HI></Q></P>

<HEAD>An APPENDIX, relating to the <HI>same Subject.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">By One of the ATTESTATORS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>free and rich Grace</HI> of GOD, display'd in Man's Salvation by Jesus Christ, is a Theme of the highest Importance; and 'tis a delight∣ful Theme to true Christians, being sensible that all their Comfort and Happiness is center'd here. And when human Schemes are advanced, that tend to the <HI>depreciating</HI> of this, such cannot but be affected with deep Concern. Now, is it not evident, that several Pieces, of this unhappy Tendency, have of late Years been publish'd in the Country? And particularly, is not this the plain Scope of a <HI>Sermon,</HI> lately publish'd by the Rev. Mr. L. BRIANT, from <HI>Isai.</HI> lxiv.6? Is it not the whole Drift of his Discourse, to run down and decry <HI>this Grace,</HI> at least in the Sense hitherto generally receiv'd among us, as a "<HI>Libertine</HI> Notion," as
"vilifying human Nature, affronting human Reason, and corrupt∣ing Christianity,"—
"turning the pure and perfect Reli∣gion of Jesus into <HI>an idle Speculation, a mysterious Faith, a senseless Superstition, and a groundless Recumbency</HI>"!</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="006764_0033_0000000000000000"/>Indeed when he comes to defend his Sermon, he wou'd make some Appearance of owning the Doctrine of <HI>Grace,</HI> in these Words. [REM. p. 28.]
<Q>I assure you, I always preach up (what I firmly believe) that the <HI>Grace</HI> of God is the original Spring of all his Crea∣tures Happiness, and that there is no such Thing as buying, purchasing or meriting this Grace at his Hands: But that 'tis <HI>Free and Rich Grace.</HI> By <HI>Free</HI> I mean, 'tis the essential Disposition of the Deity to be good: By <HI>Rich</HI> I mean, the same with the sacred Writer, that he is good to <HI>All,</HI> and that his tender Mercies are over <HI>All</HI> his Works.</Q>
—But what a lame Confession of Faith, and what a miserable Account of his Preaching is here! Do's Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> believe and preach no other <HI>Grace</HI> of God, but that which is
"the Spring of the Happiness of <HI>All</HI> his Creatures;"
and so is common to Angels, Men, and Bruits? Do's he make no Distinction between <HI>Providential</HI> Grace towards all the Creatures, and <HI>Redeeming</HI> Grace towards perishing Sinners? And do's he verily believe and preach, that
"there is <HI>no such Thing</HI> [What! absolutely, <HI>no such Thing</HI> at all] as <HI>Buying, Purchasing</HI> or <HI>Meriting</HI> this Grace at the Hands of God;"
but that 'tis "<HI>Unbought</HI> Grace?" as he terms it, in absolute Language, without any Guard or Limitation. [REM. p. 18.] Surely, Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Expressions in both Places are very incautious if he holds the Doctrine of CHRIST'S <HI>Atonement,</HI> in any Sense but the <HI>Socinian</HI>; which resolves it into meer Me∣taphor, and confesses no proper <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> or <HI>Purchase</HI> of Redemption at the Hands of Divine Justice, but as∣cribes Salvation simply to the <HI>Grace</HI> of God; <HI>that Grace,</HI> Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> says, he preaches up and firmly believes; which is
"the Spring of the Happiness of <HI>all</HI> the Crea∣tures"
in common; which is "<HI>Free</HI>", in that 'tis the
"<HI>essential</HI> Disposition of the Deity to be good",
and which is "<HI>Rich,</HI>" in that it is so <HI>extensive,</HI> even
"over <HI>all</HI> the Works of his Hands."
— But what Confusion and Error is here▪</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="006764_0034_0000000000000000"/>That <HI>Goodness</HI> is an essential Attribute of God, 'tis readily acknowledg'd: but then it must be own'd, <HI>Ius∣tice</HI> is so too. And is it not as much the <HI>essential Dis∣position</HI> of the Deity to be <HI>just,</HI> as to be <HI>good?</HI> Therefore God hath sent his Son to be the <HI>Propitiation</HI> for our Sins, to the End that he might be <HI>Iust,</HI> and yet the <HI>Iustifier</HI> of him which believeth in Jesus. Wou'd it not have been unspotted <HI>Iustice</HI> in God, had he punish'd fallen Man with everlasting Destruction, without a Remedy? Wou'd he not have remain'd <HI>essentially</HI> good, had he never been <HI>communicatively</HI> so, at least, in respect of Salvation to any of his Rebel-Creatures? After the Apostacy, was not God at Liberty to <HI>suspend</HI> the Exercise of his Goodness toward us, unless an <HI>Atonement</HI> were made to his offend∣ed Justice? His <HI>Grace</HI> therefore eminently appears <HI>in his Kindness to us by Iesus Christ</HI>; as he hath set him forth to be a <HI>Propitiation for Sin, thro' Faith in his Blood.</HI> And the <HI>Distinction</HI> in this Regard between the Case of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Devils,</HI> puts an admirable Lustre on redeem∣ing <HI>Grace</HI>; making it appear gloriously <HI>free.</HI> In the common Acceptation of the Word, <HI>Grace</HI> connotes the <HI>Unworthiness</HI> of the Object, and the <HI>Condescension</HI> of Di∣vine Love: the Addition of the Epithet, <HI>Free,</HI> seems to heighten the Sense, and may particularly denote God's <HI>sovereign Liberty</HI> in chusing the Objects of his Fa∣vour. Agreeably by this Phrase, <HI>the free Grace of God,</HI> Divines truly <HI>Calvinistical</HI> understand his <HI>special</HI> Love and Favour, thro' Jesus Christ, terminated on Creatures altogether <HI>unlovely,</HI> and selecting <HI>some</HI> such for its Objects, while passing by others in the <HI>same</HI> Condition: accord∣ing to that of our Saviour, <HI>Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy Sight.</HI> (Matth. xi.26)—But does Mr. BRIANT own the <HI>Freeness</HI> of Divine Grace in <HI>this</HI> Sense? No; he expresly disclaims it. SER. p. 7, 8.</P>
<P>And then as to his Construction of the other Epithet, <HI>Rich,</HI> what a wrong Idea does it convey? The Text that he quotes, Psal. cxlv.9. <HI>The Lord is good to all,</HI> &amp;c. is nothing to the Purpose for which he alledges it: It does not hold forth to us (as he insinuates) that there
<PB N="32" REF="006764_0035_0000000000000000" MS="y"/>
is an <HI>universal Grace</HI> given to Mankind, by the Improve∣ment of which they may all certainly attain Salvation: But it refers only to common and outward Favours, of which All (both Saints and Sinners, yea and the very Bruits) partake while in this World. (See v. 15, 16.) And it is parallel with those Texts, Matth. v.45. <HI>He maketh his Sun to rise on the Evil and on the Good,</HI> &amp;c. And Luk. vi.35. <HI>He is kind to the Unthankful, and to the Evil.</HI>—This Notion of <HI>universal Grace,</HI> i. e. that there is <HI>sufficient Grace</HI> given to all, both <HI>Heathens</HI> and profess'd Christians, for their Conversion and Salvation (which Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> must mean, if he means any Thing to the Purpose) is utterly inconsistent with the Principles of <HI>Calvinism,</HI> and is one of the prime Doctrines of <HI>Armini∣us.</HI> —None of the <HI>Calvinists</HI> suppose, that the <HI>Richness</HI> of Divine Grace consists in the <HI>Universality</HI> of it's Extent; but in the unsearchable Treasure of Benefits it commu∣nicates, and in the infinite Expence it was at for the Purchase of them by Christ's precious Blood, as well as in it's Triumphs over infinite Demerits, and in the vast Mul∣titude of it's chosen Objects, who being all undeserving, might justly have been left (as well as the fallen Angels, and many of their Fellow-Men) to perish eternally in their Wickedness. If this Grace were not special, but all Men were sharers in it indifferently, it would not ap∣pear so wonderful in our Eyes, and so precious, as it now does: even as worldly Riches, if common to all, would not appear of such Value, as when in the Hands of a select Number of Men.</P>
<P>But if Grace <HI>universal</HI> and <HI>sufficient</HI> be given without Distinction, why then are not <HI>all</HI> converted? The <HI>Ar∣minians</HI> answer, because some <HI>co-operate</HI> with this Grace, and others not; some duly improve what is given them, and so (pursuant to Promise) receive more; while others reject it, and perish. — So that (according to them) it is in the Power of their own <HI>Wills,</HI> whether this <HI>Grace</HI> shall succeed, or not; and the true Reason, why <HI>Peter</HI> was converted, and not <HI>Iudas,</HI> was not because of the Predominancy of <HI>Grace,</HI> but because the one by his own

<HI>Will</HI> made the Grace of GOD effectual; whereas the other, for want of the like Improvement of his <HI>Free-Will,</HI> was lost. — But is this Doctrine of the <HI>Universalists,</HI> the Doctrine of the <HI>Bible?</HI> I trow not. What says our Lord Jesus Christ? Matth. xi.25, 26. <HI>Thou hast hid these Things from the Wise and Prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes,</HI> &amp;c. So, Chap. xiii.11. <HI>It is given unto you to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.</HI>— What says St. <HI>Paul?</HI> Rom. ix.18. <HI>Therefore hath he Mercy, on whom he will have Mercy.</HI> So, 1 Cor. iv.7. <HI>Who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou, that thou didst not receive?</HI></P>
<P>But I need not insist here, 'till Mr. BRIANT be so honest as to own more explicitly, that he is <HI>Arminian</HI> in this, as well as other Points; it being a main Part of my Design in this APPENDIX, rather to <HI>unmask</HI> Errors, than to <HI>refute</HI> them, (which it will be Time eno' to do, when they are more openly and formally acknowledg∣ed, and when defended by Arguments, instead of Banter and Harangue.) And this I am led to by Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s loud Complaints of the <HI>Attestators</HI> to Mr. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Sermon, for fixing the Charge of <HI>Arminianism</HI> upon him (with others;) which he says, is founded
"only upon his Interpretation of one single <HI>Text,</HI>"
without any other Foundation — If this be so, we may have wronged him in our Attestation:— But if I mistake not, it can easily be made appear, upon a strict Examination of his <HI>Ser∣mon</HI> and <HI>Letter,</HI> that they are both inconsistent with the commonly received Doctrines, called <HI>Calvinistical</HI>; and that (notwithstanding his Subterfuges and sly Turns in his <HI>Friendly Remarks,</HI> by which he tho't, perhaps to impose upon weak Minds) he will finally turn out a rank <HI>Arminian,</HI> at best.</P>
<P>I know indeed, that Men of his Cast are not willing to own the Name, (because at present it is a Name of Reproach in the Country) and some of them have the Face expresly to deny it: — But what do they mean by such Denial? — Why, either (1.) That they don't hold exactly with <HI>Arminius</HI> in every Point: Or, (2.) That
<PB N="34" REF="006764_0037_0000000000000000"/>
they do not make <HI>Arminius</HI> the Master of their Faith; that they do not hold such Doctrines <HI>as</HI> they are <HI>Armi∣nius</HI>'s, but as they are the Doctrines of the <HI>Bible,</HI> as they apprehend. — As to the first Pretence, tho' they don't hold exactly with <HI>Arminius</HI> in every Point, yet in as much as they do in the main Points, they may be justly stiled <HI>Arminians</HI>; and they had better be contented with this Name, if they would not have <HI>a worse</HI>; for they ge∣nerally go further from the Truth, than even <HI>Arminius</HI> did, &amp; their Difference from him is on the wrong Hand.— As to the second; Who ever called them <HI>Arminians</HI> in that Sense, that they make <HI>Arminius</HI> the Lord of their Faith? — Is it not plain, that all we intend by this Name, is, that they hold the same Doctrines, in Sum and Sub∣stance, that <HI>Arminius</HI> did; who was the great Instrument of reviving the <HI>Semi-Pelagian</HI> Errors, in the <HI>Protestant</HI> World? — Is it not then evident Tricking and Collusion, to deny themselves to be <HI>Arminians</HI> upon this Ground?— And is it not as trickish and disingenuous, to be perpe∣tually throwing it in the Teeth of those Divines called <HI>Calvinistical,</HI> that they make <HI>Calvin</HI> the Master of their Faith; that they
<Q>enslave their Minds and the Minds of the People to human Schemes and Authorities;</Q>
that they teach them to
<Q>substitute the Writings of weak fallible Men, in the Room of Christ and his Gos∣pel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
(p. 27, 28. REM.) Whereas they know, that there is not a <HI>Calvinist</HI> upon Earth in <HI>this</HI> Sense. — Can't we look upon <HI>Calvin</HI> as an eminent Man of GOD, and the Doctrines he taught as agreable to the Scriptures, without being stigmatiz'd as setting him up in the Room of Christ! — Can't we receive a <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> tho' drawn up by fallible Men, as a true Exposition of the Doctrine of the Bible, without enslaving our Minds to human Schemes? — And can't we (for the Direction of our own Conduct) ask others, whether they are agreed with us in this, without enslaving them also? — For my Part, I am but little acquainted with the Writings of <HI>Calvin:</HI> But yet I am willing to be called a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> that others may know what Scheme of Principles I hold
<PB N="35" REF="006764_0038_0000000000000000"/>
to be founded upon the Word of GOD; and don't de∣sire (as the Manner of some is) to muffle my self up in Shade and Obscurity, in general Terms, and ambiguous Expressions, as if ashamed of my Principles; which Con∣duct, in whomsoever it's found, I look upon as a <HI>dark Sign,</HI> agreable to 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.1.</P>
<P>But to come more directly to what I aim at: — As one of the <HI>Attestators,</HI> I think there are two Things especially incumbent upon me.</P>
<P N="1">I. To see more particularly what <HI>Grounds</HI> there are to fix the Charge of <HI>Arminianism</HI> upon Mr. <HI>Briant.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">II. To take some Notice of his Remarks upon the Word, <HI>Our,</HI> in his Text.</P>
<P N="1">I. I shall mention some Things in Support of the Charge of <HI>Arminianism</HI> bro't against him.</P>
<P>When I first perused Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Sermon, whatever my Opinion might be of his <HI>Orthodoxy,</HI> I tho't him <HI>honest,</HI> and open enough in declaring his own Principles, (tho' I should have been glad, if he had been as <HI>honest</HI> in re∣presenting the Principles of his Opponents:) And by the Conclusion of his Sermon one would have tho't, that no∣thing would make him flinch from what he had so plainly deliver'd as the <HI>Truth.</HI>
"I am sensible (says he) that this Sort of Preaching is not calculated for the <HI>gene∣ral Taste</HI> of the present Age: — It may not at present be the Way to <HI>popular</HI> Applause, or to <HI>priestly</HI> Favours: — However if it be the Way of <HI>Truth,</HI> tho' the asserting of it should expose a Man to Poverty and Contempt, and all Manner of temporal Inconveniencies, a stedfast Faith and inflexible Virtue will readily reply,— <HI>None of these Things move me, neither count I my Life dear to me,</HI>"
&amp;c. (And to the same Purpose he speaks, <HI>p.</HI> 6.) Here seems to be the most magnanimous Resolution, fixedly to ad∣here to the Scheme of Doctrine, that he had advanced, let Death, or what would, be the Consequence: But in∣stead of abiding constant in the Day of Trial, how soon does he turn his Back (what the Principle or Motive was, his Conscience knows best!) and in his Reply to Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> would fain perswade the World to believe,
"that
<PB N="36" REF="006764_0039_0000000000000000"/>
there is no Controversy between them, but only as to the Sense and Design of one single Passage, in the Book of <HI>Isaiah</HI>;"
and that
"what follows in Mr. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Sermon could not with the least Colour of Reason be apply'd to any Thing he had deliver'd."
—In short, in his "sly and covert Way," he would insinuate into "vulgar Minds," that he is more <HI>Calvinistical,</HI> than even Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> himself; tho' yet he can't help bewraying himself every now and then, as appears by his Descrip∣tion of <HI>free and rich Grace</HI> (of which I have spoken be∣fore,) and by other Strokes, which I may perhaps take Notice of by and by.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Sermon</HI> I am to begin with; and the Grounds or Reasons why we charg'd him with <HI>Arminianism</HI> in this, are such as these.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Arminians</HI> deny the Doctrines of personal and unconditional Election, of original Sin, of free and irre∣sistable (or efficacious) Grace, and of the final Perseve∣rance of the Saints:— And does not Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> do the same, in his Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 7, 8?— After he had profess'd himself to be <HI>Orthodox</HI> in one Point at least; namely, that the Scriptures are the only Rule, he immediately falls foul upon these Doctrines, representing them in hideous Colours, and dispatching them all at a Blow.— He again vilifies and burlesques the Doctrine of original Sin. <HI>p.</HI> 24. And likewise that of Perseverance. <HI>p.</HI> 25, 26.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>Arminians</HI> are ever charging it upon the <HI>Calvinists,</HI> that their Doctrines tend to Licentiousness, and that there is no Necessity, upon their Scheme, of in∣herent Holiness. — And does not Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> herein follow them, in his Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 8, 9, 25, 26. And even in his Remarks, in the Title-Page, by quoting that Text, <HI>Turning the Grace of GOD into Lasciviousness,</HI> as appli∣cable to Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> and those like minded?—</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Arminians</HI> laugh at the <HI>Calvinists</HI> for laying such Stress on <HI>Faith in Christ,</HI> calling it a <HI>mysterious Faith,</HI> a <HI>groundless Recumbency,</HI> an <HI>idle Speculation,</HI> &amp;c. as all know that are conversant with their Writings.— And so does Mr. <HI>Briant.</HI> p. 7, 8.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="37" REF="006764_0040_0000000000000000"/>IV. The <HI>Arminians</HI> deny the Doctrine of free Justi∣fication by the imputed Righteousness of Christ, ex∣clusive of all Works: <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Arminius</HI> (says one of his Contemporaries) asserit, in homini<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coram Deo justificatione, justitiam Christi non imputari in justiti∣am; verum ipsam Fidem seu tò Credere, per gratiosam Dei ac∣ceptationem, esse justitiam illam nostram, qua coram Deo justifi∣camur. —</NOTE> And does not Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> do the same? Does not he chiefly level his Artillery (such as it is) against this Doctrine; other Things coming in as it were incidentally! — And isn't he himself conscious of this, when he acknowleges that he is opposing
<Q>a great Part of the Christian World.</Q>
<HI>p.</HI> 19. That he goes against
"the general Taste of the present Age";
and that
<Q>this Sort of Preaching is not the Way to <HI>popular</HI> Applause or <HI>priestly</HI> Favours▪</Q>
<HI>p.</HI> 30. And intimates some considerable Hazard in it, which by
<Q>a stedfast Faith and inflexible Virtue,</Q>
he hoped to o∣vercome <HI>p.</HI> 31. — And is all this Cry grounded upon
<Q>nothing but his putting a different Construction upon one single Text,</Q>
while he fully agrees with the <HI>Calvi∣nists</HI> in the great Point of Justification as sufficiently estab∣lished from other Texts? — I can't have so mean an Opinion of his Understanding, as to think he meant so; but what then must he mean, unless what he is charged with above, which was sufficient indeed to put him into a Pannick?</P>
<P>I would observe further in Support of this Charge▪</P>
<P N="1">1. That he applies several Scripture-Phrases, which by <HI>Calvinists</HI> are generally understood of the Righteous∣ness of <HI>Christ,</HI> to the <HI>personal</HI> Righteousness of Men; such as the <HI>best Robe,</HI> the <HI>Wedding-Garment; the fine Lin∣nen clean and white</HI>; and plainly signifies that this is <HI>all</HI> that is meant by them. <HI>p.</HI> 15, 16.— <HI>Query,</HI> Does <HI>Calvin</HI> agree with him in this?— Let him look and see.— And further, Can he have the Face to say, that all the Con∣troversy between him and Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> and his Attestators, is about one single Text; especially since Mr. <HI>Porter</HI>▪ mentions these Texts, and puts a direct contrary Inter∣pretation
<PB N="38" REF="006764_0041_0000000000000000"/>
upon them? — And then again, if he owns the (active and passive) Righteousness of Christ to be the <HI>sole Matter</HI> of our Justification, how comes it about, that he applies these Scripture-Phrases solely to <HI>personal</HI> Righ∣teousness, when (upon Supposition of the Truth of that Doctrine) they most naturally refer to <HI>imputed</HI> Righte∣ousness?</P>
<P N="2">2. Let any One read his Sermon attentively, and he will see "without inward Illumination", that the whole Run of it is to prove, that the <HI>Condition</HI> of our Accep∣tance with GOD (or in other Words, of our Justifica∣tion) is the <HI>personal</HI> Righteousness of Men.— Hence these Passages, as a Samplar: —
"The pure Religion of <HI>Iesus</HI> suspends our <HI>whole Happiness</HI> upon our personal good Behaviour",
<HI>&amp;c. p.</HI> 7.—
"'Tis the <HI>Condition</HI> of our final Happiness".
<HI>p.</HI> 10, 28.— It
"renders the Saints amiable in GOD's Sight, and is the <HI>Condition</HI> of <HI>all</HI> his Favours to them".
<HI>p.</HI> 20.—
"Our <HI>Forgiveness of Sins</HI> and final Acceptance with the Father through the Merits of the Son is upon the CONDITION of Faith, Repentance and <HI>good Living</HI>".
<HI>p.</HI> 29.—
"Those who de∣cry <HI>moral Vertue</HI> — as a Thing of no Avail towards <HI>ob∣taining</HI> the divine Favour, — do in Effect subvert the very fundamental Principles of natural and revealed Re∣ligion"
<HI>p.</HI> 30.— And to the same Purpose he speaks (or rather the <HI>precious Minister of Christ,</HI> as he styles him, whom he quotes with Approbation) in his Remarks. <HI>p.</HI> 30.
"This always was the <HI>Condition</HI> of our Acceptance with GOD, to endeavour to be like GOD in Purity and Ho∣liness, &amp;c. <HI>to cease to do evil,</HI> and <HI>learn to do well</HI>".
— If this be not to set up the personal Righteousness of Men in the Room of the Surety-Righteousness of Christ, I know not what is. Nor do's he mention <HI>imputed</HI> Righ∣teousness, but with a Sneer. (Serm. p. 8, 21.)</P>
<P>But hold, says Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> you mistake me; I have nothing in View thro' out my whole Discourse, but to rescue the Text in <HI>Isaiah</HI> from the Abuse that some put upon it, and meddle nothing with other controverted Points in Divinity that Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> treats upon.— But is
<PB N="39" REF="006764_0042_0000000000000000"/>
not this a plain Imposition upon the Understandings of Men? Can any one read what I have just quoted from him, or turn to the Places in the Sermon refer'd to, and be of this Mind? — Besides, is it not evident from his Introduction and other Parts of his Discourse, that 'tis the <HI>Doctrine</HI> commonly grounded upon the Text, rather than the Mistake of some in the Interpretation of it, that he chiefly assaults?—If the <HI>Calvinistical</HI> Doctrine of <HI>imputed Righteousness</HI> were true, the Words of the Pro∣phet might be applied (at least <HI>allusively</HI>) to the best Righteousness of Men, considered in the Affair of Justi∣fication, tho' not in an absolute Sense: But instead of granting this, he utterly denies, all along in his Discourse, that the Righteousness of good Men may in any Sense be called <HI>filthy Rags</HI>: — Yea, instead of proving his Point by a critical <HI>Analysis</HI> upon the Context (as he should have done, if all his Design had been to have clear'd up the Sense of the <HI>Text,</HI> and not to have meddled with the <HI>Doctrine</HI> that some graft upon it) he endeavours to show from <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>common Sense</HI> (as well as from Revelation) that 'tis absurd and blasphemous to affix this Epithet to personal Righteousness: — And what does this bespeak, but that the <HI>Doctrine</HI> itself is false and erroneous, which is grounded upon the Words? <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>personal</HI> Righ∣teousness is no more a Part of our <HI>justifying</HI> Righteous∣ness, than <HI>filthy Rags</HI> are a Part of our Ornament; Christ's Righteousness being the sole Matter of our Justification. When a <HI>Protestant</HI> argues from <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>common Sense</HI> that the Words, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> cannot be taken literal∣ly; does it not follow from thence, that (in his Judg∣ment) the Doctrine of Transubstantiation cannot possi∣bly be a Matter of divine Revelation? — If he tho't the <HI>Doctrine</HI> true, tho' not proved from the <HI>Text,</HI> the Method that he would take, would be, first to concede to the Truth of it, and then by a particular Consideration of the Words and of the Context, to endeavour to evince that they related to another Matter, and not to that; and would not run to <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>common Sense</HI> to prove the Absur∣dity of the <HI>popish</HI> Construction.— But Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Me∣thod
<PB N="40" REF="006764_0043_0000000000000000"/>
is aliene from this, as I have noted, and shows his true Design, however he is pleased to gloss over the Mat∣ter, and disguise his Intention.</P>
<P>What may further confirm us in this, is his saying,
<Q>The Words of the Text as they are COMMONLY received, are a standing Reflection on all Virtue and good Manners; the most effectual Discouragement that could be given to the Practice of Christian Mo∣rality; and consequently one of the most fatal Snares that could be laid for the Souls of Men.</Q>
—(<HI>Ser.</HI> p. 9.) Is not this a <HI>direct</HI> Stroke against the <HI>commonly received Protestant</HI> Doctrine of Justification, which we hold may be in Part gathered from this Text, but more fully from other Texts? If it tends to <HI>Libertinism,</HI> to argue from <HI>these Words,</HI> that the best Righteousness of Men has not the least Hand in this great Affair, has it not the same Tendency, to argue it from <HI>other Texts</HI>? — Must it not then by necessary Consequence be an unscriptural Doc∣trine? —</P>
<P>And then again, if his Meaning be only to set the World right about one single <HI>Text,</HI> and not to run down commonly received Principles and Doctrines, what is he after in that long Harrangue of his, in <HI>Pag.</HI> 23, 24? Would he throw away so much Rhetoric, in combating a Shadow?— And must the Generality of Christians be represented as Fools and Madmen; as swallowing the greatest Absurdities and most palpable Nonsense; as venting the Fictions of their own Brains, for the Doc∣trines and Precepts of the Gospel; as receiving a Scheme of Religion that in EVERY ARTICLE is a down∣right Affront to common Sense; as being ready to kill the happy <HI>Few</HI> (among whom besure Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> is one) that have <HI>Sense</HI> eno' and dare trust their own Faculties so far, as to <HI>judge in themselves what is right</HI>; and will not renounce their <HI>Reason</HI> in Complaisance to their so∣vereign Dictates: — I say, must a great Part of the Christian World be thus represented, meerly because they don't see just as Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> does about this one Passage of Scripture?— Alas! What <HI>rabble-charming
<PB N="41" REF="006764_0044_0000000000000000"/>
Sounds</HI> have work'd <HI>him</HI> up to such a Pitch of <HI>fiery Bigo∣try</HI> on a sudden!— But if he will honestly confess, that he had a further Reach in these Strokes (as he must do, if he will not renounce his Reason) we will clear him of <HI>Bigotry</HI>; and desire to know, whom they were levelled at.— Perhaps he will turn them off upon the <HI>Papists,</HI> (which would be as natural as several of his Evasions) But this he can't justly do, because <HI>they</HI> are of one Heart and Soul with him in their Construction of this Text, as well as in some other Things.—Whom then must he mean? — Why the stupid and libertine Sect of <HI>Calvi∣nists,</HI> that have such a great Spread in the World, who are such mortal Foes to Reason, [to use some of his own Lan∣guage] who are all for believing, &amp; nothing for doing,— who amuse themselves with a vain and groundless Per∣swasion, that there is no Need of their being righteous themselves, because they have the perfect Righteousness of Christ imputed unto them,— who think it their pe∣culiar Priviledge, to be discharged from their Obligati∣ons to obey their Master, and that they which break his Commandments, stand fairer for his Grace, than those who conscienciously keep them, for fear they should trust to what they do:—And finally, who persecute such as are for the Way of <HI>Truth,</HI> of <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> (viz. Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> and those like-minded) denying them <HI>popu∣lar</HI> Applause or <HI>priestly</HI> Favours, and endeavouring to bring them to Poverty and Contempt.—</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> goes on and says,—
<Q>If you tho't I had taught, that we are perfectly righteous; or that we are as righteous as the Angels in Heaven; or what is worse still, that our Righteousness deserves to be compared with the infinite Purity of the divine Na∣ture; or finally, that we can merit Heaven by it;— If these were your Thoughts, you have mistaken the Man, and are fighting only with your own Shadow.</Q>
— To which he adds,
<Q>I challenge you, or any one, or all of your Attestators, to point out a single Passage in my Sermon where the Doctrine of Justification by the <HI>Merit</HI> of Man's personal Righteousness is asserted,
<PB N="42" REF="006764_0045_0000000000000000"/>
or from whence it can by good and necessary Conse∣quence be infer'd.</Q>
(<HI>p.</HI> 10. REM.)—Here Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> displays his Subtilty (not to say his "<HI>Iesuitical</HI>" Craft) in stating the Points of Doctrine in Mr. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Sermon, so as that he might with the better Grace deny there was any Controversy between them.— But is there not one <HI>chief Point</HI> relating to the Doctrine of <HI>Iustification</HI> left out (besides other Doctrines more cursorily mentioned) wherein they directly militate? Does not Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> say, that the Righteousness of Christ is the only MATERI∣AL, as well as the meritorious Cause of our Justification? And that personal Righteousness or good Works are so far from being the <HI>Condition</HI> or <HI>Cause</HI> of our Justification, that they are only to be consider'd as the <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Ef∣fects</HI> of it, and as a Part of the Salvation purchased by Christ? — Why was not this mentioned, but because he knew in his own Soul, that they were of quite different Sentiments here?—The rankest <HI>Arminian</HI> upon Earth will acknowledge, as far as Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> has done, in one of his best Passages, <HI>viz.</HI>
"Forgiveness of Sin and final Ac∣ceptance with the Father, is thro' the Merits of the Son."
— Or, in other Words (to take the Passage in a favoura∣ble Sense) The Righteousness of Christ (passive) is the only meritorious Cause of our Justification, or of the <HI>For∣giveness of our Sins</HI>▪ (in which they make the Whole of Justification to consist:) But then they add, with Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI>
"That 'tis upon the <HI>Condition</HI> of Faith, Repen∣tance and <HI>good Living.</HI>"
—(SERM. p. 29.)—<HI>All</HI> these, they think, must necessarily <HI>precede</HI> a Man's Justification; and so far
"contribute towards it, and have an actual Influence upon it"
that when he hath attained a <HI>Compe∣tency</HI> of Faith (or a good Creed) Repentance and good Works, he then becomes intitled to the <HI>Merits</HI> of Christ, to the Benefit of his Death &amp; Sufferings, which procured these easy Terms, and make up his Defects: So, upon this Foundation, he may with Comfort apply them to his own Soul.—And is it not evident, from the Quota∣tions already made, and from the whole Run of Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Sermon, that here he is of one Heart and Soul
<PB N="43" REF="006764_0046_0000000000000000"/>
with the <HI>Arminians,</HI> at least, and that he allows no more to Christ's Righteousness than <HI>they</HI> do? And is it not as evident, that 'tis the <HI>contrary</HI> Scheme maintained by Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> i. e. That Christ's Righteousness is the sole MATTER of our Justification; That 'till we are justifi∣ed we cannot perform one good Work, That to suppose good Works (or "good living") have an actual Influ∣ence in the Affair, is to place them in the Room of Christ and his Righteousness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I say is it not manifest, that 'tis <HI>this Scheme of Doctrine,</HI> which is loaded with such Re∣proach thro'out Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Sermon, and is represent∣ed as such a Doctrine of Licentiousness?</P>
<P>These Things consider'd, 'tis astonishing to me (as well as to many others) how Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> dare pretend, that there is <HI>no Controversy</HI> between him and Mr. <HI>Porter</HI> in Regard of the Doctrinals of Religion: — Surely he tho't (as he once and again insinuates he did in his Ser∣mon) that he had none but <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Madmen</HI> to deal with, or he would not have ventur'd upon such a confi∣dent Assertion.—But what is become of his "Honesty and Integrity," or of his "inflexible Virtue," all this while? — Verily he needs Some-body to write "an <HI>Apology</HI>" for him; as much as the Prophet or the good Gentlemen whom he so vilifies. — For my Part, I must say, that I never in my Life read a more <HI>bare-faced</HI> Piece of <HI>Arminianism,</HI> or worse, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>Supervisor</HI> of the Press in this Work happening to be that <HI>Writer,</HI> whom Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> (doubtless from his "inflexible Virtue and good Manners") has gone a little out of his Way to distinguish, by the rare Encomium in his LETTER (<HI>Pag.</HI> 22.) begs Leave, in Return for the Gentlemen's Complement, and in Hopes his "<HI>Patience</HI> will hold out" the Length of a Margin Note, tho' perhaps something tedious and trying, to insert here a few Observations, which may have a happy Tendency to se this <HI>Sermon</HI> in its genuine Light.— And I think, that upon a fair impartial Examination, 'twill be found, it ought to be allow'd the Name of a <HI>Socinian,</HI> rather than an <HI>Arminian</HI> Piece; as partly appears from the Definition it gives of the <HI>Free and Rich Grace of</HI> GOD, already consider'd, and it may be more fully from the Account it gives of CHRIST'S <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Design.</HI>— 'Tis true, Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> seems well acquninted with "the <HI>Magick of</HI> Sounds," as well as the Impression of "Assurance and a <HI>godly Tone,</HI>" and finding perhaps by Experience, how apt
"Hear∣ers are to be <HI>stupify'd</HI> and <HI>bewilder'd</HI> with Sounds,"
and confident Airs, he takes Occasion now and then in his Sermon to make Use of what he calls "<HI>Rabble-charming</HI> Sounds," or Expressions that sound Orthodox, which in some Places, as he saw Occasion, he might deliver with an Air of <HI>Assurance,</HI> and something of a <HI>Tone.</HI> The Phrases I refer to, are such as these — "The <HI>merciful</HI> Tenor of the <HI>Gospel</HI>— "This <HI>mediatorial</HI> and infinitely <HI>gracious</HI> Scheme— "Thro' the <HI>Mediation</HI> of Christ— "Thro' the <HI>Merits</HI> of the Son, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But it's all in loose and general Hints only, attended with Ambiguity, and conveying no distinct determinate Idea: Nor is this unlike the Manner of <HI>Socinian</HI> Writers; who, notwithstanding they deny Christ's <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> yet make no Scruple to adopt such Phrases; nay, seem to use them as freely as Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> and possi∣bly in near the same Latitude of Meaning. — For, as in his <HI>Let∣ter (p.</HI> 9.) he visibly derides the Character of a "bold graceless young <HI>Heretick</HI>;" so by "innumerable broad Hints in his <HI>Seru</HI>" any understanding Reader, without "<HI>inward</HI> Illumination," may plainly discover a <HI>Socinian</HI> Latitude of Thought, particularly as to the <HI>End</HI> of Christ's coming into the World, the <HI>Character</HI> he sustain'd, and the Nature of his <HI>Mediation.</HI> It's very observable, that where he is professedly treating on this Subject (SER. p. 17, 18.) he has not, as I can perceive, any the most distant Hint of <HI>Christ</HI>'s coming to make <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> or <HI>purchase</HI> Salvation▪ even tho' he had so inviting an Occasion for it from that known Principle of those whom he levels his Sermon against, that <HI>Sanctification</HI> is an essen∣tial and glorious Part of the Salvation <HI>purchased</HI> by Christ, and tho' the Drift of his Argument might have naturally led him to seek some Advantage from this profess'd Principle of theirs: Yet here he is all <HI>Silence</HI> (How shall we account for this Conduct of his? Whether it was from a Fear lest he should seem to
"encour∣age an undue and presumptuous <HI>Reliance</HI> on the Merits and Inter∣cession of Christ, to the Contempt of Virtue and good Works▪"
his own Conscience knows best:) and other Ends only of Christ's coming are assign'd.
<Q>Our Saviour (says he) was the great PREACHER <HI>of Righteousness</HI> — He came to <HI>set up in the World the Christian</HI> SCHEME— <HI>to propagate</HI> TRUTH <HI>and</HI> VERTUE among Mankind — In his Life and Practice he <HI>fulfill'd all Righteousness,</HI> to set us an EXAMPLE <HI>of doing likewise</HI> — To <HI>recommend</HI> which to Mankind, he both <HI>lived</HI> and <HI>preached</HI> it up, and <HI>sealed</HI> the Truth of his <HI>Doctrine</HI> with his most precious <HI>Blood.</HI></Q>
— This is the Sum total of Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Account of Christ's mediatorial Un∣dertaking: and not a Word in it, you see, of any View the Media∣tor had to making <HI>Satisfaction, purchasing</HI> Redemption, or fulfilling all Righteousness <HI>in our Stead:</HI> Which altho' apparently from Scrip∣ture the sole <HI>Foundation</HI> of the Religion of JESUS, nevertheless Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> confidently insists upon <HI>personal Righteousness</HI> as
"the <HI>Basis</HI> as well as <HI>the whole Superstructure</HI> of this his Divine Religion."
And, which is truly remarkable, this Gentleman lays down the follow∣ing Position very peremptorily—
<Q>It is <HI>this</HI> and ONLY <HI>this Righ∣teousness</HI> (which some are pleased to call <HI>filthy Rags</HI>) which Christ preaches up thro' the <HI>Whole</HI> of that Divine Sermon on the <HI>Mount</HI>; which contains the Sum and Substance of his <HI>whole Doctrine.</HI></Q>
— Now, if this be <HI>Fact,</HI> in both Parts of the Assertion, no Wonder that Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> should make that Observation (<HI>p.</HI> 30.)
<Q>To <HI>preach up</HI> chiefly what Christ himself laid the <HI>chiefest Stress</HI> upon (whe∣ther this was not <HI>moral Virtue,</HI> let every one judge from his Discourses) must certainly, in the Opinion of all sober Men, be call'd truly and properly, and in the <HI>best</HI> Sense, <HI>preaching of</HI> CHRIST.</Q>
— And no Wonder, he calls <HI>moral Virtue</HI>
"the BASIS and in short <HI>the</HI> WHOLE SUPERSTRUCTURE"
of the <HI>Christian</HI> Re∣ligion. For if Christ's Sermon on the <HI>Mount</HI> contains his <HI>whole Doctrine</HI> in Sum and Substance, and <HI>this</HI> and <HI>only</HI> this Righteousness (or personal Goodness and Virtue) is what he preaches up thro' the <HI>Whole</HI> of that Sermon; then it's a clear Consequence, that Christ's <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> or his <HI>fulfilling all Righteousness</HI> in our Stead, neither is contain'd in that <HI>Sermon,</HI> nor is any substantial Branch of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Christ, is neither itself the <HI>Basis,</HI> nor Faith in it any Part of the <HI>Superstructure</HI> of his Divine Religion.
"The plain Truth of the Case is this;"
Either Christ's <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> by fulfilling all Righteousness in our Stead, <HI>is</HI> included among the Contents of that <HI>Sermon</HI>; or it is <HI>not:</HI> and let Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> make the Assump∣tion which Way he will, one Part or other of his Assertion must be false. For if <HI>Christ</HI>'s Satisfaction or Righteousness <HI>is</HI> included, then <HI>personal</HI> Righteousness or moral Virtue is not the <HI>only</HI> Righ∣teousness he preaches up, thro' the <HI>Whole</HI> of that Sermon: And if it be <HI>not</HI> included, then either that Sermon do's not comprehend the <HI>Whole</HI> System of Christ's <HI>Doctrine,</HI> or else Christ's Satisfaction is <HI>no</HI> Doctrine of <HI>his,</HI> at least is not of the <HI>Substance</HI> of his Doctrine, not a Doctrine of any <HI>Importance</HI> in the Scheme of Christianity.— However, Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> perhaps is mistaken in Point of <HI>Fact</HI>; and I think, may be easily convinced of it, if he will only consult that one Clause of this Divine Sermon, in <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.17. Where he must own, Christ himself declaring the grand Design of his Coming, preaches up <HI>his own Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction:</HI> unless he will further betray himself by adopting the <HI>Socinian</HI> Gloss on the Place, which makes Christ's <HI>fulfilling the Law</HI> to consist only in giving a perfect <HI>Exposition</HI> and a perfect <HI>Example.</HI> — But if Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> can allow himself to <HI>Socinianise</HI> here, I shall less wonder at his Con∣duct in setting forth the commonly receiv'd Doctrine of Christ's <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in the Manner he has done, with such an Air of <HI>Bur∣lesque,</HI> as in the following Passage of his Sermon. (<HI>p</HI> 25.)
"GOD is already SATISFIED in all his Demands, his <HI>Law,</HI> his <HI>Honour,</HI> his RIGOROUS RELENTLESS <HI>Iustice</HI> are all SATISFIED, and there is nothing left for <HI>Man</HI> to do, but to believe this undoubting∣ly,"
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>—Yet I confess, I should wonder, if any one cou'd indulge himself thus in Banter (almost to Profaneness) on this sacred Subject, and vent such "unsanctify'd Spleen" in a Case of eternal Concern∣ment, who had any real Belief of the Doctrine of Christ's <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> or at least who had any due Conception of its infinite Importance in the Christian Scheme, and saw the Necessity of its being be∣lieved and preached, with a View to discover and display the <HI>ex∣ceeding Riches of Divine Grace</HI> in Man's Redemption by the <HI>Blood of Atonement.</HI></P>
<P>In short then, never call any Piece <HI>Calvinistical,</HI> never call it so much as <HI>Arminian,</HI> that disowns and treats with Indignity such a grand Article of the Christian Revelation, as Christ's <HI>Satisfaction.</HI> No, it deserves no better Name than that of <HI>Socinian.</HI>—But I recollect, Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> has enter'd his Caveat against "<HI>calling Names,</HI>" in Con∣troversy: nor am I fond of doing it, especially with <HI>personal</HI> Appli∣cation. I shall therefore wave calling <HI>him</HI> by any Name, unless it be the Reverse of that <HI>long</HI> Name he has honour'd <HI>me</HI> with in his Letter: but for a <HI>concise</HI> one, I refer him to his Friend Dr. MAYHEW, who may best know the Name and secret History of that new Sect he has discover'd, and very consistently chastis'd in one of his printed Lectures (p. 148, 149.) whose distinguishing Tenet▪ I perceive, is this.
"That Christ did not preach the Gospel, nor de∣sign'd to do it, <HI>but</HI> his Doctrines and Manner of Preaching were <HI>LEGAL;</HI>"
Or, which is the same Thing, that
"the <HI>WHOLE</HI> Te∣nor of our Lord's Preaching was moral;"
in short, That Christ al∣ways preached the Law, and never the Gospel. — A Tenet, as it happens, bordering pretty near upon Mr. BRIANT'S; <HI>That</HI> it is MORAL VIRTUE, <HI>this and</HI> ONLY <HI>this Righteousness, which Christ preaches up thro' the</HI> WHOLE <HI>of his divine Sermon on the Mount; which contains the Sum and Substance of his</HI> WHOLE <HI>Doctrine.</HI> — But whether <HI>he</HI> is one of this <HI>new Sect,</HI> his Intimate who made the Discovery of it, can best inform. — In the mean Time, I shall study for no "odious Appellations;" and desire always to be careful how I mingle <HI>personal</HI> Reflections with Disputes, and that I <HI>take not up a Reproach against my Neighbour</HI>▪ nor <HI>bring a railing Accusation,</HI> as the Manner of some is; to whom I wish better Principles and a better Spirit.</P></NOTE> than Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s
<PB N="44" REF="006764_0047_0000000000000000"/>
Sermon is: And in uncharitable Censures it goes beyond most of the <HI>Arminian</HI> Writers. For while they charge the <HI>Calvinists</HI> with holding Doctrines subversive of Re∣ligion and Godliness, they nevertheless take Care to
<PB N="45" REF="006764_0048_0000000000000000"/>
express their <HI>Charity</HI> for them, as having a quite contra∣ry Design, even to serve Religion, rather than hurt it,
<PB N="46" REF="006764_0049_0000000000000000"/>
not seeing the Consequence of their Principles: But Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> in more Places than one, and I think every where
<PB N="47" REF="006764_0050_0000000000000000"/>
(except in his Quotation from <HI>Foster</HI>) makes them equally bad in <HI>Practice</HI> as in <HI>Principle,</HI> and represents them as the most finish'd Set of Villains upon Earth, — utter Enemies to all Holiness and good Works. — A vile and infamous Satyr indeed!</P>
<P>On this Occasion, I can't help saying, one would think, that these Men who talk so much [in the Pulpit] of the Necessity of personal Righteousness and good Living, and appear so zealous against Libertine-Principles and Practices, would [out of the Pulpit] discover themselves to be some of the <HI>holiest</HI> Men upon Earth: — But alas! is their not too visible Ground for the Observation, which a dignify'd Layman (no Friend to <HI>New-Light</HI>) not long ago made, namely, <HI>That the Men who talk so much of good Works, he tho't, had the least good Works of any Men?</HI>—And what if I should say, that it was spoken with peculiar Reference to Mr. B. and some of his In∣timates?</P>
<P>'Tis in vain to urge Holiness upon Men, without lay∣ing a proper Foundation for it in Union with Christ by Faith, in the Regeneration of the Soul which is dead in Trespasses and in Sins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>— Without this, Ministers do but build Castles in the Air.— But what of this ap∣pears in Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Sermon? — Doesn't he seem to hold forth all along, that there is a sufficient Foundation for Holiness laid in the <HI>Nature</HI> of Man; so that 'tis but improving his natural <HI>Reason</HI> and Power of <HI>moral Agen∣cy,</HI> and he will arrive to it?</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But does not he hold forth the Necessity of the <HI>Spirit</HI>'s <HI>Influence</HI> in his Sermon?— I answer, Yes; but the Influence Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> speaks of, is only upon "<HI>Minds well disposed</HI>" already, and meerly in a Way of "<HI>Concurrence.</HI>" They first rightly improving what they have by <HI>Nature,</HI> then the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD comes in, to assist in compleating the Work; co-operating with them 'till all the Divine <HI>Virtues are produced,</HI> and they have
"put on the <HI>New-Nature</HI> of Right Action."
SER. p. 16,—19.)—This is the Scheme of Doctrine, by which he hopes to serve the Cause of Virtue and true Religion
<PB N="48" REF="006764_0051_0000000000000000"/>
in the World:—Yet isn't it in truth but poorly served," as he himself seems to be sensible? (Pag. 29.) Has not such Sort of Preaching rather a Tendency to banish it out of the World?—How many, that have endeavour'd to practise upon this Scheme, have afterwards confess'd, that they found all their Labour to be in vain; that not∣withstanding their strongest Resolutions and Endeavours, they could not get the <HI>Victory</HI> over their <HI>inward Corrup∣tions,</HI> whatever <HI>Restraint</HI> was laid upon the <HI>outward Acts?</HI>— But that when GOD had discover'd the <HI>Gospel-Way of Salvation</HI> to them, and had wro't in them the <HI>Belief of the Truth,</HI> they then immediately found what they be∣fore sought in vain; the Power of their Corruptions was broken, and the Practice of Sin with Delight, cast off!</P>
<P>Before I leave this Head, I can't but just take Notice how Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> seems to flout at
<Q>some of the most pious and zealous of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Embassadors,</HI> their bitter Cry about the present Decay of Zeal for the Faith of the Fathers;</Q>
and what a <HI>Slur</HI> he casts upon our vene∣rable <HI>Fore-Fathers</HI> in that rude Expression,
"the <HI>Faith</HI> which was then <HI>imported.</HI>"
(p. 20. REM.) — How con∣temptible does this <HI>Faith</HI> appear in his Eyes, when he speaks of it in such a ludicrous Manner?—And what a mean Opinion has he of the <HI>Importers</HI> themselves, as well as <HI>their Principles?</HI></P>
<P>Having thus renew'd and confirm'd the Charge of <HI>Arminianism</HI> bro't against Mr. <HI>B.</HI> (in which 'tis Pity he has so many Abettors, whether among the <HI>Clergy</HI> or <HI>Laity</HI>) I now proceed to the other Thing propos'd.</P>
<P N="2">II. To take some Notice of Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Remarks upon the Word, <HI>Our,</HI> in his Text; his changing of which for the Word <HI>Their,</HI> in his Sermon, the Attesta∣tors thought to be a great Abuse of the Text, by al∣tering the Sense of it.</P>
<P>The Sum and Substance of what he here says, is this,
<Q>May we not rationally suppose, that the Prophet is here speaking in a <HI>publick Capacity,</HI> and that he was the <HI>Peo∣ple's Mouth</HI> to GOD in this humble Confession; and of Consequence, not designing to include himself, or to
<PB N="49" REF="006764_0052_0000000000000000"/>
speak of his own personal (but only of a general) Guilt.</Q>
— But what Necessity is there of supposing this? — Does not the Word, <HI>Our,</HI> in it's natural Import include, not only the Prophet, but all the Righteous in the <HI>Iewish</HI> Na∣tion? — Why then must we depart from the proper and literal Sense of the Term? — Mayn't another, that is an Enemy to the Doctrine of <HI>Assurance,</HI> as well come and say, that he <HI>supposes,</HI> the Prophet does not include himself, but is only personating a few extraordinary good Men in the <HI>Iewish</HI> Church, when he says in this Prayer, <HI>Doubtless thou art our Father,— Thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer — We are thine — We shall be saved,</HI> &amp;c.— Would not his Reasoning be as cogent and con∣clusive, as Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s? — And must not the Doctrine of <HI>Assurance</HI> necessarily fall before him; this Construc∣tion affording him a Key to get rid of all the <HI>We's</HI> and <HI>Our's</HI> and other appropriating Terms in the Bible, on which some lay so much Stress in Support of this Doc∣trine? — But surely Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> will not admit of this; since he is such an Enemy to all Doctrines, that tend
<Q>to rob sincere upright Christians of that divine Com∣fort they are the proper Heirs of, and to fill their Minds with needless Fears and Scruples about their spiritual State.</Q>
— And therefore we may rationally conclude, <HI>he</HI> will readily grant, that the Prophet includes himself, as well as other good Men of that Time, in <HI>these</HI> Passages: — And if so, I would ask, why the Words, <HI>Our</HI> and <HI>We,</HI> must not be understood in the same Latitude and Extent thro'out this Prayer? —</P>
<P>No, this can't be, says Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> because of some Passages in the <HI>Context,</HI> &amp;c. But what are these? — The first he alledges is in the same Verse with his Text; <HI>We are all as an unclean Thing.</HI> Upon which he remarks,
<Q>The Prophet must (unless you will confound all Cha∣racters) here personate the <HI>Iewish</HI> Church and People, and speak in their Names.</Q>
— But why can't a good Man speak thus, including himself, without confound∣ing Characters? — Pray, what does that Confession a∣mount to, more than this, <HI>We are all Sinners,</HI> or, <HI>We
<PB N="50" REF="006764_0053_0000000000000000"/>
are all defiled with Sin</HI>? — And mayn't a good Man in∣tend himself, as well as others, in such an Expression, without setting himself upon a Level with the worst of Sinners; or without making himself a Sinner of equal Degree with them? — Does not the Apostle say, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver Me,</HI> &amp;c? —And does <HI>he</HI> confound Characters here? — What does the Expression import, but the deep Sense he had of his na∣tive Corruption, which mixed it self with and adhered to his very best Performances? — And does not <HI>Iob</HI> (the best Man then alive) say, <HI>Behold, I am vile,</HI> i. e. a wretched, filthy, polluted Creature! <HI>Chap.</HI> XL.—And why mayn't <HI>Isaiah</HI> be understood as speaking in the same Sense with these good Men, in this Part of his Confession, as far as it related to himself? — 'Tis certain, the godly are conscious of such Defects and Failures in them∣selves, and such Proneness to Sin, that they find just Cause, in Confessions of Sins, to join themselves with o∣ther Men; —as this very Prophet elsewhere doth. Chap. VI.5. <HI>Wo is me, for I am undone, because I am a Man of unclean Lips, and I dwell in the midst of a People of unclean Lips.</HI>— And pray, what more is there in the Words which Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> brings as an Objection, than in the Words now quoted? — The Prophet indeed speaks of the <HI>Uncleanness of his Lips</HI>; but doesn't that imply some <HI>Uncleanness of Heart</HI> too? — <HI>For out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth speaketh.</HI> Matt. XII.34. And he speaks likewise in as strong Terms of <HI>his own</HI> Un∣cleanness, as of that of the <HI>People's:</HI> — Isn't there then as great a Confusion of Characters here, as can possibly be supposed in the other Place? — What Evasion can Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> have here?— He must e'en fight it out with the Prophet, if he still thinks it Confusion, or a blend∣ing of Characters, to join Saints and Sinners in the same general Confession.</P>
<P>I have sometimes tho't, how Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> would have triumph'd in it as an Argument ungainsayable, if the Prophet, instead of speaking so particularly in this Place, had only said in general, <HI>Wo to</HI> us; WE <HI>are undone, for</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="006764_0054_0000000000000000"/>
WE <HI>are</HI> ALL <HI>of unclean Lips.</HI>— How strongly would he have pleaded, that the Prophet could not possibly in∣clude himself, but only spake as the Representative of the People? And how easily would he have got rid of the <HI>Us</HI> and <HI>We</HI> and <HI>All</HI> in the Text? — What, a good Man and a Prophet (he would have been ready to say)
"One that was all along in the full Exercise of Grace"▪
and yet <HI>undone!</HI> Under a <HI>Wo</HI>▪ and a base <HI>foul-mouth'd</HI> smutty "Fellow"! — It would be almost "Blasphe∣my", to suppose it. — It would be an evident
<Q>con∣founding of all Distinctions between Good and Evil, be∣tween the Saint and the Sinner.</Q>
— This surely would have been a much better Plea, than any he has produc∣ed; but with what an ill Grace does it appear now? — And Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> if he has the humble Spirit of the in∣spired Prophet, will confess <HI>himself</HI> to be a <HI>Man of unclean Lips,</HI> and <HI>as an unclean Thing.</HI> Which of the Command∣ments does he keep as he should, without defiling him∣self with the Breach thereof, in Thought, Word, or Deed?</P>
<P>This Text may serve as a Key, to unfold all the o∣ther <HI>parallel</HI> Places, that he alledges, wherein he thinks that the Word, <HI>Our,</HI> must not be taken personally, but representatively▪ it being as rational to suppose that the Prophet takes in himself there, as in this Place, since the Expressions are not so strong as they be here.— And thus I might fairly dismiss the Point.—But left he should think this a meer Evasion, I shall a little consider the other Places mentioned.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Isai,</HI> LXIII.17. still a Part of this Pray∣er, —<HI>Why hast thou hardned OUR Heart from thy Fear?</HI> —
<Q>If you apply this to the Prophet (says Mr. <HI>B.</HI>) you fix the worst of Characters, that is any where given of the most abandon'd Men on Earth, on one of the best of Men then alive.</Q>
— I answer, there are <HI>Degrees</HI> of Hardness; — Reigning Hardness of Heart is indeed the proper Character of the worst of Men; but is there not some Spice of this Hardness (tho' not reigning) in the best of Men? — <HI>As far as Sin remains in them, so far their
<PB N="52" REF="006764_0055_0000000000000000"/>
Hearts are hard</HI>; and therefore they may well include themselves in such general Expressions. — How often do we read of <HI>Hardness of Heart</HI> in the very <HI>Apostles,</HI> the best Men then on Earth? <HI>Mark</HI> vi.52.—viii.17.— xvi.14.— Hence it is, that Christians in general are thus cautioned, Heb iii.13 <HI>Exhort one another daily,</HI>— <HI>lest any of you be hardned,</HI> &amp;c. — But what is all this to the Purpose? will Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> say. This was not the Case of <HI>Isaiah</HI> at this Time; — His Heart was not hardned, when he made this Prayer; but he appears to be in a high Exercise of Grace. — I readily grant, that he was so, and that a hardned Frame of Spirit is inconsistent with the Exercise of Grace;— But then I say, that a <HI>Sensibility</HI> of Hardness, and the Exercise of Grace, are no Ways inconsistent:— A Sense of Hard∣ness argues Tenderness; a Heart that's truly hard, is no Ways sensible of it; but is stupid and secure.—This we may see in the Instance of <HI>David</HI>; how careless and se∣cure was he, while under the Prevalence of a hardned Frame of Heart! But when he came to renew Acts of Grace, how sensible was he of this Hardness, and how does he lament it and mourn over it? — The more strong and lively the Exercise of Faith is, the more will a Person see of his <HI>inherent Pravity,</HI> and of the natural Hardness of his Heart:— The Light of Faith is an humbling Thing; in this Light we see our Darkness: A View of Christ in his Glory will give us a View of our own Vileness and Deformity, and abase us to the lowest. This we may see in the Instances of <HI>Iob,</HI> Chapt. xl.4. &amp; xlii.6. of <HI>Agur,</HI> Prov. xxx. and of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Chap. vi.5. And this is agreeable to the Experience of all the Children of GOD. — (Mr. BRIANT, <HI>art thou a Master in</HI> Israel, <HI>and knowest not these Things!</HI>—) Well may they therefore use such self-abasing Expressions in their Con∣fession of Sin to GOD, relative to their own Case.</P>
<P>The next parallel Text urged, is <HI>Isai.</HI> lix.12— <HI>Our Transgressions are multiplied</HI>:— And then follows an Enumeration of some particular Transgressions, as <HI>Ly∣ing, Oppression,</HI> &amp;c. which the Prophet could not be
<PB N="53" REF="006764_0056_0000000000000000"/>
guilty of.— To this I answer, that the Prophet might include himself in the <HI>general</HI> Confession (as being a Sin∣ner,) tho' in the <HI>particular</HI> Confession following (in which he does not so much as mention the Word <HI>Our</HI>) he may have more especial Reference to the People. — Isn't it the Intent of all faithful Ministers, when they use such general Phrases in their Prayers, to include themselves; altho' when they come to Particulars, they recite chiefly the Sins of the People?—</P>
<P>But what if we should go a Step higher, and suppose, a good Man should intend himself (as well as others) both in the general and <HI>particular</HI> Confession, would there be any Absurdity in it?— Might he not well in∣clude himself, upon such Grounds as these, (1.) As hav∣ing within himself the <HI>Seeds</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> of all the Sins confess'd, yea, and of <HI>all Sin</HI> (tho' the reigning Power thereof be broken in him) which, if GOD should with∣hold his Grace, might speedily break forth into Act?— Or (2.) As having made himself in some Measure <HI>Par∣taker of other Men</HI>'s <HI>Sins,</HI> by not mourning for them as he ought, by not being as earnest as he should in cry∣ing for Pardon, and in seeking to turn away divine Ven∣geance, by not bearing due Testimony against them, and in not using utmost Endeavours to put a Stop to their Progress, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — Can the best justify themselves as to these Things altogether?</P>
<P>But this could not be the Case of the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> will Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> say, who was ever faithful in these Re∣gards.— I answer, If he thus objects, he has more Charity for the Prophet, than he had for himself: For what does he mean, when he says, Chap. vi.5. <HI>Wo is me, for I am undone, because I am of unclean Lips</HI> (which some read, <HI>I have held my Peace,</HI> I have been too silent in the Cause of God, too little of a Monitor and Re∣prover, too neglectful of Prayer, <HI>&amp;c.) and I dwell in the midst of a People of unclean Lips.</HI> — Is it not as if he had said, besides my own personal Uncleanness, I have the Uncleanness of the People in some Measure to answer for; "I have both by my Omissions and Commissions
<PB N="54" REF="006764_0057_0000000000000000"/>
involved my self in the Guilt of their Sins, and there∣fore may justly fear to partake of their Plagues? <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pool</HI> in Loc.</NOTE>— Or what was the Prophet's Intent, when he cries out, <HI>My Leanness, my Leanness! Wo unto me!</HI> Chap. xxiv.16. Doesn't it imply some <HI>Sense of Unfaithfulness</HI> in his Of∣fice, as well as <HI>want of Success?</HI>— But if he had not acknowledged it in plain Terms, we might have argued it from the Nature of the Thing; since to suppose the Prophet had nothing to confess in these Respects, would be to suppose him perfect: and I suppose Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> no Friend to the Doctrine of Perfection in this Life.</P>
<P>For my Part, I can't see the Propriety of Ministers saying <HI>We,</HI> or <HI>Our,</HI> in particular Confessions of Sin, without they are in some Sense (either more nearly or remotely) guilty of what they confess.—Suppose, GOD had taught us by the Ministry of spotless Angels (instead of sinful Men) as he might have done; how would such Expressions sound from their Mouths, <HI>We are all as an unclean Thing:—Our Transgressions are multiply'd; Lying, Oppression, Revolt, uttering from the Heart Words of Falsehood,</HI> &amp;c. — Is not the Thing too shocking to imagine?— And then further, can we find any Instance of the Man Jesus Christ's expressing himself thus, as the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the People, while on Earth (I don't remember any at present) even tho' he <HI>bare our Sins in his own Bo∣dy on the Cross!</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have consider'd the several Instances bro't by Mr. <HI>Briant,</HI> wherein he thinks the Words, <HI>We,</HI> &amp; <HI>Our,</HI> cannot be taken in a personal, but only in a relative Sense, as it is used by the Prophet in the Capacity of a pub∣lick Representative of the People. — And upon laying these Things together, doesn't it appear probable, at least, that he was under a gross Mistake?</P>
<P>But after all, if we should grant for Argument's sake (tho' I see no Reason to grant it) that good Men may in some Cases use the Word, <HI>Our,</HI> in Confessions of Sin, when they don't mean to include themselves; it will not follow, that this was the Case of the Prophet in
<PB N="55" REF="006764_0058_0000000000000000"/>
the <HI>Text</HI>; there may not be the <HI>same Reason</HI> for the one, as for the other; in the former Case, they could not perhaps include themselves <HI>consistently with Truth</HI>; but here the Prophet <HI>may</HI>; for it is certainly <HI>true,</HI> that even <HI>his Righteousness</HI> was as <HI>filthy Rags</HI>▪ view'd comparative∣ly, or in respect of Justification before God; which is all we plead for. — Mr <HI>Briant</HI> himself in effect grants this, and so destroys the Force of his own Argument, when he says in his Letter to Mr. <HI>Porter,</HI> (p. 17.)
<Q>You suppose, the Prophet is confessing the Insufficiency of Man's <HI>best</HI> personal Righteousness to Justification:— This, I grant, would sound very well; it would be a great Expression of Humility and Self abasement, as to the godly Part of them, to acknowledge that after all their virtuous Attainments, they could not stand Tryal by the Law of perfect Obedience, but must have Recourse to the <HI>free unbo't Grace of GOD</HI> for Pardon and Acceptance.</Q>
— Now I say,
"if it sound <HI>very well,</HI> and be a great Expression of <HI>Humility,</HI>"
for the Prophet to make such a Sort of Confession, or to comprehend himself in it (with other good Men,) he certainly <HI>might do it consistent with Truth:</HI>— What then is become of all Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s Arguings (from parallel Texts and otherways) to prove, that he <HI>could not</HI> mean himself personally without <HI>speaking falsely</HI>; which is plainly what he is after, both in this and the foregoing Head (on the Word, <HI>All</HI>) or he says nothing to the Purpose?— Surely he had forgotten this Concession, or he would not have so palpably contradicted himself — But if Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> (to free himself from Contradiction) should deny his Meaning to be as I have represented it namely, that the Prophet could not intend himself with¦out speaking falsely; then this is the Amount of his Arguments, put into a proper Form.— If the Word <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sometimes stands for <HI>Many,</HI> and the Word, <HI>Our,</HI> for <HI>Their</HI> or <HI>Your,</HI> in some particular Passages of Scripture▪ because the Speaker could <HI>not</HI> comprehend himself, o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every Individual, without speaking falsely; then they must be so taken in this Text also, where the Speaker
<PB N="56" REF="006764_0059_0000000000000000"/>
<HI>may</HI> comprehend himself, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without speaking falsely. —What an absurd Consequence is here! — Yet Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> must necessarily father it, or acknowledge his Self-Contradiction.</P>
<P>However, If we should not take Advantage from "this enormous Blunder" of Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s, but let it pass, what do his Arguments amount to (except what he says upon the Context) but to a meer <HI>begging the Question?</HI>—If he had first proved, that there was good Ground and Reason of restraining and limiting the Words, <HI>All</HI> and <HI>Our,</HI> in several Passages of Scripture; and had then ap∣ply'd it to his <HI>Text,</HI> and shown that there was <HI>the same Ground</HI> of Limitation here, he had so far acted the Part of a <HI>Workman that needeth not to be ashamed,</HI> and had really done something to the Purpose: but what of this appears? In Effect here is nothing but <HI>altum Silentium.</HI> — So that, in fine, we have little more than his bare Word for it (unless it be the few Remarks upon the Context, which have been or shall be immediately con∣sider'd) that the Terms, <HI>All</HI> and <HI>Our,</HI> in the Text, must be taken restrictively, and not in their natural Import.</P>
<P>Let us now hear what he hath further to say upon the Point:—
<Q>I will only add (says he) that for the same Reason the Prophet is here supposed to include himself in the Terms, <HI>All</HI> and <HI>Our,</HI> he must likewise be supposed to include himself in the following Cha∣racter— <HI>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee.</HI> — The Text says, NONE:—But was not that Prophet a Man of Prayer?</Q>
— I answer, Yes; but yet he may include himself notwithstanding; and not only himself, but all the Righteous then alive; of whom doubtless there were <HI>many,</HI> whatever Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> says to the contrary; for the Prophet wrote the latter Part of his Prophecy in the Days of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> in whose Time there was a <HI>great Reformation.</HI> 2 Chron. xxx.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Briant</HI> must necessarily grant, that these Words of the Prophet must be taken with <HI>some</HI> Restriction, and not in the most absolute Sense, as if there were none (to
<PB N="57" REF="006764_0060_0000000000000000"/>
whom they refer) that prayed at all; since he himself says, that this People
<Q>made many and long <HI>Prayers,</HI> insomuch that the Almighty declares (speaking after the Manner of Men) that he was troubled and quite worried out with them.</Q>
(SERM. p. 13.)— And if they must be understood under a Restriction, even when applied to the <HI>Wicked (i. e.</HI> as chiefly holding forth the <HI>Formality</HI> and <HI>Deadness</HI> of their Prayers, rather than their <HI>total Neglect</HI> of them) why mayn't we as well suppose them capable of a further Restriction, so as likewise to be applicable to the Case of the <HI>Righteous?</HI>— May it not in some Sense be said even of them, especially at some particular Times, that <HI>they call not upon GOD's Name.</HI> i. e. They don't do it with that <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Fervency</HI> as they ought, or as it follows in the Verse of the Text, by <HI>stirring</HI> (or awaking) <HI>themselves up to take hold of GOD!</HI> And mayn't the Prophet, when humbling himself before GOD, also put in himself for one among the Subjects of this Complaint, as seeing in the Light of Faith (which was then in Exercise) how far short he came of doing his Duty in the Degree that was required?— Or what if we should suppose that in the <HI>general Declen∣sion</HI> that followed after the <HI>Reformation,</HI> I just mentioned, the Prophet found in himself some <HI>Taint</HI> of this care∣less, prayerless Spirit, as well as other good Men; and should thereupon (when he came to renew Acts of Grace) lament it in such Expressions as these,— <HI>Our Hearts are hardned from thy Fear — There are none that stir up themselves to lay hold of thee,</HI> &amp;c. — I say, would such a Supposition be any Ways absurd, or at all un∣reasonable?</P>
<P>But let that be as it will, I think, the other Solution sufficient, namely, that the Prophet might include him∣self, from a Sense of his Short-comings in the Duties of Faith and Prayer, and their Defectiveness in Degree, of what the Law required, yea, and of what was really at∣tainable in this Life.— Alas!
<Q>in the Prayers of the Saints, at best, there is always too little of Love and Zeal to the <HI>Name of the Lord,</HI> and too little of a <HI>stiring
<PB N="58" REF="006764_0061_0000000000000000"/>
up themselves to take hold of GOD.</HI></Q>
— Suppose, GOD should now give it as the proper Character of the Peo∣ple of this Land (among whom, we trust, there are ma∣ny precious Servants of Christ, who live in the Exercise of Faith,) that <HI>there are none that call upon his Name, that stir up themselves to take hold of him</HI>; — Might not the Conscience of every one apply it to himself? — Would there be a single Man, that dare plead, <HI>not Guilty,</HI> in some Sense or other? — Or if any did, wou'dn't it be a Token of their <HI>Pride,</HI> rather than of their <HI>Humility</HI>; and show their little Sense of the <HI>Spirituality</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of the moral <HI>Law?</HI> Their very Denial would be a Proof of their Guilt. — Would even Mr. <HI>Briant</HI>'s warmest Devotions stand the Test, if try'd by the Law of <HI>Mora∣lity,</HI> which he appears such an Advocate for? Do's he not see moral Failures enough in them to cover him with Confusion and Self-Abasement?</P>
<P>There is another Objection, of a more general Nature, hinted at in Mr. <HI>Briant's</HI> Sermon, which not only affects our Construction of a particular Word, but also the whole <HI>Text,</HI> in the Sense we take it; and that is founded on what is said in the preceeding Verse, <HI>Thou meetest him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteousness,</HI> &amp;c.—Here true Righteousness is highly <HI>commended,</HI> how then can we suppose that the same Righteousness should be so much <HI>depreciated,</HI> almost in the next Sentence? — But lest I should incur the Censure of being "<HI>Verbose,</HI>" I shall wave a particular Answer, and shall refer him to what the Rev. Mr. <HI>Foxcroft</HI> says upon the Point in his sea∣sonable Sermon on the Text (<HI>p.</HI> 6, 7.) where this Objecti∣on is fully refuted.— And as for any other occurring Difficulties, I shall refer to the same Sermon, and to Mr. <HI>Porter</HI>'s Vindication, for a Solution.</P>
<P>And now having finish'd what I at first proposed, I shall close all with some pertinent <HI>Extracts</HI> from the Writings of a <HI>precious Minister of Christ, now with the Lord.</HI>—
<Q>Some think (<HI>says he</HI>) that if good Works, and Holiness, and Repentance, be allowed no Room in Justification, that there is no Room left for them
<PB N="59" REF="006764_0062_0000000000000000"/>
in the World, and in the Practice of Believers.— So hard seems it to be to some, to keep in their Eye the certain fixed Bounds betwixt Justification and Sancti∣fication.</Q>
— Again, speaking of the <HI>Arminianizing</HI> Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> he says; —
<Q>They will not al∣low <HI>the personal Righteousness of Christ to be imputed to us any otherwise than in the Merit of it, as purchasing for us a more easy Law of Grace; in the Observation whereof, they place all our justifying Righteousness:</HI> Un∣derstanding hereby <HI>our own personal inherent Holiness,</HI> and <HI>nothing else.</HI>—They hold, <HI>That Christ died to merit this of the Father,</HI> viz. <HI>That we might be justified upon easier Terms under the Gospel, than those of the Law of Innocency; instead of Iustification by perfect Obedience, we are now to be justified by our own evangelical Righ∣teousness, made up of Faith, Repentance and sincere Obe∣dience.</HI>— And if we hold not with them in this, they tell the World, we are Enemies to evangelical Holi∣ness, slighting the Practice of all good Works, and allowing our Hearers to live as they list.— Thus they slander the Preachers of <HI>free Grace,</HI> because we do not place Justification in our our own inherent Holi∣ness, but in Christ's perfect Righteousness, imputed to us upon our believing in him; which Faith, we teach, purifies the Heart, and always inclines to Ho∣liness of Life.— Neither do we hold any Faith to be <HI>true</HI> and saving, that doth not shew it self by good Works; without which no Man is, or can be justifi∣ed, either in his own Conscience, or before Men.—</Q></P>
<P>And then again;
<Q>They preach up Holiness, as if it was their proper Doctrine, and disowned by us; when they cannot but know in their Consciences, that there is no Difference betwixt them and us, about the <HI>Necessity</HI> of Holiness, but only about it's <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> in Salvation.— We <HI>derive</HI> it from Jesus Christ and Faith in him, and know assuredly that it can spring from nothing else.—We <HI>place</HI> it betwixt Justi∣fication and Glory; and that is it's Scripture-Place, and no where else can it be found or stand, let Men try it as much and long as they will.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="006764_0063_0000000000000000"/>And still further;
<Q>Is it not unaccountable, to charge a People with <HI>Licentiousness,</HI> when the Chargers can∣not deny, and some cannot <HI>well bear</HI> the <HI>Strictness</HI> of their Walk? — It is commonly said, that it is only their <HI>Principles,</HI> and the Tendency of them to loose walking, that they blame. — But it seems not fair to charge a People with licentious Doctrines, when the Professors thereof are approved of for their Godliness; and when they do sincerely profess, that their Godli∣ness begun with, and is promoted by the Faith of their Principles.—</Q></P>
<P>Moreover he says;
<Q>As for <HI>inherent Holiness,</HI> Is it not <HI>sufficiently secur'd</HI> by the <HI>Spirit of Christ,</HI> received by Faith, the certain Spring and Cause of it; by the <HI>Word of GOD,</HI> the plain and perfect Rule of it; by the <HI>declared Necessity</HI> of it to all them that look to be saved, and to justify the sincerity of a Man's Faith? unless we bring it into Justification, and thereby make our own pitiful Holiness sit on the Throne of Judg∣ment, with the precious Blood of the Lamb of GOD.—</Q></P>
<P>He observes further;
<Q>That this Doctrine of Justi∣fication by Christ's Righteousness alone is a <HI>spiritual Mystery,</HI> and lieth not level to a <HI>natural</HI> Understand∣ing. 1 Cor. ii.10, 14.—<HI>Working for Life,</HI> a Man na∣turally understands; but <HI>believing for Life,</HI> he under∣stands not.— To <HI>mend the Old Man,</HI> he knows; but to put <HI>on the New Man by Faith</HI> is a Riddle to him.— The Study of Holiness, and to endeavour to square his Life according to GOD's Law, he knows a little of, tho' he can never do it; but to draw Sanctificati∣on from Christ by Faith, in and thro' the Force of the Spirit of Christ in the Heart by Faith, is meer <HI>Canting</HI> to him.— <HI>A new Life</HI> he understands a little, but no∣thing of a <HI>New Birth</HI> and <HI>Regeneration:</HI> He never saw himself <HI>stark dead.</HI>—Nay, not only is it unknown to the natural Man, but he is by his natural State, an Enemy to it; he neither doth, nor can know it, nor approve of it. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii.14.—</Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="006764_0064_0000000000000000"/>Again he says;
<Q>It is no small Disadvantage this Doctrine of Justification lies under from <HI>the Spirit of this Day,</HI> we live in.—A <HI>light, frothy, trifling Temper</HI> prevails generally: Doctrines of the greatest Weight are talked of and treated about with a vain uncon∣cerned Frame of Spirit, as if Men contended ra∣ther about <HI>Opinions</HI> and <HI>School-Points,</HI> than about the Oracles of GOD, and Matters of Faith.— But if Men's Hearts were seen by themselves, if Sin were felt, if Men's Consciences were enlivened, if GOD's holy Law were known in it's Exactness and Severity, and the Glory and Majesty of the Lawgiver shin∣ing before Men's Eyes, if Men were living as leaving Time and launching forth into Eternity, the Gospel-Salvation by Jesus Christ would be more regarded.—</Q></P>
<P>Furthermore he adds;
<Q>It is not a little provoking, that some are so captious, that no Minister can preach in the hearing of some, (<HI>of the Freedom of GOD's Grace, of the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, of sole and single believing on him for Righteousness and e∣ternal Life, of the Impossibility of a natural Man's do∣ing any good Work, before he be in Christ; of the Im∣possibility of the mixing of Man's Righteousness and Works, with Christ's Righteousness in the Business of Iustification, &amp;c.</HI>) but he is immediately called, or suspected to be an <HI>Antinomian.</HI>— If we say, that <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> is neither <HI>Work,</HI> nor <HI>Condition,</HI> nor <HI>Qua∣lification</HI> in Justification, but is a <HI>meer Instrument,</HI> re∣ceiving (as an empty Hand receiveth the freely given Alms) the Righteousness of Christ; and that in it's very <HI>Act,</HI> it is <HI>a renouncing</HI> of all Things but the <HI>Gift of Grace,</HI> the Fire is kindled; — So that it is come to that, as Mr. <HI>Christopher Fowler</HI> said, <HI>That he that will not be Antichristian, must be called an Antinomian.</HI>— But what shall we do in this Case? What shall we do for Peace with our Brethren?— Shall we lie still un∣der their undeserved Reproaches, and for keeping the Peace, silently suffer others to beat us unjustly? —
<PB N="62" REF="006764_0065_0000000000000000"/>
If it were our own personal Concern, we should bear it: —If it were only their charging us with <HI>Ignorance, Weakness,</HI> and being <HI>unstudied Divines</HI> (as they have used liberally to call all that have not learned and dare not believe their <HI>new Divinity</HI>) we might easily pass it by, or put it up.— But when we see the pure Gospel of <HI>Christ</HI> corrupted, and an <HI>Arminian Gos∣pel</HI> new vampt and obtruded on People, to the certain Peril of the Souls of such as believe it, and our Ministry reflected upon, which should be dearer to us than our Lives, can we be silent! — As we have a Charge from the Lord, to deliver to our People what we have received from him, so as he calls and enables, we are not to give <HI>Place by Subjection, not for an Hour, to such as creep in,</HI> not only <HI>to Spy out,</HI> but to destroy, not so much the <HI>Gospel Liberty,</HI> as the <HI>Gospel Salvation</HI> we have in Christ Jesus, and <HI>to bring us back under the Yoke of legal Bondage.</HI>— And indeed the Case in that <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Galatians</HI> and ours have a great Affi∣nity.—</Q></P>
<P>Once more he says;
<Q>There is not a Minister that dealeth seriously with the Souls of Men, but he finds an <HI>Arminian Scheme</HI> of Justification in every <HI>unrenew∣ed Heart.</HI>— And is it not sadly to be bewailed, that <HI>Divines</HI> should plead that same Cause, that we daily find the Devil pleading in the Hearts of all natural Men? And that instead of <HI>casting down,</HI> 2 Cor. x.4, 5. they should be making Defences for such <HI>strong Holds,</HI> as must either be levelled with the Dust, or the Rebel that holds them out, must eternally perish?</Q></P>
<P>And to the same Purpose he says; —
<Q>Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> his Observation holds good as to all the <HI>Arminian</HI> Di∣vinity, that it is <HI>contra communem Sensum Fidelium, a∣gainst the common Sense of Believers.</HI>—How evident is it, that several, who by <HI>Education,</HI> or an <HI>unsound Ministry,</HI> having had their natural Enmity against the Grace of GOD strengthned; when the Lord by his
<PB N="63" REF="006764_0066_0000000000000000"/>
Spirit hath broke in upon their Hearts, and hath raised a serious Soul-Exercise about their Salvation, their turning to GOD and CHRIST, &amp; their turning from <HI>Arminianism,</HI> have begun together?—And some of the greatest Champions for the Grace of GOD have been Persons thus dealt with, as we might In∣stance—</Q></P>
<P>Finally, he says; —
<Q>Let us make <HI>Christ crucified</HI> our great Study, as <HI>Christians,</HI> and the Preaching of him, our main Work, as <HI>Ministers.</HI> 1 Cor. ii.2. Paul <HI>determined to know nothing else.</HI>— But many manage the Ministry, as if <HI>they had taken up a contrary Deter∣mination,</HI> even to know any Thing, <HI>save Iesus Christ, and him crucified.</HI>— We are amazed to see so many ashamed of the Cross of Christ, and to behave as if they accounted the Tidings of <HI>Salvation,</HI> by the <HI>slain</HI> Son of GOD, <HI>an old antiquated Story,</HI> and unfit to be daily <HI>preached.</HI>— And what comes in the Room thereof, is not unknown, nor is it worth <HI>mentioning.</HI>— For all Things that come in <HI>Christ's Room,</HI> and justle him out, either of <HI>Hearts,</HI> or <HI>Pulpits,</HI> are <HI>alike abomi∣nable</HI> to <HI>a Christian.</HI>— How <HI>many Sermons</HI> may a Man <HI>hear,</HI> and <HI>read,</HI> when <HI>printed</HI>; yea, and <HI>Books written,</HI> about the <HI>Way to Heaven,</HI> wherein is <HI>hardly the Name of Iesus Christ?</HI> —And if he be <HI>named,</HI> it is the <HI>Name of Christ</HI> as a <HI>Iudge</HI> and <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> rather than that of a <HI>Saviour.</HI>—When we cannot avoid the observ∣ing of those sad Things, let it be a sharp Spur to us, to preach Christ more, and live more to his Praise.— Let us not be deceived with that P<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ence, <HI>That Christ may be preach'd, when he is not nam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI>— The Preach∣ing of the Gospel is the <HI>Naming of Christ,</HI> and so called, Rom. xv.20. And <HI>Paul</HI> was to <HI>bear Christ's Name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the Children of Israel.</HI> Act. ix.15.—</Q></P>
<P>Thus that judicious and excellent Divine.—</P>
