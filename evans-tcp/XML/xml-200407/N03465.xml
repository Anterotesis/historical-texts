<P>The Reasonableness of Nonconformity to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in Point of <HI>WORSHIP.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> Defence OF A <HI>SERMON,</HI> preach'd at <HI>Newark,</HI> June 2. 1736. Intitled, <HI>The Vanity of human Institutions in the Worship of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Against the Exceptions of Mr. JOHN BEACH, in his <HI>Appeal to the Unprejudiced.</HI></P>
<P>Done in the Form of a DIALOGUE, wherein Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Arguments are all expressed in his own Words.</P>
<P>By <HI>Ionathan Dickinson,</HI> M. A.</P>
<Q><P>Not every Separation, but only a <HI>causeless</HI> Separa∣tion from the external Communion of any Church, is the Sin of Schism.—<HI>Imposing</HI> upon Men, under Pain of Excommunication, a Necessity of professing known Er∣rors and practising known Corruptions, is a <HI>sufficient</HI> and <HI>necessary</HI> Cause of Separation. — To leave the <HI>Church,</HI> and to leave the <HI>external Communion</HI> of a Church, is not the same Thing.—This little Armour, rightly placed, will repel all those Batteries, which you threaten shall be so furious.</P>
<BIBL><HI>CHILLINGWORTH.</HI></BIBL>
<P>I know that the common Sense of most that are seri∣ous in practical Christianity, is against your <HI>formal Ways of Worship,</HI> and against the Course that you have taken in this Land: but the Spirit of Prophaneness complieth with you, and doteth on you, in all Places that ever I was acquainted in. Bear with plain Truth: it is in a Cause of everlasting Consequence.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IR, having lately published my Ex∣ceptions against your <HI>Vindication,</HI> I have taken the Liberty of waiting upon you in Order to a free Con∣ference upon the Subject debated between us, that I may obtain your Sentiments of my <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, <HI>I have had a Sight of the</HI> DEFENCE <HI>of your Complaints against the Church of</HI> England — <HI>And I have so great a Value for your Person, and so just a Sense of my Obligations to you, that though I am in a poor State of Health, and the Task you have set me, by multiplying your Complaints, will necessarily prove lengthy; yet having, as you tell me, a special Call, and as my own Conscience assures me, a good Cause, I shall cheerfully undertake it.</HI> (p. 1.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Affair before us is a religious D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bate, which therefore deserves to be treated with Meek∣ness and good Temper. Neither your Cause, not
<PB N="2" REF="004237_0007_100428B80A3933E8"/>
mine, will gain any Thing by our violating the Laws of Decency and good Manners. And it concerns us to remember in this Debate, that <HI>the Wrath of Man works not the Righteousness of God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I pray God to give me a deep Sense of his Pre∣sence, &amp; the impartial Account he will call me to for e∣very injurious Expression; and that I may remember, that by my Words I must be justified, or by my Words I must be condemned.</HI> (p. 2.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this your solemn Address to God, I may expect Nothing but fair Treatment, no wrathful Expressions, no unkind Reflections: For those Things you must own would be injurious. And I hope, the Book you object against, has given you no Occasion of any Heat of Spirit; for I am not sensible of any Acrimony of Style, or any abusive Language contained in it. I'm sure I endeavour∣ed in that whole Discourse (notwithstanding all the Provocation given me) to treat you like a Christian, and like a Gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The greatest Trouble I am like to meet with, is the naming your manifold Untruths, Misrepresentations and Slanders. For though you don't think it any Sin in you to commit them; and the Eye cannot see itself; yet I fear you'll count it unpardonable Bitterness in me to tell you, that you have committed them.</HI> (p. 2)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir; have you so soon forgot your solemn Address to God! Could one have expect∣ed, after such serious and solemn Expressions, that your very next Words should have contained so much Heat and Bitterness! Can you perswade your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or perswade the World about you, that these are not <HI>injurious Expressions</HI>? Is it no injury to

represent me to be so harden'd in Impiety, as to think it no Sin to be guilty of manifold Untruths, Misrepresentations and Slanders? I hope, I have not deserved such a Character from you, or from any Man else; And therefore entreat you, to leave off these Invectives, which no Way enter the Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its of the Cause; and I think can be no way serviceable to your Reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Pray, Mr.</HI> D. <HI>free your self from this blind and bitter Zeal,</HI> (p. 3.) <HI>What do you mean by pub∣lishing such a scurrilous Libel</HI>? (p. 6) <HI>You have so accustomed your self to make Complaints against that Church that never hurt or injured you, that you think you may say any Thing right or wrong, so it b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by way of Complaint. As to</HI> notorious Untruths, <HI>I wonder that your Conscience did not say that you a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e now writing such,</HI> (p. 11.) <HI>Pray let me ask you, is there any such Sin as Slandering in the World? if there is, how can you excuse your Assertions, than which No∣thing can be more false.</HI> (Ibid.) <HI>You are so delight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with this vile Slander, that you are never weary of re∣peating it.</HI> (p. 20) <HI>Let me entreat you to be Sober one Moment, and tell me, is this Reasoning, or is it Raving? — I suspect that you are dreaming and talking in your Sleep. — It is a Sign that your Brain is disturbed.</HI> (p. 21.) <HI>Did you use any Prudence, I had almost said Conscience, when you published one of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e blackest Slanders that Pen could write?</HI> (p 52▪) <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I may judge by what I have s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, there is more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Arrogancy in the little Finger of a certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tleman, than I ever observed in all the Bishops I have ever seen.</HI> (p. 54) <HI>Certainly you was reduced to the dol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful Necessity of the Woman</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. JUNO: <HI>Flectere si nequeo Superos, Acheronta movebo.</HI></NOTE> <HI>in the</HI> Poet, <HI>who

being enraged at her Unsuccessfulness in her Attempts, took up this Resolution,</HI>
<Q><L>Since Heaven is deaf, and will no Pity shew,</L>
<L>I'll try what Hell and the black Host can do. (p. 66.)</L></Q></P>

(p. 105)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have met with frequent Complaints, in the Management of Controversy, of Personal Inju∣ry and Abuse: but don't remember that ever I saw a Paral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el to this. How astonishing is this Con∣duct of your's! Is it possible, that a Man under such solemn Impressions of his Account at the Day of Judgment for every injurious Expression, as you just now declared, should be guilty of all these In∣juries? Is it possible for you to represent me as ap∣plying to <HI>Hell</HI> and the <HI>black Host</HI> for Assistance, and in the very same Breath call upon me to remember, that <HI>we write in the Presence of God, and must an∣swer for every unjust Insinuation</HI>? — Can you think that none of these are <HI>injurious Expressions</HI>? Is it no Injury to point me out as a vile scurrilous Libeller, Slanderer and Calumniator, chargeable with noto∣rious Falshood and Untruth, as designedly wor∣shipping
<PB N="5" REF="004237_0010_100428C0F15EF250" MS="y"/>
the Devil, and as acting a Part against my own Conscience &amp;c.? What Cause have I given you to esteem me such a profligate and abandon∣ed Creature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Perhaps you may think I have been too tart in some Expressions. But if you consider that you are the Aggressor, and have without any known Cause, publish∣ed a Set of virulent Charges against the whole Church of England, and all the Rulers of the Nation both ci∣vil and ecclesiastical, who have established and do up∣hold it; you can't but think a little Warmth and Zeal not only pardonable, but even justifiable, in vindicating so vast a Body of abused Persons.</HI> (p. 106.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were this Charge true; and were you ap∣pointed Patron or Advocate of this vast Body of abused Persons, methinks you might have thought of some way to vindicate them without <HI>Swords and Staves.</HI> A good Cause needs no such Methods of Defence; and a bad Cause will gain nothing by them, but deserv'd Contempt▪ — However, I must confess, I am surprized at this Imputation. I thought I had offered all my Exceptions, a∣gainst what we esteem exceptionable in your Church, with as much Temper and Decency as possible. Be pleased to give me some Instances of that Scurrility and Virulency, you so tragically complain of; and I will retract every Thing of that Nature as publickly as you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You have condemned all the Christians upon Earth, excepting a small Handful, as Hypocrites, and vain Worshippers, and hateful to God</HI> (p. 37.) <HI>You say, our Worship is exactly like the Worshippers of</HI> Baal <HI>their crying half a Day,</HI> O Baal, hear us, (p. 48) <HI>You has condemned all Repetitions in Prayer.</HI> (p. 49)
<PB N="6" REF="004237_0011_100403E3EE867DF0"/>
<HI>You call the Cross at Baptism a cursed Instrument, the principal Badge of Popery</HI> (p. 53) <HI>You tell igno∣rant People, that we are like the</HI> Papists <HI>in their Ado∣ration of their breaden God, whom they carry about the Streets, that all People may fall down at the Sight of it, and worship it as God Almighty.</HI> (p. 66.) <HI>You represent our most serious Devotions as vain, hypocritical, like the bruitish Cries of the Worshippers of</HI> Baal, <HI>as hor∣rid Profaneness and mocking of God.</HI> (p. 103.) <HI>Your Book throughout represents the Way that I am leading Souls in, as the certain Road to Hell, my Worship you say is</HI> vain, <HI>my Doctrine is</HI> Arminianism, <HI>and my Dis∣cipline none at all: and is not this the broad Way to Destruction</HI>? (p. 105.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find many more such like Charges in your <HI>Appeal to the unprejudiced.</HI> But I can't but esteem this as an Aggravation, instead of an Excuse, of your bitter injurious Treatment. — For it's most cer∣tain, that there are no such Expressions in my Book; but your self is the Author of 'em all. You seem now to have lost the <HI>deep Sense of God's Presence, and the impartial Account he will call you to for every injurious Expression,</HI> which you so serious∣ly desired to keep the Impression of. Are these Re∣presentations no injurious Expressions? Or am I so vile an Antagonist, as to be incapable of receiving Injuries, that you are so forward to fasten any Sort of Charges upon me, that you are willing to have me wear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I am resolved to be so far from exaggerating, that I will silently pass over many of your lesser Mistakes, when they don't affect the Cause, though I am persuad∣ed, that you would insult over your Adversary more than a little, if you found him guilty of such Blunders as in</HI> p 85, <HI>where you reckon up the several Steps Christ
<PB N="7" REF="004237_0012_100428CD010B1ED0" MS="y"/>
took to accomplish our Redemption. First you reckon his</HI> Nativity, <HI>and secondly his</HI> Birth, <HI>by which it is evident, that you don't know, that his</HI> Nativity <HI>and</HI> Birth <HI>are the same Thing.</HI> (p. 2.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could have pointed out to you several more such Mistakes of the Press in that same Dis∣course, that would have given you like Cause of Triumph. But these (it seems) you have over∣look'd; and found out but this single Blunder (as you are pleased to call it) to make your self merry with. This however you are willing to set in as a ludicrous a View as you can, for the Diversion of your self and your Reader. And since you are in this pleasant Mood, will you be pleased to ac∣cept of a <HI>Rowland</HI> for your <HI>Oliver,</HI> which shall be at your Service upon the easy Condition of your answering a few Questions. And first,</P>
<P>What Reason had you, in your <HI>Vindication,</HI> to charge me with <HI>notorious Untruths</HI> &amp;c.?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I would not call it a Lie, because that is provok∣ing. I dare not call it a Mistake, for I could not believe so knowing a Gentleman as you could so mistake</HI> (p. 10) <HI>If your strange Mistakes had been committed by some old Woman, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould pass them by with a Smile; but in so knowing and judicious a Man as you it is unaccount∣able.</HI> (p. 40.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the Character of one who don't know that <HI>Nativity</HI> and <HI>Birth</HI> are the same Thing It seems then, that I am a very ignorant, knowing and judicious Man. But what do you think of my objecting against the <HI>Repetitions</HI> in the Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any?</P>

<P><HI>Tho' I am under no Necessity; yet to gratify your Importunity, I will tell you what I have learn'd to believe, by the little Acquaintance I have had with the Writings of our Clergy.

<P>As to the other Articles debated between the <HI>Arminians</HI> and us, you don't tell us what is the sound Sense in which you believe them, whe∣ther it be an <HI>Arminian</HI> or a <HI>Calvinist</HI> Sense.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A new Paradox! The Wrath and Curse of God is due to every Child, born into the World, for <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin: And yet it is impossible, that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Posterity should be the Subjects of God's Wrath and Curse, but for their own <HI>personal</HI> Guilt and Wickedness.

<P>It is a black and horrid Charge, to impute the innocent orthodox Heresy of <HI>Arminianism</HI> to your Clergy. As for <HI>your self,</HI> you are no <HI>Arminian</HI>; for you believe <HI>original Sin</HI>: and so did <HI>Arminius.</HI>

You believe the Wrath and Curse of God for <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, due to every Child born into the World; and yet due to none, but for their own <HI>personal</HI> Guilt and Wickedness.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>That we may "<HI>come out of the Clouds,</HI>" and not contend in the Dark, it will be proper to state the Case something particularly; and then let the
<PB N="13" REF="004237_0018_100428DAD9AD0368" MS="y"/>
World judge, who requires as a religious Duty, what God has not required as such; who are chargeable with Impositions upon Men's Conscien∣ces, and with <HI>teaching for Doctrines the Command∣ments of Men,</HI> you or We.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> is establish'd upon a Hierarchy, consisting of <HI>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons, Deans, Prebendaries, Rectors, Curates</HI> &amp;c. to whom may be added a List of <HI>Lay</HI>-Officers, such as <HI>Chancellors, Commissaries, Proctors, Apparitors</HI> &amp;c. None of whom (as established in the Church of <HI>England</HI>) do we find once mention'd in the Scriptures. The inferior Clergy must, upon their Admission to Orders, swear to perform true and canonical Obedience to the Bishop, and to his Successors; tho' required to <HI>call no Man Master, but Christ.</HI> When ordain'd to the Ministry, and by the awful Bonds of that sacred Character, oblig∣ed to preach the Gospel, to be <HI>instant in Season▪ and out of Season,</HI> they are not allowed to preach without the Bishop's Licence. That an unlicenced Minister is bound by his Office to preach the Gos∣pel; but by this Order of your Church forbid to preach, till he has paid for a Liberty to do his Duty. You tell us, that Christ has committed the Government of his Church only to the Bi∣shops; and yet a considerable Part of the Church of <HI>England</HI> is exempt from episcopal Jurisdiction. Of this Dr <HI>Whithy</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon <HI>Rom.</HI> XIV 6.</NOTE> complains, that
<Q>the Exemp∣tions settled by the papal Authority, do put many Parts of this Church into a very disjointed State; while in some Places the Laity, and in many others the Presbyters, exercise episcopal
<PB N="14" REF="004237_0019_100428DC80A2FE90"/>
Jurisdiction, independent on the Bishops, in Contradiction to their Principles.</Q>
In these Exemptions, it's certain, the Bishop has no Juris∣diction at all. And the Case is not much better any where else: For tho' the <HI>spiritual Courts</HI> be held in the Name of the Bishop; yet the Power of Excommunication and Absolution belongs to meer <HI>Laymen,</HI> who proceed without the Bishop's Direction; and can legally proceed most contrary to his Will. That altho' all Power of Discipline i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> held to be vested in him; yet he can exercise none, but as these <HI>Laymen</HI> please.
<Q>Discipline (says one of your own Authors) is lost; and will not be permitted by the State, which by vertue of <HI>Conge d'estires, Quare Impedits,</HI> Prohibi∣tions &amp;c. have made themselves the sole and ultimate Judges, not only of all Bishops and Churches; but of their Excommunications, and every Exercise of their spiritual Jurisdic∣tion. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Case of the Regal.</HI> &amp; <HI>Pontif.</HI> p. 166.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>And what Sort of <HI>Discipline</HI> is exercised in these spiritual Courts in the Bishop's Name, but meerly <HI>civil</HI> Penalties? If the excommunicate Person does not satisfy the Court in forty Days, there comes out a Writ against him, which commits him to <HI>Prison,</HI> where he must lie, till he pays the Fees of the Court; and makes such Submission as is en∣join'd him. This he cannot escape, but by a good round Sum of Money, which commonly will answer the End And how agreeable this is to the Dis∣cipline Christ has appointed in his Church, the World must judge. But whether agreeable or not, every Minister of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> is ob∣liged to publish to his Congregation, the Sen∣tence
<PB N="15" REF="004237_0020_100428E0271AD958"/>
of Excommunication pronounced by these Laymen, tho' upon never so trivial Occasions. They must act by an implicit Faith; and submit to this, if never so contrary to their own Judg∣ments. Such is the boasted Government of your Episcopal Church.</P>
<P>And it is much the same Case, with Respect to the <HI>Admission</HI> of Ministers to their <HI>special Charge.</HI> The People are not only deprived of their natural Right of chusing their Minister; but the Bishop himself, it seems, cannot refuse the Clergym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n re∣commended by the <HI>Patron,</HI> how insufficient so∣ever for the Charge. And even this Right of Pa∣tronage is often bought and sold. It's common to buy the Right of the next Presentation to a Living, for any Expectant, who will have a le∣gal Claim to it, as soon as it becomes void. He will enjoy the Benefits of it, how unqualified so∣ever. The Bishop cannot prevent it. And there are some Ministers that have the Income of seve∣ral Parishes, which they never take any Pastoral Care of at all. It's enough if they commit the Work to such a <HI>Curate</HI> as they can hire cheapest, while they themselves live in Splendor upon the rich Revenues; and never so much as reside in their Parish.</P>
<P>Each Minister of the Church of <HI>England</HI> is ob∣liged to admit to the <HI>Lord's-Supper</HI> all Officers that hold Commissions in the State, be they ne∣ver so profane; or else he may incur great Dama∣ges, if sued for refusing such an one that holy Or∣dinance. Nor has he Power to keep the most no∣torious Sinners from the Sacrament above <HI>fourteen</HI> Days; unless he will be at the very great Charge of putting them into the spiritual Court.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Bishop</HI> himself, whom you suppose to be the Source of all Jurisdiction, he is meerly
<PB N="16" REF="004237_0021_100403DAE70B2DA0"/>
<HI>the King's Creature</HI>; and created by his Writ of <HI>Conge d'Es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire.</HI> All the pretended Election of the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter</HI> is but a Piece of Pageantry. And what else can we suppose their solemn Pray∣er to God for the Direction of the Holy Ghost, in the Choice of a fit Person for their Bishop, when there is one already appointed, which they dare do no other than accept, how disagreeable so∣ever to their Minds!</P>
<P>This is the State of the english Hierarchy, unto which every Minister of your Church is obliged to declare his <HI>unfeigned Assent and Consent.</HI> And unto which I shall be ready in like Manner to declare my Assent, when you can prove it agreeable either to Scripture or Reason. But in the mean Time you must pardon me, if I can neither envy or imitate your Change; nor believe this the best constituted Church in the World.</P>
<P>You have already heard my Exceptions against your <HI>Liturgy,</HI> with the long Train of Rites and Ceremonies, which you acknowledge to be of human Original, without any Scriptural Institu∣tion or Warrant; all of which must be complied with to a Punctilio, by every Conformist.</P>
<P>And what is worse than all the rest, is the <HI>In∣junction</HI> of all these Things, and their <HI>Imposition</HI> as Terms of Communion, without the least Al∣lowance for scrupulous Consciences. We must ap∣prove of all these Things, how unscriptural and unreasonable soever they appear to us; or be re∣fused the Fellowship of your Church, and be ex∣communicated Whosoever shall affirm, that the <HI>Form of Worship</HI> in your Church is corrupt super∣stitions or unlawful, or containeth any Thing in it that is contrary to the Scriptures, is <HI>excommuni∣cated</HI> by your <HI>fourth Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</HI> — Whosoever shall affi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, that any of your <HI>nine and thirty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI>

<P>I shall not spend Time to complain of the Injustice of this Representation; but consider it as respecting my Opposition to, and Objections a∣gainst the Imposition of your Rites and Ceremo∣nies; And in that View of the Case, I take this to be the Sum of your Reasoning. — We don't like all your Injunctions and Impositions; and must therefore be guilty of teaching for <HI>Doctrines the Commandments of Men</HI> We find Fault with some Things in your Church, which you say are not expresly forbid or declared to be sinful in the Scrip∣tures; and whoever do so, require as a religious Duty what God has not proposed or required; and are thereby guilty of the Charge in the debated Text. — But will this Reasoning hold good? What if those Things that are not in express Terms forbidden in the Scripture, should prove inconsistent with the general Rules of the Word of God; and if this should be the Case with re∣spect to the Subjects debated between you and me (as it may possibly appear to be, before we have done) Is our objecting against these Things, ne∣vertheless, <HI>teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men</HI>? If so, we have nothing to do, but to act by an implicit Faith, and to take Care not to con∣tradict any human Impositions, lest we <HI>teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men</HI>▪ And if so, your Church is in the highest Degree chargeable, in rejecting so many <HI>Popish</HI> Rites and Institutions, which are no where expresly forbidden in the Scriptures.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004237_0025_100428F28EA2C3E0"/>If you answer to this, that the Impositions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which you have rejected, are contrary to the general Rules in the Word of God; and those in your Church, which we re∣ject, are agreeable to the general Rules in the Word of God; and therefore we are chargeable with this Guilt, but you not: We have then <HI>your</HI> Word for it on one Side of the Question, that your Impositions are agreable to the Word of God, We have also the <HI>Papists</HI> Word for it on the other Side, that their Impositions are agreable to the Word of God; And we have the fullest Evidence in our own Minds, that they are neither one nor the other agreable to his Word How then must we understand this Argument of yours, so as to find out by it who are, and who are not guilty of this Charge? Are all they guilty, that reject such human Injunctions, as the <HI>Imposers</HI> them∣selves <HI>say</HI> are agreable to the Word of God? If so, the Church of <HI>England</HI> should well consider what they have been doing, in rejecting the <HI>Mass-Book.</HI> If not so, your Argument comes to No∣thing; for we have but your bare Word in Fa∣vour of your Impositions. — But perhaps you will tell us, that they are guilty, who reject <HI>such</HI> Impo∣sitions as are really <HI>in themselves</HI> agreable to the Word of God, without Respect to any Man's Word for or against them. But then, how must his appear? who must determine it? If the Im∣posers may determine the Case, we have the for∣mer Consequences brought upon us.

<P>But what can you mean, by our <HI>requiring</HI> a Re∣ection of those Impositions as a <HI>religious Duty</HI>; sav∣ing only, that we refuse to put our Necks into

the Yoke you have wreathed for us, and give our Reasons why we do so, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e we are content that those who are otherwise minded, should enjoy their own Opinion, and our Communion too in all sacred Ordinances? All we demand of them, is to give the same Liberty. We teach no Com∣mandments at all but the Commandments of God; and it is our known and received Principle, that we are to obey no Commandments but his, in Mat∣ters of Religion, of Conscience, and eternal Salva∣tion: While, you acknowledge, that the debated Rites and Ceremonies you impose, are meerly of human Original. So that the great Question be∣tween you and me is, Whether they are guilty of <HI>teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</HI> who teach that there are no Commandments in religi∣ous Affairs binding upon Men's Consciences, but the Commandments of God; or they who teach, that the Commandments of Men are also binding upon our Consciences: That is, in other Words, they who <HI>teach for Doctrines the Commandments of God,</HI> or they who <HI>teach for Doctrines the Command∣ments of Men</HI>?</P>

Inventions in God's Worship, they are all of them (sitting at the Lord's Supper only excepted) what both you and we agree in; and what are no where contested in any of the protestant Churches. And therefore if these Things had been enjoin'd as Terms of Communion, wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld there be no Difference between enjoining those Things which no Body scruples; and imposing such Things as are con∣scienciously scrupled, by much the greatest Part of the Reformation?</P>
<P>And lastly, there are none of your Instances (excepting that of sitting at the Lord's Supper, which I shall have Occasion hereafter to consider more distinctly) that come up to the Case deba∣ted between you and me. I opposed human Inven∣tions in the Worship of God: you instance in meer Circumstances and Append<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges of Worship, which I before allowed to be nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssarily left to human Prudence. There can be no Action without some necessary Circumstances; and where these are not provided for in Scripture, they are left absolutely indifferent to our own Choice. Thus for In∣stance, Christ has commanded us to attend the Lord's Supper; but has not directed whether it shall be observed at Noon or at Night, whether with leaven or unleavened Bread. It is therefore a necessary Circumstance, that there be some Time appointed, and some Sort of Bread provided, which must be left to human Prudence. So like∣wise, he hath required Ministers to preach; but has not told us whether standing or sitting, with Notes or without; and the Posture and Methods of Preparation are necessary Circumstances, that are left to our own P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udence, to be determined in each Society, agreeable to the general Rules, that <HI>all Things be done decently and in Order</HI> And the same may be said of the other Instances mention∣ed
<PB N="24" REF="004237_0029_100403F22F0B1358"/>
by you. These are all natural Circumstances, that necessarily belong to every religious Duty; and they must of Necessity be determin'd, or the Duty can't be attended. The Decision therefore of these Circumstances is required by the Law of Nature, which is the Law o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, since they are not decided by the written Word. — But by what Argument will it follow, that because ne∣cessary Circumstances and Appendages of Wor∣ship are left to human Appointment, that there∣fore unnecessary and scrupled Circumstances of Worship, may be appointed and imposed? Or that because meer Circumstances of Worship are left to human Direction, that therefore new Acts, Modes, or Forms of Worship may be invented and enjoin'd? And that all your unscriptural Hie∣rarchy, all your Methods of Discipline, all your Pluralities and Nonresidencies, all your Patronages and Sales of Advowsons or next Avoydances, and all your Rites and Ceremonies, must be approved as necessary to be comply'd with, for the Sake of the human Authority that enjoin them? I think, Sir, that there is a very great Difference in the Cases; and therefore that all you have said is no∣thing to the Purpose, unless you can prove, that we are as much bound to obey, with an implicit Faith, whatever unscriptural Institutions you are pleased to impose upon us, as to observe the Regu∣lation of those natural and necessary Circumstan∣ces, without which a religious Duty can't be per∣form'd at all.</P>

<P>You should first have proved (what we deny) that God has given a <HI>legislative Power</HI> to your Church, in the Affairs of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI>; or autho∣rized any Men upon Earth, to make Laws and In∣stitutions in Matters of his <HI>Worship,</HI> and in the Af∣fairs of Conscience and Salvation. Tho' we are bound to obey our lawful and rightful Rulers, in all those Things wherein God has given them Power to command us; yet we are not bound to obey all them that call themselves our Rulers, nor even our lawful Rulers themselves in those Things wherein God has not given them Power to com∣mand us. Be pleased therefore to shew us, whence this Authority is derived; and to whom it belongs: Whether to the Rulers of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and to the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> or to the Rulers of the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches, or to the Rulers of the <HI>reformed</HI> Church∣es abroad, of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or of the Churches of this <HI>Country,</HI> or to all of these: If to <HI>all</HI> of these, how can you justify the Reformation, in Disobedience to the Rulers in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>?

But I think, you will allow, that if this Authority is
<PB N="26" REF="004237_0031_100429008A693110"/>
given to the Rulers of <HI>any</HI> Church, it is given to the Rulers of <HI>every</HI> Church. This Claim must be every where equal And as the Authority of every Church is equal, so their Decrees must be equally binding by vertue of that Authority. The Decrees of the <HI>Council of Trent</HI> must be as Obligatory upon our Consciences, as the <HI>Canons</HI> of an <HI>english Convocation.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will it at all help the Case, to qualify this Assertion by limiting this imaginary Power to <HI>lawful Things.</HI> For who must be Judge in the Case, whether these Things are lawful, or not? If the <HI>Church of England</HI> may determine this Case, and we must stand to her Determination, her Power is ab∣solute, and we are under an Obligation to blind O∣bedience and absolute Subjection. And if your Church is Judge whether her Injunctions are law∣ful or not, the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is also Judge whe∣ther her Injunctions are Iawful or not: And those that live under her Government, are by the same Reason bound to obey in whatever she determine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lawful.</P>
<P>But you tell us, <HI>every Man must judge for himself whether the Ruler's Command be repugnant to God's, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not.</HI> Now do but stand by this Concession, and the Debate is ended. We then do judge for our selves, that all this pretended Power to command, in the Points under Debate, is contrary to God'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Command. We do judge for our selves, that Christ has given Power to no Man upon Earth, to make any such Injunctions, to ordain any such Impositions, or to vex our Consciences with any such Inventions of Men. We do judge for our selves, that Christ only is King in his Church; that here we have <HI>but one Lawgiver, who is able to save or destroy,</HI> Jam. iv.12. And so by your own Confession, we are under no Obligation to Obedience in the debated Points. — If you enquire, In
<PB N="27" REF="004237_0032_1004290906888BE0"/>
what then are we to <HI>obey them, who rule over us in the Lord</HI>? I answer, In their <HI>teaching us what∣soever Christ has commanded</HI>; and in Nothing else. It's Authority enough, to represent Christ's Person in explaining his Will to us; and we are bound to obey them when they can convince us, that what they teach is agreable to his Will; and no further.

<P>It seems, the Question between us is a very slippery Thing, that gets easily out of Hand, and indeed quite out of Sight. In my <HI>Sermon</HI> on this Text I endeavour'd to shew, that proposing and requiring as a religious Duty what God has not proposed as such nor required of us, the enjoining Terms of Communion which God has not enjoin∣ed, and the imposing any Terms of Communion by penal Sanctions, is <HI>teaching for Doctrines the Com∣mandments of Men</HI> In Opposition to which, you in your <HI>Vindication</HI> assert, <HI>That to teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, is no more nor less, than to teach that That is a divine Law or Ordinance, which is really but an human Appointment; When Men father

those Practices on God which have only an human O∣riginal. — That what our blessed Saviour means by teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, is to teach that human Customs are divine Laws.</HI> p. 5, 7.</P>
<P>In my <HI>Defence,</HI> I endeavour'd to vindicate my own Sense of this Text, and to refute yours. Your Sense of my Performance may be conjectur∣ed by this, that you are pleased not only wholy to overlook all my Arguments; but entirely to change the Question, and to put the Debate upon a new Foot.</P>
<P>How, I beseech you, came it the Matter for you to prove, that the Thing reproved by our Saviour was not barely enjoining that innocent Rite of washing Hands; when that which was before as∣serted by you, and should now be defended, was, that <HI>what our blessed Saviour meant, was their bely∣ing God, adding to his Law, and teaching that he has commanded what he has not commanded, or forbidden that which he has no where forbidden,</HI> p. 7 Have you now given up that Case? Do you acknow∣ledge, that you had put the Contro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersy upon a wrong Issue; and that your <HI>Vindication</HI> is indefen∣sible; that you have nothing to say in Proof of these Assertions, Nothing in Answer to my Argu∣ments against them?</P>
<P>Besides, you know that this is what I never op∣posed. It was not <HI>bare Injunctions</HI>; but Church Injunctions, religious Injunctions; and the making these Injunctions Terms of Communion▪ that I supposed to be condemned by our blessed Saviour, and to be <HI>teaching for Doctrines the Commandment; of Men.</HI> So that all your Pains is quite Cost; and all your Reasoning a meer trifling Impertinence.</P>
<P>You tell us▪ that the Thing reprov'd by our Saviour was the <HI>teaching, that this was a Thing necessary to avoid that Def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lement, that would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>der then

displeasing and unacceptable to God</HI> But what I pray is this to the Purpose? How does this justify your Vindication, that had taught so very different a Doctrine? Is it the same Thing to teach, that this is <HI>necessary</HI> as a Tradition of the Elders, <HI>to a∣void that Defilement that would render them displeasing to God</HI>; and to teach that this was a <HI>divine Command</HI>?</P>
<P>And how does this acquit the Church of <HI>England</HI> from the same Charge here laid against the Pha∣risees? Don't they also teach, that Conformity to their Institutions is <HI>necessary to avoid that Defile∣ment, that would render us displeasing and unaccepta∣ble to God</HI>? And don't you your self also teach us the same Thing? What mean these hideous Out∣cries of damning Schism, with which we are at∣tacked from every Quarter, for our Nonconformity to the Church's Institutions? Is there no Defile∣ment in Schism, that renders Men displeasing to God? How came we all to be excommunicated by your Canons? Will your Church excommunicate Men for such Things as have no Defilement in them, that renders them displeasing to God? Don't you your self represent us as guilty of <HI>Rebellion which is as the Sin of Witchcraft</HI>? And is there no Defile∣ment in Rebellion and Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chcraft, that renders Men displeasing to God?

<P>Well then, I hope we shall hear no more of these Things being indifferent, since you own that <HI>they cease to be indifferent to Subjects, when once they are determined by human Authority</HI> Are not all the contested Rites and Institutions of your Church, determined by human Authority? And therefore, whatever they were originally in their own Na∣ture, do they not by this Conclusion of yours cease to be indifferent now they are determined? I hope you won't pretend, that they are indifferent and not indifferent at the same Time. — I hope al∣so you will no longer pretend, that you place no Re∣ligion in these Things, since you tell us, <HI>when in such Cases we obey the Commands of our Rulers, we don't so properly obey them as God</HI> For all Religi∣on consists in Nothing else but Obedience to him.</P>
<P>And to apply this to the present Question. If these Things, being determined by human Autho∣rity, are become necessary to Subjects, is there no Defilement in the Neglect of necessary Duties, that will render us displeasing and unacceptable to God? If these Institutions are to be observed in Obedi∣ence to God, is there no Defilement in Disobedi∣ence to God, that will render us displeasing and unacceptable to him? Thus you see; that all your Pains upon this Subject might have been well spared, unless your Reasonings had been more to the Purpose.— It would be but a trifling Mis∣pence of Time, to take any Notice of your imper∣tinent evading the Point in Debate; and your artful changing the Question between us.</P>
<P>In a Word, turn which Way you will or can, this Charge will stick too close to be shaken off. Whatever Church enjoin their own Instructions in religious Affairs upon the Consciences of Men,

How can they be <HI>observed by Vertue of God's Law,</HI> if God's Law don't require it; or in other Words, if God don't command it? Whether this Command be direct or indirect, it's Nothing to the Purpose, as long as you require our Conformity to your own Inventions, as much as the Pharisees did, <HI>in Obe∣dience to God</HI>; and <HI>by Vertue of his Law</HI></P>
<P>If it be supposed, as you now assert, that the Pharisees Crime lay <HI>in teaching, that this was a Thing necessary to avoid that Defilement, which would render them unacceptable and displeasing to God</HI>; Don't you also teach the same Thing, when you tell us, that when once these Circumstantials are determin'd by human Authority, they cease to be indifferent to Subjects? That is, they become
<PB N="32" REF="004237_0037_100429176AAFEAE0"/>
necessary Duties. And I'm sure, it's a Defilement displeasing to God, to neglect necessary Duties; unless our Obedience be indifferent and necessary at the same Time.</P>
<P>If it be supposed, as you tell us in your <HI>Appeal</HI> p. 12. that the Pharisees enjoin'd their Observance of these Things, <HI>without any Regard to human Au∣thority imposing or requiring it</HI>: Yet you your self do in Effect teach the same Thing, when you tell us, that <HI>we don't so properly obey our Rulers in these Obser∣vances, as God.</HI> That is, that the required Obe∣dience is properly to be performed, not to our Rulers, but immediately to God: or in other Words, that we obey <HI>without Regard to human Authority</HI>; but properly with Regard to God's Authority, imposing or requiring our Obedience: The very Thing you condemn in the Pharisees. If this Imagination of yours, which you so strong∣ly assert without any Proof, or possibility of Proof, were therefore indeed the Case of the Pharisees▪ I don't see how it will help you. I can't under∣stand what Difference you can possibly make, be∣tween your Case and theirs; unless it be proved, that it's more innocent in it self to impose all your Rites, Ceremonies, and unscriptural Institutions upon the Consciences of Men, than for the Phari∣sees to enjoin the washing of Hands before Meat.</P>
<P>If you object against all this, that the Pharisees esteem'd it a <HI>moral Evil</HI> to omit the washing of Hands, before Meat; I would enquire, whether you esteem it a <HI>moral Evil,</HI> or not, to refuse Sub∣jection to the Imposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>? If so, if it be <HI>Rebellion which is as the Sin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Witchcraft,</HI> if it be Disobedience to God, to refuse Subjection to these Things: The Sentence is yet passed from your own Mouth; and by your De∣cree the Case is the same.

<P>Does <HI>Christ never condemn the Use of innocent and indifferent Rites, when they are not taught as divine Ordinances</HI>? Yes, Sir, Christ ever condemns the Use of any Rites (how indifferent soever) being imposed upon Men's Consciences, and made the Matter of religious Worship.

<P>It's true, our blessed Saviour did require his Disciples to hearken to the Scribes and Pharisees Doctrine: but this must be understood to imply such Doctrine only, as was agreeable to the Word of God.

<P>Here again you have entirely changed the Question between us; and have therefore spent a great deal of Pains to no Purpose. The Question in Debate is, Whether any Authority in the Church may impose any human Institutions in God's Wor∣ship, and in religious Affairs, upon the Conscien∣ces of Men; and whether we are under any Obli∣gation to obey such Institutions, how innocent and indifferent soever they may be in themselves, ab∣stracted from the Consideration of their religious Use, and human Original? This is the State of the Case between us, as it was particularly consi∣dered in the Sermon you oppose▪ And the Affir∣mative it▪ this Question is what you ought now to have proved, if you would say any Thing to the Purpose: But it seems, you thought you could harangue more plausibly upon another Subject. And therefore rather chose to lose Subject in Debate, than to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Opportunity of Insult and Triumph. But let us consider the Case in a pro∣per Light; and see whether any of these monstrous Consequences that you speak of, will necessarily follow from my Position.</P>
<P>You must remember, that the Extent of our Obedience either to natural or civil Rulers▪ in Af∣fairs that are under their Cognizance, is quite out of the Question; and therefore all the fine Flourish∣es in your <HI>Appeal,</HI> serve for no other Purpose, but to set off the Promptness of your fruitful In∣vention. And as to ecclesiastical Rulers, 'twould not have been improper for you to have laid the
<PB N="38" REF="004237_0043_10042929355AA548"/>
Foundation of your Insults, upon some Pretence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Proof, that there is such Authority by Heaven com∣mitted to them, as I am impleading. For, as Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> observes, "Man cannot be obliged by Man, but to what either <HI>formally</HI> or <HI>virtually</HI> he is obliged by God; for, all just Power is from God.</P>
<P>You charge it as my Position, that we must not submit to the most innocent and indifferent Rite when enjoin'd by lawful Authority; and if you had added, when the lawful Authority enjoin such Rite as a Part of the Worship of God, make it a re∣ligious Duty, or impose it upon Men's Consciences, I own it to be my Position. For in such Case, the lawful Authority go beyond their Power; and invade the Prerogative of the great Head and King of the Church. Their Injunctions are not there∣fore to be submitted to, out of any Regard to their Authority imposing them upon us. I have said something to this already, that will (I think) help to illustrate and confirm this Position. Let us now see what Work it will make, to invert this Propo∣sition; and assert the contrary for Truth.</P>
<P>If you contradict what I delivered in my Sermon, and have endeavoured to defend, you must assert, That i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s always our Duty to submit to those Rites and Institutions, that are originally and of them∣selves innocent and indifferent, when they are made religious Duties, brought into the Worship of God, made Terms of Communion, and impos∣ed upon our Consciences, by the lawful Authority in the Church. Is this Doctrine true, or is it not? I think you must acknowledge, that it's either true or false. If false, all human Institutions in the Affairs of Religion, all Church-Impositions, all Terms of Communion which Christ has not appointed▪ m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st fall to the Ground; and the De∣bate
<PB N="39" REF="004237_0044_100429320E0DCF10"/>
between you &amp; me is decided against you For how innocent and indifferent soever origina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly and in themselves, all your Hierarchy, all the Constitu∣tions and Institutions of your Church, and all your Rites and Ceremonies of human Invention, may be imagined; yet their being made religious Du∣ties, their being brought into the Worship of God, and imposed upon our Consciences, expose them as much as any others, to be rejected, if we are not always under Bonds of Obedience to the Au∣thority that impose such Things upon us. I must therefore necessarily suppose, that you hold this Doctrine for true. Your Cause requires that you should, and bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h your Books are a meer impertinent Evasion, if you do not hold it for Truth. Let us then consider the Consequences, and see which Position affords those that are most monstrous, yours or mine.</P>
<P>The wetting our Fingers in Water, is certainly in it self an innocent Action: How then came the Church of <HI>England</HI> to scruple and leave off the Use of <HI>Holy Water,</HI> when they entred the Church, since it was required by the lawful Authority of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>? And since Unction is a harm∣less Action, how comes it about that the Church of <HI>England</HI> while it retains the Cross in Baptism, has thrown out <HI>Chrism</HI>? The making the Sign of the <HI>Cross,</HI> you must acknowledge in it self an innocent Action: Why then don't you, as formerly, cros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your selves upon <HI>all Occasions,</HI> in Conversation as well as in Worship, and in one Part of Worship as well as in another? The <HI>bowing</HI> the <HI>Head,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Knee,</HI> is in it self an innocent indifferent Rite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> What Reason can there be to scruple doing this before the <HI>Image</HI> of a Saint, and before a <HI>Crucifix,</HI> any more than toward the <HI>Altar</HI>? Thus yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> see how quick this Doctrine will lead us to
<PB N="40" REF="004237_0045_1004293393D19008"/>
<HI>Rome.</HI> For you know that all these Things, and multitudes more of the like Nature, are required by the lawful Authority in that Church. And I am afraid that this Doctrine will even carry us further than <HI>Rome,</HI> if we receive it in all it's ne∣cessary Consequences. What can be in it self more innocent, than throwing a little <HI>Frankincense</HI> into the <HI>Fire</HI>? What then ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d the Croud of <HI>Martyn</HI> in the heathen Persecutions, to sacrifice their Lives to their own Obstinacy, rather than burn a little of this fragrant Gum in an <HI>Idol's Temple,</HI> when commanded by the supreme Authority in the State, and high Priest in that Pagan Church; and even when they were allowed to reserve the in∣ward Thought and View to themselves? And it's more than an innocent Thing, to eat Victuals when hungry: What hurt then canit be to eat well dressed Food, when one is hungry, in an <HI>Idol's Tem∣ple,</HI> if it be required by lawful Authority? And yet the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was so scrupulous, as to for∣bid it; and to call it a <HI>partaking of the Table of De∣vils,</HI> 1. Cor. x.21 — What say you to these Things? Do you scruple any of them? Won't you obey the Authority that requires these innocent and in∣different Rites! Why, <HI>there's no Room at all for your Submission to Authority, if you won't allow them to interpose in such Things as are indifferent and inno∣cent,</HI> as all these Things are originally and in themselves.</P>
<P>But perhaps you would further limit this Rule of our Obedience; and tell us, that we are only to submit to those Rites and Institutions, that are in all their Circumstances▪ after their Imposition, in∣nocent and indifferent. But then you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our self have assured us, that there can be no such Case; and that the Imposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion it self takes away their Indifferency▪ You have taught us, that <HI>when once these Circum∣stantials
<PB N="41" REF="004237_0046_100429368AD45E90" MS="y"/>
are determined by human Authority, they cease to be indifferent to Subjects</HI>; that is, they become necessary Duties. And therefore you must by this Rule, be bound to observe all these Things I have newly mention'd; or at least they must all be thus bound, that live under Popish and Pagan Government.</P>
<P>Besides, for you to say, that the Things in De∣bate between you and me are innocent and indif∣ferent after they are imposed, would be a bare-faced begging the Question. The very Thing you opposed, and what you ought to have dis∣prov'd, was, that there are no human Institutions in religious Worship, no Impositions upon Men's Consciences, innocent and indifferent after their Imposition, how innocent and indifferent soever originally and of themselves. This was what I en∣deavoured to prove; and it was your Business to have answered my Arguments: but this you have ne∣ver attempted. It does not therefore make a very good Appearance, for you now to take this for granted, without any Proof.</P>
<P>But if you were allowed this Limitation, it won't at all help your Cause. For who must be Judges, whether these religious Injunctions are innocent and indifferent, in all their Circumstances, after they are imposed? Must the Imposers judge? If so, they'll be sure to judge in their own Favour. The Papists themselves will never plead Guilty. They'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l determine, that all their Institutions are innocent and indifferent; and they that live under their Government must notwithstanding this Li∣mitation, submit to them all. But if we must judge for ourselves, there are none of 'em inno∣cent and indifferent when once they are imposed; and so we are not bound to Obedience to any of 'em, to one religious Injunction more than ano∣ther.

"the mon∣strous Consequences that necessarily follow your Position."</P>

<P><HI>Your Gloss upon this Text is one of the wildest and most extravagant Fancies that ever was published in the World; That an innocent and lawful Thing be∣comes unlawful, when once it's commanded by lawful Authority; when it's so far from that, that then it becomes a Duty.</HI> (p. 17.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then it ceases to be indifferent as soon as it is commanded; for it is not indifferent whether Duty be perform'd or not. If it by this Means becomes a Duty, then there must be no Limitation to our Obedience in this Case. All Things that are indifferent in themselves, lose their Indifferency as soon as commanded. They become a Duty; and must be observed as soon as requir∣ed and enjoin'd by the lawful Authority in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> or any where else, as well as when enjoin'd by the lawful Authority of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> But how does this become a Duty? Is it by Virtue of the Authority that com∣mands it? If so, it is the Duty of all under the papal Government, to obey all their Injunctions before considered For they are all innocent and indifferent in themselves; are all commanded; and they have determin'd of 'em all, that they are in∣nocent after their Injunction. I hope you won't pretend to that Authority in your Church, that you will allow no where else. If you pretend to found this Duty of Obedience upon God's Autho∣rity, that requires Subjection to Rulers, this al∣so brings all the same Consequences upon you. For this Doctrine is just as true at the <HI>Vatican,</HI> as at <HI>Lam∣beth</HI>; and you are as much bound to obey Autho∣rity
<PB N="43" REF="004237_0048_10042940FABA3DA0"/>
at <HI>Rome,</HI> as in <HI>England</HI>; as I have observ'd before.</P>
<P>To sum up all in a Word: We must allow Submission to all religious Injunctions and Imposi∣tions upon Men's Consciences of human Invention, which the Imposers are pleased to call innocent and indifferent; or we must deny a Submission to all such Injunctions. They are all of 'em a Du∣ty, or none of 'em a Duty. There is no possible Medium. Distinguish here, if you can; and set such Limitations to this Duty of ecclesiastical Obe∣dience, in the Affairs of Religion and Conscience, as won't either exempt us from any Obligation to Conformity to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or else oblige all that live in Popish Countries, to a Conformity to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often have I told you, though I acknowledge there is the greatest Difference in the Nature of the Things imposed, in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that I could yet see no Difference at all in the Authori∣ty to impose them. But since you still insist up∣on this Point, let us consider the Case a little distinctly.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath (without any Scrip∣ture Pattern or Precept) appointed an <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> consisting of <HI>Arch-Bishops, Arch-Deacons, Prebenda∣ries, Rectors, Curates</HI> &amp;c. which are also to be found in your Church. The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath also ap∣pointed a Number of <HI>Cardinals, Abbots, Monks,</HI> and in a
<PB N="44" REF="004237_0049_100429441F8CBC88"/>
Word a variety of Orders, both regular and secular, which your Church hath rejected. Now I would enquire, what Authority that Church hath to ap∣point the former of these Orders, which she hath not to appoint the latter, since both are human Institutions, without any Foundation in Scripture. The Church of <HI>England</HI> have set up spiritual Courts, consisting of Laymen, such as <HI>Chancellors, Commis∣saries, Proctors, Apparators,</HI> &amp;c. with Power to inflict pecuniary and corporal Punishments, upon the Transgressors of their ecclesiastical Laws. The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> have set up an Inquisition, to inflict corporal Punishment in like Cases. I again enquire▪ what Authority the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> hath, for the one of these Courts, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hath not for the other? The Church of <HI>England</HI> have a <HI>Prayer Book</HI> of human Invention, which they impose upon their People, as the Medium of Devotion, and a Term of Com∣munion. The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> also hath a <HI>Prayer-Book</HI> of human Invention, which they likewise im∣pose in the same Manner. And I entreat you to tell me, what Authority you have to impose your Liturgy, which they have not to impose their<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ The Church of <HI>England</HI> use the Sign of the <HI>Cross</HI> at Baptism: The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> use it in vari∣ous other Cases. And have not they the same Au∣thority for their Use of the Sign of the <HI>Cross,</HI> as you have for yours? The Church of <HI>England</HI> have a Book of <HI>Canons,</HI> by which you excommu∣nicate all Dissenters: The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> have Books of <HI>Canons</HI> or <HI>Decretals,</HI> by which they ex∣communicate all Hereticks. And han't they the same Authority that you have, to excommunicate all that reject their unscriptural Institutions? I might mention a great many other Instances of the same Kind, to exemplify the Case. But do
<PB N="45" REF="004237_0050_1004293CA37C3A80" MS="y"/>
you your self think of what Instance you please; and the same Consequences will follow. I am at an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter Loss what Answer you can give to this, if you will undertake to answer to the Purpose. If you tell me, that the popish Impositions are in themselves sinful; and are therefore to be reject∣ed: I allow it to be true. But what Answer will you give to such an Exception against your Im∣positions, if it should happen to be made? What Answer can you give to the Objection that is constantly made, that all these Impositions upon Men's Consciences are always in themselves sinful; that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> mayn't likewise make in Vindication of theirs? You esteem yours agreea∣ble to the Scripture, and they esteem theirs so. And whoever conscienciously scruples either the one or the other, are of a contrary Opinion. There can be therefore no dernier Resort in this Case, no Decision, but <HI>Church-Authority,</HI> which I think must be acknowledged equal both in <HI>Rome</HI> and in <HI>England,</HI> which was the Thing to be proved.— In a Word, there can be no Reason given for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> monopolizing this Church-Authority to your selves. And therefore you must approve of it in <HI>Rome,</HI> as well as in <HI>England</HI>; or acknowledge that both are obli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to leave those Things indiffe∣rent, which Christ has left so.

If they leave every Thing indifferent, which Christ has left indifferent, there will be the same Care taken about the Worship of God, which our bles∣sed Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imself has taken; and is not that sufficient Care o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Worship of God?

Why will you oblige me to pull off my Hat at the Lord's Table, when Christ allows us a friendly Familiarity with him at his Table, and never commanded Men to put off their Hats?

our Actions; and upon which they depend Now it can be no Imposition upon Men's Consciences, no Infringement of their Freedom and Liberty, to perform the Duties, which God has required of us, some Way or other; nor to determine which of those necessary Circumstances are most agreeable to the Solemnity of the Duty, or the State of our Churches. Thus much we are obliged to, by the Precept which enjoins the Duty upon us; and by the very Law of Nature, which is the Law of God. And whatever, more than this, you can find enjoin'd in our Churches, I freely give up to you. For I acknowledge that Impositions are at least as bad among us, as among you.</P>
<P>These Things being premised, let your Instances be considered You demand why I oblige you to receive the Sacrament at Noon, in leaven'd Bread, at the Hands of a Layman? To which I answer as before, that Christ has required us to observe this Ordinance; but has not determin'd whether at Noon or at Night, whether in leaven'd or unleaven'd Bread, whether it shall be handed about, after Consecration, by the Minister or some other. And it's absolutely necessary, that in each of these Cases it be done some Way or other; and here <HI>Wis∣dom is profitable to direct.</HI> But if you scruple this Method of partaking of the Ordinance; and can find a sufficient Number to join with you, I will administer it to you at Evening, in unleaven'd Bread; and carry about the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ements with my own Hands after the Consecration, rather than wound your Conscience. And what can you de∣sire more?</P>
<P>But you demand again, <HI>Why will you impose upon me a Prayer of your own Inv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> &amp;c?

Duty according to my own Conscience. And is this imposing upon you? Then you are imposed upon by every one that don't think as you think, and practice as you practice. Besides, this is agreeable to your own Practice, in making a Prayer of your own before Sermon, <HI>allowed</HI> (you tell us) by your <HI>Canons.</HI> (p 41.) Whether you are allowed this Liberty, I shall not divert at present to dispute (consult you famous <HI>Bennet's</HI> Treatise <HI>of the Ioynt Use of Prayer,</HI> who is fully in the Negative) but supposing it, I argue, How th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are you imposed upon by <HI>our</HI> performing that Du∣ty agreeable to <HI>your own Opinion and Practice</HI>; un∣less we will also perform it in all the Method<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that you are pleased to invent and require? — But you say, <HI>a well invented Form is to you much better, and more edifying.</HI> You are then welcome to use such a Form, and act according to your own Per∣suasion; and may yet be treated by us as Brethren in all Respects.

<P>What you mean by a particular Covenant to continue with our own Churches, I don't know: and can consider it only as some News you are pleased to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e me. And I have only this Remark to make upon it, that if it be News concerning any Thing that I am acquainted with, I must suppose it to refer to the late Minister at <HI>New Town,</HI> before he was enlightned and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought into the

Have they not loudly condemned such a Practice, compar'd it to <HI>Adultery</HI>: and pronounc'd it as <HI>con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trary to all Principles of Church-Communion, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thing possibly can be</HI>? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These are the Words of Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> in his Resolution of that Case, <HI>Whether it be law∣ful to communicate with two distinct and separate Churches</HI>▪</NOTE> I doubt, very few of your Brethren will stand by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Concession yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have made.</P>
<P>But I would enquire, <HI>Upon what Terms</HI> Presbyte∣rians, Independants, Baptists, Lutherans, and Cal∣vinists are allowed to come to your Communion? Can they have their Children baptized in your Church, without the scrupled Institutions of Sure∣ties and the Sign of the Cross? Can they be ad∣mitted to the Lord's Table, and be allowed the Posture that their Consciences tell them it's their Duty to use? Can they be abated one Ragg o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Ceremony, for the Sake of their Consciences, or for the Peace of the Church? Or may any of these be allowed to be Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> without a compleat Conformity to

<P>Thus I have (I think) said enough to clear the Point in Debate; and given a sufficient An∣swer to all that you have said in your <HI>Appeal,</HI> tho' I have not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rticularly considered some Things there offered, which do not so immediately affect the present Controversy. And I am now ready to attend upon what you have further to offer; and shall only premise, that if we are bound to Obe∣dience to these religious Injunctions, by Vertue of the supreme <HI>Civil</HI> Authority's enjoining or establish∣ing them, you would do well to clear it up to us, what Establishment we are here in this Country boun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to submit to.

of God; and whether there be no <HI>Will-Worship</HI> among you, in the Apostles Sense of <HI>Will-Worship,</HI> in that second Chapter to the <HI>Colossians.</HI></P>
<P>I before observ'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou in my <HI>Defence,</HI> that the imposing of <HI>Meats, Drinks, and holy Days</HI> were instanced in the 16th Verse of that Chapter; <HI>Vo∣luntary Humility</HI> in the 18th; <HI>The Rudiments of the World and human Ordinances</HI> in the 20th; forbid∣ding <HI>to touch, taste, or handle,</HI> in the 21st; all <HI>the Commandments of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> in the 22d Verse; as be∣ing <HI>a Shew of Wisdom in Will-Worship,</HI> Verse 23. But it seems this touched you too nearly, to admit an Answer; and you have taken the safest Course, not to say a Word about it. But pray, Sir, allow me to consider the Case. Have you no <HI>holy Days</HI> of human Appointment in your Church? Have you no <HI>voluntary Humility,</HI> for Instance, in your making Kneeling at the Lord's Supper a necessary Term of Communion, which Christ never appoint∣ed; but gave us a contrary Example, when he himself instituted and celebrated that holy Ordi∣nance? Have you no <HI>human Ordinances</HI>? Don't you your self acknowledge, that all your Rites and Ceremonies are meerly of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man Original? Don't your Church forbid to <HI>touch taste or handle,</HI> when the appoints ninety five Days o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fasting or Absti∣nence every Year? Have you no <HI>Commandments of Men,</HI> when your Canons enjoin upon us the Ob∣servation of all these Things, upon Pain of Ex∣communication? I can't imagine how these Things were <HI>Will-Worship</HI> among the <HI>Colossians</HI>; and not <HI>Will-Worship</HI> among you. Pray, Sir, be pleased to shew us any Difference between their Case and yours, if you possibly can. Shew us how the Nature of these Things came to be changed, when imposed by you, from what it was when they were imposed upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="004237_0059_10042963538880E8"/>But it seems we are the Persons chargeable with <HI>Will Worship,</HI> because we say <HI>Touch not, taste not, handle not</HI>; when we refuse Subjection to your In∣stitutions. I think what is said above makes it e∣vident, that your Impositions are according to the Determination of the Apostle in the Text under Consideration, all of them <HI>Will-Worship.</HI> And if your Arguings be just, it is a just Conclusion, that it's <HI>Will-Worship</HI> to refuse <HI>Will-Worship.</HI> But be∣fore this Conclusion be taken for granted, you should prove one of these three Things; either that <HI>Will-Worship</HI> is lawful in your Church; or that what was <HI>Will-Worship</HI> among the <HI>Colossians,</HI> is not so among you; or else that the Imposition <HI>Will-Worship</HI> by ecclesiastical Rulers takes a∣way the Evil of it; and makes it a Duty.

<P>I have already shewn, that it consisted al∣so in all Sorts of human Inventions and Impositi∣ons in the Affairs of Religion and Conscience. But suppose yours to be a full Account of the Mat∣ter, how (I pray you) is it manifestly our Case? I cannot take your Word for it, that God has no where forbidden a Subjection to such Institutions and Impositions as yours are. God has required us to <HI>stand fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free; and not to be entangled again in a Yoke of Bondage,</HI> Gal v.1. <HI>Not to be brought under the Power of any, even in Things in themselves lawful,</HI> 1 Cor. vi 12.
<PB N="55" REF="004237_0060_1004296A1CFBC8D8" MS="y"/>
<HI>Not to give Place by Subjection, no not for an Hour, to those that would spy out our Liberty, and bring us into Bondage,</HI> Gal. ii.4, 5. He has re∣quired us to acknowledge <HI>no Master but Christ,</HI> Matth. xxiii.8. as I have shewed you before. So that whatever Charges you are pleased to lay against us, we are acquitted by a higher Judge.</P>
<P>But suppose we are <HI>weak Brethren,</HI> in these de∣bated Points, and make wrong Inferences from Scripture and the Nature of Things; This I must acknowledge possible; for we are but fallible Men: How should we then be treated by you, if this be the Case; or which is all one, if you imagine this to be the Case? The Apostle answers this Question particularly. <HI>Take heed</HI> (says he) <HI>left by any Means, this Liberty of yours prove a Stumbling-Block to them that are weak. Through thy Know∣ledge shall thy weak Brother Perish, for whom Christ dyed? When ye so sin against the Brethren and wound their weak Consciences, ye sin against Christ,</HI> 1 Cor. viii.9, 11, 12. <HI>Him that is weak in the Faith, re∣ceive you; but not to doubtful Disputations. Who are thou that judgest another Man's Servant, to his own Master he standeth or falleth. For Meats destroy not the Work of God. All Things indeed are pure; but it's Evil for that Man who eateth with Offence.</HI> Rom. xiv.1, 4, 20.</P>
<P>Nay let us further suppose, that we are in a <HI>Mistake</HI> in our consciencious Scruples of those Things, that are in themselves innocent and indiffe∣rent, &amp; no where forbidden in Scripture: Yet This is a Mistake which we sincerely profess we cannot help. And will Christ reject us or our Services, for such a Mistake? No, we may expect more Mercy from him in this Case, than we can find from you. It's certain, they who scrupled eating of Meat in the Apostles Times, were causelesly
<PB N="56" REF="004237_0061_10040402E077E7A8"/>
scrupulous, by the Apostles own Decision of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Case. And yet of such an one the Apostle tel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> us, <HI>God hath received him.

Whose De∣cree must stand in this Cause, God's or your's?</P>
<P>To sum up all in a Word. The great Design of the Christian Institution is, to bring us to Cha∣rity, Kindness, Compassion, and Benevolence to∣wards one another, as well as to Devotion towards God, and Dependance upon him. These Things are accordingly insisted upon by the Author of our Religion, they are repeatedly inculcated and en∣forced by the most solemn Motives, as being abso∣lutely necessary to our standing before our Judge in Peace, in the Day of his Appearing and King∣dom. Whence it necessarily follows, that all those Impositions upon Men's Consciences, which tend to embitter their Minds one against another, to ensnare them to profess or practise contrary to their Opinion, to cut them off from the Pleasures or Advantages of Society, to injure their Estates, hurt their Reputations, or render their Lives painful or uneasy, must be repugnant to our holy Religion, (which consists in <HI>Love Ioy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, and Temperance,</HI> Gal. v.22▪ 23) whatever Preten∣ces, and whatever Apologies may be made for these Things. And since these are the necessary Consequences of the Imposition of your unscrip∣tural <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> with all your Rites and Ceremo∣nies
<PB N="57" REF="004237_0062_1004296E6A898AA8" MS="y"/>
of human Invention, of your spiritual Courts; and your Excommunication of all that differ from you in these Things. I shall conclude with Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI>

"The subordinate Officers in our Courts do at present, as all the World see, but <HI>ill</HI> manage the Power of the Church, <HI>convert∣ing it chiefly to their own Advantage, with little or no Regard to the Ends of Religion</HI>; insomuch that the <HI>Strict∣ness</HI> of Discipline is <HI>wholly abated</HI>; the <HI>Exercise</HI> of that which is, is <HI>corrupted</HI>; the Proceeding against Offenders <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>dilatory</HI>; and if any <HI>Penances</HI> are en∣join'd, 'tis with almost <HI>no Respect</HI> to true <HI>Repentance,</HI> nor is much Consideration of <HI>that</HI> had in <HI>Relaxation</HI> of Censures.

Commandments,</HI> I know not what is. And there∣fore these superstitious Christians might be said to <HI>wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ship God in vain,</HI> as well as the Scribes and Pharisees. And yet great Variety of <HI>Superstiti∣ous</HI> of this kind, were then already spread over the Church, being different in divers Places. — These are the Things of which he (S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>· <HI>Austin</HI>) presently says after, <HI>The Church of God placed between Chaff and Tares, tolerates many Things.</HI> Which was directly against the Com∣mand of the Holy Spirit, given by <HI>St.</HI> Paul, <HI>To stand fast in that Liberty wherewith Christ hath made her free, and not to suffer her self to be brought in Bondage to these Servile Burdens.</HI></Q></P>

<P>I have offered a Variety of Arguments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my <HI>Defence,</HI> by which I endeavoured particular<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and largly to prove, that the Imposition of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Prayer Book</HI> in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> is <HI>teaching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Doctrines the Commandments of Men</HI> But you have tho'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (it seems) that the easiest and safest Way of answering that Book, is to take no Notice of the Arguments there advanced. I shall therefore r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fer my Reader thither for Satisfaction; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> briefly remark a few Things upon what is now of∣fered. And</P>
<P N="1">1. The lawfulness of using Forms of Prayer comes not into the present Question. For (as I had observ'd in the Sermon you are pleased to op∣pose) it is not the Question, whether any Forms of Prayer are lawful, this is on all Hands acknow∣ledged Forms may be very useful to such igno∣rant Persons, as know not how to Pray without them; And we make no Doubt but those of your Opinion may be accepted of God, in a serious and devout Performance of the Duty of Prayer by a Form. Let such therefore have the full Liberty of following their own Inclinations and devout Af∣fections, that either thro' Ignorance want, or that by the Prejudice of Education or any other Means have the best Opinion of, these (either real or
<PB N="63" REF="004237_0068_100404098F6EFD20" MS="y"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aginary) Helps to Devotion. But then, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould not have those Things imposed upon us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at don't want them, nor find them Helps to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evotion. We would not by them be deprived of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mproving the Gift of Prayer which God has given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; nor be forced to use Crutches, when we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he free Use of our Limbs. This you know to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Case; and therefore all the path<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tick Excla∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations, all the vehement Expostulations in your <HI>Appeal,</HI> about condemning all the Christians in the World, are altogether impertinent, and unworthy of particular Notice.</P>
<P>The Question between you and me is, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he imposing any Forms of Prayer upon the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciences of Men, in the stated and constant Wor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip of God; and making them necessary Terms of Communion; and whether the imposing your Prayer-Book in particular in that Manner, <HI>be not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men</HI>? This being the Case in Debate. I shall Endeavour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o prove</P>
<P N="2">2. That such Impositions of any Forms of hu∣man Invention, in the stated and constant publick Worship of God; and that such Imposition of the Common Prayer Book, <HI>is teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</HI> And then shall take some Notice of your Objections.</P>
<P>I had before observ'd to you, that the Impositi∣on of these Forms was either by the <HI>Command∣ment of God,</HI> or <HI>the Commandment of Men.</HI> If the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormer, shew us the Precept by which God has commanded it; and we submit. If the latter, the Case is determined, and there needs no Dispute. It concerns you Sir, to answer this Argument one Way or the other; and not to evade it. Here are Forms of Prayer imposed by your Church. They are taught for Doctrines in your Church,
<PB N="64" REF="004237_0069_100429849E258780"/>
in the same Sense that the washing of Hands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the Pharisees, in the debated Text; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Doctrines are the <HI>Commandments of God,</HI> or the <HI>Commandments of Men.</HI> Now speak plainly, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are they? If you will answer directly, I am much mistaken if you don't contradict all you have sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in both your Books. If you assume the former of these; and tell us, this is required by he <HI>Com∣mands of God,</HI> you at once destroy all your copi∣ous Reasons upon the indifferency of these Things; and upon your placing no Religion in them, which is the Foundation of your whole Structure. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you assume the latter; and allow, that these are the <HI>Commandments of Men,</HI> you give us the Question, you <HI>teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</HI> I know no Way of a direct Answer to this Argu∣ment, but to allow one of these two Things with their Consequences to be true; or to prove that these Forms are enjoin'd, neither by the <HI>Commands of God</HI> or <HI>Man,</HI> which is the height of Absurdi∣ty.</P>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, were this supposed, what follows from it? Can't you be chargeable with a Fault, I pray, because your Neighbour is guilty of the same? If the Accusation be never so just, still the Argu∣ment retains it's Force; and the Answer is but an Evasion, that would be as pertinently urged in Favour of the <HI>Mass Book,</HI> as of your <HI>Prayer Book.</HI> A <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> could with the same Propriety, answer any Argument against their <HI>Mass Book</HI> in the same Manner. And if this Retortion be true in your Mouth, it would be true in theirs. If it
<PB N="65" REF="004237_0070_1004298625933788" MS="y"/>
defend the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book,</HI> it would with equal Force defend their whole Liturgy, were it ten Times so bad as it is. So that notwithstand∣ing all you have said or can say, the Argument retains its full Force; and <HI>Mark</HI> vii.7. does con∣demn this Part of your Impositions.</P>
<P>But let us consider the Case a little; and see whether this Answer ben't as unjust, as it is im∣pertinent. — You your self will allow, that we are commanded to pray in the publick Worship of God, to <HI>pray with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit</HI>: that we are particularly directed as to the Manner of performing this Duty. And you must allow, that there is no Precept, no Warrant, no Example in the whole Bible, for Forms of Pray∣er, of meerly human Composure, to be used, much less to be imposed, in the publick Worship of God. Whence I argue, that the Command to pray, does either require us to pray with or without imposed Forms of human Composure; or else leaves it to our Choice, to do in that Case, as we think best. If with such Forms, shew me either Precept or Example in the whole Bible to warrant it; and I submit. But if no such Thing can be found, it must be without such Forms: or else it must be left to our own Choice, to act in that Affair as we think best. If you assume the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of these, I enquire; whose Choice is this left? Who are to act in it as they think best, the Imposers or the Body of the People? If the former, then we are bound to the Use of the <HI>Mass-Book</HI> in popish Coun∣tries, as well as to the <HI>Prayer-Book</HI> in <HI>England</HI>▪ And every Liturg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the World▪ let it be never so corrupt and never so idolatrous, must be com∣ply'd with. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the People are to chuse, then every Body has full Liberty in this Case by divine Appointment; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ought to be left at full Liberty,
<PB N="66" REF="004237_0071_100429897335E4D0"/>
without any Church-Censure, without any Inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>venience to his religious or civil Rights, with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> any unkind Treatment; or any Injury to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or sacred Communion, to his Honours, Reput<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on, or any other valuable Interests whatsoever Which is the Thing I contend for. I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> falls nothing short of mathematical Demonstra∣tion, that the Scripture by enjoining the Duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prayer in the publick Worship of God, does r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣quire us either to pray without a Form of hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Composure, or leave it to every one's Liberty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> act in that Affair as we think best. It cannot sub∣ject us to all the Caprices, Irreligion, or Idolatry of every Person or Society, that will compose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us, or impose upon us, what Forms they please.</P>
<P>Now take which Side of the Question you please; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd it equally makes against you. If the Scrip∣ture requires us to pray without Forms of human Composure, the Case is decided, there's no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be said. If the Scripture leaves this Matter to every one's Choice, to act as he thinks best, Why do you contradict the Scripture-Institution? Why don't you leave it as the Scripture has left it? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is in vain for you to pretend, that <HI>it is just so i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Church as I say it should be,</HI> as long as your Church-Canons stand in Force and excommunicate us all upon this Account; and so long as we are deny'd all Membership in your Church; and those of our Profession in <HI>England</HI> all Privileges in the State, for our scrupling those Impositions.</P>
<P>But that this Affair may be yet set in a clearer Light, let us consider in what Manner we are directed to perform the Duty of Prayer in Scripture; and see whether these Directions are compatible with im∣posed Forms of human Composure.</P>
<P>We are directed, Eph. vi.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. to <HI>pray with all Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit.</HI> Now will your
<PB N="67" REF="004237_0072_1004299109053058" MS="y"/>
<HI>Prayer-Book,</HI> or can any Form whatsoever, supply us with Matter of Prayer for the various Exigen∣ces, Occasions and Circumstances of Life, which we are called to? It's plain, they cannot; and therefore it's to be presumed they were not designed to be the Methods of performing this Duty; which ought to be accommodated to all the Circumstan∣ces of a holy Providence towards us. To exem∣plify this: we have lately had terrible Displays of the divine Displeasure, by fearful Sights in the Heavens, accompany'd with a terrible <HI>Earthquake</HI>: and our People are generally stupid, and incon∣siderate of these Prognosticks of our Lord's Ap∣pearing. How shall we <HI>humble ourselves under the mighty Hand of God</HI>? How shall we give him the Glory of our Preservation? How shall we supplicate a due Impression of these divine Terrors upon our People? Will the Prayer-Book supply us in this Case? It's plain, it will not; nor in a∣ny other uncommon Exigence or Change of Pro∣vidence.</P>
<P>We are taught, Rom. viii.16. <HI>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our Infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought</HI> &amp;c. But how can this be true, that we know not what we should pray for, if we pray by a Form; and are always ac∣quainted with the Matter of our Prayers? You pretend indeed, that <HI>what the Spirit helps Man to, is not the Words of Prayer; but such Groanings that cannot be uttered.</HI> But the Text assures us, that he helps in the Matter of Prayer, as well as the o∣ther; and it's in vain here to dispute against the Letter of the Text.</P>
<P>In a Word, we that use conceived Prayers in God's publick Worship, have at least this Advan∣tage of you. We have Scripture-Patterns and Ex∣amples to warrant our Conduct. We have the
<PB N="68" REF="004237_0073_100429928F8D7200"/>
Examples of the whole Church under the legal Dispensation. We have the Examples of Christ himself and his Apostles. And you are not capa∣ble to bring one Example from Scripture, of one Form of human Composition, being made the Matter of constant publick Worship; or one Di∣rection to the Church, to compose or use, much less to impose, any Form of Prayer for the con∣stant publick Worship of God. We shall there∣fore think our selves safe in our Conduct, not∣withstanding any Pretences of greater Reverence and Decency, or greater Affection and Devoti∣on, in the Use of Forms than without them, since we have not only our own Experience to plead against all such Pretences; but all the Instances of publick Prayer in the whole Bible, to vouch for us. Let such therefore, that complain of the Indecency and want of Affection in the Use of con∣ceived Prayers, consider where this Charge will terminate; and whether they don't equally fix this Charge upon all the holy Men of God, whose Prayers are recorded in the Bible, as upon us.</P>

<P><HI>Your third Charge is, the</HI> Tautologies <HI>in the Common Prayer, or Repetitions, are teaching for Doc∣trines the Commandments of Men. And you say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> use the same Words twenty Times. To this I answer∣ed, when the People say twenty Times,</HI> We beseech thee to hear us good Lord, <HI>it is in the Conclusion of twenty different Prayers.</HI> (p. 46.)</P>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I distinctly consider what you here offer, it will be proper to state the Case between us; and to observe, that I have no where con∣demned all <HI>Repetitions</HI> in Prayer, or at all blamed the occasional Reiteration of the same Thing by a devout Soul enflamed with ardent Affection, e∣specially in private Devotions. Yet I can't but think, that the Argument retains its full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against your Liturgy, notwithstanding this Conces∣sion. Partly, because there can be no Secu∣rity, that the whole Assembly sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll always be fa∣vour'd with such a Degree of devout Affection, every Time the Litany is used, as shall make such Repetitions a reasonable Service; and partly, be∣ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se there is no warmth of Affection or Degree of Devo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that can make it a reasonable Service, to repeat one Petition so often as yours are repeated;
<PB N="73" REF="004237_0078_1004040B1724BA78" MS="y"/>
nor are these numerous Repetitions at all calcu∣lated to raise either our Affections or Devotion; but to take off the Edge of both, by keeping the Mind so constantly intent to the very same Thing, without any Variation.</P>
<P>You tell us, that when you repeat the same Pe∣tition twenty Times, it's in the Conclusion of twen∣ty different Prayers. But the same Answer may with equal Justice be given to any Charge of vain Repetitions, that can possibly be imagined. It may be alledged, that they are all different Pray∣ers, upon the same Grounds. The State of the Case is this: In one continued Service, the People by Way of Response must say, <HI>Good Lord deliver us,</HI> eight Times; and, <HI>We beseech thee to hear us good Lord,</HI> one and twenty Times successively, without saying any Thing else. It's true, that there are as many short Petitions offered by the Minister, to which these Responses are made; but it's also as true, that if all these Petitions were used by the Minister in one continued Prayer, and <HI>good Lord deliver us,</HI> or <HI>we beseech thee to hear us good Lord,</HI> once pronounced by the People, (if they must bear a vocal Part in your Prayers) it would be full as per∣tinent; and I think, much more Devout. And what Reason can possibly be given, why they must be thus often repeated? I may add, that this same continued Service begins with eight distinct Repe∣titions of these Words, <HI>Have Mercy upon us miserable Sinners,</HI> between the Minister and People, without any other Petition intervening; or any Thing else to diversify this Address, but the bare naming the glorious God in his several personal Relations. And the same Service ends with the Repetition of these Words, <HI>Have Mercy upon us,</HI> seven Times, and <HI>Hear us,</HI> four Times; tho' the former had been repeated eight Times, and the latter above twenty
<PB N="74" REF="004237_0079_100429A387CBDD68"/>
Times before, in the same continued Prayer▪ That there is no less than Forty eight Repetitions, in one short Prayer. And to all this I may sub∣join, that besides the several Instances of the like Kind in the Liturgy, you always use what you call the <HI>Lord's Prayer</HI> (tho' as observ'd before, it is a new Form of your own making) several Time in the same Service; and upon some Occasions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Times in one Assembly; and when this happens, there are fifty four Repetitions used in the same Time of publick Worship. And how in all this you can escape the Imputation of vain Repetitions, it concerns you to inform us.</P>
<P>Our blessed Lord forbids us to <HI>use vain Repetiti∣ons as the Heathen do; for they think they shall be heard for their much Speaking.</HI> And I demand a∣gai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of you, what is this much speaking of the same Thing for? Is it that you may be heard of God on Account of it, or is it meerly trifling? If the former, they are <HI>vain Repetitions</HI> by the Sen∣tence of Christ himself. If the latter, we have no Cause to be fond of your Service. As for your Pretence of exciting People's Devotion by this Means, the same Pretence may be always made, for the most vain Repetitions in the World. It might be made by the Priests of <HI>Baal</HI>; and it is actually made by the <HI>Papists,</HI> whom your Church condemns for <HI>vain Repetitions.</HI> But it is imperti∣nently made by all; for to what, I beseech you, can it excite our Devotion, to say the same Thing o∣ver and over so very often, unless to make us de∣voutly expect to be heard for our much speaking the same Thing?</P>

<P>Is ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no Difference between Praying and Singing? Are they not several Parts of publick Worship? And can it be thought just arguing, that because we may use <HI>Repetitions</HI> in singing, therefore we may use <HI>Repetitions</HI> in Prayer, as frequent, and in the same Manner? That because it's proper to have a <HI>Burden</HI> to a Song (as the Case of the 136th <HI>Psalm</HI>) that therefore it's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have a <HI>Burden</HI> to a Prayer too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Very fine, then according to you it's no Matter how many</HI> Tautologies <HI>or</HI> Repetitions <HI>are used, if they are but sung. We may cry, as the</HI> Papists, <HI>a whole Hour together,</HI> O Jesu, Jesu, Jesu, <HI>and all is well, if we do but sing it.</HI> (p. 47.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but won't the <HI>Repetitions</HI> in the 136th Psalm, at least as well justify the Papist's <HI>Repetitions</HI> in singing, as your so numerous <HI>Repetitions</HI> in pray∣ing? How can it be urged with more Propriety for you than for them? Pray, Sir, shew me the Difference. They have at least this Advantage of you, that they imitate the <HI>Psalmist</HI> in making a Song of their <HI>Repetitions,</HI> which you do not, un∣less in your Cathedral Worship As for your Charge of their crying <HI>Iesu, Iesu,</HI> an Hour toge∣ther, it is unjust; but were it true, what Reason can be given for forty eight (if not fifty four) <HI>Re∣petitions,</HI> in the same Service; that won't justify ever so many more?</P>
<P>But the worst of it is, that your Instance of the 136th Psalm don't come up to your Case. For there is no Prayer at all in that Psalm. If it be allowed you, that some of the Psalms are properly Prayers; yet that Psalm is not. Nor can you find any Example of such numerous <HI>Repetitions</HI> in any Prayers in the Bible, either in the <HI>Psalter</HI> or any
<PB N="76" REF="004237_0081_1004040E83BD6D90"/>
where else. So that the whole of your Argument can amount to no more than this, that because <HI>David</HI> did use many <HI>Repetitions</HI> in making a <HI>Burden</HI> to a sacred Song, which was not a Prayer; therefore you may use many more Repetitions than he did in your Prayers; and impose them upon us as necessary Terms of Communion.</P>

<P>What is this to the Purpose? When we sing Psal. cxxxvi. where those Repetitions are used, we do not pray; and therefore your urging this is but a meer Evasion.

<P>That is, Christ prayed three Times in one Night to the same Purpose, with considerable in∣tervals between those Times of Prayer; and used the Name of God twice in his Prayer on the Cross.

If I have said any such Thing as you charge upon me, pray direct me where to find the Passage; but if the Charge have no Foundation of Truth, but is wholly your own Invention, a Retractation is due both to the World and to me. But tho' I never said or tho't any Thing like what you insinuate: yet I did and do think, that <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Fervour of Affection, break∣ing forth in the same Petition three or four Times in one Prayer, won't justify your imposing such a great Number of <HI>Repetitions</HI> upon all that you ad∣mit to your Communion, whether they have any such Fervour of Affection, to lead them into <HI>Repe∣titions,</HI> or not.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Head, by earnestly request∣ing you to tell us plainly what <HI>vain Repetitions</HI> are, that it may be fairly put to the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al, whether the <HI>Repetitions</HI> we complain of, will agree with your Definition of <HI>vain Repetitions,</HI> or no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: and whether you can find any <HI>Criterion</HI> by which these <HI>Repetitions</HI> can be distinguished from those among the <HI>Papists,</HI> which your Church calls <HI>vain Repetitions.</HI></P>

And therefore the Comparison here should be, who read most of the Bible, the Church of <HI>England</HI> in their daily publick Prayers, or our People in their daily Family Prayers; and then I'm sure the Comparison would not turn out to our Disadvantage. But the Difficulty still remains. Why are the other Parts of the Bible neglected; and the <HI>Apocrypha</HI> substituted in their Stead?

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Sir, you misunderstand me. I have not given up that Point. The Clause you find Fault with in my Sermon was this: <HI>Since it is con∣fessed on all Hands that the Cross as abused by the Church of Rome has been one of their greatest Idols: shall the Church of</HI> England <HI>who abhor their Idolatry, give the Honour of a Sacrament to a popish Idol.</HI> Now the only Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estion is, whether the Church of <HI>England</HI> does give the Honour of a <HI>Sacrament</HI> to the <HI>Sign</HI> of the <HI>Cross</HI> or not. The Church's own Definiti∣on of a <HI>Sacrament</HI> is this: <HI>An outward and v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sible Sign of an inward spiritual Grace, given unto us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣dain'd by Christ himself as a Means whereby we receive the same, and a Pledge to assure us thereof.</HI> The Church tells us in her Catachism, that there are <HI>two Parts in a Sacrament, the outward visible Sign; and the inward spiritual Grace.</HI> The same Church directs, that the <HI>Sign</HI> of the <HI>Cross</HI> shall be used in Baptism, <HI>in Token that hereafter</HI> the Baptized Per∣son <HI>shall not be ashamed to confess the Faith of Christ crucified; and manfully to fight under his Banner,
<PB N="83" REF="004237_0088_100429C124D89E00" MS="y"/>
against Sin the World and the Devil; and to conti∣nue Christ's faithful Soldier and Servant unto his Life's End.</HI> Now you must own, that both the Parts of a <HI>Sacrament</HI> are attributed to the <HI>Sign</HI> of the <HI>Cross.</HI> It is <HI>an outward visible Sign</HI>; and to confess the Faith of Christ crucified, to manful fight und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his Banner, to continue his faithful Soldier and Servant, do imply <HI>inward spiritual Grace.</HI> And what can be wanting to a <HI>Sacrament,</HI> where there are all the Parts of it? Your Church tells us, that there are but two Parts in a <HI>Sacrament</HI>; and ascribes both these Parts to the <HI>Sign</HI> of the <HI>Cross.</HI> And are not all the Parts equal to the whole?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Essence of a</HI> Sacrament <HI>lies in this, that the visible Sign is appointed▪ as a</HI> Means <HI>whereby the invisible Grace is convey'd from God to Man; and as a</HI> Pledge <HI>to assure us, that God will give it to us, upon our duly using that outward Sign But the</HI> Sign <HI>of the</HI> Cross <HI>is not pretended to be a</HI> Pledge <HI>from God to us to give us Assurance of any Thing he will do for us.</HI> (p. 55.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if the Church of <HI>England</HI> does not only pretend, but in express Words determine, that this <HI>Sign</HI> is also a <HI>Pledge</HI> of Christ's Merits, will you then own, that she gives it the Honour of a <HI>Sacrament</HI>? Be pleased then to read your 30th <HI>Canon,</HI> in the latin Edition; and there you'll find it called <HI>Tessara et Signum meritorum Christi.</HI> A <HI>Pledge</HI> and Sign of the Merits of Christ. I think you'll own that the latin Edition of your <HI>Canons,</HI> was the first and authentick Edition.</P>
<P>If you still object, that this does not prove that this <HI>Sign</HI> is appointed as <HI>a Means whereby the invisi∣ble Grace is convey'd from God to Man</HI>: Let us see
<PB N="84" REF="004237_0089_100429C2E366E590"/>
whether the Church of <HI>England</HI> has not her self determin'd that Cause also. Read then the same <HI>Canon,</HI> where you'll find, that Children were sign∣ed with this Sign when they were christned, <HI>to dedicate them by that Badge to his Service, whose Benefits be∣stowed upon them in Baptism, the Name of the Cross did represent.</HI> I think it must be allowed, if this <HI>Sign</HI> dedicates Children to Christ, and if it be a Badge of his Service; it is as much a Means to convey Grace as Baptism it self; and by this Ac∣count of it, as much a <HI>Sacrament,</HI> the divine Insti∣tution only excepted. It's true, that the <HI>Sign</HI> of the <HI>Cross</HI> is not a <HI>Sacrament</HI> instituted by Christ himself; nor was I so stupid as to object against the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the appointing a new Sacrament insti∣tuted by Christ himself. But what I objected was, that they have brought in by their own Authority, and imposed upon us this Rite, without any Insti∣tution of Christ, to which they ascribe the same Virtue and Properties, as to the <HI>Sacraments.</HI> And for ought I can see to the contrary, I have fully justified my Objection. — I have shewn that the <HI>Sign</HI> of the <HI>Cross</HI>▪ according to the Decrees of your Church, every Way answers your own Definition of a <HI>Sacrament</HI> in all it's Nature and Propertie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> It's by your own <HI>Formula's</HI> determin'd to be a visi∣ble Sign of invisible Grace, a Means to convey Grace▪ and a Pledge to assure us of it. And have I not Reason then to complain, that the Honour of a Sacrament is given to the <HI>Sign</HI> of the <HI>Cross</HI>? This Rite, of meerly human Institution, that has been prostituted to the most idolatrous Purposes in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that has been a dreadful S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re to Multitudes of poor Souls, that has shed much precious Blood, and is a stumbling Block to very many of the best People in the Nation, is yet annexed to the Sacrament of Baptism, so that

This is the State of the Case. And let the World judge, whether there is not just Cause to object against the imposing such Shackles upon Men's Consciences</P>
<P>What Reason can possibly be given, why this <HI>Sign</HI> should not be treated as the <HI>brazen Serpent</HI> was by <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and called <HI>Nehushtan</HI>? What Reason can there be, why this <HI>Sign</HI> which has been so much polluted and abused to an idolatrous Use in the Roman Church, should not be utterly abolished as God has required that all the Re∣mainders of Idolatry should be, <HI>Numb</HI> xxxiii.52. <HI>Deut.</HI> vii 5.25. And xii.3 <HI>Isa</HI> xxx 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? What Pretence can be made why this Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, which has done so much Harm and can do no good, should be made a Term of Communion in your Church? Why should the cursed Instrument of our blessed Saviour's extream Sufferings, be had in such Honour among you? What Plea can possibly be made for the Sign of the Cross, that can't with the same Justice be used for all the <HI>popish</HI> Sacraments; and for all their Institutions and Impositions? Here Sir, I provoke you to try your Skill, in making this Comparison.

<P><HI>You make the Apostles that Night to eat but one Supper; when it is plain that they eat two, if not three distinct Suppers. — It is as evident as Words can make it, that after the first Supper or the</HI> Passover, <HI>Christ rose up and washed his Disciples Feet; and after
<PB N="89" REF="004237_0094_100429D8739304A8" MS="y"/>
this sat down to Table again; and then they eat what is called the</HI> Sop, <HI>of which</HI> Judas <HI>partook.</HI> Joh. xiii.26. <HI>After all this Christ went to Prayer, and con∣secrated the Lord's Supper, from which they are never said to rise up; and therefore according to you they never sat down to it.</HI> (p. 62.)</P>

<P>If all this proves to be a Mistake, it's hope∣ful you'll consider better for the fut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, before you are so very positive. I do indeed make the A∣postles that Night to eat but one Supper, and your groundless Imagination of two or three Suppers, flows from a sufficient Ignorance of the Subject you are treating of. We have no Account of their eating any Supper distinct from the <HI>Passover Supper,</HI> Part of which our Lord consecrated as a Memorial of his Death, to be kept in constant Use in the chris∣tian Church. "The Bread and Wine which our Saviour distributed at his last <HI>Passover,</HI> and ap∣pointed to signify and represent his Body and Blood, were not without the Extent of the paschal Supper; but within the Compass of it, and Rites belonging to it, only applied by him now, to a new evangelical Use and Signification" That this may be set in a cleared View, it may be pro∣per to give you a few brief Hints, of the Man∣ner of their celebrating the <HI>Passover</HI> Solemnity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Passover</HI> Table was furnished with Provisi∣ons of several Sorts, viz. Several Cups of Wine, bitter Herbs, unleavened Bread, and the Body of the paschal Lamb toasted whole, to which they added a thick Sauce or Sop called <HI>Charoseth.</HI> The chief Man of the Company, after they were sat down to the Table, in the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taketh a Cup of Wine and blesseth it, tasteth lightly of it; and gives it to the Company to divide among them∣selves: of this is the Account, <HI>Luke</HI> xxii.17. Then
<PB N="90" REF="004237_0095_100429DB37D8C4A8"/>
he taketh the bitter Herbs, and blesseth them, dips them in the Sauce or Sop before mention'd; and eats about the Quantity of an Olive, in which all the rest of the Company imitate him; and this was the Sop of which the Evangelists speak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Iohn</HI> xiii.26. Which instead of being a distinct Supper from the <HI>Passover,</HI> was the first Thing they eat at the <HI>Passover.</HI> The Institution whereof you find <HI>Exod.</HI> xii.28. After this he takes the Bread, which was lightly cut, but not separated, break<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> off a Peice of it, and lays the rest by till the Lamb was eaten; and eating Part of the Piece which he brake off, gives the remainder to the Company. Then he takes the second Cup of Wine; and the rest imitate him in drinking of it. Then they cut up the paschal Lamb and eat it, with the Bread that was laid by for that Purpose, Part of which Bread our Saviour consecrated as a Memorial of his Body; not after they were rise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the <HI>Passover</HI> as you suggest; but towards the Conclusion of it; and while they were eating it, as is attested by the Evangelists, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxvi.26. and <HI>Mark</HI> xiv.22. All this done, they take the third Cup, called <HI>the Cup of Blessing</HI> or <HI>Thanksgiv∣ing</HI> after Meat. And this third Cup after Sup∣per, with which they concluded that Solemnity, our Saviour applied to a New spiritual Significati∣on; and thus graffed this Gospel-Festival of the Lord's Supper, upon the Jewish Passover. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>They that would see this more largely represented, let 'em read</HI> Gataker<HI>'s Harmony of the four E∣vangelists</HI>; Godwin<HI>'s Moses and Aaron, and</HI> Lightfoot <HI>on the Passov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>There could be no Room for our Lord's rising up, washing his Disciples Feet, and maintaining a
<PB N="91" REF="004237_0096_100429DCFAA1C7E8" MS="y"/>
long Discourse with them upon that Occasion, sit∣ting down again; and then administring the Lord's Supper. For it's certain from the sacred Story, that this Ordinance was administred <HI>as they were eating,</HI> as <HI>Matthew</HI> expresseth it; and <HI>as they did eat,</HI> according to <HI>Mark</HI>; or <HI>while they were eating,</HI> as the Original in both Places should be rendred. And there is no Account that they ever rose up at all, till the whole Solemnity was over.</P>
<P>And if we look into the thirteenth Chapter of <HI>Iohn,</HI> there is no such Thing there as you pretend. Not a Word of our Saviour's sitting down to any other Supper, after washing his Disciples Feet; or any Thing that implies it: But only his sitting down as usual, in his ordinary Conversation. In the first Part of this Chapter, the Evangelist gives us the Narrative of our Lord's Conduct after that sacred Feast was ended, and they were risen up from Supper, which Narrative continues to the End of the 17 Verse. He then proceeds without any Connection with what went before, to give us another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Time to the former; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> after it. The like to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in Scripture; and particularly in the very Case before us, both <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> relate the Story of <HI>Iudas</HI>'s be∣traying Christ, before the Celebration of the Lord's Supper, when it's certain it was done afterward. Now this <HI>Prolepsis</HI> or Anticipation being allowed, there is a good Agreement between St. <HI>Iohn</HI> and the other Evangelists: But according to your Re∣presentation of it, there is a plain and palpable Contradiction, which must by no Means be suppos∣ed.</P>
<P>Your Mistake is founded upon the Supposition of an immediate Connection between the 17th and 18th Verses of this Chapter. But be pleased to
<PB N="92" REF="004237_0097_100429E3B01A0A88"/>
read them, and see if they are at all united. <HI>If ye know these Things, happy are ye if ye do them, I speak not of you all, I know whom I have chosen &amp;c.</HI> Did not Christ speak of all his Disciples, that they would be happy, if they did those Things that he had commanded them? — Could this be the Meaning of these Verses? No, certainly it could not. Whence it's evident, that since the <HI>Sense</HI> can∣not be connected, the <HI>Verses</HI> ought not to be con∣nected; and therefore, that all your Reasoning from this Supposition comes to Nothing.</P>
<P>In a Word, certain it is that our Lord with his Disciples did sit down at the <HI>Passover</HI>; and con∣tinued sitting at that Solemnity. How else did <HI>Iohn</HI> lean on <HI>Iesus</HI>'s Bosom? It is also certain that while they were eating the <HI>Passover,</HI> our Sa∣viour did consecrate the Elements in the <HI>Lord's-Supper</HI>; and that he did rise from the Table after Supper▪ and there is not the least Insinuation in all the Evangelist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that they ever rose at all during the Celebration of this Ordinance. I must there∣for (by your Leave) again conclude, that I des∣pair of ever seeing any Thing prov'd, by the most plain, positive, and intelligible Expressions, if this don't prove that Christ and his Disciples did par∣take of this Ordinance sitting in a Table-Posture.</P>

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>A wonderful Assertion! An adoring Pos∣ture upon our Knees, is more like sitting at Table a little leaning, than sitting upright at Table, is like it. Was Kneeling ever used as a Table-Pos∣ture; or ever proposed in Scripture as a proper Posture at any eucharistical Feast? Whereas on the contrary, sitting at Table in such Feasts is ap∣proved by God himself, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xvi.11. <HI>Ezek.</HI> xliv.3. And exemplified in the Case before us by our blessed Lord. And is not this sufficient War∣rant for our Conduct?</P>
<P>To sum up this Debate; <HI>Kneeling</HI> at the Sacra∣ment was brought in by the <HI>Papists,</HI> by Way of <HI>Adoration</HI> to the Elements, which they suppose <HI>transubstantiated</HI> into the very Body and Blood of Christ: and as used by them, is a most abo∣minable <HI>Idolatry,</HI> to be abhorred by all good Men. And for my Part, I had rather imitate the Pattern set me by the Lord <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> and his Apostles, than write after so b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a Copy; whatever Decla∣ration can be made, of retaining the Posture and rejecting the Idolatry. In th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> doing, I'm sure I am safe. And whatever Reflections you cast upon me, of symbolizing with the <HI>Pope,</HI> with <HI>Socinians,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="004237_0099_10042A23347CD420"/>
or whatever else you please, must extend to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri∣ginal Example, and ultimately terminate there. This I think to be worthy of your serious Consideration. To conclude, as kneeling towards any real or ima∣ginary Representation of God, or heavenly Things, does incur the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilt of Idolatry in God's Account, even when the Worship does ultimately refer to God himself; I do not therefore chuse to kneel before the Elements, which are Representations of our Lord <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> lest I too much imitate Image-Worship, and countenance the Idolatry of the Papists; especially since Christ himself has giv∣en us a contrary Example, and Kneeling is not an appointed Posture for Meditation and ejaculatory Prayer, which are the special Duties to be at∣tended at the Time of receiving the Elements.</P>

<P>A <HI>Quaker</HI> may very justly make this Objec∣tion, upon your pretence of personal and exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icit Co∣venanting. And I confess▪ I know not what Answer can possibly be given to such an Objection. But then upon our Grounds of proceeding in this Case, there is no Room for a <HI>Quaker,</HI> or any Body else, to thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such Objections in our Way. The Infant has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> undoubted Interest in the outward Privileges of the Covenant, by Vertue of the Parent's Cove∣nant-Right <HI>For the Promise is to you and to your Children,</HI> Acts ii.39 — <HI>Else were your Children unclean, but now are they holy,</HI> 1 Cor. vii.14.

May not a Parent put his Infant's Name into a Lease for Lands; and secure him
<PB N="97" REF="004237_0102_100429F3C6E7BEF8"/>
the Privileges of that Lease when he comes of Age? And is not the Infant when he comes of Age, bound to fulfil the Conditions of the Lease, upon the Penalty of forfeiting his Interest in it? And why he may not as consistently bring his Children into the Privileges and Obligations of this Lease of spiritual Blessings, in the same Man∣ner, and under the same Penalty, let any Objector give a Reason when he is able.</P>

<P><HI>Again you say,</HI> How came the Proxies to get the Child baptized without his Leave? <HI>Witty still! but a fatal Blow to Infant-Baptism.</HI> (p. 71.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said no such Thing; but you are forced thus to turn my Words, to make 'em suit your Purpose. I did say, and do still say, <HI>How came the Sureties to be the Child's Proxies without his Leave,</HI> and to pro∣fess and promise in his Name what he gave them no Power or Authority to promise for him? For tho' the <HI>Parent</HI> hath in himself a natural Au∣thority, and is obliged by the Command of Christ, to dedicate his Child to God in Baptism: Yet the <HI>Child</HI> has not given, nor is capable of giving Au∣thority to any Man, <HI>in his Name,</HI> to declare what his <HI>Faith</HI> is, what his <HI>Desires, Purposes,</HI> and <HI>Resolu∣tions</HI> are. This yet appears to me an Affair most ludicrous and trifling.</P>
<P>I think, on a Review of the Case, you'll find that you have gain'd Nothing by forcing me upon a distinct Consideration of this Plea of yours; for it nothing at all affects what I had before urged in this Case: I did justly complain, that the Sureties promise what it's God's Prerogative to per∣form. For tho' they do speak in the Name of the Child, yet the Church does understand it as their own Vow on the Behalf of the Child, and expresly
<PB N="98" REF="004237_0103_100429F6C74B5710"/>
declares in the Catechism, that THEY PROMISE and VOW three Things in it's Name, That it SHOULD renounce the Devil and all his Works, That it SHOULD believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith, That it SHOULD keep God's ho∣ly Will and Commandments <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Case must be thus understood; or else (which is an Ob∣servation worth your minding) there is no Promise at all for the Child's religious <HI>Education,</HI> either by Parents or Sureties. The Sureties are obliged to this; or they are obliged to Nothing at all, on the Child's Behalf. This is their Covenant; or they are under no Covenant on Behalf of the Child: and consequently the Child has no Cove∣nant-Right at all, either from its Parents or Sure∣ties; and therefore no Claim at all to the Seal of the Covenant. Answer this consistently, if you can. It yet therefore appears, that what the Sure∣ties promise, is beyond human Power to perform: And their speaking impertinently in the Name of the Child, will never give them Ability to do it.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I said, Here, the Sureties make no Promise of any Thing they will do for the Child, but only are his Mouth &amp;c. To this, you knew, you could not reply: therefore you honestly leave out</HI> (Here) <HI>which though a small Particle, yet governs the whole Sentence.</HI> (p. 71.)</P>

<P>I have taken some Pains to consult, what Advantage it could have been to my Cause to have left out that Word (if I had done so) that I might find out the Occasion of this Accusation: But I can't find out how that would any Way have af∣fected the Argument between us. However, be that as it will, the Accusation is very surprizing: For that Word stands as fair and open to View in
<PB N="99" REF="004237_0104_100429FBC0C91C60" MS="y"/>
my <HI>Defence,</HI> as it does in your <HI>Vindication</HI>; but the Clause it belongs to is very exactly cited. Be pleased, Sir, to put on your Spectacles; and look steadily for the Word (<HI>Here</HI>) you'll certainly find it. (<HI>Def.</HI> p. 64) I've quoted it once; nor do you under that Head use it oftner. So that it is Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> who must take to himself all the Glory of <HI>the new Figure,</HI> and <HI>the Manful Triumph,</HI> you speak of; and the Charge of <HI>dishonest Tricks, an Argument of a desperate Cause,</HI> recoils on your self.</P>
<P>As to your Cavils against that harmless Passage in my <HI>Defence,</HI> That <HI>God has never given, never promised Assistance to any Man, in changing the Hearts, and sanctifying the Natures, and governing the Affections and Passions of others</HI>; which, you in your <HI>Appeal</HI> say, <HI>is either a false and pernicious Doctrine, or else a Piece of solid Nonsence</HI>: I am willing to leave it to our Readers, without spending more Words about it. Let them judge, whether it be <HI>the same Thing, to be assisted,</HI> IN DOING THE WORK OUR SELVES, <HI>or</HI> IN BEING ONLY INSTRUMENTS <HI>in the Hands of the great Workman</HI>; as you say it is. Let them judge, whether it be the same Thing for you to assist your <HI>Pen</HI> in dictating this fine Discourse of yours, as to use it as an Instrument in your Hand to communicate your Dictates to others. If they determine, as you do, in the Affirmative, I depend upon their Decree in my Favour, that your <HI>Pen</HI> has been a little too angry. — Let them judge, whether St. <HI>Paul</HI> did any Way <HI>himself</HI> open Men's Eyes and change their Hearts; or whether Christ was the sole Efficient, and wrought this glorious Change by his own Almighty Power, only em∣ploying <HI>Paul</HI> as an Instrument, and blessing the Means used for obtaining that End. If <HI>Paul</HI> did not do the Work himself, he was not assisted in doing it; but was meerly an Instrument in the

Hands of Christ. If he did do it himself, he did do it by almighty Power; for it was an Almighty Work.</P>
<P>Upon the whole▪ you may observe, if you'll look into Dr. <HI>Comber's Companion to the Temple,</HI> which is generally allow'd to be a genuine Expo∣sition of the Common-Prayer Book, That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sense of the Promise of Sureties, in the Office of Baptism, is not very foreign from <HI>mine.</HI> He tells us, That Infants enter into the baptismal Cove∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>no other Way but by having some to</HI> ENGAGE <HI>that they</HI> SHOULD <HI>stand to God's Terms.</HI> He tells us. The Sure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies <HI>may very well</HI> PROMISE <HI>that the Child</HI> SHALL <HI>believe these divine Truths, since they were all revealed from Heaven &amp;c.</HI> — In expound∣ing the Exhortation to Godfathers and Godmo∣thers, he puts them upon a Review of what they have done, and says, <HI>They have</HI> ENGAGED FOR <HI>a Minor unto Almighty God; — They are become</HI> SURETIES <HI>and</HI> BONDSMEN <HI>for this Child unto the Majesty of Heaven; — You have</HI> UNDERTAKEN (says he) <HI>that this Child</HI> SHALL <HI>renounce the De∣vil, believe in God, and serve Him.</HI> [And the <HI>Dr.</HI> in his Discourse on the Office of <HI>Confirmation,</HI> speaks as if Godfathers <HI>obtain'd a</HI> DISCHARGE <HI>from the Bonds they have entered,</HI> and so receive <HI>a great Benefit</HI> themselves, when they bring their Charge carefully prepared to the Bishop for Confirmati∣on] — Indeed the <HI>Dr.</HI> justly observes, That i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is not in the Sureties <HI>Power to give the Child Grace</HI>: But then he seems to be of Opinion, That they are beneficial to the Child, as performing those Things for the Child, which are the necessary Conditions of obtaining the Grace of Baptism: His Words are expresly these;
"Infants <HI>may receive the good Things of Baptism BY THE FAITH OF THOSE WHO REPRESENT THEM. He quotes that

Saying of</HI> Rabanus Maurus, — It is manifest that as Children drew those Sins from others which are re∣mitted to them in Baptism, so also <HI>BY OTHERS</HI> they may believe unto Salvation. —So that <HI>(the Dr adds)</HI> we ought to believe, till the Child be capable, the Faith of its <HI>SURETIES</HI> is so far accepted for it, as to enti∣tle it to all the Blessings of the Covenant; and it is an ex∣cellent Charity of the Church to lend them Hands to receive such a Mercy▪ without which they must remain under the Power of Death"
— I shall make no Reflec∣tions upon these extraordinary Lines: but suppose 'em to exhibit the Sense of your Church upon the Matter; For this Book of Dr. <HI>Comber</HI>'s is very much read and recommended among you as a most <HI>Authentick</HI> Commentary on the Church-Service, and as such is said to be put into the Hands of <HI>Students</HI> in the Universities at home very generally.

No, Sir, There is no more Founda∣tion for all this, than Mr. <HI>Beach</HI>'s Apprehension, that this Way of representing the Case would serve his Turn best. I am still of Opinion, that it's a great deal too bold for any Man upon Earth (the Pope not excepted) to Authoritatively declare God'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Absolution or Pardon to any one, whatever Pro∣fession he may make; and it is yet much bolder, to solemnly declare it in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that you absolve any Man from all his Sins. For as you cannot know any Man's Heart, whether his Profession of Re∣pentance be sincere; and whether his Sins be par∣doned: So God has given you no Authority to pardon his Sins, if his Repentance were ever so sincere.</P>
<P>You declare to the sick Person, that by <HI>Christ's Authority committed to you, you absolve him from all his Sins, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</HI> Now I desire to know, where Christ has commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted to you this Authority, to pardon Sins in his Name?

have you not? If you have, I hope you won't condemn the <HI>Papists</HI> for claiming it: For why mayn't they pretend to it as well as you? Nor will you blame People for <HI>purchasing</HI> their Pardon of the Priest: for how can their Money be bet∣ter expended? But if you have not this Authori∣ty, all your Explications are impertinent. — You do in the most sacred and solemn Manner assert, that you have this Authority committed to you by Christ; and you do in the Name of the ado∣rable Trinity pretend to exercise it, in absolving the sick Person from all his Sins. And by what Explication is it possible to palliate this Pretence to pardon Men's Sins; but by declaring to the World, that you <HI>say</HI> one Thing, and <HI>mean</HI> ano∣ther, even when you speak in the awful Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. If you pre∣tend to mean a <HI>declarative</HI> and <HI>conditional</HI> Pardon; yet you pronounce an <HI>absolute</HI> and <HI>unconditional</HI> Par∣don, in as strong Terms as easily can be invent∣ed. — And by the Way, Has your Church ever given us any such Explication of her Meaning, as you pretend to, or given you any Authority to do it for her?

<P>By the <HI>first</HI> of these, all Persons baptized, when come to competent Age, and able to say the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the ten Commandments, and the shorter Catechism, are to be brought to Confirmation: The Bishop having ask'd, <HI>Whe∣ther they renew their solemn Promise and Vow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was made in their Name at Baptism?</HI> upon their answering, <HI>We do,</HI> declares in the most solemn and publick Manner, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en in an <HI>Address to God himself, that he has vouchsafed to regenerate these his Servants by Water and the Holy Ghost, and to give them the Forgiveness of all their Sins</HI>; and laying his Hands
<PB N="109" REF="004237_0114_10042A14B58120D8" MS="y"/>
upon the Head of each particular Person, <HI>he certi∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s him by that Sign, of God's Favour and gracious Goodness toward him.</HI></P>
<P>Now this <HI>Bishop</HI> we are taught to look upon as the Ambassador of Jesus Christ, and a Successor of the Apostles, who had Power to remit Sins: And when they hear this venerable Person thus so∣lemnly declaring that God <HI>hath regenerated and forgiven them</HI>; who can wonder, if they really be∣lieve themselves to be so, and upon these Grounds indulge a confident Security as to the Favour of God, and Happiness in a future World?</P>
<P>That the poor ignorant and unthinking Part of the People should be thus easily deluded, is not so strange: But that such learned, wise and pious Men, as our Rev. Bishops are, who know the Aptness of Mankind to deceive themselves by false Hopes, and the infinite Folly and Danger of their so doing; that <HI>these</HI> should thus contribute to lull them asleep, and without knowing their Hearts, or a due Enquiry into their Lives, declare them in the Presence of God regenerated and par∣doned, is a Conduct truly surprizing, and not easi∣ly to be accounted for.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Absolution of sick Penitents,</HI> the sick Person <HI>being mov'd to make a special Confession of his Sins, if he feel his Conscience troubled with any weighty Mat∣ter, after such Confession the Priest shall absolve him (if be humbly and heartily desire it) after this Sort: Our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath left Power to his Church to absolve all Sinners who truly repent and be∣lieve in him, of his great Mercy forgive thee thine Offen∣ces; and</HI> by the Authority committed to me, I ab∣solve thee from all thy Sins, <HI>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What</HI> and <HI>where</HI> is that Church, to which Christ has left this Power? Is it the Catholick and
<PB N="110" REF="004237_0115_10042A184A0DEDC8"/>
universal Church, or any national or provincial Church? Or, is it every particular Society of worshipping Christians? In what Persons is it lodged? with the whole <HI>Body of the People,</HI> who, according to Scripture-Language, and the Doctrine of our own Articles, are properly called <HI>the Church</HI>; or with the <HI>Ministers</HI> or <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are never so called? In the former Part, 'tis said to be <HI>left to the</HI> CHURCH; but in the latter the PRIEST claims it as <HI>his Peculiar</HI>; to which, when his Claim shall have been fully proved, his Character shall be confess'd <HI>indelible</HI> and <HI>sacred,</HI> and Incense and the Knee be offered him as the Representative of Christ upon Earth.</P>
<P>If Christ hath given Power to any <HI>authoritative∣ly</HI> to absolve <HI>those who are truly penitent,</HI> he must also have given them Power <HI>to know who are truly penitent,</HI> else 'tis a Power to do just nothing: For till they <HI>know</HI> them to be truly penitent (<HI>i. e.</HI> till they can search their Hearts) they cannot <HI>authori∣tatively absolve</HI> them; and if they cannot do it till <HI>then,</HI> they cannot do it at all.</P>
<P>Is a <HI>meer Conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion</HI> of Sin all the Gospel demands, in order to it's Forgiveness? Must it not be <HI>fors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k</HI> and <HI>broken</HI> off as well as <HI>confessed</HI>? Are not the most debauched, when Sickness seizes, and Death is thought to approach them, wont to <HI>feel their Conscience troubled,</HI> readily to confess their Sin, to express great Sorrow, to vow Amendment if spar∣ed? But when the Danger is blown off, is it hard∣ly ever seen that they return not to their Crimes with as mad a Gust as before?</P>
<P>Another Absurdity in this dangerous and delu∣sive Form <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that tho' the Confession be but <HI>speci∣al,</HI> the Absolution is <HI>general</HI> But, by what Lo∣gick? Or from what Scripture, is this Inference
<PB N="111" REF="004237_0116_100404281011BD30" MS="y"/>
drawn, that a Contrition for <HI>some Sins,</HI> shall ob∣tain Forigveness of <HI>all Sins</HI>?</P>
<P>Well — but the sick Man dies — he liv'd a vicious and debauch'd Life, was a known Drunk∣ard, Adulterer but when his last Sickness came, he trembled at the Thought of Death — sent for the Priest, confess'd his Sin, and desired to be absolved: The Priest <HI>by Authority committed to him</HI> in the most solemn Form of Words, even <HI>in the, Name of the Father, &amp;c.</HI> pronounces and declares him absolved from all his Sins. The unhappy Person thus dead comes now to be buried. Here the Priest, in the Face of a vast Croud who knew the Man's wicked Life, solemnly declares, <HI>That God hath taken to himself the Soul of this our dear Bro∣ther — gives him hearty Thanks that it hath pleased him to deliver this our Brother out of the Miseries of this sinful World — and prays, that when we shall depart this Life we may rest in him</HI> (Christ) <HI>as our Hope is this our Brother doth.</HI> What can the at∣tending Croud think of all this? If they think at all, it must be either.</P>
<P>First, that what the Priest hath said is <HI>true,</HI> and may be depended on as <HI>the Word of God,</HI> whose Ambassador he is supposed to be; and if so, <HI>Remis∣sion</HI> may, be had in this World, and <HI>Salvation</HI> in the other, <HI>without breaking off my Sins</HI>: I shall have Peace therefore, tho' I go on <HI>to add Drunkenness to Thirst</HI>; and however vicious my Life be, may have hope in my Death that I shall <HI>rest in Christ,</HI> as the Priest tells me, <HI>this our Brother</HI> doth.</P>
<P>Secondly, If these Pretensions and Expressions be examin'd but by common Sense, they appear to be all a <HI>solemn</HI> FARCE, a <HI>shocking and gross</HI> DELUSION; a dangerous Encouragement to careless and im∣moral Living; subversive of good Order and Virtue upon Earth; calculated to advance the Power of

Priests, and to stupify and enslave the Consciences of Men, There are Numbers of our wise Clergy who groan under these unhappy Forms, and sin∣cerely wish them removed: Why <HI>in the Name of God,</HI> are they not removed?

<P><HI>I proceed to the tenth Charge, which is against</HI> Holy-Days. <HI>Here I observed, you keep human Holy-Days as well as we, and therefore I conclude you don't think it a Sin — But you say,</HI> Tho' we have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Authority to make Time holy, yet we have Au∣thority to set apart Time for holy Services. <HI>This Distinction is learned enough in all Conscience!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>The clearing this Point will (I think) be a sufficient Answer to all your Reasonings in your <HI>Appeal,</HI> from the imagined Parallel between our observing Lecture-Days, occasional Fasts and Thanksgivings, and your observing all the <HI>Ho∣ly-Days</HI> appointed in your <HI>Kalendar.</HI> I shall there∣fore something distinctly consider the Case.</P>
<P>I did say, that <HI>tho' we have not Authority from God to make Time holy; yet we have Authority to set apart Time for these holy Services</HI> (i. e. such Servi∣ces as he has appointed and has made it our Duty to attend) <HI>when his Providence calls for it.</HI> Whatever religious Duties are performed by us in Obedience
<PB N="113" REF="004237_0118_10042A1DAB723140" MS="y"/>
to God's Command, must be done in Time; and consequently there must be some Time set apart for their Observance, if they are attended at all: Whence it follows, that he who requires us to per∣form those Duties, requires us also to set apart Time for their Performance. The same Command (for Example) that requires Ministers to preach in Season and out of Season, requires them to improve some Time for the Discharge of that Du∣ty; and therefore requires them to take some o∣ther Time to preach to the People, besides the stated Seasons on the Lord's Day. The same Com∣mands that require occasional <HI>Fasts</HI> and <HI>Thanksgiv∣ings,</HI> require also that we occasionally set apart some Time to observe these <HI>Fasts</HI> and <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> without which they cannot be observed at all. From which Considerations it appears (as I shew∣ed you more largely in my Defence) That God has required us to observe <HI>Lectures,</HI> occasional <HI>Fast-Days</HI> and <HI>Thanksgiving-Days</HI>: And we have Au∣thority from him to set apart Time for these holy Services. Tho' he has given us no Authority at all to make Time holy; or to consecrate any stat∣ed periodical Returns of Time, so that these holy Services will be necessary on Account of the Time. Such a consecrating stated periodical Returns of Time to special Services, is what I mean't, and what the Scripture always means, by making Time ho∣ly. Thus under the levitical Dispensation, their Sabbaths were holy, their New-Moons, their stat∣ed Feasts and Fasts were holy, only on the Ac∣count of the Consecration of a stated Return of Time for these holy Services. Upon the same Ac∣count also, the Church of <HI>England</HI> calls her Feasts and Fasts <HI>holy Days</HI>; because of their Designation in an annual Return, to the peculiar Purposes for which they are appointed. It's remarkable, that
<PB N="114" REF="004237_0119_1004042B59AD8C20"/>
the occasional <HI>Fasts</HI> and <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>sgivings</HI> so frequent∣ly mentioned in Scripture, are never called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Days:</HI> nor are such occasional Appointments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> called in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> And the Reas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is, because the Services are not attended for the Sake of the Time: But the Time only observ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for the Sake of the Services. Whereas on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Contrary, upon all the Times that are called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Days,</HI> the Services must be observed on Accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Return of the consecrated Time, without any other special Call to their Observation. And is there no Difference in these Cases? Is there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Difference between attending required Duties▪ necessarily taking some Time to attend them; and making Time <HI>holy</HI>; or consecrating set Days every Year, for such Purposes as we are pleased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> appoint of our own Accords? I think there is a very great Difference in many Respects, between your <HI>Holy Days,</HI> and our occasional Services; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>' ours as well as yours require Time for their Ob∣servation.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because in our occasional Services we assume no Authority to <HI>consecrate Time</HI> at all: but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Prerogative of Heaven, where it ought to be left, in the Hands of God alone. We don't e∣steem any Return of Time more holy than other; but that alone which God himself has made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ Whereas you on the contrary consecrate stated Days in the Year, declare them to be holy, and oblige People to observe 'em in their yearly Re∣turn. But by what Authority is this done?</P>
<P N="2">2. Because the <HI>Duties</HI> we perform on these Oc∣casions, are such as GOD himself has <HI>required,</HI> as I shewed you before; whereas <HI>you</HI> consecrate Time for such Services as are <HI>no where warranted, no where precedented</HI> or <HI>allowed</HI> in the Scriptures. You can't (for Instance) pretend, that the Observation of any
<PB N="115" REF="004237_0120_10042A21AE9FE5D8" MS="y"/>
<HI>Saints-Days</HI> (much less, that the Observation of such a Number of 'em) is any where warranted in Scripture; while, on the contrary, you your self allow, that occasional <HI>Fasts</HI> and <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> are required by God himself.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because <HI>we do not</HI> (as you do) <HI>impose</HI> a new <HI>Yoke on the Neck of Christ's Disciples,</HI> instead of that which God himself has taken off. We don't <HI>ob∣serve Days and Months and Times and Years,</HI> lest the Gospel should be <HI>in vain to us,</HI> Gal. iv.10, 11. We don't revive the typical Dispensation of <HI>Holy Days,</HI> which <HI>was a shadow of Things to come, but the Body is of Christ,</HI> Col. ii.17. We can't ima∣gine any Reason, why we should value our selves upon our <HI>Liberty,</HI> by being <HI>freed from the Iewish Yoke of Bondage</HI> (Gal. v.1) and yet impose a greater Yoke upon our selves.</P>
<P N="4">4 Because <HI>we don't</HI> (as you do) <HI>practically de∣clare our selves unsatisfied with the Provision Christ has made for the thankful Remembrance of all the Instances of his redeeming Love,</HI> which he has in common bestowed upon Mankind. Christ has ap∣pointed one Day in every Week to these Purpo∣ses; he thought that sufficient, and we think so too; and can't find any Warrant or Commis¦sion given to any Man, to appoint any other. He has indeed required us, to perform religious Duties of every Kind; and consequently to take Time to perform them. We must set apart Time for spe∣cial Services, such as <HI>Fasts</HI> and <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> when his Providence on one Occasion and another calls for them. But he himself has appointed Time for the commemorating the common Benefits of his Redemption; and has given no Man Authority or Commission to appoint any other stated Times on that Account. Which may serve for Answer to <HI>page</HI> 88<HI>th</HI> of your <HI>Appeal.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="116" REF="004237_0121_10040421B144DAA0"/>5. Because <HI>we dare not</HI> (as you do) <HI>take away the Liberty</HI> God has allowed our People; and take up above <HI>half their Time</HI> in Feasts, Fasts, and <HI>Holidays</HI> of our own instituting, which he has given them for their secular Employments.</P>
<P N="6">6. Because <HI>we dare not go so far towards justify∣ing the</HI> Papists <HI>in their worshipping of</HI> Saints <HI>and</HI> An∣gels, <HI>as you seem to do,</HI> in setting apart the same Days in a Year as they do, in (I know not what) Commemoration of those Saints and Angels: Be∣cause the Scripture expresly calls the Papists Saint-Worship, <HI>the Doctrine of Devils</HI> or <HI>Demons,</HI> 1 Tim. iii.1.</P>
<P>These, Sir, are some of the Differences between your <HI>Holy Days,</HI> and our occasional Employment of Time in attendance upon special commanded Du∣ties of Religion. And these Differences will be most clear and apparent to every one, that will give himself Liberty to think; notwithstanding all your sarcastical Fleers, and notwithstanding all your attempts to make them every way parallel.</P>

<P>If these <HI>Holy Days</HI> were religious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which yet the Text says nothing of, they were appointed by <HI>Mordecai (Esth.</HI> ix.31.) the supposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man of the Book of <HI>Esther,</HI> who was, for ought we know to the contrary, as much inspired in making this Appointment, as in penning the sacred Story.

approved of that Feast. To which I reply—He knew, it was the Time when others presented thems<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves to keep the Feast at that Place.

<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose that the <HI>Feast of Dedication</HI> was ap∣pointed by the <HI>Maccabees</HI>; I yet say, it can't be prov∣ed, that our Lord Jesus Christ ever approved of it. All that can be found in the Text, to build such a Supposition upon, is these Words,—<HI>And it was at Ierusalem the Feast of Dedication, and it was Winter; and Iesus walked in the Temple in Solomon's Porch.</HI> This is all that is said about it. All the Story in your Books, of Christ's coming many Miles to ce∣lebrate this Feast, and the like, is meerly your own Imagination. How do you know, that our Lord had any more Regard to the Feast of Dedication, than to the Winter, in his walking in <HI>Solomon's Porch</HI>? It is not easily understood, why the Evangelist there mentions it's being Winter, un∣less to insinuate the Reason of Christ's walking there. Accordingly Dr. <HI>Lightfoot</HI> so understands this Text. <HI>He walked there because it was Winter, that he might get and keep himself warm.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol II. p. 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8</NOTE> — But <HI>why did not our Lord reprove the Observation of this human Holy Day</HI>? Pray, How do you know that he did not reprove it, that he did not walk in the Porch for that End? But if he did not reprove it, it might be for this Rea∣son; because it was no <HI>Holy Day</HI> at all. There is nothing in the Text that gives us any E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idence, that it was observed as a religious Feast; or that there was any Body in the Temple at that Time

And to what Purpose is it to answer the same Thing over and over again?

<P>I have taken some Pains to inquire into this Case; and have the following Account of the Matter of Fact, from a Gentleman whose Fideli∣ty and Capacity I can depend upon.
<Q>Whatever certainly Mr. <HI>Beach</HI> may pretend to in this Case, he is manifestly under a great Mistake. For tho' it be allowed, that there were in <HI>New-England</HI> two or three Lay-Ordinations (and more I never heard of) yet they don't at all affect the present Ministry, in that it can't (I think) be proved, that any now in the Ministry, derived their <HI>Commissions</HI> (as he expresses it) from such, and only such, as were so ordain∣ed. As to himself, he was ordained by Mr. <HI>Shove,</HI> and others of equal Authority; Mr. <HI>Shove</HI> was ordained by Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> and others; Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> by Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> and others; Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> by Mr. <HI>Warham</HI> and others; and Mr. <HI>Warham</HI> was episcopally ordained in <HI>England.</HI> Besides there's no Doubt but that a Succession might be found for Mr. <HI>Beach,</HI> from Mr. <HI>Blackman</HI> and Mr. <HI>Denton,</HI> who were both settled in <HI>New-haven</HI> Colony, and both before their coming to <HI>America</HI> legal Ministers in <HI>England,</HI> the one at <HI>Hallifa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and the other in <HI>Leicestershire.</HI></Q></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprizing! For that Gentleman gives me this further Account.
<Q>I have been well inform'd, that Mr <HI>Beach,</HI> since he embraced the episcopal Persuasion, has solemnly declared in the Pre∣sence of sundry Ministers, who he designed should
<PB N="122" REF="004237_0127_10042A30E4C63328"/>
be Witnesses for him, and who took a Certifi∣cate of that Declaration in his Presence, which was approv'd by himself, That <HI>he did firmly believe, that the Ministers of our Persuasion in</HI> New-England <HI>are true Ministers of Iesus Christ, and will be accepted of him accordingly.</HI></Q>
Now, Sir, turn to <HI>Page</HI> 105<HI>th</HI> of your <HI>Appeal</HI>; and think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you would like your own Reflections, if retorted upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You complain, because our People bear a</HI> vocal Part <HI>in the publick Worship. Here I can't but observe, how easily you turned off all those unanswerable Argu∣ments for this Practice, that I gave you from Mr.</HI> Baxter. (p. 94)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> is well known to have been on the Side of Nonconformity, both by his Writings and Practice. He has written largely against many of these very Things, that I am impleading. And with what Justice you so often drag him into your Service, I cannot judge, without a Sight of the Books you refer to. Indeed I place but little Con∣fidence upon any Man's Authority in a Case of this Kind: and Dr. <HI>Rule</HI> observes,
"For Mr. <HI>Bax∣ter</HI>'s Authority, we lay little Weight on it; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his own <HI>singular</HI> Opinions, which neither Party do unanimously allow".
But neither you nor I are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o proper Judges, whether the Arguments you bro't from Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> or whatever other Arguments you were pleased to advance, are fully answered, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. We have appealed to another Tribunal; and the World must judge between us. — I proved to you before from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv. that all Worship must be in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elligibly perform'd. <HI>We must pray so that our Understandings mayn't be unfruitful</HI> ver. 14. We must <HI>pray with the Spirit, and the Understanding,</HI>
<PB N="123" REF="004237_0128_10042A342FDCBB38" MS="y"/>
ver. 15. We must <HI>pray so that he who occupieth the Place of the unlearned may say Amen at our giv∣ing of Thanks; and understand what we say,</HI> ver· 16. We must <HI>pray so that others may be edified,</HI> ver. 17. And can you pretend that your Worship is intel∣ligibly performed? When all speak together, can any Body know what is said by others? Can a Stander-by say Amen at your giving of Thanks, when he knows not a Word that's spoken? Can others be edified by such Service, which they un∣derstand nothing of? How then will your <HI>Res∣ponses</HI> agree with this Directory, which was pur∣posely given to regulate our publick Worship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You allow all the People to sing together, and why does not this make your Worship unintelligible?— The</HI> Psalms <HI>you sing, are</HI> Prayers <HI>as well as</HI> Praises; <HI>and if all the People may sing them, it's certain all the People may say them, for singing and saying are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two different Modes of speaking.</HI> (p. 94, 95)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>How often must you be told, that <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Singing</HI> are two very different Parts of publick Worship, to be perform'd for different Purposes, and in a different Manner, that there is no just arguing from the one to the other? <HI>Singing</HI> does from it's very Nature imply an audible lifting up the Voice; and they that do not <HI>sing</HI> with an audible Voice, don't sing at all. Whereas <HI>Praying</HI> does not absolutely imply any more, than the lifting our Hearts and Desires to God; and may be per∣form'd acceptably without any Voice at all. And the whole Congregation may unite in <HI>Prayer,</HI> when there is but one Voice heard; but none of the Congregation can join in <HI>Singing,</HI> without united Voices as well as Affections▪ To which I may
<PB N="124" REF="004237_0129_10042A3A50F04DC0"/>
add, that publick <HI>Singing</HI> is every where exempli∣fied in Scripture as being perform'd with the u∣nited Voices of the Congregation; but we have not one Example of publick <HI>Prayer</HI> thus performed. You have not a Precept or an Example in the whole Bible for your Responses; or for the People's bearing an audible vocal Part in the publick <HI>Pray∣ers.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>The Scripture directs us to join our Voices, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only in</HI> Singing, <HI>but in saying our</HI> Prayers <HI>and</HI> Praise. 2 <HI>Chron</HI> vii.3. All the Children of Isra∣el bowed themselves with their Faces to the Ground upon the Pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord saying, For he is good, for his Mercy endureth for ever. <HI>So Acts</HI> iv.24 They all li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up their Voices with one Accord in Prayer. <HI>They did not sing, but said,</HI> Lord thou art good <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (p. 96.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the first of these Texts, it's only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Instance of the People's uniting their Voices in <HI>Singing</HI>: as appears from 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xvi.41, 42. where we find that <HI>Heman, Ieduthun</HI> and others were appointed to lead the Choir in performing this very Service; which was to be performed not only with the united Voices of the Congregation, but with Trumpets, and Cymbals, and musical Instruments. And the very foregoing Chapter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a particular Account of a long publick <HI>Prayer</HI> pro∣nounced by <HI>Solomon</HI>▪ wherein no other of the Con∣gregation bare any vocal Part at all. So that thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> makes nothing to your Purpose.</P>
<P>The second of these Texts, as it is rendred in our Translation, does indeed seem to favour your Cause. But if the Original be viewed, it will be found to be as impertinently urged as the other was. In the Original it is, <HI>They lifted up a Voice to
<PB N="125" REF="004237_0130_10042A3D4585BDF8" MS="y"/>
God with one Heart.</HI> The Relative (<HI>Their</HI>) which gives the wrong Turn to our Thoughts, is not found in the Greek Text; nor has it any Claim to stand in the English, but from the Authority of the <HI>Translators</HI> All that can be prov'd from this Text is, that they were heartily united in their Address to God: but there is not a Word of their using united Voices in their making that Address; No∣thing of there being more than one Voice used in it. Much less is there any Thing of <HI>ALL lifting up their Voices,</HI> as you are pleased to represent it, very different both from the Original and our Translation. — Upon the whole, I even chal∣lenge you to find any Thing in Scripture, like your <HI>Responses</HI> in <HI>Prayer,</HI> or any such unintelligible Me∣thod of praying to God as is found among you, when you all lift up your Voices together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>There is no Difficulty in this Matter. A Stran∣ger, if he will but use a Book, or stand near to one who does, may read, or hear intelligibly every Sentence.</HI> (p. 95.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Apostle directs to the Performance of this Duty in such a Manner, that he that Occupi∣eth the Room of the unlearned may say Amen, and understand what you say; and be edified with your Prayers, 1. <HI>Cor</HI> xiv.16, 17. as I observed before. But how can an unlearned Person that can't read, be helped by your Books to understand what you say, be edified by it, or say <HI>Amen</HI> to it. when the united Voices of the Congregation make it a confused and an unintelligible Sound? I think there is nothing more certain, than that your Prac∣tice in this Case is directly opposite to this Directory of the Apostle, make what Apologies you can in Favour of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Before I conclude, I must return you my hearty Thanks for your most charitable Prayer for me in the Conclusion You pray that</HI> the Blessing of many Souls ready to perish may come upon me, <HI>that</HI> these may be my Crown and Rejoycing in the Day of the Lord Jesus. <HI>But how strangely inconsistent is this with the rest of your Book, that throughout represents the Way that I am leading Souls in, as the certain Road to Hell? My Worship you say is</HI> vain; <HI>my Doctrine is</HI> Arminianism; <HI>and my Discipline</HI> none at all. (p. 105.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' I think I have proved, that all hu∣man Inventions and Impositions in the Worship of God are <HI>vain Worship</HI>; yet I hope I have never said, that all the Worship in the Church of <HI>England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s vain Worship.</HI> I never denied, but that they have such Worship among them, as is not of <HI>human Invention.</HI> — And tho' I think the <HI>Arminians</HI> very much mistaken in the five Points debated between them and us; yet I never determined their Doc∣trines to be so subversive of the Fundamentals of Christianity, as to render an <HI>Arminian</HI> uncapable of Salvation. But however, I may apply here what Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> says concerning the <HI>Popish</HI> Er∣rors; "The holding these Errors, though it did not <HI>merit,</HI> might yet <HI>occasion</HI> Damnation.— "Tho' a <HI>godly</HI> Man might be saved <HI>with</HI> these Errors; yet <HI>by means</HI> of them many are made <HI>vicious,</HI> and so damned: <HI>By</HI> them, I say, though not <HI>for</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. —"Besides, though the <HI>Matter</HI> of an Error may be only something profitable, not necessary, yet the <HI>Neglect</HI> of it may be a <HI>damnable Sin.</HI> — "Lastly, the erring from some <HI>profitable,</HI> tho' <HI>lesser</HI> Truth, may dispose a Man to Error in <HI>greater</HI> Matter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>As I said before, so I again say, that there may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Party, that are Fellow Members
<PB N="127" REF="004237_0132_10042A419B9A21B0" MS="y"/>
of the mystical Body of Christ, who should live in Love and Peace, and not <HI>fall out by the Way; for they are Brethren.</HI> We agree in the Profession of <HI>one Lord, one Faith, and one Baptism</HI>; tho' we don't agree in one Ritual, and one Form of Worship and Discipline. I can't but think, that in the de∣bated Points you are much in the wrong: but I don't charge you with <HI>damnable Heresies,</HI> or funda∣mental Errors. I dare not limit the Mercies of God to any Party, since we are all liable to Mis∣take and Error, while cloathed with Mortality. I hope such a Spirit of <HI>Bigotry</HI> will yet be confined to it's ancient Limits; and remain the Peculiarity of <HI>High-Church.</HI> Let them, if they please, damn all the Protestant Churches, but themselves. Let them determine concerning all who want their Form of Episcopacy, that they have no Ministry, no Ordinances, nor ordinary Means of Salvation; and must at best be left to the uncovenanted Mer∣cies of God. — But I, for my Part, will not only wish, but hope well, as to all those of every Party, that appear to <HI>love our Lord Iesus Christ in Sincerity</HI>; tho' I should think them mistaken in many Particu∣lars. And from this charitable Sentiment of you, Sir, I yet pray for a Blessing on your Person and Labours; and hope to meet you, where there will be a happy Consort and Agreement, in <HI>Anthems and Hallelujahs, to Him that sits on the Throne and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</HI></P>
