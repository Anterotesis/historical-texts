<HEAD>The Epistle Dedicatory. To His EXCELLENCY, Joseph Dudley, <HI>Esqr.</HI> Captain General and Governour in Chief of the Province of <HI>Massa∣chusetts-Bay</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHen I was by the <HI>Repre∣sentatives</HI> of this <HI>Province</HI> in the last <HI>General Assem∣bly</HI> desired to Preach on the Day S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated for the <HI>Election</HI> of <HI>Counsel∣lors,</HI> it was hoped that your <HI>Excellency</HI> might have been with us before that time. Since you could not hear, I am willing you should see (if you shall think it worth your Perusal) what I then delivered, not doubting but that you will <HI>Seek the Wealth of your People,</HI> who are dear to Christ, and by the Letters you were pleased to send to me when in <HI>England,</HI> I perceive that they are so to you.</P>
<P>In the first place I Congratulate your safe Arival to your <HI>Country,</HI> and to your Desirable Relations, after so long an ab∣sence. A mercy which doubtless you
<PB REF="001076_0003_0FAFDEDBB5F02E88"/>
have Prayed to God for many an hundred time. Now then let your <HI>Excellency</HI> give me leave to speak freely to you, &amp; to say, That our Holy Lord Jesus Christ expects much from you. For He has trusted you with <HI>Five Talents,</HI> for every one of which you know Sir, that you must be accoun∣table to Him who has given them to you. He has blessed you with rare accomplish∣ments both natural and acquired; &amp; has now put into your hands a <HI>Talent</HI> of Po∣wer and Authority, as that there is no Person in all <HI>New England,</HI> so advantaged to Serve and Honour Christ, by promo∣ting the Welfare of these His Churches, as you are. The Providence of God has been wonderful towards you▪ In some Remarkables you have been like <HI>Ioseph.</HI> Let me pray you to imitate <HI>Ioseph,</HI> not only in Seeking the good of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se under your Government, as He did; but in a perfect forgetting whatever may have seemed grievous unto you. Nor do I speak this, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I believed you needed an Exci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation thereunto. You have (I am well assured) that <HI>Greatness of Soul in you,</HI> as to disdain any thought of revenge. If a Noble Roman when advanced to great Ho∣nour
<PB REF="001076_0004_0FAFDEDC76C95C30"/>
could say to his mortal Enemy, <HI>jam Evasisti,</HI> how much more does such a greatness and generosity of Spirit become a Christian?</P>
<P>Your Honourable Father (whose Me∣mory is blessed) has a lasting Monument Erected for him in <HI>New-Englands Memori∣al</HI>; wherein 'tis truly affirmed of Him, that <HI>He was a principal Founder and Pillar of the Colony of the</HI> Massachusetts, <HI>and that He was a Nursing Father to these Churches of Christ; one that loved the true Christian Reli∣gion, &amp; the pure Worship of God, &amp; Cherished as in his Bosome all Godly Ministers &amp; Christi∣ans. He was exact in the practice of Piety, in his Person &amp; Family all his life. He lived de∣sired &amp; dyed lamented by all Good men.</HI> This and more is spoken concerning Him in the Book mentioned. And a great deal more might be, &amp; is related of his Exemplary Piety in the <HI>Church History of New Eng∣land,</HI> newly Printed at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Now Sir, since I know not what better wish to conclude with, I earnestly pray to God, that you may be such a <HI>Governour</HI> to this people as your Eminent Father was in the former Generation. So I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Much Honoured,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it was at your desire that I have Published the <HI>Sermon</HI> preached on this last <HI>Election Day.</HI> So that you &amp; others may see that I am not alone in the <HI>Advice</HI> that has been set be∣fore you, Respecting the <HI>Recommendation, of the Order of the Gospel,</HI> professed &amp; practi∣sed in these Churches, as declared in our <HI>Platform of Church Discipline,</HI> which is that whereby <HI>New England</HI> has been distingui∣shed from all other <HI>Plantations,</HI> and that so every word may be Established by two witnesses, I am willing to reinforce it with some passages, which I find in a large Let∣ter sent to the <HI>Representatives,</HI> in a former <HI>General Assembly</HI>▪ by that Reverend man of God Mr. <HI>Higginson,</HI> who is the most a∣ged Minister of Christ surviving among us.</P>
<P>For when the two most aged Ministers in the Country, left in the Hands of the
<PB REF="001076_0006_0FAFDEDEB6CB86E0"/>
Churches not long since a <HI>Testimony</HI> wherein were these words.</P>
<P><HI>Concerning all sinful attempts to overturn the</HI> Order of the Gospel <HI>hitherto upheld in the Churches of</HI> New-England, <HI>and to spoil that Glorious Work of God which we have seen Him doing with a</HI> Series <HI>of</HI> Remarka∣ble Providence, <HI>in Erecting such</HI> Congre∣gational <HI>Churches, we would now bear our</HI> Testimony, <HI>That they are doubtless displea∣sing to our Lord Iesus Christ, who</HI> Walks in the midst of these Golden Candlesticks, <HI>and they will prove bitterness in the latter end.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Representatives</HI> of the <HI>General As∣sembly</HI> then Sitting did express so much concern for the Churches, as to Vote their <HI>Thanks</HI> should be rendred unto those Re∣verend Persons for this their faithful <HI>Te∣stimony.</HI> At which time also one of them, (namely Mr. <HI>Higginson</HI>) did in a Letter, all drawn up with his own hand recom∣mend that matter which is in the Sermon emitted here with again proposed. In which Letter are the following words.</P>
<P><HI>I look upon it as my Duty, in a few Lines (that may not be mistaken) to Declare unto your selves,</HI> That I did and do own that
<PB REF="001076_0007_0FAFDEDF765608C0"/>
Testimony [<HI>above mentioned</HI>] as my own Act and Deed, <HI>and also to give an Account of my Reasons for my so doing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First, Because I desire to be found among the number of the</HI> Witnesses <HI>of our Lord Iesus Christ, who said of Himself,</HI> Joh. 18 37. For this end was I born, &amp; for this cause came I into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth, <HI>and Act.</HI> 1.8. Ye shall be wit∣nesses unto me. <HI>Now</HI> I believe with my heart, and do confess with my mouth; <HI>That the</HI> Platform of Discipline (<HI>for the substance, end and scope thereof) doth contain such a part of the Truth of Christ relating to his Kingdom, and the Order of His Churches that I dare not but bear witness unto it, and against any that shall Rise up in opposition thereunto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Because I desire to be found amongst the Number of the Followers of those Holy men of God who composed it, who were our Fathers and Elders, and who lived and dyed in the practice of the same Truth, and who yet speak to us from the Dead,</HI> Be you <HI>Followers of us, as we followed Christ.</HI> 1 Cor. 11.1.</P>
<P><HI>Now for a Conclusion (saith he) Give me leave I beseech you to propound it to your</HI> Seri∣ous Consideration, <HI>whether your selves as</HI> Re∣presentatives
<PB REF="001076_0008_0FAFDEE03A4071F0"/>
<HI>of the Country, in this</HI> Hour of Temptation, <HI>be not called of God to give forth your own</HI> Testimony <HI>to the</HI> Platform of Dis∣cipline, <HI>and against such</HI> Innovations <HI>as be∣gin to appear in</HI> New England <HI>now in these Days: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n doing of which, you will be follow∣ers of the</HI> General Courts <HI>that have been be∣fore you, from the</HI> Beginning <HI>When the</HI> Platform of Discipline <HI>was first published by the Synod in the year</HI> 1648. <HI>It was solemnly owned by the</HI> General Court, <HI>who added their</HI> Attestation <HI>to it, &amp; recom∣mended it to all the Churches as agreeable to the Word of God, and as a</HI> Directory <HI>of our Profession and Practice in point of</HI> Church Order. <HI>If some such thing should be done at this Court, you will approve your selves Follow∣ers of the</HI> General Courts <HI>that have gone be∣fore you, &amp; that you mind the things of Christ, as well as your own things of a civil nature, I am perswaded it will be a Service accepta∣ble to God, honourable to your selves, and a matter of</HI> joy to all the good people of the Land <HI>&amp; a good Example to Posterity for all, time to come. Consider whether it may not be very</HI> useful, <HI>if not</HI> needful <HI>at this juncture of time for the Honourable Court to Order the Reprinting and Publishing the</HI> Platform o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Discipline, <HI>with the General Courts Attesta¦tion
<PB REF="001076_0009_0FAFDEE0F5B51988"/>
to it at the first, and your own Attestati∣on to it now.</HI> Thus that Reverend Person.</P>
<P>I cannot but rejoyce in that he has left such a <HI>Faithful Testimony</HI> now when he is just going to a better World, by which <HI>being Dead he will yet speak.</HI> I likewise re∣joyce in that a whole <HI>Association</HI> of Faith∣ful Ministers of the Lord have lately a∣greed to Encourage the <HI>Republication</HI> of the <HI>Platform of Church Discipline,</HI> as also the <HI>Result</HI> of our other <HI>Synods.</HI></P>
<P>It is much more a matter of joy, that God has inclined your hearts who are the <HI>Representatives</HI> of this <HI>Province</HI> with a great Unanimity to concur in Voting the Re∣printing of those <HI>Synods.</HI> I hope it is a to∣ken for good, and a sign that the Lord will not destroy <HI>New England,</HI> neither cast them from His presence <HI>as yet</HI>▪ 2 King. 13 23. Our Fathers were not ashamed to own their Re∣ligion. The <HI>General Court</HI> of this <HI>Colony</HI> in the year 1660. Concurred in an <HI>Address</HI> to K. <HI>Charles</HI> II. In which they declare the Rea∣sons of their coming into this Wilderness, &amp; that it was purely with respect to <HI>the Or¦der of the Gospel.</HI> It will be good for us to be <HI>Established in the present Truth</HI>; &amp; that Po∣sterity should see that what their Fathers
<PB REF="001076_0010_0FAFDEE25D2F9E60"/>
did profess and practice, was according to the Scriptures. We know not what hours of Temptation may overtake us, or those that shall come after us.</P>
<P>The never enough lamented Death of our late King of glorious memory, has made way for great calamities to break in upon the <HI>Protestant Churches.</HI> If they are in a flame, will not some of those sparks fly over to <HI>New England? New England</HI> could not have lost a greater friend. How often have I heard very kind expressions respecting His Subjects in <HI>New England</HI> proceed out of that Royal mouth, which I cannot now think of without bleeding sorrow. It was doubtless from a singular favour which His <HI>Majesty</HI> had for His Subjects in this <HI>Pro∣vince,</HI> that He was graciously pleased to Commission one whose Birth and Educa∣tion has been amonst us, and whose Ho∣nourable Father many years since Sustain∣ed the like Relation, to be our <HI>Governour.</HI></P>
<P>We have great cause to acknowledge the Royal favour of Her present <HI>Majesty,</HI> Queen <HI>Anne</HI> in Renewing a Commission for the Government of this Province to be continued in the same hand in which His late Majesty had left it. And it is mat∣ter
<PB REF="001076_0011_0FAFDEE275E93560"/>
of great Thankfulness to God that there is now on the Throne a <HI>Protestant Princess,</HI> who has Emitted a Proclamation against Immorality &amp; Irreligion, &amp; has shewed a singular tenderness to Her Subjects, tho' differing in their sentiments as to circum∣stantials in Religion. A Queen on the <HI>English</HI> Throne was an happy instrument of bring∣ing down the pond <HI>Spaniard.</HI> May Her present <HI>Britanick Majesty</HI> humble the pride of <HI>France,</HI> all <HI>Europe</HI> will have cause of joy.</P>
<P>As for what concerns this poor Coun∣try: If the <HI>King of Heaven</HI> will take us under His Divine Protection▪ we need not fear tho' the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers be troubled, and the mountains shake with the swelli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g thereof. The way to ingage him to be for us, is not to desert His Cause▪ or to be either asha∣med or afraid in the most publick manner to assert His Truth, but rather to do as those who have g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne before us have done, esp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cially those who have taught us the Word of God, whose Faith we ought to follow.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>COncerning the Penm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of this porti∣on of Scripture, there are Various Conjectures. It is gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally thought that it was written <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <HI>Modecai.</HI> Only <HI>Philo Iudaeus</HI> tells us that <HI>Ioa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>him</HI> a Son of the high Priest wrote this book at the desire of <HI>Mordecai.</HI> It is not necessary for us to know who was the Author, as long as we know that whoever it were, he was divinely &amp; so infallibly inspired in what he delivered unto us. The Church of the old Testament to whom were committed the Oracles of God, did with great care preserve them. And with them this book was not only esteemed as Sacred, but they had a more then ordinary veneration for it. It is (as indeed the greatest part of the Scripture is) Historical. We have therein an account of
<PB N="2" REF="001076_0013_0FAFDEE3F793BCC8"/>
as great a distress, and as wonderful a delive∣rance of the Church of God, as ever hapned in any age of the World; which came to pass in the days of <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> one of the Kings of <HI>Persia:</HI> but which of those Kings is controverted: <HI>Aha∣sureus</HI> is a Persian word, signifying one that has Majesty. The dignity of the person is signified thereby, but it is not a proper name to distinguish one man from another. As <HI>Pharaoh</HI> was a common name to all the Kings of Egypt, and <HI>Caesar</HI> to the Roman Emperors, so was <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> to the Kings of the <HI>Medes</HI>; and of such Persian Kings as were of the <HI>Median</HI> blood. But there are chiefly two persons concerned in the Histo∣ry of this Book, who were near Relations, both of them good, and at last great ones. One was <HI>Esther</HI> made a Queen of <HI>Persia,</HI> who was born for the welfare of her People. The Jews there∣fore call this Book <HI>Megillath Esther,</HI> the <HI>Volumn of Esther,</HI> because she is the principal person spoken of in it. The other great and good per∣son treated of therein is <HI>Mordecai</HI> the Jew. Of whom three particulars are noted in this verse. (1) His advancement, <HI>He was next unto the King. i. e.</HI> next in Power and Authority. He was under the King the chief Ruler. (2) Here is noted the Esteem which he had with them that were both his own and also the Lords people: He was <HI>great among them, i. e</HI> greatly esteemed and honoured by them. <HI>And accepted of the Multitude of his brethren.</HI> Commonly if
<PB N="3" REF="001076_0014_0FAFDEE4B93FC6E8"/>
a man is advanced he is envied of his brethren It was not so with him; his brethren rejoyced at his prosperity. (3) We have his behaviour under his Advancement, in the words before us to insist on. He did as became one in so pub∣lick a station. He shewed that he was a man of a Publick Spirit. The providence of God put into his hand a great opportunity to ad∣vantage himself, as to his own secular Interests, but his heart was rather set upon promoting the welfare of his people. He <HI>sought good for them,</HI> as the Original carries it. <HI>i. e.</HI> He endeavoured both by word and deeds to promove those things which would be for their good. And this is written in the Book of God to the everlasting renown of <HI>Mordecai,</HI> and for the instruction of others that shall read or hear of it.</P>
<P>The Doctrine which the words afford unto us, is,</P>
<P>That as Rulers ought to be of a Publick Spirit, Seeking the Welfare of their People, so when they are such, it will be to their lasting Renown</P>
<P>The D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctrine before us may be confirmed in three Propositions.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>Men ought to be of Publick Spirits▪</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it true (as in the next Proposition we shall shew) such a Spirit is a Grace requisite in some men above others. Nevertheless, it is that which every man should have. This is an All
<PB N="4" REF="001076_0015_0FAFDEE575D24E18"/>
concerning Truth. The Commandment which says, <HI>Love thy Neighbour as thy self,</HI> enjoyns this on every man. Therefore dos the Scripture say, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10 24 <HI>Let no man seek his own,</HI> that is to say, not that only, <HI>but every mans a∣nothers wealth</HI> So then every man ought to be of a Publick Spirit. No man may be, and no good man is under the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minion of <HI>Cains</HI> Spi∣rit, who said, <HI>Am I my brothers keeper</HI>? Yes. Every man should be concerned for his brothers preservation and prosperity.</P>
<P>This will appear if we consider what things are implied in a Publick Spirit.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Men ought to be affected with other mens Condition, and especially with Publick concerns as if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey were their own.</HI> Thats one thing implyed in a Publick Spirit. Where there is such a spi∣rit, there is a sympath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zing with others: and that ought to be. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12 15 <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep.</HI> The contrary to this argues a private, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fish spi∣rit. When if a man is in prosperity hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf, he cares not who is in misery: If he has plenty he cares not who has poverty. The holy Apostle was of another spirit, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11 29 <HI>Who is weak, and I am not week? who is offended, and I burn not.</HI> Especially we should be concerned for the Publick Interest. <HI>Ier.</HI> 22 10 <HI>Weep ye not for the dead, but weep for him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native Coun∣try.</HI> That is, dont weep so much for the loss
<PB N="5" REF="001076_0016_0FAFDEE635DE4C68"/>
of your particular friends, as for the Publick Calamity which is coming on the Nation: In this did our Saviour Christ give the greatest In∣stance of a publick Spirit: He shewed more concernedness for the misery of others, than for his own particular sorrows, though they were great∣er than ever any mans, when he said to the daughters of Jerusalem, <HI>Weep not for me, but weep for your selves and for your Children, Luk</HI> 23.28. And when he considered what was coming on that City, He wept over it, because they knew not the things that concerned their peace, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19 41. Most of all the concernments of the Church of God should ly near to our hearts. <HI>Vriah</HI> shewed that a pious and publick Spirit ruled in him, when he had more regard to the condition of the Lords People, and of the Ark of God, than to his own domestick concerns. So <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was much affected and affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted when he heard that in Jerusalem they were in great distress. And the holy Penman of the 137. Psalm, <HI>preferred Ierusalem above his chiefest joy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Men ought to, and a Publick Spirited man will, not only desire but Endeavour the welfare of others, especially of the Publick Interest.</HI> This also is implyed in <HI>Seeking. Mordecai sought</HI> the wealth of his people, that is to say, he endea∣voured all that was in him to promote the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r welfare. The like is spoken concerning <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣miah</HI> the Governour of Iudea, when that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was made a Province, &amp; a Governour set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver
<PB N="6" REF="001076_0017_0FAFDEE6F6FB0320"/>
them by the King He was <HI>a man that sought the welfare of the Children of Israel, Neh</HI> 2 10. He endeavoured it with all his might. Saying and wishing without real endeavours and deeds, is not seeking. If a man seeth his brother na∣ked or destitute of daily food, and shall say to him, be thou warmed, and filled, but shall do nothing for him, what dos it profit, <HI>Iam</HI> 2.15, 16. So if a man shall pretend that he wish∣eth well to the publick Interest, but dos no way endeavour the promotion of it, he is not a true seeker of it. A Publick Spirited man will im∣prove whatever Interest he has in endeavours to promote the publick good. He will im∣prove what Interest he has in Heaven for that end, by praying, and stirring up others to pray. By this did <HI>Abraham</HI> shew a publick Spirit, in his Intercessions with God for his perishing Neigh∣bours. So did <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> and <HI>Samuel,</HI> and all the holy Prophets and the godly Kings of <HI>Iu∣dah,</HI> by fervent prayers to God endeavour the welfare of their people. Or, if he has a great Interest with men on earth, he that is of a pub∣lick Spirit, will improve it for the benefit of o∣thers and not of himself only; especially if he has a singular interest in great ones, in whose power it is to promote the welfare of many. The Prophet <HI>Elisha</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this manifested his rea∣diness to endeavour ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers welfare. He said to one, 2 K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g 4 13. <HI>What is to be done for thee, woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st thou be spoken for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the King.</HI>

Thus did <HI>Esther</HI> shew a publick spirit in re∣questing the King in whose heart she had the greatest interest, to be kind to her people. So <HI>Mordecai</HI> in this way sought the wealth of his people; it is therefore said in the next words, that he did <HI>speak peace</HI> to <HI>all his Seed.</HI> When any of them resorted to him, notwithstanding his advancement, he received them with much courtesie and kindness; but the words may be read thus, <HI>Seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace</HI> for <HI>his Seed,</HI> that is for his Coun∣try men who were of the same blood with him. Then the meaning of the words is, that he improved his interest in the King and Court of <HI>Persia</HI> for the good of those that were both his and the Lords people. It is noted in the first verse of this Chapter, that the King laid a Tribute on all his Subjects, both on the Conti∣nent and in the Islands; which probably was by the advice of <HI>Mordecai:</HI> only some Writers have said, that <HI>Mordecai</HI> prevailed with the King not to impose that Tribute on his <HI>Iewish</HI> Subjects.</P>

<P N="1">1.

Hence the <HI>Hebrews</HI> call a Ruler by the name of <HI>Adon</HI> from <HI>Eden,</HI> which signifies a <HI>Basis</HI> or Foundation. So the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> If the Foundation is solid, the Su∣perstructure may stand, but if that be sandy or rotten, all falls to ruin. Hence also they are compared to <HI>Corner-stones.</HI> Zech. 10.4 <HI>Out of him came forth the Corner,</HI> that is the Ruler. The main stress of the Building lies on the Corner-stones; remove those and the House cannot stand Hence also <HI>Rulers</HI> are compared to <HI>Pillars</HI>; When <HI>Saul</HI> was chief in Govern∣ment, he granted Commissions to very Ungod∣ly men, he loved to prefer such; but when the Government came into <HI>Davids</HI> hand, he was all for preferring good men, and by that means he saved the State from ruin: He therefore spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks, as in Psal 75.3. <HI>The Earth and all the Inhabi∣tants thereof are dissolved.</HI> I <HI>bear up the Pillars of it.</HI> The safety of an house depends on the pil∣lars of it; if they fall all is in danger.</P>

It is said, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.12. that <HI>in Iudah things went well</HI>; they reformed what had been amiss among them, and were the only people in all the world at that time, among whom true Religion was found, and then things went well with them; The Providence of God smiled upon them, so that their broken State was recruited; but if a people once degenerate as to their Religi∣on, then it is wont to go ill with them Judg. 5.8. <HI>They chose new gods, then wars were in the Gates,</HI> This truth was of old Preached in a <HI>General

And in that Chapter it is ob∣served, that <HI>for a long season Israel had been with∣out the true God, and without a teaching Priest, and without the Law, and in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, for God did vex them with all adversity.</HI> Now then it is very much with Rulers to make and to keep their people religious. They may do much that way by their Example; and they ought to be to those under them patterns, not only of moral ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue, but of true piety; they should excel others in goodness as much as they do in power. It was excellently spoken by <HI>Cyrus</HI> (tho' an Heathen Prince) that <HI>that man is not worthy to Rule, that is not more vertuous than the most of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se over whom he does Command</HI> A Great man if he is a good man, will by his Ex∣ample do a great deal of good; as on the o∣ther hand if he is a vicious man, his example will be pernicious to many: When <HI>Rehoboam</HI> forsook the Law of the Lord, <HI>all Israel</HI> did so with him. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 12.1.

I have sometimes been affected in reading the Martyr, <HI>Ridley</HI> his pathetical Lamentation for that Apo∣stasy.

Peoples Liberty and Property. They are the very Sinews of the body Politick. Next to Religion, the happiness of a People consists in Civil Liberties. The Jewish Writers have a Celebrated saying among them, <HI>That if the Sea were Ink, and the Heavens Parchment both would not be enough to Write down the Praises which are due to God for Liberty.</HI> Now civil Liberties are secured by the Establishment of Righteous Laws for that end. That which the <HI>Legislative Pow∣er</HI> ought to aim at is not so much the Interest of a particular man, as of the people in gene∣ral. The light of nature says, that <HI>Salus populi est Suprema laex,</HI> the safety of the People is the Supreme Law. Nor ought there to be any Law which shall be really prejudicial thereun∣to. Among the <HI>Venetians</HI> if any proposal is offered, the first E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiry, is, will this which is proposed be for the welfare of the Republick? So it should be in the establishment of Laws, but such Laws cannot be without the concur∣rance of the Rulers of a People.

than to have them spoken of in any other Book. I shall mention but two particulars, which will clear and confirm the Truth now before us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They that seek the Wealth of their People, are usually much Loved and Honoured whilest they Live, and much more after they are dead.</HI> It is too true, that there is wicked Ingratitude in the Hearts of men, whence Publick Bene∣factors have been ill rewarded by those whom they have laid under the greatest obligations.

Nevertheless, natural Conscience has that power in men that except prejudice prevail against reason, they cannot but value those that have sought the publick Interest. The Jews looked upon such as worthy of honour. They said concerning the Centurion, <HI>He is worthy, for he loveth our Nation, and has built us a Synagogue, Luk</HI> 7 4, 5. The Jewish Writers sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerning one of their high Priests whose nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was <HI>Simon,</HI> that he sought the Good of his Nation in such wise, as that his Authority and Honour pleased them well, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>his honourable name was therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enowned to the End of the World</HI> Yea, and the Gentiles had those in high esteem who had sought the weal of their Country. The famous

And it was counted an honour to their Kings themselves, to be styled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>benefactors.</HI> Some such have been Loved so as that others have been willing to lay down their lives for them Although such Instances have been rare, yet some such there have been.

their lives to save their Country. The people there had dealt babarously with the Ambassa∣dors of <HI>Darius Histaspis</HI> the King of <HI>Persia</HI> (supposed to be that <HI>Ahasuerus</HI> spoken of in the Book of <HI>Esther</HI>) which inraged the <HI>Persians</HI> against them, so that they resolved to destroy that City. Thereupon they called a <HI>General Assembly,</HI> and proposal was made whether there was any man that would dy to save <HI>Spartae</HI> from destruction. Two noble young men readily offered themselves to be made a Sacri∣fice to the wrath of <HI>Persia,</HI> and accordingly went to the Emperor signifying that they came to offer their lives to appease his anger for the wrong done by their City to his Ambassadors, praying that their people might be spared. <HI>Themistocles</HI> is famous on the like account. His people dealt very injuriously with him notwith∣standing singular services he had done for them, so that he was forced to remove into another Land. There were great offers made to him, in case he would appear in Hostility against his Country: but rather than do so he chose to dy. That was a brave rare Spirit in him, and made him honourable to Posterity. Serviceable and publick Spirited men, such as have sought the weal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of their people, have not only lived de∣sired, (as <HI>Mordecai</HI> in the Text before us did) but they have dyed lamented.

his people both in <HI>Temporals</HI> and in <HI>Spirituals,</HI> and he was greatly loved and honoured both living and dying 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32 33. <HI>They buried him in the chiefest of the Sepulchres of the Sons of David, and all Iudah and the Inhabitants of Ie∣rusalem did him honour at his death.</HI> The like to this is noted concerning <HI>Ieh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jada</HI> the Priest. <HI>They buried him among the Kings because he had done Good in Israel, both towards God, and towards his House,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 24.16. <HI>Iosiah</HI> was ano∣ther that set himself with all his might to seek the wealth of his People. And how did all good men Lament and their hearts bleed over his Grave? It was the greatest Mourning that ever was known among the Jews, so that it grew into a proverb, <HI>as the Mourning of Hadra∣drimon in the Valley of Megiddon Zech</HI> 12.11. That is as the Mourning for <HI>Iosiah</HI> who was slain at <HI>Hadradimmon,</HI> which was a Town in the valley of <HI>Megiddon</HI> And a long time after <HI>in their Lamentations,</HI> that is, in their funeral Elegies on other persons, they would drop some tears over <HI>Iosiahs</HI> Grave. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 35 25. Many other Instances there are in Scripture confirming the great Truth before us, which I omit. Histories also do abundantly declare it. Never was there man in the Roman Em∣pire whose Life was so much desired and his death Lamented by all good men as that of the great <HI>Constantine,</HI> who was the greatest blessing to the Empire that ever it enjoyed in

any one man I shall only add, that we have seen a recent and Royal instance of this, in our late QUEEN of glorious Memory who (like another Queen <HI>Esther</HI>) sought the welfare of her People. And was resolved, if the Lord had continued her life but a while longer, to have used her utmost endeavours towards the effecting of two things, which had it been done the Nation would have been happy, <HI>viz.</HI> A Reformation of manners, and an Union a∣mong al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sincere Protestants, and never was there a Queen in <HI>England,</HI> that lived more desired or that dyed more Lamented. And as they that have been great blessings to the World are usually honoured whilest they Live, so much more after they are Dead. Eminent men whilst living are objects of much envy, but they are less so when dead. —<HI>Livor post fata quiefcit.</HI> Some that would run out against <HI>Moses</HI> whilst alive, were ready to worship him after he was dead. The <HI>Iews</HI> would build the Tombs of the dead Prophets, and garnish the Sepulchres of the Righteous, who when living were little regarded by them. Mat. 23 29. There has through the subtilty of Satan been a sinful ex∣cess in this respect. The Gentiles did Idolize their great men after their death.

<P>The liberty which you have this day to Choose who shall be the Governours <HI>Assist∣ants,</HI> is a great and singular priviledge. No other Plantation has the like. Now to use it well is the most probable way to have it continued. There are those that envy our happiness in this respect. The wicked men that sollicited to have our <HI>former Charter</HI> taken from us, are endeavouring that our <HI>Present Charter</HI> should be taken from us also. We may by two things provoke the Lord to suf∣fer them to prevail; one is by unthankfulness for so great a mercy. By despising it, as if so great priviledges as those our present <HI>Charter</HI> confirms to us were of no value. If the Lord should be provoked to take them from us, they will be thought valuable by those that have ve∣ry sinfully slighted and cast contempt on them. An Eminent man (since gone to a better world) wrote me, that if the people in <HI>New-England</HI>

were not thankful for the priviledges of their present <HI>Charter,</HI> all their Friends in <HI>En∣gland</HI> would think them unworthy of more, and be discouraged from being concerned in their behalf. The other evil which will endanger the loss of them is the not using our priviledges well. If when a people may Choose good men that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll seek their Welfare to be their Rulers, they will have others rather, it is just with God to punish them accordingly.

<Q>I (said he) know the people of <HI>New-England</HI> very well; I was once there, I know they are a weak peo∣ple and full of humors. Nevertheless they are a people that belong to God: And therefore let me pray your Lordship to be kind to them, &amp; the God of Heaven will reward you for it</Q>
So let me say to Counsellors, to Ministers, to Representatives, &amp; to others also, do all that you can to promote the Wel∣fare of the dear people in <HI>New England,</HI> because many of them are dear to God, who has purchased them with his own blood: Then Christ will take what you do to them as done to himself. All the men in the world will believe this to be true, in that day which is at hand, when we shall all see Jesus Christ the Son of God sitting on the Throne of his Glory, and hear him pronounce those words, with which I conclude. Mat 25 40. <HI>Verily inasmuch as you have done it to these my Brethren, you have done it unto me.</HI></P>

<P>And the Lord said, if I find in <HI>Sodom</HI> fifty Righteous within the City, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter we have an account of three men that came to <HI>Abraham</HI> when he dwelt in the Plains of <HI>Mamre</HI>; which men were indeed Angels, only called men, be∣cause they did appear in Humane Shape; <HI>Abraham</HI> supposing them to be Travellers, cour∣teously invited them to refresh themselves with him; and so did as the Apostle speak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Entertain Angels at unawares.</HI> He applied himself to one above the rest; the reason of his doing so is not mentioned, but probably he observed that the other Angels did show peculiar respect to that Person. And afterward he pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceived that He was not a Created Angel, but Christ the Eter∣nal Son of God; for he calls him, <HI>the Iudge of all the Earth,</HI> which Title is peculiar to the Son
<PB N="42" REF="001076_0053_0FAFDF8CB63486A0"/>
of God. And in this Verse, and in several other places in this Chapter, He is called <HI>Iehovah,</HI> which is a name that may not be given to any Angel or Creature, but to Him alone who is the only true God. Two of the Angels went to the City of <HI>Sodom,</HI> so that <HI>Abraham</HI> was left with the Lord alone, who having intimated to him his purpose to destroy <HI>Sodom,</HI> because of the exceeding wickedness of that place, the Holy man with great humility and importunity beg∣ged of God, that he would spare them And that prayer he made no less than six times over: The argument he makes use of, is taken from the consideration of the merciful and equitable proceedings of God towards men.</P>
<P>He mentions it as a thing most undoubtedly true, <HI>That the Iudge of all the Earth would do right</HI>; whereas if he should inflict equal pu∣nishment on those that have been unequal Trans∣gressors, that would not seem to be right. He was concerned lest the Name of God should suffer, and therefore prays that God would for the sake of the Righteous spare the wicked, or however spare the Righteous themselves. This verse is the Lords gracious Answer to <HI>Abrahams</HI> first request. It may be (says he) there are fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty righteous men in the City, and wilt not thou spare them for their sakes. The Lord in the words before us declared that if he found so many in that wicked place, he would spare the whole City for the sake of such a small number
<PB N="43" REF="001076_0054_0FAFDF8D763F7B50"/>
of Righteous Ones. The Doctrine which the words afford unto us, is,</P>
<P><HI>That Wicked men while in this world fare the bet∣ter for the sake of Righteous men.</HI></P>
<P>We shall first premise some Conclusions for the clearing and right understanding of the truth now before us. And then proceed to mention some things which are evidences of it.</P>
<P>Conclusion 1. <HI>That God is sometimes so provo∣ked by the sins of the wicked, that he will not spare them for the sake of the Righteous.</HI> So that this must not be understood as an universal <HI>standing Rule.</HI> The Lords condescending thus far to <HI>A∣braham</HI> at this time, was not to intimate that if there be any Righteous men in a place, that then that place shall not fall under destroying Judgments. In the days of <HI>Elijah</HI> there were seven thousand who had not bowed the knee to <HI>Baal.</HI> Yet Drought, and Famine, and Sword, (destroying judgments) came on the Land, notwithstanding there were some thousands of Righteous men therein. A fatal overthrow came on the Land of the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> by the Sword of <HI>Persia,</HI> when all the good men in the world were in that Land. Sometimes God is so highly provoked at the Sins of wicked men, at that although righteous men set themselves to deprecate impending Judgments, he becomes in∣exorable,
<PB N="44" REF="001076_0055_0FAFDF8E374137C8"/>
no intreaties will prevail with him to stay his hand. When there was a sore drought upon the Land, the Prophet <HI>Ieremiah</HI> did ear∣nestly pray that the Judgment might be remov∣ed. God gave him a flat denial, and told him, that instead of removing that Judgment, he would bring others that should be greater; and added moreover, <HI>though Moses and Samuel stood before him yet his mind could not be toward that</HI> people, <HI>Ier.</HI> 15 1. <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Samuel</HI> are instanced in, because God for their sakes had more than once spared a sinful people, but then he would not do it. There is a Scripture in <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> like that in <HI>Ieremiah, viz.</HI> that, Ezek. 14, 14. <HI>Though these three men,</HI> Noah, Daniel <HI>and</HI> Job <HI>were in it, they should deliver but their own Souls by their righteousness.</HI> And many times it has been so, that destroying Judgments have come on Cities, Provinces, Nations, in which there have been not fifty, but many hundreds, it may be thou∣sands of righteous men; yea many holy Chur∣ches of the Lord Jesus Christ. When once a sinful people have filled up the measure of their iniquity, there is no preventing the judgment de∣termined against them. It is said, in <HI>Dan.</HI> 8.23, 24. <HI>When the Transgressors are come to the full, a King of fierce countenance shall arise and destroy wonderfully.</HI> When the transgressors a∣mong the Jews were come to the full, <HI>Antiochus</HI> whom Historians describe to be one of a fierce countenance, was by the dreadful Providence of
<PB N="45" REF="001076_0056_0FAFDF8EF6A9F520"/>
God set over them as their King, who proved a bloody Persecutor and Destroyer of that people, notwithstanding their being the holy People. So then that is the first <HI>Conclusion.</HI></P>
<P>Conclusion 2. <HI>Although when destroying Iudg∣ments come upon a People, the Divine Providence does sometimes make a difference between the Righ∣teous and the Wicked, nevertheless it is not always so.</HI> Sometimes God in his Providence does ve∣ry signally discriminate between those he has a favour for, and others. When the Egyptians were visited with ten plagues, the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were preserved. When <HI>Sodom</HI> was over∣thrown, righteous <HI>Lot</HI> escaped. <HI>Barak</HI> had his life given to him for a prey, when others were swept away with a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>som of destruction</P>
<P>It was said to the Church in <HI>Philadelphia, Be∣cause thou hast kept the word of my patience, I al∣so will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world. Rev</HI> 3 10. When the <HI>Babylonians</HI> laid <HI>Ierusalem</HI> waste, some who were Mourners in <HI>Zion,</HI> experienced signal tem∣poral Salvations. And so it was with the <HI>Chri∣stian Iews</HI> at that time when utter desolation came on <HI>Ierusalem</HI> by the <HI>Roman</HI> Sword. God did by a miraculous Providence distin∣guish them from others, according to <HI>Ma∣lachi's</HI> Prophesy. <HI>Then shall ye return and dis∣cern between the righteous and the wicked, be∣tween him that serveth God, and him that ser∣veth
<PB N="46" REF="001076_0057_0FAFDF8FB63574E8"/>
him not. Mal.</HI> 3.18. Thus it came to pass. The Lord Jesus Christ had intimated to his Disciples, that when they should see <HI>Ierusa∣lem</HI> compassed about with armies, they should know that the destruction of it is near, and that therefore they should go out of the City to some other place for safety. When the <HI>Romans</HI> came to take the City, they did by a strange Providence withdraw their Seige. The Christians remembring the words of Christ went out of the City to <HI>Pella,</HI> a Town beyond the River <HI>Iordan,</HI> when they were gone, the Roman Army came again and never broke up the Seige until they had destroy∣ed and utterly ruined the City. Thus did the Lord make a difference between the righ∣teous and the wicked; then also was another Prophesie fulfilled, <HI>viz.</HI> that, <HI>Ioel</HI> 2▪32. <HI>It shall come to pass that whoever calls upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved.</HI> The Christian <HI>Iews</HI> that <HI>Called on the name of the Lord Iesus Christ</HI> were saved, when o∣thers were destroyed. And to be sure, what∣ever comes on the world, God will secure &amp; save a number of Righteous ones: So that he will have a Church here on the Earth, whatsoever Confusions and Overturnings may come upon Nations and Kingdoms; there∣fore in the seventh of the <HI>Revelations</HI> the first verse, we read of <HI>four Angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the winds that
<PB N="47" REF="001076_0058_0FAFDF90862E0418"/>
they should not blow on the earth.</HI> The mean∣ing is, that a terrible Storm was a coming on the whole world, and such a stormy wind as should overset Kingdoms, and pluck up Na∣tions by the roots, but says Christ in the 3d. <HI>verse, hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads.</HI> A Seal is sometimes for notification, as well as for confirmation; like that of the Blood being sprinkled on the doors of the houses of the Children of <HI>Israel.</HI> Hereby is noted, how God does sometimes signally preserve his Righteous ones. When the world is turning up side down, they are as safe as things that have the <HI>Seal Royal</HI> on them, which may not be medled with. Won∣derful it was that when the Roman Empire was overturned by barbarous Nations, many Professors of Christianity escap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the general destruction Nevertheless, though the Lord does sometimes make a difference as to out∣ward Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is not always so; there∣fore it is said, <HI>Eccles</HI> 9.2. <HI>There is one Event unto the Righteous and to the Wicked</HI>; And God says, in <HI>Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> 21.3, 4. that he would <HI>Cut off the Righteous with the Wicked</HI>: For alas! s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>metimes righteous men do partake too much in the sins of the wicked, by which God is provoked to bring destroying judg∣ments on the Earth. And if they partake with them in their sins, it is not to be w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣dred
<PB N="48" REF="001076_0059_0FAFDF91397B1298"/>
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if they partake with them in the judg∣ments that come for those sins. Come out of <HI>Babylon</HI> (says God) my people, <HI>partake not of her sins, lest you receive of her plagues. Rev.</HI> 18.4. And which is a sadder truth, righteous men may through temptation fall into such sins as shall bring temporal judgments on themselves and others too. Thus <HI>Gideon</HI> by introducing innovations in Religion, made a great Schism a∣mong the Lords people, which ended in sore ca∣lamities, <HI>Iudg.</HI> 7.27. The like is to be said of <HI>David</HI> when he numbred the people; and <HI>Ieho∣saphat</HI> when he did too much comply with an ungodly Interest, 2 Chron. 19.2. <HI>Shouldst thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore wrath from the Lord is on thee:</HI> And what was that wrath? why in the next Chapter you see how there was a great force from beyond Sea, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Moabites,</HI> who dwelt on the other side of the <HI>dead Sea,</HI> and other E¦nemies coming to invade the Land, and this to punish <HI>Iehosaphat,</HI> a good man for his sinful compliances; so then righteous men may suffer with the wicked. And in Epidemical Judg∣ments 'tis commonly so, when a War breaks forth, Righteous men are cut off as well as o∣thers; the Sword devours one as well as ano∣ther: Or if mortal and contagious diseases hap∣pen, Good men as well as others dy by this Judgment; when seventy thousand men were swept away by the Plague in <HI>Davids</HI> time, no
<PB N="49" REF="001076_0060_0FAFDF9353DC7130"/>
doubt but that there were many righteous men among them. When the Plague was in <HI>Germany,</HI> Eminent Ministers, and Great <HI>Reformers</HI> dyed thereby as well as others. So when there is a ge∣neral Persecution, both the righteous as well as the wicked, both sincere Professors of Religion and Hypocrites suffer in that common calamity.</P>
<P>Conclusion 3. <HI>In spiritual respects there is a great difference in those temporal judgments, which the wicked and the righteous are subject to in this world</HI> For when such judgments fall on the wicked, they are Paenal, they are part of the Curse; some part of the wages due for their sins, some sparks of Hell fire lighting on them be∣fore they come there. Whereas it is otherwise wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the Righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eous; the afflictions that befal them are not paenal properly, but Castigations, and fatherly ones too; the Lord chasteneth whom h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> loves as a father doth his son in whom he delights <HI>Prov</HI> 3.12. And therefore God al∣ways designs their good in whatever afflictions do befal them, many times their temporal good. I may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great afflictions befal them, to pre∣vent far greater. So it was with the good figs the Prophet speaks of. They were sent in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Land of the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> for their good. <HI>Ier.</HI> 24 5 Had they tarried in their own land, as they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld have been glad to have done, when the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Army invaded the Land, it would have gone worse with them. So that God sent
<PB N="50" REF="001076_0061_0FAFDF937AA76950"/>
them into the land of <HI>Chaldea</HI> for their temporal good, to save them from perishing by the Sword. However God designs the spiritual good, and the eternal advantage of righteous ones, when outward judgments do befal them <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> 8.39 <HI>All things shall work together for their good.</HI> All things, all afflictions, that is, for of them, especially the Apostle speaks, when he says <HI>All things.</HI> Nay if killing judgments come on them, they shall be for their spiritual &amp; eternal good; they shall hasten them to heaven, where they shall never sin and displease God any more. Sometimes Death is the greatest mercy that can happen to a righteous man. <HI>The Righteous are taken away from the Evil to come.</HI> Many a righteous man had he lived a while longer, his heart would have been broke to have seen the miseries that would have come upon him, or on his Relati∣ons. There<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore God in singular mercy takes them out of the world, as he did <HI>Iosiah,</HI> that so his eyes might not see the evil that was coming. We cannot say so of wicked me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for when Death comes on them, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll follows with it. <HI>They shall go out of one fire, and another fire shall devour them Ezek</HI> 15 7. They shall go ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the fire of temporal judgments, into that fire which never shall be quenched So it was wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the people of <HI>Sodom,</HI> when Lightning killed their Bodies. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernal Fire did take hold on their Souls; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fore the Apostle <HI>Iude</HI> says of them, that they <HI>are suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</HI> In
<PB N="51" REF="001076_0062_0FAFDF9436FA5740"/>
this respect God always puts a difference be∣tween every righteous man, and every wicked man There is no righteous man that shall be punished <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> everlasting destruction. Nay, God s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds tem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oral judgments on them to pre∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt that; they are chastened of the Lord, that they may not be condemned with the wicked world; whereas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere is no wicked man that shall escape everlasting destruction. <HI>Isa</HI> 3 10, 11. <HI>Say ye to the Righteous it shall he well with him, wo unto the wicked it shall be ill with him.</HI> So must the Ministers of God say, it shall go well for ever with the Righteous, but wo will be for ever to the wicked. These things then being premised for clearing the truth, we proceed to mention the Evidences of it: <HI>How does it appear that wicked men while in this world fare the better for the sake of Righteous men?</HI> For Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. Sometimes <HI>they are spared as to temporal Ruin</HI> for the sake of Righteous men, as the City of <HI>Zoar,</HI> a whole City, (though but a lit∣tle one) was spared for the sake of <HI>Lot. Gen.</HI> 19.22 So when <HI>Paul</HI> was Sailing to <HI>Rome,</HI> all the Ships Company had their lives saved for his sake: The Angel said to him, <HI>God has given thee all them that Sail with thee. Acts</HI> 27.24▪ There were two hundred threescore and six<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een souls, whose lives were all spared for the sake of a righ∣teous <HI>Paul,</HI> that was among them. Thus in the Parable, the tares were spared for the sake of the wheat that was mixed with them. <HI>Mat.</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="001076_0063_0FAFDF94F6F7D2B8"/>
13 29 the Servants would have been plucking up the tares, no says the Lord, let them alone, <HI>lest you pluck up the wheat also.</HI> The truth is, that the world stands for the sake of a few righ∣teous men in it. And so it has been in every Generation. <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.25 <HI>The Righteous is an everlasting foundation</HI>: They as a foundation uphold the world, and have done so all along from the beginning of the world, and will do so to the end of it 'Tis for their sakes any are saved, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.22. <HI>No flesh should be saved if it were not for the Elects sake</HI> If all the Righte∣ous men in the world were taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of it, God would do to this Earth as he did to <HI>Sodom</HI> when <HI>Lot</HI> was taken out of it. If all the Righteous men were taken out of the Earth, God would set the whole World on fire before to morrow. Then 'tis for their sakes that the world stands; when all the Elect are called and snatched out of the world (as it will be at the last and great day) then devouring fire shall come and de∣stroy all the wicked. Then that Scripture will be fulfilled in the utmost extent of it, <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 4 1. <HI>For behold the day cometh that shall burn as an O¦<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, and all the wicked shall be stubble, they shall be burnt up root and branch.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Positive Blessings</HI> are bestowed on wicked men for the sake of righteous men They are not only saved from great evils and judgments, but many mercies and blessings are bestowed on them: Ungodly Children do many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are
<PB N="53" REF="001076_0064_0FAFDF95BB516108"/>
the better for the sake of their Godly Parents; as it was with <HI>Ishmael,</HI> when his Father <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> prayed for him, God said concerning <HI>Ish∣mael, I have heard thee, behold I will bless him, and make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; I will make him a Nation because he is thy Seed. Gen.</HI> 21.13: Great temporal Blessings came on him for his Fathers sake. The Children of <HI>Ionathan</HI> fared the better, because of the piety of their Father: Enqui∣ry was made by <HI>David,</HI> Is there none of the seed of <HI>Ionathan,</HI> that I may show kindness unto? And when <HI>Mephibosheth</HI> appeared, <HI>Da∣vid</HI> said to him, I will surely shew thee kind∣ness <HI>for thy Father Ionathans sake.</HI> So does God shew kindness to many an Ungodly Child for their fathers sake.

seven years together, it was by means of <HI>Io∣seph</HI> that a whole Nation was preserved from perishing by that judgment, as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> confessed to him, in Gen. 47.25 <HI>Thou hast sa∣ved our lives</HI> say they. And indeed the greatest blessing the world does enjoy, 'tis for the sake of a few righteous men in it; namely the Gos∣pel, that is the greatest blessing that is bestowed on the World, now this is for the sake of the Righteous. There be many that despise the Gospel, yea the greatest part of the world does so, only there are a few Righteous men that the Word of God is dearer to them than any thing in the world, and for their sakes the Gospel is continued, and others have the benefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it.</P>

How far did <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> prevail? he almost obtained the life of five wicked Cities by his Prayer to God for them, and if he could have got ten Righteous men more to have joyned with him, he had Saved them all alive.

<P>We proceed to make some Improvement of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hence then we must conclude that Righteous men are exceeding dear to God</HI> The Psalmist said in <HI>Psal.</HI> 146 8· <HI>The Lord loves the Righteous.</HI> It must needs be so, if he spares other for their sakes. As when a Prince does spare those that are risen up in rebellion against him, at the in∣tercession of one that is near to his Person, all men conclude such a one is a great favourite of that Prince. It is related concerning the Empe∣ror <HI>Augustus,</HI> that when the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> had off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im and he had ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained an absolute conquest over them, every body thought that now he would destroy the City, but (said he) there is such a one in the City, a Philosopher whom I have a singular Love for, and for his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke I will spare you all.

And as God spares others for their sakes, so sometimes he destroys others on their account, that is such as wrong and abuse them. Isa 43.4. <HI>I will give men for thee, and people for thy life, because I have

Yet has there not been that National turning unto God which he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s expected. There has not been a thorough Re∣formation either of manners or of other evils. We may than fear that more terrible things are at the dore than ever yet we have known: Yet not utter Destruction. It was said of the Jewish Nation notwithstanding all the Sins they had been guilty of, <HI>Isa.</HI> 6 13. That <HI>the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</HI> So may we hope concerning our sinful Nation, that <HI>the Holy Seed,</HI> that the righteous will be a means to preserve it from utter Desolation: for doubtless there be many such, and it may be more than in any one Nation in the World. To be sure there be more than Fifty, yea than Fifty thousand righte∣ous men to be found in those Kingdoms. I re∣member I once knew a very holy and Learned man, (it was Dr. <HI>Winter</HI> who was the Provost of the Colledge in <HI>Dublin</HI> when I belonged to that University Forty four years since) who in a meeting with his Church, that were assembled together to Pray, pleading for <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> just as <HI>Abraham</HI> did here for <HI>Sodom,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he, if there be Fifty thousand righteous men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> wilt not thou

save the Nations, for the sake of Fifty thousand righteous men▪ And so went on till at last he came to ten thousand; upon this he made a pause as one surprised and amazed, and turned his Prayer into a Thanksgiving, in that his Pray∣er was heard. Some inquiring of him afterwards the reason of it, he told them, that God had as∣sured him that for the sake of ten thousand righ∣teous men, He would not destroy those Nations. So as to <HI>New England,</HI> there are many righteous men yet among us: we may then hope that God will remember that word, <HI>Ier.</HI> 30 11. <HI>I will not make a full end of them.</HI> Although we have reason to fear seven time greater evils th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n we have hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herto had experience of, neverthe∣less, God will not as yet make a full end of us, but while so many righteous are to be found in the Land, he will spare us for their sakes; And therefore,</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Let us make sure that we be found a∣mong the Righteous</HI> And then it will be well with us It may be signal temporal Preservations shall attend us, in those dismal Confusions which are hastening upon the World. It may be we shall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.

would be found among the righteous, we must have a better righteousness than that of our own, namely, the Righteousness of Jesus Christ the Son of God. If then we be found Cloathed with the glorious righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, what ever comes on the world it shall go well with us for ever. Then shall our Souls be safe to Eternity. So let us walk in the fear of God, and remember that Scripture with which I con∣clude, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 8.12. <HI>Surely I know that it shall go well with them that fear God, which fear before him.</HI></P>

<P>THESE words were spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ, who knowing that men, would be apt to question the truth of the Prophesies con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain∣ed in this Book, to put all out of doubt, declares that no man or Angel, but he himself was the Author of it; to intimate which is the scope of this verse, wherein Christ is de∣scribed,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="65" REF="001076_0076_0FAFDFA0630BD8F8"/>1. From his Name <HI>Iesus,</HI> implying his being the <HI>Saviour</HI> of men. <HI>I Iesus have sent my An∣gel</HI>; therefore not the Angel was the Author of this Book. The Angel did only declare the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssage that Christ sent him with</P>
<P N="2">2. He is described from his Divine Nature, implied in that expression of his being the <HI>Root of David</HI>; one that <HI>David</HI> received his Being from. As there is not a Branch without a Root, so there had never been such a man as <HI>David,</HI> if Christ as God had not given to him his being.</P>
<P N="3">3. He is described from his Humane Nature, in that expression of his <HI>being the Offspring of Da∣vid,</HI> which implies his being the promised <HI>Messi∣ah.</HI> The <HI>Iews</HI> commonly called Christ by that name of <HI>the Son of David.</HI> God had promised <HI>David</HI> that Christ should descend from him: The <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssiah</HI> was to be of his Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pring, a Branch of his Family. It was once said to the Jews, since Christ is <HI>Davids</HI> Son, how does <HI>Da∣vid</HI> whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inspired by the Holy Spirit of God, call him his Lord: They were not able to an∣swer that question, because they did not believe that the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssiah</HI> was God; but unto Christians it is very plain: As God he is <HI>Davids</HI> Lord, &amp; so the Root of <HI>David,</HI> but as man he is <HI>Davids</HI> Son, and so the Offspring of <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, Christ is described from the Glory of his Person, in the words now b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore us, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch may be cleared under the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which is,</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="001076_0077_0FAFDFA0F6EB8648"/><HI>That the Lord Iesus Christ is fitly compared to a Star, and in special to the bright Morning Star.</HI></P>
<P>We have the like comparison to this in other Scriptures. These words seem to allude to the 24th. of <HI>Numbers</HI> 17▪ where it is said, <HI>A Star shall rise out of Iacob, and shall smite the corners of Moab</HI>; which words altho' they were partly ful∣filled in <HI>David,</HI> who smote <HI>the Corners,</HI> that is to say, <HI>the Princes</HI> of <HI>Moab,</HI> nevertheless they are chiefly to be understood concerning Christ, and the Spiritual <HI>Moab</HI> that has been and shall be smitten by him. Again, in <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.28. Christ says, <HI>to him that overcomes I will give the Morn∣ing Star</HI>; when Christ gives himself with all his benefits to the Believer, than does he give him the <HI>Morning Star.</HI> For clearing the Doctrine, we shall, (1.) Inquire into the <HI>Similitude,</HI> &amp; (2.) The <HI>Dissimilitude</HI> which is in this comparison.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, <HI>In what respect is the Lord Iesus Christ compared to a Star, and in special to the Morning Star</HI>? For Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Stars are very glorious Creatures.</HI> Although there is a great difference among them as to their glory. Some Stars are of the first, others of the second, some of the sixth magnitude, as A∣stronomers are wont to distinguish. And the A∣postle says, 1 Cor. 15.41. <HI>That one Star differs from another in glory</HI>; nevertheless, they are all glorious Creatures; and they are a glory and an ornament to that Heaven where God has set
<PB N="67" REF="001076_0078_0FAFDFA1B72B0430"/>
them; therefore is it said, Job 26.13. <HI>He has garnished the Heavens</HI>; and how? namely with Stars that glitter there. How do the Heavens glitter in a clear Starry Night! Thus Christ is most glorious: When he appeared in Humane Shape to the Elders of <HI>Israel, Exod.</HI> 24 10. there seemed to be <HI>under his feet as it were a Saphire Stone, and the body of heaven in its clearness.</HI> A Saphire Stone is a glorious Gem full of beauti∣ful specks resembling Stars. In like sort did Christs glory then appear. And there is no Star tho' of the greatest magnitude that is such an orna∣ment unto the second Heaven, as Christ is, yea as the Humane Nature of Christ is to the Hea∣ven of Heavens where he now does shine with inexpressible glory. Therefore 'tis said, <HI>That the Lamb</HI> (that is Christ) <HI>is the light and glory of the Heavenly Ierusalem. Rev.</HI> 21.23.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Stars are not subject unto such mutation as sublunary Bodies are.</HI> They are of perpetual du∣ration, and therefore it is a phrase in Scripture, <HI>as the days of heaven,</HI> to intimate perpetual dura∣tion. The Stars are by the Hebrews called by that name of <HI>Chochabim,</HI> by <HI>Antiphrasis,</HI> because they are lights that never shall be extinguished, they have been shining in the Heavens ever since the first Creation, and probably will con∣tinue to be there when this Earth shall perish▪ But Christ is more immutable than any Star <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heaven <HI>Ioh</HI> 12 34. The <HI>Iews</HI> said, <HI>we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of the Law that Christ abides for ever</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="68" REF="001076_0079_0FAFDFA282C63C50"/>
less their meaning was that they had read out of the 110<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Psalm, that Christ is a <HI>Priest for e∣ver</HI>: Unto the Son of God it has been said, <HI>Thy Throne is for ever and ever, thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail, Heb.</HI> 1.8, 12 <HI>Iesus Christ is the same yesterday and to day and for ever.</HI> So then he is fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> resembled to a Star, in regard of his immutable Being</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Stars in general (and the Morning Star in special) are a common benefit to the World.</HI> All the Nations on the Earth are benefited by the influences thereof. This must we say concer∣ning the Lord Jesus Christ, he is a Blessing to all the Nations of the World. It was said there∣fore to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen 26.18 <HI>In thy seed</HI> (that is in Christ) <HI>shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed.</HI> All the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct of God, of whom there are some of all Nations do feel the saving influ∣ence of this Star. But besides that, Christ has been a Blessing to all men whatever; all Man∣kind has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ared the better for him; for it is by means of Jesus Christ that the world has been put under a Dispensation of Divine Patience: The tree of mankind has not been cut down, because Christ has interposed and preserved it. As it is said concerning the barren Fig-tree, by which the Jewish Church and Nation was intended, when there was a sentence pass'd <HI>to Cut it down,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dresser of the Vineyard said, <HI>spare it ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and if it does not bring forth fruit, then it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut down.</HI> In like manner when the
<PB N="69" REF="001076_0080_0FAFDFA33B2A7818"/>
Law of God had sentenced mankind to be cut down, Christ stept in and said, spare that tree, till all the Elect be called, and then it shall be cut down. So that Christ is in that respect a Saviour of all men, but especially of them that do believe.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Stars and especially the Morning Star gives light unto the World.</HI> Jer. 31.35. God <HI>giveth the Sun for a light by day and the Stars for a light by night.</HI> Hence is that expression of <HI>Stars of light▪ Psal.</HI> 148.3. <HI>Praise the Lord ye Stars of light.</HI> The morning Star is in a singular manner one of those <HI>Stars of light.</HI> But this must we say con∣cerning the Lord Jesus Christ: He gives light unto the world, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.78▪ 79▪ <HI>Through the ten∣der mercy of our God, the day spring from on high has visited us, to give light to them that sit in dark∣ness</HI> Christ is called <HI>the Light of the world, Ioh.</HI> 8.12 There is light enough in him to enlighten all the world, and therefore he is said to be a <HI>Great light.</HI> As in <HI>Isa</HI> 9 Tis said▪ <HI>the dimness shall not be as in the Land of Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bulun and Naph∣tali, and in Galilee, the People that sat in darkness saw a great light, for unto us a Child is born, a Son is given, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God.</HI> To open that Scrip∣ture as we go along.

For our Saviour during his private life dwelt in the City of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> a Town in <HI>Galilee</HI>; &amp; when he Entred upon his Publick Ministry, he did Reside in <HI>Capernaum,</HI> which was the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI>: And all his Disciples were <HI>Galileans</HI>; the blind <HI>Iews</HI> obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted that J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus could not be <HI>the Christ,</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cause he came out of <HI>Galilee,</HI> where∣as if they had understood the Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipture, they would ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r thence have concluded that he was the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> since the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> had fore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old that he shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Preach in <HI>Galilee</HI>: He seldom c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to <HI>Ierusalem</HI> only on the Publick Fest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>als, but spent his time most in <HI>Galilee,</HI> Preaching the Gospel there: Thus did a <HI>great Light</HI> app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar unto them.

which are able to make wise unto Salvation.</HI> Now the Scriptures are <HI>the words of Christ,</HI> Col. 3.16. They are raies of light from this morning Star. The world was in darkness &amp; ignorance before Christ came into it: all the Nations of the world were in thick darkness excepting one Na∣tion, and that one had as it were but Candle light among them. This I take to be the mean∣ing of the Apostle, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.19. <HI>There is a sure word of Prophecy to which you do well to take heed, as to a light which shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.</HI> The Apostle compares that <HI>light</HI> which the <HI>Iew∣ish Church</HI> had from the Scriptures of the old Testament, to a Candle that shines in a dark Room, but now (says he) that Christ is come, and the Gospel dispensation takes place, the day is dawned, and the day Star is risen in your hearts. It was foretold that the Times of the <HI>Messiah</HI> should be Times of very great knowledge, that the light of knowledge should then abound, <HI>Isa▪</HI> 11 9 <HI>The knowledge of the Lord shall cover the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea.</HI> What abun∣dance of waters be there in the Sea? even so, in the dayes of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> an abundance of knowledge shall cover the earth It has b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en so, and there is a day hast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning, when it will be unspeakably more so than ever yet has been. As for knowledge concerning future events to befal the Church of God, that light is from the Lord J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus Christ. He is in a special manner in the

Text before us represented as the <HI>Morning Star,</HI> in that he has brought light to the Church con∣cerning what should befal it even to his Second coming: what Changes, what Persecutions, and what Glory after all.</P>
<P>Again, there is the light of Saving Grace, that also is from Christ. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1 16 <HI>Of his fulness we all receive and grace for grace.</HI> What ever grace is in any mans Soul, it is a ray darted into him from this <HI>Morning Star</HI>: and therefore Christians have more or less grace, according as Christ is pleased to shine on them, and impart this light to them.

<P N="6">6. <HI>When the Morning Star appears the darkest time of the Night is over.</HI> The Morning Star appears at the end of the night. So did Christ appear at the end of the Jewish world, <HI>Heb</HI> 9 28. <HI>He has appeared in the end of the world</HI>; as the morning Star does appear in the end of the night. The legal Dispensation was a dark dispensation, and when that was just ended, Christ appeared, and that night of darkness which was on the world, vanished presently on his appearing, 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2▪ 8. <HI>The darkness is passed away and now the true light shineth.</HI> The darkness of ignorance that was on the world, the darkness of <HI>Iudaism</HI> and <HI>Heathenism,</HI> is wonderfully pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d away, &amp; Christ in his Gospel is the true light that shipes. This Star is to be seen in the Morning Even so there is a blessed Morning that will be here over a lit∣tle while, when all men shall see this bright Morning Star, namely the Morning of the Re∣surrection, when the night of Death is past, and all Believers shall come out of the Land of dark∣ness,
<PB N="75" REF="001076_0086_0FAFDFA7C2B07A00"/>
when the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>surrection World</HI> shall take place, Christ will lighten the whole earth with his glory.</P>
<P>Lastly. <HI>The Appearance of the Morning Star is a sure Sign the day is Approaching,</HI> that the Sun will arise &amp; shine very speedily. Some observe that it is commonly a sign of a fair day if the morning Star is seen. To be sure the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ did foretel a happy day unto the world. The Angel said to the Shepherds, in <HI>Luk.</HI> 2, 10 <HI>I bring you glad Tidings of great joy which shall be to all People, for unto you is born this day a Saviour even Christ the Lord</HI> So when Christ appears spiritually to the Souls of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, it is a sign of a blessed day: Tis a sure sign that the day of Salvation shall arise on their Souls. It was said to <HI>Zacob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us, Luk</HI> 19.9. <HI>Salvation is come to this house this day.</HI> Christ was come to that House and Salvation came along with him. This may be a special reason why Christ here in this Book of <HI>Revelation</HI> is represented as <HI>the Morning Star,</HI> because in this Book he does bring glad Tidings unto the World; He brings Ti∣dings of his own coming, as in the Context be∣fore us, <HI>Behold I come quickly.</HI> In the Morning if you see this Star, you may conclude that the Sun will quickly arise upon the world. So Christ does in the conclusion of this Book bring Tidings of a glorious day approaching unto the Church, that the Church shall one day be Tri∣umphant not only in H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aven to all E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernity, but here on Earth too, when <HI>New Ierusalem</HI> shall
<PB N="76" REF="001076_0087_0FAFDFA88CAF9AB8"/>
come down from Heaven. When the Saints in glory shall come down from Heaven and be re∣united to their Bodies, and reside here on earth, during the glorious dispensation of Judgment, then comes the New Jerusalem down from Hea∣ven. And Christ brings to the Church glad Tidings of such a day. He is then fitly resem∣bled unto the Morning Star: Thus for the Si∣militude. We proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2. To the <HI>Dissimilitude,</HI> which is between Christ, and the Morning Star.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Morning Star shines with a borrowed light.</HI> It is in it self a dark body, as all the Pla∣nets are. The Morning Star would have no Splendor at all in it, were it not for the Sun that shines on it: but Christ shines with a light that is from himself. And although 'tis true concern∣ing the Humane nature of Christ, that the glory of it is received, yet tis received from himself, that is to say, from his Divine nature therefore Christ said to the Jews, <HI>Ioh</HI> 2 19 <HI>Destroy this Temple.</HI> No doubt but (as some have observed) that when Christ spake these words he pointed to his own Body, <HI>and in three days I will raise it up.</HI> Christs Resurrection, so his Ascension and Glorification was from himself, from his Divine nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Morning Star is but a Creature</HI>: but the Lord Jesus Christ he is more than a Creature. Though his Humane nature is a Creature, and in Truth the most glorious Creature that ever
<PB N="77" REF="001076_0088_0FAFDFA936741FE0"/>
was made. There is more of God to be seen in the Humane nature of Christ than in all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sides. But his Person is increated; he is an increated Per∣son, he is the Creator: He has made the Stars, the Heavens and Host thereof are made by him: and this Morning Star that appears in the Fir∣mament was made by him; nothing was ever made but what was made by him. And his be∣ing thus the Creator, does distinguish him from <HI>the Morning Star.</HI> The first Creature that ever was made did receive its beginning and being from him: therefore it is said of him, in <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.14. <HI>That he is the beginning of the Creation of God:</HI> the meaning of which is not (as <HI>Arians</HI> have perversely interpreted that Scripture) that he was the first Creature but that the Creation of God received its beginning from him. Thus then we see the Doctrine cleared in the things that have been insisted on▪</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>We should Admire the Glory of the Lord Ie∣sus Christ.</HI> The most glorious Creatures do but a little set forth his glory: the Stars of Heaven, yea <HI>the bright Morning Star</HI> has no brightness in it compared with him. The Sun in the Firma∣ment is darkness it self compared with the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Iob</HI> 25:5. <HI>Behold even to the Moon and it shineth not, yea the Stars are not pure in his

sight.</HI> As for the Morning Star, our mortal eyes may behold the glory of it without any detri∣ment, but the glory of Christ is such as no mor∣tal eye can b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hold it, <HI>He dwells in glorious and unapproachable light whom never man saw nor in∣deed can see.</HI> When Christ appeared to <HI>Paul</HI> go∣ing to <HI>Damascus,</HI> there was a light above the brightness of the Sun, in its Meridian glory; it was then mid-day, but the glory of Christ was greater than the light of the Sun, <HI>Act</HI> 26.13. Ten thousand Suns would not shine so glori∣ously as the Lord Jesus Christ now does When Christ was in his Estate of Humiliation, the <HI>A∣postle Iohn</HI> could lay his head in his Bosome: but since in his Glorified Estate, that Apostle had an Apparition of Christ: And (said he) <HI>I fell down as dead at his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rev.</HI> 1.17. We cannot admire the Lord Jesus Christ too much We may be more taken than we should be with the glory of Creatures, but we never can with the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, though our <HI>Admiration</HI> should be to <HI>Adoration</HI>; that is no more than what is out indispensable duty. To worship the <HI>Morning Star</HI> as the Gentiles of old were wont to do, under the name of <HI>Venus,</HI> and as some <HI>Arabians</HI> do (at this day) is idolatry, and a horrible sin: but to worship the Lord Je∣sus Christ is our duty. When he first appeared in the world there was a <HI>Miraculous Star</HI> seen: it was not a <HI>Comet,</HI> or such a Star, as is now blazing over our heads, for it directed to a par∣ticular
<PB N="79" REF="001076_0090_0FAFDEFACD066578"/>
Town, and to a particular house <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lso. Therefore it was such a wonderful work of God as that of the Pillar of Fire in the Wilderness, that directed the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> in the way. It may be (as some of the Ancients thought) it was an Angel appearing in the form of a Star. But by this the Wise men of the East knew that it was their Duty to worship the Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>Where is he</HI> (said they) <HI>that is born King of the Iews, for we have seen his Star, and are come to worship him.</HI> There is not one An∣gel in Heaven, but what does worship our Lord Jesus Christ. Heb. 1 6. <HI>Worship him all you Angels.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Hence <HI>then Christless Sinners are in a dis∣mal Estate.</HI> For they, yea their Souls are in Midnight Darkness. Has not this Star Risen on thee? then what if thy case? Has not Christ by his Spirit risen on thee with his saving influ∣ences, then thou art none of his, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 9. <HI>If a man has not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his!</HI> And if none of his, then whose art thou? And where art thou, but in the Kingdom of Dark∣ness, in black chains which thy miserable Soul is captivated and held fast in them. Has not thy Soul seen this Morning Star! then thou hast no assurance that ever thou shalt see a good day. No Assurance that ever th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re will be a day of Salva∣tion to thy soul What a miserable case be they then in, that never saw this morning star, that never heard of Christ; they sin in Darkness and in the Region of the shadow of Death. And
<PB N="80" REF="001076_0091_0FAFDEFB369EB250"/>
those will be a thousand times more miserable that have heard of Christ, but never had an heart to believe on him. That this bright Star has risen on them, but they will not behold the glory of it; they shut their eyes against this light. This is the Condemnation that light is come in∣to the world, and men love darkness rather than light; for such in a special manner is Reserved the blackness of Darkness for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence then the Lords People should observe Christ's Providential Dispensations and Appearan∣ces to them, so as to be encouraged thereby.</HI> Christ is wont to appear first as a <HI>Morning Star,</HI> and then as the <HI>Sun</HI>; that is to say, he does fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st give a lesser degree of light unto his people, and that as an assurance of far greater light, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the light given to them shall shine more and more to the perfect day. Christ as a Morning Star has been dispensing himself to his people in the two last ages of the World. When the <HI>Refor∣mation</HI> began, then did Christ appear in his Providence as the Morning Star in respect of that light of knowledge which he blessed the world with. It was a dark day, (or a long night rather) during the Reign of Antichrist; but when the Providence of Christ began a <HI>Re∣formation</HI> in the Nations near two hundred years ago, there did appear the Morning Star. And the Light has been advancing and growing ever since that day. The Age wherein we now live is an Age of great light, (would to God it were
<PB N="81" REF="001076_0092_0FAFDEFBF90749F8"/>
an Age of great zeal and holiness too) but it is an Age of greater Light than the former. There are many dark and difficult places in the Scrip∣ture, that formerly could not be understood, which of late have been opened with great clear∣ness. And especially in this Book of the <HI>Revela∣tions.</HI> The first Reformers did very few of them search into it; and those few that did saw but a little. <HI>Calvin</HI> though I believe he was the greatest Interpreter that ever wrote ont the Bible, yet would not meddle with the Book of the <HI>Revela∣tion.</HI> He professed he did no know what to make of it: When as in the last Century very many have looked into it, and made glorious discoveries; a blessed sign it is that all the glori∣ous things spoken of therein shall be fulfilled in this very Age which God has now brought us to the beginning of. Inasmuch as the Book is unsealed, that is a sign the End is very near. There are two things which have lately happen∣ed which I would take notice of, and one may see the Morning Star in them. Though it is true, that we have cause to expect a dismal time. A little before break of day is the darkest time of all the night. Nevertheless the morning star does appear in two things; one is that wonder∣ful Conversion of Pagans to the Christian Faith that has been in our days, and very lately.</P>
<P><HI>Papists</HI> have boasted of their <HI>Xaverins,</HI> who they say was an instrument of Converting ma∣ny thousands of the <HI>East Indians,</HI> for which
<PB N="82" REF="001076_0093_0FAFDEFCB617EE50"/>
cause the <HI>Pope</HI> Canonized him: And in their Books they reflect on <HI>Protestants,</HI> pretending that the like was never done by those whom they call <HI>Hereticks.</HI> But alas we may say of what they have done, as Christ said to the Scribes &amp; Pharisees, Matth. 23.15 <HI>You compass Sea and Land to make one Proselyte, and when he is made, you make him two fold more the Child of Hell than your selves.</HI> The Jesuits Converts are converted, not to <HI>Christ,</HI> but to <HI>Antichrist</HI>: They have taught them to be Idolaters: And have obtruded a false Gospel on them. <HI>Xavier</HI> has inserted diverse ficti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious things concerning Christ and concern∣ing the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> which he procured to be translated into the <HI>Persian</HI> tongue for the service of the great <HI>Mogul.</HI> Another <HI>Iesuit</HI> has added to the Gospel, the Story of the Assumption and Coronation of the <HI>Virgin Mary.</HI> Thus have they corrupted the word of God with their own Inventions, deluding the miserable Heathen there∣by, whom they have made more obstinate in their false belief, than if they were Pagans still. <HI>Protestants</HI> dare not teach any thing but what is according to the Scripture. And it has pleas∣sed God to bless their endeavours with wonder∣ful Success within these few years past, amongst the <HI>East Indians.</HI> In the Kingdom of <HI>Ieffana<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣man,</HI> the Lord has prospered the Labours of Five Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch Ministers, so as that above an hun∣dred and forty thousand of those <HI>Indians,</HI> have embraced the true Christian Protestant Religion.
<PB N="83" REF="001076_0094_0FAFDEFD7A679960"/>
And since that in four years time forty thousand more of them are b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>come Christians, renouncing the Idols whom they and their Fathers worship∣ped. Moreover, in <HI>Amboina</HI> there are thirty thousand Souls who have lately subjected them∣selves to the Lord Jesus Christ, although (which is marvellous) many of them were <HI>Mahometans.</HI> Of these things I have had certain Advice from a Learned Professor (Dr <HI>Leusden</HI>) in the Univer∣sity of <HI>Utrick</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> who received the ac∣count of them, from the Ministers concerned in this glorious work This looks like a <HI>Morning Star</HI></P>
<P>There has also of late been a notable Con∣version of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws to the Christian Religion. In the City of <HI>Hamburg,</HI> several hundreds of Jews some of them <HI>Rabbis,</HI> have by the happy endea∣vours of one D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vine, (<HI>viz</HI> Dr <HI>Esdras Edzard</HI>) been brought off from their <HI>Iudaism</HI> to <HI>Christia∣nity.</HI> All these Converts have been brought to own Christ wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hin these S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven years l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st past. The like has not been known since the days of the Apostles: May we no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then hope that what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> promised concerning the Conversion of the Israelitish Nation, will ere long be gloriously ac∣complished.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>If Christ is the Morning Star how should Christians long for his Appearing</HI> Do not men that have been for a long night in darkness and in a Storm, long to see the Morni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g Star appear!

of trouble, that have had a Stormy night of it, may well long for the appearing of this Morn∣ing Star to them We should long for Christs Providential Appearances, when he will deliver his persecuted Flocks: And when Princes shall oppress his People no more: Such a day is coming when the man of the Earth shall no, more oppress And we should long for Christs Personal Appearing: When he shall appear the second time unto Salvation, and when the man of sin shall be utterly destroyed by the <HI>Brightness of his Coming,</HI> and God shall give rewards to all that fear him both small and great. Then will he give a Crown of Righteousness to all that Love his Appearing <HI>Amen, Even So Come LORD IESVS, Come Quickly.</HI></P>
