<HEAD>A Preface to the Friendly Reader.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEfore thy Perusal of the following Treatise, to prevent Mistakes, and to further thy profiting by reading the same, there are some particulars, which I desire to lay before thee, and earnestly recommend to thy serious Con∣sideration, <HI>1st,</HI> That the many Errors in Doct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine which I have in this Treatise undertaken (by Gods help) to correct, and discover their contrariety to the holy Scriptures, I neither have charged, nor do charge them upon any present People any where called <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istians,</HI> in any place of the World, except∣ing only these called <HI>Ranters,</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, (because o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Impious and Blas∣phemous Doctrines and Principles) deserve not to be called or esteemed Men, far less to be classed among the lowest sort of these called <HI>Christians.</HI> And to shun all occasion of giving O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fence to any who have the least Tenderness and Sincerity towards God▪ Truth &amp; Rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teousness, I have named none by Name, belonging to any Society o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People; 'Tis true, I mention some Old Heresies, and the Names of such as did abet them, as <HI>Palagius</HI> and <HI>Eutyches,</HI> whose Errors some particular Persons in our present Age, to my certain Knowledge, do too much imbrace, through the great Ignorance, and want of a right Vn∣derstanding; and though the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st abettors of such Errors be dead and gone, yet it is needful that the Errors at least be witnessed against, and that Igno∣rant and Vnwary Souls be cautioned against t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em; for it is the stratagem &amp; subtilty of Satan, among other his subtil and mysterious Workings, to revive Old Heresies and Errors, formerly condemned by the Spirit of Truth in faith∣full Witnesses of Christ, as well as to invent New ones. And as I charge not the Errors hereafter Corrected, to any whole Society of People in <HI>Chri∣stendom,</HI> so nor wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld I be in the least understood to charge any one of these upon that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole Society o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People, who have been eminently and mani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estly raised up by the mighty Power and Spirit of God, to bear their faithful Te∣stimony, (according to what they have livingly witnessed) unto <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> and the <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> their inward Teachings, and to that blessed divine and heavenly Appearance of God and Christ in their Hearts, to the Truth of which many are raised to bear a blessed and faithful Testimony, and many more will in due time be raised, but as <HI>Paul</HI> said long ago, <HI>That all are not</HI> Israel <HI>which are called</HI> Israel; nor were all true Christians in <HI>Paul</HI>'s

So in this our Age, &amp; more especially even o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> late Years (since the Lord raised up many faithful Servants and Wit∣nesses to his bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Truth, &amp; bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed inward heavenly &amp; divine Appearance, by the Light and Life of his Son Christ Iesus, and of his holy Spirit in their Hearts, and whose Testimony God hath greatly blessed, and yet will more abundantly bless, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urning many Thousands from D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God, many of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul Witnesses and Bre∣thren are fallen a sleep, and rest with Christ, and divers of whom, even who were the first, do yet remain to this day.) I say, beside these faithful Witn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses and Brethren o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lords raising, there have been others, who have appeared, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to the great grief of the faithful) who have in words and show, as much as any other, pretended to the inward Teachings of the Spirit, and to Christs Light and Life within, and have got the words &amp; form of Truth in their Mouthes, Lips and Pens, in divers things, but altogether out of the Life and Spirit of Truth; and though such have the words of the Power of God o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in their Mouthes, yet Sathans Power too much ruleth in their hearts; &amp; though they talk of the Light of Christ, <HI>as he lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</HI> and pretend to direct and turn Men to it, yet walk in Dark∣ness themselves; and these have been and are a great occasion of Grief to the faithful and true Witnesses of the Light and Life o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ.</P>
<P>But as some at this day do greatly profess the Spirit's Teachings, and the Light and Life of Christ inwardly revealed, that are not in the least measure gathered into the Life and Possession of what they pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, &amp; pretend to preach and teach, against which faithful Witnesses of Truth have been constrained to declare, &amp; warn the simple concerning them; so there have been others, and are at present, who have had some measure of Convincement, by the Light &amp; Spirit of Truth in them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have felt in measure the Power and Operation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to begin a good Work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and have known in measure the pure Iudg∣ments

<P>But the <HI>Ignorance</HI> &amp; <HI>Defects</HI> of some, either really belonging to a Society of People, or pretending to belong unto them, are not to be cast or charged upon the whole Society, unless a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter due Notice, they cloak, cover and con∣nive at them.

<HEAD>Truth advanced above Error: <HI>Or,</HI> A Correction of many very dangerous and hurtful Errors, entertained by some, as Articles of Sound Doctrine, which yet are false Doctrine, and contradict the holy Scriptures, relating to many of the first Principles, and chief and most necessary things of the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ERROR I.</P>
<P>THat People should not be earnest to seek after or search into further Discoveries of divine Knowledge, because (<HI>as some alledge</HI>) they know enough already, if they be faithful to what they know; And to seek or search after Knowledge of divine Mysteries, hath an evil Tendency to make People airy, proud and fantastical.</P>
<P>CORRECTION.</P>
<P>Things should be rightly distinguished; there is a right and wrong seeking and searching after Knowledge: The right seeking proceeds from a real drawing and inclination of the Spirit of God, moving Souls to seek after a further increase of divine Knowledge; and the true manner of seeking after the same, is by frequent Prayer, silent Waiting, Meditation, Reading in the holy Scriptures, and other good Books, and Conference with Pious Men, endued with good Know∣ledge, and by using all other helps and means, both inward and out∣ward, by and with the aid, assistance, and help of Gods Spirit, as it is inwardly revealed and felt. And seeing we are commanded to grow both in Grace and Knowledge, we are to seek after a further in∣crease of Knowledge, as well as of Grace; and as no man is so Holy, but that he may and ought to be more Holy, so is none so <HI>Knowing</HI> in the things of God, but he may still know much more; <HI>for there is no end of the Treasures of divine Knowledge and Wisdom.</HI> And though such who are unfaithful should rather be faithful to what they know, than (remaining unfaithful) to seek after more Knowledge, and that the
<PB REF="000691_0011_0FA9A0B9AF3BEB40" MS="y"/>
way to attain to further Knowledge, is to be faithful in what is already made known; yet there are many who pretend to know enough, are really very Ignorant of many necessary things, and their Ignorance is a hinderance to their faithfulness; whereas if they had more real and sollid Knowledge, it would greatly help them to be more faithful unto God; for <HI>true divine Knowledge,</HI> received in the Spirit of Truth, and held in the some, doth greatly tend to promote and increase real Holiness in men; for the more we truely know God, the more we love him; and the more we love him, we are the more Obedient unto him, and conform to the Image of his Son. And tho' it is said to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> held by many in the Church of <HI>Rome, That Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion,</HI> yet this is renounced by all true <HI>Protestants</HI>; and it is good <HI>Protestant Doctrine,</HI> That the Scriptures are to be read and searched by all, with the help of the unerring Spirit of Truth, that did dictate them, that every one may be able to give an account of the Hope that is in him. And God is a God of Knowledge, and his Spirit is called in Scripture, <HI>The Spirit of Knowledge and Vnderstand∣ing,</HI> and therefore the more we know truly of God and Christ and divine Things, (if we be faithful to what we know) the more we are like unto God, <HI>True Divine Knowledge</HI> being a part of his Image. And the proper tendency of all true divine living Knowledge of God and divine Things is to make men truly Humble, sollid and weighty; but Ignorance, and dead and dry Knowledge, empty of Life, and without the true Love of God and our Neighbour, which is <HI>Knowledge</HI> or <HI>Science,</HI> falsly so called, doth puff up into Pride, and that is only that Knowledge which <HI>Paul</HI> said <HI>doth puff up.</HI> The holy Scripture doth greatly condemn <HI>Ignorance,</HI> and aboundeth with the praise of <HI>true divine Knowledge</HI>; and the <HI>true divine Wisdom</HI> inviteth men, <HI>To search and seek after her as for hidden Treasure.</HI> And wherefore are so many great and precious <HI>divine Mysteries</HI> wrapt up in the Savings of the holy Scriptures, but that men should search after them? for as it is the Glory of God to hide a thing, it is the Glory of a King (<HI>viz.</HI> who hath overcome his Lusts and ruleth over his own Spirit) to find it out, as the Scripture declareth▪ And it is one great part of the Spirits Work to open the holy Scriptures, and the deep things that are testified of in them: And Christ said, <HI>There is nothing hid that shall not be revealed</HI>; and God hath promised, <HI>That Knowledge shall greatly increase, even to fill the Earth, as the Waters fill and cover the Sea</HI>;
<PB N="3" REF="000691_0012_0FA9A0BA6CF14B78"/>
And the Prophets are commended in Scripture by <HI>Peter, That they searched diligently concerning the Coming of Christ, and his Sufferings, and the Time thereof, and the Glory that should follow.</HI> And therefore the right manner of seeking and searching after an Increase of true divine Knowledge, so as to understand many places of Scripture, both relating to Doctrines and Prophecies, to wit, by the help of Gods Spirit, accompanying all our endeavours, is both necessary and com∣mendable; for whatever many think of their Attainments in divine Knowledge, it is most certain, there is very much doth remain to be attained, beyond what the most knowing hath as yet reached unto. And tho' men may be good <HI>Christians</HI> who are not endued with great Knowledge of divine Things, yet the first Principles of <HI>Christian Doctrine</HI> are altogether necessary to be known to every true <HI>Christian,</HI> and if any be in danger to be exalted by the abundance of <HI>Revelations,</HI> as was <HI>Paul</HI>'s case, that is not to be imputed unto <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> but unto <HI>humane Weakness,</HI> for men may also be in danger to be lifted up with their Services and Sufferings, and other good Gifts of God; which proceedeth from humane Weakness.</P>
<P>Error 2. <HI>That we stand by Faith, and not by Knowledge; and therefore Knowledge of divine Mysteries is not necessary, nor much desireable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correction.</HI> The Scripture saith, <HI>We stand by Faith,</HI> but it no where saith, that we stand by Faith only, excluding Knowledge; and it is altogether unscriptural, as well as unreasonable to set <HI>Faith</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Knowledge</HI> in Opposition; for true Faith is not a blind assent to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Truth, but hath Knowledge accompanying it, and doth either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suppose or include it. And when the Scripture saith, <HI>VVe stand by Faith,</HI> it can have no further unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>standing than this, <HI>That Faith is an instrument and mean of our standing,</HI> for God and Christ is the prin∣cipal Cause and Author of our standing, and Faith the Instrument; and as <HI>Faith</HI> is one Instrument and Mean of our standing, <HI>Knowledge</HI> is another Instrument and mean of the same. And therefore <HI>Paul</HI> doth joyn <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Knowledge together,</HI> as mutual helps and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans of our standing and stability in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> (sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he <HI>we all come to the Vnity of the Faith, and knowledge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Son of God, unto a perfect man, &amp;c. that we be no more as Children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ossed to and fro with every
<PB N="4" REF="000691_0013_0FA9A0BB2C09C9D8"/>
wind of Doctrine,</HI> Ephes. 4.13, 14. And experience doth abundantly prove it, That true divine sollid Knowledge (as well as Faith) is a great mean and Instrument of mens being preserved in the Truth; for who are most ready and liable to be, carried away and tossed with every wind of Doctrine, but Ignorant and Unstable Souls, whom Sathan and his Instruments deceive, for want of true divine Know∣ledge; whereas men of sollid Knowledge and Understanding, and of a good Judgment in divine Things, are generally preserved sound and firm in the Way of Truth. And certainly <HI>Ignorance</HI> is the <HI>Mother of all Error of Vnderstanding</HI>; and as all Error is hurtful, so many Errors are exceeding hurtful to Mankind, when received. And since all Mankind is ruled and led into all their Actions by <HI>Perswasions,</HI> good or bad, it doth greatly concern all men to have <HI>sound</HI> and <HI>true Per∣swasions</HI> of things; for <HI>false Perswasions</HI> lead men to <HI>bad Actions,</HI> and the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay for men to be free of <HI>false Perswasions,</HI> is to have a good measure of <HI>sound Knowledge</HI>; for as <HI>false</HI> and <HI>evil Perswasions</HI> (the Daughters of <HI>Ignorance</HI>) mis-lead men, and cause them to go astray in their Actions, so <HI>good Perswasions</HI> (the Daughters of <HI>true Know∣ledge</HI>) lead men in the right way, wherein they should walk, and have a very great Influence upon the Actions of men, to make them good, and render them worthy and acceptable to God.</P>
<P>Error 3. <HI>That since God doth immediately reveal and teach People what is necessary to be known, as he taught the Prophets and Apostles, therefore there is little use of the Scriptures to such, and men need not much read or meditate on what they read in the Scriptures, for attaining divine Knowledge; it will come abundantly unto them without Reading, or outward Hearing, or Meditation, by divine Inspiration in silent Waiting upon God. And such who Preach need not read the Scriptures, to be so much as an Instrument to help them to preach; for Immediate Revelation, and Immediate Teaching, to such who are come to it, maketh the Vse of all Books, and all outward Helps needless and superfluous.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correction.</HI> It is a very wrong and false sence and understanding of <HI>Immediate Divine Revelation</HI> and <HI>Immediate Teaching of Gods Spirit,</HI> as if it did exclude or make void, in any measure, the use of the holy Scriptures, or any other outward means and helps of true Knowledge that God hath appointed; for the word [<HI>Immediate</HI>] is not exclusive
<PB N="5" REF="000691_0014_0FA9A0BBED47B0A8" MS="y"/>
of means but inclusive, so that the <HI>Spirit's inward Revelation</HI> and <HI>Illumination, Operation</HI> and <HI>Influence,</HI> must be joyned with all means and Instruments used by us, otherwise they are altogether ineffectual and unprofitable. And though frequently God doth give to his dear Children a sensible and experimental Knowledge of himself, in the enjoyment of his Love, Life and Power, and divine Goodness in their hearts, so as to feel, to savour and taste of the same, that exceedeth all Words and outward Testimonies, and Means whatso∣ever, and is oft communicated when their is no present use made of outward Means, of any sort, but in a deep and profound inward Silence, Quiet and Stillness of Soul; yet it is not always so, but as the Lord pleaseth he doth convey to the Souls of his Children the sensible and experimental Knowledge of Himself, and most precious Tastings and Feelings of his divine Love, Life and Power, and divine Presence, sometimes in the Use of outward Hearing▪ Reading, Meditation, Prayer, and sometimes in pure silent Waiting and inward Stillness.</P>
<P>But for the further opening and clearing the matter, let the following Things be well and duely considered,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> There is a twofold Branch of <HI>true divine Knowledge,</HI> one <HI>Doctrinal</HI> and <HI>Discursive,</HI> the other <HI>Sensible</HI> and <HI>Intuitive</HI>; These two are both most necessary to all <HI>Christians,</HI> and they contribute mutually the one to the other, and the <HI>Doctrinal Knowledge</HI> doth prepare the Soul to receive the <HI>Sensible,</HI> and is as the Husband-mans Labouring with his Instruments of Husbandry to raise Bread and other Provisions for him to eat.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Although the Knowledge of God, as a Creator, in great part, together with the Knowledge of many Duties and Sins, com∣mon to us with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> (who have not the Scriptures) may be had by us, only and altogether by inward divine Revelation, without the Scriptures (as the Experience of the <HI>Gentile</HI> Philosophers doth sufficiently witness) accompanied with their using the Books of Creation and Providence, who by the same did also attain to the Knowledge of many good and precious Truths, as of the <HI>Immortality of the Soul,</HI> and that there were <HI>Future Rewards for good men after Death,</HI> and <HI>future Punishments for bad men,</HI> yet the Knowledge of God in Christ, as he is come in the Flesh, and dyed for our sins and rose again for our Justification, and his Ascention into Heaven, and Intercession

for us in Heaven, and of his Return to judge the quick and the dead at the great Day, and of the Resurrection of the Body, both of Just and Unjust, with all other Doctrines peculiar to the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> as such, is not made known to us, in Gods ordinary way of working, by the <HI>Inward Teaching, Revelation,</HI> and <HI>Inspiration</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> without the use of the holy Scriptures, but in and through the same, as Instruments in the hand and management of the Spirit, inwardly inspiring, revealing, teaching and working, which yet may well be allowed to be (in a true sense) <HI>Immediate,</HI> not excluding, but including the use of the holy Scriptures, and all other Means and Helps of true Knowledge, as when a Master teacheth his Scho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lars both by word of Mouth, or <HI>vive Voce,</HI> and also maketh use of Books, and hath his Ushers, himself being also present, and teaching, together with them. And even the Prophets and Apostles in many things were helped and furthered in divine Knowledge by one another, and especially the latter by the former. But it is to be granted, that both the Prophets and Apostles were taught many things of Doctrine without all outward Teaching and Means whatsoever; but for us to presume to such a thing, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e taught the Doctrines of the <HI>Christian Faith</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> only by the Spirit of God, excluding the use and service of the holy Scriptures, is certainly to tempt God, and provoke him; and therefore men should be sober and wise in what they say or think in that matter. Nor is it at all safe for any in our Day to equal themselves to the Prophets and Apostles of God, who vvere made Instruments to commit to Writing the holy Scriptures, for they were extraordinarily chosen, fitted and endued to so great a Work, and had <HI>extraordinary Revelations,</HI> and vvere greater and more eminent Members in the Body of Christ than any of us are or can be. And if any think they can preach vvell enough without Reading or Meditating in the holy Scriptures: vvhen they speak in Tongues and Languages, that they never learned, and have other extraordinary Gifts, that the Prophets and Apostles had, it is time enough to believe them, but not till then; for vve find by experience, that the Words that men use in Preaching (how much soever they are endued and assisted by the Spirit) they have learned them and received them, more or less, by outward Hearing or Reading (unless it may be said, that some perhaps coyn some few words that are new and unusual) and every sentence of Scripture that they mention in

Preaching, they have received it either by outward Hearing or Reading, tho' oft men may forget when or how they did so receive them, and may not remember that some sayings of Scripture are really contained in the same, which hath occasioned some ignorantly to affirm, <HI>They had these Sayings and Sentences without all Hearing or Read∣ing of Scripture</HI>; which is their great mistake. God hath given the <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> to be a great Blessing and Help, as to all <HI>Christians</HI> in general, so to all Preachers, that out of the same, as out of a most rich Store-house, they may be furnished with whatever is profitable unto them, to preach to People for Doctrine, <HI>That the Man of God may be perfect, and throughly furnished unto every good Work</HI>; and it pleaseth God to accompany the Scripture Words in the Mouthes of faithful Preachers, and make them as Instruments and Conduits of his Spirit, and Life, and divine Power, and Presence; and certainly he is the best and most able Minister of the Gospel who is both <HI>Mighty in the Spirit</HI> and also in the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> and hath the Spirit of God and a <HI>spiritual Gift and Ability</HI> given him in the Spirit, in a Doctrinal way to open and expound them unto People, as well as to use them in <HI>Exhortation, Reproof, Correction, &amp;c.</HI> and therefore <HI>Paul</HI> did confess, <HI>That what was formerly writ was writ for his Learning, and his Brethren,</HI> and he desired <HI>Timothy, That together with his giving Attendance to the Gift of Gods holy Spirit in him, he would give himself also to Reading</HI>; and that surely was in the holy Scriptures, so much as then was extant. And <HI>Paul</HI> further declareth in the Epistle to the <HI>Romans, That the Preaching of the Gospel, according to the Revelation of the Mystery that was hid from the beginning of the VVorld, (viz.</HI> in great part) <HI>accor∣ding to the Commandment of the great God, was now to be made known to all Nations, for the Obedience of the Faith, by the Scriptures of the Pro∣phets.</HI> And <HI>Iohn</HI> declared, <HI>That what he had writ, was, that men might believe, and believing may have Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh his Name.</HI> It is a woful and hurtful Mistake to run so into Extreams, as many do, some wholly resting in the Letter of the Scripture, and neglecting, yea, blas∣pheming against the inward Teaching of the Spirit of God, Others, on a pretence of trusting to the Spirit, rejecting or slighting too much the holy Scriptures, and laying aside either altogether, or too much, the due Use of them. But the only safe way, is, to walk in the midst of both these dangerous Extreams, which is in the Leadings of the Lord, to j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yn both together, and to use the Scriptures in <HI>Reading,

Meditation, Preaching, Praying, Thanks-giving,</HI> as the Spirit of the Lord is felt to move, and accompany the due Use of them.</P>
<P>But although every true Minister of Christ is to read, or to hear some read to him, and to meditate or study in the holy Scriptures, by the aid and help of the holy Spirit inwardly enlightening and in∣spiring him, yet he ought not to prepare a Form of Words before-hand where-with to Preach or Pray, nor to speak in his own Will or Time what hath been formerly opened unto him, but as a good and faithful Steward in the House of God, and as a good Scribe instructed well in the things of Gods Kingdom, being well stored with Know∣ledge of divine Truth, and other Ministerial Induements and Qua∣lifications, he is to wait upon God in pure Silence of heart, to be guided by his Spirit, and feel the Motion and Opening of his Life, What, and When, and How much to speak; and the only best Pre∣paration for a Minister of Christ to Preach, is to be as a ready Instru∣ment in the hand and management of the Spirit, that Christ and the holy Spirit may speak in him to the Hearers, and may make use of his Heart, Understanding, Knowledge, Judgment, Memory, Mouth, Tongue and Lips, as his Organs and Instruments, and not otherwise; for only such Preaching doth avail, as having a Ministration both of <HI>Life</HI> in it to quicken, and of <HI>Light</HI> to enlighten the Hearts and Un∣derstandings of the Hearers: And here, as the Minister waiteth in pure Silence, the Spirit of God presenteth to him the Matter or Subject of his Preaching, and seasonably and livingly bringeth to his Remembrance what he hath formerly read or heard, or had opened to him by the Spirit, and oft also furnisheth him with many new, precious, living and refreshing Openings, that are both New to him∣self and the Hearers. And thus <HI>the good Scribe, instructed in the King∣dom of God, bringeth forth out of the good Treasure of his Heart, good Things, both New and Old.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' <HI>Doctrinal Truths of the Gospel</HI> are not revealed to men, in Gods ordinary way, without the Scriptures, concurring at least with the Spirit, as an Instrument and Organ, yet other things relating to the Souls inward state, and counselling them in the weighty Affairs of Humane Life, as in <HI>Marriage, Travelling from place to place, Calling to our outward Vocation in the World, &amp;c.</HI> and many the like Cases are made known to the Souls of such, by <HI>inward divine Revelation,</HI> who live and walk in great Tenderness, Sincerity, Humility and Nearness

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto God; but as for such who live too Carnally and Dissolutely, it is great Presumption to expect such Revelations, and too many deceive themselves with Imaginations, and are deceived with Diabolical Suggestions, which they imbrace as divine Revelations, for want of a due inward Purification of Soul, that clouds them so, that they have not a right discerning in such Cases, to distinguish betwixt <HI>Ima∣gination and Diabolical Delusion</HI> on the one hand, and real <HI>divine Inspiration</HI> and <HI>Revelation</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>And whereas it hath been affirmed by some, <HI>That they have known Doctrinal Truths of the Gospel so by divine inward Revelation, that they cannot allow the Scriptures so much as to have been the Instrument of the Spirit to give them that Knowledge, and should have known these things if they had never heard men, nor read on a Book.</HI> It is certainly too great Presumption, and greater Sobriety and Moderation in that case were more becoming and safe for them; for the plain tendency of that false Perswasion is to lift up into spiritual Pride and vain Glory, and to slight and neglect those means and helps that God hath graciously provided for them.</P>
<P>Error 4. <HI>That as God hath not absolutely Reprobated any Souls of Men, or decreed them before the World began to eternal or perpetual Destruction, so nor hath he Chosen any Souls of Men before the Foundation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the World to Holiness and Perseverence therein, and through Holiness and Perseverence in the same, to Everlasting Life; but hath left all Souls of Men to an indifferent Choice, either by an Indifference of Will to chuse Holiness, and Life Eternal, or Sin and Vnholiness, and Eternal De∣struction.</HI> And according to this Perswasion, <HI>as there is no Reprobation of any Souls, so nor is there any Election of any Souls, either to Holiness or Life Eternal, but all the Election of Souls is meerly Conditional, as to say there is such a state chosen of God, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correction.</HI> Although I am well perswaded there is no <HI>absolute Re∣probation</HI> of any Souls of the Children of <HI>Adam,</HI> or decree of Eternal Destruction past upon them that is absolute, but only such as is Con∣ditional and Relative unto their final State in Sin and Unbelief, yet I am well and fully perswaded, there is an Election of Souls and Seeds, that is certain, to wit, <HI>That God hath chosen all such Souls of Man∣kind who shall be saved from the beginning of the World, to the End of
<PB N="10" REF="000691_0019_0FA9A0C141E90380"/>
it, both to Faith and Holiness, as the means, and to Eternal Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Happiness as the End to be obtained by the said Means, and that in all Souls that are to be saved</HI>; although both Holiness and Eternal Life is to be their free Choice, yet that Choice is not a bare indifferent or contingent and accidental Choice, but God hath most certainly and absolutely purposed to work that free Choice in them, both to Holiness as the Means, and to Eternal Life and Happiness, as the End to be (in due time) obtained by the said Means. And this is the plain Doctrine of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> as is to me very plain and clear, and is made exceed∣ing Comfortable unto me, by a measure of the same Spirit that dwelt in him, and did distate these gracious Words through him, Rom. 8. <HI>For whom he did Fore-know, them he did Predestinate to be Conform to the Image of his Son; and whom he did Predestinate, them he Called, and whom he Called, them he Iustified, and whom he Iustified, them he Glorified.</HI> These Words are called by some, <HI>A Golden Chain,</HI> consisting of certain very sure and firm Links, none of them de∣pending on the uncertain Motion of the meer indifferent Will of Man, but on the free Love and Grace of God, given to Gods Elect in Christ Jesus before the World began. And agreeable to this is that of the same Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Ephes. 1.4. <HI>He hath Chosen us in Christ Iesus before the Foundation of the World, to be Holy and without Blame before him in Love.</HI> On which place <HI>Augustin</HI> well observed above Twelve Hundred Years ago, <HI>That it is not said, God hath chosen us for our fore-seen Faith and Holiness, but in hath chosen us To be Holy.</HI> So that our Faith and Holiness is who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly the Effect of Gods Election, and not at all the Cause or Condition of it. Which doth most excellently agree with Christs Doctrine, to his Disciples, saying, <HI>Ye have not Chosen me, but I have Chosen you, and appointed you to bring forth Fruit, and that your Fruit should remain.</HI> Where both <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Perseverance</HI> are the Effects of Christs Choice, by his plain Doctrine. Many other Scriptures might be cited to confirm this, but let this suffice.</P>
<P>And thus though we read, <HI>That God hath Chosen some to be Holy, before the VVorld began,</HI> yet we no where read that God hath appoint∣ed any to be Unholy; for mens Holiness is the Effect of Gods Love and Purpose; but mens Unholiness and Sin, and continuance therein, is only by Gods Permission, whereof they only, and not God, are the Cause; and therefore true Religion obligeth us to ascribe all our
<PB N="11" REF="000691_0020_0FA9A0C42C876618" MS="y"/>
Good unto God, but all mens Evil to themselves. And as for that <HI>Conditional Election,</HI> as it is not a Scripture Phrase, so it doth not agree with Scripture, but is contradictory unto it; for if such a <HI>Conditional Election were,</HI> it would be general or universal, and com∣prehend all Mankind; for why are one part more than another, see∣ing Eternal Life and Salvation are held forth Conditionally to all? but the Scripture no where holdeth forth a general Election, but only of <HI>some</HI>; and therefore Christ taught, that though <HI>Many are called, yet few are Chosen.</HI> Now this cannot be a <HI>Conditional Election</HI>; for it would not be good sense to say, <HI>few</HI> or <HI>some are con∣ditionally Elected.</HI> But whether God's Election be only Gods Decree, or some-what super-added by way of Effect to the same, as import∣ing a selection or setting a part certain Souls, as contained in <HI>Adam,</HI> to Everlasting Life and Happiness, in Christ their proper Head and Root, I shall not at present meddle to determine.</P>
<P>This so precious and comfortable Doctrine of <HI>Election</HI> ought not to be laid aside, as a thing either too hard to be understood or believed, or unprofitable, as some are ready to suggest. But on the contrary, it is a Doctrine worthy of all Acceptation, and such as giveth great occasion to all Gods Children exceedingly to love, praise and admire him for his peculiar Love and Fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, and peculiar Fatherly Care and Providence towards them; and this Use <HI>Paul</HI> maketh of it, writing to the <HI>Thessalonions,</HI> saying, <HI>But we are bound to give Thanks alwayes unto God for you, Brethren, because God hath from the beginning Chosen you, &amp;c.</HI> And if it be not opened to any, they are to pray to God, that he may open it to them by his Spirit, that so they may have the comfort and benefit of it. And if <HI>Election</HI> were only <HI>Conditional,</HI> why did <HI>Paul</HI> exhort Believers, <HI>To give all diligence to make their Calling and Election sure</HI>; for how can that which is only Conditional be made sure to some, more than others? Now he presseth them <HI>To make it sure,</HI> to wit, that they might have the assured Knowledge of it, not that it was not sure unto God; for as <HI>Paul</HI> hath declared, <HI>The Foundation of God standeth sure, having this Seal, &amp;c.</HI> and this Foundation is Gods Everlasting Love in his Son Christ Jesus, who hath loved and chosen them in him, as his Mem∣bers before the World began; and though th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y lapsed and fell from him their Head, yet he is sent of the Father to recover and save them all and every one of them, so that not one of his Elect shall be

utterly or finally lost, but all found, and recovered, and restored before the end of the World, so that not one Grain (<HI>Amos</HI> 9.9.) of his true <HI>Israel</HI> shall be lost; for they were given to him, and their Names are written in the Book of Life before the World began.</P>
<P>Error 5. <HI>That the Elect Seed is only Christ, and the Reprobate Seed is only the Serpent, or the Devil; and when any come into Christ by Faith, they come into the Election, and may be said to be Elected, but not before; but when they depart from him, or are not come to him, they may be said to be Reprobates.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correction.</HI> That Christ is Gods Elect, is most certain, according to Scripture; but as Christ is the Elect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, so he hath an Elect Body, and Elect Members, that were giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to him before the Foun∣dation of this World; And as he is that Elect Stone, living and precious, chosen of God for a sure Foundation, so there are many Elect Stones, that are to be built upon him, many whereof already are gathered and built on him, and many are yet scattered and un∣gathered, which are all in due time to be gathered unto him, and to be built upon him before the end of the World; <HI>for not one Grain of the Elect Body and Members of Christ shall be lost,</HI> see <HI>Amos</HI> 9.9. com∣pared with <HI>vers.</HI> 12. and many Thousands belong to Gods Election and are his Chosen and Elect, who yet are in a state of Unbelief, and not yet converted nor saved from sin, as is clear from <HI>Paul</HI>'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Doctrine, who hath affirmed, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. <HI>That many of the Vnbelieving</HI> Jews, <HI>who as touching the Gospel were Enemies,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>yet as touching the Election were beloved for the Fathers sake,</HI> and were in due time to find Mercy; And <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>He endured all things for the sake of the Elect, that they might be saved</HI>; which plainly proveth, That they are Gods Elect before they are saved, even when they are in a state of Unbelief and Impenitency. And it is absurd, and contrary to Scripture to say, <HI>A Man may pass from Election to Reprobation,</HI> as if Gods Election, and free electing Love and Grace, were a variable thing, and could change; for as the Scripture declareth, <HI>The Gifts and Calling of God are without Repentance</HI>; and this is said with a respect to Gods Election, both of <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> many of which were at that time remaining in Unbelief and Impenitency. Nor is the state of Unbelief and Impenitency, simply as such, a state of Reprobation,
<PB N="13" REF="000691_0022_0FA9A0C66E673DF0" MS="y"/>
so as all Unbelievers are Reprobated, in a strict sence▪ for how can men be said to be reprobated and rejected of God, while God is calling and inviting them by Motions and Allurements of his Love and Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in their Hearts, <HI>To come unto him?</HI> 'Tis then only Men become Reprobates, when their Day of Visitation is expired, and God doth cease to strive any more with them; and therefore a state of final Unbelief and Impenitency only, is (in a strict sence) a state of Reprobation, and none are Cast-aways or Reprobates but such as are le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of God to final Unbelief and Impenitency.</P>
<P>And though it is a true Opening that some have had, <HI>That Election and Reprobation are of Seeds, to wit, that there is an Elect Seed and a Reprobate Seed.</HI> Yet the Elect Seed is not only Christ, but all Souls belonging to him, that shall be saved from the beginning of the World to the end of it; and the Devil or Serpent is not only repro∣bate, but his whole Seed, and all such who at the end of the VVorld shall with him be cast into the Lake of Fire, which is the second Death; and these are called in Scripture <HI>Bastards, Tares, Dross; Goats, Dogs, Swine, and Vessels of Wrath fitted (or perfected) unto Destruction</HI>; as Gods Elect People are called in Scripture, <HI>Vessels of Mercy, and chosen Vessels, prepared or fore-appointed unto Glory,</HI> and <HI>Wheat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old, Sheep, Children of the Kingdom,</HI> and <HI>Sons and Daugh∣ters,</HI> even in their dispersed and scattered state and Condition.</P>
<P>And whereas some think that it will follow, <HI>That if some only be Elected, that others must needs be Reprobated, from Eternity unto Eternity.</HI> In that they are greatly mistaken; for <HI>Election</HI> signifieth only a <HI>Selection</HI> or <HI>Preference</HI> of some before others, and not an absolute Rejection of any, so as that God did hate any of his Creatures with an absolute Hatred, which is impossible; for God the Creator loveth all his Creatures, as they are his Workmanship, but his Love is more or less ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended and manifested unto them, or hid from them, according to their several states &amp; capacities; &amp; that the Love of God is more ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended and manifested to such who shall be saved from the beginning of the World to the end of it, than to such who shall not be saved, is a thing which all of good Understanding must and ought to acknowledge, to God Eternal Praise, who hath made one to differ from another.

And whence is it, but from God's <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Predestination</HI> that the Church of God hath continued in all Ages of the World, and shall continue to the end of it, notwithstanding all the Malice and Subtilty of Satan and his Instruments; for if God had left all men to their meer in∣different Choice to be Good or Bad, Holy or Unholy, it might

<P>Error 6. <HI>That in the Godhead, the Father, the Son and the holy Spirit, are but only distinct Names or Operations towards the Creatures, according to which</HI> it may be said, <HI>the Father is the Son, and the Son the Father, and the Father or Son is the holy Spirit, and the Father was born of a Virgin, and was crucified for us, and rose again; and also that the holy Ghost or Spirit was born of a Virgin, was crucified, dyed and rose again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correction.</HI> All which is exceeding false and corrupt Doctrine, and contrary to Scripture; for though the Scripture saith, The Father, the Son or Word, and the holy Spirit are one, yet it never saith, the Father is the Son, or the Son is the Father, or that the Word is the holy Spirit, but still holdeth forth a clear distinction in manner of being and relation, or Relative Properties betwixt them; for the Son doth not beget the Father, but is begotten of the Father from Everlasting, and the holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and from the Son from Everlasting; for many things are said to be one, when the one cannot be predicated or affirmed of the other; as the Soul and Body is one Man, and yet the Soul is not the Body; and Christ the Son, and the Father are one, by a most mar∣velous and high Union, surpassing all created Understanding, yet the Son is not the Father, but the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. And the Scripture doth not say, the Father was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, or the holy Ghost was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, but <HI>The Word was made Flesh,</HI> &amp;c. And though the Father, and Christ Jesus the Son, as he is God, be one Beeing or Essence and Substance with the Father, and of one Nature, yet as Christ is Man, he hath also the true Nature of Man, and his Nature as he is Man is not the Nature of his Godhead; and Christ as he came in the Flesh, the promised Seed of the Woman had two Natures, the one of his Godhead, the other of his Manhood, truly distinct, so that the one Nature is not the other, nor trans∣muted or changed into the other (which was the gross Error of the <HI>Eutychians</HI>) but most gloriously and inseperably united together for∣ever: And Christ now in Heaven hath his twofold Nature, the one of his Godhead, the other of his Manhood, so that his Godhead is
<PB N="16" REF="000691_0025_0FA9A0C8B004E090" MS="y"/>
cloathed with our Nature in Heaven, both of Soul and Body, most exceedingly glorified and exalted above all Angels; which is the ground of the Hope and great Consolation of all true <HI>Christians,</HI> as the Mystery of it is inwardly opened and revealed by the Spirit of Christ in their hearts, <HI>That he is in Heaven ever living to make Inter∣cession for us, and that he will change us and make us like to him, and receive us to be with him forever in Heaven, and that we shall enjoy him, and converse with him, as such, as our Head, Lord and King forever</HI>; For tho' he shall deliver up the Kingdom to his Father, yet not so as to abdicate or alienate it from himself, but to retain it, together with his Father in a more excellent manner than hath been witnessed, or is to be witnessed on Earth.</P>
<P>And whereas Christ is called in Scripture, <HI>The Everlasting Father,</HI> or <HI>Father of Ages,</HI> that is to be understood, That he is our Father, but not to confound that true Relation betwixt him and his Father. And when Christ is called in Scripture, <HI>The Lord that Spirit,</HI> and <HI>The second</HI> Adam, <HI>the quickening Spirit,</HI> This doth not give the least ground to confound that distinct Relation betwixt the <HI>Word,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> that proceedeth both from the Father and the Word; for the word [<HI>Spirit</HI>] some<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime hath a general Signification, according to which the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> are One holy pure Eternal Spirit, but frequently it hath a peculiar signification, especially when it is named in Scripture <HI>To Pneuma to Agion,</HI> i. e. <HI>That Holy Spirit,</HI> which is said both to proceed and to be sent from the Father and the Son. And though it is good and commendable not to admit the words of mans Wisdom, to apply them to this Mystery, yet the Mystery it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ought to be with great Religion and Reverence acknowledged, according to sound words of Scripture; and the right Knowledge and Faith of it is exceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>essary to every <HI>Christian,</HI> and the Faith of it is a necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> and of great service, both in it self considered, and as it conduceth to help us to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derstand other great parts and Doctrines of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> and it self is a Fundamental Doctrine of the <HI>Christian Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Error 7. <HI>That the Garden or Paradise where God placed Man when he made him, was some part of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is visible Earth that we walk upon, where</HI> Adam <HI>was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave wrought with Plough and Hoe, and have raised Grass and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Cattle to kill, and eat their flesh: And that
<PB N="17" REF="000691_0026_0FA9A0C96C7BB200" MS="y"/>
the Trees of the Garden were such as did grow on this visible Earth, called the dry Land; and the Serpent was some Snake, like the Snakes we see in the Woods.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correction</HI>; All this proceedeth from great Ignorance, and want of a spiritual Opening and Understanding of the holy Scriptures; for <HI>Adam</HI> by his Fall was drove out from the Garden to Till the Ground, from whence he was taken; and therefore it could be no part of the visible Earth; for what pleasant part is there on all this Globe of the Earth, which men have not access unto, both good and bad? Also, <HI>Paul</HI> telleth us, that when he was in Paradise he was caught up into it, whether in the Body or out of the Body he could not tell; and Christ, the Eternal Wisdom, is called, the Tree of Life, in Scripture, both in the Book of the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> and in the <HI>Revelation of Iohn; And to him that overcometh,</HI> it is promised, <HI>that he shall eat of it.</HI> And as man by his sin was drove out from the Garden, so many by their re∣turning from Sin, to Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by true Faith &amp; Repentance, and having overcome their Sins and Lusts, do in measure witness a Return into the Garden of God, and eat of the Tree of Life that is in the midst of the Garden, which <HI>Tree</HI> is the <HI>Life in Christ,</HI> the <HI>Word.</HI> And it may well be granted, that as <HI>Adam</HI>'s Soul was placed in a Garden, proper and suitable unto it, so his Body had its Garden of Pleasure, of a suitable Nature (which some refer to the Work of the First Day, being a Region and place of pure Light, whose Inhabitants were the Angels of Light, among which man was placed, being made a little lower than they) even as Christs Body hath its place in Heaven, and the Bodies of the Saints at the Resurrection of the Dead shall have their proper places in Heaven, which shall be a most pleasant Garden unto them. But the Garden where <HI>Adams</HI> Body was placed before the Fall, is hid from the Eyes of men; which because of their weakness and frailty, cannot behold it, and it is not to be revealed until the Resurrection of the Dead, so as to be seen with Bodily Eyes; for if the frail and weak Eyes of men can scarce behold the Glory of the visible Sun, how much less can they behold the Glory of the Garden of God, which is that New Earth that <HI>Iohn</HI> saw (not with his bodily Eyes, but with the spiritual Eyes in the Spirit) And as the New Earth is the Paradise for glorified Bodies, so the New Heavens is the Paradise for glorified Souls, and the Glory, Life and Virtue of which
<PB N="18" REF="000691_0027_0FA9A0CB1D2420F8"/>
is Christ, the Eternal Word, by which all things were created, and in which they consist. And that they are called <HI>New Heaven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>New Earth</HI> (altho' they were before this visible Earth) hath a weighty Reason in it, not obvious to many, for because they never wax old, and are not subject to any Corruption or decay, they are worthily called still New.</P>
<P>And that the Serpent was the Devil, is plain from <HI>Iohn</HI>'s <HI>Revelation,</HI> who calleth him, <HI>That Old Serpent the Devil.</HI> Moreover, that <HI>Adam</HI> was to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed the Ground either with Plow or Hoe to raise Grass or Corn, or feed Cattle in Paradise, or to kill and eat their Flesh be∣fore the Fall, is all false, and proceedeth from great Ignorance and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osness of Understanding. But some are deceived with the wrong Translation of the words, that say, <HI>God put the Man into the Garden to [dress] i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and to keep it</HI>; but the word [<HI>Dress</HI>] answereth not to the Hebrew, which signifieth, <HI>To Work in it</HI>; for it cannot well be understood, that it needed dressing, after the manner of our common Gardens. And mans Food, both for his Soul and Body, was to have been Paradisical, suitable to his glorious state wherein God made him.</P>
<P>Error 8. Others say, <HI>That as Christ was the Tree of Life, so the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil that was forbidden to Man, which was in the midst of the Garden, was the false Wisdom and Serpent's Sub∣tilty.</HI> Others say, <HI>Dry and dead Knowledge, without Life, was it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correction.</HI> But such little consider, that this Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, that was forbidden to <HI>Adam,</HI> did grow in the midst of the Garden, near to the Tree of Life; and how could the fals<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wisdom and Serpents subtilty, or dead and dry Wisdom, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> midst of the Garden. Others have had some better Open∣ing of it, <HI>That this Tree was good in it self, but not good for Man to feed upon.</HI> But to be sure the fallen Wisdom and Serpent's Subtilty was not good in it self, nor is the dry and dead Wisdom or Knowledge, that is empty of Life, good in it self: All that is only dross or shell. Now admit that Christ the Word is that Garden, and the Life in the Word is that <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> What is there in Christ that is good, but not for Food? Is it not the severe Justice and Wrath of God, called also in Scripture, <HI>The Wrath of him that sits upon the Throne, and of the Lamb</HI>; This is good, excellent and glorious, and yet it is not goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="19" REF="000691_0028_0FA9A0CBAE685348"/>
that Man should taste of it, or feed upon it, for it is of a killing Na∣ture. But such was the love of God to Man, that he would not have Man to know his Wrath and severe Justice, by any experience, sence, or feeling of it, as the fallen Angels had already known: He would have Man to know him in his <HI>love, wisdom, power,</HI> and all other divine Perfections and Virtues, signified by the Trees of the Garden, but not that he should feel or taste of his Wrath and severe Justice, and feed upon it; and this Man behoved to do, if he sinned against God, by turning away his love from his Maker, to the inordinate love of created things, that were below him; for this was Man's sin, his turning from God to the Creature, and from Light to Darkness, the which how soon he did, he could not but feel the Anger and severe Justice of God ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst him. So Man by his being forbid to feed on the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he was forbid to sin against God, by turning from God to the Creature; for Judgment and Wrath is the infallible consequent or concomitant of sin; and so by forbidding the one, he did forbid the other, as God did plead with <HI>Israel</HI> of Old, <HI>Turn ye, Turn ye, why will ye dye?</HI> for Sin brings Wrath and Death upon men. And as it is common for Parents to say to Children, <HI>Beware of the Rod, lest ye taste of it,</HI> which is equivolent with that, <HI>Do not Disobey.</HI> And thus the Lord by <HI>Moses</HI> set before the Children of <HI>Israel Good and Evil, Life and Death, saying, Chuse Life that thou mayst live.</HI> Now the same that is Life to the Obedient, is Death to the Sinner; The <HI>Word</HI> is one, but hath a twofold Pro∣perty, One of Life, to refresh and comfort the Obedient, Another of Wrath and Death, as a two-edged Sword to kill and afflict the Sinner; The one is the Property of Goodness, Mercy and Love, the other, of Severity, Wrath and Anger, which are one in the Word, but branching forth in a two-fold Property, as to men, according to the words in the <HI>Psalm,</HI> duely translated out of the He∣brew, <HI>Psal.</HI> 62.11, 12. <HI>God hath spoke one, two I have heard, Mercy belongeth unto God, and also Power,</HI> to wit, <HI>the Power of his severe Iustice and Wrath</HI> (for so the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word doth signifie) <HI>for he will render to every man according to his Works.</HI></P>
<P>Now what that sin was that the Serpent tempted Man to commit, may be understood by the like Tentation, wherewith he ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulted the Lord Jesus Christ, (as Man) upon Earth, which was, <HI>The Glory and lustfull Delight and Pleasure of this inferiour perishing World,</HI> above
<PB N="20" REF="000691_0029_0FA9A0CC6D83A068"/>
which God placed Man when he made him; but the Serpent wrought so mysteriously, that he presented it to Man (first assaulting the Wo∣man or Female part) as if it were some higher and better thing than what God had given him, and as if the perishing and mortal Delights of this fading sublunary VVorld were above the Pleasures of Paradise, and consistent also therewith, and should give him more Wisdom, and also more Delight and Pleasure. But in this he was a Lyar and Murderer, as Christ called him</P>
<P>And whereas after man's Fall, God said, <HI>Behold, Man is become like one of us, knowing Good and Evil,</HI> it was true that God said, but not in the Devil's sence, who deceived Man with a Lye and Equivocation; for after Man had sinned, he felt the Property of Wrath and Anger awakened in him, which he knew not before, and found himself to be an Angry Man, and in some sort he be∣came like unto God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note. That Anger is in God effectively, not subjectively▪ &amp; is not any inherent Accident or continge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Quality in God; for no Accidents or contingent Qualities can have place in God who is Most Perfect.</HI></NOTE> <HI>who is an Angry and Iealous God against Sinners,</HI> but Gods Anger is pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and holy forever; Whereas the Wrath and Anger of fallen Man is impure &amp; unholy. And though Man by his Fall know∣eth many things that he did not know before, yet it had been better for <HI>Adam</HI> he had not received such a Know∣ledge; for he knew himself Naked, Poor and Miserable, which was a Knowledge to his sorrow. But God in his infinite Mercy did so order it, That where Sin did abound, Grace should abound much more.</P>
<P>Error 9. <HI>That if</HI> Adam <HI>had not sinned, he should have dyed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odily Death, as Men now dye, and been subject to Bodily Sicknesses, and other Bodily-Weaknesses and Infirmities, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correction.</HI> All this also proceedeth from great Ignorance and want of a spiritual Opening &amp; Understanding of the holy Scriptures, and doth plainly contradict the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for it was not said to Man, when God made him, <HI>To Dust thou sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt return,</HI> but after his Fall; and the Scriptures Testimony is frequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, <HI>That Death, and all the Vanity and Calamity of this Mortal Life, is the Effect and Consequent of Sin</HI>; There∣fore are our days on Earth called, <HI>few and evil,</HI> and the <HI>Days of our Vanity,</HI> in Scripture; and the Scripture saith, <HI>By Man came Death, (viz.</HI> the first <HI>Adam) and by Man (viz.</HI> the second <HI>Adam,</HI> Christ
<PB N="21" REF="000691_0030_0FA9A0CD2D7928B8"/>
Jesus) <HI>cometh the Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> And as the Resurrection is that of the Body, as well as of the Soul, so the Death is the Death of the Body, as well as of the Soul; for when Man sinned, his sin defiled both his Soul &amp; Body, and therefore the Wrath of God was kindled against both, and both were to partake of the Punishment; for not only the Soul of Man suffered a great Degeneration from its primi∣tive Glory, but the Body also; <HI>So that Man being in Honour, and not abiding, became like the Beasts that perish,</HI> as the Scripture declareth. And seeing Mans Body before the Fall was not subject to any sort or Sickness or Death, it doth argue that the Glory of it before the Fall was very great, and indued with many excellent Gifts and Abilities of Beauty, Strength, Vigour, Agility, and quickness of Perception, far beyond what we are able to understand, being made Lord over all the visible Creation, and Works of Gods hands, as the prime Master-piece of his Workmanship, and crowned with Glory and Honour, as the Scripture declareth; and yet the glory of Mans Body before the Fall was exceeding inferiour to the glorified Body of Christ in Heaven, and to the glorified Bodies of the Saints at the Resurrection of the Dead; for his body was not spiritual, but Annimal; and being compared with Christ, as Man, he was but as a Figure, or Type of him that was to come, as <HI>Paul</HI> declareth, and was <HI>an Earthy Man, of the Earth Earthly,</HI> whereas <HI>Christ is the Heavenly Man, of the Heaven Heavenly,</HI> &amp;c. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. <HI>And as we have born the Image of the Earthy, so we shall bear the Image of the Heavenly.</HI> But even the Image of the Earthy was very glorious before the Fall; for tho' God made him of the Dust of the Ground, yet that Dust was not common Dust, but much more pure and refined than that of which the Bodies of Men since the Fall were made of.</P>
<P>Nor should it be strange, that <HI>Adam's</HI> Body (if he had not sinned) should not have dyed, but have been Immortal, tho' made of the Dust, when we believe that the Bodies of the Saints at the Resurrection of the Dead, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be raised up, and made Immortal, and mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h more glorious than <HI>Adam's</HI> Body before the Fall. But though <HI>Adam</HI> was not to have dyed a Bodily Death, if he had not sinned, yet it is not to be doubted but his Body in due time should have been changed, to∣gether with all his Posterity, from <HI>Earthly</HI> to <HI>Heavenly,</HI> and from <HI>Annimal</HI> to <HI>Spiritual</HI>; for such is the goodness of God towards his Creatures, that they are still to ascend to a higher Perfection, and
<PB N="22" REF="000691_0031_0FA9A0CDECA57180"/>
that endlesly, beyond the Condition of their first Creation.</P>
<P>Now if any will contend, <HI>That this Change which</HI> Adam <HI>was to undergo, was to be a sort of Death</HI>; I will not contend with them about words, for I love not to strive about words; but I say, it was not to be such a Death as Men now dye; nor do I find any thing in Scrip∣ture to warrant why it should be called Death.</P>
<P>But before I close this Head, I shall answer some few Objec∣tions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When God said to</HI> Adam, <HI>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely dye, he dyed not the Bodily Death that Day, but lived many Years after; and therefore that cannot be understood the Bodily Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. All the sad and lamentable Effects of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall are not set down particularly in these words that God spoke to <HI>Adam</HI> before the Fall, but only in general it was told him what should befall him thereby; but after the Fall the sad and lamentable Effects and Conse∣quences that should happen both to <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> are particularly declared, as, <HI>That she should conceive and bring forth Children with sorrow, and be under the Rule of her Husband</HI>; and <HI>That the Ground should be cursed for his sake, and</HI> (when he plowed or tilled) <HI>it should bring forth Thistles and Thornes; That in Labour he should eat of it, and in the sweat of his face should eat Bread, until he should return to the Earth from whence he was taken.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Though Bodily Death be not expressed in these words that God spoke to <HI>Adam</HI> before the Fall; yet it is understood, as well as the Death of the Soul unto Righteousness, and the enjoyment of God; for that very day wherein he Transgressed, Sentence of Death passed on him, and immediately he became subject to Death, and so was a dead Man by the Law of God, even as God said to <HI>Abimelech, Because of</HI> Abraham<HI>'s Wife thou art a dead Man,</HI> because he was to have dyed if he had done any Violence to her; and when a Criminal hath Sentence of Death past on him, he is a Dead Man in the Eye of the Law. And ever since the Fall, the Condition of Man's Bodily Life is such, that he is continually subject to the danger of Death; and so soon as Man is born, and begins to live in the World, he begins to dye; so that, as some wise Men have observed, Man's Life in this World is a <HI>Dying Life</HI> and a <HI>Living Death,</HI> according to the words, <HI>Dying thou shalt dye,</HI> see the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> Besides, so great a Death com∣ing on the Soul of Man by his Transgression, it could not but greatly
<PB N="23" REF="000691_0032_0FA9A0CEACACE7A8" MS="y"/>
affect and change his Body; and even his Body, as well as his Soul ceased to be a living Instrument to serve God, and was defiled by sin; and therefore behoved to partake of a suitable Punishment for the same.</P>
<P>And <HI>lastly,</HI> As it is observed by some, neither <HI>Adam</HI> nor any of his Posterity living a compleat Thousand Years, which in Scripture sig∣nifie sometimes a Day, <HI>Psal.</HI> 90. it may be said, he lived not a whole Day.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. <HI>If Bodily Death be the Effect and Consequent of Sin, then the Saints Death doth prove them Sinners; for the Effect not being removed the Cause doth remain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It doth not follow that the Saints Death proveth that they are still Sinners, otherwise they should still be sinners, even when de∣ceased; it only proveth that they have sinned, and that the Scripture plainly declareth, even <HI>That all have sinned, and that in</HI> Adam <HI>all dye, for that all have sinned.</HI> And as for that Maxime or Rule, <HI>That the Effect remaining, the Cause must remain</HI>; It holdeth not in all cases and respects, but admitteth of various Exceptions, and especially in de∣structive Causes it doth not hold, as when a man in his Drink burneth a House, it doth not follow that his Drunkenness ceasing, and he being become sober, that the House doth not continue burnt or destroyed. And to show the weakness of this Objection, that hath weight with many, it is generally acknowledged, That <HI>Adam</HI> needed no Garments or Cloathing before the Fall, and that our need of Cloathing, both to preserve us from Cold, and cover our Nakedness, is an Effect and Consequent of the Fall; and yet it will not follow that therefore such who have attained to a Freedom from Sin (by the Grace and Power of God) are to lay aside all use of Cloathing, and go Naked, altho' some Ungodly Persons have so practised, taking their ground from the like Reasoning.</P>
<P>Object. 3. <HI>Generation and Corruption, or to be born and dye, seem to infer one another; and therefore if</HI> Adam <HI>was to have had any Posterity by Humane Generation, if he had not sinned, nor they, it seemeth, they were to have dyed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That Generation here in this World, within the Planetary Sphere or System, where all things generated and brought forth, are under the Rule and Government of the Sun, Moon and Stars, as is obvious to all men of ordinary Understanding (in an ordinary way)
<PB N="24" REF="000691_0033_0FA9A0CF7016BAE0" MS="y"/>
doth infer Death and Corruption, is granted. But it is no wise probable that <HI>Adam's</HI> Body before the Fall was in the least subject to the Rule and Government of the Sun, Moon and Stars; for being placed in Paradise, and in a Paradisical state, both as to his Soul and Body, he was not subject to these things, but was above them, as it is said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 8. <HI>God hath set him [Over] the Work of his Hands</HI>; and that is not only the Earth, but Moon and Stars, and the visible Hea∣vens. And tho', no doubt, Man had access into this lower World, within the Planetary Sphere or System, and had great Power in it, yet he was not subject to any thing or power belonging to it; nor had his Life any dependance on any thing in it; nor (as some judge most probable) needed he to go out of the Garden where God placed him) to seek his Food; for the Earth or Soil of the Garden brought him forth Herbs and Food suitable to his Paradisical State; and conse∣quently, some expound the Herbs and Trees, given to Man for Food, before the Fall, to be Paradisical▪ <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.29. and the Earth Paradisical, distinct from this gross visible Earth, called, <HI>The Dry Land</HI>; which Distinction <HI>Origine</HI> gathereth from <HI>Haggai</HI> 2.6. and other places of Scripture; and so it will be t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the raised Saints, at the Resurrection of the Dead, who shall live and dwell in that Garden where <HI>Adam</HI> at first was placed, called, <HI>The New Earth, Rev.</HI> 20. And though they shall have the Command and Rule of this visible Earth, under Christ, their Head, yet they shall need nothing in it.</P>
<P>Error 10. <HI>That</HI> Adam <HI>and</HI> Eve <HI>were Naked before the Fall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correct.</HI> It is no where so affirmed in all the Scripture; for though they needed not any such Cloathing or Garments as Mankind com∣monly use since the Fall, yet it is very absurd and unreasonable to imagine that God created them Naked; for God who hath cloathed every Lilly and Herb of the Field with its proper Cloathing that hath its glory, no doubt cloathed the Body of <HI>Adam</HI> with a glorious Cloa∣thing, proper to his state; and therefore although Christ said con∣cerning <HI>Solomon, That in all his Glory (viz.</HI> of outward Cloathing) <HI>he was not arrayed like one of the Lillies of the Field,</HI> (because the Cloa∣thing of the Lillies was their own, but <HI>Solomon</HI>'s borrowed) yet it is no where said, That <HI>Adam</HI> in all his Glory was not arrayed like one of the Lillies of the Field. And the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word translated <HI>[Naked]
<PB N="25" REF="000691_0034_0FA9A0D048316D68" MS="y"/>
Gen.</HI> 2. is the same that is said of the Serpent, which is Translated <HI>[Subtil] The Serpent was more subtil than any Beast of the Field</HI>; and therefore it had been as well to have Translated the words thus, <HI>And</HI> Adam <HI>and his Wife were both [subtil] and were not ashamed,</HI> or to have translated the following words thus, <HI>And the Sepent was more [Naked]</HI> the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word [<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arum</HI>] being the same in both places. And <HI>Moses</HI> giving an Account of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Nakedness, and immediately subjoyn∣ing the Nakedness or Subtilty of the Serpent, and how he deceived the Woman, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> doth proceed very orderly, as first, telling, that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were Naked, and then immediately proceeding to give the cause or occasion of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the Serpent being Naked, having lost his cloathing, wherewith he was adorned at his first Creation, assaulted our first Parents, to have them made like him, to wit, <HI>Naked</HI> or <HI>Subtil,</HI> as he was.</P>
<P>And that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were not ashamed of their Nakedness, doth not imply their <HI>Innocency,</HI> but rather their <HI>Impudency,</HI> and too great Boldness that they had af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the Fall, until God called them, and caused his Light to shine and spring in their dark Hearts or Souls, and then they were both afraid and ashamed.</P>
<P>And that it is said after the Fall, <HI>They hid themselves among the Trees of the Garden,</HI> the <HI>Hebrew</HI> doth bear it, <HI>In a [Tree] of the Garden</HI>; And seeing this Garden was no part of this visible Earth, but that the Eternal Word, Christ Jesus was this Garden, and the Life in the Word was the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> and the many divine Virtues of the Word the <HI>Trees of it:</HI> That one Tree, in which our first Parents did seek to hid themselves, may well be understood to be the <HI>divine Mercy</HI> or <HI>Clemency,</HI> even as it is common to men at this day, after they have sinned, to fly to the <HI>divine Mercy</HI> for a hiding place; but the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God hideth no Impenitent Sinner; for men must first Re∣pent of their sins, and turn from them, before they can be hid in the Mercy of God; but at this Time <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had not repented of their Sin.</P>
<P>And it ought to be considered, how this whole Narration is a con∣tinued Allegory, and mystical or enigmatical way and manner of Speech; for as <HI>Moses</HI> put a Vail on his Face, so there was by the Wisdom of God a Vail drawn over his Writings, which was most convenient for that Time and Age; but now, under the clear Gospel Dispensa∣tion,
<PB N="26" REF="000691_0035_0FA9A0D21994BC90" MS="y"/>
the Vail is done away, and <HI>Moses</HI> Face is clearly seen, by such who are well taught in the School of Christ.</P>
<P>Now according to the Tenor of the Allegory, the <HI>Beasts of the Field</HI> are the <HI>Fallen Angels,</HI> which were without the Garden, as common Fields are without Gardens; and the <HI>Serpent</HI> that deceived <HI>Eve</HI> was one of the worst of these fallen Angels, to wit, the most Naked or Subtil of any of them.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Garden</HI> or <HI>Paradise</HI> is the Eternal Word, <HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> so the <HI>River</HI> that watered the Garden, is the <HI>Spirit of Life,</HI> that came out of <HI>Eden,</HI> where the Garden was planted.</P>
<P>Now, here the great Mystery of the <HI>Three,</HI> to wit, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> is secretly hinted at; for <HI>Eden</HI> signifieth <HI>Plea∣sure, Delight</HI> and <HI>Ioy,</HI> and in that did God beget and plant his eternal Word, and out of the same doth the Spirit proceed, as a most pre∣cious and large River; and afterwards, <HI>viz.</HI> from Christ the Garden, it is divided into four Heads, holding forth a fourfold Influence of that one Eternal Spirit to the four Quarters of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> North, East, South and West. Allegorically signified by four Rivers, <HI>Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel</HI> and <HI>Euphrates; Pison</HI> encompassing the whole Land of <HI>Havilah,</HI> where there is Gold, and the Gold of that Land is good, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which according to Scripture relateth to the North, <HI>for out of the North cometh Gold,</HI> as the Book of <HI>Iob</HI> declareth, the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>brew</HI> word being rightly translated: <HI>Gihon</HI> encompassing the whole Land of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> or <HI>Africk,</HI> which is known to be the South Quarter of the World; <HI>Hiddekel</HI> is expresly mentioned to go towards the East of <HI>Assyria</HI>; and therefore <HI>Euphrates</HI> remaineth to belong to the West Quarter of the World. Which cannot be outward and material Rivers, all rising from one Original River, for no such thing is to be found, as any material River dividing itself into four Branches, to∣wards the four Quarters of the Earth, and watering them; but the whole Passage is an Allegory, and the four fold Influence of the Spirit of God may well be understood to be four Rivers, as well as four Winds, according to <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.9. and the Waters of the Sanctuary running North, East, South, West, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 17. throughout.</P>
<P>But whereas some imagine, That <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> was that Paradise or Garden wherein <HI>Adam</HI> was placed, they are under a great Mistake, for <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> as is well known to all Geographers) lyeth only betwixt two Rivers, (to wit, <HI>Tygris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI>) and not four;
<PB N="27" REF="000691_0036_0FA9A0D27433D4A0" MS="y"/>
but Paradise or the Garden where <HI>Adam</HI> was placed, had but one River to water it, and neither two nor four; for the division of the River of Paradise into four Heads, was not within the Garden, but without it, as is most clear from <HI>Moses</HI> words, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.10.</P>
<P>And it is but a weak Reason that some give, why <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were Naked before the Fall, <HI>Because their being Naked is mentioned be∣fore the Serpent his Tempting the Woman to Transgress the Commandment of God</HI>; for the Order of the History is very proper, first to tell of their Nakedness, and then immediate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y proceed to tell of the cause and occasion of it, <HI>viz.</HI> The Serpent, who was also Naked, tempting <HI>Eve,</HI> and she prevailing with <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are many less mistaken to imagine, <HI>That the Coats of Skin wherewith God cloathed them after the Fall, were of the Skins either of Trees or Beasts,</HI> which is a groundless Conceit: But whereas the Man and his Wife, by sin had contracted a twofold Nakedness, one of the Soul, another of the Body, or one inward, the other outward, He provided a Cloathing to both, cloathing them inwardly with the Righteousness of the Lamb of God slain from the Foundation of the World, through th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Faith in him, and this was a skin or covering to cover their Nak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Souls; and cloathing them outwardly with the Skin and Flesh of this frail, mortal and corruptible Body, in many things resembling the Skin of a Beast, as <HI>Iob</HI> said, <HI>Thou hast poured me out as Milk; thou hast curdled me as Cheese, thou hast fenced me with Bones and Sinnnes, and covered me with Flesh &amp; Skin, &amp;c.</HI> And indeed many of the wise <HI>Gentiles</HI> did understand how this frail, mortal and corruptible Body, that is such a clog and weight to the Soul, hath happened unto Man by the Fall; therefore they have called it the Prison of the Soul, and compared it to a dark Cave and Dungeon; And as the <HI>Wisdom of Solomon</HI> hath it, <HI>The corruptible Body is heavy unto the Soul</HI>; and for this cause <HI>Paul</HI> called our Bodies of Fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, <HI>The Flesh of Sin, Rom.</HI> 8. saying, <HI>God sent his Son in the likeness of the Flesh of Sin</HI> (as the <HI>Greek</HI> hath it) so that when we but think on our flesh, we have occasion given us to think and remember of our sin and fall in <HI>Adam.</HI> Yet it is not to be questioned, but the true Body of Man lieth within the Shell, Oar or Mine of this gross, heavy and cor∣ruptible Body, and that is it which shall be the Resurrection Body, at the Resurrection of the Dead.</P>
<P>Now since the Body of Man had not this grosness and imperfection
<PB N="28" REF="000691_0037_0FA9A0D32E47A800" MS="y"/>
before the Fall, it is manifest that the manner of Mans Generation or Propogation had been after a far more excellent manner than now it is, if the Fall had not been.</P>
<P>Another great Mistake many are under, grounded on a mis-transla∣tion of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word, <HI>viz. That</HI> Eve <HI>was made of a Rib of</HI> Adam; but the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word is better Translated <HI>Side</HI> than <HI>Rib,</HI> as it is so Translated, <HI>Exod.</HI> 26.26, 27. <HI>cap.</HI> 30.4. <HI>cap.</HI> 37▪ 5. &amp; 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.13. In all which places it cannot, in any tollerable sence be translated <HI>Rib</HI>▪ but <HI>Side</HI>; The Woman therefore is one side of the Man, as to say, one half of him (as when a round or square Body is split or divided into two sides or halfs) and is not only Bone of his Bone, but Flesh of his Flesh. And she was called <HI>Isha</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language, which is to say, <HI>Taken from Man</HI>; for at first God made them Male and Female in one Flesh or Body, and aftewards divided them. But whether this Division or Seperation was made before or after the Fall, is much questioned by many, They who think it was after the Fall, bring this Reason for it, <HI>Because, Gen.</HI> 2.18. <HI>it is declared, that God said, It is not good that the Man should be alone, I will make man an Help meet for him.</HI> Now, how came Man to be alone, seeing at first they were made together, Male and Female, in One, and God blessed them with the Blessing of Fruitfulness, that they might multiply and re∣plenish the Earth? Also, seeing that God saw all that he had made, <HI>and it was very Good,</HI> as he first made every thing; how then cometh it, that it was not good for Man to be as he then was, if Sin had not occasioned a great Change in him? For it is not to be supposed that God is like to a Man, that maketh a piece of Work, and when he hath made it, doth not please him, as he at first made it, and there∣fore putteth it into another fashion. From all which they conclude, That the Woman being seperated from the Man, was a consequent of the Fall, and that therefore it was not good that Man should be alone, to wit, that his Wife should remain barren in him; for the Effect of then Fall was such, That they could not multiply their Species in one body, as they might have done, if the Fall had not been. And so, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that Manner of Propogating their Species or Kind, they became unfit and unfruitful, which is by way of Allegory expressed by some Mystick Writers, That their b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were joyned together, and their
<PB N="29" REF="000691_0038_0FA9A1F4C1959808"/>
faces averted, <HI>i. e.</HI> turned the one from the other; but when they were divided, their faces were set one to the other, according to the words in <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.18. <HI>I will make him an Help, as before him, i. e.</HI> face to face, so the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> And from this it is thought that <HI>Plato</HI> bor∣rowed his Account of Man's Formation, being both Man &amp; Woman in one Body, whom he called <HI>Androgynus,</HI> but because they offended their Maker, he divided them into two, setting them face to face, the one half being the Man, and the other half the Woman; and that therefore the Man loveth his Wife, as being the one half of him∣self.</P>
<P>And whereas some are ready to object, <HI>That this would seem to lessen the due esteem of Marriage, and humane Propagation, in the due use thereof, if Marriage was not appointed and ordained in</HI> Paradise.</P>
<P>To this they readily give <HI>Answer,</HI> That it doth no more lessen the due esteem of Marriage, to say, <HI>it was not ordained in Paradise,</HI> than to say, It shall be no Ordinance in the Kingdom of Heaven, after the Resurrection of the Dead, which Christ hath plainly taught us, <HI>That the Children of this World Marry and give in Marriage, but the Children of the Resurrection marry not, nor give in Marriage, neither do they dye any more.</HI> From all which some gather, That Marriage is an Ordinance of God, as a Remedy for Death; for if Marriage were not, Mankind could not be preserved upon Earth, in the regular and due way as God hath appointed. And it is sufficient to preserve the due Honour and Esteem of Marriage, that it is, without all doubt, the Ordinance of God to Men, during this Mortal state. And since Paradise was no part of this visible Globe of the Earth, it may well enough be al∣lowed, That <HI>Adam</HI>'s state in Paradise belonged not to this World, that is full of Trouble, where <HI>all things under the Sun are Vanity,</HI> as the Spirit of God hath declared by <HI>Soloman.</HI> Nor should it seem strange, that some of the Effects and Consequences of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall should be related by <HI>Moses,</HI> before the Cause of it; for this is very usual and common in all Writers, yea, <HI>Moses</HI> useth the same Method a little after in the same Book of <HI>Genesis,</HI> for in the tenth Chapter he telleth of the <HI>several Tongues of the Children of</HI> Noah; and yet in the begin∣ning of the 11th Chapter following, he telleth, <HI>That the whole Earth was of one Language,</HI> and so proceedeth to tell what was the Cause or occasion of the dividing of the Languages.</P>
<P>Another Mistake that many fall into is, <HI>That the six dayes of the
<PB N="30" REF="000691_0039_0FA9A1F57B755040" MS="y"/>
VVorld's Making, were Natural Dayes, such as our common Dayes from Sun setting to Sun rising again.</HI> But as both <HI>Origine</HI> and <HI>Augustine,</HI> and many others have well observed, it could not be natural Dayes, for there was no Firmament till the second Day, nor dry Earth till the third day, nor Sun, Moon or Stars till the fourth day; and therefore these Dayes were not common Natural Dayes, but are mystically to be understood; for God called the <HI>Light</HI> Day, and the <HI>Darkness</HI> he called Night, and therefore every one of these six Days is Light, and not the precise time of twenty four Hours betwixt sun and sun.</P>
<P>And whereas it is said, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. <HI>That God planted the Garden East∣ward in</HI> Eden, many Translators do translate the word, <HI>from the Begin∣ning,</HI> from whence <HI>Ierom,</HI> and others do conclude, That <HI>Paradise,</HI> or that Garden was no part of this visible World or System; for the most glorious part of this visible System is the Firmament, Sun, Moon and Stars; and the Firmament was made the second Day, and the Sun, Moon and Stars the fourth day.</P>
<P>And they do as greatly Err who say, <HI>This visible World was made of Nothing</HI>; for as no place of Scripture saith so any where, but doth contradict it, so it is a most improper manner of Speech, seeing of Nothing nothing can be made; for Nothing is no cause of any thing: Whatever is a Cause, must have some Being it self.</P>
<P>And as concerning the Making of this World, <HI>Moses</HI> giveth us the Account, <HI>How that the Earth was without Form, and void,</HI> in the Hebrew it is <HI>Toha va Bohu,</HI> and in the Septuagint it is <HI>Aoratos,</HI> i. e. <HI>Invisible,</HI> according to which it is said, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.3. <HI>Things that are seen, or Visible, were not made of Things Apparent.</HI> So that this whole visible World did proceed or come from some-what Invisible. And we ought to distinguish, according to Scripture, betwixt things Created, Formed and Made: Things made pre-supposeth Things Formed; and Things Formed pre-supposeth Things Created, in the greatest Propriety of Speech (altho' at Times the one is put for the other) And tho' Things Created have no Cause but God Almighty, yet they are not properly said to be of <HI>Nothing</HI>; for <HI>Of Him</HI> (to wit, God) not as a Material, but an Efficient Cause) <HI>and Through Him, and To Him are all Things.</HI> But why the Earth that God Created (without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prae-existent Matter) came to be <HI>Without Form,</HI> and <HI>Void,</HI> de∣serveth a serious Consideration.</P>
<P>And whereas it is said in Scripture, <HI>That the Earth was Cursed for
<PB N="31" REF="000691_0040_0FA9A1F630C7EA40"/>
Man's sake</HI>; some run so far into the Extream of an Allegory, that by the Earth that was cursed, and was to bring forth Thornes and Thistles for Mans sin, the outward and visible Earth was by no means to be understood, not in any tollerable sence or respect, alledg∣ing, <HI>That Thornes and Thistles being a part of the Creation, are good Creatures after their kind, as other Herbs and Veget<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bles</HI>; and there∣fore by the Earth that was cursed they will have only to be under∣stood Man's own Earthly Nature. But this proceedeth from great Ignorance; for at this rate they might as well say, the Frogs and Lice, with other Plagues and Judgments inflicted upon <HI>Pharoah</HI> and the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> were only within them, and not without them, for Frogs and Lice are a part of the Creation, as other Annimals are▪ But first it may be questioned, Whether all Vegetables and Annimals, that are now in being, were created or made upon the Earth, before <HI>Adam's</HI> Fall, or only the more perfect sort of Vegetables &amp; Animals? for it is certain that Mules were not from the beginning, being gene∣rated of an unnatural Mixture of a Horse and an Ass? But <HI>secondly,</HI> waving that part of the Question, Whether Thorns and Thistles did grow on the Earth before <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, it is most certain that Barrenness and Unfruitful Seasons came as Judgments upon the Earth for mens sins; for the Scripture declareth, <HI>That God turneth the fruit∣ful Land into a barren Wilderness for the sins of Men that dwell therein:</HI> and Experience proveth it, That the Land of <HI>Iudea</HI> is not near so fruitful as formerly it was; and it is the Nature of barren <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and to bring forth Weeds, Thistles and Thornes, and other unprofitable Vegetables, that are good for little but to be burnt. And whereas God said to <HI>Adam, Thornes and Thistles shall it bring forth unto the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; it holds forth, That even such a part of the Earth, as <HI>Adam</HI> should la∣bour to bring forth Corn for Bread, should together with Corn bring forth plenty of Weeds, as Experience fully proveth. And as the Frogs and Lice that were sent to the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> were the Works of God, (but as the Effects of his Wrath &amp; Displeasure) so the like may be said of the Thornes and Thistles that these parts of the Earth, (which Man was to have Tilled) were to bring forth, as they are the Works of God, so they were the Judgments of God, and the Effects of his Wrath; as the like may be said of great Devastations by Floods, Thunder, Lightning, Earth quakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich, tho' they have no Moral Evil in them, yet are the Judgments of God in∣flicted
<PB N="32" REF="000691_0041_0FA9A1F6F50188C8"/>
on men, because of sin; yea, what are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Diseases but Judg∣ments and Corrections from the Hand of God, which though they have no moral Evil in them, yet have in them an evil of Punishment, and so have Frogs, Lice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which are parts of the Creation, as well as Thornes and Thistles. Therefore it is certainly a great and hurtful Error for any to hold, <HI>That the outward and visible Earth was not Cursed for Man's sake</HI>; the which Curse returned unto Man; for seeing Man's Body is a part of the Earth, it did also partake of the same; hence come the many Diseases upon the Body of Man, that partly take their Rise from the Fruits of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arth, which Man eateth and drinketh. And these also, as well as his Earthly Thoughts and Desires, and Lusts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a part of these Thorns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thistles that the Earth bringeth forth unto him.</P>
<P>Error 11. <HI>That</HI> Adam <HI>and</HI> Eve<HI>'s Fall and Sin, with the Woful Effe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts and Consequences of it, did only concern themselves, but that no Damage did come to their Posterity thereby, nor any Defilement of Sin or Depravation and Corruption of Mans Nature is derived from</HI> Adam <HI>unto them; but that Infants universally come into the World (out of their Mothers Belly) pure and undefiled, and in all respects the same as if there had been no Sin nor Fall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correct.</HI> This is certainly a great and hurtful Error, contradicting not only the Scriptures Testimony in many place, but also manifest Experience; for we find too generally, That the Nature of Children is corrupted from the very Womb, and that great abundance of bruitish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Inclinations have too much place in them before they arrive at the Years of Discretion, so as to have the due Exercise of sound Understanding, to judge betwixt Good and Evil, or of a free Choise of Will, either to imbrace the Good or refuse the Evil; as also that great Aversion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Unaptness that we find in Children generally, even when Parent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> take great Pains upon them, to give them a Godly and Religious Education, to imbrace the way of Virtue, and of a Godly Life; and on the contrary, a great Readiness in them to follow evil Wayes and Courses. All which do manifestly demon∣strate, from sad Experience, the Defilement and Corruption of the Nature of Man in Children, and that they need to be renewed, wash∣ed and sanctified, and spiritually born again, before they can enter
<PB N="33" REF="000691_0042_0FA9A1F7B8298870"/>
into the Kingdom of God; for if Children were sanctified from the Womb, and that all Infants were Saints, while Infants, surely more of it would appear in them, than doth, and the favour of the divine Life (which is in all that are sanctified) would be more savoured in them, by all who have a spiritual Discerning &amp; Savour in themselves; but the contrary is so far true, that in most of Children, before they pass the Years of Infancy, many Godly P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rents find and observe, yea, and feel that in their Children, which is cause of sorrow and grief unto them, and of great Humiliation, to see and find so much of the bruitish Nature prevail in them, as most frequently doth; so that the very fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Inclinations that appear in many Children, not past the Years of Infancy, are to lye, to steal, to fight and speak un∣savoury words, which they are more ready to learn than what is good.</P>
<P>Next, As to the Scriptures Testimony, it is plain, <HI>That in</HI> Adam <HI>all dye, and that by that One Offence, Iudgment is come upon all unto Condemnation.</HI> And <HI>David</HI> doth plainly acknowledge, <HI>That he was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did his Mother conceive him,</HI> Psal. 51.5. And therefore our Flesh that we receive from our Parents, is called by <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 8. <HI>The Flesh of Sin</HI>; for he said, <HI>God sent his Son in likeness of the Flesh of Sin</HI> (so the <HI>Greek</HI>) and that under the Law the fore-skin of the Flesh in Infants was to be cut off by Circumcision, and an Offering was to be made for them; and the Mother doth suffi∣ciently prove the Defilement of Nature in them, and that a Principle or Seed of Sin and Evil is lodged in them; which even <HI>Plato</HI> a Heathen Philosopher did acknowledge, saying, <HI>There was an ingrafted or innate Evil in men,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Nor is it a sufficient Argument against the Doctrine, because it is difficult to many to satisfie their Reason how this Defilement or Corruption is conveyed from <HI>Adam,</HI> and other intermediate Parents, to the Children; for there are many other things that are true, and necessary to be believed and acknow∣ledged by all, and yet all, or perhaps most cannot satisfie their Reason about them.</P>
<P>But for the better clearing of this weighty matter, let the follow∣ing particulars be well considered.</P>

<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> As we dyed in <HI>Adam,</HI> so we sinned in <HI>Adam</HI>; for Death being the effect of Sin, we could not have dyed in him, if we had not sinned in him; and if we sinned in <HI>Adam,</HI> we were contained in <HI>Adam.</HI> But as for that subtil and unintelligible Distinction, That our Souls were contained in <HI>Adam,</HI> not formally and actually▪ but virtually, or not having a formal or actual, but a virtual Existence, it is more safe to let it alone, and hold to the words of Scripture, especially seeing they who talk of that Distin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion, of a <HI>Virtual</HI> and <HI>Formal,</HI> or <HI>Actual Existence,</HI> can hardly make it intelligible to any, far less to vulgar Capacities, who are not acquainted with Philoso∣phical and School Distinctions.

<P>It is but a weak Objection that some make, saying, <HI>How could so many Thousand Souls, as do belong to</HI> Adam's <HI>Posterity, be contained in him?</HI> For such do not consider nor understand, that Souls being Spirits, and not Bodies, do not croud and jostle for room, as Bodies do.

<P>Nor hath that other common Objection▪ that many think so strong as if it were unanswerable, any great weight, <HI>That they see not how the So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of</HI> Adam<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Posterity, that were contained in him, could or did con∣sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, or had any Knowledge thereof, seeing they retain not any Remembrance thereof.</HI> For as we do not remembr that we sinned in <HI>Adam,</HI> by acting with Knowledge or Consent, so nor do we remem∣ber that we were in in him at that time, any more than <HI>Levi</HI> re∣membred after he was born, that he was in the Loyns of <HI>Abraham,</HI> or paid Tythes in <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>Melchisedeck</HI>; which yet the Scripture plainly affirmeth.

final and irrevocable Loss, nor to Hell Fire, and Punishment that Devils and Wicked Men are to undergo at the Day of Judgment; neither doth it so extend to Infants, or any part of Mankind, simply for <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin, so as that any shall be finally condemned for the same. And consequently none dying in a state of Infancy do perish, or shall be lost simply for that first sin; for as Christ hath plainly taught, <HI>The Condemnation of the World, is not simply that men sinned in or with</HI> Adam, <HI>but that Light is come into the World,</HI> after that Death and Darkness is come upon them, <HI>and men love Darkness rather than Light.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5<HI>ly.</HI> But what is Gods Way and Dispensation towards all such who dye in a state of Infancy, as many Thousands so dye, seeing they are not fit nor qualified for entring the Kingdom of God, without be∣ing renewed and born again, and seeing to be renewed and born again, or to be sanctified and cleansed from all Sin and Defilement, and to be made Holy and Righteous, and replenished with all divine Virtues and Fruits of the Spirit, requireth our joynt concurrance, as <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> to work together with God, and Christ, and the holy Spirit. And that Children, while in a state of Infancy, that know not the Right Hand from the Left, seem not capable to act or work in order to their Sanctification, Is a Difficulty that doth generally pinch and straiten all to answer it, Let it therefore suffice at present, to say, God hath wayes to deal both with Young and Old, and to dispose of them, according to his great Mercy, Goodness and Long-suffering, far beyond what the wisest of men are able to conceive or comprehend▪ And seeing the <HI>Love, Mercy, and Long-suffering of God</HI> is extended unto all, and God hath so ma∣nifested his Love, that <HI>He hath given his dear Son Christ Iesus to taste Death for every Man,</HI> and that such who dye in Infancy are a very great and considerable part of Mankind, it is most equal and con∣venient for us to judge Charitable of all dying in a state of Infancy, or who have had but little time to live in the World, and have been as the Grass that is mown and cut down before it be near ripe, even as when in the Bud, and who are taken away in the Morning, as it were, of their Day, that the <HI>Most infinitely good, gracious, merciful, wise and just God,</HI> dealeth so with all such, as to supply the present Defect and want of Time, and other weighty Circumstances denyed unto them, that others have plentifully had, after some sufficient

<P N="6">6<HI>ly.</HI> It is manifest, both from Scripture and Experience, That the Seed and Principle of sin and defilement, conveyed both from <HI>Adam,</HI> and other intermediate Parents, hath had greater place in some than in others of Mankind. Hence it is that the Posterity of <HI>Cain</HI> was more defiled than that of <HI>Seth</HI>; and the Posterity of <HI>Ishmael</HI> and <HI>Esau,</HI> more than that of <HI>Iacob</HI>; and the <HI>Moabites, Ammonites</HI> and <HI>Cananites,</HI> with the adjoyning Nations, were more defiled in their Seed and Posterity than the <HI>Israelites</HI>; therefore God did forbid the holy Seed of <HI>Israel</HI> to mix with them in Marriage; and an <HI>Edomite</HI> was not to enter into the Congregation of <HI>Israel (viz.</HI> by Marriage) until the fourth Generation; nor a <HI>Moabite</HI> until the tenth. And though there was great Defilement in the Line of <HI>Israel,</HI> yet because it was not generally so defiled as that of the other Nations, it was called <HI>Holy</HI>; and the Children of Unbelievers are called <HI>Vnclean</HI> by <HI>Paul,</HI> but the Children of Believers (where both or one of the Parents believe) are called <HI>Holy,</HI> because that the holy Seed that is in them is not so vailed and loaded generally with sin, as it is in the Children and Posterity of Unbelievers; and our Experience proveth, That some Children are born into the World with excellent Inclinations to Wisdom and Virtue, that soon appear in them, far beyond others. But this, and many other things relating to this Head, are to be left to the Lords further Opening, which he will do in his good time; for he will cause his Light to shine more &amp; more unto the perfect Day.</P>
<P>And as the denying▪ That <HI>Adam</HI>'s Posterity partake of any Seed or Principle of Sin and Corruption, by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall; together with the woful Effects thereof, is a great Error, so it is very hurtful, and of very evil consequence to entertain it; for it makes People think less evil of themselves than they should▪ and so tends to make them proud: And as it is not good not to see the Root of a Disease, so nor is it good, but hurtful, not to see nor understand the root and beginning of our Misery; but the true sight and knowledge of our fall and loss in <HI>Adam,</HI> and of that Seed and Principle of Sin and Lust, called, <HI>The Old Man,</HI> in Scripture, conveyed to us by the Fall, doth
<PB N="38" REF="000691_0047_0FA9A1FB723F20F0" MS="y"/>
really tend to humble us, and excite us the more earnestly to contend against sin, knowing, that the longer it hath had place in us, and the more deeply it is engrained in our Nature, it is requisite we strive with the more force, and use the greater Diligence to overcome it. Besides, it h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th this other evil Tendency, that if it be believed <HI>That Children are born clean and pure, and partake of no hurt or damage by</HI> Adam<HI>'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fall,</HI> as the <HI>Pelagians</HI> of Old, and some of late believe, it makes Parents, who do so believe, slack and remiss to use due Nur∣ture and Discipline towards their Children, and so fall short in givi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g them due Education; for if there be no wild and bruitish Nature in Children, there need no Pains to be taken upon them to subdue it in them; all which is of bad Consequence. Nevertheless, it is to be acknowledged, that some Children have very good, and virtuous, yea, and pious Inclinations from their Childhood, through the great Mercy of God, yet accompanied with some Imperfections, that sufficiently declare, that generally, more or less, <HI>Adam</HI>'s Posterity have suffered great Damage by the Fall. And that <HI>Iohn the Baptist</HI> and <HI>Ieremiah,</HI> or any others, as <HI>Moses, &amp;c.</HI> were sanctified from the Womb, being rare and extraordinary Cases, doth plainly evince the general Corruption that hath seized on <HI>Adam</HI>'s Posterity. Nor is it to be allowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any one born of a Woman, hath been born clean and free of all Stain and pollution of sin, in all respects, but only our Lord Jesus Christ, who was born of a Virgin, and made like to us in all things, but without all sin.</P>
<P>Error 12. <HI>That the only means of Mens Salvation is the Light of Christ, the living Word in them, only as it convinceth of common Sins, and instructeth men universally of common Duties in a way of common and general Illumination that is common to all Mankind, whether called</HI> Jews, Heathens <HI>or</HI> Christians. <HI>And that the said common Illumination and Law writ in the hearts of men universally, is the only Gospel, and the All and Whole of it, and the New Covenant and Power of God unto Salvation in the full extent of it, without all respect to Faith in Christ come in the Flesh,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Correct.</HI> Although it is worthily granted, That Christ is the Light of the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, and doth lighten every Man that cometh into the World with a divine and supernatural Light, that is of tendency
<PB N="39" REF="000691_0048_0FA9A1FC326E8D90" MS="y"/>
unto Salvation; and that Christ the Light of the World, who light∣eth every Man, is a sufficient Saviour; yet his inward Coming and Appearance in mens Hearts is not to be set in Opposition to his Outward Coming in the Flesh, as he dyed for our sins and rose again for our Justification, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exalted at the Right Hand of God to be a Prince and a Saviour, and who ever liveth to make Intercession for us, and is our Advocate with the Father. And though Christ the Light be one, yet he hath divers wayes and manners of divine Illumination, whereby he enlightneth the Hearts and Souls of men. Hence God is called in Scripture, <HI>The Father of Lights:</HI> And as the High-Priest under the Law did bear on his Brest <HI>Vrim,</HI> i. e. <HI>Lights,</HI> and <HI>Thummim,</HI> i e. <HI>Perfections,</HI> who was a Type of Christ, our heavenly High-Priest, made higher than the Heavens, so Christ Typified thereby hath the <HI>Vrim</HI> &amp; <HI>Thummim,</HI> i. e. <HI>Lights</HI> and <HI>Perfections</HI>; which he distributeth variously to the Children of Men, according to their several States, Conditions and Capacities; and therefore though the Light be one fundamentally and radically, yet it brancheth forth into divers Pro∣perties, and Operations, and Manners of Workings; and as it is received, followed and obeyed, it hath its divers Perfections, answer∣able thereunto. And therfore all faithful <HI>Christians</HI> are otherwise enlightned than either <HI>Iews (viz.</HI> who are not <HI>Christians</HI>) or <HI>Turk,</HI> or <HI>Heathens,</HI> be they ever so faithful or upright in the state they are in, for all true <HI>Christians</HI> have such a divine Illumination from Christ, as doth illuminate their Hearts and Understandings, to understand and believe That great Mystery of Godliness, <HI>God manifest in the Flesh,</HI> or Christ come in the Flesh, of the Seed of <HI>David,</HI> the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> as he dyed for our sins and rose again for our Justifica∣tion, and is gone into Heaven, and there doth appear in the Presence of God for us. And who are thus enlightned and quickened to know Christ, and believe in him as he dyed for them and rose again, they have a good understanding of the Love of God, and of Christ; and the Mystery of Christs Death, Resurrection, Ascention, Intercession, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is inwardly opened and revealed unto them.</P>
<P>And so, Christ thus revealed, known and believed in, both as in respect of his inward and outward Coming, is the Foundation of their Faith, Hope, Love and Obedience, and all <HI>Christian</HI> Virtues; and the Love of God and Christ, as it is so known and believed, to wit, as God gave him to dye for us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and as he most freely and
<PB N="40" REF="000691_0049_0FA9A1FCF787A320" MS="y"/>
willingly offered himself, is a most excellent Motive or moving Cause and Inducement to love God and Christ, and also of our whole Obedience. And to whom soever this Knowledge and Faith of Christ doth come, (which cometh not by bear Hear-say or R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>port, but by the Working of the mighty Power, which raised Jesus our Lord from the Dead) there doth accompany greater Grace and Power, to in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>line to Love and Obedience, all <HI>True Christians,</HI> than what any of the most upright of either <HI>Iews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who have not the Faith of Christ crucified and raised again, are Partakers of. Hence we read in Scripture of the <HI>Manifold Grace and Wisdom of God,</HI> and the <HI>Diversity of Operations, Administrations and Dispensations of divine Gifts,</HI> but <HI>One God, One Lord, and One Spirit:</HI> And though that common Illumination of God and Christ, that is universal to Men, be really Divine and Supernatural, and so good and excellent in its kind, and hath a preparatory Tendency to eternal Salvation, yet it doth not save with eterna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Salvation any who remain only under it, and proceed no further, so as to witness that more special and peculiar Grace and Illumination, proper to true <HI>Christians</HI>; for no Illumination is able to save fully and perfectly with Eternal Salvation but that which giveth the Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified and raised again, and doth open and reveal the Glory of Gods Love, Wisdom, Power and Justice, in giving his Son to dye for us, and raising him from Death, to be a <HI>Prince</HI> and a <HI>Saviour</HI> unto us.</P>
<P>And though it may and ought to be well granted, <HI>That the Gospel is preached in every Creature under Heaven in some measure or degree,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lso, <HI>That the Gospel Seed and Principle▪ even the Word of Faith, is nigh to every one, and in every one</HI>; yet it is not so fully revealed in every man, as doth at once sufficiently reveal the whole Mind, Council and Will of God concerning mens Eternal Salvation and Happiness; for Christ hath been the Mystery hid from Ages and Generations, <HI>viz.</HI> in great part from the generality of Mankind, who have had that common divine Illumination, and yet have not duely and sufficiently known him: And whoever did know him, as such, in any Age or Generation, as many did, even from the begin∣ning of the World, they had that Knowledge and Faith of him by special Grace and Favour, and by special Revelation. And as for that common Illumination that is general and universal unto all Mankind, it is more Legal than Evangelical, and doth more belong to the Law

and first Covenant, than to the second; and therefore is not the Only Gospel, nor the all and whole of it, but at best some low and small Manifestation of the Gospel, that yet is of excellent Service to all who are faithful under it, so that they cannot perish; and it is tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which <HI>Paul</HI> calleth the <HI>Law, that is a School-Master, that leadeth unto Christ:</HI> and as <HI>Iohn</HI> outwardly was a Fore-Runner of Christ as he came outwardly in the Flesh, to prepare the Way before him, so this General and Common Illumination of Christ, to all who faithfully Obey it, is a Fore-Runner to prepare the Way for that more special Illumination and Revelation of Christ given to all true <HI>Christians,</HI> that doth open unto them that great Mystery of <HI>Christ come in the Flesh, His Death, Resurrection, Ascention, Intercession,</HI> and as God hath ap∣pointed him <HI>to be the Iudge of the Quick and the Dead,</HI> even the Man Christ Jesus, and constraineth the Hearts of all <HI>True Christians</HI> the more abundantly, and with a more excellent and pure Degree of Love &amp; Obedience to love &amp; serve God and Christ, than what any of the most Upright <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in their meer <HI>Gentile-state</HI> did attain unto. And therefore though <HI>Corneliu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was in a good state, as to God, before <HI>Peter</HI> was sent to preach to him the <HI>Faith of Christ crucified,</HI> yet he was not to rest in that state, but to be perfected by the Faith and Knowledge of <HI>Christ crucified,</HI> by which he received the Holy Ghost, and the Assurance and assured Knowledge of the Remission of his Sins by Christ, and of Eternal Salvation by him; therefore the Angel told him, <HI>That</HI> Peter <HI>should preach words to him, by which he and all his House should be saved,</HI> see <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> 11.14. And as the Light of Christ within is not to be set in Opposition to Christ without, as he came in the Flesh, so as to make void eithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the great End and Use of his Coming, or the living Faith and Knowledge of it, so nor is it to be set in Opposition to any of these sub-ordinate outward Helps and Means of Gods appointment, for the furthering and promoting the Work of our Salvation and Per∣fection, as Preaching, and Reading in the Holy Scriptures, Confe∣rence, Vocal Prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all external and corporal Exercises of Religion, as performed with the Heart and Soul, from the inward Principle of the Divine Life, Spirit and Power inwardly revealed.</P>
<P>And as the Law of God is writ in the Hearts of men universally, it is not the Law of the New-Covenant; for the Hearts of most men, yea, of all unsanctified and unrenewed men, are stoney Hearts, and not Hearts of Flesh; and therefore the Law, as such, and as writ
<PB N="42" REF="000691_0051_0FA9A1FE70EC8940" MS="y"/>
on these st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Hearts, is the Law of the first Covenant. And even the <HI>Law within the Gentiles,</HI> who have not the Faith of Christ crucified, is distinguished by <HI>Paul,</HI> from <HI>Faith,</HI> and the Law thereof▪ <HI>And this is that Law, which</HI> (according to <HI>Paul) stoppeth every Month, and maketh all the World guilty before God,</HI> until the Faith of Christ be revealed. And who are under the Law, and obey it, according to what their Ability doth reach, <HI>They are held there as in a Custody, or place of Safety, as the Man-slayer in the City of Refuge,</HI> in the time of the Law, <HI>till the Faith come to be revealed.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>That the Gospel is the Power of God unto Sal∣vation,</HI> he doth not mean, that it is the Power of God simply and abstractly considered, without all Doctrine and Doctrinal Knowledge and Faith of <HI>Christ crucified,</HI> (as some very falsly imagine,) but as that Power doth discover it self in the <HI>Evangelical Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Doctrinal Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith of Christ, as he came in the Flesh, was born of the Virgin, dyed, rose, ascended,</HI> according as the four Evangelists have declared of him, and the Prophets prophesied of him, as he was so to come; therefore when the Angel preached Christs Birth to the Shep∣herds, <HI>Luke</HI> 2.10. he said, <HI>Behold! I bring you good Tidings of great Ioy, which shall be to all People</HI> (even as the Word <HI>Evangel,</HI> Englished, doth signifie <HI>Gospel) for unto you is born this day in the City of</HI> David <HI>a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</HI> And that this is the true sence of <HI>Paul</HI>'s words, is clear, that he saith, <HI>The Gospel is the Power of God unto Salvation, to every one that believeth.</HI> And he who rightly believeth, he doth believe that Christ is come in the Flesh, of the Seed of <HI>David,</HI> the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the promised Seed of the Woman, who was to bruise the Serpents Head. And thus Faith, altho' it usually cometh by Hearing and Preaching Christ crucified, yet it is not wrought in any by the bare Hearing or Preaching, but by the mighty Power of God that raised Jesus from the Dead, and conformeth every one to Jesus who hath it. And as the Law had its Doctrines, Precepts and Ordi∣nances peculiar to it, so the Gospel hath its Doctrines, Precepts and Ordinances peculiar to it, add therefore is no Dumb or Mut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gospel, as some have called it.

<P>Error 13. <HI>That there are no distinct inward Dispensations and Mini∣strations of Light, Grace and Spirit, but One only given to all men, whereby all who are faithful and obedient under it, are eternally saved, though they have no Knowledge nor Faith of Christ, as he came in the Flesh, and dyed for our Sins, and rose again, and is gone into Heaven, and who maketh Intercession for us.</HI></P>

<P>But if any object, <HI>This is to suppose a middle state betwixt these that are Wicked, and faithful Christians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I answe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> What is said by way of Supposition or Hypothesis, doth not infer any positive Conclusion; but to suppose a middle state of some (betwixt these who are perfected in Wickedness, and these who are Perfected in the Faith of Christ) who have not the Faith and Know∣ledge of Christ crucified revealed unto them, is far more charitable and rational, and more agreeable to the Nature and Attributes of Gods great Mercy and Love, than to conclude, (as too many most rashly and uncharitably do) <HI>That all such</HI> Gentiles, <HI>however so diligent they have been or are to live up to that common Illumination, are finally and irrevocably lost and damned</HI>; or on the other hand, to conclude, that any are saved and perfected with Eternal Salvation and Happiness, without all Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified and raised again, which the Scripture doth lay so great stress and weight upon; The which middle state is for some time only, until the Faith of Christ be revealed unto these Souls, when, where and how God shall be pleased to reveal it, and by what means and helps, unknown to us, for we know but a part of his Wayes.

And although that God giveth this Knowledge and Faith of Christ ordinarily and commonly by means of outward Preaching and Hearing, or Reading in the holy Scriptures, yet I nothing doubt of it, but that God hath inwardly revealed it to divers, without the outward means and helps

<P>Error 15. <HI>That the Preaching of Christ as he came in the Flesh, dyed, ros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ascended, is no necessary part of the</HI> Christian Doctrine, <HI>nor any Gospel Doctrine, and is in no wise needful to be preached in these latter Ages, being only proper to the Age and Days of the Apostles. The only needfull Knowledge of Christ now, is to know him only as the Word, Light and Life in us, but all other Knowledge of him, as he came in the Flesh without us, and of what he did and suffered, and of his outward Resurrection and Ascention, and Mediation for us in Heaven without us, is but to know Christ after the Flesh, which</HI> Paul <HI>rejected as a thing unprofitable: The only needful thing is to know him born in us, crucified in us, raised and ascended in us, and mediating and interceeding for us in us; and that all M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ditation of Christs Passion, Death, Resurrection, Ascention, &amp;c. and of what the four Evangelists declared of him, is of little value or profit to such who are spiritual, whatever profit it may be thought to have to beginners.</HI> And to my certain Knowledge, some have compared the Doctrine of Christ as he came in the Flesh without us, <HI>To the Horn-Book that is to be left behind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correct.</HI> The Falshood of these two above-mentioned Particulars doth also easily appear, from what is above declared. And if the faithful <HI>Heathen,</HI> who hath no Knowledge nor Faith of Christ crucified and raised again, be as good a <HI>Christian, &amp;c.</HI> or indeed be any True <HI>Christian</HI> at all, then <HI>Cornelius</HI> was as good a <HI>Christian</HI> before <HI>Peter</HI> preached Christ crucified to him, as after; and then it was in vain that <HI>Peter</HI> was sent to preach Christ crucified to him, and it was in vain that the Angel told <HI>Cornelius, That</HI> Peter <HI>should speak words to him whereby he and his House should be saved</HI>: He might have replyed to the Angel,
<PB N="46" REF="000691_0055_0FA9A20172C4AC70"/>
<HI>He was saved already, and well enough under that present Dispensation he was then in.</HI> All which is most false and absurd, and contrary to the Doctrine of the holy Scriptures to assert.</P>
<P>And whereas some have asserted, That <HI>Pythagoras, Socrates</HI> and <HI>Plato</HI> and other <HI>Gentile Philosophers,</HI> who had some measure of Uprightness, and were in some measure faithful to what was inwardly revealed unto them, were <HI>Christians,</HI> as <HI>Iustin Martyr,</HI> and some other antient Wri∣ters have asserted. As I will not positively contradict it, so I do affirm, That if they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> real <HI>Christians,</HI> and were worthy of that honourable Name, they had some Faith and Knowledge of Christ, the <HI>Messiah</HI> and Saviour of the World, as he was to come in the Flesh, which it was possible for them to have, by means of their Converse with some of the <HI>Iewish Nation,</HI> among whom the Doctrine of the <HI>Messiah</HI> was generally currant, as he was then to come in the Flesh; and such who had that Doctrine outwardly preached unto them, or conveyed by the Testimony of the holy Prophets, who prophesied of him, and whose Books they might have read, and might also have had some measure of special divine Illumination and Revelation, help∣ing such as were sincere among them, both to understand and savingly to apply by Faith, Christ unto them. But to say, <HI>That the Doctrine of Christ, as he came in the Flesh, dyed and rose again, &amp;c. is no necessary part of the Christian or Gospel Doctrine, and that it was only proper to the Age and Dayes of the Apostles,</HI> Is to preach another Gospel than Christ and the Apostles preached; and if an Angel from Heaven preach ano∣ther Gospel than that which they preached, <HI>he is not to be heard, but is accursed.</HI> For both Christ and the Apostles preached Christ as he came in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> as well as come in the <HI>Spirit</HI>; and said Christ con∣cerning the Woman that anointed him with the precious Nard or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, (<HI>Mat.</HI> 26.12, 13.) <HI>Where-ever this Gospel shall be preached, this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall be told what this Woman hath done unto me, for she hath done it unto my Burial</HI>; and therefore to preach Christ as he was crucified, dyed, was buried, and rose again, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ is a part of the Doctrine of the Gospel of Christ, and I am sure is no small part of it; and the Gospel of Christ is but One, and is the <HI>Everlasting Gospel</HI> that hath been preached in all Ages of the World in some degree, though not in the same degree of Clearness and Demonstration in the former Ages and Generations before Christ came in the Flesh, as since. And how frequently doth <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epistles mention the
<PB N="47" REF="000691_0056_0FA9A20230602F90" MS="y"/>
Death of Christ, and his Resurrection, and Faith in him who dyed and rose again, in order to Justification and Salvation, and as a principal motive or moving Cause of our Love and Obedience unto God and to Christ, <HI>to live to him who dyed for us</HI>; see these following places, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.5, 8. &amp; cap. 8.34. &amp; 14.9. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15, 1, 2, 3. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.14, 15. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.14. &amp; 5.10. And said Christ to the <HI>Iews, If ye believe not that I am he,</HI> (to wit, the promised <HI>Messiah) ye shall dye in your sins, &amp;c.</HI> But to them who believed on him, he promised, <HI>That Rivers of living Water should spring out of their Belly,</HI> meaning the holy Spirit that he would give to them that should believe in him. And this Faith was a Belief in him, not simply as the Word, but as the <HI>Word made Flesh,</HI> and as he was then come in the <HI>Flesh</HI>; but this Faith, though commonly wrought by outward preaching and hearing, is no bare external Historical Faith, but an inward spiritual divine living Faith of him, and in him, full of divine Mystery, Virtue and Sweet∣ness, filling the Soul with pure Love to him, and Joy and Rejoycing in him, &amp; powerfully conforming the Soul to him; and such a Know∣ledge of Christ, though it hath a respect to him as he came in the Flesh without us, dyed and rose again, and is ascended, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not to know Christ after the Flesh, but is a Knowledge of Christ after the Spirit, and is most sweet, savoury and refreshing, and profitable to the believing Soul. And none know, nor can know Christ within them duely and sufficiently, as they ought to know him to be the Word, Light and Life, (as all true <HI>Christians</HI> know him,) but who kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w him both wayes, <HI>viz.</HI> as he came in the Flesh, was crucified, dyed and rose again, and as he is come in the Spirit, to reveal, open and apply the Mystery of him, as crucified and raised again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to eternal Salvation. And therefore it is a great and dangerous Error, and tendeth to overthrow a great Article of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> to say, <HI>It is enough to know and believe in Christ in them, though they have no Knowledge or Faith of Christ without them.</HI> And when <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>He knew Christ no more after the Flesh,</HI> it is clear, he meant the carnal Knowledge of him, such as men may have of him, and as he had before he was converted, by a meer carnal and natural Understanding by what men can comprehend in the natural Understanding▪ by what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or read of him. And thus many have but a carnal Know∣ledge of Christ within, and of God and the Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, and divine things, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olding them in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er Nation, which is not the true Knowledge of

him. But the true Knowledge and Faith of Christ, as he dyed and rose again, and is glorified in our Nature in Heaven, as our Elder Brother, as the Mystery of him is inwardly opened and revealed by Christs Light and Spirit in us, and not otherwise, is of great necessity, and of excellent Use and Advantage to the most spiritual &amp; advanced, as well as to Beginners, as is clear from <HI>Paul</HI>'s Example and Doctrine, who preached <HI>Christ crucified, though a stumbling Block to the</HI> Jews, <HI>and Foolishness to the</HI> Greeks, <HI>yet to such as believe and are saved, the Wisdom of God and the Power of God</HI>; and he <HI>counted all things but Loss and Dung in comparison of his Knowledge of Christ, so as to know him and the Fellowship of his Sufferings, and the being made conformable to his Death, and to know the Power of his Resurrection:</HI> All which hath a respect to the Knowledge of him as he dyed and rose again without us, as the Mystery of him is inwardly revealed, opened and applyed to the Soul by the Spirit. And though the bare natural Meditation of Christs Passion, Death, Resurrection, Ascention, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as perform∣ed only by the meer natural Power of the Understanding, as assisted by bare Hearing or Reading, is unprofitable; yet the spiritual Medi∣tation thereof, as performed by the help of Christs Light, Life and Spirit inwardly revealed, is both very necessary, profitable and com∣fortable, and hath a very great and exceeding force and influence upon us to bring forth in us a Conformity to Christ in us, as also the <HI>Christian Virtues</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove, Patience, Humility, Resignation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and is of great Service to the most Advanced.</P>
<P>Error 16. <HI>That Christ without us, and all that he did and suffered was but a Figure, Type, Vail and Shadow of what he doth and suffereth in us.</HI></P>
<P>Error 17. <HI>That there never was nor is any other Necessity and Vse of Christs outward Coming, and Obedience and Sufferings, &amp;c. but to be our Example, to imitate him in the like Obedience, Patience, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correct.</HI> Although it is readily to be granted, That in many things which Christ both did and suffered without us, there is a manifest Analogy and Similitude betwixt what he did and suffered without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and what he doth and suffereth within us, yet it is hard to de∣monstrate an Analogy in all things, and if it could, it doth not prove that Christ either in all or any things that he did or suffered, was a
<PB N="49" REF="000691_0058_0FA9A204AA25B7F8"/>
Figure, Type, or Vail of what he doth or suffereth in the Saints, far less only a Type, Figure or Vail; for what he did and suffered in his own Body and Person was of the greatest weight, and all that we do or can enjoy of Christ in us, and of what he doth or works in us, is but the effect, fruit and benefit of what he hath done &amp; suffered for us without us. And Christ, as he was offered up on the Cross for our sins, and humbled himself to Death for us, was that great Pro∣pitiation and Sacrifice of Attonement for our sins, that made Peace for us, and quenched the Wrath of God, and made Reconciliation unto God for us, and was figured and typi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by the many Offerings and Sacrifices, and other Rites and Symboles under the Law, which had no Virtue of themselves to take away sin, but as the Faith of Believers reached through them to Christ, the Substance, and that one Offer∣ing that was to come in the end of the World, <HI>by which One Offering, he hath forever perfected them that are sanctified,</HI> as the Scripture de∣clareth. And though Christs Flesh is called in Scripture, <HI>The Vail,</HI> as where it is said, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.20. That <HI>Christ hath consecrated for us a new and living Way, through the Vail, that is to say, his Flesh,</HI> yet it is not such a Vail as the Vails of the Law, but of more excellent and abiding Use and Service; for by the Vail of his Flesh, wherein he humbled himself, and was Obedient to the Death of the Cross, as by a most lovely and costly Skreen, the hot Anger &amp; Wrath of divine Justice was turned away from us, and diverted: And as our Faith is exercised on him, as he thus suffered for us, dyed and rose again (and is ascended into Heaven in that very Body wherein he suffered, being the same it was for Substance, but having put off all the Infirmities of Flesh, which he took on him for our sake, and being wonderfully changed in manner and fashion, &amp; is a glorious spiritual Body) the face of God shineth graciously on us, for his sake who dyed for us, and is risen again, and doth ever live to make Intercession for us, as he is clothed with our Nature glorified in Heaven. And it is one of the great Mysteries of the Gospel and Christian Faith, which the Spirit and Light of Christ must inwardly open and reveal unto the Souls of Believers, and doth, <HI>How the Sufferings and Death of the Son of God in our Nature, should be of such Virtue and Efficacy to reconcile us unto God, and quench and pacifie the kindled Anger and Wrath of divine Iustice against us.</HI></P>
<P>And for the better understanding of this great Mystery, as the
<PB N="50" REF="000691_0059_0FA9A205395AA9B8"/>
Light and Spirit of Christ doth open it in our hearts, it is to be con∣sidered in the few Particulars following, which only are here glanced or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at, although the large handling of so great and worthy Subject would require a large Volumn, and needeth a more than ordinary divine Ability of Knowledge and Utterance duely to express it, insomuch that <HI>Paul</HI> desired the help of the Saints Prayers, that he might be enabled to make manifest the Mystery of Christ, as he ought to speak it, and that Utterance or Speech might be given him to that end; for indeed all Tongues of Men and Angels fall short to declare it.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> That which God did so greatly regard in what Christ did and suffered for us, was his <HI>Obedience unto the Will of his Father,</HI> which did so highly please God, that for his sake, as a most excellent and mighty Intercessor, Gods Wrath was quenched toward us, and offend∣ed Justice was pacified. For whereas in divers fore-going Ages of the World, the great Obedience of some excellent and Holy Men, such as <HI>Noah, Moses, Aaron, Phineas, Samuell, Daniel, Iob, &amp;c.</HI> did procure the Favour of God to such Nations; Families and Persons for whom they interceeded, in order to a Temporal Redemption or Deliverance from divine Wrath, the most great and excellent Obe∣dience of the deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Son of God, as he obeyed in humbling himself, not only to take the Form of a Servant, but to the Death of the Cross, did procure the Favour of God to all Mankind, for Eternal Redemption to all who should believe in him, from the beginning of the World to the end of it; hence he is said in Scripture to have obtained <HI>Eternal Redemption</HI> for us, whose Obedience was so much the more excellent, that whereas all others, who did perform the highest and most holy Acts of Obedience unto God, in order to interceed for their Brethren, however so holy, were but Men only; He was not only Man, but both <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI>; and therefore the Blood of Christ in Scripture, is called, <HI>The Blood of God, Act.</HI> 20.28. for he who suffered unto Blood, and was crucified, was not a meer Man, but God in our Natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, although he did not suffer as God, but as Man.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Not only the great Love of God, in giving his Son to dye for us, but his great Justice, Wisdom and Power, and other his divine Attributes, are gloriously revealed and discovered in the same, and that which appeareth to carnal Man to be Folly, Weakness and In∣justice, as that the Just should suffer for the Unjust, and by his Death
<PB N="53" REF="000691_0060_0FA9A205F106A0F0"/>
overcome him who hath the Power of Death, that is the Devil, is discovered to be divine Wisdom, Power and Justice. And whereas by Mans sin the divine Mercy and Justice did, as it were, plead one against the other concerning Man, the one to <HI>spare him,</HI> the other to <HI>punish him,</HI> the Wisdom of God found out a way, by the Death of Gods dear Son, to answer the demand of both, which <HI>David</HI> by the Spirit of Prophecy did fore-see, when he said in <HI>Psal.</HI> 85.10. <HI>Mercy and Truth are met together, Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other.</HI> And what the divine Wisdom did find out, the divine Power did ex∣ecute and bring to pass, even the giving up of the Son, to Death, for us, the Original whereof was the Love of the Father, that through this most lovely Channel and Conduit, even Christ crucified, was to vent and extend it self, and flow forth with all plenty of divine Gifts and Blessings, to Mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> And as by the Sufferings of Christ he did show forth his most excellent Obedience, so by the same he became perfected, which is to say, most perfectly fitted and qualified to be a Saviour unto us, and a merciful High Priest with God, being touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, made like to us in all things, <HI>sin excepted,</HI> so as not only by his Death and Sufferings to sweeten and make comfortable our Death unto us, but to lay a Foundation of our Hope of a blessed Re∣surrection, by his Resurrection from the Dead.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> And the divine Justice appeareth gloriously in this, That Christ, the Son, suffering in our Nature, maketh it, that his Suffer∣ings are imputed as ours, he being our Surety, and Head, and Root, even as what we suffer for him, he reputeth it as his own Sufferings, as when he said, <HI>I was Hungery, and ye gave me not to eat, in Prison, and ye visited me not</HI>; for he who sanctifieth, and they who are sancti∣fied, being of one, as that of Head and Members, Root and Branches, it is just and equal that the Obedience of one, should be imputed unto all his Brethren, who should believe in him and obey him, for the Re∣mission of sins past, to declare his Justice, and that God might be just, and the Justifier of them who believe in <HI>Iesus</HI>; as in the natural Body, what the Head or any principal Member of the Body doth, good or bad, is imputed as done by the whole Body, and who are bound to∣gether joyntly and severally, are liable one for another; hence he is called our <HI>Surety</HI> or <HI>Bonds-man,</HI> in Scripture. And thus because the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were as one Body, they were punished for the sins

of some particular Members, until the divine Justice was answered.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> The Mystery of this was figured under the Law. <HI>That no fire was to be kindled, but all to be quenched on the Day of Attonement, and on the Sabbath Dayes:</HI> for as the Day of Attonement was in the end of the Year, so Christ suffered in the end of the World, and quenched the fire of divine Wrath against all Sinners; And near the beginning of the <HI>Iewish Sabbath,</HI> he dyed on the Cross, and rested in the Grave, until the morning of the first Day, in which Sabbath or Rest of our Lord in the Grave, he quenched the divine Wrath and Severity against Sinners, and made Intercession for them, whereby the Benefit and Virtue of his Death did and doth extend to all Souls and Ages, to save all who should believe in him.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>thly,</HI> The Faith of all true Believers in Christ from the beginning of the World, was not only in him as inwardly and spiritually pre∣sent in their hearts, the Word, Light and Life, but as the <HI>Seed of the Woman,</HI> according to the first Gospel Promise, <HI>who should bruise the Serpents Head,</HI> and afterwards, as the <HI>Seed of</HI> Abraham, <HI>in whom all Nations of the Earth should be blessed,</HI> held forth to their Faith in Pro∣mises, and Types and Figures of Sacrifices, and Shadows of the Law. And they had the Faith and Knowledge of him, <HI>That he was to be both God and Man,</HI> as not only <HI>Isaiah</HI> prophesied of him, but also <HI>Eve</HI>; for when <HI>Cain</HI> was born, she called him <HI>Cain,</HI> saying, <HI>I have got the Man the Lord,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (which is one of the greatest Names of God) so the true Translation; Not that she did imagine, that <HI>Cain</HI> was he, as <HI>Luther</HI> and some others have conceived, but without all ground; but the Reason why she called her first born <HI>Cain,</HI> was to be a signifi∣cation and Memoral of her Faith to succeeding Ages, in the Seed that was promised he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which she had received by Faith; even as <HI>Ioseph</HI> called one of his Sons <HI>Mannasse,</HI> and another <HI>Ephraim,</HI> with respect to other things and Persons; and <HI>Rachel</HI> called her eldest Son <HI>Ioseph,</HI> that signifieth <HI>Addi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g,</HI> not because of <HI>Ioseph</HI> himself, but because of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> whom she fore-saw, by the Spirit of Prophecy, should be afterward given her, saying, <HI>God shall add to me another Son</HI>; and therefore that is only the true Faith of Christ which layeth hold of him and respecteth him not simply as Man, nor simply as God, or the Word by which all things were made, but as he is the Man the <HI>Lord,</HI> or <HI>the Word made Flesh,</HI> or <HI>God manifest in Flesh, &amp;c.</HI> And whereas many acknowledge no other Necessity or Service of Christs

<P>Error 18. <HI>That the true saving, justifying and purifying Faith is only in Christ within us, as he is the Word, Light and Life, and quickening Spirit, teaching us to deny Injustice, Intemperance, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her Worldly Lusts, and to live soberly, justly and godly towards God as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but it is no Branch, Part nor Property of saving Faith to believ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Man Christ as he dyed for our Sins, and rose again without us,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Error 19. <HI>That Gospel Love, and all Gospel Virtues and Obedience, and Fruits of the Spirit, are sufficiently and plentifully attained unto only by the Light, Word and Grace of God within men, though that inward Word, Light and Grace reveal nothing to them in more or less of Christs Outward Coming,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Correct.</HI> The Falshood of these two above-mentioned Particulars is sufficiently discovered by what is already said on the fore-going Heads. Yet for the further clearing the matter, let the few Parti∣culars following be well considered.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> That as the Law and Gospel, as to the inward, are distinct Administrations and Dispensations, so they have their distinct Effects, there is Legal <HI>Faith, Love, Obedience,</HI> and Legal <HI>Virtues,</HI> which are true and good in their kind, and a <HI>Legal Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection,</HI> which yet is far short of the <HI>Gospel Perfection</HI>; for there are divers sorts and degr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Perfection,</HI> according to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> words, <HI>Vrim,</HI> i. e. <HI>Lights,</HI> and <HI>Thummim,</HI> i. e. <HI>Perfections</HI>; and there is an <HI>Evangelical</HI> or <HI>Gospel Faith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Gospel Virtues,</HI> and a <HI>Gospel Perfection,</HI> all which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a more excellent kind, far excelling the other, as Gold excelleth Silver, Brass, Iron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And to this doth that Gospel Promise relate, <HI>For Iron I will bring Silver, and for Brass, Gold,</HI> Isa. 60.17.</P>

This distinction of Servants and Sons, is used both by <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> in the New Te∣stament, and in the Old Testament was figured by <HI>Ishmael,</HI> the Son of the Bond-Woman, and <HI>Isaac,</HI> the Son of <HI>Sarah,</HI> the Free-Woman, which things are an Allegory, as <HI>Paul</HI> hath declared, <HI>for</HI> Hagar <HI>and</HI> Sarah <HI>are the two Covenants,</HI> and their Children are the two several Births, answering to these several Mothers &amp; Wombs: And as <HI>Ishmael</HI> and <HI>Isaac</HI> had one Father, but differing Mothers, so the Children of the two Covenants, <HI>viz.

<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> The Legal Faith is a faith in God as Creator, giving Life, Health, and many Blessings and Comforts both inward and outward, and from this Legal Faith doth flow a Legal Love, Obedience and other Legal Virtues, and all proceeding from that general and uni∣versal Illumination that is common to all Mankind, that teacheth men generally the substance of the ten Precepts delivered by God to the People from <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> and writ by him in two Tables of Stone. And as there is a Legal Faith in God, and love to him as Creator and Lord, so there is a Legal Worship and Prayer, whereby men may call upon God as he is their Creator and Maker, and giving them Being, Life, Breath, and all the Comforts of Life common to Mankind, to∣gether with many good enduements of Knowledge &amp; Understanding, and general Virtues; but all this without any Knowledge and Faith of <HI>Christ as he dyed for us and rose again, &amp;c.</HI> But the Evangelical or Gospel Faith is a <HI>Faith in God, not only as our Creator,</HI> giving us these common Mercies and Blessings, but as he is <HI>a most gracious God and Father to us in our Lord Iesus Christ, giving us the Revelation and Know∣ledge of his Son as he dyed for us, and rose again, and is gone into Heaven, and now remains in Heaven clothed with our glorified Nature, making In∣tercession for us</HI>; and as the <HI>Evangelical</HI> or <HI>Gospel Faith</HI> is a Faith in God as he is our Father, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, so it is a <HI>Faith in the Lord Iesus Christ,</HI> and not simply as he is the Word or God, but as the <HI>Word made Flesh,</HI> and <HI>God manifest in Flesh, as he dyed

And to such who are under this Gospel Dispensa∣tion, the substance of the <HI>Ten Precepts</HI> is a binding Law unto them, and they are obliged to fulfill the Righteousness of it, and that from more powerful Motives, as is already said, than what the legal Dis∣pensation (simply as such) doth afford unto them; and the Gospel Dispensation doth afford unto them not only more Light and Know∣ledge, but more Grace and Strength, whereby to fulfill the Righte∣ousness of the Law; and not only so, but to obey divers <HI>New Precepts</HI> that the Law (delivered universally to Mankind, or to the People of <HI>Israel</HI> at <HI>Mount Sina</HI>) did not require; for the Law of the first Cove∣nant did permit men to require <HI>an Eye for an Eye, Tooth for Tooth, and to resist Wrongs and Injuries, and seek a Recompence or Revenge,</HI> but this the Gospel Law forbids; also, it did permit men to have <HI>more Wives than one together,</HI> but Christ's Gospel Law forbiddeth such a thing, as also <HI>Swearing,</HI> which the Law did allow of. And t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Gospel Obedience</HI> differeth greatly from the <HI>Legal Obedience,</HI> in manner of Performance, as flowing from greater Love and Grace, as much as the Obedience of a Servant that loveth his Master as well as a Servant doth or can do, differeth from the Obedience of a Son that loveth &amp; serveth his Father, because he is his Father; but the Servant loveth him because he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Master, and serveth him for Wages, and feareth to disobey him, lest he beat him, or detain his Wages, or cast him out of his Service; but the Son knoweth that he shall be his Father's Heir, and his Inhe∣ritance, as a Son, is wholly in his Eye; Even thus the Sons of God love and serve God, that they may forever inherit him to be their Portion and Inheritence; for they have no other Inheritence but God

<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> The Scripture frequently mentions <HI>Christs Obedience,</HI> and how <HI>he came down from Heaven, not to do his own Will, but the Will of him that sent him.</HI> Now this Obedience of Christ unto the Will of God, must be the Act of his Soul▪ and not of a meer Body; for what Obedience can a meer Body perform unto God, without the Soul or Spirit? and therefore this Obedience must be of his Soul and Spirit, as Man; for all Obedience implyeth a subjection to one that is superiour; for the Godhead cannot be said to command or obey himself, but the Man Christ Jesus received a Commandment of the Father, and did most perfectly obey the Father's Command; and therefore he had the true Soul and Spirit of Man in him, as well as any other Man hath. And though the Soul of Christ, as Man, was and is incomparably more excellent than all Souls of Men, yet he hath in his Soul all that is essential to the Soul of Man, <HI>being made like to us in all things, but without sin.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> As Obedience implyeth a subjection of an Inferiour to a supe∣riour, or of the lesser to the greater, so doth Prayer, and therefore when Christ prayed unto the Father, that Soul or Spirit in Christ which prayed, was the Soul and Spirit in Christ, as Man, in respect of which Christ said, <HI>My Father is greater than I,</HI> to wit, as Man; for the Godhead cannot pray to the Godhead, to speak properly.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly.</HI> The true Consideration of Christs being our Mediator, doth plainly hold forth, that Christ hath a Soul as well as a Body, as Man; and because he was Head and Mediator to his Church, betwixt God and Men, from the beginning of the World, therefore he had the Soul and Spirit of a Man from the beginning; and when he took flesh in the Virgins Womb, his <HI>soul</HI> and <HI>spirit,</HI> as Man (that was united with the Eternal Word from the beginning) did descend and Taber∣nacle in that prepared Body of Flesh, to the end that he might per∣form these Offices of his Mediatorship, that could not be performed without his Coming in the Flesh, as namely, <HI>To dye for the sins of the World, &amp;c.</HI> for some of his Mediatory Offices he both could and did perform by his <HI>soul</HI> and <HI>spirit,</HI> before he came in the Flesh, but to dye
<PB N="65" REF="000691_0074_0FA9A21126762D18" MS="y"/>
for the sins of men, so as to be a <HI>Sacrifice of Attonement</HI> unto God for them, required his taking on him a Body of Flesh; and therefore when he said, <HI>He came down from Heaven not to do his own will,</HI> that cannot be meant simply the Godhead of Christ, who hath no Will superior unto him to obey or fulfill; but the <HI>soul</HI> of Christ (tho' united to the Godhead by a most excellent and admirable Union) hath a superior Will and Power above it, which is that of the Godhead, in which he doth alwayes obey and fulfill the Will of God; and therefore the <HI>soul,</HI> of Christ being in most excellent and admirable Union with the eternal Word or Godhead, descended from Heaven to take Flesh in the Vir∣gins Womb.</P>
<P>And as concerning <HI>Christs Body of Flesh</HI> which he did take up or assume, though it dyed, and was buried, yet it rose again; for even <HI>his Flesh saw no Corruption,</HI> as <HI>Peter</HI> plainly declareth and proveth out of <HI>Psal.</HI> 16.10. And as Christ prophesied of his Body, <HI>Destroy</HI> (or rather as it should be translated from the <HI>Greek) Dissolve this Temple, and I will raise it up again the third day:</HI> And in the same Body wherein he suffered Death on the Cross, and which was buried, he rose again, and showed himself to his Disciples, and the Print of the Nails and Spear, and after forty days in the same Body did ascend into Heaven, in the sight of the Disciples; <HI>for having once dyed, he dyeth no more,</HI> and therefore did not lay down his Body again; I say, the Body of Christ is the same now in Heaven, as it was on Earth, both before and after he suffered, as in respect of substance, or the true Essence, Being and Nature of a Body, though it is wonderfully changed in Manner and Condition, having put off all these Infirmities, that it did assume for our sake, and is a most glorious heavenly spiritual Body, according to which the Bodies of the saints shall be made conform at the Resurrection of the Dead. And seeing Christs Body, that he had of the Virgin, which ascended into Heaven (together with his soul) did not come down from Heaven, (altho' his soul did descend from Heaven) there∣fore it is a great Error to say, <HI>That nothing of Christ, or belonging to Christ did ascend to Heaven, but that which came from Heaven</HI>; the Scripture saith no such thing any where; but thus it saith, <HI>He who ascended is the same that descended,</HI> to wit, the same Christ, who was before the Body was, did both descend and ascend, but his Body did not descend with him, when he ascended; for it was formed in the Virgins Womb, and conceived by the miraculous Operation of the holy Ghost,
<PB N="66" REF="000691_0075_0FA9A21139D52530"/>
and that Body had in it really of the Virgins Flesh and Nature, as also, it had in it some-what more excellent. And it is easie to understand how the same Christ that did descend, did again ascend, and yet took up the Body as a Garment, which he brought not with him at his descending, as to understand how a man going from this place to <HI>London,</HI> returns ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in the same Man, but brings with him a Cloathing or Garment that he did not take with him.</P>
<P>And whereas some say, <HI>They grant that Christ a hath spiritual Body in Heaven,</HI> but will not acknowledge that it is the <HI>same substance, essence or being</HI> of that <HI>Body which was crucified,</HI> but say, <HI>It was that which was glo∣rified with the Father before the World was</HI>; and they being further asked, <HI>What that was?</HI> they say, <HI>It was his Godhead</HI>; for they deny <HI>that Christ hath any thing of Man's Nature in Heaven,</HI> and they are offended with such who say, <HI>Christ hath a two-fold Nature in Him, viz.</HI> one being the Nature of God, the other being the Nature of Man; and thus like the <HI>Eutychians</HI> and <HI>Monothelit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of Old, they <HI>confound the twofold Nature of Christ,</HI> making his Nature, <HI>as God,</HI> to be his Nature <HI>as Man,</HI> as if the Godhead of Christ were his Manhood, or as if his Manhood could be changed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Godhead; and such fall into the gross Error of those who say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Godhead it self is a Body in the form &amp; stature of a Man, and changed it self from being a spiritual Body to be a carnal Body, therein to suffer Death, and after it rose again was changed from carnal to spiritual.</HI> Now, as this is a most vile and Anti-christian Error, greatly to be ab∣horred and detested by all <HI>Christians,</HI> so it is another most Vile and Anti-christian Error to say, <HI>The Body of Christ was changed into the Na∣ture of the Godhead,</HI> as some say, or <HI>That Christ hath but one Nature in Heaven, which is only that of his Godhead,</HI> as others say; for the Nature of the Godhead is wholly and in all respects unchangeable, being with∣out all shadow of Change, as <HI>Iames</HI> declareth, and many places of Scripture confirm, and is most agreeable to the Dictates of that good Understanding which God hath given to Men, as Men. And again, to say, <HI>That Christ hath but one Nature in Heaven,</HI> is wholly to make void his being our Mediator; for he is our Mediator not simply as God, nor simply as Man, but as he is both God and Man; and his <HI>God∣head Nature</HI> is not his <HI>Manhood Nature,</HI> altho' most excellently and admirably united together, and that forever, above all Thoughts and Understanding of Men and Angels.</P>
<P>And whereas some argue, <HI>That Christ is not in Heaven in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nature,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="000691_0076_0FA9A211F14BF6F0" MS="y"/>
because the Scripture saith, <HI>By Nature we are Children of Wrath.</HI> Such in this, as in other things, bewray and discover their great Ignorance and Darkness of Understanding; for it is by the corrupted &amp; vitiated Nature of Man that we have been Children of Wrath; but <HI>Sin</HI> or <HI>Cor∣ruption</HI> by sin is no essential part or property of Mans Nature, but meer∣ly adventitious, and it is the work of God and Christ to heal, wash and sanctifie the corrupted and defiled Nature of Men; and then (when washed and sanctified) they are no more by Nature <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> but <HI>Children of God,</HI> and in <HI>high Favour with him.</HI> But Christ did never take or assume any thing or part of the corrupted and vitiated Nature of Man; for tho' the Natures of other men were generally corrupted and defiled with sin, both in Soul and Body, yet his Nature, even as Man, never had any Defilemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the least. And altho' his Nature as Man was never defiled, and our Nature which we generally have hath been defiled, this doth not prove that Christ did not partake of Mans Nature; for as one part of a Garment may remain pure and clean, when the other parts of it are defiled, so that part of our Nature which Christ assumed, remained pure, and was never defiled, altho' what other men have hath been defiled, yet so as to be capable of being clean∣sed and made pure again, like unto the <HI>pure Nature of the Man Christ Iesus.</HI> It is certainly a great shame that any pretending to <HI>Christianity</HI> should be so grosly ignorant; and it is yet a greater shame and scandal that any pretending to be taught by the Spirit of Christ, that is a Spirit of all <HI>divine Wisdom, Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Understanding,</HI> should be so dark, blind and ignorant as some are; and if they had but the right and good use of their Reason, as Men, they could never fall into such gross and pernicious Errors, which not only the holy Scripture, but the very sound Reason of a Man doth abundantly confute.</P>
<P>Error 23. <HI>That the alone Righteousness of Christ, whereby men are justi∣fied, is that inward Work of Righteousness wrought in us, in obedience to that universal Illumination, common to</HI> Jews, Turks, Pagans <HI>and</HI> Christians; <HI>and that the Righteousness of Christ imputed to us, apprehended or received by Faith, is but a fancy or invention of Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correct.</HI> This is a great Error, and very hurtful, the plain tendency whereof is to lead men to rest in the Righteousness of the first Cove∣nant, as all that Righteousness is, which is wrought in men only in
<PB N="68" REF="000691_0077_0FA9A212B6249C68" MS="y"/>
Obedience to that universal Illumination common to all men, as is above demonstrated; for even the inward Righteousness and Holiness wrought in men, who are true <HI>Christians,</HI> is of a more excellent kind and degree, than that which any of the most upright <HI>Gentiles</HI> could attain unto by Obedience to that common Illumination in them, who have not the Faith of Christ crucified and raised again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the <HI>Christian Faith, Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> and the whole <HI>Christian Obe∣dience</HI> proceedeth from a more excellent measure and kind of <HI>divine Illumination</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> that is peculiar and special to <HI>Christians,</HI> tho' both the one and the other do all proceed from one God, and one Lord Jesus Christ, and one Spirit of God, yet diversity of Operations, Ad∣ministrations and Gifts. And although the Righteousness, Holiness and Obedience of true <HI>Christians</HI> be the more excellent above that of the best <HI>Gentiles,</HI> yet it is not the Foundation or Ground of their Justi∣fication, but (at best) Conditions and Instruments requisite thereunto; But Christ Jesus, as he was a Sacrifice and Offering for us without us, and became obedient unto Death, and fulfilled the Law and Will of God for us, as he is inwardly revealed, and the Mystery of his Death and Obedience is opened to us and applyed by the Spirit of Christ, is the Foundation of our Justification before God, not only for the Re∣mission of sins past, but also to render us, and our whole Gospel Obe∣dience acceptable unto God, in our most perfect and advanced state in Holiness; for it is still through and in Christ that we are accepted of God, who is our Propitiation and Attonement, <HI>who is made unto us of God Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption.</HI> For the best works of Righteousness or Holiness that we can perform unto God, even by the help of his Grace and Spirit, is not the Foundation or Ground either of our Justification or Faith; for that were to set up another Foundation than Christ Jesus; whereas there is no other Foun∣dation but Christ alone; but to the end that he may be our Foundation, and his Righteousness may be imputed to us, and all our sins freely for∣given us for his sake, we must have Faith in him, and have the true Work of Repentance, and Conversion from Sin to Righteousness wrought in us, and in time to come we must walk in Obedience unto him. And therefore in order to obtain Justification and Remission of all sin, Faith is not only required, but Repentance, and Conversion from Sin to Righteousness, and Holiness, and true Gospel! Obedience, and good Works proceeding from a living Faith, the which Faith hath
<PB N="69" REF="000691_0078_0FA9A21370F74740" MS="y"/>
for its Object and Foundation, Christ, both without us, as he became a Sacrifice and Attonement for our sins, and also as he liveth, and dwelleth, and ruleth in us.</P>
<P>And that <HI>our best Obedience,</HI> even when performed by the help of the Spirit of Christ in us, is not our alone Righteousness, whereby we are wholly and perfectly justified in the sight of God, is most clear and evident from the holy Scripture; for <HI>that Obedience</HI> only can perfectly and wholly justifie us, that hath been even performed by us unto God since the first Moment of our Life, wherein we were capable to do either good or evil, but no such Obedience can be found to have been per∣formed by any Man, except the Lord Jesus Christ▪ <HI>for all have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God,</HI> as the Scripture declareth. And seeing we all owe a continual Obedience unto God, by which only men can be justified, and that none have given it from first to last, and that the Obedience which we perform unto God, after Conversion, can be no Satisfaction nor Recompence for our many sins past, therefore what is wanting in our Obedience, as to time past (or any time afterwards, when we sin through frailty, upon our hearty and sincere Repentance, and Faith, and new Obedience) must be supplyed unto us by the most perfect Obedience and Righteousness of Christ imputed unto us.</P>
<P>And as concerning <HI>Imputed Righteousness,</HI> it is a Scripture phrase, and should be owned in its place, as well as that <HI>inward Work of Righteous∣ness</HI> wrought in us by the Spirit of Christ; for it is written, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.10▪ <HI>That Faith was reckoned to</HI> Abraham <HI>for Righteousness.</HI> And <HI>v.</HI> 11. it is said, <HI>He received the sign of Circumcision a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith, which he had being yet circumcised, that he might be the Father of all them that believe, that Righteousness might be</HI> [imputed] <HI>to them also, &amp;c.</HI> And <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24. it is said, <HI>Being justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Iesus Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a Pro∣pitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteousness, for the Remission of sins past, through the forbearance of God, to declare at this time his Righteousness, that he might be just, and the Iustifier of him which be∣lieveth in Iesus.</HI> And thus the blessed Man is described, <HI>whose Iniquities are forgiven,</HI> but he must also be such <HI>who doth sincerely Repent, and in whose heart in no guilt, Rom.</HI> 4.7. <HI>Psal.</HI> 32.2. And certain it is, that no Obedience that we do or can perform unto God, can by way of merit or strict Justice procure the Pardon of our sins past, for that is given us freely for Christs sake; and Christ whole and undivided, both
<PB N="70" REF="000691_0079_0FA9A2142FBBAA60"/>
as he fulfilled the Law for us without us, and as he doth fulfill the Righ∣teousnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Law in us, for the time to come, is our Cloathing and Garment whereby we appear b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore God to receive our perfect Justi∣fication and Absolution, and so have Peace and Acceptance with God. And thus Christ and his Righteousness, both imputed unto us, and which he worketh in us, is that <HI>doubte Garment,</HI> of a <HI>scarlet</HI> or <HI>doubte Dye,</HI> where-with all the Children of that Virtuous Woman, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> from above, the Mother of us, are cloathed, <HI>so that she is not afraid of the Snow or her Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shold, for all her Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shold is cloathed with Scarlet</HI> (or as may be translated, and is on the Margent) <HI>with double Cloathing) Prov.</HI> 31.21. And therefore it is not safe for any to rely and rest upon any Obedience they can perform unto God, as the Foundation of their Justification, but only upon Jesus Christ, and the Mercy, and Grace, and Favour of God, apprehended by Faith in him. So nor is it safe for any to think, That Christs imputed Righteousness of what he did and suffered for them will be a Covering to them while they are not inwardly Righteous, and witness not Christ to live, dwell and rule in them; for Christ is Righteousness to none but such to whom, and in and over whom he is King and Lord, according to that saying, <HI>This is the Name whereby he shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> The holy Ghost, or Spirit, is in himself forever Holy, and hath his various Operations and Gifts in Men, in some one way and in some another, but most especially he is called in Scripture, <HI>That holy Ghost,</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> as he doth influence the Souls and Hearts of Believers in Christ with a holy and divine Influence, sanctifying them and making them Holy, and conformable unto Christ their Head, Husband and Lord, in a peculiar and special way &amp; manner given only to Believers in Christ crucified and raised again, and to none others who have not that Faith; for that Holiness that is a Conformity unto Christ the second <HI>Adam,</HI> and is the proper and peculiar Effect of the New or second Covenant, is far more excellent than any Righteousness or Obe∣dience that is but the effect of the first Covenant or Ministration, and is but a conformity to the first <HI>Adam</HI> his Righteousness, and maketh not Sons but Servants, or if Sons, but Sons of <HI>Hagar,</HI> or the first Co∣venant; and under this first Covenant Ministration, the Spirit is call'd in them <HI>The Spirit of Fear and Bondage,</HI> which keepeth all Souls under it in a servile Fear, that is good in its place, where also is Love, and other Virtues, suitable to the Servants state; but the Filial Fear and Love, and other Gospel Virtues, suitable to the Child of the New-Covenant, are the far more excellent; and here the Spirit is called, <HI>The Spirit of Adoption</HI> or <HI>Sonship,</HI> that helpeth us to cry <HI>Abba Father.</HI> And as the Spirit of God is called in Scripture, <HI>The Spirit of Faith, The Spirit of Knowledge, of Wisdom, of Fear, &amp;c.</HI> because it worketh these Virtues in us, so it is called, <HI>The Holy Spirit</HI> or <HI>Spirit of Holiness,</HI> be∣cause it worketh a peculiar degree and kind of Holiness in all true Be∣lievers in Christ crucified, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> above what the most upright <HI>Gentiles</HI> do witness or experience in their meer <HI>Gentile state.</HI></P>
<P>And that any can be made <HI>Holy,</HI> according to the best and most strict sence of the word, far less perfected in Holiness, without the Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified, is a great Error, and very hurtful, though maintained by <HI>Pelagians</HI> of old, and some of late, and many other high Notionists, and is expresly contrary to the holy Scripture, which saith, <HI>The Law made nothing Perfect,</HI> and that Law was not only the Law without, but even the Law within, both in <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI>▪ until the Faith of Christ, the one Offering come to be revealed, <HI>by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Offering he hath forever perfected all that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> And the Spirit of Holiness, which doth perfectly both

Therefore we find in Scripture so great things ascribed to <HI>Faith in Christ Iesus,</HI> not only for our Justifi∣cation and obtaining Peace with God, but for our <HI>perfect Cleansing,</HI> and <HI>Purification,</HI> and <HI>Sanctification</HI> and giving us the <HI>Victory</HI>; therefore it is said in <HI>Iohn, This is our Victory whereby we overcome the World, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Faith</HI>; and that Faith is not simply a Faith or believing in Christ as he is God, or the Light in us, but as by that Light of Christ in us, given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Christians,</HI> we believe in him as he dyed for us, and rose again, and is now exalted in the highest Heavens, to be a Prince and a Saviour unto us, from whom, even the heavenly Man Christ Jesus, we receive most excellent peculiar divine Influences of Light, Life and Grace, whereby he draweth us to him, as by so many Cords, and fitteth us for him, and joyneth us to him, as Members of his Body, which is his Church; and therefore also we pray unto him, because (tho' his Body which rose is not present with us, but is ascended, yet) his Spirit doth extend, reach and flow forth unto us, according to which he is really <HI>spiritually</HI> present with us, &amp; heareth our Prayers, &amp; presenteth them to God for us, and giveth us gracious Returns. And we are as really and sensibly united to him, as the Members are to the Head in the natural Body of Man, or as the Branches are to the Vine Tree that beareth them, according to Christs own Doctrine. And thus by Faith in him we eat his Flesh and drink his Blood, as he is the heavenly Man and heavenly Vine-Tree, and that Tree of Life that groweth in the midst of the Garden of God, that hath united it self with that Seed of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> and exalted the same therewith.</P>
<P>Error 25. <HI>That all true Believers in Christ are perfected in Holiness at once, so as to be perfectly cleansed and free'd from all Sin, even when in the state of Children, or at least within some very small time after they have believed.</HI></P>
<P>Err. 26. <HI>That none ought to preach Christ to others, but who are perfectly free from all Sin in Thought, Word and Deed, even from the least inward Defilement of Sin, as suppose the least sinful Thought or Motion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correct.</HI> Both these are great and hurtful Errors. And as concern∣ing <HI>Perfection, and a perfect freedom from all Sin, in Thought, Word and Deed, and a perfect Victory over it.</HI> It is a true Doctrine to preach it,
<PB N="73" REF="000691_0082_0FA9A2166FD7C5B0" MS="y"/>
as a thing attainable, or possible to be attained in this Life by the Grace of God, through Faith in Christ Jesus; and also to press and earnestly exhort all to attain to such a Perfection, is commendable; and to hold forth unto People the great danger and hurt of being slack and remiss in pursuing after the same. And also, it is fit to be preach∣ed. That none should delay and be remiss, but that all should be ex∣ceeding diligent to have that great Work of their Salvation wrought out and perfected, while the Soul doth remain in the mortal Body; and that none entertain any such presumptuous Thought or Imagina∣tion, <HI>That if they be not perfectly cleansed and made free from all sin here in the mortal Body, they shall have some time or place after Death, where and when they shall be cleansed</HI>; for it is altogether vain and foolish to entertain any such Thought or Imagination; <HI>For Now is the accepted Time, Now is the Day of Salvation; and the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appeared unto us, teaching us to deny Vngodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live righteously, soberly and goaly in this present World.</HI> And therefore it is extream Folly and Madness for any to put off their per∣fecting the work of their Salvation to any time or place after Death; or indeed for any to delay or put off that work to old Age, or the Death-Bed, for no man knoweth how long he shall live in the World, or that he shall have a Bed to dye upon, or a time of sickness before Death, or if he happen to have these things, yet seeing <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> (in every degree of them) are the Gifts of God, and Men can∣not practise them in their own Time and Will, but in Gods Time, and as he is pleased to give them the present Grace and Ability; therefore no Delay nor Remisness in so great and necessary a work is to be allow∣ed or excused. But on the other hand to say or imagine, <HI>That the perfect freedom from all sin, &amp; victory over it, is attained at the first instant of mens believing, and that universally, even when their Faith is sincere, and that they are come to feel the good Work of God begun in them,</HI> is contrary both to the Scriptures Testimony in many places, and the experience of Thousands who know by the Evidence and Testimony of Gods holy Spirit in their hearts and souls, that it is given them truly to believe in God and Christ, and they feel most infallibly, that God hath begun his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Work of Sanctification in them, and yet also, they feel and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> know, that they are not perfectly made free from all sin, and have not got the perfect Victory over it, but feel a daily Warfare in them betwixt the Flesh and the Spirit; and in that
<PB N="74" REF="000691_0083_0FA9A2172F785800" MS="y"/>
Faith they live and fight against the Flesh and the Lusts thereof, that through their Leader and Captain of Salvation, they shall in due time overcome, and witness a perfect Freedom from all Sin, of <HI>Thoughts, Words</HI> and <HI>Deeds,</HI> and that in the mortal Body, if they be diligent and watchful; and the more diligent that any are, they shall the sooner obtain such a state. But to limit a time, as either at the first instant of true believing, or to any certain number of Days, Months or Years, after the first instant of believing, proceedeth from great Ignorance and Darkn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of Understanding, and showeth little Expe∣rience in any who do so affirm; for according to the Testimony of the holy Scripture, and the more general Experience of sincere Be∣lievers, there is a time of Warfare within the Soul of him or her that hath sincerely believed, betwixt Flesh and Spirit, or Sin and Righte∣ousness, and that which is not of God, and that which is of him, as is clear from <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. <HI>v.</HI> 9. to the end, where the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> doth very plainly describe the state and condition of a man that is not alto∣gether an Unbeliever, or without, but of one, who, at least, hath in some measure been livingly and effectually touched by the Power of God, &amp; hath had some good Work begun in him, as doth appear from <HI>v.</HI> 13. <HI>That sin was made to appear to be sin unto him, and did become exceeding sinful</HI>; and that was wrought in him by that which was good. And v. 15. <HI>What I would, that do I not, but what I hate, that I do:</HI> Now this cannot be said of any man that is altogether and wholly uncon∣verted and dead in his sins; for he that is wholly unconverted and alienated from God, hateth not sin, and hath not a Will to do that which is good. And <HI>v.</HI> 18. <HI>For to will is present with me, but to perform that which is good, I find not.</HI> And v. 22. <HI>For I delight in the Law of God, after the inward Man.</HI> And v. 25. <HI>So then with the mind I serve the Law of God.</HI> All which places show some beginning of a real Change and work of Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion wrought in him; but yet in this state he was not perfectly set free from all Sin, is also most plain from divers places in that Chapter, as v. 14. <HI>But I am carnal, sold under sin.</HI> And v. 15. <HI>For that which I do, I allow not.</HI> And v. 18. <HI>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.</HI> And v. 23. <HI>But I see another Law in my Members, warring against the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Members.</HI> And v. 24. <HI>O wretched Man that I am! who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI> And though many Professors, who believe not the Possibility of the state
<PB N="75" REF="000691_0084_0FA9A217F0C65018"/>
of a <HI>perfect Freedom from Sin in the mortal Life,</HI> bring this place of Scrip∣ture to prove <HI>That there is no perfect freedom from sin in this Life,</HI> and plead earnestly, that this very state, here described, was <HI>Pauls</HI> present state, which ought not to be granted unto them; for <HI>Paul</HI> did witness a better state, which he described a little after, cap. 8. v. 2. <HI>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Iesus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death</HI>; Yet this ought in all reason to be granted, That <HI>Paul</HI> doth there describe the state or condition of one that hath attain∣ed some beginning of Faith and Sanctification, and is engaged in a holy Warfare against all his Lusts and Sins, that war against his Soul; and though it was not his present state, yet it was the state of some others, yea, of many who had begun in the Spirit, but yet were not attained to a Perfection in the Spirit, and so were partly <HI>Holy</HI> &amp; partly <HI>Vnholy,</HI> partly <HI>renewed</HI> and partly <HI>unrenewed,</HI> partly <HI>carnal</HI> and partly <HI>spiritual,</HI> partly <HI>flesh</HI> and partly <HI>spirit,</HI> partly <HI>gold</HI> and partly <HI>dross</HI>; and it is likely enough <HI>Paul</HI> for some time after his Conversion might have wit∣nessed the like inward Warfare and strugling against Sin, until he did perfectly overcome it. And like to this place in <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. is that other place, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.17. <HI>For the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye can∣not do the things that ye would:</HI> And surely these <HI>Galatians,</HI> to whom <HI>Paul</HI> did write these Lines, were not altogether Unbelievers, but were in some measure partakers of the true Faith, and had in measure the Spirit of Christ, and were the Churches of Christ, though there was divers things faulty in them, yet he calleth them <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Bre∣thren.</HI> And the same Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> writing to the <HI>Collosians,</HI> he calleth them <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>faithful Brethren in Christ,</HI> cap. 1. v. 2. and faith of them, cap. 2. v. 11, 12. <HI>That they were circumcised with the Circumcision made without hands, in the putting off the Body of the sins of the flesh, by the Circumcision of Christ; buried with him in Baptism, wherein also they were risen with him, through the Faith of the Operation of God, who raised him from the dead, &amp;c.</HI> And yet that they were not wholly mortified and cleansed from all sin, so as to have the Nature and Root of it wholly slain and mortified, is evident from his earnest Exhortation unto them, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.5. <HI>Mortifie therefore your Members which are upon Earth, Fornica∣tion, Vncleanness, Inordinate Affection, evil Concupiscience, and Covetous∣ness, which is Idolatry</HI>; which is not so to be understood, as if at that time they did commit these sins particularly mentioned, but because
<PB N="76" REF="000691_0085_0FA9A218B05517B8"/>
the Seed &amp; Root or Nature of these things was not wholly removed &amp; destroyed in them, therefore such an Exhortation was seasonable unto them; for as the Seed and Root of a Plant, is one thing, &amp; the Leaves, Blossom and Fruit, is another, and the Seed and Root may be in a Ground, where it beareth neither Leaf, Blossom nor Fruit, being hindered and suppressed by something contrary to its growth, so sin may be and is, in many, in the Seed and Root and inward Nature of it, and may be felt to stir and move, in some measure, to the Souls grief and burden, and yet not be suffered to bring forth its Acts either of sinful Thoughts, Words or Deeds; and yet, where the Root and Nature of Sin doth remain in any, so long as it doth there remain, they cannot be said to have attained the perfect Freedom from sin, although by the Grace of God, many, to Gods Praise, have attained to that degree in Sanctification and Mortification, that sin doth not reign in their mortal Bodies, but Christ doth much more reign &amp; rule in them, even when they are but Young, and as Children, and of no great growth and experience in the Truth; and where Christ beginneth to reign and rule in his People, he doth it gradually, and by degrees his Rule and Government encreaseth in his People, &amp; by degrees he over∣cometh his and their Souls Enemies; and when, at times, any thing of offence cometh to pass, he executeth his Righteous Judgments against it, and his spiritual Sword is drawn to slay the transgressing Nature, and his spiritual Fire is kindled to burn it up.</P>
<P>And of this gradual Procedure and Progress of the Work of Christ in his People, there are many places of Scripture that witness to it, and many Similitudes, and Figures, and Allegories in Scripture, that hold it forth; as the Wars that <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Ioshua,</HI> and the People of <HI>Israel</HI> had with the People of the Land, on both sides of <HI>Iordan,</HI> and their many Kings and Lords that they had to conquer and overcome, in all, no less Number than Forty two, whereof <HI>Moses,</HI> with the People, over∣came on the other side of <HI>Iordan,</HI> namely, <HI>Syhon,</HI> King of <HI>Heshbon,</HI> and <HI>Og,</HI> King of <HI>Bashon,</HI> (now <HI>Heshbon</HI> is an Hebrew word, and signifieth <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and <HI>Bashan</HI> signifieth the Teeth, and is a manifest Allegory) and after these two great Kings were overcome by <HI>Moses,</HI> on the other side of <HI>Iordan, Ioshua</HI> had no less than thirty one more, and five or six Lords of the <HI>Philistians,</HI> all which he overcame in his time, yet not without a great and long War with them, as is expresly said, <HI>Ios.</HI> 11.18. Joshua <HI>made War a long time with all those Kings</HI>; and even unto <HI>Davids</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="000691_0086_0FA9A21971427170"/>
time, the King of the <HI>Iebusites,</HI> who possessed <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> was not over∣come, but they still possessed it, until <HI>David</HI> overcame them; and ha∣ving overcome <HI>Ierusalem's</HI> Inhabitants, being the last, who were <HI>Iebu∣sites,</HI> (the <HI>Iebusites</HI> signifie, Tredders under feet) there God command∣ed the Temple to be built, for a place of Worship unto him; but the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were not without the Worship of God before that time, although that place was not conquered until <HI>David</HI> did it, and yet not <HI>David,</HI> but <HI>Solomon</HI> built the Temple; and the Rich Materials of Gold and Silver, that built the Temple, were the Spoils that were taken from the Inhabitants of the Land, and partly from the <HI>Egyptians</HI>; all which were Figures &amp; Types of great Mysteries; and it is generally understood and acknowledged, that these outward Wars that the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> had against these Nations under <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Ioshua,</HI> were Types and Figures of the inward and spiritual Wars that the Souls of Men have, under their Leader and Captain, the <HI>Lord Iesus Christ,</HI> against the Lusts that war against the Soul.</P>
<P>And whereas some belonging to these Nations were spared, as the <HI>Gibeonites,</HI> and that even all the <HI>Canaanites</HI> were not quite drove out, but some of them were suffered to remain among the <HI>Israelites,</HI> hath not the signification, which some ignorantly conceive, <HI>viz. That some sins and lusts, that are evil and sinful, do and must remain in the best of Saints for term of Life,</HI> but hath indeed another signification, as namely, the Annimal Affections and Annimal Thoughts &amp; Desires, that are not in themselves (simply considered) evil and sinful, as neither Annimal and Bodily Senses and Functions of the mortal Body, though in the Un∣believing State they are defiled, yet to Believers in Christ Jesus, they are cleansed &amp; sanctified, and made serviceable to the Lord, and to his Truth, and Seed and People, as the <HI>Gibeonites</HI> were made seaviceable to the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> and some others besides, that were spared, yea, the Cattle of some of these Nations, and their Goods were to be saved, and not wholly destroyed; whereas all the Cattle and Goods of some others, were wholly to be destroyed, and nothing to be reserved; all which are plain Figures of spiritual Mysteries, and have a spiritual Signification, which I shall not here enlarge upon.</P>
<P>Again, the Lord Jesus Christ in his spiritual appearance in his People is promised <HI>To be as a Refiners Fire, and as Fullers Soap, and that he shall sit as a Refiner, and Purifier of Silver, and he shall purifie the Sons of</HI> Levi, <HI>and purge them as Gold and Silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an
<PB N="78" REF="000691_0087_0FA9A21A2FFA5D28"/>
Offering in Righteousness.</HI> Now it is well known that the Fullers Soap taketh some time to cleanse a Garment, or Cloth that is defiled; and a Mass or Lump of Silver and of Gold, that hath a great mixture of Dross in it, requireth a time to have it perfectly and wholly refined &amp; seperated from the Dross; and with allusion to the Refiner of Silver and Gold, it is promised, <HI>That Christ shall sit as a Refiner,</HI> implying his Patience and Continuance in that work till it be perfectly done, there∣fore pure Gold is said to be <HI>seven times tryed,</HI> and Silver the like, <HI>Psal.</HI> 12. And Christ compared the <HI>Kingdom of God to a little Leaven that a Woman did take and hide in three Measures of Meal till all be leavened</HI>; and the whole mass or lump of Meal is not instantly leavened, but requires some considerable time. And also, Christ said to his Disciples, <HI>If ye had Faith as a Grain of Mustard-Seed, ye should say to this Mountain, Be removed, and cast into the Sea, and it should be done</HI>; which Mountain, what else is it but sin, that hath had place in mens hearts as a great Mountain, and Faith removeth it, yet not commonly at once, but gradually, as the <HI>little Stone</HI> destroyeth the <HI>Image</HI> by degrees, and then becometh a great Mountain, and filleth the Earth. And <HI>Faith</HI> is com∣pared to a <HI>Grain of Mustard Seed,</HI> because the Mustard-Seed, though little in quantity, yet is great in Virtue, and is Medicinal. And as the Souls gradual freedom from sin, through Faith in the Power of the Lord Jesus Christ, is compared to a <HI>Warfare</HI> in Scripture, so it is compared to divers other things, that require some considerable time, as to a <HI>Husbandry,</HI> a <HI>Building,</HI> and also, to a <HI>Iournying</HI> or <HI>Travel∣ing</HI> from one remote place to another. And it is generally acknow∣ledged, that the sojourning of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> throu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the red Sea and the Wilderness, was a figure of the spiritual Travail of the Soul from Sin to Holiness, and through the Unbelief of the People made their Journying much longer, than it would otherwise have been; yet if they had been duely faithful, it required some con∣siderable time. And Christ in the Parable concerning the Return of the Prodigal to his Fathers House, holds it forth as a considerable long Journey from a far Country; and it is said, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.20. <HI>When he was yet a great way off, his Father saw him, and had Compassion, and ran and fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on his Neek, and kissed him</HI>; Which plainly sheweth, that perfect Freedom from Sin is not at the first instant attained, but requireth some time; for who can say but a good Work was begun in this Pro∣digal Son before he got to his Fathers House, yea, as soon as he began to travel towards it.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="000691_0088_0FA9A21AF0E87E18"/>But, <HI>lastly,</HI> The Work of God in the hearts of his People, is not only compared to a <HI>formation</HI> or <HI>generation</HI> of the Birth in the Mothers Belly, which requireth some considerable time before it be perfectly formed, but also to <HI>Gods Work of Creation,</HI> wherein six days he made Heavens and Earth; and waving altogether that part of the Question, <HI>What dayes these were, whether common and natural days?</HI> it is clear from the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> that our Perfection in Christ is understood to be that <HI>Sabbath</HI> or <HI>Rest</HI> into which Believers do enter, and whereof they have not a full Possession until they have laboured and wrought with God through a Week of six days, in order to attain to that blessed Sabbath, therefore he thus exhorts, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.11. <HI>Let us labour therefore to enter into that Rest,</HI> although he, and others to whom he writes, were at that time true Believers in Christ; and indeed, there is a plain and manifest Analogy betwixt each days work in the outward Creation, and every days work of the New Creation of God in our Souls, as we are Workers together with him, which here I shall not insist upon to describe, but refer to a particular Head at the end of this Treatise. Now as in the seventh day it is said, <HI>God ended (or perfected) his Works which he had made,</HI> so in the seventh spiritual Day of Christs Appearance in us, he doth perfect his Work, but not till then: And are not many come to the first days Work, and no further? others are come to the second, others to the third, and so onwards to the sixt. And that the Work of Salvation from Sin, is gradual, and is not com∣pleated how soon it is begun, is clear from the words of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> encourageing some to whom he writ, <HI>That God who had begun his good Work in them will perform it, untill the Day of Christ,</HI> Phil. 1.6 And said the same Apostle, writing to the <HI>Romans,</HI> cap. 13.11. <HI>Now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed</HI>; which shewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, that there are degrees of Salvation, even from Sin.</P>
<P>But for the further understanding of the <HI>Doctrine of Perfection,</HI> and the <HI>Souls Travail in the way towards it,</HI> take these following short Con∣siderations:</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> According to the diverse sence of the word [<HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct</HI>] it may be said, in one sence, that every part of God's Work in us is Perfect, from first to last, that is to say, it hath nothing of Defilement or Blame-worthyness in it, and therefore whatever Imperfection is in any, it is theirs, and not Gods.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> As a little Gold well purified and refined, is perfect Gold,
<PB N="80" REF="000691_0089_0FA9A0DEF56CF8B0" MS="y"/>
although another part that did belong to that mass, is imperfect, and hath a great mixture of Dross, so the Faith, Love and Hope, and all other Virtues, that are of Gods begetting and working in his People, are <HI>Perfect,</HI> in that sence, that is to say, they have no Sin nor Defile∣ment belonging to them, although there may be Sin and Defilement in a Man that hath, in measure, these Virtues; for that Poor Man that said unto Christ, <HI>Lord, I believe, help my Vnbelief,</HI> had both true Faith and Unbelief in him at one time, although Virtue and Vice cannot be together in one man, in any intense or strong degree; and where true Faith, Love, Hope, and other Virtues have place in any Man, the Sins and Vices, even in respect of the Roots and Natures of them, are drove into a Corner, and are not suffered to reign.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> There are many sorts of Sins, the which if acted outwardly with the Body, or if loved and entertained in the Soul, do certainly kill the Souls Life, as to God; and whoever doth commit them cannot be said to remain sanctified, or to retain any degree of true Sanctifica∣tion, such as <HI>Drunkenness, Theft, Murder, Adultery,</HI> and all such gross things. But there are other sins, and sinful weaknesses and blemishes, that though they do not kill the Souls Life, as unto God, yet wound it, and weaken it, and the least sin that is burdens and hurts the tender Plant of Righteousness where-ever it is planted in any, and where-ever it is suffered to act so much as in a thought or word, it clouds and vails the Soul in measure, and defileth it; for the least sin is a defiling and hurtful Nature.</P>

<P>With these, and the like close and near Questions, if many would
<PB N="84" REF="000691_0093_0FA9A0D62FE8C158" MS="y"/>
impartially examine themselves, no doubt they would find great cause of Humiliation before the Lord, and to beg the pardon, as of many Sins, both of Omission and Commission, so for their great sin of Pride, and thinking of themselves above what they are.</P>
<P>But as I have nothing against the Doctrine of Perfection, as a thing possible to be attained in this Mortal Life, by the Grace of Christ, so I greatly dislike that any should imagine they are come to it, who are very short of it; and I do judge it is a very great Error, and exceed∣ing hurtful to hold it for Doctrine, <HI>That every one that hath the least measure of true Christianity, or Faith, or Sanctification, is perfectly sancti∣fied, washed and cleansed</HI>; The plain tendency of which is to drive some to Presumption, and others to Desparation; for some are na∣turally more inclined to presume than others, and to think too much of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mselves; and these who believe this Doctrine, will conclude, (if they feel the least degree of Sanctification) they are <HI>Perfect</HI>; for according to this most false and absurd Doctrine, there is no middle State or Condition betwixt <HI>perfectly Holy</HI> and <HI>perfectly Vnholy, perfectly Carnal</HI> and <HI>perfectly Spiritual,</HI> every one is <HI>perfect Gold</HI> or <HI>perfect Dross</HI>; for there is no mixture of Gold and Dross in one Vessel, according to this false Doctrine. Others again, who are more naturally fearful, and jealous, receiving this absurd Doctrine, because they feel some∣what of Sin and Unholiness remaining in them; will conclude, they have nothing of Holiness in them at all, nothing of Faith, nothing of Hope, nothing of Virtue, they are wholly without, they have wholly lost their Condition; and because they feel some Malady or Distemper in them, therefore they have nothing of Health or Soundness; and be∣cause the feet are unclean, and need washing, therefore neither hand nor head, nor any part in them hath any Purity in the least. But this is far contrary to Christs Doctrine, which saith, <HI>He who is clean needeth not safe to wash his feet.</HI></P>
<P>But some who hold this absurd Doctrine, have some seeming Reasons and Arguments for what they say, as 1<HI>st. If God and Christ save not all men perfectly at once, and doth not perfectly restore them, or in as short time as</HI> Adam <HI>lost himself, and fell from his state, then Sin and the Devil is stronger than God and Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answer</HI>; It doth not follow; for at this rate, not only all Be∣lievers must be perfectly saved, and washed, and healed at once, but all men must be perfectly saved also, and that at one touch; for God
<PB N="85" REF="000691_0094_0FA9A0D6F29B94E8" MS="y"/>
and Christ are present, and at work in all men, in order to save them. But the Vanity and Folly of this Argument may easily appear by the like Reasonings: A Man burneth his House in one hour, and the King taketh Compassion on the Man, and buildeth up his House again, but not in one Hour, but in some Days, Weeks or Moneths, Therefore the Man is greater and stronger than the King. A Child woundeth himself mortally with a Knife in one instant, but the skillfull Physi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian doth not cure him till after some days, and therefore the Child is stronger than the Man. But to answer more directly, I say, it is one thing what God can do, and another thing what God willeth to do: That God can perfectly heal and cleanse the Soul from all sin in a Mo∣ment or instant, none will deny, but it is not his Will so to do, and he seeth not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it in his infinite Wisdom to do it, but rather to effect the cure by little and little, that the Soul that hath sinned with too great ease and delight, may find it self cured through pain and smarting, and with great difficulty, that sin may be the more distasted, and the Soul may be the more careful not to sin against the Lord for time to come, that it may have to say, as one said, when tempted to commit a great sin, <HI>I will not buy Repentance at so dear a Rate.</HI> If God did cure and heal mens Souls by absolute Power and Will, that were in all respects irresistible, and did the Cure without all pain and difficulty to the Soul, it might easily relapse into sin again; but the great sorrow, pain and difficulty that the Soul feeleth in its being healed, even by the hand of the Lord, maketh it the more wary for time to come, accor∣ding to the Proverb, <HI>Burnt Children dread the Fire.</HI></P>
<P>Again, some argue thus, <HI>Christs curing the Bodily Diseases of all that be cured, and raising the dead, did it at onc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by one word or touch, and never at twice, except in that one case of a certain blind man, whose Eyes he opened at first to see men as Trees, and next to see perfestly; and Christ is a perfect Saviour, and worketh not by halves, and therefore he cureth and healeth all Souls perfectly at once, or at least at twice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This Argument destroyeth it self, for it confesseth that Christ did not cure that blind Man at once; and if· that do not argue, that Christ is not a perfect Physitian, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he did not cure once, no more doth it argue that he is not a perfect Physitian, though he cure no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Souls of men generally neither at two or three words or touches, alto∣gether fully and perfectly. And we have other Examples and Instances of Christs gradual curing men, and that not perfectly all at once, as
<PB N="86" REF="000691_0095_0FA9A0D961F76770"/>
in his opening the Eyes of another blind man, <HI>Iohn</HI> 9.6. it is said, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on the ground, and made Clay of the Spittle, and he anointed the Eyes of the blind Man with the clay, and said unto him, <HI>Go, wash <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Pool of</HI> Siloam, which is by interpretation [<HI>sent</HI>] he went his wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore and washed, and came seeing.

And also, his curing the mans Son possessed with a Deaf and Dumb Spirit, after the Spirit was commanded to come out of him, he cryed, and rent him sore, and came out of him, and he was as one dead, but Jesus took him by the hand, and lift him up. Again, when Christ raised <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the dead, observe these steps, 1<HI>st.</HI> he commanded them to take away the Stone, 2<HI>dly.</HI> he prayed to his Father, and gave Thanks, lifting up his Eyes, 3<HI>dly.</HI> He cryed with a loud Voice, <HI>Lazarus, Come forth</HI>; But when he came forth, he was bound hand and foot with Grave Cloathes, and his face was bound about with a Napkin, therefore Jesus said, <HI>Loose him, and let him go</HI>; all which hath a spiritual signifi∣cation, and is acknowledged by many to signifie the gradual working of Christ, in raising the dead Souls of Men; and when raised, yet for some time they are bound, as it were, with Grave Cloathes, till they be loosed.

And what other signification can that have, of the Prophet, bidding <HI>Naaman</HI> wash seven

times in <HI>Iordan,</HI> in order to be cleansed of his Leprosie, (as accordingly he did) but to point at the gradual cleansing of the Soul, as it is not only once or twice, but seven times washed in the spiritual <HI>Iordan,</HI> or River of Judgment, the Number Seven being a perfect Number, answering to the seventh Day and seventh Year, which was Sabbatical But I answer further, Although Christs curing outward Diseases was a Figure and Sign of his curing mens Souls, as to the Substance, yet not as to all the Circumstances thereof; for, 1<HI>st,</HI> Many were cured of their Bodily Diseases, and some raised from the dead to Life, without any thing on their part, in way of concurrance, but were meerly passive, as those who were raised from the dead, &amp; healed of Madness, having unclean Spirits cast out of him. 2<HI>dly,</HI> Christ cured them commonly by his Bodily Touch, and Voice of Words uttered with his Bodily Mouth, and by his Bodily Presence with them for most part, his divine Power working invisibly therewith, and he who cured them, they saw him, and heard him with Bodily Organs; but it is not so now with all whose Souls he cureth; for many Thousands have been cured by his great Power, who have neither outwardly seen nor heard him, but only believed in him. 3<HI>dly,</HI> These whom he Bodily cured remained still mortal Men, and subject to following Diseases, and Bodily Death it self; but the Souls of many are so cured and healed by Christ, that they never dye any more, but remain forever sensible of that Immortal Life and Power that first quickened them. And though Christs curing and healing the Souls of his People be gradual, and not all done at once, yet it is done effectually and perfectly in his own time, as the Souls of the Patients are faithful and careful to observe his Commands. And though the Lord was a perfect Physitian to <HI>David,</HI> and did perfectly heal him, and restore him to health of Soul, after his great sin and fall, in the case of <HI>Vriah,</HI> yet he did not work that cure in him al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at once, but after some considerable time, as <HI>Davids</HI> words in divers of his <HI>Psalms</HI> plainly demonstrate, where he declareth how sensible he was of the disease of his Soul, and went under great heavyness and smarting, in the sence of his sins, and that for a considerable time, and did go through much inward Affliction and Trouble before he was perfectly cured and restored, (see for this <HI>Psal.</HI> 6.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. throughout, and <HI>Psal.</HI> 13, &amp; 25, &amp; 29. v. 9, 10. &amp; <HI>Psal.</HI> 32. v. 34. &amp; <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.) for indeed the Lords way &amp; method of curing mens Souls, is first to wound and make them sick and full of pain, as <HI>David</HI> witnessed, and then gradually to
<PB N="88" REF="000691_0097_0FA9A0DAC6895AE8" MS="y"/>
heal; whereas when Christ cured mens Bodies, he did not pain them.</P>
<P>And whereas they further argue, <HI>That as a Child is a perfect Child, and doth perfectly obey the Fathers Command, though he be not a Man, and cannot do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Man doth, yet if he do whatsoever his Father commands him, he sinneth not, as if the Father say to one Child that is but weak, bring me ten Pounds, if he bring the ten Pounds, though he hath not strength to bring an hundred Pounds, as another that is stronger than he hath, yet he doth perfectly obey his Fathers Will, and sinneth not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> All Comparisons and Similitudes hold not in all respects, nor doth this similitude prove what is intended; for though a Child may perfectly obey his Fathers Command in one or more things, yet it doth not follow that he doth so in all things; in some things he may fall short, and have a Will to do more than he doth well perform, yea, when the Child is bringing the ten Pounds to his Father, through rash∣ness, and too great haste, he may fall, and hurt himself in his face, or dirty his cloathes; and its rare but Children in many things do amiss, for they are oft foolish, and of little Understanding, and yet have greater Confidence often than Men of Years and Experience. And concerning whom did <HI>Iames</HI> say, <HI>In many things we offend all?</HI> was it not concerning them who were as Children, at least, and whom he calleth Brethren? And said, <HI>Iohn, Little Children, these things I have writ unto you, that ye sin not, and if any sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, &amp;c.</HI> where he taketh it for granted, that these who are in the state of Children may sin, and yet every sin doth not altogether make them cease to be Children, or cause the Father to dis-inherit them. And even as in Natural Children, there are frequently divers things faulty and blame-worthy, which a tender Father passeth by, and easily pardoneth, when the Child retaineth true Love to him; so in such who are but as Children in the Truth, there are too often divers things faulty, and blame-worthy, yet because they retain true Love to God in measure, he doth not reject them, but own them in their Childish state.</P>
<P>And as concerning these words in <HI>Iohn [He who is born of God sinneth not, &amp;c.]</HI> It is to be considered, that to be throughly and entirely born of God, is an high state, and doth not belong to all who may be called (in a Scripture sence) Children, as in the Childs state; for to be throughly born of God, is to be wholly renewed and sanctified, so as to have nothing of the Flesh or unrenewed Nature remaining in
<PB N="89" REF="000691_0098_0FA9A0DB789C2448"/>
them; but this is an high state, and is not the attainment, of every due in whom that good work of Sanctification is begun. And it may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the Birth of God, or what is begotten of God in man, sinneth not; and Man (so far as he is spiritually renewed and born again▪ sin∣neth not, the Heaven-born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sinneth not; but yet in many there remaineth an unrenewed part, that may and doth oft sin, untill it be changed and renewed.</P>
<P>And as concerning that other Doctrine, <HI>That none are to preach Christ to others, but who are perfectly free from all Sin in Thought, Word and Deed:</HI> It were indeed greatly to be wished that there were many such Preach∣ers, and all Preachers should have some real Experience of a good Work of God begun in them, and be in some measure truely sanctified, and free of all scandal in Life and Conversation. But to say, that none but such as are wholly perfected, and free from the least sin or blemish, hath no warrant from Scripture, as if the least sinful defect or blemish did altogether unminister them, or make them fall from their Ministry; for though <HI>Iudas</HI> fell from his Ministry by Transgression, because it was of a heinous sort, yet so did not all the Disciples, who had some Weaknesses, divers of them, as is recorded; for if the least sinful weakness doth take from a man his Ministry, then <HI>Moses</HI>'s Trespass at the Waters of Strife did take his Ministry from him, and the Con∣tention betwixt <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> did take away the Ministry from one of them at least; for one, if not both, were faulty; and that for which <HI>Peter</HI> was reproved by <HI>Paul,</HI> did take away his Ministry; al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which are false; and therefore so is that Doctrine from which such a false Conclusion doth proceed▪ I need say no more to this Head, be∣cause it is so connected with the former that it doth depend on it; and therefore the first falling, the latter doth fall with it.</P>
<P>Error 27. <HI>That there is no coming again of Christ to judge the Quick and the Dead, but that only which is already witnessed within us; but that there shall not be any Coming or Appearing of Christ in his glorified Nature and Body of Man without us, in my Age or Time to come.</HI></P>
<P>Er. 28. <HI>That there is no general Iudgment Day to come at the end of the World, but every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hath all the Reward or Punish∣ment, that he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>

are come to the Resurrection, and there is no other to be expected; and that all holy Men and Women immediately after Death have got all the Reward and Resurrection that was or is to be expected, and they wait for nothing more than what they then received.</HI></P>
<P>Er. 30. <HI>That they who are perfectly sanctified, are already fully come to the New Heavens &amp; the New Earth, and all that is written in the Prophecies of the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament concerning the New Hea∣vens and the New Earth, is already witnessed and fullfilled to such as are perfectly sanctified.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Correct.</HI> All these are great and hurtful Errors, and very unbecoming such who not only pretend to be <HI>Christians</HI> of the more common sort, but who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to a degree of Knowledge and Understanding in the Scriptures beyond many others, as some do to my certain Knowledge. Now these Errors are so linked together one with another, that they stand and fall together, therefore I need say the less to the Refutation or Correction of every one of them. And as concerning the first of these four Errors here mention'd, it depends upon another great Error above refuted and corrected, to wit, <HI>That Christ is now in Heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, only God, without any Cloathing or Garment of mans glorified Nature, of Soul and Body; and that the spiritual Body he hath now in Heaven is only and alone his Godhead, as he was from all Eternity, which is Infinite, Almighty, and every where present:</HI> Which is well nigh as gross an Assertion as any doth or can hold; for it is no where said in Scripture, <HI>That the God∣head is a spiritual Body,</HI> but it is said, <HI>That God is a Spirit.</HI> And as concerning Christs Body that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had of the Virgin, and was crucified, dyed and buried, it is not every where present; for after Christ rose from the Dead, the Angel told the Women, <HI>That he was not in the Grave, but was risen</HI>; and <HI>Peter</HI> hath declared concerning Christ, <HI>That the Heavens must receive him until the Time of the Restitution of all things</HI>; and then God shall send him from Heaven; Which must needs be un∣derstood of his Body, and Bodily Presence, at the Son of Man. And said Christ (concerning his Bodily Presence and Appearance) to his Disciples, <HI>The Poor ye have alwayes with you, but me ye have not alwayes.</HI> And when they were sorry that he was going away, he comforted them by telling them, not only that he would come again in Spirit, but also <HI>That he would come again, after he had gone to prepare a place for them in Heaven, and receive them unto his self, that where he was, there they might
<PB N="91" REF="000691_0100_0FA9A0DCF77EE8C0"/>
be also</HI>; Which hath a respect to his coming at the end of the World, at the Resurrection of the Dead. And when Christ was taken up Bo∣dily into Heaven, while the Disciples lookt stedfastly towards Heaven, as he went up, it is said, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.10, 11. <HI>Behold, two Men stood by them in white Apparel,</HI> (whether these were Angels, or some of the Saints that arose after Christs Resurrection, I shall not meddle here to deter∣mine) <HI>which also said, Ye Men of</HI> Galilee, <HI>why stand ye gazing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heaven? This same Iesus which is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come in like manner, as ye have seen him go into Heaven</HI>; and surely that was without them. And though it is well done to contradict the carnal conceit of such who carn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly imagine, that Christ is in Heaven with a carnal Body, and did so ascend, and will again so descend, like our <HI>carnal body,</HI> &amp; shall have a carnal Sword (as some grosly imagine) to destroy his Enemies; yet it is not good, but very hurtful to run into such an ex∣tream, as because Christ hath not a gross material and carnal Body, such as we have, and will not descend with a gross material carnal Body, therefore he will descend wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h no Body at all without us, and have no outward Coming at the Resurrection of the Dead; and so would confine &amp; limit all coming of Christ only to his inward Coming and in his Saints; and as if the Saints in the World to come were to have no other Knowledge of Christ, nor acquaintance with him, but only within them. But seeing Christ is in Heaven in the intire glorifi∣ed Nature of Man, both in Soul and Body, and in that Nature is Head and King of the Saints, it doth add (not a little) to the Com∣fort and Happiness of the Saints, that they shall not only know, see and enjoy him inwardly with the Eyes of their Souls, but that they shall also know, see and enjoy him without them, seeing him Bodily with the Eyes of their Resurrection Bodies, which shall be made able to behold him. And though the Wicked shall be raised also in vile and dishonourable Bodiee, and shall be made to see him, yet it shall be in another manner then the Saints shall see him, for it shall be to their great Trror and Torment; therefore it is said, <HI>He shall ap∣pear in flaming Fire</HI> (when he shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels) <HI>taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ,</HI> 2 Thes. 1.7, 8. for as Christs inward Appearance is after one manner to his Saints, even most lovely gentle and aimable, but after another manner to the Wicked, even
<PB N="92" REF="000691_0101_0FA9A0DDAE55B1C0" MS="y"/>
dreadful and terrible, and is compared to <HI>devouring Fire</HI> in Scripture, so it will be in that Day, in the outward, insomuch that the Wicked will then cry, <HI>Hills and Mountains, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the Throne, Rev.</HI> 6.16. compare with <HI>Luke</HI> 23.30.</P>
<P>And whereas some say, <HI>They can own no other Body of Christ but that which he giveth his Saints to feed upon, to wit, his Flesh, which is Meat indeed, and his Blood which is Drink indeed; and this is not confined to any one place, but is every where where the Saints are, who feed upon it in all places, whether when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> together, or in private places, and Dungeons, where they may be Prisoners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answer</HI>; The Body of Christ is one, even as Christ is one; but that Christ is one, doth not hinder that he hath a two fold Nature, to wit, the one of his Godhead, the other of his Manhood, forever united together in most excellent and admirable Unity; yet the Godhead of Christ is not his Manhood. Again, as concerning the <HI>Manhood of Christ,</HI> we ought, according to Scripture, to distinguish betwixt his <HI>Body,</HI> and <HI>Flesh,</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> as he is, and was the heavenly Man in all Ages of the World, and was before the World was, and who fed the Saints in all Ages, as well before Christ came in the Flesh as since, with his heavenly Flesh and Blood, that is spiritually or mystically so called, as it is also called <HI>Bread, Wine, Milk, Honey, Marrow</HI> &amp; <HI>Fatness,</HI> and which is proper and belonging to him, as he is the Heavenly Man, or Lord from Heaven, before he took Flesh in the Virgins Womb. I say, we ought to distinguish betwixt his Flesh and Nature which he giveth us to partake of and feed upon, and that Flesh and Nature of ours which he did partake of, that is of a far inferiour kind, in it self con∣sidered, yet is now wonderfully exalted and glorified in Heaven with himself.</P>
<P>And as concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, as he is and was the hea∣venly Man, in his heavenly Flesh &amp; Blood before this World was, and is the Food of the Saints, he neither can nor ought to be understood as limitted or confined to any particular place, visible or invisible, but is every where present, giving Being, Life and Virtue to all Creatures, according to their various Capacities. But when we speak of the Body of Christ, as it was born of the Virgin, and appeared among the Dis∣ciples, was crucified, dead and buried, and rose and ascended into Hea∣ven, and is now in Heaven, we ought to consider, that, as when it was upon Earth, though the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in it, yet
<PB N="93" REF="000691_0102_0FA9A0E158008030"/>
it was not every where present, but was sometimes in one place and sometimes in another; so now that it is in Heaven, it is not every where present, but doth there remain, and will, until the time ap∣pointed; and though the Fullness of the Godhead dwelleth in it, yet that is not so to be understood, as if the Godhead were confined to that Body, and were no where else but where that Body is; but it hath this sence, That such a Fullness of Gods Presence, and of the divine Grace, Life, Power and Virtue, Light, Wisdom &amp; Knowledge doth dwell in him, as in no other whomsoever, neither Angels nor Saints; and out of that fullness which dwelt, and still dwelleth Bodily in him, all Saints and Angels receive proportionably, and Grace for Grace, as <HI>Iohn</HI> hath declared. And it may and ought to be acknowledged, That the Man Christ Jesus, the Son of <HI>David,</HI> and the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who is now glorified in Heaven, in that Nature and Seed which he did take, doth send forth into all his Saints, divine Communications and Influences of Light, Life and Grace, and divine Power and Virtue, to quicken, refresh and comfort them, as also to teach and instruct them still more and more in the Mysteries of his heavenly Kingdom; and by these divine Communications and Participations of Light, Life and Grace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are united unto him, and he unto them, as the Mem∣bers are unto the Head, and their Prayers and Breathings ascend unto him, which he presenteth unto the Father; and as they feel and are sensible of his divine Power and Virtue▪ as really as if he were Bodily present, so he feeleth and is sensible of all their Sufferings, Afflictions, Wants, Necessities, Tryals, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntations and Exercises of all sorts, whereby they are greatly encouraged to pray unto him, and to come unto God by him, who is their merciful High-Priest and Advocate with the Father. And it is the <HI>Man Christ Iesus</HI> who hath received the holy Spirit above measure, and all spiritual Gifts, Virtues and Bles∣sings, that sendeth down the same to his Saints on Earth. And it is by his Grace, Virtue, Light, Life and Power, that all who become Saints, are converted and renewed, so as of <HI>Vnholy</HI> to become <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Holy</HI>; for it was the Man Christ Jesus that said, <HI>And I, when I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up, will draw all Men after me</HI>; and of him it was prophecyed in the <HI>Psalms, That when he should ascend on High, he should receive Gifts for Men, even for the Rebellious</HI>; and such as he received he gave them, to turn them from being Rebellions, to be his Servants and Subjects. And seeing it is acknowledged by many from good Experi∣ence,
<PB N="94" REF="000691_0103_0FA9A0E1706A8030"/>
and the Scriptures Testimony, That <HI>Holy Men</HI> have fellowship together in the Spirit, as Fellow Members of one Body, and influence one another, and convey to one another spiritual and divine Commu∣nications of Life, Grace and Virtue, from Christ their Head, and that at any distance, as outwardly, in order to quicken, refresh, comfort and strengthen one another; it must needs be acknowledged, That the Saints on Earth have Fellowship with the Man Christ in Heaven, in the Spirit much more, and receive divine Communications and Influences from him of divine Grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Virtue, Light and Love, as so many Rayes and Beams from him, who is the Sun of Righteousness, and hath that place and Office in his Church, as the outward Sun hath in the Firmament to the Earth, and the Stars of Heaven; and who doth also in a general way enlighten every man that cometh into the World; and as he was the Light of the World, and did in some measure lighten all men in all Ages, even before he came in the flesh, so now, after he is come in the flesh, and was dead, and is risen again, he doth more enlighten Mankind than formerly, where ever his Name is faithfully preached, as <HI>Paul</HI> preached concerning him, <HI>That he should be the first that should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the Dead, and give Light to the</HI> Gentiles, to wit, more abundantly after his Resurrection than before, to all who should hear his Name faithfully preached, and believe and obey. And for these, and the like Considerations, it may and ought to be acknow∣ledged, that all true Believers, though they eat not of Christs Body that was broken for them on the Tree of the Cross, with the outward Mouth, yet by Faith they spiritually and mystically feed upon him, and eat his Flesh and drink his Blood, even that Body of his that was cru∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied on the Gross, &amp; his Blood that was then shed, when the Souldier pierced his side with the Spear, according to which <HI>Augustine,</HI> above twelve hundred Years ago, said, <HI>Grede et Manducasti,</HI> i. e. <HI>Believe and thou hast eat</HI>; for Christ as he suffered for us in the Flesh, apprehended by us with a living Faith, is as a Feast unto us; and this was signified by eating the Paschal Lamb, and Flesh of the Sacrifices under the Law, and by the Parable of eating the fatted Calf, under the Gospel.</P>
<P>But now as concerning Christs Coming and Appearance, that is yet to be, even without us, in his glorified Body, in the time appointed, when he shall come to judge both the Quick and the Dead, I shall cite some further Testimonies of holy Scripture, which will sufficiently prove the thing to such who are not blinded with Prejudice against
<PB N="95" REF="000691_0104_0FA9A0E237676920" MS="y"/>
such a precious Truth, Mat. 26.64. <HI>I say unto you</HI> [he was speaking to the Council and high Priest of the <HI>Iews,</HI> who took Council to put him to Death] <HI>Hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the Right Hand of Power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven:</HI> Which words have a plain Reference to his coming to judge both the Quick and the Dead in that great Day of Judgment, at the end of the World (com∣pare this with <HI>Mark</HI> 14.62. Now that the real sence of Christs words is, that they should see him, not only inwardly to condemn them by his Light in their Consciences, but also outwardly in that very Bodily Nature wherein they denyed him to be the true Christ▪ is most clear to all who are not willfully prejudiced against the Truth of it; for the <HI>Iews</HI> did generally believe that there was to be a Day of Judgment, and that the Light or Spirit of God in their hearts would inwardly Judge all Men in that Day, and therefore that was not it which they reckoned Blasphemy in Christ, to affirm; But that he whom they sought to put to Death, the Son of Man, born of <HI>Mary,</HI> and whose Body they saw standing before them, should in the same Body and Nature come in the Clouds of Heaven to judge them for their Impiety, This they judged great Blasphemy. Again, we have the Manner and Circumstances of his outward Appearance in that gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Day, very plainly described, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. from v. 31. to the end, where its said, <HI>When the Son of Man shall come in his Glory, and all the holy Angels with him, thou shall he sit upon the Throne of his Glory, and before him shall be gathered all Nations, and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his Sheep from the Goats,</HI> [for until that time, good and bad will remain together in this World, not only in one Nation, but in one House or Family] <HI>Then shall the King say unto them on his Right Hand, &amp;c.</HI> Now that this cannot be wholly a thing or action to be done in every mans Conscience, (as some imagine) altho' the Book of Conscience will then be fully opened, with the other Books, and Christs Light in the Conscience will manifestly witness against the Wicked, and for the Righteous; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s all Nations are to appear be∣fore Christ, as he is the Son of Man, in their Resurrection Bodies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Just in glorious Bodies, and the Unjust in vile &amp; dishonourable Bodies, so Christ is also to appear in his Resurrection Body, even the same wherein he was crucified, but wonderfully changed in Manner and Condition, yet the same for Substance; but to say, all this is wholly in action to be done within every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> if all Nations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be

gathered within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man, and the Sheep were to be set on the Right Hand within every man, and the Goats on the left hand within every man, is such a gross Perversion and Abuse of holy Scripture, that to mention it, is sufficient to refute it; for at this rate every man hath all Nations, good and bad▪ within him, and both Heaven and Hell at once; than which there can be no greater Confusion, nor greater abuse and Perversion of holy Scripture. And to this glorious Time of Christs Bodily Appearance, as the Son of Man, that place, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.28. hath a plain Reference, <HI>Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit in the Throne of his Glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of</HI> Israel; where some <HI>Greek</HI> Copies placing the Comma before these words, <HI>in the Regeneration,</HI> make that clause (<HI>In the Regeneration</HI>) to refer to the time of Christs Coming, and the Resurrection of the Dead, which is a sort of Regeneration, even as the new Body of Corn, that riseth out of the seed that is sown, is a true Regeneration; and with this com∣pare these parallel places, <HI>Mark</HI> 10.29, 30. and <HI>Luke</HI> 18.29, 30. Where note, that the Hundreds of folds, or Manifolds, relate to Christs Coming, which then shall be paid them, or rather freely given them, together with what they lost, some in the same things, as <HI>Fathers, Brethren</HI> and <HI>Kindred,</HI> and some in the equivolent. And whereas it is said▪ <HI>Mark</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.30▪ (<HI>with Persecutions</HI>) it is a false Translation, for then shall be no Persecution, but the <HI>Greek</HI> word, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, signifieth, as well, <HI>Things that follow,</HI> as to say, <HI>cum Consequentibus,</HI> or <HI>cum Pert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nentibus,</HI> i. e. <HI>with the Consequents</HI> or <HI>Pertinents.</HI> And whereas it is said▪ <HI>Now in this Time,</HI> it should rather be translated, <HI>Now in That Time,</HI> to wit, at Christs Bodily Appearance, when they shall be openly reward∣ed in the sight of their Enemies, who did openly persecute and spoil them. And surely such an open way that shall have an outward De∣monstration to mens sight, as well as inward to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, both of Christ's being rewarded of his Father, after all his great Sufferings, and also of the Saints, their being rewarded with him, after all their Sufferings, is that which doth most excellently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both with the Good∣ness and VVisdom of God, and also with his Justice; for in this world the Justice of God (although they are exceeding blind who see not the secret Tracts of it), doth not so evidently appear to all; as then it shall do, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concerning this Coming and Appearance of Christ, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid over without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his glorified Body, and the Hope▪

Expectation and Faith that the Saints had of the same, to their great Comfort, and what use they made of it, to their Progress, in perfect∣ing Holiness in the fear of the Lord, consider the following places of Scripture, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.30. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.4. <HI>cap.</HI> 1.7. 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 2.28. &amp; 3.2, 3. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.14. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.10. &amp; 4.1, 8. <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.13. <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.3.27, 30, 37, 39. <HI>Mark</HI> 13.26. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.23. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.19. &amp; 3.13. &amp; 4.15. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.1. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.7. And there are many Testimonies of the Old Testament that confirm the same Truth, of which see these following, <HI>Dan.</HI> 7.9, 10, 13, 14. <HI>Zech.</HI> 14.5. <HI>Psal.</HI> 96.13. <HI>Isa.</HI> 13.9. and of this outward Coming of the Lord Jesus in the end of the World, <HI>Enoch,</HI> the seventh from <HI>Adam,</HI> prophecyed, as <HI>Iude</HI> relateth, <HI>cap.</HI> 14. And that <HI>Iude</HI> doth take particular notice, that <HI>Enoch</HI> was the seventh from <HI>Adam</HI> (as the Book of <HI>Genesis</HI> declareth) doth plainly point at the seventh Age of the World in which this should come to pass; and as the <HI>Iewish</HI> Sabbath began on the Evening of the sixth Day, before the sixth Day was wholly expired some considerable time, so there is cause to believe, That that great Sabbath shall begin some considerable time before the six thousand Years of the World be expired (<HI>but more of this in the Chronology.</HI>)</P>
<P>And whereas it is said, <HI>Christ shall come in the Clouds of Heaven</HI>; by these Clouds partly may be understood, these great Multitudes of Angels and Saints, in the midst of whom he shall come, even as a King in the midst of his Army or Attendants. And that it is said, <HI>Zech.</HI> 14.4. <HI>His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of</HI> Olives (near to which was the Valley of <HI>Iehosephat,</HI> where, it is said, <HI>The Lord will sit to judge all the</HI> Heathen <HI>round about, Ioel</HI> 3.2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,) <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it may well enough be translated, <HI>Above the Mountain of Olives</HI>; for the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>(Gnal)</HI> signifieth <HI>above,</HI> as well as <HI>upon</HI>; for neither the outward Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> nor the Valley of <HI>Iehosephat</HI> can contain any great part of the Nations that are there to be gathered; but the place where the Lord will appear to judge all Nations, will be some where in the Air, above that place, where Christ ascended; for <HI>Paul</HI> telleth, <HI>That the Saints shall have their Bodies changed in a Moment or Twinkling of an Eye, and shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the Air</HI>; for both Christs Resurrection Body, and the Resurrection Bodies of the Saints, at their appearance shall have no heavyness nor weight to incline them to the Glob of the Earth, as Christs Body now in Heaven hath none. But
<PB N="98" REF="000691_0107_0FA9A0E46D140618"/>
seeing Christs glorified Body is not every where at once, nor shall the glorified Bodies of the Saints at the Resurrection be every where at once, it is most equal and rational, according to Scripture, to believe, that they shall appear in some certain place above the Glob of the Earth, over or above the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> where Christ ascended, after he rose from the Dead. And though the Resurrection Body of a Saint cannot be in all places at once, yet without doubt they can move from one place to another at any distance, upwards or downwards, South, North, East or VVest, in the twinckling of an Eye, or according to the swiftness of a Thought, which is easie to understand to such who know, that some of the movable Stars and Luminaries move some hundreds of Miles in less than one Minute of Time, some of which are greater Bodies than the Glob of the Earth.</P>
<P>But against Christs outward Appearance in his glorified Body, some object <HI>Iohn</HI> 14.19▪ <HI>Yet a little while and the World seeth me no more.</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>I Answer</HI>; These words are so far from being any proof against Christs outward Appearance in his glorified Body at the time appointed, that it is a good Proof for it; for he doth not say, after I go away the World seeth me no more, but <HI>yet a little while, &amp;c.</HI> and within that little while he promised, that his Disciples should see him, to wit, spiritually and inwardly present with them, the which <HI>little while</HI> containeth the space of time betwixt his Bodily Ascention into Heaven, and his Return; the which▪ though in it self considered, is a large time, yet compared with the Ages in the World to come, may well be called <HI>a little Time, A Thousand Years with the Lord being as one Day.</HI> And whereas the <HI>English</HI> Translation hath it, <HI>The World seeth me no more,</HI> the words (<HI>no more</HI>) cannot exclude all time to come, but only some limitted time; for the <HI>Greek</HI> word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is most properly trans∣lated <HI>not as yet,</HI> and doth relate to some limited time, as is plain from <HI>Mark</HI> 14.25. <HI>I will drink no more (or, not as yet) of the Fruit of the Vine, until that day that I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Again, some object, <HI>That if Christ hath such a spiritual Body that shall outwardly appear, it will be so glorious that Men with their outward Eyes cannot behold it; for if men cannot stedfastly behold the Sun with their out∣ward Eyes, because of its Glory, how much less the Body of the Man Christ that shall be incomparably more bright and glorious?</HI></P>
<P>To this <HI>I Answer</HI>; This Objection hath no weight against the Saints seeing Christs Body, who shall have attained their Resurrection Bodies,

that shall be like unto his; for as <HI>Iohn</HI> hath declared, <HI>We know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.2. And therefore though the Eye of the poor weak Mortal Body cannot see him as he is, yet that hinders not but the Eyes of the Resur∣rection Body can so see him.</P>
<P>And as concerning these of the Saints who shall be living in mortal Bodies at Christs Appearance in his glorified Body, he can show himself well enough unto them, in such a manner and after such a form as they are able to bear, though they cannot see him altogether as he is, or as the Saints raised in Immortal Bodies can do, even as when the Disciples, <HI>Peter, Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> saw him at his Translation on <HI>Mount Tabor</HI>; for even before his ascention into Heaven, the Lord Jesus appeared unto the Disciples after a divers form. And for the Wicked, though they cannot see him as the Saints, yet they may be made to see him after a sort, to cause great Terror and Astonishment unto them; so that if they cannot see him as the Saints shall, yet they may see some <HI>Sign</HI> of him, as Christ himself said, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.30. <HI>And then shall appear the Sign of the Son of Man in Heaven, and then shall all the Tribes of the Earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven, with Power and great Glory:</HI> Now whether this be referred to an inward or outward sight of Christ, the difficulty is the same, for certainly Wicked men can neither see Christ nor God inwardly with the Eyes of their Souls, as the Saints do; they can only see him in Wrath, to cause in them great dread and horror; and so they may see Christ, even outwardly.</P>
<P>And as to the nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gross Error, held by some, to my certain know∣ledge, <HI>That there is no general Iudgment Day to come at the end of the World, but every one immediately after Death hath all his Reward or Punish∣ment that he is to expect forever</HI>; Which is so connected with the former Error, sufficiently above refuted, that they fall together, and therefore less needs to be said for its particular Refutation; for it is most clear from the Testimony of holy Scripture (see <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.15.11.22.12.36. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.9.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.7. 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 4.17.)

glorified Body, <HI>Paul</HI>'s words are to be understood, <HI>Acts</HI> 22.6.9.11. &amp; cap. 26.13, 14. and with a respect to this Vision of Christ that <HI>Paul</HI> had without him, he said, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.8. <HI>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time, &amp;c.</HI> And therefore the Right Hand of God at which Christ is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to sit, doth not signifie any visible or corporal thing, but the great Power of God, with which the Man Christ is most excellently indued, and fitted to be Judge of Quick and Dead, and Lord and King over all Creatures, visible and invisible. And when God appeared at any time to any of the Fathers or Prophets, in the form of Man, before Christ came in the Flesh, there is good ground to believe, that it was still in the Man Christ; for although the Body of Christ which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of the Virgin, was not then formed, yet he was then, and all along, the Heavenly Man, from the beginning, in which heavenly and divine Nature, the similitude of God, and in that respect could appear in the Form of Man, even as Angels, who have no Bodies of F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh, have appeared in the Form of Men, and as <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> appeared at Christs Transfiguration in the Form of Men, although they had not attained the Resurrection Body; for even the Souls and Spirits of Men have at times appeared in the Form of Men, after the death of the gross Body. Nor will this seem strange to such who do rightly understand how the inward Man dwelleth in the outward Man of every one of us, and the inward Man hath his pro∣per Form, as well as the outward; for it is the form of the inward Man that giveth Form to the Outward, even as the Seal giveth the Impression to the Wax or Clay that sealeth it. And therefore the Saints now deceased, that are with Christ in <HI>Paradise,</HI> have their proper and peculiar Forms very beautiful, which are as an inward Garment unto them, and doth suffice unto them, until they be cloathed upon with their Resurrection Bodies; therefore it is said, <HI>That to the Souls that remained under the Altar, who were slain for the Word of God, White Robes were given unto every one of them, Rev.</HI> 6.11.

<P><HI>Next,</HI> As concerning the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> some who seem to own it in words, yet deny it in truth, when they say and think, as some do, (to my certain knowledge) <HI>That there is no Resurrection of the Body after Death, either of the Iust or Vnjust, for Christ is the Resurrection, and they who are come to Christ, are come to the Resurrection, and there is no other to be expected.</HI> Which is a great and hurtful Error, and is a plain Denyal of the Resurrection of the Dead, the right Belief of which <HI>Paul</HI> doth so much value, that because some among the <HI>Corinthians</HI> had not the Faith of it, he chargeth them, <HI>That they had not the Knowledge of God,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.34. and he doth so link or joyn together the Faith of the Resurrection of the Dead in general, with the Faith of Christs Resurrection, that to deny the one, is to deny the other; and to deny Christs Resurrection, is to deny both Faith and Preaching, and render them void, and to make the Apostles of the Lord false Witnesses, and the Gospel or Glad-Tidings of the Remission of our sins, through faith in Christ raised from the Dead, a Fiction or Untruth; all which are most absurd. And as in that Chapter the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> useth many ex∣cellent Arguments and Reasons to prove the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> so particularly he doth closely argue, <HI>That to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> is not only to make void all Sufferings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lords sake, but to introduce all manner of <HI>Brutalism</HI> and <HI>Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rism</HI> of Gluttony and Drunkenness, and other carnal Lusts and Pleasures, vers. 32. <HI>What advantageth it not if the Dead rise not? let us eat and drink, for to morrow we dye.</HI> And if any think to avoid this Consequence, by saying, <HI>It is enough to believe the Immortality of the Soul,</HI> or <HI>That the Souls of Men sur∣vive after the Death of the Body, to be rewarded or punished, according to the Deeds done in the Body.</HI> This is to think themselves wiser than <HI>Paul,</HI> or rather than Christ in <HI>Paul,</HI> who did dictate these words in him.

All which being most absurd and false, there∣fore that Doctrine is false which denyeth the Resurrection of the <HI>dead.</HI> And it is wonderful Ignorance in some, who affirm, <HI>That in all this Chapter,</HI> 1 Cor. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Paul doth only understand the inward quickening or raising of the Soul from the Death of Sin, to live unto God and to Righteous∣ness; and by Christs Resurrection, the rising of his Seed or Life in us</HI>; as if <HI>Paul</HI> meant by these words, v. 14. (<HI>And if Christ be not risen,</HI> &amp;c.) <HI>If Christ be not risen in us, then is our Preaching vain</HI>; but they will not grant, that by Christs Resurrection, to be meant, the Resurrection of his Body out of the Sepulchre, where <HI>Ioseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> buried him, and then by the same Method, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must deny that Christ dyed out∣wardly on the outward Cross for our sins, or that he was outwardly buried; and this will lead them to deny any outward Birth of Christ in the Flesh, which is to deny and make void some of the chief Articles and Principles of the Christian Faith, and consequently the whole. But it is most plain to all men of common Understanding, that whereas <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh of Christ, <HI>that he dyed for our sins, and that he was buried,</HI> he doth understand how he dyed outwardly, and was outwardly buried, <HI>vers.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 4. and therefore his rising again the third day, is his outward rising. It is a most lamentable and wretched extream which some run into, that because the Scripture mentioneth <HI>Christ in us,</HI> and our being inwardly raised with Christ, to deny that which is so plainly held forth in Scripture, that Christ is both outwardly raised from the Dead, in the Body, and that his Resurrection from the Dead in that Body, as we are enabled by the Spirit of Christ in us to believe it, is ground of our lively Hope, That he will in due time raise us from the Dead. I have heard it charged on <HI>Familists</HI> and <HI>high Notionists,</HI> That they so turn the whole Scripture into an Allegory, as that <HI>they deny any thing to be true, as outwardly, that is recorded in the Letter of the Scripture</HI>; the which, whether truly or falsly charged on them, I will not meddle here to determine, but to my great astonishment I have found too many professing themselves knowing in the Scriptures, run into very danger∣ous Extreams, in great part laying aside the most blessed and precious Doctrine of Christ, his <HI>outward Coming in the Flesh, his Obedience there∣in, his Death, Resurrection, and Ascention into Heaven, and his Inter∣cession for us in Heaven, &amp; Faith in Christ as such,</HI> viz. as he outwardly▪ dyed and rose again, and is gone into Heaven, making very little or no account of his Death and Sufferings without us, or the Faith of

<P>And whereas some say, <HI>We must witness Christ not only born or formed in us, but crucified in us.</HI> I say, to witness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrist born or formed in us is a blessed and necessary experience, but after he is born or formed in us, which is to say, after his blessed Life is revealed in us, it is no good nor desireable experience to witness him crucified in us, and so to affirm doth more savour of <HI>Ranterism</HI> than <HI>Christian Doctrine</HI> or <HI>Sobriety</HI>; in∣deed in the time of mens Unbelief and Alienation from God, it may be said in a Scripture sence, Christ is crucified in them; but after they have truly believed, and witnessed a measure of true Conversion, by the Power of Christ in them, his Life being raised or revealed in them, they must take great heed, and be very tender that they do not crucifie him again, which will be to their own destruction: The tender preci∣ous Life and Seed of God doth indeed suffer many things in men after it is revealed; for every sin occasioneth a suffering to it, even in the least degree, but we ought not to put it to suffering, but rather be humbled and afflicted before the Lord that we have so merly caused it to suffer in us, by any of our sins of any sort; and though Sathan and his Instruments seek to persecute &amp; crucifie that tender L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe of Christ in us, yet if we be faithful unto God, they shall not be able to do it; for never doth the Life of Christ more prevail and reign in the hearts of the faithful, than when they are outwardly persecuted for Christs sake, who doth account their Sufferings to be his, even as his is ac∣counted theirs.</P>

because they are come to Christ, who said, <HI>He was the Resurrection and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Life.</HI> It seemeth, that in <HI>Paul</HI>'s time, some from a wrong under∣standing of Christs words, <HI>his being the Resurrection, &amp;c.</HI> did seek to wrest and corrupt the Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Dead, such as <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Phisetus,</HI> who said, <HI>The Resurrection was past already, and did overthrow the Faith of some, whose words did eat as a Canker,</HI> as he declared, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.17, 18. the which <HI>Hymeneus</HI> (together with <HI>Alexander) Paul</HI> delivered to Sathan, for his great Error touching the Resurrection, for I find no other particularly mentioned, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.20. compared with 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.17, 18. By which it appeareth from Scrip∣ture, that it is of great moment to be found in the Faith of the <HI>Resur∣rection of the Dead,</HI> and it is a great hurt not to believe it; and there∣fore People should not make so light a matter of that, and other parts of <HI>Christian Doctrine,</HI> as some do, thinking, <HI>if they have the Life it is enough</HI>; but the Life of Christ and his Doctrine go along together; &amp; therefore he who hath not the Doctrine of Christ, and abideth not in the same, <HI>hath not God,</HI> and consequently hath not the Life of Christ, 2 <HI>Iohn</HI> 9. for unsound Doctrine maketh an unsound Mind, and an un∣sound Mind is as a leeking Vessel or a broken Cistern, that when the Water of Life is poured into it, holdeth no Water; and therefore any thing or part of unsound Doctrine causeth some decay or with∣drawing of the Life; and a great Error in Doctrine, that respecteth some of the principal Matters of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> is like a great hole in the Vessel, that maketh it exceeding leeky. But the true sence of Christs words, <HI>That he is the Resurrection,</HI> can be no other than this, that he is the Author of it; so that by his Power the Soul is now quick∣ened and raised from the Death of Sin, to the Life of Righteousness; and afterwards, the hour cometh when the Body shall also be raised; even as Christ is called our <HI>Hope,</HI> because he is the Author and Foun∣dation of it. Now against some who deny the Resurrection of the Body after Death, I have brought (among other places) that noted place, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.21. (<HI>Who shall change our vile</HI> (or <HI>low) Body</HI>) to prove the Resurrection; To which they have answer'd, <HI>That is done already, they witness their vile Body already changed, and made conform to the glorious Body of Christ.</HI> But such contradict the Scripture, &amp; speak reproach∣fully, but ignorantly, against the Lord Jesus Christ; for <HI>Paul</HI> useth these words by way of Prophecy, as a thing not then fullfilled, but to be fullfilled at the Resurrection of the Dead, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.21. <HI>Who shall

change our vile</HI> (or <HI>low) Body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious Body, &amp;c.</HI> He doth not say, that the Body was already changed, and made like to the Body of Christ, but by way of Prophecy relateth it as a thing to come; for the washing and cleansing of the Body from sin is not that change, but it is necessary to prepare unto it; for even after the Bodies of the Saints are washed and cleansed from sin, they remain low, and weak, and mortal, and corruptible, subject to hunger, thirst, cold, diseases and death, and therefore are not made like to his glorious Body, until the Resurrection of the Dead.</P>
<P>Now that the Saints are not immediately raised up after Death (so as to attain to the Resurrection of the Body) or after the Spirit goeth out of the Body (although the Souls and Spirits of all righteous and faithful Men &amp; Women, who dye in the Faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, do immediately go unto God and Christ in Heaven, and enter into a very great and large enjoyment of the heavenly blessedness, after the Bodily decease) is clear from many express Testimonies of holy Scrip∣ture; for the deceased Saints, (tho' their Souls and Spirits are alive with the Lord in Heaven, and do not sleep, but are awake, and pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> God continually, yet they) are said to be asleep, as in respect of their Bodies, which are rather fallen asleep, than dead, and are said to sleep in Christ, to wit, under his divine care and protection, until he awaken them; for which I shall cite these following Scriptures, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 2.10. <HI>So</HI> David <HI>slept with his Fathers, &amp; was buried in the City of</HI> David. <HI>Deut.</HI> 31.16. <HI>Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy Fathers,</HI> said the Lord unto <HI>Moses:</HI> 1 Cor. 15.20. <HI>Now is Christ become the first Fruits of them that sleep,</HI> viz. because he arose from the dead the third day. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.14. <HI>For if we believe that Iesus dyed, and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Iesus, will God bring with him; for this we say unto you by the Word of the Lord, that we</HI> (that is, such of our Brethren who shall be found living in the mortal Body at Christs coming) <HI>which are alive and remain unto the Coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep; for the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God, and the Dead in Christ shall rise first.</HI> All which places, and many more that could be mentioned, plainly show, that though Saints, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with respect to their Souls, are raised up, and ascended, and are with God and Christ in Heaven, yet as to their Bodies they are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leep, and have not attained to the Resur∣rection of the Body; for if they had attained to the Bodily Resurre∣ction,

<HI>Paul</HI> would not have writ of them by way of Prophecy, in the future, or time to come, saying, <HI>The dead in Christ [shall] rise first,</HI> to wit, <HI>at the Voice of the Arch-Angel and Trump of God.</HI> Now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat this Trump or Trumpet is, both <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> declare, and the time about which it is to sound, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.52. <HI>In a Moment, in the Twinck∣ling of an Eye, at the last Trump, and the Dead shal be raised Incorrupt∣ible, and we shall be changed,</HI> compare with <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.15, 18. <HI>And the seventh Angel sounded,</HI> (which seventh is the last Trumpet) &amp; v. 18. <HI>Thy Wrath is come, and the Time of the Dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give Reward unto thy Servants the Prophets, and to thy Saints, and to them that fear thy Name, both great and small.</HI> And be∣cause <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. layeth down Christs Resurrection from the dead as the ground why true Believers, which are his Members, shall attain to the Resurrection of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Body, it manifestly appeareth that they are to attain unto it at the end of the World, or at the last Trumpet, as is above-mentioned (yet it may well be allowed that some did at∣tain to the Resurrection of the Body immediately after Christs Re∣surrection, according to <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.52, 53. <HI>And the Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints, which slept, arose, and came out of the Graves, after his Resurrection, and went into the holy City, and appeared unto many</HI>) and therefore the deceased Saints have not generally attained to the Resurrection of the Dead, as touching the Resurrection of the Body, but do wait for it until the sound of the last Trumpet. Nor did any of the Saints attain to the Resurrection of the Body before Christs Body rose from the Dead, because he is expresly called, <HI>The first be∣gotten from the Dead,</HI> and <HI>the first Fruits that goeth before the Harvest</HI>; and therefore none did attain to the Bodily Resurrection before him, neither <HI>Enoch</HI> nor <HI>Elias,</HI> for though they were taken up, yet it is not said, they had attained to the Resurrection of the Dead; it only im∣plyeth some peculiar Priviledge, that they did not taste of Death, as other men; and the like may be said of <HI>Moses,</HI> whose Body was more pure and excellent than that of other men, and therefore <HI>Michael</HI> the Angel did contend with the Devil about the Body of <HI>Moses,</HI> and would not let him touch it, as being more excellent, therefore it is said, <HI>God buried him in the Valley of</HI> Moab, <HI>over against</HI> Beth-peor, the which words contain a great Mystery in them. Moreover, it is very plain from Scripture, that the deceased Saints, who lived from the begin∣ning of the World, although their Souls and Spirits did ascend unto
<PB N="109" REF="000691_0118_0FA9A0EEF9A1CCA8"/>
God and Christ in Heaven, yet waited for the Resurrection of the Body, and that more abundant Glory that should follow thereupon; for it is said, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.13. <HI>These all dyed in Faith, not having received the Promises, but ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng seen them afar off, and were perswaded of them, and embraced them, &amp;c.</HI> And v. 39, 40. <HI>All these having obtained a good Report through Faith, received not the Promise, God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made Perfect.</HI> Now what this Promise is, is clear from vers. 35. <HI>And others were tortured, not accepting Deliverance, that they might obtain the better Resurrection,</HI> which is the Resurrection of the Just, that is better than the Resur∣rection of the Unjust. Now if some say, the Promise they waited for was Christs coming in the Flesh: I answer; As it was in part, so it was not only that, but all that Felicity &amp; Happiness that should come unto them by the Coming of Christ in the Flesh, and his Death and Resur∣rection, to wit, the perfect Victory over Death, which is not fully obtained until the Mortal put on Immortality, and the Corruptible put on Incorruption, as it is written, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.54. <HI>So when this Cor∣ruptible shall have put on Incorruption, and this Mortal shall have put on Immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in Victory, O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave, where is thy Victory, &amp;c!</HI> And the very first Promise that God gave to Man∣kind after the Fall, did relate to this Victory over Death, <HI>That the Seed of the Woman,</HI> (which is Christ Jesus) <HI>should bruise the Head of the Serpent</HI>; for though the Head of the Serpent was inwardly bruised, as in respect of the inward Redemption, Salvation and Deliverance of the Souls of all the faithful in all Ages of the World, both before and after Christ came in the Flesh, yet until they attain to the Resurrection of the Body, the Head of the Serpent is not in all respects bruised, be∣cause the last Enemy that is to be destroyed is Death, who is not fully destroyed until the Bodies of the Saints be raised from Death; for by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, Death both of Soul and Body came upon him and his Posterity, and by <HI>Christ's</HI> Death and Resurrection, to all who sincerely believe in him, and obey him, that two-fold Death is removed, the Death of the Soul through Faith in him, and that inward quickening, and being raised with him who is the Resurrection and the Life, now in the Mortal state, but the Death of the Body at the Resurrection of the Dead; see this twofold Resurrection, the one of the Soul, the other of the Body, expresly mentioned <HI>Iohn</HI> 4.25, 28.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="000691_0119_0FA9A0EFB8216E38"/>Now those who say, <HI>The faithful immediately after Death receive the Resurrection of the Body, and all that fullness of Glory and Happiness that they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expect forever,</HI> as they overthrow a principal Article of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> touehing the Resurrection of the Dead, so they over∣throw that other great and principal Article of Faith touching that <HI>great Day of Iudgment</HI> (by overthrowing I m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n only contradicting, for Error cannot overthrow Truth) that is to be in the end of the World, called in Scripture, <HI>The Last Day, The Great Day,</HI> and <HI>That Day,</HI> by way of distinction from all other dayes, and which is fre∣quently mentioned in Scripture; for if all men, both good and bad, receive their Resurrection Bodies immediately after Death, and all that they are to expect forever, there is no occasion for a Day of Judg∣ment in the end of the World, for that is prevented by what cometh to pass immediately after Death, according to this absurd Opinion. And as concerning that <HI>great Day of Iudgment to come,</HI> Christ doth plainly declare, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.30, 31, &amp; 36. <HI>But of that Day &amp; Hour know∣eth no man, no not the Angels in Heaven, but my Father only.</HI> And <HI>Mark</HI> 13.32. <HI>But of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man, no, not the Angels which are in Heaven, neither the Son, but the Father</HI>; which is to be understood of Christ, the Son, as Man to whom then it was not known; the which Day and Hour cannot be the time immediately after mens Decease (for when men dye, the day of their Death is commonly known) for though after Death there is a Judgment that followeth to every one, according to <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27. yet that is not the great and last Judgment, nor universal, but particular. And of this last day Christ said, <HI>Iohn</HI> 6.40. <HI>And this is the Will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting Life, and I will raise him up at the last day: Note,</HI> He doth not say, I will raise him up in the Body immediately after Death, but in the last Day, to wit, in the end of the World; and with respect to this <HI>Martha</HI> made a good Confession of her Faith, touching the Resurrection of the dead, saying. <HI>I know that he shall rise again in the Resurrection, at the last day</HI>; the which Christ doth not in the least contradict, but opened a furder Mystery unto her, to wit, <HI>That he was the Resurrection and the Life, he that believeth in me</HI> (said Christ) <HI>though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never dye.</HI> And because he was the Resurrection, to wit, the Author of it, <HI>therefore he could and would raise</HI> Lazarus, <HI>her Brother, from the dead at that time</HI>; which yet
<PB N="111" REF="000691_0120_0FA9A0F0735BACB0"/>
was not the Resurrection in the last day; for he was but raised at that time a mortal man, to dye again. And whereas Christ said, <HI>That he who believeth in him, shall never dye,</HI> containeth a great and most com∣fortable Mystery, to wit, that neither the Souls nor Bodies of true be∣lievers strictly dye; their Souls sleep not, but are awake, and their Bodies, though they sleep, dye not, and their sleep is not the sleep of Death, strictly taken; and therefore Christ proved against the <HI>Sad∣duces</HI> the Resurrection of the dead, from the words of God to <HI>Moses, I am the God of</HI> Abraham, Isaac <HI>and</HI> Jacob, <HI>and God is not the God of the dead, but of the living</HI>; and therefore nothing of these holy men were strictly dead, neither their Souls nor their Bodies; for even their Bodies did but sleep, as when the Body of a Man sleepeth, that is not dead; for the Bodies only of such dye, in the worst sence of the word <HI>Death,</HI> who dye in final Unbelief and Impenitency, <HI>On whom Death feeds, and whose Iniquities are upon their Bones, and whose Bodies are called the Carkases of them that have transgressed against the Lord, whose Worm dyeth not, and their Fire goeth not out; Psal.</HI> 49.14. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 32.27. <HI>Isa.</HI> 66.24. But as concerning the dead Bodies of the Saints and true Be∣lievers in Christ Jesus, it is prophecyed, <HI>Isa</HI> 26.19. <HI>Thy dead, my dead Body shall arise</HI> (so the <HI>Hebrew</HI> hath it) <HI>awake and sing, ye that dwell in the Dust, for thy Dew is as the dew of Herbs, and the Earth shall cast out the Dead.</HI> By which words it is plain, that Christ owneth the dead Bodies of his Saints to be his dead Body, as Members of him, their Head; And to this doth <HI>Paul</HI>'s Testimony most evidently agree, and seemeth to point at it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.13, 14, 15. <HI>Meats for the Belly, and the Belly for Meats, but God shall destroy both it and them; now the Body is not for Fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the Body, and God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own Power; Know ye not that your Bodies are the Members of Christ, &amp;c?</HI> Where note these particulars, 1<HI>st.</HI> That <HI>Paul</HI> distinguisheth betwixt the Belly and the Body, saying, <HI>God will destroy the Belly,</HI> but he doth not say he will destroy the Body; for seeing after the Resurrection of the dead men shall need none of the Meats of this corruptible World, nor shall they need a Belly to put them in, as Guts &amp; Draught, or any gross parts, as men now have. 2<HI>dly.</HI> That he saith, <HI>The Body is for the Lord, and the Lord for the Body</HI>; Now how is that to be understood but thus, That the Body is the Lords, &amp; he hath bought it, together with the Soul, to be his Temple and Habitation; and as while in the

So, the Flesh that is gross, mortal and corruptible, is not that Flesh that shall be raised up immortal and incorruptible; for the word <HI>Flesh</HI> is taken sometimes in Scripture, as well as Body, in a very high sence, where it is said, <HI>Vnless ye eat my Flesh, &amp;c.</HI> and <HI>All Flesh shall set the Salvation of God</HI>; and <HI>I will give them Hearts of Flesh.</HI></P>

asleep, if the Souls of Men are not to receive their Bodies, and put them on again, which they put off when they dyed: If they have no∣thing to put on, there is no Resurrection to be expected; but if they have something that they wait to put on, what is that, but the same Body for substance which they did put off, excepting the drossy and husky part, which is no proper part of Mans Body, &amp; therefore doth not rise with the Body, but is dissolved into Earth &amp; Ashes, and after that springeth up into Grass, and other Vegetables, as other common Earth doth; for if the Body they are to put on at the Resurrection is altogether to be another Body in substance &amp; essence, or first Principle, this would not be a Transmutation of the Body, or Transformation, but a Commutation or Exchange of one thing for another, as when a Man changeth Copper for Gold, and layeth down a great lump of Copper, and taketh up a little piece of Gold; but such Change as is a real Transmutation or Transformation, is, when the Substance or first Principle or Essence remaineth the same, it is changed in Form and Mode, or in Manner and Quality, as when Sand and Ashes is turned into clear Glass, and a heap of Wood by burning is turned, for most part into Air and Sulpher, the Ashes, which are the drossy part, that remaineth, being but a small part of the Wood; or, as suppose such a thing possible, when Lead or Quick-Silver is transmuted into Gold: And that the Change of the Body at the Resurrection is not a Commu∣tation of one thing for another, differing in Substance or Essence, but a Transmutation or Transformation, as aforesaid, is clear from the <HI>Greek,</HI> word, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.21. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that properly signifieth, <HI>shall Transform</HI>; and therefore the Change of the Body at the Resurrection is a Transmutation or Transformation, the drossy part being seperated, even as when the Soul or Mind of Man is renewed, cleansed and sancti∣fied, the Soul remaineth the same in substance or beeing, but is migh∣tily changed in Condition, Manner and Qualities, and a great deal of dross &amp; filth of unclean Spirits is seperated from it; &amp; therefore when the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> cometh to give an account of the Manner of the Resur∣rection Body, he proposeth the Question thus, <HI>How are the dead raised, and</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. <HI>with what Quality of Body do they come?</HI> (not <HI>quo Corpore, sed quals corpore</HI>) and so he proceedeth to answer, <HI>Thou Fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it dye,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.36.

<PB N="115" REF="000691_0124_0FA9A0F38B1514F8" MS="y"/>
soweth in the ground, after that he hath opened it; for every Husband-man that soweth Seed in the ground expecteth that his Seed will rise, otherwise he would not sow it; <HI>for he that soweth, soweth in hope:</HI> Now all that is sown doth not rise, for the husk and skin or drossy part riseth not, but lyeth in the Earth, as may be seen in many Grains, but the Kirnel or true Body of the Seed riseth, after Putre∣faction, the which Putrefaction is to the end that the impure &amp; drossy part may be seperated from the pure and noble part, that so it may rise and encrease. And therefore according to the similitude of a grain of Corn, given us by the Wisdom of God in Scripture, the true Body of Man that shall arise at the Resurrection of the Dead, lyeth hid (in∣visible to our gross and carnal Eyes, within that visible gross appear∣ance of Flesh and Blood, even as the Kirnel of a Grain of Corn lyeth within the Husk, or as the precious Gold lyeth within the course and gross Mineral or Mine, until the pure and precious Mettal be seperat∣ed from the Dross. And because this Seperation betwixt the pure and noble part, and that drossy part in Mans Body, is not immediately effected, therefore some Time is requisite after Death to effect that Seperation in the Grave, the measure of which Time I will not deter∣mine; and when that Seperation is made, the Body remaineth and is lodged by the divine Providence, that giveth to every thing its proper place, as in a certain invisible Grave or Sepulchre, that was mysteriously figured by the burial place, called <HI>Machpelah,</HI> that signifieth a double or twofold Cave or Sepulchre, which <HI>Abraham</HI> purchased from <HI>Ephron</HI> the <HI>Hittite</HI> for four hundred pieces of Silver, <HI>Gen.</HI> 23. the which as it was litterally true, so is an Allegory, as divers Mystick Writers observe, and pointeth at the Mystery of the Resurrection Body out of the my∣stical and invisible <HI>Machpelah</HI> or Sepulchre in <HI>Hebron,</HI> in the Land of <HI>Israel,</HI> figuratively and mystically understood; for <HI>Ephron</HI> signifieth the Dust-eater, and by 400 pieces of Silver, <HI>i. e.</HI> by so many Virtues (sig∣nified by Silver) this most excellent Burial-place is purchased from <HI>Ephron</HI>; but he who hath not these Virtues cannot have the Priviledge to be buried in this most excellent place (which was in <HI>Hebron,</HI> that in <HI>Hebrew</HI> signifieth <HI>bordering</HI> or <HI>joyning,</HI> therefore it is said to be in the end of <HI>Ephron</HI>'s field) and who cannot be buried there for lack of these Virtues, <HI>an Vntimely Birth is better than he,</HI> as the holy Scriptures de∣clareth, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 6.3. for it is no such Misery nor Unhappiness not to have an outward and visible Sepulchre, which many of the dear Chil∣dren

Hence it doth appear, that the Graves that shall be opened at the Resurrection of the dead, are not any visible places on this Glob of the Earth, but certain invisible places to our carnal Eyes, where they are lodged by the All-wise disposing Providence, until the
<PB N="117" REF="000691_0126_0FA9A0F735D44DD0" MS="y"/>
time of the Resurrection. And thus commonly men have two Graves, the first given them by men, until the Seperation be made betwixt the Kirnel and the Drossy part, by Putrefaction (as suppose after a Year, or more or less) the second given them by God, who probably may use the Ministry of Angels therein (see <HI>Iude</HI> 9.) even as it is said, <HI>That</HI> Lazarus, <HI>after he dyed, was carried into</HI> Abrahams <HI>Bosom, viz.</HI> his Soul, and so, why not also his Body into <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Sepulchre, mystically un∣derstood? And these Graves, <HI>Iob</HI> seemeth to understand, where he says, <HI>The Graves are ready for me,</HI> cap. 17.1. But here I desire the Reader diligently to mind, that what is said of the Drossy part be∣longing to mens Bodies, called by <HI>Paul, Corruption,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.50. is no wise to be understood of the Body of Christ, which had no such part in it, but was altogether most pure, and saw no Corruption; &amp; there∣fore when the Sepulchre was looked into, nothing was there to be found, but the Grave Cloathes.</P>
<P>And whereas <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>Thou sowest not that Body that shall be, and God giveth a Body as pleaseth him,</HI> yet it is to be observed, that he saith, <HI>God giveth to every Seed his own Body</HI>; for it is granted, the Body is not the same in Condition and Quality, or manner of Being, but wonder∣fully changed, as to that; yet the same for substance, the drossy part being excluded. And it is not to be denyed, but as the Seed of Corn that riseth, getteth many additional parts to it of a new Body, whereby it is multiplyed into many Grans, so the Resurrection Body hath also that which is added unto it of that excellent Earth, out of which it ariseth, which is not this visible Earth that we tred upon, but far more excellent, the Dust whereof is Gold, and the Stones of it Saphires, <HI>Iob</HI> 28.6. compar'd with <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.21. And as the Body of Man at first was made of such excellent Dust, in <HI>Hebrew</HI> call'd <HI>Apher</HI> or <HI>Opher,</HI> so it shall be made up again of the same.</P>
<P>And <HI>lastly,</HI> As concerning the <HI>Re-uniting</HI> or joyning again together the Souls and Bodies of the faithful at the Resurrection, that place in <HI>Acts</HI> 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. seemeth to point unto, where it is said, <HI>When the Times</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. <HI>of Re-animating, or Re-animation shall come, viz.</HI> that the Soul shall again animate the Body; for as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, signifieth the Soul its leaving the Body, <HI>Acts</HI> 5.5. by the same reason <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, signi∣fieth, the Soul its returning to animate the Body at the Resurrection of the dead; therefore the Time of <HI>Re-animation</HI> is said to come from the face or Person of the Lord; the <HI>Greek</HI> word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, there used, signifieth either <HI>Face</HI> or <HI>Person.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="000691_0127_0FA9A0F7F34D7410" MS="y"/>But against the Doctrine of the Resurrection, as here delivered and opened by plain evidence of holy Scripture, and in Scripture words &amp; terms, to which it is only safe in this, and in all other things, to keep close, some will be ready to Object, First, <HI>That the Body is a thing alto∣gether void of Life and Sence, and doth not live at all, but only the Soul it is that liveth in the Body, and therefore the Body is no part of the Man, nor doth it deserve any Reward or Punishment, because it is a meer dead thing, and without all sence, or perception, even when the Soul is in it.</HI></P>
<P>To this <HI>I Answer</HI>; That the Body is a dead thing, and without sence, when the Soul is in it, is a false Assertion, and contrary both to Scrip∣ture and our own Experience; for said Christ, <HI>Fear not him or them that can kill the Body, &amp;c.</HI> and if the Body can be killed, it had Life before it was killed. And though that Doctrine, <HI>That the Body is without all sence, or perception, or life, even when the Soul is in it,</HI> be taken up by some called Philosophers, yet it is extreamly irrational, and contradict∣ed by others of more sollid Judgment in the Knowledge of Natural Things. But on the contrary, seeing the Body hath its proper Life &amp; Perception, after its kind as the Soul hath, and is, as it were married to the Soul, while the Soul liveth in it it is most suitable t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the divine Goodness and Justice to Reward the Body, together with the Soul, and joyn them together in a happy Bond of Union, that shall never any more be loosed; and that a Man's Body is related to his Soul, as the Wife to the Husband, is plain from <HI>Paul</HI>'s Doctrine, who said, <HI>Let a man so love his Wife, as his own Flesh.</HI> And though at the Resurrection there shall be no Marrying nor giving in Marriage, nor carnal begetting of Chil∣dren, yet a more excellent Union shall be witnessed, than that of Mar∣riage, by those at the Resurrection, who shall be found worthy of it, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.31, 32. compared with <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.24.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Some will object, <HI>That according to the Iudgment of those called</HI> Philosophers <HI>and Enquirers into Natural Mysteries, the Body of Man when he liveth, is oft changed and renewed in all its parts, and that within a Year, (as some think) and less, as others think; and if so, every man that hath lived to Mans age, hath had many Bodies; and which of these shall be his Resurrection Body?</HI></P>
<P>But to this it is easily <HI>Answered,</HI> That allowing there is a great Change or renewing of the gross material and visible parts of Man's Body, yet the Radical Body, or Radix and principal Substance of the Body remaineth the same, and is of a durable and lasting Nature; and
<PB N="119" REF="000691_0128_0FA9A0F8AF90F4C8" MS="y"/>
though it may be encreased in Man while he liveth, yet it is not dimi∣nished, nor the parts of it seperated asunder. And though Man-eaters may eat the gross part of Mans Body, yet that more subtil and invisible part they cannot; nor can that which belongeth to one be given to another; hence by way of Allegory and Metaphor, it is called <HI>Bone</HI> in Scripture, <HI>Isa.</HI> 66.14.</P>
<P N="3">3d Object. <HI>That there seemeth not any thing in the Body of Man that is such a Noble Essence, and is capable of so great a Change, as the Glory of the Resurrection Body doth amount unto; for what else is the Body of Man beside the four Elements of</HI> Fire, Air, Water <HI>and</HI> Earth, <HI>or as the Chymists say,</HI> Sulphur, Mercury <HI>and</HI> Salt, <HI>which is also in the Bodies of all Vegetables, and Annimals, yea, and Minerals and Mettals also</HI>?</P>
<P>To this <HI>I Answ.</HI> That not only the Body of Man, but also in all the Inferiour Creatures, there is a noble Essence that is corporeal or Bodily, far more excellent than that which is sensible or perceptible to our gross Senses; but there is this difference betwixt that noble part in the Bodies of Men, <HI>viz.</HI> good Men, and that which is in all the Bodies of Inferior Creatures, as <HI>Vegetables, Annimals, Mettals,</HI> that it lieth in these inferior Bodies still mingled or mixed with the more gross parts, in more or less; and therefore nothing in the Body either of <HI>Annimal, Vegetable</HI> or <HI>Mettal,</HI> attaineth to its Resurrection, or Clarification &amp; Perfection, but in <HI>Man,</HI> and that only in a <HI>good Man</HI>; and therefore the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ferieur Creatures, by a sort of innate appetite and desire, incline to be joyned unto Man, as their Head, and to be his food, that so they may attain to their Perfection and Restoration in him, which they cannot attain unto otherwise. And as there is a Noble Essence in the Bodies of good Men, that lyeth hid within the shell of the gross Body, so no doubt there is another Ignoble Essence in the Bodies of <HI>Wicked Men,</HI> that also lyeth hid within the shell of the gross Body, that is exceeding dark and filthy, and of a hellish Quality, that shall be their Resurrection Body unto Damnation. Moreover, <HI>Paul</HI> treating of the manner of the Re∣surrection, saith, <HI>That is not first which is spiritual, but that which is An∣nimal</HI> (see the <HI>Greek</HI>) As it seemeth to have a relation to mans first Condition before the Fall, so to his Condition at the Resurrection of the Dead, when that which is <HI>Annimal</HI> shall be made <HI>Spiritual</HI>; and when we have born the Image of the Earthly, <HI>to wit,</HI> of <HI>Adam,</HI> as he was be∣fore the Fall, afterwards we shall bear the Image of the heavenly, to wit, of Christ, the second <HI>Adam,</HI> that never fell.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="000691_0129_0FA9A0F971151040" MS="y"/>If any think these Answers too Philosophical, and reaching too far into the Wisdom or Knowledge of Natural Things, let them consider▪ that the Objections raised (which are common in the Mouthes of Un∣learned Men) gave the rise to them; and indeed none are more ready to set up themselves to be Judges in the greatest Mysteries of Natural Things, than such who are most ignorant in them; and while they openly cry out against the Knowledge of Natural Mysteries, yet they will presume to determine concerning them.</P>
<P>And to conclude this weighty Matter, Although there is no great Knowledge in Natural Things required in men to be good <HI>Christians,</HI> and that men may be good Ministers of Christ, who have not much Knowledge in the Mysteries of Nature, and especially who have but little that cometh to them by humane or natural Learning; yet seeing Natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it self, and all Natural Things are of God (for all is of God that can be named, sin only excepted and have him to be their Author, <HI>and that the invisible things of God, even his eternal Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness, and Iustice, &amp;c. are clearly to be seen in the things that are Na∣tural</HI>; it is a worthy and commendable thing in all <HI>Christians,</HI> and especially in these who are Teachers of others, to have some good de∣gree in the Knowledge of things both Spiritual and Natural; for as there is a great Analogy and Harmony, yea, and Unity betwixt them, after some sort, so the Knowledge of the one hath a great Analogy and Harmony, yea, and Unity with the Knowledge of the other, and a great degree of spiritual Knowledge doth greatly conduce to the ob∣taining a good degree of the Knowledge of Natural Things; and the Knowledge of Natural Things, duely and soberly improved, and being sanctified, is subservient to the Knowledge of Spiritual Things, as the Hand-maid to the Mistress. And there is a divine and spiritual Know∣ledge of Nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral Things and Mysteries, that Men have been taught by the Spirit of God, who is the Author of Nature, and God of Nature as of Grace, as is evident from <HI>Moses, Iob, David, Solomon,</HI> and the Prophets and Apostles; for though divers of the Prophets, and most of the Apostles had little of that called humane Learning or Education, yet that divine Spirit that was plentifully given unto them, did not only impart unto them great Knowledge of spiritual Mysteries, but even of Natural also, as is manif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st to all such who do impartially read, and well consider the holy Scriptures, and have that Gift of Discretion and Understanding given them of God to see what excellent Things of

Truth, even in Naturals, as well as in Spirituals, are there wrapt up, tho' the main design of the holy Scriptures is to teach men the things that concern their spiritual State &amp; Happiness in the World to come; what it treats of Natural things being occasional, and in subordination unto the other.</P>
<P>And here <HI>Note,</HI> That whereas it is commonly supposed, that the inward quickning and raising mens Souls from the Death of Sin to the Life of Righteousness, is that <HI>first Resurrection,</HI> mentioned <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.4, 5. but let the place cited be well considered, and it will be found, that not the quickening of the Soul or inward Man unto God, but the living again of the Saints at the Resurrection of the Dead, in their Resur∣rection Bodies, is <HI>that first Resurrection.</HI> And that it is said, <HI>Blessed and Holy is he that hath part in the first Resurrection</HI>; this is most true, for every one of the faithful hath already, even at present, a part or right in that <HI>first Resurrection,</HI> but they get not the actual Possessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of it un∣til the Resurrection of the Dead, even as many Men have a Right in an Estate of Land, who yet have not the actual Possession of it. And it is called the <HI>first Resurrection,</HI> because the Resurrection of the Just shall be first in Order before the Resurrection of the U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>just, the one pre∣ceeding the other a Thousand Years, as <HI>Iohn</HI> hath plainly declared, <HI>They lived and reigned with Christ a Thousand Years, but the rest of the Dead lived not again until the Thousand Years were finished, this is that first Resurrection,</HI> (so the <HI>Greek) Rev.</HI> 20.4, 5. Therefore if any will say, <HI>The rising or renewing of the Soul by Conversion, is [a] first Resurrection,</HI> I will not contend, but it is not <HI>That first Resurrection,</HI> mention'd <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. where only, and no where else in all the Scripture that manner of Speech or Phrase is to be found. And that the Resurrection of the Just doth preceed or go before the Resurrection of the Unjust, is clear from divers other places of Scripture in the New Testament, as 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.16. <HI>The dead in Christ shall rise first</HI>; See, here is the first Resurrection. And 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.22. <HI>So in Christ all shall be made alive, but every man in his own Order, Christ the first Fruits, afterwards they that are Christs at his Coming; then cometh the End, viz.</HI> after the Thousand Years are ex∣pired, when the Wicked shall be raised up to Judgment, and when he shall deliver up the Kingdom, <HI>viz.</HI> not only his present inward and spiritual Kingdom in the Saints, but also his Kingdom of the Thou∣sand Years over all that dwell upon the Earth, in order to reign Eter∣nally with the Father in the Heavens, where all the Saints shall be with

him forever; for though his Kingdom here upon Earth be a Thousand Years, wherein Sathan shall be bound, and there shall be none to hurt nor destroy all that time, yet it shall be forever in Heaven; <HI>for he shall reign forever and ever, and of the Increase of his Government there shall be No End,</HI> as the holy Scriptures declare.</P>
<P>And as to the last of these four particulars above-mentioned, <HI>viz. That t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey who are perfectly sanctified already, are fully come to the New Heavens and the New Earth, &amp;c.</HI> Which is a very gross Mistake, and Contradictory to the holy Scriptures; for however that the great in∣ward Change and Work of Conversion, may by way of Analogy be be called, the <HI>New Heavens and the New Earth</HI>; yet it is most evident from Scripture, that the Apostles, after they witnessed that inward Change and Work of Conversion, as much as any ever could or can pretend unto, or rather more, yet declared their Faith and Expecta∣tion of <HI>That New Heavens and New Earth,</HI> as a thing not then come, but to come, as <HI>Peter</HI> said, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Nevertheless, we, according to his Promise, look for New Heavens and a New Earth, wherein awelieth Righteo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sness.

<P>And whereas it is the Opinion of some, <HI>That the New Heavens and the New Earth, that are promised to the Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who shall attain to the Re∣rection of the Dead, are no other than the visib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Heavens that we see with our gross carnal Eyes, and the visible gross Earth that we walk upon; and that this visible Fabrick of the visible Heavens and Earth, by Conflagration or being set on fire, shall be melted or changed into a Transparent and Chri∣staline Form or Appearance.</HI> Or, as others suppose, <HI>The visible Heavens and Earth shall only be changed into better Qualities, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Heavens shall give more kindly and favourable Influences to nourish and preserve the Life of

<P>But whether that Universal con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lagration sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l change the whole Fabrick of this visible Heaven and Earth into a Transparent or Chri∣sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>line Form, or Solar Substance, so as to be like another Sun for Light and Brightness, as some think, I see no ground of Probability for it, from the Scriptures; let it therefore su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fice us to believe, that as no∣thing of the Substance of Heaven or Earth, that God hath created, shall ever be annihilated or turned into Nothing, (but only shall be changed, and by that change be meliorated; <HI>for the whole Creation groaneth and is in pain to be delivered from the Vanity it was subje<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted unto,</HI> and will be delivered, as the Scripture declareth) so the manner of that change shall be such, as the divine Goodness and Wisdom shall see most convenient for his own Glory, and the good of his Creatures.</P>

<P>But 2<HI>dly,</HI> That <HI>New Heavens</HI> and <HI>New Earth</HI> that is to come shall remain, and never cease, nor come to wax Old, as is clear from <HI>Isa.</HI> 66.22. but this visible Earth and Heavens shall not always remain, ac∣cording to their present Condition; for it is prophecyed concerning them, <HI>That the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avens, even the Heavens shall wax Old as a Garment▪ and as a Vesture thou shalt fold them up</HI>; and therefore the visible Hea∣vens and the visible Earth that waxeth Old, and shall be changed as a a Garment, cannot be that New Heavens and New Earth that ever shall remain New, and never wax Old; for since it is altogether with∣out and above the Sphere of Genereation and Corruption, that is the cause of decay &amp; corruption of things, therefore it doth always remain new and fresh; and into this New Heavens &amp; New Earth nothing that is unclean or defiled can ever enter in any wise. But in the time of the Thousand Years there shall be many that shall live on this visible Earth, that shall not be Saints, but Sinners, and have defilements of Sin, and of them shall proceed that great Multitude, which at the end of the Thousand Years shall make up the great Army of <HI>Gog</HI> &amp; <HI>Magog,</HI> whom Sathan shall deceive, after he is again let loose. And that after the Coming of the New Heavens &amp; the New Earth, there shall yet be found Sinners remaining, though not in that New Heavens and New Earth, yet here upon this visible Globe of the Earth whereon we walk, is clear from <HI>Isa.</HI> 65.20. <HI>There shall be no more thence an Infant of Dayes, nor an Old Man that hath not filled his dayes; for the Child shall dye an hundred Years Old, but the Sinner being an hundred Years old shall be accursed:</HI> And that this accursing of the Sinner is after the coming of the New Hea∣vens and the New Earth, is clear from <HI>vers.</HI> 17. <HI>For behold, I create New Heavens and a New Earth,</HI> &amp;c. And whereas it is said, by way of Prophecy, v. 20. <HI>There shall be no more thence an Infant of Dayes, nor an

Old Man that hath not filled his dayes; for the Child shall dye an hundred Years Old</HI>; It is plain and manifest enough from this Prophecy, That after the coming or Revelation of the New Heavens and New Earth, there shall be a great Change known upon this visible Globe of the Earth whereon we live; for even upon the same, the Age of Men shall be exceedingly prolonged beyond what it is now, even as it was in that time before the Flood, when Men commonly lived divers hundreds of Years, some above Nine Hundred Years, some above Eight Hundred, and some above Seven Hundred, and <HI>Methuselah</HI> lived Nine Hundred Sixty and Nine Years, wanting only thirty one Years to compleat a Thousand, but that none lived a thousand, containeth a Mystery in it; and yet it cannot be shewed that all Mankind generally lived to so great an Age, for it is probable that some even then dyed an hundred Years old, but when they dyed at the Age of one hundred Years, they were reckoned but as Children, so that the Age of an hundred Years then was but equivolent to the Age of fourteen or fifteen years now; and therefore it is very probable, that in the Time of the Thousand Years the Age of all living in Mortal Bodies, both Saints and Sinners shall be greatly prolonged; and if any happen to dye an hundred years Old, they shall be reputed as Children; but if any remain Wicked, even to a great Age, as many, no doubt, will do, whether to a hundred or divers hundreds, they shall be accursed.</P>

<P>But some may be ready to say, <HI>To what purpose shall Christ with his glo∣rious Body, &amp; the Saints with their Resurrection Bodies, appear to men living in Mortal Bodies here upon thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> visible Earth, in the time of the Thousand Years, seeing they shall need nothing of what is here below? shall not such an Appearance rather diminish than add to the Glory of the State they are in?</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>I Answer</HI>; God hath appointed it in his divine Wisdom so to be, for a great and glorious End and Purpose, and therefore the Wisdom of Men ought to be silent, lest it contradict the Wisdom of God; and the End and Purpose of God is manifest therein, <HI>viz.</HI> Be∣cause Christ and his Saints have been great Sufferers upon Earth, and therefore God hath thought it meet to Crown them with Dominion &amp; Glory over all Mankind upon Earth▪ even that very Earth on which they have suffered so many things, that so publickly and openly in the face and sight of all Mankind it may be known, that God hath Exalted his Son, and next to him, the Saints with him, who are his Members, over all Principalities and Powers on Earth, <HI>that to the Name of Iesus every Knee may bow, and Tongue confess, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or beneath the Earth</HI>; for all must be put under him.

have suffered the unjust Judgment of Ungodly and Unjust Men, should be exalted to judge them, most justly, as it is fore-told in divers places of the holy Scripture, and which <HI>Enoch,</HI> the seventh from <HI>Adam</HI> did prophecy of, <HI>Iude</HI> 14. saying, <HI>Behold, the Lord cometh with</HI> (or <HI>in) ten Thousand of his Saints</HI> (for he shall be both in them by his Spirit, and with them by his Bodily Presence) <HI>to execute Iudgment upon all, and to convince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll that are Vngodly, &amp;c.</HI> And though some apply this to our present Time, yet they are in a great Mistake; for its most clear that <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de</HI> citeth this Prophecy of <HI>Enoch,</HI> with respect to the Judgment of the great Day, mentioned by him, <HI>vers.</HI> 6. which is yet to come, both to wicked Angels and Men.

<P>And whereas the Scripture speaketh of Thrones that shall be given to the Saints to sit upon, it is not to be understood, that these Thrones shall be material Thrones, of material Wood, Silver or Gold, but even
<PB N="129" REF="000691_0138_0FA9A100F9B97B28" MS="y"/>
as Christs Throne is his divine Power, so the same divine Power of Christ, variously putting forth, and demonstrating it self in manifold Operations and Workings, shall be these Thrones, and also Angels are called Thrones, in Scripture, who may be said to carry the Saints, as it is said, <HI>Luke</HI> 16.22. <HI>That</HI> Lazarus <HI>was carried by the Angels into</HI> Abra∣ham<HI>'s Bosom</HI>; for it is no diminishing of the Dignity of the Angels so to do, more than for a Man to carry a Child in his Arms; for even the Lord is said to <HI>carry and bear his People, as an Eagle doth bear her Young Ones.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas it is queried or objected, <HI>Shall not such an Appearance of the Saints, together with Christ in their Resurrection Bodies, so as to have the Administration of the World, and of all Nations of Men living in it in mortal Bodies, rather diminish from, than add to the Glory of the state they are in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answ.</HI> By no means; even as it doth nothing diminish from the Glory of God, but doth the more demonstrate his Glory, that he is the great King and Ruler of the whole World, <HI>whose Kingdom ruleth over</HI> (Heb. <HI>in) all, Psal.</HI> 103.19. for the Saints appearing with Christ, their Head, in their Resurrection Bodies, that shall be more glorious than the Sun, shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot have any thing diminished from their heavenly Happiness and Glory, but encreased; for they shall always live in that New Heavens and New Earth, where with the Eyes of their Souls and Minds they shall see God and Christ, their chiefest Happiness, and with the Eyes of their Resurrection Bodies they shall see the glorious Body of Christ that was raised from the Dead, and is gone into Heaven, which shall be a great joy unto them, as it was unto the Disciples to see him after he rose from the dead, but then their joy shall be greater; for at that time they saw him but with the mortal Eyes of their mortal Bodies, and that but for a little time, but then they shall see him with the immortal Eyes of their immortal Bodies, being made like unto him, and that so as to be with him forever. And therefore whereas it is said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.2. <HI>That</HI> John <HI>saw the</HI> New-Jerusalem <HI>coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband</HI>; The which <HI>New-Ierusalem,</HI> are all the Saints of God appearing in their Resurrecti∣on Bodies, to mortal Men living on this Glob of the Earth, both Saints and Sinners; but this Descent of the Saints is not to be understood such, as if by the same they should leave Heaven; for they will still be both in Heaven, and appear to men on Earth at once, even as Christ, when he came down from Heaven, to take flesh in the Virgins Womb, yet
<PB N="130" REF="000691_0139_0FA9A101ADAFB590" MS="y"/>
still was in Heaven, as he plainly testified; and the Saints living in Mortal Bodies, are (as to their Souls or inward Man) still in Heaven, as <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>Our Conversation is in Heaven and he hath set us down in heavenly places in Christ Iesus</HI>; how much more then shall the Saints raised up in Immortal Bodies, still enjoy the fullness of heavenly Glory and Felicity. And as the appearing of Christ and his Saints to Men on Earth, after the manner aforesaid, shall cause a great awe, fear and reverence on all Sinners and unconverted People, who shall remain on the Earth, so that all of them shall be subject, though not for love, yet for fear; so the same will cause exceeding great Joy and Gladness, as well as holy Awe, Fear and Reverence to all the Saints and Faithful that shall then be living in mortal Bodies, who have not attained that Change, so as to have put on Immortality; for though all the Saints living in mortal Bodies shall be changed, yet not all at once, but when they are fully fitted and prepared for the same, and when God shall count them worthy of it; for during the Time of the Thousand Years there is ground to believe, that many of all the Nations of the whole World, that shall be living in mortal Bodies, shall be daily converted and brought into the Faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that partly by the Ministry of the Saints living in mortal Bodies, and partly by the Ministry of the raised Saints, that are raised up in immortal Bodies; for it is written in Scripture, with a respect to that very Time of the Thousand Years, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.24. <HI>And the Nations of them which are saved,</HI> (or, <HI>to be saved, shall walk in the Light of it, and the Kings of the Earth do</HI> (or <HI>shall) bring their Glory and Honour unto it; and the Gates of it shall not at all be shut by day</HI>; compare with this <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.2. <HI>And the Leaves of the Tree were for the healing of the Nations</HI>; and <HI>Isa.</HI> 60.3, 5, 11, 20. <HI>cap.</HI> 66.23, 24. <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch.</HI> 14.8, 9. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 47.7, 8, 9, 10.

And seeing there shall be great Multitudes of unconverted People that shall live in the World within the Thousand Years, it agreeth with great Reason, as well as Scripture, that they shall have an opportunity to be converted, and by Regeneration to be made Members of the holy City; for Christ hath dyed for all Men that ever have lived, or shall live in the World,

in the Earth, and will carry on untill he perfect it, hath had its several steps and degrees, and yet is to have, until it be perfected; so that it is not to be denyed, but that some things very considerable have been done by the Lord, in and through Instruments of his raising up, for some hundreds of Years backwards, especially since the Time of <HI>Iohn Wickcliff</HI>; &amp; they who have any favour of Life, cannot but favour the precious Life that did spring and appear in the Marytrs, both in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and else-where, above one hundred years ago. 4<HI>ly.</HI> That there are many at this present day, who are come to a very blessed state and condition in the Knowledge of the Truth, as it is in Jesus, and in Faith, Holiness and Purity of Worship in Spirit and in Truth, whose state and condition in the Truth may be judged equal to many Believers in the very days of the Apostles; and that divers may have, yea, and have a Ministry or Ministerial Gift given them of God, equal in purity of Doctrine, and as powerful and lively, and blessed with as great success to the Conversion of Souls, as some had in the days of the Apostles; but to equal any Men now alive, or who have lived since the days of the Apostles, to the Apostles of the Lord (I mean the twelve, and <HI>Paul</HI> the thirteenth, all which were peculiarly and extraordinarily fitted of the Lord to an extraordinary Work) proceedeth not from true Knowledge, but great weakness, and shortness of Understanding; for God hath set in the Church (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28.) 1st. <HI>Apostles,</HI> 2dly, <HI>Prophets,</HI> 3dly, <HI>Evangelists, and Pastors, and Teachers</HI>; and tho' all were endued and inspired with the Spirit of God, and spiritual Gifts thereof, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the difference is very great, in respect of measure, and other weighty Considerations; for the Prophets and Apostles of the Lord are the principal Members of the Universal Church, which is the Body of Christ; and therefore all others that come after, are far it f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r our in Dignity unto them; and because of that excellent Dignity of the A∣postles, it was that Christ said, <HI>They should sit upon twelve Thrones,</HI> &amp;c. and the Wall of that great City, the holy <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> is said to have <HI>Twelve Foundations, and in them the Names of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, Rev.</HI> 21.14. and accordingly the Church is said to be <HI>built on the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Iesus Christ himself being the chief Corner Stone, who is both their Foundation &amp; ours.</HI> But it is yet greater pre∣sumption of Ignorance in any, to imagine any men living since the days of the Apostles, to have exceeded them, who are in the first Rank and Order of the Lords Worthies. It is true, the Name <HI>Apostle,</HI> in the
<PB N="135" REF="000691_0144_0FA9A1062EB59C70"/>
large signification of it, may be applicable to any sent of God; but it is as true, that most commonly it is, according to Scripture phrase, re∣stricted to these twelve, and <HI>Paul</HI> the thirteenth, the which very Number doth contain a Mystery in it, answering to the twelve Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> beside the Tribe of <HI>Levi.</HI> But there are some, who though they will not be so bold to equal themselves to the twelve Apostles, or to <HI>Paul</HI> the thirteenth, yet they reckon they are warranted by Christs words, to judge, <HI>they are greater than any of the Prophets; for of all the Prophets, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here were none greater than</HI> John, <HI>and yet the least in the Kingdom is greater than he,</HI> as Christ taught, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.11. <HI>Luke</HI> 7.28. But surely whatever be the sence of Christs words, that cannot be it, as if the least true Believer in Christ, after Christs Death, Resurrection and Ascention, were greater, as to their inward state before God, than <HI>Iohn</HI> was (who was filled with the holy Ghost even from his Mothers Womb, <HI>Luke</HI> 1.15.) or any of the Prophets, as to their inward state, as if <HI>Moses, Samuell, David,</HI> and all the Prophets had not been as true and real Believers in Christ, as any since, or were not so holy, so good and virtuous as these who believe in Christ since. But well were it for many that they were as good as <HI>Iohn</HI> and many others were, who had Faith in Christ as well as any now, by which Faith these Elders obtain'd a good Report, and dyed in Faith, and by Faith their he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts were purified; and through the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ they were saved, and were in a state of Salvation, as well as we; and the Prophets had the Spirit of Christ in them, and the holy Ghost, as well as any since; and seeing they prophecyed of Christ, as he was to come in the Flesh, and fore-told the time and manner of his Coming and Sufferings, Death, Resurrection, Ascention &amp; Glory that should follow, they did certainly believe in him; for said <HI>David, I believe, therefore I have spoken</HI>; and said <HI>Paul, We having received the same Spirit of Faith, we believe, therefore we speak</HI>; and the Faith is one, of the Prophets and Apostles, and of all true Believers in Christ, &amp; they are all built upon that one Foundation, Christ Jesus the Rock of Ages, and Foundation of Generations; and since it is the heavenly and divine Oyl or Unction that maketh Men <HI>Christians,</HI> surely the Prophets had the same; for said <HI>David, Thou anointest my Head with Oyl, my Cup runneth ever, Psal.</HI> 23.5. yea, what inward and spiritual Experiences have any Believers in Christ now, but the Prophets had the same, and greater? <HI>Aaron</HI> is called, <HI>The Saint of the Lord,</HI> in Scripture; <HI>Moses</HI> is greatly commended, not only for his

<HI>Meekness,</HI> but for his <HI>Faith,</HI> and other great Virtues, of whom it is written, <HI>That he esteemed the Reproach of Christ greater Riches than all the Treasures of Egypt</HI>; And if all or many of them had some Weaknesses, they overcame them at last, and they had Victory through Faith, as Believers now have. And seeing the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> describeth the King∣dom of God to be <HI>Righteousness, Peace and Ioy in the holy Ghost,</HI> Rom. 14.17. who can say with Understanding, that <HI>Moses, Samuell, David,</HI> and the Prophets, and <HI>Iohn</HI> that came after, were not in that Kingdom as well as any now; for they had the same Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the holy Ghost, as any now have; and therefore, if by the <HI>King∣dom,</HI> we understand Christs Kingdom of Grace in the hearts of true be∣lievers, surely <HI>Iohn</HI> and all the holy Prophets, and other holy Men and Women were in it, as well before Christ came in the Flesh, as since; &amp; what Christ said concerning <HI>Iohn, That the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast in the Kingdom was greater than he,</HI> if we understand the Kingdom of Grace in the hearts of true Believers, as we well may, it is to be understood of <HI>Iohn,</HI> not with respect to his inward state before God, but with respect to his Water Baptism, and manner of Minist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, which was figurative and typical in great part; for <HI>Iohn's</HI> going before Christ in the outward, was a type and figure of an inward Ministration of the Law &amp; Prophets, or Prophecies going before the more clear Ministration of the Gospel inwardly▪ and the Prophets generally who prophecyed of Christ, and of the Gospel state under Christ, delivered their Prophecies under many Figures and Symboles, and Symbolical Expressions, which were hard to be under∣stood; but after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrists Coming and Suffering in the Flesh, his Death, Resurrection and Ascention, he gave the holy Spirit more plentifully in general to all Believers, that made Gospel Truths more plain and clear to mens Unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>standing; and therefore all Ministers of the Gospel since Christ came, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who are indeed fitted by the Spirit of Christ to be hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ministers, use greater plainness of Speech than the Prophets or <HI>Iohn</HI> used; for God had so appointed it, that the Prophets should not give forth their Prophecies in such clearness as was to come after: But all this doth not in the least infer, that the Prophets were not true Be∣lievers in Christ▪ as well as any now, and had not by true Faith an entrance into Gods Kingdom, as well as any now; for it is absurd to suppose with the <HI>Papists, That when they dyed, they went into a certain Limbu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Prison, where they were detained, and had not entrance into Gods Kingdom untill Christ rose from the dead</HI>; and it is as absurd for any to

imagine, <HI>That Believers generally since Christ came in the Flesh, after Death have a greater or higher place, or are greater in the Kingdom of Glory that is to come, than the Prophets have</HI>; for it is most clear from Scripture, that <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Iacob,</HI> and all the Prophets are in the King∣dom of God, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.28, 29. And none can enter into the Kingdom of God hereafter, who have not known some beginning of entrance into it here in this World.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> That there are already many whom God hath prepared and is preparing to be a first Fruits of the Church, as she cometh out of the Wilderness; and that the full Time of her Wilderness state is very near expiring, and many have their Eyes greatly opened to see a great Glory, and their hearts are greatly affected with it; and many are come to an excellent state and growth in the Truth, and may be truly said to be Children of the New Covenant, and to be under the New Covenant Dispensation; and they look not for another Dispensation in substance, than what they have attained unto, only for a further Increase in degree, while in the mortal state the best and most advanced have cause to wait for. But that any visible Society of People, assem∣bling together in visible Gatherings, are come either to that full and perfect Restoration, as was in the best Times of the Church in the Apostles days, or hath attained, as yet, to all that Glory &amp; Perfection in spiritual Gifts of Knowledge, Virtue, Holiness and Purity of Do∣ctrine, Worship and Discipline, that God hath promised to give unto the Church, after her Return out of the Wilderness state; And that all the Peomises of God concerning the Church, her Glory, Perfection and Restoration are fullfilled, doth not yet appear to me, nor many more, tho' we have great cause to bless God for what he hath already done, and for these good things that we have been made to see, taste and handle of the Word of Life. But if any think, that there is any Society of People at this day to be found in outward and visible As∣semblies and Meetings, such as was in the Apostles days, and such as God has promised yet shall be, after the Church her return out of her Wilderness state, that hath already all that Perfection of Purity in Doctrine, Faith, Knowledge, Holiness, Worship, and all that degree of Qualifications, either of Church Members or Ministers, as the Pro∣mises of God recorded in Scripture hold forth, they ought duely and weightily to consider the Nature and Extent of these Promises, and whether any present Society or Constitution of a Church doth amount unto the same As, <HI>first,</HI> it is promised concerning the Church
<PB N="138" REF="000691_0147_0FA9A1086E48E850"/>
in the latter Days, <HI>That her People shall be all Righteous, being the Branch of his planting▪ and the Work of his Hands, that he</HI> (to wit, God) <HI>may be glorified, Isa.</HI> 60.21. And <HI>Zech.</HI> 14.20. it is promised, <HI>In that Day there shall be upon the Bells of the Horses, Holiness unto the Lord; and the Pots in the Lords House shall be like the Bowls before the Altar; yea, every Pot in</HI> Jerusalem <HI>and in</HI> Judea, <HI>shall be Holiness unto the Lord of Hosts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And in that Day there shall be no more the</HI> Canaanite <HI>in the House of the Lord of Hosts.</HI> Now that this is a Gospel Promise, to be fulfilled to the Church in Gospel Days, is generally acknowledged, though the words be figuratively spoken, and Gospel Mysteries expressed by Figures and Types of the Law. But what visible Society of People is there to be found this day upon Earth, of which all and every one that professeth to the Members of that Society, hath these Qualifications? What Society is there of People, which hath all her Members Righteous and Holy, so that there is no Hypocrite among them, and none of a wrong Spirit, signified by the <HI>Canaanite?</HI> But if any say, these Qualifications are not to be understood of any outward and visible Gathering and Society of People, but of the Members of the Universal Church, that is invisible, all which are Holy. <HI>I Answer,</HI> That according to this they have been all Holy in all Ages of the World; for all true Believers and Members of Christ, in all Ages have been Holy; but certainly these and the like Promises relate to a People that shall openly and visibly appear in the sight of the Nations, and be as a City set upon a Hill that cannot be hid; and according to these Prophecies, <HI>Iohn</HI> said of Christ, <HI>That he would purely purge his Floor,</HI> to wit, <HI>the Wheat from the Chaff, and ga∣ther his Wheat into his Garner.</HI> And concerning the measuring of the Gospel Church, it is prophecyed, <HI>Ier.</HI> 31.38, 39. <HI>Behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that the City shall be built to the Lord from the Tower of</HI> Hananeel, <HI>unto the Gate of the Corner</HI>▪ [The <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <HI>Hananeel</HI> signifieth, <HI>the Grace of God,</HI> intimating, that the City is to be built from that, and all the Furniture for its building is to come out of the Tower of the Grace of God] <HI>and the measuring Line shall yet go forth over against it, upon the Hill</HI> Gareb, <HI>and shall compass about to</HI> Goath: All which hath a spiritual and mystical Signification, relating to the Gospel Church, <HI>Gareb</HI> in <HI>Hebrew</HI> signifieth a <HI>scabby Disease,</HI> and <HI>Goath</HI> signifieth the <HI>lowing of Cattle,</HI> as intimating, That the measuring Line of Gods Grace shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to cure all, however diseased with the scabby Disease of Sin, that shall sincerely believe the Gospel, and it shall compass to

take in all that have the least sincere Breathings after God, and express their Desire after him, as Cattle that low after their Food, or Keeper, or them of their own Kind. Moreover, what signifieth the so exact and accurate measuring that Temple in <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> by the Man whom the Prophet saw with a Line of Flax in his Hand, and a measuring Reed of six Cubits long, by the Cubit and an Hand breadth to measure the Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, the Gates, the Porch, the Chambers and Courts of it, both the outer and inner Courts, but that the Gospel Church that shall be raised up, after the great Night of Apostacy, shall exactly answer to the mea∣suring Line and Reed, both in respect of Purity of Doctrine, Worship and Discipline, and due Qualifications of Church Members &amp; Ministers? And, conform to this, <HI>Iohn</HI> said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.1. <HI>There was given him a Reed, like unto a Rod, and the Angel stood, saying, Rise and measure the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that Worship therein; but the Court which is without the Temple, leave out, and measure it not, for it is given unto the Gentiles, &amp;c.</HI> intimating, that many should have the Name and Pro∣fession of <HI>Christians,</HI> but not be <HI>Christians</HI> in Nature, but <HI>Gentiles</HI> or <HI>Heathens,</HI> and such should not be numbered with the true Worshippers; The which measuring of the Temple cometh to pass before the seventh Trumpet soundeth, and therefore it is not long to that Time, for the sixth Trumpet hath begun its interval a great while ago. And <HI>lastly, Iohn</HI> giveth us the measure of the holy City, that is to appear in the time of the Thousand Years, the which as it doth principa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly relate to the Saints raised up in Immortal Bodies, so it may secondarily be understood to relate to the Church of God that sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l then consist of Saints living in Mortal Bodies, who have not attained to the state of Im∣mortality, but wait to be fitted for it, whose state shall be very excellent in all respects, as much as can consist with a state or condition of Mor∣tality. But even before the Thousand Years begin, there is good ground from Scripture to expect, a very excellent state and condition of a Church upon Earth, for some time, to answer, by way of Symbol or Allegory, to the Church of <HI>Philadelphia, Rev.</HI> 3. <HI>v.</HI> 7. to 13. the which Church, as nothing in her is reproved, so she hath the greatest Promise, that doth extend unto the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llenial Happiness,</HI> to be obtained by her; and the <HI>Gentile</HI> or <HI>Heathen Christians,</HI> having the Name, but not the Nature and Life of true Christians, seem to be symbolically designed by the Church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> that shall be contemporary there∣with, for some time. But what visible Company or Society of People
<PB N="140" REF="000691_0149_0FA9A10BA825FFF8"/>
hath yet appeared in these latter Ages, or doth at present appear, which hath these Qualifications, all whose Members are Holy and Righ∣teous, and among whom there are no <HI>Canaanites, i. e.</HI> no Hypocrites, or none of a wrong Spirit, so as all and every professed Member of the Society hath the measure of Knowledge, Faith, Holiness, Purity of Worship, that doth answer to the measuring Line? Do not even these who reckon themselves farthest advanced in Purity of Reformation, complain of the great Mixture that is among them? nor can it be ex∣pected but that a great Mixture will continue, until God shall raise up a Spirit of holy Zeal, and also of pure Discerning in many Brethren, which, as by the measuring Reed and Line, all the professing Members may be measured; and whoever have not the requisite Qualifications, after an impartial Examination, may be impartially, and without re∣spect of Persons, declared to be none of their Members.</P>
<P>And as concerning the due Qualifications of Church Members, that are to make up such a Gospel Church, as was either in the Apostles days, before there began a dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing from the Gospel Purity, or is yet to be in the Earth, after the Church is fully restored, there are some things absolutely requisite, both in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernal and external, to wit, both Life and Profession, or Power and Form of sound Doctrines and Practices; for as the best form of Words and Practices, doth not suffice without Life and Power, but is like the Sheeps Cloathing under the Wolfs Nature, so a great regard ought to be had to the purity of the Form and Pro∣fession, because although some-what of the Life and Power may be felt to stir and move in many, who have not the Purity of the Form and Profession of Truth in words and Practices, yet the want or defect of the Purity of the Form and Profession, is a great hurt and hinderance to the Life, and doth greatly tend to choak and quench the tender buddings of it; and whatever Society of People hath not the pure Form and Profession of Truth, both in respect of Principles and Do∣ctrines, as well as Practices of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> cannot be said to be the pure Church of Christ.</P>
<P>And as concerning the Definition of a true Church, I like that very well given by <HI>R. B.</HI> in his Book, called, <HI>A Two-fold Apology for the Church,</HI> viz. <HI>That it is a People gathered together by the Power of God into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of certain Principles and Doctrines, (of the Christian Religion) and also certain Practices and Performances, by which they are seperated and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from others, and have a certain Relation among themselves, and

who have or do Declare themselves Members of such a Society (Sanctification and Holiness being the great and chief end which moves them to gather to∣gether) who own, believe and profess the same Doctrines and Principles, and go under the same Distinction and Denomination,</HI> &amp;c.

And if any say, <HI>Men may profess to believe such Doctrines with their Mouthes, and yet not believe them in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ir Hearts.</HI> As this is to be granted, yet seeing it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that pretend to the inward Teachings of the Spirit and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thereof, That all faithful Members have in some measure a <HI>Spirit of Discerning,</HI> whereby they may savour and taste, and by the same may know who do sincerely believe what they declare and profess with their Mouthes, to believe, and who do not, but are Hypocrites▪ and even such who pretend most to a Spirit of Discerning, must ac∣knowledge, Men are best discerned and known what they believe when they are heard to declare or profess their Faith; <HI>for the Ear tryeth words as the Mouth tasteth Meat</HI>; and as the Bell is best known by its sound, whether it be good Mettle, or not, so that confession of words which cometh from true Faith in the Heart, hath a favour of Life in it, to the spiritual Discerners; but when nothing is declared in words of what a man believeth, it is much more difficult to know what that Man believeth. But again, as a mans Faith and Sanctification doth con∣stitute him a Member of Christ, and of his Church, in the sight of God, so the Declaration and Profession of it is altogether requisite to con∣stitute him a professed and visible Member of a <HI>Christian</HI> visible Society of People, called, a <HI>Church,</HI> according to which it was generally pra∣ctised in the antient Church, that such who believed and imbraced the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> did make some solemn Declaration and Confession of it
<PB N="142" REF="000691_0151_0FA9A10CEE13CAA8"/>
to some of their Brethren, that in the Mouth of certain Witnesses every word may be established; and concerning which <HI>Paul</HI> did write to <HI>Timothy, That he had professed a good Profession of the Faith, to which he was called, before many Witnesses,</HI> 1 Tim. 6.12. the <HI>Greek</HI> word signifieth most properly a <HI>verbal Confession</HI>; but where this is wanting to be per∣formed in a solemn and weighty manner, Multitudes of Ignorant Per∣sons, altogether ignorant of the first Principles of <HI>Christian Doctrine,</HI> and Unbelievers concerning them, will crowd in among others, and not only presume to be Church Members, but also to be Elders and Teachers in the Church, to the great scandal and offence of many, as hath come to pass in too many, to my certain knowledge. And as in the primitive Church, not only the Church Members were tryed, but the Church Officers also, even the very Deacons, and it was required in Teachers, <HI>That they might be apt or able to Teach,</HI> as well as orderly in Conversation, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.10. for seeing the Church in Scripture is com∣pared to a <HI>House built of Stones, polished and squared, after the similitude of a Palace, in the Wall of which no Stone is to be laid, but the measuring Line and Reed is to be applyed unto it</HI>; even so ought all the Members of the Church to be duely measured, and tryed, and proved with the Line and Rod of Truth. And though this is the work of God principally, yet it is the Work of the Saints and true Believers, working together instrumentally with God, and therefore the Church of <HI>Pergamos</HI> is re∣proved because <HI>she had them that did hold the Doctrine of</HI> Balaam, <HI>and of the</HI> Nicolaitans; and the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> is commended, <HI>That she could not bear them which are evil, and had tryed them which say, they are Apostles, and are not.</HI> Beside, what did it signifie, that in the Temple of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> there were Porters, and Keepers of the Doors of the Temple, but that in the Gospel Church there should be such who should be as Porters or Door-keepers, strictly to note and observe that none come into the Church, but such who come in duely qualified, and at the right door, which is Christ; and whoever come in by him, they not only believe him and his Doctrine, in the most principal and necessary things, but also profess the same? But the Profession and Declaration of Church Members, to what they believe, must not be, but of the most necessary and principal things or heads of Christian Doctrine, delivered in plain Scripture words, or such as are equivolent, plain and easie to be understood; and in some things of less Moment, an allowance is to be given, and Charity to be exercised towards them

that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, where they agree in the main and most necessary things; and because many may be sincere Believers in Christ, who have not a gift of Utterance, whereby to express their Faith, therefore it may suffice to such to answer to some plain Questions concerning the <HI>Chri∣stian Faith,</HI> that require no other Answer, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to say <HI>Yea</HI> or <HI>Amen</HI> to each Question.</P>

And it must be acknowledged, that many Scripture Prophecies and Sayings have not to this day been fully opened to the People of God, nay, not in the Apostles days in a general manner, and perhaps some things were hid even from the Pro∣phets and Apostles, which they prophecyed of, that are afterwards to be revealed; for said <HI>Daniel, I heard, but I understood not</HI>; but from this it will not follow, that any at this day have an equal degree of Knowledge with the Prophets and Apostles of the Lord; for though <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>We know in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art,</HI> yet who can justly say at this day, that he knoweth more than <HI>Paul?</HI> none should be so arrogant, but such who are, show their great Ignorance and Folly, and will bear their own burden for it. But they who think they are come to the Light and full extent of all that Knowledge that the Promises of God recorded in Scripture hold forth, if they will impartially examine themselves, they will find, they are in a great Mistake; for how many Sayings of holy Scripture, both Doctrinal and Prophetical are yet hid from most, even of the best men known to us upon Earth, or rather indeed from all? Who is there that can justly say, all the Sayings of the holy Scripture, both Doctrinal and Prophetical, are opened to him? Indeed, to my great Astonishment I have heard the like affirmed by some, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et at the same time I did find and detect them ignorant of some of the first <HI>Principles of the Doctrine of Christ.</HI> Many make too great and high Pre∣tences to divine Revelation, and Knowledge, and the Spirits inward Teachings▪ but when they are searched and examined, they are found very Ignorant; therefore <HI>Iohn</HI> did seasonably exhort, <HI>Believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every Spirit▪ but try the Spirits</HI>; for indeed it is not every Spirit that saith in Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>is the Spirit of God,</HI> that really is such; for it is the greatest Imposture &amp; Cheat that is or can be, when a false and wrong Spirit in

Preaching, and Praying, and Praising God, and serving and worship∣ping him is to be in Spirit and in Truth, but far another thing indeed to preach in the Spirit, to pray and sing and give Thanks in the Spirit, and to do these things purely, &amp; without all mixture: And alas! how oft do too many pretend to offer the right Fire on Gods Altar, and profess in words a great holy Zeal, but upon due search it is found to be but strange Fire, and Sparks of mans kindling, too oft the heat and wrath of mans Spirit doth pass for a divine fervour; all which showeth, that the Church is not as yet arrived to that perfect Restoration in Purity and good Order as is to be expected. But it is well that there is a blessed Number, yea, of Thousands that are travailing towards it; and there are some true Watch-men that God hath set up, and yet will set upon the Walls, that make mention of the Lord, and keep not Si∣lence, and give him no rest <HI>till he establish, and tell he make</HI> Jerusalem <HI>a Praise of the whole Earth,</HI> according to <HI>Isa.</HI> 62.7. Nor ought the faith∣ful Servants of the Lord be discouraged to labour in the Work of the Lord, in the diligent improvement of their Talent, that things are not in the general arrived to that purity among both Preachers and Professors, as is to be desired, &amp; will be fullfilled. The divers Societies and Gatherings of these called <HI>Christians</HI> at this day, are like divers Fields of Corn, of which some have a great many more Weeds than others, but all have some; and these called Labourers in these Fields are more or less skillfull to plant, to water, and to weed, and some also more slack, and others more diligent; What then is to be done in such a case? should not these who belong to the best &amp; cleanest Field remain where they are, and not go back to any other less pure; nor yet divide and seperate from their Brethren, but rather endeavour, partly by every ones more and more purifying himself, and perswading others, with a Spirit of Love and Meekness, to labour and press after more Purity, till all the old Leaven be purged out, and all the Weeds be taken away, and nothing left remaining but clean Grain? And none ought to make a Seperation from his <HI>Christian Brethren,</HI> whom he seeth to be the purest Society on Earth known to him, though perhaps he seeth that they are not altogether pure in all respects, untill he find that they are willfull, and settling down where they are, and refusing to travel onwards to greater degrees of Purity; nor even then is he to be hasty▪ but to wait to know the Lord to direct &amp; guide him in what he doth.

<P>And among other Instances, to prove that the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> and <HI>Church</HI> is not yet fully restored in the Earth, to that degree of Purity and Perfection that God hath promised, and will certainly perform, there is this one, <HI>viz.

But many Peachers are more ready to blame the People, and lay the default upon their Hearers, that they are not converted, than upon themselves; but surely it doth greatly concern all who pretend to be Preachers and Ministers of Christ, whether the blame doth not in great part lie upon themselves, yea or nay; as whether their Ministry be not barren, and the words they speak dead and dry? also, whether their Walking and Conversation, not being such as becometh the Mi∣nisters of Christ, be not a great Offence and stumbling Block to many? for it cannot be denyed, but even at this day there is a great deal of Preaching &amp; Praying used in Assemblies, by divers, &amp; yet very few con∣verted, though divers convinced, &amp; few grow much either in the Know∣ledge or Virtue of the Truth, under the frequent Ministry of divers, who pretend highly to the Spirits Teachings; and though the Ministry of many hath had great and blessed Success in our day, to turn many to Righteousness, which is a proof their Ministry is of God, yet the best Ministry that now is in being, so far as we know, hath reached little further than to two or three Nations, and but to a few in them, in comparison of others, who remain in darkness; but as the Purity, and more pure and perfect Restoration of the Church doth advance, the Word and Doctrine of the Gospel will advance, and have its free Course, until it be preached to all the Nations of the Earth, which, will be fullfilled before the end of the World, as Christ hath plainly fore-told.</P>

And as the time of the Churches great Peace and flourishing estate, before this last great Persecution under Anti-christ, doth answer unto and synochrine with the casting out of the Dragon, and the Saints Victory over him, and the great joy in Heaven on that account, so the Time of the last Persecution under Anti-christ, doth answer unto the new Persecution, that the Dragon (<HI>i▪ e▪</HI> the Devil in that outward Anti-christ) shall raise against the Woman (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Church) who again is to flee into the Wilderness, after her former return out of it, &amp; hath the two Wings of an Eagle given her to fly with; &amp; he who will ready and well consider what is written, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. as God shall be pleased to illuminate his Understanding, shall easily understand, that the Woman goeth again into the Wilderness, after her first Return out of it; and whereas her first abode in the Wilderness, under the inward &amp; spiritual Antichrist, was to be 1260 Days, signifying prophetically 1260 Years (which time is near to be expired (the truth of which Experience doth sufficiently prove to any but a little skilled in Church History, that the inward &amp; spiritual Anti-christ in the false Church, especially in the <HI>Pa∣pacy,</HI> hath prevail'd above 1200 <HI>years</HI> already past) her last abode is to be 1260 Days litterally &amp; vulgarly understood; nor is it unusual in Scrip∣ture that both Days and Years be sometimes taken litterally and vul∣garly understood, and sometimes figuratively and mystically.

as seemeth exceeding probable; but as to the precise Number of Years, nothing is positively to be concluded by me in this case, Time will dis∣cover the matter.</P>
<P>By all that hath been said, it doth plainly appear, that the full and perfect Restoration of the Church to all that Glory and Blessedness, and plenty of divine and spiritual Induements that God hath promised, and is left upon Record in holy Scriptue, is left to the time of the Thousand Years, which according to great Probability is to begin about the length of the Age of a Man after the Year 1700 is expired; but I un∣dertake not to affirm this from the Spirit of Prophecy; for some have too rashly undertaken to prophecy things, that have not come to pass in the time they prefixed, and so have proved themselves f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lse Prophets, the which rashness I resolve not to be guilty of, therefore what I say in the case, is only in way of Probability, grounded upon some seem∣ingly strong Rational Perswasions, infered from the best Chronological Account I could make, and if Time discover the truth of it, there may be found in it some-what more than a probable Conjecture, but I affirm it not positively, for I had rather dye than give occasion to any to bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> me with the Name of a false Prophet. And within this time of the <HI>Thousand Years,</HI> which I positively believe and affirm, as a most cer∣tain thing that is to come to pass, the Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch of God upon Earth, (which is the Saints that shall be living in mortal Bodies, born of Wo∣men, and begot as we are by humane Generation) shall not only be restored to all that G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory and Blessedness that ever she had in the purest time in the Apostles dayes, after Christs Ascention and giving the holy Ghost, but she shall be enl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rged, and enriched with many excellent Induements, and Gifts, and Blessings of God, both inwardly and out∣wardly, far beyond what the generality of true Christians witnessed in the Apostles days; and yet even then I do not allow that any should say, there shall be any of the Saints, living in mortal Bodies within the Thousand Years, that shall exceed the Apostles of the Lord, or equal them in all spiritual Gifts, it is enough that they be near, though infe∣riour unto them. And that which shall greatly encrease the Dignity and Felicity of the Church of the Saints living in mortal Bodies within the Thousand Years, is, that they shall converse frequently with the Lord Jesus Christ and the raised Saints, who have put off the mortal Cloathing, and put on the immortal, and have familiar Conversation with them, as the Apostles had with Christ after his Resurrection, and
<PB N="156" REF="000691_0165_0FA9A1E1F0A63170" MS="y"/>
may learn and be taught of them many great Mysteries belonging to the Kingdom of God, secretly couched and wrapt up in Enigmaes and Symboles of the holy Scriptures, that formerly they did not under∣stand, even as it is written, <HI>That Christ after his Resurrection conversed with the Disciples, and expounded unto them out of</HI> Moses, <HI>and the</HI> Psalms, <HI>and the Prophets, the Things concerning himself, and opened their Vnder∣standings to understand the Scriptures</HI>; for there is no Inconsistency in it, but a very good agreement to be inwardly taught by the Spirit of Christ, and to be outwardly taught by Christ by word of Mouth; for no doubt, the Disciples of Christ were both inwardly and outwardly taught by Christ many things, both before and after his Resurrection. But the Glory of the Church of God, <HI>i. e.</HI> of the Saints living in mortal Bodies upon Earth, who shall be born of Women, and begot of Men in the way of lawful Marriage, and who shall eat and drink the Fruits of the Earth, with all becoming Moderation, &amp; holy Reverence, and Thanks-giving, is such, that no words or declaration is sufficient to express it, only some hints are given of it, so far as the Scriptures hold forth, according to the small measure of that divine Illumination I have received. And tho' the chief Government over all the Earth and Mankind, that shall live therein within the Thousand Years, shall belong to Christ and the raised Saints (who shall frequently outwardly appear to Men, both good and bad, or disappear, as they shall see meet, and as Christ used to do after his Resurrection; for he appeared or disappeared, as he pleased) yet in a secondary &amp; subordinate way and manner, the Saints living in mortal Bodies shall also reign with Christ and the raised Saints, over all Nations of the Earth, and they shall have the full dispose and command of all the Riches and Treasures of the Earth, which they shall use with all holy and godly Moderation and Discretion, to the Glory of God and the mutual Comfort of one ano∣ther; for then shall that be fullfilled which is written in <HI>Isa.</HI> 23.18. concerning the Riches of <HI>Tyre,</HI> after the return of her Captivity, <HI>and her Merchandize and her Hire shall be Holiness to the Lord; it shall not be treasured nor laid up, for her Merchandize shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, &amp; for durable Cloathing</HI>; but the raised Saints, that have put off the mortal Cloathing shall neither need nor use any of these things, <HI>neither shall they Marry and give in Marriage, but be as the Angels of God,</HI> as Christ hath taught, when he proved the Resur∣rection of the Dead against the Sadduces, and I wish such as hold the

gross Error of <HI>Sadducism</HI> at this day, would well consider Christs Do∣ctrine in this particular.</P>
<P>And though the Church of Christ, before the Thousand Years begin, will not arrive to her most perfect State of Glory and Happiness, yet there is cause to believe, that within that preparatory Time of 70 Years, above-mentioned, (answering to the time of <HI>Daniels</HI> Numbers, the one of 1290. exceeding that of <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Number in the <HI>Revelations</HI> by 30. and the other of 1335. containing 40 years more, making in all 70. and then last of all the Persecution under the outward Anti-christ, of about 3 years and a half▪ which bringeth to that blessed Time 1335. as it is said, <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.12. <HI>Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the Thou∣sand three hundred and five and thirty days</HI>; for then the seventh Trum∣pet soundeth, and the Thousand Years begin) the Glory of the true Church shall be exceeding great, and nothing short, as to the general, of what it was in the Apostles days, in respect of Virtue, Holiness, Peace, Love, Knowledge, and all spiritual Induements, yea, and Gifts of Tongues, &amp; Miracles; for since Nations of strange Languages shall be converted, there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to believe, that the Gift of Tongues shall be given to the Church, as well as other miraculous and extraor∣dinary Gifts. Nor should this seem strange unto any, that I affirm the Gift of Miracles will be given unto such, whom God shall think worthy, when the Church cometh more perfectly to be restored; for if Anti-christ shall be permitted to work false Miracles and lying Wonders, to deceive many, as the Scripture declareth, it is not to be questioned but God will raise up his faithful Servants and Witnesses to work true Mi∣racles and true Signs and Wonders, to convince Unbelievers. And the Scripture doth expresly declare, that the two Witnesses that shall prophecy in Sackcloth, in the time of that great outward Anti-christ that is to come, shall work Miracles, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.5, 6. <HI>for if any man will hurt them, Fire proceedeth out of their Mouthes and devoureth their Enemies; these have Power to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Heaven, that it rain not in the days of their Prophecy</HI> (as formerly <HI>Elias</HI> had such Power) <HI>and have Power over Waters to turn them to Blood</HI> (as <HI>Moses</HI> did formerly) <HI>and to smite the Earth with all Plagues, as often as they will.</HI> And though some streign this wholly to a Mystical and Allegorical sence, and alledge, <HI>That this is already fullfilled under the inward &amp; spiritual Anti-christ in the Papacy</HI>; yet it is certainly to have a litteral fullfilling; for the Prophecying of the Witnesses be∣longeth only to a time betwixt the sixth and seventh Trumpet, and

And who can doubt that there will be great plen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of Miracles daily seen in the Church, when she cometh to her Perfection in the Thousand Years, when the dead Bodies of the Saints shall be raised from the Dead, and appear to the Living, after they have so long remained dead. And the Saints living in mortal Bodies, when they are fitted for it, shall be changed from a state of Mortality to a state of Immortality, so as to ascend to Heaven in the sight of mortal Men, than which there are scarce any greater Miracles, of which, <HI>Elias</HI> being carried up, was a Type and Symbol.</P>
<P>And to the Glory of the Church, as it shall consist of Saints living in Mortal Bodies, until they be changed, it shall be no small addition, that there shall be a very great Knowledge of things both divine and Natural, that shall be generally given to the faithful, and Mysteries both of Divine and Natural Things shall be wonderfully revealed, and the Books both of the Scripture and of the Creation will be opened, and a Perfection there will be of all Arts and Sciences, which at present are in great part very defective; and it is worthy of Observation, that the Knowledge of Divine and Natural Things doth increase together gradually, as these latter Ages do sufficiently discover, and the Time to come will yet more fully demonstrate; for God Almighty is the God

both of Grace and Nature, and the Knowledge of all Nature and Na∣tural Things, that is true and real, is of God, as well as the Knowledge of all Spiritual and Divine Things, so that it may be warrantably con∣cluded, That Children in that time will be more wise and understand∣ing in Things both Divine and Natural, than the wisest of Men are at present; and there will come after us, that shall far exceed us in Know∣ledge, and other great and excellent Induements and Gifts; Therefore let none esteem of their present Attainments above what is convenient, nor imagine th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they are come to the highest pitch of Wisdom or Virtue; nor let any set themselves in opposition to further Discoveries of Divine Knowledge in things both Divine and Natural, lest they be found Fighters against God, and imagine a vain thing; for as no Man can stop the flowing of the Sea or the rising of the Sun, so can none stop the increase of the Light of the Day of God, that is yet to increase, and that with an exceeding Increase, beyond what can be conceived, but let all be humble, and sob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r in Mind, and keep faithful to God in the measure of divine Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht already received, still Praying and waiting for a further increase, and standing open and ready to receive the In∣crease of it, as it shall come both Immediately and Instrumently, for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill come both ways; and whoever rejecteth the Light that God causeth to shine to any, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough any Instrument of his fitting &amp; sending, they reject God himself in so doing.

<P>And to <HI>Conclude</HI> the whole matter concerning the Restoration of the Church, and her arriving at that perfect State, which the Promises of God hold forth she is to arrive unto before the end of the World, it is to be considered, That the due and right Administration of Gospel Discipline, used in the Power and Authority of God, as God shall be pleased to reveal it in fitted and prepared Instruments, will greatly conduce thereunto, as it was in the best &amp; purest state that the Church had, in the Apostles days, where Discipline was administred and good Order observed, in the real Power and Authority of God, which put a great Impression of a holy Fear and Reverence upon all Believers in that Day; for the Power &amp; Authority of God, with which the Apostles and Ministers of Christ, and Elders, were cloathed, was so manifest, that it was discerned, seen and felt inwardly by all that had any measure of a spiritual discerning, and where any were blinded by Sathan, and were stubborn, willfull and Rebellions, the Judgments of God were manifested against them, invisible Effects, as in the case of <HI>Annanias</HI> and <HI>Saphriah,</HI> who were struck with Bodily Death for their Sin of Dis∣simulation; and so it was in the Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> when <HI>Corah, Dia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI>

and <HI>Abiram</HI> rebelled against <HI>Moses</HI> the Servant of God, that they dyed not the common Death of men, but the Earth swallowed them up alive; and when <HI>Miriam</HI> spoke against <HI>Moses,</HI> she was struck with a Leprosie, which was not heal'd until <HI>Moses</HI> pray'd for her unto the Lord, <HI>Num.</HI> 12. And the Sentence of Excommunication that was then in the Church, &amp; which not only the Apostles, but others had Power to pass against such as deserved it, was a thing that was done by a divine Power and Au∣thority, that had some manifest Effects upon the Persons, against whom it was inflicted, that made it so very dreadful; and therefore it is said, (after that which came to pass in the matter of <HI>Annanias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira) Great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard these things, Acts</HI> 5.11. And <HI>vers.</HI> 13. it is said, <HI>And of the rest durst no man joyn himself to them, but the People magnified them.</HI> And therefore it may war∣rantably be expected, that when due Gospel Discipline shall be duely exercised in the Power and Authority of God, in the Church, the Judg∣ments of God will be manifest both inwardly and outwardly, in such manner as will make the Hypocrites afraid to present themselves as Members of the Church of Christ; and this will be as a Fan in the hand of the Lord Jesus Christ, to sweep his floor, and to seperate the Wheat from the Chaff: And truely the time draweth near that the hour of Gods Judgments will come yet more manifestly, and then great will be the Wo that shall be due to such as make a great and large Profession of the Truth, and yet are not in it; for of a certain, a <HI>fanning, searching, sifting and winnowing Time is very near at hand,</HI> and the Spirit of Christ is grieved with the liberty and looseness that too many take, who even profess the Teachings and Leadings of the Spirit, &amp; Judgment is like to begin at such; and most assuredly God is calling for a further degree of Purity and Reformation, than any have yet attained unto, and will in due time effect it, and that not only by his own immediate Power, but by raising up Instruments to work with him; for great things God hath done, and yet will do, by Instruments of his fitting and preparing, in the Earth. Therefore it is high time for us to be waiting for the Coming of the Lord to be revealed in greater Power and Authority, to cleanse his House and Garden, that none may refuse to joyn with him, when he calleth, or oppose or slight any Instruments of his raising for such a work, however mean and despisable they may seem to be in the Eyes of Men. And surely it is matter of grief to find some sitting down at ease where they are, and thinking all is well enough already; and

measure of Conformity in the Soul and Heart to the same, and hath some influence upon both Soul and Body, to do and perform some parts of Obedience that God requireth, so as to become a Servant in the House of God; but where this Law is Transgressed, it worketh Wrath, and convinceth the Soul of sin, and loadeth or burdeneth, and afflicteth the Soul both with the sence of Sin, and of the Anger and Judgment of God because of sin, and so maketh the Soul poor and needy, and wanting the Physitian of Value to heal and cure it. And thus far the Soul may be advanced in a meer legal state and condition of a Servant, and have a knowledge and faith of God, and love towards God, as a Servant hath to his Master, and be in great fear to disobey the righteous Law of God, and be under great Trouble and sence of the Judgment and Displeasure of God, because of sin; and when he doth well, he may find some Peace, Joy, Comfort and Acceptance with God; but be∣cause in this legal State his Obedience is not perfect, so nor is his Peace; for the Law (simply as such) whether outwardly or inwardly admi∣nistred, maketh nothing Perfect; and this is the state of the best and most devout and religious <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who have not the Faith of Christ crucified and raised again, although they do by Nature the things con∣tained in the Law (to wit, Nature partly washed by the living Word of God put into them) yet their Conscience beareth witness, That they have oft sinned, and their Thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and therefore they can have no perfect Peace with God, nor Justification before him, nor sure knowledge of the Remission of Sin, while in this meer legal, servile and gentile state▪ 4<HI>thly,</HI> To open the Souls Eye to see Christ, its Physitian, even whole Christ, without dividing him, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w it needeth Christ to save and redeem it, both as he came outwardly in the Flesh to dye for it, and rise again for its Justification, and as he cometh inwardly to apply to it, and work in it, the blessed Effects and Fruits of his Death, Resur∣rection, Ascention, Mediation and Intercession in Heaven for us 5<HI>tly,</HI> To enable the Soul effectually to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieve in Christ, and to apply Christ to it, whole and undivided, both in his outward and inward Com∣ing, and to work in it, not only some beginnings of true Faith in Christ crucified, &amp; raised again, but also of true Repentance, causing the Soul to look on him (by the Eye of Faith) whom it had pierced, and mourn bitterly because of the same; also, of Humility, Meekness, Temperance, Patience, Love, Hope, Joy, and holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with all other

So that on the <HI>first Day,</HI> God saying, <HI>Let there be Light,</HI> and causing the Light to shine, and dividing it from the Darkness, answereth to Gods inward enlightning the dark Soul and Mind of Man with some true measure of Knowledge, both to know God and his Light shining in it, though in the Darkness; and also to know and discern the Light from the Dark∣ness.

<P>And as every Day had its Evening &amp; Morning, save only the <HI>seventh,</HI> this signifieth, that until the Work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ be perfected in Man, there will remain a Mixture in him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> &amp; Darkness, Knowledge and Ignorance, Good and Evil, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Light doth prevail over the Darkness, Knowledge over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Evil, until the Perfection be witnessed on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>is very good</HI>; the setting the Evening before the Morning, in the Work of the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dayes, doth answer to that which remaineth of Darkness in every Man, being necessary to be removed gradually, before the Light be discerned to shine forth in clearness.</P>

But devout and religious <HI>Gentiles</HI> or <HI>Heathens,</HI> who have not the Faith of Christ crucified, they have not that Influence of the holy Spirit that true Believers in Christ crucified and raised again have, but an Influence of a far inferiour sort and degree; for though the Spirit of God is <HI>One</HI> in being, yet it is said in Scripture to be <HI>seven fold,</HI> and also <HI>two fold,</HI> to wit, the Spirit of Bondage, to such who are but Servants in the House of God, and the Spirit of Adoption to such who are Sons, through Faith in Christ Jesus; and this two fold kind of divine Influence is that which by way of Analogy doth answer to the Waters below and above the Firmament, these below the Firmament answering to the divine In∣fluences given to them who are under the Law, &amp; these Waters above the Firmament answer to the divine Influences of the Spirit given to true <HI>Christians</HI> and Believers in Christ crucified, under the Gospel; for God hath so honoured his Son, and glorified him, that because he hum∣bled himself to the Death of the Cross, for the sins of Men, therefore he hath ordained it, that this more excellent Influence and Grace of the holy Ghost should accompany the Doctrine and Preaching of <HI>Christ crucified and raised again,</HI> and the Faith of him, as such. Hence it is that the Gospel of Christ is called, <HI>The Gospel of our Salvation,</HI> and the <HI>Power of God unto Salvation,</HI> and Christ crucified, <HI>The Wisdom &amp; Power of God.</HI> And it is very evident from the Writings of the New Testa∣ment, That these only were called <HI>Christians,</HI> who were Believers in the crucified Jesus, and that he rose again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and became Followers of his Virtues and holy Life, and by so doing hoped to receive Eternal Life, and the Resurrection of the Dead by him.

<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> As on the first Day God said, <HI>Let there be Light, and there was Light, and God divided the Light from the Darkness, and the Evening and the Morning was the first Day</HI>; so in the first Thousand Years of the World, after Man had fallen into great Darkness, God caused his Light to shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e out of Darkness, generally in some sma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l measure, to enlighten all Mankind, whereby they had some knowledge of God, and whereby they could discern and distinguish Light from Darkness, Good from Evil.</P>

And this inward Law or Light duely and justly divideth the Waters from the Waters, (as the outward Pirmament doth) so as to dispence the higher Influences of the Spirit only to true Believers in Christ, but the lower Influences to such as sought no further than to the Righteousness of the Law. But during these Ages of the World, there were but few, in comparison of the ge∣nerality of Mankind, that had the true Faith of Christ; yet in the darkest Age some had it, and in all Ages God hath had his Church, and will have to the end of the World, <HI>against which the Gates o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hell shall not prevail.</HI> Compare then the Law or Light within men in the 2d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, to a Book or Roll written without and within, that without, the <HI>Law,</HI> that within, the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>

degree, even as Vegetables have a lower degree of Life than Annimals, while in the mean time the generality of the Nations or <HI>Gentiles</HI> remain∣ed barren, until the fifth Day, that they were made fruitful in the 5th Age or Millennium, to bring forth. [But <HI>Note,</HI> that what is here said of either the Church or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> is to be understood of the generality, and not of all universally; for it must be acknowledged to Gods praise that as there were excellent Men, and true Believers in Christ, &amp; many great Prophets in the Church of God in this third Age of the World, so there were some excellent Men among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who were not in∣cluded in the visible Church, but had true Faith in Christ, as <HI>Iob, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> As on the fifth Day <HI>God made the Waters fruitful to bring forth Fishes and Fowls,</HI> so in the 5th Thousand Years, which began immediately after Christs Resurrection and Ascention, God made the <HI>Gentiles</HI> (who were converted to the Faith of Christ) fruitful, to bring forth <HI>Christian Virtues,</HI> answerable to that degree of Life in Fishes and Fowls; for by the Preaching of the Gospel, immediately after Christs Resurr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction &amp; Ascention, the holy Ghost was given to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> through Faith, &amp; more of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> believed, than <HI>Iews</HI>; and therefore it is only said, <HI>The Waters were made fruitful on the</HI> 5<HI>th Day,</HI> because (in comparison) few of the <HI>Iews</HI> believed in Christ in that Age, or yet do at this Day.</P>

But then, to make the Chronology of the World to agree in all its parts, and be in Harmony with the whole, and exactly to correspond with the general Analogies, we may suppose it as possible, that in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Geneologies the years may be reckoned not perfect and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, but current, each Geneo∣logy wanting some odd days▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> moneths, to make the years perfect years; and thus it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the ten years added to the Period from <HI>Adam</HI> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them 1666. may be taken away from the Periods follow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the whole shall remain, as given in the particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> seeing it cannot be rationally supposed that the years of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when they began to have Chil∣dren born unto them, were precisely perfect years, but rather either current, or some odd days, weeks or months over and above, we may therefore give some grains of allowance for such a small Number of years as ten, that may be either added to or substracted from certain Periods, that the general and particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the better agree; by the General, I mean that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Analogies, and Mystical Numbers, as is above described <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by such Analo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of Numbers, that Christ behoved to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Death, and rise again, in the close or ending of the fourth <HI>Millennium,</HI> and not in the fifth or sixth, as some have imagined, following the <HI>Septuagint</HI> Translation, which through some mistake, widely differs from the <HI>Hebrew.</HI></P>
<P>Now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hether the Years from <HI>Adam</HI> to the Floood be reckoned, as commonly, 1657. or 1666. it maketh no Error in the general Sum, seeing if we add ten years to the first Period, we substract it from the following Periods.

<P>And whereas it hath been said above in this Treatise, <HI>That by the most probable Computation, the Thousand Years shall begin about the Year of the World</HI> 5740 <HI>which is from Christs Resurrection</HI> 1740. Besides the other Reasons given, and Analogies of Mystical Numbers, this seemeth my∣stically to be contained in the Number of the Years of the clean Beasts, that God commanded <HI>Abraham</HI> to offer up for a Sacrifice, when God made the Promise to him, <HI>That his Seed should inhabit all that Land from the River of</HI> Aegypt, (<HI>viz.</HI> Nylus) <HI>to the great River</HI> Euphrates; which hath not been hitherto accomplished, but the accomplishment of it is to be referred to the beginning of the Thousand Years. Now the killing and dividing the Beasts signifieth, That <HI>Abraham's</HI> Posterity should under go great Sufferings before the Promise should be accom∣plished, and that they should be seperated asunder and scattered, and yet come together again, signified by the laying each piece one against another; but that he divided not the Birds, signifieth, That in the Per∣secution they were to suffer in <HI>Egypt</HI> under <HI>Pharoah,</HI> they should not be seperated asunder; and therefore the Birds refer to the time that

<P>The <HI>First</HI> is the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> her Interval extendeth from Christs Resurrection and Ascention, to the year 333.
