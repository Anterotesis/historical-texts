<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is a known Observation, verified by Experience, as well as grounded upon Scripture-Prediction, That sinfull Security is the great Disease of the last Times, whereunto those Churche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are especially obnoxious, that have escaped the grosser Pollutions of the World and Antichrist, and do enjoy Rest, and Peace, and Free∣dome from hard Bondage. Who sees not (that sees any thing) that the Security of this Age is very great? And may we not rationally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that many of the Wise, as well as the Foolish Virgins in this Land of Rest, and Quietness, and Fulness of Spiritual Enjoyments, are slum∣bering and sleeping? Consult we the Sacred Oracle, and we shall readily be informed, that one great Reason of the prevailing of this Distemper, is, because we <HI>put far from us the evil day,</HI> Amos <HI>6.1, 3.</HI> Banishing the Thoughts of <HI>a day of Trouble,</HI> is both the Cause and Effect of carnal <HI>ease in Sion.</HI> How seasonable then is this practicall, solid, succinct, and comprehensive Discourse, which here offers it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to thy view, wherein the Reverend and Iudicious Author demonstrates with much strength and evidence (yea, I say, gives not onely <HI>Probable Indications,</HI> but Scriptural and <HI>Rational Demonstrations,</HI> according to the Common Law of Divine Dispensations) that <HI>a day of Trouble is near to</HI> New-England? Many are the solemn Warnings that the Lord hath given of a day of Trouble hastning upon us. <HI>The Lion hath roared, and the Trumpet hath been blown; And shall not the people be afraid?</HI> What a dead sleep of Midnight-Security hath surprised and overtaken them, that do not hear the loud Report of the many Divine Warning-Pieces that are gone off among us? Wo to those Rebellious ones that say, <HI>The dayes are prolonged, and every Vision faileth;</HI> when the Lord saith, <HI>The dayes are at hand, and the effect of every Vision,</HI> Ezek. <HI>12.22, 23, 25▪</HI> And will men lye down on the Top of a Mast in the midst of the Sea to sleep there? and suffer themselves to be over-born by Security in the mouth of danger? When the Iudgements of God are on their March towards us, shall we not be Alarmed? When certain Intelligence comes, that they are ready to surprise us in our Quarters, shall we be stupidly secure and sensless? When they are in view and prospect, making near and sen∣sible Approaches to us, shall we say▪ <HI>It is but the Shadow of the Mountains,</HI> (Iudg. <HI>9 36.</HI>) and not rather prepare and posture our selves to go forth to meet the Lord in a way of Humiliation, Supplica∣tion,

and Reformation? Though there are many Reasons to conceive (as the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thy Author of these Sermons intimates) that God will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an utter End of us; yet we have cause en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh to conclude, that <HI>He will not leave us altogether unpunished.</HI> Verily we have caused our day of Trouble to draw near, <HI>Ezek. 22.4.</HI> And is it not high time for us to shake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff Sloth and Security, and to <HI>wait</HI> for the Lord <HI>in the way of his Judgements,</HI> and to make our Supplication to him (as <HI>David,</HI> in the Person, and as a Type of Christ▪ <HI>Psal. 22.11, 19) Be not far from us, for trouble is near?</HI> To have Trouble near, and the Comforter, that should relieve us, far off, to have the Philistines upon us, and God departed from us, will be a distressed condition. It is the Interest, and will be the desire of every gracious heart, to have God near, when Trouble is near. Gods coming near to us in Iudge∣ment will trouble us; but his coming near to us in Mercy will either set Trouble far off, or sanctifie it, and turn it into Advantage and Comfort to us, and sweetly alter the property of it. The design of this Discourse, and the Publication of it, is not to enfeeble and dis∣courage any of the Lords Servants, but to startle and awaken sleepy sinners (that cry Peace and Safety to themselves) that they may not be taken as Fishes in the net, and caught as Birds in a snare, or through ignorance of their time, be snared in an evil time, falling suddenly upon them: And to engage all persons of Interest with God, to stir up themselves to take hold of him, when he seems to be going from us, and to get into the Gap, and make up the Hedge, that the Evils threatned and approaching may not break in upon us, but there may be a lengthning out of our Tranqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity. That this vigilant Watchmax, and wise Discerner of the Signs of the Times, may not onely deliver his own Soul by his plain and faithfull <HI>Premonitions,</HI> but also through the rich Blessing of God accompanying these usefull and sea∣sonable Sermons, may instrumentally deliver the Souls of many others, by awakening them to <HI>Watch and pray, that they may be accounted worthy to escape the things that shall come to pass,</HI> is the hearty Desire and Prayer of him who is</P>

<HEAD>EZEK. 7.7. —The day of Trouble is near—</HEAD>
<P>THis Chapter doth contain a denunciation of Judge∣ment.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sermon</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Which Judgement is described,</P>
<P N="1">1. From <HI>the Causes</HI> of it. The principal Effi∣cient Cause was <HI>God,</HI> He is the Cause of all evils of Punishment: There is no evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it; He createth darkness. The Instrumental <HI>adjuvent</HI> Cause was the <HI>Caldeans,</HI> they did <HI>help forward the affliction,</HI> and are therefore said to be the worst of men, yea the <HI>worst of the Heathen.</HI> The Impulsive Procuring Cause was Sin: there are three sins mentioned in this Chapter (of which afterwards) as the Procurers of the Judgement threatned. The Final Cause was the Glory of God, even that he migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be <HI>known to be the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Judgement here denounced is set forth from <HI>the Subject</HI> of it, or the persons upon whom it came, <HI>v.</HI> 2. <HI>Thus saith the Lord God to the Land of Israel:</HI> which is not to be under∣stood of the Ten Tribes, who were gone into Captivity before this Prophesie was written, but the <HI>Iews</HI> are here called <HI>Israel.</HI> Often in the Scripture, not onely in the New Testament, but in the Old, the <HI>Iews</HI> are called <HI>Israel:</HI> therefore <HI>Iehoshaphat</HI> King of <HI>Iudah</HI> is styled, <HI>The King of Israel.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Judgement here threatned is set forth from the <HI>Greatness</HI> of it: therefore it is called <HI>the end,</HI> ver. 2, 3. and an <HI>onely Evil,</HI> ver. 5. that is, a grand Evil: as when <HI>David</HI> con∣fesseth, <HI>Against thee, thee</HI> [onely] <HI>have I sinned,</HI> Psal. 51.4. <HI>i. e.</HI> against thee chiefly: So an <HI>onely Evil</HI> here, noteth a principal evil, yea a sweeping Judgement, so as that there should not be need for affliction to rise up the second time.</P>
<P N="4">4. This Judgement is set forth from the <HI>Certainty</HI> of it: therefore <HI>ver.</HI> 6. 'tis said, <HI>It is come, it is come.</HI> The Prophet doth repeat those words, <HI>It is come,</HI> six times over, which sheweth not onely the vehemency of the Speaker, but the cer∣tain undoubted futurition of the Evil spoken of.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="2" REF="000192_0005_0FA31723E398E658"/>5. The Judgement here denounced is described from the <HI>Celerity and Proximity</HI> of it. This may likewise be intimated by those Repetitions and <HI>Iterations,</HI> but now hinted. As <HI>Io∣seph</HI> said to <HI>Pharaoh, Gen.</HI> 41.32. <HI>And for that the dream was doubled twice, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</HI> So, inasmuch as the Prophet is so <HI>Repetitious,</HI> as here we see, it was to shew, that the Evil would <HI>certainly</HI> and <HI>shortly</HI> come to pass. And that is the scope of this Verse, <HI>The morning is come,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Execution-day</HI> is at hand: for those words seem to be an allusion unto the <HI>Iews</HI> Custome of executing Malefactors in the morning. Hence <HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>Psal.</HI> 101.8. <HI>I will early destroy the wicked</HI>; or as the words are, <HI>In the morning</HI> I will destroy them, it being the Custome in <HI>Israel</HI> of old, to cut off Malefactors betimes in the morning. But a little for opening the words.</P>
<P><HI>Day</HI>] here noteth Time. We must not think that the trouble here spoken of, continued but for the space of 24 hours; for the words have respect to the <HI>Caldean Siege,</HI> which lasted two years, yea to the Captivity, which lasted seventy years. It is therefore usual in the Scripture to denote a <HI>Time of very long continuance,</HI> by the name and notion of <HI>a day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of Trouble</HI>] The Hebrew word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> noteth great trou∣ble. <HI>Iunius</HI> translateth it, <HI>The day of vexation.</HI> It is the same day of trouble which is spoken of, <HI>Ier.</HI> 30.7. <HI>Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it, it is even the time of Iacobs trouble.</HI> When the City and Temple were taken, and burnt with fire; when the King had all his Children slain before his eyes, and then his eyes put out, and he clapt in Chains, and carried Ca∣ptive, that was a day of trouble that had none like it.</P>
<P><HI>Is near</HI>] It is not here said, how near that day was, out it is certain from other Scriptures, that this trouble began within three or four years after this Prophesie. For <HI>Ezekiel</HI> wrote in the fifth year of <HI>Zedekiah,</HI> and the <HI>Caldean</HI> Siege be∣gan in the ninth year of <HI>Zedekiah</HI>; so that this trouble began within four years after these words were Preached, and with∣in six years execution was done upon <HI>Israel:</HI> therefore well might the Prophet say, <HI>The day of trouble is near.</HI></P>
<P>And Trouble may be said to be near, in a double respect: 1. In appearance, and probability. As it is said of <HI>Epaphrodi∣tus,</HI> that he was <HI>nigh unto death,</HI> Phil. 2.27. <HI>i. e.</HI> in appearance,
<PB N="3" REF="000192_0006_0FA3172410C24880"/>
and as to an eye of reason. 2. <HI>Trouble</HI> may be said to be <HI>near</HI> in reality. And so was this day of trouble of which the Text speaketh, near not onely in appearance, but in reality; and therefore the next words are, <HI>and not the sounding again of the Mountains,</HI> that is to say, there should be more then a meer (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>fragor Montium</HI>) Eccho of troubles. If men shout (as in the Mountainous Land of <HI>Israel</HI> they were wont to do) amongst Mountains, it will cause an <HI>Eccho,</HI> a <HI>sounding again,</HI> which soon vanisheth, and cometh to nothing; but saith the Prophet, the sound of troubles at hand shall not vanish so. The <HI>Iews</HI> heard a report, a rumour, as if the <HI>Cal∣deans,</HI> whose cry was in their ships, were coming against them; now the Lord would have them to understand, that it should be more then a <HI>sound</HI> or rumour, even a <HI>reality.</HI> The divine Threatnings were but an empty sound with them, but the Troubles coming for the contempt thereof, should be more then an <HI>empty sound.</HI></P>
<P>From the Judgement here threatned, in consideration with the Author and Subject of it, we may observe,</P>
<P>That God doth sometimes bring Times of great Trouble upon his own People.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Doct.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Now in the Doctrinal handling of this Truth, there are four things may be spoken to. 1. That <HI>Israel,</HI> i. e. the Church of God, is subject unto troubles in this world. 2. What troubles they are which Gods people are here sub∣ject unto. 3. What are the signs of a day of trouble being near. 4. The Reasons of this Doctrine, whence it is that God doth bring times of great trouble upon his own people.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Lords people are subject unto great troubles,</HI> Scri∣ptures are abundant in bearing witness to that: <HI>Acts</HI> 14.22. <HI>We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdome of God.</HI> As the children of <HI>Israel</HI> went through the Red Sea, and through the Wilderness, before they could enter into <HI>Canaan,</HI> so must we wade through a Red Sea of Troubles, and pass through a Wilderness of Miseries, e're we can arrive at the heavenly <HI>Canaan.</HI> Here is the difference between this world and that which is to come. Indeed in <HI>the world to come,</HI> the Church shall be freed from troubles: it is therefore said,
<PB N="4" REF="000192_0007_0FA31724C61DC7D8"/>
<HI>Rev.</HI> 21. <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>There was no more sea,</HI> such a day will come, when there shall be <HI>no more sea,</HI> no more troubles and com∣bustions in the world as now there is, but as for the Saints, <HI>God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain:</HI> but before this day, <HI>Heaven and earth shall pass a∣way,</HI> and <HI>there must be a new heaven, and a new earth</HI>; that is to say, this will be fulfilled <HI>in the world to come,</HI> but not in this world. Hence the Apostle speaketh of <HI>the sufferings of this present time,</HI> Rom. 8.18. so that during <HI>this present time,</HI> the Church will be subject to sufferings. Therefore also the same Apostle calls <HI>this present world,</HI> an <HI>evil world,</HI> Gal. 1.4. So that Christians must look for evils, they must look for troubles, as long as the <HI>present world</HI> shall endure. Two or three things may be briefly touched on, as <HI>demonstrations</HI> of this.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Christ himself was exposed to sufferings when in this world.</HI> He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. <HI>David</HI> speaking in the Person, and as a Type of Christ, saith, <HI>Thou hast shewed me great and sore troubles,</HI> Psal. 71.20. And again, <HI>Psal.</HI> 25.17. <HI>The troubles of my heart are inlarged, O bring thou me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut of my distresses.</HI> Therefore Believers must undergo troubles and distresses also: for God hath predestinated them to be <HI>conformed to the image of his Son,</HI> Rom. 8.29. that is, not onely in respect of grace, or of glory, but in respect of suf∣ferings, for of them is the Apostle discoursing in that Context. Should not the Members be like the Head? shall we be Mon∣sters in the Mystical Body of Christ? Truly, if we should meet with no troubles in the world, we should rather be Mon∣sters then Members in the Mystical Body of Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Verity and Veracity of God proveth the truth of this.</HI> The Lord hath said, <HI>In the world you shall have tribulation,</HI> Joh. 26.33. But if Christians should live and die, and never meet with any troubles, how should those words be true? More∣over, God hath Covenanted with his people, that sanctified afflictions shall be their portion, if need be, <HI>Psal.</HI> 89.32. The Lord hath put it into the Indenture which he hath made with his Servants, that they shall have Physick as well as Food: now afflictions are Physick for the Soul. There are Covenant-afflictions, as well as Covenant-mercies: yea, all the affli∣ctions which befall the Lords faithful Servants, are ordered
<PB N="5" REF="000192_0008_0FA317258633D460"/>
according to the Covenant of Grace, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.5. Hence when God entred into Covenant with <HI>Abraham,</HI> there was an appearance of great darkness, <HI>Gen.</HI> 15.17. signifying, that all dark dispensations of Providence are ordered by a gracious Covenant.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Instruments, and immediate Causes of trouble to the Church, have ever been.</HI> Causes of trouble there are both within and without. <HI>Within,</HI> there is sin and corruptions in the hearts of the best; and it will be vain to expect that the Saints shall be freed from all suffering, untill such time as they are freed from sin. <HI>Without,</HI> there is Satan to raise storms of affliction. Indeed if the Devil were cast into the bottomless Pit, and shut up there, we might think that there would be less trouble in the world: But we know, that as yet though he be a Prisoner, yet he is a Prisoner at large, he hath a long Chain given him, and goeth with it ranging and raging up and down the world, and maketh it his great design to raise Persecutions against the Church. Also Instruments of Perse∣cution in the hands of Satan have ever been: There was the <HI>Egyptian,</HI> and the <HI>Babylonian,</HI> and the <HI>Grecian,</HI> of old: And in these dayes of the New-Testament, first the Heathen Em∣perours persecuted the Church ten times. They were no sooner gone, but the <HI>Arrians</HI> arose, and persecuted worse then ever professed Pagans had done before them, so that the Church was in great danger of being swallowed up with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.15. And by that time the <HI>Arrians</HI> were down, Antichrist got up, who hath persecuted more then all that ever were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him. <HI>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus,</HI> were all but Types of Antichrist. Wherefore, as long as there is a Devil out of Hell, or a Pope in <HI>Rome,</HI> we may be sure that there will be dayes of trouble to the Church of God.</P>
<P>But <HI>what troubles are they, which the Saints are here subject to?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> That's the second thing propounded to be spoken to. And in general, it is true, that <HI>Christians are in this life exposed to all manner of Miseries.</HI> This we may see in that <HI>little Book of Martyrs,</HI> as it is wont to be called, <HI>viz.</HI> the 11th Chapter to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There are inward spiritual troubles,</HI> Soul-troubles, which Believers may be afflicted with: They may be molested with Satans temptations, the best Saint upon earth may so, as <HI>Paul</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="000192_0009_0FA3172646DE7410"/>
was, which caused him to pour forth many a bitter and bleed∣ing complaint into the bosome of the Lord Jesus, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.8. <HI>He besought the Lord thrice,</HI> that is, many a time. A true childe of God may also be under divine desertion: hence the Church said, <HI>The Comforter which should relieve my soul is far from me, Lam.</HI> 1.16. God may hide his face from his dearest Servants sometimes, and those are troubles indeed, <HI>Psal.</HI> 30.7. <HI>Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.</HI> But these are not the troubles which the text speaketh of, and therefore I will not insist there.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There are outward troubles</HI>; e. g. sufferings as to losses and crosses respecting a mans outward worldly Estate. This is partly meant in the Text, <HI>A day of trouble is near,</HI> that is, a day wherein all mens Estates shall go to wrack and ruine. Hence <HI>ver.</HI> 12. it is said, <HI>Let not the buyer rejoyce, nor the seller mourn</HI>▪ why? because he should not have kept his Estate long, though he had not sold it, inasmuch as Enemies were at hand to take it away. Again, troubles upon the Body in re∣spect of Sicknesses, Mortalities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are here intended: where∣fore in <HI>ver.</HI> 15. <HI>the Pestilence</HI> is mentioned. Some have made a question of it, Whether a godly man may be sick of <HI>the Plague?</HI> A needless question. It is generally conceived that <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was sick of that disease: and some Interpreters on <HI>Psal.</HI> 38.11. think that <HI>David</HI> was visited with that <HI>stroke.</HI> And the like is apprehended concerning <HI>Lazarus.</HI> In <HI>Cyprians</HI> time there were many thousands of godly men and women that died of that disease. It should seem, that the believing <HI>Corinthians,</HI> many of them were sick, and some died of the Pestilence. We should be very uncharitable, did we conclude, that all those that died of the Plague, in that day of trouble and mortality which the Text speaketh of▪ perished eternally. And the like may be said with respect to those Seventy thou∣sand that were swept away when <HI>David</HI> numbred the people. Again, when Wars arise, it is <HI>a day of trouble:</HI> that is here meant in a special manner. Hence some render the words, A day of <HI>Tumult</HI> is near,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Polanus, Pisca∣tor,</HI> and <HI>Lava∣ter.</HI></NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> in respect of confused noise, and garments rolled in blood. This may well be called a day of trouble, because <HI>War</HI> is the greatest of all outward Judge∣ments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Arrow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ths</HI> Sermon on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 26 25. p 7.</NOTE> and thence is by way of eminency termed <HI>Evil,</HI> Isa. 45.7. <HI>I create evil,</HI> that is, War: those words relating to <HI>Cyrus</HI> his Expedition against <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000192_0010_0FA3172708735C50"/>We come then to the third thing propounded, namely, <HI>What are the Signs of a day of trouble being near?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> There are <HI>Signs of the Times,</HI> whereby whoso is wise, and doth observe these things, may discern when a day of trouble is near. It was a sad complaint which the Lord took up against his people of old, saying, <HI>The Stork i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the heaven knoweth her appointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow, observe the time of their coming, but my people know not the judgement of the Lord,</HI> Jer. 8.7. These Creatures could tell when Winter was at hand, but there was a Winter coming upon the Jews, even <HI>Iudgement of the Lord</HI> was at hand, and yet they knew it not. Christ also doth blame the Pharisees for not <HI>discerning the signs of the times,</HI> Mat. 16.3. Look as God hath stretched the Firmament over this natural World, and hath placed the Stars there, to be for signs as to Natural Events in the ordinary course of Providence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ Epistle Dedic. in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> so hath he stretched out the <HI>Expansum</HI> of his Word over the Ratio∣nal World, and therein set his Statutes and his Judgements, from whence the wise-hearted may conjecture what is like to come to pass. Now I have nothing curious or critical to present you with, onely a few plain Scripture Truths.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The abounding of Iniquity is a sign that the day of trouble is near.</HI> Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ speaking of the signs fore-running that day of Calamity which then was coming upon <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> saith, <HI>Iniquity shall abound,</HI> Mat. 24.12. If Iniquity do abound amongst those that are the professed Enemies of God, and of his People, that's <HI>a sign</HI> that their day is near, and that the things which shall come upon them do make haste, <HI>Ioel</HI> 3.13. <HI>Their wickedness is great</HI>; and then it followeth in the next Verse, <HI>The day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.</HI> So we see in <HI>Sodom,</HI> wickedness was grown to a marvellous height there, and then on a sudden the fatal <HI>Morning came</HI> upon them. If strange Prodigious Wickednesses are breaking forth, that's a sign that strange Punishments are at hand: but especially if it be thus amongst a Professing People Hence it's said concerning the old world, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.12. <HI>God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all flesh,</HI> even the Sons of God and all, <HI>had corrupted his way upon the earth:</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> followeth, <HI>ver.</HI> 13. <HI>The end of all fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh is come,</HI> even such <HI>an end,</HI> as that which the Prophet speak∣eth of in this Chapter.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="000192_0011_0FA31727C61B1858"/>2. <HI>Great Security is a sign that trouble is near.</HI> This we see, if we look no further then the Text, <HI>The morning is come:</HI> As if it were said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> You are asleep in your sins▪ but there's that at hand that will awaken you; you thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k it is not midnight, but that you may sleep on securely still, but it's morning. So in <HI>ver.</HI> 6. <HI>It watcheth for thee</HI>; q. d. you are asleep, and you think that Judgement is slumbering too, when-as it's waiting ready to take hold on you. <HI>Zephaniah</HI> speaketh of the same day of trouble, with this in the Text, and stupendious <HI>Security</HI> is mentioned as a fore-running sign thereof, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 1.12▪13. <HI>I will search Ierusalem with candles, and punish the men that are setled on their lees, that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</HI> Wonderful Security! <HI>Therefore their goods shall become a bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, and their houses a desolation▪</HI> And what followeth? <HI>The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and hasteth greatly; that day is a day of trouble, and di∣stress, a day of the Trumpet, and alarm against the fenced Cities.</HI> Look as before the day of <HI>general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udgement,</HI> there will be great Security amongst men on the earth, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 5.3. <HI>For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with childe, and they shall not escape.</HI> So it is wont to be as to <HI>lesser dayes of Iudge∣ment,</HI> which may come upon particular persons or places: How hath the doleful Experience of all Ages proved this? Thus if we look back into the old World, they were minding little besides their sensual pleasures, untill the very day when the Flood came, And they of <HI>Sodom</HI> were strangely secure, when trouble was near unto them: when <HI>Lot</HI> preached to them, that r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine was at hand, <HI>He seemed as one that mocked, to his sons in law,</HI> they could hardly believe that he was in good earnest. There's a Jest indeed (say they) shall fire come from Heaven and destroy us? they thought <HI>Lot</HI> had dreamed of a dry Summer. And the like do we see in <HI>Laish,</HI> Judg. 18.27. they were <HI>a people at quiet, and secure,</HI> and now were the <HI>Dani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> at hand, to <HI>smite with the edge of the sword, and to burn the City with fire.</HI> So in <HI>Babylon</HI>; we reade, <HI>Dan.</HI> 5.1. that <HI>Belshazzar the King made a great Feast to a thousand of his Lords, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rank wine before them.</HI> A wonderful Security, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a season he should minde his Kingdome no more, for at this very time the City was besieged with Enemies. But the
<PB N="9" REF="000192_0012_0FA31728894BE200"/>
<HI>Caldeans</HI> thought with themselves, they had the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and a triple Wall belonging to the City to secure them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> and also twenty years Provision wherewith they were stored, so that they laughed at <HI>Cyrus</HI> his Expedition against them: well but, <HI>that very night was Belshazzar the King of the Caldeans slain, and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rius the Median took the Kingdome.</HI> And the like is to be said concerning <HI>Mystical Babylon</HI>; at that very time when <HI>Rome</HI> shall say in her heart, <HI>I see no sorrow,</HI> her plagues shall come in one day, and she shall be utterly burnt with fire.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, 3. <HI>Secret dismal Fears upon the Spirits of men, are sometimes a sign that a day of trouble is near.</HI> So it was in the day of <HI>Midian,</HI> the Lord sent a <HI>Panick Terrour</HI> amongst the <HI>Mi∣dianites,</HI> which was a sign of the day of Tumult in the Host of <HI>Midian.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> This some take to be meant by <HI>the Hornet</HI> (though I be∣lieve that was literally fulfilled) spoken of <HI>Deut.</HI> 7.20. <HI>Austine,</HI> and some others, understand it Spiritually, namely, that the Lord sent <HI>stinging fears</HI> into the hearts of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> as a sign that they should be dispossessed of their Land. However, it is certain that such Fears there were, and that they were ominous. Therefore <HI>Rahab</HI> said unto the Spies, <HI>Iosh.</HI> 2 9. <HI>I know the Lord hath given you the Land, and that your terrour is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the Land faint because of you.</HI> And again, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. <HI>As soon as we heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you.</HI> The Lord is wont to cause such fears to come upon men, that so they may be left without excuse if they do not prepare for <HI>the day of trouble.</HI> Hence then, when every mans hands are upon his loins, and all faces are gathering paleness, it is an ominous sign. This is mentioned as a sign fore-going the troubles of the last times, <HI>Luke</HI> 21.26. <HI>Mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.</HI> Look as a Spirit of Courage is a good sign, yea an evident token of salvation, and that of God▪ so on the other hand, a Spirit of Cowardize and servile fear is an ill sign. Thus it was at last with those my Text hath immediate reference unto, in the 14th Verse of this Cha∣pter it is said, <HI>They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready, but none goeth to the battel.</HI> They would go to Pressing of Souldi∣ers, and make a great stir, as if they would do some great mat∣ter against the Enemy, but when it came to, <HI>none go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th to the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tel,</HI> their Courage failed them· this was an ominous sign.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="10" REF="000192_0013_0FA3172947B1AA60"/>4. <HI>When God begins to depart, that's a sign that trouble is near.</HI> For the Lord is <HI>a Sun and a Shield</HI> to his people, <HI>Psal.</HI> 84.11. When a mans Shield is gone, what can he expect but blows? And when the Sun is gone, darkness followeth; so if the Lord depart, troubles and miseries must needs follow. And if God once begin to forsake a people, many times when he begins, he mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h an end also. We see in these following Chapters in <HI>Eze∣kiel,</HI> when the glory of the Lord began to remove, it went fur∣ther and further, untill at last there was a total departure there∣of. In which respect, if our glory begin to remove, it is very sad and ominous: If God be at the threshold, trouble is at the door. Hence, when the signs of the Lords Presence are taken away, it argueth that a day of trouble is coming on apace. <HI>Vnity,</HI> is a sign of the Lords Presence; <HI>Live in peace, and the God of Love and Peace shall be with you.</HI> Hence breaches and divisions, inasmuch as they are an evidence of the Lords departure from a people, are a sign of miseries at hand. So again, Ordinances, Civil, but especially Sacred Ordinances, when administred ac∣cording to the minde of Christ, are tokens of the Lords graci∣ous Presence in the midst of his people. Therefore when the Lord removeth these, or the Instruments of upholding and managing these, for the edification of his people, it is a sad sign. Hence also, lesser Judgements are signs of greater troubles at hand, because they are arguments of the Lords beginning to forsake such places where those Judgements take effect. Thus we finde in the fourth Chapter of <HI>Amos,</HI> that <HI>Droughts, and Blastings, and Mildews,</HI> &amp;c. are signs that <HI>the morning shall be made darkness.</HI> Yea, bad Harvests are sometimes a sign, that a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of great trouble is at hand; <HI>Ioel</HI> 1.15. <HI>Alas for the day, for the day of the Lord is at hand:</HI> How doth that appear? ver. 16, 17. <HI>Is not the meat cut off before our eyes— The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the Corn is wi∣thered.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>When God s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irs up the Spirits of his Messengers to sound the Trumpet, and to cry an Alarm against his people, that's a sign that the day of trouble is near.</HI> Mica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 6.9. <HI>The Lords voice cri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th to the City</HI>; that is to say, the Trumpet of the Word is sounded to give the Alarm, but if that Voice be not regarded, then <HI>Hear the Rod,</HI> Judgements follow: <HI>Son of man</HI> (saith the Lord to <HI>Ezekiel) speak to the children of thy people, and say unto
<PB N="11" REF="000192_0014_0FA3172A05FFCC10"/>
them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asts, and set him for their watchman, if when he seeth the sword come upon the land, and he blow the trum∣pet, and warn the people, then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head,</HI> Ezek. 33.2, 3, 4. So then, if Gods <HI>Ezekiels</HI> sound the Trumpet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's a fair warning that the sword is coming: For is it not said, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.7. <HI>Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to his Servants the Prophets?</HI> God by a secret Providence is wont to move upon the hearts of his faithful Servants, that they should speak accord∣ing to what is in the Lords heart to do. Therefore ever observe it, (for it is an Observation that is not wont to fail) That if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lords Watchmen do with one voice cry, <HI>The day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the Mountains,</HI> it is so indeed. Men may sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght this <HI>Sign,</HI> as the <HI>Edomites</HI> did; but believe it, it is a dangerous thing so to do, as we see, <HI>Isa.</HI> 21.11. <HI>Watchman, what of the night? watchman, what of the night?</HI> O say they, you have been Preaching to us these several years, that there is a night coming upon us, but we see no such thing. <HI>The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night:</HI> Albeit at present you have a morning, you are in a prosperous state, yet a night of mi∣sery is nearer to you, then you are aware of.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>When the Lord doth mingle a perverse spirit amongst a people, it is a sign that the day of trouble is near.</HI> This we may see men∣tioned as the fore-runner of <HI>Egypts</HI> ruine, <HI>Isa.</HI> 19.14. <HI>The Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof.</HI> When men are resolved to oppose and thwart one another whatever come of it; that a man will not be for such a thing, onely because such an one is for it; and he will be sure to oppose such a Motion, onely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣cause such an one, whom he is resolved to contradict, pleads for it: this is a <HI>perverse spirit.</HI> Hence when there are <HI>Prevailing Factions</HI> amongst a people, it is an ominous sign: So it was in <HI>Ie∣rusalem</HI> before their last destruction. <HI>The love of many was grown cold.</HI> There were (as Historians have noted) very great Factions amongst the <HI>Iews,</HI> when the <HI>Romans</HI> came against them: Some Interpreters think, that this is hinted at <HI>Zech.</HI> 11.8. <HI>Three Shep∣herds I cut off in one moneth:</HI> Those <HI>three Shepherds</HI> are thought to intend those three great Heads of Factions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> the <HI>Pha∣risees, Sadducees,</HI> and <HI>Esseans,</HI> into which the <HI>Iews</HI> were divided.
<PB N="12" REF="000192_0015_0FA3172AC6A66868"/>
Hence also, <HI>divided Counsels</HI> are signs that bode no good to such a people. When one shall be violent for this, and another shall be as strong and resolute against it; this is wont to be the <HI>Iudi∣cial Effect</HI> of the Lords <HI>mingling a perverse spirit:</HI> for then he doth <HI>set the Egyptians against the Egyptians,</HI> Isa. 19.2. This we see, <HI>Psal.</HI> 55.9. <HI>Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues.</HI> Accord¦ing to that Prayer of <HI>David, Absoloms</HI> Counsellors were divided, which proved the ruine of that party.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>When glorious Promises are near unto their birth, we may con∣clude that a day of trouble is also near.</HI> Zech. 14.7. <HI>At evening time it shall be light.</HI> If light be ready to break forth, we may well conjecture that a dark evening will go before it. Naturalists observe, that a little before break of day, is the darkest time of all the night; so when the day break of any eminent Mercy to the Church is at hand, dark and dismal dispensations are wont immediately to procede: it hath ever been so. A little before the children of <HI>Israel</HI> were brought out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> they were in the saddest condition that could be. <HI>David,</HI> a little before <HI>Sauls</HI> death, whereby way was made for <HI>Davids</HI> enlargement and advance∣ment, was in the greatest distress that ever he was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in all his life, namely, when <HI>Ziklag</HI> was burnt, and his own friends spake of stoning him. And in the Primitive Times, the last of the Ten Pagan Persecutions, was the bloodiest of all, <HI>viz.</HI> that under <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> who made full account that he had utterly destroyed the <HI>Christian Name,</HI> and therefore would have Pillars erected in divers places, as Monuments of his Victory over Christ, as he vainly imagined, and caused to be written on divers of them, <HI>Christi Superstitione deletâ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Anno <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>04.</NOTE> that the <HI>Superstition of Christ</HI> (as he blasphemously called the Christian Religion) <HI>was abolished out of the world.</HI> Now when things were come to this extremity, God raised up <HI>Constantine,</HI> the Great Christian Emperour, according to that Prophesie, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12 5. <HI>The woman,</HI> i. e. the Church, <HI>brought forth a man childe, who was to Rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron,</HI> (that is, a Scepter, for in old Times Scepters were Rods of Iron) <HI>and her childe was caught up unto God, and to his throne</HI>: But be∣fore this em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nent Mercy to the Church, and the happy Times which followed, when those in Authority were none but Chri∣stians, the Church <HI>cried, travailing in birth.</HI> So then, if glorious things be coming to their birth, <HI>cries and travailing pains</HI> must go before deliverance can be expected. In these dayes into which
<PB N="13" REF="000192_0016_0FA3172B85BC0098"/>
we are fallen, before the Witnesses do ascend into Heaven, the Beast which ascends out of the Bottomless Pit shall make War against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. This is the usual method of divine Providence, to bring light out of darkness, by the greatest Miseries to prepare for the greatest Mercies.</P>
<P>We come now unto the fourth thing propounded,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sermon</HI> II. P.M.</NOTE> in order to the clearing of the Truth before us, <HI>viz.</HI> To enquire into the <HI>Reasons</HI> of this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> whence is it that the Lord doth some∣times bring dayes of great trouble upon his own people? <HI>Ans.</HI> The Reasons may be referred unto two Heads:</P>
<P N="1">1. The Lord doth this with respect unto Himself.</P>
<P N="2">2. With respect unto his people. As indeed all the Provi∣dences of God, all that he doth in the world, may be referred un∣to those two Heads, the Lord therein aimeth at his own glory, and his peoples good.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Lord hath respect unto Himself, in those troubles which come upon the Church.</HI> Hereby his Faithfulness is manifested and glorified: therefore <HI>David</HI> saith, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.75▪ <HI>I know, O Lord, that thy judgements are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast af∣flicted me.</HI> The Lord sheweth his great Faithfulness as to the time, the kinde, the measure, the manner, the duration of what∣ever afflictions may befall any of his faithful Servants. And his Power also is hereby discovered: it is a glorious evidence of the wonderful Power of God, that the Church should be upheld and preserved in the world, notwithstanding the troubles and miseries thereof. The Church's being continued in the world, is one of the great Wonders of divine Providence, wherein the mighty Power of God is seen. It is said, that the children of <HI>Israel</HI> were <HI>like two little flocks of Kids</HI> before the <HI>Syrians,</HI> 1 Kings 20.27. Should we see a little flock of Kids, or of Sheep, in the midst of Wolves and devourers, and yet not destroyed, we should say, The singer of God is here. Truly thus it is: The Church is <HI>a little-little flock</HI> of Sheep, and that in the midst of thousands of Wolves and Tygers, yet this flock is saved alive▪ so then the Power of God is seen and glorified. <HI>Moses</HI> did sometimes marvel at this thing, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3.2▪ 3. <HI>And he looked, and behold the Bush burned with fire, and the Bush was not consumed; and Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the Bush is not burnt.</HI> The
<PB N="14" REF="000192_0017_0FA3172C4763F3D8"/>
children of <HI>Israel</HI> were the Bush that was all on fire, in respect of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Persecution, which then they were under; but the Lord by a mighty hand of Providence upheld them, so that the fire did not consume them. Moreover, the Saints are wont to glorifie God more in a day of trouble, then at other times: <HI>Isa.</HI> 24.15. <HI>Glorifie ye the Lord in the fires</HI>▪ so are the Saints wont to do, when in the fires of affliction, they bring more glory to God, it may be in one day, then in many years of prosperity. How was the Name of Christ advanced, and his Interest promoted in the world in the Primitive Times? and the reason was, because those were times of great Suffering. Hence then the Lord brings such times upon his people.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God brings dayes of trouble with respect to his people.</HI> And that especially on a fourfold account. 1. For their Probation. 2. For their Instruction. 3. For their Correction. 4. In or∣der to their Purgation.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Lord aimeth at the Probation of his people,</HI> in those troubles which befall them in the world. Hence <HI>Ezek.</HI> 21.13. the Prophet there speaking of the same day of trouble which the Text hath reference unto, saith, <HI>Because it is a triall,</HI> &amp;c. So <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.10. <HI>Fear none of those things thou shalt suffer; behold, the Devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be Tried.</HI> Hence the afflictions of Gods children are compared to a refining Furnace, or to a calcining Pot, wherein Metals are <HI>Tried,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.7. <HI>The triall of your Faith,</HI> &amp;c. The Greek word (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) signifi∣eth a Furnace wherein Goldsmiths try Metals; even so the Lord by afflictions Trieth what Metal men are made of, whether they be Gold or Dross, whether they be Silver, or Lead onely. The Faith and Patience of his Servants are hereby put to the Trial: therefore <HI>Iohn</HI> speaking concerning the troubles which should come upon the Church under Antichrist, saith, <HI>Here is the Pati∣ence and Faith of the Saints,</HI> Rev. 13.10. that is to say, by these troubles it is exercised and manifested. By this means the Lord Trieth the sincerity and fidelity of his Servants; yea, and what measure of grace they have too. If they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint in the day of ad∣versity, their strength is small; but they that hold out faithfully and couragiously in times of great trouble, have received a good measure of grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lord by bringing dayes of trouble upon his Servants, aimeth at their Instruction.</HI> Psal. 94.12. <HI>Blessed is the man whom
<PB N="15" REF="000192_0018_0FA3172D07BC7BE8"/>
thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy Law.</HI> There∣fore doth the Lord bring his precious ones under chastening di∣spensations of Provid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce sometimes, that so he may Teach them; yea, and many a blessed lesson doth he teach them thereby. Af∣fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cting times are not only Trying times, but also Teaching times: <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. <HI>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.</HI> Hereby the children of God <HI>learn,</HI> yea they <HI>learn</HI> to know more of God, and of themselves too: as we see in <HI>Iob,</HI> who after his troubles could say, <HI>Mine eye seeth thee</HI>; and, <HI>I abhor my self in dust and ashes.</HI> By afflictions, men are taught to know that God is God, and that sin is sin. Ever since that day of trouble which the Text speaketh of, the Jews have dreaded that sin which was the principal Cause of all their mi∣series.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Lord in afflicting his people, aimeth at their Correction.</HI> Hence affliction is called a Rod, <HI>Ezek,</HI> 21, 10. <HI>It is the Rod of my son, contemning every tree. Israel</HI> was Gods son, as the Lord said to <HI>Pharaoh, Israel is my son▪ my first-born</HI>; now the <HI>Caldeans</HI> were a Rod, whereby God scourged that son of his. It is true, that personal afflictions oftentimes come onely or chiefly in a way of Trial, but publick Calamities are wont to come as Corrections and just Punishments for sin: <HI>Ier.</HI> 30.15. <HI>Why criest thou for thine affliction? for the multitude of thine iniquities, because thy sins were increased, have I done these things unto thee.</HI> And to the like purpose doth the Lord speak by the Prophet <HI>Micah,</HI> Chap. 1. ver. 5. <HI>For the transgression of Iacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. But you will say, What sins are they for which God is wont to bring dayes of trouble upon his people?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> We shall here take notice onely of such sins as are men∣tioned in this Context, as the Procuring Cause of that day of Ca∣lamity here threatned. And they are three:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>The not ordering matters aright, respecting the Worship of God,</HI> was the principal Crime which brought this trouble. Ido∣latry was the sin, that at this time above others, troubled <HI>Israel.</HI> Hence it is said, <HI>ver.</HI> 3, 4. <HI>I will recompence upon thee all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hine abomi∣nations</HI>; h.e. I will punish you for your Idols: for usually in the Scripture, <HI>Idols</HI> are called <HI>Abominations.</HI> It is said, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.27. <HI>He that maketh an abomination,</HI> that is, he that maketh an Idol, shall not enter into the Heavenly <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> That sin of corrupting the
<PB N="16" REF="000192_0019_0FA3172DC60F29A8"/>
Worship of God, hath been the grand Procuring Cause of those astonishing and desolating Plagues that have come upon the earth. If men worship a false God, their sorrows shall be multiplied; or if they worship the true God in false Wayes, by means which he never appointed, and which never came into his heart, that's a sin that procureth great wrath. If men shall adde unto what the Lord hath commanded, and so corrupt his pure Worship with their own devices, vengeance will come for it: <HI>Psal.</HI> 99.8. <HI>Thou tookest vengeance of their inventions</HI>; Hos. 11.6. <HI>The Sword shall abide on his Cities, because of their own counsels</HI>; that is to say, be∣cause they corrupted the Worship of God with inventions of their own. So on the other hand, if there be a <HI>taking from</HI> the Word of God, in matters referring to his Worship, dayes of trouble will come. In case Churches shall not come up fully to practice the Institutions of Christ, and to stand perfect and com∣pleat in all the will of God, the Lord will punish them for their neglects; as we see in the Jewish Church, who met with sore troubles after the return from Captivity, and the reason of it was, because they did not carry on Temple-work to that perfection which should have been, <HI>Hag.</HI> 1.4. Yea moreover, if men grow careless as to the manner of their worshipping God, (though Object and Means should be according to his Will) the Lord will visit for that iniquity. When the <HI>Corinthians</HI> were not duely care∣ful as to the manner of worshipping, <HI>for this cause many were weak and sick amongst them,</HI> 1 Cor. 11.30. It is (as was hinted but now) conceived by some Expositors, that the Lord sent the Plague amongst them, for that sin. We reade in <HI>Ez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kiel,</HI> that <HI>fire was taken from between the Cherubims,</HI> i. e. from off the Incense-Altar, <HI>and scattered over the City,</HI> Chap. 10.2. Why? to signifie that here was the cause wherefore the City was burnt, it was the Lords Controversie respecting his Altar, his Worship that is, which brought that famous City into ruinous heaps. So again, <HI>Isai.</HI> 29.1. it is there said, <HI>Wo to Ariel, to Ariel the City where David dwelt. Ariel</HI> signifieth the Lion of God, and may intend the Altar, which like a Lion did devour the Sacrifices offered thereon: here then was the true Cause of that <HI>Wo</HI> which befell that City and Nation, in that matters respecting <HI>Ariel,</HI> even the Altar and Worship of God, were not as should have been. Look as when things are managed aright as to Divine Worship, great prosperi∣ty is wont to follow, <HI>Ezra</HI> 3.3. <HI>They set the Altar upon his Bases,
<PB N="17" REF="000192_0020_0FA3172E88493F10"/>
for fear was upon them, because of the people of those Countreys:</HI> They knew that that was the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to engage the Lord to be with them, and to defend them against their Enemies, even to set the Altar upon his right Bases; so the contrary is to be affirmed, when the Altar is not set upon his Bases, great troubles are then like to come.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>Pride is another sin</HI> here mentioned, as the Cause of this day of trouble: ver. 10. <HI>Behold the day, behold it is come, the morn∣ing is gone forth, the Rod hath blossomed, Pride hath budded:</HI> The buddings of Pride, do cause the Rod to blossome against a people. Hence the morning, even the fatall day came upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> Ezek. 16.49. <HI>This was the iniquity of Sodom, Pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of Idleness.</HI> Pride is mentioned in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first place, be∣cause that indeed was the first firebrand which set <HI>Sodom</HI> on fire. It was for that sin in special, that those Proud Cities were brought down into ashes.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>Oppression is another Evil</HI> mentioned, as the Procuring Cause of this trouble, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. <HI>Violence is risen up into a Rod of wic∣kedness.</HI> Violence, Oppression that is, brought the wicked <HI>Cal∣deans</HI> upon the <HI>Iews.</HI> There seems to be a marvellous Elegancy in the Prophets words: The <HI>Tribe</HI> (the same Hebrew word signi∣fieth a Rod, and a Tribe) of <HI>Iudah</HI> is compared unto a <HI>Rod</HI>; now what were the Buds that grew upon this Rod? even Pride and Oppression: therefore did the day of trouble draw near. Thus we see the Lord brings troubles upon his people, that so he may correct them for their sins.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>God herein also aimeth at their Purgation.</HI> So is it said con∣cerning the day of trouble that was inflicted on the Church by the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> Isa. 27.9. <HI>By this shall the iniquity of Iacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin.</HI> And concerning the troubles under <HI>Antiochus,</HI> of which <HI>Daniel</HI> speaketh, <HI>Chap.</HI> 11.35. <HI>Some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white.</HI> To the same purpose is that, <HI>Zech.</HI> 13.9. <HI>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will re∣fine them as silver is refined,</HI> &amp;c. So then, that which the Lord in∣tends by bringing his people into the Furnace of Affliction, is that he may make pure Metal of them, yea, that they may be purged and sanctified, and become vessels meet for their Masters use.</P>

Silah.</HI> Truly thus it is at this day, the multitude of many people make a noise like the noise of the seas: we have heard the rushing of the Nations; yea, we have heard the sea and the waves thereof roaring. What roarings have there been on the sea, in these late dayes? and the Mountains begin to shake with the swelling thereof. Kingdoms shake, Nations shake, yet let us not be dismayed, for the Lord will carry on his own good work and glorious designs, in the midst of these troubles. It is said, <HI>Deut.</HI> 9.25. that the City should be <HI>built in troublous times:</HI> The Lord is carrying on the building of his own House even in these troublous times. And why should we be dismayed▪ for all these Affairs are ordered and managed by the hand of him that is our Mediator. Therefore in <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Vision of the Wheel, that is, the Wheel of Providence, it is indeed said, that the <HI>rings were high and dreadful,</HI> Chap. 1. ver. 18. but it is said, <HI>ver.</HI> 26. <HI>There is a Man above upon the Throne,</HI> that is to say, Jesus Christ, who is Man as well as God, even He as Mediator doth order all the Af∣fairs and Motions of that Wheel of Providence, which is matter of wonderful encouragement, when the Revolutions thereof are dreadful for us to behold. Christ is become Head of all things to his Church; All power in Heaven and in Earth is given to him, that so he might manage all things, so as shall be for the good of his Church, as well as for his Fathers glory. And therefore though troubles come, why should we be dismayed thereat? yea, why should we be dismayed thereat? for a glorious issue and happy deliverance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of all these troubles, shall certainly arise to the Church in du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time: <HI>Ier.</HI> 30.7. <HI>It is even the time of Iacobs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saved out of it.</HI></P>

To this purpose doth the Prophet speak unto <HI>Moab,</HI> Jer. 49.12. <HI>Behold, they whose judgement was not to drink of the Cup, have assuredly drunken, and art thou he that shalt altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.</HI> Jewish Expositors (and that not altogether without reason) when <HI>Moab</HI> is spoken of in the Scripture, are wont to apply it unto <HI>Rome</HI>: for indeed the <HI>Moabites</HI> were Types of the present <HI>Antichristian generation.</HI> Why, behold at this day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey whose Judgement it was not to drink of the Cup, have as∣suredly drunk thereof; the Lord we see hath begun with <HI>Prote∣stant Nations,</HI> and hath made them to drink deep of the Cup of his indignation, in this day wherein he is giving of the Cup to the Nations round, beginning at <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> And art thou he, O <HI>Moab?</HI> Art thou he, O <HI>Roman Antichrist,</HI> that shalt escape? thou shalt not escape, but shalt certainly drink thereof▪ yea drink there∣of untill thou spue, and fall, and rise no more.</P>
<P>And this we see is the use which the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> maketh of this Doctrine, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.17, 18. <HI>For the time is come that judgement must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel of God?

The Seventh Trumpet (which is the last of the Wo-Trumpets) will sound quickly; and the <HI>Woes</HI> thereof will light upon the Heads of the Antichristian Party in the world.

This might also be applied unto every un∣godly sinner: All you that continue in your sins, <HI>what will your end be?</HI> Troubles may come upon the Lords people, but they shall soon be over: but as for thee, if thou diest in thy sins, with∣out Repentance, and without an interest in Jesus Christ by Faith unfeigned in his Name, thy sorrows shall never have an end.</P>
<P><HI>VSE</HI> III. If God doth sometimes bring dayes of trouble upon his own people, here then is matter of solemn Awakening unto us; <HI>It concerns us well to consider, whether there be not a day of trouble near unto us.</HI> For Awakening here, I shall mention some
<PB N="20" REF="000192_0023_0FA317310DD32388"/>
things, which look awfully upon us. Some <HI>Arguments</HI> let us here take notice of, which seem to speak as if <HI>a day of trouble</HI> were <HI>near unto us,</HI> yea and <HI>not the sounding again of the Mountains.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. (To begin with that which is most general) <HI>There is a day of trouble coming upon all the World</HI>; and such trouble too, as the like hath not been: for I am perswaded that Scripture is yet to be ful∣filled, even that <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.1. where it is said, <HI>There shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a Nation, to that same time.</HI> We are in expectation of glorious times, wherein Peace and Prosperity shall run down like a River, and like a mighty stream over all the earth; but immediately before those dayes, there will be such horrible Combustions and Confusions, as the like ne∣ver was. It is said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 46.9. <HI>He maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the earth:</HI> but the words immediately foregoing are, <HI>Come, be∣hold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.</HI> Before the dayes come, wherein the Nations shall learn war no more, O what desolations wil the Lord make in the earth? We look that the Church shall be in its <HI>Philadelphian state,</HI> when Enemies shall come and <HI>bow before the feet of Ierusalem,</HI> as Christ speaketh in his Epistle to the Church of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but first there will <HI>an hour of Temptation come upon all the world,</HI> Rev. 3.10. We look that the <HI>Iews</HI> shall be Converted; I know, and am perswaded by the Lord Jesus, that it shall be so in the appointed time. We look that <HI>Chittim</HI> and <HI>Ashur</HI> (that is, <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Turk</HI>) shall perish for ever; but is it not said, <HI>Alas, who shall live when God doth these things?</HI> Numb. 24.23. We know that in <HI>Abrahams</HI> Vision, <HI>when the Sun was going down, an horrour of great darkness fell upon him, Gen.</HI> 15.12. Why so? but to signifie, that when the Sun is going down, even in the end of the World, when Christ is ready to come and set up his Kingdome, and judge the earth, there shall be great horrour of darkness and misery upon the world: Dark∣ness shall then cover the earth, and gross darkness the people.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Our eyes see, and our ears hear of the beginnings of sorrows.</HI> That which Christ spake with immediate reference to the troubles preceding the destruction of the <HI>Iewish</HI> Church and State, may be applied to the troubles of the last times, the former being a Type of the latter, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.6, 7, 8. <HI>And ye shall hear of wars, and rumours of wars, see that you be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet: for Nation shall rise against Nation, and Kingdome against Kingdome, and there shall be Fa∣mines,
<PB N="21" REF="000192_0024_0FA31731881CBC88"/>
and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stilences, and Earthquakes in divers places: All these are the beginnings of sorrows.</HI> What do we hear of at this day, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wars, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umours of Wars? and Nation rising up against Nation, and Kingdome against Kingdome? Now if these are the beginnings of sorrows, what, and where, and when will the end be? There's an over flowing scourge breaking in upon the world, even a Judgement, that will not keep within ordinary banks or bounds, but shall pass over into many Lands. And how far will it go? where will the Tayle of this Storm fall at last, do we think? How if it should fall upon <HI>America?</HI> Will not some drops at least light upon <HI>New-England?</HI> We may speak in the words of the Prophet in my Text, and say, <HI>The morning is come,</HI> The day of trouble begins to dawn upon the world. Alas for this day, it is great, there is none like it. It is then high time for us to awake out of sleep.</P>
<P N="3">3. To come nearer home; <HI>The fatal Strokes which have been amongst us speak ominously.</HI> Is not that a plain Scripture, <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.1. <HI>The righteous is taken away from the evil to come?</HI> The Lord hath been taking away many righteous ones from the midst of us; yea righteous ones, that should have stood in the gap, now when the waters of many Troubles are breaking in upon us, whereby he hath <HI>made a way to his anger,</HI> Psal. 78.50. How many Magistrates, and Ministers especially, hath the Lord bereaved us of? When Kings call home their Ambassadors, it's a sign they will proclaim War. God hath called home many of his Ambassadors of late, and that's a sign that War is determined in Heaven against us. Our Enemies are coming, and our Chariots and our Horsmen are gone. <HI>Ah! poor</HI> New-England, <HI>thy Chariots and thy Horsmen are gone from thee, and now thine Enemies are coming against thee.</HI> And I would not pass by in silence, the observable Providence of God, who hath so ordered, that many Ancient Christians have been taken away of late, as it were together. I have made some En∣quiry about that matter, and finde it to be a general observation, That in many Plantations round about, in one or two years time, a great number of aged Christians have been hid in their graves. The <HI>taking away of the Ancient,</HI> is mentioned as an ominous sign, <HI>Isa.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Methuselah</HI> was the oldest man in the old world, and he died the year before the Flood came. Inasmuch as many of our <HI>Methuselahs</HI> are lately gone, and that so near together, we may fear that a Flood is coming. It's a sign of a Winter at hand, that
<PB N="22" REF="000192_0025_0FA3173246492180"/>
so many aged ones should drop down into the grave together. Nor would I omit here, the sudden Deaths whereby many have been snatched away. When Christ was told of some that were taken away by sudden death, he replied, <HI>I tell you, Nay: except you repent, ye shall all likewise perish,</HI> Luke 13.3. As if the Lord had said, I would have you take these sudden destructions which befall some, as an <HI>Item</HI> unto you, that your Enemies will come and make a general slaughter amongst you, except you do by Repen∣tance prevent it. And in the 4th of <HI>Amos,</HI> it is set down as a sign fore-running a day of great and general trouble, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. <HI>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrow Sodom and Gomor∣rah.</HI> And how did God overthrow <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah?</HI> Was it not with Thunder and Lightning from Heaven? Many amongst us of late years have been so overthrown: yea this year, at least four persons have been so, and sundry of them good men, which maketh the Strokes the mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wful and ominous.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>There are manifold transgressions, and mighty sins amongst us.</HI> And here if I should leave off speaking, and we should all of us joyn together in weeping and lamenting, it would be the best course that could be taken. Brethren, what shall I say? As to <HI>matters of Religion,</HI> things are not as should be. There is a great decay as to the power of godliness amongst us. Professors are many of them of a loose, carnal, ungirt Conversation. We can now see little difference between Church-members and other men, as to their discourses, or their spirits, or their walking, or their garb, but Professors of Religion <HI>fashion themselves accord∣ing to the world.</HI> And what <HI>Pride</HI> is there? Spiritual Pride, in Parts and common Gifts of the Spirit, and in Spiritual Priviledges; yea carnal, shameful, foolish Pride, in Apparel, Fashions, and the like. Whence is all that rising up, and disobedience in Inferiours towards Superiours, in Families in Churches, and in the Common∣wealth, but from the unmortified Pride which is in the hearts of the sons and daughters of men? And is there not Oppression amongst us? Are there no biting Usurers in <HI>New-England?</HI> Are there not those that grinde the faces of the poor? A poor man cometh amongst you, and he must have a Commodity what∣ever it cost him, and you will make him give whatever you please▪ and put what price you please upon what he hath to give too, without respecting the just value of the thing. Verily I am afraid, that the <HI>Oppressing Sword</HI> will come upon us, because of the Op∣pressions
<PB N="23" REF="000192_0026_0FA317330AD6B438"/>
and Extortions which the eyes of the Lords glory have seen amongst us. And are there not <HI>Contentions and Divisions</HI> amongst us? It is in vain for us to go about to palliate this mat∣ter, or to cover this sure, for the shame of our nakedness doth appear, so as that we are become a derision amongst our Enemies. We are divided in our Judgements; and if that were all, the mat∣ter were not much: but we are divided in our Affections, divided in our Prayers, divided in our Counsels: And will not an House divided be brought to desolation? We may say as that blessed <HI>Burroughs</HI> once complained, <HI>We have been so divided,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rroughs</HI> of <HI>Heart-division<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in Epistle to the Reader.</NOTE> <HI>that it is the infinite Mercy of God that our Enemies have not come in at our breaches, and divided all amongst themselves.</HI> Alas! that Gods Diamonds should be cutting one another. I do believe, that one reason why the Lord threatneth to send upon us that Calamity of War at this day, is because of wars and fightings which he hath seen, and been provoked with in the midst of us. If you will needs be fighting (saith God) I'le send those upon you, that shall give you enough of it, <HI>Iam.</HI> 4.1. The Clashings and <HI>Tumults</HI> which have been amongst us, may cause us to fear, that such a <HI>day of Tumult</HI> as the Text speaketh of, is hastening upon us. And what a <HI>woful Worldly spirit</HI> is there in many? Hence God, and Christ, and Heaven, and the Concernments of mens own Souls, are not minded: yea, duties of Communion with the Lord are either totally neglected, or slubbered over. Some don't pray in their Families above once a day: Why? they have not time, they say. Why not? how is your time taken up? Is it in doing publick service for God or for his people? If it were so▪ we must have a care that it be not said to us, <HI>Thou wast made the keeper of the Vineyard, but thy own Vineyard thou hast not kept.</HI> But that's not the reason why men neglect duty; no, it is because they have not time for their worldly occasions. <HI>O this World▪ this World▪</HI> undoeth many a man, that thinks he shall go to Hea∣ven when he dieth. And in this respect our Land is full of Ido∣latry. What is like to come on us? Alas! we have changed our Interest. The Interest of <HI>New-England</HI> was Religion, which did di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nguish us from other <HI>English Plantations,</HI> they were built upon a Worldly design, but we upon a Religious design, when-as now we begin to espouse a Worldly Interest, and so to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w God, therefore no wonder that War is like to be in the gates.

should threaten to punish us with a generation of men that are notorious for that sin of Worldliness, as if the Lord would make us see what our great sin is, in the Instruments of our trouble. <HI>David</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght see by the Instrument of his trouble, what sin it was which God afflicted him for, when <HI>Achitophel,</HI> who was <HI>Bathshebah</HI>'s Grandfather, rose up against him. Truly so may we in the Instruments of our present affliction, reade what our sin hath been. And is there not woful <HI>Covenant-breaking</HI> amongst us? Men when they come into the Church, enter into the so∣lemnest Covenant that can be; They promise in the presence of God, Angels and Saints, that they will watch over one anothers Souls: But how little is that Christian and Brotherly Watchful∣ness attended ever after? Indeed, if men fall out one with ano∣ther, then they can watch for Haltings, and prosecute to the ut∣most, which is to serve themselves, and their own vile lusts and passions, upon Christ and his holy Ordinance; but otherwise, there are too many that can see one another sin, and never attend the Rules of Christ appointed for the healing of every sinning, offending Brother. This is lamentable! And as for the <HI>Chil∣dren of the Covenant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Mr. <HI>Oakes</HI> Sermon on <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut</HI> 32.29. p. 56.</NOTE> as the Scripture calls them, are not they lamentably neglected? Me-thinks it is a very solemn Providence, that the Lord should seem at this day to be <HI>numbering many of the Rising Generation for the Sword</HI>; as if the Lord should say, I will bring a Sword to avenge the quarrel of a <HI>neglected Covenant.</HI> Churches have not so performed Covenant-duties towards their Children, as should have been; and especially, the Rising Gene∣ration have many of them broken the Covenant themselves, in that they do not endeavour to come up to that which their so∣lemn Vow in Baptism doth engage them to before the Lord, even <HI>to know and serve the Lord God of their Fathers.</HI> Yet again, <HI>How unfruitfull have we been under precious Means of Grace?</HI> How hath the Lord been disappointed in his righteous and reason∣able Expectations concerning us? We have not in this our day known the things that do belong unto our peace, and therefore now things look as if the dayes of our peace were ended. It is not long since that Scripture was opened and applied in the hear∣ing of many of you, <HI>Luke</HI> 19.43, 44. <HI>The dayes shall come upon thee, that thine Enemies shall keep thee in on every side, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</HI> How righteous is it, that the Lord should make us to know the difference that is between

More∣over, we have all seen and felt <HI>Blazing Stars, Earthquakes, Pro∣digious Thunders, and Lightnings, and Tempests.</HI> We may here make use of that Scripture, which though it have a spirituall meaning, yet some good Interpreters do not reject a literal sense of the words, <HI>Isa.</HI> 29.6. <HI>And thou shalt be visited of the Lord of Hosts with Thunder, and with Earthquake, and great noise, with storm, and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.</HI> Hath it not been so with us? We have been visited with great noise, and with the
<PB N="26" REF="000192_0029_0FA31735468F3EB8"/>
devouring flame, that is, with terrible Thunders and Lightnings, and with <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> which are often a Prognostick of <HI>State-quakes,</HI> yea and <HI>Heart-quakes,</HI> not far off; and with Storms and Tempests, and that too upon Lords dayes, in a very dismall man∣ner. Now let us not be of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, that regard not the work of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>There is a black Cloud over our heads, which begins to drop upon us.</HI> Providence hath so ordered, that our Enemies are come near, and may we not then think that trouble is near? The Lord hath been wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his glittering Sword a long time; we have heard a noise, and a dismall din hath been in our ears, but now the Sword seems to be facing and marching directly towards us: yea, we see <HI>Ierusalem</HI> compassed about with Enemies. Christ said unto his D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sciples, <HI>Luke</HI> 21.20. <HI>When ye shall see Ierusalem compassed with Enemies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.</HI> Is not our <HI>Ierusalem</HI> compassed with Armies? There are pre∣tended Friends at our backs, and professed Enemies before our fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. The sky looketh red and lowring, we may therefore fear, that foul Weather is at hand: As once that Prophet said, There is a sound of an abundance of Rain, and in the mean-while, <HI>the Heaven was black with Clouds.</HI> Truly so it is at this day, the Heavens are black over our heads. The Clouds begin to gather thick in our Horizon: yea, there is a Cloud of Blood, which be∣gins to drop upon us. When once a Cloud begins to drop, you know that a Shower is wont to follow. The Cloud of Blood over our heads begins to drop; there was one drop fell the other day▪ witness the man that was slain upon the Coasts: the Lord grant that a Shower of Blood may not follow. What need have we to pray, that this Cloud may blow over, and pass away.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Without doubt the Lord Iesus hath a peculiar respect unto this place, and for this people.</HI> This is <HI>Immanuels Land.</HI> Christ by a wonderful Providence hath dispossessed Satan, who reigned se∣curely in these Ends of the Earth, for Ages the Lord knowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h how many, and here the Lord hath caused as it were <HI>New Ieru∣salem</HI> to come down from Heaven; He dwels in this place: there∣fore we may conclude that he will scourge us for our back∣slidings. So doth he say, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.19. <HI>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.</HI> It is not onely true concerning particular persons, but as to Churches, (those words were spoken to a Church) that if Christ hath a peculiar love unto them, then he will rebuke and
<PB N="27" REF="000192_0030_0FA31736073E5AD8"/>
chasten them, as there shall be cause for it. Indeed we may therefore hope that the Lord will not destroy us. Through the grace of Christ, I am not at all afraid of that. The Lord will not as yet destroy this place: Our Fathers have built Sanctuaries for his Name therein, and therefore he will not destroy us. The Planting of these Heavens, and the laying the Foundations of this Earth, is one of the Wonders of this last Age. As <HI>Moses</HI> said, <HI>Ask now of the dayes that are p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, ask from one side of Hea∣ven to the other, hath God essayed to go and take him a Nation out of the midst of a Nation?</HI> Deut. 4.32, 34. God hath culled out a people, even out of all parts of a Nation, which he hath also had a great favour towards, and hath brought them by a mighty hand, and an out-stretched arm, over a greater then the Red Sea, and here hath he planted them, and hath caused them to grow up as it were into a little Nation: And shall we think that all this is to destroy them within forty or fifty years? Destruction shall not as yet be. Nevertheless, the Lord may greatly afflict us, and bring us very low. It is a notable Observation, which I remem∣ber a <HI>Iewish</HI> Writer hath, who lived in the dayes of the second Temple;
<Q>The dealings of God with out Nation (saith he) and with the Nations of the world, is very different: for other Nations may sin and do wickedly, and God doth not punish them, untill they have filled up the measure of their sins, and then he utterly destroyeth them; but if our Nation forsake the God of their Fathers never so little, God presently cometh up∣on us with one Judgement or other, that so he may prevent our destruction.</Q>
So let me say, Neighbouring Plantations about us may possibly sin grievously, and yet it may be long be∣fore the Lord taketh them to do, because it may be hee'll reckon with them once for all at last; but if <HI>New-England</HI> shall forsake the Lord, Judgement shall quickly overtake us, because the God of our Fathers is not willing to destroy us their Children.</P>
<P>These things then are enough to awaken us out of our Secu∣rity. I have thought of three other Signs of approaching Mi∣sery, which I shall not mention at this time, albeit they are (in my apprehension) no less ominous, then any thing that hath been spoken.</P>
<P><HI>VSE</HI> IV. I conclude with a word of Exhortation. <HI>Let us carry our selves as doth become those that have a day of trouble near unto them; yea, so as that we may prevent the troubles which
<PB N="28" REF="000192_0031_0FA31736C58131E8"/>
seem to be near.</HI> I need not say much by way of Motive. Re∣member the <HI>Arguments</HI> mentioned in the last Use▪ and the <HI>Signs</HI> of Troubles being near, insisted on in the former part of the day. And consider, that if we carry our selves in a suitable manner, we may possibly escape those Evils, that otherwise are like to overtake us. It is possible that this Cloud may blow over, <HI>Amos</HI> 5.15. <HI>It may be the Lord of Hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Ioseph.</HI> Truly we are the remnant of <HI>Ioseph</HI>; we are (as <HI>Io∣seph</HI> was) <HI>separated from our Brethren,</HI> who can tell but that the Lord may be gracious to us? <HI>Zeph.</HI> 2.3. <HI>Seek ye the Lord, all the meek of the earth; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</HI> Nay, if we carry our selves as doth become us in a day of trouble, it's past a <HI>may be,</HI> that we shall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> But <HI>how ought we to carry our selves now that trouble is near unto us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. <HI>It doth concern us and become us to be an humble people.</HI> As sometimes the Lord said to his people of old, <HI>Now put off thy Ornaments, that I may know what to do unto thee,</HI> Exod. 33.5. so doth the Lord by his Providence speak to us, Put off thy Orna∣ments, O <HI>New-England,</HI> that I may know what to do unto thee, that I may know whether I had best spare thee, or punish thee. Prepare to meet thy God; even to meet him as sometimes <HI>Abi∣gail</HI> did <HI>David,</HI> with-Confessions, and humble Supplications. And if we humble our selves deeply and unfeignedly, God cannot finde in his heart to destroy us. It is a wonderful Scripture which we have, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.16. <HI>David lift up his eyes, and saw the Angel of the Lord stand between the Earth and the Heaven, having a drawn Sword in his hand, stretched out over Ierusalem; then David and the Elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</HI> Indeed the Angel of the Lord is standing over us with a drawn Sword in his hand, but if we fall upon our faces before the Lord, as doth become us, God will say, Let it be enough that the Sword is held over this people, stay thine hand, put up the Sword.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cometh us in such a day as this, to be a very Heavenly people.</HI> As <HI>Elison</HI> said, <HI>Is it a time to receive money, and garmenss, and olive yards,</HI> &amp;c? So▪ is it now a time for us to set our mindes upon the world, and the things of the world? We should now remember what the Prophet <HI>Ieremiah</HI> said to <HI>Baruch,</HI> Chap. 45.5.
<PB N="29" REF="000192_0032_0FA3173785F3E530"/>
<HI>And seekest thou great things for thy self? seek them not: for be∣hold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord.</HI> Now will no∣thing serve you but the world, in this day wherein God is sha∣king all Nations, yea shaking Heaven and Earth, and Sea and dry Land? What is the voice of God to us in these dreadful dispen∣sations, but this, See that your hearts be taken off from the world, and set them more upon those things that cannot be shaken?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We should be a Believing people.</HI> That's the way to be deli∣vered out of trouble: <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.4. <HI>Our fathers trusted in thee; they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.</HI> O the mighty things that Faith can do! It is said, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.34. <HI>By Faith they escaped the edge of the Sword, and turned to flight the Armies of the aliens.</HI> Though Armies should come against us, the Spirit of Faith may turn them back. In the times of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> (for unto those troubles doth the Apostle there allude) sometimes a small hand∣full, worsted great Armies that came against them, because they acted Faith upon the Name of the Lord. Or if troubles should overtake us, Faith will help us to suffer, as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to do great things for God.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It concerns us in this day of trouble to be a Reforming people.</HI> Let us <HI>amend our wayes and our doings, and the Lord will cause us to dwell in this place,</HI> Jer. 7.3. Certainly we need Reformation. Where is the old <HI>New-England Spirit,</HI> that once was amongst us? Where is our first love? Where is our Zeal for God, especially in matters respecting the first Table, which once was our glory? What is become of that life and power of godliness, that hath been in this place? Now if the Lord help us to reform whatever is amiss, he will still do us good, notwithstanding all our sins, which have provoked him, and caused him to frown upon us. We have a plain Text for this, <HI>Ier.</HI> 18.7▪ 8. <HI>At what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdome, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; if that Nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, then will I repent of the evil which I thought to do unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>It concerns us and becomes us, now that trouble is near, to be a Vnited people:</HI> otherwise our Enemies will say, that we are un∣der a penal Infatuation. We may well say as that worthy Divine was wont to express, <HI>Haec non sunt litigandi, sed orandi tempora</HI>; These are not times for us to be contending one against another,
<PB N="30" REF="000192_0033_0FA31738457C1938"/>
but rather to be praying one with another, and one for another. Shall we be worse then dumb, and brute, and savage Creatures have sometimes been? It is a memorable Passage, which some Historians make mention of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. <HI>Full<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of En∣gland,</HI> in his F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to <HI>Somersetshire.</HI></NOTE> That once in <HI>Somersetshire</HI> in <HI>En∣gland,</HI> when there was a sudden Flood, wherein many men were drowned, the dumb Creatures ran to the top of an Hill, that so they might escape the fury and destruction of the Flood; and there such Creatures as had an Antipathy in their Natures, even Dogs and Hares, yea Cats and Mice, could sit quietly together, and never offer to molest one another. Why behold, there is a Flood coming in upon us, And shall we not now live quietly by one another? Shall we not at such a time as this lay aside our Animosities and Variances about matters, which it's great pity that ever a Contention should be upheld amongst good men, about such small differences? Naturalists write concerning the Stone <HI>Tyrrhenus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Mr Slaters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> p. 29</NOTE> that if it be cast upon the water whole, it will swim, but if it be broken it will sink presently. Would we sink, or would we swim in this Sea of trouble that is a coming? If we break, we shall sink; if we divide, we perish, and are like to be an undone people: But if we be <HI>whole,</HI> if we unite, we shall <HI>swim,</HI> our heads will then be above water, let what troubles can come: yea, and we shall then be a burthensome stone to all that shall burthen themselves with us. If we do but become one with God and one another, as we ought to be, we need not fear all the world. Oh that our Divisions, and other Evils that are amongst us, might be repented of, and then I dare speak it boldly before all this Congregation, God will make <HI>New-England</HI> a burthen∣some stone, yea though all the Nation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Earth should be gathered together against it, they shall be broken in pieces.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>We should be a Praying people.</HI> Psal. 50.15. <HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble.</HI> Thus <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 22.11. <HI>Be not far from me, for trouble is near.</HI> In a time when trouble was near, he doth be∣take himself to God by Faith and Prayer. What people under Heaven have ever had more encouragement unto Prayer, then we have had? Know it Enemies to your terrour; Know it all the World, That the Lords poor <HI>New-England-People,</HI> have ever found him to be a <HI>God that heareth Prayer</HI>: and therefore let's be at that work still. And truly, there is as much need now as ever. We may even say, as sometimes that blessed Martyr did, <HI>Pray, pray, pray, never more need then now.</HI> Alas, that we are no oftener
<PB N="31" REF="000192_0034_0FA3173905D98348"/>
in such a solemn manner, as at this day before the Lord! We may here allude to that which is spoken, <HI>Rev.</HI> 8. we there reade that there was <HI>silence in Heaven half an hour,</HI> and then followeth <HI>an Earthquake.</HI> It's sad to consider, that there hath been so great a silence in Heaven amongst us: I have thought on it with some grief of heart, that there hath not been so much Fasting and Praying in <HI>New-England</HI> of late years, as sometimes formerly, though never so much need as now. Who knoweth, but the Lord may bring these troubles within our sight, that so we may seek him early, yea that so the Spirit of Prayer may be awakened amongst us? There are some that cannot pray, all unregenerate sinners are destitute of the Spirit of Prayer; many poor misera∣ble Souls, that keep their Prayers and Tears till such time as they will do them no good. But I know that there are many, Scores, Hundreds here this day, that have an Interest in Heaven, and know how to improve it. Why then, up and be doing. If thou hast but one Tear in thy eyes, if thou hast but one Prayer in thy heart, spend it now. And let us remember the words of the Lord Jesus, <HI>Luke</HI> 21.36. <HI>Watch ye therefore, and pray alwayes, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things which shall come to pass.</HI></P>
