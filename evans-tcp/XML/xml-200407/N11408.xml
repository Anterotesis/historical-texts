<L>AMERICANS pray lend an Ear</L>
<L>And you a solemn Tale shall hear</L>
<L>'Twas on the seventeenth of JUNE,</L>
<L>Men were cut down all in their bloom.</L>

<L>GOD grant it's memory may lye</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> witness against TYRANNY,</L>
<L>Also against NEW-ENGLAND'S sin,</L>
<L>Which hath let cruel TYRANTS in!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Whose bloody minds are to devour,</L>
<L>For which they do Exert <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir power.</L>
<L>They would establish SLAVARY</L>
<L>Or else our Land in ruin lay,</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Last JUNE, upon the seventeenth day.</L>
<L>These Troops for CHARLESTOWN made their way</L>
<L>For to resist our SOLDIERS there,</L>
<L>Who a strong FORT prepairing were.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>The SHIPS of WAR had gather'd round,</L>
<L>To make our Soldiers quit the ground.</L>
<L>And tho' some Men by them were slain</L>
<L>Yet still their courage they retain.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>But when those Troops had landed there,</L>
<L>Our Men to fight them did prepare,</L>
<L>And when our Men shot their first round,</L>
<L>Many BRITAINS gasped on the ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>They Fought like brave MEN on both sides,</L>
<L>And many a valiant HERO dy'd.</L>
<L>The Earth was soaked with their blood,</L>
<L>And wounded wallow'd in the Flood.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>So warm a Fight is seldom known,</L>
<L>Men were cut down like Grass that's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>And some say Gage who did them 'spie,</L>
<L>Said we that ground too dear shall buy,</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Our Men that fought, they were but few,</L>
<L>Their POWDER being spent, withdrew,</L>
<L>And left the ground unto their foe,</L>
<L>And back again were forst to go.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' BRITISH TROOPS the ground did <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>Yet many more of them were slain,</L>
<L>The best intelligence doth tell,</L>
<L>One THOUSAND and near FIFTY fell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis thought they lost five to our one,</L>
<L>Altho' our Men were forc'd to run,</L>
<L>They bought the victory so dear</L>
<L>It did not much increase our fear,</L>

<LG N="12">

<L>These Savage Troops CHARLESTOWN, did <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>And it to Ashes did expire,</L>
<L>The TOWN novv in destruction lies,</L>
<L>The sight affects our hearts and eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>Why is this desolation made?</L>
<L>Why is the Tyrants banner spread?</L>
<L>Why is he suffer'd thus to reign</L>
<L>And so far Victory obtain.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>NEW-ENGLAND search and know the cause,</L>
<L>Hast thou not broken GOD's blest LAVVS,</L>
<L>For which thy GOD doth thee chastize,</L>
<L>And turns thy Friends to Enemies.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>Would thou obtain thy LIBERTY,</L>
<L>Then break all bands of slavery,</L>
<L>And do thou LIBERTY proclaim</L>
<L>To all that have a human frame.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>But if oppression here is found?</L>
<L>Can you with victory be crown'd,</L>
<L>No, no, be sure this cannot be,</L>
<L>While thou thy neighbours do not free.</L>

<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>O may we ne'er forget the Day,</L>
<L>When Charlestown in it's ruins lay,</L>
<L>And many of our Sons did die</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed before their enemy.</L>

<LG N="18">
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>MOTHERS Lament their Sons that fell,</L>
<L>And Wife's the loss of Husbands tell,</L>
<L>Their Cries may cause the hardest heart,</L>
<L>With their distress to bear a part.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>Come mourn with them and for them pray</L>
<L>That GOD would turn their night to day,</L>
<L>Make up their loss by special Grace,</L>
<L>That they with joy may see his face.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>Let's view the rod that GOD hath sent</L>
<L>And for our many sins relent,</L>
<L>So that God's wrath again may cease</L>
<L>And may restore our land to peace-</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>That TYRANTS may no more arise</L>
<L>And brand their Swords with haughty eyes,</L>
<L>May Heaven cause their pride to cease,</L>
<L>That so Christ's kingdom may encrease.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>May GOD bring on the happy day</L>
<L>When carnal Swords no more shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay,</L>
<L>And CHRIST as Prince of peace shall reign,</L>
<L>And War be learnt no more again.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<HEAD>XXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall lay oppression by,</L>
<L>Their neighbours good shall not envy,</L>
<L>Nor covet what is not their own</L>
<L>Nor tread the poorer people down.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="24">
<HEAD>XXIV.</HEAD>
<L>That day will bring great joy to all,</L>
<L>That on the name of GOD do call,</L>
<L>When Wars and fightings shall no more,</L>
<L>Spread desolation as before.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>Then Nations shall together join,</L>
<L>And Kings their septres shall resign,</L>
<L>To JESUS as their Priest and KING,</L>
<L>And shall to him their honours bring.</L>

<LG N="26">
<HEAD>XXVI.</HEAD>
<L>Thus CHRIST shall have a large encrease,</L>
<L>And shall his kingdom rule in peace,</L>
<L>The CHURCH in him shall rest secure</L>
