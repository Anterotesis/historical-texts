<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by <HI>T.W. Fitzgerald, Esq.</HI>—Spoken by Mr. <HI>Macready.</HI></BYLINE>
<L>WHEN invalids possess both faith and wealth,</L>
<L>They'll find a nostrum to restore their health;</L>
<L>A <HI>panacea</HI> advertis'd to cure</L>
<L>Each ill the human body can endure.</L>
<L>But our bold Author claims a nobler art,</L>
<L>And advertises to relieve—the heart</L>
<L>So many patients he expects to see,</L>
<L>That I'm appointed as his deputy.</L>
<L>Now, then, your mental maladies explain,</L>
<L>And I'll remove or mitigate the pain.</L>
<L>Does love or jealousy your peace molest,</L>
<L>Revenge inflame, ambition gnaw your breast?</L>
<L>For jealousy, a sovereign balm behold,—</L>
<L>The husband's certain cure, a pill of gold;</L>
<L>This dose, administer'd with prudent care,</L>
<L>Dispels at once the frailties of the fair;</L>
<L>Deprives the proctor of his <HI>crim.-con.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee,</L>
<L>And tunes the chord that jar'd to harmony.</L>
<L>Sould love torment some Romeo's heated brain,</L>
<L>Or agonize a Iuliet's breast with pain,</L>
<L>Let them my po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent remedy apply,—</L>
<L>The maid shall cease to pine, the youth to sigh:</L>
<L>Gold shall restore each drooping lover's health,</L>
<L>And passion find a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>stitute in wealth.</L>
<L>But let not ill-tim'd ridicule degrade</L>
<L>What Heav'n, when well applied, a blessing made,</L>
<L>To foster merit, wheresoever found,</L>
<L>And with improvement cheer a country round;</L>
<L>To feed the hungry, and to clothe the poor,</L>
<L>And send the beggar happy from the door;</L>
<L>To mitigate the horrors of despair,</L>
<L>And make the family of want our care;</L>
<L>To succour genius, drooping in distress,</L>
<L>Making the business of our lives to bless.</L>
<L>When the rich man can such employment find,</L>
<L>We wish his purse as ample as his mind.</L>
<L>For one poor patient I've an anxious fear;</L>
<L>And you must be his kind physicians here.</L>
<L>Our Author has to-night so much at stake,</L>
<L>He finds his throbbing heart inclin'd to ache!</L>
<L>But should his Play a lib'ral audience please,</L>
<L>Your warm applause will set his heart at ease.</L>

<P>Listen to me.—You have heard how my father kept alive the benevolent hospitality that once distinguish'd old England, and I not finding in modern ethics aught likely to improve either the morals or happiness of mankind, deter∣min'd to persevere in the ways of my fathers. Soon after you went abroad, the adjoining estate was purchas'd by an East Indian, groaning under wealth produc'd by groans. Like the viper, after collecting in the warm sunshine his bag of venom, he came to the abode of peace and innocence, and disseminated his poison. But mark me—think me not so un∣just, boy, as with random slander to censure any body of men.
