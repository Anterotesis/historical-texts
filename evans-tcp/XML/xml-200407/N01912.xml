<HEAD>MEMORIAL, Humbly shewing, the Past and Present State of the Land lying Waste and Un-inhabited between <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Main</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> in <HI>AMERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT the said Land was first possess'd by the <HI>French,</HI> and a∣bout the beginning of the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, the <HI>Dutch</HI> in their War then with <HI>France,</HI> drove the <HI>French</HI> from thence. It was afterwards with <HI>New-York</HI> confirm'd to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second granted it with <HI>New-York</HI> to his Brother <HI>Iames Duke</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> who at his own Expence settled One Thousand One Hun∣dred <HI>English Families</HI> thereon, and kept it in his own Possession 'till he Abdi∣cated the Crown, and at the Revolution the said Settlement was broke up and destroy'd by Fire and Sword by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Frenchify'd Indians</HI> from <HI>Canada, &amp;c.</HI> And the whole Land laid wast as it remains to this Day.</P>
<P>THE Inhabitants of the Province of the <HI>Massatusets-Bay,</HI> by a false Sugge∣stion, obtain'd a <HI>Grant</HI> of the said Land from their late Majesties <HI>King William</HI> and <HI>Queen Mary</HI> in the Year 1691, with a Reservation, that the Government of the <HI>Massatusets</HI> should pass no <HI>Grants</HI> of any of the said Lands without the Approbation of the <HI>Crown</HI>; After which, the <HI>Massatusets</HI> would not be at the Expence of Protecting and Defending the same, but in the Year 1696, gave it up to the <HI>French King,</HI> to whom it remained 'till the Year 1710, that General <HI>Nicholson</HI> with her late Majesties Arms Reconquer'd the same; which was confirm'd to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht.</HI> But neither the <HI>Massatusets</HI> nor the <HI>French,</HI> settled any Inhabitants thereon since the Revolution.</P>
<P>THE North side of it adjoyning to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> the Seat of the Government of <HI>Canada</HI> and the native <HI>Indians</HI> there being converted by the <HI>French-Ie∣suits,</HI> and poyson'd by their Principles, and constantly Allyed and Confede∣rated with the <HI>French</HI> Nation, will render it Impossible to be Settled but in time of Peace with <HI>France</HI>: For which reason, and considering the Destructi∣on of the forme. <HI>English Settlement</HI> there at the Revolution as aforesaid, to pre∣vent the like Mischiefs for the future, the <HI>Petitioners</HI> for Settling it have been, and are, very desirous to improve the present Opportunity of Peace, in getting a powerful Body of People settled there capable to defend the said Land; And that it may be Erected into a <HI>Province</HI> and settled under his <HI>Majesties</HI> Govern∣ment (not <HI>Proprietory</HI>) and granted in Trust to several <HI>Noblemen</HI> and other fit Persons to be appointed by his <HI>Majesty</HI> Trustees for the well Ordering and Settling the Land, and to pay <HI>Annually</HI> a Quit-Rent to the <HI>Crown</HI> of Twenty eight Pound Weight of <HI>Hemp</HI> for the use of the <HI>Royal-Navy</HI> for every hundred Acres of <HI>Land</HI> taken up, at which Rate, when the whole is Settled, by Com∣putation the <HI>Quit-Rent</HI> will amount to the value of One hundred thousand Pound <HI>Sterling per <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Lords Commissioners</HI> for <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Plantations,</HI> in the Year 1716, when the said Petitioners was by His <HI>Majesty</HI> referr'd to that Board, did propose that the Petitioners should provide Trustees to the Crown, for settling the said Land, which the said Petitioners then perform'd to their <HI>Lordships</HI> great Satisfaction with <HI>Persons</HI> of great <HI>Worth,</HI> that were willing for the general <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Pub∣lick,</HI> to undertake the <HI>Trust</HI>: But, the <HI>Claims</HI> against the <HI>Crowns Right</HI> coming then to be laid before their <HI>Lordships</HI> by the <HI>Agent</HI> for the <HI>Province</HI> of the <HI>Massatusets-Bay,</HI> in behalf of the said <HI>Province,</HI> and several others, which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB REF="002261_0002_0FDAE0D50458E270"/>
a Report was made to His <HI>Majesty,</HI> that the said Land did not belong to the <HI>Crown:</HI> The said <HI>Lords Commissioners,</HI> did notwithstanding, at the same time Report to His <HI>Majesty</HI> in favour of the <HI>Petitioners,</HI> for a Settlement for them and their Families, upon His <HI>Majesties</HI> Conquered Lands Adjacent thereunto, which Report was made the 21st of <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1718.</P>
<P>That His <HI>Majesty</HI> the same Day the said Report was Read in <HI>Council,</HI> was Graciously pleased to Refer the Matter to the <HI>Right Honourable</HI> the <HI>Lords of the Committee of His Majesties Most Honourable Privy-Council,</HI> before whom the said Petitioners (it's humbly hoped) have now made out <HI>the Right of the Crown to the said Land that they first Petitioned for a Settlement on</HI>; which they have perform'd by great length of Time, Labour, and Expence, against a <HI>Powerful Opposition:</HI> And having spent the Prime of their Years in the <HI>Service of the Crown,</HI> and was several of them at the <HI>Re-conquering the said Land,</HI> and then had <HI>Her late Majesties Most Gracious Promise,</HI> that they should have the Preference of all GRANTS of Lands there, which Promise <HI>Her Majesty</HI> again Repeated to the Petitioners since the Conclusion of the Peace.</P>
<P>And having according to the said Proposal made by the Lords Commissioners for Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> prepared Trustees of great Worth, Noblemen, Gentlemen, Merchants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who are willing to undertake the Trust of settling the said Land, and carry on Trade and Merchandize on the same Conditions to the Crown, that the Petitioners have proposed in their humble Petition to His <HI>Majesty</HI> the 21st of <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1718. (jointly with the Petitioners) <HI>viz.</HI> That the Property of the Soyl and the Government shall remain to the Crown, and all Trade be free for all His <HI>Maiesties</HI> Subjects (by which Scheme) what By People that may adventure thither and settle at their own Expence, and what By Families that the Trustees may have Power to transport and settle, that are not of Ability to transport and settle themselves. The Province may be speedily peopled in such a Powerful Manner, that may not only put it out of the Power of <HI>France</HI> ever to recover or disturb the same; but in all proba∣bility may render it capable to reduce <HI>Canada</HI> in a future War with <HI>France,</HI> and may in a little time become the most useful Province in <HI>America:</HI> The Soyl and Climate thereof being fit for Raising Hemp and Flax, which is design'd to be the Staple Commodity of the Province as Tobacco is in <HI>Virginia</HI>; and all other Sorts of Naval Stores may be Raised and had there in great Abundance, which may be brought to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> in Exchange of our own Manufactures, and considerably increase the Consumption of every Branch thereof. It will joyn His <HI>Majesties</HI> Empire there as it were with a Chain. And from the Ad∣vantage of its Scituation for Navigation and Trade, may (if the Settlement be incouraged) become an extraordinary Nursery for Seamen, and produce a great Addition of Strength to the Crown both by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>The Premises Considered,</P>
<P>The Petitioners therefore Humbly <HI>Prays,</HI> That it may please your <HI>LORDSHIP</HI> to <HI>Move,</HI> that <HI>His MAJESTY</HI> may be Graciously Pleased to <HI>GRANT,</HI> That the said Lands and Islands may be Erected into a <HI>Province, &amp;c.</HI> by the Name of GEORGIA or otherwise, as His <HI>MAJESTY</HI> shall think fit: And that the Property of the Soyl, and the Government Remain in the <HI>CROWN;</HI> That the Petitioners and others may Transport themselves and Settle there at their own Expence. And that they who may be the <HI>Trustees,</HI> may be Impower'd to Transport and Settle People there: And that such Privileges may be <HI>Granted</HI> to the Inhabitants of the said <HI>Province,</HI> to Encourage the speedy Peopling and effectual Settling thereof, during the Interval of <HI>Peace,</HI> As His <HI>MAJESTY</HI> in His Great Wisdom shall think fit.</P>
<CLOSER>And His MAJESTIES <HI>Humble Petitioners,</HI> As in Duty Bound shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></CLOSER>
