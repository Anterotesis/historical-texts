Night came on and the Weather increas'd; and about 8 Clock in the Evening a Sea poopt us, and drove in our two Larboard Lights in the Cabbin, which almost fill'd it and the Steerage, putting out all our Lights below, and spoil'd our Tinder; but by the Help of a Pistol with some Powder I got Light again. I found the Sea had car∣ry'd away one dead Light, so that to supply the De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cency, was obliged to put my Bed into one of the Windows, and secur'd it in the best Manner I was capable. I then set the Boys to bailing the Water out of the Steerage with Buckets as fast as they could, and call'd for the Broad-Ax and plac'd it at the Cabbin-Door, so that I might readily find it in Case she broach'd too, to have cut away her Main-Mast.</P>
<P>After Things were in this Posture, I went up on the Quarter-Deck, the Weather appear'd with a terrible Aspect, and a monstrous Sea follow'd us; but the Vessel steering exceeding well, and the Mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <HI>Sam.

and by that Time the Vessel had winded so that her Deck came to the Wind, which taking in her Gunnel she immediately righted, and soon fell down on her Starboard Broad-Side. We immediately got on board as she righted, and fell on our Knees, desiring God to spare us: But as she fell down again we were oblig'd to shift for our selves, to get on the Weather Bow, where the Fore-Mast Yard and Rigging prevented my getting up for some Time, so that the Sea struck me back several Times, that I could scarce recover to se∣cure my self from being drowned, till at length I got hold.

<P>Some considerable Time after we heard the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lloe, which we answer'd, and it was something of a Surprize to us, not doubting but that he was drowned; but upon our Answers he came to us, which was a great Joy to us, to think God was so wonderfully kind and merciful to preserve us all in this terrible Overthrow: We blessed God, and put up our earnest Prayer to Him in the best Manner we were capable, and waited pa∣tiently for the Return of the Day; at which Time the Weather was something abated, and presented to our View the most terrible Sight that any Mortal can imagine, or Tongue can express▪ The Stern Lights were beat in, and the Bulk-Heads, and the Cabbin

were all blown up, and every Thing wash'd out that was necessary for the Support of Life: We were naked and cold, no Cloaths to put on, nor Victuals to satisfy our craving and hungry Appetites: Our Water that was lash'd on Deck in the best Manner, was gone: O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Boat, that might have been of some Help to us in Case we discover'd a Vessel, was likewise gone: In short every Thing that was above our Main Deck was gone, only-our Quarter Deck remain'd, and the Main-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over it, which was confin'd by the Main-Sheet.</P>
<P>But one Thing I am short in, that was, that toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Day, after the Weather moderated, our People went aft on the Quarter Deck, where they thought to be more out of the Sea▪ being almost drowned, and where they secured an old Stay-Sail, and wrap'd themselves up as well as they could under the Starboard netting Rail.

Accordingly this Day I began, altho' it was Sabbath-Day, my Hands being very much swell'd, and particularly my Right-One, having a Wound on the Inside, occasion'd by the Prick of a Nail the Day before we overset: I finish'd two Lines, but my Hand failing me very much I could do no more, without great Pain· However it being fair pleasant Weather, we kept a wishful sharp Look-out; but Nothing appeared.
