<HEAD>A PROCLAMATION FOR A PUBLIC THANKSGIVING.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHO' in Consequence of the <HI>unnatural, cruel,</HI> and<HI>barbarous</HI> Measures, adopted and pursued by the British Administration, great and distressing Calamities are brought upon our oppressed Country, and on this Colony in particular; we feel the dreadful Effects of <HI>Civil War,</HI> by which America is stained with the Blood of her valiant Sons, who have bravely fallen in the laudable Defence of our Rights and Priviledges;—Our <HI>Capital,</HI> once the <HI>Seat of Justice,</HI> Opulence and Virtue, is unjustly wrested from its proper Owners, who are obliged to flee from the Iron Hand of Tyranny, or are held in the unrelenting Arms of Oppression:—Our Sea-Ports greatly distressed, and Towns burnt by the Foes, who have acted the Part of barbarous Incendiaries.—And altho' the wise and holy Governor of the World, has, in his righteous Providence, sent Droughts into this Colony, and wasting Sickness into many of our Towns; yet we have the greatest Reason to adore and praise the Supreme Disposer of Events, who deals infinitely better with us than we deserve; and amidst all his Iudg∣ments hath remembered Mercy, by causing the Voice of Health again to be heard amongst us;—Instead of Famine, affording to an ungrateful People a Competency of the Necessaries and Comforts of Life; in remar∣kably preserving and protecting our Troops, when in apparent Danger, while our <HI> Enemies,</HI> with all their <HI>boas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> Skill and Strength, have met with <HI>Loss, Disappointment,</HI> and <HI>Defeat;—</HI> and in the Course of his good Providence, the Father of Mercies hath bestowed upon us, many other Favours, which call for our grateful Acknowledgements.</P>
<P>Therefore,<LB/>
WE have thought fit, with the Advice of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uncil and House of Representatives, to appoint THURSDAY the <HI>Twenty-third</HI> Day of <HI>November</HI> Instant, to be observed as a Day of public <HI>THANKSGIVING,</HI> throughout this Colony; hereby calling upon Ministers and People, to meet for religious Worship on said Day, and <HI>devoutly</HI> to offer up their unfeigned Praises to Almighty GOD, the Source and benevolent Bestower of all Good, for his affording the necessary Means of Subsistance, tho' our Commerce has been prevented, and the Supplies from the Fishery denied us.—That such a Measure of Health is enjoyed among us; that the Lives of our Officers and Soldiers have been so remarkably preserved, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e our Enemies have fell before them:—That the vigorous Efforts which have been used to excite the Savage Vengeance of the Wilderness, and rouse the <HI>Indians</HI> to Arms, that an unavoidable Destruc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion might come upon our Frontiers, have been almost miraculously defeated:—That our unnatural Enemies, instead of Ravaging the Country with uncontrouled Sway, are confined within such narrow Limits, to their own Mortification and Distress, environed by an <HI>American</HI> Army, <HI>brave</HI> and <HI>determined</HI>;—That such a Band of Union, founded upon the best Principles, unites the <HI>American Colonies</HI>:—That our Rights and Priviledges, both Civil and Religious, are so far preserved to us, notwithstanding all the Attempts of our barbarous Enemies to deprive us of them.—</P>
<P>And to offer up humble and fervent Prayers to Almighty GOD, for the whole <HI>British</HI> Empire; espe∣cially for the UNITED <HI>AMERICAN</HI> COLONIES:—That he would bless our Civil Rulers, and lead them into wise and prudent Measures in this dark, and difficult Day:—That he would endow our General Court with all that Wisdom which is profitable to direct:—That he would graciously Smile upon our Endeavour; to restore Peace, preserve our Rights and Priviledges, and hand them down to Posterity:—That he would give Wisdom to the <HI>American</HI> Congress, equal to their important Station:—That he would direct the Gene∣rals, and the <HI>American</HI> Armies, wherever employed, and give them Success and Victory:—That he would preserve and strengthen the Harmony of the UNITED COLONIES:—That he would pour out his Spirit upon all Orders of Men, thro' the Land, bring us to a hearty Repentance and Refor∣mation; purify and sanctify all his Churches:—That he would make Our's Emanuel's Land:—That he would spread the Knowledge of the Redeemer thro' the whole Earth, and fill the World with his Glory.</P>
<P>And all servile Labour is forbidden on said Day.</P>
