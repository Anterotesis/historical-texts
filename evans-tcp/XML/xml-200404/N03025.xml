the following Declaration, which was carefully taken from her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mouth.</HEAD>
<P>BEING under the awful App<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ehension<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>
of my Execution now in a few Hours;
and being desirous to do all the Good
I can, before I enter the Eternal
Worl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>, I now in the fear of GOD, give this
Declaration and Warning to the Living.</P>
<P>I Was very tenderly brought up, and well In∣struct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>d
in my Father's House, till I was
Twelve Years of Age; but alass, my Child∣hood
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off in vanity. However, as I grew
in Years, my Youth was under very sensible
Impressions from the SPIRIT of GOD; and
I was awakened to seek and obtain Baptism,
when I was about Sixteen Years of Age; and
lived for some time with a strictness somewhat
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>swerable to the Obligations I was thereby
brought under. But within two or three Years
after this, I was led away i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> to the Sin of Un∣cleannes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>,
from which ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>e I think I may d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>te
my Ruin for this World. After this▪ I became
again more watchful, and for several Years kep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>
my self from the like Pollution<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>, until those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
which I am now to suffer.</P>
<P>And as it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be necessary, so do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>btless it
will be expected of me, that I give the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ld
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> particular account of that great Sin, with the
aggravations of it, which has brought me to
this Shameful Death: And accordingly in the
fear of GOD, at whose awful Tribunal I am
immediately to appear, I solemnly declare as
follows▪</P>
<P>That on Saturday the Fifth Day of <HI>May</HI> last,
being then something more than Eight Months
gon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> with Child, as I was about my Houshold
Business reaching some San<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> from out of a
large Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>k, I received considerable hurt,
which put me into great Pain, and so I conti∣nued
till the Tuesday following; in all which
time I am not sensible I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>elt any Life or Motion
in the Child within me; when, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Tuesday the Eighth Day of <HI>May,</HI> I was D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>li∣ver'd
when alo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>e of a Male Infa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>t; in whom
I did not p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>rceive Life; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>ill uncertain of
Life <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>t, I threw it into the Vault about two
or three Minutes after it was born; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
I say, whether it was a living or dead Child▪
tho, I confess <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> probable there was Life in it,
and some Circum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>ances seem to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it.
I therefore own the Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>tice of GOD and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
in my Condemnation, and take Shame to my
self, as I have none but my self to Blame▪ and
am so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ry for any rash Expressions I have at any
time uttered since my Condem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ation; and I
am verily pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>swaded there is no Place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>n the
World, where there is a more st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ict <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>egard to
Justice than in this Province.</P>
<P>And now as a Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> going into Etern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="•••"/>, I
most earnestly and solemnly Warn all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
particularly YOUNG PEOPLE, and more
especially those of my own Sex, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the
Sins which their Age peculiarly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them
to; and as the Sin of Uncleanness has brought
me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>nto these distressing Circumstances, I would
with the greatest Importunity C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>tion and Warn
against it, being p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>rswaded of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of that Sin in this Town and Land. I tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>ht
my self as secure, a little more than a Year ago,
as many of you now do; but by woful Expe∣rience
I have found, that Lust when it has con∣ceived
bri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>geth forth Sin, and Sin when it is
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>nished bringet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> forth Death; it exposes the
Soul not only to Temporal, but to Eternal Death.
And therefore as a Dying Person▪ let me call
upon you to forsake the foolish and live: Do
not accompany with those you know to be such▪
and if Sinners en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ice you do not cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>nt. I
am sensible there are many Houses in this Town,
that may be called Houses of Uncleanness, and
Places of dreadful Temptations to this and all
other Sins. O shun them, for they lead down
to the Chambers of Death and Eternal Misery.</P>
<P>My misp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>ce of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech" DISP="〈…〉"/> as a
heavy burden upon me; that when I might
have gone to the House of GOD, I have been
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and suffer'd a small matter to keep
me from i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>▪ What would I now give, had I
better improv'd the Lord'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> Day! I tell you,
ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>ly, your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sabbath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> will sit heavy upon
you, when you come into the near prospect of
Death and Eternity.</P>
<P>The Sin of Lying I have to bewail, and wou'd
earnestly caution against; not that I have took
so great a pleasure in Lying; but I have often
done so to conceal my Sin: Certainly you had
be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>er suffer Shame and Disgrace, yea the great∣est
Punishment, than to hide and conceal your
Sin, by Lying. How much better had it been
for me, to have confess'd my Sin, than by h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>d∣in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>
of it to provoke a holy GOD, thus to suffer
it to find me out. But I hope I heartily desire
to bless GOD, that even in this way, He is
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/> entring into Judgment with me; for I have
often thought, had I been let alone to go on
undiscovered in my Sins, I might have provok'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in to leave me to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Rebellion, that
would have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me for a more sudden, and
everlasting Destruction; and am fully convinc'd
of this, that I should have had no solid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ase or
quiet in my mind, but the Guilt of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ndis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>over'd
Sin lying upon my Conscience, would
have been a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rack unto me all my
Days; where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ow I hope GOD has discover'd
to me in some measure the evil of this, and all my
othe <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech" DISP="〈…〉"/> enabled me to repent of them in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ and made me earne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>tly desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>e
and plead with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for pardon and clea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>sing
in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>eci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>us Blood of the REDEEMER of
lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/> and perishing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> think I can
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I have had mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>e comfort and sat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>faction
within the Wall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> of this Prison, than ever I
ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> in the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>s of Sin among my vain Com∣pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>,
and think I wou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>d not for a World, nay
for ten Thousand Worlds have my liberty in
Sin again, and be in the same Condition I was
in before I came into this Place.</P>
<P>I had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> advantage of living in several reli∣giou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>
Fam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>lies; but alass, I disregarded the In∣structions
and War<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ings I there had, which is
now a bitterness to me; and so it will be to
those of you who are thus fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>oured, but go on
unmindful of GOD, and deaf to all the Re∣proofs
and Admonitions that are given you for
the good of your Souls. And I would advise
those of my own Sex especially, to chuse to go
into religious Families, where the Worship and
Fear of GOD is ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>tained, and submit your
selves to the Orde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/> and Government of them.</P>
<P>In my younger Years I maintain'd a constant
cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>se of Secret Pray<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/> for some time; but after∣wards
neglecting the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ame, I found by experience,
that upon my thus leaving GOD, He was provoked
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, and at length suffer'd me to fall
into that great and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> that has
brought me to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> Death: Mind me, I first l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ft
GOD, and then He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me: I therefore so∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>mnly
call upon YOUNG PEOPLE to cherish
the Convictio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>s of GOD's Holy SPIRIT, and
be sure keep up a consta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>t course of fervent Se∣cret
Prayer.</P>
<P>And now I am just entring <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>nto the Eternal
World, I do in the fear of GOD, and before
Witnesses, call upon our YOUNG PEOPLE in
particular, to secure an Interest in the Lord
JESUS CHRIST, and in those precio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/> Bene∣fits
He has purchased for His People; for sure∣ly
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>avour of GOD, thro' CHRIST, is more
worth than a whole World: And O what Com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ort
will this yield you when you c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>me to that
awful Day and Hour I am now arriving unto.
I must tell you the World appears to me vain
and empty, nothing like what it did in my pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>t
Life, my Days of Sin and Vanity, and as doubt∣less
it appears now to you. Will you be per∣swaded
by me to that which will yield you the
best Satisfaction a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>d Pleasure here, and which
will prepare you for the more abundant Plea∣su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>es
of GOD's Right Hand for evermore.</P>
