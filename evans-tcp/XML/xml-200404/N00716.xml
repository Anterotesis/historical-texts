<P>The following relation being large, I shall endeavour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be short; only, some of the things which seem to me most remarkable' I would more particularly recommend to the <HI>Readers</HI> observation.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The hearts of all men are in the hand of God,</HI> he can tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n them as he pleases. When these <HI>Man-eaters</HI> fury was at height, their knives in one hand, and the poor Shipwrakt People's heads in the other; their knees upon the others shoulders, and their looks dismal; on a suddain; the <HI>Sava∣ges</HI> were struck dumb, and their countenances changed, that
<PB REF="000863_0003_0FAC039AC38C3BD0"/>
they looked like another People; the <HI>Casseekey</HI> (or <HI>King</HI>) becoming as a safegard to the distressed, from the injuries of his own men: Nay, such confidence put he in them, that he would trust them to remove the mony, he had taken from themselves, before he would trust his own▪ When they were got from these to another place, where they ex∣pected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> safety, they found themselves disappointed▪ fresh dangers presenting themselves, as dismally as before; Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God prevented any further mischief, than the stripping them of those poor rags the others had left them, and some other abuses, which by that time were grown familiar to them, and were looked upon as <HI>light afflictions.</HI> The <HI>Cassee∣ky's</HI> Wife being made an instrument for their delivery, she and some others having some thing of tenderness of heart in them, though amongst such an inhumane crew.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many were the particular deliverances upon occasion of injuries offered. Once, an <HI>Arrow</HI> shot at them narrowly escaped them. Another time, some going to shoot Arrows at them, certain of their own company caught hold of their Bows and arms; Nay, though some of them shot, yet their arrows mist. Not to mention the frequent dangers they were in, upon every slight suspicion of their being <HI>English</HI>▪ of which more anon: And well might these poor sufferers be in continual fear of their lives, since about a 12 month be∣fore a parcel of <HI>Dutch-men</HI> who had likewise suffered Ship∣wrack, had been killed and devoured; and moreover, of the many Vessels supposed to be lost on that Coast, these are the first company, that are known to have escaped. Neither is it so wonderfull that they are thus cruel to strangers, since they are unnatural to their own aged People; they having no more compassion on them, than to make them Slaves to the younger. Yet are these <HI>Man-eaters</HI> as cowardly as cruel; when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came up, the sight of a rusty musket presented towards them, would make severall of them flie.</P>
<P N="3">3. The dangers they were delivered from, arose not only from men, but the <HI>Elements</HI> also God permitted to threaten them, and afflict them. One time rowing in their B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t,
<PB REF="000863_0004_0FAC039BAA441D38"/>
the Sea swelled, so that it was dangerous continuing there∣on al night, and as dangerous, to ende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vour for the shore▪ yet Providence failed them not, but conducted them safe th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther, as though there had been a lane made through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kers. Another time, by reason of a great Flood, they were forced to remove their lodgings several times, and for divers daies, were in a continual apprehension of being drowned, at length were preserved upon an <HI>Oyster-hill.</HI> Not to mention the frequent dangers they were in, by reason of the extream cold, too tedious to touch at here. Wherein this however is remarkable; that God can both administer strength in the midst of weakness, and also take away strength, and cause weakness to seize, whenever he pleases: Here was an old man, a Woman with a sucking child, and another with child Persons, seemingly, very unlikely to encounter such hardships, all escaped, and divers <HI>Negro's,</HI> used to more hardiness, perished.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> As to lodging; I shall say little, any discreet person may imagine, how hard it was to people well brought up, to lie on a floor, swarming with abundance of many sorts of creep∣ing things, occasioned by the throwing the berry stones on the floor, and letting all the nastiness they made lye there, which bred these vermine; and yet perhaps might be account¦ed good lodging, in comparison of the cold ground, where¦on they often lay afterwards unsheltered, exposed to the bleak blasts of the rigid <HI>North-West Wind.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Their Food mostly scanty, the best of it such, as (I am ready to think) the meanest <HI>Negro,</HI> here would not touch with his lips: Sometimes the gills and gutts of fish p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kt off a dunghill, sometimes the scraps the <HI>Indians</HI> flung away, and the Water they boyled their Fish in, though never so unde∣cently handled. At first their sorrows were so great, and their alarms so many, they could not eat; afterwards their dyet so uncouth, they could not away with it; untill at length hunger had so far prevailed over them▪ that they could eat with an appetite, the <HI>Palmetto-berries,</HI> the tast whereof was once irksome, and ready to take away their

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Nay so fond were they of them, that the getting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a bushel accidentally, was look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a great prize.</P>

<P>'This man of God, whose habitation was in one of the Northern Counties of <HI>England,</HI> was early convinced of the blessed truth of God, professed by the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI>
<PB REF="000863_0006_0FAC039FD67B0528"/>
and soon after had <HI>a dispensation of the Gospel committed</HI> to him. He lived in his Native Country, in esteem amongst his Neighbours, for his godly conversation, and honoured in the Church of God, as an Elder vvho had abode faithfull in his testimony, both in preaching the Gospel, suffering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the same, and behaving himself ansvverably thereunto. And in the Year 1694 the Spirit of God (from vvhom he first had his commi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion) requiring him to come over into thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> parts, to Preach the Gospel here also, <HI>he was not disobedi∣ent to the heavenly call,</HI> but gave up to do the will of God, though in a cross to his own, as appeared by an expression of his, before he left <HI>England,</HI> Which was to this effect,
<Q>That he had rather immediately have laid down his natural life there, if by so doing he could have kept his peace with God, than to have crossed the Seas to America.</Q>
Well▪ hither he came, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter he had throughly visited these parts, he took ship for the <HI>West-Indian Islands,</HI> and at length was returning from <HI>Iamaico,</HI> to this Town of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> when these calamities mentioned in the ensuing <HI>Iournal</HI> befell him. How he behaved himself under them, is therein expressed, with what patience he was carried through them, with what faith he overcame, even the very worst of men, so that it may be said, He was <HI>more than a Conquerour</HI> over those blood thirsty <HI>Canibals, looking to Him Who was invisible,</HI> and by his grace seeing beyond them and their cruelty; by Prayer <HI>wrest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing with God for a blessing,</HI> even the blessing of being delivered out of their barbarous hands, and laying his bones amongst faithfull Friends; and so effectual were his fervent prayers, that they <HI>prevailed with God</HI>; and so gracious was his God unto him, that He sealed an assurance upon his spirit, that his prayers were heard, and should in due time be ansvvered, before he vvas yet off his knees. And doubtles, he was made a strength and a comfort, to his companions in affliction, whose remembrance will not be easily blotted out of their minds.</P>
<P>One remarkable passage I cannot well omit, Which de∣monstrates, he had well learnt of him vvho is a <HI>God of
<PB REF="000863_0007_0FAC03A309231898"/>
truth,</HI> to speak the truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all occasions, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the hazard of his life. For as the <HI>Reader</HI> may observe i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Series of this follovving relation, thiese poor people, for the safegurd of their lives, had assumed the name of <HI>Span∣iards,</HI> some on that account asserting what was wrong, others concealing the truth, yet this honest hearted man, being directly asked the question, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer?</HI> (the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for <HI>Englishman</HI>) could do neither; but in simplicity answered, yes; being asked so concerning another, he a∣gain ansvvered, yes. Yet, though for his plain dealing he was stript of his cloths, which till then he had saved; God suffered not these <HI>Savages</HI> to touch his life, or the lives of any of his company.</P>
<P>Thus he passed through this afflicting tryal, and at length arrived at this place, on the 1st. day of the 2d. month 1697; though in much weakness, having been taken very ill of the belly ache and Flux at <HI>Augusteen,</HI> of which he never recovered, but still grew wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and worse, to his dying day. It was about the 8th. hour in the evening, when the <HI>Barkentine</HI> he was passenger in, arrived at this place: Divers Friends vvent on board, in order to get him ashoar, but he being in a very vveak condition, they could not remove him at that time. He declared
<Q>his great satisfaction, that the Lord had granted his request, that he might lay down his bones in this place; that his heart was strong, and he hoped he might first see <HI>Friends</HI> again at the Meeting. He made mention of the goodness of God to him, and that his presence had attend∣ed him in all his exercises.</Q></P>
<P>The next morning being the 2d. of the 2d. month, divers Friends went on board, to help the Vessel up to a Wharf, in order to get him on thoar, in which time he spake as before related, Gods Power attending him. About the 7th. hour, divers Friends carried him in a <HI>Hammocker</HI> (being wrapt up in a blanket and cloths to keep him warm) to the house of <HI>Samuel Carpenter</HI>▪ where he declared
<Q>the goodness of God to him, and that his heart w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s yet strong, and his memory and understanding good;</Q>

He further said,

<P><HI>He said,</HI>

And further he said severall times,
<Q>That in his late Afflictions, he had seen more of the wonders &amp; deal∣ings of the Lord, than ever he had seen before, or ever should have seen, if he had not gone through them, and that he felt the Lord with him, which did out bal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance all.</Q></P>
<P>Speaking of his patient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing his sufferings, and how he was supported by the Lords power under all, and of his
<PB REF="000863_0010_0FAC03A7308A73E0"/>
inquiry of the Lord about it, the Lords answer was: LET PATIENCE HAVE ITS PERFECT WORK. Speaking how sick he was at <HI>Iamaica</HI> for about twenty weeks,
<Q>yet <HI>(said he)</HI> I mist but one meeting.</Q>
He also said
<Q>That he desired of the Lord, that he might not dye by the hands of those <HI>Barbarians;</HI> For <HI>(said he)</HI> They thirsted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> much after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> flesh, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ever we did after Victuall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</Q></P>
<P>On the 2d. day of the 2d. month, some Friends co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing into the room to visit him at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of them he seemed to rejoice, and putting forth his hand, was ready to embrace them in much love, and in a very tender f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame of spirit. The Friends expressed their gladness to see him, but said, <HI>They were sorry to see him so very weak</HI>; to which he re∣plied,
<Q>Although my body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e weak, my mind is sound, and memory good:</Q>
And further said
<Q>The Lord hath been very good to me, all along unto this very d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and this morning hath sweetly refreshed me.</Q>
And further added,
<Q>The Lord hath answered my desire; for <HI>I</HI> desired content, and that I might come to this place, to lay my bones amongst you.</Q>
And afterwards said,
<Q>It is a good thing, to have a conscience void of offence, both towards God, and towards man.</Q></P>
<P>On the 4th. day of the 2d. month▪ being the 1st. day of the week, about the 5th. hour in the morning, he desired a Friend to write for him to his dear Wife,

<P>They returned to us, and We with our two Boats rowed all day without ceasing till Sunsetting: And when we putt on shoar, the place was an old <HI>Indian-Field</HI> on a high bleak hill, where had been a large <HI>Indian house,</HI> but it was tumbled down. Of the ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is of this house We made a shelter against the <HI>North-West</HI> Wind, which began to blow very bleak.

expecting that she and the <HI>Chilh</HI> should goe next. Poor <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> was a great way behind us: I feared We sould never see him again I used my en∣deavour to comfort and cheere my Wife, intreating her, not to let grief overcome her; I had hopes that the Lord would help us in this strait, as He hath done in many since We were in this Land: And if it plea∣sed God that We might lay down our lives in this Wil∣derniss, that We might beseech Him to enable us to do it willingly. Thus striving in a deep Exercise of Body and Mind We travelled on, admiring Gods goodness in preserving us thus farr through so many eminent Dangers. In the sence of which a secret hope would arise, (though involved with human doubts and fear) thar the Lord would yet preserve us. I took my Child from the Negroe and carried him. I had an <HI>Indian-Matt</HI> with a splitt in it, through which I putt my head, hanging over my Breast unto my Wast: Under this I carried my Child, which helpe't to break the wind off it; but the poor Babe was black with cold from head to foot, and its flesh as cold as a stone; yet it was not froward.

We carried her from the Waterside under

the Bank. This increased my Wife, a sorrow; and she began to doubt she should not be able to travell much further: But I endeavoured to incourage her not to leave striving as long as any ability was left. All our People were out of sight exept Four, and those We had gained upon. I sent my Negroe to overtake them, and to disire them to slacken their pace till we gott up with them; being in hopes that gaining their Com∣pany would to cheere up my Wife: But they would not; so the Negroe stopt for us. We had lost sight of <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> by this time: Soon after we overtook <HI>Iohn Smith</HI> who was one of the Four: he began to sail, and his Companions left him; whereupon he made grievous Complaints which I reproved him for, lest he should discourage my wife. The Sun was nigh Setting; and we began to look out for the sentinalls Post; and my Negroe at times gott upon severall of the highest Sand-hills to look out, but could not see any house, nor the smoak of Fire: This was terrible to us all, for the day being so cold, the night much more, and we not able to travell without rest, being a starved People both within our bodies and without, and if we ceased from travelling, we should instantly be nummed and move no further. In the midst of these Reasonings and doubtings We were gott into.

At length the <HI>Spaniards</HI> consent∣ed that <HI>Robert Barrow, I,</HI> my <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Child,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Smith</HI> should lye in the house; but to <HI>Ioseph Buck∣ley, Nathaniell Randall, Iohn Sheirs,</HI> and my <HI>Negroe London.</HI> They would not grant that favour: So one of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> taking a fire-brand bid those Four goe with him. He directed them to a small Thickett of <HI>Trees</HI> and shewed them to gather Wood and make large Fires and Sleep there. These poor creatures lay out, and it proved a hard Frosty Night.
