<P>TIS well known, that the late <HI>Me∣thods</HI> of this weekly and ancient LECTURE, have been, to insist first on the Affairs of a sincere CONVERSION, and then on the Duties of a pious CONVERSATION. Having dis∣patched the <HI>former,</HI> we are now entertaining

you with our ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Discourses and Directions on the latter. And you must Indulge me this Digression, that the fresh News of our <HI>Distress</HI> and <HI>Danger</HI> which within this fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and twenty Hours arrived unto us, have diverted my Thoughts to <HI>That</HI> which you may behold this Text pointing at.</P>
<P>I could not <HI>altogether hold my peace at this time,</HI> without observing, that we have as ma∣ny <HI>Duties</HI> as we hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Objects</HI> to be concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with. But as one of the <HI>Objects</HI> which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have before us, is, <HI>The People of God placed in very terrible Distress, and Danger</HI>; thus among the <HI>Duties</HI> then expected from us, none of the least Remarkable and Considerable is, <HI>The venturing of our All, in the service of that holy People.</HI> Such was the <HI>Object,</HI> and such the <HI>Duty</HI> which our Text refers unto. The peo∣ple of God, had their <HI>All</HI> now just <HI>going</HI> to be <HI>gone,</HI> and a great person is here called upon to venture <HI>All,</HI> for the service of this People that were thus Expiring.</P>
<P>The words now read, are a message sent by a Renowned <HI>Mordecai,</HI> to the Empress of the World. The whole Book of <HI>Esther</HI> is a commentary upon one Verse in the seven∣teenth of <HI>Exodus</HI>; and that part of it, which we are now u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, claims a particular s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are in the Exposition.

Remarks upon the blessed <HI>Mordecai,</HI> that we may <HI>feel</HI> whereabouts we are. Know then that <HI>Mordecai</HI> was a Famous, an Aged, and an Holy Jew. He had been carried into Cap∣tivity, with <HI>Ieconiah,</HI> above seventy years be∣fore. And he <HI>Returned</HI> to, and <HI>Resided</HI> at <HI>Ie∣rusalem,</HI> till the work of the <HI>Temple</HI> received its unhappy interruption: but then he <HI>Retired</HI> that he might serve his People in the Court of <HI>Ahashu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rus</HI> (who was also cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed <HI>Artax∣erxe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>) there: A very laudable Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mple!

<P>But our <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdecai</HI> gives a great affront un∣to one <HI>Haman,</HI> a Minion in the Court of <HI>Per∣sia.</HI> That <HI>Haman</HI> by his Brig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, had obtain∣ed from the Persian Emperour, a Commission a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Privil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dg to require a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re than common Reverence from the Courtiers then about the Palace. But this good man found it against his Conscience to tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such a notice of such a Mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reant.

greatly <HI>Abhorred</HI> by <HI>Israel</HI>; or which I rather Think, from <HI>This,</HI> That it was a <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Sacred</HI> Respect, which <HI>Haman</HI> did now require. Such was the respect which the haughty and impious Kings of <HI>Persia,</HI> would sometimes arrogate unto themselves; and they would sometimes impart the same unto their Para∣sites and Favourites. Had it been a meer civil respect which was here demanded, it would have been very <HI>superflu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> and well nigh <HI>ridiculous</HI> to have given express com∣mand unto all <HI>the Kings Servants that were in the Court</HI> concerning it; good manners were doubtless enough used there.

Such a check was given to the pride of <HI>Haman!</HI> Now the bloody Re∣venge of this Hellish Monster prompted him to pursue no meaner a satisf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction for this in∣dignity, than the utter <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tirpa∣tion,</HI> of the whole Nation which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was of: one Lark will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill the belly of such a <HI>Vultura.</HI> Besides he saw the whole Nation was of such <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Perswasions</HI> in R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ligion,

There is no Jewel, but that one of a never dying <HI>Soul,</HI> too valuable to be ventured, when God and His People is to be served. The first Lesson, the A. B.

<P>First, We must venture our <HI>Quiet,</HI> for the People of God. It was the Speech of a Gallant Man, in 2 Sam. 11.11. <HI>The Ark and Israel and Iudah abide in Tents, and my Lord Ioab, and the Servants of my Lord are Enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mped in the open fields; shall</HI> I <HI>then go into my house, to Eat and to Drink—I will not do this thing.</HI> Well said, thou brave <HI>Hero</HI>! May we in like manner scorn to Consult the Delights and Pleasures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our own Repose, when the Ser∣vice of God and His People shall call us forth. Many <HI>Pains,</HI> many <HI>Toyls,</HI> and all the uncom∣fortable Fatigues of <HI>Business,</HI> must be Encoun∣tred, without Reluctancies, when the People of God are to be served; and we should for∣sake
<PB N="12" REF="000537_0014_0FA6B46A06B27270"/>
our soft Beds, our full <HI>Tables,</HI> and our Fine <HI>Hous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> for the sake thereof. We should engage in the Service of our Genera∣tion, tho' there should be two <HI>Hankerchie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> which we are thereby necessitated unto the continual wearing of; One to wipe off the <HI>Sweat</HI> of Labour▪ and another to wipe off the <HI>Dirt</HI> of Reproach. We may not, for the Love of <HI>Ease,</HI> decline the doing of what is to be done for the Interest of God, and of His People.</P>
<P>Again, We must venture our <HI>Estate</HI> for the People of God. It is Recorded for the ever∣lasting Reputation of those well-disposed men, in 2 Cor. 8. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> deep Poverty, a∣bounded unto the Riches of Liberali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> or <HI>Sim∣plicity,</HI> as it may be rendred. Many persons can do nothing in a way of Service for the People of God, because they say, <HI>They are poor.</HI> Nay, but our extreamest <HI>Poverty</HI> should not hinder our <HI>Liberality,</HI> When God and His People are to be served with what we have▪ Whatever <HI>Simplicity</HI> the Wity and Crafty and Gripple Hold fasts of the World, may imagine in it. We should not grumble at a∣ny <HI>Expences</HI> which the Service of God and His People is to be maintained with; and tho' we have no more than <HI>Two Mites</HI> to give, we should part with more than <HI>One</HI> of them, rather than his Interest should meet
<PB N="13" REF="000537_0015_0FA6B46DC8BC34C0"/>
with any prejudice.</P>
<P>Furthermore, we must venture our <HI>Ho∣nour</HI> for the People of God. It was an Act for which <HI>Moses</HI> is for ever <HI>Honourable,</HI> in Heb 11.24, 25. <HI>He Refused to be called, The Son of</HI> Pharaohs Daughter, <HI>choosing rather to suffer Affliction, with the People of God.</HI> Tho' we may arise to never so much Grandeur, Dig∣nity, and Preferment, by overlooking the Service of God and His People, we should think <HI>Little</HI> of the <HI>Grandeur,</HI> and rather trample upon such Dignity and Preferment. Tho' our Titles may be, <HI>Reverend,</HI> or <HI>Wor∣shipful,</HI> or <HI>Honourable,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Rightly</HI> so too; nevertheless we should think it no <HI>Hu∣miliation</HI> to us, that the People of God m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st be served by us. We are swoln with the <HI>vainest Air,</HI> if we count our selves too B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gg to do what is bespoke for the Interest of those that we should be <HI>Benefactors</HI> unto, if we would not unworthily pretend to be <HI>Superi∣ours</HI> over them.</P>
<P>Moreover, we must venture our <HI>Friends</HI> for the people of God. The Lord General of <HI>Israel</HI> had a dear and a kind <HI>Brother,</HI> to whom nevertheless he said, as in 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10, 11, 12. <HI>Be of good Courage, let us play the men for our People: and the Lord do that which seemeth Him good.</HI> Tho it be a <HI>Brother,</HI> yea, and somewhat nearer than a <HI>Brother</HI> that we must
<PB N="14" REF="000537_0016_0FA6B47193817050"/>
part withal, for the Service of God and His People, yet we must be willing to take o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r leave of such Rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions. It was a very com∣mendable Bravery in that Father, who having had <HI>six</HI> lovely and loving <HI>Sons</HI> kil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Service of the Public, brought out a <HI>seventh,</HI> even the Staff of his o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Age,</HI> unto the Press-Masters, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id <HI>Here I have one Son more▪ take him too; this cause is w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth them all.</HI> Sup∣pose we have a <HI>Benjamin</HI> with us, which we dote so much upon, that ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gray hairs do with <HI>sad hearts</HI> tremble at his departure from us: yet <HI>Benjamin</HI> too mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t go, if the service of our <HI>Ioseph,</HI> our Jesus have occasion for him. There are many persons, who have brought very bitter, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful, dolef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Miseries upon their <HI>Children,</HI> by detaining them from the Service of Gods People, when some hazard has ap∣peared in it. Let us count the very best of our <HI>Friends,</HI> never better bestowed, than in such a <HI>Service</HI> as may be reputed a <HI>Friendship</HI> to the Interest of God.</P>
<P>All that I have hitherto asked for, is but a <HI>Small Venture</HI>; there is <HI>One</HI> more that we are to make.</P>
<P>Finally then, We are to venture our very LIVES for the People of God, when they can't be brought out of <HI>Distress</HI> and <HI>Danger</HI> without the venture of our <HI>Lives.</HI> 'Tis what we are summoned unto in 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to lay down our Lives for the Brethren.</HI> If an Heathen <HI>Py<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ades</HI> and <HI>Orestes</HI> could not think their <HI>Lives</HI> too large a price for each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thers <HI>Peace,</HI> what <HI>Life</HI> should be too much to be Sacrificed for the <HI>Peace</HI> of a People which God counts <HI>His own?</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us. <HI>For a good man one would even dare to Dy</HI> and hee saw it when an <HI>A∣quil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Priscilla</HI> were so ready to Dy for <HI>him.</HI> If a <HI>good Person</HI> be so valuable, What can then bee too much for a <HI>Good People</HI> of the Lord? When <HI>Aaron,</HI> when <HI>David,</HI> beheld a Destroying Evil breaking in upon the People of God, they carr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed their <HI>Liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> to keep it off.

The Service of God and His People should make us to say, as the Martyr once, <HI>If every Hair of my Head were a Man, they should all be Sacrificed in this Glorious cause.</HI></P>
<P>These are <HI>Ventures</HI> that we should none of us be Backward unto. But our Second Que∣stion then Enquires.</P>
<P>Why are such Ventures to be made▪ for the People of God, when a Pressing Time cal∣leth for them.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="000537_0018_0FA6B476C4EA7BE0"/>Briefly, We ow our <HI>All</HI> unto the <HI>People</HI> of God.

<P>First, The <HI>Order</HI> of God Empowers the <HI>People</HI> of God, to call for it. We are <HI>His</HI> by <HI>Creation. He has made us and not we our selves</HI> We are <HI>His</HI> by <HI>Redemption</HI>▪ He has <HI>Bought us and not for our selves.</HI> Our God says unto us, as in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.19. <HI>Ye are not your own.</HI> That which He has done for us, ob∣liges us to say unto <HI>Him</HI> devoutly what the Prince of old foolishly said unto another, I <HI>am thine, and all that</HI> I <HI>have.</HI> Shall I not add, That we are <HI>His</HI> by <HI>Profession</HI> too?

<P>Secondly, The <HI>Design</HI> of God likewise Em∣powers them to call for it.

<P>Moreover, after the Example of <HI>Pious Rulers</HI> commended in Sacred Writ; the <HI>Churches</HI> every where are hereby advised to give utmost Encouragement unto the
