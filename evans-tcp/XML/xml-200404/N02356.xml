<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>IT is one part of our Honour and Happiness in this Country, among the many difficulties and troubles which have attended the Settlements and growth of it unto this day, that there have not been w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nting from time to time honest and worthy <HI>Persons,</HI> and some learned, who have delivered down to Poste∣rity a plain and true account of the <HI>Wars</HI> which we have had with the <HI>Indian Natives</HI> in one part of the Land and in another.</P>
<P>We owe much unto <HI>Those</HI> who have done us this Service from the beginning, and they have herein served God, as well as obliged the World. For it al∣ways has been, and ever is like to be a grateful thing to Mankind to be informed of the rise and growth of <HI>Provinces,</HI> and of the sufferings of their feeble infant state: And from the days of <HI>Moses,</HI> who wrote the first <HI>History,</HI> the beginning of the World, and of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> the wise and pious among Men have scarce known a more sacred Pleasure, nor found a more profi∣table Entertainment, than in tracing the footsteps and windings of Divine Providence, in the planting of <HI>Colonies</HI> and <HI>Churches,</HI> here and there, thro' the Earth.</P>
<P>Nor let it seem vain in me to say, that in the set∣tlement of the <HI>New-England</HI> Churches and Provinces, there have been some Circumstances so like unto those of <HI>Israel</HI> of old, (after their entrance into <HI>Canaan</HI>) that I am p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rswaded no People of God under Heaven, can sing of his Merci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Iudgment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the <HI>inspired

Phrase</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>70 and 80 Psalms, and part of 105 106 and 107 Psalms.</HI></NOTE> with more direct and pertinent self Applica∣tion, than we can do. The subject of the following <HI>Book</HI> affords us the most special <HI>Instance</HI> hereof; Namely, that altho' our Merciful and Gracious God did in a wonderful manner, <HI>cast out the Heathen</HI> before our Fathers, and <HI>Planted them; prepared also a room before them, and caused them to take deep root, and to fill the Land;</HI> So that <HI>the Vine hath sent out her Boughs unto the Sea, and her Bran∣ches upon the River;</HI> Yet to <HI>humbly and prove us,</HI> and for our Sins to punish us, the Righteous God hath left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sufficient Number of the fierce and barbarous <HI>Sal∣vages</HI> on our borders, to be <HI>pricks in our Eyes,</HI> and <HI>thorns in our sides,</HI> and they have been and are like the <HI>Boar of the Woods to waste us, and the wild Beasts of the field to devour us.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, on Principles both humane and religious, I gladly introduce the following <HI>Memoirs</HI> to the publick view, with my hearty thanks to the <HI>Honourable Au∣thor</HI> for the great pains he has taken (among other his publick Services) to transmit these Particulars of the <HI>two last Wars</HI> with the Indian Enemy down to Poste∣rity, <HI>That the Generation to come might know them, and set their hope in God, and not forget his Works, but keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Reader</HI> must not expect much Entertainment or Curiosity in the story of a <HI>barbarous War</HI> with cruel and perfidious <HI>Salvages</HI>: It is the benefit of <HI>Posterity,</HI> in a religious Improvement of this dry and bloody Story, that we aim at, in preserving some Remembrance there∣of: And that in times to come, when we are dead and forgotten, <HI>Materials may remain for a continued &amp;
<PB N="iii" REF="002796_0003_0FE63A8A6E448B20"/>
entire History of our Country:</HI> And we hope that they who come after us will take the like Care in their Times for the Children which shall be born.</P>
<P>Let it suffice in praise of the <HI>Narrative,</HI> if the Facts related be true and exact, and that the Style be familiar, plain and easy, as all <HI>Historical Memoirs</HI> should be writ. As to the Truth of it, none (I suppose) will have any doubt to whom the <HI>Author</HI> is known; and to whom among us is he not known? Or by whom among the lovers of the Country is he not esteemed for his af∣fectionate regards unto the religious and civil Liberties of it?</P>
<P>The Reverend Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> wrote the <HI>Remarkables of the Eastern War</HI> before this, from the year <HI>1688.</HI> unto the year <HI>1698. ten</HI> years, wherefore he called his Book, <HI>Decennium Luctuosum.</HI> This Book may claim the like <HI>Title,</HI> for the first War here related, from <HI>Au∣gust</HI> the <HI>10</HI>th <HI>1703.</HI> to the <HI>13</HI>th of <HI>July 1713.</HI> did also continue just <HI>ten</HI> years.</P>
<P>To these <HI>ten</HI> years of Trouble and Distress the <HI>Au∣thor</HI> has added an Account of another but shorter War of <HI>three</HI> years, from <HI>July 25. 1722.</HI> to <HI>December 15. 1725.</HI> When the <HI>Salvages</HI> by their <HI>Delegates</HI> re∣new'd their Submission, and signed Articles of Peace in the Council-Chamber in <HI>Boston;</HI> for the lasting effects whereof we are humbly waiting on a Gracious GOD with our earnest Prayers. And we owe abundant <HI>Praises</HI> to his Holy Name for the great <HI>Successes,</HI> with which he has been pleased to crown the <HI>Counsels</HI> and <HI>Arms</HI> of the <HI>Province</HI> in this <HI>last</HI> short <HI>War;</HI> to the humbling the insolent Enemy and bringing them so soon to sue for the Peace which they had broken. <HI>Not unto us, O LORD! not to us; but to thy Name give Glory; for thy Mercy and for thy Truth sake!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="002796_0004_0FE63A8C64D759C8"/>In a special manner, the wonderful <HI>Victory</HI> obtained <HI>August 12. 1724.</HI> over the bold and Bloody <HI>Tribe</HI> at <HI>Narridgwalk,</HI> and their sudden Destruction that Me∣morable Day, was the singular Work of GOD; And the <HI>Officers</HI> and Soldiers piously put far from themselves the Honour of it. The plain hand of <HI>Providence</HI> and not their own Conduct <HI>facilitated</HI> and quickned their March. God sent 'em timely <HI>Information</HI> where the <HI>Indians</HI> had plac'd their Guards upon the River, that they might shun them, and so come upon the Town un∣discovered. God brought them on it in a right <HI>time,</HI> when the fighting Men were just come in from abroad, and the next day (we are told) they were to have come down on our <HI>Frontiers.</HI> They were <HI>surpris'd</HI> in the height of security, and so <HI>amaz'd</HI> that they could not find their hands when they would have escaped. This Destruction of the Enemy was with the loss of only <HI>one</HI> life, and <HI>two</HI> wounded, on our part. And <HI>he</HI> who was the <HI>Father</HI> of the War, the <HI>Ghostly Father</HI> of those perfidious Salvages, like <HI>Balaam the Son of Beor,</HI> was <HI>slain</HI> among the Enemy, after his vain Endeavours to <HI>Curse</HI> us.</P>
<P>May those singular <HI>Favours</HI> of GOD have their <HI>saving Effects</HI> on us! and his <HI>goodness</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the present fruits of <HI>Peace</HI> which we are about to reap <HI>lead us to Repentance,</HI> bind us to Obedience, raise us in Devotion, and endear his blessed Name and Truths and Ways to us. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>THE keeping a <HI>Register of Memorable Oc∣currences,</HI> as it has been the practice of former Ages, so it ought to be con∣tinued for the advantage of Posterity: And in as much as the <HI>Divine Providence</HI> has pla∣ced me near the Seat of Action, where I have had greater Opportunities than many others of remarking the Cruelty and Perfidy of the <HI>Indian</HI> Enemy, I thought it my Duty to keep a Record thereof. Not that at first I design'd to make these <HI>Memoirs</HI> publick but now am perswaded to it by some whose Judgment I pay a deference unto. In the collecting them, I have us'd all faithful∣ness; and have been assisted therein not only from the Abstracts of Original Letters, but from Persons of the best Credit and Reputation, and yet doubtless some small Occurences may have slipt my knowledge.</P>
<P>I might with <HI>Orosius</HI> very justly entitle this His∣tory <HI>De miseria hominum,</HI> being no other then a Narrative of <HI>Tragical Incursions</HI> perpetrated by Bloody <HI>Pagans,</HI> who are Monsters of such Cruel∣ty, that the words of <HI>Virgil</HI> may not unaptly be apply'd to them.</P>
<Q><L>Tristius haud illis monstrum, nec Savior ulla</L>

<P>Who are as implacable in their Revenge, as they are terrible in the Execution of it; and will convey it down to the third and fourth Generati∣on. No Courtesy will ever oblige them to grati∣tude; for their greatest Benefactors have fre∣quently fall'n as Victtims to their Fury.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Spectacles</HI> of old were very lively in
<PB REF="002796_0005_0FE63A8C66F71130"/>
them tepeated. God has made them a terrible Scourge for the punishment of our Sins. And probably that very Sin of ours in neglecting the welfare of their <HI>Souls.</HI> For <HI>we</HI> have not expressed the like laudable Care for them, as hath been done in the <HI>Southern</HI> and <HI>Western</HI> parts of the Country. But indeed we have rather aimed to advance a private Trade, then to instruct them in the Principles of true Religion. This brings to my remembrance a remarkable saying of one of their Chief <HI>Sachems,</HI> whom (a little before the War broke out) I asked, Wherefore it was they were so much bigoted to the <HI>French</HI>? Consider∣ing their Traffick with them was not so advan∣tageous as with the <HI>English.</HI> He gravely reply'd, <HI>That the Friars taught them to Pray, but the Eng∣lish never did.</HI></P>
<P>And it is also remarkably observable that a∣mong all the <HI>Settlements</HI> and <HI>Towns</HI> of Figure and Distinction, not one of them have been utterly destroy'd where ever a <HI>Church</HI> was gathered.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>Eastern parts</HI> have been remiss, this should no ways detract from the praise of that in∣comparable zeal of the Venerable Mr. <HI>Elliot,</HI> and the indesatigable Pains which the renown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Mr. <HI>Mayhew,</HI> and others, have exercised in the In∣struction and Conversion of the <HI>Natives</HI> in their parts: wherein they were so far Successful (thro' the Blessing of God) as to form many Churches of Baptiz'd <HI>Indians</HI>; and to gather many Assem∣blys of <HI>Catechumens,</HI> that profess the Name of <HI>Christ</HI>; which remain to this day the Fruit and Reward of their Labours, will bespeak their <HI>Praise</HI> to future Ages, and the <HI>Thanksgiving of ma∣ny to GOD.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of the Wars of <HI>New-England,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is storied of <HI>Tissaphernes,</HI> That so soon as he entred into a League with <HI>Agesilaus</HI> King of <HI>Sparta,</HI> he studied means where∣by to infringe and violate the same: Upon which <HI>Agesilaus</HI> sent his Ambassadors unto him to return him Thanks, that by so doing he had made the Gods his Enemies. Now considering the League that has been solem∣nized with the <HI>Indians,</HI> together with their Cru∣elty and Treachery so notoriously perpetrated, it's no wonder if in the sequel of this History, we find them under some signal Remark of the Divine Displeasure.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002796_0006_0FE63A9860282D80"/>NOT that I am unsensible that many have stig∣matiz'd the <HI>English</HI> as chiefly culpable in causing the first Breach between them and us; by invad∣ing their Properties, and defrauding them in their Dealings: But to censure the Publick for the sinister Actions of a few private Persons, is utterly repugnant to Reason and Equity. Espe∣cially considering the great Care that the <HI>Legi∣slative</HI> Power had taken to protect the <HI>Natives,</HI> and their Interests.</P>
<P>WHAT hath formerly occur'd of this kind is none of my business to discant upon here; but as to the Infraction which I am about to make mention of, I never yet heard the least Word in their favour, but all sorts of Persons do condemn their Perfidy.</P>
<P>AT the arrival of Governour <HI>Dudley</HI> in the Year 1702. the whole Body of <HI>Indians</HI> was in a to∣lerable good Frame and Temper; but being ani∣mated by the <HI>French,</HI> they soon began to threaten and insult the <HI>English:</HI> Upon which in the suc∣ceeding Year <HI>Iune</HI> the 20th. a <HI>Congress</HI> was appoin∣ted at <HI>Casco,</HI> where the Chiefs of the several <HI>Tribes</HI> met,
viz. Mauxis, <HI>and</HI> Hopehood <HI>from</HI> Naridgewalk, Wanungunt, <HI>&amp;</HI> Wanadugunbuent <HI>from</HI> Penobscot, Wattanamunton, Adiawando <HI>and</HI> Hegen <HI>from</HI> Pennecook, <HI>and</HI> Pigwacket.</P>
<P><HI>Mesambomett,</HI> and <HI>Wexar,</HI> from <HI>Amasconty,</HI> with about 250 Men in 65 Canoos, well arm'd, and mostly <HI>painted</HI> with variety of Colours, which seemingly were affable and kind, and yet in some Instances gave cause of jealousy.</P>
<P>A <HI>Tent</HI> being fixt for entertaining the <HI>Governour</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002796_0006_0FE63A9860282D80"/>
and Gentlemen who accompanied him, together with the <HI>Sagamores</HI>; His Excellency very kindly saluted them, saying,
<Q>That as he was Com∣missionated by the Great and Victorious <HI>Queen of England,</HI> he came to visit them as his <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> and to reconcile whatever Dif∣ferences had hapned since the last <HI>Treaty.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AT this they made a pause, but after a short Intermission Captain <HI>Simmo,</HI> who was their Ora∣tor arose, and said,
<Q>That they acknowledged his Favour in giving them a Visit at such a juncture, with so many of the <HI>Council</HI> and Gen∣tlemen of both <HI>Provinces</HI>; assuring him, that they aimed at nothing more than <HI>Peace</HI>; and that as high as the <HI>Sun</HI> was above the Earth, so far distant should their Designs be of mak∣ing the least breach between each other.</Q>
And as a Testimony thereof they presented him a Belt of <HI>Wampam,</HI> and invited him to the <HI>Two Pillars</HI> of Stones, which at a former Treaty were erected, and called by the significant Name of the TWO BROTHERS; unto which both Par∣ties went, and added a greater Number of Stones.</P>
<P>THIS Ceremony being performed, several Volleys were discharged on each side; and the <HI>Indians</HI> added their usual dancing, singing, and loud acclamations of Joy. <HI>Trading-houses</HI> in seve∣ral places were hereupon engaged; and that the Price of Commodities should be stated, and an <HI>Armourer</HI> fixed at the publick Charge: Many <HI>Presents</HI> were also made them, which they kindly received; so that every thing lookt with a pro∣mising Aspect of a settled Peace: And that which afterward seem'd to confirm it, was the coming
<PB N="4" REF="002796_0007_0FE63A986252C228"/>
in of Captain <HI>Bomas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en,</HI> and Captain <HI>Samuel,</HI> who informed, that several <HI>Missionaries</HI> from the <HI>Fryars</HI> were lately come among them, who endeavour∣ed to break the Union, and seduce them from their Allegiance to the Crown of <HI>England</HI>; but had made no Impression on them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or that they were <HI>as firm as the Mountains,</HI> and should conti∣nue so, as long as the Sun and Moon endured.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Eastern</HI> Inhabitants, who before had thoughts of removing, were now encouraged to stand their Ground; several more were also pre∣paring to settle among them, partly from the fertility of the Soil, the plenty of Timber, the advantage of Fishery, and several other Induce∣ments. But I should have taken notice of <HI>two</HI> Instances in the late Treaty, wherein the match∣less Perfidy of these bloody Infidels did notori∣ously appear. 1<HI>st.</HI> As the Treaty was concluded with Volleys on both sides, as I said before, the <HI>Indians</HI> desired the <HI>English</HI> to fire first, which they readily did, concluding it no other but a Com∣plement; but so soon as the <HI>Indians</HI> fired, it was observ'd that their Guns were charg'd with Bul∣lets; having contrived (as was afterwards con∣firm'd) to make the <HI>English</HI> the Victims of that Day. But Providence so order'd it, as to place their chief Counsellours and <HI>Sachems</HI> in the Tent where ours were seated, by which means they could not destroy one without endangering the other▪ 2. As the <HI>English</HI> waited some Days for <HI>Watanummon</HI> (the <HI>Pigwacket Sachem</HI>) to compleat their Council, it was afterward discovered▪ that they only tarried for a Reinforcement of 200 <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who in three Days after we
<PB N="5" REF="002796_0007_0FE63A986252C228"/>
returned came among them; having resolved to seize the Governour, Council and Gentlemen, and then to Sacrifice the Inhabitants at pleasure; which probably they might have done, had they not been prevented by an overuling Power.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding this Disappointment, they were still resolved on their bloody <HI>Design:</HI> For within six Weeks after the whole <HI>Eastern</HI> Coun∣try was in a Conflagration, no House standing, nor Garrison unattackt. <HI>August</HI> 10th at nine in the Morning they began their bloody <HI>Tragedy,</HI> being about five hundred <HI>Indians</HI> of all sorts, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a number of <HI>French</HI>; who divided themselves in∣to several Companies, and made a Descent on the several Inhabitants from <HI>Casco</HI> to <HI>Wells</HI> at one and the same time, sparing none of every Age or Sex.</P>
<P>AS the milk white Brows of the Grave and <HI>Ancient</HI> had no respect shown; so neither had the mournful cries of tender <HI>Infants</HI> the least pity; for they triumph'd at their Misery, and applaud∣ed such as the skilfullest Artists, who were most dexterous in contriving the greatest Tortures; which was enough to turn the most <HI>Stoical Apathie</HI> into Streams of mournful Sympathy and Compas∣sion.</P>
<P>THE Town of <HI>Wells,</HI> which valiantly stood its Ground both in the former and latter War, suffered now great Spoil, nor could escape with∣out the loss of 39 that were kill'd and taken.</P>
<P><HI>Cape-Porposs</HI> being inhabited only by a few Fishermen, was wholly laid desolate. But the Garrison at <HI>Winter-Harbour</HI> defended itself with much Bravery; yet it was at last overpowered
<PB N="6" REF="002796_0008_0FE63A9968DCF7D0"/>
by Force, and then submitted on Terms</P>
<P><HI>Saco-Fort</HI> was also attackt by the Enemy with great Fury; they kill'd eleven, and carried twen∣ty four Captive.</P>
<P><HI>Spurwink,</HI> which was principally inhabited by the <HI>Iordans,</HI> had no less than twenty two of that Family kill'd and taken.</P>
<P>THOSE at <HI>Scarborough</HI> were mostly in Garri∣son, whom the <HI>Indians</HI> not willing to encounter, sent a <HI>Captive</HI> before with a Flag of Truce; but the <HI>Officer</HI> being acquainted with their Intreagues, slighted the Message, secured the Captive, and made a vigorous Defence. However, by a long Siege they were so reduced, that had not Re∣cruits been sent them, they had utterly been o∣verthrown.</P>
<P><HI>Perpooduck</HI> was of all places (for number) the greatest sufferers, being but nine Families, and no Garrison to retire unto; neither any Men at home, where they took eight, and inhumanly butchered twenty five; among whom was the Wife of <HI>Michael Webber,</HI> who being big with Child, they knockt her on the head, and ript open her Womb, cutting one part of the Child out; a Spectacle of horrid Barbarity.</P>
<P><HI>Casco,</HI> which was the utmost Frontier, com∣manded by Major <HI>March,</HI> who was all this while unsensible of the Spoil that the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dians</HI> had done, was saluted by <HI>Mauxis, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anungonet,</HI> and <HI>Assacom∣buit,</HI> three of their most valiant and puissant <HI>Sa∣chems.</HI> They gradually advanced with a Flag of Truce, and sent one before them to signify that they had matter of moment to impart to
<PB N="7" REF="002796_0008_0FE63A9968DCF7D0"/>
him. At first he slighted the Message, but on second Thoughts went out to meet them; they seeming to him but few in number, and unarm∣ed: However he ordered two or three Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>s to be ready in case of Danger. Their Voice to him at first seem'd like the Voice of <HI>Iacob,</HI> but their Hands were like the Hands of <HI>Esau: With their Tongues they used deceit, and the Poison of Asps was under their Lips.</HI> For no sooner had they sa∣luted him, but with Hatchets under their Mantles they violently assaulted him; having a number that lay in Ambush near them, who shot down one of his Guards: But being a Person of un∣common Strength, as well as Courage, he soon wrested a Hatchet from one of them, with which he did good Execution: Yet if Sergeant <HI>Hook</HI> (with a file of Ten from the Fort) had not spee∣dily succoured him, they would soon have over∣powered him. Mr. <HI>Phippeny</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kent,</HI> who accompanied him, were attackt by others, and soon fell by their Fury; for being advanced in Years, they were so infirm, that I might say of them as <HI>Iuvenal</HI> did of <HI>Priam,</HI> They had scarce Blood enough left to tinge the Knife of the Sa∣crifice.</P>
<P>THE Enemy being defeated in this their De∣sign, fell upon the several Cottages which lay round, and destroyed all they could. But the Major on rallying his Men together, seeing no∣thing but Fire and Smoak, divided them into three parts, which were twelve in each, and in∣terchanged them every two Hours, who thus continued six Days an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nights with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the least Intermission; by which time the whole Bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of

<P>ON <HI>Tuesday</HI> after Capt. <HI>Tom,</HI> with thirty <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a descent on <HI>Hampton</HI> Village, where they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew four, besides the Widow <HI>Mussey,</HI> who was a remarkable speaking <HI>Quaker,</HI> and much lamented by that Sect. They also rifled two Houses near the Garrison, but fearing a pursuit, drew off; it being generally observed, that they seldom annoy but by surprize.</P>
<P>BY this time Capt. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummersby</HI> was ordered with his Troop to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Wadley</HI> to <HI>Wells</HI> with the like Company of <HI>Dragoons</HI>; many concluding that the <HI>Eastern</HI> parts would be the seat of Action; and yet a few Days after, Advice was brought from <HI>Deerfield,</HI> (as a fore∣runner of some greater Evil) of two Men taken and carried to <HI>Canada</HI>; which so alarm'd the Country, to see the Frontiers insulted two hun∣dred Miles in length, that on <HI>September</HI> 26th. the Governour ordered 360 Men to <HI>Pigwacket,</HI> one of their principal Head-quarters: But thro' the difficulty of the Passage, and unskilfulness of the
<PB N="9" REF="002796_0009_0FE63A996B168868"/>
Guides, they return'd without any Discovery.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Davis</HI> at the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e time had the like misfortune, who went to the Ponds, but it seem'd the Enemy went <HI>Eastward</HI>: For on the 6th of <HI>Oc∣tober,</HI> Capt. <HI>Hunnuell</HI> with ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eteen Men, as they were going to work in their Meadows at <HI>Black-point,</HI> were way-laid by two hundred <HI>Indians,</HI> who at one stroke kill'd and took the whole body Ex∣cepting one, who like <HI>Iob's Messenger</HI> was pre∣served to give the Melancholy Account thereof. Upon this they attack't the <HI>Fort,</HI> where only Eight Men were left under the Command of Lieu. <HI>Wyat,</HI> who by the encouragement of Capt. <HI>Willard,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Wells,</HI> that were there in two Sloops stood their Ground some time, but being afterward dispirited they went on board Capt. <HI>Wells,</HI> and the Enemy set the deserted Garrison on fire.</P>
<P>Another Company of <HI>Indians</HI> commanded by <HI>Sampson</HI> fell on <HI>York,</HI> where they slew <HI>Arthur Brandon</HI>'s Wife and five Children, carrying Cap∣tive with them the Widow <HI>Parsons</HI> and her Daughter.</P>
<P>The former attempt on <HI>Pigwackett</HI> proving un∣successful, Collonel <HI>March</HI> went a second time with the like number of Men, where he kill'd six <HI>Indians</HI> and took as many more with some plun∣der, which was the <HI>first Reprisal</HI> that we made; but the Enemy dispersing into small parties, did much more mischief then in larger; which put the Country into a far greater Confusion, in somuch that there was no safety to him that went out, nor unto him that came in, but dreadful Ca∣lamity on every side.</P>

<L>— Terror ubique tremor —</L></Q>
<P>At <HI>Berwick</HI> they ambusht five, and as the store Ship was entring <HI>Casco,</HI> they entertained them so unexpectedly with a Volley of Shot, that the Master with three more were Slain, and two in the Boat wounded.</P>
<P>The <HI>General Assembly</HI> being sensibly affected with the state of matters, and dispos'd to a Vigo∣rous prosecution of the War, enacted, That <HI>Forty Pounds</HI> should be given for every <HI>Indian Scalp,</HI> which prompted some, and animated others to a noble Emulation. Capt. <HI>Ting</HI> was the first that embraced the tender, who in the depth of Win∣ter, went to their head quarters, and got five, for which he received two hundred Pounds. Major <HI>Hilton</HI> also with five Companies more made the like Essay, and so did Capt. <HI>Stephens,</HI> but return∣ed with no other Lawrel than the safety of them∣selves and Company.</P>
<P>The Enemy went on daring and successful. They frequently followed the tracts of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Men in their Marches: At <HI>Berwick</HI> they kill'd one, wounded another, and burnt two Houses. After that they made a descent on <HI>Andrew Neals</HI> Garri∣son, where they were vigorously repuls'd by Capt. <HI>Brown,</HI> who kill'd nine on the spot and wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any more, which so enraged those Wretches, that at their return they executed their revenge on <HI>Ioseph Ring</HI> who was then a Cap∣tive among them, whom they fastned to a Stake and burnt alive; barbarously shouting and re∣joycing at his cries.</P>
<P>February 8th. <HI>Ioseph Bradleys</HI> Garrison of <HI>Haverhil</HI> was unhappily surpriz'd▪ by a small Scout, who sculking at a distance, and seeing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="11" REF="002796_0010_0FE63AA568872AF8"/>
Gates open and none on the Sentry, rushed in and became Masters thereof. The <HI>Housewife</HI> per∣ceiving the Misery that was attending her, and having boiling Soap on the Fire, scalded one of them to Death. The Sentinel within was slain, and she with several others were taken; which was the second time of her Captivity. But that which heightned her Affliction was being with Child, and yet oblig'd to travel in a deep Snow, under a heavy Burden, and many Days toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her without Subsistance, excepting a few bits of Skin, Ground-nuts, Bark of Trees, wild Onions, and Lilly Roots. Nevertheless she was wonderfully supported, and at last safely delivered; but the Babe soon perisht for want of Nourishmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and by the Cruelty of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who as it cry'd, threw hot Embers in its Mouth. After a Years Bondage she was sold to the <HI>French</HI> for eighty Livers, and then redeemed by her Husband.</P>
<P>THE Use of <HI>Snow-shoes</HI> appearing very requi∣site for marching in the Winter Season, occasion∣ed an Act in both <HI>Provinces</HI> for supplying the Frontiers therewith: And this Season, which before was dreaded as most hazardous, was now the time of greatest safety, and of less difficulty in travelling.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Southern</HI> Parts not thinking them∣selves in so much Danger, did in a little time be∣come secure, which the Enemy taking notice of, fell on <HI>Deerfield,</HI> of which the Reverend Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> gave me the following Account. That Collonel <HI>Schuyler,</HI> who was always a kind and faithful Intelligencer, gave timely warning there∣of, which awaken'd some, but was slighted by
<PB N="12" REF="002796_0011_0FE63AA587D45948"/>
others: However, Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> the worthy Pa∣stor of that Place, was strongly possest that the Town would in a little time be destroyed; sig∣nifying as much in his publick Ministry, and private Conference; and could not be satisfied till he had got twenty Soldiers to be posted there. A few Nights before the Assault was, they were strangely amused, by a trampling Noise round the Fort, as if it were beset by <HI>In∣dians.</HI> Towards Morning, being <HI>February</HI> 29th. the Enemy sent Scouts to discover the posture of the Town, who observing the Watch walking in the Streets, returned and put them to a stand: A while after they sent again, and were advised, that all was then still and quiet: Upon which, two hours before Day, they attackt the Fort, and by the advantage of some drifts of Snow, got over the Walls. The whole Body was above two hundred and fifty, under the Command of Monsieur <HI>Arteil,</HI> who found the People fast asleep and easily secured them. The most considerable part of the Town thus fell into their Hands. They left no Garrison unattackt, excepting that of Capt. <HI>Wells</HI>; But at <HI>Benoni Stebbins</HI>'s they met with some repulse, and lost several. Sixty of the <HI>English</HI> fell, whereof many were stifled in a Cel∣ler; and a hundred were taken Captive, who with a melancholly Countenance condoled each other's Misery, yet durst not express the Anguish of their Souls. That Day and Night were spent in plundering, burning and destroying. The next Morning they withdrew into the Woods, car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying with them their Plunder and Capti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; among whom was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Reverend Mr. <HI>William<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>

(before mentioned) whose Sufferings, with his Neighbours, through a deep Snow, over moun∣tainous Desarts, were exceeding great; besides many Trials and Fears which they laboured un∣der.</P>
<P>The Country being alarm'd, several hastned to their Relief; about thirty of those which first came, charged the Enemy in the rear, and being strengthned with a further Supply, pursued them with good Success; but the Enemy returning, and being much superiour in Number, kill'd nine of ours in the Skirmish.</P>
<P>The Day after there was a considerable Con∣fluence from the lower Towns, as well as from the County of <HI>Hartford,</HI> but for want of <HI>Snow-shoes,</HI> were unable to pursue them. Some of our Captives then in <HI>Canada,</HI> knowing the Enterprize that was on Foot, sent several Letters unto their Friends, which the Enemy did carefully put into a Bag, and hung it upon the limb of a Tree in the high-way; which Letters were afterwards found, and gave Satisfaction of those that were then alive among them.</P>
<P>While the <HI>Indians</HI> by Land were every way distressing of us, the <HI>French</HI> by Sea were as in∣dustrious to impoverish us.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 7th. 1704. they fitted out a <HI>Privateer Shallop</HI> with twenty seven Men, to intercept our <HI>Southern</HI> Trade as they came laden with Provisi∣ons; which if they had succeeded in, would not only have supplied their own indigent Forces, but the <HI>Indians</HI> also; (who were then forming a desperate Design against us) But thro' the favour of God to us, they were cast away on <HI>Plimouth</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="002796_0012_0FE63AA7987B0B48"/>
Shore. A like signal Favour to us was the taking a <HI>Store-Ship</HI> of theirs (by our <HI>Virginia</HI> Fleet) of Forty Guns, bound to <HI>Canada,</HI> in which were twenty Officers, two thousand small Arms, with Ammunition answerable; besides a vast number of Crucifixes, and Presents of a greater value for encouraging the <HI>Indians</HI> in acts of Hostility against the <HI>English.</HI> In the Engagement their General was slain, the only Man that fell in Battle, by whose Interest those <HI>Stores</HI> were procured; which loss was so affecting, that (as some of our Cap∣tives afterwards reported) it caused a deep Hu∣miliation throughout <HI>Canada</HI> a considerable time after.</P>
<P>As the Spring advanced, it was thought neces∣sary to guard the Frontiers with fresh Troops, upon which Major <HI>Mason</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> five of the <HI>Pequod,</HI> and <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egan</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ber∣wick,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first were very terrifying to the E∣nemy: Yet frequent assaults were afterwards made at a littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Distance, as on <HI>April</HI> 25th. <HI>Na∣thaniel Meador</HI> was shot while at work in his Field. They mangled his dead Corps after a barbarous manner. Next day they kill'd <HI>Edward Taylor</HI> near <HI>Lampreel River,</HI> and after that took his <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Son</HI> whom they carried to <HI>Canada,</HI> and she was afterwards redeemed. From thence they went to <HI>Cochecho,</HI> expecting to have made Mr. <HI>Waldron</HI> the Victim of that Day; but being happi∣ly from home, they miss't their aim. However they surpriz'd a Servant of his, as she went to the Well for Water, whom (after they had examin∣ed concerning her Master, the State of the Garri∣son, and other Affairs) they knockt on the head,
<PB N="15" REF="002796_0012_0FE63AA7987B0B48"/>
but the Stroke not proving fatal, she afterwards recovered.</P>
<P>After this several were assaulted in the Road to <HI>Wells,</HI> whereof two were kill'd, one taken, and a∣nother made his Escape.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 13th. an Express came from <HI>North Hamp∣ton,</HI> advising, that about break of Day a Company of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> fell on a fortified House at <HI>Pascomuck,</HI> where no watch being kept, the Peo∣ple were alarm'd in their beds by the noise of the Enemy's rushing on the house; and before the Inhabitants could rise, the <HI>Indians</HI> had got their Guns thro' the <HI>Port-holes,</HI> and shot those that first appeared, killing some and wounding others. The surprized People made what resistance they could, firing briskly on the Enemy; but the house being soon set on fire, they were forc'd to yield them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>soners. The Enemy soon drew off, but fearing a pursuit, dismist one of the wound∣ed, with this Caution, that if the <HI>English</HI> follow∣ed them they would Slay the Prisoners, but the unfortunate Messenger in returning back was Slain by another <HI>Indian.</HI> On the same Morning another Party attacked a Farm house two Miles off, but the fury of the Dogs so alarm'd the Inha∣bitants, that they instantly got up and fired se∣veral Guns to very good advantage, which pre∣vented any further attempt. As for those at <HI>Pas∣comuck</HI> they were immediatly pursued, three made an Escape, eight were rescued, nineteen slain, &amp; three carryed to <HI>Canada.</HI> Next day Major <HI>White∣ing,</HI> pursued them with a number of Horses, and came upon their Track, but the Ways were so impassible, that they sent their Horses back with
<PB N="16" REF="002796_0013_0FE63AA79A98AF70"/>
a resolve to follow them on Foot, but some prov∣ing lame, and others tyring, caused the rest to desist. I would here remark, that a little before the Troubles at <HI>Pascomuck,</HI> and the Farm house before mentioned▪ the People at <HI>Springfield</HI> heard a great shooting; Unto some it seem'd to be at <HI>Westfield,</HI> to others at a <HI>Village,</HI> and to some again in the <HI>Woods</HI>; so that many hastned to their assist∣ance; but when they came all was still and qui∣et, the reason whereof is hard to assign, and yet we have repeated instances in History of the like nature.</P>
<P>Under all those Sufferings from a cruel Enemy little or no impression could ever be made by us upon them, by reason of their retiring into un∣accessable Swamps, and Mountains. Wherefore it was determined, that Major <HI>Church,</HI> who was so eminently Serviceable in the former War, should visit their head quarters, according to a <HI>Scheme</HI> which he had projected.</P>
<P>No sooner was his Commission granted, but he rais'd a considerable number of <HI>Volunteers</HI> out of <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony both of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>friend Indians,</HI> and marched to <HI>Nantaskett</HI> for furt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Instructi∣ons; where the following Gentlemen were ap∣pointed Officers under him. <HI>viz</HI> Colonel <HI>Gore∣ham,</HI> Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <HI>Hilton,</HI> Capt. <HI>Iohn Brown, Constant,</HI> &amp; <HI>Edward Church, Cole, Dyer, Lamb, Cook, Harreden, Williamson,</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rick,</HI> with five hundred and fif∣ty Men in fourteen <HI>Transports,</HI> and with thirty six <HI>Whaleboats,</HI> which were guarded by Capt. <HI>Smith, Rogers,</HI> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ck,</HI> in three ships of War.

15th. they sail'd Eastward, visiting all parts as they went along, till they came to the Green Islands, where they took Monsieur <HI>Lafebure,</HI> and his two Sons with a <HI>Canada Indian,</HI> whom they examined apart: The Father at first seem'd Surly and Croo∣ked, and the young Men were much of the like Temper, but being told what they must trust un∣to in case they did not confess, were afterwards Submissive, and promis'd to Pilot them where e∣ver they were directed. Upon this the Trans∣ports and Whaleboats were ordered to be in a rea∣diness, and every Man to have a weeks Provisi∣on; From hence they paddled to <HI>Penobscot,</HI> and with the assistance of one <HI>D' Young,</HI> whom they bro't out of <HI>Boston</HI> Goal on purpose for a Pilot, kill'd and took a considerable number both of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> among whom was St. <HI>Casteen</HI>'s Daughter. From thence they went to <HI>Passamaqua∣da,</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt Desart,</HI> where they met the thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Ships of War according to Appointment.

Here they siez'd the Old <HI>Lotriell</HI> and his Family, after that Mounsier <HI>Guorden,</HI> and <HI>Sharkee,</HI> who a little before came with a Comission from <HI>Canada</HI> to form an Expedition against the <HI>English.</HI> No sooner had our Forces arrived here, but Or∣ders were sent them from <HI>Boston,</HI> forthwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to Sail to <HI>Port-Royall,</HI> expecting some store Ships from <HI>France,</HI> which was welcome News for Officers &amp; Soldiers. But they miss'd of their Expectations: However the Ships stood off the Harbour while the Land Porces went to <HI>Meni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> where a Coun∣cil
<PB N="18" REF="002796_0014_0FE63AB4790BED78"/>
of War was held, and Lievt. <HI>Giles</HI> was sent to the Town with a Flag of Truce and Summons to Surrender; Their Answer was,
<Q><HI>That If our forces would not hurt their Estates they would Sur∣render, otherwise were resolved to stand their ground.</HI></Q>
Upon which a descent was made upon them that Night, but little effected until the Morning, and then the Forces drew up and drove all before them.</P>
<P>There was at this time a considerable plenty of Brandy, and Clarret in their Houses, which ra∣ther proved a snare than service to our Men; E∣specially the <HI>Indians,</HI> who naturally affect strong Drink, but this was soon prevented, by breaking in the heads of the Casks. Lieutenant <HI>Baker</HI> and one more were kill'd in this Attack, and not above six died in the whole Expedition. Most of their Houses were burnt, and much Plun∣der taken, but with as little Effusion of Blood as possibly could be. The <HI>General</HI> ordered their Damms to be dug down, and their Fortifications to be laid in Ashes. Having as great success as reasonably could be expected, thro' out all the Territorys of <HI>L' Accadia,</HI> and <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> where he took a hundred Prisoners, burnt and laid wast all the <HI>French</HI> Settlements, (except the Town of <HI>Port-Royal</HI>) a great many Cattle were also kill'd, and the <HI>Indians</HI> driven into such Confusion, that they left their Wigwams and retired into private Cells.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Iuly</HI> 4th. a Council of War was call'd to concert what next to do, who resolved, that as the Fort was alarm'd, the Enemy was more nume∣rous than at first; and that as many of our Men
<PB N="19" REF="002796_0014_0FE63AB4790BED78"/>
were tyred and defective, it would be best to return; which was also consented unto by our Sea-Officers. But notwithstanding the Fatigue that this worthy <HI>Gentleman</HI> had undergone, and the Dangers he had run; the Spoil he had done, and the Victories he wan, yet he could not es∣cape the Censures of many. Some indeed ex∣tol'd his Valour and Conduct even to an <HI>Hyper∣bole,</HI> while others endeavoured to lessen it with as much Disgrace and Infamy. Some thought he did too much, others too little: But after one and another had pass'd their Sentiments, the <HI>Ge∣neral Assembly</HI> (which was then sitting) voted him <HI>Thanks for the good Services he did both to the</HI> Queen <HI>and</HI> Country.</P>
<P>The Governour of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> being in fear of a new Enterprize, sent <HI>Lewis Allein</HI> as a Spy, un∣der the Colour of a <HI>Flag of Truce,</HI> with six Priso∣ners, (whereof Mr. <HI>Hoddy</HI> of <HI>Piscataqua</HI> was one) to observe and know the Motion of the <HI>English.</HI> But being suspected, he was apprehended and searcht, and in his Pocket-book was found this Direction; <HI>That if any Enterprize was on foot, he should (in his</HI> Advice-book) <HI>joyn</HI> L. A. <HI>the two first Letters of his Name, close together; if it was on∣ly in Agitation, to place them at some Distance; but if nothing was in Motion, then to sign a</HI> Cross.</P>
<P>While our Forces were engaged in visiting the Enemy abroad, great care was taken of covering the Frontiers at home; and yet very daring As∣saults were frequently made by small numbers. At <HI>Oyster-River</HI> they wounded <HI>William Tasket,</HI> and at <HI>Dover</HI> they way-laid the Inhabitants as they returned from publick Worship: After that they
<PB N="20" REF="002796_0015_0FE63AB480294A50"/>
kill'd a Lad near <HI>Casco</HI> Fort. About the same time some of the Enemy were Fishing up <HI>Con∣necticut</HI> River, and being trackt by a small Scout of our Volunteers, one <HI>Englishman</HI> and five <HI>Mohe∣gen Indians,</HI> they pursued them to such advan∣tage, that they slew the whole Company, save one, which were nine in number. Mr. <HI>Caleb Lyman,</HI> (now <HI>Elder</HI> of a Church in <HI>Boston</HI>) was Leader in this hardy Action, and has favoured us with the following Account of it.</P>

<P>SOme time in the Month o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>May,</HI> 1704. there came Intelligence from <HI>Albany,</HI> of a number of Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> up <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, who had built a Fort, and planted Corn, at a place called <HI>Cowassuck.</HI> On the fifth of <HI>Iune</HI> following, we set out (by order of Authority) from <HI>Northampton,</HI> and went nine Days Journey into the Wilderness, (thro' much Difficulty, by reason of the Enemy's Hunting and Scouting in the Woods, as we per∣ceived by their Tracks and Firing) and then came across some fresh Tracks, which we followed till we came in sight of the abovesaid River: Sup∣posing there might be a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> at hand; we being not far from the place where the Fort was said to be built. Here we made a Halt, to consult what Methods to take; and soon concluded to send out a Spy, with Green Leaves for a <HI>Cap</HI> and <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ste,</HI> to prevent his own Discove∣ry, and to find out the Enemy. But before our

Spy was gone out of sight, we saw two <HI>Indians,</HI> at a considerable distance from us, in a <HI>Cannoo,</HI> and so immediately recall'd him: And soon after we heard the firing of a Gun up the River.

And accordingly, when the Even∣ing came on, we mov'd towards the River, and soon perceived a <HI>Smoke,</HI> at about half a Miles distance, as we tho't, where we (afterwards) found they had taken up their Lodging. But so great was the Difficulty, that (tho' we used our utmost Care and Diligence in it) we were not able to make the approach till about <HI>Two</HI> a Clock in the Morning, when we came within Twelve Rods of the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> where they lay. But here we met with a new Difficulty, which we fear'd would have ruin'd the whole Design: For the Ground was so covered over with dry Sticks and Brush, for the space of five Rods, that we cou'd not pass, without making such a <HI>Crackling,</HI> as we tho't would alarm the Enemy, and give them Time to escape. But while we were contri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to compass our Design, God in his good Providence so ordered, that a very <HI>small</HI> Cloud a∣rose, which gave a smart <HI>Clap of Thunder,</HI> and a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dden Shower of Rain. And this Opportunity w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbraced, to run thorow the Thicket; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me undiscovered within sight of the <HI>Wigwam</HI>; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erceived by their Noise, that the Enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> awake.

them. Then we arose, and ran to the side of the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> and <HI>fired</HI> in u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on them: And fling∣ing down our <HI>Guns,</HI> we surrounded them with our <HI>Clubs</HI> and <HI>Hatchets,</HI> and knockt down several we met with. But after all our Diligence, <HI>Two</HI> of their Number made their escape from us: One <HI>mortally</HI> wounded, and the other not hurt; as we afterwards heard.</P>
<P>When we came to look over the slain, we found <HI>seven</HI> dead upon the spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of whom we <HI>scalpt,</HI> and left the other unscalpt. (Our <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> saying, They would give <HI>one</HI> to the Country, since we had each of us one; and so concluded we should all be rich eno') When the Action was thus over, we took our <HI>Scalps</HI> and <HI>Plunder</HI>; such as <HI>Guns, Skins,</HI> &amp;c. and the Enemies <HI>Canoos</HI>; in which we came down the River about twelve Miles, by break of Day; and then tho't it Pru∣dence to dismiss and break the <HI>Canoos</HI>; knowing there were some of the Enemy betwixt us and Home.</P>
<P>And now all our Care being, how to make a safe and comfortable Return, we first lookt over our Provision, and found we had not more than eno' for one small Refreshment: and being above one hundred Miles from any <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glish</HI> Settlement, we were very tho'tful how we shou'd subsist by the way.

<P>I beg the <HI>Country</HI>'s leave to observe, How <HI>poorly</HI> this bold Action, and great Service was rewarded: No doubt they looked for, and well deserved, <HI>eight</HI> times as much; and <HI>now</HI> the <HI>Province</HI> would readily pay eight hundred pounds in the like Case: But a gracious God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpenced to the <HI>Elder,</HI> I trust, both in the Blessings of his Pro∣vidence and Grace.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Canada</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow forming ano∣ther design on <HI>North Hampton,</HI> of which we had Seasonable Advice; Yet two Men were kill'd go∣ing to <HI>Deerfield.</HI> After th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> came in a <HI>French</HI> de∣serter, who informed of the State of the Army that was then coming: Upon this, Expresses &amp; Scouts were every way sent to observe their Mo∣tion; Major <HI>Whiting</HI> with a considerable Num∣ber went to the Ponds, where he expected to give them Battle, but they were gone from thence, leaving their Cannoos behind, which he burnt.

<PB N="24" REF="002796_0017_0FE63AB7E9838870"/>
about dividing the Skin before the Bear was kill'd. Their Dissention at last was so great, that upwards of two hundred return'd in discon∣tent. However the rest came on, and sent Scouts before to observe the Posture of the <HI>English,</HI> who reported, that they were as thick as the Trees in the Woods. Upon which their Spirits fail'd, &amp; more of their number deserted. They then call'd a Council of War, who resolved to desist from the Enterprize Yet some staid, and afterwards fell on <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and <HI>Groaton,</HI> where they did some Spoil, but not what they expected, for that these Towns were seasonably strengthened.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Ting</HI> and Capt. <HI>How</HI> entertained a warm dispu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with them for some time, but being much inferiour in Number, were forced to retreat with some loss; yet those that were Slain of the Ene∣my, were more then those of ours. One of them was an Officer of some Distinction, which so Ex∣asperated their Spirits, that in revenge they fired the Meeting House, kill'd several Cattle, and burnt many Out-houses. About the same time Capt. <HI>Allen</HI> from <HI>Westfield</HI> discovered a small Par∣tie with whom he had a Skirmish, and lost one Man, but kill'd three, and rescued a Captive. After this, between <HI>Hadley</HI> and <HI>Quabaug,</HI> we had one wounded and another Slain. By this time came Major <HI>Tailor</HI> with his Troop, (who always distinguish't himself of an active Spirit to serve his Country) Capt. <HI>Prescot, Buckley,</HI> and <HI>Willard</HI> with their Companies, who were so vigorous and intense in pursuing the Enemy, that they put them all to flight. And yet a little while after they fell on <HI>Groaton,</HI> and <HI>Nashaway,</HI> where they
<PB N="25" REF="002796_0017_0FE63AB7E9838870"/>
kill'd Lieut. <HI>Wyler,</HI> and several more. It was not then known how many of the Enemy were slain, it being customary among them to carry off their Dead: However it was afterward affirm'd, that they lost sixteen besides several that were wound∣ed. After this they divided into smaller Parties, and did much Mischief, as at <HI>Aimsbury, Haverhil,</HI> and <HI>Exeter. August</HI> 11th. they wounded <HI>Mark Giles</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> (with his Son) who thro' anguish of Pain, and much effusion of Blood, expired a few days after. At the same time another Partie fell on <HI>York,</HI> where they slew <HI>Matthew Austin</HI> nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Garrison, and then went to <HI>Oyster kiver,</HI> where they kill'd several while at Work in their Field.</P>
<P>The five Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> which are called by the Name of the <HI>Oneydes, Onnondages, Cayonges, Senneches,</HI> and <HI>Macquaus,</HI> all this while stood Neu∣ter: But being like to be influenced by the <HI>French Missionaries</HI> who came among them, Colonel <HI>Townsend</HI> and Mr.<HI>Leverett</HI> from the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> Capt. <HI>Gold</HI> and Capt. <HI>Levinston</HI> from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> were Commissionated to give them a Visit, and strengthen the Alliance with them; which they did to so good Effect, that they promis'd to take up the <HI>Hatchet,</HI> whenever the Governour of <HI>New-York</HI> should desire it. But why so fair an Oppor∣tunity was lost, when the Interest of <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> lay bleeding, was matter of Surprize and Admiration to some, of Censures and Reflections to others. The only Account we can give of it is, the vast Trade between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>; for the sake of which, that Government have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ys chosen to restrain their <HI>Indians</HI> from joyn∣ing

with us in our Wars. In the midst of War, there seems a secret League between them and the Governour of <HI>Canada,</HI> not to suffer the least breach to be made on one another by any of their <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>But although my Design was only to remark the barbarous Insults of those bloody Pagans on the Territories of <HI>New-England</HI>; yet I think it not improper to take a short view of their De∣scent on <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> considering the nearness of its Scituation, and that several of our <HI>Eastward Indians</HI> were confederate with them.</P>
<P>On the 18th of <HI>August,</HI> one hundred and forty <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> in two Sloops, early in the Morning, from <HI>Placentia,</HI> arrived at <HI>Bonovist,</HI> and surprized the <HI>Pembrook Galley,</HI> the <HI>Society</HI> of <HI>Pool,</HI> and a lesser Vessel, in which was thirty Ton of Oil: Capt▪ <HI>Gill</HI> of <HI>Charlestown</HI> was there at the same time, in a Ship of fourteen. Guns, with twenty four Men. He was furiously attackt, but defended himself with great Courage and good Conduct, from diverse bold and desperate At∣tempts which they made upon him. When he had beat 'em at small Arms, they then brought the Galley to bear upon him with her great Guns, which he return'd in the like Language. They then set Fire to the <HI>Society,</HI> with an ex∣pectation of burning him alive; but the Wind proving contrary, drove her ashore on a Rock, where she soon consumed. They then set the lesser Ship on Fire, which burnt to such a degree, by reason of the Oil, that it would soon have devoured him, had not the Buoy-rope of the Anchor got beteen the Rudder and the Stern, and
<PB N="27" REF="002796_0018_0FE63AC64BDAB6B8"/>
kept off the blazing War from him. The scituation of the Fort was such, as that it was not able to protect the Town of St. <HI>Iohns</HI>; upon which it was wholly laid in Ashes, the Inhabitants being mostly fled into the Woods. The loss that Capt. <HI>Gill</HI> sustained in the whole Encounter, was but one Man slain and two wounded.</P>
<P>I now return to the <HI>Westward,</HI> where on the 25th of <HI>October,</HI> the Enemy did some Mischief. <HI>Lancaster</HI> was alarm'd, and the Alarm was a means of the untimely Death of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Gar∣diner,</HI> their worthy Pastor. Several of the Inha∣bitants, who belonged to the Garrison, were wea∣ried by hard Travelling the Day before, in pur∣suit of the Enemy. This caused this good Man out of Pity and Compassion, to Watch that Night himself; accordingly he went into the Box, which lay over the Flanker, where he staid till late in the Night: But being cold, (as was sup∣posed) he was coming down to warm himself; when one between Sleeping and Waking, or surpriz'd thro' excess of Fear, fir'd upon him, as he was coming out of the Watch-house; where no Man could rationally expect the coming of an Enemy.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gardiner,</HI> altho' he was shot through the Back, came to the Door and bid them open it, for he was wounded. No sooner did he enter, but he fainted away: As he came to himself, he asked who it was that shot him? and when they told him, he pray'd God to forgive him, and for∣gave him himself, believing that he did it not on purpose; and with a composed frame of Spirit, desired them that bewailed him not to weep, but
<PB N="28" REF="002796_0019_0FE63AC64E053FA8"/>
pray for him, and his Flock. He comforted his sorrowful Spouse, and expired within an hour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Harvest being now gathered, and the Winter approaching, the Enemy like Beasts of Prey, retired to their private Cells: But con∣cluding it necessary to discover their Head quar∣ters, it was resolved, that Col. <HI>Hilton,</HI> with two hundred and seventy Men, should go to <HI>Naridg∣walk</HI> with twenty Days Provision: At which time the Country appeared like a frozen Lake, the Snow four foot deep; yet neither Officers nor Soldiers were in the least discouraged; but when they came unto the Fort, could not disco∣ver the least step of an <HI>Indian,</HI> only a few deser∣ted <HI>Wigwams,</HI> and a large Chappel, with a Vestry at the end of it, which they set on fire.</P>
<P>The Winter Season requiring <HI>Snow-shoes,</HI> an Express was sent Col. <HI>Patrick</HI> to supply the Frontiers therewith, which he no sooner forward∣ed, but the Express was intercepted, by a <HI>Mount-Real</HI> Scout, who robb'd him of <HI>Fifty Pounds</HI> that he had in his Pocket, which at their return they presented to the Governour, who converted it into a <HI>Bowl,</HI> and called it by the Name of the <HI>New-England</HI> Gift.</P>
<P>Early in the Spring, Capt. <HI>Larraby</HI> was order∣ed to Cruise on the Shore of <HI>L' Accadia,</HI> and de∣feat the <HI>French</HI> from their Fishery, having <HI>Whale-Boats</HI> to attend him: Capt. <HI>Fowl</HI> was also dis∣patcht in a Sloop of War, who on the <HI>North∣ward</HI> of <HI>Cape-Sables</HI> took a small Vessel formerly belonging to the <HI>English,</HI> which had Cattle and Sheep on Board her. Soon after he took five Prisoners at <HI>Port Rosu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and three at <HI>L' Have,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="002796_0019_0FE63AC64E053FA8"/>
burnt a few Houses, and kill'd some Cattle; but the Inhabitants were so miserably poor, and their Circumstances so desperate, that they rather chose to be Prisoners among the <HI>English,</HI> than at Liberty among the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 4th. 1705. Capt. <HI>Hill,</HI> who was for∣merly taken at <HI>Wells,</HI> and carried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>Canada,</HI> was from thence sent by Mounsieur <HI>Vaudriell,</HI> to con∣cert the exchange of Prisoners, who advis'd of one hundred and seventeen that were then with him, and about seventy more with the <HI>Indians</HI>; which unexpected News was very reviving to the dejected Spirits of their mournful Friends; consi∣dering the many Deaths they escaped in their Captivity.</P>
<P>Upon the advice hereof, Capt. <HI>Levinston</HI> was sent to <HI>Canada</HI> to capitulate about the matter, and after him Capt. <HI>Appleton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sheldon</HI> (with seventy Prisoners of theirs) who went by Water, having ordered a Scout before of ten Men by Land to advise of their coming, that so our Pri∣soners might be in readiness. But the <HI>Iesuits</HI> and <HI>Fryers</HI> had by this time so influenc'd the Gove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nour, as to cause him to break his Word of Ho∣nour, pretending, that as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Indians</HI> were inde∣pendant and a free born People, that he had no power to demand any Captives of them; when at the same time they were so mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Subjecti∣on, and Vassalage unto him, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y never for∣med an Enterprize without him, neither did they dare to attempt it without his knowledge.</P>
<P>Now altho' the Expence and Industry of our Commissioners in this Affair was very great; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notwithstanding they could not obtain above
<PB N="30" REF="002796_0020_0FE63AC8532C2C30"/>
sixty Captives out of one hundred and eighty se∣ven; which was scandalously base and disho∣nourable in that Government.</P>
<P>The descent that the Enemy again made on <HI>New foundland,</HI> was more terrible and surprizing than the former; for on <HI>Ianuary</HI> 21st. at break of day, Mounsieur <HI>Supercass,</HI> Governour of <HI>Placentia,</HI> came with five hundred and fifty <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Ca∣nada, Port-Royal,</HI> and other places adjacent, and a company of Salvages, of whom <HI>Assacombuit</HI> was Chief; who ransack'd and laid waste all the <HI>Sou∣thern</HI> Settlements in a few Days, and then fell on St. <HI>Iohn</HI>'s, where in the space of two hours all were become Prisoners of War, excepting those in the Castle and Fort. The Night before the Enterprize they were oblig'd to lye on a Bed of Snow, six foot deep, for fear of being discovered, which caused such cold and numbness in the Joynts of several, that the General vow'd revenge, and accordingly Executed his Resentment, for that he destroy'd all before him, and gave no Quarter for some time; till Mounsieur <HI>Boocore,</HI> who was a Gentleman of more Humanity, did in∣terpose and abate his Fury: The Number that they took alive was one hundred and forty, whom they sent unto the Garrison, not out of pity to the Prisoners, but with a design to Starve the whole. After that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> laid close seige to the Garrison, and Fort, which continued thirty Day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without relief. (Excepting three who made their Escape to the former and seventeen to the latter) In the Fort were only forty Men under the com∣mand of Capt. <HI>Moody,</HI> and twelve in the Castle, under Capt. <HI>Lot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am</HI>; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o behaved themselves
<PB N="31" REF="002796_0020_0FE63AC8532C2C30"/>
with such bravery, that they slighted all manner of tenders that were made them of Surrendring, with the highest Contempt immaginable.</P>
<P>Upon this the Enemy committed many Barba∣rities, and sent several threatnings; but they had no Influence either on Officers or Soldiers, for they pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d their Bombs and Mortarpieces to so good Effect, that they kill'd several, and lost but three in the whole Engagem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt.</P>
<P>After this they Stee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to <HI>Consumption-Bay,</HI> hav∣ing first demolish't all the <HI>English</HI> Settlements in <HI>Trinity</HI> and <HI>Bonivist,</HI> where they burnt their Sta∣ges and Boats, and laid a Contribution besides upon the Inhabitant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. From thence they went to <HI>Carboneer,</HI> where they met with some repulse, and finding their Provision fall short, they sent a further number unto the Fort, reserving the most skilful and able Fishermen for themselves until the succeeding Spring.</P>
<P>During this time our Frontiers at home were greatly infested. At <HI>Spruce-Creek</HI> in <HI>Kittery</HI> they kill'd five and took as many more; among the Slain was Mrs. <HI>Hoel,</HI> a Gentlewoman of good Ex∣tract, and Education; but the greatest Sufferer was <HI>Enoch Hutchins</HI> in the loss of his Wife and Children. Three weeks after <HI>Iohn Rogers</HI> was dangerously wounded, and at a little distance <HI>Iames Toby</HI> was shot by another Party. From thence they went <HI>Westward,</HI> and took a Shallop whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h belong'd to <HI>Piscataqua.</HI> Our Sea coast at the same time was disrested by <HI>Privateers,</HI> parti∣cularly by Capt. <HI>Crepoa,</HI> who notwithstanding our Cruisers that were then out, took seven Ves∣sels, besides a Sloop, and carried them all to <HI>Port-Royal,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="002796_0021_0FE63AC855824960"/>
excepting the latter, which was retaken by Capt. <HI>Harris</HI> at <HI>Richmond</HI>'s Island.</P>
<P>About the same time <HI>Michael <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyal,</HI> a Fisher∣man belonging to <HI>Marblehead,</HI> as he went ashore for wood off of Cape <HI>Sables,</HI> wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Barbarou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly cut in peices; On the 15th. of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ber</HI> following, eighteen <HI>Indians</HI> fell on Cape <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddick,</HI> where they took four Children of Mr. <HI>St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vers</HI> at a little dis∣tance from the Garrison. The youngest not a∣ble to travel was knock't on the head, the other three were carried Captive; but being attack't by Lieut. <HI>March,</HI> and loosing one of their Com∣pany, they ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd a second Child in way of re∣venge.</P>
<P>During the Winter little or no Spoil was done on any of our Frontiers; the Enemy being so terrified by reason of <HI>Snow-shoes</HI> (which most of our Men were skilful in) that they never attemp∣ted coming at such a season after.</P>
<P>But as the Spring came on, <HI>April</HI> 27th· 1706. a small Body fell on an Out-house in <HI>Oyster-River,</HI> where they kill'd eight, and wounded two; The Garrison which stood near, had not a Man in it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t that time; but the Women, who assum'd an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mazoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Courage seeing nothing but Death be∣fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e them, advanc'd the Watch-box, and made an Alarm. They put on Hatts, with their Hair han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing down, and fired so briskly that they struc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a terror in the Enemy, and they withdrew, without firing the house, or carrying away much Plunder. The principal Sufferer at this time was <HI>Iohn Wheeler,</HI> who thinking them to be friend <HI>Indians,</HI> unhappily fell under their Fury. Two days after Mr. <HI>Shapleigh</HI> and his Son, as they were
<PB N="33" REF="002796_0021_0FE63AC855824960"/>
travelling thro' <HI>Kittery,</HI> were ambusht by another Party, who killing the Father, took the Son, and carried him to <HI>Canada.</HI> In their March they were so inhumanely Cruel, that they <HI>bit</HI> off the tops of his Fingers, and to stagnate the Blood, sear'd them with hot Tobacco Pipes.</P>
<P><HI>Iune</HI> the 1st Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> being loaden with Provisions from <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnecticut,</HI> was chased by a <HI>French</HI> Priva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eer, which to avoid he ran ashore in his Boat, and as he hastned to <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d-Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd,</HI> made an Alarm all round: The Government there was so expeditious, that in a few Hours (by beat of Drum) one hundred Men well equip'd voluntari∣ly entred on board of two Sloops, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the command of Major <HI>Wanton</HI> and Captain <HI>Paine,</HI> who next Day became Masters of the Prize, wherein were thirty seven Men, under the com∣mand of Capt. <HI>Ferrel,</HI> bound for <HI>Port-R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yal,</HI> but in his way was obliged to cruise on the <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w-England</HI> Coast.</P>

<P>And yet it has been generally remark'd from the beginning of Time here, that those who have been <HI>Indian-Traders,</HI> and seemingly got much, have sensibly decay'd, and many of them become Victims to their bloody Cruelty. A <HI>Proclamatian</HI> was issued forth to apprehend all such as were Suspected; Several hereupon were seized, and o∣thers vehemently Suspected, who did what they could to extenuate the Crime, and to get the In∣dictment alter'd from that of <HI>Treason,</HI> unto <HI>High Misdemeanour.</HI> At last a Court of <HI>Oyer and Termi∣ner</HI> was call'd, and Fines were imposed, be∣sides the Prison Fees.</P>

<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Advice of Collonel <HI>Schuyler</HI> from time to time was of eminent Service unto the Country, who advis'd of two hundred and seventy Men that were coming upon us.

a Garrison that had twenty Troopers posted in it, who by their Negligence and Folly, keeping no Watch suffered them to enter, which tended to the destruction of one half of their Number· After that a small Party attack't <HI>Daniel Galeucias</HI> House, who held them play for some time, till the old Mans Courage fail'd; when on surrendring himself, he inform'd them of the state of the Gar∣rison; how that one Man was kill'd &amp; only two Men and a Boy left; which caused them to rally a new, and with greater Courage th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n before.

<P><PB N="36" REF="002796_0023_0FE63ACD17239968"/>From thence they went to <HI>Kingstown,</HI> where they kill'd and wounded several Cattle. About the same time <HI>Ioseph English,</HI> who was a Friend <HI>Indian,</HI> going from <HI>Dunstable</HI> to <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmsford,</HI> with a Man and his Wife on Horeback, was shot dead, the Woman taken, but the Man made his escape.

The Neighbourhood being alarm'd, got ready by the Morning, and coming on their Track, pursued them so near, that they recovered three of the Children, and put the E∣nemy into such a Terrour, that they not only quitted their Plunder and Blankets, but the other Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive also. Several Strokes were afterwards made on <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmsford, Sudbury</HI> and <HI>Groton,</HI> where three Soldiers as they were going to publick Wor∣ship, were way-laid by a small Party, who kill'd two, and made the other a Prisoner.</P>

two of those that were taken, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Hall,</HI> and <HI>Samuel Myals,</HI> made their escape; but the Fatigue and Difficulty that they went thro', (besides the terror and fear they were under of being taken) was almost incredible; for in three weeks together they had nothing to subsist on, excepting a few Lilly roots, and the Rhines of Trees.</P>
<P>Several of our Captives still remaining among the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> occasioned Mr. <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldon</HI>'s going a second time to <HI>Canada</HI> with a Flag of Truce, who at his return brought forty five, and had a prospect of many more, but was prevented by the <HI>Iesuits.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Treatment of our Captives with the <HI>French,</HI> it was as different and various as their Tempers and Constitutions: Some were mild and pleasant, while others were morose and sordid; but the <HI>Indians</HI> might as well alter their Com∣plexions as their Constitutions; for scarce a Day past without some act of Cruelty, insomuch that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l were under a constant Martyrdom between fear of Life and terror of Death.</P>
<P>It would be an endless task to enumerate the various Sufferings that many g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oaned under, by long Marching with heavy Burdens, thro' heat and cold; and when ready to faint for want of Food, they were frequently knockt on the head: Teeming Women, in cold Blood, have been ript open; others fastned to Stakes, and burnt alive; and yet the Finger of God did eminently appear in several Instances, of which I shall mention a few. As</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="002796_0024_0FE63AD5A8C0D0C8"/>First. Of <HI>Rebeka<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Taylor,</HI> who after her return from Captivity, gave me the following Account. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That when she was going to <HI>Canada,</HI> on the back of <HI>Mount-Real</HI>River, she was violently insulted by <HI>Sampson</HI> her bloody Master, who without any Provocation was resolved to hang her; and for want of a Rope, made use of his Girdle, which when he had fastned about her Neck, attempted to hoise her up on the limb of a Tree, (that hung in the nature of a <HI>Gibbit</HI>) but in hoising her, the Weight of her Body broke it asunder; which so exasperated the cruel Tyrant, that he made a se∣cond attempt, resolving that if he fail'd in that, to knock her on the head: But before he had power to effect it, <HI>Bomaseen</HI> came along, who seeing the Tragedy on foot, prevented the fatal stroke.</P>
<P>A second was a Child of Mrs. <HI>Hanna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parsons,</HI> of <HI>Wells,</HI> whom the <HI>Indians</HI> for want of Food, had determined to Roast alive, but while the fire was kindling, and the Sacrifice preparing, a Compa∣ny of <HI>French Mohauks</HI> came down the River in a Canoo, with three Dogs, which somewhat revi∣ved these hungry Monsters, expecting to make a Feast upon one of them▪ So soon as they got ashore, the Child was off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd in Exchange; but despising the offer, they tendred a G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, which they readi∣ly accepted, and by that means the Child was preserved.</P>
<P>A third was of <HI>Samuel Butterfield,</HI> who being sent to <HI>Groton</HI> as a Soldier, was with others attackt, as they were gathering in the Harvest; his bra∣very was such, that he kill'd one and wounded

Encouragement, but it did not answer what we expected. The Charge of the War was by this time so great, that every <HI>Indian</HI> we had kill'd or taken, cost the Country at least a Thousand Pounds.</P>
<P>But while they continued in great Bodies, they did not commit the like Spoil and Rapine (in proportion) as they did in smaller. <HI>August</HI> the 10th. they slew <HI>William Pearl</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> and a little after Took <HI>Nathanael Tibbits.</HI> But of all the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> that was ever known since King <HI>Phillip,</HI> never any appear'd so Cruel and Inhumane as <HI>Assacam∣buit,</HI> that insulting Monster, who by the Encou∣ragement of the <HI>French</HI> went over to <HI>Paris,</HI> and being introduced to the King, lifted up his Hand in the most arrogant manner imaginable, saying, <HI>This Hand of mine has Slain one hundred and fifty of your Majesty's Enemies, within the Territorys of New-England</HI> &amp;c. Which bold and impudent Speech was so pleasing to that Bloody▪ Monarch, that he forthwith Knighted him, &amp; order'd eight Livers a day to be paid him during Life; which so exalted the Wretch (having his Hands so long imbrued in innocent Blood) as at his return, to exert a So∣vereignty over the rest of his Brethren, by Mur∣thering one, and Stabing another, which so ex∣asperated those of their Relations, that they sought Revenge, and would instantly have Exe∣cuted it, but that he fled his Country, and never return'd after.</P>

Witness that of <HI>Domitian,</HI> two thousand five hundred Miles in the space of twenty four Hours; And of <HI>William</HI> the Con∣querour, the news of whose Death was conveyed from <HI>Roan</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> the day he dyed, which as Historians mention, was — prius pene quam nunciari possit.

<P><HI>March</HI> 13th. 1707 they sail'd from <HI>Nanta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sket,</HI> and in a fortnight after, arrived at <HI>Port Royal</HI> Gut, where they landed on both sides the River, which the Enemy observing, made an alarm and retired to the Fort, with what Substance they could get.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Supercass,</HI> who was the Governour, upon rallying his Forces together, held a short Skirmish bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> finding too warm a Reception, (his Horse being shot under him) was obliged to re∣treat. A Council of War being called, it was re∣solv'd that the Artillery should be landed, and their Lines forced: But thro' the Unfaithfulness of some, and cowardly Pretentions of others, lit∣tle was done in annoying the Enemy, save kil∣ling their Cattle, burning their Mills and Out∣houses: Whereas if the Officers on board her Majesty's Ship had been true and faithful, matters had succeeded to good advantage. But instead of pressing on, they did rather clog and hinder the Affair: For by crafty Insinuations they after∣wards obtained a second Council, which the General not so well weighing as he ought, prov∣ed the overthrow of the whole Design.

Ground, and not fired a Gun, the Enemy must of necessity have surrendred or have starved. This was so surprising, that the whole Country was under an amazing Ferment, and the Com∣mander so grosly reflected on, that his Spirits sunk, and he became of little Service ever after: Yet to give him his Character, he was a Man of good Courage, and a true lover of his Country. But the Business that he undertook, was too weighty for his Shoulders to bear. So soon as his <HI>Excellency</HI> was apprized hereof, (who had the Honour and Interest of his Country much at Heart) he sent strict Orders to stay them; and another Ship of War, with two Companies of fresh Men to reinforce them; Col. <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> Col. <HI>Townsend,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Leverett</HI> were appointed Commissioners, to give the greater Vigour: But the number of Deserters, and disaffected Officers overthrew the whole Affair. However a second Attempt was made, which the Enemy perceiv∣ing, called in their Auxiliaries both of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Meni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Sachenecto,</HI> and all other pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es adjacent.

at home were as much disrested as ever: <HI>May</HI> 22d they took two at <HI>Oyster-R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver,</HI> and on <HI>Iune</HI> 12th kill'd one at <HI>Groton</HI>; After that they slew <HI>William Carpenter</HI> of <HI>Kittery,</HI> with his whole Family. <HI>Iuly</HI> 8th they way-laid a Cart with two Men, as they were going from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Oyster-River,</HI> whom they shot dead. Capt. <HI>Sumers∣by,</HI> who was there with his Tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, regained the most of the Plunder that they took. About the same time <HI>Stephen Gilman</HI> and <HI>Iacob</HI> his Bro∣ther, as they were riding from <HI>Exeter</HI> to <HI>Kingstown,</HI> were ambush'd by another Party. The first had his Horse shot under him, and was in danger of being scalpt before he could get clear: The o∣ther Brother had several Shot thro' his Cloaths, and one that graz'd his Belly; his Horse also was wounded; yet he defended himself on Foot, and got into the Garrison.</P>
<P>At <HI>Casco</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> intercepted a Fishing-boat as she was sailing between the Islands, in which were five Men, three of whom they kill'd, and took the other two. <HI>August</HI> the 10th they way∣laid the Road between <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> and as four Horsemen were riding in Company with Mrs. <HI>Littlefield,</HI> who had the value of <HI>Sixty Pounds</HI> with her, were all slain except one, who made his escape.

our side two were slain, and two wounded.</P>
<P>At <HI>Exeter</HI> one was kill'd near the Meeting-house; and two days after another at <HI>Kingstown,</HI> but the most afflicting stroke that befell us this season was at <HI>Oyster River,</HI> where thirty <HI>French Mohauks,</HI> who appeared like so many Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys with their naked Bodys painted like Blood, and observ∣ing some at work in hewing of Timber, and o∣thers driving the Team, they violently f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll upon them with such hideous Noise and Yelling, as made the very Woods to eccho. At the first shot they kil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d seven and mortally wounded another, upon which Capt. <HI>Chesly</HI> (who had signally be∣haved himself in many Encounters) with the few that were left, fired on them with great vigour and resolution; and for some time gave a check to their Triumphing; but the Enemy being too powerful, soon overcame him, to the great la∣mentation of all that knew him.</P>
<P>It being now the height of <HI>Indian</HI> Harvest, they disperst themselves, into all parts, and did consi∣derable Mischief; but having somthing more then ordinary in view, they beset <HI>Winter-Harbour,</HI> and on <HI>September</HI> 21<HI>st.</HI> with one hundred and fifty Men in fifty Canoos, Attempted the taking two Shallops as they lay at Anchor, in which were Capt. <HI>Austin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Harmon,</HI> Sergeant <HI>Cole,</HI> and five Men more, with a Boy; who perceiving their Intention, suffer'd them to paddle till they had got near, and then fired, which put them into great Confusion.

possession thereof, but they got their Mainsail atrip, before that our Men could get up theirs half Mast high, and then put out their Oars, which they joyn'd with Paddles on each side; but having no fargood, and their Boat a dull sai∣lor, ours gain'd on them so much, that they got twelve or thirteen Canoos a head, with Fishing∣lines to tow them. But a breeze springing up, &amp; the Enemy making too near the Wind, (for want of a fargood) came to stays several times, in so much that they fell a quarter of a Mile a stern. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the rest of the Canoos kept on firing, and ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men on them for a considerable time toge∣ther.

<P>The Engagement held about three hours, in which the <HI>English</HI> spent five pounds of Powder, &amp; when the Enemy ceased their chase, they had not above one quarter of a pound left.

Lieut. <HI>Littlefield</HI> of <HI>Wells,</HI> with <HI>Io∣seph Winn,</HI> as they were travelling to <HI>York,</HI> were surrounded by a small Body; the latter made his escape, but the other was carried to <HI>Quebe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,</HI> who being a skilful <HI>Engineer,</HI> especially in Water works, did them great Service.</P>
<P>About this time eight hundred <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> were forming a desperate design against us, but on a division among themselves fell short of the Mischief they designed us. However one hundred and fifty on <HI>August</HI> 29th at break of day, fell on <HI>Haverhill,</HI> and passing by the Garrisons got into the very Center of the Town before they were discovered. They attempted to fire the Meeting-house, and after that did burn seve∣ral Houses near it. Major <HI>Turner,</HI> Capt. <HI>Price,</HI> &amp; Capt. <HI>Gardner,</HI> were happily there at that time, and rallied together what Forces they could; but most of their Men being posted in remote Garrisons, were unable to assist them. However with such as they could get together, they faced the Enemy with much bravery, and in less than an hour put them all to flight, leaving nine of their dead, and carrying off several that were wound∣ed. But the Slain on our side were thrice as ma∣ny, by reason of the surprize that they at first were in; among whom was the Reverend Mr▪ <HI>Rolph</HI> the worthy Minister of that Town, with Capt. <HI>Wainright.</HI></P>

Royal Commands and Instructions to the <HI>Gover∣nours</HI> of the several <HI>Provinces,</HI> to furnish their re∣spective Quota's.

<P>Upon this the several <HI>Governours</HI> contributed their utmost Assistance; and considering that <HI>New-York</HI> (with the adjacent places) lay nearest the <HI>Lake,</HI> it was resolved that Col. <HI>Nicholso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> should command the several Troops from thence, for the attacking of <HI>Mount-Real,</HI> while Col. <HI>Vetch</HI> was preparing to head the Forces by Sea.</P>
<P>But it often happens in the course of Divine Providence, that when our Expectations are at the highest, things come to nothing. For while our Forces were ready, and after a vast Expence by long waiting, there was a stop at home from any further proceeding for that time; which oc∣cosioned Col. <HI>Nicholson</HI> to imbarque again for <HI>England,</HI> to revive the Expedition, if possible. But such was the importance of Affairs then on foot, that notwithstanding his indefatigable Care and Pains, he could not effect it.

<P>Monsieur <HI>Maneval</HI> was then made Governour, who built a small Fort at <HI>Port Royal,</HI> which lies on the edge of a Basin one League broad, and two long, about sixteen foot of Water on one side, and six or seven on the other, where the In∣habitants drove a considerable Trade, and in∣creased much in the adjacent Parts, till Sr. <HI>William Phips</HI> ih the Year 1690, took possession of it in the Name of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and administred the Oaths of Allegiance to the Inha∣bitants; but in a little time they revolted.

with Drums beating, Colours flying, and Guns shouldered; each paying their Respects to the <HI>General</HI> as they passed by; and then our Army entred the Fort, hoisted the <HI>Union-Flag,</HI> and drank the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Health, firing all the Guns round the Fort; as likewise did the Men of War, and other Vessels in the River.</P>
<P>On the Success of these her Majesty's Arms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Day of Thanksgiving was solemniz'd; and agree∣able to the Articles of Capitulation, three Vessels were appointed to transport the Soldiers unto <HI>France,</HI>, being two hundred and fifty eight; who besides the common Allowance, had a considera∣ble stock of Wine, Brandy, Sugar, Spice, and o∣ther things, with a plentiful supply for the late Governour. After this a Council of War was call'd, who resolved, that Major <HI>Levinston,</HI> with St. <HI>Casteen,</HI> and three <HI>Indian</HI> Guides, should go to the Governour of <HI>Canada,</HI> about the Exchange of Captives, and inform him how Matters were here.

his Hatchet in his Hand, ready to give him the fatal stroke, had not St. <HI>Casteen</HI> interposed; He was however kept Prisoner some time; but by the prudent management and mediation of that Gentleman was released. <HI>November</HI> the 4th. they took their departure, and next day the Majors <HI>Ca∣noo</HI> oversate, drowning one <HI>Indian,</HI> where he also lost his Gun and all he had; after that coming a∣mong the Ice, their Canoo was cut to pieces, which obliged them to travel the rest of the way by Land, thro' horrible Deserts and Mountains, being often forced to head Rivers and Lakes, and some times Knee deep in Snow; scarce passing a day without fording some River or other, which in some places were very rapid and dangerous; &amp; for nineteen days together never saw the Sun, the Weather being very stormy and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of Fogs, and the Trees so prodigious thick, that in many places it was with difficulty they got thro': being most∣ly Spruce, and Cedar, and the way under foot so extream rocky, that it was almost next to an im∣possibility. At last their Provisions were wholly spent, so that for six days together they had not one morsel to eat but what they scraped off the frozen Earth, or off the bark of Trees. After these unspeakable Difficulties they arrived at <HI>Que∣beck December</HI> the sixteenth, where they were handsomely entertained, and after some time of Refreshment, discours'd about the Prisoners. The <HI>Governour</HI> at their return, sent two Gentlemen with them to <HI>Boston,</HI> to treat on the same head. Six Days homeward his Man fell sick, whom he left in a Hospital at <HI>Troy River.</HI> From thence they came to <HI>Shamblee,</HI> and brought with them

three birch Canoos, being thirteen in number; which Canoos they carried seventy Miles by Land, thro' the Woods and Ice, and then passed in them sixty Miles by Water, crossing the Lake. They did not arrive at <HI>Albany</HI> till <HI>February</HI> 23d.</P>
<P>Early in the Spring the Enemy appeared a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> insulting as ever: The first that fell under their Cruelty was <HI>Benjamin Prebble</HI> of <HI>York</HI>; but the most affecting and surprizing Stroke was on Col. <HI>Hilton</HI> of <HI>Exeter,</HI> who being deeply engaged in the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting Affair, and having several Trees of value that were fell'd fourteen miles up the Coun∣try, went out with seventeen Men to peel off the Bark for fear of Worms: But not being so care∣ful and watchful as they ought to be, on <HI>Iuly</HI> the twenty second they were ambush'd by a Body of <HI>Indians</HI> that were making a descent upon us. They took two and kill'd three, whereof the Collonel was one; which so surpriz'd the rest, (their Guns being wet) that they all ran without firing one shot. or making the least Reprisal. This caus'd the Enemy to triumph, and the more because they slew a superiour Officer, whom they soon scalpt, and with utmost revenge struck their Hatchets in his Brains, leaving a Lance at his Heart. Next day about a hundred Men went in pursuit of them, but could not discover any. One of the slain was buried on the spot, the other two brought home, where the Collonel was decent∣ly interr'd, the several Troops in great Solem∣nity attending his Corps. He was a Gentleman of good Temper, Courage and Conduct, respec∣ted and lamented by all that knew him.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="002796_0034_0FE63B06E483B7A0"/>After this the Enemy appear'd very bold and insolent in the Town, in open Streets; where they carried Captive four Children as they were at play. They then took <HI>Iohn Wedgwood,</HI> whom they carried to <HI>Canada,</HI> and after that kill'd <HI>Iohn Magoon,</HI> of whom one thing is remarkable; that three Nights before he dreamt he should be slain by the <HI>Indians,</HI> at a certain place near his Bro∣ther's Barn; which place he frequently visited with a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lancholly Countenance, telling several of the Neighbourhood, that within a little while he should be kill'd, and pointed to the very spot, which fell out accordingly.</P>
<P>After this they bent their fury <HI>Westward,</HI> where at <HI>Water-bury</HI> they kill'd three, and one at <HI>Simsbu∣ry.</HI> About the same time they fell on <HI>Brookfield,</HI> and then at <HI>Marlborough,</HI> where they shot the <HI>Post</HI> as he was riding to <HI>Hadly.</HI> From thence they went to <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> where they wounded Major <HI>Tyng,</HI> who soon after expired; he was a true lov∣er of his Country, and had very often distin∣guish'd himself a Gentleman of good Valour and Conduct.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> the 2d. between forty and fifty <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Indians</HI> fell on <HI>Winter-Harbour,</HI> where they kill'd a Woman and took two Men, one whereof was Mr. <HI>Pendleton Fletcher,</HI> which was the fourth time of his Captivity; but he was soon redeem'd by the Garrison.

<P><PB N="60" REF="002796_0035_0FE63B06E6981C98"/>As the Winter approached, Collonel <HI>Walton</HI> was again preparing to traverse the <HI>Eastern</HI> Shore with an hundred and seventy Men, being the usu∣al Season of visiting their Clam-banks, where one of the Enemy very happily f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll into his Hands as they were encamping on an Island; for by the smoak that the <HI>English</HI> made, they came near, concluding them to be some of their own Tribe, but finding themselves deceived, they attempted to escape, which our Men prevented. The Prin∣cipal <HI>Indian</HI> among them was <HI>Arrubawikwabemt,</HI> chief Sachem of <HI>Naridgwalk,</HI> an active bold Fel∣low, and one of an undaunted Spirit; for when they ask't several Questions he made them no Reply, and when they threatned him with Death, he laught at it with contempt; upon which they delivered him up unto our friend <HI>Indians,</HI> who soon became his Executioners; but when the <HI>Squaw</HI> saw the destiny of her Husband, she be∣came more flexible, and freely discovered where each of them encampt. Upon this they went further <HI>East,</HI> and took three more; after that a certain <HI>Indian</HI> (thro' discontent) surrender'd him∣self, and informed of <HI>Mauxis</HI> and several others that were at <HI>Penobscot,</HI> which our Forces had re∣gard unto; and as they returned went up <HI>Saco</HI> Ri∣ver, where they took two, and kill'd five more. Now altho' the Number that we destroyed of them seems inconsiderable to what they did of ours, yet by Cold, Hunger, and Sickness, at least a third of them was wasted since the War begun.

At <HI>Winter-Harbour</HI> they took Corporal <HI>Ayers,</HI> but soon releas'd him, without offering him the least Injury, and then went unto the Fort with a Flag of Truce professing their desire of a Pacification.

He perfectly retained his Senses▪ but made not the least motion or struggle, and by this means sav'd his Life. <HI>April</HI> the twenty ninth the like num∣ber appear'd at <HI>Wells,</HI> where they kill'd two Men as they were planting of Corn.

Upon this Col. <HI>Walton</HI> went with two Companies of Men to <HI>Ossipe</HI> and <HI>Winnepisseocay</HI> Ponds, being places of general Resort for Fish∣ing, Fowling and Hunting; but saw none, only a few deserted <HI>Wigwams</HI>; for being so closely pursued from one place to another, they removed to other Nations▪ leaving only a few Cut-throats behind, which kept the Country in a constant Alarm.</P>

<PB N="65" REF="002796_0037_0FE63B08C1106A48"/>
proving foggy, and the Wind freshning, the <HI>Ad∣miral</HI> ask'd the <HI>Pilots</HI> what was best to do? who advised that as the Fleet was on the <HI>North</HI> Shore, it would be best to bring too, with their heads unto the <HI>Southward</HI>: but he obstinately refusing, acted the reverse, and ordered their heads unto the <HI>North,</HI> which was so astonishing unto the <HI>Pi∣lots,</HI> that one and another foretold their Fear (un∣to the Officers) and the Destiny that would at∣tend them before the Morning; which accord∣ingly fell out. For at one of the Clock nine Ships with 1500. Men were all cast ashore, and most of the rest in as eminent danger; but so soon as the former struck, they fired their Guns, which gave Caution to the rest: Some of which wore, and stood off; others were so encompassed by the <HI>Breakers</HI> that they were oblig'd to bring too their Anchors, which was their last Refuge; but before the day approached, the Wind happily shifted to <HI>W. N. W.</HI> upon which they cut their Cables and came to sail. Soon after a Council of War was call'd, but the result not known until the Even∣ing, and then the <HI>Flag</HI> bore away to <HI>Spanish Ri∣ver,</HI> without giving the usual Signal: On which many of the windward Ships were left behind; but a small Man of War was ordered to Cruise the next day for those that were left, and to take up such as might be alive among the dead, who were about six hundred. After this they made towards the Fleet, but were eight days in getting down; during which time the Wind was <HI>East∣wardly,</HI> and had our Fleet proceeded, (as it were to be wish'd they had) might easily have got unto <HI>Quebeck</HI> in forty eight Hours.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="002796_0038_0FE63B174336EBF8"/>Upon this disaster the whole Country (and in∣deed the Nation) was alarm'd, and many Cen∣sures and Jelousies arose; some imputing it to Cowardize, but most to Treachery, and the se∣cret Influence of some Malecontents then at Helm; otherwise why would a matter of such vast Importance to the <HI>British</HI> Kingdom, be hush't up in silence, and the Principal Officers not Sum∣mon'd to appear. If the <HI>Admiral</HI> was in fault wherefore was he not call'd to an Account? Or why did not the <HI>General</HI> to vindicate himself, lay a Remonstrance before the Council Board? And the <HI>Pilots,</HI> (who were order'd from hence at so great a Charge to the Country to represent mat∣ters in a true light) been examined? But instead thereof, dismist without being ask'd one Question. However one thing is remarkable, that among those that were shipwrack'd and lost their lives, there was but one single Person that belong'd to <HI>New-England</HI> among them.</P>
<P>Collonel <HI>Nicholson</HI> at this juncture was industri∣ously engaged in getting the <HI>Battoes</HI> ready for passing the <HI>Lake</HI> with a considerable Number of Friend <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as English, for the attack∣ing of <HI>Mount Real,</HI> which next to <HI>Quebeck</HI> was the place of greatest Importance in all the <HI>French</HI> Territories. But just as he was ready to embarque an Express came and gave an Account of the miserable Disaster that befel the Fleet: Whereas, if he had proceeded, his whole Army would pro∣bably have been cut off; For upon advice of our Fleets misfortune, the <HI>French</HI> drew off all their Auxiliaries and most of their <HI>Militia</HI> to reinforce <HI>Mount Real,</HI> being advis'd of the descent that was

making on them. So great was our loss in this En∣terprize, that it Affected the whole Country se∣ven Years after; as the Advance &amp; Expence of so much Money and Provisions might well do. And it as much flusht the Enemy; for out of the ruins of our Vessels they not only got much Plunder, but fortified their Castle and out Batteries with a considerable Number of Cannon. They moreo∣ver stirr'd up the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> about <HI>Annapo∣lis Royal</HI> to revolt from their Allegiance to the <HI>Crown.</HI> Capt <HI>Pigeon</HI> being ordered up the River for Timber to repair the Fort, was violently at∣tackt by no less than one hundred and fifty, who kill'd the whole Boats Crew, wounded the Fort <HI>Major,</HI> and afterwards very barbarously Murdered him: They also slew Capt. <HI>Forbis</HI> the Engineer, besides several others, and took thirty four of them Prisoners. Soon after this, we were informed of the Arrival of our <HI>British</HI> Forces in <HI>England,</HI> on the 9th. of <HI>October</HI> at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> where on the 15th. following, the Admirals Ship the <HI>Edgar</HI> was accidentally blown up, with 400 Seamen and se∣veral other People on board, all the Officers being on shore.</P>
<P>The reduction of <HI>Canada</HI> was a matter of great Consequence, not only to the Interest of <HI>New-England</HI> and the adjacent Colonies; but also to the whole <HI>British</HI> Empire. Not that in it self it is of such intrinsick Value; for that the Cold is so great, and the Ice so rigid, as to imbargo it more than half the Year: But as the ingenious Mr. <HI>Dummer</HI> observes in a Letter of his to a <HI>No∣ble Lord</HI> in the Year 1712, the Consequence would be very valuable; for as it extends above

one thousand Leagues towards the <HI>Messisippi,</HI> it would require a vast consumption yearly of the <HI>English</HI> Manufactury to support it; there being so great a number of several Nations that live behind, which bring down vast quantities of Furs of all sorts, as amount to an incredible Sum. But her Majesty's Royal Aim, as he notes, was not so immediately to advance a Trade, as the Secu∣rity and Peace of her good Subjects in <HI>North America</HI>; being thorowly apprized that so long as the <HI>French</HI> inhabit there, so long the <HI>English</HI> would be in hazard.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> Company, as well as <HI>New∣foundland,</HI> have given a melancholly Account of the many Ravages that have been committed there by the powerful Assistance of those <HI>Salva∣ges.</HI> I'm not insensible that many have blamed <HI>New-England,</HI> and cast the Odium wholly on them for not succeeding in this Enterprize; but why <HI>New-England</HI> should be branded with such Infamy, I never could yet hear the Grounds, or any Reason assigned, but what sprung from some capricious Brains, who were no well wish∣ers either to the Cause or Country, and would stigmatize us if possibe, as Enemies to the <HI>Church,</HI> and Disloyal to our <HI>Sovereign.</HI> But why Ene∣mies to the <HI>Church?</HI> or wherein is it that we dif∣fer from them? save only in the <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> which none of them will allow to be Essential. We indeed are called <HI>Dissenters</HI>; but many of those that are of the <HI>Church,</HI> dissent more from one a∣nother than we do: For what we dissent from, is, (as they themselves term it) only in matters of Indifferency; but many of them are Dissen∣ters

from their own <HI>Articles of Faith.</HI> Is not our <HI>Doctrine</HI> the same? the <HI>Sabbath</HI> as strictly solem∣nized? and our Mode of Worship as agreeable to the primitive Constitution, as any other Church in the World? Not but that we have degenera∣ted from the pious Steps of our Fore-fathers; yet I am bold to say, that as to number, there are as many sincere and good People in <HI>New-England,</HI> as in any one part of the World. But I beg pardon for this Digression, which is only to wipe off the Calumny that is too often cast upon us. Now as to our <HI>Loyalty,</HI> such pregnant In∣stances may be given thereof, as will be surpri∣zing to Posterity.

<P>For a further Ratific<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion of this Treaty, seve∣ral Gentlemen of both Governments went from <HI>Portsmouth</HI> to <HI>Casco,</HI> where a great Body of <HI>Indians</HI> we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e assembled, to know the Result of matters: It being a Custom among them on all such Oc∣casions, to have the whole of their Tribes pre∣sent;
<PB N="81" REF="002796_0045_0FE63B286E201B00"/>
having no other Record of conveying to Posterity, but what they communicate from Fa∣ther to Son, and so to the Son's Son. When the several Articles were read and explained, by In∣terpreters upon Oath, (the Delegates being pre∣sent) they signified an unanimous Consent and Satisfaction, by loud Huzza's and Acclamations of Joy: Many Presents were then made them, which were thankfully received, and every Tribe had their proportion given out; but they were so disorderly, that <HI>Mauxis</HI> (altho' he was the chief <HI>Sagamore</HI> in all the <HI>Eastern</HI> parts) was rob'd by the Morning of all he had; upon which he made a miserable Complaint unto the <HI>English</HI> next Day, of the unruliness of his young Men, who had stollen away all he had, therefore beg'd a new Supply. But altho' their Government is so <HI>A∣narchical,</HI> and their Chiefs have so little Respect and Honour shewn them, yet in their Council they observe a very excellent Decorum; not suf∣fering any to speak but one at a time; which is deliver'd with such a remarkable Pathos, and surprizing Gravity, that there is neither Smile nor Whisper to be observed, until he that speaks has finish'd his Discourse, who then sits down, and after that another riseth up.</P>
<P>The Peace thus concluded and so firmly ratifi∣ed, gave matter of Encouragment to the <HI>Eastern</HI> Inhabitants for re-settling their former Habitati∣ons; who were also countenanced and assisted by the Government, even from <HI>Cape-Porpas</HI> to <HI>Ke∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebeck</HI> River, where several Gentlemen who had l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rge tracts of Land, granted a hundred Acres to
<PB N="82" REF="002796_0046_0FE63B2E373744E8"/>
every one for Encouragment that would go and Settle; supporting a Ministe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> besides (for so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e time) and employ'd a Sloop at their own Charge for carrying and re-carrying the Inhabitants, with their Stock; which gave so great Encou∣ragment, that several Towns began to be settled, as <HI>Bromswick, Topsham, Augusta, George Town,</HI> &amp;c. In which a great many fine Buildings were erect∣ed, with several <HI>Saw-mills,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fishery</HI> was also undertaken by the ingeni∣ous <HI>Doct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Noyes,</HI> where twenty Vessels were em∣ploy'd at a time. He afterwares built a stone Garrison at <HI>Augusta</HI> at his own Charge, which was judged to be the best in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Country; and for a while was kept at the publick Cost, but afterwards slighted; which occasioned the Inhabitants to with draw, and then the <HI>Indians</HI> burnt it with several other Houses;</P>
<P>In <HI>Kene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eck</HI> River the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgeon Fis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery</HI> was also begun and carried on with so great Success, that many thousand Caggs were made in a Season; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>steemed as good as any that ever came from <HI>Hamb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough</HI> or <HI>Norway</HI>; Besides vast quantities of Pipe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aves, Hogshead and Barrel, Pine Boards, Plank, and Timber of all sorts, which were not only tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sported to <HI>Boston,</HI> but to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reign places; Husban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry also began to thrive, and great stocks of Catte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere rais'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nch Missionaries</HI> perceiving the Growth of these Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntations, soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimated the <HI>Indians</HI> to disrest the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by insinuating that the Land was theirs, and that the <HI>English</HI> invaded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Proper∣ties; which was a vile and wrong Suggestion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or that their Conveyance were from the Ancient

The Ar∣ticles drawn up and signed in the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>13. were again read and ratified, to the seeming Satisfacti∣on of the Principal <HI>Sachems,</HI> who inclined to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce; and imputed the late Miscarriages unto the young Men, but were now resolved on a firm Harmony, and would in no respect violate the former Treaties. Upon this his <HI>Exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> made them several Presents, which they thank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully re∣ceived, and in acknowledgment thereof, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turned him a Belt of <HI>Wampam,</HI> with some Beavo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Skins:

After this they drank the Kings Health, and pro∣mis'd Allegience to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; so that every thing had now the promising Aspect of a lasting Peace. One thing I cannot here o∣mit; three days after our departure, a number of <HI>Indians</HI> went a Duck-hunting, which was a sea∣son of the year that the old ones generally shed their Feathers in, and the young are not so well flusht as to be able to fly; they drove them like a flock of Sheep before them into the Creeks, where without either Powder or Shot they kill'd at one time four thousand and six hundred; for they followed them so close that they knockt them down with Billets and Paddles, and sold a great number of them to the <HI>Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> for a Penny a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zen, which is their practice yearly, tho' they seldom make so great a Slaughter at once. But before two years were expired, they again began to insult the Inhabitants, being spur'd on by the <HI>Iesuits,</HI> which occasioned a <HI>Scout</HI> of fifty or sixty Men to be sent out, who kept them in some awe. But in the year 1720▪ they began to be more in∣solent, and appear'd in greater Bodies; upon which Collonel <HI>Walton</HI> was ordered with about two hundred Men to guard the Frontiers, and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after that appointed with Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Moody, Har∣man Penhallow,</HI> and <HI>Wainright</HI> to send to their Chiefs for Satisfaction for the late Hostilitys which they had done in killing the Cattle, &amp;c. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Indians</HI> fearing the event promis'd to pay two hundred Skins, and for their fidelity to deliver up f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur of their young Men as Hostages. After this they became tolerably quiet, but in the Spring grew as insolent as before; especially in
<PB N="85" REF="002796_0047_0FE63B2E39595DB0"/>
<HI>Kenebeck,</HI> where some time in <HI>Iuly</HI> they came with ninety Canoos on <HI>Padishals</HI> Island, which lies opposite to <HI>Arowsick,</HI> and sent to speak with Capt. <HI>Penhallow,</HI> who fearing an intreague, re∣fused. Upon which one hundred and fifty of them went over to him, with whom he held a Conference; especially with Mounsieur <HI>Dela∣chase,</HI> and <HI>Sabastian Ralle</HI> who were <HI>Iesuits</HI>; Mounsieur <HI>Croizen</HI> from <HI>Canada,</HI> and St <HI>Casteen</HI> from <HI>Penobscot</HI> came also along with them, who brought a Letter for <HI>Governour Shute</HI> in behalf of the several Tribes, importing, That if the <HI>English</HI> did not remove and quit their Land in three weeks, they would burn their Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and kill them as also their Cattle. Upon this an additio∣nal Number of Soldiers were sent under the com∣mand of Collonel <HI>Thaxter</HI> and Lieut. Col. <HI>Goff</HI>; and several Gentlemen of the Council were also appointed to enquire into the ground of these Tumults, and if possible to renew the Pacificati∣on; who accordingly went and sent Scouts to call the <HI>Indians</HI> in, but they slighted the Message with derision. Hereupon the Soldiers were order'd to continue, and reinforce the Garrisons that Winter. But in the Summer they renewed their insults, and on the thirteenth of <HI>Iune</HI> 1722 abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sixty of them in twenty Canoos, came and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook nine Families in <HI>Merry-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eting-Bay,</HI> most of which they afterwards set at liberty, but sent Mr. <HI>Hamilton, Love, Handson, Trescot</HI> and <HI>Edgar</HI> to <HI>Canada</HI>; who with great difficulty and expence afterwards got clear. They then made a descent on <HI>St. Georges,</HI> where they burnt a Sloop, took several Prisoners, and sought the Garrison some time; and in a
<PB N="86" REF="002796_0048_0FE63B30CB3AD120"/>
Month after came a greater Body from <HI>Pe∣nobscot,</HI> who kill'd five and engag'd the Fort twelve Days; being very much encouraged by the influence of the <HI>Fryar</HI> that was with them. But finding they could make no great impression, endeavoured to undermine it, and had made a cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derable progress therein, till upon the falling of much Rain, the Trenches caved in, which caused the seige to break up, with the loss of twenty of them in the Engagment, as we were afterwards informed. About the same time Capt. <HI>Samuel</HI> with five others boarded Lieut. <HI>Tilton,</HI> as he lay at Anchor a fishing near <HI>Damaris Cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>: They pinion'd him and his Brother, and beat them very sorely: But at last one got clear and released the other; who then fell with great Fu∣ry upon the <HI>Indians,</HI> threw one over-board, and mortally wounded two more.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Savage,</HI> Capt. <HI>Blin,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> who at this time were coming from <HI>Annapolis,</HI> and knew nothing of their Ravages, went into <HI>Passa∣maquady</HI> for Water. They were no sooner ashore, but found themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em'd in by a Body of <HI>In∣dians,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> basely standing by and suffering it. They wanted to divide the <HI>Cargo</HI> of the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>op</HI> among them, and at last sent Capt. <HI>Savage</HI> on board to procure some <HI>Ransome.</HI> But the Wind rising, he was forc'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff▪ and made the best of his wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <HI>Boston:</HI> Those that he left (after some Difficulty and Expence) were released.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Harmon</HI> who was now in <HI>Kenebeck,</HI> went up the River with a Detachment of thirty four Men, and seeing some Fire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, went ashore in the Night, where he came on eleven Canooos: The
<PB N="87" REF="002796_0048_0FE63B30CB3AD120"/>
<HI>Indians</HI> were lying round the Fire, and so weari∣ed, by much Dancing the day before upon the Success they had, that they stumbled over them as they lay asleep. Reports were various as to the number of <HI>Indians</HI> that were then slain; some say eighteen, others not so many: However they brought away fifteen Guns; and at a little distance found the Hand of an <HI>Englishman</HI> laid on the stump of a Tree, and his Body mangled after a barbarous manner; having his Tongue, Nose and private parts cut off: They brought away the Body, and gave it a decent Burial. It was found to be the Body of <HI>Moses Eaton</HI> of <HI>Salisbury.</HI></P>
<P>In this brave attempt of Capt. <HI>Harmon,</HI> which was effected in ten minutes, we lost not one Man, yet at the same time a great Body of <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> lay near, who being startled at the Noise that was made, arose and fired several Guns, but did no Damage.</P>
<P>The Country at this time was in a surprizing Ferment, and generally disposed to a War; but the <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> could not readily come into it, considering the vast Expence and Effu∣sion of Blood that would unavoidably follow: Besides some were not satisfied with the Lawful∣ness of it at this time: For al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' they believed the <HI>Indians</HI> to be very criminal in many respects, yet were of Opinion that the <HI>English</HI> had not so punctually observed the Promises made to them of Trading-houses for the benefit of Commerce and Traffick, and for the preventing of Frauds and Extor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons, too common in the private deal∣ings of the <HI>English</HI> with them. But the grand abuse to them is the selling of strong Drink to
<PB N="88" REF="002796_0049_0FE63B30CE7BAFF8" MS="y"/>
them, which has occasioned much quarreling and Sin and the loss of many Lives, to the great Scan∣dal of Religion, and reproach of the Country. His <HI>Excellency</HI> was sensible of the Promises that he made them at the Treaty of Pacification; which he failed not to lay before the General Assembly; but he met with so much opposition that nothing could be effected. The firing an <HI>Armourer</HI> at the Publick Charge, was also engag∣ed, but nothing done therein; So that the <HI>Indians</HI> were full of resentments, and thought themselves wrong'd. Yet all this time they made no appli∣cation unto the Government for redress, which they ought to have done by the Articles of A∣greement, but broke forth into Horrid and cruel Outrages, by burning killing and destroying. At last the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vernour</HI> by repeated Addresses from the People, was obliged to call the <HI>Council</HI> together to concert what was proper to be done, who ad∣vised, to the proclaiming an open War. But their not cosulting before-hand with the other <HI>Governments</HI> was certainly a great oversight, who probably would have come into it, and thereby have help'd to support the Charge, which now lay wholly on the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> and <HI>Newhamp∣shire.</HI></P>

<P>The abovesaid Declaration (for substance) was also given out t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Week after, at the Coun∣cil-Chamber at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Newhampshire.</HI></P>
<P>Now altho' the Settlements in <HI>Kenebeck</HI> were the first that were molested, yet it's not to be supposed that the bent of the Enemies Fury was on them alone, as some would insinuate; for at the same time they interrupted the Fishery throughout all <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI>; many have reflected on the Government for suffering a Fort to be at St. <HI>Georges,</HI> as if that did irritate the <HI>Indians</HI>; but why the Proprietors might not make an improv∣ment thereof, as well as any others on their right of Purchase I know not; considering that it was granted from the Crown, and no exemption made at the Treaty of Peace. Yet at the same time I must be free to say, that there was too great in∣dulgence at first in the Government in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffering
<PB N="92" REF="002796_0051_0FE63B86801214E8"/>
so many Townships at so great a distance to be laid out at once, unless they were more peopled; which has since been the occasion not only of a vast Expence, but a great effusion of Blood.</P>
<P>The number of Vessels were about sixteen which the Enemy took at <HI>Canso,</HI> as they went in∣to the Harbours for their Necessity; which so soon as Governour <HI>Philipps</HI> was apprised of, he summoned the several Masters ashore with the Sailors, and proposed the fitting out of two Sloops well Man'd for recov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring the Vessels and Cap∣tives, which being approved of, he forthwith or∣dered the Drums to beat for Volunteers, and in less then half a day fix'd them out with about twenty Men in each, under the command of Capt. <HI>Eliot</HI> and Capt. <HI>Robinson,</HI> who freely offered their services; but as Capt. <HI>Eliot</HI> out sail'd the other, he got first to a Harbour call'd <HI>Winpague,</HI> where he discovered some Vessels, and bore di∣rectly down upon them, 'till he came pretty near. The <HI>Indians</HI> being flush't with Success, and having thirty nine on board one of the Vessels which they had took, and seeing no more Men on board the <HI>English</HI> then what was usual, commanded them to strike <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or that they were their Prize. Un∣to whom Capt. <HI>Eliot</HI> reply'd that he was hastning to them; and in an instant called his Men on Deck, who fired on them with a loud Huzza, and clapt them on board; which was so surpri∣sing a Salutation, that they made a most dreadful yelling. However they resisted so well as they could for about half an hour, in which time Capt. <HI>Eliot</HI> received three Wounds, when Mr. <HI>Broadstreet,</HI> who commanded the Soldiers, entred
<PB N="93" REF="002796_0051_0FE63B86801214E8"/>
with Hand-<HI>Granado</HI>'s, most of the <HI>Indians</HI> jumpt over-board, who were shot in the Water. Those that ran down in the hold, were tore in pieces by the Shells, so that only five escaped, who were wounded. One of our Men was kill'd, and seve∣veral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urt, particularly the Corporal of the Troops, who had five Swan-shot in his Body. Capt. <HI>Eliot</HI> being ill of his Wounds, was oblig'd to return, carrying with him seven Vessels into <HI>Canso,</HI> which he retook with fifteen Captives, six hundred Quintals of Fish, and two heads of the Chiefs of those <HI>Indians</HI> that were among them. Upon this the Governour ordered the same Sloop back with a fresh supply of Men to reinforce Capt. <HI>Robinson,</HI> who in a Week after brought in two <HI>Indian</HI> Scalps, a Scooner and a Sloop which they took at <HI>Mallegash.</HI></P>
<P>After that he met with a <HI>French</HI> Man and an <HI>English</HI> Captive, who informed of a Body of <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> and five Vessels that lay at a little distance, which he immediately went in pursuit of; but fearing the event, was not willing at first to en∣gage them, but kept at some distance, and then three Canoos with three <HI>Indians</HI> in each double arm'd drew near, one of which came on board, as the rest lay on their Paddles, whom they treated friendly in expectation of a greater Prize. But the <HI>Indian</HI> growing jealous attempted to es∣cape, and presented his Gun to Lieut. <HI>Iephson</HI>'s breast, which he putting by, shot him dead. Upon this they fir'd upon those in the Canoos, and kill'd three. The Enemy was so numerous ashore, that he thought it not safe to encounter them; however he took one Vessel. At this
<PB N="94" REF="002796_0052_0FE63B8682363920"/>
time they had twenty of our <HI>English</HI> Captives, but could not come to a fair Capitulation about their Redemption. However the Captain warn'd them to use them well, for as we had thirty of theirs at <HI>Annapolis,</HI> twenty at <HI>Boston,</HI> and as many more at <HI>Canso,</HI> as they treated ours, so we would theirs. Mr. <HI>Broadstreet</HI> now steer'd to the <HI>Westward</HI> of the Harbour where Capt. <HI>Eliot</HI> had the dispute before mentioned, where he retook three Vessels more, but could see neither Captive nor <HI>Indians.</HI> The Day after Capt. <HI>Blin</HI> very happily arrived with a Flag of Truce, and redeem'd seven Vessels and twenty four Captives, who otherwise would have been put to Death. From thence he sail'd to the <HI>Cape,</HI> and in his returning back, took three or four <HI>Indians,</HI> which he carried to <HI>Boston.</HI> Capt. <HI>Southack</HI> being inform'd of a small Body that was then at <HI>Astagenash</HI> in the Gulph of St. <HI>Law∣rence,</HI> where Monsieur <HI>Golden</HI> the famous <HI>Fryar</HI> did reside, had an intent to visit him; but in his pas∣sage thro' the Gutt was happily diverted, where meeting with two Canoos, in which were six <HI>In∣dians</HI> he kill'd one, and took the other five.</P>
<P>The <HI>General Assembly</HI> not finding the former Bounty sufficiently encouraging to Volunteers, now pass'd an Act of <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> a Scalp to all such as supported themselves, and whoever was subsisted by the Publick, should have <HI>sixty pounds</HI> for the like: That any Company or Troop issuing forth upon an Alarm, should over and a∣bove the Establishment have <HI>thirty pounds,</HI> and an encouraging Reward besides, for all Prisoners that they took; and whatever Plunder might be taken should be shared among them: And if any Vo∣lunteers
<PB N="95" REF="002796_0052_0FE63B8682363920"/>
or detach'd Soldiers should happen to be wounded or maimed in the Service, that du∣ring the continuance of such Wound or Maim, he shall be allowed such a Stipend or Pension as the <HI>General Court</HI> should think fit to order.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the 10th we had a surprizing Account from <HI>Arowsick</HI> of <HI>four or five hundred, Canada</HI> and <HI>Cape S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble Indians,</HI> that fell upon them early in the Morning, who probably would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid all desolate, had they not been seasonably discover∣ed by a small Guard which Capt. <HI>Penhallow</HI> was sending out for assisting the Neighbourhood to gather in the Corn; who kill'd one and wounded three more of the Company: The report of which Guns did so alarm the Inhabitants, that they with most of their Substance got seasonably into the Garrison. Their first appearance seem∣ed terrible, considering their Number, with the fewness of those that were to defend; who fought the Garrison some time, and shot <HI>Samuel Brooking</HI> thro' a Port-hole, after that they had kill'd fifty head of Cattle, and burnt twenty six dwelling Houses. The same Day in the Evening came Col. <HI>Walton</HI> and Capt. <HI>Harmon,</HI> with about thirty Men in two Whale-boats, who with those of Capt. <HI>Temple</HI> and <HI>Penhallow</HI>'s Men, (that could be spared out of the Garrisons) made about <HI>seventy,</HI> and gave them Battle some time: But the Ene∣my were so numerous, that they were like to have hem'd them in, had they not fought upon a re∣treat.</P>
<P>In the Night they drew off, without much cause of Triumph, and went up the River, where they attackt Mr. <HI>Stratton,</HI> as he was turning dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="96" REF="002796_0053_0FE63B8959DEF878"/>
in his Sloop, whom they mortally wounded; then went to <HI>Richmond,</HI> where some time they held a dispute with the Garrison, and afterwards drew off. The last that fell this Season w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a Man at <HI>Berwick.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Excellency</HI>'s Affairs now calling him to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the Government of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> was wholly devolved on the Honourable <HI>William Dummer,</HI> Esq. Lieut. Governour; during whose Administration, there were as many remarkable Turns of <HI>Divine Providence,</HI> (respecting the Ene∣my) as have happened since the War commenc'd; whose Prudence and good Conduct have made him acceptable unto all.</P>
<P>The first Alteration that he made, was in Com∣missionating Col. <HI>Westbrook</HI> as Chief in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Affairs; who on the 10th of <HI>February</HI> march'd to <HI>Penobscot,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Harmon</HI> at the same time up <HI>Amanascoggin</HI> River, but neither of them had any Success, save burning their <HI>Chappel</HI> and some <HI>Wigwams.</HI> Capt. <HI>Sayward</HI> with a Company of Volunteers went as far as the <HI>White Hills,</HI> near one hundred miles into the Enemies Country, but met with the like misfortune.</P>
<P>So soon as the Spring advanced, they began to appear as furious as ever. At <HI>Scarborough</HI> they kill'd <HI>Thomas Laribie</HI> and his Son; after that Mrs▪ <HI>Dering</HI> and two Soldiers, where they also took <HI>Mary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd, Iohn Hunuel</HI> and <HI>Robert Iordan.</HI> Another Party came to <HI>Cochecha,</HI> where they slew <HI>Tristram Head, Ioseph Ham,</HI> and carried three Children Captive: From thence they went to <HI>Lamper-Ele River,</HI> where they kill'd <HI>Aaron Raw∣lins</HI> with one of his Children, carrying away his
<PB N="97" REF="002796_0053_0FE63B8959DEF878"/>
Wife and three more with them▪ At <HI>Northfield</HI> they shot two, and meeting with the Reverend Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> of <HI>Rutland,</HI> they laid violent Hands upon him; but he being a Person of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urage</HI> a∣greeable to his <HI>Strength,</HI> he slew one and wound∣ed another, till at last they gave him the fatal stroke▪ Two of Ensign <HI>Stephens</HI>'s Sons were al∣so kill'd, and two more carried Captive.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kins,</HI> who at this time was engaged on a Fishing Voyage at <HI>Canso,</HI> was surprised by a small Body in the Night while abed. The Day before he was at Church, and it hapned that <HI>two Ministers</HI> in two different Congregations preached on one and the <HI>same Subject</HI>; namely, <HI>preparing for sudden Death</HI>; not knowing how soon or in what manner Death would attack them▪ His Lodging was on an <HI>Island</HI> at a little distance from the <HI>Fort</HI>; and altho' he was so strongly im∣portun'd by several of his Friends to stay with them that Night, as if they had a secret impulse of some impending Evil; yet all the Arguments they could use, could no ways prevail nor influ∣ence him. He was a Gentleman of singular good Temper, respected and lamented by all that knew him. <HI>Iohn Drew</HI> of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> (a pretty Youth) was slain with him, at the same time.</P>
<P>The Delegates of the six Nations of <HI>Iroquoise,</HI> with the <HI>Mohegan</HI> and <HI>Scatacook</HI> Indians, being disposed to come to <HI>Boston,</HI> were kindly enter∣tained there.

And the more to oblige them to our Interest, they had a promise made of <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> a Scalp for every <HI>Indian</HI> that they kill'd or took; which seem'd so pleasing to them, that they manifested a readiness of taking up the Hatchet in favour of the <HI>English,</HI> whenever any Hostility was made against them. After this they were entertained with the curious sight of a Gun that was made by the ingenious Mr. <HI>Pim</HI> of <HI>Boston</HI>; which altho' loaden but <HI>once,</HI> yet was discharg'd <HI>eleven</HI> times following with Bullets in the space of two mi∣nutes; each of which went thro' a double Door at fifty yards distance. They were then presen∣ted with an <HI>Ox,</HI> which with Bows and Arrows they kill'd and dress'd according to their own Custom; where thousands of Spectators were present to behold and hear their barbarous Singing and Dancing. But notwithstanding this free and generous Entertainment, with the firm promises they made of falling on our Ene∣mies, (whenever they made any Insults on us) all proved of little or no Significancy; which was principally owing to the powerful influence of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for the sake of Trade and Comerce with them, as was observed on the like Occa∣sion.</P>

<P><HI>December</HI> 25th about sixty laid siege to St. <HI>Geor∣ges</HI> Garrison, where they continued thirty Days, and were not a little flusht with the expectation of Success; for at their first coming they took two Soldiers, who gave an account of the state of Matters: But Mr. <HI>Canady</HI> the commanding Officer being one of uncommon Courage and Resolution, stood his Ground till Col. <HI>Westbrook</HI> arrived, who soon put them to a rout. After this some came to <HI>Berwick,</HI> where they took a Soldier as he was carelesly wandering from the Garrison.</P>
<P>The favourableness of the Winter prevented our marching to any of their Head quarters this Season, excepting to <HI>Narridgwalk,</HI> where Capt. <HI>Moulton</HI> found a vile and pernicious Letter from the Governour of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> directed unto the <HI>Fryar,</HI> exhorting him to push on the <HI>Indians</HI> with all imaginable Zeal against the <HI>English,</HI> whose Advice he as industriously pursued.</P>

But on their return they were ambuscaded by two or three Companies of them that lay on each side the River. The first that fell was Sergeant <HI>Har∣vey,</HI> who commanded the other Boat; for by keeping too near the Shore, he gave the Enemy the greater Advantage: However he returned the Shot with as much bravery as could be ex∣pected, till overpower'd by a multitude. Capt. <HI>Winslow,</HI> who was considerably a-head and out of danger, perceiving the Engagement, couragi∣ously return'd back to their Assistance. But be∣fore he could give them any relief, was surroun∣ed with about <HI>thirty</HI> Canoos, who made a hide∣ous yelling; but he gave them no answer but from the muzzles of his Guns. A smart Engage∣ment followed, which held till Night: When finding his Thigh broken, and most of his Men slain, was oblig'd to hasten ashore; but there al∣so he found himself unhappily way-laid: They fell on him with utmost fury, yet his Courage continued until the last; for (as one of those that escaped has since reported) he rested himself on his other Knee, and kill'd an <HI>Indian</HI> before they had power to slay him. Thus died that worthy <HI>young Gentleman,</HI> for the Cause of his Country.

<P>The Frontiers being thus alarmed, two Com∣panies of Volunteers went from <HI>Newhampshire</HI> on the Bounty Act <HI>one hundred pounds</HI> a Scalp, and it hapned that <HI>Moses Davis,</HI> as he was weeding his Corn, went unto a Brook to drink, where he saw three <HI>Indian</HI> Packs, upon which he informed the Troops that were then coming out.

<P>The next damage they did, was at <HI>Groton,</HI> but were so closely pursued, that they left several of their Packs behind. About which time News came to <HI>Deerfield</HI> of a Body of <HI>Indians</HI> discover'd up <HI>Connecticut</HI> River. Capt. <HI>Thomas Wells</HI> Rallied a Company of Men, and went in quest of them, but made no further Discovery, till, upon their return home, about four Miles from <HI>Deerfield, three</HI> of the Company (supposing themselves out of Danger) Rode at some distance before the rest, and unhappily fell into an Ambushment of the Enemy near a Swamp, and were all three kill'd by them. But the Company behind, hearing the Guns, rode up with all speed, and came upon the Enemy while they were scalping the slain; and firing upon them wounded several. Upon which the Enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led into the Swamp, and the <HI>English</HI> dismounting their Horses, ran in after them, and trackt them a considerable way by the Blood of the wounded, but found none. However they recovered ten Packs, and heard afterwards that <HI>two</HI> died of their Wounds, and a <HI>third</HI> lost the use of his Arm. Another Company fell on <HI>Spur∣wink,</HI> where they mortally wounded <HI>Solomon Ior∣dan,</HI> as he was coming out of the Garrison. Next day being <HI>Iuly</HI> the 18th.

<P>Capt. <HI>Lovewell</HI> being still animated with an uncommon zeal of doing what Service he could, made another attempt on <HI>Pigw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> with forty four Men; who in his going built a small Fort near <HI>Ossipy,</HI> to have recourse un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o in case of dan∣ger, as also for the relief of any that might be sick or wounded; and having one of his Men at this time sick, he left the <HI>Doctor</HI> with eight Men more to guard him: With the rest of his Com∣pany he proceeded in quest of the Enemy, who on <HI>May</HI> the 8th about 10 in the Morning, forty miles from said Fort, near <HI>Saco</HI> Pond, he saw an <HI>Indian</HI> on a point of Land: Upon which they immediately put off their Blankets and Snapsacks, and made towards him; concluding that the Enemy were a head and not in the rear. Yet they were not without some Apprehensions of their being discovered two days before, and that the appearing of one <HI>Indian</HI> in so bold a manner, was on purpose to ensnare them. Wherefore the Captain calling his Men together, proposed whether it was best to engage them or not; who boldly reply'd, <HI>That as they came out on purpose to meet the Enemy, they would rather trust Providence with their Lives and die for their Country, than return without seeing them.</HI> Upon this they proceeded and mortally wounded the <HI>Indian,</HI> who notwith∣standing returned the Fire, and wounded Capt. <HI>Lovewell</HI> in the Belly: Upon which Mr. <HI>Wyman</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="002796_0061_0FE63BB2777CC5E0"/>
fired and kill'd him. But their dismantling them∣selves at this juncture proved an unhappy snare; for the Enemy taking their Baggage, knew their strength by the number of their Packs, where they lay in ambush till they returned, and made the first shot; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich our Men answered with much bravery, and advancing within twice the length of their Guns, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew nine: The Encounter was smart and desperate, and the Victory seem'd to be in our favour, till Capt. <HI>Lovewell</HI> with several more were slain and wounded, to the number of <HI>twelve:</HI> Upon which our Men were forced to retreat unto a Pond, between which and the E∣nemy was a ridge of Ground that proved a Bar∣rier unto us. The Engagement continued ten hours, but altho' the shouts of the Enemy were at first loud and terrible, yet after some time they became sensibly low and weak, and their appearance to lessen: Now whether it was thro' want of Ammunition, or on the account of those that were slain and wounded, that the Enemy retreated; certain it is they first dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w off and left the Ground: And altho' many of our Men were much enfeebled by reason of their Wounds, yet none of the Enemy pursued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem in their return. Their number was uncertain, but by the advice which we afterwards received, they were <HI>seventy</HI> in the whole, whereof <HI>forty</HI> were said to be kill'd upon the spot, <HI>eighteen</HI> more di∣ed of their Wounds, and that twelve only re∣turned. An unhappy instance at this time fell out respecting one of our Men, who when the Fight began was so dreadfully terrified, that he ran away unto the Fort, telling those who were
<PB N="114" REF="002796_0062_0FE63BB279FDD728"/>
there, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pt. <HI>Lovewell</HI> was kill'd with most of his Men; which put them into so great a Con∣sternation, that they all drew off, leaving a bag of Bread and Pork behind, in case any of their Company might return and be in distress.</P>
<P>The whole that we lost in the Engagement were <HI>fifteen,</HI> besides those that were wounded. <HI>Eleazer Davis</HI> of <HI>Concord</HI> was the last that got in, who first came to <HI>Berwick</HI> and then to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> where he was carefully provided for, and had a skilful Surgeon to attend him. The Report he gave me was, That after Capt. <HI>Lovewell</HI> was kill'd, and Lieut. <HI>Farewell</HI> and Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> wounded, that Ensign <HI>Wyman</HI> took upon him the command of the shattered Company, who behaved himself with great Prudence and Courage, by animating the Men and telling them, <HI>That the Day would yet be their own, if their Spirits did not flag</HI>; which en∣liven'd them anew, and caused them to fire so briskly, that several discharged between twenty and thirty times apiece. He further added, that Lieut. <HI>Farewell,</HI> with Mr. <HI>Fry</HI> their Chaplain, <HI>Io∣siah Iones,</HI> and himself, who were all wounded, march'd towards the Fort; but <HI>Iones</HI> steer'd ano∣ther way, and after a long fategue and hardship got safe into <HI>Saco.</HI> Mr. <HI>Fry</HI> three days after, thro' the extremity of his Wounds, began to faint and languish, and died. He was a very worthy and promising young Gentleman, the bud of whose Youth was but just opening into a Flower.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Iacob Fullam,</HI> who was an Officer and an only Son, distinguish'd himself with much brave∣ry. One of the first that was kill'd was by his hand; and when ready to encounter a second,
<PB N="115" REF="002796_0062_0FE63BB279FDD728"/>
it's said, that he and his Adversary fell at the very instant by each others Shot· Mr· <HI>Farewell</HI> held out in his return till the eleventh day; du∣ring which time he had nothing to eat but Wa∣ter and a few Roots which he chewed; and by this time the Wounds thro' his Body were so mortified, that the Worms made a thorow Pas∣sage. The same day this <HI>Davis</HI> caught a Fish which he broil'd, and was greatly refresh'd there∣with; but the Lieut. was so much spent, that he could not taste a bit. <HI>Davis</HI> being now alone in a melancholy desolate state, still made toward the Fort, and next day came to it, where he found some Pork and Bread, by which he was enabled to return as before-mentioned.</P>
<P>Just as I had finished this Account, I saw the <HI>Historical Memoirs</HI> of the ingenious Mr. <HI>Symmes,</HI> wherein I find two things remarkable, which I had no account of before: One was of Lieut. <HI>Robins,</HI> who being sensible of his dying state, de∣sired one of the Company to charge his Gun and leave it with him, being perswaded that the <HI>Indians</HI> by the Morning would come and scalp him, but was desirous of killing one more be∣fore he died. The other was of <HI>Solomon Kies</HI>▪ who being wounded in three places, lost so much Blood as disabled him to stand any longer; but in the heat of the Battle, calling to Mr. <HI>Wyman</HI> said, he was a dead Man; however said that if it was possible he would endeavour to creep into some obscure hole, rather than be insulted by these bloody <HI>Indians</HI>: But by a strange Provi∣dence, as he was creeping away, he saw a Ca∣noo in the Pond, which he roll'd himself into,
<PB N="116" REF="002796_0063_0FE5F581811920C0"/>
and by a favourable Wind (without any assistance of his own) was driven so many miles on, that he got safe unto the Fort.</P>
<P>In 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 31.11, 12, 13. it is recorded to the immortal Honour of the Men of <HI>Iabesh Gilead,</HI> that when some of their renowned <HI>Heroes</HI> fell by the hand of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> that they prepared a decent Burial for their Bodies.</P>
<P>Now so soon as the Report came of Capt. <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vewell</HI>'s defeat, about fifty Men from <HI>New-hampshire</HI> well equipt, marched unto <HI>Pigwackett</HI> for the like end, but were not so happy as to find them: But Col. <HI>Tyng</HI> from <HI>Dunstable,</HI> with Capt. <HI>White</HI> who went afterwards, buried twelve; where at a little distance they found three <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> among whom was <HI>Paugus,</HI> a vile and bloody Wretch. Now the reason why no more of the Enemy could be found, was because it's customa∣ry among them to conceal their dead, and bury them in some places of obscurity.</P>
<P>Give me leave here again to relate (as I did before respecting Col. <HI>Hilton</HI>) that six or eight Days before Capt. <HI>Lovewell</HI> was defeated, we had a current Report several miles round of his being so, with little or no variation both as to Time and Circumstances.</P>
<P>Our encountering the Enemy at such a di∣stance was so terrible and surprizing, that they never found any body after. And tho' our Acti∣ons in this War can bear no comparison with those of our <HI>British</HI> Forces, (which have caused the World to wonder) yet not to mention the bravery of these Worthies, who died in the Bed of Honour, and for the interest of their Coun∣try,
<PB N="117" REF="002796_0063_0FE5F581811920C0"/>
would be a denying them the Honour that is due unto their Memory, and a burying them in Oblivion.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Wyman,</HI> who distinguish'd himself in such a signal manner, was at his return presented with a Silver hilted Sword and a <HI>Captains</HI> Commission. <HI>Edward Lingfield</HI> was also made an Ensign, and the <HI>General Assembly</HI> (to shew a grateful Acknow∣ledgment to the Soldiers, and a compassionate Sympathy unto the Widows and Orphans,) or∣dered the Sum of <HI>fifteen hundred pounds</HI> to be given them, under a certain regulation. And for a fur∣ther encouragment of <HI>Volunteers,</HI> ordered <HI>four Shil∣lings</HI> a day out of the Publick to be paid every one that would enlist, besides the bounty of <HI>one hundred pounds a Scalp.</HI> Upon which a great ma∣ny brave Men under the Command of Capt. <HI>White,</HI> Capt. <HI>Wyman,</HI> and others went out, but the Extremity of the Heat prevented their Marching far. Many of them sickned of the Bloody Flux, and some dyed after their return; particularly Capt. <HI>White</HI> and Capt. <HI>Wyman,</HI> whose Deaths were very much lamented.</P>
<P><HI>Saquarexis,</HI> and <HI>Nebine,</HI> one a Hostage and the other a Prisoner belonging to the <HI>English,</HI> being desirous of visiting their old Acquaintance, had liberty granted them on their <HI>Parole</HI>; who after some time returned and gave an Account, that the <HI>Indians</HI> were generally disposed to a <HI>Peace,</HI> for that the losses they met with, and the daily Ter∣rour
<PB N="118" REF="002796_0064_0FE63BB9E88A6EE8"/>
they were under made their lives miserable▪ After this they went out again, and meeting with several others, they represented their ready desires of having a Treaty of <HI>Pacification</HI> with the <HI>English.</HI> Upon which Col. <HI>Walton,</HI> from <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> Col. <HI>Stoddard</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wainwright,</HI> from the <HI>Mas∣sachusets,</HI> were appointed Commissioners to go unto <HI>St. Georges</HI> to hear and report what they had to offer. They arrived there <HI>Iuly</HI> the second, and sent the said two <HI>Indians</HI> with a Letter unto their Chiefs, letting them know that they were come; who in six days after appeared under a Flag of Truce.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Bean</HI> the Interpreter was sent to meet them. They brought a Letter from <HI>Winnenim∣mit</HI> their Chief <HI>Sagamore,</HI> which was wrote in <HI>French.</HI> The import of which was to congratu∣late the <HI>Gentlemens</HI> Arrival on a design of <HI>Peace,</HI> which they earnestly desired to treat about, pro∣vided they might do it safely; being under some fear and jealously. And indeed they had Cause of being so, for that about ten days before under a Flag of Truce, some of the <HI>English</HI> Treache∣rously attempted to lay violent Hands upon them, but lost one in the Skirmish, and had another wounded, which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the occasion of the like un∣happy disaster that afterwards hapned unto Capt. <HI>Saunders</HI> in <HI>Penobscot</HI> Bay. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y then moved, that in as much as many of their Men were scat∣tered, (being out a hunting) that our Gentlemen would stay a little, which they consented to. And five days after, <HI>Seven</HI> came in under a Flag of Truce, making the usual signal; and informing the Commissioners they would wait on them to
<PB N="119" REF="002796_0064_0FE63BB9E88A6EE8"/>
Morrow; who after a friendly Entertainment were dismist. The next day their whole Body came within a quarter of a Mile of the Garrison desiring the <HI>English</HI> to come to them; which they refused, saving, that they were sent from the several <HI>Governments</HI> to hear what they had to offer; but assured them that if they came to them no injury should be offered. After a short con∣sultation they comply'd, provided that the <HI>English</HI> would engage it <HI>in the Name of God.</HI> And then the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent in thirteen of their <HI>Chiefs,</HI> expecting the like number of <HI>English</HI> to be sent them. So soon as they met, the Commissioners demanded what they had to offer, who complimented them with the great satisfaction they had in seeing them in so peaceable a disposition, and that it was also the intent and desire of their hearts. It was then ask'd wherefore they made War upon the <HI>English</HI>? Who replied, because of their Encroach∣ments upon their Lands so far <HI>Westward</HI> as <HI>Cape-Nawagen,</HI> where two of their Men as they said were beaten to Death. Unto which 'twas an∣swered, That that very Land was bought by the <HI>English,</HI> and that the Deeds from their Predeces∣sours were ready to be shewn; And admitting it was true what they said, that the <HI>English</HI> did so inhumanly beat two of their <HI>Indians,</HI> yet it was not justifiable in them (according to the Articles of Peace) to commence a War at once, without first making Application to the <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernment,</HI> who at all times were ready to do them justice.</P>
<P>This Conference being over, they propos'd a further <HI>Treaty</HI>; which after some debate was re∣solved to be at <HI>Boston.</HI> They then moved for a
<PB N="120" REF="002796_0065_0FE63BC6759D6338"/>
<HI>Cessation of Arms,</HI> but our Commissioners, having no power, replied, that if they went to <HI>Boston</HI> it might probably be granted. But in the mean time moved that each Party should be on their Guard, for that it was the Custom of Nations to carry on the War on both sides till matters were fully concluded. The <HI>Indians</HI> reply'd that as they desired Peace, they were resolved on calling in their young Men, promising for themselves and those also of their <HI>Tribe,</HI> that no Hostility should be formed against us.</P>
<P>The Treaty being over, Capt <HI>Loran</HI> and <HI>Ahan∣quid,</HI> who were two of their Chiefs, accompani∣ed our Gentlemen to <HI>Boston,</HI> where they were friendly Entertained, and after a Capitulation of matters, return'd in a Vessel prepared on purpose, with a promise of bringing more of their Chiefs with them in forty days after their arrival, for a final Issue of all differences.</P>
<P>Several Constructions and Censures were pass'd on this <HI>Treaty</HI>; some thinking the <HI>English</HI> were more forward for a Peace than the <HI>Indians,</HI> and that as we now knew their head quarters, might easily destroy their Corn, and disrest them in their Fishery, which would bring them to a ready composition. Altho' the <HI>Penobscot Indians</HI> seem'd <HI>Guarantee</HI> for the other Tribes, yet as we knew them Treacherous, we could put no confidence in them, but rather lay our selves open unto a Snare, and become the more secure! Something like this accordingly fell out; for on <HI>September</HI> 15th a Party of them fell on some of <HI>Cochecha</HI> while at work in the Field, where they slew one, Scalpt another, cut off the Head of a third, and
<PB N="121" REF="002796_0065_0FE63BC6759D6338"/>
carried a fourth Captive; all which belong'd to the Family of the <HI>Evans's.</HI></P>
<P>A few days after another Party attack'd a Gar∣rison at <HI>North Yarmouth,</HI> but were so stoutly re∣pulsed that they made no impression; but at their drawing off, kill'd several Cattel. Two days af∣ter some appear'd at <HI>Mowsum</HI> and then at <HI>Dama∣ris</HI> Cove, which lies <HI>Eastward</HI> of <HI>Kennebeck,</HI> and is two Leagues within the line agreed upon; where they took and burnt two Shallops which belong∣ed to <HI>Stephen Hunuel,</HI> and <HI>Alexander Soaper,</HI> whom with five Men and a Boy, they carried to the <HI>Winniganse,</HI> and knockt him on the head. Some conjectured these <HI>Indians</HI> came from <HI>Canada,</HI> o∣thers that they belong'd to the <HI>Eastward,</HI> for that an <HI>English Iacket</HI> was afterwards seen on one of them; but the <HI>Eastern Indians</HI> laid it on the o∣ther.</P>
<P>At the same time the <HI>English</HI> had several Com∣panies out, as at <HI>Amarascoggin, Rockamagug, Na∣ridgwalk,</HI> &amp;c. Where Col. <HI>Harmon</HI> and others went, but made no discovery. Some thought that <HI>We</HI> hereby infring'd on the Articles made be∣tween rhem and us, unto which it may be repli∣ed, that these places were not within the <HI>Penob∣scot</HI> Line; and altho' they promis'd to do what they could in restraining others from falling on the <HI>English,</HI> yet as several Scouts from other Places were then out, they could not absolutely engage for them; Wherefore it was now requi∣site for us to secure our Frontiers.</P>
<P>About the 28th <HI>September</HI> 1725 Capt <HI>Dwight</HI> of Fort <HI>Dummer</HI> sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out a Scout of six Men <HI>West,</HI> who being upon their return sat down to Refresh
<PB N="122" REF="002796_0066_0FE63BC677D8F388"/>
themselves; and hearing a noise like Runing, looked up, and saw fourteen <HI>Indians</HI> just upon them. Our Men fired at the Enemy, but were soon over powr'd by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who kill'd two, took three and one escaped.</P>
<P>The forty days before mentioned for coming in of the <HI>Penobscot Indians,</HI> with those of the other Tribes being near twice expired, gave great un∣easiness for fear of some Mischief that was design∣ed. But in the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> the several Captains hereafter mentioned came in, <HI>viz. Sauguaaram,</HI> alias <HI>Sorun, Arexus, Francois Xavier, Megannumba,</HI> where the following <HI>Submission</HI> and <HI>Agreement</HI> was concluded on.</P>

<P>Thus we have seen the Events of <HI>twenty three</HI> Years, in most of which we have heard nothing but the <HI>sound of the Trumpet, and the alarm of War.</HI> And in the time of the intervening Peace, we met with many Interruptions and Acts of Hosti∣lity, which prevented the growth of our <HI>Eastern</HI> Settlements.</P>
<P>It's surprizing to think that so small a num∣ber of <HI>Indians</HI> should be able to distress a Coun∣try
<PB N="128" REF="002796_0069_0FE63BE5E5FE7C78"/>
so large and populous, to the degree we have related. The <HI>Charge</HI> of the War in the last three Years was no less than <HI>One hundred and seventy thousand pounds</HI>; besides the constant Charge of watching, warding, scouting, making and re∣pairing of Garrisons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which may modestly be computed at upwards of <HI>seventy thousand pounds</HI> more. Yet after all, the Enemy have but little cause of Triumph; for that one third of them (at least) have been destroy'd, and one of their Tribes so shattered (at <HI>Naridgwalk</HI>) that they are never more like to make any formidable head.</P>
<P>Now as <HI>Peace</HI> seems once more to be con∣cluded by the <HI>Treaty</HI> beforementioned, the great∣est Difficulty will be to support and maintain it. If <HI>Trading Houses,</HI> which are now resolved on, (by the Wisdom of the Gover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment) be well re∣gulated, it may (under God) be a means of our Tranquility: Especially if the Govern∣ment can also prevail with them to receive the <HI>Ministry</HI> for their instruction in the Principles of the true Religion.</P>
<P>But altho' it was agreed on with the several <HI>Delegates</HI> that the <HI>Treaty</HI> should be ratified and confirmed in a publick and solemn manner by the <HI>Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fs</HI> of the several <HI>Tribes</HI> of the Eastern <HI>In∣di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> at <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmouth</HI> in <HI>Casco-Bay,</HI> some time in the Month of <HI>May</HI>; yet when that time came they were not ready for it, but seem'd for some time uncertain and dilatory. Nevertheless the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> from time to time received Advices of their continued desires of Peace; and resolving that the failure should not be on our part, His <HI>Ho∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur the Lieutenant Governour</HI> with a <HI>Quorum of Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>The <HI>Penobscot Tribe</HI> only appeared, but in be∣half of all the <HI>other</HI> Tribes.

<P>The <HI>Lieut.

Discretion and Prudence of the <HI>Salvages</HI> was ob∣servable, as well as the Wisdom, Justice, Equity and Tenderness of the <HI>Governours</HI> on our part.</P>
<P>One of the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st things that the <HI>Indians</HI> desired of our <HI>Governours</HI> was, That they would give or∣der that the <HI>Vessels</HI> in the Harbour as well as the <HI>Taverns</HI> ashore might be restrained from selling any Liquors to their Young Men. The <HI>Gover∣nour</HI> told them, that he very much approved of that, and would give order accordingly.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday,</HI> July 30th when the Conference for the day was over, the <HI>Lieut. Governour</HI> told them, "To Morrow is the <HI>Lords-Day,</HI> on which we do no Business. <HI>Loron,</HI> their Speaker, an∣swered readily, "To Morrow is our <HI>Sabbath-Day</HI>; we also keep the Day.</P>
