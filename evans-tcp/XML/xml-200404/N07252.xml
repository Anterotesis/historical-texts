of Mr. Secretary <HI>Pitt,</HI> and the immortal Gen∣eral
<HI>Wolfe,</HI> are given here as Specimens of the Stile
in which Doctor <HI>Smollet</HI> has written his History of
<HI>England,</HI> and his History of the present glorious
War in <HI>Germany, America,</HI> and in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West
Indies.—</HI><Q><HI>William Pitt,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was appointed Paymaster
General of the Forces, and Privy Counsellor: He
displayed a surprizing Extent and Precision of po∣litical
Knowledge, an irrisistble Energy of Argu∣ment,
and such Powers of Elocution, as struck
his Hearers with Astonishment and Admiration.
It flashed like the Lightning of Heaven against
the Ministers, and Sons of Corruption, blasting
where it smote and withering the Nerves of Op∣position;
but his more substantial Praise was
founded upon his disinterested Integrity, his un∣corruptible
Heart, his unconqurable Spirit of Inde∣pendence,
and his invariable Attachment to the
Interest and Liberty of his Country.</Q>—The fol∣lowing
is the Character given by Dr. Smollett of Ge∣neral
Wolfe.—<Q>The Death of General Wolfe
was a national Loss, universally lamented. He
inherited from Nature, an animating Fervour of
Sentiment, an intuitive Perception, an extensive
Capacity, and a Passion for Glory, which stimu∣lated
him to acquire every Species of military
Knowledge that Study could comprehend, that
actual Service could illustrate and confirm. This
noble Warmth of Disposition seldom fails to earl
forth and unfold the liberal Virtues of the Soul.
Brave above all Estimation of Danger, he was
also generous, gentle, complacent, and humane;
the Pattern of the Officer, the Darling of the
Soldier: There was a Sublimity in <HI>his Geni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>s</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="009259_0010_0F706A92891B2188"/>
which soared above the Pitch of ordinary
Minds; and had his Faculties been exercised to
their full Extent by Opportunity and Action;
had his Judgment been fully matured by Age
and Experience, he would, without Doubt, have
rival'd in Reputation the most celebrated Cap∣tains

<HI>Melmoth,</HI> one of the most ingenious Writers of the

is by no Means their principal Recommendation:
They receive a much higher Value, as they exhibit
one of the most amiable and animating Characters.
Pliny's whole Life seems to have been employed in
the Exercise of every generous and social Affection:
To forward modest Merit, to encourage ingenious
Talents, to vindicate oppressed Innocence, are some
of the glorious Purposes to which he devoted his
Power, his Fortune, and his Abilities.</P>

<P>82 <HI>A new and General Biographical Dictionary;</HI> con∣taining
an Historical and Critical Account of the Lives

Nation; particularly the British and Irish; from the
earliest Accounts of Time to the present Period.
Wherein their remarkable Actions or Sufferings,
their Virtues, Parts, and Learning are particularly
displayed; with a Catalogue of their Literary Pro∣ductions.—As
it is unnecessary to shew the use∣fulness
of an accurate Historical Account of such
persons and facts as have been the objects of pub∣lick
attention in all Ages and Nations, nothing more
can be expected in a preface to this work, than an
account of the manner in which it is executed, and
the reasons why it was not thought to be precluded
by any other work of the same kind that is already
extent.</P>
<P>The principal of these works are Bayle's Historical
and Critical Dictionary; the General Dictionary;
the Biographia Britanniaa; the Athenae Oxonienses;
and Mr. Collier's Historical Dictionary.</P>
<P>Bayle's Work is in 5 large Volumes in Folio, yet
there are many persons of great eminence both an∣tient
and Modern, whom Bayle has not so much as
<PB N="19" REF="009259_0020_0F706A99F5C745E0"/>
named, though he has mentioned others of whom
nothing is known, but that they were the occasion
of the subject of some useless controversy, the very
Terms of which few understand, and the Merits of
which a small part even of those few are disposed to
examine. Bayle's Lives are indeed nothing more
than a Vehicle for his Criticism, and his Work
seems to have been chiefly the transcript of a vo∣luminous
Common-place-book, in which he inserted
his own remarks on the various authors he had read,
and gratified his peculiar turn of mind by discussing
their opinions and correcting their mistakes; it is
therefore rather a miscellany of critical and meta∣physical
speculation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>, than a system of Biography.
The General Dictionary, as it includes Bayle, is
so far liable to the same objection: it is indeed aug∣mented
with other Articles, but they are also writ∣ten
in Bayle's manner, and for that Reason the
work upon the whole is not much better adapted
to general use. There are many redundancies, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there are many defects; and there is besides an
objection of more weight though of another kind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>
the work consisting of no less then ten volumes in
folio, for which the purchaser must pay more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>
so many Pounds.</P>
<P>The Biographia Britannica, is indeed much more
an historical work than Bayle's, but it is written up∣on
a much less extensive plan; it contains the Lives
of those eminent persons only who were born in
Great Britain and Ireland, and of these the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ne are selected, though many others have a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>∣gree
of eminence sufficient to render them objects
of general curiosity.</P>
<P>The Athenae Oxonienses is written on a plan still
more contracted, for it contains an account of such
authors only, as reueived their academic education
at the University of Oxford; so that neither, nor
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of these performanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>, however voluminous and
<PB N="20" REF="009259_0021_0F706A9B4C597408"/>
expensive, contain what ought to be found in an
Universal Biographical Dictionary, and such is the
work which we now offer to the Publick.</P>
<P>This contains some account of every life that has
been sufficiently distinguished to be recorded; not
indeed a list of all the names that are to be found
in chronological and regal tables, for of many no∣minal
rulers both of the Church and State, it can
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ly be said that they lived and died; but a judi∣cious
narrative of the actions or writings, the ho∣nours
and disgraces of all those whose Virtues, Parts,
Learning, or even Vices, have preserved them from
oblivion in any writing, of whatever age and in
whatever language.</P>
<P>This Work will therefore naturally include a his∣tory
of the most remarkable and interesting transac∣tions,
an historical account of the progress of learn∣ing,
and an abstract of all opinions and principles
by which the world has been influenced in all its ex∣tent
and duration. We have been particularly care∣ful
to do justice to the learned and ingenious of our
<HI>own Country,</HI> whose works are justly held in the
highest esteem; and we have also been attentive to
the instruction and amusement of the Ladies, not
only by decorating our work with the Names of all
who have done honour to the Sex, but by making
our account of others sufficiently particular to excite
and gratify curiosity; and, where the subject would
admit, to interest the passions, without wearying
attention by minute prolixity or idle speculations.</P>
<P>In the execution of this plan we have not had re∣course
merely to dictionaries, nor contented ourselves
with supplying the defects of one dictionary from
another, and cutting off the redundancies of all;
but we have collected from every performance in
every language that had any relation to our design.
For the lives of authors, we have had recourse to
their works, and for the lives of others, to the best
<PB N="21" REF="009259_0022_0F706A9BF459E6B8"/>
memoirs that are extant concerning them; we shall,
however, notwithstanding the extent of our under∣taking,
and the labour and expence necessary to the
execution of it, comprize this work within Twelve
volumes in Octavo, and sell them for Six Shillings
a volume; so that the price of the whole will be no
more than three pounds twelve shillings when bound.
In a work so various, the materials of which are so
numerous, diffused and dissimilar, we have endea∣voured
to select in every instance, what was in it∣self
most eligible; we hope therefore that when our
Readers consider what we have done, they will not
withhold their approbation, upon a mere supposition
that we might have done more. Those who are
acquainted with the pains and attention requisite for
the compiling of great works, will readily excuse any
small defects that may have escaped us. The Au∣thors
hope for success from the candid and judicious
only, whose approbation of this work, it is their
utmost ambition to obtain, as it has been their
earnest endeavours to merit.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>de Voltaire,</HI> is one of the few happy authors
who have lived to enjoy the full fruits of the most
extensive reputation. He has lived to see his fame
flourishing, not only in his own country, but also
diffused over all the civilized kingdoms and states of
<HI>Europe;</HI> among which he is universally admired for
the fire of his genius, the brilliancy of his wit, the
poignancy of his satire, the elegance of his stile: in
a word, for that nameless talent which operates like
a charm, engaging the reader's attention and ap∣plause,
even in spite of himself, and as it were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>en∣dering
the performance inchanting alike to persons
of every age, nation, character, and complexion.</P>
<P>But how much soever he may be admired in other
countries, he seems to be peculiarly adapted by na∣ture,
for the entertainment of the English People,
distinguished as he is by that impetuosity of genius,
that luxuriancy of imagination and freedom of spirit,
which have characterized the most eminent poets of
the British nation.</P>
<P>This congenial affinity remarkably appears in that
eagerness with which his works are procured, trans∣lated,
and perused by the natives of Great Britain:
an impatience attended with some inconvenience,

translated into the English language separately, by
different hands, with very different degrees of merit,
published in various parcels, according to the re∣spective
schemes and abilities of the different editors
and translators, who selected from the whole such
pieces only as they imagined would best suit their
particular purposes: thus the translation of <HI>Voltaire's</HI>
works hath been left incomplete with respect to the
general plan, as well as irregular in regard to the
printing and paper, the size and execution of the se∣parate
volumes.</P>
<P>It may also be pronounced defective in another
sense. Our author's imagination is so warm and
impetuous, that it often transports him from image
to image, and from sentiment to sentiment, with
such rapidity as obliges him to leave the picture half
disclosed, and the connexion unexplained. In his
prose-writings, he usually bursts into the subject,
and throws a glare of light on some particular part,
as if he took it for granted that the reader had
before considered it in every other attitude and point
of view. This velocity of impulse, added to a re∣markable
passion for peculiarity in point of sentiment,
hath hurried him into some obscurities, inadverten∣cies,
and errors, especially in the execution of his
historical tracts, which of all his works, are the
most universally read for entertainment and instruc∣tion.—
In order, therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>, to do justice to his me∣rit,
and at the same time supply his defects, we pro∣pose
to publish a complete and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>egular translation of
all his works, illustrated with Notes historical and
critical, which may correct his mistakes, elucidate
his obscurities, point out his beauties, and explain
his allusion to the satisfaction of the public.</P>
<P>There are already Eight Volumes of this Work
published, and a Volume continues to be published
in <HI>England,</HI> at the Beginning of every Month.</P>

<P>Without complaining of Injustice, I
will tell you, in my turn, in what light these
Letters appear to me; not so much to excuse
their defects, as to discover their source. The
perceptions of Persons in Retirement are very
different from those of People in the great World;
their Passions being differently modified, are dif∣ferently
exprest; their imaginations constantly
imprest by the same Objects, are more violently
affected. The same small number of Images
constantly return, mix with every Idea, and
create these strange and false notions so Re∣markable
in People who spend their Lives in soli∣tude;
but does it follow that their Language is
Energi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>? No; 'tis only Extraordinary: It is in
our Conversation with the World that we learn
to speak with Energy; first, because we must spea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>
differently and better than others, and then, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="72" REF="009259_0073_0F706AC384E6F588"/>
every Moment obliged to affirm what may not be
believed, and to express Sentiments which we do
not Feel, we endeavour at a persuasive manner
which supplies the place of interior persuasion.
Do you believe that People of real Sensibility ex∣press
themselves with that Vivacity, Energy, and
Ardour, which you so much Admire in our Drama
and Romances? No; true Passion, full of itself,
is rather Diffusive than Emphatical; it does not
even think of persuasion, as it never supposes that
its Existence can be doubtful. In Expressing its
feelings it speaks rather for the Sake of its own
Ease, than to I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>form others. Love is painted
with more Vivacity in large Cities, but is it in
the Village therefore less Violent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that the weakness of the Expression
is a Proof of the strength of their passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes, at least, it is an Indica∣tion
of its Reality. Read but a Love-Letter
written by an Author who Endeavours to Shine
as a Man of Wit: If he has any Warmth in his
Brain, his Words will set Fire to the Paper; but
the Flame will spread no farther: You may be
charmed, and perhaps a little moved, but it will
be a fleeting Agitation which will leave nothing
except the Remembrance of Words. On the
contrary, a Letter really directed by Love, written
by a Lover influenced by a real Passion, will be
Tame, Diffuse, Prolix, Unconnected, and full
of Repetitions; his Heart overf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>owing with the
same Sentiment, constantly returns to the same
Expressions, and like a natural Fountain flows
continually without being exhausted. Nothing
Brilliant, nothing Remarkable; one Remembers
neither Words nor Phrases; there is nothing to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> admired, nothing striking; yet we are moved
without knowing why. Though we are not struck
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Sentiment, we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> touched with
<PB N="73" REF="009259_0074_0F706AC40CE8A448"/>
its Truth; and our Hearts, in spite of us, sym∣pathize
with the Writer. But Men of no sensi∣bility,
who know nothing more than the Flowery
Jargon of the Passions, are ignorant of those
Beauties and despise them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am all Attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rousseau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, I say, that in real Love-Letters,
the Thoughts are common, yet the Stile
is not Familiar. Love is nothing more than an
Illusion; it creates for itself another Universe;
it is surrounded with objects which have no Exis∣tence
but in Imagination, and its Language is
always Figurative; but its Figures are neither just
nor regular; its Eloquence consists in its disorder;
and when it reasons least, it is most convincing.
Enthusi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>sm is the last degree of this Passion.
When it is arrived at its greatest height, its object
appears in a state of Perfection; it then becomes
its Idol; it is placed in Heaven; and as the Enthu∣siasm
of Devotion borrows the Language of Love,
the Enthusiasm of Love also barrows the Language
of Devotion. Its Ideas present nothing but Para∣dise,
Angels, the virtue of Saints, and the delights
of Heaven. In such Transport, surrounded by
such Images, is it not natural to expect sublime
Language? Can it possibly debase its Ideas by
vulgar Expressions? Will it not, on the contrary,
raise its Style, and speak with adequate Dignity?
What then becomes of your <HI>Epistolary Style?</HI> It
would do mighty well, to be sure, in writing to
the object of one's adoration: in that case they
are not letters, but hymns.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall see what the world will say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rousseau.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; rather see the winter on my
head. There is an age for experience, and ano∣ther
for recollection. Our sensibility may be
extinguished by time; but the soul, which was
once capable of that sensibility, remains. But to
<PB N="74" REF="009259_0075_0F706AC4D1D07490"/>
return to our letters: If you read them as the
work of an author who endeavours to please, or
piques himself on his writing, they are certainly
detestable. But take them for what they are,
and judge of them in their kind. Two or three
young people, simple, if you will, but sensible,
who mutually express the real sentiments of their
hearts, without an intention to display their wit.
They know and love each other too well, for
self-admiration to have any influence among them.
They are young, and therefore think like young
people. They are not natives of France, how
then can they be supposed to write correctly?
They lived in solitude, and therefore could know
but little of the world. Entirely filled with one
single sentiment, they are in a constant delirium,
and yet presume to philosophise. Would you
have them know how to observe, to judge, and
to reflect? No; of these they are ignorant; but
they are versed in the art of love, and all their
words and actions are connected with that passion.
Their ideas are extravagant, but is not the im∣portance
which they give to these romantic notions
more amusing, than all the wit they could have
displayed. They speak of every thing; they are
constantly mistaken; they teach us nothing, ex∣cept
the knowlege of themselves; but in making
themselves known, they gain our affection. Their
errors are more engaging, than the wisdom of the
wise. Their honest hearts, even in their trans∣gressions,
bear still the prejudice of virtue, always
confident, and always betrayed. Nothing answers
their expectations; every event serves to undeceive
them. They are deaf to the voice of discouraging
truth: They find nothing correspond with their
own feelings, and therefore, detaching themselves
from the rest of the universe, they create, in their
<PB N="75" REF="009259_0076_0F706AC5A6225C10"/>
separate society, a little world of their own,
which presents an entire new scene.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, that a young fellow of twenty,
and girls of eighteen, though not uninstructed,
ought not to talk like philosophers, even though
they may suppose themselves such. I own also,
for this distinction has not escaped me, that these
girls became wives of merit, and the young man
a better observer. I make no comparison between
the beginning and the end of the work. The
detail of domestic occurrences may efface, in some
measure, the faults of their younger years: The
chaste and sensible wife, the worthy matron, may
obliterate the remembrance of former weakness.
But even this is a subject for criticism: The con∣clusion
of the work renders the beginning repre∣hensible:
One would imagine them to be two
different books, which ought not to be read by
the same people. If you intended to exhibit ra∣tional
personages, why would you expose them
before they were become so? Our attention to
the lessons of wisdom is destroyed by the child's
play, by which they are preceeded: We are scan∣dalized
at the bad, before the good can edify us.
In short, the reader is offended, and throws the
book aside in the very moment when it might
become serviceable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rousseau.</SPEAKER>
<P>One the contrary, I am of opinion,
that to those who are disgusted with the beginning,
the end would be entirely super<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>luous; and that
the beginning will be agreeable to those readers to
whom the conclusion can be useful. So that those
who do not read to the end will have lost nothing,
because it was an improper book for them; and
those to whom it may be of service would never
have read it, if it had begun with more gravity.
Our lessons can never be useful, unless they are so
<PB N="76" REF="009259_0077_0F706AC6377F2B28"/>
written as to catch the attention of those for whose
benefit they were calculated.</P>
<P>I may have changed the means, and not the
object. When I endeavoured to speak to <HI>men,</HI>
I was not heard; perhaps in speaking to children
I shall gain more attention; and children would
have no more relish for naked reason, than for
medicines ill disguised.</P>

<P>Here again I am afraid you are de∣ceived;

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rousseau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it so; it will not be my fault; I
shall have done all in my power to make it palat∣able.
My young folks are amiable; but to love
them at thirty, it is necessary to have kown them
have when they were ten years younger. One must
lived with them a long time to be pleased with
their company; and to taste their pegins, it is
necessary we should first have deplored their sail∣ings.
Their letters are not interesting at first;
but we grow attached by degrees, and can neither
continue nor quit them. They are neither elegant
easy, rational, sensible, nor eloquent; but there is
sensibility which gradually communicates itself to
our hearts, and which at last is found to supply the
place of all the rest. It is a long romance, of which
no one part has proper effect. At least, such were
its effects upon power to move us, and yet the
whole produces a me; pray were not you touched
in reading it?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>iend.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; yet I can easily conceive your
being affected; if you are the author, nothing can
be more natural; and if not, I can still account
for it. A man of the world can have no taste for
the extravagant ideas, the affected pathos, and
false reasoning of your good folks; but they will
suit a recluse, for the reason which you have
given; now, before you determine to publish the
manuscript, you would do well to remember that
<PB N="77" REF="009259_0078_0F706AC6F524CC20"/>
the world is not composed of hermits. All you
can expect is that your young gentleman will be
taken for a Celadon, your Lord B. for a Don
Quixote, your young damsels for two Astreas,
and that the world will laugh at them for a com∣pany
of fools. But a continued folly cannot be
entertaining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rousseau.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very reason which would make
you suppress this work, will induce me to print it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! the certainty of its not being
read?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rousseau.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little patience, and you will un∣derstand
me. As to morals, I believe that all
kinds of reading are useless to people of the world;
first, because the number of new books which
they run through, so generally contradict each
other, that their effect is reciprocally destroyed.
The few choice books which deserve a second
perusal, are equally ineffectual; for, if they are
written in support of received opinions, they
are superfluous; and if in opposition, they are
of no use; they are too weak to break the chain
which attaches the reader to the vices of society.
A man of the world may possibly, for a moment,
be led from his wonted path by the dictates of
morality; but he will find so many obstacles in
the way, that he will speedily return to his former
course. I am persuaded there are few people,
who have had a tolerable education, that have
not made this essay, at least once in their lives;
but, finding their efforts vain, they are discouraged
from any future attempt, and consider the morality
of books as a jargon of idleness. The farther we
retreat from business, great cities, and numerous
societies, the more the obstacles to morality di∣minish.
There is a certain point of distance where
these obstacles cease to be in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>urmountable, and
there it is that books may be of use. When we
<PB N="78" REF="009259_0079_0F706AC7B77B2BB8"/>
live in solitude, as we do not then read with a
design to display our reading, we are less anxious
to change our books, and bestow on them more
reflection; and as their principles find less opposi∣tion
from without, their internal impression is
effectual. In retirement, the want of occupation
obliges those, who have no resource in themselves,
to have recourse to books of amusement. Ro∣mances
are more read in the provincial towns than
at Paris, in towns less than in the country, and
there they make the deepest impression; the reason
is plain.</P>
<P>Now it happens unfortunately that the books
which might amuse, instruct, and console the
people in retirement, who are unhappy only in
their own imagination, are generally calculated
to make them still more dissatisfied with their
situation. People of rank and fashion are the sole
personages of all our romances. The refined taste
of great cities, court maxims, the splendour of
luxury, and epicurean morality; these are their
precepts, these their lessons of instruction. The
colouring of their false virtues tanishes their real
ones. Polite manners are substituted for real
duties, fine sentiments for good actions, and vir∣tuous
simplicity is deemed want of breeding.</P>
<P>What effect must such representation produce
in the mind of a country gentleman, in which his
freedom and hospitality is turned into ridicule,
and the joy which he spreads through his neigh∣bourhood
is pronounced to be a low and contemp∣tible
amusement? What influence must they not
have upon his wife, when she is taught, that the
care of her family is beneath a lady of her rank;
and on his daughter, who being instructed in the
jargon and affectation of the city, disdains for his
clownish behaviour, the honest neighbour whom
she would otherwise have married. With one
<PB N="79" REF="009259_0080_0F706AC9D5873EE8"/>
consent, ashamed of their rusticity, and disgusted
with their village, they leave their antient man∣sion,
which soon becomes a ruin, to reside in the
metropolis; where the father, with his cross of
St. Lewis, from a gentleman becomes a sharper;
the mother keeps a gaming-house; the daughter
amuses herself with a circle of gamesters; and
frequently all three, after having led a life of
infamy, die in misery and dishonour.</P>
<P>All our productions verge to the same goal.
Tales, romances, comedies, all are levelled at
the country; all conspire to ridicule rustic simpli∣city;
they all display and extol the pleasures of
the great world; it is a shame not to know them;
and not to enjoy them, a misfortune. How many
of those sharpers and prostitutes, with which Paris
is so amply provided, were first seduced by the
expectation of these imaginary pleasures? Thus
prejudice and opinion contribute to effect the
political system by attracting the inhabitants of
each country to a single point of territory, leaving
all the rest a desert; thus nations are depopulated,
that their capitals may flourish; and this frivolous
splendor with which fools are captivated, makes
Europe verge with celerity towards its ruin. The
happiness of mankind requires that we should
endeavour to stop this torrent of pernicious
maxims. It is the business of the clergy to tell us
that we must be good and wise, without con∣cerning
themselves about the success of their dis∣courses;
but a good citizen, who is really anxious
to promote virtue, should not only tell us to be
good, but endeavour to make the path to happi∣ness
agreeable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, my good friend, take breath for
a moment. I am no enemy to useful designs;
and I have been so attentive to your reasoning,
that I believe it will be in my power to continue
<PB N="80" REF="009259_0081_0F706ACA44108318"/>
your argument. You are clearly of opinion, that
to give to works of imagination the only utility of
which they are capable, they must have an effect
diametrically opposite to that which their authors
generally propose; they must combat every hu∣man
institution, reduce all things to a state of
nature, make mankind in love with a life of
peace and simplicity, destroy their prejudices aud
opinions, inspire them with a taste for true plea∣sure,
keep them distant from each other, and in∣stead
of exciting people to crowd into large cities,
persuade them to spread themselves all over the
kingdom, that every part may be equally en∣livened.
I also comprehend, that it is not your
intention to create a world of Arcadian shepherds,
of illustrious peasants labouring on their own acres,
and philosophising on the works of nature, nor
any other romantic beings which exist only in
books; but to convince mankind that in rural life
there are many pleasures which they know not
how to enjoy; that these pleasures are neither so
insipid nor so gross as they imagine; that they
are susceptible of taste and delicacy; that a sensible
man, who should retire with his family into the
country, and become his own farmer, might
enjoy more rational felicity, than in the midst of
the amusements of a great city; that a good
housewife may be a most agreeable woman, that
she may be as graceful and as charming as any town
coquet of them all: in short, that the most tender
sentiments of the heart will more effectually animate
society, than the artificial language of polite circles,
where the ill-natured laugh of satyre is the pitiful
substitute of that real mirth which no longer exists.
Have I not hit the mark?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rousseau.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the very thing; to which I will
add but one reflection. We are told that romances
disturb the brain: I believe it true. In continually
<PB N="81" REF="009259_0082_0F706ACB6C4DDBA0"/>
displaying to the reader the ideal charms of a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>tituation very different from his own, he becomes
dissatisfied, and makes an imaginary exchange for
that which he is taugh: to admire. Desiring to
be that which he is not, he soon believes himself
actually metamorphosed, and so becomes a fool.
If, on the contrary, romances were only to ex∣hibit
the pictures of real objects, of virtues and
pleasures within our reach, they would then make
us wiser and better. Books which are designed to
be read in solitude, should be written in the lan∣guage
of retirement; if they are meant to in∣struct;
they should make us in love with our situa∣tion;
they should combat and destroy the maxima
of the great world, by shewing them to be false
and despicable, as they really are.</P>
<P>Those who aspire to same must calculate their
works for the meridian of Paris; but those who
write with a view to do good, must write for the
country. How many worthy people are there
who pass their lives in cultivating a few paternal
acres, far distant from the metropolis, and
who think themselves exiled by the partiality
of fortune? During the long winter even∣ings,
deprived of society, they pass the time in
reading such books of amusement as happen to
fall into their hands. In their rustic simplicity,
they do not pride themselves on their wit or learn∣ing,
they read for entertainment rather than in∣struction;
books of morality and philosophy are
entirely unknown to them. As to your romances,
they are so far from being adapted to their situa∣tion,
that they serve only to render it insupporta∣ble.
Their retreat is represented to be a desert,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that whilst they afford a few hours amusement,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prepare for them whole months of regret
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech" DISP="〈…〉"/> Why may I not suppose that,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech" DISP="〈…〉"/> this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ook, like many
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech" DISP="〈…〉"/> into the hands
<PB N="82" REF="009259_0083_0F706ACBD5B25240"/>
of those inhabitants of the fields, and that the
pleasing picture of a life exactly resembling theirs
will render it more tolerable? I have great pleasure
in the idea of a married couple reading this novel
together, imbibing fresh courage to support their
common labours, and perhaps new designs to
render them useful. How can they possibly con∣template
the representation of a happy family
without attempting to imitate the pleasing model?
How can they be affected with the charms of
conjugal union, even where love is wanting,
without increasing and confirming their own at∣tachment?
In quitting their book, they will nei∣ther
be discontented with their situation, nor dis∣gusted
at their labour: on the contrary, every
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> around them will assume a more delightful
aspect, their duties will seem ennobled, their taste
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>or the pleasures of nature will revive; her genuine
sensations will be rekindled in their hearts, and
per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>iving happiness within their reach, they will
learn to taste it as they ought: they will perform
the same functions, but with another soul; and
what they did before as persants only, they will
now transact as real patriarohs.</P>
