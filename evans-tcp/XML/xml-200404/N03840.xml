<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Discourse appears
from the Press in its own De∣fence,
against the <HI>Character</HI> or
Account given of it by Mr.
<HI>Whitefield,</HI> (in his last <HI>Continuation of his
Iournal,</HI> commencing <HI>Iune 25th, 1740, p.</HI>
12.) in these Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>In the Morning (<HI>Sunday</HI> July 13th)
I went to Church, and heard the <HI>Com∣missary</HI>
preach. But had some INFERNAL
SPIRIT been sent to draw <HI>my Picture,</HI>
I think it scarcely possible he could paint
me in more horrid Colours. I think if
ever, then was the Time that all Manner
of Evil was spoke against me falsely for
<HI>Christ</HI>'s Sake. The <HI>Commissary</HI> seem'd
to ransack Church History for Instances
of <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> and abused Grace; HE
DREW A PARALLEL between me, and
all the <HI>Oliverians, Ranters, Quakers,
French Prophets,</HI> 'till he came down to
<PB N="4" REF="004721_0004_0000000000000000"/>
a Family of the <HI>Dutarts,</HI> who lived
(not many Years ago) in <HI>South-Carolina,</HI>
and were guilty of the most notorious
<HI>Incests</HI> and <HI>Murders.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In these Words, I say, (and 'tis a Won∣der
not prefaced with, <HI>the Meekness and
Gentleness of</HI> CHRIST) Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> has
censured the following Discourse; but with
what <HI>Truth</HI> or <HI>Iustice</HI> I shall leave the
<HI>Reader</HI> to judge, after assuring him, that
as it now appears from the <HI>Press,</HI> it is a
<HI>full</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> Copy of what was delive∣red
from the <HI>Pulpit.</HI> Some few Sentences
indeed are here and there interspersed by
Way of <HI>Enlargement,</HI> under the <HI>second</HI> and
<HI>third</HI> Heads, but nothing <HI>omitted;</HI> but un∣der
the <HI>first</HI> Head, treated of in the <HI>last</HI>
Place, and on which the Censure falls, there
is neither <HI>Addition, Omission,</HI> or <HI>Alteration</HI>
of so much as a <HI>single</HI> Word throughout the
Whole; excepting only the Names of the
<HI>Dutartre</HI>'s Family added, and the <HI>Date</HI>
of their Trial.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reader</HI> will easily observe, that the
plain and professed Scope of the <HI>censured</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004721_0005_0000000000000000"/>
Part of the Discourse was, to call my
<HI>Hearers</HI> to their Guard, against that <HI>Bane</HI>
of true Religion, <HI>Enthusiasm;</HI> by pointing
out, and cautioning them against the <HI>first</HI>
Causes, Springs, and beginnings of it, and also
by shewing in <HI>various</HI> Instances, the horrible
<HI>Excesses,</HI> both in <HI>Theory</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> to
which such Beginnings <HI>may grow.</HI> And
thus agreeably had Mr. <HI>Whitefi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ld</HI> repre∣sented
it; nay, and moreover added, that
probably the Discourse was occasioned by,
and levelled against <HI>himself,</HI> as an upstart
<HI>Enthusiast,</HI> just entered on the <HI>Race,</HI> scat∣tering
about some <HI>wild</HI> and <HI>fanatick</HI> No∣tions,
and run into some <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>immo∣ral</HI>
Practices, <HI>Disturbance</HI> of the Church's
Peace, <HI>Disobedience</HI> to Superiours, <HI>Slander</HI>
and <HI>Abuse,</HI> thus levelled, I say, against
<HI>himself,</HI> and cautioning my <HI>Hearers</HI> against
such <HI>Beginnings,</HI> as of no small Danger, to
what <HI>Excess</HI> of Error and Immorality they
might grow: Such Representation I should
have taken <HI>no</HI> Exception to. But instead
of this, to represent it as he has done; as
containing not only <Q>as horrid a <HI>Picture</HI>
of him as the <HI>Devil</HI> himself could have
<HI>painted,</HI> but also a <HI>Parallel</HI> actually
<PB N="6" REF="004721_0006_0000000000000000"/>
<HI>drawn</HI> 'twixt him and all the <HI>Oliveri∣ans,
&amp;c.</HI> down to the <HI>Dutarts,</HI> who
were guilty of the most notorious <HI>Incest</HI>
and <HI>Murders;</HI></Q> I much rather chuse to
leave to the Censure of others, than be
tempted to return him his own Language.
But after all, I must take leave to let Mr.
<HI>Whitefield</HI> know, that if the Discourse af∣fords
any <HI>Picture,</HI> or any <HI>Features</HI> or
<HI>Lines</HI> of any <HI>Picture,</HI> that he is conscious
will fit him; or if it affords any <HI>Parallel</HI>
which he is <HI>conscious</HI> then subsisted, or
which <HI>now</HI> subsists, or may <HI>hereafter</HI>
subsist 'twixt <HI>him</HI> and any of the <HI>Enthusiasts</HI>
therein mentioned, with Respect either to
<HI>Principles</HI> or <HI>Practices,</HI> he is very wel∣come
to either or both of them, for I mean
not to make him any the least <HI>Apology.</HI></P>
<P>By this time the <HI>World</HI> is pretty well ac∣quainted
with this <HI>Gentleman's</HI> Manner of
<HI>Iournalizing</HI> both <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Things,</HI> so
as to answer the one Point in View. If his
Measure of <HI>Slander</HI> and <HI>Abuse</HI> is not yet
full, it must soon be so: And therefore a
few <HI>Remarks</HI> will suffice (and which I
shall take this Opportunity to offer) on the
<PB N="7" REF="004721_0007_0000000000000000"/>
several <HI>other</HI> Passages of his <HI>Iournals,</HI> in
which I have the Honour to be mentioned.</P>
<P>From Page 14th to the 22d of the afore∣said
<HI>Continuation &amp;c.</HI> he gives an Account
of what he calls <HI>the Commissary's Dealings
with him,</HI> that is, the Proceedings of the
<HI>Ecclesiastical Court</HI> against him: But
which is so stufft with his own <HI>Impertinence</HI>
he was indulged in, beneath remarking on;
and so full of <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Mistakes</HI> (not∣withstanding
he had a <HI>Copy</HI> of all Proceed∣ings
in his Hands) as would take more space
than can be well afforded to correct; and
therefore I shall content myself only to ob∣serve
by way of Specimen.</P>
<P>1. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s <HI>Integrity</HI> of Beha∣viour
in this Affair. He assures me to my
Face (<HI>Iournal continued from</HI> January 11,
1739, P. 16) that <Q>he would regard my
Suspension as much as a Pope's Bull.</Q>
Well; he is se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" REASON="faint" DISP="••"/>ed with a <HI>Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" REASON="faint" DISP="••••"/>,</HI> and
accordingly app<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" REASON="faint" DISP="•••"/>s and falls a Quibbling
at the <HI>Iurisdiction</HI> of the Court; and after
having set down the several crude Things
he said on that Head, the Words of his
<PB N="8" REF="004721_0008_0000000000000000" MS="y"/>
<HI>Iournal</HI> are these—<Q>I therefore upon
the whole humbly desired as a Favour
from the Court, that I might have 'till
to-Morrow 9 o'Clock, to inform myself
of the Extent of their Ecclesiastical Juris∣diction
in this Province, ASSURING THEM
THAT UPON FINDING THEIR AUTHORI∣TY
VALID, I WOULD IMMEDIATELY AN∣SWER
TO ANY INTERROGATORIES, AND
WOULD BE READY TO RECEIVE ANY
SETENCE THEY COULD WITH JUSTICE
PASS UPON ME.</Q>—Now on this
<HI>Promise</HI> or <HI>Assurance</HI> his Request was
granted; but what was the Event? Did
not Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> consult some <HI>Gentlemen</HI>
of the <HI>Law</HI> concerning the <HI>Validity</HI> of the
Court's Jurisdiction? And did not they
satisfy him that it was <HI>valid?</HI> And did he
not accordingly own himself so satisfied in
open Court? Tho' afterwards, at the Check
of his <HI>Advocate,</HI> he shuffled and retracted
it! And yet after all this, did he perform
his <HI>Promise</HI> which he made the <HI>Court?</HI>
No, he did not; but instead of <HI>receiving</HI>
and <HI>answering</HI> to the <HI>Articles</HI> objected, or
abiding any <HI>Sentence</HI> upon them, he brings
a <HI>Recusation of the Iudge,</HI> founded chiefly
<PB N="9" REF="004721_0009_0000000000000000"/>
on the <HI>following</HI> Discourse which I had
preached the <HI>Sunday</HI> next before, and which
therefore it was necessary to represent in
<HI>such</HI> a Light as he has done. Alas; poor
<HI>Youth,</HI> what was he afraid of? A <HI>Pope's
Bull!</HI> <Q>This <HI>Recusatio Iudicis</HI> (saith he
Page 19.) I exhibited by the Advice of my
Friends, not to quibble with, or evade
the Force or Rigour of any Law what∣soever,
that I might justly fall under.</Q>
A genuine Piece of <HI>Methodism!</HI> If his
Friends advised him to bring his <HI>Racusation
of the Iudge,</HI> not to avoid the Force or
Rigour of any Law, he mig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/> <HI>justly</HI> fall
under; then it must be, to avoid the
Force or Rigour of some Law, which he
might <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>t</HI> justly fall under; that is, an <HI>un∣just
Sentence:</HI> But if, by <HI>regarding my
Suspension as much as a Pope's Bull,</HI> he
meant <HI>honestly</HI> (for the Words admit of
Ambiguity) that he would have no Regard
to it at all; why then did he hearken to
any Advice of either <HI>Friends</HI> or <HI>Foes</HI> about
it? And if he thereby really meant me a
Complement, of paying the greatest Regard
to my Suspension; even in such Case, had
he <HI>stood</HI> the Trial, and <HI>illegal</HI> and an <HI>unjust</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="004721_0010_0000000000000000"/>
Sentence had been given against him, he
had the <HI>same</HI> Remedy as in the Case of Re∣pelling
his <HI>Recusation,</HI> viz. an <HI>Appeal;</HI> and
consequently no Manner of Reason for his
<HI>Breach of Promise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>P. 21. His Words are these.</HI> <Q><HI>He (the
Commissary) desired me to deposite</HI> Ten
Pounds <HI>Sterling, and to</HI> swear, <HI>that I
would lodge my Appeal within a Twelve-Month.</HI></Q>
<HI>Let Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>see to it:
The Oath he took was.</HI> That within One
Year next ensuing that Day, he would <HI>bona
fide</HI> prosecute the Appeal then by him inter∣posed
in that Cause, and cause the Prose∣cution
the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>eof to be authentically certified
into this Court.</P>
<P>P. 22. He mentions a <HI>private</HI> Conversa∣tion
he had with me, after the Affair of
his <HI>Appeal</HI> was finished; and the following
Particulars of it. <Q>That I charged him
with <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> for saying if it was in
his Power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> <Q>That he charged me
with accusing the <HI>Methodists</HI> in general,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> <Q>And that he asked why I ridi∣culed
him for making Grimaces in the
<PB N="11" REF="004721_0011_0000000000000000"/>
Pulpit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> By all which and the An∣swers,
the Reader will be greatly instruc∣ted.
As to my charging him with <HI>Blas∣phemy,</HI>
his Account is <HI>partial</HI> and <HI>unfair.</HI>
I objected indeed, that his <HI>Behaviour,</HI> ever
since he had been cited to appear before me,
had been very <HI>base</HI> and insidious, in <HI>haran∣guing</HI>
the Populace every Day, to <HI>excite
their Passions</HI> against me as a <HI>Persecutor,</HI>
(when he must know in his Conscience I
was but doing my bounden Duty) and at
the same Time professing such <HI>Flights of
Love</HI> for me, that <Q>were it in his Power,
he <HI>would place me at the Right Hand of</HI>
GOD;</Q> Which <HI>Phrase,</HI> I observed, be∣ing
every where in holy Scripture appro∣priated
to <HI>Christ,</HI> GOD-MAN, when ap∣plied
to any other <HI>in terminis</HI> and without
Restriction, sounded but too much as if the
Meaning were to <HI>displace CHRIST,</HI> which
would be <HI>Blasphemy.</HI></P>
<P>But why did not Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> instead
of these <HI>Dregs</HI> of the Conversation, give
the main <HI>Substance</HI> of it; which turned on
this <HI>Question,</HI> which I very seriously asked
him, viz. <HI>Whether he was in</HI> Jest <HI>or</HI> Ear∣nest
<PB N="12" REF="004721_0012_0000000000000000"/>
<HI>in the Scene he was carrying on in the
World?</HI> In Answer, he affirmed that he
was in <HI>Earnest,</HI> and that it was the Work
of God he was carrying on; and for the
Truth of which, he appealed (1st) to his <HI>in∣ward
Feelings;</HI> and (2dly) to the <HI>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ward
visible Effects</HI> of his Preaching, <HI>viz</HI> the
<HI>Crouds</HI> that attended it, and the <HI>Numbers</HI>
proselyted to his Doctrine, and wondered
how I could doubt of these being God's
<HI>Seals</HI> to his Ministry, or sure and certain
<HI>Evidence</HI> of his Approbation of it, by the
Aids, Influences, and Operations of his <HI>holy
Spirit</HI> attending it. On which Answer I
easily observed; (1st) That as to his <HI>inward
Feelings,</HI> whatever they were, or what <HI>Evi∣dence</HI>
soever they might be to <HI>him,</HI> they
could be <HI>none</HI> to <HI>me,</HI> nor to any <HI>other</HI> Per∣son
breathing but <HI>himself</HI> only. (2dly)
As to the outward visible <HI>Effects</HI> of his
P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>eaching, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Crouds</HI> attending it,
and the <HI>Numbers</HI> proselyted to his Doctrines
I o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>served, that the <HI>same</HI> Effects, and in
still <HI>greater</HI> D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>grees, attended the Ministry
of <HI>Mahomet, Muncer, Fox, Nailor,</HI> and
<HI>Muggleton,</HI> and therefore that such Effects
can be no <HI>better</HI> Evidence of the <HI>Divine</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="004721_0013_0000000000000000"/>
Approbation of <HI>his</HI> Ministry, than they
were of <HI>theirs,</HI> who carried on, not the
Work of <HI>God,</HI> but of the <HI>Devil</HI> plainly.
And (3dly) that it must be either <HI>meer</HI> Ar∣tifice
or <HI>strong</HI> Delusion, in him, to ascribe
those <HI>Effect,</HI> to the Power or Influences of
the holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>ch are very
plainly owing to a <HI>natural</HI> Cau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>e, <HI>viz.</HI> his
<HI>Talent of Delivery,</HI> or Voice and Vehe∣mence
in Speaking, adapted to take the
Ear and excite the Passions of his Hearers.
I bid him only to put the <HI>same</HI> Words,
which from <HI>his</HI> Mouth produced the boa∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>d
Effects, into the Mouth of an <HI>ordina∣ry</HI>
Speaker, and see whether the <HI>same</HI> Ef∣fects
would be the Consequence. To the
1st and 2d Particulars he made no Reply,
To the latter Part of the 3d, he answer'd in
these precise Words, that <HI>the Words of God
would not have the same Effect from the
Mouth of a</HI> fal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Prophet, as of a</HI> true.
On which I desired him to say, what he
meant by a <HI>true Prophet</HI> in Contradistinc∣tion
to a <HI>false</HI> one? He said, he meant a
Person not only regularly called to the <HI>Mi∣nistry</HI>
of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> by the <HI>outward</HI> Call
or Order of the Church, but who was tru∣ly
<PB N="14" REF="004721_0014_0000000000000000"/>
<HI>regenerate</HI> by the holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> in his
Sense of Regeneration, and had the <HI>same</HI>
Feelings of the <HI>Spirit's inward</HI> Call to that
Office, and Influences and Operations in it,
as he <HI>himself</HI> had; and that without these
no one's Ministry would be attended with
<HI>such</HI> Eff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>cts as his was, even supposing he
preached the <HI>same</HI> true Doctrines of the <HI>Gos∣pel.</HI>
—In Answer to this, I bid him to
cease his Arrogance, and consult the 26th
<HI>Article</HI> of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> Moreover
adding, that if the <HI>boasted</HI> Effects of his
<HI>Preaching</HI> depended on his <HI>Regeneration</HI>
and <HI>Feelings</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> how came it
to pass, that the <HI>same</HI> Effects did not fol∣low
the <HI>Preachings</HI> of the Two <HI>Wesleys,</HI>
of <HI>Seagrave, Ingham, Kinchin, &amp;c.</HI> whom
he allowed to be <HI>equally</HI> regenerate Men,
and equally to have the <HI>same</HI> Feelings of
the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as he <HI>himself</HI> claimed or preten∣ded
to?</P>
<P>This is the <HI>main</HI> Substance of what pas∣sed
in that Conversation, which continued
not exceeding <HI>Half an Hour;</HI> and in the
Close of which, 'tis very true, he told me
(in Answer to every Thing, and especially
<PB N="15" REF="004721_0015_0000000000000000"/>
the last mentioned) that he believed me to
be <HI>an unregenerate Man, an Enemy to
God,</HI> and <HI>of a like Spirit with the Persecu∣tor</HI>
Saul. And thus, by calling me hard
Names to my Face (whom in a former
<HI>Iournal</HI> he h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>d stiled <HI>a good Soldier of</HI> Je∣sus
Christ) the Gentleman <HI>delivered his
Soul in this Conversation with the Commis∣sary.</HI></P>
<P>P. 8. <Q><HI>Sunday Iuly</HI> 6. Went to
Church Morning and Evening, and hear'd
the Commissary preach as <HI>virulent</HI> and
<HI>unorthodox, inconsistent a Discourse,</HI> as
ever I heard in my Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> That Dis∣course
is contained Word for Word in the
<HI>Third</HI> of the <HI>Six</HI> Letters to him, which are
now before the World.</P>
<P>P. 23. <Q><HI>Sunday Iuly</HI> 20th. Preached
this Morning as usual, and went after∣wards
to Church to hear the Commissary.
His Text was, <HI>Take heed how ye hear.</HI></Q>
I have been often told by Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s
Hearers, that however he <HI>shifted</HI> his Texts,
yet generally his Discourses were still much
the <HI>same,</HI> and that many of them would
<PB N="16" REF="004721_0016_0000000000000000"/>
equally have suited any <HI>other</HI> Texts in the
<HI>Bible</HI> as those from which they were
preached. But whatever his own Practice
may be, as to regarding or not regarding
his Texts, yet sure when he pretends to
<HI>journalize</HI> an Account of any other Prea∣cher's
Discourse, he ought not to <HI>blunder</HI>
in asserting the <HI>Text,</HI> as he has here done.
For the <HI>Text</HI> here mentioned was not my
<HI>Text</HI> of the <HI>20th Iuly,</HI> but of the <HI>13th,</HI> e∣ven
of the Discourse in which he alledges I
drew so lovely a <HI>Picture</HI> of him, and which
I now publish; and my Discourse on the
<HI>20th,</HI> which he here speaks of, was on these
Words of <HI>St Paul,</HI> COL. 4th, 17th. <HI>And
say to Archippus, take heed to the Ministry
which thou hast received of the Lord, that
thou fulfil it.</HI> This shews how careful our
<HI>Iournalist</HI> is, and what Credit is to be gi∣ven
to his <HI>Iournals.</HI></P>
<P>P. 25th. <Q>I endeavour'd to stop their
(the People) Resentment against the <HI>Com∣missary</HI>
as much as possible, and recom∣mended

Anthony</HI> behaved towards the Conspirators,
in the Case of <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI></P>
<P>The Account he has given (in his next
preceding <HI>Continuation of his Iournal,</HI> P.
15 and 16.) of the <HI>first</HI> Conference 'twixt
us after he commenced. <HI>Apostle,</HI> and at
which I turned him and his Disciples out of
my House, is partly <HI>defective,</HI> partly <HI>false,
warped</HI> and <HI>mangled</HI> throughout. He has
<HI>omitted</HI> to say, that the Bells were chiming
for Morning Prayer when he came to my
House, and that I therefore desired to post∣pone
our Conference 'till the Afternoon:
—That he gave no Ear to this, but im∣me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>iately
said, he supposed I had heard of
<HI>his Charges</HI> against the <HI>Clergy;</HI> and that it
was very true he <HI>charged</HI> them with <HI>three
Things,</HI> which he distinctly mentioned Word
for Word as I now set them down. 1st,
That they preach <HI>false Doctrines,</HI> contrary
to the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and the <HI>Articles</HI> of the
Church. 2dly, that they are guilty of <HI>Hypo∣crisy,
in subscribing</HI> to the <HI>Articles</HI> of the
Church, while yet they do <HI>not believe</HI> them.
And 3dly, that they are <HI>idle</HI> and <HI>negligent</HI> of
their Duty. He has <HI>omitted</HI> what passed on
the Subject of <HI>Iustification by Faith aloue;</HI>
but which is contained more at large in my
<PB N="18" REF="004721_0018_0000000000000000"/>
printed Letters. He has <HI>omitted</HI> the
Reason he gave for not using the <HI>Liturgy</HI>
of the Church, when he officiated in F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>las
or <HI>Meeting-Houses, viz</HI> That the <HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>n</HI>
meant only publick Prayers in <HI>Churches.</HI>
He has mentioned <HI>Balls</HI> and <HI>Assemblies</HI> in
<HI>Charles-Town</HI> as of dangerous Consequence
to Religion, without giving any Account or
Description of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>m; which therefore I must
take leave to supply. The <HI>Balls</HI> in
<HI>Charles-Town</HI> were the usual Breakings up
of the <HI>Dancing-School</HI> twice a Year, when
Parents and Relations generally went to see
the Children's Improvement. The <HI>Govern∣ment</HI>
also on the <HI>Anniversary,</HI> either of his
Majesty's <HI>Accession</HI> or <HI>Birth-Day,</HI> usually
made an Entertainment of a Dinner for
the <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> and of a Supper and <HI>Ball</HI>
for the <HI>Lad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>es</HI> in the Evening. Acciden∣tally
also <HI>transient</HI> Gentlemen have given
such <HI>Entertainments,</HI> on their leaving the
Place; but very rarely. So that the whole
Number of <HI>Balls</HI> in <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> never
exceeded 5 or 6 in a Year, and but seldom
3 or 4, and some Years there have been
none at all.—And as to the <HI>Assemblies,</HI>
there never was any such Thing in the
<PB N="19" REF="004721_0019_0000000000000000"/>
Place, 'till about 2 or 3 Years ago some
10 or 12 <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and their <HI>Ladies,</HI> of
the first <HI>Figure</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> in the Place,
agreed to meet during the <HI>Winter Season</HI>
only, and one Evening in a Week, to
pass 2 or 3 Hours in Conversation, or any
other <HI>innocent</HI> Diversion or Amusement.
Nor did ever this <HI>fiery Creature,</HI> nor any
of his <HI>begetting</HI> here, dare to charge that
<HI>Assembly</HI> with any the least <HI>Excess</HI> either of
<HI>Drinking</HI> or <HI>Gaming,</HI> or with the least <HI>Sus∣picion</HI>
of any sort of <HI>Vice</HI> or <HI>Immorality</HI>
whatsoever. So that 'tis very true, it never
entered my Thoughts to preach against it,
no more than against Friends, Neighbours,
or Acquaintance Meeting together to pass
a Winter's Evening in their own private
Houses. And I very freely declare, that
had there appeared to me <HI>but half</HI> the Dan∣ger
to <HI>Religion,</HI> or the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI>
of Society, from such <HI>Balls</HI> and <HI>Assemblies,</HI>
which has but too plainly appeared from his
<HI>Mobb-Preachings,</HI> and the <HI>Assemblies</HI> of
his Institution, of Men and Women,
Boys and Girls, <HI>building up one another</HI> in
Conceit of their being <HI>righteous,</HI> and not
only <HI>despising</HI> but <HI>damning all others</HI> round
<PB N="20" REF="004721_0020_0000000000000000"/>
about them, I should have preach'd against
them with all my Might.—He has <HI>fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="•••"/>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>d</HI>
in asserting me <HI>in a Rage</HI> and again <HI>in a
very great Rage,</HI> in this Conference; but
without which his <HI>whole</HI> Narrative of it
had lost its <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>main</HI> Aim. 'Tis ve∣ry
true <HI>I rebuked him sharply</HI> on his three
<HI>Articles</HI> of Accutation against the Body of
the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and his <HI>sawcy</HI> Letter to the Bi∣shop
of <HI>Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ucester:</HI> 'Tis also true, and
known to all that know me, that when I
talk on any serious and important Matter,
I naturally do it with some <HI>Emotion</HI> and
<HI>Earnestness:</HI> But as I must know what
passes in my own Breast, I can solemnly
assure the World, that I was in <HI>no Rage</HI> on
this Occasion, but really on my <HI>guard</HI> a∣gainst
it, as <HI>knowing the Man and his Com∣munication;</HI>
and that as to my bidding him
<HI>to depart my House,</HI> 'tis no more than I
would have done, in the <HI>calmest</HI> Mood of
Life, either before or since, to any one
breathing, not my Superiour, who had be∣haved
in so <HI>extravagant</HI> and <HI>assuming</HI> a
Manner.</P>
<P>And thus I have finished my Remarks,
at present, on the Passages of his <HI>Iournals</HI>
relating to me; but farther to shew the
<PB N="21" REF="004721_0021_0000000000000000"/>
Trim of the Man, I shall take Leave to
add, how much the same sort of <HI>defective,
mangled</HI> and <HI>falsified</HI> Account he has pu∣blished,
of his <HI>Conference</HI> with the <HI>Com∣missa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>y</HI>
and some others of the <HI>Clergy</HI> at
<HI>Boston;</HI> tho' he owned they <HI>treated him
with more Civility.</HI></P>
<P>He has <HI>omitted</HI> to say, how he fum∣bled
in that Conference, on the Doctrine of
<HI>Iustification.</HI> He has <HI>omitted</HI> the <HI>Reply</HI>
made to his demanding the <HI>Signs</HI> of the bap∣tized
Infant's Regeneration, and desiring the
<HI>Commissary</HI> to watch if the Child brought
forth the <HI>Fruits of the Spirit; viz.</HI> that
<HI>Baptism</HI> itself was the <HI>Sign;</HI> that as to <HI>other</HI>
Signs there appeared as many of its <HI>Rege∣neration</HI>
as of its <HI>Reason;</HI> and that as the
<HI>Infant</HI> growing up might abuse, and
depart from the due Use and Improvement
of its <HI>Reason,</HI> so it might of its <HI>Rege∣neration,</HI>
which only secured its Salvation
during its infant State, and before it came
to undo itself by <HI>actual</HI> Sins and Trans∣gressions.—But
this <HI>instantaneous</HI> Rege∣neration
of Infants in <HI>Baptism</HI> (I take Leave
to add) is not the Regeneration which he
preaches; which is a Regeneration from
<HI>actual Habits</HI> of Sin in <HI>adult</HI> Persons after∣wards
<PB N="22" REF="004721_0022_0000000000000000"/>
and which ought rather to be call'd
<HI>Reformation, Repentance,</HI> or <HI>Conversion.</HI>
And so St. <HI>Augustine</HI> distinguisheth.—
<HI>Renovatio</HI> (saith he) <HI>quae fit ad Imaginem
Dei, non momento uno fit, sicut momento
uno fit i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>la in Baptismo Renovatio, Remis∣sione
omnium Peccatorum.</HI> AUG de T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>in.
L. 14. C. 17. He has <HI>omitted</HI> to say, that
he was ignorant of the <HI>Rubrick</HI> asserting the
<HI>undoubted Salvation</HI> of <HI>baptized Infants,</HI>
and obliged the <HI>Clergy</HI> to rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>, before he
would allow it; and that afterwards calling
for a <HI>Text</HI> of Scripture to prove it, he was
answered, what need to prove it to him,
who had <HI>suscribed</HI> it? Or to that Effect.
But above all, his Account of what passed
on the <HI>16th Article</HI> of the Church, is most
surprizing. He asserted (he says) that a
true Child of God, tho' he might fall <HI>fouly,</HI>
yet could never fall <HI>finally.</HI> Dr. <HI>Cut∣ler</HI>
objected the <HI>16th Article,</HI> which says,
—<HI>after we have received the Holy Ghost,
we may depart from Grace given, and fall
into Sin.</HI> To which he answered, but ob∣served
what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ollows, <HI>and by the Grace of
God we MAT arise again.—</HI> Now if he
had thus fairly cited the <HI>Article,</HI> how in
<PB N="23" REF="004721_0023_0000000000000000"/>
the World could it have serv'd his Purpose,
or answer'd to support his Assertion, that
<HI>a true Child of God could never fall finally?</HI>
For, what only MAY <HI>be,</HI> MAY <HI>not be;</HI>
and as the <HI>Article</HI> only says, <HI>we</HI> MAY
<HI>arise again,</HI> it implies, that <HI>we</HI> MAY <HI>not
arise again.</HI> But he knows what <HI>Trick</HI> he
would have put upon the <HI>Doctor.</HI> For in
citing this Part of the <HI>Article,</HI> he omit∣ted
the Word [MAY] and clap'd the Word
[SHALL.] into the Room of it;—<HI>we</HI>
SHALL <HI>arise again.</HI> Which obliged that
truly learned and worthy <HI>Divine</HI> to correct
him, by laying a strong <HI>Emphasis</HI> on the
Word [MAY] <HI>we</HI> MAY <HI>arise again.</HI></P>
<P>And here that this 16th <HI>Article</HI> comes in
my Way, puts me in Mird, how widely
the <HI>old-Calvinists</HI> differed from the <HI>modern</HI>
Ones, in their Judgment about our <HI>Arti∣cles.</HI>
The <HI>old-Calvinists</HI> were far from
judging our <HI>Articles</HI> to be <HI>Calvinistical,</HI> or
that they were drawn up according to <HI>that</HI>
Scheme. They plainly saw the Doctrines
of <HI>universal Redemption,</HI> and <HI>falling from
Grace,</HI> contained in them, (Art. 31, and 16)
which blow up <HI>that</HI> Scheme, and break
<PB N="24" REF="004721_0024_0000000000000000"/>
its fine <HI>Chain</HI> of Doctrines all to Pieces:
And therefore they complained and called
for a Reformation of the <HI>Articles,</HI> both be∣fore,
and at the <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> Confe∣rence,
(See <HI>Coll.</HI> Eccles. Hist.) and again
after the <HI>Restoration.</HI> (See Bishop <HI>Pear∣son</HI>'s
no Necessity of reforming the Doc∣trines
of the Church of <HI>England.</HI>) And
Dr <HI>Waterland,</HI> I think, fairly proves (<HI>Sup∣plement
to</HI> Arian <HI>Subscrip.</HI>) that the <HI>Ar∣ticles</HI>
were not form'd by <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Scheme,
but according to <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Antiquity.</HI>
—How differently our <HI>modern Calvinists</HI>
judge of them, I need not say.—But to
return,</P>
<P>He has owned that he said, he saw <Q>re∣generate
Souls among the Baptists, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
But has supressed, his asserting his pecu∣liar
<HI>Gift</HI> of <HI>Discernment.</HI> And I take
Leave to instance in his Two Fellow-Labourers,
<HI>Rowland</HI> and <HI>Cross</HI> in the <HI>Ier∣seys.</HI></P>
<P>If the Bounds of this <HI>Preface</HI> would
permit, I might remark a Number of the
low <HI>Artifices</HI> of this <HI>Gentleman,</HI> both in
<PB N="25" REF="004721_0025_0000000000000000"/>

then there's great <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Success!</HI> And
down it goes in the <HI>Iournal</HI> accordingly.
Again, if he perceives his Audience to keep

Stories that ever was heard of, with what
<HI>Malice, Rage,</HI> and <HI>Fury</HI> I had persecuted
him, so as just with the <HI>Skin of his Teeth</HI>

were so.</HI> On which Mr. <HI>Iones</HI> (unwarily

of such violent Proceedings. This was e∣nough,

now <HI>cast him out,</HI> and turned him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Satan</HI> to be buffetted; and Reasons enough
they had for it. He became much too
popular, and thence headstrong and ungo∣vernable.
He was but just initiated into

be suffered, as <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>bversive</HI> of their Rule
and Authority, and endangering the <HI>whole</HI>
Scheme; and therefore he must be <HI>dropt,</HI>
or some how got clear of, at all Events.
<HI>They</HI> and <HI>he</HI> had hitherto run the same <HI>en∣thusiastick</HI>
Race, and therefore they saw
plainly there was <HI>no dropping</HI> him, without
<HI>altering the Course.</HI> This <HI>they</HI> resolve to
do. And accordingly <HI>they</HI> who had long
boasted of their being <HI>enlightened</HI> with the
<HI>true Faith, regenerate, justified,</HI> and in the
alone true State of Salvation, and had run
<PB N="29" REF="004721_0029_0000000000000000"/>
about in the World, with much Diligence
and no less Assurance, to <HI>enlighten</HI> others;
began to <HI>doubt</HI> a little of Matters, and
whether their <HI>Faith</HI> was in reality what
they had boasted it to be. Their <HI>Doubts</HI>
continued rather encreasing 'till God was
pleased to send them a Man (<HI>Peter Boh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>er,</HI>
a <HI>Moravian</HI> Brother, or Saint of <HI>Hern∣buth</HI>)
who quickly convinced them, that
all this while, they had been without the
<HI>least</HI> Degree of <HI>true Faith,</HI> and wandering
in <HI>Egyptian</HI> Darkness. He taught them,
that <Q><HI>true Faith</HI> excludes all Doubting,
and that two inseparable Fruits of it are;
(1st) a Sense or full Assurance of the
Pardon of all <HI>past</HI> Sins; and (2dly) a
Dominion over, or Freedom from all <HI>pre∣sent</HI>
Sins.</Q> This they boggled at a little;
but their Eyes were soon opened, and they
were established in this <HI>new</HI> and <HI>true</HI> Faith.
And now poor <HI>Whitefield</HI> is <HI>dropt</HI> effectual∣ly,
and left in the Lurch with that old
<HI>Trumpery</HI> FAITH, REGENERATION, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
they had begat him to. He may come

<P>There is a new Sect sprung up in <HI>Swit∣zerland,</HI>
which spreads very much in the

call themselves <HI>Pietists,</HI> and as Enthusiasm
carries Men generally to the like Extrava∣gancies,
they differ but little from several

to turn away their Eyes from a beautiful
Prospect. To avoid, as much as is possible,
what the World calls innocent Pleasures,
lest they should have their Affections tain∣ted
by any Sensuality, and diverted from
the Love of him who is to be the only Com∣fort,
Hope, and Delight, of their whole
Beings. This Sect prevails very much a∣mong
the Protestants of <HI>Germany,</HI> as well
as those of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and has occasioned
several Edicts against it in the Dutchy of
<HI>Saxony.</HI> The Professors of it are accused
<PB N="32" REF="004721_0032_0000000000000000"/>
of all the ill Practices which may seem to
be the Consequences of their Principles, as
that they ascribe the worst of Actions,
which their own vicious Tempers throw
them upon, to the Dictates of the Holy
Spirit; that both Sexes under Pretence of
devout Conversation visit one another at
all Hours, and in all Places, without any
Regard to common Decency, often making
their Religion a cover for their Immorali∣ties;
and that the very best of them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>e
possessed with spiritual pride, and a con∣tempt
for all such as are not of their own
sect. The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, who reproach
the Protestants for their breaking into such
a multitude of religio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>s, have certainly
taken the most effectual way in the world
for the keeping their fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>cks together; I
do not mean the punishments they in flict
on Men's persons, which are commonly look∣ed
upon as the chief methods by which they
deter them from breaking through the pale
of the Church, though certainly these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ay a
very great Restraint on those of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Catholick Persu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>sion. But I take one great
Cause why there are so few sects in the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to be the Maltitude of Con∣vents
<PB N="33" REF="004721_0033_0000000000000000"/>
with which they every where abound,
that serve as Receptacles for all those fiery
Zealots who would set the Church in a
Flame, were not they got together in these
Houses of Devotion▪ All Men of dark
Tempers, according to their Degree of Me∣lancholy
or Enthusiasm, may find Convents
fitted to their Humours, and meet with
Companions as gloomy as themselves. So
that what the Protestants would call a
Fanatick, is in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church a Reli∣gious
of such or such an Order; as I have
been told of an <HI>English</HI> Merchant at <HI>Lis∣bon,</HI>
who after some great Disappointments
in the World was resolved to turn Quaker
or Capuchin; for, in the Change of Reli∣gion,
Men of ordinary Understandings do
not so much consider the Principles, as the
Practice of those to whom they go over.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE VIII. 18.</BIBL>
<Q>Take heed therefore how ye hear.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Words are connected with the
several next preceding Verses of this
<HI>Chapter,</HI> which contain our blessed Saviour's
<HI>Parable</HI> of the <HI>Sower,</HI> and his Exposition
of it to his Disciples.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Parable</HI> sets forth certain Cases,
in which ever so good <HI>Seed</HI> cast into the
Ground will perish, or bring no Fruit to
Perfection; <HI>viz.</HI> when either cast <HI>on the
Way-side,</HI> or <HI>on stony Ground,</HI> or <HI>among
Thorns;</HI> representing, in the <HI>Mythology</HI> or
<HI>Exposition,</HI> certain parallel Cases, in which
<HI>the Word</HI> (or Gospel) <HI>preached will not
profit</HI> the Hearers, i.e, will not bring forth
in them the Fruits of <HI>Faith, Repentance,</HI>
and <HI>good Works,</HI> or be of any Advantage
<PB N="2" REF="004721_0035_0000000000000000"/>
towards their <HI>Salvation:</HI> To which is sub∣join'd
this <HI>Caveat</HI> or Admonition of the
Text, <HI>Take heed therefore how ye hear.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Parable</HI> and <HI>Exposition;</HI> and
which naturally direct our Discourse on the
<HI>Words</HI> before us, to a particular Conside∣ration
of the several Things, pursuant to
the Tenor of the <HI>Parable,</HI> which we are
<HI>to take heed</HI> or beware of in Hearing, so as
<HI>the Word preached may profit us;</HI> i.e. in∣fluence
or prevail upon us, <HI>to be Doers of
the Word, and not the Hearers only, de∣ceiving
our ownselves.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>first</HI> it will be of Importance, to
premise, and carry along with us these <HI>Two</HI>
Observations.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> THAT the true Scope and Intent
of the whole <HI>Parable</HI> is, to charge the <HI>Un∣fruitfulness</HI>
of the <HI>Word</HI> to the <HI>bad</HI> Dispo∣sitions
of the <HI>Hearts</HI> of Men. For though
various other Causes there are of the <HI>Un∣fruitfulness</HI>
of <HI>Seed sown,</HI> besides the <HI>bad</HI>
Dispositions of the Ground, as <HI>Floods,</HI> or
<HI>Drought,</HI> the <HI>Caterpillar,</HI> or <HI>Canker-worm,
<PB N="3" REF="004721_0036_0000000000000000"/>
Blasts,</HI> or <HI>Mildews,</HI> &amp;c. yet none other
we find mentioned in the <HI>Parable,</HI> but the
<HI>bad</HI> Dispositions of the Ground only: And
correspondently in the <HI>Application,</HI> though
various <HI>divine</HI> Aids and Graces are as ne∣cessary
to the <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> of the <HI>Word,</HI> as
the <HI>good</HI> Dispositions of the <HI>Hearts</HI> of Men,
yet is not its <HI>Unfruitfulness</HI> charged to any
Want of the <HI>former,</HI> but of the <HI>latter</HI> of
these only; Nay, such <HI>divine</HI> Aids and
Graces are not so much as mentioned, lest
Men should <HI>charge God foolishly,</HI> by char∣ging
their Unprofitableness in Hearing to
his either <HI>total</HI> withholding, or <HI>partial</HI> and
too sparing Communications of these.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> IT is obvious also on the Face
of the <HI>Parable</HI> and <HI>Exposition,</HI> that the
<HI>bad</HI> Dispositions of Men's Hearts, which
obstruct their <HI>profitable</HI> Hearing of the
<HI>Word,</HI> are wholly owing to themselves, to
their own <HI>bad</HI> Husbandry and Neglect.—
And thence agreeably the Caveat of the
Text, <HI>Take heed therefore how ye hear;</HI>
that is, <HI>take heed</HI> that you sue all <HI>good</HI>
Husbandry and Diligence to amend those
<HI>bad</HI> Dispositions of your Hearts, which
<PB N="4" REF="004721_0037_0000000000000000"/>
through Slothfulness, or Want of due Care
and Cultivation, are grown up in them,
and obstruct your <HI>profitable</HI> Hearing of the
<HI>Word;</HI> and which we now proceed to con∣sider,
with one Variation only of the order
in which they are set down in the <HI>Parable.</HI>
And,</P>
<P>I. THE first <HI>bad</HI> Disposition of Heart,
in the Order of the <HI>Parable,</HI> which we are
<HI>to take heed</HI> of and be sure that we amend,
in order to our <HI>profitable</HI> Hearing of the
<HI>Word,</HI> is that represented or resembled by,
<HI>the Way side.</HI> But as this Disposition ob∣structs
the <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> various
Ways, and which we purpose more fully
to observe, we therefore take Leave to post∣pone
it to the <HI>last</HI> Place, and proceed,</P>
<P>II. To the <HI>second,</HI> viz. That which is
represented by <HI>the stony Ground.</HI> And by
<HI>stony Ground</HI> is well represented a Heart
<HI>incumbered</HI> with stubborn, corrupt <HI>Habits,
Lusts</HI> and <HI>Passions.</HI> What <HI>Rooks</HI> or <HI>Stones</HI>
are in a Corn-field, the same are inveterate
corrupt <HI>Habits, Lusts,</HI> and <HI>Passions,</HI> in the
Hearts of Men; and what Obstruction those
<PB N="5" REF="004721_0038_0000000000000000"/>
will be of to the <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> of <HI>Corn-seed</HI>
sowed in the one, the same will <HI>these</HI> be of
to the <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> of <HI>Gospel-seed</HI> sowed in
the other. <HI>The Seed</HI> (saith the Parable)
<HI>which fell in stony Places, sprang up,</HI> but
<HI>lacking</HI> sufficient <HI>Moisture,</HI> a little Stress
of the Sun-beams upon it, scorched it up,
and it withered away. And in like Man∣ner,
the <HI>Seed</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> falling into the
Hearts of Men incumbered with corrupt
<HI>Habits, Lusts</HI> and <HI>Passions,</HI> may spring
and grow up for a Time; but alas!
such Soil must fail of sufficient <HI>Moisture</HI>
to nourish it, thro' various Stresses, up to
Perfection. Such Men may gladly hear
and receive the <HI>Word preached;</HI> it may
<HI>spring up</HI> in their Hearts into <HI>Faith,</HI> and
even formed <HI>Resolutions</HI> of Obedience; but
alas! when they come to <HI>Practice!</HI> when
they come to <HI>add to their Faith, Vir∣tue;
and to Virtue, Knowledge; and to
Knowledge, Temperance; and to Temperance,
Patience; and to Patience, Godliness; and
to Godliness, Brotherly-kindness; and to
Brotherly-kindness, Charity;</HI> when they
come to enter on the Christian Warfare, the
<HI>Persecution</HI> of their darling <HI>Habits, Lusts
<PB N="6" REF="004721_0039_0000000000000000"/>
Passions,</HI> to <HI>cut off a right Hand,</HI> or <HI>pluck
out a right Eye;</HI> how quickly will they be
<HI>offended!</HI> How quickly will the Heat of
the Contest scorch up the tender Blade of
the Word, and wither it away! So evi∣dently
is the Gospel <HI>a great Salvation</HI> to
the human World, that when fairly offer∣ed
to the most dege<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>erate Minds, they
cannot but see it, approve of, and rejoice
in it. They cannot but see it <HI>a great Sal∣vation</HI>
to the whole Posterity of Apostate
<HI>Adam,</HI> as containing a full and plain Dis∣covery,
not only of their <HI>Bondage of Cor∣ruption;</HI>
that <HI>the whole Creation groaneth
and travaileth in Pain together,</HI> and how
or whence this Misery arose; but also of
a full and adequate Remedy; the proper
and adequate Means for <HI>delivering</HI> them
<HI>from this Body of Death,</HI> and restoring
them to <HI>the glorious Liberty of the Sons of
God,</HI> the Happiness of Life and Immortali∣ty.
The <HI>Heathens,</HI> by the Light of Na∣ture,
saw plainly this <HI>universal</HI> Bondage
of the human World: They plainly saw
themselves under it. They saw and felt <HI>Sin
reigning in their mortal Bodies;—a Law
in their Members, warring against the Law</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="004721_0040_0000000000000000"/>
of their Minds, and bringing them into
Captivity to the Law of Sin; <HI>and even to
a plain Confession, that</HI> when they would do
Good, Evil was present with them;—
<HI>and the</HI> Good which they would they did
not, but the Evil which they hated, <HI>they
were led captive</HI> to do.
<Q>Video meliora, broboque; deteriora sequor.</Q></P>
<P>THIS <HI>common</HI> sore Evil or Misery of
Mankind, the <HI>Heathens</HI> saw, felt, and con∣fessed;
but whence it <HI>originated</HI> they were
wholly ignorant; and as to any <HI>adequate</HI>
Remedy, the Discoveries of their <HI>wisest</HI> Men
were next to Darkness, and agreeably of
little or no Effect or Service at all. All
their <HI>Philosophy</HI> indeed pretended such <HI>a∣dequate</HI>
Remedy for its Object; But alas!
It was <HI>defective</HI> of the main <HI>Principles</HI> and
<HI>Motives</HI> for compassing this End. Their
greatest and <HI>wisest</HI> Men had no Knowledge
of the <HI>original</HI> State or Dignity of Human
Nature; nor how it came into its present <HI>cor∣rupt</HI>
State or Condition; nor of the manner of
the <HI>Divine</HI> Interposition necessary for Men's
Recovery; nor of the glorious End to which
<PB N="8" REF="004721_0041_0000000000000000"/>
God intends finally to conduct them: In
a Word, few or none of them had a <HI>right</HI>
Knowledge of God, much less <HI>how</HI> he was
to be worshipped, and least of all <HI>how</HI> to
be <HI>appeased</HI> for Offences committed against
him, so as to pardon them, and be reconci∣led
to the Offenders. And as to <HI>the Immor∣tality
of the Soul,</HI> the Certainty of a <HI>future
State,</HI> and the <HI>Rewards and Punishments</HI>
to be distributed in the Life to come, their
Notions were various, doubtful, and con∣fused.
—And agreeably▪ <HI>they</HI> plainly saw
and confessed, that after all their Researches
after such Remedy, they were still surround∣ed
with Darkness; that all their Attempts
for the Recovery of Mankind from <HI>Error</HI>
and <HI>Corruption,</HI> were vain and fruitless,
and that it never could be effected with∣out
a <HI>Divine Instructor,</HI> or some <HI>extraor∣dinary</HI>
Assistance from God.</P>
<P>NOW midst all this Distress of Bondage
and Darkness, how strongly must the <HI>Light</HI>
of the <HI>Gospel</HI> strike on, and affect the most
degenerate Minds! So evident, so plain a
Discovery of the alone certain and <HI>adequate</HI>
Means of their Relief and Deliverance from
<PB N="9" REF="004721_0042_0000000000000000"/>
their Misery, and for advancing them to a
State of glorious Liberty and Happiness!
How strongly, I say, must this Discovery
of <HI>so great a Salvation</HI> strike the most de∣generate
Minds of Men, and how necessari∣ly
must they <HI>approve</HI> of, and <HI>rejoice</HI> in it!
Let the <HI>Sceptick</HI> pretend his <HI>no</HI> Certa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>ty
of a God or an <HI>Hereafter,</HI> and the <HI>Deist</HI>
boast of his <HI>Religion of Nature;</HI> let Men
pretend to amuse themselves or others as
they please; yet not more certain is the
<HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> at Noon-day to the natu∣ral
Eye, than that of the Gospel is to the
rational Mind. And agreeably, either let
the <HI>practical</HI> Precepts of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which
cross on the corrupt Lusts and Passions,
and confirmed Habits thence grown up in
Men, be struck out, and Christianity re∣duced
(as by the <HI>Antinomians</HI> it is) to a
mere <HI>Theory</HI> of Faith or Belief; or let Men
have no such Lusts, Passions, or Habits to
thwart or cross upon; and then let us see,
who would not be <HI>Christians indeed!</HI> Pro∣fitable
Hearers of the Word preached unto
them? For, if not only <HI>bare</HI> Assent, Faith,
or Belief, but even Purposes and Resolu∣tions
of Obedience, were sufficient to <HI>profi∣table</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="004721_0043_0000000000000000"/>
Hearing, who would not <HI>profitably</HI>
hear the <HI>Gospel?</HI> Who would not see, be∣lieve,
and rejoice in it, as <HI>a great Salva∣tion?</HI>
But, alas! so long as the <HI>Gospel</HI>
contains such Precepts as <HI>cross</HI> on the cor∣rupt
Lusts, Passions, and Habits of Men,
and Men retain such Lusts, Passions, and
Habits to <HI>cross upon;</HI> these will prove the
great stumbling Stones, and Rocks of Of∣fence
against the <HI>Gospel;</HI>—will cause, that
<HI>the Word preached</HI> shall <HI>not profit</HI> the Hea∣rers,
but be <HI>barren and unfruitful;</HI>—that
their <HI>Hearts shall wax gross, their Ears
dull in Hearing, and their Eyes dim in See∣ing;</HI>
so as, <HI>Hearing they shall hear, and
not understand, and seeing they shall see,
and not perceive;</HI>—nay finally, will cause,
that they shall <HI>turn away their Eyes</HI> from
seeing, and <HI>like the deaf Adder stop their
Ears, and refuse to hear the Voice of the
Charmer, charming never so wisely.</HI></P>
<P>LET us <HI>take heed</HI> then, my Brethren,
of this <HI>Indisposition</HI> of our Hearts in <HI>Hear∣ing,</HI>
viz. their Incumbrance with corrupt
Lusts and Passions, and Habits derived from
them, which will be sure to defeat <HI>the
<PB N="11" REF="004721_0044_0000000000000000"/>
Word,</HI> and render it <HI>nnfruitful.</HI> Let us
<HI>take heed</HI> of this Indisposition I say, so as
to do all our Skill and Diligence to correct
or amend it. Can the Husbandman expect
to reap from Seed sown in a <HI>stony Field?</HI>
Or is such a Field consistent with good Hus∣bandry
and Cultivation? No more can a
<HI>Gospel Hearer</HI> expect to reap from the <HI>Word</HI>
sown in his Heart cumber'd with Lusts, and
Passions, and Habits of Corruption; nor is
such a Heart consistent with the Husban∣dry,
Care, and Cultivation required of a
<HI>Christian.</HI> As surely as a <HI>stony Field</HI> will
turn out <HI>no</HI> Fruit to Perfection, from any
<HI>Seed</HI> sown in it; so surely such Hearts of
Men will turn out <HI>no</HI> Fruit to Perfection,
from <HI>the Word</HI> sown in them.</P>
<P>III. The <HI>third</HI> and last <HI>bad</HI> Disposition
of Heart, in the Order of the <HI>Parable,</HI> we
are to <HI>take heed</HI> of for <HI>profitable Hearing,</HI>
is that represented by <HI>the Thorns; viz.</HI> the
Heart charged and <HI>cumbered</HI> with the Things,
the <HI>Cares</HI> and <HI>Amusements</HI> of the World.
And a strong and beautiful <HI>Emblem</HI> or Re∣presentation
it is. For in every Circum∣stance
or Respect, as <HI>Thorns</HI> in a Field will
<PB N="12" REF="004721_0045_0000000000000000"/>
defeat the Growth or Increase of any <HI>Grain</HI>
sown in it; so will the <HI>Cares and Amusements</HI>
of the World defeat the Increase of
<HI>the Word,</HI> in the Hearts of Men. As
<HI>Thorns</HI> in a Field, like an oppressive rich
Neighbour, will enhanse the <HI>Moisture</HI> of
the Ground, and deprive the poor tender
<HI>Grain</HI> of its proper Nourishment; or as
growing up with the tender <HI>Blade</HI> or
<HI>Stalk,</HI> they will entangle and oppress it; or
when grown up, the least Ruffle of Wind
beating the <HI>Stalk</HI> or <HI>Ear</HI> against them, they
will tear, wound, and destroy it; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So
answerably, in <HI>every</HI> Circumstance, will
the <HI>Cares</HI> and <HI>Amusements</HI> of the World
choak, oppress, entangle, and defeat the
Increase of <HI>the Word,</HI> in the Hearts of Men.
They will enhanse that <HI>Moisture</HI> of Heart,
that good <HI>Inclination, Thought,</HI> and <HI>Serious∣ness,</HI>
which shou'd nourish it; growing up
with it, they will entangle and oppress it;
and when grown up, will be sure, on the
various emergent Ruffles, either of Pros∣perity
or Adversity, to wound, defeat, and
destroy it.</P>
<P>AND how generally, alas! is this the
<PB N="13" REF="004721_0046_0000000000000000"/>
fatal Case of <HI>Men?</HI> How many are there,
who otherwise would be <HI>profitable Hear∣ers,</HI>
but for the <HI>Cares,</HI> the <HI>Riches,</HI> and
<HI>Pleasures</HI> of the World. entering into their
Hearts, <HI>choak the Word, and render it un∣fruitful?</HI>
Nor is it the absolute Case of
any all at once, but which they advance to
in Time, and by Degrees. For before these
grow up into confirmed <HI>Habits,</HI> and get
full Possession of the Heart, many are often
so far profited in <HI>Hearing the Word,</HI> as not
only to believe, but also to take up full <HI>Re∣solutions</HI>
to obey or practise it. But then
alas! how often also are these <HI>Resolutions</HI>
defeated by the World, and overcome?
Some <HI>Care,</HI> some <HI>Pleasure,</HI> some <HI>Amuse∣ment,</HI>
or other, it always throws in the
Way: <HI>Honours</HI> or <HI>Preferments,</HI> immo∣derate
<HI>Gains</HI> or <HI>Losses, Wives, Children,
Weddings, Births, Funerals;</HI> some or o∣ther
such <HI>Care,</HI> or <HI>Pleasure,</HI> or <HI>Amusement</HI>
it always throws in upon them, which ei∣ther
quite oversets these Resolutions, or at
least suspends the Performance of them to a
longer Day. And this Delay or <HI>Suspension</HI>
once gained, it not only becomes a dange∣rous
<HI>Precedent</HI> for the future, but mean
<PB N="14" REF="004721_0047_0000000000000000"/>
time also affords Opportunity for other fresh
<HI>Cares</HI> and <HI>Temptations</HI> to enter and obtain:
So that they move, as 'twere, in an <HI>inchan∣ted
Circle</HI> of Resolutions and Suspensions,
Promises and Non-performances, Purpo∣ses
to do much, and yet doing Nothing at
all.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Briars</HI> of earth∣ly
Things, Cares, Riches, Pleasures, Busi∣ness
and Concerns in the Hearts of Men,
entangle and oppress the <HI>Word preached,</HI>
beat down every good Motion or aspiring,
prevail over Reason, and either defeat the
<HI>strongest</HI> Purposes and Resolutions, or finally
reduce and limit them to certain <HI>Terms</HI> or
<HI>Conditions.</HI> When these or the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>her <HI>Con∣ditions</HI>
are obtained, (article such Men)—
This or the other <HI>Difficulty</HI> got over;—
This or the other <HI>Point</HI> gained;—When
such or such Matters, Things, Periods,
Circumstances in view, shall be accomplish∣ed;
oh then, they will set about the Duties
of <HI>Religion</HI> in good Earnest; they will then
be no longer <HI>only Hearers of the Word,</HI> but
<HI>Doers of the Work</HI> also, they will throw
off the World, all its <HI>Cares, Pleasures,
<PB N="15" REF="004721_0048_0000000000000000"/>
Pomps,</HI> and <HI>Vanities,</HI> and wholly attend the
laying up for themselves <HI>Treasures</HI> in a
better Place; <HI>where neither Moth nor Rust
doth corrupt, and where Thieves do not
break thro' and steal.</HI> But, alas! before
these can be brought to bear, these Condi∣tions
attained, and Matters adjusted to their
Minds, either the Evening of their Day
draws on, or other and still farther Condi∣tions
appear necessary, so as finally they
turn out <HI>unprofitable Servants.</HI></P>
<P>HOW plainly then is <HI>the World En∣mity
against God?</HI> And agreeably, how
much is the Whole of our blessed <HI>Redee∣mer</HI>'s
both Life and Doctrines pointed a∣gainst
this single Evil, as the main Root or
Scource of Human Misery? His whole
Lite was a continued Scene of his Enmity
to, Hatred, and Contempt of the World;
—<HI>The Son of Man had not</HI> so much of it
as <HI>where to lay his Head.</HI> And scarce ever
opened he his Mouth in Doctrine, but to
teach, and enforce Men's Imitation of his
own Practice and Example. To teach, that
<HI>They cannot serve God and Mammon;</HI>—
that <HI>If any Man love the World, the Love
<PB N="16" REF="004721_0049_0000000000000000"/>
of God is not in him;</HI>—that they should
<HI>take no Thought what they should eat, or
what they should drink, or wherewithal
they should be cloathed;</HI>—be ready to
<HI>forsake Fathers, and Mothers, and Houses,
and Lands,</HI> even to quit all earthly Pos∣sessions
and Enjoyments, to <HI>follow him,
and have Treasure in the Kingdome of
Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>AND agreeably such indeed was the
Behaviour and Conduct of his Disciples and
Followers of the <HI>First</HI> Ages. Their Minds,
their Love and <HI>Affections were set upon
Things above, and not on Things on the
Earth.</HI> Their Spirits breathed too free an
Air, to be caught by any or all the Beau∣ties
and Charms this World can afford; and
their cheif Care was to <HI>keep themselves un∣spotted
from it; using</HI> indeed, but not <HI>abu∣sing</HI>
it, as well knowing, that both <HI>this
World</HI> and <HI>the Fashion of it,</HI> quickly <HI>pas∣seth
away.</HI> In Testimony of this I might
produce you all the <HI>Apologists</HI> and other
Christian Writers of those Times, but <HI>Ius∣tin
Martyr</HI> alone shall suffice. <HI>Christians</HI>
(saith he) <HI>dwell in their own Country but

as</HI> Inmates <HI>and</HI> Foreigners; <HI>they have all
Things common with other Men as</HI> Fellow∣citizens,
<HI>and yet suffer all Things as</HI> Stran∣gers.
<HI>Every</HI> foreign Region <HI>is their Coun∣try,
and every Country is foreign to them.
—They are</HI> in the Flesh, <HI>but do not</HI> live
after the Flesh; <HI>they dwell upon the</HI> Earth,
<HI>but their</HI> Conversation is in Heaven. <HI>As
the Soul lives</HI> in <HI>the Body, but is not</HI> of <HI>the
Body, so Christians dwell</HI> in <HI>the World, but
are not</HI> of <HI>the World. An</HI> immortal Spirit
<HI>dwells in a</HI> mortal Tabernacle, <HI>and Chri∣stians
while they sojourn in these</HI> corruptible
<HI>Mansions expect and look for an</HI> incorrup∣tible
<HI>State in Heaven.</HI>—We now return,</P>
<P>To consider that <HI>bad</HI> Disposition of Heart,
which obstructs <HI>profitable</HI> Hearing, repre∣sented
in the <HI>Parable</HI> by <HI>the Way-side;</HI>
which tho' <HI>first</HI> in the Order of the <HI>Pa∣rable,</HI>
we have chose to treat of in the <HI>last</HI>
Place.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Parable</HI> sets forth <HI>Seed falling by
the Way-side,</HI> which must suppose the <HI>Field</HI>
or Ground sowed in <HI>open</HI> and <HI>unfenced,</HI> so
as to have <HI>Roads</HI> or <HI>Path-ways</HI> made thro'
<PB N="18" REF="004721_0051_0000000000000000"/>
it. Now as that Ground is altogether un∣fit
or <HI>ill</HI> disposed for bringing any <HI>Seed</HI> to
Perfection, which lies <HI>unfenced,</HI> or <HI>open</HI> to
all Comers and Goers to make <HI>Path-ways</HI>
in;—For so the <HI>Seed</HI> will either be trod∣den
down, or lie so uncover'd, that the
<HI>Fowls of the Air will devour it:</HI> Even so,
those <HI>Hearts</HI> of Men are altogether unfit
and <HI>ill</HI> disposed to bring any Fruit of the
<HI>Word</HI> to Perfection, which are not sufficient∣ly
fenced in, with <HI>Zeal according to Know∣ledge;</HI>
but lie open and exposed, to the
Inroads of <HI>Scepticism</HI> on the one Hand, and
<HI>Enthusiasm</HI> on the other:—For so the
Seed of <HI>the Word</HI> will either be <HI>trodden
down</HI> by the <HI>Phlegmatick</HI> Notions of the
former, or devoured by the <HI>wild</HI> and <HI>fran∣tick</HI>
ones of the latter.</P>
<P>1. Without the <HI>Fence</HI> of a <HI>Zeal accor∣ding
to Knowledge,</HI> what Inroads or Path-ways
will <HI>Scepticism</HI> make in our Hearts!
And how, by the phlegmatick <HI>Weight</HI> of
Coldness and Indifference, will its Notions
crush and tread down <HI>the Word</HI> sown there!
And hence, alas! so many occasional or ac∣cidental
<HI>Hearers</HI> in these our Days, whose
Attendance on the <HI>Word preached</HI> once a
<PB N="19" REF="004721_0052_0000000000000000"/>
Month, may be reckoned an extraordinary
Attendance. Something or other is always
the Matter they cannot come; or marrying
of Wives, or Farms, or Merchandize; or
still much lower, the Church begins too
soon or too late, they have not a proper
Seat, or proper Cloaths to appear in; 'tis
either too hot or too cold, too dusty or too
dirty Weather. Some or other of these, or
such like Reasons of Absence, is always at
Hand, while yet the true one is, if they
would speak out, that 'tis a Matter of the
utmost Indifference to them, whether they
come or stay away. Thus <HI>occasionally</HI> or
by Chance it is that they come to hear; but
there is more Certainty than Chance, that
what they thus hear will not <HI>profit</HI> them.
They come as if they came not; that is,
without proper Design, Desire, or Incli∣nation
of Heart to be edified; and what
Marvel if the <HI>Word preached</HI> be unto them
as a <HI>sounding Brass, and tinkling Cymbal?</HI>
What less can God expect and demand of
us towards our <HI>Edification,</HI> than a <HI>willing
Mind,</HI> a hearty and sincere Desire of being
<HI>edified?</HI> Or what less can we bring with
us, if any Thing at all? Surely it is but
<PB N="20" REF="004721_0053_0000000000000000"/>
small and inconsiderable Matter, that is re∣quired
of us in this Behalf; <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>willing
Mind.</HI> Let us contribute but this Mite,
the first essential Requisite for our profitable
Hearing. For as God has been pleased to
create us <HI>free</HI> Creatures, we cannot be edi∣fied
without our own Consent, Will, or In∣clination,
much less against them.</P>
<P>2. Without the <HI>Fence</HI> of <HI>Zeal accor∣ding
to Knowledge,</HI> what <HI>Pathways</HI> also
will <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> make in our Hearts?
And how will its <HI>wild</HI> and <HI>frantick</HI> No∣tions
<HI>devour</HI> up the Seed of <HI>the Word</HI> sown
there?</P>
<P>A <HI>First</HI> and <HI>common</HI> Consequence of the
Want of <HI>this Fence,</HI> and a main Introduc∣tion
to <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> is, <HI>the Itching of the
Ears;</HI> that is, that Men run <HI>to and fro</HI>
to hear, more for the <HI>pleasing the Ear,</HI> or
moving their Passions, than the Instruction
of their Minds. And how numerous such
Hearers are every where, I need not say.
They love the Man (the <HI>Preacher</HI>) and
will go to hear him. Why so? Because
as <HI>Ezekiel</HI> was to the <HI>Iews,</HI> so is he unto
<PB N="21" REF="004721_0054_0000000000000000"/>
them, <HI>as a very lovely Song of one that
hath a pleasant Voice.</HI> The <HI>Iews</HI> came to
hear the <HI>Prophet,</HI> not that they regarded
the Matter he delivered, or intended to
do according to his Words; no, but be∣cause
his <HI>Talent of Utterance</HI> hit their Fan∣cy,
<HI>his Words were to them as a very love∣ly
Song.</HI> They came only for <HI>Sound,</HI> and
<HI>Sound</HI> they had, and <HI>Sound</HI> they carried
with them, and no more. And thus as the
Case was with the <HI>Iews</HI> of old, so it is
with many <HI>Christians</HI> of our Times. Their
<HI>Religion,</HI> alas! derives not from the vital
Principles of <HI>Divine Faith and Love</HI> in the
Heart, springing forth into <HI>Holiness of
Life;</HI> but from the <HI>Phantoms</HI> and <HI>Capri∣ces</HI>
of their Heads, which turn them a hunt∣ing
after the <HI>fine Preacher,</HI> the Man whose
<HI>Tone</HI> and <HI>Air</HI> they are best pleased with,
whose <HI>Voice is unto them as a very lovely
Song;</HI> accounting when their <HI>Ears</HI> and
Fancies are most <HI>pleased,</HI> their <HI>Minds</HI> are
best <HI>instructed.</HI> This is a sore Evil, and
the more so, that there's seldom a Remedy
for it in Human Power. Speak it out, you
offend them. Represent it in its true Light
and Nature, you provoke their Indignation,
<PB N="22" REF="004721_0055_0000000000000000"/>
and their Returns of Hatred and Ill-will.
Men are strongly averse to having their
<HI>Understandings</HI> called in Question, and not
to be thought <HI>wise</HI> enough to judge and de∣termine
for themselves. To accuse of Er∣ror,
is to accuse of Folly and Ignorance;
and therefore rather than submit to the
Accusation, though in the <HI>softest</HI> Terms,
they'll choose to abide by their <HI>former</HI>
Judgment, and to go on in their own
Way.</P>
<P>BUT the agreeable well turned <HI>Voice,</HI>
is not always the alone Object of <HI>itching
Ears;</HI> but generally they extend, as did those
of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> to <HI>new Things,</HI> new or un∣common
Notions or Doctrines, new Lights,
or Revelations;—are <HI>turned away from
the Truth, and turned into Fables.</HI> Now
in such Case, while Men are thus without
<HI>Zeal according to Knowledge,</HI> their Ears
<HI>itching</HI> after the <HI>fine Preacher,</HI> who can
please the Ear, rouse the Passions, and a∣muse
the Understanding with <HI>mysterious</HI>
Doctrines, <HI>new</HI> Lights, and Revelations;
is it not ten thousand to one, but the
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ankest Enthusiast,</HI> with any tolerable <HI>Air</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="004721_0056_0000000000000000"/>
and <HI>Utterance,</HI> shall be the Man? Such
<HI>Hearers</HI> indeed will not be long without
<HI>Zeal;</HI> but alas! a <HI>Zeal</HI> not <HI>according to
Knowledge,</HI> is worse than none at all; a
furious rampant Thing! and which can
serve only to rivet fast the <HI>Chains</HI> of Error
and Delusion: <HI>They want</HI> the Charming of
the Ear;—The <HI>Enthusiast</HI> either has the
<HI>natural</HI> Talents that will wholly answer, or
his <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Impetuosity</HI> will make good the
Defect: <HI>They want</HI> to hear Things that
will <HI>rouse</HI> their Passions, as Children do Sto∣ries
of <HI>Ghosts</HI> and <HI>Hobgoblines,</HI> which yet
make them tremble and afraid to go in
the Dark;—<HI>He</HI> is provided of these suffi∣ciently
to <HI>scare</HI> and <HI>frighten them out of
their Wits,</HI> if that will please: <HI>They want</HI>
to hear <HI>new Things,</HI> strange or <HI>mysterious</HI>
Doctrines, <HI>new Lights</HI> or <HI>Revelations,</HI> tho'
only to <HI>amuse</HI> their Heads, and <HI>perplex</HI> their
Understandings;—No one has greater
Store; <HI>He</HI> is always <HI>speaking Mysteries in
the Spirit,</HI> always full of <HI>Impulses, new
Lights,</HI> and <HI>Revelations.</HI>—And thus
must the <HI>Enthusiast</HI> be the <HI>Man of God</HI> in∣deed!
So throughly furnished to supply
<PB N="24" REF="004721_0057_0000000000000000"/>
all the <HI>Wants,</HI> or <HI>Itchings</HI> of such Hear∣ers.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY, or rather <HI>commonly</HI> indeed,
<HI>such Hearers</HI> are, at <HI>first,</HI> a little stumbled
at his high and confident Pretensions to the
<HI>Spirit,</HI> his <HI>Impulses</HI> and <HI>Inspirations;</HI> but
how short a Time, under the Influence of
the <HI>powerful Man,</HI> will suffice, to remove
all such Prejudice, and fully convince them
of the Reality of these Pretensions, and that
of a Truth he has the <HI>Indwelling of the
Spirit</HI> in him? Nor only so, but this Point
got over, and the Doctrine of the <HI>Indwel∣ling
of the Spirit the Priviledge of all
Christians,</HI> a little more fully opened and
insisted on, they will soon be persuaded in∣to
a <HI>Feeling</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> of the same
<HI>Motions, Impulses,</HI> and <HI>Inspirations</HI> in
themselves.—And now the Work thus
far advanced; the Wheels of a heated Ima∣gination
set thus a going, God only knows
where they will stop, whether in <HI>Bedlam,</HI>
or <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>no Christianity,</HI> or <HI>no Religion
at all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="004721_0058_0000000000000000"/>
<HI>TAKE heed</HI> then (my Brethren) of this
<HI>Way-side</HI> Indisposition of Heart in <HI>Hearing.</HI>
Give all Care and Diligence to <HI>fence in</HI> and
secure your Hearte with proper and becom∣ing
<HI>Zeal according to Knowledge;</HI> for if
lying open and exposed, <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> shall
enter in, how will its wild and frantick
Notions <HI>devour up</HI> the Seed of the Word!
How little will you <HI>endure sound Doc∣trine,</HI>
but be <HI>turned unto Fables,</HI> and
<HI>heap to yourselves Teachers, having itching
Ears!</HI></P>
<P>TAKE good heed, and guard strictly a∣gainst
the first Beginnings of this <HI>fatal</HI> Ma∣lady,
as of no small Danger whereunto they
may grow. For if once Men's <HI>Heads</HI> are
set a Wandering, or (as we have said) the
Wheels of their heated Imaginations agoing,
who shall prescribe or set the Bounds? No
<HI>Reveries</HI> so monstrous or absurd, which
shall not be deemed <HI>Divine</HI> Impulses or In∣spirations!
No <HI>Practices</HI> so wicked or
immoral, which shall not be justified as
<HI>Fruits</HI> or Effects of these! If the <HI>wicked</HI>

<HI>Murder, Adultery,</HI> or <HI>Incest, &amp;c.</HI> it is
<PB N="26" REF="004721_0059_0000000000000000"/>
the <HI>Impulse of the Spirit,</HI> the Command of
God, and it shall be committed.</P>
<P>THIS is no <HI>Speculation,</HI> but what the
World has sufficiently <HI>experienced</HI> in Fact,
in many and <HI>notorious</HI> Instances.—What
was all the <HI>Heathen</HI> Religion of <HI>Sybils</HI> and
<HI>Oracles,</HI> but rank <HI>Enthusiasm?</HI>—What
was it but judicial <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> that destroy∣ed
<HI>Ierusalem</HI> and the <HI>Iewish</HI> Nation? While
<HI>Titus,</HI> in his ever memorable Siege of that glo∣rious
City slew his thousands <HI>without,</HI> did not
<HI>Enthusiasm</HI> give its <HI>ten</HI> thousands to the Sword
and to the Famine <HI>within;</HI> and at last the <HI>City,
Temple,</HI> and <HI>Nation</HI> a Prey to the <HI>Roman</HI> Arms?
—And again, did it not deliver up that unhap∣py
People to the <HI>Carnage</HI> and their final Dis∣persion,
under <HI>Adrian?</HI> Was not <HI>Mahometism</HI>
sounded in <HI>Enthusiasm?</HI> And does not

is owing to their being <HI>ravished in Spirit,</HI>
and taken from themselves, as 'twere to the

<P>1. That the Sabbath was abolished as unnecessary, Jew∣ish, and merely ceremonial; and here, says he, I shou'd have put out my first Light, but the Wind is so high I cannot light it</P>

<P>3. Ministers are abolish'd as Anti-Christian, and of no longer Use now Christ himself descends into the Hearts of his Saints, and his Spirit enlightens them with Revelations and Inspirations.</P>

<P>BUT still nigher (my Brethren) and a∣mong
Ourselves; you'll remember the fa∣tal
<HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Case of the <HI>Dutartres,</HI>
which was attended with the Murder of
<HI>Two</HI> Persons, the Killing of <HI>One,</HI> and the
Execution of <HI>Four</HI> for those Murders.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutartres,</HI> you know, were a
Family of <HI>French</HI> Extract, (consisting of
the two Parents, and eight Children, four
Sons and four Daughters) settled in <HI>Orange
Quarter</HI> in this Province. They were al∣ways
in low Circumstances of Life; but of
honest Repute, and for many Years beha∣ved
themselves regularly and blameless, in
all outward Instances of religious and mo∣ral
Duty. But some few Years before the
<HI>fatal Period,</HI> came hither a certain strolling
<HI>Moravian, Dutch,</HI> or <HI>Swiss</HI> Enthusiast
<PB N="31" REF="004721_0064_0000000000000000" MS="y"/>
(<HI>Pietist</HI> as I could learn) named <HI>Christian
George,</HI> or some such Name; who partly
by Conversation, and partly by the Wri∣tings
of <HI>Iacob Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>men,</HI> and other Authors
of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>me Stamp he put into their Hands,
soon filled their <HI>Heads</HI> with many wild and
fantastick Notions. These so grew and
multiplied upon them, that in a Year or
Two's Time, they began to withdraw from
publick Worship, and all outward Ordi∣nances
of God in his Church, and from all
Conversation with the World; and strong∣ly
to conceit, that they were the <HI>alone</HI> Fa∣mily
upon Earth, who had the <HI>true Know∣ledge</HI>
and <HI>Worship</HI> of God amongst them;
and whom he vouchsafed to instruct and di∣rect▪
either by the <HI>immediate Impulses</HI> of
his <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> or by <HI>Signs</HI> or <HI>Tokens</HI> which
he gave them. Finally it came to <HI>open Vi∣sions</HI>
and <HI>Revelations.</HI> God <HI>raised up a
Prophet unto them from among themselves
(PETER ROMBERT,</HI> who had married
the eldest Daughter of the Family, a Widow)
<HI>like unto</HI> Moses, and <HI>to whom they should
hearken.</HI> And to this <HI>Prophet</HI> God was
pleas'd openly and plainly to reveal, that
<HI>the Wickedness of Men was now again be∣come
as great upon Earth as in the Days
<PB N="32" REF="004721_0065_0000000000000000"/>
of</HI> Noah▪ <HI>and that he therefore purposed
to destroy Mankind a</HI> second <HI>Time from off
the Face of the</HI> Earth, <HI>as he did in those
Days▪ all but that one Family whom he
would pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>erve as he did Noah's, for rai∣sing
up a godly Seed again upon it.</HI> This
Revelation he was sure of, he knew it, he
felt it, as certainly as the Wind blowing on
his Body; and they with as full Assurance
believed and depended upon it.</P>
<P>SOON after this, God was pleased to
reveal himself again to the <HI>Prophet</HI> a second
Time, saying; <HI>Put away the Woman
whom thou now hast for thy Wife; for
when I have destroyed this wicked Genera∣tion
from off the Earth, then will I raise
up her first Husband from the Dead, and
they shall be Man and Wife as before; and
go thou and take to Wife her youngest Sister,
who is a</HI> Virgin; <HI>so shall that chosen Fa∣mily
be restored entire, and the holy Seed
be preserved pure and undefiled in it.</HI> The
<HI>old Man</HI> (the Father) was staggered at so
strange a Message; but the <HI>Prophet</HI> assu∣red
him that God would give him a <HI>Sign;</HI>
which accordingly came to pass, and imme∣diately
on which the <HI>old Man</HI> took his
<HI>youngest</HI> Daughter by the Hand, and gave
<PB N="33" REF="004721_0066_0000000000000000"/>
her to him (the Prophet) to Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>; and he
went in unto her, and lay with her, with∣out
any farther Ceremony, pursuant to the
Divine Command. And thus they conti∣nued
in open and notorious <HI>Adultery</HI> and
<HI>Incest</HI> 'till the fatal Period, we now come to
mention.</P>
<P>SO far possessed were these poor Wret∣ches
with a Conceit of their own Holiness,
and of the Impurity and Wickedness of o∣thers,
that they would give no Obedience
to the <HI>civil Magistrate,</HI> nor any the <HI>Laws</HI>
or <HI>Ordinances</HI> of Man; and accordingly re∣fus'd
to comply either with the <HI>Militia Law</HI>
(on Pretence that God commanded them to
bear no Arms) or the <HI>Law</HI> for repairing the
High-ways. After long Forbearance Justice
<HI>Symmons</HI> (a worthy <HI>Magistrate</HI> and <HI>Capt.</HI> of
the <HI>Militia</HI> in those Parts) saw it necessary to
issue his Warrants, for levying the <HI>Penalties</HI>
of those Laws upon them. Moreover by this
time, <HI>Iudith Dutartre</HI> the Prophet's <HI>Revela∣tion
Wife</HI> proving with Child, a <HI>third</HI> War∣rant
was issued for bringing her before the
<HI>Iustice,</HI> to be examin'd and bound over to
the <HI>General Sessions</HI> for <HI>Basta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>dy,</HI> pursuant
to a Law of this Province. The <HI>Constable</HI>
having received these Warrants, got two or
three of his Neighbours to go with him-doubting
<PB N="34" REF="004721_0067_0000000000000000"/>
what Usage he might meet with in
the Execution, from so odd a <HI>Family▪</HI> The
Family acquainted of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ir Coming and their
Errand, consulted their <HI>Prophet,</HI> who soon
told them, that God commanded them, to
arm and defend <HI>themselves</HI> and their <HI>Sub∣stance</HI>
from the <HI>Persecution</HI> and <HI>Robberies</HI> of
the Men of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and that no <HI>Weapon
formed against them should prosper.</HI> On
which they forthwith arm themselves, fire
upon the <HI>Constable</HI> and those Persons with
him, and drive them out of their Ground.—This
was not to be suffered; and therefore
the <HI>Iustice</HI> taking with him ten or a Dozen
Men of the <HI>Militia,</HI> went straight to protect
the <HI>Constable</HI> in the Execution of his Office.
On their Approach this wretched <HI>Family</HI>
shut themselves up in their House, and thence
fired like so many Furies, shot the unfortu∣nate
<HI>Iustice</HI> dead on the Spot, and wounded
several of his Men. At length the House
was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>orced open, Mrs. <HI>Lesad</HI> killed, and the
Rest (six in Number) taken Prisoners, and
brought hither to <HI>Charles-Town;</HI> where at
a special Court of <HI>General Sessions</HI> held on
the 29th and 30th of September, Anno
D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>m. 1724, five of them (<HI>viz. Michael
Boineau, Peter Dutartre, Daniel Dutar∣tre,
Iohn Dutartre,</HI> and <HI>Peter Rombert</HI>)
<PB N="35" REF="004721_0068_0000000000000000"/>
were arraigned and tried for <HI>Murder,</HI> found
guilty, and condemned.</P>
<P>ALAS, poor miserable Creatures! How
amazing a Delusion prevailed over them!
They had the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God (especially the
Prophet) <HI>leading them into all Truth.</HI>
They were <HI>sure</HI> of it, they <HI>knew</HI> it, they
<HI>felt</HI> it. This <HI>Spirit</HI> commanded them <HI>not</HI> to
bear A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ms in Obedience to the Laws, or
for the Defence of their Country; but this
<HI>same Spirit</HI> commanded them to bear Arms
in <HI>Rebellion</HI> against the Laws of their Coun∣try,
and to commit <HI>Murder.</HI>—The <HI>holy
Spirit</HI> of God commanded them to commit
<HI>Adultery, Incest, Rebellion,</HI> and <HI>Murder.</HI></P>
<P>BUT were ever these miserable Wretches
convinced of their Delusion? No, my Bre∣thren,
not as to the <HI>three</HI> chief or principal of
them (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Prophet,</HI> the <HI>Father</HI> of the Fa∣mily,
and <HI>Michael Boinean</HI>) not to their last
Breath!—They appeared on their <HI>Trials</HI> al∣together
easy and unconcerned! They had
<HI>God on their Side, and therefore feared not wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>t
Man could do unto them!</HI> They freely told
the <HI>incestuous</HI> Story, in all its Circumstances,
as above mentioned, in <HI>open Court,</HI> and with a
good Countenance; very readily owned the
Facts and Circumstances of the <HI>Rebelia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/></HI> and
<HI>Murder</HI> charged upon them; pleaded <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••••"/>ica∣tion</HI>
in all as <HI>authorized of God,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="36" REF="004721_0069_0000000000000000"/>
that they had done <HI>nothing</HI> in one or other of
the Cases, but by his <HI>express Order</HI> and <HI>Command.</HI></P>
<P>AS the visiting of Persons <HI>under Sentence of
Death</HI> is a part of my Duty as Minister of this
Place, so I attended these unhappy Creatures
with more than ordinary Pains and Diligence.
They very readily owned, repeated, and con∣firmed
all the <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Circumstances,</HI> as before
mentioned, with no material <HI>Variation</HI> from
what they had done in <HI>Court.</HI> But when I came
<HI>to reason</HI> with them on those <HI>Facts,</HI> and endea∣vour
to convince them of the <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Wic∣kedness</HI>
they were guilty of in committing them;—they
treated me with great Disdain!—Their
Motto was <HI>answer him not a Word!</HI>—They
had the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God speaking inwardly to
their Souls, who was I to pretend to talk to,
or instruct them!—They had obeyed the Voice
of God, and were about to suffer Martyrdom
for it; but God had assured them, that he wou'd
either work a great Deliverance for them, or
raise them up from the Dead the <HI>third</HI> Day.
And thus the three before-mentioned (who
were executed) continued to insist and aver to
their dying Breath▪ Their last Words to the
Spectators were, that they should surely see
them alive again from the Dead, the <HI>third</HI> Day.</P>
<P>AS to the other three;—The Daughter Iudith
was not tried. The two Sons <HI>Daniel,</HI> and
<HI>Iohn Dutartre.</HI> (Lads about 18 or 20 Years
<HI>of</HI> Age) who were tried and condemned, con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••••"/>ed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and
reserved, 'till after finding no
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" RESP="tech" DISP="〈…〉"/> the others from the Dead, as
<PB N="37" REF="004721_0070_0000000000000000"/>
they expected, they became sensible of their
Delusion, at least professed themselves so, and
were pardon'd. But alas! One of them relap∣sed
into the same Share; and murdered an in∣nocent
Person, without any previous Quarrel
or Provocation, and for no other Reason, as
he acknowledged, but that <HI>God commanded him
to do it.</HI> He was tried for this Murder, found
guilty, condemn'd, and executed. I attended
him again under this second Sentence of Death,
and it pleased God with all apparent Success.
No one ever appeared more sensible of his De∣lusion,
or to die a more hearty and sincere
Penitent or, in greater professed Hopes
of Salvation, thro' the all-sufficient Merits of
<HI>Christ</HI> his Redeemer.</P>
<P>AND thus ended this <HI>tragical</HI> Scene of <HI>En∣thusiasm;</HI>
in which no less than seven Persons lost their
Live; one killed, two murdered, and four executed for
those Murders. A remarkable Instance, to what Heights
of Extravagance, Folly, and Wickedcess, this Turn of
Head or Imagination, will hurry the poor Sons of Men!</P>
<P>LET us <HI>take heed therefore</HI> (my Brethren) <HI>how we hear.</HI>
As the <HI>Prophet</HI> singeth of his beloved touching his Vineyard,
that <HI>he fenced it, and gathered out the Stones thereof,</HI> &amp;c Let
us imitate the same Husbandry and Cultivation of our <HI>Hearts,</HI>
for profitable Hearing. Let us do all our Diligence to <HI>fence</HI>
them in, with <HI>Zeal according to Knowledge;</HI>—to <HI>gather out
the Stones,</HI> the corrupt Lusts, Passions, and Habits;—and
to root up the <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Briars,</HI> the Cares of the World,
that may prevail in them.</P>
<P>OUR Time is short, uncertain, and posting along; and
the longer we delay, the harder and more difficult will
the Work be. Let us up then betimes and be doing all
we can, nor let us fear the Want of such Divine Aids and
Graces, as shall be <HI>sufficient for us,</HI> and make us <HI>more than Conquerors.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="004721_0071_0000000000000000" MS="y"/>
IN vain indeed, at any Time, shall we strive
or struggle in this Work, without the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> coming
upon us, and the <HI>Power of the Highest</HI> aiding and assisting u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>,
as our main Strength, the chief and principal Cau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>e: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ut then

surely be performed. But be we sure also, that we rely not
on this Power for doing the whole Work, without any

should be done without any concurring Endeavours of our
own: We must not lye loitering in the D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>ch, and wait
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>till Omnipotence pulls us from therce: No, no, we must
be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" RESP="tech" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/> ourselves, and actuate these Powers which we have
already received: We must put forth ourselves, to our
utmost Capacities, and then we may hope that <HI>our Labour
shal not be in vain in the Lord.</HI> All the Art and Industry
of Man cannot form the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Herb, or make a Staik
of Corn grow in the Field; it is the Energy of Nature,
and the Influences of Heaven which produce this Effect;
it is God <HI>who causeth the Grass to grow, and Herb for the
Service of Man;</HI> and yet no Body will say that the Labours
of the Husbandman are useless or unnecessary. Tho' there
in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>ervene a Stroak of Omnipotence to effect this mighty
Change in our Souls, yet ought we to do what we can to
fit and prepare ourselves; for we must break up our fal∣low
Ground and root out the Weed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" RESP="tech" DISP="•"/>, and pull up the
Thorns, that so we may be more ready to receive the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" RESP="tech" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Grace and the Dew of Heaven It is true, God
hath been found of some who sought him not; he hath
cast himself in their Way who were quire out of his; he
hath laid hold upon them, and stop their Course on a
sudden; for so was <HI>St. Paul</HI> converted in his Journey to

of dealing with Men, though he hath not tied him∣self
to Means, yet he hath tied us to the Use of them;
and we have never more reason to expect divine Assistance,
than when we are doing our utmost Endeavours.</Q></P>
