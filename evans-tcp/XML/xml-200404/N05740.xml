<HEAD>A Message from His Excellency <HI>ARTHUR DOBBS,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Captain-General, and Go∣vernor in Chief, in and over his Majesty's Province of <HI>North-Carolina</HI>;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the GENERAL ASSEMBLY, held at <HI>Newb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn,</HI> the Twelfth Day of <HI>December,</HI> 1754.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of his Majesty's Council, Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Assembly,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING in my Speech to you at your Meeting, told you that I should, in a more ample Manner, lay before you the Grand Plan of <HI>France,</HI> to ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and distress all the British Colonies on this Continent; I take the ear∣liest Opportunity of laying their wicked and enslaving Scheme before you, that you may see the Necessity there is of granting a reasonable and immediate Supply, and entering into a Plan of Union with all the British Colonies, for our mutual future Defence:</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> ever active and ambitious, under the insatiable and rapacious House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> whose Ministers having destroyed the Gallic Liberties by the establishing an arbitrary Power in the King alone, have, for near Two Centuries, laid a Plan for en∣slaving <HI>Europe,</HI> by ruining the Liberties of the <HI>Germanick</HI> Body, and Protestant Interest of <HI>Europe</HI>: Their first Attempt was to ruin the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> by playing the <HI>Ger∣manick</HI> Body against their Head, and raising themselves upon its Ruin; and made Use of the <HI>Germanick</HI> Protestant Powers for that Purpose, when, at the same Time, they were ruining the Protestents in <HI>France,</HI> and depriving the <HI>French</HI> of their Liberties; whilst they were extending their Limits, at the Expence of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Branch of the House of <HI>Austria</HI>; and by that Means had forced the House of <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n,</HI> for the Sake of Peace, to intermarry with the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> upon their Solemn Renun∣ciation of their Right of Succession to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy: That fatal Match has been the Cause of the late expensive Wars, and has endangered the Loss of the Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI>; for by the Gallic Intrigues, they have est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>blished a younger Branch of the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> to govern the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy; which by its Pretention to, and Possession of, above half of <HI>America,</HI> which they claim as their Right only by a Pa∣pal Donation, have acquired a Dominion more extensive and rich than any Empire ever known on the Globe: Thus <HI>France,</HI> from a Powerful Enemy, have made the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mo∣narchy a confirmed and potent Ally, with some Hopes, I fear too well grounded, of its being sooner or later united to the Gallic Monarchy.</P>
<P>But the <HI>French,</HI> after Two long and bloody Wars, having been obstructed in their Plan of aggrandizing themselves in <HI>Europe,</HI> by sailing in their Attempt of ruining the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> by the Prudence, Magnanimity, and steady Conduct of our most gracious King, the Father of his People, who, supported by the Courage, Wealth, and Naval Power of the <HI>British</HI> Empire, by powerfully supporting and assis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his Allies, hath defeated the Gallic future Schemes in <HI>Europe</HI>: The <HI>French,</HI> mad at their Disappoint∣ment, finding that the <HI>British</HI> Liberties and Protestant Interest are secure under his Ma∣jesty's Government, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmed by the Protestant Succession in his illustrious House; and that <HI>Britain</HI> can't be conquered or reduced but by ruining its Commerce, and with it our Naval Power, have changed their System, and have laid a Plan to ruin the <HI>British</HI> Commerce, by confining, invading, and conquering all our <HI>American</HI> Colonies; by first attempti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the Colonies on the Continent; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or by securing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Fisheries, and Naval Stores of <HI>America,</HI> they would in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rease their Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and ruin the Commerce, and with it the Naval Power of <HI>Britain</HI>; and then they wou'd divide <HI>America</HI> with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the whole wou'd center in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urbon</HI>; for then, by the Assistance of <HI>France, Portugal</HI> must fall an easy Prey to the Power of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wou'd

stipulate to have the <HI>Brazil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Africa,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> yielded to them as the elder Branch of the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI>▪ and then the Wealth and Power of <HI>Britain</HI> being reduced, all the Powers-of <HI>Europe,</HI> tho' united, could not withstand the united Power and Wealth of the House of <HI>Bourbon</HI>; it being demonstrable, that those who have the Wealth, Power, and Commerce of <HI>America, Africa,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> must be Masters of the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Gallic Branch of the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> distinguished of late for their worse than punic Faith, have, for at least a Century, never ended one War, but with a View to extend their Power and Dominions in Time of Peace, by Force or Intrigues, and to prepare for another War; and think it no Crime to invade or incroach upon their Neigh∣bours, who obstruct their Schemes, in profound Peace, thinking themselves not bound by the most solemn Treaties, if they prevent their aggrandizing their Empire.</P>
<P>This has been very notorious formerly in <HI>Europe,</HI> but their Schemes proving abortive there, they have of late prosecuted their Plan in <HI>America:</HI> Have they not, contrary to the most solemn Treaties, deprived us of the greatest and best Part of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> to the Westward of the Bay of <HI>Fundi?</HI> Erected Forts at <HI>Chine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o,</HI> to confine us within the <HI>Peninsula?</HI> and made another, and are forming a Settlement on the River of St. <HI>Iohn</HI>'s, to ruin the Trade of <HI>New-England,</HI> and the <HI>Northern</HI> Colonies, by their Privateers in the next War, when we shall be couped up by their Shipping there, and at <HI>Louisburg?</HI> Have not they by their hellish Missionaries, spirited up all their <HI>Indian</HI> Allies to massacre and make Depredations, not only in <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> but against all our <HI>Northern</HI> Colonies? Have they not erected a Fort at <HI>Crown-point,</HI> to distress and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine our Colonies of <HI>New-England,</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> on Lands which are the undoubted Right of his Majesty? Have they not erected a Fort at <HI>Niagara,</HI> upon the Lands of the Six Nations, our acknow∣leged and declared Allies by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht?</HI> Have they not laid a Claim to, and er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cten Forts upon his Majesty's Lands on the back of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and pretend a Right to all the Lands beyond the Mountains, as far as the <HI>Mississippi?</HI> Have they not, contrary to the Right of Treaties, deprived us of the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade, and seized our Traders and all their Goods, in Time of pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound Peace? Have not they privately sent over and-in∣creased their Forces, from Time to Time, both in <HI>Louisiana,</HI> and <HI>Canada?</HI> And have not they sent Forces from <HI>Louisiana,</HI> to erect a Fort on the Entrance of the <HI>Ouabach,</HI> or River of St. <HI>Ierome,</HI> into the <HI>Ohio?</HI> Are not these en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmous Invasions and Incroachments in Time of Peace? Are not they gaining all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, intercepting and depriv∣ing us of our <HI>Indian</HI> Allies, and daily instigating their Allies to scalp, massacre, and destroy our Settlers: These are all Facts too notorious and recent to be denied; and must naturally discover to us the whole Plan and Scheme laid by the <HI>French</HI> to confine, con∣quer, and enslave all our Colonies.</P>
<P>A Scheme grand in its Extent, romantic in Appearance, and even beyond the Power of <HI>France</HI> to execute, altho' the Crown has an absolute Power over all the Private Pur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of his Subjects, when he has a Call for them; provided the Colonies exert their na∣tive Force immediately, and repel them to their inhospitable cold Colony of <HI>Canada,</HI> and confine them to the hot Sands of <HI>Louisiana.</HI> The Plan that they have laid, is no less than immediately to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine our Colonies betwixt the Mountains and the Eastern Ocean, by erecting Forts from <HI>Canada</HI> to <HI>Louisiana,</HI> upon the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and Principal Rivers betwixt the Two Colonies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixing strong Garrisons in them, and so forming a Chai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>000 Miles to prevent our corresponding or trading with our <HI>Indian</HI> Allies. When that is done; and they have, by Menaces, or by their hellish Jesuitical Missionaries, made Proselytes of them, not to the true Christian Religion▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded on Peace, Benignity, and Brotherly Love, but to the Pomps and outward Trappings of the Popish Hierarchy and Superstition; and have inspired an enthusiastick. Fury into them against Protestants, whom they call Hereticks, making it meritorous in them to massacre and destroy them, upon which they assure them their future Happiness depends; then they propose pro∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eding further, and to seize and secure all the Passes on the Mountains▪ and head the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against all our Colonies, and force us to become tributary, or to submit to the arbit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary Government of <HI>France,</HI> and become th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Slaves, or be massacred by them and
<PB N="3" REF="007284_0003_0F68C30D52255708"/>
their <HI>Indians,</HI> or be forced out of our Religion, Liberties, and Properties; a fatal Di∣lemma, should they execute their Scheme!</P>
<P>This Scheme, hatched in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell, and suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> so iniquitous and unlikely to be brought to Perfection, could never be adopted by the Court of <HI>France,</HI> if they were not pre-possessed that the <HI>British</HI> Colonies were unwilling, or incapable of uniting and exerting their Force; imagining, (for which they have some G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds,) that the several Colonies are like a Rope of Sand, each guided by selfish partial Views; and that each Planter is more wedded to his own private Gain, than to defend the Rights of his Community, or of the Neighbouring Colonies, and will not part with a Share of his Wealth, to secure the Remainder; imagining, that he will be the last that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall suffer, or vainly expecting, that <HI>Britain</HI> can and will be at the whole Expence, and let them in∣dolently look on; so that before they can be brought to act, the <HI>French</HI> will have formed the Chain, and gain their Ends: They also consider the military Genius of the <HI>French</HI> Gentry, who are al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> educated with a View to Pomp and Power, and their whole Thoughts are turn'd to support the Glory of the Grand Monarque, and therefore are never easy in Time of Peace, but always forming Projects for aggrandizing <HI>France</HI> by the next War; so that this villainous Opinion they have of the <HI>British</HI> Planters in the Colonies, and the enthusiastic Spirit of their military Gentry, induce the <HI>French</HI> Ministry to undertake Schemes beyond their Power to execute.</P>
<P>If then we give the <HI>French</HI> Time to execute the Scheme they have begun, the Liber∣ties, Properties, and Protestant Religion in these Colonies, will be unavoidably lost.</P>
<P>How miserable must be the Condition then of all our Colonies, when con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined within the Mountains, deprived of all the Inland Trade the Continent, and the <HI>Indians,</HI> from being our faithful Allies, obliged to become our inveterate Enemies; drove by them from the Mountains toward the Sea Coast, our Sea Coast attacked by flying <HI>French</HI> Squadr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, and Privateers: In this Situation we must submit to be Slaves to <HI>France,</HI> become their hewers of Wood, and drawers of Water, suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting them with most enormous Taxes.</P>
<P>God Almighty, who by his Providence under the Conduct of our <HI>Messiah,</HI> hath, in many remarkable Instances, defeated all <HI>Popish</HI> Schemes, when the Protestant Interest and Liberties of <HI>Britain</HI> seem'd to be at the Brink of Ruin: Our <HI>Messiah,</HI> who is ever a beneficent Guardian to his true Protestant Church, founded on Justice, Humanity, and social Love, hath now put it into our Power to make their whole Scheme abortive; if we exert our whole Native Force without loss of Time, by in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atuating their Councils, and permitting them to discover and enter upon the Execution of their Plan, before they are prepared and strengthened by a suf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icient Force from <HI>France</HI>; it being evident at present, that we out-number the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Colonies upon this Continent by above Forty to One, and are yet strengthened with many brave <HI>Indian</HI> Allies; so that we vastly exceed both in Wealth and Number all the <HI>French</HI> upon the Continent, or those they can support, if sent from <HI>France,</HI> in their present inhospitable Colonies.</P>
<P><HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed and nursed up these Colonies from their In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancy to a State of Manhood, and hath greatly increased their Numbers and Wealth, by protecting them hitherto, and sending or pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mitting many <HI>British</HI> Families to come and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle in their Colonies; and who, by their mild free Government, have encouraged many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oreign Protestants to come over and settle and increase their Numbers; and though they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Debts and enormous, tho' necessary, Taxes; hath not only protected these Colonies, but indulged them in paying a small Quit-Rent, and the easiest Taxes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pent in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir own Support,) of any civilized Nation on the Globe.

<P>In this critical Situation, let us, his Majesty's faithful Subjects of the Colony of <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> shew that we are true Sons of <HI>Britain,</HI> whose Ancestors have been ever famous for de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending their valuable Religion, and Liberties; and that we are still inspired with the same Spirit of Liberty, and are determined to support our Religious and Civil Rights, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them down to our Posterity: Let us shew, that tho' we are one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Colonies, and scarcely arrived at the State of Manhood that our neigh∣bouring C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s have attained to, either in Wealth or Number, yet that we are still ready to exert our Power, and grant an immediate Supply to assist in the General Defence of the Colonie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and that as we have already shewn a good Example, so we shall con∣tinue to be a la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dable Precedent to the rest of the more opulent Colonies; and instead of ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring into Private Party Quarrels, as some have done, or postponing or putting off proper Supplies, as some others have done, by an ill-judged Oeconomy, or out of a penurious selfish Consideration, as some Proprietary and Charter Colonies have done, vainly imagining that the Danger is at a Distance, and that they will leave the Brunt of it to others; and that <HI>Britain,</HI> loaded with Debts and Taxes, will defend them, and in∣dulge them in living without Taxes, or assisting in the General Defence of the Colonies. Let us then chearfully give what is reasonable and proper for us, by an immediate Sup∣ply, as well knowing that a moderate Sum now granted, will go farther in securing our Rights and Properties, than Ten Times as much if longer delayed: Let us then inspire the other Colonies with an equal Fire to maintain their Religion and Liberties, and to preserve the Friendship, and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end the Rights of our <HI>Indian</HI> Allies. This, as grateful Men, we owe to them, for the Happiness we enjoy in possessing these fine Climates and rich Land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>America,</HI> which was once theirs, either by Possession or Conquest; this we owe to them, as free Men and true Christians, to promote their Happiness, and make them Parta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of our happy Constitution, and extending it th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o' the Continent, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣deavouring to civilize and incorp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate with them, and to lay a Foundation for their be∣coming Christians; and this true Christian Zeal will heap Blessings upon all our Colonies and our Posterity.</P>
<P>Let us then behave like generous brave Men and true Christians; for a little while con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine our Appetites and Luxuries, and part with a reasonable Part of our Wealth to preserve the Remainder, and our happy Constitution in Church and State, to our latest Posterity; this will shew the Gallic Monarch, and his insatiable Ministry, that we are not to be intimidated or to be bullied out of our Rights, and that if he should insist upon his romantic Scheme of surrounding, confining, and enslaving us, that we will jointly and unanimously support our valuable Religion, Liberties, and Properties, with our Lives and Fortunes; and that whilst we b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>have like brave Men, and true Christians, we are sure of the Protection of God our <HI>Messiah,</HI> and that we shall not only be happy i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his World, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to endless Ages.</P>
