<HEAD>THE ASSOCIATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WE, his Majesty's most loyal subjects, the Delegates of the several Colonies of New-Hampshire, Massachusett's Bay, Rhode∣Island, Connecticut, New-York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the Three Lower Counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex, on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, and South-Carolina, deputed to represent them in a conti∣nental Congress, held in the city of Philadel∣phia, on the fifth day of September, 1774, avowing our allegiance to his Majesty, our af∣fection and regard for our fellow-subjects in Great-Britain and elsewhere, affected with the deepest anxiety, and most alarming apprehen∣sions at those grievances and distresses, with which his Majesty's American subjects are op∣pressed, and having taken under our most seri∣ous deliberation, the state of the whole couti∣nent, find, that the present unhappy situation of our affairs, is occasioned by a ruinous system of colony administration adopted by the British Mi∣nistry
<PB N="2" REF="013704_0002_0F91A0F3300EB430"/>
about the year 1763, evidently calculated for inslaving these Colonies, and, with them, the British Empire. In prosecution of which system, various Acts of Parliament have been passed for raising a Revenue in America, for depriving the American subjects, in many in∣stances, of the constitutional trial by jury, ex∣posing their lives to danger, by directing a new and illegal trial beyond the seas, for crimes al∣ledged to have been committed in America: And in prosecution of the same system, several late, cruel, and oppressive Acts have been pas∣sed respecting the town of Boston and the Mas∣sachusett's-Bay, and also an Act for extending the province of Quebec, so as to border on the western frontiers of these Colonies, establishing an arbitrary government therein, and discourag∣ing the settlement of British subjects in that wide extended country; thus by the influence of civil principles and ancient prejudices to dis∣pose the inhabitants to act with hostility against the free protestant Colonies, whenever a wicked Ministry shall chuse so to direct them.</P>
<P>To obtain redress of these grievances, which threaten destruction to the lives, liberty, and property of his Majesty's subjects in North∣America, we are of opinion, that a non-impor∣tation, non-consumption, and non-exportation agreement, faithfully adhered to, will prove the most speedy, effectual, and peaceable measure: And therefore we do, for ourselves and the inhabi∣tants of the several Colonies, whom we represent, firmly agree and associate under the sacred ties
<PB N="3" REF="013704_0003_0F91A0F3802FBEA8"/>
of virtue, honor and love of our country, as follows.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>First.</HI> THAT from and after the first day of December next, we will not import into British America, from Great Britain or Ireland, any goods, wares or merchandize whatsoever, or from any other place any such goods, wares or merchandize, as shall have been exported from Great-Britain or Ireland; nor will we, after that day, import any East-India tea from any part of the world; nor any molasses, syrrups, paneles, coffee or piemento, from the British plantations, or from Dominica; nor wines from Madeira, or the Western Islands; nor foreign indigo.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>Second.</HI> THAT we will neither import, nor purchase any slave imported, after the first day of December next; after which time, we will wholly discontinue the slave-trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities or manufactures to those who are concerned in it.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>Third.</HI> As a non-consumption agreement, strictly adhered to, will be an effectual security for the observation of the non-importation, we, as above, solemnly agree and associate, that, from this day, we will not purchase or use any Tea imported on account of the East-India com∣pany, or any on which a duty hath been or shall be paid; and from and after the first day of March next, we will not purchase or use any East-India tea whatever; nor will we, nor shall any person for
<PB N="4" REF="013704_0004_0F91A0F43824D938"/>
or under us, purchase or use any of those goods, wares or merchandize, we have agreed not to import, which we shall know, or have cause to suspect, were imported after the first day of December, except such as come under the rules and directions of the tenth article hereafter mentioned.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>Fourth.</HI> THE earnest desire we have, not to injure our fellow subjects in Great Britain, Ire∣land or the West-Indies, induces us to suspend a non-exportation, until the tenth day of Sep∣tember 1775; at which time, if the said Acts and parts of Acts of the British parliament herein after mentioned are not repealed, we will not, directly or indirectly, export any merchan∣dize or commodity whatsoever to Great Britain, Ireland or the West-Indies, except rice to Europe.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>Fifth.</HI> SUCH as are merchants, and use the British and Irish trade, will give orders, as soon as possible, to their factors, agents and corre∣spondents, in Great-Britain and Ireland, not to ship any goods to them, on any pretence what∣soever, as they cannot be received in America; and if any merchant, residing in Great-Britain or Ireland, shall directly or indirectly ship any goods, wares or merchandize, for America, in order to break the said non-importation agree∣ment, or in any manner contravene the same, on such unworthy conduct being well attested, it ought to be made public; and, on the same being so done, we will not from thenceforth
<PB N="5" REF="013704_0005_0F91A0F4F84A7A08"/>
have any commercial connexion, with such merchant.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>Sixth.</HI> THAT such as are owners of vessels will give positive orders to their captains, or masters, not to receive on board their vessels any goods prohibited by the said non-importati∣on agreement, on pain of immediate dismission from their service.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>Seventh.</HI> WE will use our utmost endeavours to improve the breed of sheep and increase their number to the greatest extent, and to that end, we will kill them as sparingly as may be, espe∣cially those of the most profitable kind; nor will we export any to the West∣Indies or elsewhere; and those of us who are or may become over∣stocked with, or can conveniently spare any sheep, will dispose of them to our neighbours, especially to the poorer sort, on moderate terms.</P>
<P N="8"><HI>Eighth.</HI> THAT we will in our several sta∣tions encourage frugality, oeconomy, and in∣dustry; and promote agriculture, arts, and the manufactures of this country, especially that of wool; and will discountenance and discourage, every species of extravagance and dissipation, especially all horse racing, and all kinds of gaming, cock fighting, exhibitions of shews, plays, and other expensive diversions and en∣tertainments. And on the death of any rela∣tion or friend, none of us, or any of our fami∣lies will go into any further mourning dress, than a black crape or ribbon on the arm or hat
<PB N="6" REF="013704_0006_0F91A0F602BBD058"/>
for Gentlemen, and a black ribbon and neck∣lace for Ladies, and we will discontinue the giving of gloves and scarfs at funerals.</P>
<P N="9"><HI>Ninth.</HI> THAT such as are venders of goods or merchandize, will not take advantage of the scarcity of goods that may be occasioned by this association, but will sell the same at the rates we have been respectively accustomed to do, for twelve months last past.—And if any vender of goods or merchandize, shall sell any such goods on higher terms, or shall in any manner, or by any device whatsoever, violate or depart from this Agreement, no person ought, nor will any of us deal with any such person, or his, or her factor or agent, at any time thereafter, for any commodity whatever.</P>
<P N="10"><HI>Tenth.</HI> IN case any merchant, trader, or other persons shall import any goods or mer∣chandize after the first day of December, and before the first day of February next, the same ought forthwith at the election of the owner, to be either reshipped or delivered up to the Committee of the county, or town wherein they shall be imported, to be stored at the risque of the importer, until the non-importa∣tion Agreement shall cease, or be sold under the direction of the Committee aforesaid; and in the last mentioned case, the owner or owners of such goods, shall be reimbursed (out of the sales) the first cost and charges, the profit if any, to be applied towards relieving and employing such poor inhabitants of the town of Boston, as
<PB N="7" REF="013704_0007_0F91A0F91150D4B0"/>
are immediate sufferers by the Boston Port-Bill; and a particular account of all goods so returned, stored, or sold, to be inserted in the public pa∣pers; and if any goods or merchandizes shall be imported after the said first day of February, the same ought forthwith to be sent back again, without breaking any of the packages thereof.</P>
<P N="11"><HI>Eleventh.</HI> THAT a Committee be chosen in every county, city, and town, by those who are qualified to vote for Representatives in the Legislature, whose business it shall be attentive∣ly to observe the conduct of all persons touching this association; and when it shall be made to ap∣pear to the satisfaction of a majority of any such Committee, that any person within the limits of their appointment has violated this association, that such majority do forthwith cause the truth of the case to be published in the Gazette, to the end, that all such foes to the rights of British America may be publickly known, and univer∣sally contemned as the enemies of American li∣berty; and thenceforth we respectively will break off all dealings with him or her.</P>
<P N="12"><HI>Twelfth.</HI> THAT the Committee of Corre∣spondence in the respective Colonies do fre∣quently inspect the entries of their Custom∣Houses, and inform each other from time to time of the true state thereof, and of every other material circumstance that may occur relative to this association.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="8" REF="013704_0008_0F91A0FA0823F430"/><HI>Thirteenth.</HI> THAT all manufactures of this country be sold at reasonable prices, so that no undue advantage be taken of a future scarcity of goods.</P>
<P N="14"><HI>Fourteenth.</HI> AND we do further agree and resolve, that we will have no trade, commerce, dealings or intercourse whatsoever, with any colony or province, in North-America, which shall not accede to, or which shall hereafter vio∣late this association, but will hold them as un∣worthy of the rights of freemen, and as inimical to the liberties of their country.</P>
<P>And we do solemnly bind ourselves and our constituents, under the ties aforesaid, to adhere to this association until such parts of the several Acts of Parliament passed since the close of the last was, as impose or continue duties on tea, wine, molasses, syrups, paneles, coffee, sugar, piemento, indigo, foreign paper, glass, and painters colours, imported into America, and extend the powers of the Admiralty courts be∣yond their ancient limits, deprive the American subject of trial by jury, authorise the Judge's certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from da∣mages, that he might otherwise be liable to from a trial by his peers, require oppressive security from a claimant of ships or goods seized, before he shall be allowed to defend his property, are repealed—And until that part of the Act of the 12. G. 3 ch. 24. entitled, "An Act for the better securing his Majesty's dock yards, magazines, ships, ammunition, and stores," by
<PB N="9" REF="013704_0009_0F91A0FA409B5988"/>
which, any persons charged with committing any of the offences therein described, in Ame∣rica, may be tried in any shire or country within the realm, is repealed—And until the four Acts passed in the last session of Parliament, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that for stopping the port and blocking up the har∣bour of Boston—That for altering the charter and government of the Massachusett's-Bay—And that which is entitled, "An Act for the better administration of justice, &amp;c."—And that "For extending the limits of Quebec, &amp;c." are repealed. And we recommend it to the provincial conventions, and to the commit∣tees in the respective Colonies, to establish such farther regulations as they may think proper, for carrying into execution this Association.</P>
<P>THE foregoing Association being determined upon by the CONGRESS, was ordered to be sub∣scribed by the several Members thereof; and thereupon we have hereunto set our respective names accordingly.</P>
