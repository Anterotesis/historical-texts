A <HI>Short Prayer</HI>▪ this; But a very <HI>Great Prayer</HI> it is. A few Words: and an Abundance of Impor∣tant Matter Contained in them. Some very Ig∣norant Ones are at a loss how to <HI>Pray.</HI> Especially, Our <HI>Little Children</HI> are to have their Ignorance relieved, in our <HI>Teaching</HI> them, <HI>how to Pray.</HI> There are some <HI>Sentences</HI> in our Bible, easy to be Re∣membred, easy to be Repeated If those <HI>brief Sentences</HI> were well Understood, &amp; well Improved, they would be mighty <HI>Prayers,</HI> when well ut∣tered before the Lord. There is a Pathetic <HI>Prayer,</HI> in that Sentence, <HI>O Lord, I beseech thee to deliver my Soul</HI>! There is a Powerful <HI>Prayer,</HI> in that Sentence, <HI>GOD be Merciful to me a Sinner!</HI> There is a Comprehensive <HI>Prayer</HI> in that Sentence, <HI>I am Oppressed, Lord, Undertake for me.</HI> Such <HI>Ejacula∣tions</HI> may prove <HI>Arrows in the hands</HI> of a <HI>mighty</HI> Faith; <HI>Happy</HI> the Soul that has a <HI>Quiver full of them.</HI> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole <HI>Bible</HI> is of use, especially our <HI>Psalter,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll the <HI>Quiver.</HI> But of all those <HI>Ar∣ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> methinks, there can be none more Signifi∣cant, than that which we are now to take into our Hands. Yea, the poor Dying <HI>Offenders,</HI> I hope I may say, <HI>Penitents,</HI> now in the Auditory, have express'd their Desires, That This may be the Text, which they shall now hear treated on; A Text from a Paragraph of the Bible, which since their Condemnation to <HI>Dy,</HI> they have much Lived upon. Oh! That this <HI>Prayer</HI> may be often heard going up from us, before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord! Yea, Tis a <HI>Prayer</HI> which the smallest of us, and they that are least acquainted with <HI>Prayer</HI>▪ least furnished for <HI>Prayer,</HI> may yet send up unto the Lord. <HI>Lord, Turn thou me, and I shall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002551_0007_0FDB4D9B6F928EF0"/>IF the Prayer were to be interpreted, for the <HI>Return</HI> of the <HI>Israelites</HI> from their Captivity; even such a lower Interpretation would bring Instructi∣on with it unto us. It would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstruct us, That if we would see any <HI>Happy Turn</HI> upon our Condition, we should look up to our GOD for it. When we find our Affairs Plunged unto Difficulties we wish for an <HI>Happy Turn</HI> upon them. Our whole Con∣dition is at the Disposal of the Glorious GOD.

<P>THIS Meditation must be superseded by One of yet more Importance. The <HI>Conversion</HI> of a Sin∣ner unto GOD, is the Thing, which our Eye must here be most upon. Of this <HI>Conversion</HI>▪ we have two very Remarkable Things intimated unto us, in the Text now before us. <HI>First.</HI> We have the <HI>Way</HI> wherein a Conversion to GOD, is to be Ex∣pected and Obtained. A <HI>Petition</HI> to GOD for it,
<PB N="4" REF="002551_0008_0FDB136665250880"/>
is the way wherein a <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD is to be looked for. It is, <HI>Turn thou me &amp; I shall be Turned. Secondly</HI> We have the <HI>Act</HI>▪ wherein a <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD is to be Expressed and Assured. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of GOD is to be laid hold upon; and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD is accomplished. It is in coming to this, <HI>Thou art the Lord my GOD.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, We have <HI>Two Doctrines</HI> be∣fore us. The <HI>Latter Rain,</HI> shall tell us, what we have to do in our <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD. The <HI>For∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> shall tell us, what we have to do, that we may <HI>attain</HI> unto it. And we won't forget a large Declaration, <HI>why</HI> all this must be done.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<P>The <HI>First</HI> of our <HI>Doctrines,</HI> is this.</P>
<P><HI>THAT the Glorious GOD may be Savingly Turn'd unto, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is to be Seriously Sought un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Conversion</HI> to the Gracious GOD, is a Bles∣sedness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or which the <HI>GOD of all Grace</HI> is to be <HI>Pray'd</HI> unto. We must <HI>Pray</HI> to GOD for His <HI>Converting Grace</HI>; Pray, <HI>Turn thou me</HI>; that so we may indeed be <HI>turned</HI> unto Him.</P>
<P>MY Discourse must be all carried on, with the Style of <HI>Application.</HI> There is nothing to be now spoken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so <HI>Practical</HI> an Aspect, and so worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down in the Flaming <HI>Fire of GOD,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may well be <HI>applied</HI> with all the Closeness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> imaginable.</P>

<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> YOUR <HI>seeking</HI> to GOD, and asking of Him to <HI>Turn</HI> you, is the <HI>Turning Point.</HI> Your <HI>Turn</HI> to GOD, is upon its <HI>Crisis,</HI> in your coming to make this <HI>Prayer, O Turn thou me!</HI> The Demand upon you, is, <HI>Turn ye, and Live; why will ye Dy</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> There can be nothing more positively demanded. The Reply of the <HI>slothful</HI> Sinner is, <HI>I cannot Turn.</HI> Indeed, there is in the Wicked, such a <HI>way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ly∣ving,</HI> that they are always <HI>contradicting</HI> of them∣selves.

When they <HI>put off</HI> their Turn to GOD, until the Time, which they say, they will take for it, they do in effect say, That it is in their <HI>own Power</HI> to <HI>Turn</HI> when they please. But now he says, <HI>I cannot Turn.</HI> Indeed there is too much Truth in the Reply. And yet, there is no excuse for a Wicked <HI>sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th</HI> in it. For, <HI>First</HI>; Why do you not now fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down before the Lord, with such a <HI>Supplication</HI> as this; <HI>O Turn thou me, and I shall be Turned.</HI> In the <HI>Conversion</HI> of a Sinner, you say, <HI>GOD is to do all.</HI> Well, But then, why don't you <HI>cry mightily</HI> unto <HI>GOD,</HI> that He would please to do, what is to be done in you and for you? Why are you not Restless, until you can say,—Isa. XXVI.12. <HI>Lord, Thou hast wrought all our Works in us!</HI> Do not say, you cannot <HI>Pray.</HI> What would you do, if you were (as here some are) certainly informed, That you were to <HI>Dy</HI> in a few dayes, &amp; had receiv'd a Summons to appear this Week before the Tri∣bunal of GOD? Surely, you would not fit in the Posture of the Sluggard, and say, <HI>I cannot Pray.</HI> No; you would cast yourselves prostrate in the Dust before the Lord, and wrestle with Him, <HI>Oh! Help me to Pray! Oh! Give me a New Heart! Almighty Spirit of Grace, Work thy Good Work in me. Oh! Turn thou me! Do not leave me to Perish in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins</HI>! And why can't you <HI>now</HI> do so? You cannot <HI>Abhor</HI> your Sin. But then, why don't you Beg it of GOD? <HI>Lord, enable me to Abhor my Sin.</HI> You cannot <HI>Embrace</HI> your Saviour. But then, why don't you Beg it of GOD? <HI>Lord, enable me to em∣brace my Saviour.</HI> That which makes yet more for your Prayer, <HI>O Turn thou me</HI>; is this.

XIX.7. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Con∣verts the Soul.</HI> Wherefore, It must be on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Advice to you; <HI>Read the Word of GOD.</HI> Let not one day ordinarily roll away, without Reading a Portion in your <HI>Bible.</HI> But let the <HI>Reading</HI> be with <HI>At∣tention,</HI> with <HI>Reverence,</HI> with <HI>Lessons</HI> fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch'd out of it, which you will turn into <HI>Wishes</HI> before the Lord. Especially let it be with some such Hope as this;
<Q>Oh! That by the Word of GOD, I may be Turn'd unto Him.</Q>
It must be a further Advice unto you; <HI>Hear the Word of GOD.</HI> Neglect no Opportunities for <HI>Hearing</HI> the <HI>Gospel of your Salva∣tion.</HI> Know you not, That <HI>Faith comes by Hearing</HI>? Oh! Come to <HI>Hear,</HI> in <HI>Hope,</HI> that the <HI>Faith</HI> which will <HI>Turn</HI> you to GOD may now be given you. Come in <HI>Hope,</HI> that the <HI>Word will be mixed with the Faith</HI> which will <HI>Turn</HI> you to GOD. Come with <HI>Hope,</HI> that it will be with you▪ as it was with <HI>Peters</HI> Hearers, and that the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> by whom you shall be <HI>Turned</HI> unto GOD, will <HI>fall</HI> upon you in your <HI>Hearing.</HI> And like him who said, Psal. XXVII.8. <HI>When thou saidst, seek my Face, my Heart said, Thy Face, Lord, I will seek.</HI> So, while you are <HI>Hearing</HI> the Word of GOD, form suitable <HI>Acts of Compliance</HI> with it. <HI>Comply</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="002551_0030_0FDB4D5F68B81E38"/>
as far as you can with what you Hear. Especially when you Hear those <HI>Ioyful Sounds</HI> of the Gospel, wherein a <HI>Turn</HI> to GOD, is more peculiarly called for, <HI>Try</HI> whether GOD has not <HI>Enabled</HI> you to Comply with them. When you hear such a word as that; <HI>seek the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hile He may be fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, call upon Him while He is near; Try</HI> whether you can∣not Comply, and say, <HI>Lord, I will seek thee from this Time, I will call upon thee as long as I Live</HI>! When you hear such a word as that, <HI>Put away the Evil of your Doings from before mine Eyes; Try</HI> whether you cannot Comply, and say, <HI>Lord I will from this time have done with all Evil doings.</HI> When you hear such a word as that; <HI>Him that comes unto me, I will in no wise cast out</HI>; Now <HI>Try</HI> whether you cannot Comply, and say, <HI>O my Saviour, I come unto thee! Acts of Compliance</HI> formed in the Soul, when <HI>Acts of Piety</HI> are called for, will suddenly surprize you into a <HI>Turn</HI> unto GOD. In such a way of <HI>Hearing</HI> the Word of GOD, and of <HI>Trying</HI> to comply with it, a <HI>Turn</HI> to GOD is to be looked for.</P>
<P>I hope, you are by this time abundantly sensi∣ble, of what is pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed upon you.</P>
<P>BUT will it not be a sweet <HI>Assistenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> unto you, in the work which you are to go upon, if I show you in <HI>One Word,</HI> what is the <HI>Turn</HI> to GOD, which you are to be brought unto?
