<P>NOtwithstanding the great and unvaluable good that hath
in all ages of the World accrued to Mankind by Order
and Goverment, yet such is the depravedness of mans na∣ture,
and imperfection of his knowledge, that it is as well
hard to find out, as difficult to maintain, such a Form
and Order of Goverment as will prove a sufficient Fence
and security for so great a treasure as is the common good, and publick
safety. After the sad and long experience of former times, some have
thought no means can be found out so effectual for the upholding and
and preserving the same, with all the sacred and civill rights and privi∣ledges
therunto belonging, as a liberty for people to designe and choose
out from among themselves, the persons that are to be intrusted with
those great concerns. Whatever may be said for the extolling the hap∣piness
of them that have such an advantage in their hands, all that may
be comprehended within the compass of such a power, it is for the pre∣sent
in the principal and leading part thereof devolved upon your selves
in all the three Colonies of <HI>New-England;</HI> who by the choyce of the free
people in those your several Jurisdictions, are now called to act your se∣veral
parts as chief on the publick stage of Goverment. Ever since you
have taken your turns at the helm, there have been very boisterous
winds and rough Seas, threatning the shipwrack of all; which notwith∣standing,
you need not be discouraged, while due consideration is had, to
whom, and what you have embarqued with you. When once the great
<HI>Roman Conquerer,</HI> and chief founder of their Monarchy, was passing the
<HI>Adriatick Sea</HI> in a disguize, the Pilot being dismayed with the fierceness of
the wind, the raging of the waves, his Passenger pulled off his disguize, and
<PB REF="000231_0004_0FA9ABCA2A75E750"/>
bid him be of good courage and not fear, for the carried <HI>Caesar,</HI> and all
his Fortunes: Surely Jesus Christ and all his promises, in which you
are not a little concerned, is a far better ground of comfort and encou∣ragement
in a stormy season. <HI>Luther</HI> was wont to say, or did once in
a great exigent say, that he had rather <HI>ruere cum Christo quàm stare cum
Caesare;</HI> accounting Christ a better friend, though falling as to the world
to trust to, then <HI>Caesar</HI> standing in power, according to the words of
Christ himself, <HI>greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the World:</HI> So
as all such may say with the Prophet, <HI>Rejoyce not against me O mine enemy;
for when I fall, I shall rise, when I sit in aarkness, the Lord shall be a Light
unto me;</HI> which I trust your selves have had so much experience of, in
these late dark dispensations, that if sometimes you have not seen, yet al∣wayes
you have believed that <HI>Light was sowne for the righteous,</HI> and that
there shall be a cleer breaking forth of the sun, after the tempest is
over; what God hath planted, shall not by man, or any of
Satans Instruments be plucked up. It is with young Colonies, as it
is with trees newly planted, which those winds, as one saith, that are not
so boisterous as to blow down, doe so far advantage as to shake them to
a greater fastness at the root. The Soveraign Ruler of the World doth
usually by such wayes and meanes bring about his peoples good, at the
first, not well understood, nor easily brooked, till the quiet fruit of righ∣teousness
be discerned to spring up unto all such as are exercised
therein. It hath been no small advantage that the staff of Goverment,
and the shields of this part of the earth were put into your hands (before
the Boar out of the Wood hath broke into this Vineyard) who under God
we trust may be found the repairers of the breach, and the Restorers of
Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hs to dwell in, while both your selves, and those under your charge.
and conduct, are looking unto him, who is promised to be the peace of
his people when the <HI>Assyrian</HI> shall come into their land.</P>
<P>The consideration of the power wherewith you are invested, together
with the great Wisdome, Faithfulness and Courage by which it hath been
managed by you, in your several stations, hath induced me to desire that
the Historicall discourse ensuing might pass into publick view under the
umbrage of your Protection. If a reason be demanded for the entitu∣ling
so many names of worth to the patronage of so small and inconsi∣derable
a Volume; I need no other Apology at this time, then I find in
the words of the Wise Man; there are cases wherein <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o are better then
one, and a three-fold Cord is not casily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roken:</HI> For it being like to pass
through your several Jurisdictions, I conceived it might need a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sport
<PB REF="000231_0005_0FA9ABCC8B03EA70"/>
of safe conduct from him that doth preside in either of them. It carries
nothing with it but truth, (as I hope will be found) which may wel ex∣pect
to meet with a ready Welcome, and suitable entertainmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in every honest mind▪ but all men are not so equally ballanced in
their affections as to bear with plain dealing, and give that harmless
dove a resting place in their minds for the sole of her soot. Of all
Writings, those that are historical, specially while the things menti∣oned
are fresh in memory, and the actors themselves surviving,
had need be pursued with a wary<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pace. Notwithstanding the great care
that hath been taken to give all and every one, any way concerned in
the subject of the discourse, their just due, and nothing more or less,
yet perhaps some critical Reader will not let every sentence pass with∣out
some censure or other. It was once by a great man accounted no
small offence in an harmless Poet, that some of his titles were misplaced
as they were marshalled up in their order: If any Historian should com∣mit
an error paralel thereunto, a pardon, as it may be needed, in such a
Script as is the present Narrative, so may it be the better expected while
pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing up &amp; down under the guard of your authority, yea thô it should
cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce to be an offence of an higher nature; as the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iming of some
p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssages, mistaking the distance of some places, or too often touching
upon the same particulars, which could not be well avoided in a Collection
of so many occurrents too hastily drawn up, though true, yet unsea∣sonably,
or out of due time coming to light without a total omission of
some material passages. It was intended at the first only as a private es∣say,
wherein to bind up together the most memorable passages of divine
provide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, during our late, or former troubles with the <HI>Indians,</HI> it
might have remained in the place where it was first conceived &amp; formed,
or been smoothered as an imperfect Embrio, not worthy to see the light,
if some such as your selves had not both quickned the being, and hast∣ned
the birth thereof. Something of this nature may be of use to po∣sterity,
as well as to those of the present Generation, to help them both
to call mind, and carry along the memory of such eminent deliverances,
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cial preservations granted by divine favour to the people here;
as it was of old commanded of God himself, that a Register should be
kept of those Warrs, which in opposition to others, were in a peculiar
manner to be called the Warrs of the Lord; and such are these here
treated of, if any, since miraculous deliverances have ceased, may truly
be said to deserve that title. If it had fallen into some ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er hard, it might
have been set forth with better choyce of words, and more fit expressi∣ons,
<PB REF="000231_0006_0FA9ABCD282C9390"/>
that might have left a deeper impression on the minds of those who
are most concerned to retain it; however it being now like to be brought
to publick view, I have presumed to offer it to your selves, as on the
accounts forementioned, so also as a testimony of my thankfull and
deserved acknowledgment of that wisdome and integrity abundantly
shewn forth in the administration of your authority.</P>
<P>Much honoured and Honourable, I have nothing more to adde, but
the engagement of my continual and daily prayers to the God of the
Spirits of all flesh, that he would carry you through all troubles, diffi∣cultyes
and tryals you may be conflicting with, whither personal or po∣litical,
and that he would bless your Councells at home, prosper your
enterprizes abroad, and long continue your light in the present Genera∣tion,
for his own glory, and his peoples good, that after you have served
your Generation here, your memory like that of the just, may be bles∣ed,
and that you may leave peace as the inheritance of the remaining Is∣rael
of God in these ends of the earth, which is and shall be the earnest
wish, and constant desire</P>

<HEAD>An Advertisement to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THe following historical Essay, was when first drawn up, intended only for
the satisfaction of a private Friend, &amp; not for the use of the publick; ther∣fore
hope I may be excused, if I fall short therein of that exactness, which
might be expected from one that designedly undertook a Work of this nature:
however tursting more to the judgment of some who have accidentally had the
perusal thereof, then mine own, I am not unwilling that others should receive be∣nefit
thereby. The Compiler of an History can challenge little to himself but
methodizing the work, the materials being found to his hand: diligence in
gathering them together, and faithfulness in improving them, is all that is
upon point required of him, in both which I have endeavoured to make good,
what the profession I have now taken up obliges me unto. The matters of fact
therein related (being rather Massacres, barbarous inhumane outrages, then
acts of Hostility, or valiant atchievements) no more deserve the name of a
VVarre, then the report of them the title of an History, therefore I contented
my self with a Narrative. Much of what is therein mentioned, dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding
on the single authority of particular persons, an exact description of every oc∣current
was har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely to be obtained: All Souldiers are not like <HI>Caesar,</HI> able
to describe with their pens, what they have done with their Swords: But the
most material passages inserted, were either gathered out of the Letters, or
taken from the mouthes of such as were eye or ear-witnesses of the things them∣selves;
and those also persons worthy of credit. In such passages as were va∣riously
reported by the Actors, or Spectators, that which seemed most proba∣ble
is only inserted. If any error be committed about the Scituation or di∣stance
of places, it may deserve an excuse rather then a censure: For our
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the pursuit of their enemies being drawn into many desert places,
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Woods, and unknown Paths, which no Geographers hand ever
measured, scarce any vultures eye had ever seen, there was a necessity to take
up many things in reference thereunto upon no better credit sometimes then
common Report. One or two passages need a more particular excuse, or at
least explication As where it is said, <HI>p. 2. that the first Colony was sent
hither</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, 1606, The mistake is easily helped, by minding the Reader that
the Patent or Commission was that year granted, when also Capt. <HI>Henery
Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ons</HI> was sent over upon some further discovery of the Country, before the
Adventurers would hazard a greater charge: soon after the departure of the
said <HI>Challons,</HI> the same year Sr. <HI>John Popham,</HI> one of the principal under∣takers,
sent out another ship to second him under the Command of Capt. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣man,
Martin Prin of Bristow</HI> being Master, who not finding <HI>Challons</HI> (for
he miscaried in his design being seized by some Strangers in the way) yet re∣turning
<PB REF="000231_0008_0FA9ABD2F0DDF2E0"/>
with good news, the next year they sent out two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with an hundred
men, with Ordnance and other Provision, under the conduct of Capt. Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Popham,</HI> &amp; Capt. <HI>Rawley Gilbert,</HI> who built a Fort in some place about <HI>Sa∣ga
de hoch,</HI> called St. <HI>George<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fort,</HI> the ruines of which are remaining to
this day, as some say. Probably other like mistakes may be observed, in des∣cribing
the bounds and dimensions of some of the Patents, &amp; grants of land be∣longing
to the other Colonies, but an Historian being no Pretorian Iudge, his
report cannot prejudice any peoples Iurisdiction, or persons propriety.</P>
<P>Further also where it is said, <HI>p. 7. That the Indians had lived peaceably
with the English here near forty years, ever since the</HI> Pequod <HI>Warr;</HI> it
is to be understood with reference to publick acts of Hostility; for particular
mischiefs have been committed by several Indians in some parts of the Country
but the actors were not abetted therein by any of their Country-men: As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Nantucket,</HI> an Island to the eastward of <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> where in the end of the
year 1664. some villanous Indians murthered some that suffered shipwrac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon that Island, yet justice was done upon two or three of the chief actors. In
like manner within a few years after the <HI>Pequod Warrs,</HI> Mris. <HI>Hutchin∣son</HI>
was killed by the Indians near a Dutch Plantation; about which time
some other insol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncies of like nature were acted by the Indians southward, ei∣ther
upon long Island, or in some place within <HI>New-haven</HI> Colony. Also a
murther was committed at <HI>Farmington,</HI> another at <HI>Woburn,</HI> by some Indi∣ans
in their drunken humors, upon a maid-servant or two, who denied them
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rink. All which hinder not the truth of what is affirmed in the Narra∣tive,
such murthers being too frequently committed in the most peaceable pla∣ces
in the world. Such errors as are the forementioned, being overlooked by
the Candid Reader, it is presumed, there will not be many other faults to be
complained of, unless such as are meerly Typographical, or else were ocasioned
by the dropping in of particular passages, after the whole was drawn up,
which I was willing to insert, although it occasioned the discourse in some pla∣ces,
to be a little more confused then else would have been. If ever the matter
require another edition, more acurateness may be observed. If those into

<P>KNown unto God are all his works from the foundation of the
world, though manifest to us, only by the events of time,
that fruitful mother of all things, which in the former age
did bring forth, at least did bring to light the knowledge of
this western World, called <HI>America,</HI> that in all foregoing times and ages,
lay hid in this obscure and remote Region, covered with a veyle of ig∣norance,
and looked up from the knowledge of all the rest of the Inha∣bitants
of the Earth. To whom the honour of its investigation doth
of eight more properly belong, is sufficiently declared by the Hystory
and Reports of such as were ey witnesses thereof, and not in ended to
be any part of the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent disquisition. The most considerable part of
all the North side of <HI>America,</HI> is called <HI>New England.</HI> In the fertility
of the Soyle, salubriousness of the Air, and many other commodious
advantages, most resembling the Country from whence it borrowed
its appellation. For the knowledge thereof the World is most behol∣ding
to the discoveries of the English, under the conduct of <HI>Sebastian
Cabbot</HI> a famous Porreguez about the year 1497. though since much
<PB N="2" REF="000231_0014_0FA9ABD96E9621D8"/>
perfected by the industry and travels of Captain <HI>Gosnold,</HI> Captain <HI>Hud∣son,</HI>
Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> and others of the English Nation. <HI>North-America</HI>
this posthumous birth of time, is as to its na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vity, of the same stand∣ing
with her two elder Sisters <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico,</HI> yet was suffered to ly in
its Swadling-clothes, one whole Century of years, nature having pro∣mised
no such Dowry of rich Mines of Silver and Gold to them that
would espouse her for their own, as she did unto the other two, which
possibly was the reason why she was not so hastily deflowred by her first
discoverers, nor yet so early courted by any of the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI>
lying wholly neglected as it were, until a small company of Planters, un∣der
the command of Captain <HI>George Popham,</HI> and Captain <HI>Gilbert</HI> were
sent over at the charge of Sir <HI>Iohn Popham</HI> in the year 1606 to begin a
Colony upon a Tract of Land about <HI>Saga de hoch,</HI> scituate on the south
side of the River of <HI>Kennibeck</HI> and about that called <HI>Shipscot River,</HI> a∣bout
twenty miles south-West from <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> the most Northerly
bound of all <HI>New-England.</HI> But that design within two years expiring
with its first Founder, soon after some honourable persons of the West
of <HI>England,</HI> commonly called the Counsel of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> being more
certainly informed of several Navigable Rivers and commodious Ha∣vens,
with other places fit either for Traffick or Planting, newly disco∣vered
by many skilful Navigators, obtained a Grant by Patent, under
the great Seal from King <HI>Iames</HI> of blessed memory, of all that part of
<HI>North America,</HI> called <HI>New-England.</HI> From the 40 to the 48. gr <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of
North Latitude. From which Grand and Original Patent, all other
Charters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Graunts of Land from <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> to <HI>Delaware Bay,</HI> along
the Sea-coast, derive their Linage and Pedigree; thus was that vast tract
of Land, after the year 1612. cantoned and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>celled out into many les∣ser
Divisions and parcels, according as Adventurers presented, which
said Graunts being founded upon uncertain, or false Descriptions, and
Reports of some that Travelled thither, did many of them interfere one
upon another, to the great disturbance of the first Planters, and preju∣dice
of the Proprietors themselves, as is too well known by any that have
had occasion to stay never so little amongst them, many of whom are
yet surviving. For notwithstanding the great charge and vast expences
the first Adventurers were at, the first Proprietors of the whole <HI>Province</HI>
of <HI>Mayne</HI> and others (reaching from the head of <HI>Casco Bay</HI> North-east
to the mouth of <HI>Pascataqua River</HI> about sixty miles Westward) and the
hopes they migh have conceived of being the first Founders of <HI>New∣Colonies,</HI>
and of enlarging their Estates and Inheritances by those new
acquired possessions and Lordships, there was little profit reaped from
<PB N="3" REF="000231_0015_0FA9ABDA423A5000"/>
thence, after the rich fleeces of Beaver were gleaned away, nor any great
improvement made of those large portions of Lands, save the erecting
of some few Cottages for Fishermen, and a few inconsiderable Buildings
for the Planters, which were on those occasions drawn over the Sea, to
settle upon the most northerly parts of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>But whither it were by the imprudence of the first Adventurers, or
the dissoluteness of the persons they sent over to manage their Affairs,
or whither want of faithfulness or skill to manage their trust, they were
by degrees in a manner quite deserted almost of Laws and Government,
and left to shift for themselves, by which means at last they fell under the
Jurisdiction of the <HI>Massachusets Colony,</HI> not by Usurpation, as is by
great mistake suggested to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> but by necessity, and the earnest
desire of the Planters themselves, to accept of whom, those of the
<HI>Massachusets Colony</HI> were the more easily induced, in that they appre∣hended
the bounds of their own Patent, by a favourable Interpretation
of the words describing the Northern Line [Three miles beyond the
most Northerly branch of Merimack River] do reach somewhat be∣yond
<HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> the North-west limits of all <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>This was the first begining of things in <HI>New-England,</HI> at which time
they were not unlike the times of old, when the people of <HI>Iudah</HI> were
said to be without a Teaching P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iest, and without Law; and no wonder
things were no more successfully carried on.</P>
<P>In the Year 1620. a Company belonging to Mr. <HI>Robinsons</HI> Church at
<HI>Leyden</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> although they had been courteously entertained by
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as Strangers sojourning amongst them, yet foreseeing many
inconveniencies like to increase, and that they could not so well provide
for the good of their Posterity, under the Government of a forreign
Nation: they resolved to intreat so much favour from their own Sove∣raign
Prince King <HI>Iames,</HI> as to grant them liberty under the shelter of
his Royal Authority, to place themselves in some part of <HI>New-England,</HI>
then newly discovered; wherefore having obtained some kind of Patent
or Graunt, for some place about <HI>Hudsons River,</HI> they set sayle from <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI>
in <HI>September</HI> for the Southern parts of <HI>New-England,</HI> but as they
intended to bend their course thither ward, <HI>per varios casus, per tot dis∣crimina
rerum;</HI> they were at last cast upon a bosome of the South Cape
of the <HI>Massachusets Bay,</HI> called <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> about the 11th of <HI>November,</HI>
from whence the Winter so fast approaching, they had no opportunity to
remove; and finding some incouragement from the hopefulness of the
Soyle, and courtesie of the Heathen, they resolved there to make their
abode for the future, which they did, laying the foundation of a new Co∣lony,
<PB N="4" REF="000231_0016_0FA9ABDAF46B4020"/>
which from the remembrance of the last Town in <HI>England</HI> they
sailed from, they called <HI>New-Plimouth;</HI> containing no very considerable
Tract of Land, scarce extending an hundred miles in length through the
whole Cape, and scarce half so much in breadth where it is broadest.
The first Founders of that Colony aiming more at Religion then Earthly
Poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssions, aspiring not to any large dimension of Land, in their setling
upon those Coasts.</P>
<P>At <HI>Weymouth</HI> also was a Plantation begun by Mr. <HI>Weston</HI> in the year
1622. but it came to little.</P>
<P>The North and South Border of the <HI>Massachusets Bay</HI> being thus
planted, the middle part was the more easie to be filled up, which thus
was brought about. Some Gentlemen and others, observing how it
fared with those of <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> were desiring upon the like ground
to make the same attempt for themselves, wherefore having by a consi∣derable
sum of money purchased of the Councell of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> all their
right and interest in a Plantation there begun in the <HI>Massachusets Bay,</HI>
and having attained a confirmation thereof by Patent from King <HI>Charls</HI>
of famous memory, in the year 1628, they sent over a Governour with
several persons to lay some foundation of an other Colony in the <HI>Mas∣sachusets
Bay:</HI> and in the year 1630, more of the persons interested in
the said <HI>Patent</HI> (thence commonly called <HI>Patentees</HI>) with several other
persons, intending to venture their lives and all with them, trans∣ported
themselves and their Families into the said <HI>Massachusets,</HI> who
did in a short space of time by the accession of many hundreds, who e∣very
year flocked after them, make such increase, that in the space of
five or six years, there were twenty considerable Towns built and peo∣pled,
and many of the Towns first planted, became so filled with Inha∣bitants,
that like Swarms of Bees they were ready to swarm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, not only
into new Plantations, but into new Colonies, insomuch that in the year
1635 a new Colony began to be planted upon <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, partly
by combination amongst themselves, removing from some Towns about
the <HI>Massachusets Bay,</HI> and partly by the interest of a Patent purchased
of that honourable Gentle man Mr. <HI>Fennick,</HI> Agent for the Lord <HI>Sey,</HI>
and Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> the Lords Proprietors of the said River <HI>Connecticut,</HI> at
the mouth of which River they had built a fort, (called after their own
titles <HI>Sey-Brook Fort</HI>) commanding the passage of the said River. Yea
such was the Confluence of people making over into those parts, that
in the year 1637 a fourth Colony began to be planted, bearing the name
of <HI>Newhaven</HI> from the first Town erected therein, seated near the mid∣way
betwixt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Hudsons River</HI> and that of <HI>Connecticot.</HI> The Sea coast from
<PB N="5" REF="000231_0017_0FA9ABDC57F7C9B8"/>
the pitch of <HI>Cape Cod</HI> to the mouth of <HI>Connecticot River,</HI> inhabited by
several nations of Indians, <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpanoogs</HI> (the first Authors of the present
Rebellion) <HI>Narhagansits, Pequoes, Mohegins,</HI> as the more inland part
of the Country by the <HI>Nipnets</HI> (a general name for all inland Indians
betwixt the <HI>Massachusets</HI> and <HI>Connecticut River</HI>) The Sea-coast South∣west
from <HI>Plimouth</HI> was first possessed by some discontented with the Go∣verment
of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony, from which some being exiled, o∣thers
of their friends accompanying of them, setled themselves upon a
fair Island to the South-west of <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> now called <HI>Road-Island,</HI> others
setled upon the Mayn, at a place called <HI>Providence,</HI> and so by degrees
planting toward <HI>Narrhaganset Bay,</HI> made another Plantation called
<HI>Warwick,</HI> which places are since by Patent conferred upon the Inhabi∣tants
of <HI>Road-Island;</HI> the rest of the Country from <HI>Pequod River</HI> to the
River of <HI>Connecticot,</HI> falling within the bounds of <HI>Connecticot Colony</HI>
by Patent also, since confirmed to the said Colony. Things had been
very prosperously and succesfully carried on in all the foresaid Colonyes
and Jurisdictions, from the year 1620, to the year 1636, at which time
the <HI>Pequod</HI> Indians, the most warlike and fierce of all the Indians in that
part of the Country, who had made all the rest of the Indians to stand in
awe, having committed many barbarous outrages upon their neighbour
Indians, both <HI>Narhagansets</HI> on the east side, and <HI>Mohegins</HI> on the west
side of them: and also upon the English and Dutch, as they came occa∣sionally
to traffick with them: and in the year 1634, having barbarou∣sly
murthered Capt. Stone and Capt. Norton, as they were trading with
them. Afterwards one <HI>Oldham</HI> coming amongst them upon the like
account. In l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke manner having committed several outrages upon the
planters about <HI>Connecticut River,</HI> the Inhabitants of all the Colonyes,
unanimously setting upon them in the beginning of the year 1637, they
were easily suppressed, about 700 of them destroyed, the rest either fled
to the <HI>Mohawkes,</HI> by whom they were all cut off that escaped, or else
sheltring themselves under the <HI>Narhagansets &amp; Mohegins</HI> their neigh∣bours,
they were by the power of the English all subjected to one of
those two Nations of the Indians. <HI>Miantonimoh</HI> the chief Sachem or
Lord of the <HI>Narhagansets,</HI> expecting to be sole Lord and Ruler over all
the Indians, after the <HI>pequods</HI> were subdued, began to quarrell with the
<HI>Mohegins</HI> upon the account of Soveraignty, notwithstanding a firm A∣greement
was made betwixt the English and the said <HI>Narhagansets</HI> in
the year 1637, when they had helped to destroy the <HI>Pequods,</HI> and also
notwithstanding the tripartite League between the said <HI>Narhagansets,</HI>
the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> and the English at <HI>Hartford</HI> (the chief Town of <HI>Connecti∣cut</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="000231_0018_0FA9ABDC7440A1F8"/>
Colony) made in the, year 1638, wherein the said Indians were so∣lemaly
ingaged not to quarrel either with the Mohegins, or any other
Indians, untill they had first asked the advice of the English, to whose
determination they had likewise obliged themselves to stand, in all fol∣lowing
Differences among them. Yet did these ambitious <HI>Narhagansets</HI>
specially their chief Leader <HI>Miantonimob;</HI> bare such an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inveterate hatred
against the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> that they were every year picking quarrels with
them. The <HI>Mohegins</HI> on the other side though not so numerous, yet
a more warlike people and more politick, alwayes made their recourse
to the English, complaining of the insolencies of the <HI>Narhagansets,</HI> con∣trary
to their League, so as they would hardly be kept from making open
warre against them, when they say all other attempts to kill and de∣stroy
<HI>Vncas</HI> the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Sachem, by Treachery, poyson, &amp; Sorcery prove
ineffectual. Insomuch that at last the malice of <HI>Miantonimoh</HI> and his
<HI>Narrhagansets</HI> grew to that height, that they began to plot against the
English themselves, for defending of <HI>Vncas.</HI> But it being discovered
by <HI>Vncas</HI> and some of his men to the English, <HI>Miantonimoh</HI> was sent
for by the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt to come to <HI>Boston</HI> when he came there,
he would have denyed those things laid to his charge, he was conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted
by one of his own fellowers; and instead of standing to his promise, to
deliver him to the <HI>Mohegin</HI> Sachem whose Subject he was, going home∣ward
he cut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> off his head, to prevent his telling m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re tales. And with
great discontent as he was going home said he would come no more at
<HI>Boston,</HI> wherein he proved a truer prophet then he himself believed when
he uttered the words, for in the end of the same year 1643 making war
upon <HI>Vncas,</HI> he was taken prisoner by him, and soon after by the advice
of the Commissioners of the four Colonyes, (at that time united firmly
into a League offensive and defensive, on which account they were after
that time called the united Colonyes of <HI>New-England:</HI> though since that
time they are reduced but to three Colonyes; that of <HI>New-haven</HI> and
<HI>Connecticot</HI> by the last Patent being conjoyned in one) his head was cut
off by <HI>Vncas,</HI> it being ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly feared, that there would never be any firm
peace, either betwixt the English and the <HI>Narhagansets,</HI> or betwixt the
<HI>Narhagansets</HI> and the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> while <HI>Miantonimoh</HI> was left alive: how∣ever
the <HI>Narhagansets</HI> have ever since that time borne an implacable
malice against <HI>Vncas,</HI> and all the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> and for their sakes secretly
against the English, so far as they durst discover it.</P>
<P>In the years 1645, and 1646. they grew so insolent,
that the Commissioners of the united Colonyes were compel∣led
to raise Forces to go against them, but when they perceived that
<PB N="7" REF="000231_0019_0FA9ABDD32F355C0"/>
the English were in good earnest, they began to be afraid, and sued for
peace, and submitted to pay a tribute to satisfy for the charge of prepa∣ration
for the warr, but were alwayes very backward to make payment
untill the English were forced to demand it by new Forces, so that it
appeared they were unwillingly willing to hold any friendly correspon∣dence
with the English, yet durst they never make any open attempt
upon them, untill the present Rebellion, where in that they had no small
land, is too too evident, notwithstanding all their pretences to the con∣rary,
as will appear in the sequell of this History.</P>
<P>Thus it is apparent upon what Terms the English stood with the
<HI>Narhagansets,</HI> ever since the cutting off <HI>Miantonimoh,</HI> their chief Sachems
head by <HI>Vncas,</HI> it being done from the advice and Counsell of the En∣glish
<HI>Anno</HI> 1643. As for the rest of the Indians, ever since the suppres∣sing
of the <HI>Pequods</HI> in the year 1637 untill the year 1675, there was
alwayes in▪ appearance amity and good correspondence on all sides,
scarce an English man was ever known▪ to be ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lted or hurt by any
of them, until after the year 1671, when the son of one <HI>Matoonas,</HI> who
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s was supposed, being vexed in his mind that the design against the En∣glish,
intended to begin 1671 did not take place, out of meer malice and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pight against them, slew an English-man travelling along the Road,
the said <HI>Matoonas</HI> being a <HI>Nipnet</HI> Indian, which <HI>Nipnets</HI> were under
the command of the Sachem of <HI>Mount-hope</HI> the Author of all the present
mischiefs. Upon a due enquiry into all preceding transactions between
the Indians and the English, from their first setling in these coasts, there
will appear no ground of quarrell that any of them had against the En∣glish,
nor any appearance of provocation upon one account or other;
for when <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony was first planted, within three moneths after
their first landing, <HI>March. 16. 1620. Massasoit</HI> the chief Sachem of all
that side of the Country repaired to the English at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and entred
into a solemn League upon sundry Articles printed in <HI>N. E. Memorial</HI>
166<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>P.</HI> 24. the words are as followeth.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THat neither he, nor any of his should injure or doe hurt to any of
their people.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That if any of his did any hurt to any of theirs, he should send the Of∣fender

<P>The which League the same Sachim, <HI>Sept.</HI> 25. 1630. a little before his
death, coming with his eldest Son, afterward called <HI>Alexander,</HI> did renew
with the English at the Court of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> for himself and his Son, and
their Hours and Successers: and after that he came to Mr. <HI>Browns,</HI> that
lived not far from <HI>Mount Hope,</HI> bringing his two Sons, <HI>Alexander</HI> and
<HI>Philip</HI> with him, desiring that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght be Love and Amitv after his
death, between his Sons and them, as there had been betwixt himself and
them in former times: yet it is very remarkable, that this <HI>Massasoit,</HI>
called also <HI>Woosamequen</HI> (how much soever he affected the English, yet)
was never in the least degree any wayes well affected to the Religion of
the English, but would in his last Treaty with his Neighbours at <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI>
when they were with him about purchasing some Land at <HI>Swanzy,</HI>
have had them engaged never to attempt to draw away any of his People
from their old Pag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Superstition, and Devilish Idolatry, to the Christian
Religion, and did much insist upon it till he saw the English were resolved
never to make any Treaty with him more upon that account, which when
he discerned, he did not further urge it: but that was a bad Omen that
notwithstanding what ever his humanity were to the English, as they
were Strangers) for indeed they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> repayed his forme kindness to
them, by protecting him afterwards against the insolencies of the <HI>Nar∣rhagansets</HI>)
he manifested no small displacency of Spirit against them as
they were Christians: which strain was evident more in his Son that
succeeded him, and all his People, in so much that some di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cerning persons
of that Jurisdiction have feared that that Nation of Indians would all be
rooted out, as is since come to pass. The like may be observed concern∣ing
he <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> who were alwayes more civil and courteous to
the English then any of the other Indians, yet never as yet received the
least tincture of Christian Religion, but have in a manner run the same
fare with the rest of their Neighbours of <HI>Mount Hope,</HI> there being very
few of them now left standing. Nor is it unworthy the Relation, what a
person of quality amongst us hath of late affirmed, one being much con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersant

invited by some Sagamores or Sachims to a great Dance (which solemni∣ties
are the times they make use of to tell their stories, and convey the
knowledge of fore past and most memorable things to Posterity) <HI>Passa∣conaway,</HI>
the great Sachim of that part of the Country, intending at that
time to make his last and farwel speech to his Children and People, that
were then all gathered together, to whom he addressed himself in this
manner:</P>
<P>I am now going the way of all Flesh, or ready to dy, and not likely to see you
ever met together any more. I will now leave this word of Counsel with you,
that you take heed how you quarrel with the English, for though you may do
them much mischief; yet assuredly you will all be destroyed, and rooted off the
Earth if you do: for, <HI>said he,</HI> I was as much an Enemy to the English, at
their first coming into these parts, as; any one whatsoever, and did try all ways
and means possible to have destroyed them, at least to have prevented them
fitting down here, but I could no way effect it (it is to be noted that this <HI>Pas∣s
conaway</HI> was the most noted <HI>Pawaw</HI> and <HI>Sorcerer</HI> of all the Country)
therefore I advise you never to contend with the English, nor make war with
them: And accordingly his eldest Son <HI>Wonnalancet</HI> by name, as soon as he
perceived that the Indians were up in Arms, he withdrew himself into some
remote place, that be might not be burt by the English, or the Enemies, or be in
danger by them.</P>
<P>This Passage was thought fit to be inserted here, it having so near an
agreement with the former, inmamtting some secret awe of God upon
the hearts of some of the principal amongst them, that they durst not
hurt the English, although they bare no good affection to their
Religion, wherein they seem not a little to imitate <HI>Balaam,</HI> who whate∣ver
he uttered, when he was under the awful power of divine illumina∣tion,
yet when left to himself, was as bad an Enemy to the Israel of
God as ever before.</P>
<P>But to return, whence there hath been this Digreffion:</P>
<P>After the death of this <HI>Woosamequen</HI> or <HI>Massasoit,</HI> his eldest Son
succeeded him about twenty years since, <HI>Alexander</HI> by name, who not∣withstanding
the League he had entred into with the English, together
with his Father, in the year 1639. had neither affection to the English∣mens
persons, nor yet to their Religion, but had been plotting with the
<HI>Narhagansets,</HI> to rise against the English; of which the Governour and
Council of <HI>Plimouth</HI> being informed, they presently sent for him to being
him to the Court, the person to whom that service was committed, was
a prudent and resolute Gentleman, the present Governour of the said
Colony, who was neither afraid of Danger, nor yet willing to delay in a
<PB N="10" REF="000231_0022_0FA9ABE1B1B138D0"/>
matter of that moment, he forthwith taking eight or ten stout men with
him well armed, intended to have gone to the said <HI>Alexanders</HI> dwelling,
distant at least forty miles from the Governours house, but by a good
providence, he found him whom he went to seek as an Hunting House,
within six miles of the English Towns, where the said <HI>Alexander</HI> with a∣bout
eighty men were newly come in from Hunting, and had left their
Guns without doors, which Major <HI>Winslow</HI> with his small company wise∣ly
seized, and conveyed away, and then went into the Wigwam, and de∣manded
<HI>Alexander</HI> to go along with him before the Governour, at which
message he was much appalld, but being told by the undaunted Messen∣ger,
that if he stird or refused to go he was a dead man; he was by one
of his chief Counsellors, in whose advice he most confided, perswaded to
go along to the Governours house, but such was the pride and height of
his Spirit, that the very surprizal of him, raised his Choler and indigna∣tion,
that it put him into a Feaver, which notwithstanding all possible
means that could be used, seemed Mortal; whereupon intreating those
that held him Prisoner, that he might have liberty to return home, pro∣mising
to return again if he recovered, and to send his Son as Hostage till
he could so do; on that consideration he was fairly dismissed, but dyed
before he got half way home: Here let it be observed, that although
some have taken up false Reports, as if the English had compelled him
to go further or faster then he was able, and so fell into a Feaver, or as if
he were not well used by the Physitian that looked to him, while he was
with the English, all which are notoriously false; nor is it to be imagined
that a person of so noble a disposition as is that Gentleman (at that
time imployed to bring him) should himself, or suffer any else to be un∣civil
to a person allied to them, by his own, as well as his Fathers League
as the said <HI>Philip</HI> also was; nor was any thing of that nature ever ob∣jected
to the English of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> by the said <HI>Alexanders Brother,</HI> by
name <HI>Philip,</HI> commonly for his ambitious and haughty Spirit nicknamed
<HI>King-Philip,</HI> when he came in the year 1662. in his own person with
<HI>Sansaman</HI> his Secretary and chief Counsellor to renew the former League
that had been between his Predecessors and the English of <HI>Plimouth:</HI> but
there was as much correspondence betwixt them for the next seven years
as ever had been in any former times, what can be imagined therefore,
besides the instigation of Satan, that either envied at the prosperity of
the Church of God here seated, or else fearing lest the power of the
Lord Jesus, that had overthrown his kingdome in other parts of the
World, should do the like here, and so the stone taken out of the Moun∣tain
without hands, should become a great Mountain it self, and fill the

once before this in the year 1671 the Devill, who was a Murderer from
the beginning, had so filled the heart of this salvage Miscreant with en∣vy
and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice against the English, that he was ready to break out into
open war against the Inhabitants of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> pretending some petite
injuryes done him in his planting land, but when the master of controver∣sie
came to be heard before diverse of the <HI>Massachusets Colony,</HI> yea when he
himself came to <HI>Boston,</HI> as it were referring his case to the Judgment of that
Colony, nothing of that nature could be made to appear, whereupon in
way of submission, he was of necessity by that evident conviction forced
to acknowledge that it was the naughtiness of his own heart, that put
him upon that Rebellion, and nothing of any provocation from the En∣glish,
and to a Consession of this nature, with a solemn renewal of his
Covenant, declaring his desire, that this his Covenant might testifie to

between <HI>Philip</HI> and them; was obtained and made (principally) by the

<LETTER><P>I think I can clearly say that before these present troubles
broke out, the English did not possess one foot of Land in this Colony, but what
was fairly obtained by honest purchase of the Indian Proprietors: Nay, be∣cause
some of our people are of a covetom disposition and the Indians are in
their Streights easily prevaited with to part with their Lands, we first made
a Land, that none should purchase or receive of gift any Land of the Indians
without the knowledge and allowance of our Court, and penalty of a Fine,
five pound per Acre, for all that should be so bought or obtained. And le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
yet they should be streightned, we Ordered that <HI>Mount-Hope, Pocasset</HI> and se∣veral
other Nicks of the best land in the Colony (because most suitable and con∣venient
for them, should never be bought out of their bands or else they would
have sold them long since. And our neighbours at <HI>Rehoboth</HI> and <HI>Swanzy</HI>
although they bought their Lands fairly of this <HI>Philip</HI> and his Father and
Brother, yet because of their vicinity, that they might not trespass upon the
Indians did at their own cost set up a very substantial Fence quite cross that
great Neck between the English and the Indians, and payed due damage if at
any time any unruly horse or other beasts brake in and trespassed. And for
diverse years last past (that alloccasion of offence in that respect might be
prevented) the English agreed with <HI>Philip</HI> and his, for a certain sum yearly
to maintain the said Fence, and secure them selves. And if at any time they
have brought Complaints before us, they have had Iustice impartial and spee∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y,
so that our own people have frequently complained, that we erred on the

<P>Yet did this treacherous and perfidious Caitiffe still harbour the same
or more mischievous thoughts against the English then ever before, and
hath been since that time plotting with all the Indians round about to
make a general insurrection against the English in all the Colonyes;
which as some prisoners lately brought in have confessed, should have
been put in execution at once, by all the Indians rising as one man, a∣gainst
all those plantations of English, which were nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them. The <HI>Nar∣rhagansets</HI>
having promised, as was confessed to risewith 4 thousand sigh∣ting
men in the Spring of this present year, 1676. But by the occasion
hereafter to be mentioned about <HI>Sausaman, Philip</HI> was necc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssitated for
<PB N="14" REF="000231_0026_0FA9ABE9489BBC40"/>
the safety of his own life to begin his Rebellion the year before, when the
Design was not fully ripe. Yet some are ready to think, that if his own
life had not now been in jeopardy by the guilt of the foresaid Murther
of <HI>Sausaman,</HI> his heart might have failed him, when it should have come
to be put in execution, as it did before in the year 1671. which made one
of his Captains, of far better Courage and resolution then himself, when
he saw his cowardly temper and disposition, fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g down his Armes, call∣ing
him <HI>white Liver'd Curre,</HI> or to that purpose, and saying, that he
would never own him again, or fight under him, and from that time
hath turned to the English, and bath continued to this day a faithfull and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esolute Souldier in their quarrel.</P>
<P>That the Indians had a Conspiracy amongst themselves to rise against
the English, is confirmed by some of the Indians about <HI>Hadly,</HI> although
the plot was not come to maturity when <HI>Philip</HI> began, the special pro∣vidence
of God therein overruling the Contrivers: For when the be∣ginning
of the troubles first was reported from <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> many of
the Indians were in a kind of a Maze, not knowing well what to doe;
sometimes ready to stand for the English, as formerly they had been
wont to doe; sometimes inclining to strike in with <HI>Philip</HI> (which at the
last they generally did) which if it had been foreseen, much of that mis∣chief
might have been prevented that fell out in several places, more by
perfidious and treacherous dealing then any other wayes: the English
never imagining that after so many obliging kindnesses received from
them by the Indians, besides their many engagements and protestati∣tions
of friendship, as formerly, they would have been so ungratefull,
persideously false and cruel as they have since proved.</P>
<P>The occasion of <HI>Philips</HI> so sudden taking up armes the last year was
this, There was one <HI>Iohn Sausaman</HI> a very cunning and plausible Indian
well skilled in the English language, and bred up in the profession of
Christian Religion, imployed as a Schoolmaster at <HI>Natick,</HI> the Indian
Town, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon some misdemeanour fled from his place to <HI>Philip,</HI> by
whom he was entertained in the room and office of a Secretary, and his
chief Counsellor, whome he trusted with all his affairs and secret coun∣sels:
But afterwards, whither upon the sting of his own Conscience;
or by the frequent Sollicitations of Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> that had known him from
a childe, and instructed him in the principles of our Religion, who was
often laying before him the heinous sin of his apostacy, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urning
back to his old vomit, he was at last prevailed with to for sake <HI>Philip,</HI>
and return back to the Christian Indians at <HI>Natick,</HI> where he was
haptized, manifesting publick Repentance for all his former offences,
<PB N="15" REF="000231_0027_0FA9ABE9F1728220"/>
and made a serious Prosession of the Christian Religion: and did apply
himself to Preach to the Indians, wherein he was better gifted then any
other of the Indian Nation; so as he was observed to conforme more
to the English manners then any other Indian: yet having occasion to
go up with some others of his Country-men to Namasket; whither for
the advantage of Fishing, or some such occasion, it matters not; being
there not far from <HI>Philips Country,</HI> he had occasion to be much in the
Company of <HI>Philips Indians,</HI> and of <HI>Philip</HI> himself: by which means he
discerned by several circumstances, that the Indians were plotting
anew against us; the which out of faithfulness to the <HI>English,</HI> the said
<HI>Sausaman</HI> informed the Governour of, adding also, that if it were
known that he revealed it, he knew they would presently kill him.
There appearing so many concurrent testimonies from others, making
it the more probable, that there was a certain truth in the information,
some inquiry was made into the business, by examining <HI>Philip</HI> himself, &amp;
several of his Indians, who although they would own nothing; yet could
not free themselves from just suspicion; <HI>Philip</HI> therefore soon after con∣trived
the said <HI>Sausamans</HI> death, which was strangely discovered; not∣withstanding
it was so cunningly effected, for they that murdered him
met him upon the Ice on a great Pond, and presently after they had
knocked him down, put him under the Ice, yet leaving his Gun and his
Hat upon the Ice, that it might be thought he fell in accidentally through
the Ice and was drowned: but being missed by his friends, who finding
his Hat and his Gun, they were thereby led to the place, where his body
was found under the Ice: when they took him up to bury him, some of
his friends, specially one <HI>David</HI> observed some bruises about his Head,
which made them suspect he was first knocked down, before he was put
into the water, however, they buried him near about the place where
he was found, without making any further inquiry at present: never∣theless
<HI>David</HI> his friend, reported these things to some English at Taun∣ton
(a Town not far from <HI>Namasket)</HI> it occasioned the Governour to
inquire further into the business, wisely considering, that as <HI>Sansaman</HI>
had told him, that if it were known, that he had revealed any of their
plots, they would murder him for his pains: wherefore by special War∣rant
the body of <HI>Sansaman</HI> being digged again out of his Grave, it was
very apparent that he had been killed and not drowned. And by a
strange providence, an Indian was found, that by accident standing un∣seen
upon a Hill, had seen them murdering the said <HI>Sansaman,</HI> but dirst
never reveal it for fear of losing his own life likewise, until he was called
to the Court at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> or before the Governour, where he plainly
<PB N="16" REF="000231_0028_0FA9ABEAD1EB8E10"/>
confessed what he had seen. The Murderers being apprehended, were
convicted by his undeniub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Testimony, and other remarkable cirum∣stances,
and so were all put to death, being but three in number; the last
of them confessed immediately before his death, that his Father (one of
the Councellers and special Friends of <HI>Philip)</HI> was one of the two that
murdered <HI>Sansaman,</HI> himself only looking on. This was done at <HI>Pli∣mouth
Court.</HI> held in <HI>Iune</HI> 1675. insomuch that <HI>Philip,</HI> apprehending the
danger his own head was in next, never used any further means to clear
himself from what was like to be laid to his charge, either about his plot∣ting
against the English, nor yet about <HI>Sansamans</HI> death: but by keeping
his men continually about him in Arms, and gathering what Strangers
he could to joyn with him, marching up and down constantly in Arms,
both all the while the Court sat, as well as afterwards; the English of
<HI>Plimouth</HI> hearing of all this, yet took no further notice, then only to
order a Military Watch in all the adjacent Towns, hoping that <HI>Philip</HI> find∣ing
himself not likely to be Arraigned by Order of the said Court, the
present Cloud might blow over, as some others of like nature had done
before; but in conclusion, the matter proved otherwise, for <HI>Philip</HI> find∣ing
his Strength daily increasing, by the flocking of Neighbour Indians
unto him, and sending over their Wives and Children to the <HI>Narhagan∣sets</HI>
for security (as they use to do when they intend War with any of
their Enemies) Immediately they began to Alarm the English at <HI>Swanzy</HI>
(the next Town to <HI>Philips</HI> Country) as it were daring the English to be∣gin,
at last their insolencies grew to such an height, that they began not
only to use threatning words to the English, but also to kill their Cattle
and rifle their houses; whereat an English man was so provoked, that
he let fly a Gun at an Indian, but did only wound, not kill him, where∣upon
the Indians immediately began to kill all the <HI>English</HI> they could, so
as on the 24th. of <HI>Iune</HI> 1675. was the Alarm of war first f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unded in
<HI>Plimouth Colony,</HI> when eight or nine of the <HI>English</HI> were slun in and a∣bout
<HI>Swanzy:</HI> They first making a shot at a company of <HI>English</HI> as they
returned from the Assembly where they were met in way of Humiliati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
that day, whereby they killed one and wounded others, and then like∣wise
at the same time, they slew two Men on the High-way, sent to call a
Surgeon, and barbarously the same day murdered six men in and about a
dwelling House in an other part of the Town, all which outrages were
committed so suddenly, that the <HI>English</HI> had no time to make any resist∣ance:
For on the 14th. of the same Month, besides endeavours used
by Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> of <HI>Swanzy</HI> one of the <HI>Magistrates</HI> of <HI>Plimouth</HI> Jurisdi∣ction,
an amicable Letter was sent from the Council of <HI>Plimouth</HI> to <HI>Philip</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="000231_0029_0FA9ABEB735E19C8"/>
shewing their dislike of his prastises, and advising him to dismiss his
strange Indians, and not suffer himself to be abused by false Reports, con∣cerning
them that intended him no hurt, but no answer could be obtain∣ed,
otherwise then threatning of War, which it was hoped might have
been prevented, as heretofore it had been, when things seemed to look
with as bad face as then they did. However the Governour and Coun∣cil
of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> understanding that <HI>Philip</HI> continued in his resolution, &amp;
manifested no inclination to peace, they immediately sent up what Forces
they could to secure the Towns thereabouts, and make resistance as oc∣casion
might be, and also dispatched away Messengers to the <HI>Massa∣chusets</HI>
Governour and Council, letting them know the state of things
about <HI>Mount-Hope:</HI> and desiring their speedy assistance: upon which
care was immediately taken with all expedition to send such supplye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as were defired: But in the mean time two Messengers were dispatched
to <HI>Philip,</HI> to try whether he could not be diverted from his bloudy en∣terprize.
so to have prevented the mischief since fallen out, hoping, that
as o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce before, <HI>viz. Anno</HI> 1671. by their mediation, a stop was put
to the like Tragedy; so the present warre might by the same meanes
have been now turned aside: For in the said year <HI>Philip</HI> had firmly
engaged himself, when he was at <HI>Boston,</HI> not to quarrel with <HI>Plimouth</HI>
untill he had first addressed himself to the <HI>Massachusets</HI> for advice and
approhation: But the two Messengers aforesaid, finding the men slain
in the Roade <HI>Iune</HI> 24. as they were going for the Surgeon, apprehended
it no safe to proceed any further, considering also, that a peace now
could not honourably be concluded after such barbarous outrages
committed upon some of the neighbour Colony: Wherefore
returning with all speed to <HI>Boston,</HI> the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Forces were dispatch∣ed
away with all immaginable hast, as the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gent of the matter did re∣quire,
some of them being then upon, or ready for their March, the rest
were ordered to follow after, as they could be raised. The sending
forth of which, because it was the first engagement in any warlike pre∣parations
against the Indians, shall be more particularly declared.</P>
<P>On the 26th. of <HI>Iune</HI> a Foot-Company under Capt. <HI>Dani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Henchman,</HI>
with a Troop under Capt. <HI>Thomas Prentice,</HI> were sent out of <HI>Boston</HI> to∣ward
<HI>Mount-Hope;</HI> it being late in the afternoon before they began to
march, the central Echpse of the Moon in <HI>Capric.</HI> hapned in the even∣ing
before they came up to <HI>Naponset River,</HI> about twenty miles from
<HI>Boston,</HI> which occasioned them to make an halt, for a little repast, till
the moon recovered her light again. Some melancholy Fancyes would
not be perswaded, but that the Eclipse falling out at that instant of time,
<PB N="18" REF="000231_0030_0FA9ABEC4DA0C118"/>
was ominous, concriving also that in the centre of the Moon they dis∣cerned
an unusual black spot, not a little resembling the scalp of an <HI>In∣dian:</HI>
As some others not long before, imagined they saw the form of
an <HI>Indian Bow,</HI> accounting that likewise ominous (although the mis∣chief
following was done by Guns, not by Bows) both the one and the
other, might rather have thought of what <HI>Marcus Crassus</HI> the <HI>Koman
General,</HI> going forth with an Army against the <HI>Parthians,</HI> once wisely
replied to a private Souldier, that would have disswaded him from mar∣ching
that time, because of an Eclpse of the Moon in <HI>Capricorn [That
he was more afraid of Sagitarius then of Capricornus]</HI> meaning the Ar∣rows
of the <HI>Parthians</HI> (accounted very good Archers) from whom
as things then fell out, was his greatest danger. But after the Moon
had waded through the dark shadow of the Earth, and borrowed her
Light again, by the help thereof, the two Companies marched on to∣ward
<HI>Woodcocks</HI> House, thirty miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> where they arrived next
morning; and there retarded their motion till the afternoon, in hope of
being overtaken by a Company of <HI>Volunteers,</HI> under the Command of
Captain <HI>Samuel Mosely,</HI> which accordingly came to pass, as on <HI>Iune</HI>
28th. they all arrived at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> where by the advice of Captain <HI>Cu∣worth,</HI>
the Commander in chief of <HI>Plimouth Forces,</HI> they were removed
to the Head Quarters, which for that time were appointed at Mr. <HI>Miles</HI>
his house, the Minister of <HI>Swanzy,</HI> within a quarter of a mile of the
Bridge, leading into <HI>Philips Lands.</HI> They arriving there some little
time before night, twelve of the Troop unwilling to loose time passed
over the Bridge, for discovery into the Enemies Territories, where they
found the rude welcome of eight or ten Indians firing upon them out of
the Bushes, killing one <HI>William Hammond,</HI> wounding Corporal <HI>Belcher,</HI>
his Horse being also shot down under him; the rest of the sard Tropers
having discharged upon those <HI>Indians</HI> that ran away after their first
shot, carried off their two dead and wounded Companions, and so reti∣red
to the main Guard for the night, pitc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in a Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icado about Mr.
<HI>Miles</HI> his house. The Enemy thought to have braved it out by a bold
assauld or two at the first; but their hearts soon began to fail them when
they perceived the <HI>Massachusets, &amp; Plimouth Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> both engaged against

Bridge: our Horsemen with the whole body of the Privateers under
Captain <HI>Mosely,</HI> not at all daunted by such kind of Alarms, nor willing
so to loose the Bridge, ran <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down upon them over the said

<HI>Savage,</HI> that young Martial Spark, scarce twenty years of age, had at
that time one bullet lodged in his Thigh, another shot through the br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<SUP>s</SUP>
of his Hat, by ten or twelve of the Enemy discharging upon him toge∣ther,
while he boldly held up his Colours, in the Front of his Company:
but the weather nor suffering any further action at that time, those that
were thus far advanced, were compelled to retreat back to the main
Guard, having first made a shot upon the <HI>Indians</HI> as they ran away into
a Swamp nearby, whereby they killed five or six of them, as was under∣stood
soon after at <HI>Narhaganset:</HI> This resolute charge of the <HI>English</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces upon the Enemy made them quit their place on <HI>Mount-Hope</HI> that
very night, where <HI>Philip</HI> was never seen after; till the next year, when
he was by a divine Mandate sent back: there to receive the reward of his
wickedness where he first began his mischief: the next day Major <HI>Savage</HI>
(that was to command in chief over the <HI>Massachnset Forces,</HI> being come
up with other Supplies about six a clock over night) the whole Body in∣tended
to march into <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> and there beat up the Enemys quar∣ters,
or give him Battle, if he durst abide it: but the weather being
doubtful, our Forces did not march till near noon, about which time
they set out, with a Troop of Horse in each wing, to prevent the danger
of the Enemies Ambuscadoes; after they had marched about a mile &amp;
and half, they passed by some Houses newly burned: not far of one of
them they found a Bible newly torn, and the leaves scattered about by
the Enemy, in hatred of our Religion therein revealed, two or three
miles further they came up with some Heads, Scalps, and Hands cut off
from the bodys of some of the English, and stuck upon Poles near the
Highway, in that barbarous and inhumane manner bidding us Defyance,
the Commander in chief giving Order that those monuments of the E∣nemies
cruelty should be taken down, and buried: the whole body of
the Forces still marched on, two miles further, where they found divers
Wigwams of the Enemy, amongst which were many things scattered up
and down, arguing the hasty fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght of the Owners; half a mile further,
as they passed on through m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Fields of stately Corn, they fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Phi∣lips</HI>
own W gvam; every place giving them to perceive the Enemies
ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty departure from thence; after they had marched two miles further
they came to the Sea sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, yet in all this time meeting with no Indians,
nor any sign of them, unless of their flight to some other places. The
season like to prove very tempestuous, and rainy, Captain <HI>Cudworth</HI>
with some of the men of <HI>Plimouth</HI> passed over to <HI>Road-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stand.</HI> The
Forces under Major <HI>Savage</HI> were forced to abide all night in the open
Field, without any shelter, notwithstanding the abundance of rain that
<PB N="20" REF="000231_0032_0FA9ABEF66D018A0"/>
fell, and in the morning, despairing to meet with any enemy on <HI>Mount∣Hope,</HI>
they retreated back to their Quarters at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> in the way
meeting with many Indian dogs, that seemed to have lost their Masters.
That night Capt. <HI>Prentice</HI> his Troop for convenie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy of Quarters, as
also for discovery, was dismissed to lodge at <HI>Seaconke</HI> or <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> a
Town within six miles of <HI>Swanzy.</HI> As they returned back in the mor∣ning,
Capt. <HI>Prentice</HI> divided his Troop, delivering one half to Leiutenant
<HI>Oak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and keeping the other himself, who as they rode along, espyed a
company of Indians burning an house; but could not pursue them by
reason of several Fences, that they could not g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e over till the Indians
had escaped i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to a Swampe. Those with Leiutenant <HI>Oakes</HI> had the like
discovery, but with better success, as to the advantage of the ground,
so as pursuing of them upon a plain, they slew four or five of them in the
Chase, whereof one was known to be <HI>Thebe</HI> a Sachem of <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI>
another of them was a chief Counsellor of <HI>Philips;</HI> yet in this attempt
the Lieutenant lost one of his company, <HI>Iohn Druce</HI> by name, who was
mortally wounded in his bowels, whereof he soon after dyed, to the
great grief of his companions. After the said Troop came up to the
Head-Quarters at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> they understood from Capt. <HI>Cudworth</HI> that
the enemy were discovered upon <HI>Pocass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> an other neck of Land lying
over an arme of the Sea, more towards <HI>Cape Cod:</HI> However it was
resolved that a more narrow search should be made after them, both
upon <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> and upon the ground between <HI>Swanzy</HI> and <HI>Rehoboth</HI>
to scoure the Swamps, and assault them if they could find where they
were entrenched. Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> and Capt. <HI>Preentice</HI> were ordered to
search the Swamps; while Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI> and Capt. <HI>Paige</HI> with his Dra∣goons
attending on Major <HI>Savage,</HI> should return back into <HI>Mount hope</HI>
that they might be sure to leave none of the enemy behind them, when
they should remove to pursue them elsewhere.</P>
<P>About ten a clock the next morning, <HI>Iuly.</HI> 4. Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> after
a long and tedious March, came to the Head Quarters, and informed
that he came upon a place where the enemy had newly been that night,
but were escaped out of his reach: But that night before they were de∣termined
of any other motion, Capt. <HI>Hutchinson</HI> came up from <HI>Boston</HI>
with new Orders for them to pass into <HI>Narrhaganset,</HI> to treat with the
Sachems there, and if it might be, to prevent their joyning with <HI>Philip.</HI>
Capt. <HI>Cudworth,</HI> by this time was come up to the Head Quarters, having
left a Garison of fourty men upon <HI>Mount-Hope</HI> Neck. The next mor∣ning
was spent in consultations how to carry on the Treaty; it was then
resolved, that they should goe to make a peace with a Sword in their
<PB N="21" REF="000231_0033_0FA9ABEF84CBA170"/>
hands, having no smal ground of suspition that the said <HI>Narhagansets</HI> might
joyn with the enemy wherefore, they thought it necessary to carry all
the <HI>Messachuset</HI> Forces over into the <HI>Narhaganset</HI> Country, to fight
them if there should be need; Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI> passed over by water
to attend Capt. <HI>Hutchinson</HI> in his dispatch; the other Companys with
the Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iding round about: as they passed they found the Indi∣dians
in <HI>Pomhams</HI> Country (next adjoyning to <HI>Philips</HI> Borders) all fled,
and their Wigwams without any people in them.</P>
<P>After they came to the <HI>Narhaganset</HI> Sachems, three or four dayes
were spent in a trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, after which a peace was concluded on sundry Arti∣cles
between the Messengers of <HI>Connicticut</HI> Colony (who were ordered
to meet with those of the <HI>Massachusets</HI>) and the Commanders of the
Forces sent against <HI>Philip:</HI> Hostages were also given by the said <HI>Nar∣hagansets</HI>
for the performance of the agreement. A Copy of the said
Agreement, and the Articles on which a Peace was concluded, here fol∣low.

Captain <HI>Fuller</HI> taking down toward the Sea-side, where it seems
after some little skirmishing with them, wherein one man only received
a small Wound, he either saw or heard too many Indians for himself and
his Company to deal with, which m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de him and them betake themselves
to an House near the Water-side, from whence they were fetched off by
a Sloop before night to <HI>Road Island.</HI> Captain <HI>Church</HI> (for so may he
well be stiled after this time) marched further into the Neck, imag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning
that if there were Indians in the Neck, they should finde them about a
peas-field not farr off: as soon as ever they came near the said field
he espyed two Indians in the pease, who also had at the same time espyed
him, and presently making some kind of shout, a great number of Indi∣ans
came about the field, pursuing the said Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and his men
in great numbers to the sea side: there being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> above fifteen with
<HI>Church,</HI> yet seven or eight score of the Indians pursuing after them. Now
was a fit time for this young Captain and his small Company to handsel
their valour upon this great rout of Indians, just ready to devo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them:
But victory stands no more in the number of Soulders, then Verity in
the plurality of voyces: And although some of these fifteen had scarce
courage enough for themselves, yet their Captain had enough for him∣self,
and some to spare for his friends, which he there had an opportuni∣ty
of improving to the full. When he saw the hearts of any of his fol∣lowers
to fail, he would bid them be of good Courage and fight stout∣ly,
and (possibly by some divine impression upon his heart) assured them
not a bullet of the enemy should hurt any one of them; which one of the
Company, more dismayed then the rest, could hardly believe, till he
saw the proof of it in his own person, for the Captain perceiving the man
was not able to fight, made him gather Rocks together for a kind of
shelter and Baricado: for the rest, that must either of necessity fight or
fall by the enemyes. It chanced as this faint-hearted souldier had a flat
stone in his armes, and was carying it to the shelter that he was making
<PB N="25" REF="000231_0037_0FA9ABF24FF72880"/>
upon the Bank, a bullet of the Enemy was thus warded from his Body
by which he must else have perished, which experience put new life into
him, so as he followed his business very ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fully afterward, insomuch
that they defended themselves under small defence hastily made up all
that afternoon, not one being either sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in or wounded, yet it was cer∣tainly
known that they killed at least fifteen of their Enemies: and at the
last, when they had spent all their Amunition, and made their Guns un∣serviceable
by often fiting, they were fetched all off by Capt. <HI>Goldings</HI>
Sloop, and carried safe to <HI>Road-Island</HI> in despight of all their Enemies;
yea, such was the bold and undaunted courage of this Champion Capt.
<HI>Church,</HI> that he was not willing to leave any token behind of their flying
for want of courage, that in the face of his Enemies he went back to
fetch his Hat, which he had left at a Spring, whether the extream heat
of the weather, and his labou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in fighting had caused him to re∣pair
for the quenching of his thirst an hour or two before. It seems
in the former part of the same day, five men coming from <HI>Road-Island,</HI>
to look up their Cattle upon <HI>Pocasset Neck,</HI> were assaulted by the same
<HI>Indians,</HI> and one of the five was Capt. <HI>Churches</HI> Servant, who had his
Leg broke in the Skirmish, the rest hardly escaping with their lives: this
was the first time that ever any mischief was done by the <HI>Indians</HI> upon
<HI>Pocasset Neck.</HI> Those of <HI>Road-Island</HI> were hereby Alarmed to look to
themselves, as well as the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the English of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> or the <HI>Massa∣ehusets
Colony.</HI></P>
<P>This Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ult rather heightened and increased then daunted the courage
of Capt. <HI>Church;</HI> for not making a cowardly flight, but a fair retreat,
which providence offered him by the Sloop aforesaid, after his Amunition
was spent, he did not stay long at <HI>Road Island,</HI> but hasted over to the
<HI>Mattachuset Forces,</HI> and borrowing three files of Men of Capt. <HI>Hench∣man</HI>
with his Lieutenant: Mr. <HI>Church</HI> and he returned again to <HI>Pocasset,</HI>
where they had another skirmish with the Enemy, wherein some few of
them fourteen or fifteen were slain, which struck such a terror into <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI>
that he be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook himself to the Swamps about <HI>Pocasset,</HI> where he lay
hid till the return of the rest of the Forces from the <HI>Narhagansets,</HI> like a
wild Boar kept at a Bay by this small party till more hands came up.</P>
<P>Thus were the <HI>Plimouth Forces</HI> busied, during the time of the Treaty
with the <HI>Narhagansets,</HI> which being issued as it was.</P>
<P>On Friday <HI>Iuly</HI> 15. Our Forces Marched for, and araived at <HI>Rekoboth</HI>
where having no intelligence of the Enemy nearer then a great Swamp
on <HI>Pocasset,</HI> eighteen miles from <HI>Taunton;</HI> they marched next day twelve
miles to an House at <HI>Matapoiset</HI> (a small Neck of Land in the bottome
<PB N="26" REF="000231_0038_0FA9ABF5B1AFE8E0"/>
of <HI>Taunton Bay,</HI> in the mid-way between <HI>Mount-hope</HI> and <HI>Pocasset Neck)</HI>
from whence they marched for <HI>Taunton. Iuly</HI> 17. whither after a te∣dious
March of twenty miles they came in the evening, and found the
People generally gathered into eight Garison Houses:</P>
<P>On Monday <HI>Iuly</HI> 18. they Marched eighteen miles before they could
reach the Swamp where the Enemy was lodged, as soon as ever they
came to the place, <HI>Plimouth Forces</HI> being now joyned with them, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Souldiers resolutely entred in amongst the Enemes, who took the ad∣vantage
of the thick under-wood, to make a shot at them that first entred
whereby five were killed outright, seven more wounded, some of whose
wounds proved mortal: After the first shot, the Enemy presently reti∣red
deeper into the Swamp, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serting their W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gwams (about an hundred
in all) newly made of green Barks, so as they would not burn: in one
of them they found an old man, who confessed that <HI>Philip</HI> had been
lately there; having spent some time in searching the Swamp, and tired
themselves to no purpose, yet it was said one half hour more would have
at that time utterly subdued <HI>Philip</HI> and all his power. The Commander
in chief, (night drawing on apace) not thinking it safe to tarry longer
in so dangerous a place, (where every one was in as much danger of his
fellows as of his foes, being ready to fire upon every Bush they see move
(supposing <HI>Indians</HI> were there) ordered a Retreat to be founded, that
they m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght have time to dispose of their dead and wounded men, which
accordingly was attended: <HI>Plimouth Forces</HI> who had entred in the rear,
retreating in the front. It was judged that the Enemy being by this
means brought into a Pound, it would be no hard matter to deal with
them, and that it would be needless charge to keep so many Companies
of Souldiers together to wait upon such an inconsiderable Enemy, now
almost as good as taken: whereupon most of the Companies belong∣ing
to the <HI>Massachusets</HI> were drawn off▪ only Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> with an

the enemy, which by them were soon after turned into ashes. But to
return to king <HI>Philip,</HI> who was now lodged in the great swampe upon
<HI>Pocasset Neck,</HI> of seven miles long: Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> and the <HI>Plimouth</HI>
Forces kept a diligent eye upon the enemy, but were not willing to run
into the mire and dirt after them in a dark Swamp being taught by late
experience how dangerous it is to fight in such dismal Woods, when
their eyes were muffled with the leaves, and their heads pinnioned with
the thick boughs of the trees, as their feet were continually shackled
with the roots spreading every way in those boggy Woods. It is ill
fighting with a wilde Beast in his own den. They resolved therefore to
starve them out of the Swamp, where they knew full well they could
not long subsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t: To that end they began to build a Fort, as it were to
beleaguer the enemy, and prevent his escape out of the place, where they
thought they had him fast enough. <HI>Philip</HI> in the mean time was not ig∣norant
of what was doing without, and was ready therein to read his
own doome. so as if he tarryed much longer there, he knew he should
fall into their hands from whom he could expect no mercy: The c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se
being therefore desperate, he resolved with an hundred or two of his
best fighting men to make an escape by the Water, all passages by the land
being sufficiently guarded by the English Forces. The Swampe where
they were lodged be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g not far from an arm of the Sea, coming up to
<HI>Taunton,</HI> they taking the advantage of a low tide, either wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed over
one night in the end of <HI>Iuly,</HI> or else wafted themselves over upon small
R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes of timber very early before break of day, by which meanes the
greatest part of his Company escaped away into the woods, leading in∣to

that lay encamped on the other side of the Swamp. About an hundred

themselves to the mercy of the English. <HI>Philips</HI> escape thus from <HI>Po∣cass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI>

who as soon as he could get over with six files of men (rowing hard
all or most part of the day to get to <HI>Providence</HI>) followed after the enemy.
<PB N="28" REF="000231_0040_0FA9ABFA11E0C458"/>
The <HI>Mohegins</HI> with the men of <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> and some of <HI>Providence</HI> came

<HI>Henchman</HI> came not up to them (pursuing them only by the Track) till
the Skirmish was over, and having marched twenty two miles that day
was not well able to go any further that night; on the other hand, the
Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces that came from <HI>Rehoboth</HI> and that belonged to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> having
left their horses three miles off could not goe back to fetch them with∣out
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of time, and therefore looking at it altogether bootless to
go after them in the morning, returned back the next day, leaving Capt
<HI>Henchman</HI> with his six Files, and the <HI>Mohegins</HI> to pursue the Chase
to <HI>Nips<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tchet,</HI> which he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the next morning. Capt. <HI>Henchman,</HI> that
he might the better engage the <HI>Mohegins</HI> to march with him thirty miles
gave them half his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovision, and was himse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f recruited again by the
care of Capt. <HI>Edmunds</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> &amp; Leiutenant <HI>Brown,</HI> who brought
provision after him to the <HI>Nipmuck</HI> Forts. Mr. <HI>Newman</HI> the Mini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter
of <HI>Rehoboth</HI> deserved not a little Commendation for exciting his neigh∣bours
and friends to pursue thus far after <HI>Philip▪</HI> animating of them by
his own example and presence: But w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at the reason was why <HI>Philip</HI>
was followed no further, it is better to suspend, then too critically to en∣quire.
This is now the third time when a good opportunity of sup∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essing
the Rebelion of the Indians, was put into the hands of the En∣glish;
but time and chance hapneth to all men, so that the most likely
meanes are often frustrated of their desired end. All humane endeavours
shall arive at no other success, then the Counsel of God hath preordain∣ed,
that no flesh might glory in their own Wisdome, but give unto God
the praise of all their Successes, and quietly bear whatever Miscariages he
hath ordered to befall them. It appears by the issue of these things, that
although this wound was not incurable, yet much more bloud must be
taken away before it could be healed. But by this means <HI>Philip</HI> escaped
away to the Westward, kindling the flame of Warre in all the Western
plantations of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony wherever he came, so that by
this fatal accident, the fire that was in a likely way to be extinguished, as
soon almost as it began, did on the sudden break out through the whole
Jurisdiction of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> both Eastward and Westward, endan∣gering
also the neighbour Colony of <HI>Connecticut.</HI> Which hath also suf∣fered
somewhat by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury of this Flame, though not considerable to
what the other Colonyes have undergone.</P>
<P>While things after this manner proceeded in and about the Colony
of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> the Commissioners of the rest of the Colonyes were con∣sulting
<PB N="29" REF="000231_0041_0FA9ABFA83446D00"/>
and advising what was to be done for preventing the mischief
threatned from spreading any further, fearing (as indeed there was too
much cause) that although <HI>Philip</HI> only appeared to make the first attempt
yet more either already were, or soon might be be perswaded to joyn
with him in acting this b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oudy Tragedy.</P>
<P>It hath been already declared what hath been done for the securing
of the <HI>Narhagansets;</HI> those that were sent as Messengers on that errand,
alwayes reported that the elder people were in appearance, not only in∣clinable
to peace, but seemed very desirous thereof, insomuch as their two
eldest Sachems expressed much joy when it was concluded; but as since
hath appeared, all this was but to gain time, and cover their treache∣rous
intents and purposes, that they might in the next Spring fall upon
the English plantations all at once, as some prisoners lately brought in
have owned and confessed; not have any of those Indians with whom
the present War hath been, ever regarded any agreements of peace made
with the English, further then out of necessity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lavish fear they were
compelled thereunto, as may be seen by the Records of the united Colo∣nyes
from the year 1643 to the present time, notwithstanding all their
fair pretences; for <HI>Ninigret,</HI> the old Sachem of the <HI>Narhagansets,</HI> who
alone of all the rest of that Country Sachems disowned the present war,
and refused to have any hand therein, yet was it proved to his face be∣be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore
the Commissioners, in the years 1646 and 1647, that he had
threatned they would carry on the war against the <HI>Mohegins,</HI> whatever
were the mind of the Commissioners, and that they would kill the En∣glish
Cattle, and heap them up as high as their Wigwams, and that an
English man should not stir out of his doors to piss, but they would kill
him; all which he could not deny; yet did this old Fox make many pro∣mises
of peace; when the dread of the English ever since the <HI>Pequod-war</HI>
moved him thereunto; foreseeing as he is said to have told his neigh∣bours,
that they would all be ruined if they made War with the <HI>English,</HI>
as is since come to pass. However the good hand of God was seen in
so ordering things, that the <HI>Narhagansets</HI> were for the present restrain∣ed
from breaking out into open Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y against the <HI>English,</HI> at that time
when <HI>Philip</HI> began▪ which if they had then done, according to the eye of
reason, it would have been very difficult, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possible for the <HI>English</HI> to
have saved any of their inland plantations from being utterly destroyed.
Thus hath God in his Wisdome suffered so much of the rage of the Hea∣then
to be let loose against his people here, as to become a Scourge unto
them, that by the wrath of men, praise might be yeilded to his holy
Name, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t hath he in his abundant goodness restrained the remainder

to some <HI>Indian Plantations</HI> up <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack River,</HI> as high as <HI>Penny-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook;</HI>
but they found no <HI>Indians</HI> there; thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that belonged to the pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce ha∣ving

the Sachim of that Country had so resolved. That Coast being clear of
the Enemies, Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI> soon after was sent up with his Men to the
Towns Westward about <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly,</HI> if it might be, to subdue the Enemy,

<P>But to return and pursue the Rebellious Indians, and keep pace with
them in our History, though our Forces as yet could never overtake
them in the Woods. The Governour and Council of the Mass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chusets
were sensible of as much danger from the <HI>Nipnet Indians,</HI> as from the
former: they being the Inland part of the Country betwixt the Sea∣coast
and <HI>Connecticut River</HI> Westward, and the Towns about the <HI>Mas∣sachusets
Bay</HI> Eastward, whereupon some persons that used to Trade
with the said <HI>Nipnets,</HI> were sent to found them, and find how they stood
affected, for which also there was the more reason, because they were
alwayes in subject on to the Sachim of <HI>Mount-Hop;</HI> and so w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the
mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e like to engage in the present quarrel; of which there had been
sufficient proof already: when on the 14. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> some of the <HI>Nipnet
Indians</HI> next bordering on <HI>Philips Country,</HI> set upon some of <HI>Mendham</HI>
(a Town scituate Northward from <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> within 36. Miles from
<HI>Boston,</HI>) where they killed four or five persons which was the first mis∣chief
done upon any of the Inhabitants within the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Mas∣sachusets,</HI>
acted as was said by one <HI>Matoonas</HI> who was Father to him that
had committed a murder soon after <HI>Philips</HI> first Rebellion, An. 1671. The
Messenger that was sent thither, brought word back that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the
said <HI>Indians</HI> wavering; the young men very furly and insolent, the elder
ones, shewing some inclination to maintain the wonted peace: Soon af∣ter,
<HI>Iuly</HI> 28. 1675. Capt. <HI>Wheeler</HI> was sent to assist (Capt. <HI>Hutchinson</HI>
with a party of twenty Horse to Treat further about the Peace, who go∣ing
first to <HI>Quabaog</HI> or <HI>Brookfield</HI> a Town scituate about si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty or sev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nty
miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> in the Road of <HI>Connecticot.</HI> lying about <HI>twenty five</HI>
miles from the said River, and not far distant from the chief feat of the
<HI>Nipnet Indians.</HI> The Inhabitants of the said <HI>Brookfield</HI> had been so de∣luded
by those Treacherous Villains that they fearing no danger, first
ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained of those <HI>Nipnets,</HI> the promise of a Treaty upon the second of
<HI>August,</HI> whereupon some of the chief of the Town riding along unarmed
<PB N="32" REF="000231_0044_0FA9ABFD114D7950"/>
with the said <HI>Wheeler</HI> and <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> with their party of Horse until
they came to the place appointed, but finding no Indians, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o secure were
they, that they ventured along further, to find the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cels at their chief
Town, never suspecting the least danger, but when they had rode four
or five miles that way, they fell into an Ambush, of two or three hun∣dred
Indians, laid in such a narrow passage, betwixt a steep full on the
one hand, and an hideous Swamp on the other, that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>carce possi∣ble
for any of them to escape, eight of them being shot down upon the
place (whereof three were of <HI>Brookefield</HI>) and three mortally wounded
whereof Capt. <HI>Hutchinson</HI> was one, Cap. <HI>Wheeler</HI> also was near loosing his
life, whose horse was shot down under him, and himself shot through
the body, so that all manner of hopes to escape had been removed from
him, had it not been for his Son, who was (by Gods good providence)
near or next unto him, being a man of undaunted courage (notwith∣standing
his own Arm was broken with a Bullet) yet with great nimble∣nes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and agility of body, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>smounting himself, speedily mounted his Fa∣ther
upon his own Horse, himself getting upon an other, whose
Master was killed, by which means they both escaped, and were
afterwards cured. Much ado had those that were left alive to recover
<HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ookefield,</HI> which in all prob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity they had never done (the common
Road being way laid with Indians on every side as was afterwards
known)▪ had it not been for one well acquainted with those Woods, who
led them in a by path, by w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch means they got thither, a little before
the Indians, who quickly came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king into the Town, with full intent to
destroy it with fire and Sword. But by special providence the Inhabitants
were all gathered to the principal house of the Village (there being
scarce twenty in the Town) before the barbarous Mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s came upon
them, immediately setting fire upon all the dwelling houses, with most of
the other Buildings in the Town save that one into which the Inhabi∣tants
were retired, the which they several times attemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to burn, but
were almost miraculously defeated of their purpose by the immediate
hand of God. In the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen. For when
they had for two dayes assaulted that poor handfull of helpless people,
both night and day pouring in shot upon them incessantly with gunns,
and also thrusting poles with Fire-brands, and rags dipt in brimstone ty∣ed
to the ends of them to fire the house.</P>
<P>At last they used this devilish Scratagem, to fill a Cart with hemp, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and other combustible matter, and so thrusting it backward with poles
spliced together a great length, after they had kindled it; But as soon as it
had begun to take fire, a Storm of rain unexpectedly falling, put
<PB N="33" REF="000231_0045_0FA9ABFF78E8AA20"/>
out the Fire, or else all the poor people, about seventy souls, would either
have been co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sumed by merciless flames, or else have fallen into the
hands of their cruel enemyes, like Wolves continually yelling and gaping
for their prey.</P>
<P>Thus was that distressed Company strangely delivered, who have for
ever cause to say with the Psalmist, <HI>Blessed b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the Lord, who hath not gi∣ven
us a prey to their teeth, our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the
Fowlers, the snare is broken and we are escaped.</HI> For the next night Ma∣jor
<HI>Willard,</HI> by accident hearing of the danger the People were in, as
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, came with forty eight Dragoons to their relief.
The occasion which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought Major <HI>Willard</HI> and Capt. <HI>Parker</HI> of <HI>Greton</HI>
with forty six more, so timely to their relief was this Major <HI>Willard</HI>
in pursuance of his Commission from the Governour and Council, was
upon Wednesday <HI>August the 4th</HI> in the morning, marching out after
some <HI>Indians</HI> to the Westward, to secure them: just as they were set∣ting
forth, some of <HI>Malberough,</HI> who had intelligence by those that were
going to <HI>Connecticot,</HI> and forced to return, what distress <HI>Brookfield</HI> was
in, and knowing of Major <HI>Willards</HI> purpose to go out that morning
from <HI>Lancaster,</HI> sent a Post to acquaint him therewith, which though it
did not find him in the Town, yet overtook him before he had gone a∣bove
four or five miles from the place: whereupon, conceiving it more
needful to succour <HI>Brookfield</HI> in so eminent danger, then to proceed fur∣ther
upon his intended design: he altered his course and marched di∣rectly
thither, being about thirty miles distant when the tidings were
b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought him; so he arrived there that night very seasonably, about an
hour af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er it was dark, or else in probability they had all perished before
the relief sent up from <HI>Boston</HI> could have reached them, which was not
till three dayes after. The providence of God l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kewise in bringing in
the said Major so safely, as well as seasonably to their relief, was very
remarkable. For the <HI>Indians</HI> had subtilly contrived to cut off all re∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f
sent, before it could come at them, by laying Ambushes, and placing
their Scou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, at two or three miles distance round the Town: About an
hundred of them were lodged at an house not far off in the way toward
<HI>Boston,</HI> to cut off any Succour that might come from thence: but it is
supposed they were so intense upon the project they were about for
firing the House, concluding it would without fail take place, that either
they d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not minde their business of Watching, or making such a noise
for joy thereof, that they did not bear their Sentinels when they shot off
their Guns, at two miles distance. It is said that another party of the
<HI>Indians,</HI> let the Major and his Company purposely pass by them, with∣out
<PB N="34" REF="000231_0046_0FA9ABFFC4150758"/>
any opposition, waiting for the blow to be given at their first ap∣proach
near the house, then to have themselves fallen upon their Rear,
and so to have cut them all off, before the besieged understood any thing
thereof. But it pleased God so to order things in providence, that no
notice was taken of them by the Besiegers, nor were they at all discerned
by them till they had made themselves known to their Friends; and were
admitted within the Court of Guard; which when the Enemy had no∣tice
of, they poured in their shot abundantly upon them, but they
were now sheltered from the danger thereof: only it seems their Hor∣ses
were exposed to their fury, so as many of them were ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med and
killed, as were most of the Cattle belonging to the Inhabitants of the
place soon after. This Honoured Person Major <HI>Willard</HI> continued at
<HI>Brookfield</HI> after this famous exploit for the preservation of the poor be∣sieged
at <HI>Brookfield,</HI> divers weeks to order such Companies as were sent
up that way for the securing of the Plantations on that side of the
Country; and not long after he went himself also to <HI>Hadly</HI> upon the
like service of the Country in the present War: But after some time
spent in those parts, he returned back to his own place, to order the af∣fairs
of his own Regiment, much needing his presence, and leaving the
Forces about <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly</HI> under the command of the Major of that Regi∣ment.</P>
<P>But to return to what was in hand before, after the Indians under∣stood
that succours were come in to the beseiged, they fired all that
they had left standing for their own shelter while they had beseiged the
place before mentioned, ran all away into their own dens, in the neigh∣bouring
woods: however it was confessed by one of themselves, that
the enemy had eighty of their men k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled and wounded in this business.
But ere we pass any further in pursuit of the History of these matters,
it will not be amiss to let the Reader understand the horrible perfidi∣ous
and treacherous dealing of these <HI>Nipnet Indians,</HI> who of all other
had the least reason as to any pretence of injury, yet did most deceit∣fully
and barbarously joyn with <HI>Philip</HI> and his Indians, after they had
been several times sent unto by the Governour and Council of the
<HI>Massachusets,</HI> by the advice of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to have prevented their R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing,
as well as the rising of the <HI>Narhagansets,</HI> and also had faithfully promi∣sed
not to meddle in the quarrel, as may more fully appear by the
Engagement under the hands of their Sachems, some time before Capt.
<HI>Hutchinson</HI> and Capt. <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ler</HI> were sent up to them, which by reason
of the hast and unskilfullness of the Messengers on that behalf sent, is
not so fit for publick view: but the account of it from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn,
<PB N="35" REF="000231_0047_0FA9AC0083D89A98"/>
under their hand and oath, <HI>Iuly</HI> 24. 75. when Leiut. <HI>Ephraim Curtice</HI>
spake with five of the <HI>Nipnet</HI> Sachems, four too many to govern so small
a people, but lying upon the head of the principal Indian Territoryes,
they were divided into so many small partyes, two of whom, <HI>viz. Sam</HI>
Sachem of <HI>wesh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cum,</HI> and <HI>Netaump</HI> were executed together afterward
at <HI>Boston.</HI> All of them did at that time solemnly renew their Covenant
and promise under their hands to come to <HI>Boston</HI> to speak further with
the Governour, instead of which what they perfidiously did against Capt
<HI>Hutchinson</HI> and others, hath already been declared.</P>
<P>Upon the report of this sad Disaster that befel the Inhabitants of
<HI>Brookefield,</HI> Forces were sent up under the Command of Capt. <HI>Lothrop</HI>
and others, to pursue after those Indians, harbouring about those pla∣ces,
and if it might be, to prevent them from joyning with the Indians
upon <HI>Connecticut River,</HI> who as yet had not discovered themselves as
willing to espouse <HI>Philips</HI> interest, but rather made some semblance to
the contrary. There was much time spent by Major <HI>Willard,</HI> and se∣veral
Companyes of Souldiers left under his command, about the <HI>Nip∣net</HI>
Country, but all to no purpose; for partly by the treachery of some
of the Indians that came to their assistance, that seemed to favour the
English, but rather acted in behalf of the enemy, partly by the subtle∣tyes
of the enemyes themselves, who could easily by their scouts disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn
the approach of our souldiers, and by the nimbleness of their feet escape
them: our Souldiers could never meet with any of them, but only by
that means driving them further Westward, they gathered all the Indi∣ans
they could to their party about <HI>Pecomptuck.</HI> aliàs <HI>Dearfield, Swams∣cot,</HI>
and <HI>Squakeag,</HI> where were some plantations of the English newly
began, whom they assaulted in the next place, and did what mischief
they could upon them.</P>
<P>It is here to be noted that although that worthy patriot and experi∣enced
Souldier Major <HI>Willard</HI> hearing of the distress of <HI>Brookefield</HI> by
some that were travelling to <HI>Connecticut</HI> was the first that relieved the
distressed people of <HI>Quabaog</HI> or <HI>Brookefield,</HI> yet Major <HI>Pinehon</HI> of
<HI>Springfield</HI> also by accident hearing of their Calamity, had not only sent
word thereof to <HI>Hartford</HI> (from whom he received a supply of five and
twenty or thirty souldiers under Capt. <HI>Wats</HI>) but did also send a Band
of men under Lieut. <HI>Cooper</HI> (who was afterwards villanously slain by
<HI>Springfield</HI> Indians) who with those sent from <HI>Hartford,</HI> and some Indi∣ans
belonging to <HI>Springfield</HI> (seemingly forward to help the English)
made up four score or thereabouts; these marched down to <HI>Brook<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld</HI>
the same day that Capt <HI>Lothrop</HI> and Capt. <HI>Beens</HI> came up from the
<PB N="36" REF="000231_0048_0FA9AC014B7AA8E0"/>
<HI>Massachusets,</HI> who having spent some time in searching the woods a∣bout
<HI>Springfield,</HI> and finding none of the Indians, did the next day march
up to a place called <HI>Memini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isset</HI> by the Indians, where Capt. <HI>Hutchin∣son</HI>
and Capt. <HI>Wheeler</HI> were assaulted, and finding no sign of any Indians
amongst those woods and Swamps; the Company that came from
<HI>Springfield,</HI> left the other Souldiers (who returned to their Quarters at
<HI>Brookfield</HI>) and went up themselves further northward, at least twenty
miles from the said <HI>Brookfield,</HI> and finding no track of Indians in all
those woods, they returned back to <HI>Springfield,</HI> leaving enough to de∣fend
the people of <HI>Brookefield,</HI> and the garison there.</P>
<P>By this it appears, that the Indians by this occasion were driven more
westward into the woods between <HI>Hadly</HI> and <HI>Squakheag.</HI> where they
soon effected their design, <HI>viz.</HI> to leaven the Indians on that side the
Country with the same prejudice and malice against the English, with
which they themselves were (though without cause) in bittered; for
in a few dayes the device took place amongst <HI>Hadly</HI> and <HI>Dearfield</HI> In∣dians,
and was presently put in execution by the said Indians, with∣drawing
from the English and assisting <HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>Nipnets</HI> to
spoile and destroy all the towns westward, as soon after came to
pass: yet at the first some of the <HI>Hadly</HI> Indians pretended real friend∣ship
to the English, and offered themselves to fight against <HI>Philip,</HI> but
the <HI>Mohegin Indians</HI> that came afterward from <HI>Harford</HI> began to
suspect the Treachery of the other, and told the <HI>English</HI> plainly, that no
good would be done, while any of that Company went along with them
in pursuit of the Enemy, for as was said, they would alwayes give some
shout when they came near the Enemy, as if they should thereby wish
them to look to themselves; insomuch that the said <HI>Hadly Indians</HI> fell
into great suspicion with the <HI>English,</HI> and for a proof of their Fidelity,
they were required to bring in their Arms to the <HI>English,</HI> but upon
that motion they delayed a little, but that very night they fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d away from
their Dwellings, which was in a Wooden Fortification, within a mile of
<HI>Hatfield,</HI> whereby they plainly discovered that they had secretly plotted
to joyn with <HI>Philips</HI> Party, as far as they had an opportunity to do them
any eminent service: some think the English failed in point of prudence
not managing that business so warily as they might, which if they had
done, their de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection had been prevented, but it is most probable that
<HI>Philip</HI> had hired them to own his quarrel, by sending them gifts in the
Spring, and that the body of the said <HI>Indians</HI> were most readily inclined
thereunto: But the Sachims and the elder ones of them, seemed loth
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t first to engage against the <HI>English.</HI> In conclusion, when they had so
<PB N="37" REF="000231_0049_0FA9AC01FAA81D00"/>
falsly left their Dwellings, and were running after <HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>Nip∣net
Indians</HI> (at that time harboured in those Woods) the <HI>English</HI> were
so provoked, that were under Capt. <HI>Lothrop</HI> and Capt. <HI>Beers,</HI> that they
pursued after them very early the next morning, and overtook them a∣bout
ten miles above <HI>Hatfield,</HI> at a place called <HI>Sugar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> loaf Hill,</HI> and had a
small skirmish with them, wherein there were nine or ten of the <HI>English</HI>
slain, and about twenty six <HI>Indians:</HI> yet the rest escaped; and so joyned
with <HI>Philip</HI> and his Company, presently after which accident, they were
so emboldned, that upon the first of <HI>September,</HI> about seven dayes after
they set upon <HI>Dearfield,</HI> killed one Man, and laid most of the Houses in
ashes. About two or three dayes after they fell upon <HI>Squakeag,</HI> ano∣ther
new Plantation, fifteen miles higher up the River, above <HI>Dearfield,</HI>
where they killed nine or ten of the People, the rest hardly escaped into
the Garison house.</P>
<P>The next day, this disaster not being known, Captain <HI>Beers,</HI> for
fear of the worst, with thirty six men, was sent up to the said <HI>Squakeag,</HI>
with supplies both of men and provision to secure the small Garison
there, but before they came very near to the Town, they were set upon
by many hundreds of the <HI>Indians</HI> out of the Bushes by a Swamp side, of
whom Capt. <HI>Beers</HI> (who was known to fight valiantly to the very last)
with about twenty of his men, were by this sudden surprisal there slain,
the rest flying back to <HI>Hadly.</HI> Here the Barbarous Villains shewed
their insolent rage and cruelty, more then ever before, cutting off the
heads of some of the slain, and fixing them upon Poles near the High∣way,
and not only so, but one (if not more) was found with a Chain
hooked into his under jaw, and so hung up on the Bow of a Tree, (tis
feared he was hung up alive) by which means they thought to daunt
and discourage any that might come to their relief, and also to terrifie
those that should be Spectators with the beholding so sad an object: in∣somuch
that Major <HI>Treat</HI> with his Company, going up two days after,
to fetch off the residue of the Garison, were solemnly affected with that
doleful fight, which made them make the more hast to bring down the
Garison, not waiting for any opportunity to take revenge upon the Ene∣my,
having but an hundred with him, two few for such a purpose. Cap∣tain
<HI>Appleton</HI> going up after him, met him coming down, and would
willingly have perswaded them, to have turned back, to see if they could
have made any spoil upon the Enemy, but the greatest part advised to
the contrary, so that they were all forced to return, with what they
could carry away, leaving the rest for a booty to the Enemy, who shall
ere long pay a sad reckoning for their Robberies and Cruelties, in the
<PB N="38" REF="000231_0050_0FA9AC02B7267820"/>
time appointed: but the sufferings of the <HI>English</HI> were not as yet come
to their height, for after they were come to <HI>Hadly,</HI> the Commander in
chief taking Counsel with the Officers of the Souldiers, ordered them
that were then present to Garison the Towns about; some to be at
<HI>North-Hampton, Hat field, Dearfield,</HI> and some to remain at <HI>Hadly</HI> where
were the Head-quarters of the <HI>English.</HI> But perceiving that little good
was to be done upon the Enemy in those parts, it was agreed that what
Corn was left at <HI>Dearfield,</HI> being threshed out as well as they could in
those tumults (about three thousand Bushels was supposed to be there
standing in stacks) should be brought to <HI>Hadly,</HI> and wait further time to
fight the Enemy. It came to C. <HI>Lothrops</HI> turn, or rather it was his choice
with about eighty men to guard several Carts laden with Corn, &amp; other
Goods, the Company under Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI> then quartering at <HI>Dearfield</HI>
intended that day to pursue after the Enemy. But upon <HI>September</HI> 18. that
most fatal day, the saddest that ever befel <HI>New-England,</HI> as the Compa∣ny
were marching along with the Carts (it may be too securely) never
apprehending danger so near, were suddenly set upon, and almost all
cut off (not above seven or eight escaping) which great defeat came
to pass by the unadvised proceeding of the Captain (who was himself
slain in the first assault) although he wanted neither courage nor skill,
to lead his Souldiers; but having taken up a wrong notion about the
best way and manner of fighting with the <HI>Indians</HI> (which he was always
wont to argue for) <HI>viz.</HI> that it were best to deal with the <HI>Indians</HI> in
their own way, <HI>sc.</HI> by skulking behind Trees. and taking their aim at
single persons, which is the usual manner of the <HI>Indians</HI> fighting one
with another, but herein was his great mistake, in not considering the
great disadvantage a smaller Company would have in dealing that way
with a greater multitude: for if five have to deal with one, they may
surround him, and every one take his aim at him, while he can level but
at one of his Enemies at a time: which gross mistake of his, was the
ruine of a choice company of young men, the very flower of the Coun∣ty
of <HI>Essex,</HI> all culled out of the Towns belonging to that County, none
of which were ashamed to speak with the Enemy in the gate: their dear
Relations at home mourning for them, like <HI>Rachil</HI> for her children, and
would not be comforted, not only because they were not, but because
they were so miserably lost. (The like mistake was conceived to be the

pursuing the <HI>Indians</HI> that ran away from <HI>Hadly,</HI> and of the twenty

shot down.) For had he ordered his men to March in a Body, as some
of his fellow-Commanders advised, either backward, or forward, in
reason, they had not lost a quarter of the number of them that fell that
day by the edge of the Sword. For the Indians, notwithstanding their
sublety and cruelty, durst not look an <HI>Englishman</HI> in the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, in the o∣pen
field, nor ever yet were known to kill any man with their Guns, un∣less
when they could ly in wait for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, in an ambush, or behind some
shelter, taking aim undiscovered; so that although it was judged by
those that escaped, that there was seven or eight hundred <HI>Indians</HI> at least
that encountred that Company of eighty of <HI>English,</HI> yet if they had
k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt together in a Body, and fought Marching, they might have escaped
the numbers of the Enemy, with little loss in comparison of what they
sustained. For the valiant and successful Capt. <HI>Mosely,</HI> and his Lieu∣tenant,
coming▪ though too late) to their rescue, marched through
and through that great body of <HI>Indians,</HI> and yet came off with little or
no loss in comparison of the other. And having fought all those <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
for five or six hours upon a march, lost not above two men all that
while, nor received other damage besides eight or nine that were woun∣ded,
which yet were carried to their quarters at night at <HI>Hatfield</HI> where∣as
if these had proceeded in the same way of fighting as Capt. <HI>Lothrop</HI>
did in the morning, they might have been surrounded, and so have been
served as the former were: but God had other wise determined in his
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et counsel, and therefore that was hid from the one which was a

<P>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her releif also was seasonably sent in, <HI>viz.</HI> a Company of English,
and <HI>Mohegin</HI> or <HI>Peq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od</HI> Indians under the Command of Major <HI>Treat,</HI>
who was in the morning marching another way, <HI>viz.</HI> up toward
<HI>Squakh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag</HI> to seek after the enemy that way, with about an hundred
souldiers, Indians and English, upon whose approach the enemy, pretty
well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quainted by this last encounter with the valour of the English,
immediately went clear away, giving Major <HI>Treat</HI> and Capt. <HI>Mosely,</HI>
who returned to <HI>Dearfield</HI> that night, an opportunity to bury the slain
the next day. As Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI> came upon the Indians in the morning
he found them stripping of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain, amongst whom was one <HI>Robert
Dutch</HI> of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving been sorely wounded by a bullet that rased to
his skull, and then maul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the Indian hatchets, left for dead by the
Salvages, and stript by them of all but his skin, yet when <HI>Capt, Mose∣ly
came</HI> near, he almost miraculously as one raised from the dead came
towards the Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, to their no small amazement, by whom being
received and cloathed, he was carryed off to the next garison, and is

li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing &amp; in perfect health at this day▪ May he be to the friends &amp; relations
of the rest of the slain, an emblem of their more perfect resurrection at
the last day to receive their crowns among the rest of the Martyres
that have laid down or ventured their lives as a testimony to the truth
of their Religion, as well as love to their Country.</P>
<P>This fore defeat of Capt. <HI>Lethrop</HI> and his men, was the more to be
lamented, in that (falling out so soon after two ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of the like nature)
it so emboldned the enemy, that they durst soon after adventure upon
considerable towns, though well garisoned with souldiers, and gave
them occasion of most insolent Braving the Garison at <HI>Dearfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld</HI> the
next day, hanging up the garments of the English, in sight of the Soul∣diers,
yet on the other fide of the river. However it pleased God,
who is alwayes wont to remember his people in their low estate, to put
such a restraint upon them, that when they passed very near the Gari∣son
house at <HI>Dearfield</HI> (wherein were not left above twenty seven
souldiers) their Captain using this strategem, to cause his trumpet to
sound as if he had another troop near by to be called together, they
turned another way and made no attempt upon the house where that
small number was, which if they had done with any ordinary resoluti∣on,
so small an handfull of men cousd hardly have withstood the force
of so many hundreds as were then gathered together.</P>
<P>What loss the Enemy sustained by the resistance of Capt. <HI>Lothrop</HI> &amp;
his men, (who no doubt being all resolute young men, and seeing they
shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d be forced by the hard law of the sword to for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> goe their lives,
held them at as high a rate as they could) is not certai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly known. It
hath since been confessed by some of the Indians themselves, that they
lost ninety six of their m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that day. Capt. <HI>Moselyes</HI> men coming sud∣denly
upon them when they were pillaging of the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, fell upon them
with such a smart assault, that they drove them presently into a swamp
following them so close, that for seven miles together they fought
them upon a march, charging them through and through. <HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z Sa∣vage</HI>
and Leiut, <HI>Pickering</HI> his Leiutenants deserving no little part of the
honour of that dayes Service, being sometimes called to lead the Com∣pany
in the front, while Capt <HI>Mosely</HI> took a little breath, who was al∣most
melted with labouring, commanding, and leading his men through
the midest of the enemy.</P>
<P>The Indians gathered together in those parts, appearing so nume∣rous,
and, as might justly he supposed, growing more confident by
some of their last successes, and the number of our men being after
this sad rate diminished, Recruits also not being suddenly to be ex∣pected,
<PB N="41" REF="000231_0053_0FA9AC07C2483698"/>
at so great a distance as an hundred miles from all supplyes,
the Commander in chief with the Officers, saw a necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of slighting
that Garison at <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rfield,</HI> imploying the Forces they had to secure and
strengthen the three next towns below upon <HI>Connecticut River.</HI> And
it was well that counsel was thought upon; for now those wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched
Caitiffs begin to talk or great matters, hoping that by degrees they
might destroy all the towns thereabout, as they had already b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gun:
Their hopes no doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, were not a little heightned by the accession of
<HI>Springfield Indians</HI> to their party, who had in appearance all this time
stood the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmest to the interest of the English of all the rest in those
parts: But they all hanging together, like Serpents eggs, were easily
perswaded to joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with those of <HI>Hadly</HI> (there being so near allyance
between them, for the Sachem of <HI>Springfield</HI> Indians was the father of
<HI>Hadly</HI> Sachem) not only by the success of their treacherous and bloud-thirsty
comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nions, but by the same inbred m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lice and antipathy against
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>glish manners and Religion.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Springfield</HI> were not unsensible of their danger,
and therefore had upon the first breaking forth of these troubles been
t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Indians, and had received from them the firmest as∣surance,
and pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dges of their faithfulness, and friendsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p that could be
immagined or desired, both by Covenant, promises and Hostages given
for s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>curity, so as no doubt was left in any of their minds: Yet
did these faithless and ungratefull Monsters plot with <HI>Philips</HI> Indians
to burn and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>troy all <HI>Springfield,</HI> as they had done <HI>Brookfield</HI> before:
to that end they sent cunningly and enticed away the Hostages from
<HI>Hartford</HI> whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e they were, perhaps too securely watched over, a day
or two before: Then receiving above three hundred of <HI>Philips</HI> Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
into their Fort, priva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely in the night time, so as they were neither dis∣cerned
nor suspected: Yea so confident were such of the inhabitants as
were most conversant with the Indians at their Fort, that they would
not believe there was any such plot in hand, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was strangly re∣vealed
by one <HI>Toto</HI> an Indian at <HI>Windsor,</HI> better affected to the English,
(about eighteen or twenty miles below <HI>Springfield,</HI> upon the same Ri∣ver)
and so by Post tidings thereof brought to <HI>Springfield</HI> the night be∣fore,
insomuch that the Lieutenant of the town, <HI>Cooper</HI> by name, was so
far from believing the Stratagem, that in the morning himself with an∣other
would venture to ride up to the Fort, to see whether things were
so or no. The Fort was about a mile from the town; when he came
within a little thereof, he met these bloudy and deceitfull Monsters,
newly issued out of their <HI>Equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Trojanus</HI> to act their intended mischief,
<PB N="42" REF="000231_0054_0FA9AC0968065298"/>
they presently fired upon him diverse of them, and shot him in several
places through the body, yet being a man of stout courage, he kept his
horse, till he recovered the next garison house, his companion they shot
dead upon the place▪ by this meanes giving a sad alarm to the town of
their intended mischief, which was instantly fired in all places
where there were no Garisons. The poor people having never an Offi∣cer
to lead them, being like sheep ready for the slaughter, and no doubt
the whole town had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en tot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly destroyed, but that a report of the
Plot being caryed about over night, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jor <HI>Treat</HI> came from <HI>Westfield</HI>
time enough in a manner for their rescue, but wanting boates to trans∣port

before, to a very great damage of the Owner) the faithless and deceit∣full

<P>Amongst the ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes of the said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wellings, the saddest to behold was

Of all the mischiefs done by the said enemy before that day, the burn∣of
this town of <HI>Springfield</HI> did m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re then any other▪ dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over the said

there having been for about forty years so good correspondence be∣twixt
the English of that town and the neighbouring Indians; But in
them is made good what is said in the Psalm, that though their words
were smoother then oyle, yet were they drawn swords.</P>
<P>After some little time spent in garisoning the place, and helping the
Inhabitants to secure what they had left, the English souldiers most of
them returned back to <HI>Hadly</HI> their head-quarters, and Major <HI>Pynchon</HI>
being so full of incumbrances, by reason of the late spoyls done to
himself, and his neighbours at <HI>Springfield,</HI> could not any longer attend
the Service of commanding in Chief as he had done before, wherefore
being according to his earnest Request to the Council eased of that bur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en;
Capt. <HI>Samuel Appleton</HI> was ordered to succeed in taking the charge
<PB N="43" REF="000231_0055_0FA9AC0981C1A560"/>
of the Souldiers left in those upper towns, by whose Industry, skill and
courag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, those towns were preserved from runing the same fate with the
rest, wholy or in part so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> turned into ashes. For the enemy grow∣ing
very confident by the late successes, came with all their fury the
nineteenth of <HI>October</HI> following upon <HI>Hatfield,</HI> hoping no less then to
doe the like mischief to them, they had newly done to <HI>Springfield:</HI> But
according to the good providence of Almighty God, Major <HI>Treat</HI> was
newly returned to <HI>Northampton,</HI> Capt. <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sely</HI> and Capt. <HI>Poole</HI> were then
garisoning the said <HI>Hatfield,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Appleton</HI> for the like end quar∣tering
at <HI>Hadly,</HI> when on the sudden seven or eight hundred of the ene∣my
came upon the town in all quarters, having first killed or taken
two or three of the Scouts belonging to the town, and seven more be∣longing
to Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI> his Company: But they were so well enter∣tained
on all hands where they attempted to break in upon the town,
that they found it too hot for them. Major <HI>Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> with great cou∣rage

the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the English instantly beaten off, without doing much

side another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passing through his own hair, by that whisper telling
him that death was very near, but did him no other harm. Night com∣ing
on, it could not be discerned what loss the enemy sustained, diverse
were seen to fall, some run through a small river, others cast their
guns into the water (it being their manner to venture as much to re∣cover
the dead bodyes of their friends, as to defend them when alive)</P>
<P>At last after the burning of some few barns, with some other buil∣dings,
the enemy hasted away as fast as they came on, leaving the En∣glish
to bless God who had so mercifully delivered them from the fury
of their merciless foes, who had in conceit without doubt, devoured
them all: But this resolute and valiant repulse, put such a check upon
the pride of the enemy, that they made no further attempt upon any
of those towns for the present, but winter drawing on, they retired
all of them to their general rendezvouze at <HI>Narhaganset,</HI> where we
shall leave them for the present plotting their general design of accom∣plishing
their intended mischief against the English the next Spring.</P>
<P>Our Western Plantations upon <HI>Connectieut River,</HI> were the
stage whereon were acted the most remarkable passages of this
barbarous War hitherto, which was soon after removed into many o∣ther
places of the Country in the Winter and Spring following, whither
our discourse must in the next place pursue it: There was not any
<PB N="44" REF="000231_0056_0FA9AC0BDC2B4208"/>
great matter acted by the Enemy amongst the Plantations upon the
great River during the Winter, after the assault made upon <HI>Hatfield
October</HI> 19. It is evident that the body of them returned to <HI>Narrha∣ganset</HI>
upon the approach of the Winter, which set in more early then it
used in other years: where <HI>Philip</HI> did bestow himself in the winter sea∣son
is not so certain; some say that he repaired further westward, to
try his fortune with those Indians that ly towards <HI>Albany,</HI> near the
<HI>Dutch River:</HI> others more probably conceive that he lay hid in some
part of the <HI>Narrhtganses Country;</HI> for though he was not certainly
known to be about the Fort at <HI>Narrhaganset,</HI> when it was taken by our
Forces in the winter, yet as soon as ever they were driven out of the
Country in <HI>February,</HI> he was found amongst them that did the mischief
at <HI>Lancaster</HI> in that month.</P>
<P>Some stragling parties of them remained about <HI>North-Hampton,
Westfield &amp; Springfield</HI> some time after their defeat at <HI>Hatfield;</HI> seven
or eight of the Inhabitants of <HI>North-Hampton</HI> in the end of <HI>October,</HI>
venturing to fetch in some of their Harvest, that was left somewhere
out of the Town, were in danger of being surprised, having laid their
Arms under their Cart, so as being destitute of means to make their
defence, they were glad to fly away with the Horses out of their Cart,
leaving what they were about to the pleasure of the Indians that assault∣ed.
Major <HI>Treat</HI> upon the hearing the Alarm, presently repaired thi∣ther,
but could not come time enough to destroy any of the Enemy, not
yet to prevent the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r burning of four or five Houses, with two or three
Barns that stood somewhat out of the Town. Within a little time af∣ter
they kill'd three of the same Town, as they were at work in a Mea∣dow
not far from the Town: they intended also to have burned the
Mill, but it was too well guarded by two files of Muskeriers lodged
there for the purpose, who put them beside their intent, Six or seven
of <HI>Spring field</HI> soon after going to the Mill at <HI>Westfield</HI> (that which be∣longed
to their own Town being burned <HI>October 5th.</HI>) and venturing
without Arms, three of them were killed by some of the Enemy, who
took the advantage also to burn four or five Houses that belonged to the
said <HI>Westfield:</HI> but by the end of <HI>November</HI> the coast was pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty clear of

marched on to <HI>Poppachuog,</HI> and finding the Indians all fled, (although
they perceived by a Messenger accidentally sent back, that the Indians
f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowed them all that way they marched) they came back to <HI>Mendham</HI>
to settle things in that Town: some of the Inhabitants informed them
of some Indian W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gwams about ten miles off: the Captain with <HI>Philip
Curtice</HI> his Lieutenant, resolved to give them a camisado in their Wig∣wams
that night: to that end, they mounted two and twenty upon
Horses, riding up ten miles into the Woods, and when they came near
the Wigwams, they dismounted, and intended presently to march up,
and give an assault upon them, after they had first made a shout to fright
the Enemy: they ordered one half to follow the Lieutenant, the other
to follow the Captain, when they came within a quarter of a mile of the
place, their Dogs began to bark, at which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and by and by
marching again, intended presently to fire in upon them, but the Cap∣tains
foot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lipping, he could hardly recover himself, when suddenly
looking behind him, he saw no man following of him: the Lieutenant
had five behind him, who with those five resolutely fired on that side he
was appointed to make the ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ule upon; but they were repulsed by the
<HI>Indians,</HI> who firing out of their dens, shot down the Lieutenant and
another, the rest presently ran away to a fence: the Captain with all
<PB N="46" REF="000231_0058_0FA9AC0D3803FB28"/>
vehemency urged them to stay, they replied, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> back but only
to charge, yet went clear away, by which means, togeth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with the co∣wardize
of the former, so sad a loss befell the Company, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not
easily be repaired: however the Enemy presently deserted the Wigwan
and gave our men the next day an opportunity to fetch off their two
dead men, and bury them, and so with grief and shame were constrained
to return to their quarters at <HI>Mendham,</HI> to whose Inhabitants they
gave notice of 200 bushels of Corn belonging to the Indians, that
might have been preserved, which for want of hands was lost by the fire,
that the Enemy might not be benefited thereby. It appears by the fore∣going
passage, that the time of our deliverance was not yet come, and
that God had further tryals to acquaint us with before he would turn
his hand upon our Enemies. But it pleased the Lord in mercy so to
order things, that they themselves fell into that pit they were digging for
others, as shall appear more fully in what follows.</P>
<P>The English Plantations about <HI>Hadly</HI> being for the present set a little
at l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erty by the Indians drawing off, like Seamen after a Storm, counted
it the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> best course to repair their tackling against another that may be
next coming, wherefore the Inhabitants concluded it the safer way to
make a kind of Barricado about their Towns, by setting up Pallizadoes
or cleft wood about eight foot long, as it were to break the force of any
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udden assault which the <HI>Indians</HI> might make upon them; which counsel
proved very successful; for although it be an inconsiderable defence a∣gainst
a Warlike Enemy, that hath strength enough, and confidence to
Lesiege a place, yet it is sufficient to prevent any sudden assault of such
a timerous and barbarous Enemy as these were, for although they did
afterwards in the Spring break through those Pallizadoes at <HI>North∣Hampton,</HI>
yet as soon as ever they began to be repulsed, they saw them∣selves
like Wolves in a Pound, that they could not fly away at their plea∣sure,
so as they never adventured to break through afterward upon any
of the Towns so secured.</P>
<P>As for those of <HI>Springfield,</HI> they were now and then Alarmed with a
few skulking Indians lurking about in the adjacent Woods; as once at
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eadow, where half a score of them were seen about an house
r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mote from the Town, who were pursued by a party of the English to∣ward
<HI>Windsor,</HI> and so escaped, after the English had made one shot upon
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, not knowing certainly how many they killed. So at another
time, a few of those barbarous wretches kill'd a poor man belonging to
<HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing field,</HI> as he was going to his house to look after his Corn on the
ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er side of the River, and after th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> had killed the man, they burnt
<PB N="47" REF="000231_0059_0FA9AC0DF50D5450"/>
down his house; yet attempted no further mischief upon that
part of the Town that had escaped the fury of the Flames, <HI>October</HI> 5.
By which it is evident, that all the number of Indians that had assaul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
them befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, had not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awn themselves for the present to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir winter
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, some to the <HI>Dutch River,</HI> but the greatest number of them to
be su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e were found in the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter at the <HI>Narrhaganse: Fort,</HI> where we
sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll leave them for the present till the Forces of the U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es
shall fire them out of their nests.</P>
<P>The Souldiers continuing some time at <HI>Hatfield</HI> after this victory, as
we may well call it (for it seems to have given the first check to the rage
of the heathen within the Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isdiction of the united Colonyes, they have
b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en observed ever since to have been on the losing hand, seldome or
never daring to meet our Souldiers in the open Field, unless when they
have very great advantage as to their numbers, or covert of the woods
and bushes: although like some ranging Beasts they have done much
mischief several times si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, when they were ready to expire or when
the pangs of death were coming upon them) our forces therefore be∣ing
all called home, save some left for garisoning the towns there∣abouts.</P>
<P>The Commissioners of the united Colonyes taking into serious Con∣fideration
the present state of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings, <HI>viz.</HI> that there were before this
time so many hundreds g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thered together into one Body, and that
there was great reason to fear, if they were let alone till the next spring
they might all rise together as one man round about us, and that one
Town after ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght easily be destroyed, before any help could be
dispatched to them. On the one hand the sharpness of the winter in
these pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts was well weighed, so extream that it might hazard the loss
of a thousand men in one night, if they were forced to lodge abroad in
the open field; as also the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficulty, if not impossibility of sending any
relief to them at any distance, the depth of snow usually making the
wayes unpass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble for diverse months together</P>
<P>On the other hand it was considered, that if the enemy were let alone
till the next summer, it would be imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssible to deal with them, or find
them any where, but they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one company of Souldiers after
another, as was seen by the experience of the former year. Conside∣ring
also that the <HI>Narhagansets,</HI> the most numerous of all the rest, and
the best prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded of provision of all the other Indians, had now declared
themselves our enemyes, who if they were let alone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the winter was
over, we should be unable to deal with so many enemyes at once, that
could on a su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den on any occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves like grashoppers
all over the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="000231_0060_0FA9AC0ED9EE0BD8"/>
It was therefore finally agreed upon by the general consent of all, to
to fall upon the winter quarters of our enemyes, by a more considerable
Army (if I may so call it) gathered out of all the three Colonyes, and
that with all expedition, at farthest not to exceed the tenth of <HI>December</HI>
before they should have a thousand men in arms ready for the de∣signe.</P>
<P>As for the late League made or rather renewed with the <HI>Narhagan∣sets,</HI>
it was sufficiently evident &amp; known, that they had all along from the
first day when it was confirmed broken every article of it, specially in
not delivering up the enemyes which had sheltered themselves with
them all this while, which though they did not positively deny, yet did no∣thing
but find excuses, to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er it one week after another, till at the last
they would be excused till the next Spring, upon pretence that they
could not before that time get them together. Beside the favouring
of those that fled to them, and supplying the whole Body of the enemy
with victuals, upon all occasions. It was likewise strongly suspected
that in all the late proceedings of the enemy, many of their young men
were known to be actually in arms against us, many of whom were
found ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her wounded amongst them in their wigwams, or else were
occasionally seen returning back, after exploits abroad, to be healed
of their wounds at home. Also some of our mens guns that were lost
at <HI>Dearfield</HI> were found in the Fort when it was fired. Therefore all
scruples as to the justness and necessity of the war being removed, the
only question was, whether it were feasible and expedient in the winter.
The exigent was very great, and the choyce very hard: But as David
when he was streightened with many difficultyes at once, cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e rather
to fall into the hands of God whose mercyes were great, though he
might be provoked to cause his jealousie to smoak against those of his
own heritage for a time: so in this exigent it was generally conceived
to be most expedient for the Country, to cast themselves upon the pro∣vidence
of a mercifull and gracious God, rather then by delayes to ex∣pose
themselves to the treachery and cruelty of a perfidious enemy.</P>
<P>A War therefore speedily to be carryed on in the very depth of win∣ter,
being agreed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, care was taken for supplyes, as the difficulty
of such an affair so circumstanced did require, though possibly not with
so much necessary care, and so suitable provision, as had been desired,
if what came afterward to pass could have been foreseen (which perad∣venture
might be the reason things went on so heavily for want of
well oyling the wheels) in the mean time a small Army of a thousand
fighting men, well appointed, were ordered by the Commissioners to
<PB N="49" REF="000231_0061_0FA9AC0FA47AE9B8"/>
be gathered by proportion out of all the Colonyes; of which number
the share of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> was to be five hundred and twenty seven,
the rest were to be supplyed out of <HI>Plimouth</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colonyes,
All other supplyes were taken care for, as well as the suddenness of the
Expedition, and difficulty of the season would allow. The said thousand
men, beside some Voluntiers of Indian Friends, were by the time and
place appointed as near as could be had, called together, and a Com∣mission
granted to the honourable <HI>Iosiah Winslow</HI> Esq, the present
Governour of <HI>Plimouth Colony,</HI> a man of known ability and integrity,
every way so well qualified wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> courage and Resolution, as well as pru∣dence
and discretion, as might have preferred him to the conduct of a
far greater Army then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver is like to be gathered together in this part
of the world, in this or in following Generations. And indeed as he
was the first Governour over any of the united Colonyes in <HI>New-En∣gland</HI>
of them that were born in the place, so may he well pass for a
pattern of any of the succeeding race, that may come after.</P>
<P>Under him as Commander in Chief were ordered six Companyes
from the <HI>Massashusets,</HI> under the Command of Major <HI>Appleton,</HI> Capt.
<HI>Mose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> Capt. <HI>Gardener,</HI> Capt. <HI>Davenport,</HI> Capt. <HI>Oliver,</HI> Capt. <HI>Iohnson,</HI>
Five Companyes from <HI>Connecticus</HI> under Major <HI>Treat,</HI> Capt. <HI>Siely,</HI> Capt.
<HI>Gallop,</HI> Capt. <HI>Mason,</HI> Capt. <HI>Wats,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Marshal,</HI> Two Compa∣nyes
from <HI>Plimonth,</HI> under Major <HI>Bradford</HI> and Capt. <HI>Goram.</HI></P>
<P>Under the Governour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> as Commander in Chief in this Ex∣pedition,
were sent as Majors of the Forces belonging to each Colony,
Major <HI>Robert Treat</HI> for the Forces belonging to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and Major
<HI>Bradford</HI> for those of the Colony of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and Major <HI>Samuel Ap∣pleton</HI>
for those of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> to whom by the honourable Major
General of the said Colony were six Companyes of Foot delivered at
<HI>Dedham; December</HI> the <HI>9th.</HI> 1675, containing in number 465 fighting
men, besides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Troop of Horse under the Command of Capt. <HI>Thomas
Prentice</HI> attending upon them. That night they marched to <HI>Woodcocks</HI>
about 27. miles from <HI>Dedham.</HI> The next night they arrived at <HI>Sea∣conck;</HI>
Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI> and his Company went from thence with Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>
by water, the rest ferried over the water to <HI>Providence.</HI></P>
<P>The next day, <HI>Decemb.</HI> the <HI>12th.</HI> they passed over <HI>Patuxet River,</HI> and
then marching through <HI>Pomhams Country,</HI> at night they met with Capt.
<HI>Mosely</HI> and his Company at Mr. <HI>Smiths</HI> in <HI>Wickford,</HI> the place intended
for their Head-quarters. Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI> in his way thither had happily
surpri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed thirty six Indians, one of whom he took along with him as a
Guide, <HI>Peter</HI> by name, that was at that time under some disgu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with his
<PB N="50" REF="000231_0062_0FA9AC1150DABE38"/>
Country-men, or his Sachem, which made him prove the more real friend
to our forces in that service, wherein he faithfully performed w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
promised, and without his assistance our men would have been much at
a loss to have found the enemy, until it had been too late to have fought
them.</P>
<P>Two dayes after, <HI>Decemb.</HI> 14. Five Files of men sent out under Ser∣jeant
<HI>Bennet</HI> and another, upon the Scout, kill'd one man and one wo∣man,
and brought in four more by one of the clock: the whole Compa∣ny
marched after into some of the Sachems Country, where they burnt
an hundred and fifty Wigwams, killed seven of the enemy, and brought
in eight Prisoners when they returned at night.</P>
<P>The next day an Indian called <HI>Stone-wall-Iohn</HI> pretended to come from
the Sachems, intimating their wiilingness to have peace with the En∣glish,
yet could the Messenger hardly forbear threatning, vapouring of
their numbers and strength, adding withall that the English durst not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight them: whatever were pretended by this treacherous fellow, some
of his Crew as he went home met with some of Capt. <HI>Gardners</HI> men, that
were stragling about their own business contrary to order, and slew his
Serjeant, with one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two more. Two also of Capt. <HI>Olivers</HI> men were
kill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in like manner; a solemn warning for Souldiers not to be too ven∣terous
in an enemyes Country. For preventing the like mischief upon
other Companyes, more care was taken as they passed to the Head-quarters,
some of the Companyes being lodged three miles there from.
Capt. <HI>Moselyes,</HI> Capt. <HI>Davenp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts</HI> and Capt <HI>Olivers</HI> Company being al∣so
sent about that time to bring Major <HI>Appletons</HI> Company to the gene∣ral
Quarters, a few desperate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndians creeping under a stone wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> near
the place, fired twenty or thirty gunns at <HI>Mosely</HI> in particular, a Com∣mander
well known amongst them, but the rest of the Company running
down upon them, killed one of them, and scattered the rest.</P>
<P>The next day Capt. <HI>Prentice</HI> with his Troop, being sent to <HI>Petequam∣scot,</HI>
returned with the sad news of burning <HI>Ierry Bulls</HI> Garison house,
and killing ten English men and five women and children, but two esca∣ping
in all. This is the chance of warr which they who under take, must
prepare to undergoe.</P>
<P>The next day brought from the same place a little better news, though
not enough to ballance the sorrow of the former, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Connecticut</HI>
Forces were come thither with three hundred English, and an hundred
and fifty <HI>Mohegins,</HI> ready fixed to warr on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> behalf of the English a∣gainst
the <HI>Narhagansets</HI> their mortal enemyes; and by the way meeting
a Party of the enemy, they slew five or six of them and took as many
<PB N="51" REF="000231_0063_0FA9AC11DE3863A0"/>
Prisoners. The whole number of all our Forces being now come, the
want of provision with the sharpness of the cold, minded them of expedi∣tion,
wherefore the very next day, the whole Body of the <HI>Massachu∣set</HI>
and <HI>Plimouth</HI> Forces marched away to <HI>Pettyqua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scot</HI> intending to en∣gage
the enemy upon the first opportunity that next offered it self: To
the which resolution those of <HI>Connecticut</HI> presently consented, as soon as
they met together, which was about five a clock in the afternoon: <HI>Bulls</HI>
house intended for their general Rendezvouze, being unhappily burnt
down two or three days before, there was no shelter left either for Offi∣cer
or private Souldier, so as they were necessicated to march on toward
the enemy through the snow, in a cold stormy evening, finding no o∣ther
defence all that night, save the open air, nor other covering then a
cold and moist fleece of snow. Through all these difficultyes they mar∣ched
from the break of the next day, <HI>December</HI> 19. till one of the clock
in the afternoon, without either fire to warm them, or respite to take
any food, save what they could chew in their march. Thus having wa∣ded
fourteen or fifteen mile through the Country of the old Queen, or
<HI>Sunke Squaw</HI> of <HI>Narhaganset:</HI> they came at one a clock upon the edge
of the Swamp where their guide assured them they should find Indians
enough before night.</P>
<P>Our Forces chopping thus upon the seat of the enemy, upon the sud∣den,
they had no time either to draw up in any order or form of Bat∣tle,
nor yet opportunity to consult where or how to assault. As they
marched Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI> and Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI> led the Van, Major <HI>Apple∣ton</HI>
and Capt. <HI>Oliver</HI> brought up the Reer of the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Forces;
General <HI>Winslow</HI> with the <HI>Plimouth</HI> Forces marched in the Centre; those
of <HI>Connecticut</HI> came up in the Reer of the whole Body: But the Fron∣tiers
discerning Indians in the edge of the Swamp, fired immediately upon
them, who answering our men in the same Language, retired presently
into the Swampe, our men followed them in amayn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, without staying for
the word of Command, as if every one were ambitious who should goe
first, never making any stand till they came to the sides of the Fort, into
which the Indians that first fired upon them betook themselves.</P>
<P>It seems that there was but one entrance into the Fort, though the
enemy found many wayes to come out, but neither the English nor
their Guide well knew on which side the entrance lay; nor was it easie to
have made another; wherefore the good providence of Almighty God is
the more to be acknowledged, who as he led <HI>Israel</HI> sometime by the Pillar
of fire, and the Cloud of his presence a right way through the Wilder∣ness,
so did he now direct our Forces upon that side of the Fort, where
<PB N="52" REF="000231_0064_0FA9AC12892EDC50"/>
they might only enter though not without utmost danger, and hayard.
The Fort was raised upon a kind of Island of five or six acres of rising
land in the midst of a Swamp; the sides of it were made of palizadoes set
upright the which was compassed about with an bedge of almost a rod
thickness, through which there was no passing, unless they could have
fired a way through, which then they had no time to doe. The place
where the Indians used ordinarily to enter themselves, was over a long
tree over a place▪ of water, where but one man could enter at a time, &amp;
which was so way-laid that they would have been cut off that had ven∣tured
there: But at one corner there was a Gap made up only with a
long tree, about four or five foot from the ground, over which men
might easily pass: But they had placed a kind of a Block house right over
against the said tree, from whence they sorely galled our men that first
entred, some being shot dead upon the tree, as Capt. <HI>Iohnson,</HI> and some
as soon as they entred, as was Capt. <HI>Davenport,</HI> so as they that first en∣tred
were forced presently to retire, and fall upon their bellyes till the
fury of the enemyes shot was pretty well spent, which, some Companyes
that did not discern the da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger, not observing, lost sundry of their men,
but at the last two Companyes being brought up besides the four that
first marched up, they animated one another to make another assault, one
of the Commanders crying out, <HI>They run, they run,</HI> which did so en∣courage
the Souldiers that they presently entred amain. After a con∣siderable
number were well entred, they presently beat the enemy out
of a Flanker on the left hand, which did a little shelter our men from
the enemyes shot, till more Company came up, and so by degrees made
up higher, first into the middle, and then into the upper end of the Fort,
till at the last they made the enemy all retire from their Sconces, and
fortified places, leaving multitudes of their dead Bodyes upon the place.
<HI>Connecticut</HI> Souldiers marching up in the Reer, being not aware of the
dangerous passage over the tree, in Command of the enemyes Block∣house,
were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their first entrance many of them shot down, although
they came on with as gallant resolution as any of the rest under the con∣duct
of their wise and valiant Leader, Major <HI>Treat</HI></P>
<P>The brunt of the Battle, or danger that day lay most upon the Com∣manders,
whose part it was to lead on their several Companies in the
very face of Death, or else all had been lost; so as all of them with
great valour and resolution of minde, as not at all afraid to dy in so good
a cause, bravely lod on their men in that desperate ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ult; l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving their
lives in the place as the best testimony of their valour, and of love to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use of God and their Country: No less then six brave Captains fell
<PB N="53" REF="000231_0065_0FA9AC1335026770"/>
that day in the assault, <HI>viz.</HI> Capt. <HI>Davenport,</HI> Capt. <HI>Gardner,</HI> Capt. <HI>Iohn∣son</HI>
of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> besides Lieute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. <HI>Vpham,</HI> who died some
months after of his wounds received at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time. Capt. <HI>Gallop</HI> also,
and Capt. <HI>Siely,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Marshal</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of those that belonged to
<HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony. It is usually seen that the valour of the Souldiers
is much wrapped up in the lives of their Commanders, yet was it found
here, that the Souldiers were rather enraged then discouraged by the
loss of their Commanders, which made them redouble their Courage,
and not give back after they were entred the second time, till they had
driven out their Enemies: So as after much blood and many wounds
dealt on both sides; the English seeing their advantage, began to fire
the Wigwams, where was supposed to be many of the Enemies Women
and Children destroyed, by the firing of at least five or six hundred of
those smoaky Cells.</P>
<P>It is reported by them that first entred the <HI>Indians Fort,</HI> that our
Souldiers came upon them when they were ready to dress their Dinner,
but our sudden; and une<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pected assault put them besides that work,
making their Cookrooms too hot for them at that time, when they and
their Mitchin fryed together: and probably some of them eat their
Suppers in a colder place that night: most of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Provision as well as
their Hutts being then consumed with fire, and those that were left alive
forced to hide themselves in a Cedar Swamp, not far off, where they had
nothing to defend them from the cold but Boughs of Spruce and Pine
Trees: for after two or three hours fight, the English became Masters
of the place, but not judging it tenable, after they had burned all they
could set fire upon, they were forced to retreat, after the Day-light was
almost quite spent, and were necessitated to retire to their quarters, full
fifteen or sixteen miles off, some say more, whither with their Dead and
Wounded men they were to march, a difficulty scarce to be believed, as
not to be paralleld almost in any former age.</P>
<P>It is hard to say who acquitted themselves best in that dayes service,
either the Souldiers for their manlike valour in fighting, or the Com∣manders
for their wisdome and courage leading on in very face of death;
There might one have seen the whole Body of that little Regimental Ar∣my,
as busie as Bees in a Hive, some bravely fighting with the Enemy, o∣thers
haling off, and carrying away the Dead and Wounded Men (which
I rather note) that none may want the due testimony of their valour
and faithfulness, though all ought to say, <HI>not unto us, but unto thy Name,
O Lord,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>For though there might not be above three or four hundred at any
<PB N="54" REF="000231_0066_0FA9AC1459F30D18"/>
time within the Fort at once, yet the rest in their turns came up to do
what the exigence of the service required in bringing off the Dead and
Wounded men: The Major of the Regiment, together with Captain
<HI>Mosely,</HI> was very serviceable, for by that means the Fort being clear of
the Dead bodies, it struck a greater terrour into the Enemy, to see but
eight or ten dead bodies of the English left, then to meet with so many
hundreds of their own slain and wounded Carkasses. The number of
the slain was not then known on the Enemies side, because our Men
were forced to leave them on the ground: but our victory was found
afterwards to be much more considerable then at the first was apprehen∣ded;
for although our loss was very great, not only because of the
desperateness of the attempt it self) in such a season of the year, and at
such a distance from our quarters, whereby many of our wounded men
perished, which might otherwise have been preserved, if they had not
been forced to march so many miles in a cold snowy night, before they
could be dressed) yet the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemy lost so many of their principal fight∣ing
men, their Provision also was by the burning of their Wigwams, so
much of it spoiled, at the taking of their Fort, and by surprizing so
much of their Corn about that time also; that it was the occasion of
their total ruine afterwards: they being at that time driven away from
their habitations, and put by from Planting for that next year, as well as
deprived of what they had in store for the present winter. What num∣bers
of the Enemy were slain is uncertain, it was confessed by one <HI>Potock</HI>
a great Councellor amongst them, afterwards taken at <HI>Road-Island,</HI>
and put to Death at <HI>Boston,</HI> that the Indians lost seven hundred fighting
men that day, besides three hundred that dyed of their Wounds the most
of them: the number of old men, women and children, that perished
either by fire, or that were starved with hunger and cold, none of them
could tell. There was above eighty of the English slain, and a hundred
and fifty wounded, that recovered afterwards.</P>
<P>There were several circumstances in this Victory very remarkable.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The meeting with one <HI>Peter</HI> a fugitive Indian, that upon
some discontent, flying from the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> offered himself to the
service of the English, and did faithfully perform what he promised, <HI>viz.</HI>
to lead them to the Swamp where the Indians had seated themselves
within a Fort raised upon an Island of firm Earth, in the midst of a
Swamp, whither none of the English could have Piloted them, without
his assistance, the place being near eighteen miles from the place where
they were quartered.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There being by a special providence directed just to a place
<PB N="55" REF="000231_0067_0FA9AC184378BF88"/>
where they found so easie entrance, which if they had missed ▪ they could
never have made a way through the Hedge, with which they had sur∣rounded
the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lizadoes of the Fort in half a dayes time.</P>
<P>And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> If they had entred by the way left by the Indians for
passage, they might have been cut off, before they could have come near
their Fortification.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> In directing their motion, to begin the Assault just at the day
they did, for if they had deferred but a day longer, there fell such a storm
of Snow the next day, that they could not have passed through it, in di∣vers
weeks after: A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d then on the sudden there fell such a Thaw, that
melted away both Ice and Snow, so that if they had deferred till that
time, they could have found no p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge into their fortified place.</P>
<P>All w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich considerations put toge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her, make it a signal favour of God
to carry th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m through so many difficulties to accomplish their desired
end. For af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er they were retired from their quarters, but sixteen miles
from that p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was so great want of Provision, the Vessels being
frozen in at the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bour about <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> that should have brought
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> elief, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Frost and Snow set in so violently, that it was not
p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for them, with all the Force they could make (so many of their
ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Souldiers b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing slain and wounded) to have made another onset:
But the goodness of Almighty God was most of all to be admired, that
notwithstanding, all the hardship they indured that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in very cold
Lodgings, hard Marches, Scarcity of Provision, yet not one man was
known to dy by any disease or bodily distemper, save them that perished
of their wounds.</P>
<P>Our Forces being compelled by the foresaid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccasions, to ly still some
Weeks after, hoping also that the Enemy so sorely broken, would gladly
have sued for peace: But as was said of old, <HI>God hardned their hearts to
their own ruine and destruction afterwards.</HI> For as soon as our Souldiers
were able to March, finding that all the Enemies overtures of peace, and
prolonging of treaties, was only to gain time that they might get away
into the Woods. They pursued after them, and sometimes came upon
their Rear, but then they would immediately fly an hundred wayes at
once into Swamps, so as our men could not follow them, or if they did,
could not see two of them together ▪ so that now there was little good
like to be done, unless they could take them at some advantage. At
length having spent all their Provision, and tiring themselves in pursuing
of them six<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y or seventy miles, up thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh the Woods towards <HI>Malbe∣rough</HI>
and <HI>Lancaster,</HI> Towns that ly in the Road to <HI>Connecticot,</HI> having
killed and taken near seventy of them: our Souldiers were ordered to
<PB N="56" REF="000231_0068_0FA9AC19A2E03CE8"/>
return towards <HI>Boston,</HI> to recruit themselves, supposing that the <HI>Nar∣rhagansets,</HI>
and those with them were so enfeebled that they would have
no mind suddenly to assault any of the Engiish Towns.</P>

<P>If there had not been so great a distance between the place of the
fight and their Quarters, and so much cold attending them in their reti∣ring
thereunto, some better account might have been given of that ex∣pedition,
then now they were able to do. For a March of sixteen or
eighteen miles is too much to breathe a fresh Souldier, unless he were
well mounted, but enough to kill the heart of them that have been wea∣ried
with a long and tedious fight. As for the coldn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss of the weather,
although it be a good Be some to sweep the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ber of the Air (which
might be the reason there was no more Diseases amongst them) yet it
is an unwelcome Companion to wearied, especially to wounded men, in
so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong a Retreat.</P>
<P>But the want of Provision falling in conjunction with the unseasona∣bleness
of the Weather, and length of the way hindred our Forces from
<PB N="57" REF="000231_0069_0FA9AC1A033647E8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> attempt upon the enemy, which if they could have attended, it
was thought it might have put an end to our troubles; but he that hold∣eth
the scales of victory in his hand, turneth them to which side, and by
what degrees pleaseth himself best.</P>
<P>The rest of the winter was spent in fruitless Treaties about a peace,
both sides being well wearied with the late desperate Fight, were willing
to refresh themselves the remaining part of the winter, with the short
slumber of a pretended peace, at least with a talk or Dream thereof:
our Commanders aim therein was Christian and good, if it had proceed∣ed,
<HI>sc.</HI> to have prevented the shedding of more bloud: And possibly
some of the elder and wiser of the enemy, did really desire what was
pretended by them all, (for they had now full proof of the valour and
resolution of the <HI>English,</HI> which some of them upon former successes
might be ready to question) and they could not but see their destruction
already begun, in the loss of their dwellings, and all their provision, as
well as the slaughter of the best part of their fighting men; but either
through consciousness of their barbarous treachery, and falshood they
could not trust others, and so were willing to run the utmost hazard, as
people hardned to their own destruction. The particular passages of
the treaty being carried on by the enemy only in pretence, and by our
men (that soon discerned their fraud) rather out of nece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty, to con∣ceal
their incapacity of engaging them anew, then any real expectation
of a good effect, are not worthy the relating. However though the
Foot were unable to doe any Service in the depth of the snow, &amp; sharp∣ness
of the cold, The Troop was sent out upon all occasions to scout a∣bout
the Country, who brought in daily much of the enemies corn and
Beans, which they had hid in Barns under the ground, or at least kept
them from making use of their own provision, or spoiling the English
Cattle; now and then also bringing in Prisoners from their Quarters,
as they were stragling about to get victuals.</P>
<P>On the twenty seventh of <HI>December,</HI> Capt. <HI>Prenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> was sent into
<HI>Pom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ams Country,</HI> where they burnt near an hundred Wigwams, but
found never an <HI>Indian</HI> in any of them.</P>
<P>On the <HI>28th,</HI> of <HI>December</HI> a Squaw was sent to them, who had been
taken in the Fight, with a pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er of Peace, if they would submit to such
Tearms as were propounded; the principal of which was, the delive∣ring
up all <HI>Philips</HI> Indians that were with them; The Squaw returned not
pretending that she was lame and unable to come again; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the thirtieth
of <HI>December,</HI> an Indian came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nom the Sachems with seeming thanks for
the peace profered, yet complained, we made war upon them and gave
<PB N="58" REF="000231_0070_0FA9AC1AC4A80FF8"/>
them no notice; but his mouth was soon stopped, by the answer which
was made him: he owned, as the Squaw had said before, that they lost
three hundred of their best fighting men, and so did two Prisoners of
theirs taken <HI>Ianuary</HI> the <HI>4th,</HI> whereof one being of <HI>Philips</HI> Company
was put to death. The Messenger that was sent was fairly dismissed,
with the express mention of what tearm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they must expect, if they desi∣red
a peace.</P>
<P><HI>Ian.</HI> There came two Messengers from them, as they said
to make way for a treaty of Peace; who laid the blame upon <HI>Canonchet,</HI>
that came down to <HI>Boston,</HI> in <HI>October</HI> last, to confirm the peace with the
Commissioners of the united Colonyes, as if he had misinformed them;
<HI>viz.</HI> that they were not by the former treaty to have delivered up the
<HI>Mompanoogs,</HI> or <HI>Philips Indians,</HI> untill the said <HI>Canonchets</HI> Brother
one of the Hostages at <HI>Hartford,</HI> was released. This was but a meer
pretence, for he and they too better understood the particulars of the
agreement: For by chance the Articles which they had of the peace con∣cluded
with them were found open (whether purposely or accidentally
was not known) in a Wigwam in the Fort when it was taken, so as they
could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot be ignorant of the Articles of the Agreement</P>
<P><HI>Ian.</HI> 5. An English child of about three or four years old, taken
from <HI>Warwick,</HI> was sent in to put the better pretence upon the treaty
mentione<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P><HI>Ian.</HI> 8. The Messengers were sent back, and told what they must
trust to. In the afternoon a Messenger came from <HI>Ninigrtt</HI> the old Sa∣chem
of <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> who brought a letter from Mr. <HI>Stanton</HI> the In∣terpreter,
signifying the reallity of the said <HI>Ninigret</HI> his friendship to
the English, and the streights of the enemy, that co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n was two shillings
a pint with them. Yet notwithstanding all their difficultyes, they ra∣ther
delayed the time till they could get away, then really endeavoured
the making a peace, as was soon manife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> For that young insolent Sa∣chem
<HI>Canonchet,</HI> and <HI>Panoquin,</HI> said they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uld fight it out to the last
man, rather then they would become Servants to the English.</P>
<P><HI>Ian.</HI> 10. Fresh supplyes of souldiers came up from <HI>Boston,</HI> wading
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrough a sharp storm of snow, that bit some of them by the heels with
th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> frost. The next day one that came with them going out with the
Scouts, fell amongst the Indians Barns, in one of which, as he was gro∣ping
to find corn for the relief of his horse, he catched hold of an Indi∣ans
hair under the leaves, who presently held up his hands, when the
souldier was drawing his sword, to spare his life, which was granted; but
after he was brought to the Head-quarters, he would owne nothing
<PB N="59" REF="000231_0071_0FA9AC1B84B093A8"/>
but what was forced out of his mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, by the woolding of his head with
a cord, wherefore he was presently judged to dye as a <HI>Wompanoog.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ian.</HI> 12. Another Messenger came from <HI>Canonicus,</HI> desiring the
space of a month longer, wherein to issue the treaty, which so provoked
the Commander of our Forces, that they resolved to have no more
Treatyes with the enemy; but prepare to assault them, with Gods assi∣stance
as soon as ever the season would permit; and it was high time to
take up that resolution, for within a few dayes after, they understood by
some that were taken Prisoners; that the enemy were gone, or going in∣to
the <HI>Nipmuck Country.</HI></P>
<P>Within a few dayes after, about the <HI>16th. Ian.</HI> the scouts brought in
one <HI>Ioshuah Tift</HI> a Renegado English-ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, of <HI>Providence,</HI> that upon
some discontent amongst his neighbours, had turned Indian, married
one of the <HI>Indian Squaws,</HI> renounced his Rellgion, nation and natural
Parents all at once, fighting against them. He was taken by
Capt. <HI>Fenner</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> who with some of his neighbours were pur∣suing
some <HI>Indians</HI> that had driven away their Cattle, This <HI>Tift</HI> being
one of the Company was wounded in the knee, and so was seized by the
English▪ he had in his hab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t conformed himself to them amongst whom he
lived. After ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mination he was condemned to dy the death of a Traitor.
As to his Religion he was found as ignorant as an Heathen, which no
doubt caused the fewer tears to be shed at his Funeral, standers by being
unwilling to lavish pitty upon him that had divested himself of nature
it self, as well as Religion, in a time when so much pitty was needed else∣where,
and nothing left besides wherewith to relieve the Sufferers.</P>
<P><HI>Ian.</HI> 21. Capt. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>entice</HI> his Troop being abroad met with a Party
of the enemy, of whom they took two Prisoners and killed nine; in
which exploit, something hapned very remarkable, for one <HI>W. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge</HI>
of <HI>Salem</HI> riding in company with another Friend, they hapned to meet
with two Indians, the said <HI>Dodge</HI> being better horsed then his friend,
made after the foremost, leaving hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> friend to deal with the hindmost,
but his Pistol missed firing, whereupon the <HI>Indian</HI> taking him by the leg
turn'd him off his horse, and getting upon him was about killing him
with his knife, which <HI>W. Dodge</HI> by chance espyed, and came time e∣nough
to rescue his friend, and dispatch the <HI>Indian</HI> lying upon him, and
yet overtook the first <HI>Indian</HI> he was pursuing, time enough to doe his
business also: by that meanes he did three good offices at once, saved
the life of one Friend, and slew two of his Enemyes. But within two or
three dayes after, the weather much altering from what it was, induced
our Forces to take the first opportunity to pursue the enemy, who as
<PB N="60" REF="000231_0072_0FA9AC1C720F1428"/>
understood by Messengers from <HI>Providence,</HI> were now upon their flight
into the <HI>Nipmuck Country:</HI> But so many difficultyes were cast in their
way, that they could not be ready time enough to prevent the mischief
they did at <HI>Warwick,</HI> as they took their Farewell of their Country: For,</P>
<P><HI>Ian.</HI> 27. They dispoyled Mr. <HI>Carpenter</HI> of two hundred sheep, and
fifty head of Neat Cattle, and fifteen horses; all which they drove along
with them, and were gone too far to be rescued before our Forces set
out. Two that belonged to the said <HI>Carpenter</HI> were wounded, and one
of the enemies slain. As they marched after the enemy, they found a
good house burned, with a barn belonging to it. They perceived also
that the enemy dealt much in Horse-flesh, meeting with no less then
sixty horses heads, in one place which they had left behind them. Our
Souldiers in their pursuit came upon their Reer, killed and took about
seventy of them, yet never could come to charge them, for they would
presently betake themselves into Swamps, and not two of them run to∣gether,
so as they saw it was an endless work to proceed further in the
chase of such an enemy; but our Forces having pursued them into the
woods between <HI>Marlberough</HI> and <HI>Brookfield</HI> in the Road toward <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣necticut,</HI>
were constrained to turn down to <HI>Boston</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI>
for want of provision, both for themselves and their horses, which
gave an occasion to the losse of those lesser Towns that were destroy∣ed
by the <HI>Nipnet Indians</HI> who presently joyned with the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI>
upon their first approach, as shall be related after wards.</P>
<P>About the tenth of <HI>February</HI> next, some hundreds of the Indians whe∣ther
<HI>Nipnets</HI> or <HI>Nashaway</HI> men (is uncertain) belonging to him, they
call <HI>Sagamore Sam,</HI> and possibly some of the sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>test of the <HI>Nar∣rhagansets</HI>
that had escaped the Winter brunt fell upon <HI>Lancaster</HI>
a small Village of about fifty or sixty Families, and did much mischief,
burning most of the Houses that were not Garisoned: and which is
most sad and awful to consider, the House of Mr. <HI>Rowlandson,</HI> Minister
of the said <HI>Lancaster,</HI> which was Garisoned with a competent number of
the Inhabitants▪ yet the Fortification of the House being on the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck
side, closed up with Fire-wood, the Indians got so near, as to fire a Lean∣too,
which burning the House immediately to the ground, all the per∣sons
therein, were put to that hard choice, either to perish by the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes
with the House, or to yield themselves into the hands of those cruel
<HI>Salvages,</HI> which last (considering that a living Dog is better then a dead
Lyon) they chose, and so were forty two persons surprised by the In∣dians,
above twenty of the Women and Children they carried away
Captive, a ruesul spectacle to behold, the rest being Men, they killed in
<PB N="61" REF="000231_0073_0FA9AC1CF6807808"/>
the place, and reserved for further misery: and many of the rest were
not slain in fighting, were killed in attempting to escape. The Minister
himself was occasionally a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sent, to seek help from the Governour and
Council, to defend that place, who returning, was entertained with the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ragical news of his Wife and Children surprized, and being carried a∣way
by the Enemies, and his House turned into Ashes, yet it pleased God
so to uphold his heart, comforting himself in his God, as <HI>David</HI> at <HI>Zik∣lag,</HI>
that he would alwayes say, <HI>he believed he should see his Wife and Chil∣dren
again,</HI> which did in like manner soon come to pass within five
or six months after; all save the youngest, which being wounded at the
first, died soon after among the Indians.</P>
<P>And such was the goodness of God to those poor Captive Women,
and Children, that they found so much favour in the sight of their Ene∣mies,
that they offered no wrong to any of their persons, save what they
could not help, being in many wants themselves. Neither did they of∣fer
any uncivil Carriage to any of the Females, nor ever attempted the
chastity of any of them, either being restrained of God, as was <HI>Abi∣melek</HI>
of old, or by some other accidental cause, withheld them from do∣ing
any wrong in that kind.</P>
<P>Upon the report of this Disaster Capt. <HI>Wadsworth</HI> then at <HI>Malbe∣rough</HI>
with about forty resolute men, adventuring the rescuing of the
Town that was remaining: and having recovered a Bridge they gat o∣ver
safe, though the Planks were pulled off by the Enemy, and being led
up in a way, not discovered by them, they forced the Indians for the pre∣sent
to quit the place, after they had burnt and destroyed the better half
of it. Yet afterwards it not being judged tenable, it was abandoned
to the pleasure of the insulting Foe.</P>
<P>Ten dayes after they were so flushed with this success, that two or
three hundred of them came wheeling down to <HI>Medfield</HI> a Town twen∣ty
miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> westward from <HI>Dedham,</HI> which they surprized ve∣ry
early in the morning (and though there were one hundred and sixty
Souldiers in it or more, besides the Inhabitants) they burnt near one
half of the Town, killing about twenty persons, but by the resistance of
the Souldiers, as soon as ever they could be gotten together (it being at
or before break of day, none in the least s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>specting such an assault so
early) they were quickly forced to forsake the place, and so (not with∣out
some loss) took their way to <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony.</P>
<P>The Western Towns above Connecticut, were the chief Seat of the
War, and felt most of the mischiefs ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of in the end of the year 1675.
but the Scene is now to be changed; and the other Towns and the Vil∣lages
<PB N="62" REF="000231_0074_0FA9AC1E9B05D0F0"/>
that ly Eastward nearer <HI>Boston,</HI> must bare their part in the like
Tragedies: for as was said before, the <HI>Narrbagansets</HI> having been dri∣ven
out of the Country, fled through <HI>Nipnet Plantations,</HI> towards <HI>Wat∣ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>set
Hills</HI> meeting with all the Indians that had harboured all Winter
in those Woods about <HI>Nashaway,</HI> they all combined together against the
English, yet divided their numbers, and one half of them were obser∣ved
to bend their course toward <HI>Plimouth,</HI> taking <HI>Medfield</HI> in their
way, which they endeavoured to burn and spoile, <HI>Feb,</HI> 21. 1675. as their
fellows had done <HI>Lancaster</HI> ten dayes before.</P>
<P>The surprizal of this <HI>Medfield</HI> in regard of some remarkable circum∣stances
it was attended with, is not unworthy a more particular Relating
the manner thereof: the loss of <HI>Lancaster</HI> had sufficiently awakened and
alarmed the neighbouring Villages, all to stand upon their guard; and
some had obtained Garison Souldiers for their greater security, as was
the case with the Town of <HI>Medfield,</HI> within twenty two miles of <HI>Boston.</HI>
And at that time were lodged therein several Garison Souldiers, besides
the Inhabitants; yet being billated up &amp; down in all quarters of the town
could not be gathered together till a great part of the Town was set on
fire, and many of the Inhabitants slain, which how it could be effected is
strange to believe: But most of those inland Plantations being over run
with young wood (the Inhabitants being every where apt to engross
more Land into their hands then they were able to subdue) as if they
were seated in the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of a heap of Bushes: their Enemies took the
advantage thereof, and secretly over night, conveyed themselves round
about the Town, some getting under the sides of their B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rns and sences
of their Orchards, as is supposed, where they lay hid under that covert,
till break of day, when they suddenly set upon sundry Houses, shoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
them that came first out of their doors, and then fired their Houses,
especially those houses where the Inhabitants were repaired to Garisons,
were fit for the purpose: some were killed as they attempted to fly to
their Neigbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs for shelter: some were only wounded, and some taken
alive and carried Captive: in some Houses the Husband running away
with one childe, the wife with another, of whome the one was killed,
the other escaped: they began at the East end of the Town where they
fired the House of one <HI>Samuel Morse,</HI> that seems to have been a signal
to the rest to fall on in other parts: most of the Houses in the West or
Southwest end of the Town were soon burnt down: and generally when
they burnt any out houses, the Cattle in them were burnt also. Two
Mills belonging to the Town were burnt also: a poor old man of near
an hundred years old, was burnt in one of the Houses that were con∣sumed
<PB N="63" REF="000231_0075_0FA9AC1F7979D630"/>
by fire. The Lieutenant of the Town, <HI>Adams</HI> by name, was
shot down by his own door, and his Wise mortally wounded by a Gun
fired afterwards accidentally in the House. After the burning of forty
or fifty houses and barns, the <HI>Cannibals</HI> were frighted away out of the
Town over a Bridge that lies upon <HI>Charls-River,</HI> by the shooting off a
piece of Ordnance 2 or 3 times: when they had passed over the Bridge
they fired one end thereof, to hinder our men from pursuing them, they
were thought to be above five hundred: There were slain and mortal∣ly
wounded seventeen or eighteen persons, besides others dangerously
hurt. The loss sustained by the Inhabitants amounted to above two
thousand pounds. This mercy was observed in this sad providence, that
never a Garison house was lost in this surprisal; nor any of the princi∣pal
Dwellings, so as the chiefest and best of their Building escaped the
sury of the Enemy, who as they passed the Bridge left a writing behind
them, expressing something to this purpose, that we had provoked them
to wrath, and that they would fight with us this twenty years (but they
fell short of their expectation by nineteen) adding also, that they had
nothing to loose, whereas we had Houses, Barns and Corn: these were
some of the bold threats used by the barbarous crew, but their rage
shall proceed no further then the counsel of God had determined. The
week before was heard a very hideous cry of a kennel of Wolves round
the Town, which raised some of the Inhabitants, and was looked upon
by divers as an ominous presaging of this following Calamity.</P>
<P>Another assault was feared, but as soon as the Souldiers could be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣thered
together, they turned their backs, as if they never intended to
visit them more: whether these Indians went when they left <HI>Medfield</HI>
is not so certainly known; the Souldiers in the Town not having oppor∣tunity
to pursue them over the River, by reason that the Bridge was
part of it burned: but it is most probable that they took their way to∣ward
<HI>Plimouth,</HI> and continued about that side of the Country for the
future, waiting opportunities to do what mischief they could to the En∣glish
in those parts: For within a month after this assault of <HI>Medfield,</HI>
there was near six hundred of them seen about <HI>Patuxit</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI>
where Capt. <HI>Pierce</HI> with about fifty of his men were lost, though with
no great advantage to the Enemy, who at that time lost above double
that number: our worthy Captains in this and other exploits being
called to imitate <HI>Sampson,</HI> who was content to dye with his enemies, that
he might overthrow them thereby: it havin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g so fallen out with many
of our choice Commanders and Souldiers at <HI>Deerfield, Narrhaganse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
Patuxit,</HI> and likewise not long after at <HI>Sudbury.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="000231_0076_0FA9AC1FEFAF0800"/>
The Governour and Council of <HI>Plimouth</HI> perceiving by the report of
these outrages committed upon the Towns of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> that
they were like to be visited this Spring by their old Neighbours, sent out
Capt. <HI>Peirce</HI> of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ituate</HI> about the latter end of <HI>March,</HI> with about fifty
English, and twenty of their Christian Indians about <HI>Cape Cod</HI> who pro∣ved
none of his worst Souldiers, as the sequel of this his last expedition
will declare.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Pierce,</HI> as is said before, being sent out to pursue the Enemy,
marched towards <HI>Patuxit,</HI> where he understood the Indians were many
of them gathered together: he being a man of resolute courage, was
willing to engage them though upon never so great disadvantage: some
say the Indians by counterfeiting, drilled him into a kind of Ambush,
possibly more of them discovered themselves after he began to engage
then he was aware of: and being gotten over the River in pursuit of
them, where he discovered so great a number of them, he drew down
towards the side of the River, hoping the better by that means to pre∣vent
their surrounding of him, but that proved his overthrow, which
he intended as his greatest advantage: for the Indians getting over the
River, so galled him from thence, that he was not able to defend himself
thus assaulted on all sides, &amp; himself not being able to travel much a foot,
was thereby hindred from retiring to any better place in time; so as
he saw himself constrained to fight it out to the last; which he did with
most undaunted Courage, &amp; as is said, to the slaughter of an hundred &amp;
forty of his enemies, before himself and his Company were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut off. It
is said also that being apprehensive of the danger he was in, by the great
numbers of the enemy, like to overpovver him vvith their multitude, he
sent a Messenger timely enough to <HI>Providence,</HI> for relief, but, as <HI>Solomon</HI>
saith, <HI>A faithful Messenger is as Snow in harvest, another is as smoak to
the eyes and vinegar to the teeth.</HI> (vvhether through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loth or Covvardize,
is not much material) this message vvas not delivered to them to vvhom
it vvas immediately sent; by accident only some of <HI>Reh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>both</HI> understand∣ing
of the danger after the evening exercise (it being on the Lords day,
<HI>March</HI> 26. 1676.) repaired to the place, but then it was too late to
bring help, unless it vvere to be Spectators of the dead C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rkases of their
friends, and to perform the last office of love to them.</P>
<P>It is vvorth the noting, vvhat faithfulness and courage some of the
Christian <HI>Indians</HI> vvith the said Capt. <HI>Pierce</HI> shevved in the Fight: one
of them, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os</HI> by name, after the Captain vvas shot in his leg or thigh,
so as he was not able to stand any looger, would not leave him, but
cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging his gun several times, fired stoutly upon the enemy, till he
<PB N="65" REF="000231_0077_0FA9AC20B2D37D68"/>
saw that there was no possibility for him to do any further good to
Capt. <HI>Pierce,</HI> nor yet to save himself, if he stayed any longer; therefore he
used this policy, perceiving the Enemy had all blacked their faces, he also
stooping down, pulled out some blacking out of a pouch he carried with
him, discoloured his face therewith, and so making himself look as like
<HI>Hohamack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as any of his Enemies: he ran amongst them a little while
and was taken for one of themselves, as if he had been searching for the
English, until he had an opportunity to escape away among the Bushes:
ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> imitating the Cuttle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which when it is pursued, or in dang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,
casteth out of its body a thick humor, as black as ink, through which it
passes away unseen by the pursuer.</P>
<P>It is reported of another of these <HI>Cape Indians</HI> (Friends to the En∣glish
of <HI>Pli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outh</HI>) that being pursued by one of the Enemies, he be∣took
himself to a great Rock, where he sheltred himself for a while. at
last perceiving that his Enemy lay ready with his Gun on the other side,
to discharge upon him, as soon as he stir'd never so little away from the
place where he stood: in the issue he thought of this politick Strata∣gem
to save himself, and destroy his Enemy, (for as <HI>Solomon</HI> said of old,
<HI>Wisd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me is better then Weapons of War:</HI>) he took a stick, and hung his Hat
upon it, and then by degrees gently lifted it up, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thought it would
be seen, and so become a fit mark for the other that watched to take aym
at him: the other taking it to be his head, fired a Gun, and shot through
the Hat; which our Christian Indian perceiving, boldly held up his head
and discharged his own Gun upon the real head, not the hat of his Ad∣versary,
whereby he shot him dead upon the place, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad liberty to
march away with the spoils of of his Enemy.</P>
<P>The like subtle device was used by another of the <HI>Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Indians</HI> at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

not so easily discern him; a good Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ketier need never desire a

down: what can be more just then that he should himself be killed who

<PB N="68" REF="000231_0080_0FA9AC25F1D86810"/>
that the Ring-leader of almost all this mischief, and great Incendiary
betwixt the <HI>Narhagansets</HI> and us, dyed himself by that sword of warre
which he had drawn against others.</P>

<P>The greatest mischief which after this time was done by the enemy in

houses for their greater security: For about the <HI>20th.</HI> of <HI>April,</HI>
fifty of the enemy burnt about nineteen houses and barns at <HI>Scituate,</HI>
but were so resolutely encountred by a few of the Inhabitants, that they
were driven away, and thereby prevented from doing of further mis∣chief.</P>
<P>Not long after, <HI>May.</HI> 8. they burned about seventeen houses and
barns in <HI>Briage-water,</HI> a small town in <HI>Plimouth Colony,</HI> twenty seven

Thunder shower, which put out the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, or else it might have prevailed
much further.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that the Inhabitants of the said <HI>Bridge-water</HI>
never yet lost one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the sword of the enemy▪ though the town
is scituate within <HI>Plimouth Colony,</HI> yet have they helped to destroy many
of the enemy <HI>None knowes either love or hatred by all that is before them</HI>

themselves less sinners then those that so perish by the sword of
the enemy: Yet about this time four of the Inhab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nts of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> were

And because special notice is taken of the Town of <HI>Bridge-water,</HI> the
which although it is seated, as it were, in the midst of danger, and hath
been often assaulted by considerable numbers of the Enemy, yet never
lost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any one of their Inhabitants, young or old; a particular account
shall here be given of the most remarkable passages of divine providence
relating to that Plantation since the War began. <HI>Iune</HI> 26 1675 When
<HI>Philips</HI> malice against the English, mixed with a particular prejudice
against Governour <HI>Winsl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w,</HI> began to boyl up to the height of
an open Rebellion, the people of <HI>Swanzy</HI> being like to be distressed by
the Indians, a Post was instantly sent to the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI>
the way lying through <HI>Bridge water,</HI> the said Post returned the next day:
and about 9 or 10 of the clock, as he passed through the Town, left an
Order from the Governour for the raising of twenty men, well armed
and furnished with Horses, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forthwith dispatched away for the re∣lief
of <HI>Swanzy;</HI> seventeen were all that could be raised on the sudden,
who were sent thither that night, and were the first that were upon their
ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch in all the Country; and possibly they fared not the worse for
their forwardness: as <HI>Deborah</HI> the Proph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tess, blessed God for them
<HI>that offered themselves willingly among the People:</HI> These seventeen of
<HI>Bridgewater</HI> were <HI>Iune</HI> 21. ordered by Capt. <HI>Bradford</HI> to <HI>Metapoisit</HI> a
place at twelve miles distance from <HI>Swanzy,</HI> to strengthen the Garison
at one <HI>Bourns</HI> House, wherein were seventy persons, amongst whom
were only found sixteen men. After they had ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched five miles of their
way, having Mr. <HI>Browns</HI> Son for their Pilot, they met with some <HI>Swan∣zy</HI>
people, newly turned out of their Houses (by which they were to
pass) who having not as yet resisted unto Blood, yet made doleful la∣mentations,
wringing of their hands; and bewailing of their losses, ve∣ry
much also perswading <HI>Bridge-water</HI> men to turn back, because of
the danger, but they having so clear a call, had also more cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age, then
cowardly to desert the cause of God and his People, left they should
the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eby betray the lives of so many of their friends into the Enemies
hands; and so by the good hand of God towards them, came safe to
<HI>Metapoiset</HI> that night.</P>
<P>The next day in the morning, a part of them went to guard Mr.
<HI>Brown</HI> their Pilot back to his quarters; in their return they came sud∣denly
upon a party of Indians, about thirty in all; they were within
shot one of another, but the English having no Commission to fight, till
they were assaulted, and not being impeached in their passage, they re∣turned
safe to their Garison at <HI>Metapoiset:</HI> the Indians presently draw∣ing
off, and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing three Guns (though not with intent to do them any
<PB N="70" REF="000231_0082_0FA9AC276D26BB28"/>
hurt, as was conceived) gave a shout, and so left them, when this party
of the English drew near to their Garison, they met with a company of
Carts going to fetch Corn from an house deserted near by, about a
quarter of a mile off from Mr. <HI>Bournes</HI> House, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Souldiers gave them
notice of the Indians which they had discovered, and withal advised them
by no means to venture any more, because of the danger; but they
were resolved notwithstanding these earnest perswasions of the Souldi∣ers
to have another turn, which they soon found to be to the peril of
their own lives, six of them being presently after either killed right out,
or mortally wounded, as soon as they came to the Barn where was the
Corn; these six are said to be the first that were slain in this quarrel.
The Souldiers at the Garison hearing the Guns, made what haste they
could to the place, but being most of them in that interim, gone to look
their Horses they could not come time enough to the relief of their
friends, yet upon their approach, they who had done the mischief pre∣sently
fled away: one <HI>Iones</HI> hard pursued by two Indians was by their
coming delivered from the extent of the Enemies cruelty, but having
received his mortal wound, had only that favour thereby, to dy in the
Arms of his friends, though by the wounds received from his Enemies.</P>
<P>The next week, fifteen of those Souldiers looking after their Horses,
fell into an Ambush of twenty of the Indians, but being prepared for
the encounter, they discharged their Guns upon each other: but ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
men received no hurt, some of them felt the winde of the bullets passing
by their faces; what damage the Enemy received is uncertain, yet some
of the English report they found some of their enemies dead bodies in
the place afterward.</P>
<P>Thus were they not only preserved in many perils themselves, but be∣came
instrumental also; for the preservation of most of that Garison,
who with their goods by their means, with the help of a small party of
<HI>Plimouth</HI> Forces sent thither after the six were killed (as is mentioned
before) were soon after transported safely to <HI>Road-Island.</HI></P>
<P>Many outrages were that Summer committed upon their Neighbours
at <HI>Taunton</HI> and <HI>Namasket,</HI> yet it pleased God to protect this poor Town
of <HI>Bridge-water</HI> from any other hurt; till the beginning of <HI>April</HI> next,
when themselves with their Neighbours of <HI>Taunton</HI> and <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> were
strongly solicited to desert their Dwellings, and repair down to the
Towns by the Sea side, but God encouraged them to keep their stations
notwithstanding the extream danger then presented. It is reported
that <HI>Philip</HI> gave order that <HI>Taunton</HI> and <HI>Bridge-water</HI> should not be de∣stroyed
till the last, which is all the favour to be expected from an enemy,
<PB N="71" REF="000231_0083_0FA9AC2789005A10"/>
but these things are only in the hands of God, and not to be determi∣ned
by man.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 9. being Lords day, A small party of the Enemy came down
upon the said <HI>Bridge-water,</HI> burnt an out-house and barn, broke up and
rifled several other houses in the same quarter of the Town, which are
notwithstanding yet remaining; they sent out a party of their men to
pursue them that night, and many dayes after, but could not hear of
them.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 7 the Lords day also (no doubt but the betterness of the day,
will increase the badness of their deed attempted thereon) they had in∣telligence
of a great body of Indians dispersed that way, with intent to
have fallen upon the Town that ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ay, but were casually prevented by
a great deal of rain that fell the night before: however they were re∣solved
to foreslow no opportunity, wherefore on the next day (<HI>May</HI> 8.
about three hundred of them, one <HI>Tisg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogen</HI> being their chief Leader,
at 8 or 9 in the morning made an assault upon the east end of the Town,
on the South side of the River: many of the Inhabitants stayed at home
that morning because of the intelligence the day before, and so were the
more ready to entertain them; some that not taking that warning ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tu∣red
into the field about their occasions, were in danger of surprizal, but
by the special favour of God, escaped, and came time enough to help de∣fend
their own and their neighbours dwellings, being shot at, and hard
pursued a considerable way.</P>
<P>The Indians presently began to fire the town, but it pleased God so
to spirit and encourage several of the Inhabitants, issuing out of their Ga∣rison
houses; that they fell upon them with great resolution, and beat
them off; at the same instant of time, the Lord of Hosts also fighting for
them from heaven, by sending a storm of thunder and rain very season∣ably,
which prevented the burning of the houses which were fired: The
Souldiers also fighting under the banner of Gods special protection
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so successful in repelling the Enemy, that they neither had any of
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken, and but one wounded. The Indians by
this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> resi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance, being beaten off to the skirts of the Town, made a
fresh onset upon a other quarter thereof, on the north side of the River
where they had done much more mischief, but that God stirred up sun∣dry
of the people to venture out of their fortified houses, who fired upon
the enemy, and beat them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom their dwellings, so as in the evening they
drew off to an out-house, three miles distant from the town: the next day
the Inhabitants expected another assault, but the enemy having burned
the house &amp; barn, where they kept their Rendezvouze over night, &amp; one
<PB N="72" REF="000231_0084_0FA9AC28351F9048"/>
house more not far distant, they marched all clear away for that time.</P>
<P>Thus it pleased God so to order his dispensations, toward this small
Town, as a brand plucked out of the fire, that they did but just taste of
this bitter cup, which others drank deeper of; yet had they not such mer∣cy,
as these had, mixed therewith: under God, the courage of the In∣habitants
was a great means of their preservation, for they fired so
stoutly upon the Enemies, that they durst not come very near any of the
Garisoned Houses, saluting them only at a distance. God was eminent∣ly
seen upholding the spirits of all sorts, men and women, so as no con∣sternation
of minde was seen upon any of them, during the whole time
of the dispute.</P>
<P>In this assault they lost but thirteen dwelling-houses, whereof five
only were in the Town (the rest being out-houses and deserted for the
present) with some few Barns, and some of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cattle; all which
was a very inconsiderable loss, in comparison of what befell others, and
themselves might have endured, if God had not by his special favour pre∣vented,</P>
<P><HI>Iuly 14, &amp;</HI> 15. Another party of Indians came down upon the
North-west side of the Town, but with no better success; for they had
no Commission from the Lord of Hosts to touch any of the persons of
the Inhabitants, their power reaching only to the slaying of their
Cattle at this time.</P>
<P><HI>Iuly</HI> 18, 19, 20. They sent our parties after the Enemy to pursue
them by their Track, who fell upon some of them. On the twentieth
they took sixteen, whereof two were men: on this day they had to assist
them, it seems some of the Bay Indians sent them from Captain <HI>Brattle;</HI>
some of the Captives informed, that there were but 70 or 80. in the
Company, and but ten or twelve men amongst them: but within a few
dayes, these <HI>Bridge-water-men,</HI> shall finde better success in pursuit of
their Enemies, when <HI>Philip</HI> himself shall hardly escape their hands as
shall be seen afterwards.</P>
<P>While one party of the Enemy thus acted their part in and about
<HI>Plimouth Colony▪</HI> towards the Sea-coast, other parties of them were not
idle in the <HI>Massachusets Colony,</HI> where they assaulted many places, doing
what mischief they could by firing of Houses, and killing several persons
in the inland Plantations.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 2. They assaulted <HI>Groton:</HI> the next day over night Major <HI>Wil∣lard</HI>
with seventy Horse came into the Town; forty Foot also came up
to their relief from <HI>Watertown,</HI> but the Indians were all fled, having
first burned all the Houses in the Town, sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> four that were Garisoned,
<PB N="73" REF="000231_0085_0FA9AC29CAC55AD0"/>
the Meeting-house being the second house they fired, Soon after Capt. <HI>Sill</HI>
was sent with a small Party of Dragoons of 8 Files to fetch off the Inhabi∣tants
of <HI>Groton,</HI> and what was left from the spoyle of the enemy, having
under his conduct about sixty Carts, being in depth from front to reer
above two mile: when a party of Indians lying in ambush, at a place
of eminent advantage, fired upon the front and mortally wounded two
of the vaunt Carriers, who dyed both the next night; and might (had
God permitted) have done eminent damage to the whole Body, it being
a full hour before the whole Body could be drawne up, which was done
with care and Courage: but the Indians after a few more shot made▪
without doing harm, retired, and made no further assault upon them,
being the same Party of <HI>Indians</HI> which the day before had burned some
part of <HI>Chelmsford.</HI> Soon after this Village was deserted and destroy∣ed
by the enemy: yet was it a special providence, that though the carts
were guarded with so slender a Convoy, yet there was not any conside∣rable

sad Catastrophe of <HI>Lancaster</HI> the next bordering town) gathered into
five Garisons, four of which were so near together, as to be a∣ble
to command from one to the other, between which were the cattle
belonging to those Families driven into pastures, which afterward pro∣ved
their preservation; the other was near a mile distant from the rest.</P>

This morning the <HI>Indians</HI> (having in the night placed themselves in se∣veral
parts of the town) made their Onset; which began near the four
Garisons; for a body of them having placed themselves in Ambuscado,
behind a hill, near one of the Garisons, two of them made discovery
of themselves, as if they had stood upon discovery. At this time divers
of the people, nothing suspecting any such matter (for the day before,
many had been upon discovery many miles, and found no signs of an
Enemy being so near) were attending their occasions, some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ddering
their cattle, some milking their Cows, of whom the Enemy might easily
have made a seizure, but God prevented; they having another design in
hand, as soon after appeared: These two Indians were at length espyed,
and the Alarm given▪ whereupon the most of the men in the next Gari∣son,
and some also of the second (which was about eight or nine pole di∣stant)
drew out and went to surprize these two <HI>Indians,</HI> who kept their
station till our men reached the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow of the hill, then arose the ambush
and discharged a volley upon them, which caused a disorderly retreat,
or rather a rout, in which one was slain, and three others wounded:
mean while another ambush had risen, and come upon the back side of
the Garison so deserted of men, and pulled down the Palizadoes: The
Souldiery in this rout, retreated not to their own, but passed by to the
next Garison, the women and children mean while exposed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>azard,
but by the goodness of God made a safe escape to the other fortified
house without any harm, leaving their substance to the enemy, who
made a prey of it, and spent the residue of the day in removing the corn
and houshold-stuff (in which loss five Familyes were impoverished) and
firing upon the other Garison: here also they took some Cattle. No
sooner was the signal given by the first volley of shot, but immediately
in several parts of the town at once, did the smoakes arise, they firing the
houses.</P>
<P>In the afternoon they used a stratagem not unlike the other, to have
surprised the single Garison, but God prevented. An old <HI>Indian</HI> if an
<HI>Indian</HI> passed along the street with a black sheep on his back, with a slow
pace, as one decrepit: They made several shot at him, but missed him▪
at which several issued out to have taken him alive, but the Watchman
seasonably espying an ambush behind the house, gave the signal, where∣by
they were prevented.</P>

the Garison they had surprized, but the Body of them in an adjacent

and barbarous cruelty: for they stript the body of him whom they
had slain in the first onset, and then cutting off his head, fixed it upon a
po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e looking towards his own land. The corpse of the man slain the
week before, they dug up ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his grave, they cut off his head and one

the foresaid premises is easie to conceive; whereupon new Forces with
as much speed as the season would allow were raised and sent up into
those parts, under the command of Major <HI>Savage</HI> in chief: they were
dispatched away in the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> and appointed to meet
with such as should be sent from <HI>Connecticut Colony,</HI> which they did a∣bout
<HI>Quabaog,</HI> and so intended to march directly up to those Indian
Towns about <HI>Watchuset Hill</HI> to the Northwest: but the Indians were
gone, and our Forces in the pursuit of them, taking the wrong path
m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed of them, yet ranging through those woods, they were at one
time sudenly assaulted by a small party of Indians firing upon them,

their Souldiers, after which as they marched along, they accidentally fell
upon another small party of the Enemy, of whom they slew some, and
took others, to the number of sixteen, yet could not meet with the main
Body of the Enemy who it seems had passed over a great River by Rafts,
so our men could follow them no further, wherefore turning down to∣wards

<P><HI>March</HI> 14. The Enemy fell upon <HI>North-Hampton,</HI> and in three places
broke through the Fortification of Palizadoes, set up round about the
Town a little before, for their better security: but the Town being at
that time full of Souldiers, they were quickly repulsed, after they had
killed four men, and two women, and fired four or five dwelling houses,
and as many barns, with the loss of many of their lives as was sup∣posed.</P>
<P>While our Forces under Major <HI>Savage</HI> continued on that side of the
Country, a sad accident fell out at <HI>Springfield,</HI> the certainty of which, it
is judged meet here to relate, to prevent mistakes▪ the matter having
through a great oversight been otherwise represented, then indeed it
was, not only to the prejudice of Truth, but to the disadvantage of some
persons concerned therein. While the Souldiers were quartered a∣mongst

Troopers; but having heard of no Indians thereabouts a good while,
were more secure then they had cause, for riding some of them with
women behind them, and some with their Children in their Arms yet not
so careful as to keep in the middle, but rather in the Rear, and at a pretty
distance stragling from the rest of the Company, a party of Indians ly∣ing
in the Bushes as they rode along, fired upon the hindmost, and killed
two and wounded others: those in the Front having also Women and
Maids behind some of them, were at a stand to know what to do, fearing
they might expose those Women they had in their company, if they
should ride back (in that winding Road made through a woody place
for a mile or two to gether) to look after them that were behind, at the
last one that came riding up, told the foremost company there was no
hurt, and that they were all coming: they that were before rode away
with all speed to the end of the Town, where setting down the Women,
the Troopers returned back, but too late to recover too poor Women &amp;
two children, who upon the first assault were thrown off their horses, and
immediately based into the Bushes, and through a swamp on the other
side of a steep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, so as they could not be heard of all that afternoon,
nor the next day, till toward night, although they were diligently
searched after by all the Troopers in and about the Town;
At last when they were discryed just by a Swamp side, the cruel wretch∣es
endeavoured to have killed them all, but in haste only wounded them
with their hatchets, yet so as one of the poor creatures recovered; the
other with the children dyed of their wounds before they were brought
home, or within a little time after. They did not complain of any inci∣vility
toward them while they were in their power; but by the Farewell
given them, at their parting, they found it true by their own experience,
that <HI>the tender mercyes of the wicked are cruelty</HI></P>
<P>There hapned no other matter of moment worthy the reporting,
while our Forces tarryed in those parts, and the Commanders observ∣ing
that the enemy was turned back again through the Woods, towards
the <HI>Massachusets Bay,</HI> after a months time retired back yet could never
meet with the enemy in their return through the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds, although
while they were at the towns aforesaid, they understood of several at∣tempts
made upon <HI>Sudbury, Marlberough,</HI> the most part of which last
<PB N="79" REF="000231_0091_0FA9AC2E365495A8"/>
they destroyed <HI>March<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 26. which made the Inhabitants forsake their
Dwellings, leaving only a few houses garisoned with Souldiers, the bet∣ter
to secure a passage to the towns westward upon <HI>Connecticut River.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dbury▪</HI> with the souldiers under Leiut▪ <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> of
<HI>Marlberough</HI> sufficiently alarmed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate mischief done about those
Towns, resolved to try what work they could make with the enemy in
the night, whereupon going forth <HI>March</HI> 27. toward morning, they
discerned where the enemy lay by their fires, (near three hundred of,
them) and that within half a mile of a garison house, near the place where
they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one so much mischief the day before. Such was the courage
and resolution of the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glish, though but forty in number, Towns-men
and Souldiers, that they adventured to discharge upon them as they lay
by their fires, when it was so dark that an <HI>Indian</HI> could hardly be dis∣cerned
from a better man, yet God so directing, they discharged several
times upon them, wounded thirty, fourteen of whom either dyed of their
wounds the same day or soon after, which had been chief agents in this
present mischief against the English. Such was the success of this skir∣mish
that the Assailants came off without the loss of one man.</P>
<P>After this time the enemy began to scatter about in small partyes, do∣ing
what mischief they could about the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> killing a man at
<HI>Weymouth,</HI> another at <HI>Hingham,</HI> as they lay skulking up and down in
Swamps and holes, to assault any that occasionally looked never so little
into the woods, sometimes alarming the towns about <HI>Boston</HI> by discharg∣ing
gunns upon particular persons: at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illerica, Braintree,</HI> and at <HI>Ren∣tham,</HI>
near about which place in the Road to <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> they assaulted one
<HI>Woodcocks</HI> house, killed one man, and one of his sons, wounded another,
and burned his sons house.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the little success of former attempts, <HI>Philip</HI> and his
men have one prize more to play in the <HI>Massachusets Colony,</HI> before they
goe off the stage, and then we shall soon see their power visibly decli∣ning
every where, untill their final overthrow come upon them. There
were several small Patryes of them scattered up and down all over the
Country, yet the main Body of them was still lurking up and down in
those woods that lye between <HI>Brookefield, Marlburrough</HI> and <HI>Connecticut
River.</HI> Possibly they had some hope of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iving all the Country before
them to the towns upon the sea-coast; for having burned the deserted
houses at <HI>Marlburrough, April,</HI> 17. the next day they set upon <HI>Sudbury</HI>
with all their might, (hoping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is like) to doe there, as they had done at
the Towns next beyond it. They did at the first prevail so far as to con∣sume
several houses, and barns, and kill several persons, ten or twelve of
<PB N="80" REF="000231_0092_0FA9AC2EF260A6F8"/>
the English, that came from <HI>Concord</HI> to assist their neighbours at <HI>Sudbu∣ry,</HI>
a town distant five miles from them, at the first hearing of the alarm;
who unawares were surprised near a Garison house, in hope of getting
some advantage upon a small Party of the enemy that presented them∣selves
in a Meadow; a great number of <HI>Indians</HI> that lay unseen in the bu∣shes,
suddenly rose up, and intercepting the passage to the Garison
house, killed and took them all.</P>
<P>But our sorrows and losses that day are not yet come to their height;
for in the after part of the same day, that resolute stout-hearted Soul∣dier,
Capt. <HI>Wadsworth</HI> (who had not long before, with not above forty
men, rescued <HI>Lancaster,</HI> when it was in danger to have been all lost at
once) being sent from <HI>Boston</HI> with fifty Souldiers to relieve <HI>Marlbur∣rough,</HI>
having m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rched five and twenty miles, and then understanding
the Enemy was gone through the Woods toward <HI>Sudbury:</HI> this unwea∣ried
Company, before ever they had taken any considerable rest, mar∣ched
immediately back toward <HI>Sudbury</HI> (that lies ten miles nearer <HI>Bo∣ston</HI>)
and being come within a mile of the Town, they espyed a party
of Indians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> far from them, about an hundred, not more, as they con∣ceived,
these they might easily deal with; who retiring back a while,
drew Capt. <HI>Wadsworth</HI> and his Company above a mile into the Woods,
when on the sudden a great body of the Enemy appeared, about five
hundred as was thought, who compassi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g them in round, forced them
to the top of an hill, where they made very stout resistance a considera∣ble
while; but the night drawing on, and some of the Company begin∣ning
to scatter from the rest, their fellows were forced to follow them, so
as the Enemy taking the chase, pursued them on every side, as they made
too hasty a retreat, by which accident, being so much overpow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red by
the Enemies numbers, they were most of them lost: the Captain him∣self,
with one Captain <HI>Brocklebank</HI> (a choice spirited man, much lament∣ed
by the Town of <HI>Rowly</HI> to which he belonged) and some others that
fell into his Company as he marched along, scarce twenty escaping in all;
so as another Captain and his fifty perished at that time, of as brave
Souldiers as any were ever imployed in the present service.</P>
<P>Thus as in former attempts of like nature; too much courage and
e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gerness in pursuit of the Enemy, hath added another fatal blow to this
poor Country.</P>
<P>The same day another party of the <HI>English</HI> coming from <HI>Brookefield,</HI>
whithey they were sent as a Convoy with Provision for the Garison,
were in danger likewise of falling into the hands of the same Indians,
yet riding upon a good speed, and keeping their Guns always ready pre∣sented
<PB N="81" REF="000231_0093_0FA9AC2FB820D9C8"/>
against them they met, they never durst fire at them: only three
or four having unadvisedly first discharged their gunns against the Ene∣my,
and falling too much in the reet of their Company, were cut off and
lost. It is reported by some that afterwards escaped, how they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uelly
tortured five or six of the English that night: yet whatever their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣cess
was this day, it was observed by some (at that time their Prisoners,
and since released) that they seemed very pensive after they came to their
Quarters, shewing no such signs of rejoycing, as they usually were wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
to doe in like case; whither for the loss of some of their own Company
in that dayes enterprise; (said to be an hundred and twenty) or whither
it were the Devil in whom they trusted, and to whom they made their
address the day before, by sundry Conjurations of their <HI>Powawes?</HI> or
whither it were by any dread that the Almighty sent upon their spirits,
upon their execrable Blasphemies, which tis said they used in the tortu∣ring
of some of their poor Captives (bidding Jesus come and deliver
them out of their hands from death if he could) we leave as uncertain,
though some have so reported, yet sure it is that after this day, they ne∣ver
prospered in any attempt they made against the English, but were
continually scattered and broken, till they were in a manner all consu∣med.
After this time, however they had braved it before, they seem∣ed
to apprehend that it was scarce feasible for them to withstand the
power of the English, and therefore seemed more inclinable to a peace,
by several overtures made by them, if they knew how to have brought
it about. For during these encounters they were willing to admit of
some kind of treaty with the English, about the releasing of sun∣dry
of their Captives, which they took at <HI>Lancaster</HI> in <HI>February</HI> last,
and elsewhere: To that end sundry attempts were made by help of seve∣ral
of the <HI>Praying Indians</HI> (as they use to be called) about the redemp∣tion
of some of the women and children, which were at time in their
possession, &amp; by degrees something was effected that way: possibly their
own present sufferings and wants that were upon them, might induce
them thereunto▪ For by this time the Spring of the year came on,
their provision was all spent, and they forced to live wholly upon
ground-nuts, and upon the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh of the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glish creatures, both horse &amp;
neat cattle, which they daily plundered. The Ground-nuts running up
to seed in the summer, began to grow so sticky, as they were scarce eat∣able;
the flesh also of the English cattle proving unwholsome for their
Bodyes, filling them with sundry diseases. One of them having eaten
much horse-flesh, complained that he had before eaten horse, and now
horse began to eat him, meaning some deadly disease growing upon his
<PB N="82" REF="000231_0094_0FA9AC307281D328"/>
eating such ranke flesh, unwholsome for their Bodyes, especially without
salt, as their usual manner is. The fishing season also began now to
come in, wherein they use to take abundance of all sorts, with which
those great Rivers up the Country are abundantly stored: they use to
take thereof, and drying it in the smoak, make provision thereof for the
greatest part of the year; and if the warr continued, they could not but
see they should utterly be cut off therefrom, and that if the planting sea∣son
also were l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, they should be in great want of summer fruits, <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI>
beans and squashes (besides their corn) with which they were wont to
live all the latter part of the summer. Upon all considerations, they
seemed pretty inclinable to hearken to a peace, though some were apt
to think they would never have kept it, further then would stand with
their own advantage, and that their present desire thereof was only to
gain time.</P>
<P>A person formerly acquainted with the <HI>Indians</HI> about <HI>Lancast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> did
adventure upon the forementioned overtures, to goe amongst them to
try if he could not prevail with them for the redemption of the Ministers
wise, taken Captive in <HI>Febraury</HI> last from <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncaster,</HI> and through the fa∣vour
of him who having the hearts of all in his hand, inclines them as he
pleases, obtained the desired end upon an inconsiderable sum, which gave
encouragement to the Councell to send two Messengers on the like er∣rand
the same week, to procure the redemption of others, not without
success: The former, <HI>viz.</HI> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. <HI>Rowlandson</HI> being brought to <HI>Boston</HI>
upon the Election day, <HI>May, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</HI> it was generally looked at as a smile of
providence, and doubtless was a return of prayer, and answer of faith,
with which her husband had been upheld, and supported from the day
of her Captivity; his two children also were returned back not long af∣ter,
more by the over-ruling hand of God (<HI>that turns the Captivity of his
people as the streames of the South;</HI> and sometimes inclining them to pitty
his Servants, that are of themselves more cruell then the Sea-monsters)
then by any other contrivance of mans policy,</P>
<P>And yet no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>withstanding motions of this nature about the redemption
of some of our Prisoners still in their hands, there was no cessation of
armes between us.</P>
<P>About this time Letters were sent down from <HI>Connectiont Colony,</HI> in∣forming
the General Court then assembled at <HI>Boston,</HI> that some of the
<HI>Mohawkes</HI> (a sort of fierce and savage <HI>Indians,</HI> yet mortal enemyes to
these we were at warrs withall) had fallen upon some of <HI>Philips</HI> Party,
and destroyed many of them: likewise that many of them were destroy∣ed
by Feavers and Fluxes, with other distempers falling amongst them,
<PB N="83" REF="000231_0095_0FA9AC31C812C1D8"/>
which was some reviving to our hopes, that the foot of our enemy
should slide in due time, and that destruction was hastning upon them,
though still they were perm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to do mischief in sundry particular pla∣ces
of the Country, which must be minded as we pass along.</P>
<P>Those Indians that were our professed enemies, after they had been
beaten out of the <HI>Narrhaganset Country, Febr.</HI> 1. tarried awhile at <HI>Win∣imazeag,</HI>
a place two days journey north of <HI>Quabaog,</HI> where they divided
themselves into two Companies, one of them tarried on that side the
Country, the other made toward <HI>Plimouth Colony,</HI> taking <HI>Med∣field</HI>
in their way, from whence as they marched along they met
with a notable repulse at <HI>Boggiston,</HI> a small Hamlet, or Company of
Farms not far from the said <HI>Medfield</HI> where they attempted a G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrison,
but meeting with stout resistance, they left the enterprize; and kept on
their way toward <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony, where they scattered themselves up
and down, waiting for opportunityes to spoil and destroy the English
Plantations on that side of the Country.</P>
<P>Besides what is already mentioned, on <HI>May,</HI> 11▪ a party of them
ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the town of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> burnt eleven houses and five barns be∣longing
thereunto: on the other side, a small party of the English scout∣ing
about in pursuit of the Indians, fell upon a Party of them, that lay
waiting in ambush; but being discerned by an Indian in the Company of
our men that gave timely notice, our souldiers had an opportuity there∣by
to make the first shot, and thereby not only prevented a mischief to
themselves, but killed also some of the enemy, (one of whom was ob∣served
to be of more note then his fellows by his attire) the rest f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed a∣way
from them that pursued, though but a small company; so that there
were daily reciprocal acts of hostility in those parts.</P>
<P>Within a few dayes after this, seven houses and two barns more
were burnt by the enemy, in and about <HI>Plimouth:</HI> who did the like mis∣chief
about the same time to the remaining houses of <HI>Namasket</HI> or <HI>Mid∣dleborough.</HI></P>
<P>About this time, another sort of Indians that belonged to <HI>Wamesit</HI> a
place near <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> bordering upon <HI>Merrimack</HI> (who had been pro∣voked
by the rash, unadvised, cruel act of some of the English, about
<HI>Octob.</HI> 27. and <HI>Novemb.</HI> 4. had fired upon them several gunns, both at
<HI>Chelmsford</HI> and <HI>Woburn,</HI> to the killing of some, and wounding of others
upon suspition that the said Indians were guilty of burning a Barn, and
Hay-stack not far off) suddenly turned our enemies, after the winter
was over having first withdrawn themselves from the place assigned
them, and where they had been relieved all the winter (some of them
<PB REF="000231_0096_0FA9AC338B88DD98"/>
after a former revolt) and took their opportunity to fire Mr. <HI>Falconers</HI>
house in <HI>Andover</HI> town early that Spring, and wounded one <HI>Roger Marks,</HI>
and killed his horse. Two more houses about <HI>Shawshin</HI> beyond the said
<HI>Andover,</HI> were burned about <HI>Mar.</HI> 10. Also they killed a young man
of the said town, <HI>Apr.</HI> 8. theson of <HI>George Abbot;</HI> And another son of
his also was carried away the same day, who yet was returned
some few moneths after, almost pined to death with hunger.</P>
<P>At the same time they killed some of their Cattle, cutting out only
the tongues of some of them for haste; being shot at by several of the
Inhabitants from their Garrisons.</P>
<P><HI>Mar.</HI> 10. A. <HI>Concord</HI> two men going for Hay one of them was killed.</P>

with <HI>Samuel Varnham</HI> his neighbour, being pursued, as they passed o∣ver
the River to look after their Cattle on that side of the river; and
making several shots against them, who returned the like again upon
the said Indians, (judged to be about forty) what success they had
upon the en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>my, was best known to themselves; but two of <HI>Varnhams</HI>

taken from <HI>Lancaster</HI> a little before. In the like strange manner did one
of <HI>Eames</HI> his children escape away about <HI>May</HI> 3. last; travelling thirty
miles alone in the woods, without any relief till he came to an English
town. <HI>Eames</HI> his house was assaulted when himself was from home, by
an <HI>Indian</HI> called <HI>Netus</HI> (not long after slain at <HI>Malborough</HI>) which had
been very familiar with the <HI>English,</HI> with nine or ten more of his com∣pany,
as perfidious and barbarous as himself: They burned all the
dwellings that belonged to the Farm, Corn, Hay and Cattle, besides
the dwelling house with what was therein; it is probable those at <HI>Con∣cord</HI>
were killed by the same hands about a fortnight after.</P>
<P>Many such like remarkable instances of special providences might
<PB N="84" REF="000231_0097_0FA9AC3433165A98"/>
be mentioned▪ if it were convenient to insert such particular passages
into the general Narrative of the late troubles from our barbarous
enemies.</P>
<P>On <HI>May</HI> 3. a party of them killed a man at <HI>Haverhill,</HI> upon the edge
of <HI>Merrimack River;</HI> and passing over the said River to <HI>Bradford,</HI>
spoiled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other Family; killing one <HI>Thomas Kemball,</HI> and carrying
his wife and five Children captive, forty miles up into the woods; al∣though
it was questioned whether this last mischief were done by a∣ny
of <HI>Philips</HI> party, but rather by some that belong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the Eastward
<HI>Indians,</HI> of which there may be occasion (God willing) to speak more
afterward.</P>
<P>For the suppressing of these insolencies, several Companies of fresh
souldiers, both horse and Foot were raised in the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> by the
Governour and Council of that Colony, and sent out to suppress the
common enemy; the Foot under the command of Capt. <HI>Sill,</HI> Capt. <HI>Cut∣ler,</HI>
Capt. <HI>Holbrook,</HI> the Horse under the Command of Capt. <HI>Brattle,</HI>
Capt. <HI>Prentice,</HI> Capt. <HI>Henchman,</HI> Commander in chief: these several
Companies modelled as aforesaid, were sent out <HI>Apr.</HI> 27. 1676. to
range the woods towards <HI>Hassanamesit.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 6. of <HI>May,</HI> they met with a considerable. party of the enemy:
they were first discovered by the <HI>Natick</HI> scouts pursuing a Bear &amp; at the
first not discerning that the <HI>Natick</HI> Indian scouts belonged to our men,
it gave some advantage to our forces; our Horsemen falling upon them
before they were well aware, killed and took of the Enemy about six∣teen,
which they took notice of at the present, although it was confessed
by the enemy, that they lost twenty that encounter. It was report∣ed
that the sounding of a trumpet without order, did much hurt, but
the Commander in chief affirmeth, that it was no disadvantage to the
service in hand, it neither being heard by our own Foot, not yet by the
enemy. If any error was committed by the English Companies, it was
in that the Horse did not timely enough draw down from the top of the
hill, whereby they came to be discovered by the enemy; who there∣upon
made the more haste to escape: However it was no small loss
to the enemy, some of the slain being known to be considerable per∣sons;
and it struck such a terror into them, that they never durst
face our men afterwards; for although after our men returned to
their Quarters at <HI>Medfield,</HI> they saw two hundred fires in the night,
yet they could never come near them again to fight any company of
them: but the season proving rainy, hindred any further pursuit
of them at that time. And soon after this the souldiers being
<PB REF="000231_0098_0FA9AC37AF8F8D68"/>
visited with sickly distempers by reason of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pidemical Cold at that
time prevailing through the Country, they were for the present
released for the recovery of their health, with intent to be cal∣led
together again at a more convenient time; this was done <HI>May</HI>
the tenth.</P>
<P>During this interval of time, upon a report that a party of the Ene∣my
that were discovered about <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> busie in fishing in a River
thereabouts, Capt <HI>Brattle</HI> was sent up about the 23d. of <HI>May,</HI> who
with the help of so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Inhabi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ants, killed eleven or twelve of them
without the loss but of one of our men: Had they not discovered some
of ours on the opposite shoar, it was conceived a greater spoile might
have been made amongst them.</P>
<P>But in the next place we must take notice of the proceedings of the
enemy about <HI>Connecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt:</HI> The greatest Body of them made towards
<HI>Plimouth Colony</HI> early in the Spring as was said before, where we shall
leave them for the present, and observe what the remainiug part of
them did westward.</P>
<P>Some sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttering partyes were sku<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king about <HI>Springfield,</HI> and those
lower towns, upon a small number of whom Capt. <HI>Holioke</HI> (newly cho∣sen
Captain of <HI>Springfield</HI> in the room of his father lately deceased) hand∣se
led his office, early in the Spring: for having notice of some of them
in those woods, he marched after them with ten or twelve resolute young
men, and waiting his opportunity, surprized them near the great Ri∣ver,
so as two or three of them were left dead upon the place, another
mortally wounded, got on to an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the river, where it was con¦cluded
he took his last nights lodgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g The other being sorely wound∣ed,
was taken alive, and brought home to <HI>Spring field,</HI> where he con∣fessed
many things to one of the Inhabitants that understood their lan∣guage,
owning the truth in many things against his own company, and
soon after dyed of his wounds.</P>
<P>This was bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Preparative to an higher piece of service, which Capt.
<HI>Holioke</HI> was soon after engaged in▪ and wherein be acquitted himself
beyond expectation; and taking more pains then ordinary, in making
his retreat, he gat a Surfet, that ended his dayes in <HI>September</HI> follow∣ing
about <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>April</HI> likewise some of the Inhabitants a∣bout
<HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly,</HI> attending their tillage at <HI>Hockanum,</HI> within three miles
of the town, and having a guard of souldiers with them, yet three of
the compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y were casually slain by a party of the enemy, that lay in
wait for such an opportunity. One of them was Mr. <HI>Goodman,</HI> a dea∣con
<PB N="85" REF="000231_0099_0FA9AC3905472688"/>
of the <HI>Church,</HI> that went a little beyond the Command of the
Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iers that came to guard them, to view the fence of his own land:
and two others that contrary to express order, would venture upon
the top of an high hill, neer by, to take a needless and unseasonable view
of the Country, were shot down by the enemy before they could re∣cover
their <HI>Corps du gard.</HI></P>
<P>But the great Company of the enemy, that stayed on that side of the
Country, and about <HI>Watchuset Hills,</HI> when the rest went towards <HI>Pli∣mouth,</HI>
though they had been disappointed in their planting, by the death
of <HI>Canonchet,</HI> were loth to loose the advantage of the fishing season
then coming in; wherefore having seated themselves near the upper
Falls of <HI>Cunnecticut River,</HI> not far from <HI>Dee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>field,</HI> and perceiving that
the English Forces were now drawn off from the lower towns of <HI>Had∣ly</HI>
and <HI>Northampton,</HI> now and then took advantag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to plunder them
of their Cattle, and not fearing any assault from our Souldiers, grew a
little secure, while they were upon their Fishing design, insomuch that a
couple of English-lads lately taken captive by the enemy, and making
their escape, acquainted their friends at home how secure they lay in
those places, which so animated the Inhabitants of <HI>Hadly, Hatfield</HI> and
<HI>Northampton,</HI> that they being willing to be revenged for the loss of
their cattle, besides other preceding mischiefs, took up a resolution with
what strength they could raise among themselves (partly out of gari∣son
souldiers, and partly of the Inhabitants) to make an assault upon
them, which if it had been done with a little more deliberation, waiting
for the coming of supplyes expected from <HI>Hartford,</HI> might have proved
a fatal business to all the said Indians: yet was the victory obtained more
considerable then a first was apprehended; For not having much above
an hundred and fifty fighting men in their Company, they marched si∣lently
in the dead of the night, <HI>May</HI> 18. and came upon the said Indi∣ans
a little before break of day, whom they found almost in a dead
sleep, without any Scouts abroad, or watching about their wigwams
at home; for in the evening they had made themselves merry with new
milk and rost beef, having lately driven away many of their milch cows,
as an English woman confessed, that was made to milk them.</P>
<P>When they came near the Indians rendezvouze, they allighted off
their horses, and tyed them to some young trees at a quarter of a
miles distance, so marching up, they fired amain into their very wigwams,
killing many upon the place, and frighting others with the sudden a∣larm
of their Gunns, made them run into the River; where the swiftness
of the stream carrying them down a steep Fall, they perished in the wa∣ters,
<PB REF="000231_0100_0FA9AC39839B2820"/>
some getting into Canooes, (small boats made of the barks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir∣chen
trees) which proved to them a <HI>Charons</HI> boat, being sunk, or over∣fet,
by te shooting of our men, delivered them into the like danger of
the waters, giving them thereby a pasport into the other world: others
of them creeping for shelter under the banks of the great river, were
espyed by our men and killed with their swords; Capt. <HI>Holioke</HI> killing
five, young and old, with his own hands from under a bank. When the
Indians were first awakened with the thunder of their gunns, they cried
out <HI>Mohawks, Mohawks,</HI> as if their own native enemies had been upon
them: but the dawning of the light, soon notified their error, though it
could not prevent the danger.</P>
<P>Such as came back spake sparingly of the number of the slain▪ some
say there could not in reason be less then two or three hundred of them
that must necessarily perish in the midst of so many instruments of de∣struction
managed against them with such disadvantages to themselves.
Some of their prisoners afterwards owned that they lost above three
hundred in that Gamizado, some whereof were principal men Sachems,
and some of their best fighting men that were left, which made the vi∣ctory
more considerable then else it would have been; nor did they seem
ever to have recovered themselves after this defeat, but their ru∣ine
immediately followed upon it. Yet such was the awfull hand of
Providence, in the chose of this victory, mixing much bitter with the
sweet, that it might well be called a costly victory to the Conquerors,
that so no flesh should glory in it self.</P>
<P>The Indians that lay scattering on both sides of the river, after they
recovered themselves, and discovered the small number of them that
assailed them, turned head upon the English, who in their ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat
were a little disordered, for want of the help of the eldest Captain, that
was so enfeebled by sickness before he set out, that he was no way able
for want of bodily strength (not any way defective for want of skill or
courage) to assist or direct in making the retreat: For some of the e∣nemy
fell upon the Guards that kept the horses, others pursued them
in the reer, so as our men sustained pretty much damage as they
retired, missing after their return thirty eight of their men: And if
Capt. <HI>Holioke</HI> had not played the man at a more then ordinary rate,
sometimes in the Front, sometimes in the flank and reer, at all times en∣couraging
the souldiers, it might have proved a fatal business to the as∣sailants.
The said Capt. <HI>Holiokes</HI> horse was shot down under him, and
himself ready to be assaulted by many of the Indians, just coming upon
him, but discharging his pistolls upon one or two of them, whom he
<PB N="86" REF="000231_0101_0FA9AC3A3097E160"/>
presently dispatched, and another friend coming up to his rescue, he was
saved, and so carried off the souldiers without any further loss.</P>
<P>It is confidently reported by some that were there present at this en∣gagement,
that one told above an hundred Indians left dead upon the
place; and another affirmed that he told near an hundred and forty
swimming down the Falls, none of which were observed to get alive to
shore, save one.</P>
<P>The loss that befell our men in the retreat, was occasioned principal∣ly
by the bodily weakness of Capt. <HI>Turner,</HI> unable to manage his charge
any longer, yet some say they wanted powder, which forced them to
retire as fast as they could by Capt. <HI>Turners</HI> order.</P>
<P>It is said also by one present at the fight, that seven or eight in the
reer of the English, through haste missed their way, and were never
heard of again; and without doubt fell into the Indians hands, and it is
feared some of them were tortured.</P>
<P>About sev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n dayes after this, they were minded to try the chance of
Warr again, and see if they could not recover their loss, by returning
the like upon the English: For,</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 30. A great number of them appeared before <HI>Hatfield,</HI> fired a∣bout
twelve houses and barns without the Fortification of the town,
driving away multitudes of their Cattle, and their Sheep, spreading
themselves in the meadow near the town: which bravado so raised the
courage of their neighbours at <HI>Hadly,</HI> that twenty five resolute young
men ventured over the river, to relieve <HI>Hatfield</HI> in this distress, who
charged the enemy with such undaunted courage and resolution (<HI>Auda∣ces
fortuna juvat</HI>) that they beat down five or six at the first shot they
made, so making way through the thickest of their enemies, that lay
ready to take aim at them behind every tree, as they passed by; yet they
escaped all their shot till they came within a little of the town they came
to relieve, where they lost five of their twenty five.</P>
<P>The enemy being amazed at the resolution of our men, being but so
small an handfull, that they fled immediately from the town; having lost
twenty five of their men in the enterprize.</P>
<P>The Council of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> gathering by these proceedings of the
Indians, that their desire of peace was only to gain time, Ordered that
the forces raised before <HI>Apr.</HI> 27. and for a time released should be
hastned out again to range the woods towards <HI>Hadly,</HI> and those parts;
made an agreement with <HI>Hartford Colony</HI> to send forces from thence to
meet them about <HI>Brookfield,</HI> &amp; so to scoure along on both sides <HI>Connect∣icut

in those waters, their hope of planting being now almost over.</P>
<P><PB REF="000231_0102_0FA9AC3C18D423E0"/>
To this end about <HI>May</HI> 30. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>96. the Forces under Capt. <HI>Henchman</HI> were
called together again, and sent to <HI>Brookfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld</HI> to meet with those expected

<HI>Brookfield;</HI> but followed them the week after; having first returned from
<HI>Weshacom</HI> to <HI>Malborough</HI> to supply themselves with ammunition; and so
marched directly towards <HI>Hadly,</HI> where they met with <HI>Connecticut For∣ces;</HI>
and from thence according to mutual agreement, ours marched on
the east side of the river, and <HI>Connecticut Forces</HI> on the West, up toward
<HI>Squakheag;</HI> coming to <HI>Deerfield,</HI> &amp; the great Falls thereabouts, they sent
up their Scouts, but not hearing of the enemy, they marched up no high∣er,
being in no good capacity to have gone further if there had been oc∣casion,
by reason of a tedious Storm of rain, which occasioned much
damage in their Amunition and Provision. While our Forces lay about

<P>It appears plainly by the contents of the said Letter, as well as by ma∣ny
other testimonyes, that about this time the Indians our Enemyes,
who hitherto had been linked together as Brethren in iniquity, and
cruelty, were now strangly divided and seperated the one from the o∣ther:
some impute it to an assault made upon them by the <HI>Mohawkes,</HI>
who falling upon <HI>Philip</HI> with the Inland Indians, slew about fifty of
them, whereupon they of <HI>Philips</HI> Company resolved to return to their
own Country, and doe what mischief they could to the English there∣abouts:
This was roported by an Indian brought to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne,</HI> 29.

upon some quarrel amongst themselves, occasioned by an evill spirit sent
from God upon them, that thereby they might, being soattered, the
more easily be taken and ruined by the English; now that the time of
vengeance was com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when they shall be called to an account for all
their former outrages and crueltyes; for now is the snare hastning up∣on
them, wherein they shall be hampered in their own devices, so to be∣taken
and destroyed: it cannot but be acknowledged as a very remark∣able
Providence, that Capt. <HI>Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hman</HI> in his late expedition to <HI>Hadly,</HI>
killed and took about eighty four of the Enemy, without the loss of

<P>But by that time our Forces were returned home as far as <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bury;</HI>
they were ordered upon the sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>citation of the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI>

of <HI>Philip,</HI> who was it seems with many hundreds of his Barbarous
Followers fallen upon the English Plantations thereabouts, and whither
also a little before, Capt. <HI>Brattle</HI> with a Troop of Horse, and Captain
<HI>Mosely</HI> with a Foot Company were sent up from <HI>Boston</HI> to pursue
after them, now flocking in great numbers into those Woods; there
was at this time no small hope of surprizing <HI>Philip:</HI> several reports be∣ing
brought that he was seen in this and that place, not with above twen∣ty
or thirty men attending on him: but his time was not yet fully
come, nor had he as yet fully accomplished all that mischief, he was
like to be suffered to do: For upon <HI>Iuly 1st.</HI> 1676. a party of his In∣dians
committed an horrid and barbarous Murder upon Mr. <HI>Hezekiah
Willet</HI> in <HI>Swanzy,</HI> an hopeful young Gentleman, as any in those parts;
they used frequently to keep a Sentinel on the top of their House, from
a Watch-house built thereon, whence they could discover any Indians be∣fore
they came near the house, but not hearing of the Enemy in those
parts for a considerable time, that necessary piece of circumspection was
omitted that day, whereby that deserving person was betrayed into their
cruel hands, for within a quarter of an hour after he went out of his
own doors, within sight of his House, he was shot at by three of them
at once, from every one of whom he received a mortal wound; they
after their barbarous manner took off his head: and carried it away with
them (which yet was soon after recovered) leaving the Trunk of his
body behind, as a sad monument of their inhumane cruelty: the same
Indians, not being above thirty in number, took away a <HI>Negro</HI> belong∣ing
to the same Family, who being faithful to his Masters, and the Coun∣tries
interest, ventured his life to make his escape, which was the pre∣servation
of many others: for the said <HI>Negro</HI> being a little acquainted
with their Language, discovered to the English after his escape, <HI>Philips</HI>

Next day at <HI>eight of the Clock</HI> in the morning: by this <HI>special Provi∣dence</HI>
the Enemy was defeated of <HI>their purpose,</HI> and never after had any
opportunity of doing any <HI>considerable damage</HI> to the English in that
part of the Country. So as after this day we may truly date the time
of <HI>our Deliverance,</HI> and beginning of <HI>Revenges</HI> upon the Enemy: Now
is their own <HI>turne come,</HI> when it shall be <HI>done unto them,</HI> as they have
<HI>served us:</HI> They that before <HI>led otherr into Captivity,</HI> must themselves
hence forth <HI>goe into Captivity:</HI> And they that <HI>killed with the Sword,</HI> must
themselves be <HI>killed with the Sword,</HI> as in <HI>the Sequel</HI> of this <HI>Narrative</HI>
will abundantly be manifest; The History of which before we shall any

of their coming, and the Success that did attend them in their march
thither.</P>
<P>Our Friends and Brethren of that Colony, although they had never
actually felt <HI>half of those miseries,</HI> that befell the people of the other

Enemy,</HI> yea, sometimes they did afford it, before it was expresly <HI>de∣sired;</HI>
according to <HI>the Tenor</HI> of the <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Confederation,</HI> and
Rules of common prudence; considering that if the <HI>fire of this War</HI> were
not timely <HI>extinguished,</HI> it would end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger their own <HI>Fabrick:</HI> There∣fore
according to Agreement, the Councel of that Colony ordered their

so far smiled upon the Enterprize, as to give them an opportu∣nity
to surprize <HI>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty one of the Enemy,</HI> of whom <HI>nineteen were slain,</HI>

near three hundred; wherefore the Commanders ordered the Indians
to be ready at the top of the hill upon a signal given to run down amain
upon the enemy securely lodged in the hollow of the Swampe just oppo∣site
against them, while their Horsemen being divided into two squa∣drons
to ride round the hill, so that at the same instant, both the Horse∣men
upon the two wings, and the Indians a foot rushing down suddenly
upon the enemy put them into an horrible fright, making a lamentable
outcry; some getting into the Swampe, the rest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat were prevented by
the Horsemen, and the friendly Indians coming so suddenly upon them
were all taken prisoners; Capt. <HI>Newbery</HI> with his troop alligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing from
their horses ran into the Swampe after them, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e they killed at least
an hundred, as was judged by some then present; taking also many pri∣soners
out of those habitations of darkness; the enemy scarce daring to
make any resistanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for none of the English, and but one or two of the
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins &amp; Pequods</HI> were hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that assault: Yet it was affirmed by

<PB N="98" REF="000231_0110_0FA9AC42E99E4818"/>
that they killed and took of the enemy at that time above three hundred
young and old. At the same time was taken the old Squaw of <HI>Narrha∣ganset,</HI>
commonly called the old Queen.</P>
<P>They were necessitated with this booty to return homewards to gra∣tifie
the <HI>Mohegin &amp; Pequod</HI> Indians that accompanied them, who had
done them very good service in the pursuit, having lost one or two of
their men in the chase: But their return hom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, was, as it proved in the
issue, more beneficial, then their longer stay might have been, to have
made a fruitless pursuit after <HI>Philip</HI> (whose time was not yet come al∣though
hastning apace) for in their return they met sixty of the enemy,
all of whom they slew and took, so as their Sword returned not empty.</P>
<P>Within a few dayes after, two hundred of the enemy within <HI>Plimouth</HI>
Jorisdiction being distressed with Famine, and fear of danger, came and
submitted themselves to the Goverment there: But three of the compa∣ny
were presently derected of a cruel murther, and villanous ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ult upon
one Mr. <HI>Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes</HI> house of <HI>Plimouth;</HI> by a well minded Squaw that was a∣mong
them (hoping that possibly such a discovery would be pleasing to
the English) and accordingly adjudged forthwith to undergoe condign
punishment, which the rest that surrendred themselves were no whit
troubled at, such kind of Villains, being alwayes exempted from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acts
of favour and mercy. Those two hundred that had newly surrendred
themselves, that they might give ful proof of their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>delity, offered to lead
a Party of the English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a place not far off, where twenty more of the
enemy might be surprized amongst whom also was one, known to be
a bloudy murtherer of an English man that year before; accordingly
eight English men took fourteen of the said <HI>Indians,</HI> and the next day
brought in all the aforesaid twenty of the enemy, with the said murderer;
who was presently executed, the rest being accepted into favour.</P>
<P>It is affirmed likewise that five or six Sachems of <HI>Cape God,</HI> towards
the eastern part of it, came with three hundred <HI>Indians</HI> to make peace
with the English, on the <HI>6th.</HI> of <HI>Iuly;</HI> one of the said S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chems earnestly
desiring the English that none of them might be suffered to sell any
strong Liquors to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the trading of which, possibly hath had
no small influence into the present mischiefs.</P>
<P>The next day, <HI>Iuly</HI> the <HI>7th.</HI> a small party of ours, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> friendly
or Christian <HI>Indians</HI> with them killed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook seven of the enemy in the
woods not far from <HI>Dedham,</HI> one of which was a <HI>Narrhaganset Sachem;</HI>
who either himself, informed, or by some other at that time, certain
intelligence was brought to <HI>Boston,</HI> that some of our enemy <HI>Indians</HI> were
gotten to <HI>Albany,</HI> informing people there, that they might the more

easily get powder and amunition, that the English and they were now at
peace▪ One of the said Indians was the Sachem of <HI>Spring field,</HI> a bloudy
and deceitfull villain; It is hoped that he is now taken in the snare from
whence he shall never be suffered to escape.</P>
<P><HI>Philip</HI> by this time could not but think his ruine hastned apace▪ yet
that he might, in imitation of him that stirred up all this mischief, express
the more wrath, because he knew his time was but short, intended if
possible, to destroy one town more of the English before his turn came;
wherefore <HI>Iuly,</HI> 11. with all the Force he could get, or that he had left
he intended to set upon <HI>Taunton,</HI> having as was conceived, many hun∣dreds
in his company: but his design being strangly discovered by a
Negroe, whom they had taken captive a little before, that having lived
near the <HI>Indians</HI> before, understood much of their Language, who ma∣king
his escape from them, acquainted the Inhabitants with the plot; who
having timely notice, furnished themselves with Souldiers, whereby
they were able to repulse the enemy upon his first approach: so as he
only fired two houses, and then fled away: <HI>Except the Lord keepeth the
City the Watehman watcheth but in vain.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>22d.</HI> of this moneth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> as is hinted before, the Companyes
sent from <HI>Concord, May,</HI> 30. up towards <HI>Hadly,</HI> having spent much
time and paines in pursuit of <HI>Philip</HI> all the Country over (whom they
could not yet overtake) having tired themselves with many long and te∣dious
Marches through the desert woods, before they returned home
some of them were sent toward <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> yet was their labour well
improved, and followed with good success at the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t: for in ranging
those woods in <HI>Plimouth Colony,</HI> they killed and took, by the help of
Capt. <HI>Mosely</HI>'s Company and Capt. <HI>Brattles</HI> Troop joyning with Major
<HI>Bradfords</HI> Company of <HI>Plimouth Colony,</HI> an hundred and fifty Indians,
with the loss of never an English man.</P>
<P>It was feared that <HI>Philip</HI> and his Company would have returned into
the <HI>Nipnet Country,</HI> to prevent which, several Horsemen were sent to
guard the pasage; but he lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked about his own Country in swamps and
other secret places, where he was as yet hid from the sight of the En∣glish,
although many times they hapned to lodge very near him, inso∣much
as an Indian Captive promised in two hours time to bring our
Souldiers to the very place where he was; but they not being able to
pass the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est way, came a little too late; for they being so hotly pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sued,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed away, leaving much of their treasure behind them; then
Kettles boiling over the fire, their dead unburyed, and twenty of their
party were overtaken, that fell into the English hands: <HI>Philip</HI> himself,
<PB N="100" REF="000231_0112_0FA9AC45E909B108"/>
and some few of his stragling followers, making their escape by a Raft
over an arm of the Sea into another neck of land on <HI>Pocasset</HI> side, not da∣ring
to trus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself any longer in <HI>Metapoyset</HI> woods, so full of our En∣glish
Souldiers, as well those of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> as of the <HI>Massachusets Colony,</HI>

number. Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> that active and unwearied Commander of <HI>Pli∣mouth
Colony,</HI> was at this time as well as long before, out upon the chase
with but e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghteen English, and twenty two Indians that were friends,
had four several ingagements with <HI>Philips</HI> party, wherein he spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led se∣venty
six of the enemy, without the loss of one of his own men. In se∣veral
of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se skirmishes, thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Indians that upon submission had their
lives given them, have done notable service in hunting out the enemy
in all the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r lurking places.</P>
<P>At another time they took <HI>Philips Squaw,</HI> and one of his chief Coun∣cellors;
and about that same time, another Sachem about <HI>Pocasset,</HI> with
forty <HI>Indians</HI> submitted himself to the Government of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> on pro∣mise
of life and liberty.</P>
<P>It seemed that now the time of our deliverance was come, and the time
also for the dest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uction of our enemyes: for the last week in <HI>Iuly,</HI> the
<HI>Massachusets</HI> understanding that some <HI>Indians</HI> were seen roving up and
down the woods about <HI>Dedham,</HI> almost starved for want of victu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls,
sent a small Company of twenty six Souldiers, with about nine or ten
Christian Indians, who pursued and took fifty of the enemy, without a∣ny
loss to the English, at which time also, a good quantity of <HI>Wam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag</HI>
and powder was taken from the enemy. That which increased this
victory was the slaughter of <HI>Pomham,</HI> who was one of the stoutest
and most valiant Sachems that belonged to the <HI>Narhagansets;</HI>
whose courage and strength was so great, that after he had been mor∣tally
wounded in the fight, so as himself could not stand; yet catching
hold of an English-man that by accident came near him, had done him
a mischief, if he had not been presently rescued by one of his Fellowes.
Amongst the rest of the Captives at that time, was one of the said <HI>Pom∣hams</HI>
sons, a very likely you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, and one wholse cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance would have

<PB N="101" REF="000231_0113_0FA9AC4677733890"/>
<HI>Nipnet Sachems,</HI> called Sagamore <HI>Iohn,</HI> who <HI>Iuly</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. came to surrender
himself to the Governour and Council of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> at <HI>Boston,</HI>
bringing along with him one hundred and eighty of the Enemy Indians.
This <HI>Iohn</HI> that he might the more ingratiate himself with the English,
who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e friendship he was now willing to seek after, did by a wile get into
his hands, one <HI>Matoonas,</HI> an old malicious Villain, who was the first that
did any mischief within the <HI>Massachusets Colony</HI> July. 14. 1675. baring
an old grudge against them as is thought, for justice that was done upon
one of his Sons, 1671. whose Head ever since stands upon a Pole near
the Gibbet where he was hanged up: the bringing in of this malicious
Caiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, was an hopeful presage, that it would not be long before <HI>Philip</HI>
himself, the grand Villain, would in like manner receive a just reward of
his Wickedness and Murders.</P>
<P>Sagamore <HI>Iohn,</HI> that came in <HI>Iuly</HI> 27. affirmed, that he had never in∣tended
any mischief to the English at <HI>Brookefield</HI> the last year (near
which Village it seems his place was) but that <HI>Philip</HI> coming over-night
amongst them, he was forced, for fear of his own life, to joyn with them
against the English. <HI>Matoonas</HI> also when he was brought before the
Council, and asked what he had to say for himself, confessed that he had
rightly deserved Death, and could expect no other, adding withal, that
if he had followed their Counsel, he had not come to this; for he had
often seemed to favour the Praying Indians, and the Christian Religion,
but like <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> by his after practise, discovered quickly, that he
had no part nor portion in that matter.</P>
<P>About this time several parties of English, within <HI>Plimouth</HI> Jurisdi∣ction,
were willing to have a hand in so good a matter, as catching of
<HI>Philip</HI> would be, who perceiving that he was now going down the wind,
were willing to hasten his fall. Amongst others a small party, <HI>Iuly</HI> 31.
went out of <HI>Bridge-water</HI> upon discovery, and by providence were di∣rected
to fall upon a Company of Indians where <HI>Philip was,</HI> they came
up with them, and killed some of his special Friends, <HI>Philip</HI> himself was
next to his Uncle, that was shot down, and had the Souldier that had his
choice which to shoot at, known which had been the right Bird, he
might as well have taken him as his Uncle; but tis said that he had new∣ly
cut off his Hair, that he might not be known: the party that did this
exploit were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew in number, and therefore not being able to keep alto∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her
close in the reer, that cunning Fox escaped away through the
Bushes und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>erned in the reer of the English: that which was most
remarkable in this design, was that trembling fear discerned to be upon
the Indians at this time, insomuch that one of them having a Gun in his
<PB N="102" REF="000231_0114_0FA9AC4A1480DEF0"/>
hand well laden, yet was not able to shoot it off, but suffered an English
Souldier to come close up to his breast, and so shot him down, the other
not being able to make any resistance: nor was any of the English hurt
at this time.</P>
<P>The like terror was seen in others at that time, for within two days
after, Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> the terror of the Indians in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony, mar∣ching
in pursuit of <HI>Philip,</HI> with but thirty English men, and twenty re∣conciled
Indians, took twenty three of the Enemy, and the next day fol∣lowing
them by their Tracks, fell upon their Head quarters, and killed
and took about an hundred and thirty of them, but with the loss of one
English man: in this engagement God did appear in a more then ordi∣nary
manner to fight for the English, for the Indians by their number,
and other advantages of the place, were so conveniently provided, that
they might have made the first shot at the English, and done them much
damage; but one of their own Country-men in Capt. <HI>Churches Com∣pany,</HI>
e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pying them, called aloud unto them in their own Language, telling
them, <HI>that if they shot a Gun, they were all dead men;</HI> with which they
were so amazed, that they durst not once offer to fire at the English,
which made the victory the more remarkable: <HI>Philip</HI> made a very nar∣row
escape at that time, being forced to leave his Treasures, his beloved
Wife and only Son, to the mercy of the English, <HI>Skin for Skin▪ all that a

<P>This bloody wretch hath one week or two more to live, an object of
pitty, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a spectacle of divine vengeance, his own Followers beginning
now to plot against his life, to make the better tearms for their own; as
they did also seek to betray <HI>Squaw Sachem</HI> of <HI>Pocasset, Philips</HI> near

<P><HI>August</HI> 6. An Indian willing to shift for himself fled to <HI>Taunton,</HI> of∣fering
to lead any of the English that would follow him, to a party of
Indians, which they might easily apprehend, which twenty attempted,
and accordingly seized the whole Company, to the number of twenty six
all but that Squaw Sachem her self, who intending to make an escape
from the danger, attempted to get over a River, or arm of the Sea near
<PB N="103" REF="000231_0115_0FA9AC4C0366C9E0"/>
by, upon a Raft or some pieces of broken wood; but whether tired and
spent with swimming, or starved with cold and hunger, she was found
stark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aked in <HI>Metapoiset,</HI> not far from the water-side, which made
some think, that she was first half drowned, and so ended her wretched
life, just in that place where the year before she had helped <HI>Philip</HI> to
make his escape: her head being cut off and set upon a Pole in <HI>Taunton,</HI>
was known by som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Indians then Prisoners, which set them into an hor∣rid
Lamentation; but such was the righteous hand of God, in bringing
at the last that mischief upon themselves, which they had without cause
thus long acted against others.</P>
<P><HI>Philip,</HI> like a Salvage and wild Beast, having been hunted by the En∣glish
Forces through the Woods, above an hundred miles backward and
forward, at last was driven to his own Den, upon <HI>Mount-hope,</HI> where re∣tiring
himself, with a few of his best Friends into a Swamp, which pro∣ved
but a Prison to keep him fast, till the Messengers of death, came by
Divine permission to execute vengeance upon him, which was thus ac∣complished.</P>
<P>Such had been his inveterate malice and wickedness against the english
that despairing of mercy from them, he could not bear that any thing
should be suggested to him about a Peace, insomuch as he caused one of
his Confederates to be killed, for propounding an expedient of peace;
which so provoked some of his Company, not altogether so desperate as
himself, that one of them (being near of kin to him that was killed)
fled to Road-I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land, whither, that active Champion Capt. <HI>Church</HI> was
newly retired, to recruit his men for a little time, being much tired with
hard marches all that week) informing them that <HI>Philip</HI> was fled to a
Swamp in <HI>Mount-hope,</HI> whether he would undertake to lead them tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would pursue him. This was welcome news, and the best Cordial, for
such Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial Spirits: whereupon he immediately, with a small Company
of men, part English and part Indians, began another March, which
shall prove fatal to <HI>Philip,</HI> and end that controversie betwixt the english
and him: for coming very early to the side of the Swamp, his Souldiers
began presently to surround it, and whether the Devil appeared to him
in a Dream that night, as he did unot <HI>Saul,</HI> for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> boding his Tragical end
(it matters not) as he intended to make his escape out of the Swamp,
he was shot through the Heart by an Indian of his own Nation as is
said, that had all this while kept himself in a neutrality until this time,
but now had the ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing vote in his power, by which he determined the
quarrel that had held so long in suspence; in him is fulfilled what was said
in the Prophet, <HI>Wo to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled, and deal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st

they shall deal treacherously with thee,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 33: 1.</P>
<P>With <HI>Philip</HI> at this time fell five of his trustiest Followers, of whom
one was said to be the Son of his chief Captain, that had shot the first
Gun at the English the year before. This was done <HI>August</HI> 12. 1676.
a remarkable testimony of divine favour to the Colony of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> who
had for their former successes, appointed the 17th day of <HI>August</HI> fol∣lowing,
to be kept as a day of solemn Thanksgiving to Almighty God.
There having been so strange a turn of providence observed in the late
successes obtained in and about <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony, it may not be amiss
here to enquire into the occasions that did lead thereunto, and also into
the progress and continuance thereof, after the slaughter of <HI>Philip</HI> that
grand Rebel.</P>
<P>In the precedent Narration frequent mention hath been made of one
Capt. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurch,</HI> whom God hath made an instrument of signal Victories
over the Indians in that Colony, and of great advantage in that respect
to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole Jurisdiction. It hapened that the said Capt. <HI>Church</HI> some
time in <HI>Iune</HI> last, <HI>viz.</HI> of this present year, 1676. passing over in a Canoo
from <HI>Pocasset</HI> to <HI>Road-Island,</HI> as he used frequently to do (having had
much imployment upon the said Neck of Land, so called) several Indians
whom he had known before at <HI>Lakenham</HI> (a Village on <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>) b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck∣ned
to him, as if they had a mind to speak with him; he having had so
much exper ence as well as others of their Treachery, was not willing
to adventure presently to come near them; but when they seemed to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rge very much, and made many signs to him, and at last laid down their
Guns in his sight, be began to think with himself, there might be some∣thing
in the matter more then ordinary, therefore resolved to go a little
nearer to the shore, and then he perceived they had a great minde to
speak with him, using much importunity for that end, insomuch as he
ventured to go a shore amongst them, having but one English-man, and
two Indians with him, he directed them to keep off the Canoo, while he
discoursed with the Indians ashore: as soon as ever he came amongst
them; they told him they were weary of fighting, and that they had
fought so long by <HI>Philips</HI> instigation, but they could not tell for what end,
and therefore were resolved they would fight no longer; and that which
they desired of him only was, that he would make way for them to the
Governour, that they might live quietly amongst the English, as they
had done before, and that they would deliver up their Arms, or would
go out with them, if he pleased to accept of them, and fight for him:
<PB N="105" REF="000231_0117_0FA9AC4E80F53D40"/>
to that end they desired a time to parly with him, further about that
business, at what time and place he would appoint: He told them he
would meet them two dayes after at <HI>Saconet,</HI> a place up higher upon
the said neck, about twelve a clock; accordingly he came to the said
place, and found the same Indians, with some others, and their <HI>Sunke
Squaw,</HI> or chief woman of that Indian Plantation, there ready to meet
him.</P>
<P>After they had fallen into discourse about the beginning of the warr,
as well as the success and mischief of it, they would have put the blame
off from themselves, and laid it upon the English: But he presently
convinced them by an undeniable evidence, that they first began the
warr; For said he upon this <HI>Pocasset, Iuly,</HI> 7. 1675. you first fought with
some of <HI>Road-Island,</HI> whereof one was my own Servant, whose leg you
brake, and the same day you shot at my self and Company, before ever
we meddled with you: They were so fully convinced herewith, that
they found nothing to reply, but fell into other discourse about a peace,
which they seemed very desirous to obtain upon any equal tearms, as
was said before.</P>
<P>There were about fifteen of the Indians present, beside their <HI>Sunke
Squaw</HI> (which is with us their Governess or Lady) in conclusion they
engaged for ever after to leave <HI>Philip,</HI> and to goe out with him; which
they did forthwith, as soon as he had obtained a peace for them with
the Governour.</P>
<P>It is here to be minded, that these were not properly <HI>Philips Indians,</HI>
but belonged to the <HI>Sakonet Squaw,</HI> who was nearly related to <HI>Philip,</HI>
and her Subjects had hitherto fought in <HI>Philips</HI> Quarrell, till they saw
nothing but misery and mischief like to be the issue of it to themselves,
as well as their neighbours. About twenty or thirty of these <HI>Sakonet
Indians</HI> have constantly gone out with Capt. <HI>Church</HI> ever since, and not
only been faithfull and serviceable to him, but very successfull in every
enterprise they have gone about, nor hath he lost any of them in any
skirmish with the other-Indians: And it is said that this act of these
Indians broke <HI>Philips</HI> heart, as soon as ever he understood it, so as he
never joyed after, or had any success in any of his designs, but lost his
men one time after another, till himself at last fell into the hands of
these Indians under Capt. <HI>Churches</HI> Command: For at the swamp when
<HI>Philip</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain, Capt. <HI>Church</HI> appointed an Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish man and an Indian
to stand at such a place of the swampe, where it hapned that <HI>Philip</HI> was
breaking away; the morning being wet and rainy, the English mans gun
would not fire, the Indian having an old Musket with a large touch-hole,
<PB N="106" REF="000231_0118_0FA9AC4F422AD328"/>
it took fire the more readily, with which <HI>Philip</HI> was dispatched, the bul∣let
passing directly through his heart, where <HI>Ioab</HI> thrust his darts into
rebellious <HI>Absalom.</HI></P>
<P>Thus did divine vengeance retalliate upon this notorious Traitor, that
had against his league and Covenant, risen up against the Government
of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to raise up against him one of his own people, or one that
was in league with him, as he was with the English: The Indian that did
this execution was called <HI>Alderman</HI> of <HI>Sako<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that had never done any
act of hostility against the English.</P>
<P>By these passages it is manifest, that as <HI>the hearts of all are in the hand
of God▪ so he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urns them as he pleases,</HI> either to favour his people, or to
hate and deal subtilly with his Servants, as seems good to him.</P>
<P>Since this engagement with the <HI>Sakonet Indians,</HI> to leave <HI>Philip,</HI> and to
goe out with Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> it is credibly affirmed; that such hath been
their success, that since <HI>Iune</HI> aforesaid, to the end of <HI>October</HI> next follow∣ing,
there have been seven hundred Indians subdued, either by killing or
taking Captive, by the meanes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Capt. <HI>Church</HI> and his Company, part
Indians and part English▪ besides three hundred that have come in vo∣luntarily
to submit themselves to the Government of <HI>Plimouth.</HI></P>
<P>It appears thus by the sequell of things, that after the Lord hath ac∣complished
his work upon his people, that he is beginning to call his e∣nemyes
to an account, and punish them for the pride of their hearts, and
for all their treachery and cruelty against his Servants.</P>
<P><HI>Philips</HI> Captains have run the same fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with himself, some before and
some after his own Fall.</P>
<P>In <HI>Iune</HI> last one <HI>Tia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>q</HI> a great Captain of his, his wife and child, or
children being taken, though he escaped himself at first, yet came
since and surrendred himself.</P>
<P>The next noted Captain of <HI>Philips Indians</HI> that was brought in after
<HI>Philip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> death, was one called <HI>Tespiquin,</HI> a notorious Villain, next to
<HI>Philip,</HI> he was called the black Sachems son: It was this <HI>Tespiquin</HI> that
burnt so many houses in <HI>Plimouth</HI> lately. Capt. <HI>Church</HI> with his Com∣pany
were in pursuit of him in <HI>September</HI> last, two dayes before they
could get near him, at the last on the third day, they found the track
made by the said <HI>Tespiquins</HI> party, as they went to fetch apples from
the English Orchards: This was something a blind track, therefore
they were forced to take up their quarters that night without discove∣ring
any place of their Rendezvouze. The next morning about nine
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lock, they came to their first Rendezvouze, from which they
were newly gone: at one a clock they came to the second, and missing
<PB N="107" REF="000231_0119_0FA9AC5007BA4580"/>
them there, they soon after came to the third track, wherein after they
had m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ched a while, they perceived they grew very near them, by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rying of a child which they heard: the place was near <HI>Lakenham</HI> upon
<HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asset</HI> neck, so full of bushes that a man could not see a rod before
him: Capt. <HI>Church</HI> ordered his men to march up together in one
ranke, because he discovered the Indians were laid in one Range by se∣veral
fires; so that by that time they all came up into an even ranke
pretty near together, within a few yards of them, as he had appointed,
they all suddenly rushed altogether in upon them, and catched hold of
them, not suffering any to escape; there being about fifty of them in all:
<HI>Tespequins</HI> wife and children were there, but himself was absent; as also
one <HI>Iacob,</HI> and a girle that belonged to that company. The Captains
leisure would not serve him to wait till they came in, (though the Indi∣ans
said they might come that night) whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore he thought upon this
project; to leave two old <HI>Squawes</HI> upon the place, with victuals, and bid
them tell <HI>Tespiquin,</HI> that he should be his Captain over his Indians if he
were found so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>out a man, as they reported him to be; for the Indians
had said that <HI>Tespiquin</HI> could not be pierced by a bullet, for said they, he
was shot twice, but the bullets glanced by him and could not hurt him.
Thus the Captain marched away with his booty, leaving this Trap be∣hind
him to take the rest▪ the next morning he came to see what his
Trap had catch'd, there he found <HI>Iacob</HI> aforesaid (a notorious wretch)
and the gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e he missed before, but not <HI>Tespiquin:</HI> But within a day or
two after, the said <HI>Tespiquin,</HI> upon the hopes of being made a Captain
under Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> came after some of the Company, and submitted
himself in the Captains absence; and was sent to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> but upon tri∣al
(which was the condition on which his being promised a Captains
place under Capt. <HI>Church</HI> did depend) he was found penetrable by the
English gunns, for he fell down at the first shot, and thereby received
the just reward of his former wickedness.</P>
<P>About a Fortnight after the surprising of <HI>Tespiquin,</HI> was one <HI>Totoso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
company taken, wherein were above fifty persons: but <HI>Totoson</HI> himself
escaped, and is out still in Rebellion, unless vengeance hath overtaken
him since.</P>
<P>The next that was seized after the former, was one called <HI>Annawan;</HI>
a very subtle, politick Fellow, and one of <HI>Philips</HI> chief Counsellors; he
had about twelve men, and as many Women and Children in his Com∣pany,
who were discovered by their shooting at the English Horses, and
other Cattle; some of whom being taken, they made known the rest.
Capt. <HI>Church</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that time had but five English men, and twenty Indians.
<PB N="108" REF="000231_0120_0FA9AC50B47D0AD0"/>
The place where this <HI>Annawan</HI> had betaken himself, was a ledge of Rocks
inaccessible, but at one place, which by a few hands, might easily have
been defended against a great number of Assailants: but Capt. <HI>Church</HI>
by direction got up to their Wigwams before they were aware: and
pleasantly told <HI>Annawan,</HI> that he came to sup with him that night;
whereat the said <HI>Annawan</HI> (who had fallen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the Earth, exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct∣ing
to have his head cut off) looked up and cried <HI>Taubut,</HI> in their Lan∣guage;
<HI>thank you,</HI> as one being much affected with the generosity of our
English Captain; they found some of the English Beef boyling in their
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettles: After Supper much discourse had with the said <HI>Annawan,</HI> they
lay down to sleep together in the Wigwam: Capt. <HI>Church</HI> laying one
of his legs upon <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>wans</HI> Son, and the other upon himself, that he
might have notice, if any of them offered to stir: after midnight <HI>Anna∣wan</HI>
rose up, and Capt. <HI>Church</HI> was presently awake, and intended to
watch after his Prisoner: he thought at the first he might have gone
forth upon some necessary occasion; but not long after, he returned
again, having fetched out of a Swamp hard by, two Horns of Powder
and a large Belt of Peag, supposed to be <HI>Philips</HI> Belt, all which he delive∣red
to Capt. <HI>Church,</HI> in way of thankful acknowledgement of his cour∣tesie.
Amongst other Discourse that passed between them, concerning
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> occasion of the War, and carrying of it on: the Indian would fain
have excused <HI>Philip,</HI> and layd the blame upon the Praying Indians (as
they are distinguished from others by that Character) and others of
the younger sort of his Followers, who coming with their several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ales
(which he li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ened to sticks laid on a heap) till by the multitude of
them a great fire came to be kindled: they make much use of parabolical
expressions; for so said <HI>Solo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, Where no wood is, there the fire go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th out;
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where there is no tale-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strife ceaseth,</HI> Prov. 26. 20. But <HI>Philip</HI>
had had large and long experi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e of the gentleness and kindness of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nglish; both to himself and to his P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ple so as unless he had born an
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and malicious mind against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he would never have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ear∣kened
to those stories, contrary to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aithful promise and Allegiance.</P>
<P>The said <HI>Annawan</HI> confessed also, that he did believe by all those late
occurrents, that there was a great God, that over-ruled all; and that
he had found, that whatever he had done to any of those, whether Indi∣ans
or English, the same was brought upon himself in after time. He
confessed also, that he had put to death several of the English, that they
had taken alive, ten in one day: and could not deny, but that some of
them had been tortured: and now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could not but see the justice of
the great God upon himself, with many other things of like nature.
<PB N="109" REF="000231_0121_0FA9AC5172A7D1B8"/>
But whatever his confessions of this nature were, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> him
by the power of Conscience, after he was delivered up to Authority, he
was put to death, as he justly had deserved.</P>
<P>It is said that <HI>Philip</HI> when he first began his Rebellion, had about three
hundred fighting men under him, besides those that belonged to his
Kins-woman, <HI>Wetamoe,</HI> drowned about <HI>Taunton,</HI> that had almost as ma∣ny
under her, as himself. And one <HI>Quenopin,</HI> a <HI>Narrhaganset</HI> Sachem,
that lived near him, and joyned with him in his quarrel with the English:
But it is certain that there are scarce any that are now left that belonged
to either of them: so as although the Almighty hath made use of them
to be a scourge to his People, he hath now turned his hand against them,
to their utter destruction, and exti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pation from off the face of the earth,
peradventure to make room for others of his People to come in their
room, and in their stead.</P>
<P>As for the rest of the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> that joyned in <HI>Philips</HI> quarrel,
it is already declared, what end they were come unto. As for the rest
of the Indians, whither <HI>Nipnet, Nashaway, Pacomp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uck,</HI> or <HI>Hadly</HI> and
<HI>Springfield</HI> Indians; it is not so certain what is become of them: But
after their separation one from the other about <HI>Iuly last;</HI> it was obser∣ved
by all the Tracks in those Woods, they went still westward▪ and a∣bout
the middle of <HI>August</HI> last, a great party of them were observed to
pass by <HI>West field,</HI> a small Town to the west of <HI>Springfield,</HI> and were
judged to be about two hundred▪ News thereof being brought to Ma∣jor
<HI>Talcot,</HI> he with the Souldiers of <HI>Connecticut Colony</HI> under his com∣mand,
both English and Indians, pursued after them as far as <HI>Ausotun∣noog</HI>
River (in the middle way betwixt <HI>West field,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch River,</HI>
and <HI>Fort Albany)</HI> where he overtook them, and fought with them; kil∣ling
and taking Prisoners forty five, whereof twenty five were fighting
men, without the loss of any one of his Company besides a <HI>Moheg in</HI>
Indian: many of the rest were sorely wounded, as appeared by the dab∣bling
of the Bushes with blood, as was observed by them that followed
them a little further.</P>
<P>It is wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten since from <HI>Albany,</HI> that there were sundry lost besides the
forty five forementioned, to the number of threescore in all; and also
that an hundred and twenty of them are since dead of sickness: so as
Vengeance seems to be pursuing of them as well as the rest.</P>
<P>Several of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Friends that belonged to <HI>Nashaway,</HI> and the places
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joyning, repaired to <HI>Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ataqua,</HI> hoping to shrowd themselves under

<PB N="110" REF="000231_0122_0FA9AC52C023C058"/>
of a Dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tation set out by the Governour and Council of the <HI>Massa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sets</HI>
in the beginning of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> last: but some of our Forces, under
Capt. <HI>Hath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rne</HI> and Capt. <HI>Sill,</HI> with the help of Major <HI>Walden,</HI> Captain
<HI>Frost,</HI> and others r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siding in those parts, being than in a readiness, sepa∣rated
the vile, and wicked from the rest, and sent them down to the Go∣vernour
at <HI>Boston,</HI> where eight or nine of the Ring-leaders, such as one
eyed <HI>Iohn,</HI> Sagamore <HI>Sam</HI> of <HI>Nashaway,</HI> chief Actors of the late out∣rages,
and bloudy mischiefs had justice done upon them soon after.</P>
<P>As for the Massacres and Calamities that befel the English further
Eastward, they shall in the second part of this Narrative be declared.</P>
<P>The Indians being thus dispersed several wayes, were strangly con∣founded,
and destroyed one parcel after another▪ untill there was none
left in the western or southern parts, that durst make any opposition all
the following part of the year.</P>
<P>As for those that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed westward toward <HI>Albany,</HI> we shall there leave
them for the present, wishing we may never hear more of them: Only
a person of Quality informeth, that at <HI>Hartford,</HI> in <HI>September</HI> last, he
was present at the examination of one <HI>Choos,</HI> an <HI>Indian,</HI> formerly of
<HI>Connecticut,</HI> but one of the <HI>Narrhaganset Fort</HI> the last winter, who con∣fessed
that he was one of that Company of Indians that went westward
the moneth befor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> toward <HI>Hudsons River;</HI> but after the fight at <HI>Ausotun∣noog,</HI>
he said he returned back to <HI>Connecticut</HI> for fear of the <HI>Mohawks;</HI>
and that he lay hid about <HI>Farmington,</HI> till he was almost starved; and
then he went to the Sea-side, to make use of the Oister-bank at <HI>Strat∣ford</HI>
for his relief, where he was espyed by the Indians, and so brought
to <HI>Hartford.</HI></P>
<P>He affirmed, that there were above two hundred and fifty fighting
men amongst those <HI>Indians</HI> that fled westward, besides women and chil∣dren;
and that near two hundred of them passed the great River below
<HI>Albany,</HI> and were shel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red by the Indians of that place, called <HI>Mohe∣ganders;</HI>
but about eighty of them tarried on the hither side of that <HI>River</HI>
near a <HI>Dutch</HI> village. But he being convicted of fighting against the
<HI>English,</HI> was condemned to dye, and executed about the same time.</P>
<P>Some few of the rest were skulking about the <HI>Narrhaganset Country</HI>
the last Fall, hoping to shelter themselves under <HI>Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> but he not wil∣ling
to give them countenance against the mind of his friends at <HI>Conne∣cticut,</HI>
hath since abandoned them to shift for themselves, who have been
most of them taken and brought in prisoners to the English this winter.</P>
<P>About the Moneth of <HI>October</HI> last, Mr. <HI>Stanton</HI> chanced to come from
<HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conke</HI> with three <HI>Indians</HI> in his company <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qnods,</HI> or <HI>Mohegins,</HI> they
<PB N="111" REF="000231_0123_0FA9AC5505632A68"/>
hearing by a Captive at one of the next towns that there was a parcel
of the enemy not for off, presently left Mr. <HI>Stanton,</HI> and pursued after
them, whom they soon after overtook, and made them all prisoners:
amongst them was an old man, not able to goe their pace, but promising
to come after them, they spared his life: but as soon as the men re∣torned
at night from hunting, the old man told them what had befalne
their women and children; whereupon the next morning they presently
following after them, overtook them, and so recovered the prisoners,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew one of the three that carried them away; the other two hardly
escaped; one of them is called Major <HI>Symon,</HI> being part a <HI>Peqnod</HI> and
part a <HI>Narrhagansc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> but of extraordinary strength and courage; he
perceiving the danger they were in, challenged to fight hand to hand
with any five of them with their hatches; but they unwilling to hang
their success upon the hazzard of a single Combate, came all towards
him at once, whereupon first discharging his gun amongst the whole
Company, he brake through them all by force, and so escaped their
hands, with one more that was one of his companions. This <HI>Symon</HI> hath
since been very active in killing and taking many of the enemy; some say
that he with his own hands hath taken and killed above threescore; and
either out of hatred to the enemy, or love to the English, is this last
week gone with the Souldiers to the eastward, in pursuit of our quar∣rel
against them in those parts.</P>
<P>At another time not long before, when he was out against the enemy;
he came suddenly upon a great number of them, as they were spread
under a steep banke, from whence leaping down into the midest of them
he killed diverse, and took others: Fighting it seems is a recreation to
him, for he is seldome at home above four or five dayes together.</P>
<P>Some say that in one of his former expeditions, being much wearied
and spent, he laid him down to sleep; but towards morning he fell into
a dream, wherein he apprehended the Indians were upon him, where
suddenly rising up he espyed the Indians coming toward him; but pre∣sently
presenting his gunns against them, he so frighted them, that they
gave him an opportunity to make an escape from a multitude of them.</P>
<P>Since the beginning of <HI>December</HI> last, News coming down to <HI>Boston,</HI>
that mischief was done about <HI>Seaconk,</HI> and <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> by some remain∣der
of the Indians thereabout, killing their swine and horses; several of
<HI>Medfield</HI> went out after them, and pursuing them by their track, came
upon a small party, of whom they took three, one of which escaped,
while some of the company were going after the rest: They which were
taken confessed there were a parcell about threescore, that were lurking
<PB N="112" REF="000231_0124_0FA9AC553B5A0BC8"/>
up and down in those Woods, the said two Indians were brought into
<HI>Boston,</HI> Jan. 8.</P>
<P>A Commiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on was formerly granted to <HI>Peter Ephrai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> an Indian of
<HI>Natick,</HI> to go out in pursuit of them, with twenty nine of his Compa∣ny:
a few of the English went with them from <HI>Medfield,</HI> who being
tired with marching in the Snow soon returned. The Indians kept on
in their design, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghted upon a considerable party of the Enemy, ha∣ving
traced them, till they found where they lodged over night;
they surrounded them early in the morning, as their manner is, and
then offered them quarter, if they would yield: eight resolute fellows
refused, who were presently shot down, the rest were all seiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, the
whole being in number forty two. This was done abont the middle of
<HI>Ianuary</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, since which time, several such exploits have been done by
them.</P>
<P><HI>Ian.</HI> 23. last, The same Company of <HI>Natick Indians</HI> took two and
twenty of the Enemy, among which were five able men, and five Arms:
they sent the Prisoners home by five of their Company, the rest went
further in the chase.</P>
<P><HI>Ian.</HI> 26. last, Another parcel of the Enemy were brought in, eight in
number, of whom five were men; amongst whom was the Indian called
<HI>Cornelius:</HI> who three years since was indicted for killing an English∣mans
Cow; upon which he is said to have uttered several threatning
speeches, that he would kill English men, and their Cows too; which
was now remembred against him, when he was in particular called to
account, for having an hand in killing some of the English and Indians
also in league with us, for which he was sentenced to dy, and was accor∣dingly
executed on <HI>Febr.</HI> 15. last.</P>
<P>Concerning the rest of the Indians, either in the Colony of <HI>Plimouth,
Connecticut,</HI> or the <HI>Massachusets;</HI> there is no occurrent more of mo∣ment
come to light, since the end of <HI>August</HI> last, save what is last men∣tioned
before; yet is it very remarkable that although tearms of peace

appears by a Declaration put out <HI>Iuly</HI> last) and that a <HI>Nipnet</HI> Sachem
called <HI>Iohn,</HI> did thereupon with a considerable number of his Company
come in, and offer themselves, and were accordingly secured of their
lives, and other concernments; yet did that treacherous Varlot make
an escape away, this winter from Capt. <HI>Prentices</HI> House (under whose
charge he was put, about <HI>Cambridge</HI> Village) and with above twenty
more fled away into the Woods, to shift for himself, amongst the rest of
his bloody Companions; they were presently pursued, but had gone
<PB N="113" REF="000231_0125_0FA9AC5602710FA0"/>
tho fast and too far to be overtaken: whither it were consciousness of
their own guilt, that having had an hand in the bloud of the English,
they feared vengeance hung over their heads: or whither they liked
not the English manners so well, as to be confined thereunto: wild
creatures ordinarily love the liberty of the woods, better than the re∣straint
of a cage. They made none acquainted with their designe be∣fore
they went away; and as yet little account can be given of them: on∣ly
it is known that one or two of their number have since been killed;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that one or two of their Families are entertained by <HI>Uncas;</HI> but
what is become of the rest is yet uncertain: There were but seven of
the Company men; so as they are not capable to do much mischief.
Some of late have travailed through the woods of <HI>Connecticut,</HI>
but met with no Indians, nor did they hear of any in their passing be∣tween
that place and this.</P>
<P>And because in the present <HI>Narrative,</HI> there hath been frequent men∣tion
made of <HI>Unc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Mohegin Sachem,</HI> and of his faithfulness to the

the <HI>Narrhagansets:</HI> yet hath he not long since been convinced of the
truth of our Religion, and vanity of his own, as himself hath solemnly

person it relates unto, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Fitch,</HI> Pastor of the Church at
<HI>Norwich,</HI> near unto which <HI>Vncas</HI> his place is.</P>
<P>There was a great drought the last Summer, but as it seems, it was
more extream in those parts then with us about the <HI>Massachusets;</HI> and
although probably, the English might have prayed for rain themselves
without any motion from the Indians, yet their address to the said Mr.
<HI>Fitch</HI> on such an account, with the consequences thereof, is very re∣markable,
which take in his own words,</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>Concerning the Drought <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the true Narrative of that Provi∣dence
is this,</HEAD>
<P>In <HI>August</HI> last, such was the want of rain, that the Indian corn was
not only dryed and parched up, but the apple-trees withered, the fruit
and leaves fell off as in Autumn, and some trees seemed to be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad with
that D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought: the Indians came into town and did lament their want
of rain, and that their <HI>Powawes</HI> could got none in their way of worship
<PB N="114" REF="000231_0126_0FA9AC56D39CC080"/>
desiring me that I would seek to God for rain: I appointed a Fast day
for that purpose. The day being come, it proved a cleer day without
any clouds, untill nigh sun setting, when we came from the Meeting,
and then some Clouds arose; the next day remained cloudy, then <HI>Vncas</HI>
with many Indians came to my house, <HI>Vncas</HI> lamented there was such
want of Rain; I asked whether if God should send us rain, he would
not attribute it to their <HI>Powawes:</HI> He answered no, for they had done
their uttermost and all in vain: I replyed, if you will declare it before
all these Indians, you shall see what God will doe for us; For although
this year he hath shewn his anger against the English, and not only a∣gai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st
the Indians, yet he hath begun to save us, and I have found by
experience twice in the like case, when we sought him by Fasting and
Prayer, he hath given us Rain, and never denyed us. Then <HI>Vncas</HI>
made a great speech to the Indians (which were many) confessing that
if God should then send rain it could not be ascribed to their powaw∣ing,
but must be acknowledged to be an answer of our prayers. This
day the clouds spread more and more, and the next day there was such
plenty of rain, that our River rose more then two foot in height.</P></DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P>By all that is recorded in the <HI>Narrative</HI> foregoing there are none into
whose hands it shall come, but will be sensible that the present time hath
been a day of great rebuke &amp; trouble to the poor people so journing in
this wilderness, upon whom sundry calamities have broke in at once this
last as well as in the former years: in many places they have been visited
with sickness, and mortality more then in many years before, depriving
them of many worthy and usefull persons; amongst others the loss of
Mr. <HI>Iohn Winthrope</HI> the late worthy Governour of the Colony of <HI>Con∣necticut,</HI>
is as it ought, much lamented by all, who dyed at <HI>Boston, April</HI>
5. 1676. in the 73. year of his age, whither he was occasionally called
the last winter to sit with the rest of the Commissioners, of the united
Colonyes, to consult about the great affairs of them, now newly enga∣ged
in these troubles from the Heathen. He was the eldest son of the
famous Governour of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> deceased, <HI>March, 26, 1649.

long ago yet lives still in the minds of the surviving Generation, and is
like to continue much longer, by the remembrance of the eminent vir∣tues
found in this the eldest of his off-spring, who being not long after,
or about that time called to take up his residence in that Colony, was by
the importunity of the people there, prevailed with to accept of the
Governours place, which for a long time after, he held over that Colony
<PB N="115" REF="000231_0127_0FA9AC57836268C8"/>
though annually chosen thereunto; being so well furnished with many
excellent endowments, as well moral as political and philosophical, which
rendred him most fit to be an healer of that people. Though we are
dealing in another subject, yet shall not pass by his Tomb, as we goe a∣long,
without paying the homage due to the memory of so honourable
a Gentleman.</P>
<P>After all the forementioned Calamityes and troubles, it pleased God
to alarme the town of <HI>Boston,</HI> and in them the whole Country, by a sad
Fire, accidentally kindled by the carelesness of an Apprentice, that sate
up too late overnight, as was conceived; which began an hour before
day, continuing three or four, in which time it burned down to the
ground forty six dwelling houses, besides other Buildings, together with
a Meeting house of considerable bigness: some mercy was observed
mixt with the judgment; for if a great rain had not continued all the
time (the roofs and walls of their ordinary buildings consisting of such
combustible matter) that whole end of the town had at that time been
consumed.</P>
<P>Whereby we see that God by his providence can turn our dwellings
into ash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, without the help of either forreign or domestick enemies.
Which consideration may awaken all from security, and confidence in
these uncertain and unstable possessions, that have no firmer Foundati∣on,
that may so soon after their first erection, be eaten up by the flames
of fire, before the iron teeth of time have had leisure to devour and feed
upon them.</P>
<CLOSER>God grant that by the <HI>Fire</HI> of all these Iudgments, we may be purged from

<P>THere was a Nation of the Indians in the Southern parts of <HI>New-England,</HI>
called <HI>Pequods,</HI> seated on a fair Navigable River, twelve
miles to the Eastward of the mouth of the great and famous River of
<HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ecticot;</HI> who (as was commonly reported about the time when
<HI>New-England</HI> was first planted by the English) being a more fierce,
cruel, and warlike People then the rest of the Indians; came down o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
of the more inland parts of the Contine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and by force seized upon one
of the goodliest places near the Sea, and became a terr our to all their
<PB N="118" REF="000231_0129_0FA9AC59239C1AA8"/>
Neighbours, on whom they had exercised several acts in inhumane cru∣elty;
insomuch that being fleshed with Victories over their Fellow-indi∣ans;
they began to thirst after the blood of any Forreigners, <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Dutch</HI> that accidentally came amongst them, in a way of Trade, or
upon other Accounts.</P>
<P>In the year 1634. they treacherously and cruelly murthered Captain
<HI>Stone,</HI> and Captain <HI>Norton,</HI> who came occasional<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y with a Bark into the
River to Trade with them. Not long after, within the compass of the
next year, they in like treacherous manner, slew one Mr. <HI>Ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ham</HI> (for∣merly
belonging to <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> but at that time an Inhabitant of the
<HI>Massachusets)</HI> at <HI>Block Island</HI> a place not far from the mouth of
their Harbour, as he was fairly Trading with them: besides some other
such like acts of persideous cruel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y towards some of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that
had formerly been trading up <HI>Connecticut River:</HI> by which practises
perceiving that they began to stink in the nosthrils of their Neighbours,
whose revenge they now began to fear, and not willing to have to deal
with too many Enemies at once, they imitated the subtlety of the Chil∣dren
of <HI>Ammon,</HI> when they began to stink before <HI>David;</HI> endeavour∣ing
to strengthen themselves with allyance of some of those they had
formerly provoked, that by their assistance they might defend them∣selves
against the rest, not doubting but to make their part good with
their forreign Enemies, if they could be reconciled to their Indian
Neighbours, the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> or other home-bred Enemies, if they
could but fortifie themselves by a League of Friendship with any of their
forreign Neighbours that were newly come to plant in these parts. To
this end they sent Messengers with gifts to the <HI>Massachusets</HI> in the lat∣ter
end of the same year 1634. the first Messengers were dismissed with∣out
an answer: but they being sensible of their own danger, and of the
great importance a peace with the English of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> might be,
pursued the business very earnestly, sending Messengers a second time,
who offered much <HI>Wampam</HI> (Indians Money) and Beaver; with these
second Messengers the Governour and Council of the <HI>Massachusets</HI>
had much conference many dayes; and at last after the best advice they
could take amongst themselves, concluded a Peace and Friendship with
them, upon these Conditions.</P>
<P>1. That they should deliver up to the English those persons amongst
them that were guilty of Captain <HI>Stones</HI> Death, and the rest that were
with him.</P>
<P>2. That if the English desired to Plant in <HI>Connecticut</HI> they should
give up their right to them.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="000231_0130_0FA9AC5DCBB9F400"/>
3. That the English should thence forward Trade with them as their
Friends, which was à chief thing aimed at, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the said <HI>Pequods</HI> being at that
time in War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and the rest of their Neighbours, on the
Reasons forementioned, to these conditions they readily agreed, and also
cunningly insinuated their desire that their new Confederates, the <HI>Mas∣sachusets</HI>
should mediate a peace for them with the <HI>Narrhagansets;</HI> inti∣mating
likewise their willingness that a part of the Present which they
promised to send should be given to them, standing so much upon their
ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, that they would not be seen to give any thing themselves; such
was the pride and height of Spirit lodged in this company of Treache∣rous
Villains, the Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gs and Lees of the Earth, and Drosse of Man∣kinde.</P>
<P>As for Capt. <HI>Stone</HI>'s death they slily evaded the guilt of it, falsly ad∣ding
that there were but two left that had any hand therein, and that it
was a just quarrel wherein he was slain: for, said they, he surprised
some of our men, and would by force have compelled them to shew him
the way up the River, whereupon the said <HI>Stone</HI> coming ashore, with two
more, was watched by nine of our men (say they) who finding the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a∣sle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p
in the night, slew them to deliver our own men, one of whom go∣ing
afterward to the Barque, it was suddenly blown up, whereas the
truth of the matter was thus,</P>
<P>The said Capt. <HI>Stone</HI> formerly belonging to <HI>Christophers</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
occasionally coming to these parts, as he passed between this
place and <HI>Virginia</HI> put in at that River, where the Indians after they had
been often on board his Vessell to trade with him; at the last came friendly
on board as they used to doe, but finding the Captain asleep in his Cab∣bin,
took the opportunity to murther him as he lay, casting a Cover∣ing
over him that he might not be discerned by the res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom they pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ently
after dispatched one after another, all but Capt. <HI>Norton,</HI> who made
flout resistance, for a long time defending himself in the Cook-room of
the Barke, till the gun-powder which he had set in an open vessell, to be
more ready for his use, accidentally took fire, by which fatal accident
he was so burned &amp; his eyes so blinded that he could not make any long∣er
resistance, but forthwith fell into the hands of these cruel and bloud∣thirsty
wretches, who after they had taken away his life made a prey of
all that was in the Vessell.</P>
<P>As for Mr. <HI>Oldman</HI> he was indeed murthered at an Island called by the
India<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Manisses</HI> (since known among the English by the name of <HI>Block-Islan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>)
bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those that murthered him (probably Inhabitants of the said
Island) fled presently to the <HI>Pequods,</HI> by whom they were sheltered, and
<PB N="120" REF="000231_0131_0FA9AC609E5A4B50"/>
so became also guilty themselves of his bloud, which ere long was re∣venged
by them, as is in the next place to be declared.</P>
<P>The English of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> after the peace concluded with the
<HI>Pequods,</HI> sent a Barke thither for trade, that trial might be made of the
reality of their friendship, but they found them treacherous and false,
and that no advantage was to be had by any commerce with them, inso∣much
as they took up a resolution never more to have to doe with them;
which the said Indians perceiving, made no account of the former peace,
but took all advantage to do us mischief, not only by harbouring those
who had murthered Mr. <HI>Oldham,</HI> but surprizing many of the English
in the year 1636. when <HI>Connecticut River</HI> began first to be planted, di∣vers
of whom were killed (nine at one time in <HI>April</HI> 1637.) by them
about <HI>Wethers field,</HI> when the Plantation then first began, so as they could
not pass up and down the River without a Guard, but they would be in
danger of being cut off or carried away, as two Maids were said to be;
thirty men have been killed by them in all; those who fell into their
hands alive, were cruelly tortured after a most barbarous manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by
insulting over their Prisoners in a blasphemous wise, when in their dy∣ing
Agonies, under the extremity of their pains (their flesh being fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed with knives, and then filled with burning Embers; they called
upon God and Christ with gasping groans, resigning up their Souls in∣to
their hands; with which words these wretched Caitifs used to mock
the English afterward, when they came within their hearing and view.</P>
<P>About the same time some Agents sent over by the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> and the
Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> built a Fort at the mouth of <HI>Connecticut River,</HI> wherein
was placed one Lieutenant <HI>Gardiner,</HI> and a convenient number of Soul∣diers
to secure the place, intended soon after to be planted, but all the
winter following <HI>(soil.)</HI> in the end of the year 1636. they were little
better then besieged by the said Salvages, not daring to stir out of com∣mand
of the Fort, but they were ready to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seized by these their bar∣barous
Enemies: At one time the Lieutenant himself with ten or
twelve of the Souldiers; marching out of the Fort, with an intent to
pass over a N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck of Land, to burn the Marshes; as soon as ever they
were passed over the streight of the Neck, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y espyed a Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny of
Indians making towards the said I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tmus, which if they could not reco∣ver,
they see they must all perish; whereupon returning back with all
speed, they very narrowly escaped, and were two or three of them kil∣led
notwithstanding, before they could get back into the Fort, which
was presently surrounded wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> multitudes of them; but the discharging
of a plece of Ordnance gave them warning to keep further from the
<PB N="121" REF="000231_0132_0FA9AC628C869E88"/>
Walls: sometimes they came with their Canooes into the river in vie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
the Souldiers within the Fort, and when they apprehended themselves
out of reach of their gunns, they would imitate the dying groans &amp; invo∣cations
of the poor Captive English, which the English Souldiers were
forced with silent patienc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> bear; not being then in a capacity to requite
their insolent blasphemyes. But they being by these horrible outra∣ges
justly provoked to indignation, unanimously agreed to joyn their
Forces together to root them out of the earth with Gods Assi∣stance.</P>
<P>The Colony of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> did immediately set about it in the
latter end of the Summer (1636) by sending out fourscore men under
the Command of Capt. <HI>Endicot</HI> of <HI>Salem,</HI> who went to the <HI>Pequoa Coun∣try</HI>
by water, with Commission to treat with the said <HI>Pequods,</HI> first offer∣ing
terms of peace, if they would surrender the Murtherers of the En∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh,
and for bear further acts of hostility, or else fight them.</P>
<P>The Captain aforesaid coming ashore with his Company, by a mes∣sage
sent them by an interpreter, obtained some little speech with a
great number of them at a distance; but after they understood what
was propounded to them, first cunningly getting b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hind a hill,
they presently ran away into the Woods and Swamps, where there
was no pursuing of them: however one discharging a gun among them
as they were taking their fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght, stayed the course of one, which was all
that could be done against them for that time.</P>
<P>Winter approaching, and no encouragement presenting further to
pursue them; at that time it was resolved better to return back for the
present, and wait a further season when more Forces could be gathered
together to pursue the quarrel to the utmost.</P>
<P>During this interim the <HI>Pequods</HI> perceiving that they had by several
late injuryes and outr ages, drawn upon themselves the hatred of all the
English, as well as of their own people by former wrongs; and distrusting
their own ability to deal with them all at once, did at the last by all sub∣tle
insinuations, and perswasions, try to make their: peace with the <HI>Nar∣rhagansets,</HI>
using such Arguments as to right reason seemed not only
preg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt to the purpose; but also (if revenge that bewitching and plea∣sing
passion of mans mind had not b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inded their eyes) most cogent and
invincible: But they were by the good providence of God witheld from
embracing those counsels, which might otherwise have proved most
pernicious to the design<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of the English: <HI>viz.</HI> That the English were
Strangers, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gan to over spread the Country, the which would soon
be possessed by them to the depriving the ancient inhabitants of their
<PB N="122" REF="000231_0133_0FA9AC62C0C34830"/>
right, if they were not timely prevented; and that the <HI>Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hagansets</HI>
would but make way for their own ruine, by helping to destroy the
<HI>Peq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ads;</HI> for after themselves were subdued, it would not be long ere
the <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> themselves, would in the next place be rooted out
likewise: Whereas if they would but joyn together against the English
they could demonstrate how the English might easily either be destroyed
or forced to leave the Country, and that without any danger to them∣selves:
telling them also that they never need come to any open Battles,
they might destroy them only by firing their houses, and killing their
Cattle, and lying in wait for them as they went about their ordinary
occasions; which course if it were pursued, they said their new and un∣welcome
neighbours could not long subsist; but would either be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arved
with hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ger and cold, or forced to forsake the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Matchiavel</HI> himself if he had sate in counsel with them could not
have insinuated stronger reasons to have perswaded them to a peace.</P>
<P>It is said that so much reason was apprehended in these motives, that
the <HI>Narrbagansets</HI> were once wavering, and were almost perswaded to
have granted an ear to their advice and perswasion and joyned all again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
the English; but when they considered what an advantage they had put
into their hands by the strength and favour of the English, to take a full
revenge of all their former injuries, upon their inveterate Enem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, the
thought of that was so sweet that it turned the scale against all other
considerations whatsoever.</P>
<P>The report of the unheard of cruelties fore mentioned filling the
ears of the English throughout the Country; it was agreed by the
joynt consent of the English throughout the three Colonies to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all
their Forces together, for the suppressing the common Enemy, early in
the Spring <HI>Anno,</HI> 1637. who were also moved thereunto by their own
necessities as well as by the earnest request of their Friends at <HI>Con∣necticut.</HI></P>
<P>Those of <HI>Plimouth</HI> being written unto by the Governour of the <HI>Mas∣sachuse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI>
appeared very cordially willing thereunto, to which end they
agreed to send fifty men at their own charge, with as much speed as the
matter required, with sufficient Leaders appointed, and a Barke provi∣ded
to carry them Provisions, and tend upon them on all occasions; but
before they could be dispatched away the next Spring, News was
brought that the Enemy was wholly routed, so as their journey was
stopped, and their good will accepted for the deed; as if they really had
been there to have born their part in the Service, their non-appearance
in time and place being not to be im puted to any backwardness in their
<PB N="123" REF="000231_0134_0FA9AC637AF0E5D0"/>
minds; but to their too late invitation to the Service; the motion fetch∣ing
a large compass from Connecticut down to the massachusets; from
whom in the last place they were solicited thereunto. And for the o∣ther
two Colonies, those of <HI>Connecticut</HI> being quickned on by the sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rr
of necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and present sense of the insolency daily acted at their very
doors, were soonest upon their March, and by the good hand of God
upon them, had given the main stroak before their Friends of the <HI>Mas∣sachusets</HI>
could come up with them, yet was there no repining for the
want of the glory of the Victory, nor was their any cause, those that
were the chief actors therein being forward to give God the glory of
the whole, and not willing to pocket up any thing thereof themselves,
acknowledging that they never saw more of God, or less of man in any
business of that nature, as may more fully be understood by particulars
ensuing.</P>
<P>The Colony of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> determined to send an hundred and
six<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, of whom an hundred and twenty were ordered under the con∣duct
of Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> of <HI>Watertown,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Trask</HI> of <HI>Salem,</HI> Capt.
<HI>Stoughton</HI> of <HI>Dorchester,</HI> being to command in chief; with whom was
sent that holy man of God Mr. <HI>Iohn Wilson</HI> (Pastor of the Church of
<HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ston</HI>) the Charets and Horsemen of our <HI>Israel,</HI> by whose Faith and
Prayer as sometimes was said of <HI>Luther</HI> (in reference to <HI>Germany</HI>) the
Country was preserved, so as it was confidently believed that no Enemy
would break in upon a place whilst he survived, which as some have ob∣served
accordingly came to pass.</P>
<P>The matter requiring great expedition, and it being long before the
whole company could be dispatched away, Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> with forty men
were sent away before hand, to be sure to meet with those of <HI>Connecti∣cot</HI>
in case they should be in action, before the rest of our Forces could
get into a readiness, which accordingly came to pass; for the main
business in taking the Fort was over, even before the said <HI>Patrick</HI> could
get thither. Capt. <HI>Vnderhill</HI> was sent by Mr. <HI>Vane</HI> the Governour to
<HI>Saybrook</HI> the winter before to strengthen the Garison there. The as∣saulting
and surprizing of which, being the most remarkable piece of
service in that whole expedition; take it as it was delivered in writing
by that valia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, faithful and prudent Commander Capt. <HI>Mason,</HI> chief in
the action, who lived long after to reap the fruit of his labour, and en∣joy
the benefit of that dayes service, having an Inheritance given him in
that part of the Country, as a just reward of his faithful service on that
day as well as at other times. <HI>Wequash</HI> a <HI>Pequod</HI> by Nation, but disgust∣ed
by the Sachem, proved a good guide, by whose direction they were
<PB N="124" REF="000231_0135_0FA9AC64408AAFE8"/>
led to a Fort near <HI>Mystick</HI> River, some miles nearer then <HI>Sassacous</HI> his
Fort, which they first intended to assault.</P>
<Q><P>On the second Wednesday of <HI>May,</HI> being the tenth day of that
Month, we set sayle with ninety men of the English in one Pink, one
Pinnace, two Boats toward the <HI>Pequods,</HI> with seventy River Indians, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ving
somewhat a long passage to <HI>Saybrook</HI> Fort, about forty of our In∣dians
desired to go down by land on Saturday, but on Munday they
went forth from the Fort, and meeting seven <HI>Pequods</HI> and <HI>Nian∣ticks,</HI>
they flew five outright, took one Prisoner and brought him, into
<HI>Saybrook</HI> Fort, where he was executed by Captain <HI>Vnderhill,</HI> the other
escaped.</P>
<P>On Munday we all landed at <HI>Saybrook</HI> Fort, and stayed there till
tuesday; Capt. <HI>Vnderhill</HI> joyning ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eteen men with himself to us:
whereupon we sent back twenty of ours to strengthen our Plantations:
and so set sayl on thursday towards <HI>Narrhaganset,</HI> and arrived there on
fryday</P>
<P>On Saturday my self, with Capt. <HI>Vnderhill,</HI> Leiftenant <HI>Sealy,</HI> with
our guard marched to <HI>Canonicus</HI> by land, being about five miles distant,
where we were kindly entertained after their manner: having bad par∣ly

friends for ought we knew, &amp; so we were with the Indians that had not
wronged English-men, the which they acknowledged, and so made a

<PB N="125" REF="000231_0136_0FA9AC6509028C90"/>
when that would be: the which being considered and debated. We
thought could not be our safest course, (though his present assistance
was much desired) for these Reasons.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> Because the day before when we had absolutely resolved to go,
the <HI>Indians</HI> plainly told us they thought we were but in jest, and also that
English-men did talk much but not fight, nay they concluded that they
would not goe on: and besides if we should deferre, we feated we should
be discovered by reason of the frequent recourse between them by cer∣tain
<HI>Squaws</HI> (who have mutual recourse) whereupon we were constra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ed
to set forward toward the <HI>Pequods,</HI> with seventy seven English, and
about sixty River Indians, and as I suppose near about two hundred
<HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> and marched that night to the eastern <HI>Nia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ticks,</HI> where
we kept our Rendezvouze that night; The Sachem of the place adding a∣bout
an hundred of his men unto us.</P>
<P>We set forward and marched about ten miles, where making an Alta
(or halt) there we held a consultation with the Indians that desired to
know what we intended; we told them that we resolved to assault <HI>Sassa∣cous</HI>
his Fort, at which they were all stricken, and as it were amazed with
fear, as they plainly confessed; and so after long debate and pressing of
them taxing them with cowardize, some of them resolved to goe along
with us, though I suppose they had no such intent, as appeared afterward;
some of them left us to the number as I suppose of an hundred or less;
and marching on five miles further, we made another Alta, where they
told us we had near a dozen miles to <HI>Sassacous</HI> his Fort as we gathered
by their relation: Being very weary in travelling with our arms, amu∣nition
and provision; we were constrained to alter our resolution, and
resolve to attempt that Fort the which they had formerly described to be
three or four miles nearer; and also one of Capt. <HI>Vnderhills</HI> men falling
put it out of doubt. But whosoever saith that Capt. <HI>Vnderhill</HI> had any
falling out about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat or any thing else, doth speak untruth: for we both
resolved to <HI>Sassacous</HI> his Fort, as we concluded in our consultation at
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rrhagauset,</HI> and so continued our resolution till we received the for∣mer
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as grounds sufficient to perswade us to the contrary, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that which was most likely to be accomplished.</P>
<P>They drew a Plot of the seituation of the <HI>Pequods</HI> and described <HI>Sassa∣co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>
his Fort to be the nearest, which was the chief cause we determined
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that first, and had no reason leading till our last Alta, where
upon the reasons formerly mentioned, we changed our res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is
they much desired and very much rejoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed; for it was dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dfull to them
to hear the name of <HI>Sassacous.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="000231_0137_0FA9AC65C3029588"/>
From thence we marched two or three miles where we kept our ren∣dezyonze,
supposing we had been within one mile of the Fort: They ha∣ving
sent an <HI>Indian</HI> to discover before hand, brought us newes that they
were secure, having been fishing with many Canooes at Sea, and diverse
of them walking here and there.</P>
<P>About two hours before day we marched toward the Fort, being wea∣ry
and much spent; many of us having slept nothing at all.</P>
<P>And so we began to march toward the Fort, the Lord being plea∣sed
wonderfully to assist and encourage us; after a tedious march of
three or four miles, about break of day we came fair in view of the Fort
standing on the top of an hill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot steep; the Indians all falling back, were
suddenly vanished out of sight, so we made an Alta, and sent back for
our Guide, who had promised to goe with us to the Fort, but his heart
we saw much failed him; we asked him what they intended who promi∣sed
to wing us▪ and to surround the Fort; he told us they were much a∣fraid;
but he seing our resolution went to them and prevailed with di∣verse
of them to come up to us; we told them their best course would be
to flanke the Fort on both sides, and having no time longer to conferre,
we proceeded; Capt. <HI>Vnderhill</HI> to the western entrance with one division,
my self with the other to the eastern as silently as possibly we could, so
it pleased God we came up with the Palisado within two rod, before we
were discovered, at which time a dog began to bark &amp; an <HI>Indian</HI> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied out,
but not being my self rightly informed by the <HI>Indian</HI> of the right en∣trance,
though there was a little postern door, the which I had thought
to have attempted to break down with my foot; but the Lord directed
me otherwise for the better; for I then feared we could not there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
with our armes, which proved true, so I suddenly hasted to the Palisa∣do,
and putting in the muzzle of my piece, discharged upon them, and
so the rest with all celerity; and suddenly hastned on toward that side
which stood toward the water; where I concluded was an entrance, and
instantly fell upon it, being only barred with two great forked boughs,
or branches of some tree, and hasting over them, I drew one after me
my Lieutenant the other way outward; then we suddenly fell upon the
Wigwams, the Indians ceyed out in most hideous manner, some issuing
out of the Wigwams, shooting at us desperately, and so creeping un∣der
beds that they had. We had resolved awhile not to have burned it,
but being we could not come at them, I then resolved to set it on fire,
after diverse of them were slain, and some of our men sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wounded:
So entring one of their wigwams, I took a fire-brand [<HI>at which time an
Indian drawing an arrow had killed him, but one</HI> Davi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>his Serjeant cut the

wherewith they were covered, and fell to a retreat and surrounded the
Fort; the fire encreasing violently, insomuch as that they were constrain∣ned
to climb to the top of the Palisadoe; from whence they were soon
fetcht down, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suppose to the number of an hundred and forty; many of
of them issuing forth were suddenly slain either by the English or Indi∣ans,
who were in a ring without us, all being dispatched and ended in
the space of an hour, having two of our men slain, and sixteen
wounded.</P>
<P>Being very hot and dry we could very hardly procure any water,
where we co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinued one hour not knowing what course to take or
which way to go, our Pinnaces not being come in, neither did we know
how far, or which way to go to them; our Interpreter being an Indian
and they so hurried and ditracted with a few hurt men, but chiefly as I
conceive with fear of the Enemy, who suddenly approached, that we
could hardly come to speak with him, who knew nothing what they in∣tended.</P>
<P>But the Enemy approaching they began to cleave unto us, and I veri∣ly
think du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st not leave us.</P>
<P>Our Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naces then coming in view with a fair gale, being guided as it
were to serve o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> necessity by the good hand of God, which I think was
never more eminently seen in a matter of like moment and less of man
in several passages. Then we set our men in order and prepared for
fight and began to march toward the Harbour where the Pinnaces w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re
to ride: the Enemy approaching Capt. <HI>Vnderhill</HI> with divers Indians
and certain English issued out to encounter them, but they would not
stand to it, for the most part they lay behind Rocks, Trees and Bushes,
we marched on they still dogging of us; sometimes desperately hazard∣ing
themselves in open field, where some of them were stain in open
view, and as we hear many <HI>wounded:</HI> I was somewhat ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lous in be∣stowing
many shot upon them needlesly, because I expected a strong op∣position;
and thus they continued to follow us till we came within two
miles of our Pinnaces where they wholly left us, which vvas near six
miles as I conceive, having then about tvvo miles more to the River.</P>
<P>Four of our wounded men we were forced to carry our selves, while
at length we hired the <HI>Indians</HI> to bear them, both in this and all their
following enterprises against the <HI>Pequods:</HI></P></Q>
<P>Here note that one <HI>Wequash</HI> a <HI>Pequod</HI> fell from his Country-men, and
proved a Guide to the English.</P>
<P>This service being thus happily accomplished by these few hands that
<PB N="128" REF="000231_0139_0FA9AC674E4F9AD0"/>
came from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> within a while after, the Forces sent from the
<HI>Massachusets</HI> under the conduct of Captain <HI>Stoughton</HI> as Commander in
chief arrived there also, who found a great part of the work done to
their hands, in the surprizal of the <HI>Pequods</HI> Fort as aforesaid, which yet
was but the breaking of the nest, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vage Wolves;

scattered all over their Country, yet so far dismayed, that they never
durst make any assault upon the English, that in several parties were
scatered about in pursuit of them.</P>
<P>It was not long after Capt. <HI>Stoughtous</HI> Souldiers came up before a news
was brought of a great number of the Enemy, that were discovered by
the side of a River up the Country, being first trapanned by the <HI>Na∣rhagansets,</HI>
under pretence of securing them, but they were truly hem∣med
in by them, though at a distance, yet so as they could not, or durst,
not sti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the place, by which means our Forces of the, <HI>Massachusets</HI>
had an easie Conquest of some undreds of them who were there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
up as in a Pound: not daring to fight, not able to fly away, and so
were all taken without any opposition: the men among them to the
number of thirty were turned presently into <HI>Charons</HI> Ferry-boat under
the command of Skipper <HI>Gallop,</HI> who dispatched them a little without
the Harbour; the Females and Children were disposed of according to
the will of the Conquerers, some being given to the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> and
other Indians that assisted in the service.</P>
<P>The rest of the Enemy being first fired out of their strong hold were
taken and destroyed, a great number of them, being seized in the places
where they intended to have hid themselves, the rest fled out of their
own Country over <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, up toward the <HI>Dutch Plantation.</HI>
Our Souldiers being resolved by Gods assistance to make a final de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ru∣ction

with sundry of them, whom they flew or took prisoners, amongst whom
were two Sachems, whom they presently beheaded; to a third that was
either a Sachem or near a kin to one, they gave his life upon condition
that he should goe and enquire where <HI>Sassacous</HI> was, and accordingly
bring them word; this <HI>Indian</HI> overlooking all other national or n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tural
obligations, in consideration of his life that was received on that conditi∣on,
proved very true and faithfull to those that sent him, his order was
to have returned in three dayes, but not being able within so short a
time to make a full discovery of the business, &amp; also find an handsome way
to escape, he made it eight dayes before he returned, in which something
fell out not a little remarkable; for those he was sent to discover, suspe∣cting
at the last by his withdrawing himself that he came for a Spye, pur∣sued
after him, so as he was forced to fly for his life, and getting down
to the Sea-side he accidentally met with a Canooe a little before turned
adrift, by which means he padled by some shift o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other so farr out of the
harbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that making a sign he was discerned of some on board one of
the Vessels that attended on our Souldiers, by whom being taken up he
made known what he had discovered: But after he was gone <HI>Sassacous</HI>
suspecting (and not without just cause) what the matter was, made his
escape from the rest with twenty or thirty of his men to the <HI>Mohawkes,</HI>
by whom himself and they were all murthered afterward, being hired
thereunto by the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> as was confidently affirmed &amp; believed.</P>
<P>Thus this treac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erous and cruel Villain with his Companions, having
against his Faith and promise, as well as contrary to the Lawes of nature

<P>It is worthy our observation, that this <HI>Sassacous</HI> the chief Sachem
of the <HI>Pequods,</HI> as <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Mount-hope,</HI> (both of them in their several

to the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>most degree of indignation, that so they might not too much
gratifie their own spirits in taking revenge; but it must be brought about
by those means, in which the glory of divine vengeance and justice shall

score of their men hapned to discover this crew. Capt. <HI>Patrick</HI> and Capt.
<HI>Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> with about an hundred of the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Forces came in upon
them presently after the alarm was given; such Commanders as first hap∣ned
to be there gave special order that the Swamp should be surround∣ed
(being about a mile in Compass) but Lieutenant <HI>Davenport</HI> belonging
to Capt. <HI>Trask</HI> his Company, not hearing the word of Command, with
a douzen more of his Company in an over eager pursuit of the enemy,
rushed immediately into the Swamp, where they were very rudely en∣tertained
by those evening wolves that were newly kenne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed there∣in;
for Lieft. <HI>Davenport</HI> was sorely wounded in the Body, <HI>Iohn Weag∣wood</HI>
of <HI>Ipswich</HI> in the belly, and was laid hold on also by some of the <HI>In∣dians;
Thomas Shirman</HI> of the said <HI>Ipswich</HI> in the neck; some of their
neighbours that ventured in with them were in danger of the Enemies
arrows that flew very thick about them, others were in as much hazzard
of being swallowed by the miery boggs of the Swamp wherein they stuck
so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast, that if Serjeant <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iggs</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bury</HI> had not rescued two or three of
them they had fallen into the hands of the enemy; but s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch was the
strength and courage of those that came to the rescue, that some of the
Indians being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain with their Swords, their friends were quickly reliev∣ed,
and drawn out of the mire and darger.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Indians</HI> of the place, who had for company sake run with their
Guests the <HI>Pequods</HI> into the swamp, did not love their friendship so well
as to be killed with them also for company sake, wherefore they began to
be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ink themselves that they had done no wrong to the English, and
desired a parly which was granted, &amp; presently understood by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ears
of <HI>Thomas Stanton</HI> an exact Interpreter then at hand, upon which the Sa∣chem
of the place with several others their wives and children, that liked

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame forth and had their lives granted them: after some time of fur∣ther

fullenness that they resolved rather to fell their lives for what they could
get there; and to that end began to let fly their arrowes thick against him
as intending to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his bloud some part of the price of their own; but
through the goodness of God toward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be sold on
that account, he being presently fetched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>By this time night drawing on, our Commanders perceiving<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on which
side of the Swampe the enemies were lodged, gave order to cut through
the Swamp with their swords, that they might the better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them

all the time, by which meanes many of them were killed and buried in the
mire, as they found the next day. The Swamp by the forementioned
device being reduced to so narrow a compass, that our souldiers stand∣ing
at twelve foot distance could surround it, the enemy was kept in all
the night: but a little before day break (by reason of the Fogge that u∣seth
to arise about that time observed to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>)
twenty or thirty of the lustiest of the enemy brake through the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
and escaped away into the woods, some by violence and some by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
dropping away, some of whom not withstanding were killed in the pur∣suit;
the rest were left to the mercy of the Conquerers, of which many
were killed in the swamp like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doggs, that would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their

then receive their lives for the asking at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of those into whose
power they were now fallen: Some that are yet living and worthy of
credit doe affirm, that in the morning entring into the Swamp, they saw
several heaps of them fitting close <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; upon whom they discharged
their pieces laden with ten or twelve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bullets at a time; putting the
muzzles of their pieces under the boughs within a few yards of them;
so as besides those that were sound dead (near twenty) it was judged
that many more were killed and su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k into the mire and never were mind∣ed
more by friend or foe: of those who were not so desperate or sullen to
fell their lives for nothing, but yielded in time, the male Children were
sent to the <HI>Bermudas,</HI> of the females some were distributed to the English
towns, some were disposed of among the other Indians to whom they
were deadly enemies as well as to our selves.</P>
<P>This overthrow given to the <HI>Pequods</HI> struck such a terror into all the
<HI>Indians</HI> in those parts (some of whom had been ill-affected to the English
before) that they sought our friendship, and tendred themselves to be un∣der
<PB N="132" REF="000231_0143_0FA9AC6DF80896D8"/>
our protection, which they then obtained, and have never since for¦feited
it any of them till this late rebellion of <HI>Philip</HI> the subject of the dis∣course
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Amongst the rest of the Prisoners special notice was
taken of the Wife of a noted, Indian called <HI>Mononotto,</HI> who with her
Children submitted her self, or by the chance of the warre fell into the
hands of the English: it was known to be by her modia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion that two
English maides, (that were taken away from <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thersfield</HI> upon
<HI>Connecticut</HI> River) were saved from death, in requital of whose pitty and
humanity, the life of her self and her children was not only granted her,
but she was in special recommended to the care of that honour∣able
gentleman Mr. <HI>Iohn Winthrop,</HI> for that time being the worthy
Governour of the <HI>Massachusets;</HI> who taking notice of her modest coun∣tenance
and behaviour, as well as of her only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equest (not to suffer
wrong either as to the honour of her body or fruit of her womb) gave
special charge concerning her according to his noble and Christian
disposition.</P>
<P>After this slaughter at the Swamp the <HI>Pequods</HI> being upon every turn
exposed to revenge of the <HI>Mohegins</HI> on one side, and <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> on
the other, chose rather to submit themselves to the English, by whom
they were, put, some under the <HI>Mohegin,</HI> and some under the <HI>Narrhagan∣sets,</HI>
which at last proved the occasion of the present quarrel as is con∣ceived,
through the ambition of <HI>Miantonimo,</HI> as was at first related.</P>
<P>This was the issue of the <HI>Pequod Warre,</HI> which in the day of it here in
<HI>New England</HI> was then as for midable to the Country in general as the
present Warre with <HI>Philip;</HI> the experience of which because it may ad∣minister
much matter of Comfort and encouragement to the survi∣ving
Generation, as well as of praise and thanksgiving to almighty
God from all those who have thus long quietly enjoyed the benefit and
reaped the fruit of their labour, and courage who engaged therein: the
more pains hath been taken to search out the broken pieces of that Sto∣ry
and thus put them together before the memory thereof was buried
in the ruines of time, and past the recovery and knowledg of the pre∣sent

<HEAD>A Postscript.</HEAD>
<P>COncerning the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> this is further to be added here, that
Mr. <HI>Thomas Stanton,</HI> and his son <HI>Robert,</HI> who have a long time lived
amongst them, and best acquainted with their language and manners of
any in <HI>New-England,</HI> doe affirm that to their knowledge, the <HI>Narrha∣ganset
Sachems</HI> before the late troubles had two thousand fighting men
under them, and nine hundred arms, yet are they at this day so broken
and scattered, that there is none of them left on that side of the Coun∣try,
unless some few▪ not exceeding seventy in number, that have shel∣tered
themselves under the Inhabitants of <HI>Road-Island,</HI> as a Merchant
of that place worthy of credit, lately affirmed to the Writer hereof. It
is considerable by what degrees they have been consumed &amp; destroyed.</P>
<P>The first week in <HI>April</HI> last, <HI>viz. 1676. Canonchet</HI> their chief Sachem,
having with this people been driven out of his own Country, by the
sword of the English the winter before; breathed stil nothing but rage and
cruelty against them, bearing himself upon his great numbers: yet as
appeared in the issue himself and they that escaped with him, were not
so much preserved from the present calamity that befell the rest in their
Fort, as reserved to another and more ignominious death. For all the
whole Body of the Indians to the westward trusting under the shadow of
that aspiring Bramble; he took a kind of care of them upon himself:
wherefore foreseeing so many hundreds could not well subsist without
Planting, he propounded it in his Councell, that all the West Plantations
upon <HI>Connecticut River,</HI> taken from the English, should this last Summer
be planted with Indian-Corn: which was indeed in it self a very pru∣dent
consideration: To that end he resolved to venture himself with but
thirty men, (the rest declining it) to fetch seed-corn from <HI>Seaconk,</HI> the
next town to <HI>Mount-hope;</HI> leaving a Body of men, not fewer then fifteen
hundred to follow him, or meet him about <HI>Seaconk</HI> the week after. This
Adventure brought him into the snare, from whence he could not es∣cape:
For Capt. <HI>George Denison</HI> of <HI>Stonington,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Avery</HI> of
<HI>New London,</HI> having raised forty seven English, the most part Volunteers,
<PB N="7" REF="000231_0154_0FA9AC7631738008"/>
with <HI>eighty Indians,</HI> twenty of which were <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> belonging
to <HI>Ninegret;</HI> commanded by one called <HI>Catapazet.</HI> The rest <HI>Pequods</HI> under
<HI>Casasinnamon,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>Mohegins</HI> under <HI>Oneco,</HI> Son to <HI>Vncas,</HI> being now
abroad upon their <HI>third Expedition,</HI> which they began March, <HI>the
twenty seventh,</HI> 1676. and ended on the <HI>tenth of April</HI> following. They
met with a <HI>stout Indian</HI> of the Enemies, whom they presently slew,
and <HI>two old Squaws,</HI> that confessed <HI>Nanunttenoo, alias Canunchat,</HI> (those
<HI>chief Sachems</HI> usually <HI>changing their names</HI> at every <HI>great dance,</HI> and by
that name of <HI>Nanunttenoo</HI> was he then known,) was not far of; which
welcome New put <HI>new Life</HI> into the wearied Souldiers, that had travel∣led
hard many dayes, and met with no <HI>Booty</HI> till now; especially, when
it was confirmed by Intelligence the same instant, brought in by their
Scouts, that they met with <HI>new Tracks</HI> which brought them in view of
some <HI>Wigwams</HI> not far from <HI>Patucket,</HI> by some called <HI>Blackstones Ri∣ver,</HI>
in one of which the said <HI>Sachem</HI> was at that moment divertizing
himself, with the <HI>recital</HI> of <HI>Captain Pierces slaughter,</HI> surprized by his
men a few dayes before, but the <HI>Alarm</HI> of the English at that time
heard by himself, put by that discourse, <HI>apalled</HI> with the suddenness
thereof, as if he had been informed by <HI>secret Item from Heaven,</HI> that
now his own turn was come: so as having but <HI>seven men</HI> about him, he
sent up <HI>two of them</HI> to the <HI>top of the Hill,</HI> to see what the matter was,
but they affrighted with the near approach of the English, at that time
with great speed mounting over a <HI>fair Champagna</HI> on the other side of
the Hill, ran by, as if they wanted time to tell what they saw; presently
he sent a third, who did the like; then sending two more on the <HI>same Er∣rand,</HI>
one of these last either indued with <HI>more Gourage,</HI> or a better
S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se of his duty, informed him in <HI>great hast</HI> that all the English Army
was upon him; whereupon, having no time to consult, and but little to At∣tempt
an <HI>escape,</HI> and no means to defend himself; he began to <HI>dodge</HI>
with his <HI>pursuers,</HI> running <HI>round the Hill</HI> on the <HI>contrary side;</HI> but as he
was running so hastily by, <HI>Catapazat</HI> with <HI>twenty</HI> of his <HI>Followers,</HI> and
a few of the <HI>English,</HI> lightest of foot, ghessed by the <HI>swiftness</HI> of his mo∣tion,
that he fled as if an Enemy, which made them immediately take the
<HI>Chase</HI> after him, as for their lives; he that was the <HI>swifter pursuer,</HI> put
him so hard to it, that he cast off first his <HI>Blanket,</HI> then his <HI>silver la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d
Coat,</HI> (given him at <HI>Boston</HI> as a pledge of their <HI>friendship,</HI> upon the <HI>re∣newal</HI>
of his <HI>League</HI> in <HI>October</HI> before,) and <HI>Bolt of Peag,</HI> which made

wretch,</HI> that had often opned his mouth to <HI>blaspheme</HI> the Name of the

the <HI>English</HI> alive in their houses, to which he replyed, others were as for∣ward
for the War as himself; and that he desired to hear no more
thereof. And when he was told his <HI>Sentence</HI> was to dye, he said, he
liked it well, that he should dy before his heart was soft, or had spoken
any thing unworthy of himself. He told the English before they put
him to death, that the killing him, would not end the War; but it
was a considerable step thereunto, nor did it live much longer after his
death, at least, not in those parts; For after <HI>Sudbury fight,</HI> when the Sun
of their hopes was at its <HI>highest. April the eighteenth</HI> following, it <HI>wisi∣bly

the English were not able to bear, it forcing <HI>Tears</HI> from their Eyes; yet
did not the <HI>Sufferer</HI> ever <HI>relent,</HI> or shew any sign of <HI>Anguish:</HI> For be∣ing
asked by some of his <HI>Tormentors,</HI> how he liked the War? he might
have replyed, as the <HI>Scotch Gentleman</HI> did after the loss of a <HI>Battle,</HI> that
being asked how he liked <HI>the match sc.</HI> with our <HI>Prince of Wales,</HI> (which
ther was the occasion of the <HI>quarrel)</HI> made Answer, he liked the <HI>match</HI>
well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough, but no whit liked the manner of the <HI>wooing</HI> written by such

he liked it very well, and found it as sweet, as <HI>English men</HI> did their <HI>Su∣gar.</HI>
In this frame he continued, till his <HI>Executioners</HI> had dealt with
the <HI>Toes of his feet,</HI> as they had done with the <HI>Fingers of his hands;</HI> All
the while making him <HI>dance</HI> round the <HI>Circle,</HI> and <HI>sing,</HI> till he had weari∣ed
both himself and them: At last they brake the <HI>bones of his Legs,</HI> after
which he was forced to <HI>sit down,</HI> which 'tis said he silently did, till they
had <HI>knockt out his brains.</HI> Instances of this nature should be <HI>Incentive</HI>
unto us, to <HI>bless the Father of Lights,</HI> who hath called us out from the
<HI>dark places</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> full of the <HI>Habitations of Cruelty.</HI> When
the <HI>Day-spring</HI> from on high shall visit those that sit in this <HI>Region of
darkness,</HI> another Spirit will be poured upon them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen the feet of

these <HI>Mountains of Prey</HI> shall become the <HI>holy Mountain of the Lord,</HI>
they shall either <HI>hurt,</HI> nor <HI>destroy,</HI> nor exercise <HI>Cruelty</HI> therein.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> 1677. Certain Intelligence

<HEAD>A

OF THE
TROUBLES
With the Indians in
NEW-ENGLAND,
From Pascataqua to Pemmaquid.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Occasion, Rise and Progress of the Warr with the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
in the <HI>Southern</HI> and <HI>Western parts of New-England,</HI> to∣gether
with the <HI>Issue, and Success</HI> thereof, hath in the for∣mer
part of this <HI>Narrative,</HI> been already declared. Be∣fore
an Entrance be made into a Relation of those Troubles that befell
the <HI>Eastern and Northern parts</HI> of the said Country from the <HI>Indians</HI> in∣habiting
those parts; it will be requisite to give some general De∣scription
of the place, as being less frequented, and so more unknown
then the other, like <HI>Heraulds</HI> that use to <HI>Blazon the Field</HI> before they
meddle with the <HI>Charge,</HI> as an <HI>Historian</HI> once said, That so the Reader
may not miss the Truth in <HI>Story,</HI> by being unacquainted with the places
whereon the discourse proceedeth; Briefly therefore, that more <HI>cost
and pains</HI> be not spent in the <HI>surveying a barren, and Rocky Country,</HI>
then will <HI>quit cost;</HI> The <HI>List</HI> or <HI>Border</HI> here being known to be more
worth then the <HI>whole Cloth;</HI> That whole <HI>Tract of Land,</HI> being of little
worth, unless it were for the <HI>Borders thereof</HI> upon the <HI>Sea-Coast,</HI> and
some <HI>Spots and Skirts</HI> of more desireable Land upon the <HI>Banks of some
Rivers</HI> how much soever it be valued by them that know nothing
thereof, but by the uncertain and fallible Reports of such as have only
<PB N="2" REF="000231_0161_0FA9AC80C50FDA48"/>
Sayled by the Country, or viewed some of the Rivers and Havens, but
never passed through the heart of the <HI>Continent.</HI> The whole being
scarce worth half those mens lives, that have been lost these two last
years, in hope to save it.</P>
<P>This <HI>North part</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> did first like <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rah</HI> put forth its
hand, thereby inviting the <HI>Adventurers</HI> to twist the <HI>Scariet Thred</HI> of
their hopes about the same, by that <HI>Auspicious beginning</HI> they were rea∣dy
to promise themselves great prosperity in having that Advantage
before others, to plant and people that part of the Country.</P>
<P>But that fair opportunity was almost quite lost, by some <HI>Fatal,</HI> and
<HI>mischievous Accidents,</HI> happening soon after that <HI>noble Enterprize</HI>
was first set a foot, as hath been already in part, and may hereafter
more fully be declared.</P>
<P>The first place that ever was possessed by the <HI>English,</HI> in hope of
making a <HI>Plantation</HI> in those parts was a <HI>Tract of Land,</HI> on the <HI>West∣side</HI>
of the River of <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> then called <HI>Sag at a wocke,</HI> since <HI>Saga-de-hocke:</HI>
other places adjoyning were soon after seized, and improved
for Trading and fishing. The more remote, &amp; furthest <HI>Northward</HI> at this
time belonging to the <HI>English (Penobsot</HI> forty years since being surpri∣zed
by the <HI>French,</HI> and by them held to this day) is called <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI>
distant <HI>seven</HI> or <HI>eight Leagnes</HI> from <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> and is the <HI>utmost Boun∣dary</HI>
of <HI>New-England,</HI> being about <HI>forty Leagues</HI> distant from the
mouth of <HI>Pascataqua River.</HI> That <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> is a very <HI>Commodious
Haven</HI> for Ships, and hath been found very Advantagious to such as
use to come upon these <HI>Coasts</HI> to make <HI>fishing Voyages; South West,</HI> or
<HI>South East,</HI> from whence about <HI>six</HI> or <HI>seven Leagues</HI> lies an <HI>Island</HI> cal∣led
<HI>Monhiggon,</HI> of much use on the same account for fishing, it lying
<HI>three</HI> or <HI>four Leagues</HI> into the Sea from <HI>Damarils Cove,</HI> (a place of
like Advantage for the <HI>Stages</HI> of <HI>Fishermen</HI> in former times) There
have been for a long time seven or eight considerable dwellings
about <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> which is well accommodased with Pasture Land
about the <HI>Haven</HI> for <HI>feeding Cattle,</HI> and some Fields also for <HI>Tillage;</HI>
All the Land improvable for <HI>such uses</HI> being already taken up, by such
a number of Inhabitants as is already mentioned.</P>
<P>In the mouth of the River of <HI>Kennibeck</HI> lies a considerable <HI>Island</HI> cal∣ced
<HI>Aronick,</HI> some years since purchased by <HI>Major Clarke</HI> and <HI>Capt.
Lake</HI> two Merchancs of <HI>Boston;</HI> on which they built several large dwel∣lings
with a <HI>Ware-house,</HI> and many other <HI>Edifices</HI> near the water side,
It being intended by the Owners for a place of Trading, as well as
<PB N="3" REF="000231_0162_0FA9AC817A02DC50"/>
Planti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g; there being many of late seated there, fit to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rry on each
designe, where also was <HI>built a fort,</HI> which if it had been <HI>carefuliy defend∣ed,</HI>
might have proved the defence, and Security of all that side of the
Country, as it used to be their <HI>Magazine,</HI> up higher beyond the River of
<HI>Kennibeck,</HI> four Leagues <HI>Eastward</HI> toward <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> in another con∣siderable
<HI>River</HI> called <HI>Ships-Coat,</HI> upon the Banks of which were many
scattered Planters, who lately flying from their dwellings for fear of
the <HI>Indians,</HI> left as was judged, a <HI>thousand</HI> head of <HI>neat Cattle</HI> for the
use of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that made the late Insurrection against the Inhabi∣tants
of those parts, besides their <HI>Fields</HI> and <HI>Barns</HI> full of <HI>Corn</HI></P>
<P>There is another <HI>River</HI> that issues into <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> a little higher up
into the Country called <HI>Pegypscot,</HI> that comes down from behind <HI>Cas∣co
Bay.</HI> This <HI>Pegypicot</HI> is the seat of the <HI>Amoscogging</HI> Indians, who
have had a great, if not the principal hand in the late mischiefs.</P>
<P>Some few Leagues to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Kennibeck</HI> lies that famous and
spacious <HI>Haven</HI> called <HI>Casco Bay,</HI> the <HI>North East Cape</HI> of which is
made by an <HI>Island</HI> called <HI>Saguin;</HI> The <HI>Southern</HI> or <HI>opposite point of Land</HI>
is called <HI>Cape Elizabeth,</HI> which is in the Bosome of this <HI>Bay,</HI> be∣ing
about eight or nine <HI>Leagues</HI> over at the mouth of it, and aboundance
of small <HI>Islands,</HI> many of them being inhabited by <HI>Fishermen,</HI> and others;
one of the principal of that sort, is called <HI>Iewels Island.</HI> There are
many places about the <HI>Bay</HI> fit to make <HI>commodious habitations;</HI> and
on the <HI>South side</HI> of it is a small <HI>Village</HI> called <HI>Falmouth;</HI> All, or most
of it, <HI>lately destroyed by the Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Casco</HI> to the <HI>Southward,</HI> or <HI>South-west,</HI> still is a <HI>River</HI>
called <HI>Spurnuik,</HI> over against which lies <HI>Richmond Island,</HI> not far from
the main Land, being divided therefrom by a <HI>small Channel</HI> soordable
at <HI>Low water,</HI> It hath for a long time been the Seat of <HI>Mr. Iordan,</HI>
in right of <HI>Mr. Winter,</HI> the former, if not the first promoter thereof
whose daughter he married.</P>
<P>The next Plantation <HI>Southward</HI> is called <HI>Scarborough,</HI> a small <HI>Village</HI>
seated upon <HI>black point,</HI> over against which is another point, for distin∣ction
from the former called <HI>blue point:</HI> This <HI>black point</HI> was lately the
Seat of <HI>M. Iosselin,</HI> being a parcel of the <HI>Province of maine,</HI> or falling
within the <HI>Prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncts</HI> thereof, and was formerly by <HI>Patent</HI> granted to
the said <HI>Iosselin</HI> or his <HI>Predecessors,</HI> since purchased by <HI>Mr. Scotto</HI> of
<HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saco River</HI> lies next in order to <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> a <HI>Navigable River;</HI>
where <HI>Major Philips</HI> had a commodious Scituation ately; at the
mouth of which River lies <HI>winter Harbour,</HI> encompassed on one side
<PB N="4" REF="000231_0163_0FA9AC8232C471D8"/>
by a Neck of Land, formerly the Propriety of one <HI>Mr. Winter</HI> whose
Name it still retains, but lately purchased by <HI>Major Pendleton,</HI> where
he enjoyed a very comfortable Seat and habitation.</P>
<P>There is another <HI>Harbour</HI> lying a little <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>Saco</HI> made by that
which is called <HI>Cape Porpuise;</HI> a convenient Sear for <HI>Fishermen,</HI> as are most
of the other places above named. Between <HI>Cape Porpuise</HI> &amp; <HI>Pascata∣qua</HI>
there are but two small Towns more, (though ambitious of great
Names the one called <HI>Wells,</HI> the other <HI>Yorke, Wells</HI> is seated upon a small
<HI>River</HI> or <HI>Creek</HI> affording a small <HI>Harbour</HI> fit only for <HI>Barkes &amp; smaller V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣sels;</HI>
on each side of which Town lies a small River, the first called <HI>Kenni∣hank,</HI>
the second <HI>Maguncuck</HI> the other Town is called <HI>York,</HI> for∣merly
known by the Name of <HI>Agamenticus,</HI> from an high <HI>Hill</HI> of that
Name not far off therefrom. The point of Land which lies between the
said Fowns, is called <HI>Cape Nidduck,</HI> making a <HI>small Harbour</HI> likewise,
into which issues another <HI>pretty River,</HI> on the <HI>Banks</HI> of which is Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuate
the Town of <HI>Yorke.</HI> All or most of the forementioned <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Plan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations</HI>
are seated upon and <HI>neer,</HI> some River greater or lesser, whose
streams are principally improved for driving of <HI>Saw-Mill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> Those
late Inventions, so useful for destruction of <HI>Wood</HI> and <HI>Timber,</HI> specially
of <HI>Firre Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> which do so abound in those <HI>Coasts;</HI> that there is scarce
a <HI>River or Creeke</HI> in those parts that hath not some of those <HI>Engine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ected upon them.</P>
<P>The upper Branches of the samous River of <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> being al∣so
imployed all of them that way, namely, <HI>Sturgeon Creeke, Salmon
F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls, Newechewannick, Quechecho, Oyster River, Swamscot, Green∣land,

<HI>Dover,</HI> seated upon, or near some of the main Branches thereof, whose
principal Trade is in <HI>Deale Boards,</HI> cut by those <HI>Saw-Mills,</HI> since their
<HI>Rif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Timber</HI> is <HI>near all consumed.</HI> On each side of that brave <HI>Navi∣gable
River</HI> of <HI>Pascataqua</HI> down <HI>towards the mouth of it,</HI> are seated on
the <HI>North side</HI> the Town of <HI>Kittary</HI> (a long scattering Plantation made
up of <HI>several Hamlets</HI>) on the South side the Town of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> to
which belongs the <HI>great Island,</HI> lying in the mouth of the said <HI>River,</HI>
a place of considerable Trade, these late years, the which together
with <HI>Strawberry Bank</HI> the upper part of the said Town of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI>
are the <HI>Magazine,</HI> and chief, or only place of <HI>Commerce</HI> &amp; <HI>Trade</HI> for
al the Pantations, betwixt it, and <HI>Casco Bay;</HI> All the said Plantations
have in these last two years, <HI>viz.</HI> 1675. 1676. felt more or less of the
<HI>Rage and Cruelty</HI> of the <HI>Barbarous</HI> and <HI>perfidious Indians</HI> belonging to
that side of the Country, As shall more particularly be declared in what
<PB N="5" REF="000231_0164_0FA9AC82F9A3A550"/>
follows, after a short discourse of the first planting that side of the
Country which may serve as a kind of <HI>Prologue</HI> to the following <HI>Tra∣gedy.</HI></P>
<P>This part of <HI>New-England</HI> began first to be planted about the same
time with <HI>Virginia, viz.</HI> in the year 1606. There the first <HI>Letters Pa∣tents</HI>
granted by the King for the Limitation of <HI>Virginia,</HI> did extend
from 34 to 44 Degrees of <HI>North Latitude,</HI> and was divided into two
parts, namely the first, and the second <HI>Colony;</HI> The former was appro∣priated
to the City of <HI>London,</HI> The other, to the Cities of <HI>Bristol, Ex∣eter,</HI>
and Town of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> each of which had <HI>Laws, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iviledges,</HI> and
<HI>Authority</HI> for the Government, and advancing their several Plantati∣ons
alike, As saith, <HI>Capt. Smith</HI> in his general History of <HI>Virginia,</HI>
and <HI>New-England.</HI> This second <HI>Colony</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> promising
but little Advantage to the <HI>Vndertakers,</HI> by reason of its <HI>Mountainous</HI>
and <HI>Rocky Scituation,</HI> found but few <HI>Adventurers</HI> forward to pro∣mote
the planting thereof, after the death of Sir <HI>Iohn Popham,</HI> who
was the first that ever procured men, or meant to possess it; for when
the main Pillars are removed, what can be expected but that the whole
building should fall to the ground. Yet, notwithstanding the discou∣ragements
the first <HI>Planters</HI> met withal in their first <HI>Winter seasoning,</HI> in
that <HI>cold</HI> and <HI>rocky desert</HI> (which made them all return home in the
year 1608) did Sir <HI>Francis Popham</HI> his Son, having the Ships and Pro∣vision
which remained of the Company, and supplying what was ne∣cessary
for his purpose, send divers times to the <HI>Coasts</HI> for <HI>Trade</HI> and
<HI>Fishing,</HI> of whose loss or gain, as saith my <HI>Author,</HI> himself was best
able to give account. And some of the Ships sent by him, and the <HI>Earl</HI>
of <HI>Southhampton,</HI> with other <HI>Noble Adventurers,</HI> did bring home some
of the Natives of the place in one of the next following years, by whose
Informations, some of the first <HI>Vndertakers</HI> were encouraged once
more to try the verity of their hopes, and see if possibly they might
finde something that could enduce a fresh <HI>Resolution</HI> to prosecute so <HI>pi∣ous</HI>
and <HI>Honourable</HI> a work.</P>
<P>But in the mean time before there was yet any Speech, or endeavour
to settle any other Plantation in those parts, That about <HI>Saga de hock</HI>
being thus abandoned for the present by the first <HI>Vndertakers,</HI> The
<HI>Frenchmen</HI> immediately took the opportunity to settle themselves with∣in
our <HI>Limits,</HI> which being understood by those of <HI>Virginia,</HI> they dis∣crectly
taking into their consideration the inconveniences that might
arise by suffering them to harbour there, Sir <HI>Samuel Argal</HI> was sent
with Commission to displace them, which he with <HI>great discretion, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erity</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="000231_0165_0FA9AC841957F5F8"/>
and <HI>Iudgement</HI> performed about the year 1613. The which
made way for the Plantation at <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> granted afterward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by
<HI>King Iames</HI> to <HI>Sir William Alexander</HI> one of his <HI>Majesties most Ho∣nourable
Council of</HI> Scotland. The said <HI>Argal</HI> seized the <HI>Forts</HI> which
the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> had built at <HI>Mount Mansel,</HI> St. <HI>Croix,</HI> and <HI>Port Ru∣al,</HI>
and carried away their <HI>Ordnance,</HI> with other <HI>Provisions</HI> to the <HI>Colo∣ny</HI>
of <HI>Virginia,</HI> to their great Benefit. The said places were held by the
<HI>English</HI> divers years after, till about the <HI>year</HI> 1635. by Commission
from the <HI>Scotch Lord</HI> a foresaid, but how his right came afterwards to
be <HI>alienated</HI> to any of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, doth not concern us with Re∣ference
to the business in hand, further to enquire.</P>
<P>Things remaining in this posture for the space of near <HI>seven years,</HI>
some of the first Adventurers apprehensive of better hopes of good that
might ensne by a fresh Attempt, Resolved to set the designe a foot a
<HI>second time,</HI> to which End several Ships were sent on that account in
the <HI>year</HI> 1615. but with as bad Success as the former; for in the year
before, <HI>viz. 1614. Capt. Smith</HI> desirous to promote the <HI>Colony</HI> of
<HI>New-England,</HI> as well as that of <HI>Verginia</HI> came thither with <HI>two Ves∣sels,</HI>
and returned back to <HI>England</HI> in the lesser of them, with intent to
be there again that next year, to promote the said Plantation; But after
he was gone, one <HI>Thomas Hunt</HI> master of the Shi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, he left behind, like a
<HI>wicked Varlot,</HI> to prevent the carrying on the Plantation, that he &amp; a few
<HI>Merchants</HI> might wholly enjoy the benefit of the <HI>Trade</HI> of the <HI>Country,</HI>
after he had made his <HI>Voyage,</HI> seized upon <HI>four &amp; twenty</HI> of the <HI>poor Inno∣cent
Natives,</HI> that in confidence of his honesty, had put themselves into
his hands, then <HI>clapping them under Hatches,</HI> carryed them away to <HI>Ma∣lego,</HI>
whither he was <HI>bound</HI> with the fish he had made upon the <HI>Coast,</HI> for
that <HI>Market:</HI> But this <HI>vile act,</HI> although it kept him for ever after
from any more imployment in those parts, yet that was the least part
of the mischief that attended his <HI>wicked practice;</HI> for upon the <HI>Arri∣val</HI>
of the <HI>Adventurers</HI> Ships the <HI>next yeare;</HI> Two Natives of the place
that had been some years in <HI>England,</HI> and coming back unto the said
Ships, as soon as they understood the iniuty so <HI>Treacherously done</HI> to
their <HI>Country-men,</HI> they contracted such an hatred against our whole
Nation, that although one of the said Natives dyed soon after, yet the
other called <HI>Epenow,</HI> studied how to be Revenged, which he so far found
means to Effect, that he <HI>frustrated this second Attempt</HI> of setling a
Plantation in these parts.</P>
<P>Yet did not the Adventurers cast off all hope of carrying on their de∣signe,
wherein Providence within a few years after so <HI>favoured them,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="000231_0166_0FA9AC85E2B358B8"/>
that one or more of the Salvages called <HI>Tisquamtum and Samoset,</HI> car∣ryed
away by <HI>Hunt,</HI> was brought back to <HI>New-found Land,</HI> from
whence he was soon after conveyed by the prudent endeavour of <HI>Capt.
Mason</HI> (then Governour of the Plantation begun upon <HI>New-found
Land</HI>) into the hands of some of the <HI>Adventurers</HI> by whose means
they hoped to <HI>work a peace</HI> betwixt the said Natives on that <HI>Coast</HI>
where the <HI>fire had been kindled before;</HI> for the <HI>Adventurers</HI> imployed
<HI>Capt. Thomas Darmer,</HI> a <HI>prudent</HI> and <HI>industrious Gentleman</HI> to settle
the affairs of the Plantatjon, now a third time revived again about <HI>Ken∣nibeck,</HI>
in the <HI>year</HI> 1619, or thereabouts. By his prudence and care
a lasting peace was made betwixt the Natives of the place, and the
English, who were but a little before so abhorred by them, for the
wrong formerly received, so as the Plantation began at last to <HI>prosper,</HI>
and <HI>continue in good liking,</HI> and <HI>Assurance</HI> of the <HI>Friendship</HI> of their
Neighbours, that had been lately so exasperated against them. This
<HI>Tisquanium</HI> forementioned, was not a little Instrumental, and helpful
to the Plantation begun at <HI>New-Plimouth</HI> about the following <HI>year, viz.</HI>
1620. in their weak beginnings, there being frequent mention of
his Name, as also of one <HI>Samoset,</HI> a Native of the same place, by the
like Providence brought back to <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> and from thence with <HI>Tis∣quantum</HI>
came to the New-planters at <HI>Patuxet,</HI> or <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and brought
them into acquaintance with <HI>Massasoit,</HI> the great <HI>Sachem</HI> about those
parts; without whose Friendship that new Plantation would hardly
have subsisted long.</P>
<P>This Story premised is the more to be minded in this place, because
the Friendship upon the means and occasious aforesaid, confirmed be∣twixt
the <HI>Indians</HI> in these <HI>Eastern parts,</HI> &amp; the <HI>English,</HI> had continued
<HI>stedfast and Constant to this year,</HI> when it was broken by <HI>another Trea∣cherous</HI>
and <HI>wicked practice,</HI> of a like nature, and parrallel to that of the
foresaid <HI>Hunt.</HI> As may more fully be declared afterwards.</P>
<P>Possibly the like saci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction may prove the more probable means to
procure a setled peace. But to return, whence this Digression hath
been made. Some years were spent to bring things to this Issue:
The <HI>Adventurers</HI> were put to much care and pains before they could
get their Patent <HI>confirmed,</HI> and <HI>Renewed again;</HI> many <HI>Obstructions</HI>
they met withal from some <HI>Interlopers</HI> that begen to look into the
<HI>Trade</HI> of this <HI>Country,</HI> and would <HI>irregularly</HI> have had a <HI>share-therein,</HI> or
made it <HI>common</HI> to all <HI>Traders,</HI> to which End they <HI>pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ioned</HI> to a <HI>Par∣liament</HI>
then called, to bring about their Ends, but at the last it was set∣led
firmly in the hands of sundry Noble and worthy Patentees, <HI>Lords,
<PB N="8" REF="000231_0167_0FA9AC85F8AEAA78"/>
Knights, Gentlemen,</HI> and <HI>Merchants,</HI> commonly known by the Name
of the <HI>Councel of</HI> Plimouth, who had the <HI>absolute power</HI> under the <HI>King,</HI>
for making all <HI>Grants,</HI> and <HI>disposing of all Lands</HI> from the <HI>40th.</HI> to the
<HI>48th. Degrees of North Latitude;</HI> All which was accomplished about
the <HI>year</HI> 1621. Some printed Relations that speak of these <HI>Transacti∣ons,</HI>
write much of the flourishing state, and hopeful prosperity of this
Plantation, published about <HI>forty or fifty years since,</HI> yet did it never
appear by what followed, that any <HI>considerable Advantage</HI> did ever ac∣crue
to the <HI>first Vndertakers</HI> from this their New-Plantation of the
<HI>Eastern parts,</HI> unless by the Trade of <HI>Fish,</HI> and <HI>Furrs,</HI> which latter
continued not long; As for the <HI>former,</HI> The chief benefit redounded on∣ly
to them that <HI>managed</HI> it by their own <HI>particular Stocks,</HI> and <HI>personal
Endeavours:</HI> And if without offence it may be spoken, the multitude
of Patents soon after granted to several <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of <HI>Brok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Fortunes,</HI>
have provided but places of an <HI>Honourable Exile</HI> or <HI>Confinement,</HI> whi∣ther
many deserving persons of better Education then Fortune, were
sent to shift for themselves in a <HI>Forreign Land,</HI> without being further
Troublesome to those nearer home, on whom they had their <HI>hopes and
Dependance;</HI> yet it must not be denyed but that some of the <HI>Vnderta∣kers</HI>
were at vast Expences, casting their <HI>Bread upon these waters,</HI> where
none of their <HI>Friends and Relations</HI> have as yet had opportunity to find
it. The Reason of which is not hard to give, in Reference to all those
Lands and Territories that lye to the Eastward of <HI>Pascataqua River.</HI>
One man Cause hath been the multiplicity of Grants and Patents for
the dividing of the said <HI>Tract of Land,</HI> for beside the strise that hath
been occasioned by the Intricacy and indistinctness of their Liberties and
Bounds, (enough to have maintained a greater number of Lawyers, then
ever were the Inhabitants) If the Grantees had been supplyed with mo∣nyes
proportionable to their writes and Controversies about their
bounds and Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isdictions, which sometimes they have been ready to
decide with their Swords, witness those fatal Names imposed on such
Accounts upon some p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aces belonging to those parts, as <HI>Bloody point,
Black and Blew point,</HI> and every considerable <HI>Parcel of Land</HI> being by
<HI>Patent</HI> granted to several particular persons, hindred the <HI>erecting of
Town-ships</HI> and <HI>Villages,</HI> which if it had been otherwise disposed of,
might have been full of <HI>Towns,</HI> and <HI>well peopled,</HI> and thereby the Inha∣bitants
had been able to have <HI>stood upon their Guard,</HI> and <HI>defended them∣selves</HI>
against the <HI>common Enemy,</HI> whereas now they were but like <HI>sco∣pae
dissolutae,</HI> or like his <HI>Arrows</HI> that being bound up in one bundle could
not be broken by an ordinary Force, but being loose, were easily <HI>snapt
<PB N="9" REF="000231_0168_0FA9AC86B8FE2DF0"/>
asunder,</HI> by any single hand. Another Reason might be, the imploying of
such <HI>Agenis</HI> &amp; <HI>Instruments</HI> as either wanted <HI>Skill or Fidelity</HI> to manage
what they were <HI>betrusted with,</HI> which made many of the <HI>Adventurers</HI> long
ago complain, that (in stead of <HI>Bills of Exchange</HI> &amp; other Returns which
they expected) they received nothng but large <HI>Inventoryes</HI> of the wants
of their several Plantations, and the Servants sent over to improve
them, which were all the Returns that many of them ever received for
the large <HI>Summs of mony</HI> many disbursed for the carrying on their affairs</P>
<P>A third Reason may be the several Changes of Government the Inhabi∣tants
have passed under, which have occasioned not only much <HI>vexation,</HI>
&amp; <HI>Expences</HI> to such as were upon the place; but much discouragement to
several others, who by the <HI>commodiousness of the Soyle,</HI> would willingly
have chosen Station in those parts, had they seen any hope of <HI>a setled Go∣vernment,</HI>
ever like to have been obtained; which is not hard to <HI>demon∣strate,</HI>
by giving a little touch as we pass along, on the several <HI>changes of
Government,</HI> the places forementioned have been <HI>moulded into,</HI> &amp; the se∣veral
<HI>Proprietours</HI> of, have claimed Interest in the Land. In the <HI>year</HI> 1624. A
Patent was granted by the <HI>Councel of Pli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outh,</HI> the grand <HI>Proprietours,</HI> to
<HI>Captain Mason</HI> for a large Tract of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and about <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> but it not be∣ing
distinctly bounded, himself, with <HI>Sir Ferdinando Gorges</HI> obtayned a
joynt <HI>Patent</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> 1629. for the Land betwixt <HI>Saga de-Hock</HI> East, &amp;
<HI>Naum Keag</HI> West, but that also interferring with the Bounds ganted be∣fore
that time to sundry <HI>Gentlemen</HI> &amp; <HI>Merchants</HI> that had obtamed a
<HI>Patent</HI> from the <HI>South of Charles River</HI> to the <HI>Northward of Merrimack;
Capt. Masons</HI> bounds were afterwards by Consent, (as is said) of his Agent
or Agents, reduced to some Branches about <HI>Pascataqua River</HI> (who yet
could not agree with those that acted in the Name of <HI>Shrewsbury men</HI>) but
being wholly neglected by the <HI>pretended Proprietour</HI> or his <HI>Successours,</HI>
(till of late dayes) was by the desire of the Inhabitants yielded up to the
<HI>Massachusets Government,</HI> near <HI>twenty years</HI> since.</P>
<P>In the <HI>year</HI> 1630. A Patent was granted by the said <HI>Councel of Pli∣mouth</HI>
(signed by the <HI>Earl of Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Sir Ferdinand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gorge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i,</HI>
and sealed with the <HI>common Seal</HI> of the <HI>Councel</HI> aforesaid) to <HI>Iohn
Dy, Thomas Impe, Grace Harding,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Roach</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> for a
large Tract of Land on the South of <HI>Saga-de Hock</HI> forty mile square by
the Sea side, and so up into the Country: <HI>Iohn Dy</HI> afore said, and his
<HI>Partners</HI> took in another as Partner, and Associate with them, <HI>Mr.
Richard Dummer</HI> of <HI>Newbury</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> in the <HI>year</HI> 1638. to
whom they delivered the <HI>Oreginal Patent,</HI> with an order from them
and in their Name, to take up the Land deseribed in the <HI>Patent,</HI> but,
<PB N="10" REF="000231_0169_0FA9AC87905DAE98"/>
he being denyed opportunity to Effect it, as also a Ship formerly sent by
the <HI>Patentees</HI> for that End, not accomplishing their desire, they not
long after sold all their Interest in the said Patent, to one <HI>Mr. Rigby</HI> a
<HI>Lancashire</HI> Gentleman, who made <HI>Mr. Cleaves</HI> his <HI>Agent</HI> to manage
the business of his purchased Interest in the said Patent; To whom
Mr. <HI>Dummer</HI> was ordered to deliver the <HI>Original Patent,</HI> which ac∣cordingly
he did: what trouble was occasioned soon after between
the said <HI>Mr. Cleaves</HI> and Mr. <HI>Vines</HI> Agent for <HI>Sir Ferdinando Gor∣ges,</HI>
is well known to the Inhabitants of the place, and need not be here
mentioned; nor yet how the said <HI>Mr. Rigby</HI> came afterward to loose
his Interest (at least with the Inhabitants) in the Patent.</P>
<P>In the <HI>year 1632. Sir Ferdinando Gorges</HI> not resting in the joynt
Patent obtained for himself, and <HI>Capt. Mason,</HI> obtained a distinct Pa∣tent
for himself, and got it confirmed by <HI>King Charles</HI> the first of <HI>blessed</HI>
and <HI>famous memory,</HI> for all that large <HI>Tract of Land</HI> from <HI>Saga-de-hock</HI>
to <HI>Pascataqua River,</HI> and so about an <HI>bundred miles</HI> up into the Coun∣try,
by the Name of the Province of <HI>Maine.</HI> What benefit and Im∣provement
was ever made thereof by his <HI>Agents, or Successours,</HI> is best
known to themselves; But for the Inhabitants, who upon one ac∣count
or another had been induced, either by any <HI>prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous grant</HI> or
liberty from himself, or his <HI>Agents,</HI> to take up any Land within the
Bounds of the said Province; They finding much inconvenience and
trouble for want of an orderly and setled Government, did at the last
petition the <HI>general Court of the Massachusets</HI> to be taken under their
Jurisdiction and Government (reserving the Liberties and Priviledges
of their former purchases and Grants, as to <HI>Title, poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion</HI> and <HI>propriety</HI>
to themselves) which was granted them, though not only, and altoge∣ther
upon the grounds on which it was desired by the Petitioners. Yet
notwithstanding all this, were not things setled either to the comfort or
content of the Inhabitants: for sometimes some demanded Right of
Jurisdiction over them by virtue of <HI>Sir F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdinando's Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent,</HI> sometimes
<HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssioners</HI> imployed by his <HI>Highne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Duke of York,</HI> attempted
to settle a Government amongst the people, sometimes they tryed what
might be done by Agreement amongst themselves, but after their Re∣turne
for <HI>England,</HI> by one means or other, the Government relapsed
again into the hands of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> although a <HI>Supersedeas</HI> there∣unto
seems to have been put by an order from his <HI>Majesty</HI> this last year.</P>
<P>By these several <HI>Vic ssitudes</HI> and changes of Government, the flou∣rishing
of the said Province hath been much <HI>obstructed,</HI> which else might
have been much <HI>advanced,</HI> and the Inhabitants been put into a Capacity
<PB N="11" REF="000231_0170_0FA9AC88320C7448"/>
to have secured themselves against the late <HI>Barbarous Incursions</HI> of the
<HI>Indians;</HI> and possibly those <HI>Exorbitanci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> that many of the present
Proprietours have run into, to the <HI>just provocation</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> might
thereby have been prevented, and so the mischief also which hath ensu∣ed,
might thereby have been <HI>averted:</HI> For a well ordered Govern∣ment
would never have suffered those things that n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w were connived
at, which if they had been timely lookt into bysuch as had <HI>absolute</HI> or <HI>po∣sitive</HI>
and <HI>unquestioned power of Rule</HI> in their hands, would have been
otherwise ordered, the present mischief that is come upon those places,
might thereby have been, if not prevented, yet more easily redressed,
then now is like to be.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Tract of Land</HI> that lies <HI>Eastward</HI> beyond <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> be∣twixt
that and <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> it is said to have belonged to one <HI>Mr. Ald∣worth,</HI>
and his <HI>Successours;</HI> who was Alderman of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and one that
had a Patent thereof, and imployed some as his Agents, that did some∣times
reside upon the place; And was lately setled in some order of
Government by his <HI>Highness</HI> the <HI>Duke of Yorks Commissioners,</HI> by
whom also was an Agreement made betwixt the <HI>Sagamores</HI> of the In∣dians
in those parts, and the <HI>English,</HI> at a Court kept by their Ap∣pointment
in <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> which if it had been observed, might in all
probability have prevented in great measure the quarrel which is now
fallen out betwixt the English and the said Indians: For upon some Jea∣lousies
of the Rising of those Indians about twelve or thirteen years
since, it was agreed, that if any mischief should happen to be done by
the English or Indians, one against another, though it were to the kil∣ling
any person, neither side should right themselves, but complaint
should be made to the <HI>Sagamores</HI> if the Indians did the wrong, and to
the <HI>Court,</HI> if it were done by the <HI>English;</HI> Both which did promise satis∣faction
should be made, for the preventing any quarrel: The Names
of the <HI>Sachems,</HI> as likewise of them that were in power at the Court,
do stil remain upon <HI>publick Record.</HI> But matters of Government in
those parts being since <HI>collapsed;</HI> no Authority more then what was
meerly <HI>voluntary</HI> and <HI>perswasive</HI> being owned. Things are now
brought to that miser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble state, which follows next to be declared.</P>
<P>Ever since the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ling of any English Plantation in those parts
about <HI>Kennibeck</HI> for the space of above fifty years the Indians alwayes
carryed it fair, and held good <HI>Correspondence</HI> with the <HI>English,</HI> until
the News came of <HI>Philips Rebellion,</HI> and Rising against the Inhabita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s
of <HI>Pli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th Colony</HI> in the End of <HI>Iune</HI> 1675. After which time, it was
apprehended by such as had the Examination of the Indians about <HI>Ken∣nibeck.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="000231_0171_0FA9AC8BD0426A20"/>
That there was a general surmise amongst them, that they
should be required to assist the said <HI>Philip,</HI> although they would not
owne, that they were at all engaged in the Quarrel. The like Jea∣lousie
did appear in all the Indians that inhabited to the <HI>Eastward of Pas∣cataqua,</HI>
which plainly shews that there was a designe of a general
Rising of the Indians against the English, all over the Country, (possibly
as farr as <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Indians there making Insurrection the same year,)
&amp; that many if not most of them were willing it should succeed, al∣though
the <HI>Elder &amp; wiser</HI> of them liked it not, fearing the Issue, as they
had cause: But many of the young men about <HI>Casco Bay▪</HI> and <HI>Amonos∣coggan</HI>
were certainly known to flock thither the last year, and did, sun∣dry
of them, come short home. Forherein they acted but like Salvages, as
those in <HI>Virginia</HI> did, <HI>fifty year</HI> before, shewing themselves friendly and
Courteous to their new neighbours, till they had an opportunity to do
them mischief. So that notwithstanding many of the Inhabitants in the
<HI>Eastern,</HI> as well as in the <HI>Western parts of the Country,</HI> that were wont to
Trade with the <HI>Indians,</HI> were not willing to believe any such pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pose a∣mongst
them, but were ready to think, some of the <HI>Ruder sort</HI> of the <HI>Eng∣glish,</HI>
by their <HI>imprudent</HI> &amp; <HI>irregular acting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> had driven them into this <HI>Re∣bellion;</HI>
yet is it too to evident, that the said <HI>Indians</HI> (who naturally delight
in <HI>bloody</HI> &amp; <HI>deceitful actions</HI> (did lay hold of any opportunity that might
serve for a pretence to be put upon their <HI>barbarous practices.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI>
about <HI>Wammeset</HI> &amp; <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> that had joyned with their Country men
in their <HI>rising</HI> against the <HI>English</HI> the last winter, when they were pinched
with <HI>hunger</HI> in the <HI>cold Winter</HI> following returned back to the English, &amp;
desired to <HI>make peace,</HI> &amp; <HI>firmly engaged</HI> to continue their <HI>wonted Friend∣ship;</HI>

<HI>Cruelty,</HI> of their own voluntary motion came with the Prisoners they had
taken, &amp; resigned them up to the <HI>English;</HI> yet when their own Ends were
Answered, &amp; another opportunity was offered of doing <HI>further mischief of
like nature:</HI> they presently returned to their former practice, as is well
known of <HI>Simond</HI> &amp; <HI>Andrew,</HI> that had killed some, &amp; led others Captive
in the <HI>last spring</HI> from <HI>Bradford</HI> &amp; <HI>Haverhill,</HI> who came in the End of <HI>Iune</HI>

from any of the other sort, further then either <HI>fear of their power,</HI> or
<HI>hope of benefit</HI> by <HI>their favour,</HI> may <HI>induce</HI> them to <HI>another disposition,</HI> as
we the Inhabitants of <HI>New-England</HI> have found by this late, &amp; sad Expe∣rience
in Reference to these <HI>Pagans</HI> in the <HI>West</HI> amongst whom our Lot is
cast, they proving, as one says of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hometans</HI> in the <HI>East,</HI> like a <HI>nest of
Hornets,</HI> that if any one of them chance to be provoked, they will be <HI>all
about his Ears</HI> that comes near them. But it is now time to begin with the
particulars of the <HI>Tragedy</HI> it self, that the Reader account not the <HI>Prologue</HI>
too long. It was on the <HI>24th.</HI> of <HI>Iune</HI> 1675. when the first mischief was
done by the <HI>Indians</HI> about <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> before <HI>twenty dayes</HI> were over,
the fire began to kindle in these the <HI>most remote</HI> &amp; most <HI>Northerly bounds</HI>
of the said Country, or <HI>two hundred &amp; fifty</HI> miles distance, &amp; upon this oc∣casion;
<HI>Iuly the</HI> 11th. 1675. A Letter was brought to <HI>Kennibeck</HI> from one
<HI>Henry Sawyer</HI> an Inhabitant of <HI>Yorke,</HI> signifying the <HI>news of the Indians ri∣sing</HI>
about <HI>Plimouth,</HI> &amp; that a course was taken to <HI>disarm the indians</HI> along
the shore. This rumour did so far <HI>awaken the Inhabitants</HI> of those parts
that the very next day at a <HI>general meeting</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> at one <HI>Capt.
Pattishals bouse,</HI> several offered themselves as <HI>Voluntiers,</HI> to go up the said
River of <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> to make discovery of the <HI>Indians Fidelity,</HI> or else to
fight them, if occasion were. The third day after, marching up the River
to <HI>Quegeseck,</HI> they met with the Inhabitants of <HI>Ships Cot River,</HI> which is a
River lying about twelve or fourteen miles to the <HI>North East of Kenni∣beck.</HI>
Divers of the Indians thereabouts, by the peaswasions of one <HI>Mr.
Walker,</HI> that used to trade with them, brought down an <HI>incon siderable par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of their Amunition,</HI> as a few <HI>Guns,</HI> a little <HI>Powder</HI> &amp; <HI>Shot,</HI> with a few <HI>knives:</HI>
About seven of the <HI>Kennibeck Indians,</HI> &amp; five of those called <HI>Ammoscog∣ging
Indians,</HI> about <HI>Pegypscot,</HI> (a river more <HI>Southward</HI> toward <HI>Casco</HI>) made
this shew of bringing in their Arms <HI>Capt. Lake, Capt. Pattishal,</HI> with <HI>Mr.
Wiswal,</HI> in whose hands was setled a kind of <HI>military power</HI> for those <HI>parts,</HI>
were sent for to examine the said <HI>Indians</HI> further, of whom upon Exami∣nation
they saw Reason to <HI>suspect some,</HI> if not all, whereupon they sent
Messengers the second time to the <HI>Ammoscogging Indians;</HI> &amp; also a Letter
to <HI>Mr. Walker,</HI> to send down <HI>their Arms</HI> and <HI>Amunition</HI> to them for
their greater Security. After Mr. <HI>Wiswal</HI> was returned home, the five

hand, struck at one <HI>Hosea Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er</HI> a <HI>French man,</HI> but was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="14" REF="000231_0173_0FA9AC8E368F7010"/>
from doing him mischief, however the said Indian was presently <HI>bound</HI>
and put into a <HI>Cellar.</HI> Some of the <HI>English</HI> that used to Trade with
those Indians were ready to excuse the Indian, saying he was <HI>drunke,</HI> or
that he was a <HI>distracted Fellow,</HI> but Mr. <HI>Wiswall</HI> with the other two ex∣aminants,
lookt upon those as meer Excuses, and altogether groundless,
for one of them to this day affirms, that he was as <HI>Rational and sensible</HI>
as any of the rest.</P>
<P>The ancient Indians being asked what they thought was meet to be
done in the said Case, said, he was <HI>worthy to dye</HI> for such an <HI>affront,</HI> yet
they would be glad if his life might be spared, offering to be <HI>joyntly bound</HI>
in his behalf, to pay <HI>forty Beaver Skins</HI> at the next <HI>Fall-Voyage,</HI> giv∣ing
their hands in token of their <HI>Fidelity,</HI> and also leaving their Arms
in the hands of the <HI>English</HI> as a Pledge of their <HI>faithful keeping those Ar∣ticles
of Peace</HI> concluded on betwixt them. If they proved themselves
honest men, they were to have their Arms delivered them again,
which was accordingly performed the last <HI>Iune,</HI> 1676. They having
in the mean time carried themselves peaceably toward the English.
The day after, <HI>viz. Iuly</HI> 19. 1675. An Indian of great note amongst
them, called <HI>Robin hood</HI> with great Applause of the rest, made a <HI>dance,</HI>
and <HI>sung a Song</HI> to declare their content in what was transacted. And
so they parted, setting the Indians at liberty, that had engaged thus for
their friend <HI>Sowen,</HI> the Indian; but yet to this day <HI>one Skin of Beaver</HI>
was never paid to the English, as was promised; The Indians all this
time were well provided for of victuals by <HI>Capt. Lake,</HI> with other
supplies of <HI>Rhum</HI> and <HI>Tobacco,</HI> even to the <HI>disgusting</HI> of some English
then present.</P>
<P>But the Indians left as <HI>Hostages</HI> upon <HI>Sowens</HI> account, how Civilly
soever they were treated, ran all away at the last, trusting more to the
<HI>Celerity of their own feet,</HI> then to the <HI>Civility of their English Friends;</HI>
who after they were escaped, joyned with a parcel of their Fellows
soon after about twenty in all, in <HI>robbing the house</HI> of one Mr. <HI>Purchase</HI>
an antient Planter about <HI>Pegypscot River,</HI> and a known Trader with
the Indians, what ever wrong may be pretended by the said Indians, as
done them in <HI>their Trading,</HI> (of which more may be spoken afterwards)
that will no whit excuse their <HI>perfidious Treachery,</HI> and <HI>falshood</HI> in <HI>break∣ing
Covenant</HI> with the English, dissembling, and seeking all Advantages
of Cruelty against their English Neighbours, of which in the following
<HI>Winter</HI> and <HI>Summer,</HI> 1676. there will be a more full and undenyable
discovery. This was done in the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> 1675. Those
Indians that first assaulted Mr. <HI>Purchase his house,</HI> did no other mischief,
<PB N="15" REF="000231_0174_0FA9AC8F09DE5A18"/>
save <HI>plundering it of strong Liquor,</HI> and <HI>Amunition,</HI> also killing a
Calf or two, with a few Sheep, but no more then what they eat, and
spoyling a <HI>Feather Led</HI> by ripping it open, to turn out the Feathers, con∣tenting
themselves with the Case, which they might more easily car∣ry
away. They offered no incivility to the <HI>Mistress of the house,</HI> (her
husband, and her Sons, being at that time <HI>from home</HI>) yet one of her
Sons approaching near the house, and finding it possessed of those new
Inhabitants, he rode away with all speed, and yet no faster then there
was need; for an Indian followed him with a <HI>Gun under his Coat,</HI> to
have <HI>shot at him,</HI> if he could by his <HI>flattery,</HI> and <HI>dissembling,</HI> have got
him within the reach of his <HI>Piece.</HI></P>
<P>It is said, that at the first they used fair words, and spake of Trading,
but as they went away, told those of the house, that there were others
coming after that would deal far worse with them, which within a
short time after c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to pass, for these were but the <HI>messengers of
Death,</HI> which was soon after infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted, and that in a <HI>most Barbarous
manner</HI> upon sundry Inhabitants of the <HI>Neighbouring Plantations.</HI></P>
<P>The English in those parts being much incensed hereat, Twenty five
of them soon after going up <HI>Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Bay</HI> in a <HI>Sloop and two Boats</HI> to ga∣ther
<HI>Indian Corn,</HI> and to look to what they had upon the said <HI>Bay</HI> neer
<HI>Amocoscoggen River;</HI> when they came near the houses, they heard a
<HI>knocking,</HI> and a <HI>noise about the houses,</HI> and presently esp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
<HI>two or three Indians,</HI> who did not yet see them: The English
being come a good way from their Vessel, endeavoured to get between
the Indians, and the woods, which when they perceived, they
ran toward the <HI>water side,</HI> but the English in pursuit killed one
of them, and wounded another, who yet escaped away in a <HI>Cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> cross
<HI>the River,</HI> a third running back toward the woods, fled to the other
<HI>Indians,</HI> and acquainted them with what was done, who presently came
down; and lay in wait to <HI>intercept the</HI> English, that thought of no dan∣ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
but scattered themselves all about the place to <HI>gather their Corn,</HI>
and lade the <HI>Boats therewith,</HI> but before they were ready to go away,
The <HI>Indians</HI> coming down, <HI>fired upon them,</HI> and forced them all into the
Sloop; had not some of them been better prepared then the rest; they
might all have <HI>been cut off;</HI> for some little resistance being made by them
that were <HI>ready with their Guns,</HI> it gave the rest an opportunity to get all
into the Sloop; yet not without <HI>many wounds:</HI> So with much ado, they all
<HI>escaped</HI> with their <HI>lives,</HI> leaving the <HI>two Boats</HI> almost <HI>laden with Corn</HI>
for a <HI>prey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Indians,</HI> who presently <HI>bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned one,</HI> and <HI>plundred the
other</HI> of all that was t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erein some are ready to think that the English
<PB N="16" REF="000231_0175_0FA9AC9035613110"/>
did imprudently to <HI>begin the Quarrel,</HI> and not first enquire into what
the Indians were <HI>about in the house,</HI> and seek <HI>Redress</HI> according to the
<HI>forementioned Agreement,</HI> made at the Court in <HI>Kennibeck.</HI> But if
this hapned after what follows next to be related <HI>viz.</HI> that which was
done to <HI>Old Waterly,</HI> and his <HI>Family;</HI> (the <HI>English</HI> can be blamed for
nothing, but their <HI>negligence</HI> &amp; <HI>Security,</HI> in that having <HI>alarmed</HI> their ene∣mies,
they stood not better upon their guard), which is not very certain.
For 'tis thought that within a few dayes after, or the next week more <HI>hor∣rible
outrage</HI> was committed upon the Family of an <HI>ancient man,</HI> whose
Name was <HI>Waterly,</HI> an Inhabitant of <HI>Casco Bay,</HI> who had some years be∣fore
removed from <HI>Gloucester,</HI> or <HI>Cape Anne</HI> out of some discontent,
which afterwards he often bewailed resolving either to have <HI>returned
back,</HI> or else to have <HI>removed</HI> to some <HI>securer place,</HI> but he was <HI>arrested</HI> by
the <HI>Sons of violenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> before he could Effect his purpose. This <HI>old man</HI> with
his <HI>wife,</HI> his <HI>Son,</HI> and his <HI>daughter in Law</HI> (at that time great with
Child) with <HI>three grand Children</HI> were <HI>cruelly murdered</HI> by those <HI>bar∣barous
Salvages,</HI> at one time: another of his <HI>grand Children</HI> was taken
alive, and <HI>led into Captivity,</HI> a <HI>daughter</HI> of his was said to be carryed to
<HI>Narhagauset,</HI> which shews they joyned with the <HI>Southern Indians</HI> in
<HI>the Rebellion;</HI> when once these Indians had <HI>embrued their hands in English
blood,</HI> they were <HI>emboldened</HI> to the like <HI>bloody Attempts</HI> in the <HI>Adjacent
places.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Waterly</HI> lived so far from <HI>Neighbours,</HI> or else was encompassed
with <HI>Creeks or Rivers,</HI> that no Relief could presently be sent to him,
however <HI>Lieut, Ingerson</HI> of <HI>Casco</HI> the next day with a <HI>File of men,</HI> repair∣ed
to the place where his house-stood, to see what was the Reason of the
<HI>Fire</HI> they <HI>discerned</HI> the day before, there they found the <HI>house burned to
ashes,</HI> the <HI>bodies</HI> of the old man and his wife <HI>half consumed</HI> with the <HI>fire,</HI>
the young woman <HI>killed,</HI> and <HI>three of the grand Children,</HI> having their
<HI>brains dashed out,</HI> and their bodies were laid under some <HI>Oaken Planks,</HI>
not farr from the house; <HI>one girle</HI> of about <HI>eleven years old,</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arried
<HI>Captive</HI> by them, and having been carried up and down the Country

<P>Soon after <HI>Capt. Bonithon's</HI> and <HI>Major Philips</HI> Dwellings were as∣saulted,
one on the <HI>East,</HI> the other on the <HI>West side</HI> of <HI>Saco River.</HI> It is
said, they had seasonable notice of what was intended against them, by
their <HI>Barbarous Enemies,</HI> Those <HI>Amonoscoggan Indians; viz.</HI> by an
Indian of <HI>Saco,</HI> their Neighbour, better minded then the rest of his
<PB N="17" REF="000231_0176_0FA9AC92B70D0C50"/>
<HI>Country men:</HI> who observing a strange Indian coming to his <HI>Wig∣wam</HI>
in Company with some of his acquaintance, one of whom inform∣ed
him, after the rest, (with the stranger) were gone; That the
said stranger came from the <HI>Westward,</HI> and that his business was to per∣swade
the <HI>Eastern Indians</HI> to fall upon the English in their dwellings
here, as the rest had done to the <HI>Westward. Captain Bonithon,</HI> either
upon this Information, or upon the knowledge of what was done a lit∣tle
before at <HI>Casco,</HI> had left his house, and was retired over the River
with his Family to <HI>Major Philips his Garrison.</HI> Thus <HI>two</HI> are better
then <HI>one:</HI> for otherwise, both might have been destroyed: For upon
the <HI>18th.</HI> of <HI>September</HI> following, being the <HI>7th.</HI> day of the week,
about <HI>eleven a Clock,</HI> they at <HI>Major Philip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> his Garrison saw <HI>Capt.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onithon's</HI> house on fire on the <HI>East side</HI> of <HI>Saco River,</HI> which by the
good Providence of God was to them as the <HI>firing of a Beacon,</HI> giving
them notice to <HI>look to themselves,</HI> their Enemies being now come; for
otherwise, they might to their great disadvantage have been too sud∣denly
surprized, for within <HI>half an hour after,</HI> they were upon them,
when a <HI>Sentinel</HI> placed in the <HI>Chamber</HI> gave notice that he saw an Indi∣an
by the <HI>Fence side,</HI> near a <HI>Corn Field, Major Philips</HI> not willing to be∣lieve
till he might see with his own Eyes, ran hastily up; another of
his men, coming after, cryed <HI>Mr. what mean you?</HI> do you intend to
be ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, at which words, he turned suddenly back from the <HI>window,</HI>
out of which he was looking, when presently a <HI>Bullet</HI> struck him on the
<HI>shoulder,</HI> grazing only, upon it without <HI>breaking the bone.</HI> The Indians
upon the shot, thinking he had <HI>been slain thereby,</HI> (as they heard after∣wards)
gave a <HI>great shout,</HI> upon which they discerned that they were
<HI>surrounded</HI> by them, whereupon they presently <HI>fired on the Enemy</HI>
from all <HI>Quarters,</HI> and from the <HI>Flankers of the Fortification,</HI> so as they
wounded the <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who presently leaving the Assa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt
retired <HI>three or four miles</HI> from the place, where he soon after dyed, as
they were informed: He counselled them to <HI>leave the siege,</HI> but they
were resolved not so to <HI>quit the place;</HI> nor were those within less reso∣lute
to <HI>defend it:</HI> one of the best men was soon after <HI>disabled</HI> from any
<HI>further Service,</HI> by a wound which he received in one of the <HI>Volleys</HI>
made upon them by the <HI>Assaylants;</HI> But that no whit daunted the rest
of the <HI>Defendants,</HI> who continuing still firing <HI>amain</HI> upon the Enemy:
This <HI>Dispute</HI> lasted about <HI>an hour,</HI> after which the Enemy <HI>despairing to
take the house by Assault,</HI> thought upon a device how to <HI>burn it.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>firing</HI> the house of one of his <HI>Tenants,</HI> then his <HI>Saw-M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll,</HI> after
that his <HI>Corn M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll,</HI> hoping by that means to draw them cut of the Gar∣cison

to put out the fire, but missing of their purpose in that, they
called out, you <HI>English Cowardly Dogs,</HI> come out and <HI>quench the Fire:</HI>
They continued this sport all the <HI>afternoon,</HI> continually almost without
any <HI>Intermission</HI> firing upon them: The <HI>besieged</HI> hoped for <HI>Relief</HI> from
the Town, but <HI>none came,</HI> The <HI>Major</HI> still encouraging his men to
stand it out, which they <HI>manfully did all that night,</HI> when they were
<HI>a armd</HI> almost every <HI>half hour:</HI> and betwixt whiles they could hear
their Axes and other Instruments, knocking about the Mills till the next
day: They within the house conceived they were preparing some Engine
wherewith to <HI>burn the house,</HI> which proved accordingly, for about 4 or
5 <HI>a Clock in the morning</HI> at the setting of the Moon, the <HI>Major</HI> was
called by his men to look out, when he saw a <HI>Cart with four Wheels,</HI>
having a <HI>Barricado</HI> built in the fore part, to keep off Shot, and filled
with combustible matter, <HI>birch rindes, straw, powder, and Poles twenty
Foot long,</HI> apt to <HI>fire the house:</HI> he bid them let them drive it within
<HI>Pistol shot,</HI> before they made any shot against them; His m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a
<HI>little discouraged</HI> at the sight of this <HI>Engine:</HI> but he bid them, be of <HI>good
Courage;</HI> and use the means, putting their <HI>trust in God,</HI> who, he was
<HI>confident</HI> would deliver them: The Cart, when brought a little nearer,
became <HI>unweildy</HI> by Reason of the <HI>Barricado</HI> planted in it, and being
to pass through a <HI>small gutter,</HI> one <HI>Wheel stuck fast in the Slough,</HI> which
brought the Cart suddenly to the Left, whereby the <HI>Drivers</HI> lay all open
to their <HI>right Flanker,</HI> when presently they fired upon them out of the
said <HI>Flanker,</HI> and having so fair a shot upon them, and not being above
<HI>Pistol shot</HI> from the place, they killed <HI>six of the Enemy,</HI> and wounded
<HI>fifteen,</HI> as they found afterwards, which no doubt made them too late
to repent of their Resolution, not to follow their <HI>Captains Counsel</HI> and
Example in leaving the Siege; for now they presently departed: So
as at Sun rise, they within the house espyed <HI>forty</HI> of them <HI>marching away,</HI>
but how many more were in the Company they could not tell.</P>
<P>The Indians it seemed went toward <HI>Blue poin,</HI> where it is said they
killed <HI>several pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sons:</HI> but those in the house fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed they went for more

defended. Major Philips</HI> sent to the <HI>Town</HI> for help, acquainting them
with what had passed, but none was sent them, either <HI>that da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or the

<PB N="19" REF="000231_0178_0FA9AC9383C04420"/>
<HI>burnt</HI> down the <HI>empty house.</HI> There were <HI>fifty persons</HI> in the said house
during the time of the Siege, and but <HI>ten able hands;</HI> they had <HI>five more</HI>
that could do something, but <HI>through Age,</HI> or <HI>minority,</HI> not able to
make any <HI>notable Resistance;</HI> yet so it pleased God, in whose hands are
all mens lives and limbs, and who is never wont to fail them, who in
time of <HI>danger</HI> are ready so to <HI>confide in his power,</HI> and <HI>goodness,</HI> as not to
neglect the use of due means for their own Preservation, so to order
things, that not one person of all those <HI>fifty,</HI> was either <HI>killed,</HI> or <HI>mor∣tally
wounded. Major Philips</HI> himself was wounded, but not dangerous∣ly
at the beginning of the Assault, his Mal's with other Edifices were the
first day burned by the Enemy, &amp; so were all the houses at <HI>Saco,</HI> or most
of them soon after, that were above the <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sher-mens stages.</HI> One Mrs.
<HI>Hitcock</HI> being carried Captive by the Enemy from the same place, <HI>dy∣ed
in the Winter following,</HI> by eating some poysonous Root, in stead of
a ground out, as was reported by the Indians afterwards.</P>
<P>Much about the same time, five persons going up to the River of <HI>Sa∣co,</HI>
were all kiiled by the same Indians.</P>
<P>These Tragedies being thus acted at <HI>Casco Bay,</HI> and <HI>Saco,</HI> those Bar∣barous
Enemies dispersed themselves in parties, intending to do all the
mischief they could to all the English, inhabiting about that side of the
Country; In the same Month of <HI>September</HI> they came down towards
<HI>Pascat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qua,</HI> doing the like Spoyle upon the Inhabitants of the several
Branches of that River, which they had been doing elsewhere; In the
first place they burned the two <HI>Cheslyes</HI> houses abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Oyster River,</HI> and kil∣led
two men that were passing along the River in a <HI>Canoo;</HI> and carried a∣way
an old Irish-man, with a young man taken from about <HI>Exceter,</HI> who
yet both of them soon after made an escape to a Garrison at <HI>Salmon-Falls</HI>
in <HI>Kittary</HI> by the help of an Indian better minded then the rest,
the first after <HI>seven weeks,</HI> the other after a Months Captivity.</P>
<P>Much about that time, one Goodman <HI>Robinson</HI> of <HI>Exceter</HI> with his Son
were travelling toward <HI>Hampton,</HI> where, as they passed along, they
were <HI>way-laid</HI> by <HI>three Indians, viz. Iohn Samson, Cromwel,</HI> and <HI>Iohn
Linde,</HI> who shot down the <HI>old man,</HI> whom they left <HI>dead upon the place;</HI>
his Son, hearing the <HI>Guns</HI> escaped their hands, by running into a <HI>Sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mp,</HI>
whither the Indians pursued him, but could <HI>not overtake</HI> him, so as he
got safe into <HI>Hampton</HI> about <HI>midnight,</HI> where he declared what <HI>befel
him</HI> by the way, and how <HI>narrowly</HI> he <HI>avoided the danger,</HI> intimating
like wise, that he feared his <HI>Father was killed,</HI> which was found too true,
by <HI>Lieut. Swet,</HI> who the next day with a <HI>dozen Souldiers,</HI> of the <HI>Town,</HI>
went to search those <HI>woods,</HI> where they sound the <HI>poor old man,</HI> shot
<PB N="20" REF="000231_0179_0FA9AC9436711E58"/>
through at his <HI>back,</HI> the bullet having pierced through <HI>his body,</HI> and was
stopped by the <HI>skin on the other side:</HI> Another of <HI>Exceter,</HI> called <HI>Foul∣sam,</HI>
was at the same time <HI>driving a pair of Oxen</HI> in the same <HI>Road,</HI>
where, soon after he heard the Report of the <HI>Guns</HI> when <HI>Robinson</HI> was
killed, he espyed the <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> creeping</HI> upon their bellies <HI>towards
him,</HI> to do as much for him as they had done for <HI>Robinson,</HI> but leaving
his <HI>Oxen,</HI> he put on his horse with all speed, and so was delivered from
the danger that the other fell into, it is reported that one of the <HI>Indians
made a shot at him;</HI> but he was either <HI>gotten out of their reach,</HI> or else
they <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed their aim</HI> at that time. The same Indians had a little be∣fore
met with another <HI>English man</HI> in those woods, one <HI>Charles Rand∣let,</HI>
whom they <HI>carryed Captive,</HI> although he <HI>soon after</HI> escaped out of
their <HI>hands,</HI> by the help of another <HI>Indian</HI> called <HI>Iames.</HI> It is said there
were <HI>four Indians</HI> of that Company, and that the <HI>fourth</HI> was sent away
with <HI>Randlet,</HI> so that there were but <HI>three</HI> seen together at the <HI>killing,</HI> and
pursuing the other forementioned. One of the said Indians, <HI>viz. Iohn
Samson</HI> was killed by some of <HI>Capt. Hathorns Souldiers</HI> at <HI>Casco Bay</HI>
in <HI>September</HI> following 1676 when the Scouts of our forces came upon
the <HI>Indians on the sudden,</HI> and had a <HI>small brush</HI> with them; but all the
rest made a shift to get away: As for the other two, <HI>viz. Cromwel,</HI> and
<HI>Io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Linde;</HI> one of them, it is said, is since killed, or taken and <HI>sold
away,</HI> the other is at <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> whom <HI>vengeance</HI> may also in due time
<HI>overtake,</HI> as it hath done <HI>the other.</HI></P>
<P>Within a few dayes after that <HI>barbarous Fact</HI> at <HI>Oyster River,</HI> two
Indians, <HI>viz</HI> one named <HI>Andrew,</HI> and the other <HI>Hope-hood,</HI> the Son of
him called <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> assaulted the house of one <HI>Tozer</HI> at <HI>Neweche∣wannick,</HI>

till the Indians had <HI>chopt it in pieces</HI> with their <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chets,</HI> when entring
the house, they <HI>knocked the poor maid</HI> down with their <HI>Hatchets,</HI> and
gave her many <HI>other wounds,</HI> leaving her <HI>for dead</HI> upon the place; after
which, they passed on toward the next dwelling, in their way meeting
with <HI>two Children,</HI> that had escaped the house first broken open by them,
<HI>they killed</HI> one of them, of three years old, which could not follow fast

enough, or else they that carryed it, could not <HI>convey it over a Fence</HI>
soon enough to <HI>save themselves</HI> and it; And carryed away the other of
<HI>seven year old,</HI> which yet was returned safe within <HI>half a year</HI> after:
The <HI>poor Maid</HI> that had <HI>ventured her own Life</HI> so far, to save many
others, was by a <HI>strange Providence</HI> enabled to recover so much
strength after they were gone, as to repair to the <HI>next Garrison,</HI> where
she was soon after <HI>healed of her wound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and restored to <HI>perfect health</HI>
again.</P>
<P>The next day toward night more of the <HI>Barbarous Enemies</HI> being
<HI>gathered together</HI> they made <HI>another Assault</HI> upon the <HI>neighbouring dwel∣lings.</HI></P>
<P>The English, as many as could be spared out of the <HI>Garrison,</HI> (not
above <HI>eight</HI> in number) pusued after them about <HI>half a mile,</HI> but night
coming on, it was judged best <HI>to retreat,</HI> l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st otherwise they might have
been <HI>Intercepted</HI> in their return home, by any of them <HI>lying in Ambush,</HI>
which is their usual way of <HI>doing mischief.</HI> After divers shot made on
<HI>both sides,</HI> but <HI>five</HI> of the Enemies appeared: who yet took the Advan∣tage
of <HI>Captain Wincals</HI> absence, (whose dwelling was not far off) to
<HI>burne his house and Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> with another <HI>house,</HI> and <HI>two Barns</HI> more,
wherein was much <HI>English Corn;</HI> above an <HI>hundred Bushels</HI> was supposed
to be in one of them. After they had done this mischief they fled
away.</P>
<P>The next day after, the same <HI>Indians,</HI> or others of their <HI>Fellows,</HI>
came upon the other side of the River, from whence they <HI>shot over se∣veral
times,</HI> to some that were <HI>grinding in the Mill,</HI> but after the ex∣changing
of many <HI>shot</HI> on <HI>both sides of the River,</HI> betwixt them, <HI>six of the
Enemy</HI> shewed themselves in the <HI>Twilight,</HI> uttering several <HI>Insolent</HI> and
<HI>barbarous Speeches</HI> calling our men <HI>English dogs,</HI> &amp;c. yet all this while
out of reach of their <HI>shot,</HI> and then they ran all away <HI>like dogs after they
had done barking.</HI></P>
<P>After this, those very Indians, as was supposed, burned <HI>five or six
houses</HI> about <HI>Oyster River,</HI> and killed <HI>two men, viz.</HI> one <HI>William Roberts</HI>
and his <HI>Son in Law.</HI> The Inhabitants of <HI>Dover,</HI> with some other <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>so∣lute
young men,</HI> being much provoked by these many <HI>Insolencies,</HI> and
<HI>injuries</HI> done by the Enemies, obtained liberty from the <HI>Major of the
Regiment,</HI> to try whether they could not meet with some of the Indians,
by <HI>secret Ambushes,</HI> and <HI>sculking amongst the Bushes and Trees,</HI> as the
Indians used to do with them, to which End about <HI>twenty</HI> divided them∣selves
into <HI>several small parties:</HI> soon after as they were looking after
the Enemy, a party of ours <HI>espyed five of the Indians,</HI> some gathering
<PB N="22" REF="000231_0181_0FA9AC99CFF451F0"/>
Corn in the Field while the rest of them were busied in <HI>beating of an
Oven</HI> to bake some of the fruit which they gathered also in the same Field.</P>
<P>The English were at such a distance that they could not make <HI>any
sign</HI> to their <HI>Fellows,</HI> without being discovered by the Indians in the
Field; wherefore <HI>two of them crept</HI> as near as they could to <HI>the house,</HI>
at one end of <HI>the Field,</HI> where they <HI>suddenly rushed</HI> upon <HI>two of the
wretches,</HI> and <HI>knocked them down</HI> with the Butt end of their Muskets,
which was not done so <HI>silently,</HI> but the other <HI>three in the Field</HI> took the
<HI>Alarm,</HI> and fled away, who else might as easily have been <HI>surprized as</HI>
the other two.</P>
<P>These Outrages thus daily committed, <HI>filled all the Plantations</HI> about
<HI>Pascataqua</HI> with <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>confusion;</HI> scarce any place, where there was
not either <HI>Reason for some to complain</HI> of <HI>the loss of their Friends,</HI> or <HI>burn∣ing
of their houses;</HI> which caused most of them that lived <HI>scatteringly,</HI> at
any distance from <HI>Neighbours,</HI> either to <HI>garrison</HI> their houses, or else to
<HI>desert their own dwellings,</HI> and to <HI>repair</HI> to their next <HI>Neighbours</HI> that
were <HI>better fortified</HI> then themselves; But all the Inhabitants in those
parts in general, were Alarmed to stand upon their Guard.</P>
<P>On the <HI>seventh</HI> of <HI>October</HI> following, being a day of <HI>publick Humili∣ation,</HI>
a man was <HI>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t down</HI> as he was riding between <HI>two garrison houses</HI>
about <HI>Newechewannick▪</HI> and <HI>dyed of his wounds</HI> within <HI>two hours</HI> after;
About the same instant of time <HI>two young men</HI> were <HI>shot dead</HI> about a
mile from that place; These two had their Arms or Guns with them,
which were carryed away by them that <HI>killed them,</HI> together with their
<HI>upper garments;</HI> It is not said that these three last, (though killed upon
<HI>a day of Humiliation</HI>) were <HI>surprized</HI> in their <HI>repairing</HI> to, or <HI>retur∣ning</HI>
from the place of <HI>publick worship,</HI> which would in a great
measure have abated the <HI>sorrow of their sad Funerals,</HI> if when they were
<HI>suddenly arrested by the Harbingers of Death,</HI> they had been found so
doing.</P>
<P>Soon after this, they Assaulted another <HI>house</HI> at <HI>Oyster River,</HI> the
which, although it was garrisoned, yet meeting with a <HI>good old man,</HI>
whose Name was <HI>Beard</HI> without the Garrison, they killed him upon the
place, and in a <HI>barbarons manner cut off his head,</HI> and <HI>set it upon a Pole in
derision,</HI> not far off about the same time <HI>they burned another house and
Barne.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the <HI>sixteenth</HI> of <HI>October</HI> being <HI>Saturday,</HI> about an <HI>hundred of
the Indians</HI> were gathered together, to Assault <HI>Newechewannick;</HI> They
began with one named <HI>Tozer,</HI> half a mile from the <HI>upper Garrison,</HI> at
<HI>Salmon Falls.</HI> The said <HI>Tozer</HI> was presently killed <HI>his Son taken

Captive,</HI> (but returned after some <HI>Months Restraint</HI>) several <HI>Guns</HI>
being shot at this <HI>Assault,</HI> Alarmed <HI>Lieut. Plaisted</HI> at the next <HI>Garri∣son,</HI>
who like a man of a <HI>publick Spirit</HI> immediately sent out <HI>seven men</HI>
from the <HI>Garrison</HI> under his <HI>Command,</HI> to see what the matter was, but
being met by an <HI>Ambush laid in the way</HI> as they went, lost <HI>two or three
of their Company,</HI> the rest <HI>hardly escaping</HI> back to the place whence
they came, whereupon, the said <HI>Lieut. Plaisted</HI> immediately <HI>dispatch∣ed</HI>
away a <HI>Messenger</HI> to <HI>Major Waldern</HI> at <HI>Quechecho,</HI> which because

<P>What <HI>Answer</HI> was returned to this <HI>importunate and pathetical Let∣ter</HI>
is not fully known at present; most probably he that was <HI>most con∣cerned
in the Contents</HI> of it was either <HI>absent from home,</HI> or in no <HI>Capa∣city
to send</HI> the Relief desired; which if it could have been had, might
have prevented the <HI>sad mischief that fell out the next day;</HI> when <HI>Lieut.
Plaisted</HI> being more earne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly bent to perform that <HI>last office of love</HI> to
his <HI>deceased Friend,</HI> whom he could not by all his Endeavours save
from the danger of death, while they were in the Land of the living
would needs venture himself with twenty Souldiers out of his Garrison,
to fetch off the dead bodies.</P>
<P>To that end he ordered a pair of Oxen to be yoked to bring them to his
Garrison, in order to their Christian buryal, not considering that the
Indians lay sculking thereabouts, waiting for such opportunityes. They
went first to the furthest place, where they found <HI>Ro. Tozers body,</HI> and
put it into their Cart, but coming back to take up the other <HI>two bo∣dies,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="000231_0183_0FA9AC9C6FAB3F40"/>
which were fallen in a little <HI>Swampe</HI> nearer to the Garri∣son,
they were set upon by an hundred and fifty of the Enemy,
that had hid themselves in the <HI>bushes,</HI> and under a <HI>stone wall,</HI> and <HI>Loggs</HI> in
the way as they were to pass; By the sudden noyse of the guns, the <HI>Cattle</HI>
being <HI>frighted</HI> ran away to the garrison with <HI>such of the dead,</HI> as were
first laid up thereon, (and possibly with one of them wounded at that
instant) leaving their <HI>Owners</HI> to <HI>fight it out</HI> with their Enemies. <HI>Lieut.
Plaisted</HI> being thus <HI>desperately Assaulted,</HI> he with his <HI>twenty men,</HI> was
forced to <HI>retreat</HI> to a place of <HI>better Advantage;</HI> but being there so <HI>hot∣ly
pursued,</HI> they were not able to <HI>abide it long;</HI> Although they <HI>killed</HI>
and <HI>mortally wounded</HI> several of the Indians, as themselves have <HI>since
confessed:</HI> but they most of them being so much <HI>overmatched,</HI> took the
opportunity of a <HI>fair Retreat,</HI> and so got safe to their Garrison, while
<HI>Lieut. Plaisted</HI> out of the <HI>height of his Courage,</HI> disdaining either to fly
from, or <HI>yield himself</HI> (for 'tis said) the Indians were loth to <HI>kill him,</HI>
but desirous rather to take him <HI>Prisoner</HI>) into the hands of such <HI>cursed
Caytiffes,</HI> did <HI>fight</HI> it cut <HI>desperately,</HI> till he was <HI>slain upon the place,</HI> his
<HI>Eldest Son</HI> and another man were slain in their too late Retreat, and his
other <HI>Son</HI> was <HI>sorely, wounded,</HI> so that he dyed within a few <HI>weeks after.</HI></P>
<P>The Indians were contented with this mischief for the present (and
indeed if all the <HI>English</HI> they had to deal with, had shewed the like Re∣solution
with this <HI>Plaisted</HI> they would not have done <HI>half the mischeef,</HI>
that since hath been done by them) and <HI>slunke</HI> away into the <HI>woods</HI>
before the next day, when <HI>Captain Frost</HI> came up from <HI>Sturgeon Creck,</HI>
(a few miles below the River) with a party of his friends, and buryed
the dead: During these <HI>onsets,</HI> the Enemy also <HI>took their Advantage</HI>
to burne three houses, and two barns before they left the place.</P>
<P>The latter End of the <HI>same Month</HI> they <HI>burned a Mill</HI> near the same
place belonging to <HI>Mr. Hutchinson</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Boston;</HI> from whence
they came down lower toward <HI>Sturgeon Creek,</HI> where they <HI>burned</HI> one
house, and <HI>killed two men,</HI> not far from <HI>Captain Frost</HI>'s dwelling, he
escaping himself very narrowly, being shot at by the Enemy, about
<HI>Ten in Number,</HI> who might easily have <HI>burned</HI> his house, and taken
all that were in it, being but three boyes besides himself, had he not
used this policy, to <HI>call out</HI> to some to march this, and the <HI>other way,</HI>
to look after the Indians, as if he had had many at hand to Command,
which under God was the means of his escape; for his house was
neither Fortified, nor well manned, yet was far from Neighbours.</P>
<P>The <HI>next day</HI> the said Indians passed down the River on <HI>Kittary
side, killed one man,</HI> whose house they <HI>first plundered,</HI> and then set it
<PB N="25" REF="000231_0184_0FA9AC9D46E7AF58"/>
on <HI>fire;</HI> All this was done just over against <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> from whence
out of a small <HI>Battery</HI> was discharged a <HI>piece of Ordnance,</HI> which by a
<HI>good Providence</HI> was directed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>fling its shot</HI> as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell very near <HI>a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ty</HI>
of the Indians, for they were to <HI>affrighted therewith,</HI> (if none of
them were killed) that they <HI>left good part</HI> of their <HI>plunder</HI> near the
place: They were <HI>pursued</HI> by some of the English, before they could
recover <HI>their home,</HI> and by the help of the <HI>Snow that fell about that time,</HI>
were traced till they were <HI>overtaken,</HI> but being near a <HI>Swamp,</HI> them∣selves
escaped, for hast leaving <HI>two</HI> of their <HI>Packs behind them.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after they went up the <HI>River</HI> again to <HI>Quechecho,</HI> where they
<HI>burned an house,</HI> and <HI>two or three Barns.</HI> Another Party of them got
over or beyond the other <HI>branches</HI> of <HI>Pascataqua River,</HI> toward <HI>Exce∣ter,</HI>
and <HI>Lampny Eyle River,</HI> where they <HI>killed one man:</HI> sundry of
them were seen in the <HI>woods</HI> about <HI>Exceter;</HI> and between <HI>Hampton</HI> and
<HI>Exceter,</HI> where they <HI>killed one</HI> or <HI>two men</HI> in the <HI>woods</HI> as they were
travelling homewards, occasioning the people of those <HI>Towns</HI> to stand
continually upon <HI>their guard,</HI> which proved a great <HI>annoyance</HI> to the
Inhabitants.</P>
<P>But to look a little back to the <HI>Plantations</HI> more <HI>Eastward</HI> from
<HI>Pascataqua River,</HI> where these outrages of the Indians first began.</P>
<P>At <HI>Casco Bay Lieut. Ingersons</HI> Son, with another man going out a
fowling about this time, were <HI>both killed</HI> before they returned-home, his
<HI>Fathers houses</HI> being <HI>burned,</HI> with wany others also thereabouts.</P>
<P>At <HI>Black point, Lieut. Augur</HI> with <HI>two more</HI> were assaulted by the
Indians, where after <HI>many shot</HI> exchanged betwixt them, himself was
so wounded, that he <HI>dyed soon after,</HI> and his brother also was <HI>killed</HI> with∣in
a <HI>few dayes afterwards,</HI> not far from the same place.</P>
<P>When the rising of the Indians <HI>first began</HI> in those <HI>Eastern parts,</HI>
(with us called the <HI>County of Yorkshire) Captain Wincol</HI> of <HI>Neweche∣wannick,</HI>
with some others, having a <HI>Sympathy</HI> for the sufferings of the
Neighbours, marched up that way with a small party of men; In his
<HI>first Skirmish</HI> with the Enemy he <HI>chanced to loose two o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three of his Com∣pany;</HI>
the rest being not above <HI>eleven in all,</HI> as they were marching a∣long
by the <HI>Sea side</HI> were assaulted by a <HI>great number</HI> of the Indians,
judged to be <HI>an hundred and fifty:</HI> he being <HI>hard beset</HI> with so great a
number retreated to an <HI>heap of Bolts</HI> that lay near the <HI>water side,</HI>
by the <HI>shelter</HI> of which they lay safe from the <HI>Indians Guns,</HI> and
so well p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed their <HI>few Guns,</HI> that they slew many of their Ene∣mies,
and put them all to a kinde of <HI>Route</HI> at the last: After which
by the help of an <HI>old Canoo,</HI> they recovered safe to the other side
<PB N="26" REF="000231_0185_0FA9AC9DF54A5D50"/>
of the Banke. But <HI>nine Saco men</HI> had worse success, who yet
came with a very <HI>good Intention</HI> to help their friends, upon the hear∣ing
of their Guns; but as they came to Rescue <HI>Captain Wincol</HI> with
his small party, they themselves fell into an <HI>Ambush</HI> of the Indians, and
so were <HI>all cut off,</HI> with <HI>two other</HI> men also, near the place where the
<HI>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Skirmish</HI> was, for the Indians from the <HI>shore side</HI> could di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scern any
that were coming towards them, when they were a <HI>great way off▪</HI> and
so might easily <HI>way-lay</HI> them, before they could come up to them. Near
upon <HI>seven houses</HI> were burned about this time, and some <HI>persons killed</HI>
at <HI>Black point.</HI></P>
<P>Two persons likewise were <HI>killed</HI> at <HI>Wells</HI> in the beginning of the
winter, one of them were servant to <HI>Mr. William Simonds</HI> (one of the
principal men in the Town aforesaid) the Gentleman himself with his
<HI>Family</HI> were removed to a <HI>Garrison house</HI> in the middle of the Town,
<HI>his servant</HI> going early in the <HI>morning</HI> to look after some business there;
ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed longer t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en was needful <HI>to provide something for himself,</HI> the In∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves</HI> to <HI>breakfast</HI> with him, making the <HI>poor Fellow
pay the shot,</HI> when they had done, with the <HI>loss of his life.</HI></P>
<P>A week after one <HI>Cross</HI> was slain at <HI>Wells</HI> likewise, who was a kind
of a <HI>distracted F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow.</HI> Also one <HI>Isaack Cousins</HI> was there <HI>killed</HI> in the
beginning of <HI>Winter,</HI> after there had been some <HI>Overtures of pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> be∣twixt
<HI>Major Waldern</HI> and the Indians.</P>
<P>With such kind of mutual Encounters was the latter part of the year
spent betwixt the Indians and the English from <HI>Pascataqua River</HI> to <HI>Ken∣nibeck,</HI>
from the <HI>beginning of August</HI> to the <HI>End of November,</HI> wherein
many were <HI>slain</HI> on both sides: In one place, and in another; of the
English in those parts were slaiin <HI>upward of fifty.</HI> The Enemy lost as
<HI>appeared afterward</HI> by their own <HI>Confession,</HI> above <HI>ninety,</HI> partly in the
<HI>foresaid Skirmishes,</HI> and partly in their joyning with the Indians to the
<HI>Westward,</HI> whither it is said, many of them were <HI>invited to repair,</HI> to
help <HI>destroy the English,</HI> in hope to enjoy their possessions afterwards;
But <HI>God had otherwise determined,</HI> who did arise at last to <HI>save the meek
ones of the Earth,</HI> and <HI>plead the Cause of his People.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Counsel</HI> of <HI>Massachusets,</HI> had, at this time, their
hands full with the like Attempts of <HI>Philip</HI> and his <HI>Complices</HI> to the
<HI>Westward,</HI> yet were not unmindful of the <HI>deplorable Condition</HI> of these
<HI>Eastern Plantations;</HI> having committed the care thereof to the <HI>Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs</HI>
of the <HI>Respective Regiments</HI> of the several <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntyes</HI> on that <HI>side
of the Country,</HI> but more especially to the care and prudence of the <HI>Ho∣noured
Major D. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on,</HI> the <HI>Major General</HI> of the whole <HI>Colony,</HI> a
<PB N="27" REF="000231_0186_0FA9AC9F0E6BC5C0"/>
Gentleman, who by his great <HI>insight</HI> in, and long Experience of all
<HI>Martial Affairs,</HI> was every way <HI>accomplished</HI> for the <HI>managing</HI> that
whole Affair; He had, to ease the other side of the Country, drawn out
a <HI>sufficient number of Souldiers</HI> from the next Countyes, to have redu∣ced
all the Indians <HI>Eastward</HI> to their <HI>obedience;</HI> but just as they were
intended to <HI>march up to the head Quarters</HI> of the Indians, to fall upon
them there, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>Ossapy,</HI> and <HI>Pigwauch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> about an <HI>hundred miles</HI> up
into the Country <HI>Northward.</HI></P>
<P>The Winter setting in so sharp and severe in the beginning of <HI>De∣cember,</HI>
and latter end of <HI>November,</HI> It was not possible to have <HI>march∣ed
a dayes Iourny</HI> into the woods, without hazarding all their lives that
should <HI>venture</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p; The <HI>Snow</HI> being found generally in those woods,
<HI>four foot thick</HI> on the <HI>10th. of December,</HI> so as it was not possible for
any to have travelled that way, unless they carryed <HI>Rackets under their
feet,</HI> wherewith to walk upon the <HI>top of the Snow:</HI> This alone Conside∣ration
forced them to <HI>lay aside their designe</HI> for the present, but soon af∣ter
it was done to their hands; for the <HI>depth of the Snow,</HI> and <HI>sharpness
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld</HI> were so extream, that the Indians in those parts were so
<HI>pinched therewith,</HI> that being <HI>hunger sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved,</HI> they began to <HI>sue for peace,</HI>
making their Address first to <HI>Major Waldern</HI> on that account, by whose
mediations that <HI>whole body</HI> of Indians <HI>Eastward</HI> were brought to an
<HI>hopeful Conclusion of peace,</HI> which was <HI>mutually agreed upon,</HI> and possi∣bly
might have remained <HI>firm enough</HI> to this day had there not been
<HI>too just an occasion</HI> given, for the breaking of the same by the <HI>wicked
practice</HI> of some lewd persons, which <HI>opened the door,</HI> and made way for
the bringing in all those sad Calamities, and mischiefs that have since
fallen upon those parts of the Country; As shall hereafter be de∣clared.</P>
<P>In the latter end of <HI>Iune,</HI> 1676 The Indians that had made a <HI>ge∣neral
Conspiracy</HI> against the English were <HI>strangely dispersed,</HI> and <HI>dispi∣rited,</HI>
so as they from that time began to <HI>separate one from another,</HI> and
every Nation of them to shift for themselves, as hath been already men∣tioned
in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormer part of this Narrative. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> the great

<HI>dissemble</HI> their <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>disposition</HI> past before from suspition
of mischief▪ nor yet so <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tificially conceale</HI> their persons, but they were
easily discerned by such as in former times had any <HI>acquaintance</HI> with
the <HI>Eastern Indians</HI> by way of <HI>Trade,</HI> or other <HI>Converse:</HI> Whereup∣on
the forces newly raised in the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> under the Command
of <HI>Captain William Hatborne,</HI> and <HI>Captain Ioseph Syll,</HI> designed for the
subduing of those Indians about the River of <HI>Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imack,</HI> and <HI>Pascata∣qua,</HI>
that still stood out <HI>in Hostility</HI> against the <HI>English,</HI> meeting with
those under the Command of <HI>Major Waldern</HI> aforesaid, and <HI>Capt. Frost</HI>
of <HI>Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tary;</HI> It was mutually agreed detwixt those several Command∣ers
to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz: upon all those Indians that at that time were <HI>met together</HI>
about <HI>Major Walderns dwelling</HI> at <HI>Quechecho;</HI> The <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rivement</HI> suc∣ceeded
according to expectation, &amp; all the said Indians <HI>were handsomely
surprized, September 6th.</HI> 1676. without the <HI>loss</HI> of any <HI>persons life,</HI> either
Indian or English; to the number of near <HI>four hundred:</HI> by which de∣vice,
after our Forces had them all in their hands, they <HI>separated</HI> the
<HI>peaceable</HI> from the <HI>perfidious,</HI> that had been our E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mies, during the
late Troubles; finding above <HI>two hundred</HI> involved in the <HI>former Re∣bellion,</HI>
more or less, accordingly they were sent down to the <HI>Governour
and Councel</HI> at <HI>Bos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on;</HI> who adjudged <HI>seven</HI> or <HI>eight</HI> of them Immedi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tely
to dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; such as were known to have had their <HI>hand in the blood</HI> of
the English, or that had been <HI>shed by their means,</HI> the rest, that were found
only <HI>Accessaries</HI> to the late <HI>mischiefs,</HI> had their lives spared, but were
sent into <HI>other parts of the world,</HI> to try the <HI>difference</HI> between the <HI>Friend∣ship</HI>
of their <HI>Neighbours</HI> here, and their <HI>Service</HI> with other <HI>Masters</HI>
elsewhere.</P>
<P>Those who had been alwayes either <HI>peaceable and true</HI> to the English,
never <HI>intermedling</HI> in the <HI>quarrel,</HI> as <HI>Wannalancet</HI> the <HI>Sagamore of Pen∣nicook</HI>
and some others were quietly dismissed to their own places.</P>
<P>Besides these that were surprized at the time aforesaid; there were
several others, who had been the <HI>chief Actors,</HI> that were <HI>taken up and
down</HI> in those <HI>woods</HI> beyond <HI>Merrimack,</HI> and so were delivered <HI>up to
Iustice;</HI> As <HI>Iohn Monoco, Sagamore Sam,</HI> old <HI>Iethro,</HI> with some others,
as hath been already mentioned, yet young <HI>Ieth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o</HI> brought in <HI>forty</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
one time. It was a <HI>special favour from God,</HI> so to order it, that the In∣dians
aforesaid, were so surprized: for had they continued in their <HI>for∣mer
Rebellion,</HI> and had taken the opportunity to have joyned with the
<HI>Eastern Indians,</HI> as some of them did a <HI>few Months</HI> before, they would
in all likelihood have <HI>utterly destroyed all</HI> the Plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations of the English

<PB N="29" REF="000231_0188_0FA9ACA1B852A7C8"/>
which was <HI>lately done</HI> by the means of <HI>a few,</HI> that by too much <HI>Conni∣vence</HI>
of some in those parts, that entertained a better opinion of them
then it seems they deserved. For whereas mention formerly was made of
a <HI>small party</HI> of Indians that on the <HI>third of May</HI> in this <HI>present year,</HI> had
<HI>murdered</HI> one <HI>Thomas Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bel</HI> of <HI>Bradford,</HI> and carryed <HI>away his wife</HI> &amp;
<HI>five Children</HI> Captive, yet <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> of the <HI>Actors</HI> did, upon what
<HI>Consideration</HI> is not known, retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the <HI>woman and Children again</HI>
within <HI>six weeks,</HI> and because of their <HI>voluntary returning of them,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
dealt more favourably withal; being only put into <HI>prison</HI> at <HI>Dove:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
a time, yet possibly conceiving that a prison was but a <HI>prep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or
a worse evil, they took an opportunity (<HI>two of the chief Actors</HI> in the
foresaid mischief, called the one <HI>Simond,</HI> the other <HI>Andrew</HI>) to <HI>convey
themselves</HI> out of the place of <HI>Restraint,</HI> and afterwards going amongst
the <HI>Amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>scoggan</HI> and <HI>Kennibeck</HI> Indians, have joyned with them in
those <HI>bloody and cruel depredations</HI> lately made in those parts, which fol∣low
in order next to be related.</P>
<P>Some little Colour or pretence of injury was a Headged before those
<HI>Eastern</HI> Indians began their outrage both in the former, as well as in the
present year, the chief Actor or rather the beginner of all the foresaid
mischiefs <HI>Eastward,</HI> is one <HI>Squando,</HI> the <HI>Sagamore</HI> of <HI>Saco</HI> Indians,
whose <HI>Squaw</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is said was abused by a <HI>rude</HI> and <HI>indiscreet act</HI> of some
<HI>English Seamen</HI> in the <HI>last S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmer,</HI> 1675. who either overset the <HI>Ca∣noo</HI>
wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ein the said <HI>Squaw</HI> with her Child were swimming in a River
thereabouts, or else to try whether the Children of the Indians as they
had heard, could S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imme as naturally as any other <HI>Creatures, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting∣ly
cast her Child into the water;</HI> but the <HI>Squaw</HI> immediately <HI>diving</HI> in∣to
the water after it, fetcht it up from the <HI>bottom of the River,</HI> yet it
so falling out that within a <HI>while after</HI> the said <HI>Child dyed,</HI> (which it
might have done if no such <HI>Affront</HI> had been offered) The <HI>said Squando</HI>
Father of the Child hath been so <HI>provoked thereat,</HI> that he hath ever since
set himself to do all the mischief he can to the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>those par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> and
was never as yet since that time <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruly willing to be Reconciled.</HI> Although
he is said to have <HI>sent home</HI> some that were <HI>taken Captive</HI> the last year.
Surely if their hearts had not been <HI>secretly filled with malice and Revenge</HI>
before, they might have obtained <HI>satisfaction for the wrong done,</HI> at an
<HI>easier Rate</HI> More probable it is, that this was only an occasion to
vent the mischief they formerly had conceived in their hearts.</P>
<P>There is an <HI>injury</HI> of an <HI>higher nature,</HI> mentioned as the ground of
their <HI>quarrel</HI> with us, who live about <HI>Pemma quid,</HI> and <HI>Kennibeck,</HI>
which hapned the <HI>last Spring, viz.</HI> one <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aughton</HI> with another person
<PB N="30" REF="000231_0189_0FA9ACA56A84F6C8"/>
or more who having obtained under the hand of <HI>Major Waldern a war∣rant</HI>
to seize any Indians <HI>Eastward,</HI> that had been guilty of any <HI>Mur∣der</HI>
or <HI>spoyle</HI> done to the <HI>English</HI> in those parts; did most <HI>perfidiously</HI> and
<HI>wickedly</HI> enti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e some of the Indians about <HI>Cape Sables,</HI> who never had
been in the least manner guilty of any injury done to the <HI>English,</HI> aboard
their <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssel,</HI> or else some other way, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> carryed them away to sell
them for <HI>slaves;</HI> which the Indians in those parts look upon as an injury
done to themselves, and have alledged it to the <HI>Inhabitants of Pemma∣quid,</HI>
as one of the <HI>principal grounds</HI> of their <HI>present quarrel:</HI> The
thing alleadged is too ture as to matter of Fact, and the persons that did
it were lately committed to prison in order to their <HI>further tryal.</HI> Yet
all those Indians do, or may know full well that they who did them that
wrong, were lyable to <HI>due punishment,</HI> (or else their <HI>quarrel</HI> might be
accounted just, and they considered as Indians, must have the more al∣lowance)
if they could be found, nor ever were any countenanced a∣mongst
us, that had done them any kind of injury, nor did those that
take upon them the revenging of the injury, know that they were <HI>Inha∣bitants</HI>
of this <HI>Country</HI> that did the <HI>wrong;</HI> nor was then ever any <HI>orderly
Complaint</HI> made thereof, but this cannot excuse their <HI>perfidiousness</HI> and
<HI>Cruelty,</HI> some other pretences were alleadged by the said Indians that
yet do bear no proportion to the mention of a <HI>wrong</HI> or <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jury, viz.</HI> be∣cause
our <HI>Traders</HI> were forbidden to fell any <HI>Amuni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion</HI> to any Indians
whatsoever; which those Indians say they cannot live without; yet
seeing themselves, as well as the <HI>Westward Indians</HI> have so ill improv∣ed,
that which they had before, there was little Reason why they should
<HI>quarrel</HI> with us, for selling no more:</P>
<P>Further also it is affirmed by some persons <HI>worthy of Credit,</HI> that for
divers years past have lived in those parts, that the Indians thereabouts,
need not have wanted <HI>powder</HI> or <HI>shot,</HI> only they wanted something
wherewith to <HI>cloak their malitious and barbarous practices</HI> of late com∣mitted
against us; but there being different opinions about this point,
we shall leave it at the present.</P>
<P>But this being premised in Reference to the pretended ground, or
occasion of the <HI>quarrel;</HI> It remains that the Effects thereof, be now
related.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Warre</HI> with <HI>Philip</HI> was well ended to the <HI>Southward,</HI> there
was a fresh <HI>Alarm</HI> sounded again to the <HI>Eastward,</HI> for on the <HI>eleventh
of August,</HI> 1676. The very day before Philips heart (that had harboured
so many <HI>misch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evous</HI> and <HI>Treacherous devices</HI> against the <HI>English</HI> was by
one of his own Company <HI>shot through</HI>) did a party of Indians beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their
<PB N="31" REF="000231_0190_0FA9ACA58476E220"/>
<HI>Outrages</HI> at <HI>Cásco</HI> in a most perfidious and treacherous manner, killing
and carrying away Captive to the number of thirty persons, and <HI>burn∣ing
their houses,</HI> amongst whom was the Family of one <HI>Antony Brack∣et</HI>
Inhabitant of <HI>Casco,</HI> who was thought to have been killed, but he
himself with his wise and one of his <HI>five Children</HI> carryed away Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tive
with a <HI>Negro,</HI> did happily make an escape from their <HI>bloody</HI> and
<HI>deceitful hands,</HI> In <HI>November</HI> next ensuing▪</P>
<P>The manner how <HI>Antony Bracket</HI> and his wife made their escape was
very <HI>remarkable,</HI> and therefore judged worthy to be inserted here al∣though
out of due place, the Indians that led them Captive, having
brought them to the <HI>North side of Casco Bay:</HI> News was brought to the
said Indians of the surprizal of <HI>Arowsick house in Kennib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck,</HI> withall
the store therein, which did so rejoyce them, that they made all haste to
share in the good things there to be had. Thus eager to be gone they
promised <HI>Bracket and his wife</HI> that they should have also a share there∣in
if they would make haste after them, bringing along a burthen alot∣ted
to each of them: The woman having a little before observed an
<HI>old Burchin Canoo</HI> lying by the <HI>water side,</HI> hoped it was an opportuni∣ty
Providence offered for their escape; whereupon she first prudent∣ly
asked of the Indians to let the <HI>Negro</HI> their own servant (as the same
time carryed Captive by them) help them to carry their <HI>burthens,</HI>
which was <HI>granted:</HI> then she begged of them a piece or two of meat,
which was not <HI>denyed them.</HI> Thus being furnished with help and
provision, the <HI>Indians</HI> leaving them thus behinde to come after with
their <HI>several burthens</HI> and a <HI>young Child;</HI> They could not but look up∣on
it as a <HI>nutus Divinus,</HI> to bid them, shift for themselves: the woman
also found a needle and thred in the house, where they stayd on that <HI>side
of the Bay,</HI> with which having mended the <HI>Canoo,</HI> they ventured to get
away; which prosperously succeeded: for in that <HI>old Canoo</HI> they cros∣sed
a water <HI>eight or nine miles broad,</HI> and when they came on the <HI>South
side of the Bay,</HI> they might have been in as much danger of other <HI>indi∣ans,</HI>
that had lately been about <HI>Black</HI> point, and had taken it; but they
were newly gone: So things on all sides thus concurring to help for∣ward
<HI>their Deliverance,</HI> they came <HI>safely</HI> to the <HI>Fat</HI> at <HI>Black</HI> point,
where also by special Providence they met with a <HI>Vessel</HI> bound for <HI>Pas∣cataqua,</HI>
that came in to that <HI>Harbour,</HI> but a few hours before they
came thither, by which means they <HI>Arrived safe in Pascataqua</HI> River,
soon after, all which Circumstances are very worthy to be noted.</P>
<P>Amongst those <HI>Indians</HI> that seized <HI>this Brackets Family,</HI> the chief
was one <HI>Simond,</HI> that <HI>newly</HI> or a little before had escaped out of <HI>Dover
<PB N="32" REF="000231_0191_0FA9ACA7B588D968"/>
Prison,</HI> where he was not over carefully lookt to, he had had his hand
in the <HI>murther</HI> of <HI>sundry English,</HI> as himself confessed; not missing
<HI>save one in the</HI> which he had <HI>discharged his gun</HI> upon, but because he
came in <HI>voluntarily,</HI> bringing in a <HI>woman and fire Children</HI> of the Eng∣lish,
who had been <HI>carryed Captive</HI> a little before, it was questioned,
whether his <HI>last act of submission</HI> might not <HI>ballance</HI> his former <HI>transgre∣ssion,</HI>
and therefore was he committed to that, not so <HI>secure a Prison,</HI>
till his Case might be further considered of,. It is said that coming to
that <HI>Brackets house</HI> over night he pulled forth a <HI>counterfieted</HI> pass, under
the hands of some publick <HI>Officers,</HI> or men <HI>intrusted with that Service,</HI>
making shew of all Friendship, but in the morning or soon after, he
pulled off his <HI>Vizour</HI> of a <HI>friend,</HI> and discovered what he was, yet <HI>grant∣ing</HI>
Life to this person and his Family, that did not, or could not resist,
which he denyed to some of the <HI>Neighbours</HI> not far off, who were many
of them <HI>killed by this bloody Villany,</HI> and his Partners.</P>
<P>There are some <HI>Circumstances</HI> in the Assault of <HI>Anthony Brackets</HI>
house very considerable, which, because it was the first <HI>Outrage</HI> com∣mitted
by the Indians in this their <HI>second Insurrection,</HI> 1676. are worthy
of a more particular remembring.</P>
<P>This Indian forementioned called <HI>Simond,</HI> after he had escape out
of <HI>Prison</HI> at <HI>Dover,</HI> came up to <HI>Gasco,</HI> and either in the end of <HI>Iuly,</HI> or
beginning of <HI>August,</HI> acquainted himself with this <HI>Antony Bracket,</HI>
and oft frequented his house: Upon the <HI>ninth of August,</HI> some of the
Indians having <HI>killed a Cow</HI> of his, the Indian <HI>Simond</HI> coming to his
house promised to bring the Indians to him that had <HI>killed his Cow</HI> In
the mean time they of the place sent two men to <HI>Major Walderns</HI> at
<HI>Dover,</HI> to complain of this injury done by the Indians; but before their
return, very <HI>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in the morning</HI> on the <HI>eleventh of August, Simond</HI> with
a party of <HI>Indians</HI> came to <HI>Antony Brackets</HI> house, and told him there
were the Indians that had <HI>killed his Cow;</HI> but as soon as they had said
that, the <HI>Indians</HI> went further into his house and took hold of all the
<HI>Guns</HI> they could see, <HI>Antony Bracket</HI> asked what was the meaning of
that, <HI>Simond</HI> presently replyed, that so it <HI>must be,</HI> asking him withal,
whether he had rather serve the <HI>Indians,</HI> or be <HI>slain by them, Antony
Bracket</HI> Answered, that if the Case were so, he would rather chuse to
<HI>serve them,</HI> then be <HI>killed by them: Simond</HI> replyed, that then they must
<HI>be bound,</HI> which presently was done. The said <HI>Bracket, his wife,</HI> and a
<HI>Negro</HI> were <HI>all bound</HI> by the Indians, <HI>his wife</HI> had a <HI>Brother,</HI> who offer∣ing
to resist was killed forthwith, the rest with <HI>five Children</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Two hours after one <HI>Pike</HI> that lived not far off, but knowing no
thing of all this, went up in a <HI>Canoo</HI> toward one <HI>Robert Corbins</HI> house▪
where he found one <HI>Humphry Durham,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Atwel</HI> at work
about their <HI>Hay,</HI> after a little stay, he left them intending to go up high∣er

running with all haste, which made him fear some mischief was in hand,
and presently a <HI>Volley of shot</HI> came against them, but the <HI>Bullets</HI> flying
over their <HI>heads,</HI> did them no hurt: presently <HI>Simond Indian</HI> appear∣ed,
and called them to <HI>come a shore;</HI> but they liked not his <HI>Courtesy,</HI>
but presently turning their <HI>Canoo</HI> into the stream got out of the reach
of their G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, hasting down to his <HI>own house</HI> with all speed; when he
came near to <HI>his house,</HI> he called to the <HI>People</HI> to make <HI>hast away,</HI> to∣wards
the <HI>Garrison house,</HI> and bid the rest <HI>look to themselves,</HI> and <HI>fire</HI> up∣on
the Indians, that were coming against them: In the mean while, <HI>the
Indians</HI> passing from <HI>Anthony Brackets</HI> to <HI>Corbins,</HI> killed <HI>Corbin him∣self,</HI>
with <HI>Humphry Durham,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Atwel</HI> forementioned:
Then passing on to <HI>other houses,</HI> carryed away some of them <HI>Captive,</HI>
and <HI>killed</HI> others. At one of the next houses, the <HI>women and Children</HI>
got off into the <HI>water</HI> by a <HI>Canoo;</HI> but one <HI>Iames Ross,</HI> his <HI>wife and

<P>In another side of the Town, three were as they were going to <HI>reap

met with <HI>Iohn Mount-joy</HI> and one <HI>Wakely,</HI> to whom they told what had

made him conclude their Owners <HI>were killed,</HI> which was a <HI>sufficient
warning</HI> to him likewise to <HI>fly for his Life,</HI> which he did to the <HI>same
Island.</HI> After they had sundry of them escaped thither, some of them
remembred that they had <HI>left powder</HI> behind them in <HI>one or two places;</HI>
whereupon they resolved to venture a party of them in the night, partly
to <HI>prvent the Indians</HI> from having any Advantage thereo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and partly
for their <HI>own defence if occasion should be;</HI> Their Attempt succeeded well,
for they brought away a <HI>barrel of powder</HI> from one <HI>Willes his house,</HI> and
likewise a <HI>considerable quantity</HI> out of a <HI>Chest</HI> in a <HI>Store house,</HI> where
the Indians had been <HI>ransacking,</HI> &amp; had taken things out of the <HI>other end</HI>
of the <HI>Chest,</HI> yet <HI>overlooked the Powder:</HI> In this surprizal of the <HI>Plan∣tation</HI>
in <HI>Casco Bay,</HI> called <HI>Falmouth,</HI> there were <HI>thirty four persons kil∣led
and carryed Captive.</HI></P>
<P>That this was not a casual Attempt, but a <HI>designed plot,</HI> it will ap∣pear,
in that just about the very same time, the Indians at <HI>Kennibeck,</HI>
made the <HI>like Insurrection,</HI> whereby it is concluded, either that the In∣dians
which escaped from <HI>Dover,</HI> stirred them up thereunto, or else
that the said Indians finding them in a <HI>disposition tending that way,</HI> by
reason of some inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries done them that dwell farther <HI>Northward,</HI> they
offered their Service to <HI>help forward</HI> the designe.</P>
<P>It is to be noted here, that the Indians about <HI>Kennibeck</HI> were per∣swaded
to continue their former <HI>amity</HI> with the <HI>English</HI> notwithstand∣ing
the report of <HI>Philips rising that year before,</HI> and the <HI>Outrages</HI> com∣mitted
the <HI>last Autumne,</HI> and <HI>winter</HI> following, yet which is more,
they had lately <HI>renewed their League</HI> with the <HI>English</HI> in those parts, al∣though
they had often complained to those of <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> of the inju∣ry
they suffered, in the withholding from them the <HI>Trade of Powder,</HI>
and <HI>shot,</HI> without which they said they cannot <HI>subsist,</HI> and for want of
which it is alleadged by themselves, that some of them <HI>perished</HI> the last
<HI>Winter.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Quarrel</HI> of late <HI>fallen out</HI> betwixt the <HI>English,</HI> and the Indi∣ans
about <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> and <HI>Eastward</HI> thereof, being a matter of <HI>great

that <HI>publisheth things</HI> of this nature, to to do the <HI>right of an Historian</HI> to

Information was received from a <HI>prudent person,</HI> an <HI>Eye</HI> and <HI>Ear wit∣ness</HI>
of all that hapned amongst the said Indians, both the <HI>former</HI> and

Transactions</HI> then some others, therefore may the more heed be given
thereto. Mention is already made of what hapned in <HI>September,</HI> 1675.
to the Company belonging to <HI>a Sloop, and two other Boats,</HI> that went
up <HI>Casco Bay</HI> to gather Indian Corn; Upon that Accident it is said,
divers Indians on the <HI>East side of Kennibeck River</HI> repayred to their <HI>Fort</HI>
at <HI>Totonnock</HI> (a place up higher into the Country beyond <HI>Kennibeck</HI> and
<HI>Shipscot River</HI>) where was an <HI>English trading house.</HI> And the Indians
<HI>Eastward</HI> of the said <HI>River,</HI> had as yet done no harm to any of the
<HI>English,</HI> yet did <HI>Captain Sylvanus Davis</HI> Agent for <HI>Major Clarke</HI> and
<HI>Captain Lake</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> upon these <HI>Overtures</HI> think it fit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etch down
the <HI>Powder and Shot</HI> with other goods from the said <HI>Trading house,</HI> tel∣ling
the Indians, by the Messenger sent up, he would have them come
down and live below <HI>in that River,</HI> to take off <HI>Iealousies,</HI> and that he
would then supply rhem with what was needful.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Messenger</HI> told them, in Case they would not come down,
and deliver np their Arms, the <HI>English</HI> would kill them. <HI>He that se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣deth

<HI>dammage</HI> that side of the Country hath been made to <HI>drink thereby,</HI> is
not easy to <HI>recount;</HI> for upon this <HI>Threatning Message</HI> the Indians <HI>for∣sook</HI>
their <HI>Fort</HI> presently, and went <HI>Eastward,</HI> and sent abroad to <HI>Iohns
River</HI> and to the <HI>Sea side</HI> to get all the Indians they could together to
come up <HI>Penobscot River.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Gentleman</HI> who at that time lived at <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> a kind of <HI>Su∣pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tendent</HI>
over the Affairs of that place, considering the <HI>sad state</HI> things
were running into, laboured to <HI>obtain a Parly</HI> with the said Indians, or
some of them, which after much trouble and cost, he did accomplish:
But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the mean time, such was the <HI>violence</HI> used by some <HI>refractory
English</HI> in those parts, that they could scarce be <HI>restrained</HI> from <HI>offering
vio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce</HI> to the <HI>persons</HI> he <HI>sent up</HI> as <HI>Messengers,</HI> or others that <HI>lived quietly

<HI>Powder and Shot,</HI> and said they would kill any Indian they met; others
at <HI>Monhiggan</HI> offered <HI>five pound</HI> for every Indian that should be
brought, yet would not these persons that were <HI>so violent</HI> against the In∣dians
in their discourse, be perswaded upon any Terms, then, or after∣ward,
to <HI>go out to fight against</HI> the Indians in an <HI>orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly way;</HI> as ap∣peared
both by their Security in not <HI>standing better upon their gua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI>
and by their <HI>sudden flight</HI> afterward, running away like a <HI>Flock of
Sheep,</HI> at the <HI>barking</HI> of any <HI>little dog:</HI> Things being in this <HI>posture,</HI>
what could be expected but a <HI>present warr</HI> with the Indians, although as
it seems, there were few or nonel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke to be found, willing to undertake
it, or fit to manage it in those parts. How ever, the person aforesaid,
understand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, the <HI>General Court at Boston</HI> had appointed a <HI>Counsel of
Warr</HI> at <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> applyed himself to them, laying before them the
<HI>desperate state</HI> things were falling into; whereupon they issued our war∣rants
to restrain all manner of persons from medling with the Indians
without farther order, which within few dayes should be had. In the
mean time the <HI>Sachems</HI> of the Indians meet at <HI>Pemmaquid;</HI> where, af∣ter
many complaints made of the <HI>hard dealing</HI> of the English in <HI>Kenni∣beck
River,</HI> they came to <HI>Tearms of Peace,</HI> promising to keep true
Friendsh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p with the <HI>English;</HI> and to hinder the <HI>Amonoscoggan</HI> Indians
from medling with the English, if by any means they could, and also
to <HI>return peaceably</HI> in the Spring of the year. This <HI>Gentleman</HI> afore∣said,
having a long time waited to go to <HI>Boston;</HI> was willing to take
the opportunity of the <HI>pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Winter,</HI> hoping things were now pretty
well setled in those parts <HI>betwixt the Indians and the English;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound
soon after, that he was <HI>cited thither</HI> to Answer some Complaints (though
made without ground) for selling <HI>Powder &amp; Shot</HI> to the Indians contrary
to Order.</P>
<P>But those false opinions being easily blown away by his own appea∣rance
at <HI>Boston,</HI> and so having dispatched his occasions there, he return∣ed
before the winter was over to <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> where hearing of a <HI>Ves∣sel</HI>
that intended to take Indians in those parts, and carry them away to
a <HI>market,</HI> the which he had many <HI>strong Reasons</HI> to <HI>believe,</HI> (it being
no hard matter to surprize many such, that suspecting by <HI>fraud,</HI> would
easily be enticed <HI>aboard a Vessel</HI> to trade, or may be to <HI>drink Liquor</HI>)
sent both the <HI>Master and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpany,</HI> if they had any such intent to for∣bear,
seeing those Indians were at <HI>peace with us,</HI> and likewise to the Indi∣ans,
to <HI>inform them</HI> of such a Vessel, and to <HI>beware thereof,</HI> but yet it
seems the <HI>Master and Company</HI> took several Indians <HI>Eastward,</HI> who were
also at peace with us, <HI>and</HI> to our <HI>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat sorrow</HI> shipt them <HI>aboard for a

<P><PB N="37" REF="000231_0196_0FA9ACAB7443A380"/>
The winter being now over, the forenamed <HI>Agent of Pemmaquid,</HI>
went to a meeting of the Indians <HI>Eastward,</HI> to <HI>perswade them,</HI> of the
Countryes <HI>willingness</HI> to continue a <HI>peace with them.</HI> They seemed
very joyful thereat, and in the Spring brought some <HI>presents</HI> to <HI>confirm
the Peace,</HI> and to that en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> also delivered up an <HI>English Captive B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> to
those of <HI>Kennibeck.</HI> But when the Summer came on, that the said In∣dians
had liberty to <HI>travail up and down</HI> the Country to visit their
Friends as they used to do; they missed those their <HI>Friends</HI> who had in
the winter <HI>perfidiously been carryed away,</HI> and as is related, they fell in∣to
a Page against the <HI>English,</HI> making Complaint thereof to the <HI>said
Agent, Mr. Earthy, Mr. Richard Oliver,</HI> and others: They were told
means should be used for bringing them <HI>back again,</HI> which had been so
<HI>Transported,</HI> those to whom the Complaint was made, did scarce be∣lieve
it to be true, as not having <HI>heard thereof</HI> from any <HI>other hand,</HI> and
probably hoping none, especially after solemn warning, would deal so
<HI>perfidiously with Heathen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> to lay such a <HI>stumbling block</HI> before them.</P>
<P>The Indians being <HI>certain</HI> of the <HI>thing done,</HI> could not be <HI>easily paci∣fied,</HI>
being likewise incensed against the <HI>English,</HI> for <HI>withholding</HI> the
Trade of <HI>Powder and Shot</HI> the <HI>last winter,</HI> saying, they were <HI>frighted
from their Corn</HI> the last year by the People about <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> so as many
of them <HI>dyed</HI> in the following <HI>winter</HI> for want of <HI>Powder and Shot,</HI>
wherewith to <HI>kill V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nison and Foul;</HI> Adding withal, that if the Eng∣lish
were their Friends as they pretended, they would not suffer them
to dye, for want thereof: However, the <HI>said Agent</HI> making the best

to that end promised them, that if they could meet with any of the

would be a <HI>general Peace</HI> with all the Indians <HI>Eastward of Pascataqua,</HI>
which the Indians that were present at this discourse, seemed <HI>very joy∣ful
at:</HI> yet still by one <HI>fatal Accident</HI> or other, <HI>jealousies</HI> still seemed to
<HI>increase in their minds,</HI> or else the <HI>former injuries</HI> began to <HI>boyle a fresh</HI> in
their Spirits, as not being easily <HI>digested,</HI> what ever had been <HI>said,</HI> or <HI>done</HI>
to <HI>allay</HI> the <HI>offensiveness thereof.</HI> Soon after comes a <HI>Post</HI> from <HI>Toton∣nock,</HI>
to desire him to repair thither according to his promise, where
they told him he should meet with <HI>Squando,</HI> and divers <HI>Amonoscog∣gan
Sachems,</HI> and that <HI>Mng</HI> was sent <HI>Post</HI> to fetch the said <HI>Squando:</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="000231_0197_0FA9ACAFA6D033F8"/>
This Gentleman mindful of his promise, went with the <HI>Post</HI> to <HI>Kenni∣beck,</HI>
and finding <HI>Captain Lake</HI> at his house in <HI>Arowsick;</HI> It was judged
meet, that <HI>Captain Sylves<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Davis</HI> should go along with him, with in∣structions
from the <HI>Counsel</HI> then sitting in <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> how to carry on
their <HI>Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</HI> After they had gone part of their way towards <HI>Toton∣nock,</HI>
they came to an English house, where they were told, what great
<HI>jealousies of deceipt</HI> in the Indians were upon their Spirits, from what
they had heard of <HI>Muggs</HI> and <HI>Tarumkin,</HI> an <HI>Amonoscoggan Sachem:</HI>
going farther to a place called <HI>Kedonu-Cook,</HI> they met with Indians,
who were very <HI>shye of telling</HI> them any thing, which added to the <HI>for∣mer
Intimation,</HI> greatly <HI>increased their fears:</HI> but being resolved of their
voyage, they went onward still in <HI>their way,</HI> yet falling short of the
place <HI>on purpose,</HI> that they might <HI>finish their business</HI> with them the <HI>next
day:</HI> when they came to their <HI>Fort,</HI> they were first <HI>saluted with a Volley
of Shot,</HI> then brought into a <HI>Wigwam</HI> where their <HI>Sachems</HI> were: <HI>Ma∣dockawando</HI>
sate as chief, who now stiles himself their <HI>Minister:</HI> Being
set in Councel, they made <HI>Assiminasqua</HI> their speaker; whose <HI>Adopted
Son</HI> was the said <HI>Madochewando:</HI> He told them it was not <HI>their Cu∣stome,</HI>
if any came as <HI>Messengers</HI> to treat with them, <HI>to seize</HI> upon
<HI>their persons,</HI> as sometimes the <HI>Mohawks</HI> did with such as had been sent
to them: <HI>Captain Davis</HI> and the other <HI>Gentleman</HI> told them, therein
they <HI>dealt like men:</HI> Answer was presently made them; you did <HI>other∣wise
by our men,</HI> when <HI>fourteen</HI> came to <HI>treat</HI> with you: And set a
<HI>Guard over them,</HI> and took away <HI>their Guns:</HI> And not only so, but a
second time you <HI>required our Guns,</HI> and demanded us to <HI>come down</HI> unto
you, or else you would kill us, which was the Cause of our <HI>leaving</HI> both
<HI>our Fort,</HI> and <HI>our Corn</HI> to our great loss.</P>
<P>It was without doubt no small trouble to their minds, in a Treaty
with these <HI>Pagans, Haec dieipot uisse, &amp; non potuisse refelli:</HI> Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to put
the <HI>best Construction</HI> might be, on such <HI>Irregular actions,</HI> which could
not well be <HI>justifyed.</HI> They told them, the persons who had so done,
were not within the Limits of their Government, and therefore though
they could not <HI>call them</HI> to an <HI>account</HI> for <HI>so acting,</HI> yet they did <HI>utter∣ly
disallow</HI> thereof: Adding farther, as soon as we understood thereof
we sent for you to <HI>Pemmaquid,</HI> and Treated you kindly, and kept you,
as you know, from the violence of the English; The Indians <HI>Replyed,</HI>
we do but inform you, aud will Treat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the <HI>Afternoon.</HI> But
when the <HI>Afternoon came,</HI> our <HI>Two Messengers</HI> told them, their busi∣ness
was to Treat with the <HI>Amonoscoggan Sachems,</HI> and that they were
forry, <HI>Squando</HI> was not there: Then having confirmed their Peace with
<PB N="39" REF="000231_0198_0FA9ACB0F9853458"/>
those <HI>Eastward Indians,</HI> they intrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the <HI>Amonoscoggan</HI> men to speak,
who likewise urged <HI>Tarumkin,</HI> the chief <HI>Amonoscoggan Sachem</HI> to speak,
who after <HI>some pauze,</HI> said he had been to the <HI>Westward,</HI> where
he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad found many Indians <HI>unwilling for Peace.</HI> but says he, I found
<HI>three Sachems</HI> (whom he named, though those he spake to knew them
not) willing to <HI>have peace;</HI> And for my own part, I am <HI>willing for
peace,</HI> and gave them <HI>his hand</HI> with Protestation of his continuing
in Friendship, so did <HI>seven or eight more</HI> of the <HI>Amonoscoggan</HI>
men; whose Names they took, of whom <HI>Mug</HI> and <HI>Robin Hoods</HI>
Son were two. After this <HI>Madochewando</HI> asked them what they
should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o for Powder and Shot, when they had eaten up their In∣dian
Corn, what they should do for the <HI>Winter,</HI> for their hunt∣ing
Voyages? asking withal, whether they would have them dy,
or leave their Country, and go all over to the <HI>French.</HI> Our Mes∣sengers
told him, they would do what they could with the <HI>Gover∣nour,</HI>
some might be <HI>allowed them</HI> for <HI>Necessity:</HI> He said they had
waited long already, and therefore would have them now say yea, or
nay, whether they should have <HI>powder as formerly, or not?</HI> Our Mes∣sengers
then <HI>Replyed,</HI> you your selves say, many of the <HI>Western</HI> In∣dians
would not have Peace, And therefore if we sell you <HI>powder,</HI> and
you give it to the <HI>Western</HI> men, what do we but cut our own Throats?
Adding further, It is not in our power <HI>without leave,</HI> if you should <HI>wait
ten year</HI> more, to let you have <HI>powder,</HI> at which words they seemed
much to be offended.</P>
<P>But yet the next day they resolved to go down with them, &amp; to speak
with the Western men, thereby, if it might be, to stop their farther pro∣ceeding.</P>
<P>So going down with them <HI>the next day,</HI> they met with some Indians
who had got <HI>strong Liquor,</HI> with whom they fell a drinking: Our
Messengers <HI>stayed at two places</HI> for them, and finding that still they tar∣ryed
behinde, not knowing what <HI>farther to do,</HI> they went home, it be∣ing
the <HI>sixth day</HI> of the week. But the next night save one, news came
to <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> that the Indians had killed divers English in <HI>Casco,</HI> al∣though

Davis</HI> set out one Sentinel the next night. The rest, (such was <HI>their

<HI>Laish</HI> surprized, thus might it be said, <HI>Invadunt Aedem somno (si non)

<P>Upon the <HI>thirteenth of August,</HI> 1676. several Indians repaired in the

Evening to the house of one Mr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> an ancient Inhabitant, and
Trader with the Iudians up <HI>Kennibeck River,</HI> His <HI>daughter</HI> or a <HI>maid</HI>
that was <HI>servant</HI> in the house, either <HI>naturally afraid</HI> of the <HI>Natives,</HI>
or else upon something <HI>she observed</HI> in their <HI>Countenance,</HI> or <HI>Carriage,</HI>
manifested so <HI>much fear,</HI> as made her <HI>run out of the house</HI> to hide her
self in some <HI>place abroad;</HI> The Indians perceiving it, the more to <HI>dis∣semble
their Treach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry,</HI> ran after her, and brought her into the house,
telling her (although they could not perswade her so to believe) that
there was no Reason to be <HI>afraid</HI> of them: presently after more of the
<HI>Barbarous Villains</HI> coming into the house, she grew <HI>more afraid then
before,</HI> being now more strongly perswaded that they came on <HI>purpose</HI> to
<HI>kill or surprize</HI> those in the Family, whereupon she suddenly made <HI>an
escape</HI> out of the house, and presently passed into a <HI>Field of Indian Corn,</HI>
whereby she might the better avoid the <HI>danger of any pursuer,</HI> and so
ran cross over the land that night <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>twelve miles,</HI> to give them notice
that lived at <HI>Shipscot River,</HI> It is said that after she got out, she heard
<HI>a noyze</HI> in the house, as if they were <HI>fighting or scuffling within doors;</HI> but
she did not count it wisdom to go back to see what the <HI>matter was,</HI> know∣ing

was <HI>more versed</HI> in the Trade of the Indians) might think of them. Those
of <HI>Shipscot</HI> taking this <HI>warning</HI> escaped away as soon as they could leav∣ing
their <HI>Cattle and their dwellings</HI> as a <HI>Prey</HI> to the Indians. What
besel <HI>Master Hammond and his Family</HI> is not yet certainly known:
Reports pass up and down, that some who came down the River after∣wards,
saw <HI>some of the dead stripped</HI> upon the <HI>Banke</HI> of the <HI>River,</HI> which
makes us fear the worst, concerning all the rest; for certainly the <HI>whole

<HI>followed him in,</HI> at the <HI>Fort gate,</HI> (as some report) while others of

upon a sudden <HI>surprizal,</HI> it is hard to <HI>buoy</HI> them up, to make

was <HI>strangly preserved;</HI> Providence <HI>directing</HI> him to go into <HI>the Cleft of

he found a <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo,</HI> whereby he <HI>escaped away</HI> with his Life, much adoe.

<P>Upon the Report of this <HI>sad disaster,</HI> all the Plantations of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>

<P>On the <HI>second day at night be</HI> a <HI>Post</HI> was sent to <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> to inform

to go to the Island called <HI>Monhiggon,</HI> having secured the <HI>best of their
goods,</HI> but the wind taking them short, they were forced to turn into
<HI>Damarils Cove,</HI> where they found Mr. <HI>Wiswal,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cot,</HI> there
they laboured <HI>two dayes</HI> to settle a <HI>Garrison;</HI> But partly by the <HI>muti∣nousness</HI>
of the People, and partly by the <HI>want of Provision</HI> nothing could
be done to <HI>secure the Island,</HI> so that it was presently deserted: From
thence they went to <HI>Monhiggon,</HI> resolving ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to tarry till they
heard from <HI>Boston,</HI> from whence Mr. <HI>Colicot,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wel</HI> promi∣sed
to do their <HI>utmost endeavour</HI> to send help. There they setled <HI>three
Guards,</HI> and appointed <HI>five and twenty to watch every night,</HI> not know∣ing
but that the Indians might come every hour. But continuing there
a <HI>Fortnight,</HI> and finding no Relief like to come; and seeing all the Coun∣try
<HI>burned round about.</HI> (For after they had gotten all that could be

then considering what was best to be done, they found no <HI>Boats</HI> could
be <HI>sent to sea</HI> for fear of <HI>weakning the Island,</HI> and that most of those that
were upon the Island, were <HI>Strangers, Coasters,</HI> and such as came from

considered, that if they should tarry there, and spend all their
<HI>Provision,</HI> and neither <HI>be able</HI> to go <HI>to Sea,</HI> nor yet <HI>to live,</HI> or <HI>be safe a
shore</HI> for want of help, it were better for them to remove, while they
had something <HI>left to live upon,</HI> and seek imployment else where; so by

<PB N="44" REF="000231_0203_0FA9ACB5F7070940"/>
<HI>had saved</HI> of their goods to <HI>some place of Security,</HI> so they took the <HI>first
opportunity</HI> to <HI>set sayle,</HI> some for <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> some for <HI>Boston,</HI> and some
for <HI>Sale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> at one of which <HI>three places</HI> they all <HI>safely arrived.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus escaped at first as <HI>Lot out of Sodom,</HI> but not counting
themselves safe in that <HI>Zoar,</HI> where for a little while they made shift to
<HI>bids their heads,</HI> till they might escape to some <HI>surer place,</HI> there
waiting for <HI>better times,</HI> when they may with <HI>peace and quietness</HI> re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn
to their former habitations, or <HI>seek some other</HI> else where.</P>
<P>When the <HI>foresaid Exploits</HI> were done by the Indians in and about
<HI>Casco Bay,</HI> several of the <HI>English</HI> removed to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewels Island,</HI> where they
hoped to be <HI>more secure</HI> from the Indians, but their barbarous Enemy
finding so <HI>little Resistance</HI> made against them <HI>on the main Land,</HI> a con∣siderable
party of them came <HI>with their Canoos</HI> to destroy that <HI>Island</HI>
also, about <HI>three weeks</HI> after the forementioned mischiefs.</P>
<P>There was a fortifyed house upon the <HI>said Island,</HI> where the English
that either kept upon the Island, or repayred thither, hoped to have
<HI>secured themselves.</HI> But <HI>at that time</HI> when the Indians assaulted the
place, many of the <HI>English were absent,</HI> sew left in <HI>the Garrison,</HI> but
<HI>women and Children;</HI> some were gone to <HI>other places</HI> to fetch <HI>Indian
Corn,</HI> others were <HI>in a Boat</HI> imployed about <HI>Fish,</HI> amongst whom was

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat <HI>sad Spectacle,</HI> but was <HI>not able</HI> to afford <HI>any Relief</HI> either to <HI>wife
or Children;</HI> although <HI>one of the Children</HI> espying his <HI>Father in his boat,</HI>
ran into the <HI>water,</HI> calling out <HI>for help,</HI> but an Indian <HI>ran after him</HI> to
catch him up; the <HI>poor man</HI> in a great <HI>Agony</HI> being within <HI>half shot,</HI>
was about to have <HI>fired upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Indian,</HI> but then fearing he might

<P>It is said that some of the Indians were <HI>killed by them</HI> in the <HI>Garrison:</HI> They speak of <HI>a Lord</HI> that at one shot <HI>killed two or three</HI> of them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<HI>Guns</HI> were found afterwards under the <HI>Fort,</HI> which were supposed to
have belonged to some of the Indians <HI>that were killed.</HI> Some that were
<HI>abroad</HI> when the <HI>Fort</HI> was assaulted, <HI>desperately broke in</HI> through the In∣dians,
whereby at the last, many <HI>of the People were preserved:</HI> some
<HI>flying away</HI> from <HI>Iewels Island</HI> in a <HI>Canoo</HI> toward <HI>Richmonds Island,</HI> met
with a <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch,</HI> to which they made known the distress the People were
in, who thereupon <HI>went to the place,</HI> and took in all the People they found

there, and carryed <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem off</HI> to a place of <HI>more safety.</HI> Yet were there
several persons said to be <HI>killed and carryed away</HI> at that time <HI>viz. three
men,</HI> who were known to be killed, <HI>two women and two Children,</HI> that
are supposed to be yet alive, though in the <HI>Enemies power.</HI></P>
<P>From thence they went to <HI>Spurwinks,</HI> where they <HI>assaulted</HI> one place
or more, and killed <HI>one man,</HI> wounded <HI>another,</HI> and carryed another
<HI>away Captive:</HI> Amongst them that were in danger of surprizal, one that
<HI>could not run,</HI> hid himself in a <HI>garden of Cabbages</HI> so as he was not found,
yet was very <HI>near them,</HI> for he over heard <HI>several questions,</HI> they asked
him they took; by which means he was the better enabled afterward to
prevent the danger <HI>two more</HI> were coming into, for the <HI>poor Fellow</HI>
that they had taken, told them, that one <HI>Shenda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> with another man
<HI>were to come that way</HI> by and by; whereupon this man that had hid
himself, meeting that <HI>She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dal</HI> and the other <HI>man</HI> gave them notice of
the danger, whereby they were <HI>delivered</HI> out of the <HI>snare,</HI> for that
time; not long after one of them, <HI>viz Mr: Shendal</HI> fell into their
hands as shall be declared afterwards. Within a while after, or much a∣bout
that same time, another <HI>sad Accident</HI> befel <HI>six or seven</HI> of them
that belonged to <HI>Casco.</HI> For upon the <HI>twenty third of September</HI> some

Service</HI> (one Reason of which was to prevent their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ragling they
being persons that belonged to those parts about <HI>Casco</HI>) were over
desirous to save some of their <HI>Provision,</HI> to which end they first made
their Address to <HI>Captain Hatborne,</HI> (under whom they were <HI>ordered to
serve</HI>) desiring they might <HI>be released;</HI> the <HI>Captain</HI> told them he could
not do it, but desired them to <HI>have patience</HI> for a while, they told him,
that <HI>they must</HI> and <HI>would go,</HI> else their Families must <HI>starve at home:</HI>
The <HI>Captain</HI> told them further of the danger, and bid them not stir at
their peril: However they would go, and soon after went to <HI>Mount∣joyes
Island</HI> to fetch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sheep, where they landed <HI>seven men;</HI> but the Indi∣ans
presently set upon them, they presently be took themselves to the
<HI>Ruines of a stone house,</HI> where they defended themselves as long as
they could; but at last they were all <HI>destroyed</HI> either with <HI>stones cast in

the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st it was hoped his <HI>wounds</HI> were not <HI>mortal,</HI> yet soon after <HI>dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d

more active then any man in those parts against the Indians, but at the
last he lost <HI>his own Life</HI> amongst them, in this <HI>too desperate</HI> an Adventure.</P>
<P>The Indians growing more hold by these Attempts in those remote
places, drew down n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arer towards <HI>Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at aqua,</HI> for not long after a party
<PB N="46" REF="000231_0205_0FA9ACB7741A8BF8"/>
of them came upon <HI>Cape Nidduck,</HI> where they <HI>killed and carryed away</HI>
all the Inhabitants of a few scattering houses, to the number of <HI>seven in
all,</HI> and such was their <HI>Salvage Cruelty exercised</HI> in this place, as is not
usually heard of, for having <HI>dashed out the brains of a poor woman thatgave suck,</HI> they <HI>nayled the young Child</HI> to the <HI>dead body of its mother,</HI>
which was found sucking in that <HI>rueful manner,</HI> when the People
came to the place. The day before a man and his wife were killed by
them at <HI>Wells,</HI> and two men more soon after. On the <HI>twelfth of October</HI>
following near <HI>an hundred</HI> of the Indians made an Assault upon <HI>Black
point,</HI> all the Inhabitants being gathered into <HI>one fortifyed place</HI> upon that
point, which a few hands might have de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended against all the Indians on
that <HI>side of the Country.</HI> But as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems, one called <HI>Mugg</HI> was the
Leader of the Indians; one that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad from a <HI>Child</HI> been well acquaint∣ed
with the <HI>English,</HI> and had lived some years in English Families, who
though a <HI>cunning Fellow,</HI> and had prevailed much in his Attempts, yet
at this time shewed more Courtesy to the <HI>English,</HI> then according to for∣mer
Outrages could be expected from any of those <HI>barbarous miscre∣ants;</HI> and was willing to make offer of a <HI>Treaty</HI> to <HI>Mr. Iosselin,</HI> chief of
the Garrison, to whom the said <HI>Mugg</HI> promised liberty for all that
were there, to depart with their goods upon the <HI>surrender of the place:</HI>
The said <HI>Iosselin</HI> reports, that when he came back from his treating with
<HI>Mugg,</HI> that all the People were fled away out of the Garrison, having
carryed away their goods by water before his return, in so much that
having none but his <HI>Household Servants</HI> to stand by him, he was capa∣ble
to make no Resistance, and so <HI>surrendred.</HI></P>
<P>When People have once <HI>been frighted</HI> with Reports and Sense of
danger, they are ready to <HI>fly away</HI> like a <HI>Hart</HI> before the <HI>Hunter</HI> or
his <HI>Hounds,</HI> one of the Inhabitants of the place affirmed he saw <HI>an
hundred and fifty</HI> Indians, which was more by <HI>an hundred</HI> than any body
else ever saw near the Fort. But when a place is <HI>designed to Ruine,</HI>
every thing they take in hand shall tend thay way.</P>
<P>The loss of <HI>Black point</HI> was accompanyed with another sad Acci∣dent,
that <HI>fell out</HI> about the same time at <HI>Richmonds Island.</HI> For young
<HI>Mr. Fryer</HI> with some others at <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> to whom it seemed grie∣vous
that the Indians should make <HI>all that Spoyle</HI> in every place in those
<HI>farther Plantations,</HI> ventured upon the great Importunity of <HI>Mr. Shandal,</HI>
with a <HI>Kotch</HI> to try what they could save of such things that the Indi∣ans
had left. But things were so ordered, that before they had <HI>loden
their Ketch,</HI> coming too near the <HI>Stage head,</HI> they presently found them∣selves
in danger of a <HI>surprizal,</HI> for part of their Company being a

shore, were <HI>seized</HI> by the Indians, or in <HI>danger thereof,</HI> whom they were
not willing to leave behind; and besides the wind blowing in hard upon
them, they could not <HI>get out of the Harbour,</HI> but were forced to abide
the danger of an Assault. The Indians getting many of them into the
<HI>stage head</HI> annoyed them so fast with their <HI>shot,</HI> that not a man of
them was able to look <HI>above deck,</HI> but he was in danger of being <HI>shot
down,</HI> amongst the rest <HI>Mr. Iames Fryer</HI> venturing too much <HI>in view</HI>
of the Enemy received <HI>a wound</HI> in his <HI>knee,</HI> which <HI>appeared</HI> not <HI>dan∣gerous</HI>
at the first, but for want of <HI>better looking to,</HI> then could be found
amongst that <HI>black Regiment,</HI> into whose hands he soon after fell;
It <HI>proved Mortal unto him,</HI> within a <HI>few dayes after:</HI> he being by a
<HI>strange Accident</HI> brought home to his <HI>Fathers house</HI> at the great <HI>Island</HI>
in <HI>Pascataqua. Mr. Fryer</HI> being thus wounded, the rest of the Com∣pany
defended thems<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves for a while with much C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rage and Reso∣lution,
till they were brought to the sad choice of <HI>falling into the hands</HI>
of one of these three bad Masters, the Fire, the water, or the <HI>Barbarous
Heathen,</HI> to whom at last they thought it best to yield, in hope of liber∣ty
afterwards, at least of lengthning out their lives a little longer, for
the Indians had <HI>manned</HI> cut a <HI>Canoo</HI> with several hands to <HI>cut their Ca∣ble,</HI>
and others stood ready within the defence of the stage head to fire
upon any one that stirred in the <HI>Ketch,</HI> by which means the Vessel after
the Cable was cut soon drave a shore; and then was it threatned to be
presently burned, if they did not all yield, to which they all at last
consented.</P>
<P>The Indians how barbarous soever in their own nature, yet civilly
intreated their Prisoners, and upon farther discourse sent one or two of
them to <HI>Pasca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aqua,</HI> to give them there an opportunity <HI>to Ranso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>
their Friends. The persons sent home to procure a Ransome, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
return with such a quantity of goods as the Indians had desired; by such
a precise time: but they that brought the things for their Ransome,
coming a day or two before the time, when those that sent them we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
gone up the River at <HI>Black point,</HI> and not returned: Some other Indi∣ans
waiting for such an opportunity <HI>seized the goods,</HI> at least that pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
which they most desired, and through mistake, killing one of the three
men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat brought them, dismissed the other two, without return of the
Prisoners as was expected.</P>
<P>As to what hapned afterward, we are yet much in the dark, and for
the present can write but by guess: for within a few dayes
after the return of <HI>Mr. Shendal,</HI> and the other man that went to
carry the Ransome, before <HI>November 1. Mugg</HI> himself came to <HI>Pasca∣taqua,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="000231_0207_0FA9ACBB4D955F08"/>
bringing <HI>Mr. Iames Fryer,</HI> who soon af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er dyed of his wound,
one of the Prisoners along with him complain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>without his
knowledge</HI> some of the Indians had seized what was se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t for the <HI>Ransome</HI>
of the rest, promising upon <HI>his Faith,</HI> that he would make good his word
for the sending home all the Prisoners, and offered al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the Name of
the other Indians, to confirm a <HI>new Peace</HI> with the <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>glish</HI> for the fu∣ture:
The <HI>Major General</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets Colony</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at <HI>Pas∣cataqua,</HI>
but not willing to <HI>Transact</HI> a matter of that nature and mo∣ment
by his <HI>sole Authority,</HI> ordered the said <HI>Mugg</HI> (supposed to be the
<HI>chief Leader</HI> of the Indians) to be carryed down to <HI>Boston</HI> to <HI>the Go∣vernour
and Councel there,</HI> to conclude the business, with whom he soon
after agreed upon a <HI>firm Peace</HI> with the <HI>English</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> in
the Name of <HI>Madockawando,</HI> the chief of all the Indians <HI>in the Eastern
parts</HI> about <HI>Peno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scot,</HI> engaging also to remain himself, as <HI>hostage</HI> aboard
the <HI>Vessel</HI> (in which he was sent home from <HI>Boston November the 21st.
following</HI>) until the Prisoners (which are said to be <HI>fifty or sixty</HI> that they
have still in their hands) be sent home, and the rest of the <HI>Articles</HI> per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed.
The Issue of which we as yet <HI>wait to hear</HI> in Gods good time,
this <HI>12th. of December</HI> following, 1676. when they there have made an
end of the reckoning, 'tis hoped we may have our right again.</P>
<P>There are two <HI>principal Actors</HI> amongst the Indians that have all a∣long
promoted these designes amongst them, one named <HI>Squando, Sa∣gamore
of Saco,</HI> and the forementioned <HI>Madockawando,</HI> the chief Com∣mander
of the Indians <HI>Eastward</HI> about <HI>Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bscot,</HI> who are said to be, by
them that know them, a <HI>strange kind</HI> of <HI>moralized Salvages. Grave
and Serious</HI> in their Speech and Carriage, and not without some shew of a
<HI>kind of Religion,</HI> which no doubt but they have learned from <HI>the Prince
of darkness,</HI> (by the help of some papist in those parts) that can <HI>Trans∣form
himself into an Angel of Light;</HI> under that shape, the better to car∣ry
on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he designes of his Kingdome. It is said also, they pretend to
have <HI>received some Visions</HI> and <HI>Revelations,</HI> by which they have been
commanded to <HI>worship the great God,</HI> and not to <HI>work on the Lords day.</HI>
We know where <HI>that Fountain</HI> hath its Rise, that sendeth forth at the
same place <HI>sweet and bitter waters.</HI> And from whence their hearts are in∣spired,
that joyn blessing of God, with cursing and killing his Servants.</P>
<P>It is reported by some that came lately from those parts, that the In∣dians
there do as yet refuse to have any peace with the <HI>English,</HI> and will
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> return any of our Captive Friends, till God speak to the
foresaid <HI>Enthusiast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that are <HI>their Leaders,</HI> that they should <HI>no longer</HI>
make <HI>warr with us,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="000231_0208_0FA9ACBC9517A880"/>
But not to trouble our selves farther with those <HI>Ministers of Satan,</HI>
or those that are acted by the <HI>Angel of the bottoml<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss pit,</HI> (who pos∣sibly
since their <HI>delusions</HI> are but <HI>two fold more</HI> the <HI>Children of Hell</HI>
then they <HI>were before.</HI>) We know better how to understand the mind of
the <HI>great Lord of Heaven &amp; Earth</HI> then to depend on such <HI>lying Oracles.</HI></P>
<P>That God who hath at present <HI>turned their hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to hate his Peo∣ple,</HI>
and <HI>deal subtilly</HI> with his <HI>Servants;</HI> we hope in his time, will ei∣ther
<HI>turn the stream,</HI> and cause them to deal <HI>friendly</HI> and <HI>sincerely</HI> with
his People, as <HI>heretofore,</HI> or give us an opportunity to <HI>destroy them.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place it remains, that some account be given of <HI>our
Forces</HI> under <HI>Captain Hathorne,</HI> and of their <HI>several Expeditions</HI> into
the <HI>Eastern parts,</HI> since the middle of <HI>September last;</HI> first up toward
<HI>Casco,</HI> by the <HI>Sea-side,</HI> then afterwards <HI>through the woods</HI> directly
<HI>Northward,</HI> toward <HI>Ossapy,</HI> and <HI>Pigwauchet,</HI> in hope to have found
the Enemy there at their <HI>head Quarters.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the first Report of those <HI>Devastations</HI> and <HI>Spoyl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> that had been
made by <HI>Fire and Sword</HI> in those <HI>Eastern Plantations.</HI> It was judg∣ed
necessary to send some Forces that way to put a stop unto the <HI>current</HI>
of those <HI>Outrages,</HI> before the <HI>Remainders</HI> of the <HI>Southern</HI> Indians
could have opportunity to joyn with them: To that end about an
<HI>hundred and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rty English,</HI> with <HI>forty Indians</HI> were dispatched away
into those parts, under the Command of <HI>Captain William Hathorne,
Captain Syl,</HI> and <HI>Captain Hunting,</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o were to joyne with such as
could be raised in those parts, under <HI>Major Waldern,</HI> and <HI>Captain
Frost:</HI> After they had surprized the Indians that flocked into those parts,
(as was Related before) which was done upon <HI>September the 6th.
1676. Captain Hathorne</HI> who was <HI>Commander in chief,</HI> marched the
Forces by the <HI>Sea-side</HI> towards <HI>Casco;</HI> For at that time they were upon
some demurre, whether to march directly toward <HI>Ossapy,</HI> and <HI>Pig∣wau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>het,</HI>
where the <HI>head Quarters</HI> of the Enemy was supposed to be,
or else to march directly toward <HI>Casco Bay,</HI> where they heard <HI>Parties</HI> of
the Enemy were daily <HI>spoyling the Plantations</HI> of the English, At the
last it was judged <HI>most Expedient</HI> to try if they could not meet with
some par yes of the Enemy amongst those <HI>Plantations</HI> near the Sea-side,
by that means at least to prevent them from doing more mischief
if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld not find an opportunity to <HI>fall upon</HI> some of them, and
<HI>destroy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>:</HI> But their time was not yet come, nor were all the <HI>Desola∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions</HI>
as yet <HI>accomplished,</HI> which G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d had a purpose to <HI>bring about</HI> by
their means. For notwithstanding there was a <HI>sfficient Force</HI> to have
suppr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed all the numbers of the Enemy, if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad been many more
<PB N="50" REF="000231_0209_0FA9ACBCCFF13128"/>
than they were; yet being <HI>emboldened</HI> and <HI>grown subtle</HI> by their <HI>former
successes,</HI> they had so dispersed themselves all about the woods in those
p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts, that when our Forces were in one place, they would be in ano∣ther,
and so did much mischief thereabouts, while our Souldiers were
<HI>out after them:</HI> For after they had by several steps in <HI>ten dayes</HI> time got∣ten
to <HI>Casco,</HI> from <HI>Newechewannick</HI> (about the <HI>eight of Septembe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>) they
marched to <HI>Wells,</HI> and from <HI>Wells</HI> to <HI>Winter Harbour,</HI> and so from thence
to <HI>Black point</HI> they passed by water, and then arrived at <HI>Casco Bay,</HI>
about the <HI>twentieth of September,</HI> yet about that very time, were seve∣ral
of the English <HI>cut off</HI> at <HI>Mount joyes Island,</HI> and that in <HI>sight of our
Forces,</HI> when they were not able to come at them, for want of <HI>Boat,</HI>
the <HI>Island</HI> lying <HI>two Leagues</HI> off in the <HI>Bay;</HI> this hapned the <HI>twenty
third</HI> of the same month, as was said before, and within <HI>two dayes</HI> af∣ter,
another party of the Enemy were doing mischief at <HI>Wells,</HI> and <HI>Cape
Nidduck,</HI> and yet escaped away, when they had done.</P>
<P>Nor could <HI>our Forces</HI> in all <HI>their Expedition</HI> meet with any of them,
bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>two;</HI> one of which soon after he was taken, was let go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by the
<HI>Treachery</HI> or <HI>Carelessness</HI> of them that held him. For when our For∣ces
were come within a <HI>few miles</HI> of the hither side of <HI>Casco Bay,</HI> some
of our <HI>Natick Indian Scouts</HI> going in Company with the Indians under
<HI>Blind Will,</HI> (a <HI>Saga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore</HI> of <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> who went in Company with
eight of his men, supposed to be <HI>good Pilots</HI> for the places more <HI>East∣ward</HI>)
met with some of the Enemy, and laid hold of <HI>a couple</HI> of them;
<HI>Iustice</HI> was done upon <HI>one of them,</HI> the other, although he was led by
two of <HI>Blind Wills Indians,</HI> they made a shift to <HI>let goe,</HI> who escaping
away, got over a River, and gave notice to the Indians who were on
the other side, &amp; were heard but a little before <HI>threshing in a Barne</HI> that
belonged to one <HI>Anthony Bracket,</HI> (whom they had late<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y surprized)
Another disappointment our Forces met withal about the same time,
for when <HI>Captain Hathorne</HI> was up at <HI>Casco Bay</HI> with his Souldiers, he
n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver could come up with the Indians, either through want of Skill in
them that were his <HI>Scouts,</HI> or rather want of Faithfulness in one that
<HI>should have been his guide,</HI> who had got his living by <HI>Trading with the
Indians:</HI> therefore seemed unwilling to have the <HI>Brood of them</HI> de∣stroyed:
As was known afterwards. And by that means a <HI>party</HI> of
the Enemy escaped the hands of <HI>our Souldiers.</HI> Yet it pleased God at
one time to bring the <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rlorne of our Forces</HI> upon a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of the En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣my,
who espying the <HI>English,</HI> presently <HI>fled away</HI> into the woods, like
so many <HI>wild Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> yet one of them, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>I. Sampson</HI> who had
been of the Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny, that killed <HI>Robinson</HI> the year before, was by the
<PB N="51" REF="000231_0210_0FA9ACBE76B1E078"/>
<HI>special hand of Divine Iustice,</HI> suffered to fall, by some of <HI>our Forces:</HI>
He was a <HI>very lusty, stout man,</HI> and one that was armed with <HI>several
sorts of Weapons,</HI> but there is no <HI>Weapon</HI> shall defend them, whom death
hath a <HI>Commission</HI> to destroy: There is no <HI>Ransome in that War:</HI>
The rest of the Indians that were scattered about <HI>Casco Bay,</HI> having
discovered our Forces, made their escape: But, we hope their time
is short, and that God will find some way to cut off the <HI>bloody</HI> and <HI>de∣ceitful
Enemies</HI> of his People, and not suffer them to <HI>live out half their
dayes.</HI></P>
<P>But by one such Accident or other; <HI>our Souldiers</HI> could not meet with
any of them that had done all the mischief about those parts. And while
our Forces lay about <HI>Casco Bay;</HI> A small party of the Enemy came
down upon the Borders of the Town of <HI>Wells,</HI> where they <HI>lay in Am∣bush</HI>
near a Garrison house, at one end of the Town, and shot down
<HI>Mr. Iames Gouge</HI> from his horse, <HI>September the twenty fourth,</HI> being
<HI>Lords day,</HI> as he was going home from <HI>the Meeting;</HI> and then <HI>knocked
down his wife,</HI> giving her several wounds with their Hatchets about the
head, of which she dyed within three dayes after.</P>
<P>The next day <HI>September the twenty fifth,</HI> the same party being not
above <HI>seven</HI> in number went toward <HI>Yorke,</HI> and surprized <HI>Cape Nid∣duck</HI>
in a barbarous manner, killing most of the poor people belonging
thereunto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me of their Neighbours hearing of the Guns, came to <HI>their
Res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue:</HI> The Indians being on the further side of a River, dared them
to come over and <HI>fight with them man to man:</HI> using several Reproach∣ful
Tearms to them, making a Shot at them also, which some of the
Company not being able to bear, did <HI>very resolutely adventure</HI> through
the River after them; but they were not willing to <HI>try the valour</HI> of
the <HI>English;</HI> when they perceived they <HI>found a way</HI> to pass over the <HI>Ri∣ver
upon them,</HI> but returned back towards <HI>Wells;</HI> where they killed ano∣ther,
one <HI>George Farrow, September the twenty seventh,</HI> as he was too
carelessly venturing to his house without any Company: These things
hapned while our Forces were at <HI>Casco,</HI> where they tarryed seven or
eight dayes. And hearing of these Outrages commit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in some of
those places which they left behind them; and not being able to meet
with any of them in the place where they were, they returned back to∣ward
<HI>Wells,</HI> and <HI>Yorke;</HI> but the Indians were escaped away into the
woods after their Companions, before they came there: Our Souldiers
having thus spent much time and pains in a fruitless Expedition toward
<HI>Casco,</HI> they resolved to venture <HI>another march</HI> af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er them, up towards
<HI>Ossapy,</HI> supposing they mightly that time be drawn homewards toward
<PB N="52" REF="000231_0211_0FA9ACBEFB0972F8"/>
their <HI>Wint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Quarters;</HI> or else, that they might destroy what they had
left behind them, to <HI>prevent their harbouring there</HI> for the future: But
it seemed good to him, who by his Sovereign Power and Infinite wis∣dom
ordereth all Events and pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>poses (wherein his People or others are
concerned) to <HI>disappoint all endeavours</HI> used at that time for the sup∣peessing
of the Enemy, or putring any stop to their wonted Successes:
For soon after onr Forces were returned back from <HI>Casco,</HI> news was
brought of the <HI>surprizal</HI> of <HI>Black point,</HI> on the <HI>twelfth of October,</HI> as
was mentioned before; which notwithstanding; It was judged more ad∣viseable
to venture and proceed on with the Expedition toward <HI>Ossapy,</HI>
(whether it was supposed by this time, the greatest number of them
were retired) rather then to return back again to recover <HI>Black point,</HI>
where was nothing to be expected but an empty Fort, and some desert∣ed
houses, which it seems the Indians had forsaken by that time.</P>
<P>And besides that other <HI>Forces</HI> were about the same time ordered to <HI>repair</HI>
thither, sufficient for the repairing &amp; securing of the place with what else
was left remaining from the hands of the <HI>Enemy;</HI> And likewise several
Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diers were ordered to Garrison the Towns thereabouts, to prevent
them from making any further Assault upon them However, they were
so far emboldned by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>king of <HI>black point,</HI> and the <HI>Ketch</HI> at <HI>Rich∣mond
Island</HI> with several Prisoners also which were surp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ized at the same
time; That a party of them came the very next week after, toward
<HI>Wells,</HI> hoping to attain that, and all the Towns, and places else betwixt
<HI>Casco Bay</HI> and <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> as they had done <HI>black point.</HI> For a party
of them under <HI>Mugg</HI> their <HI>chief Leader,</HI> brought <HI>Mr. Shendal</HI> along
with them to <HI>Wells,</HI> where they <HI>summoned</HI> the <HI>first Garrison</HI> at the Towns
end To facilitate the business, they sent the said <HI>Shendal</HI> as their <HI>Agent,</HI>
or Messenger to move them to <HI>surrender,</HI> without hazarding an onset; But
the People were not so despondent, to yield up the place upon so slight an
occasion; which when the <HI>Enemy</HI> discerned, they soon drew off, after they
had done some little mischief to the Inhabitants: For first they killed <HI>Isa∣ack
L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le field</HI> not far from the Garrison, It is said, they would willingly
have had him <HI>yield himself Prisoner,</HI> but he refusing, they shot him down,
yet they were so Civil, as to suffer his Friends to <HI>fetch away his body,</HI> with∣out
offering any further act of Inhumanity to it, or <HI>Host<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity</HI> toward them
that <HI>fetch it off.</HI> An <HI>old man</HI> called <HI>Cross,</HI> was killed by them likewise
about the same time, and another, <HI>Ioseph Bigfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> by name, belonging
to the Garrison, was sorely wounded at that time, so as he lyed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon af∣ter:
<HI>Thirteen</HI> head of <HI>neat Cattle</HI> were also killed by them, out of which
they only for haste, took the <HI>Tongues,</HI> leaving the bodies of all the <HI>rest
<PB N="53" REF="000231_0212_0FA9ACBFB91B7220"/>
whole</HI> to the <HI>Owners,</HI> unless it were <HI>the Leg</HI> of one of them, which was
also taken away.</P>
<P>This was all the mischief was done by them, after the taking of <HI>Black
point:</HI> The Inhabitants of <HI>Winter Harbour,</HI> near adjoyning thereto,
being alarmed with the surprizal of the other place; fled away with
<HI>their goods,</HI> for a time; till they heard the Enemies were removed far∣ther
<HI>Eastward,</HI> and then it was said; they returned to their place again;
In this posture have things in those places remained ever since, in those
<HI>Eastern Plantations</HI> betwixt <HI>Pascataqua</HI> and <HI>Casco Bay.</HI></P>
<P>But our Forces under the Command of <HI>Captain Hathorne,</HI> and <HI>Cap∣tain
Syl,</HI> having at the last obtained all things necessary for a <HI>Winter
march</HI> into the woods, did upon the <HI>first of November</HI> following, set
forth toward <HI>Ossapy,</HI> where, after <HI>four dayes march</HI> of very <HI>difficult
way,</HI> over many Rivers, not easy to pass at that time of the year, they ar∣rived;
but found <HI>never an Indian;</HI> either there, or in the way, as they
marched along: The Indians belonging to those parts, had not many
years before hired some <HI>English Traders</HI> to build them a <HI>Fort,</HI> for their se∣curity
against the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> which was built <HI>very strong</HI> for that purpose
<HI>fourteen Foot</HI> high with <HI>Flankers</HI> at each corner. But at this time the Soul∣diers
<HI>intending to disappoint them of their Refuge,</HI> made <HI>Fuel thereof,</HI> which
at that time was very <HI>needful for out People,</HI> who had marched many

keep themselves from <HI>freezing</HI> as they passed along, so early in the
<HI>Winter:</HI> None of the Enemy being to be found there in their <HI>strongest
Fort;</HI> It was not counted worth the while for all the Company to
<HI>march any farther:</HI> Wherefore a small party being sent up <HI>eighteen or
twenty miles</HI> farther <HI>Northward</HI> amongst the woods, whereas they p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣sed
along they met with many <HI>vast Lakes,</HI> (supposed to be the Cause
of the <HI>sharpness of the cold,</HI> in that side of the Country) making the place

for <HI>Moose</HI> in the <HI>Winter,</HI> and <HI>Beaver</HI> in the <HI>Summer,</HI> (a sort of
Creatures, whose Skins are of more Account than all their bodies.) But
at this time it is supposed they were all gone lower toward the Sea side,
<HI>to share the Spoyls</HI> of the English Plantations, lately surprized by them;
which is all the <HI>Reward</HI> they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave met withal, who in former years,
for the sake of a little Lucre by Traffick with them, have run themselves
there into the very <HI>Iaws of destruction,</HI> either by Irregular dealing with
them; or by their too much c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fidence in their <HI>deceitful Friendship.</HI></P>
<P><HI>November the ninth,</HI> our Forces having spent <HI>nine dayes</HI> in this Service,
returned safe to <HI>Newechewannick,</HI> from whence they set forth at the first,
<PB N="54" REF="000231_0213_0FA9ACC09E368EE0"/>
having run more <HI>hazard of their Limbs,</HI> by the <HI>sharpness of the Frost,</HI> than
of <HI>their lives</HI> by any <HI>Assault</HI> from their Enemies.</P>
<P>There was great probability that the designe might have had some
good Effect, if <HI>Mugg</HI> a <HI>chief Leader</HI> of them, did not much abuse
those he fled unto, with a <HI>proffer of Peace;</HI> for he told them that there
were about an hundred of them about <HI>Ossapy,</HI> not many dayes before:
But it becomes us to look beyond <HI>second Causes,</HI> in Events of this na∣ture;
and conclude, that <HI>God had raised up</HI> these Barbarous Enemies to
bring <HI>a like Chastisement</HI> upon the English in this <HI>side of the Country,</HI>
with that which others had endured elsewhere, in the end of the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer,

<P>Things were so ordered by the <HI>good Providence of God,</HI> that the said
<HI>Vessels</HI> arrived safely at <HI>Penobscot</HI> in the beginning of the next month,
where they found the said <HI>Madockawando,</HI> who was ready to confirm
and make good the <HI>Articles of the Peace</HI> concluded at <HI>Boston</HI> by his
<HI>Agent</HI> in his Name; And was willing also to deliver all <HI>the Prisoners</HI>
that were then in <HI>his Power,</HI> or under his <HI>Command,</HI> which were but
<HI>two,</HI> who were taken in the Vessel at <HI>Richmond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Island,</HI> the <HI>twelfth of
October</HI> last. The said <HI>Mugg</HI> likewise being sensible of the <HI>Obliga∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion</HI>
he lay under, to make good his word, did <HI>venture to go up</HI> himself to
another <HI>Plantation</HI> of the Indians, where was supposed some more of
the <HI>English Prisoners</HI> were, to see whether he could obtain <HI>their Re∣lease,</HI>
as also to <HI>perswade with the rest</HI> of the Indians thereabouts to joyne
in the <HI>confirmation of the Peace;</HI> It appeared to the persons belonging
to the Vessels, that the said <HI>Mugg</HI> went with some <HI>Reluctancy,</HI> as fear∣ing
the Indians be was going amongst, would either <HI>kill him,</HI> or <HI>keep
him Prisoner;</HI> To which end, he ordered the <HI>Commanders</HI> belonging to
the <HI>Vessels</HI> to tarry for him, about <HI>three dayes,</HI> or <HI>four at the most,</HI> assu∣ring
them, that if he did not return by that time, they might <HI>certainly
conclude</HI> that either <HI>his Life or Liberty</HI> was taken from him, However the
Vessels tarried <HI>about</HI> or near <HI>a week</HI> beyond the time <HI>limited,</HI> in expecta∣tion
<PB N="57" REF="000231_0216_0FA9ACC7874B14A8"/>
of his coming; But after <HI>so long stay,</HI> they neither seeing, nor he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣ing
from him, were ready to <HI>fear the worst, viz.</HI> that his Country
men had <HI>made him sure</HI> from having more to do with the <HI>English<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
Whereupon for fear of being <HI>shut up</HI> by the <HI>sharpness</HI> of the <HI>Winter</HI>
from returning themselves, they took the opportunity of the next <HI>fair
wind</HI> of setting Sayle for <HI>Boston,</HI> (only turning in to <HI>Pemmaquid</HI> to see
if they could hear any <HI>farther News</HI> there) where they arrived with
<HI>such Prisoners,</HI> as were freely delivered by <HI>Madockawando,</HI> the <HI>twenty
fifth of December following, Anno,</HI> 1676. Amongst which Prisoners, be∣sides
the two forementioned, who were fonnd at <HI>Penobscot,</HI> there was a
third, by a more <HI>remarkable Providence</HI> then ordinary, added unto
them, <HI>Mr. Thomas Cobbet,</HI> Son of that <HI>Reverend</HI> and <HI>worthy Minister</HI>
of the <HI>Gospel, Mr. Thomas Cobbet (Pastor</HI> of the Church at <HI>Ipswitch,</HI> a
Town within the <HI>Massachusets Iurisdiction)</HI> who had all the time of
his <HI>Sons Captivity</HI> together with his friends <HI>wrestled with God</HI> in their
<HI>daily Prayers</HI> for his <HI>Release,</HI> and accordingly he was with the more
<HI>joy received</HI> by his friends, as an <HI>Answer</HI> and <HI>Return</HI> of their <HI>Prayers.</HI>
The said young man had lived with <HI>Mr. Fryer, Merchant</HI> of <HI>Ports-mouth</HI>
for some years before, and had been oft at Sea with <HI>Mr. Iames
Fryer</HI> the eldest Son of the said <HI>Merchant,</HI> and who had after much
Experience of <HI>his Faithfulness, dexterity,</HI> and <HI>Courage</HI> on all such Ac∣comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
borne him so much Respect, that when he was urged by his Fa∣ther
to go along with <HI>Mr. Shendal,</HI> as was said before, he would not
venture unless his Friend <HI>Thomas Cobbet</HI> would go along with him; <HI>the
which Service</HI> he only for his Friends sake accepted, which proved a <HI>fa∣tal
Adventure</HI> to <HI>Mr. Iames Fryer,</HI> and might have done to the other
also, had not God otherwise <HI>disposed of him,</HI> having, as is hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, <HI>more
Service</HI> for him in the <HI>Land of the living.</HI> Amongst all the Prisoners at
that time taken, the said <HI>Thomas Cobbet</HI> seemed to have had the <HI>hardest
portion:</HI> For besides the <HI>desperate dangers</HI> that he escaped, before he
was taken. <HI>First,</HI> by a <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llet,</HI> shot through his <HI>Wast-Coat. Secondly,</HI> by
a <HI>drunken Indian,</HI> who had a <HI>knife</HI> at his <HI>Throat</HI> to <HI>cut it,</HI> when his
<HI>hands</HI> were <HI>bound,</HI> when the Indians came to <HI>share the Prisoners</HI> amongst
them, he fell into the hands of one of the <HI>ruggeddest Fellows,</HI> by whom
within a few dayes after <HI>his surprizal,</HI> he was carryed first from <HI>Black
point,</HI> to <HI>Shipscot River</HI> in the <HI>Ketch,</HI> which the Indians made them to
Sayle for them, into the <HI>said River,</HI> from thence he was forced <HI>to travel</HI>
with his <HI>Pateroon Four or five miles</HI> over land to <HI>Damariscottee,</HI> where
he was compelled <HI>to row or paddle</HI> in a <HI>Canoo</HI> about <HI>fifty five miles</HI> far∣ther
to <HI>Penobscot,</HI> and there <HI>taking leave</HI> of all his English Friends and
<PB N="58" REF="000231_0217_0FA9ACC7A8A361A0"/>
acquaintance, at least for the <HI>Winter,</HI> he was put to <HI>paddle a Canoo</HI> up
<HI>fifty</HI> or <HI>sixty mile:</HI> farther <HI>Eastward,</HI> to an <HI>Island</HI> called <HI>Mount Desart,</HI>
where his <HI>Pateroon</HI> used to keep his <HI>winter station,</HI> and to appoint his
<HI>hunting Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ages;</HI> and in that <HI>Desart-like</HI> Condition was the <HI>poor young
man</HI> forced to continue <HI>nine weeks</HI> in the Service of a <HI>Salvage miscre∣ant,</HI>
who sometimes would <HI>Tyrannize</HI> over him, because he could not
understand <HI>his Language,</HI> and for want thereof, might occasion him to
<HI>miss of his Game,</HI> or the like. What ever sickness he was obno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious
unto, by <HI>change of dyet,</HI> or other account, he could expect no other
<HI>allowance</HI> than the <HI>Wigwam</HI> will aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd: If <HI>Ioseph</HI> be in the Prison, so
long as <HI>God is with him</HI> there, he shall be preserved, and in due time
remembred.</P>
<P>After the end of the <HI>nine weeks,</HI> the Indian whom he was to serve,
had spent all his <HI>powder,</HI> whereupon on the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dden he took up a <HI>Resoluti∣on</HI>
to send this <HI>young man</HI> down to <HI>Penobscot</HI> to <HI>Mounsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Casteen</HI> to
procure more <HI>po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der</HI> to kill <HI>Moose and Dear,</HI> which it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is all their
way of living at <HI>Mount Desart;</HI> The Indian was certainly <HI>over ruled
by Divine providence</HI> in sending <HI>his Captive</HI> down thither, for a few
dayes before, as it seems, after the Indians in that place, had been <HI>pow∣awing
together,</HI> he told him, that there were <HI>two English Vessels</HI> then
come into <HI>Pemm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quid,</HI> or <HI>Penobscot,</HI> which proved so indeed: yet was
it <HI>not minded</HI> by him surely, when he sent <HI>his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptive</HI> thither for <HI>pow∣der,</HI>
for it proved the means of <HI>his escape;</HI> which his <HI>Pateroon</HI> might ea∣sily
have <HI>conjectured,</HI> if it had not been hid from him As soon as he
Arrived at <HI>Penobscot,</HI> he met with <HI>Magg,</HI> who presently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him by
the Name of Mr. <HI>Cobbet,</HI> and taking him by the hand, told him, he had
been at his <HI>Father<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> house,</HI> (which was <HI>November the first or second</HI> before,
as he passed through <HI>Ipswitch to Boston)</HI> and had promised to send him
home, so soon as he returned. <HI>Maaockawando</HI> taking notice of what
Magg was speaking that way, although he were willing that he should
be released according to Agreement, (his <HI>Pateroon</HI> being one of this <HI>Sa∣gamores
Subjects,</HI> though during the <HI>Hunting Voyage</HI> of the <HI>winter,</HI>
he lived at such a distance from him) began to <HI>demand something</HI> for
<HI>sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isfaction,</HI> in a way of <HI>Ransome,</HI> not understanding before that his
Father was, <HI>a great Preachman,</HI> as they use to call it: Reply mas made
to him, that he should have something in <HI>lieu of a Ransome, viz</HI> a <HI>fine
Coat,</HI> which they had for him <HI>aboord the Vessel;</HI> the which the <HI>Saga∣more</HI>
desired to see, before he would <HI>absolutely grant</HI> his Release: but
upon sight of the <HI>said Coat,</HI> he seemed very well satisfied, and gave him
<HI>free liberty to return</HI> home. Whilst this Mr. <HI>Thomas Cobbet</HI> was a

Prisoner at <HI>Mount Desart</HI> going along with the Indians <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt,</HI> in an

not being able to stir hand or foot, and had without doubt there <HI>perish∣ed</HI>

him,</HI> presently <HI>ran about</HI> the <HI>woods</HI> to <HI>seek him,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when they found
him, they were either <HI>so pitiful</HI> to him, or <HI>so careful</HI> of their own good,
as not to <HI>cast away</HI> a likely <HI>young man,</HI> from whom they expected ei∣ther
<HI>much service,</HI> or a <HI>good Ransome,</HI> for want of a <HI>little Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and pains
to preserve his life; wherefore, taking him upon <HI>their shoulders,</HI> they
carryed him into the <HI>next Wigwam,</HI> so as he soon after <HI>revived,</HI> and
<HI>came to himself</HI> again, without any farther mischief.</P>
<P>At another time, the <HI>Salvage Villain</HI> whose Prisoner he was, so long
as he had <HI>strong Liquor,</HI> for <HI>five dayes together</HI> was <HI>so drunke,</HI> that he
was like a <HI>furious mad Beast,</HI> so as none durst come near him, his
<HI>Squaws</HI> he almost <HI>brained</HI> in one of those <HI>drunken fits.</HI></P>
<P>The said <HI>Thomas</HI> was forced to get out of his sight into the <HI>woods</HI> all
that night, for fear of being mischiefed by him. Where making a fire
he kept himself alive: The <HI>Squaws</HI> being by Gods special Providence
so <HI>inclined to pity,</HI> that they came to him daily <HI>with Victuals,</HI> by which
means he was at that time also preserved: All which put together,
makes his Deliverance <HI>the more Remarkable, as an Answer of prayer.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Rest of the Prisoners,</HI> (which are said to be <HI>fifty</HI> or <HI>sixty)</HI>
They were left with them who first <HI>surprized them</HI> at <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> and

at the first taking of me they carryed me up to <HI>Taconet,</HI> and the men

<P>By the Report which he brings it doth not appear so difficult a mat∣ter

it, as was before apprehended: Insomuch, as that designe, that was un∣der

was feared might joyne with those of <HI>Kennibeck</HI> in the Spring, and so
come down upon the English Plantations, and spoyle them all that are
thereabouts. For soon after <HI>Francis Card</HI> coming to <HI>Boston,</HI> some of
<HI>Major Walde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> Indians at <HI>Quecheeh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> as they were hunting in the

Guns, at least <HI>two of them;</HI> but those of <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o</HI> were without. The
other Indians began to <HI>insinuate</HI> into them, to see if they could make
way for their acceptance with the <HI>English:</HI> Those Indians that this mo∣tion
was made unto, in a most <HI>persidi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us manner</HI> gave them encourage∣ment
in the business,; And appointed a place where to meet them the
<HI>next day,</HI> saying, they would not have them now <HI>go home</HI> with them to
<HI>their Wigwams,</HI> least their <HI>Women</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> should be frighted with
the sight of their Guns; All which was spoken upon a Treacherous
Account, by that means to <HI>betray them,</HI> for they had neither <HI>Women nor
Children</HI> at their <HI>Wigwams;</HI> but not having Gun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves, as the other
had, they durst not then <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon them:</HI> The <HI>next day</HI> therefore ac∣cording

presently the first being thus <HI>Treacherously brought into the snare</HI> was

as is said; but he could not live <HI>much longer</HI> by Reason of his wounds:
These <HI>Quechecho</HI> Indians cut off the Scalps of their poor Countrymen,
(which is their usual manner, when it is too far to carry the heads)
which being brought to <HI>Major Walderns</HI> Indians, they were presently
discerned to be <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> by the cut of their <HI>hair.</HI> This instance is
a sufficient Evidence of the Subtilety, guile, and Falshood natural to all
these Indians; and may satisfie any Rational person, what l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle trust
there is to be put in their words, promises, or Engagements, though
never so solemnly made, farther then they that make them, see Advan∣tage
in the keeping and performing. Subtilety, malice, and Revenge,
seems to be as inseparable from them, as if it were part of their <HI>Essence.</HI></P>
<P>What ever hopes may be of their Conversion to <HI>Christianity</HI> in after
Time, there is but little appearance of any <HI>Truth</HI> in their hearts at pre∣sent,

counted it <HI>high time</HI> now to be <HI>looking out</HI> for more: to which end,

his business was here? to whom it was Answered, we came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etch off
the <HI>Captives</HI> and make War as we see good. <HI>Simo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> also told us that the

<HI>Captives</HI> were all well, that we should have them by morning, that
<HI>Squando</HI> was there, and would give the <HI>Captives</HI> to <HI>Major Waldern</HI> that
they intended peace, had sent to <HI>Boston</HI> before now, but that <HI>Mugg</HI>

<P>On the <HI>Nineteenth.</HI> Wind <HI>North East,</HI> the weather thick; About

them to fight: Immediately on the Return of our Scouts we
marched against them as secretly as we could: upon sight of us they
fled; but <HI>Captain Frost</HI> came upon them with his <HI>whole body</HI> before they
were half out of <HI>Gun shot:</HI> in this Skirmish we judged, we killed and
wounded several of them without any damage, yet some of their <HI>Bul∣lets</HI>
hit some of our men. For the <HI>Captives sake</HI> immediately after this,
we hung out <HI>a Flag of Truc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and the Enemy did the like: <HI>Iohn Pain</HI>
was sent to them to demand the Reason why they <HI>fired the house,</HI> and
<HI>brake their Promise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Simon</HI> met him half way, and Answered, the house was <HI>fired
Accidentally</HI> without Order from <HI>Squando:</HI> that they had sent for the
<HI>Captives</HI> who were a great way off, and the <HI>foul weather</HI> hindred their
coming: He questioned <HI>Iohn Pain</HI> also why we sought them while we
were in <HI>Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pain</HI> Answered they brake it themselves in not performing their pro∣mise,
challenging our Souldiers to fight; this latter <HI>Simon</HI> denyed, and
Answered the other as before: <HI>Simon</HI> told him they had <HI>two men wound∣ed,</HI>

<P>In their way, off from <HI>Gy-obscut Point,</HI> they espyed <HI>two Indians</HI> in a

they had said before to <HI>Iohn Pain.</HI> While they were in discourse, an
<HI>English Captive</HI> was espyed in a <HI>Canoo</HI> with his <HI>Pateroon,</HI> with whom they
<HI>desired to speak</HI> but it was not granted at that time, he being carryed far∣ther
up the River out of fight.</P>
<P>Soon after the <HI>Major</HI> went a shore with <HI>six men,</HI> yet carrying <HI>no
Arms</HI> with them. He found their words <HI>smoother than Oyle,</HI> yet were
there <HI>drawn Swords in their hearts,</HI> of which some of their act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, gave
no <HI>small ground of Suspition:</HI> for they deferred all till the <HI>next morning;</HI>
nor were they willing to let the man that was <HI>espyed before</HI> in the <HI>Canoo</HI>
come a boord to see his Friends without leaving <HI>an Hostage</HI> in his room,
of which <HI>the Major</HI> was very glad, that he might have an opportunity
of a little discourse with one whom they <HI>might trust.</HI> When they re∣turned
from the shore, <HI>a sign</HI> was promised to be given for <HI>the Appea∣rance</HI>

<HI>February the twenty seventh, the Major</HI> with the same number as before,
went to <HI>Treat with them:</HI> They with <HI>Iohn Pain</HI> having first <HI>holloed</HI> to
them; upon their coming a shore their persons were <HI>searched</HI> on <HI>both
sides,</HI> and <HI>all Arms</HI> laid <HI>aside.</HI> The whole Forenoon was spent in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Treaty,</HI> whereat they seemed <HI>much to rejoyce</HI> in <HI>expectation of a Peace</HI>
with the English; yet when <HI>Major Waldern</HI> desired a <HI>present delivery</HI>
of the Captives, with <HI>Assistance of men</HI> and <HI>Canoos</HI> to fight the <HI>Mo∣noscoggin
Indians,</HI> Enemies to them both, it was denyed, though they
could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have had a fitter <HI>Testimony of their Fidelity.</HI></P>
<P>They alleadged that the <HI>Captives</HI> were givers them by <HI>Kennibeck In∣dians,</HI>
and they must have something for <HI>keeping them all Winter,</HI> and
therefore were not willing to let them go without <HI>Ransome;</HI> And for

or could be proved they had.</P>
<P>That part of the pay, which was to be <HI>in Liquor,</HI> was presently laid

<P>This being determined, <HI>the Major</HI> with <HI>five of his men</HI> went a shore,
with part of the <HI>Ransome,</HI> the better to beget a <HI>Confidence in them;</HI> and

if he had not wisely provided against all <HI>Exigenciess</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore hand, he might
have been <HI>prevented</HI> from ever <HI>going aboord</HI> more; for stepping aside <HI>a

of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> will lead into <HI>uncertain paths.</HI> This is not the <HI>first

<HI>barbarous Calamities</HI> from their <HI>Pagan Neighbours,</HI> to whom they have

Neighbour Colony of <HI>Virginia</HI> on the <HI>twenty second of March,</HI> 1622.
when by a general <HI>Conspir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy</HI> of the Indians <HI>three hundred and forty se∣ven
persons</HI> of the English Planters, were <HI>barbarously massa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red;</HI> at that
time when they had the greatest hopes of Converting them to Christi∣anity;
yet need no: this any whit discourage <HI>charitable Endeavours</HI>
that way; for if it had not been for one <HI>Converted Indian,</HI> that revealed
the <HI>Plot,</HI> in all likelihood <HI>all the rest</HI> of the English there planted, had
been in like manner <HI>cut off</HI> at the same ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. The <HI>Heathen</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>
are scituate in the same <HI>Climate,</HI> therefore cannot be supposed
to be much <HI>differing</HI> in their <HI>manners and disposition.</HI> But besides that
we are <HI>hemm'd in</HI> on both sides▪ and almost <HI>round about,</HI> with People of
<HI>Forreign Nations,</HI> whole designe is neither Religion, nor yet planting
<HI>Colonyes</HI> of <HI>Civil People,</HI> so much as present <HI>Emolument</HI> by <HI>Commerce</HI>
and <HI>Traffick</HI> with the Indians, who notwithstanding their <HI>barbarous
manner</HI> of living, are yet furnished with some rich and useful Commo∣dities,
for the obtaining of which, those that come amongst them have
not been unwilling to offer them in way of <HI>Exchange,</HI> such Commodi∣ties
as the Indians most fancy and desire, as <HI>Powder</HI> and <HI>Amunition,</HI> not
considering how <HI>destructive</HI> the Trade thereof may prove to others,
which hath made some wise m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n both <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>foretell</HI> the <HI>dangerous
Issue</HI> of Trading those things with the Indians here. It hath been said
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> used so to deal with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> at such times as they
had their <HI>fiercest Wars</HI> with them, saying, that if they did not, others
would carry▪ those Commodities to their Enemies, which they thought
they were as good to do themselves, that so in Case of <HI>bad Succes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the
Wars,</HI> the gain of the <HI>Barter</HI> might help to make amends for the loss of
the <HI>Battle.</HI> The same Reason possibly put them upon the like practice
in that part of this Country called the <HI>New-Netherlands:</HI> for which
<PB N="75" REF="000231_0234_0FA9ACDA605AAB48"/>
they have pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty well <HI>smarted themselves,</HI> as now they have helped
others to do by their Example. Some <HI>prudent Gentlemen</HI> that <HI>govern∣ed
in Virginia</HI> at the first, were aware of this mischief; wherefore it was
strictly forbidden them, upon <HI>pain of death</HI> to shew a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Indian the <HI>use of
a Gun;</HI> if the like Course had been continued here, it had scarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been
possible according to the <HI>Eye of Reason</HI> that so much mischief could have
been done us by our Indian Neighbours, at this time more than in for∣mer
years. Their wills were as good heretofore, but when they had
nothing but <HI>Bows and Arrows</HI> to trust unto, they were capable of no
such mischief: But now by their <HI>frequent Converse</HI> and <HI>Trading</HI> with
the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> on each side of us, they are as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kil'd in the
use of <HI>small Artillery</HI> as many other Nations.</P>
<P>Their <HI>young men</HI> so much <HI>delighting</HI> therein, that upon point they mind
<HI>little else,</HI> and are so proud of their Skill, that they thought they could
<HI>easily deal with,</HI> if nor <HI>over-match</HI> their <HI>Masters;</HI> that first instructed
them.</P>
<P>It is reported by an <HI>Ancient Marriner</HI> yet living in these parts, a
person of <HI>good Credit,</HI> that above <HI>twenty years since</HI> being in the <HI>Eastern
parts</HI> about <HI>Kennibeck,</HI> he heard an old Indian tell this story, that when
he was a <HI>Youth,</HI> there was a <HI>Fort</HI> built about <HI>Saga-de-Hock</HI> (the Ruines
of which were then shown <HI>this Relater,</HI> supposed to be that called
<HI>St. Georges Fort</HI> in honour of <HI>Captain George Popham,</HI> the <HI>President</HI>
of the Company sent over <HI>Anno,</HI> 1607.) And possessed for some time
by the English: But afterward upon some Quarrel that fell out betwixt
the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>them,</HI> the English were some of them killed by the said
<HI>Indians,</HI> and the rest all driven out of the <HI>Fort,</HI> where there was left
much of their <HI>Provision</HI> and <HI>Amunition;</HI> amongst which there was some
<HI>Barrels of Powder,</HI> but after they had opened them, and not knowing
what to do therewith, they left the <HI>Barrels carelesly open,</HI> and scattered
the <HI>Powder</HI> about, so as accidentally it <HI>took fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> and blew up all that was
within the <HI>Fort, burnt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>destroyed many</HI> of the Indians, upon which
they conceived <HI>their God was Angry</HI> with them for <HI>doing hurt</HI> to the
English; It had been well these Indians never had had any <HI>other acquain∣tance</HI>
with the nature of that <HI>Commodity,</HI> then by such <HI>Experimental
knowledge</HI> of its <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>power.</HI> But Covetousness was and will be
the <HI>Root of all evil</HI> in every Age of the <HI>World,</HI> of which this may be
reckoned one, and not the least, that for the sake of a <HI>little Lucre,
Civil</HI> and <HI>Christian Nations</HI> have been induced to instruct a <HI>barbar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI>
and <HI>Salvage People</HI> (before ever they had been reduced to <HI>good order</HI>

<P>The <HI>Commiss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ners</HI> of our <HI>united Colonyes</HI> have for a long time <HI>care∣fully</HI>
and <HI>seriously</HI> endeavoured the preventing this <HI>Inconveniency</HI> in eve∣ry
of the <HI>three Colonyes,</HI> by strict prohibition of <HI>Trading Amunition</HI>
with the Indians; Nor hath it been given way unto, till of late years, when
by the <HI>continual Sollicitation</HI> of some of our own People (that possibly
since have <HI>paid dearly</HI> for their forwardness therein) who a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leadged the

upon us; The former restraint hath been taken off, and it is verily
supposed that as to some of <HI>our People,</HI> that in the <HI>last Insurrection</HI> of

and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rpose. It is no small Aggravation of the misery befalling a
place or person, when it is known to be brought about, by means of
their own p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ojecting; As sometimes was said to the Tyrant s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain by a

The things that the Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans are more <HI>eager to Trade for,</HI> being known to

<HI>Proverb.</HI></P>
<P>Besides all this, it hath been observed of many of these <HI>scattering
Plantations</HI> in our Borders, that many were contented to live without,
yea, desirous to shake off all <HI>yoke of Government,</HI> both <HI>sacred</HI> and <HI>Ci∣vil,</HI>
and so <HI>Transforming</HI> themselves as much as well they could into
the manners of the Indians they lived amongst, and are some of them
therefore <HI>most deservedly</HI> (as to <HI>Divine Iustice)</HI> left to be put under the
<HI>yoke and power</HI> of the Indians themselves, and hence it is that in many
parts, the <HI>people void of Councel and common prudence</HI> as well as <HI>Courage,</HI>
have so <HI>frightfully</HI> deserted, or <HI>Cowardly</HI> delivered up several places of
strength (though <HI>Tenable enough</HI> of themselves) into the hands of <HI>Con∣temptible
Enemies;</HI> and so like <HI>Ripe Figs</HI> upon the first sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king of the

<P>If it be here <HI>Objected,</HI> that the <HI>same</HI> or <HI>like Calamit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> have befallen
many of those places and persons; where no such Evils could justly be
complained of; It may as easily be Answered, and that from the obser∣vation

Confused Events of worldly Affairs, are oft times so limited and re∣strained
by the <HI>holy hand</HI> and <HI>wise Providence</HI> of God, that it is hard to

as deeply as others. I judge them not, yet hope, if they have ought
for which to judge themselves before him that searcheth the hearts,
they will take occasion hereby to humble themselves under the <HI>mighty

of all indiffer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and unconcerned persons about the like Troubles;

ordinarily hath been found amongst men. But as it is said, the

of our disappointments, and the loss of many of our Forces en∣gaging

there is more Courage seen in the <HI>Assaylants,</HI> than in the <HI>Defendants;</HI>
a few of our men have frequently defended the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>selves against <HI>multi∣tudes

to <HI>trouble the Wheels</HI> of our <HI>Motions,</HI> and fight against us, so as ordina∣rily
our people used not to want Courage: For at <HI>Lancaster</HI> where they
seemed to have had the greatest <HI>Cause of boasting</HI> for their Success in
any <HI>Assault</HI> (although it were since known, that they had <HI>five hundred</HI>
fighting men when they Assaulted that small Town of about <HI>fifty Fami∣lyes)</HI>
yet were they able to surprize but <HI>one garrison house,</HI> which nei∣ther
was <HI>fenced round,</HI> nor were the <HI>Defendants able</HI> to ply their shot
behind it, but so as the Enemy came to the <HI>very Walls</HI> and <HI>Roof</HI> on the
<HI>back side</HI> with their <HI>Fuel,</HI> or else they had never been able to have dis∣possessed
the Inhabitants. The same Indians within a while after, had
not been able to have done the mischief at <HI>Groaton</HI> which they did,
had not a <HI>Garrison</HI> been <HI>unadvisedly</HI> as it were delivered into their

<P>As for <HI>pred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions,</HI> or <HI>presages</HI> of these late Troubles,</P>
<P>Something of that nature hath been observed by some <HI>Iudicious per∣sons</HI>

<P>But for other <HI>predictions</HI> of the present Calamities, some <HI>wise men</HI>
have thought it not unworthy to be <HI>communicated to Posterity</HI> what hath
been observed amongst the Indians themselves, as if either <HI>God himself</HI>
had left some <HI>Impression</HI> on the minds of some of them this way, or that

<P>In the last place, upon the consideration of these late <HI>Vproars</HI> amongst

of the Natives,</HI> so much <HI>famed abroad,</HI> and what <HI>progress</HI> the
<HI>Gospet hath made</HI> amongst them, fearing (as well they may) it is like to
be not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle <HI>obstr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted</HI> hereby. It may probably be supposed, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>pious endeavours</HI> of some to preach the Gospel amongst several of the
<HI>Indian Natives,</HI> hath given the first occasion of the Quarrel, as usually
it hath done in the world, But that Opposition meeting with no <HI>better
Success</HI> in the <HI>Southern parts,</HI> than the Ruine of those that made the <HI>first
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bellion</HI> against us, Satan hath lately <HI>changed himself into an Angel of

<PB N="85" REF="000231_0244_0FA9ACE8901DA410"/>
For the chief Leader of those Indians is a <HI>Sagamore</HI> called <HI>Squando,</HI> who
hath (as is said by them that lately escaped from their hands <HI>familiar Con∣verse

and <HI>murther</HI> to be used against any they oppose, if they be <HI>willing
to yield,</HI> and in that way promising <HI>great Success to his Followers,</HI> what
the Issues of his proceedings will be, God only knows, and a little time
may discover. But for those that before these troubles have <HI>professed∣ly
owned the Christian Name,</HI> many of them have given <HI>notable proof</HI> of
their <HI>sincerity,</HI> by fighting against their, and out Enemies, and have been
very successful in their Endeavours: as well these in the <HI>upper parts of
Cape-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od,</HI> commonly called <HI>Cape Indians.</HI> as those about <HI>Natick,</HI> and
<HI>Hassinameset,</HI> within the <HI>Massachuset Iurisdiction.</HI> It is not my pur∣pose
to enlarge much on this hand, that I might not raise the expectation
of the world to greater matters than for the present do appear.</P>
<P>There are about <HI>six Societies of Indians</HI> in the Country, who have
<HI>professedly owned themselves Christians;</HI> In every one of which it is sup∣posed
there are some, that do make <HI>a serious profession</HI> of the Christian
Religion. The Salvation of whose Souls is worth far more pains and
cost than ever yet was laid out upon that work.</P>
<P>It is not a <HI>small thing,</HI> that in these <HI>dark places</HI> of the Earth, which
in all Ages past, since mankind had any knowledge thereof, have been
full of nothing but the <HI>habitations of Cruelty,</HI> the light of the Gospel
should <HI>take so much place,</HI> as to cause any number of those <HI>Vassa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Sa∣tan</HI>
where he so long hath had <HI>his Throne,</HI> professedly to <HI>owne</HI> the
Name of <HI>the Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> What Harvest is like to be of the <HI>Bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of them,</HI> in the <HI>present,</HI> or in the <HI>future time,</HI> is not for any of us to speak:
neither at what <HI>hour,</HI> or under what <HI>Viall,</HI> they shall be sent to <HI>labour in

of the Almighty,</HI> in whose hands are <HI>the times and Seasons of
grace,</HI> as well as of <HI>nature.</HI> There are many Nations in the world, to
this day, lying out from <HI>the Kingdome of the Lord Iesus,</HI> who were never
yet known professedly to <HI>owne his Scepter,</HI> although probably the Gospel
hath at some time or other been <HI>preached unto them,</HI> or sent amongst
them; It may be, only to be a <HI>Testimony unto them,</HI> and so to leave them
<HI>without excuse</HI> another day.</P>
<P>Whether any farther end in Reference to these amongst our selves is
aimed at, in the wise and <HI>unsearchable Counsels</HI> of the great God, is
known only to himself, and may be thought more convenient for him
that <HI>writes,</HI> and them that <HI>read the present Narrative,</HI> to leave to the

into that which is out of <HI>our Line,</HI> or beyond <HI>our Sphere.</HI> Thus much
without offence may be affirmed, that in all the <HI>habitable places of the
Earth,</HI>
whereever God <HI>hath,</HI> or ever <HI>had a People</HI> calling upon his
Name, never any notable work of Religion was known to take much
place, where some kind of Civility, and <HI>Culture of good manners,</HI> had
not gone before.</P>

they went: But I am no States man, nor love I to meddle with any
