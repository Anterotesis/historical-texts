<P>AMERICANS!<LB/>
BEAR IN REMEMBRANCE<LB/>
The HORRID MASSACRE!<LB/>
Perpetrated in King-Street, Boston,<LB/>
New-England,<LB/>
On the Evening of March the Fifth, 1770.<LB/>
When FIVE of your fellow countrymen,<LB/>
GRAY, MAVERICK, CALDWELL, ATTUCKS,<LB/>
and CARR,<LB/>
Lay wallowing in their Gore!<LB/>
Being <HI>basely,</HI> and most <HI>inhumanly</HI><LB/>
MURDERED!<LB/>
And SIX others badly WOUNDED!<LB/>
By a Party of the XXIXth Regiment,<LB/>
Under the command of Capt. Tho. Preston.<LB/>
REMEMBER!<LB/>
That Two of the MURDERERS<LB/>
Were convicted of MANSLAUGHTER!<LB/>
By a Jury, of whom I shall say<LB/>
NOTHING,<LB/>
Branded in the hand!<LB/>
And <HI>dismissed,</HI><LB/>
The others were ACQUITTED,<LB/>
And their Caption PENSIONED!<LB/>
Also,<LB/>
BEAR IN REMEMBRANCE<LB/>
That on the 22d Day of February, 1770.<LB/>
The infamous<LB/>
EBENEZER RICHARDSON, Informer,<LB/>
And tool to Ministerial hirelings,<LB/>
Most <HI>barbarously</HI><LB/>
MURDERED<LB/>
CHRISTOPHER SEIDER,<LB/>
An innocent youth!<LB/>
Of which crime he was found guilty<LB/>
By his Country<LB/>
On Friday April 20th, 1770;<LB/>
But remained <HI>Unsentenced</HI><LB/>
On Saturday the 22d Day of February, 1772.<LB/>
When the GRAND INQUEST<LB/>
For Suffolk county,<LB/>
Were informed, at request,<LB/>
By the Judges of the Superior Court,<LB/>
That EBENEZER RICHARDSON'S <HI>Case<LB/>
Then lay before his</HI> MAJESTY.<LB/>
Therefore said <HI>Richardson</HI><LB/>
This day, MARCH FIFTH! 1772,<LB/>
Remains UNHANGED!!!<LB/>
Let THESE things be told to Posterity!<LB/>
And handed down<LB/>
From Generation to Generation,<LB/>
'Till Time shall be no more!<LB/>
Forever may AMERICA be preserved,<LB/>
From weak and wicked monarchs,<LB/>
Tyrannical Ministers,<LB/>
Abandoned Governors,<LB/>
Their Underlings and Hirelings!<LB/>
And may the<LB/>
Machinations of artful, <HI>designing</HI> wretches,<LB/>
who would ENSLAVE THIS People,<LB/>
Come to an end,<LB/>
Let their NAMES and MEMORIES<LB/>
Be buried in eternal oblivion,<LB/>
And the PRESS,<LB/>
For a <HI>SCOURGE</HI> to Tyrannical Rulers,<LB/>
Remain FREE.</P>

<L>AWAKE my drowsy Thoughts! Awake my muse!</L>
<L>Awake O earth, and tremble at the news!</L>
<L>In grand defiance to the laws of God,</L>
<L>The Guilty, Guilty murd'rer walks abroad.</L>
<L>That city mourns, (the cry comes from the ground,)</L>
<L>Where law and justice never can be found:</L>
<L>Oh! sword of vengeance, fall thou on the race</L>
<L>Of those who hinder justice from its place.</L>
<L>O MURD'RER! RICHARDSON! with their latest breath</L>
<L>Millions will curse you when you sleep in death!</L>
<L>Infernal horrors sure will shake your soul</L>
<L>When o'er your head the awful thunders roll.</L>
<L>Earth cannot hide you, always will the cry</L>
<L>Of Murder! Murder! haunt you 'till you die!</L>
<L>To yonder grave! with trembling joints repair,</L>
<L>Remember, SEIDER'S corps lies mould'ring there;</L>
<L>There drop a tear, and think what you have done!</L>
<L>Then judge how you can live beneath the Sun.</L>
<L>A PARDON may arrive! You laws defy,</L>
<L>But Heaven's laws will stand when KINGS shall die.</L>
<L>Oh! Wretched man! the monster of the times,</L>
<L>You were not hung "by reason of <HI>old</HI> Lines,"</L>
<L><HI>Old</HI> Lines thrown by, 'twas then we were in hopes,</L>
<L>That you would soon be hu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g with <HI>new made</HI> Ropes;</L>
<L>But neither <HI>Ropes nor Lines,</HI> will satisfy</L>
<L>For SEIDER'S blood! But GOD is ever nigh,</L>
<L>And guilty souls will not unpunish'd go</L>
<L>Tho' they're excus'd by judges here below!</L>
<L>You are enlarg'd but cursed is your fate</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Cushing's</HI> eas'd you from the prison gate</L>
<L>The—<HI>Bridge</HI> of <HI>Tories,it</HI> has borne you o'er</L>
<L>Yet you e'er long may meet with HELL's dark shore.</L>
