<P>IT is much to be desired there might be extant <HI>A Compleat History of the United Colonies of New-England,</HI> that God may have the praise of his goodness to his People here, and that the present and future Generations may have the benefit thereof. This being not attainable for the present, nor suddenly to be expected, it is very expedient, that (while sundry of the Eldest Planters are yet living) <HI>Records</HI> and <HI>Memorials of Remarkable Providences</HI> be preserved and published, that the true Origi∣nals of these Plantations may not be lost; that <HI>New-England,</HI> in all time to come, may remember the day of her smallest things; and that there may be a furniture of <HI>Materials</HI> for a true and full History in after-times.</P>
<P>For these and such-like Reasons we are willing to Recommend unto the Reader this present <HI>Narrative</HI> as a Useful Piece. The Author is an ap∣proved godly man, and one of the first Planters at <HI>Plimouth;</HI> The Work it self is Compiled with Modesty of Spirit, Simplicity of Style, and Truth of Matter, containing the <HI>Annals</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> for the space of 47 years, with special reference to <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony, which was the first, and where the Author hath had his constant abode: And yet (so farre as his Intelligence did reach) relating many Remarkable Passages in the several Co∣lonies; and also making an honourable mention of divers of the most Eminent Servants of God that have been amongst us in several parts of the Country, after they had finished their course. We hope that the Labor of this good man will finde a general Acceptance amongst the People of God, and also be a means to provoke some or other in the rest of the Colonies (who have had the knowledge of things from the beginning) to Contribute their <HI>Observations</HI> and <HI>Memorials</HI> also; by which means, what is wanting in this <HI>Narrative,</HI> may be supplied by some others: and so in the issue, from divers <HI>Memorials</HI> there may be matter for a just <HI>History</HI> of <HI>New-England</HI> in the Lords good time. In the mean time, this may stand for a <HI>Monument,</HI> and be deservedly acknowledged as an <HI>Eben Ezer,</HI> that <HI>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us.</HI></P>

<P>THe consideration of the weight of Duty that lieth upon us, to Commemorize to future Generations the memorable passa∣ges of Gods Providence to us and our Pre∣decessors in the beginning of this Planta∣tion, hath wrought in me a restlesness of spirit, and ear∣nest desire, that something might be atchieved in that behalf, more (or at least otherwise) then as yet hath been done. Many discouragements I have met with, both from within and without my self: but reflecting upon the <HI>Ends</HI> I have proposed to my self in setting out in this Work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hath afforded me some support, <HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> The
<PB REF="000144_0004_0FA2B23A52EF59E0"/>
glory of God, and the good of present and future Genera∣tions.</HI> Being also induced hereunto, by the considera∣tion that your selves (especially some of you) are fully acquainted with many of the particulars, both concern∣ing <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Things,</HI> inserted in the following Nar∣rative, and can on your own knowledge assert them for Truth. Were it so that any other had travelled in this kinde, in such a way as might have conduced to a brief and satisfactory intelligence in particulars relating to the premises, I would have spared this labour, and have satisfied my self in perusal of their Works, rather then to have set pen to paper about the same; but having neither seen nor heard of any, especially respecting this our Plantation of <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> which God hath ho∣noured to be the first in this Land, I have made bold to present your Worships with, and to publish to the world something of the very <HI>first Beginnings</HI> of the great Actings of God in <HI>New-England,</HI> begun at <HI>New∣Plimouth:</HI> wherein, the greatest part of my intelligence hath been borrowed from my much honoured Uncle, Mr. <HI>William Bradford,</HI> and such Manuscripts as he left in his Study, from the year 1620, unto 1646; whom had God continued in this world some longer time, and given him rest from his other more important Affairs, we might probably have had these things from an abler Pen, and better digested, then now you may expect. Certain <HI>Diurnals</HI> of the honoured Mr. <HI>Edward Winslow,</HI> have also afforded me good light and help: and what from them both, and otherwise I have obtained, that I judged suitable for the following Discourse, I have with care and faithfulness related; and have therein more
<PB REF="000144_0005_0FA2B23BE753B020"/>
follicitously followed the truth of things (many of which I can also assert on my own knowledge) then I have studied quaintness in expressions.</P>
<P>I should gladly have spoken more particularly of the Neighbouring <HI>United Colonies,</HI> whose ends and aims in their Transplanting of themselves and Families, were the same with ours, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>The glory of God, the propagation of the Gospel, and enlargement of His Majesties Dominions;</HI> but for want of intelligence, and that I may not prevent a better Pen, I shall onely make mention of some of their Worthies that we have been most acquainted with.</P>
<P>I shall not insist upon the Clime nor Soyle of the Country, its Commodities or Discommodities; nor at large on the Natives, or their Customes and Manners: all which have been already declared by Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> Mr. <HI>Higginson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> and others. What it is, and what my aims at Gods glory, and my good affections to the place and people of whom I treat, may make it, I present your Worships with; Humbly craving your favourable aspect, and good acceptance of my poor Endeavours; and that my self and it may finde protection and shelter under the wings of your pious Pattonage, to defend us against such criticall and censorious eyes and tongues, as may either carp at my expressions, or misconstrue my intentions. The ample experience I have had of your undeserved Favour and Respect to me, in my many years Service of the <HI>Publick,</HI> and my observation in that time, that you have desired something of this nature might be done, hath encou∣raged me hereunto: your good acceptance whereof, shall ever oblige me to answerable returning of grati∣tude,
<PB REF="000144_0006_0FA2B23C79146188"/>
and administer to me further cause of thankful∣ness, That God hath given me an Habitation under your just and prudent Administrations; and wish for a Suc∣cession of such as may be skilfull to lead our <HI>Israel</HI> in this their peregrination; and when God shall take you hence, to receive the Crown of your labours and travels.

<HEAD>Grace and Peace be multiplied; With Profit by this following Narration.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentle Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I <HI>Have for some length of time looked upon it as a duty incumbent, especially on the immediate Successors of those that have had so large Experience of those many memorable and signall Demonstrations of Gods good∣ness, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> The first Beginners of this Plantation in</HI> New∣England, <HI>to commit to writing his gracious dispensations on that behalf; having so many inducements thereunto, not onely otherwise, but so plentifully in the Sacred Scriptures: That so,</HI> what we have seen, and what our fathers have <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 78.3 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> told us, we may not hide from our children, shewing to the generations to come the praises of the Lord; <HI>that espe∣cially</HI> the seed of Abraham his servant, and the children<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal.101.8 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> of Jacob his chosen, may remember his marvellous works <HI>in the beginning and progress of the planting of</HI>
<PB REF="000144_0008_0FA2B23E25CEE8C8"/>
New-England, his wonders, and the judgements of his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal.80.8,9.</NOTE> mouth: <HI>How that</HI> God brought a vine into this Wilder∣ness; <HI>that</HI> he cast out the Heathen and planted it; <HI>that</HI> he made room for it, and caused it to take deep root, and it filled the Land; <HI>so that</HI> it hath sent forth its boughs to the Sea, and its branches to the River. <HI>And not onely so, but also that</HI> He hath guided his people by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod.15.13.</NOTE> his strength to his holy Habitation, <HI>and planted them in the</HI> Mountain of his Inheritance, <HI>in respect of precious Gospel-Enjoyments. So that we may not onely look back to</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal.66.6.</NOTE> <HI>former Experiences of Gods goodness to our Predecessors, (though many years before) and so have our faith strength∣ned in the Mercies of God for our times; that so the Church being one</HI> Numerical Body, <HI>might not onely even for the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hosea 12 4.</NOTE> <HI>time</HI> he spake with us <HI>in our Forefathers, by many gracious manifestations of his glorious Attributes,</HI> Wisdome, Good∣ness, <HI>and</HI> Truth, <HI>improved for their good: but also rejoyce in present Enjoyments of both outward and spirituall mer∣cies, as fruits of their Prayers, Tears, Travels and La∣bours. That as especially God may have the glory of all, unto whom it is most due; so also some rayes of glory may reach the</HI> Names <HI>of those blessed Saints that were the main Instru∣ments of the beginning of this</HI> happy Enterprize.</P>
<P><HI>So then,</HI> gentle Reader, <HI>thou mayest take notice, that the main Ends of publishing this small</HI> History, <HI>is,</HI> That God may have his due praise, His Servants the Instru∣ments have their Names embalmed, and the present and future Ages may have the fruit and benefit of Gods great work, in the Relation of the first Planting of <HI>New England. Which Ends, if attained, will be great cause of rejoycing to the Publisher thereof, if God gives him

life, and opportunity to take notice thereof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Method <HI>I have observed, is (as I could) in some measure answerable to the ends forenamed, in inserting some Acknowledgements of Gods</HI> Goodness, Faithfulness, <HI>and</HI> Truth <HI>upon special occasions, with allusion to the Scriptures; and also taking notice of some special Instruments, and such main and special Particulars as were perspicuously remark∣able, in way of Commendation in them, so farre as my in∣telligence would reach; and especially in a faithful Com∣memorizing, and declaration of Gods wonderful works for, by, and to his people, in preparing a place for them, by dri∣ving out the Heathen before them; bringing them through a a Sea of Troubles; preserving and protecting them from, and in those dangers that attended them in their low estate, when they were strangers in the Land; and making this bowling Wilderness a Chamber of rest, safety, and pleasant∣ness, whiles the storms of his Displeasure have not onely tos∣sed, but endangered the overwhelming of great</HI> States <HI>and</HI> Kingdomes, <HI>and hath now made it to us a fruitful Land, sowed it with the seed of man and beast; but especially in giving us so long a peace, together with the Gospel of peace, and so great a freedome in our Civil and Religious Enjoy∣ments; and also in giving us hopes that we may be Instru∣ments in his hands, not onely of enlarging of our Princes Dominions, but to enlarge the Kingdome of the Lord Jesus, in the Conversion of the poor blinde</HI> Natives.</P>
<P><HI>And now,</HI> Courteous Reader, <HI>that I may not hold thee too long in the Porch, I onely crave of thee to reade this fol∣lowing Discourse with a single eye, and with the same ends as I had in penning it.

<HEAD>NEW-ENGLAND'S MEMORIAL: OR, A brief Relation of the most Remarkable Passages of the Providence of God manifested to the Planters of New-England in AMERICA.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">And first, of the beginning of the first Plantation in N.E. CALLED NEW-PLIMOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the usuall manner of the Dispensation of the Maje∣sty of Heaven, to work wonderfully by weak means for the effectuating of great things, to the intent that he may have the more Glory to himself: Many instances hereof might be produced, both out of the Sacred Scri∣ptures, and common Experience; and amongst many others of this kinde, the late Happy and Memorable Enterprize of the Planting of that part of <HI>America</HI> called <HI>New-England,</HI> de∣serveth to be Commemorized to future Posterity.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1602. divers godly Christians of our English Nation in the North of <HI>England,</HI> being studious of Refor∣mation, and therefore not onely witnessing against Humane Inventions, and Additions in the Worship of God, but minding most the positive and practical part of Divine Institutions, they entred into Covenant, To walk with God, and one with an∣other, in the enjoyment of the Ordinances of God, according
<PB N="2" REF="000144_0012_0FA2B242C62184E0"/>
to the Primitive Patern in the Word of God. But finding by experience they could not peaceably enjoy their own liberty in their Native Country, without offence to others that were dif∣ferently minded; they took up thoughts of removing them∣selves and their Families into the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> which accord∣ingly they endeavoured to accomplish, but met with great hinderance: yet after some time, the good hand of God re∣moving obstructions, they obtained their desires; arriving in <HI>Holland,</HI> they setled themselves in the City of <HI>Leyden,</HI> in the year 1610, and there they continued divers years in a com∣fortable condition, enjoying much sweet society and spiritual comfort in the wayes of God, living peaceably among them∣selves, and being courteously entertained, and lovingly re∣spected by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> amongst whom they were strangers, ha∣ving for their Pastor Mr. <HI>John Robinson,</HI> a man of a learned, polished, and modest spirit, pious and studious of the Truth, largely accomplished with sutable Gifts and Qualifications to be a Shepherd over this Flock of Christ; having also a fellow∣helper with him in the Eldership, Mr. <HI>William Brewster,</HI> a man of approved Piety, Gravity, and Integrity, very eminently fur∣nished with gifts sutable to such an Office.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding their amiable and comfortable carrying on, (as hath been said) although the Church of Christ on Earth in holy Writ, is sometimes called <HI>Heaven;</HI> yet there is alwayes in their most perfect state here in this lower world, very much wanting as to absolute and perfect happiness, which is onely reserved for the time and place of the full enjoyment of Celestial Glory: for, although this Church was at peace, and in rest at this time, yet they took up thoughts of removing themselves into <HI>America</HI> with common consent; the Proposi∣tion of removing thither being set on foot, and prosecuted by the Elders upon just and weighty grounds: for, although they did quietly and sweetly enjoy their Church-liberties under the <HI>States,</HI> yet they foresaw that <HI>Holland</HI> would be no place for their Church and Posterity to continue in comfortably, at least in that measure that they hoped to finde abroad; and
<PB N="3" REF="000144_0013_0FA2B2BC3351CD58"/>
that for these Reasons following, which I shall recite as received from themselves.</P>
<P>First, Because themselves were of a different Language from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> where they lived, and were setled in their way, in∣somuch that in ten years time, whiles their Church sojourned amongst them, they could not bring them to reform the neglect of Observation of the Lords-day as a Sabbath, or any other thing amiss amongst them.</P>
<P>Secondly, Because their Countrymen, who came over to joyn with them, by reason of the hardness of the Country, soon spent their Estates, and were then forced either to return back to <HI>England,</HI> or to live very meanly.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That many of their Children, through the extreme necessity that was upon them, although of the best dispositions, and graciously inclined, and willing to bear part of their Pa∣rents burthens, were oftentimes so oppressed with their heavy labours, that although their Spirits were free and willing, yet their Bodies bowed under the weight of the same, and became decrepid in their early youth, and the vigour of Nature con∣sumed in the very bud. And that which was very lamentable, and of all sorrows most heavy to be born, was, that many by these occasions, and the great licentiousness of Youth in that Coun∣try, and the manifold temptations of the place, were drawn away by evil examples into extravagant and dangerous courses, getting the reins on their necks, and departing from their Pa∣rents: Some became S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>diers, others took upon them farre Voyages by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> other-some worse courses tending to disso∣luteness, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> destruction of their Souls, to the great grief of their Parents, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the dishonour of God; and that the place being a place of great licentiousness and liberty to Children, they could not educate them, nor could they give them due correction without reproof or reproach from their Neigh∣bours.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The their Posterity would in few generations be∣come <HI>Dutch,</HI> and so lose their interest in the <HI>English</HI> Nation; they being desirous rather to enlarge His Majesties Dominions,
<PB N="4" REF="000144_0014_0FA2B2BD06A9C3C8"/>
and to live under their Naturall PRINCE.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This bath been graciously an∣swered fiace, by moving the hearts of many of his Servants to be very in∣strumental in this work, with some good suc∣cess, &amp; hopes of a further bles∣sing in that a∣spect.</HI></NOTE>Fifthly and lastly, and which was not the least, a great hope and inward Zeal they had of laying some good Foundation, or at least to make some way thereunto, for the propagating and ad∣vancement of the Gospel of the Kingdome of Christ in those remote parts of the World, yea although they should be but as stepping-stones unto others for the performance of so great a Work.</P>
<P>These and such like were the true Reasons of their removal, and not as some of their Adversaries did upon the rumour thereof, cast out slanders against them; as if the <HI>State</HI> was weary of them, and had rather driven them out, (as Heathen Histories have seigned of <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Israelites,</HI> when they went out of <HI>Egypt</HI>) then that it was their own free choice and motion.</P>
<P>I will therefore mention a particular or two, to evince the contrary.</P>
<P>And first, Although some of them were low in their Estates, yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> observing that they were diligent, faithful and careful of their engagements, had great respect to them, and strove for their custome.</P>
<P>Again, secondly, the Magistrates of the City of <HI>Leyàen</HI> where they lived, about the time of their coming away, in the publick place of Justice gave this commendable Testimony of them, in reproof of the <HI>Walloons</HI> who were of the <HI>French</HI> Church in the City; <HI>These English</HI> (said they) <HI>have lived now amongst us Ten years, and yet we never had any Suit or Accusation against them, or any of them; but your Strifes and Quarrels are con∣tinuall.</HI></P>
<P>The Reasons of their Removal above-named being debated first in private, and thought weighty, were afterwards pro∣pounded in publick; and after solemn dayes of Humiliation observed both in publick and in private, it was agreed, That part of the Church should go before their Brethren into <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> to prepare for the rest: and if in case the major part of
<PB N="5" REF="000144_0015_0FA2B2BE9D3789B8"/>
the Church did chuse to go over with the first, then the Pastor to go along with them; but if the major part stayed, that he was then to stay with them.</P>
<P>They having imployed sundry Agents to treat with several Merchants in <HI>England,</HI> who adventured some considerable Sums in a way of valuation to such as went personally on in the Voyage; the Articles of Agreement about the premises being fully concluded with the said Merchants, and sundry Dif∣ficulties and Obstructions removed, having also obtained <HI>Let∣ters Patents</HI> for the Northern parts of <HI>Virginia,</HI> of King <HI>James</HI> of Famous Memory; All things were got ready and provided, a small Ship was bought and fitted out in <HI>Holland,</HI> of about sixty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un, called <HI>The Speedwell,</HI> as to serve to transport some of them over, so also to stay in the Country, and attend upon Fishing, and such other affairs as might be for the good and benefit of the Colony when they came thither. Another Ship was hired at <HI>London,</HI> of Burthen about Ninescore, called <HI>The May-flower,</HI> and all other things got in a readiness: so being prepared to depart, they had a solemn day of Humilia∣tion, the Pastor teaching a part of the day very profitably and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Text of Scripture was</HI> Ezra 8.21.</NOTE> sutably to the present occasion, the rest of the time was spent in pouring out of Prayers unto the Lord with great fervency, mixed with abundance of tears; and the time being come that they must depart, they were accompanied with most of their Brethren out of the City, unto a Town called <HI>Del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Haven,</HI> where the Ship lay ready to receive them: so they left that goodly and pleasant City, which had been their resting place above eleven years; but they knew that they were <HI>Pilgrims and Strangers</HI> here below, and looked not much on these things, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 11.16.</NOTE> but lifted up their eyes to Heaven, their dearest Country, where <HI>God hath prepared for them a City,</HI> and therein quieted their spirits.</P>
<P>When they came to the place, they found the Ship and all things ready; and such of their Friends as could not come with them, followed after them, and sundry came from <HI>Am∣sterdam</HI> to see them shipt, and to take their leaves of them.
<PB N="6" REF="000144_0016_0FA2B2BF0E9DCA70"/>
One night was spent with little sleep with the most, but with friendly entertainment, and Christian discourse, and other reall expressions of true Christian love. The next day the wind being fair they went on Board, and their friends with them, where truely-doleful was the fight of that sad and mournful parting, to hear what sighs and sobs and prayers did found amongst them; what tears did gush from every eye, and pithy speeches pierced each others heart, that sundry of the <HI>Dutch</HI> strangers that stood on the Key as spectators, could not refrain from tears: yet comfortable and sweet it was, to see such lively and true expressions of dear and unseigned love. But the Tide (which stayes for no man) calling them away, that were thus loth to depart, their Reverend Pastor falling down on his knees, and they all with him, with watery cheeks commended them with most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervent Prayers unto the Lord and his blessing; and then with mutual imbraces, and many tears, they took their leaves one of another, which proved to be the <HI>last leave</HI> to many of them. Thus hoysing Sail with a prospe∣rous gale of wind, they came in short time to <HI>Southampton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This was about the second of July</HI> 1620.</NOTE> where they found the bigger Ship come from <HI>London,</HI> being ready with all the rest of their Company, meeting each other with a joyful welcome and mutual congratulation.</P>
<P>At their parting, their Pastor Mr. <HI>John Robinson</HI> wrote a Letter to the whole Company, which I thought meet here to insert, being so fruitfull in it self, and sutable to their occa∣sions.</P>

<PB N="7" REF="000144_0017_0FA2B2BFBA7EE638"/>
aside) having my better part with you: And although I doubt not but in your godly wisdomes you both foreset and resolve upon that which concerneth your present state and condition, both severally and joyntly; yet have I thought it but my duty to adde some further spur of provocation unto them who run already, if not because you need it, yet because I owe it in love and duty. And first, as we are daily to renew our Repentance with our God, especially for our sins known, and generally for our unknown trespasses: so doth the Lord call, us in a singular manner, upon occasions of such difficulty and danger as lieth upon you, to a both narrow search, and careful reformation of your wayes in his sight, left he calling to remembrance our sins forgotten by us, or unrepented of, take advantage against us, and in judgement leave us to be swallowed up in one danger or other: whereas on the contrary, sin being taken away by earnest Repentance, and the pardon thereof from the Lord sealed up to a mans Conscience by his Spirit, great shall be his security and peace in all dangers, sweet his comforts in all distresses, with happy de∣liverance from all evil, whether in life or death. Now next after this heavenly peace with God and our own Consciences, we are care∣fully to provide for peace with all men, what in us lyeth, especially with our Associates; and for that, watchfulness must be had that we neither at all in our selves do give, no nor easily take offence be∣ing given by others.</HI> Woe be to the world for offences, <HI>for al∣though it be necessary, considering the malice of Satan and mans corruption,</HI> that offences come, <HI>yet</HI> woe unto the man, <HI>or woman either,</HI> by whom the offence cometh, <HI>faith Christ,</HI> Match. 18.7. <HI>and if offences in the unseasonable use of things in themselves in∣different, be more to be feared then death it self, as the Apostle teacheth,</HI> I Cor. 9. 15. <HI>how much more in things simply evil, in which neither honour of God nor love of man is thought worthy to be regarded? Neither yet is it sufficient that we keep our selves by the grace of God from giving of offence, except withall we be armed against the taking of them when they are given by others: for how imperfect and lame is the work of Grace in that person, who wants Charity</HI> to cover a multitude of offences? <HI>as the Scripture speaks. Neither are you to be exhorted to this grace, 
<PB N="8" REF="000144_0018_0FA2B2C0A04F2DE0"/>
onely upon the common grounds of Christianity, which are, that persons ready to take offence, either want Charity to cover offences, or Wisdome duely to weigh humane frailties; or lastly, are gross though close Hypocrites, as Christ our Lord teacheth,</HI> Mat.7.1,2,3. <HI>as indeed, in my own experience few or none have been found which sooner give offence, then such as easily take it; neither have they ever proved sound and profitable Members in Societies, who have nourished this</HI> touchy humour. <HI>But besides these, there are divers Motives provoking you above others to great care and conscience this way; as first, there are many of you strangers as to the per∣sons, so to the infirmities one of another, and so stand in need of more watchfulness this way, left when such things fall out in men and women as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expected not, you be inordinately affected with them, which doth require at your hands much Wisdome and Cha∣rity for the cover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g and preventing of incident offences that way. And lastly, your intended course of Civil Community, will minister continuall occasion of offence, and will be as fewel for that fire, except you diligently quench it with</HI> brotherly forbearance: <HI>and if taking of offence causlesly or easily at mens doings, be so care∣fully to be avoided; how much more heed is to be taken that we take not offence at God himself? which yet we certainly do, so oft as we do murmure at his Providence in our crosses, or bear impatiently such afflictions as wherewith he is pleased to visit us. Store up therefore Patience against the evil day; without which, we take offence at the Lord himself in his holy and just works. A fourth thing there is carefully to be provided for;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That with your common Imployments, you joyn common Affections truely been upon the generall Good, avoiding as a deadly Plague of your both Com∣mon and Special Comforts, all retiredness of minde for proper ad∣vantage; and all singularly affected every manner of way, let every man repress in himself, and the whole Body in each person, as so many Rebels against the Common Good, all</HI> private respects of mens selves, <HI>not sorting with the general Convenience. And as men are careful not to have a new House shaken with any violence, before it be well settled, and the parts firmly knit: so be you, I beseech you Brethren, much more careful that the House of God
<PB N="9" REF="000144_0019_0FA2B324535A8760"/>
(which you are, and are to be) be not shaken with unnecessary No∣velties, or other Oppositions at the first setling thereof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly, Whereas you are to become a Body Politick, using a∣mongst your selves Civil Government, and are not furnished with persons of special Eminency above the rest, to be chosen by you into Office of Government; Let your wisdome and godliness appear not onely in choosing such persons as do intirely love, and will promote the Common Good; but also in yielding unto them all due Honour and Obedience in their lawful Administrations, not beholding in them the ordinariness of their persons, but Gods Ordinance for your good: not being like the foolish multitude, who more honour the gay Coat, then either the virtuous minde of the man, or the glorious Ordinance of the Lord: But you know better things, and that the Image of the Lords Power and Authority which the Magistrate beareth is honourable, in how mean persons soever; and this duty you may the more willingly, and ought the more conscionably to per∣form, because you are (at least for the present) to have them for your ordinary Governours, which your selves shall make choice of for that Work.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sundry other things of Importance I could put you in minde of, and of those before-mentioned in more words; but I will not so far wrong your godly mindes, as to think you heedless of these things, there being also divers amongst you so well able both to admonish themselves and others of what concerneth them. These few things therefore, and the same in few words, I do earnestly commend unto your Care and Conscience, joyning therewith my daily and incessant Prayers unto the Lord, That He who hath made the Heavens, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon the re∣ceipt of this let∣ter, the company was called to∣gether, and it was publickly read amongst them, which had good acceptation with all, and after fruit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></NOTE>the Earth, and Sea, and all Rivers of Waters, and whose Provi∣dence is over all his Works, especially over all his dear Children for good, would so guide and guard you in your wayes, as inwardly by his Spirit, so outwardly by the hand of his power, as that both you, and we also for and with you, may have after-matter of praising his Name all the dayes of your and our lives.

<HEAD>Of the Troubles that befell the first Planters upon the Coast of England, and in then Voyage in coming over into New England, and their arrival at Cape Cod, aliàs Cape James.</HEAD>
<P>ALl things being got ready, and every business dispatched, they ordered and distributed their Company for either Ship, (as they conceived for the best) and chose a Governour, and two or three Assistants for each Ship, to order the people by the way, and to see to the disposing of the Provision, and such like affairs; all which was not only with the liking of the Masters of the Ships, but according to their desires: which being done, they set Sail from <HI>Southampton</HI> the fifth of <HI>August,</HI> 1620. But alas, the best Enterprizes meet oftentimes with many discouragements; for they had not failed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arre, before Mr. <HI>Reynolds,</HI> the Master of the lesser Ship, complained that he found his Ship so leak, as he durst not put further to Sea: on which they were forced to put in at <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> the Master of the biggest Ship likewise putting in there with him; and the said lesser Ship was searched, and mended, and judged sufficient for the Voyage by the Workmen that mended her: On which, both the said Ships put to Sea the second time, but they had not sailed above an hundred Leagues, ere the said <HI>Reynolds</HI> again complained of his Ship being so leak, as that he feared he should founder in the Sea, if he held on; and then both Ships bore up again, and went in at <HI>Plimouth:</HI> but being there searched again, no great matter appeared, but it was judged to be the general weakness of the Ship. But the true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason of the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arding and delaying of matters was not as yet discerned: the one of them respecting the Ship (as after∣wards was found) was, that she was over Masted, which when she came to her trim in that respect, she did well, and made divers pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itable and successful Voyages. But secondly, and more especially, by the deceit of the Master and his Company,
<PB N="11" REF="000144_0021_0FA2B325E19EEF00"/>
who were hired to stay a whole year in the Country; but now fancying dislike, and fearing want of Victuals, they plotted this stratagem to free themselves, as afterwards was known, and by some of them confessed; for they apprehended that the greater Ship being of force, and in whom most of the Provi∣sions were bestowed, that she would retain enough for her self, whatsoever became of them and the Passengers: But so strong was self-love and deceit in this man, as he forgot all duty and former kindness, and dealt thus falsly with them. These things thus falling out, it was resolved by the whole to dismiss the lesser Ship, and part of the Company with her, and that the other part of the Company should proceed in the bigger Ship: which when they had ordered matters in reference thereunto, they made another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad parting the one Ship, (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR>) the lesser going back for <HI>London,</HI> and the other <HI>(<ABBR>viz.</ABBR>) The May-flower,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> being Master, proceeding on in the intended Voy∣age.</P>
<P>These troubles being blown over, and now all being com∣pact together in one Ship, they put to Sea again with a prospe∣rous wind: but after they had enjoyed fair winds for a season, they met with many contrary winds and fierce storms, with which their Ship was shrewdly shaken, and her upper works made very leaky, and one of the main Beams of the Mid-ships was bowed and cracked, which put them to some fear that she would not be able to perform the Voyage; on which the princi∣pal of the Seamen and Passengers had serious consultation what to do, whether to return or hold on: but the Ship proving strong under water, by a Screw the said Beam was brought into his place again; which being done, and well secured by the Carpenter, they resolved to hold their Voyage, and so after many boisterous storms in which they could bear no fail, but were forced to lye at Hull many dayes together; after long beating at Sea, they fell in with the land called <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Cape Cod</HI> the
<PB N="12" REF="000144_0022_0FA2B326780172B8"/>
which being made, and certainly known to be it, they were not a little joyful. After some little deliberation had amongst them∣selves with the Master of the Ship, they tacked about to stand to the Southward, to finde some place about <HI>Hudsons River,</HI> (according to their first intention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) for their Habitations: But they had not failed that Course above half a day, but they fell amongst perillous Sholes and Breakers, and they were so farre intangled therewith, as they conceived themselves in great dan∣ger; and the wind shrinking upon them withall, they resolved to bear up again for the Cape aforesaid: the next day, by Gods Providence, they got into the Cape harbour. Thus they ar∣rived at <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> alias <HI>Cape James,</HI> in <HI>November</HI> 1620. and being brought safe to land, they fell upon their knees and bles∣sed the God of Heaven, who had brought them over the vast and furious Ocean, and delivered them from many perils and miseries.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it is to be observed, that their putting into this place was partly by reason of a storm, by which they were forced in, but more especially by the fraudulency and contri∣vance of the aforesaid Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> the Master of the Ship: for, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of this Plot be twist the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch and Mr. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have had late and certain In∣telligence.</HI></NOTE> their Intentions, as is before-noted, and his Engagement, was to <HI>Hudsons River;</HI> but some of the <HI>Dutch</HI> having notice of their inten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, and having thoughts about the same time of erecting a Plantation there likewise, they fraudulently hired the said <HI>Jones</HI> by delayes while they were in <HI>England,</HI> and now un∣der pretence of the danger of the Sholes, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> to disappoint them in their going thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her: But God out-shoots Satan often∣times in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s own Bow, for had they gone to <HI>Hudsons River</HI> as before expressed, it had proved very dangerous to them: for although it is a place farre more commodious, and the Soil more fertile, yet then abounding with a multitude of pernicious Salvages, whereby they would have been in great peril of their lives, and so the work of transplanting the Gospel into these parts, much endangered to have been hindred and retarded: but God so disposed, that the place where they afterward setled was much depopulated by a great Mortality amongst the Na∣tives,
<PB N="13" REF="000144_0023_0FA2B327628CA678"/>
which fell out about two years before their arrival, whereby he made way for the carrying on of his good purpose in promulgating of his Gospel as aforesaid.</P>
<P>But before we pass on, let the Reader with me make a pause, and seriously consider this poor peoples present condition, the more to be raised up to admiration of Gods goodness towards them in their preservation: for being now passed the vast Ocean, and a sea of Troubles before in their Preparation, they had now no Friends to welcome them, no Inns to entertain or refresh them, no Houses, or much less Towns to repair unto to seek for succour: the <HI>Barbarians</HI> that <HI>Paul</HI> the Apostle fell amongst in his Shipwrack at the <HI>Isle M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lita, shewed him no small</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 29.</NOTE> <HI>kindness;</HI> but these Salvage <HI>Barbarians</HI> when they met with them (as after will appear) were readier to fill their sides full of Arrows, then otherwise: and for the season, it was Winter, and they that know the Winters of the Country, know them to be sharp and violent, subject to cruel and fierce Storms, dan∣gerous to travel to known places, much more to search un∣known Coasts. Besides, what could they see but a hideous and desolate Wilderness, full of wilde Beasts and wilde Men? and what multitudes of them there were, they then knew not: nei∣ther could they as it were go up to the Top of <HI>Pisgah,</HI> to view from this Wilderness a more goodly Country to feed their hopes; for which way soever they turned their eyes (save up∣ward to Heaven) they could have little solace or content in re∣spect of any outward object, for Summer being ended, all things stand in appearance with a weather-beaten face, and the whole Country full of Woods and Thickets, represented a wilde and salvage hew; if they looked behinde them, there was the mighty Ocean which they had passed, and was now as a main Bar and Gulph to separate them from all the Civil Parts of the World. The Master of the Ship and his Company pressing with speed to look out a place for their Settlement at some near distance, for the season was such as he would not stir from thence, untill a safe Harbour was discovered by them with their Boat: yea, it was sometimes threatned, that if they would not
<PB N="14" REF="000144_0024_0FA2B327F80A2548"/>
get a place in time, that they and their goods should be turned on shore, and that the Ship would leave them; the Master ex∣pressing himself, that Provisions spent apace, and that he would keep sufficient for himself and his Company for their return. It is true indeed, that the love and affections of their Brethren they left behinde them in <HI>Holland,</HI> was cordial and intire to∣wards them, but they had little power to help them or them∣selves: what could now sustain them but the Spirit of God and his grace? Ought not, and may not the Children of these Fathers <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psal.</HI> 107. 1,2, 4:5,8.</NOTE> rightly say, <HI>Our Fathers were English men, which came over this great Ocean, and were ready to perish in this Wilderness; but they cried unto the Lord, and he heard their voice, and looked on their adversity: Let them therefore praise the Lord, because he is good, and his mercy endureth for ever; yea, let them who have been the redeemed of the Lord shew how he hath delivered them from the hand of the oppressor, when they wandred in the desert Wilderness out of the way, and found no City to dwell in;</HI> both <HI>hungry and thirsty, their soul was overwhelmed in them:</HI> Let them therefore <HI>confess before the Lord his loving kindness, and his wonderful works before the children of men?</HI></P>

<P>Necessity now calling them to look out a place for Habita∣tion, as well as the Master and Mariners importunity urging them thereunto; while their Carpenter was trimming up of their Boat, sixteen of their men tendred themselves to go by land and discover those nearest places; which was accepted: and they being well armed, were sent forth on the sixteenth of <HI>November</HI> 1620. and having marched about a mile by the Sea∣side, they espied five <HI>Indians,</HI> who ran away from them, and they followed them all that day sundry miles, but could not come to speech with them: so night coming on, they betook themselves to their Rendezvouz, and set out their Sentinels, and rested in quiet that night; and the next morning they followed the <HI>Indians</HI> tracts, but could not finde them nor their dwellings, but at length lighted on a good quantity of clear ground near to a Pond of fresh water, where formerly the <HI>Indians</HI> had plant∣ed <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, at which place they saw sundry of their graves; and proceeding further, they found new Stubble where <HI>Indian</HI> Corn had been planted the same year; also they found where lately an house had been, where some Planks and a great Kettle was remaining, and heaps of sand newly paddled with their hands, which they digged up, and found in them divers fair <HI>Indian</HI> Baskets filled with Corn, some whereof was in Ears fair and good of divers colours, which seemed to them a very goodly sight, having seen none before: Of which Rarities they took some to carry to their friends on Shipboard, like as the
<PB N="17" REF="000144_0027_0FA2B32B02AAD0C8"/>
<HI>Israelites</HI> Spies brought from <HI>Eshcol</HI> some of the good fruits of the Land: but finding little that might make for their encou∣ragement as to situation, they returned, being gladly received by the rest of their Company.</P>
<P>After this, their Shallop being ready, they set out the second time for a more full Discovery of this place, especially a place that seemed to be an opening as they went into, the said Har∣bour some two or three Leagues off, which the Master judged to be a River; about thirty of them went out on this second Discovery, the Master of the Ship going with them: but upon the more exact discovery thereof, they found it to be no Har∣bour for Ships, but onely for Boats. There they also found two of their Houses covered with Mats, and sundry of their Implements in them; but the people ran away, and could not be seen: Also there they found more of their Corn and Beams of various colours; the Corn and Beams they brought away, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>About 6 months after they gave them full satis∣faction to their content.</HI></NOTE> purposing to give them full satisfaction when they should meet with any of them. And here is to be noted, a special and a great mercy to this people, that here they got them seed to plant them Corn the next year, or otherwise they might have starved, for they had none, nor any likelyhood to get any, un∣till <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A special Pro∣vidence of God to be noted.</HI></NOTE> the season had been past (as the sequel did manifest) neither is it likely that they had had this, if the first Discovery had not been made, for the ground was now all covered with Snow, and hard frozen; but the Lord is never wanting unto those that are his in their greatest needs. Let his holy Name have all the praise.</P>
<P>Having thus discovered this place, it was controverted a∣mongst them what to do, touching their abode and setling there. Some thought it best for many Reasons to abide there:</P>
<P N="1">1. Because of the Convenience of the Harbour for Boats, though not for Ships.</P>
<P N="2">2. There was good Corn-ground ready to their hands, as was seen by experience in the goodly Corn it yielded, which would again agree with the ground, and be natural seed for the same.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="000144_0028_0FA2B32BC40E6BF0"/>3. Cape <HI>Cod</HI> was like to be a place for good Fishing, for they saw daily great Whales of the best kinde for Oyl.</P>
<P N="4">4. The place was likely to be healthful, secure, and defensible.</P>
<P N="5">5. and lastly, The especial Reason was, that now the heart of Winter and unseasonable weather was come upon them, so as they could not go upon Coasting and Discovery, without danger of losing both men and Boat, upon which would follow the overthrow of all, especially considering what variable winds and sudden storms do there arise; also cold and wet lodging had so tainted their people, as scarce any of them were free from vehement Coughs, as if they should continue long, it would indanger the lives of many, and breed diseases &amp; infection amongst them. Again, that as yet they had some Provisions, but they would quickly be spent, and then they should have nothing to comfort them in their labour and toyl that they were like to undergo. At the first it was also conceived, whiles they had competent Victuals that the Ship would stay, but when that grew low, they would be gone, and let them shift for them∣selves.</P>
<P>Others again urged to go to <HI>Agawam,</HI> aliàs <HI>Angawam,</HI> a place about twenty Leagues off to the Northward, which they had heard to be an excellent Harbour for Ships, better ground, and better fishing.</P>
<P>Secondly, for any thing they knew there might be hard by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>About this time Mrs.</HI> Susanna White <HI>was de∣livered of a Son who was named</HI> Peregrine; <HI>he was the first of the English that was born in</HI> N.E. <HI>and still sur∣viveth, &amp; is the Lieutenant of the Military Company of</HI> Mathfield.</NOTE> us a farre better Seat, and it would be a great hinderance to feat where they should remove again.</P>
<P>But to omit many Reasons and Replies concerning this mat∣ter, it was in the end concluded to make some discovery within the Bay, but in no case so farre as <HI>Angawam.</HI> Besides, <HI>Robert Coppin</HI> their Pilot made relation of a great Navigable River, and good Harbour in the other Head-land of the Bay, almost right over against Cape <HI>Cod,</HI> being in a right line not much above eight Leagues distant, in which he had once been; and beyond that place they that were to go on discovery were en∣joyned not to go.</P>
<P>The Month of <HI>November</HI> being spent on these Affairs, and

having much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul weather; on the sixth of <HI>December</HI> they con∣cluded to send out their Shallop again on a third Discovery. The Names of those that went on this Discovery, were Mr. <HI>John Carver,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Bradford,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Winslow,</HI> Ca∣ptain <HI>Miles Standish,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Howland,</HI> Mr. <HI>Richard Warren,</HI> Mr. <HI>Steven Hopkins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Tilly,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Tilly,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> Mr. <HI>Coppin, John Atherton, Thomas English, Ed∣ward Doten,</HI> with the Master Gunner of the Ship, and three other of the common Seamen; these set sail on Wednesday the sixth of <HI>December</HI> 1620, intending to Circulate the deep Bay of Cape <HI>Cod,</HI> the weather being very cold, so as the Spra of the Sea lighting on their Coats, they were as if they had been glazed; notwithstanding, that night they got down into the bottom of the Bay, and as they drew near the shore they saw some ten or twelve <HI>Indians,</HI> and landed about a League off them, (but with some difficulty, by reason of the Sholes in that place) where they carried that night. In the morning they divided their Company to coast along, some on shore, and some in the Boat, where they saw the <HI>Indians</HI> had been the day before cutting up of a Fish like a <HI>Grampus;</HI> and so they ranged up and down all that day, but found no people, nor any place they liked as fit for their settlement: and that night they on shore met with their Boat at a certain Creek, where they made <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be a place called</HI> Namske∣ket.</NOTE> them a Barricado of boughs and logs for their lodging that night, and being weary betook themselves to their rest. The next morning about five of the clock (seeking guidance and protection from God by prayer) and refreshing themselves in way of preparation to persist on in their intended Expedition, some of them carried their Arms down to the Boat, having laid them up in their Coats from the moisture of the weather; but others said they would not carry theirs untill they went themselves: But presently all on a sudden, about the dawning of the day, they heard a great and strange cry, and one of their Company being on board, came hastily in, and cried, <HI>In∣dians, Indians,</HI> and withall their Arrows came flying amongst them; on which, all their men ran with speed to recover their
<PB N="20" REF="000144_0030_0FA2B32D41488978"/>
Arms (as by Gods good Providence they did.) In the mean time, some of those that were ready discharged two Muskets at them, and two more stood ready at the entrance of their Ren∣dezvouz, but were commanded not to shoot, untill they could take full aim at them; and the other two charged again with all speed, for there were onely four that had Arms there, and defended the Barricado which was first assaulted. The cry of the <HI>Indians</HI> was dreadful, especially when they saw their men run out of their Rendezvouz towards the Shallop to recover their Arms; the <HI>Indians</HI> wheeling about upon them: but some running out with Coats of Mail, and Cuttle-axes in their hands, they soon recovered their Arms, and discharged amongst them, and soon stayed their violence. Notwithstanding, there was a lusty man, and no less valiant, stood behinde a Tree within half a Musket shot, and let fly his Arrows amongst them: he was seen to shoot three Arrows, which were all avoided, and stood three shot of a Musket, untill one taking full aim at him, made <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> the Bark or Splinters of the Tree fly about his ears; after which he gave an extraordinary shriek, and away they went all of them: and so leaving some to keep the Shallop, they fol∣lowed them about a quarter of a mile, that they might conceive that they were not afraid of them, or any way discouraged.</P>
<P>Thus it pleased God to vanquish their Enemies, and to give them deliverance, and by his special Providence so to dispose, that not any one of them was either hurt or hit, though their Arrows came close by them; and sundry of their Coats which hung up in the Barricado were shot through and through: for which salvation and deliverance they rendred solemn Thanks∣giving unto the Lord.</P>
<P>From hence they departed, and coasted all along, but discern∣ed no place likely for Harbour, and therefore hasted to the place their Pilot (as aforesaid) told them of, who assured them that there was a good Harbour, and they might fetch it before night: of which they were glad, for it began to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul wea∣ther.</P>
<P>After some hours failing it began to Snow and Rain, and
<PB N="21" REF="000144_0031_0FA2B32F4C351388"/>
about the middle of the Afternoon the wind increased, and the Sea became very rough, and they brake their Rudder, and it was as much as two men could do to steer the Boat with a couple of Oars; but the Pilot bid them be of good chear, for he saw the Harbour: but the storm increasing, and night drawing on, they bare what sail they could to get in while they could see: but herewith they brake their Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in three pieces, and their Sail fell over-board in a very grown Sea, so as they had like to have been cast away; yet by Gods mercy they re∣covered themselves, and having the flood with them, struck into the Harbour. But when it came to, the Pilot was deceived in the place, and said, <HI>Lord be merciful to us, my eyes never saw this place before:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This was be∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>the place called</HI> the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ners Nose <HI>and</HI> Sagaquab, <HI>by the mouth of</HI> Plimouth <HI>har∣bour.</HI></NOTE> and he and the Masters Mate would have run the Boat ashore in a Cove full of Breakers before the wind, but a lusty Seaman which steered bade them that rowed, <HI>If they were men, about with her, else they were all cast away;</HI> the which they did with all speed: so he bade them <HI>be of good chear, and row hard, for there was a fair Sound before them, and he doubted not but they should finde one place or other where they might ride in safety.</HI> And although it was very dark, and rained sore, yet in the end they got under the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a small Island, and remained <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This was after∣wards called</HI> Clarks Island, <HI>because Mr.</HI> Clark <HI>the Ma∣sters Mate first stepped on shore there o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE>. there all night in safety. But they knew not this to be an Island untill the next morning, but were divided in their mindes, some would keep the Boat, doubting they might be amongst the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> others were so wet and cold they could not endure, but got on shore, and with much difficulty got fire, and so the whole were refreshed, and rested in safety that night. The next day rendring thanks to God for his great deliverance of them, and his continued merciful good Providence towards them, and finding this to be an Island, it being the last day of the week, they resolved to keep the Sabbath there.</P>
<P>On the second day of the week following they founded the Harbour, and found it fit for Shipping, and marched into the Land, and found divers Corn fields, and little running Brooks, a place (as they supposed) fit for Situation, at least it was the best that they could finde, and the season and their present ne∣cessity
<PB N="22" REF="000144_0032_0FA2B32F7857C848"/>
made them glad to accept of it. So they returned again to their Ship with this News to the rest of their people, which did much comfort their hearts.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth of <HI>December</HI> they weighed Anchor, to go to the place they had discovered, and arrived the sixteenth day in the Harbour they had formerly discovered, and afterward took better view of the place, and resolved where to pitch their Dwellings; and on the Five and twentieth day of <HI>December</HI> began to erect the first House for common use, to receive them and their goods: and after they had provided a place for their goods and common store (which was long in unlading for want of Boats, and by reason of foulness of the winter wea∣ther, and sickness of divers) they began to build some small Cottages for Habitation, as time would admit; and also con∣sulted of Laws and Orders both for their <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Military Government,</HI> as the necessity of their present condition did re∣quire. But that which was sad and lamentable, that in two or three Moneths time half of their Company died, especially in <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> being the depth of Winter, wanting houses and other comforts, being infected with the Scurvy, and other Diseases, which this long Voyage and their incommodate condition had brought upon them, so as there died sometimes two, sometimes three on a day in the aforesaid time, that of One hundred and odde persons, scarce Fifty remained. Amongst others in the time fore-named, died Mr. <HI>William Mullins,</HI> a man pious and well-deserving, endowed also with a consider∣able outward Estate; and had it been the will of God that he had survived, might have proved an useful Instrument in his place, with several others who deceased in this great and com∣mon affliction, whom I might take notice of to the like effect. Of those that did survive in this time of distress and calamity that was upon them, there was sometimes but six or seven sound persons, who (to their great commendation be it spoken) spared no pains night nor day to be helpful to the rest, not shunning to do very mean services to help the weak and impo∣tent. In which Sickness the Seamen shared also deeply, and
<PB N="23" REF="000144_0033_0FA2B331E313F718"/>
many died, to about the one half of them before they went∣away. Thus being but few, and very weak, this was an op∣portunity for the Salvages to have made a prey of them, who were wont to be the most cruel and treacherous people in all these parts, even like Lions, but to them they were as Lambs, God striking a dread in their hearts, so as they received no harm from them. The Lord also so disposed, as aforesaid, much to waste them by a great Mortality, together with which were their own Civil Dissentions, and Bloody Wars, so as the twentieth person was scarce left alive when these people arrived, there remaining sad spectacles of that Mortality in the place where they seated, by many bones and skulls of the dead lying above-ground; whereby it appeared, that the living of them were not able to bury their dead. Some of the ancient <HI>Indians</HI> that are surviving at the writing hereof, do affirm, That about some two or three years before the first <HI>English</HI> here arrived, they saw a <HI>Blazing Star</HI> or <HI>Comet,</HI> which was a fore-runner of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be the same that was seen about that time in</HI> Europe.</NOTE> this sad Mortality, for soon after it came upon them in ex∣tremity. Thus God made way for his people, by removing the Heathen, and planting them in the Land; yet we hope in mer∣cy to some of the posterity of these poor blinde Salvages, by being means (at least stepping-stones) for others to come and Preach the Gospel amongst them: of which afterwards in its more proper place. But to return.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> after their arrival would shew themselves afarre off, but when they endeavoured to come near them, they would run away. But about the sixteenth of <HI>March,</HI> 1621. a certain <HI>Indian</HI> called <HI>Samoset</HI> came boldly amongst them, and spake to them in broken English, which yet they could well un∣derstand, at which they marvelled: but at length they under∣stood that he belonged to the Eastern parts of the Country; and had acquaintance with sundry of the <HI>English</HI> Fishermen, and could name sundry of them, from whom he learned his language. He became very profitable to them, in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the Country in the Eastern parts, as also of the people here; of their Names
<PB N="24" REF="000144_0034_0FA2B333E7C21DA8"/>
Number, and Strength, of their Situation, and Distance from this place, and who was Chief amongst them: He told them also of another <HI>Indian</HI> called <HI>Squanto,</HI> aliàs <HI>Tisquantam,</HI> one of this place, who had been in <HI>England,</HI> and could speak better English then himself: And after courteous entertainment of him, he was dismissed. Afterwards he came again, with some other Natives, and told them of the coming of the great <HI>Sachem</HI> named <HI>Massasoiet,</HI> who (about four or five dayes after) came with the chief of his Friends and other Attendants, with the aforesaid <HI>Squanto,</HI> with whom (after friendly entertainment and some gifts given him) they made a League of Peace with him, which continued with him and his Successors to the time of the writing hereof. The terms and Conditions of the said League is as followeth:</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more in the year</HI> 1639.</NOTE> I. T<HI>Hat neither he, nor any of his, should injure or do hurt to any of their people.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That if any of his did any hurt to any of theirs, he should send the Offender that they might punish him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>That if any thing were taken away from any of theirs, he should cause it to be restored; and they should do the like to his.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>That if any did unjustly War against him, they would all him; and if any did War against them, he should aid them.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>That he should send to his Neighbour-Confederates, to cer∣tifie them of this, that they might not wrong them, but might be likewise comprised in these Conditions of Peace.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>That when his Men came to them upon any occasion, they should leave their Arms</HI> (which were then Bowes and Arrows) 
<HI>behinde them.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. Lastly, <HI>That so doing, their Soveraign Lord King</HI> James <HI>would esteem him as His Friend and Ally.</HI></P>
<P>All which he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked well, and withall at the same time acknow∣ledged himself content to become the Subject of our Soveraign Lord the King aforesaid, His Heirs and Successors; and gave unto them all the Lands adjacent, to them and their Heirs for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="000144_0035_0FA2B335EE2CCD00"/>After these things he returned to his place called <HI>Sowams,</HI> about fourty miles distant from <HI>Plimouth,</HI> but <HI>Squanto</HI> conti∣nued with them, and was their Interpreter, and proved a spe∣cial Instrument sent of God for their good beyond expectation; he directed them in Planting their Corn, where to take their Fish, and to procure their Commodity; and also was their Pilot to bring them to unknown places for their profit, and never left them untill his death: He was a Native of this place where <HI>Plimouth</HI> is, and scarce any left besides himself. He was carried away (with divers others) by one named <HI>Hunt,</HI> a Master of a Ship, who thought to sell them for Slaves in <HI>Spain,</HI> but he got away for <HI>England,</HI> and was entertained by a Merchant in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This Merchants name was Mr.</HI> Slaney.</NOTE> <HI>London,</HI> and imployed to <HI>Newfound-land</HI> and other parts; and at last brought hither into these parts by one Mr. <HI>Dermer,</HI> a Gentleman imployed by Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges</HI> and others, for Discovery, and other Designs in these parts: of whom I shall say something, because it is mentioned in a Book set forth <HI>Anno</HI> 1622. by the President and Council for <HI>New-England, That he made the Peace between the Salvages of these parts and the English, of which this Plantation</HI> (as it is intimated) <HI>had the benefit:</HI> and what a Peace it was, may appear by what befell him and his men.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>Dermer</HI> was here the same year that these people came, as appears by a Relation written by him, bearing date <HI>June</HI> 30. <HI>Anno</HI> 1620. and they arrived in the Country in the Month of <HI>November</HI> following, so that there was but four Months difference: In which Relation to his honoured Friend, he hath these passages of this very place where <HI>New-Plimouth</HI> is; <HI>I will first begin</HI> (faith he) <HI>with that place from whence</HI> Squanto, <HI>or</HI> Tisquantam <HI>was taken away, which in Captain</HI> Smiths <HI>Map is called</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>This name of</HI> Plimouth <HI>was so called not on∣ly for the reason here named, but also because</HI> Pli∣mouth <HI>in</HI> O.E. <HI>was the last town they left in their Native Country; &amp; for that they recei∣ved many kind∣nesses from some Christians</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> Plimouth, <HI>and I would that</HI> Plimouth <HI>had the like Commodities. I would that the first Plantation might here be seated, if there come to the number of Fifty persons, or up∣wards; otherwise at</HI> Charlton, <HI>because there the Salvages are less to be feared. The</HI> Pocanakets, <HI>which live to the West of</HI> Pli∣mouth, <HI>bear an inveterate malignity to the</HI> English, <HI>and are of
<PB N="26" REF="000144_0036_0FA2B3366994A740"/>
more strength then all the Salvages from thence to</HI> Panobskut: <HI>Their desire of Revenge was occasioned by an</HI> English-man, <HI>who having many of them on Board, made great slaughter of them with their Murderers and small Shot, when (as they say) they</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Note</HI></NOTE> <HI>offered no injury on their parts. Whether they were</HI> English <HI>or no, it may be doubted; yet they believe they were, for the</HI> French <HI>have so possest them: for which cause</HI> Squanto <HI>cannot deny but they would have killed me when I was at</HI> Namassaket, <HI>had he not intreated hard for me. The Soyl of the Borders of this great Bay, may be compared to most of the Plantations which I have seen in</HI> Vir∣ginia. <HI>The land is of divers sorts; for</HI> Patukset <HI>is an heavy but strong Soyl,</HI> Nauset <HI>and</HI> Satukket <HI>are for the most part a blackish and deep Mould, much like that where groweth the best Tobacco in</HI> Virginia. <HI>In the bottom of the Bay is great store of Cod, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mullet,</HI> &amp;c. And above all, he <HI>commends</HI> Pacannaket <HI>for the richest Soyl, and much open ground, likely and fit for English Grain.</HI> Massachusets <HI>is about nine leagues from</HI> Plimouth, <HI>and situate in the mids: between both is many</HI> Islands <HI>and</HI> Peninsuls, <HI>very fertile for the most part.</HI> With sundry such Relations, which I forbear to transcribe, being now better known then they were to him.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was taken Prisoner by the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Man∣namoset,</HI> (a place not farre from <HI>Plimouth,</HI> now well known) he gave them what they demanded for his liberty; but when they had got what they desired, they kept him still, and endea∣voured to kill some of his men, but he was freed by seizing on some of them, and kept them bound till they gave him a Ca∣nooes load of Corn: Of which see <HI>Purch, hb.</HI> 9. <HI>fol.</HI> 1778. But this was <HI>Anno</HI> 1619.</P>
<P>After the writing of the former Relation, he came to the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Isle <HI>Capewak,</HI> which lieth South from this place in the way to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the aforesaid <HI>Squanto</HI> with him; where he going on shore amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> to trade, as he used to do, was assaulted and betrayed by them, and all his men slain, but one that kept the Boat: but himself got on Board very sore wound∣ed, and they had cut off his Head upon the Cuddy of the Boat,
<PB N="27" REF="000144_0037_0FA2B33703992C50"/>
had not his Man rescued him with a Sword, and so they got away, and made shift to get into <HI>Virginia,</HI> where he died, whe∣ther of his wounds, or the Diseases of the Country, or both, is uncertain. By all which it may appear how farre this people were from Peace, and with what danger this Plantation was begun, save as the powerful hand of the Lord did protect them.</P>
<P>These things were partly the Reasons why the <HI>Indians</HI> kept aloof, as aforesaid, and that it was so long ere they could come to speech with any of them: Another Reason (as afterwards themselves made known) was, how that about three years be∣fore these first Planters arrived, a certain <HI>French</HI> Ship was cast away at <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> but the men got on shore, and saved their lives, and much of their Victuals and other goods; but after∣wards the <HI>Indians</HI> heard of it, and gathered together from these parts, and never left watching and dogging them, untill they got advantage, and kill'd them all but three or four, which they kept and sent from one <HI>Sachem</HI> to another to make sport with them, and used them worse then Slaves; and they con∣ceived this Ship was now come to revenge it. Two of the said <HI>French</HI> so used were redeemed by the aforesaid Mr. <HI>Dermer,</HI> the other died amongst the <HI>Indians:</HI> and as the <HI>Indians</HI> have reported, one of them lived amongst them untill he was able to discourse with them, and told them, <HI>That God was angry with them for their wickedness, and would destroy them, and give their Country to another people, that should not live like beasts as they did, but should be clothed,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> But they derided him, and said, <HI>That they were so many that God could not kill them.</HI> His answer was, <HI>That though they were never so many, God had many wayes to destroy them that they knew not.</HI> Shortly after his death came <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> the Plague, a Disease they never heard of before, and mightily swept them away, and left them as dung upon the earth (as you have heard.) Not long after came the <HI>English</HI> to <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> and then several of the <HI>Indians</HI> began to minde the <HI>French-mans</HI> words, thinking him to be more then an ordinary man. And as the first part of his speech had proved true, they began to
<PB N="28" REF="000144_0038_0FA2B337CB488CC0"/>
be apprehensive of the latter, <HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> The loss of their Country.</HI> This Relation the first Planters at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> after they came to be acquainted with them, several of them heard from divers of their ancient and gravest <HI>Indians,</HI> and have often seen the place where the <HI>French</HI> were surprised and taken; which place beareth the Name of <HI>Frenchmans Point</HI> with many to this day. This Relation for the verity thereof, being also very observe∣able, was thought meet to be here inserted: And let me adde <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>General instan∣ds of the Mor∣tality of the In∣dians occasio∣nall: taken no∣tice of.</HI></NOTE> a word hereunto; That it is very observable likewise, That God hath very evidently made way for the <HI>English,</HI> by sweep∣ing away the Natives by some great Mortalities; as first, by the <HI>Plague</HI> here in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Jurisdiction; secondly, by the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> a very con∣siderable people a little before the <HI>English</HI> came into the Coun∣try; as also at <HI>Conecticot,</HI> very full of <HI>Indians</HI> a little before the <HI>English</HI> went into those parts; and then the <HI>Pequots</HI> by the Sword of the <HI>English</HI> (as will appear in its place) and the Coun∣try now mostly possessed by the <HI>English.</HI> I might also mention several places in the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> peopled with considerable companies of proper able men, since the first Planters thereof came over, even in our sight, before they were in a capacity to improve any of their land, that have by the same hand of Providence been cut off, and so their Land even cleared for them, and now so replenished with their Po∣sterity, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 28, 7 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 30.</NOTE> that places are too straight for them. <HI>BY little and little</HI> (faith God of old to his people) <HI>will I drive them out from be∣fore thee, till thou be increased, and inherit the Land.</HI></P>
<P>But before I pass on, let the Reader take notice of a very remarkable particular, which was made known to the said Planters at <HI>Plimouth</HI> some short space after their arrival, That the <HI>Indians,</HI> before they came to the <HI>English</HI> to make Friend∣ship <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Behold how Sa∣tan laboured to hinder the Go∣spel from coming into</HI> N.E.</NOTE> with them, they got all the <HI>Powaws</HI> in the Country, who for three dayes together in a horrid and devillish manner did Curse and Execrate them with their Conjurations: which Assembly and Service they held in a dark and dismall Swamp.

<P><PB N="29" REF="000144_0039_0FA2B338804CB8A0"/>The Spring being now come, it pleased God that the Mor∣tality which had taken away so many of the first Planters at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> ceased, and the Sick and Lame recovered apace, which was as it were a new life put into them; they having born this Affliction with much patience, being upheld by the Lord.

Now followeth several Passages of the Providence of God to, and the further progress of the first Planters at Pli∣mouth, appertaining to the Year 1621.</P>
<P>THey now began to hasten the Ship away, which carried so long by reason of the necessity and danger that lay on them, because so many died both of themselves, and the Ships Company likewise; by which they became so few, as the Master durst not put out to Sea, untill those that lived recovered of their Sickness, and the Winter over.</P>
<P>The Spring of this year they Planted their first Corn in <HI>New-England,</HI> being instructed in the manner thereof by the fore-named <HI>Squanto:</HI> they likewise sowed some <HI>English</HI> Grain with little success, by reason partly of the badness of the Seed, and lateness of the season, or some other defect not then discerned.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>April</HI> in this year, their Governour Mr. <HI>John Carver</HI> fell sick, and within a few dayes after died, whose death was much lamented, and caused great heaviness amongst them; and there was indeed great cause. He was buried in the best manner they could, with as much Solemnity as they were in a capacity to perform, with the Discharge of some Volleys of shot of all that bare Arms. This worthy Gentle∣man was one of singular Piety, and rare for Humility, as ap∣peared by his great condescendency, when as this poor misera∣ble people were in great sickness and weakness, he shunned not to do very mean services for them, yea the meanest of them: He bare a share likewise of their labour in his own person, ac∣cordingly as their extreme necessity required; who being one also of a considerable Estate, spent the main part of it in this Enterprize, and from first to last approved himself not onely as their Agent in the first transacting of things, but also all along to the period of his life, to be a pious, faithful, and very benefi∣cial Instrument, and now is reaping the fruit of his labour with the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="000144_0041_0FA2B33A02F5FEE0"/>His Wife who was also a gracious woman, lived not six weeks after him: shee being overcome with excessive grief for the loss of so gracious an Husband, likewise died.</P>
<P>In some short distance of time after this, Mr. <HI>William Bradford</HI> was chosen Governour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> in his stead, being not as yet well recovered of his weakness, having bin at the point of death, and Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Allerton</HI> likewise was chosen to be his Assistant.</P>
<P>The second of <HI>July</HI> in this year they sent Mr. <HI>Edward Winslow</HI> and Mr. <HI>Steven Hopkins,</HI> unto the great Sachem <HI>Massasciet</HI> a∣foresaid, with a gratuitie to congratulate with him, and to view his Country, and likewise to take notice of what strength of men he had, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> having <HI>Squanto</HI> for their guide: who found his place to be about forty Miles from <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> his People few in comparison of what they had been, by reason of the mortality amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> forementioned. These brought word upon their return of the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> a People that li∣ved on the otherside of that great Bay, which are a People strong and many in number, living compact together, and had not at all been touched with the wasting Plague before-specified. They also brought a full intelligence in reference unto the par∣ticulars they were sent about, and so returned in safety.</P>
<P>Thus their peace being well established with the <HI>Natives</HI> a∣bout them, which was much furthered by an <HI>Indian</HI> named <HI>Ho∣bamak,</HI> who came to live amongst the <HI>English;</HI> he being a proper lusty young man, and one that was in account amongst the <HI>In∣dians</HI> in those parts for his valour, continued faithful and con∣stant to the <HI>English</HI> until his death. He with the said <HI>Squanto</HI> being sent amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> about business for the <HI>English,</HI> were surprized by an <HI>Indian Sachem</HI> named <HI>Corbitant,</HI> who was no friend to the <HI>English;</HI> he met with them at <HI>Namassaket,</HI> and began to quarrel with them, and offered to stab <HI>Hobamak,</HI> who being a strong man, soon cleared himself of him; and with speed came and gave intelligence to the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> saying, <HI>he feared that</HI> Squanto <HI>was slain,</HI> for they were both threatned, and for no other cause, but that they were friends to the <HI>English,</HI> and serviceable to them. On which it was thought
<PB N="32" REF="000144_0042_0FA2B33B4A139318"/>
meet to vindicate their Messengers, and not to suffer them to be thus wronged, and it was concluded to send some men to <HI>Namassaket</HI> well armed, and to fall upon them: whereupon fourteen men being well prepared were sent, under the conduct of Captain <HI>Miles Standish,</HI> who when they came thither beset the house, and the said Captain entred into the same to look for the said <HI>Corbitant,</HI> but he was fled, and so they missed of him; but understood that <HI>Squanto</HI> was alive; so they withheld, and did no hurt, save three of the <HI>Natives</HI> pressing out of the house when it was beset, were sorely wounded; which they brought home to their Town with them, and were dressed by their Chirurgion, and cured.</P>
<P>After this they had many Congratulations from divers <HI>Sa∣chems,</HI> and much firmer peace, yea those of the Isle of <HI>Capewak</HI> sent to make friendship with them, and this <HI>Corbitant</HI> himself used the mediation of <HI>Massasoiet</HI> to make his peace, but was shie to come near them a long time after.</P>
<P>After this, on the eighteenth of <HI>September</HI> they sent out their Boat to the <HI>Massachusets</HI> with ten men, and <HI>Squanto</HI> for their Interpreter, to discover and view that Bay, and to trade with the <HI>Natives;</HI> and found kinde entertainment with them, who expressed themselves to be much afraid of the <HI>Tarateens,</HI> a peo∣ple in the Eastern part of <HI>New-England,</HI> which used to come in Harvest time and take away their corn, and many times kill some of their people; who after they had accomplished their business, returned in safety, and made report of the place, wishing they had been there seated. But the Lord who assigns to all men the bounds of their habitations, had appointed it for another end and use.</P>
<P>And thus they found the Lord to be with them in all their wayes, and to bless their out-goings and in-comings: for which let his holy Name have the praise for ever.</P>
<P>Being now well recovered in respect of health (as hath been said) they began to fit up their buildings against winter, and received in their first harvest, and had great plenty of fowl and fish, to their great refreshing.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="000144_0043_0FA2B33BCA8D89C0"/>About the ninth of <HI>November</HI> came in a small ship to them <HI>This ship was called</HI> the For∣tune, <HI>in which came no Provi∣sions which was one cause of a great famine that bef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Plantation of</HI> NewPlimouth <HI>soon after.</HI> unexpected, in which came Mr. <HI>Robert Cushman,</HI> who was both a godly man and an active and faithful agent, and useful instru∣ment in the common interest of this first design; and there came with him in that ship, thirty five persons, to remain and live in the Plantation: which did not a little rejoyce the first planters. And these when they came on shore, and found all well, and saw plenty of provisions beyond their expectation, were also satisfied and no less glad: for coming in at <HI>Cape Cod</HI> before they came to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and seeing nothing there but a barren place; they then began to think what should become of them, if the People were dead or cut off by the <HI>Indians;</HI> and began to consult upon some passages, which some of the Seamen had cast out, to take the Sails from the Yard, left the ship should get away and leave them: but the Master hearing thereof, gave them good words, and told them, <HI>If any thing but well should have befallen the People at</HI> Plimouth, <HI>he hoped he had provisions enough to carry them to</HI> Virginia, <HI>and whiles he had any, they should have their part;</HI> which gave them good satisfaction.</P>
<P>This ship stayed at <HI>Plimouth</HI> not above fourteen dayes, and returned; and soon after her departure, the People called the <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> aforesaid, sent a messenger unto the Plantation, with a bundle of Arrows, tyed together with a Snakes skin, which their Interpreter <HI>Squanto</HI> told them was a threatning and a challenge; upon which the Governour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> sent them a rough answer, (<HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR>) That if they loved war rather then peace, they might begin when they would, they had done them no wrong, neither did they fear them, or should they finde them un∣provided:</HI> and by another Messenger sent the Snakes skin back again with Bullets in it, but they would not receive it, but sent it back again. It is probable the reason of this their Message to the <HI>English,</HI> was their own ambition, who since the death of so many <HI>Indians,</HI> thought to dominear and lord it over the rest, and conceived the <HI>English</HI> would be a barre in their way, and law that <HI>Massasoiet</HI> took shelter already under their wings; but this made the <HI>English</HI> more carefully to look to themselves,
<PB N="34" REF="000144_0044_0FA2B33E9EE09E08"/>
so as they agreed to close their Dwellings with a good strong Pale, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ankers in convenient places, with Gates to shut, which were every night locked, and a Watch kept, and when need required there was also Warding in the day time; and the Company was by the Governour and Captains advice, divided into four Squadrons, and every one had their quarter appointed them, unto which they were to repair: and if there should be any cry of <HI>Fire,</HI> a Company was appointed for a Guard with Muskets, whiles others quenched the Fire; the same to prevent <HI>Indian</HI> Treachery. And herewith I shall end the Passages of this Year.</P>

<HEAD>1622.</HEAD>
<P>AT the Spring of this Year (the <HI>English</HI> having certified the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> that they would come again unto them) they accordingly prepared to go thither; but up∣on some rumours which they heard from <HI>Hobamak</HI> their friend fore-named, who feared that the <HI>Massachusets</HI> were joyned with the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> and might betray them if they were not careful; and intimated also his jealousies of <HI>Squanto,</HI> by what he gathered from some private whisperings between him and other <HI>Indians,</HI> that he was not really cordial to the <HI>English</HI> in what he pretended, made them cautelous. Notwithstand∣ing, they sent out their Boat with ten of their principal men about the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> and both <HI>Squanto</HI> and <HI>Hobamak</HI> with them, in regard of the jealousie between them: but they had not been gone long, ere that an <HI>Indian</HI> belonging to <HI>Squanto</HI>'s family came running, seeming to be in great fear, and told them that many of the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> with <HI>Corbitant,</HI> (and he thought <HI>Massasoiet</HI>) was coming against them: At which they betook them to their Arms, and supposing that the Boat was not as yet out of call, they caused a Piece of Ord∣nance to be discharged, to call them in again: But this proved
<PB N="35" REF="000144_0045_0FA2B33F381E60F8"/>
otherwise, for no <HI>Indians</HI> came. After this they went to the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> and had good Trade, and returned in safety, God be praised.</P>
<P>But by the former passages and things of like nature, they began to see that <HI>Squanto</HI> sought his own ends, and played his own game, by putting the <HI>Indians</HI> in fear, and drawing gifts from them to inrich himself; making them believe he could stir up war against them when he would, and make peace for them when he would; yea he made them believe, that the <HI>English</HI> kept the Plague buried in the ground; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould send it a∣mongst <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>.</HI></NOTE>whom they would, which did much terrifie the <HI>Indians;</HI> and made them more depend on him, and seek more to him then to their great Sachem <HI>Massasoiet;</HI> which procured him envy, and had like to have cost him his life: for after the discovery of these practises, the said <HI>Massasoiet</HI> sought it both privately and openly; which caused him to stick close to the <HI>English,</HI> and never after durst go from them until his death. They also made good use of the emulation that grew between <HI>Hobamak</HI> and him, which made them both carry more squarely; and the Governour seemed to countenance the one, and their Captain the other; by which they had the better intelligence, and it made them both the more diligent.</P>
<P>About the latter end of <HI>May</HI> they espied a vessel at sea, which at the first they thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be a <HI>French-man,</HI> but it proved one that belonged to Mr. <HI>Thomas Weston</HI> a Merchant; which came from a ship which he and another had sent out on fishing to a place called <HI>Damarels Cove,</HI> in the Eastern parts of <HI>N. E.</HI> this boat brought seven men, and some letters, but no provi∣sions to them, of which they were in continual expectation from <HI>England,</HI> which expectations were frustrated in that be∣half; for they never had any supply to any purpose after this time, but what the Lord helped them to raise by their industry amongst themselves: for all that came afterwards was too short for the passengers that came with it.</P>
<P>After this the same year, the above-named Mr. <HI>Thomas Weston,</HI> who had formerly been one of the Merchant-adven∣turers
<PB N="36" REF="000144_0046_0FA2B341698954D0"/>
to the Plantation of <HI>New-Plimouth</HI> (but had now bro∣ken <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The one named the</HI> Sparrow, <HI>the other the</HI> Charity.</NOTE> off and deserted the general concerns thereof) sent over two ships on his own particular interest; in the one of them came sixty lusty men, who were to be put on shore at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> for the ship was to go with other passengers to <HI>Virginia;</HI> these were courteously entertained (with the seven men fore-named belonging to the said <HI>Weston,</HI> at <HI>Plimouth</HI> aforesaid) until the ship returned from <HI>Virginia,</HI> which was the most part of that Summer; many of them being sick, and all of them destitute of habitation, and unacquainted with this new beginning: at the ships return from <HI>Virginia,</HI> by the direction of the said Mr. <HI>Weston</HI> their Master, or such as he had set over them, they removed into the <HI>Massachusets Bay,</HI> he having got a Pattent for some part there, yet they left all their sick folk at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> until they were setled and fitted for housing to receive them: These were an unruly company, and had no good government over them, and by disorder fell into many wants, as afterwards will appear.</P>
<P>But before I pass on, I may not omit the mentioning of a courteous Letter that came in the vessel above-named, in which the above-said seven men came, being directed to the Gover∣nour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> with respect unto the whole <HI>Plantation,</HI> from a Captain of a ship at the Eastward, who came thither on a fishing voyage; the which for the ingenuity of the man, and his courtesie therein expressed, may not unfitly be here inserted, being inscribed as followeth.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>In the same Vessel the Governour returned a thankful An∣swer, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Although this was not much a∣mongst them all, yet it was a very seasonable blessing and sup∣ply, they being now in a low condition for want of food.</HI></NOTE> as was meet, and sent a Boat of their own with them, which was piloted by them; in which Mr. <HI>Edward Winslow</HI> was sent to procure what Provisions he could of the Ship, who was kindly received by the aforesaid Gentleman, who not onely spared what he could, but wrote to others to do the like: by which means the Plantation had a good quantity of Provi∣sions.</P>
<P>This Summer they built a Fort with good Timber, both strong and comely, which was of good defence, made with a flat Roof, and Battlements; on which Fort their Ordnance were mounted, and where they kept constant Watch, especially in time of danger: It served them also for a Meeting-house, and was fitted accordingly for that use. It was a great Work for them to do in their weakness, and times of want; but the danger of the time required it, there being continual rumours of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and fears of their rising against them, espe∣cially the <HI>Narrhagansets;</HI> and also the hearing of that great and sad Massacre in <HI>Virginia</HI> above-named.</P>
<P>It may not here be omitted, that notwithstanding all their great pains and industry, and the great hopes they had of a large Crop, the Lord seemed to threaten them with more and sorer Famine by a great Drought, which continued from the third week in <HI>May,</HI> untill the middle of <HI>July,</HI> without any Rain, and with great heat of Weather for the most part, insomuch as their Corn began to wither away, although it was planted
<PB N="38" REF="000144_0048_0FA2B346145FB2C0"/>
with Fish, according to their usual manner in those times; yet at length it began to languish sore, and some of the dryer grounds was parched like withered Hay, part whereof was never recovered. Upon which they set apart a so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mn Day of Humiliation, to seek the Lord by humble and servent Prayer in this great distress: and he was pleased to give them a gra∣cious and speedy answer, both to their own and the <HI>Indians</HI> admiration that lived amongst them; for all the morning, and greatest part of the day, it was clear weather, and very hot, and not a Cloud nor any sign of Rain to be seen, yet towards evening it began to overcast, and shortly after to Rain, with such sweet and gentle showers, as gave them cause of rejoycing and blessing God: it came without either Wind or Thunder, or any violence, and by degrees in that abundance, as that the Earth was throughly wet, and soaked therewith, which did so apparently revive and quicken the decayed Corn and other Fruits, as was wonderful, and made the <HI>Indians</HI> astonished to behold. A little before the Lord sent this Rain of Liberali∣ties upon his people, one of them having occasion to go to the house of the afore-named <HI>Hobamak</HI> the <HI>Indian,</HI> he the said <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> person that made this Rela∣tion is still sur∣viving and a principal man in the Jurisdi∣ction of</HI> Newr Plimouth.</NOTE> <HI>Hobamak</HI> said unto him, <HI>I am much troubled for the</HI> English, <HI>for I am afraid they will lose all their Corn by the Drought, and so they will be all starved; as for the</HI> Indians, <HI>they can shift better then the</HI> English, <HI>for they can get Fish to help themselves.</HI> But afterwards the same man having occasion to go again to his house, He said to him, <HI>Now I see that the</HI> English-mans <HI>God is a good God, for he hath heard you, and sent you Rain, and that without Storms, and Tempests, and Thunder, which usually we have with our Rain, which breaks down our Corn, but your stands whole and good still; surely your God is a good God:</HI> or with words to the like effect.</P>
<P>And after this gracious return of Prayers in this so season∣able a blessing of the Rain, the Lord sent them such seasonable showers, with interchange of warm weather, as (through his blessing) caused in its time a fruitful and liberal Harvest, to their great Comfort and Rejoycing: for which Mercy, in
<PB REF="000144_0049_0FA2B346E033CE10"/>
time convenient, they also solemnized a Day of Thanksgiving unto the Lord.</P>
<P>Now the welcome Harvest approached, in the which all had some refreshment, but it arose but to a little in comparison of a whole ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> supply; partly by reason they were not ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well acquai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> with the manner of the Husbandry of the <HI>Indi</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> no other) and also their many other Imploy∣ments; but chiefly their weakness for want of food, so as to appearance Famine was like to ensue, if not some way pre∣vented: Markets there was none to go unto, but onely the <HI>Indians;</HI> but they had no Trading-stuff. But behold now an∣other <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Another good providence of God tending to their relief.</HI></NOTE> Providence of God; A Ship came into the Harbour, one Captain <HI>Jones</HI> being chief in her, set out by some Merchants to discover all the Harbours between <HI>Cape Cod</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> and to Trade along the Coast. This Ship had store of <HI>English</HI> Beads, (which were then good trade) and some Knives, but would sell none but at dear rates, and also a good quantity together; yet they were glad of the occasion, and fain to buy at any rate: they were fain to give after the rate of <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI> if not more, and yet pay away Coat-Beaver at three shillings <HI>per</HI> pound. By this means they were fitted again to trade for Bea∣ver and other things, and so procured what Corn they could.</P>
<P>But here let me take liberty to make a little digression: There was in the Ship sent by Mr. <HI>Weston</HI> fore-named (in which his Men came) a Gentleman named Mr. <HI>John Porey,</HI> he had been Secretary in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and was now going home Passenger in this Ship. After his departure he wrote a Letter to the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> in the Postscript whereof he hath these expressions following:</P>

<P>These things I here insert, partly for the honours sake of the Authors memory, which this Gentleman doth so inge∣nuously acknowledge, and also the credit and good that he procured unto the Plantation of <HI>Plimouth</HI> after his return, and that amongst those of no mean Rank. But to return.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Westons</HI> people fore-named, who were now seated in the Bay of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> at a place called by the <HI>Indians Wesagusquaset,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Now by the En∣glish called</HI> Weymouth.</NOTE> and by disorder (as it seemed) had made havock of their Provision, they began now to conceive that want would come upon them; and hearing that their Neighbours at <HI>Plimouth</HI> had bought Trading-stuff, as aforesaid, and in∣tended to Trade for Corn, they wrote to the Governour, and desired that they might joyn with them, and they would im∣ploy their small Ship in this service; and also requested to lend or sell them so much of their Trading-stuff as their part might come to: which was agreed unto on equal terms; so they went out in the Expedition, with an intention to go about <HI>Cape Cod</HI> to the Southwards, but meeting with cross Winds, and other Crosses, went in at <HI>Mannamoik,</HI> where the aforesaid <HI>Squanto,</HI> being their Guide and Interpreter, fell sick, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Squanto's <HI>Death.</HI></NOTE> within a few dayes died: A little before his death, he desired the Governour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> (who then was there) <HI>to pray for him, that he might go to the</HI> English-mans <HI>God in Heaven;</HI> and bequeathed divers of his things to sundry of his <HI>English</HI> Friends, as Remembrances of his love: of whom they had a great loss.</P>
<P>Here they got a considerable quantity of Corn, and so re∣turned.
<PB N="41" REF="000144_0051_0FA2B3485312F710"/> 
After these things <HI>John Sanaers,</HI> who was left chief over Mr. <HI>Westons</HI> men at <HI>Wesagusquaset,</HI> in the Month of <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI> sent a Messenger, shewing the great wants they were fallen into, and would have borrowed Corn of the <HI>Indians,</HI> but they would lend him none; and desired advice whether he might take it from them by force to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his men, untill re∣turn from the Eastward, whither he was now going: But the Go∣vernour and the rest disswaded him by all means from it, for it might so exasperate the <HI>Indians,</HI> as might endanger their safety, and all of them might smart for it: for they had al∣ready heard how they had wronged the <HI>Indians,</HI> by stealing their Corn, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> so as the Natives were much incensed against them: yea, so base were some of their own Company, as they went and told the <HI>Indians,</HI> that their governour was pur∣posed to come and take their Corn by force, which with other things made them enter into a Conspiracy against the <HI>English.</HI> And herewith I end the Relation of the most Remarkable Pas∣sages of Gods Providence towards the first Planters, which fell out in this Year.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1623" TYPE="year">
<HEAD>1623.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Westons</HI> people fore-named, notwithstanding all helps they could procure for supply of Provisions, fell into great Extremity, which was occasioned by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ex∣pence while they had it, or could get it; and after they came into want, many sold away their Clothes and Bed-coverings; others were so base as they became servants to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and would cut them Wood, and fetch them Water for a Cap full of Corn; others fell to stealing both night and day from the <HI>Indians,</HI> of which they grievously complained. In the end they came to that misery, that some starved and died with hunger; and one in gathering of Shell-fish was so weak, as he stuck fast in the mud, and was found dead in the place; and
<PB N="42" REF="000144_0052_0FA2B3490CFDAF00"/>
most of them left their Dwellings, and were scattered up and down in the Woods by the Water-side, where they could finde Ground-nuts and Clams, here six, and there ten, by which their carriages they became contemned and scorned of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> insomuch as they began greatly to insult over them in a most insolent manner, so as if they had set on such Victuals as they had gotten to dress it, when it was ready the <HI>Indians</HI> would come and eat it up: and when Night came, when as possibly some of them had a sorry Blanket, or such like, to lap themselves in, the <HI>Indians</HI> would take it, and let the other lye all night in the cold, so as their condition was very lamentable; and in the end they were fain to hang one of their Company, whom they could not reclaim from stealing, to give the <HI>In∣dians</HI> content.</P>
<P>Whiles things went on in this manner with them, the Go∣vernour and People of <HI>Plimouth</HI> had notice that the Sachem <HI>Massasoiet</HI> their Friend was sick, and near unto death, and they sent to visit him, and sent him some comfortable things, which gave him content, and was a means of his recovery: Upon which occasion he discovered the Conspiracy of these <HI>Indians,</HI> how they were resolved to cut off Mr. <HI>Westons</HI> Company, for the continual Injuries they had done them, and would now take opportunity of their weakness, and do it; and for that end had conspired with other <HI>Indians</HI> their Neighbours there abouts: and thinking the People here would revenge their death, they therefore thought to do the like by them, there∣fore to prevent it, and that speedily, by taking some of the chief of them before it was too late, for he assured them of the truth thereof.</P>
<P>This did much trouble them, and they took it into serious consideration, and found upon Examination, and other Evi∣dences to give light thereinto, That the matter was really so as the said <HI>Sachem</HI> had told them. In the mean time came an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>This mans name was</HI> Phi∣nehas Pratt, <HI>who hath penned the particular of his perillous Journey, and som other things relating to this Tragedy.</HI></NOTE> <HI>English-man</HI> from the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> from the said Company in misery, as hath been above-related, with a small pack at his back; and although he knew not a foot of the way, yet he
<PB N="43" REF="000144_0053_0FA2B349D3D2C4A0"/>
got safe hither, but lost his way, which was well for him, for he was pursued by two <HI>Indians,</HI> who by Gods Providence mis∣sed of him by that means; and he related how all things stood with them there, and that he durst stay no longer, for he ap∣prehended by what he observed they would be all slain ere long. This made them make the more haste, and they dispatched a Boat away with some men under the conduct of Captain <HI>Stan∣dish,</HI> who found them in a miserable condition; out of which he rescued them, and helped them to some relief, cut off some of the chief Conspirators against them, and according to his Order offered to bring them all to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to be there untill Mr. <HI>Weston</HI> came, or some other way should be presented for their help: they thanked him and the rest, but they rather de∣sired that he would help them with some Corn, and they would go with their small Ship to the Eastward, to look out for a way for themselves, either to have relief by meeting with Mr. <HI>Weston,</HI> or if not to work with the Fishermen for their supply, and their passage for <HI>England:</HI> so they shipped what they had of any worth, and he helped them with as much Corn as he could, and saw them out of the Bay under sail, and so came home, not taking the worth of a peny of any of them.</P>
<P>This was the end of these that sometimes boasted of their strength, being all able, lusty men; and what they would do and bring to pass, in comparison of the people at <HI>Plimouth</HI> who had many Women and Children, and weak ones; and said at their first arrival, when they saw the wants at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> That <HI>they Here see the affect of Pride and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would take another course, and not fall into such a condition as this simple people were come to:</HI> but a mans way is not in his own power, God can make the weak to stand: <HI>Let him that thinketh he standeth</HI> (in such respect as well as other) <HI>take heed left he fall.</HI></P>
<P>Shortly after Mr. <HI>Weston</HI> came over with some of the Fisher∣men, where he heard of the Ruine of his Plantation, and got a Boat, and with a man or two came to see how things were; but by the way (for want of skill) in a Storm he cast away his Boat in the bottome of the Bay, between <HI>Merrimack</HI> and
<PB N="44" REF="000144_0054_0FA2B34A9C5B00B0"/>
<HI>Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ataqua,</HI> and hardly escaped with life; and afterwards fell into the hands of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who pillaged him of all that he had saved from the Sea, and stripped him of all his Clothes to his Shirt. At last he got to <HI>Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ataqua,</HI> and borrowed a Suit of Clothes, and got means and came to <HI>Plimouth.</HI> A strange alteration there was in him, to such as had seen and known him in his former flourishing condition; so uncertain are all things of this uncertain world.</P>
<P>But to return to the state and condition of the Planters at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> all this while no supply heard of, so they began to think how they might raise as much corn as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as they might not languish in misery as formerly they had done, and at the present they did, and it was thought the best way, and accordingly given way unto, that every one should plant Corn for his own particular, and in that regard provide for themselves, and in other respects continue the general course and way as before: &amp; so they ranged all their youth under some family, and set upon such a course, which had good success, for it made all hands very industrious, so as much Corn was plan∣ted.</P>
<P>This course being setled, by that time all their Corn was planted, all their victuals was spent, and they were only to rest on Gods providence; many times at night, not knowing where to have any thing to sustain nature the next day, and so (as one well observed) had need to pray that God would give them their daily bread, above all people in the world; yet they bare those wants with great patience and ala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity of spirit, and that for so long a time as the most part of two years.</P>
<P>Which brings to minde what <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> writes in magni∣fying <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>first</HI> De∣cade, <HI>p.</HI> 203.</NOTE> of the <HI>Spaniards; They</HI> (said he) <HI>led a miserable life for five dayes together, with parched grain of Maize only, and that not to sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty;</HI> and then concludes, <HI>that such pains, such labours, he thought none living, which is not a</HI> Spaniard, <HI>could have indured.</HI></P>
<P>But alas, those men when they had <HI>Maize</HI> (that is <HI>Indian Corn</HI>) they thought it as good as a feast; and wanted not only for five dayes together, but sometimes for two or three months
<PB N="45" REF="000144_0055_0FA2B34F938DEBA0"/>
together, and neither had bread, nor any kinde of corn.</P>
<P>Indeed in another place in his second <HI>Decade</HI> pag. 94. He mentions <HI>how others of them were worse put to it, where they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint to eat</HI> Dogs, Toads <HI>and</HI> dead Men, <HI>and so almost all of them</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. From these extremities the Lord in his goodness preser∣ved both their lives and healths, let his Holy Name have the praise; yet let me here make use of his conclusion, which in some sort may be applied to this people; <HI>That with their mi∣series they opened a way to those new lands: and after storms with what case other men came to inhabit in them, in respect of the cala∣mities these men suffered; so as they seemed to go to a bride feast where all things are provided for them.</HI></P>
<P>They having one boat left, and shee none of the best, with a net which they bought, improved them for the taking of Basse, which proved a good help to them, and when those failed they were fain all hands to go dig shell-fish out of the sands for their living; in the winter season ground-nuts and fowl was the principal of their refreshing, until God sent more setled and suitable supplies, by his blessing upon their industry.</P>
<P>At length they received some letters from the adventurers, which gave them intelligence of a ship set out, to come hither unto <HI>Plimouth,</HI> named the <HI>Parragon;</HI> This ship was bought by Mr. <HI>John Pierce,</HI> and set out on his own charge, upon hopes of great matters; the passengers and goods, the Company sent in her he took in for fraight, for which they agreed with him to be delivered here: this was he in whose name their first Patent was taken, for this place where <HI>Plimouth</HI> is, by reason of ac∣quaintance and some allyance that some of their friends had with him, but his name was only used in trust; but when he saw they were here hopefully seated, and by the success God gave them, had obtained the favour of the Council of <HI>New∣England,</HI> he goes &amp; sues to the said Council for another Patent of much larger extent in their names, which was easily obtained, but he meant to keep it to himself, and to allow them what he pleased to hold of him as tenants, and sue to his Courts as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hief Lord: but the Lord marvelously crossed him in his pro∣ceedings;
<PB N="46" REF="000144_0056_0FA2B35175A8CD18"/>
for when his ship above-named se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out from the <HI>Thames,</HI> she sprang a leak by that time she got to the <HI>Downs,</HI> and also by reason of a chop that accidentally be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el one of her Cables, it brake in a stress of wind while she there rode, and was in danger to have bin driven on the sands, and thereupon was constrained to return back to <HI>London,</HI> and there arrived in fourteen dayes after, and was haled up into the Dock, and an hundred pound more bestowed on her to mend her leaks and bruifes, which she received in the aforesaid storm; and when she was again fitted for the voyage, he pestered his ship, and takes in more passengers, and those some of them not very good, to help to bear his losses, and sets out the second time; and when he was half way or thereabouts to <HI>New-England</HI> was forced back again by an extreme tempest, wherein the goodness and mercy of God appeared in their preservation, being one hundred and nine souls. This ship suffered the greatest extremity at sea, at her second setting forth, as is seldome the like heard of; It was about the middle of <HI>February</HI> that the storm began, and it continued for the most part of fourteen dayes, but for two or three dayes and nights together in most violent extremity: at the beginning of the storm, their boat being above-decks, was thrown over-board; they spent their Main-mast, their Round∣house <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This Relation was make by Mr.</HI> William Pierce <HI>the Master of the said ship, and some of the pas∣sengers of good credit.</HI></NOTE> was beaten off with the storm, and all the upper works of their ship: he that stood to give direction, for the guiding of her before the sea, was made fast, to prevent his washing over∣board, and the seas did so over-rake them, as that many times those upon the deck, knew not whether they were within-board or without; and by her extreme leaking, being a very rotten ship, and the storm increasing, she was once very near founder∣ing in the sea, so as they thought she would never rise again: Notwithstanding the Lord was pleased of his great mercy to preserve them; and after great weather-beating and extraordi∣nary danger, they arrived safe at <HI>Portsmouth</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> to the wonderment of all that beheld in what condition they were, and heard what they had endured.</P>
<P>Upon the return of the said Mr. <HI>John Pierce</HI> for <HI>England;</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="000144_0057_0FA2B353F0A5EB20"/>
(he being personally in this his ship in the so sad storm) the other Merchant Adventurers, got him to assign over the grand∣Patent to the Company, which he had taken in his own Name, and made quite void their former Patent.</P>
<P>About the latter end of <HI>June,</HI> came in a ship at <HI>Plimouth</HI> with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This was the ship called the</HI> Paragon <HI>afore∣said.</HI></NOTE> Captain <HI>Francis West,</HI> who had a Commission to be Admiral of <HI>New-England,</HI> to restrain Interlopers, and such fishing ships as came to fish and trade without licence from the Council of <HI>New∣England,</HI> for which they should pay a great sum of money; but he could do no good of them, for they were too strong for him, and he found the fishermen to be refractory, and their owners upon complaint made to the Parliament, procured an order, that fishing should be free. He told the Governour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> that they spake with a ship at sea, and were on board her, that was coming to the said Plantation of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> in which were sundry passengers, and they marvelled she was not arrived, fearing some miscarriage; for they lost her in a storm that fell shortly after they had been on board: which relation filled them full of fears, yet mixed with hope. The Master of this ship had two Hogsheads of Pease to sell, but seeing their wants, held them at Nine pounds <HI>sterling</HI> an Hogshead, and un∣der Eight he would not take, and yet would have Beaver at an under-rate; but they told him <HI>they had lived so long without, and would do still, rather then give so unreasonably:</HI> so the said Ship went from <HI>Plimouth</HI> to <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>About fourteen dayes after c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me in the Ship called <HI>The Ann,</HI> whereof Mr. <HI>William Pierce</HI> was Master: two of the principal Passengers that came in this Ship were Mr. <HI>Timothy Hatherly</HI> and Mr. <HI>George Morton;</HI> the former, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Mr. <HI>Timothy Ha∣therly,</HI> soon after his arrivel met with some cross Providences by the burning of his House, whereby he was much impoverished, and much discouraged, and returned the Winter fol∣lowing for <HI>England:</HI> and afterwards the Lord was pleased to renew his Estate, and he came again into <HI>New-England,</HI> and proved a very profitable and beneficial Instrument both in Church and Common-wealth, being one of the first beginners,
<PB N="48" REF="000144_0058_0FA2B3544B88B2A0"/>
and a good Instrument to uphold the Church and Town of <HI>Situate;</HI> and also served God and the Jurisdiction of <HI>Plimouth</HI> in the place of Magistracy, and retained his Integrity in the Profession of the wayes of Christ unto old Age; still sur∣viving at the penning hereof.</P>
<P>The latter of the two fore-named, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Mr. <HI>George Morton,</HI> was a pious gracious Servant of God, and very faithful in what∣soever publick Imployment he was betrusted withall, and an unseigned well-willer, &amp; according to his Sphere and Condition, a sutable Promoter of the Common Good and Growth of the Plantation of <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> labouring to still the Discon∣tents that sometimes would arise amongst some spirits, by oc∣casion of the Difficulties of these new beginnings: but it plea∣sed God to put a period to his dayes soon after his arrival in <HI>New-England,</HI> not surviving a full year after his coming ashore. With much comfort and peace he fell asleep in the Lord in the Month of <HI>June, Anno</HI> 1624.</P>
<P>About ten dayes after the arrival of the Ship called <HI>The Ann</HI> above-named, there came in another small Ship of about forty four Tun, named the <HI>James,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bridges</HI> being Master there∣of; which said Ship, the <HI>Ann</HI> had lost at Sea by reason of foul Weather: she was a fine new Vessel, built to stay in the Coun∣try. One of the principal Passengers that came in her was Mr. <HI>John Jenny,</HI> who was a godly, though otherwise a plain man, yet singular for publickness of spirit, setting himself to seek and promote the Common Good of the Plantation of <HI>New∣Plimouth;</HI> who spent not onely his part of this Ship (being part Owner thereof) in the general Concernment of the Plan∣tation, but also afterwards was alwayes a Leading-man in pro∣moting the general Interest of this Colony: He lived many years in <HI>New-England,</HI> and fell asleep in the Lord <HI>Anno</HI> 1644. In the two Ships last named, came over many other persons besides those before recited, who proved of good use in their places.</P>
<P>These Passengers, seeing the low and poor condition of those that were here before them, were much daunted and dismayed,
<PB N="49" REF="000144_0059_0FA2B35506BB7708"/>
and according to their diverse humours, were diversly affected. Some wished themselves in <HI>England</HI> again; others fell on weep∣ing, fancying their own misery in what they saw in others; other-some pitying the distress they saw their Friends had been long in, and still were under. In a word, all were full of sad∣ness; onely some of their old Friends rejoyced to see them, and that it was no worse with them, for they could not expect it should be better, and now hoped they should enjoy better dayes together. And truely it was no marvel they should be thus affected, for they were in a very low condition, both in respect of Food and Clothing at that time.</P>
<P>To consider seriously how sadly the Scripture speaks of the Famine in <HI>Jacobs</HI> time, when he said to his Sons, <HI>Go, buy us food, that we may live and not die;</HI> and that <HI>the Famine was great and heavy in the Land,</HI> and yet they had great Herds, and store of Cattel of sundry kindes, which besides their flesh, must needs produce other useful benefits for food, and yet it was account∣ed a fore affliction: But the misery of the Planters at <HI>Plimouth</HI> at the first beginning, must needs be very great therefore, who not onely wanted the <HI>staff of Bread,</HI> but all the benefits of Cattel, and had no <HI>Egypt</HI> to go to, but God fed them out of the Sea for the most part: so wonderful is his powerful Pro∣vidence over his in all Ages: <HI>for his Mercy endureth for ever.</HI></P>
<P>About the middle of <HI>September</HI> arrived Captain <HI>Robert Gorges</HI> in the Bay of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> with sundry Passengers and Fa∣milies, intended there to begin a Plantation, and pitched upon that place which Mr. <HI>Weston</HI> fore-named had forsaken. He had a Commission from the Council of <HI>New-England</HI> to be Gene∣ral Governour of the Country: and they appointed for his Council and Assistants, Captain <HI>Francis West</HI> the aforesaid Ad∣miral, <HI>Christopher L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and the Governour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> for the time being: Also they gave him Authority to Choose such other as he should finde fit. Also they gave by their Commission <HI>fall Power to him and his Assistants, or any there of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (whereof himself was alwayes to be one) To do and execute
<PB N="50" REF="000144_0060_0FA2B355B9393738"/>
what to them should seem good, in all Cases, Capital, Criminal, and Civil;</HI> with divers other Instructions: Of which, and his Commission, it pleased him to suffer the Governour of <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI> to take a Copy.</P>
<P>He meeting with the aforesaid Mr. <HI>Weston</HI> at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> called him before him and some other of the Assistants, with the Go∣vernour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> aforesaid, and charged him with <HI>the ill carriage of his Men at the</HI> Massachusets, <HI>by which means the peace of the Country was disturbed, and himself and the people which he had brought over to plant in that Bay, thereby much pre∣judiced.</HI> To which the said <HI>Weston</HI> easily answered, <HI>That what was done in that behalf, was done in his absence, and might have befallen any man. He left them sufficiently provided, and conceived they would have been well governed; and for any errour committed, he had sufficiently smarted.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The said Mr.</HI> Tho: Weston <HI>was a man of parts, and a Merchant of good account in</HI> London <HI>Some∣time after these Passages he went for</HI> England, <HI>and died in the City of</HI> Bristol; <HI>he proved but a staff of Reed to the Plantation of</HI> Plimouth.</NOTE> Another particular was, <HI>An abuse done to his father Sir</HI> Fer∣dinando Gorges, <HI>and to the State.</HI> The thing was this: He used him and others of the Council of <HI>New-England,</HI> to pro∣cure him a License for the Transporting of many great Pieces of Ordnance for <HI>New-England,</HI> pretending great Fortification here in the Country; for which when he had obtained, he sold them beyond Sea for his private profit: At which the State was much offended, and his Father suffered a shrewd check, and he had Order to apprehend him.</P>
<P>The said <HI>Weston</HI> excused it as well as he could, but could not wholly deny it: but after much speech about it, by the Media∣tion of the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and some other Friends, the said Captain <HI>Gorges</HI> was inclined to gentleness, (though he apprehended the abuse of his Father deeply) which when the said <HI>Weston</HI> perceived, he grew the more presumptuous, and gave such cutting and provoking speeches, as made the said Ca∣ptain rise up in great indignation and distemper, vowing, <HI>That he would either curb him, or send him home for</HI> England: At which the said <HI>Weston</HI> was daunted, and came privately to the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to know <HI>whether they would suffer him to send him for</HI> England? It was answered him. <HI>They could not
<PB N="51" REF="000144_0061_0FA2B35679B3A310"/>
hinder it:</HI> and much blamed him, that after they had pacified things, he should thus break out by his own folly and rashness, and bring trouble upon himself and others. He confest <HI>it was his passion,</HI> and prayed the Governour aforesaid <HI>to intreat for him, and procure a pacification for him, if he could:</HI> the which at last he did obtain with much difficulty. So he was called again, and the said Captain <HI>Gorges</HI> was content to take his own Bond to be ready to to make further answer, when either he or the Lords of the Council should send for him; and at last he took onely his own Word, and so there was a friendly part∣ing on all hands.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the said Captain <HI>Gorges</HI> took his leave, and went to the <HI>Massachusets</HI> by land, being very thankful for his kinde Entertainment. His Ship stayed at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and fitted for to go to <HI>Virginia,</HI> having some Passengers to deliver there: and with her returned sundry of those from <HI>Plimouth,</HI> which came over on their particular account; some out of discontent and dislike of the Country, and others by reason of Fire that burnt their Houses and all their Provisions, so as they were necessitated thereunto. This Fire was by some of the Seamen, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This was on the fifth of</HI> No∣vember 1624.</NOTE> that were Roystering in an House where it first began, making a great Fire, the weather being cold, which brake out of the Chimney into the Thatch, and burnt three Houses, and con∣sumed all their Goods and Provisions. The House in which it began, was right against their Store-house at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> which they had much ado to save, in which was the Common Store of the Provisions of the Plantation, which had it been lost, the same had been overthrown: but through Gods mercy it was saved, by the diligence of the people, and care of the Gover∣nour and those about him. Some would have had the Goods thrown out, but if they had, there would have been much lost by the rude Company belonging to the two fore-named Ships, which were almost all on shore at this time; but a trusty Com∣pany were placed within, as well as such as were mean-while imployed in quenching the Fire without, that if necessity re∣quired they might have them all out with speed: for they
<PB N="52" REF="000144_0062_0FA2B357CE5F6D98"/>
suspected some malicious dealing, if not plain Treachery; and whether it was onely suspected or no, God knows: but this is certain, that when the Tumult was greatest, there was a voice heard (but from whence it came is uncertain) that bade them <HI>look well about them, for all were not friends that were then about them;</HI> and soon after, when the vehemency of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A very remark∣able Preserva∣tion.</HI></NOTE> Fire was over, smoke was seen to arise within a Shed that was joyned to the end of the aforesaid Store-house, which was wattled up with boughs, in the withered leaves whereof the fire being kindled, which some running to quench, found a long Fire-brand of about an Ell long, lying under the wall on the inside, which could not come thither by casualty, but must be laid there by some hand, in the judgement of all that saw it. But God kept them from this danger, whatever might be intended.</P>
<P>But to return again to speak something of the aforesaid Captain <HI>Gorges,</HI> after he had been at the Eastward and ex∣pedited some occasions there, he and some that depended up∣on him returned for <HI>England,</HI> having scarcely saluted the Country in his Government, finding the state of things not to answer his quality and condition; his people dispersed them∣selves, some went for <HI>England,</HI> others for <HI>Virginia,</HI> some few remained, and were helped with supplies from <HI>Plimouth:</HI> a∣mongst the rest, the said Captain brought over a Minister with him, one Mr. <HI>Morrel,</HI> who returned for <HI>England</HI> about a year after him, he took ship at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and had a certain power and authority of superintendency over other Churches grant∣ed him, and instructions for that end; but he never shewed it, or made any use of it, but only spake of it to some of <HI>Plimouth</HI> at his going away. This was in effect the end of the second Plantation, in the aforenamed place called <HI>Wesagusquaset.</HI></P>
<P>There were also some scattering beginnings made in other places, as at <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> by Mr. <HI>David Thompson,</HI> and at <HI>Mon∣hegin,</HI> and some other places, by sundry others.</P>

<P>THe time of new Election of Officers being come for this year at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> the number of their people being in∣creased, and their troubles and occasions therewith; the Go∣vernour desired them to change the persons, as well as renew the Election, and also to adde more Assistants to the Governour for help and counsel, and the better carrying on of publick af∣faires, shewing that it was necessary it should so be; for if it were any honour or benefit, it was fit that others should be made partakers of it; if it was a burden (as doubtless it was) it was but equal that others should help to bear it, and that this was the end of yearly Elections.</P>
<P>The conclusion was, that whereas there was before but one Assistant, they now chose five, giving the Governour a double voice; and afterwards they encreased them to seven, which course hath continued in that Colony until this day.</P>
<P>In the month of <HI>March,</HI> in this year Mr. <HI>Edward Winslow</HI> arrived at <HI>Plimouth</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> having bin imployed as agent for that Plantation, on sundry occasions, with the Mer∣chant Adventurers in <HI>England,</HI> who brought a considerable supply with him, the ship being bound on a fishing voyage; and with him came Mr. <HI>John Lyford</HI> a Minister, which was sent over by some of the Adventurers.</P>
<P>There came over likewise in this ship three Heifers and a Bull, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The first Neat Cattel that came to</HI> N. E.</NOTE> which was the first Neat Cattel that came into <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>The aforesaid <HI>John Lyford,</HI> when he came first on shore, salu∣ted them of the Plantation of <HI>Plimouth</HI> with that reverence and humility, as is seldome to be seen; and indeed made them a∣shamed, he so bowed and cringed unto them, and would have kissed their hands if they would have suffered him: yea he wept and shed many tears, blessing God that had brought him to see their faces; and admiring the things they had done in their wants, as if he had been made all of love, and the humblest

They gave him the best entertainment they could, in all simpli∣city, and as their Governour had used in all weighty affairs, to consult with their Elder Mr. <HI>Brewster,</HI> together with his Assi∣stants; so now he called Mr. <HI>Lyford</HI> also on such like occasions: after some short time, he desired to joyn himself a member to their Church, and was accordingly received; he made a large confession of his Faith, and an acknowledgement of his former disorderly walking, and his being intangled with many Corrup∣tions, which had bin a burden to his Conscience, and blessed God for this oportunity of freedome and liberty, with many more such like expressions; in some short time he fell into ac∣quaintance with Mr. <HI>John Oldham,</HI> who was a copartner with him in his after courses; not long after, both <HI>Oldham</HI> and he grew very perverse, and shewed a spirit of great malignancy, drawing as many into a faction as they could: were they never so vile or prophane, they did nourish and abet them in all their doings, so they would but cleave to them, and speak a∣gainst the Church: so as there was nothing but private meet∣ings and whisperings amongst them, they feeding themselves and others, with what they should bring to pass in <HI>England</HI> by the faction of their <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>That is, some at the Adventu∣rers, who proved in the issue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Plantation.</HI></NOTE> friends there; which brought others as well as themselves into a fools Paradice, yet they could not car∣ry so closely, but both much of their doings and sayings were discovered, although outwardly they set a fair face of things.</P>
<P>At length, when the Ship he came in was ready to return for <HI>England,</HI> and it was observed that <HI>Lyford</HI> was long in writing, and sent many Letters, and could not forbear to communicate to his Intimates such things as made them laugh in their sleeves, and thought he had done their errand sufficiently: The Go∣vernour
<PB N="55" REF="000144_0065_0FA2B35AF74C5770"/>
and some of his friends knowing how things stood in reference to some known adversaries in <HI>England,</HI> and what hurt these things might do, took a boat and went out with the ship, a league or two to sea, and called for all <HI>Lyfords</HI> and <HI>Oldhams</HI> Letters, Mr. <HI>William Pierce</HI> being Master of the ship, and knew well their evil dealings, (both in <HI>England</HI> and here) afforded them all the assistance he could; he found about twenty of <HI>Lyford<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> Letters, many of them large, and full of slan∣ders and false accusations, tending not only to their prejudice, but ruine and utter subversion; most of them they let pass, only took copies of them, but some of the most material, they sent true copies of them and kept the originals, left he should deny them, and that they might produce his own hand against him; amongst these Letters they found the copies of two Letters, which were sent in a Letter of his to Mr. <HI>John Pember∣ton</HI> a Minister, and a great opposite to the Plantation; these two Letters of which he took the copies, were the one of them writen by a Gentleman in <HI>England</HI> to Mr. <HI>Brewster</HI> here, the other by Mr. <HI>Winslow</HI> to Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> in <HI>Holland;</HI> at his coming away, as the ship lay at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> they lying sealed in the great Cabbin, whiles Mr. <HI>Winslow</HI> was busie about the af∣faires of the ship, this fly Merchant opens them, takes copies of them, and seals them up again, and not only seals the copies of them thus, <HI>To his Friend and their Adversary,</HI> but addes thereto in the Margent many scurrilous and flouting Annota∣tions. In the evening the Governour returned, and they were somewhat blank at it; but after some weeks when they heard nothing, they then were as brisk as ever, thinking no∣thing had been known, but all was gone currant, and that the Governour went out but to dispatch his own Letters.</P>
<P>The reason why the Governour and the rest concealed these things, was to let things ripen, that they might the better dis∣cover their intents, and see who were their adherents; because among the rest, they found a Letter of one of their confederates, in which was written, that Mr. <HI>Oldham,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lyford</HI> intended a reformation in Church and Common-wealth, and as soon as
<PB N="56" REF="000144_0066_0FA2B35E7312DC10"/>
the ship was gone they intended to joyn together and have the Sacrament; few of <HI>Oldhams</HI> Letters were found in the afore∣said search, being so bad a Scribe as his hand was scarce legible, yet he was as deep in the mischief as the other; and thinking they were now strong enough, they began to pick quarrels at every thing. <HI>Oldham</HI> being called to watch (according to order) refuseth to come, fell out with the Captain, called him <HI>Rascall,</HI> and <HI>beggarly Rascall,</HI> and resisted him, and drew his knife at him, though he offered him no wrong, nor gave him any ill terms, but with all fairness required him to do his duty; the Gover∣nour hearing the tumult, sent to quiet it; but he ranted with great fury, and called them all <HI>Traitors:</HI> but being committed to Prison, after a while he came to himself, and with some slight punishment was let go upon his behaviour for further Censure; but to cut things short, at length it grew to this issue, that <HI>Ly∣ford</HI> with his accomplices, without either speaking one word either to the Governour, Church or Elder, withdrew them∣selves, and set up a publick meeting apart on the Lords-day, with sundry such insolent carriages too long here to relate, be∣ginning more publickly to act that which they had been long plotting.</P>
<P>It was now thought high time to prevent further mischief, to call them to account; so the Governour called a Court, and summoned the whole company togher, and they charged <HI>Lyford</HI> and <HI>Oldham</HI> with such things as they were guilty of respecting the premises; but they were stiff, and stood resolutely upon the denial of most things, and required proof: they first alledged what was writ, compared with their practises here; that it was evident they joyned in plotting against them, and disturbed their peace in their Civil and Church-state, which was most injurious, for both they and all the world knew they came hither to enjoy the liberty of their Consciences, in the free use of Gods Ordi∣nances, and for that end had ventured their lives, and passed through so much hardship hitherto, and they and their friends had born the charge of these beginnings, which was not small, and that he (<HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR>) Lyford,</HI> for his part was sent over on this
<PB N="57" REF="000144_0067_0FA2B3615A478618"/>
charge, and both he and his great family was maintained on the same; and for him to plot against them, and seek their ruine, was most unjust and persideous.</P>
<P>But <HI>Lyford</HI> denied, and made strange of sundry things laid to his charge. Then his Letters were produced, at which he was struck mute. <HI>Oldham</HI> began to be furious, and to rage, because they had intercepted their Letters, provoked the peo∣ple to Mutiny in such words as these; <HI>My Masters, where are your hearts? now shew your courage: you have often complained to me so and so; now is the time, if you will do any thing, I will stand by you,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> thinking that every one knowing his hu∣mour that had fooled &amp; flattered him, or otherwise, or that in their Discontent uttered any thing unto him, would now side with him in open Rebellion: But he was deceived, for not a man opened his mouth, all were silent.</P>
<P>Then the Governour took pains in Convicting <HI>Lyford</HI> of his Hypocrisie and Treachery, in abusing his friends, in taking Co∣pies of their Letters in an under-hand way, and sending them abroad to their disgrace, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and produced them, and his own Letters under his own Hand, which he could not deny, and caused them to be read before all the people; at which all his Consedrates were blank, and had not a word to say. But after awhile he began to say, <HI>That sundry had made some Complaints unto him, and informed him of divers things:</HI> which being there present, and the particulars named to them, they denied.</P>
<P>Then they dealt with him about his Dissembling in the Church, and that he professed to concur with them in all things, and what a large Confession he had made at his admittance; and that he held not himself a Minister, till he had a new Cal∣ling, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and yet now he contested against them, and drew a Company apart, and sequestred himself, and would go about to administer the Sacraments by his former Calling, without ever acquainting them with it. In conclusion he was fully convicted, and burst out into tears, and confest <HI>be feared he was a Reprobate, his sins were so great that he doubted that God would not pardon them, he was unfavoury salt</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and that <HI>he
<PB N="58" REF="000144_0068_0FA2B362EA1BF7E0"/>
had so wronged them, as he could never make them amends;</HI> con∣fessing <HI>all he had written against them was false and naught, both for matter and manner:</HI> And all this he did with as much fulness as words and tears could express.</P>
<P>After their Trial and Conviction, the Court sentenced them to be expelled the Plantation; <HI>John Oldham</HI> presently to de∣part, though his Wife and Family h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>berty to stay all Winter or longer, untill he could make provision to remove them com∣fortably. <HI>Lyford</HI> had liberty to stay six Months; it was with some eye to his release, if he carried himself well in the mean time, and that his Repentance proved sound. <HI>Lyford</HI> acknow∣ledged his Censure was farre less then he deserved, and after∣wards he confessed his sin publickly in the Church with tears, more largely then before. I shall here relate it as I finde it penned by some who took it from his own mouth as himself uttered it.</P>
<P>Acknowledging, <HI>That he had done very evil, and slanderously abused them; and thinking most of the people would take part with him, he thought to have carried all by violence and strong hand against them; and that God might justly lay innocent blood to his charge, for he knew not what hurt might have come by these his Writings, and blessed God that they were stayed; and that he spared not to take knowledge from any of any evil that was spoken, but shut his eyes and ears against all the good; and that if God should make him a Vagabond in the earth, as was</HI> Cain, <HI>it was but just:</HI> and he confessed <HI>three things to be the causes of this his doings, Pride, Vain-glory, and Self-love:</HI> amplifying these Heads with many other expressions in the particulars of them, so as they began to conceive good thoughts of him upon his Repentance, and admitted him to teach amongst them as before; yea sundry tender-hearted persons amongst them were so taken with his signs of Sorrow and Repentance, as they professed they would fall upon their knees to have his Censure remitted and released. But that which made them all stand amazed in the end (and may do all others that shall come to hear the same, for a rarer pre∣sident can scarcely be named) was, that after two Months
<PB N="59" REF="000144_0069_0FA2B36358E9AF80"/>
time all his former Consessions, Convictions, and publick Ac∣knowledgements, both in the presence of God and his Church, and the whole Company, with so many Tears, and sad censures of himself, he should go again to justifie what he had done; for secretly he wrote a second Letter to the Adventurers in <HI>The Copy of this letter is extent but too large to be here inserted. England,</HI> in which he justified all his former Writings, save in some things which tended to their damage.</P>

<P>AT the time of their Election Court, <HI>John Oldham</HI> came again amongst them; and though it was apart of his Censure for his former Mutiny, <HI>Not to return without leave first obtained,</HI> yet he presumed without leave at all to come, be∣ing set on and hardened by the ill counsel of others; and not onely so, but suffered his unruly passion to run beyond the bounds and limits of all Reason and Modesty, insomuch that some strangers that were with him were ashamed of his out∣rage, and rebuked him: but all Reproofs were but as Oyl to the fire, and made the flam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his choller the greater. He called them all to naught in his fury, an hundred <HI>Rebels</HI> and <HI>Traytors:</HI> but in conclusion, they Committed him untill he was tamer, and then appointed a Guard of Musketeers, which he was to pass thorow, and every one was ordered to give him a blow on his Hinder-parts with the Butt-end of his Musket, and then he was conveyed to the Water-side, where a Boat was ready to carry him away, with this Farewell, <HI>Go and mend your Manners.</HI></P>
<P>After the removal of his Family, he fell into some straights, and about a year after intended a Voyage to <HI>Virginia:</HI> and so it pleased God, that himself and sundry passengers being in the Barque, they were in great danger, so as they despaired of life, and fell to Prayer, and to Examination of their Hearts and Consciences, and confessed such sins as most b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rthened them
<PB N="60" REF="000144_0070_0FA2B364212B60F8"/>
and the said <HI>John Oldham</HI> did make a free and large Confession of the wrongs he had done to the Church and People at <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI> in many particulars; that <HI>as he had sought their Ruine, so God had now met with him, and might destroy him;</HI> yea, <HI>he feared that they all fared the worse for his sake: He prayed God to forgive him,</HI> and made Vows, <HI>That if the Lord spared his life, he would become otherwise.</HI> This was reported by some of good Credit not long since living in the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bay, that were themselves partners in the same danger, which was on the Sholes of <HI>Cape Cod.</HI></P>
<P>It pleased God to spare their lives, but they lost their voyage; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>He was a man of parts, but high-spirited, and extremely passionate, which marred all in point of right improve∣ment of them.</HI></NOTE> and in time afterwards the said Mr. <HI>John Oldham</HI> carried him∣self fairly towards them, and acknowledged the hand of God to be with them, and seemed to have an honourable respect of them, and so far made his peace with them, as he had liberty to go and come at his pleasure, and in sometime after went on tra∣ding in a small vessel amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> and being weakly manned, upon some quarrel betwixt them, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew him with an hatchet: this his death being one ground of the <HI>Pequot</HI> war, of which afterwards in its proper place.</P>
<P>The time being expired that Mr. <HI>John Lyford</HI> his Censure was to take place, he was so far from answering their hopes by a∣mendment, as he had doubled his evil, as before-mentioned. But first behold the hand of God concerning him, wherein that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal.7.15</NOTE> of the <HI>Psalmist</HI> is verified, <HI>he hath made a pit and digged it, and is fallen into the pit that he made:</HI> he thought to bring shame and disgrace upon them, but instead of that, opens his own to all the world; for his wife who was a prudent sober woman, taking notice of his false and deceitful carriage about the premises, in grief of minde expressed her fears, that God would bring upon himself and his family, some sad judgement for these and other his wicked practices, and related that he had a <HI>Bastard</HI> by ano∣ther woman, before marriage with her, which he denied to her with an oath, but it afterwards appeared to be so: and another miscarriage of the like nature, more odiously circumstanced, was also discovered, for which he was forced to leave <HI>Ireland;</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="000144_0071_0FA2B364B83484F0"/>
and so came <HI>New-England</HI> to be troubled with him. Being banished hence, he went first to <HI>Nantasket,</HI> then to <HI>Salem,</HI> and after to <HI>Virginia,</HI> where he shortly after died.</P>
<P>I have been too tedious in my relating the plots of these wicked <HI>Machavillians:</HI> But to conclude, the Reader may take notice, that God observed and brought to nought their wicked devices, was a defence to the innocent, and caught them in the snares they privily layed for them, punishing one sin by another, until he had accomplished the freedom of his <HI>Israel,</HI> by the overthrow of his and their enemies; for which his mercy, let his holy Name be praised for evermore.</P>
<P>This storm thus blown over, yet sundry sad effects followed, for the company of the Merchant Adventurers brake in pieces hereupon, and the greatest part wholly deserted the Colony, but yet God took care of it; for although sundry of them fell off and adventured no more towards the support thereof, but ra∣ther proved manifest adversaries thereunto then otherwise: and the rest, partly because they were grown (some of them) low in their estates, and there being small hopes of returns to their expectations; although courteous in words and well wishes, yet afforded little or no help after this, so that the Plantation was fain to stand on their own legs, being indeed marvellously supported by the Lord, for it pleased him so to bless their en∣deavours, as that they raised great crops of <HI>Indian Corn</HI> (about this time) so as they had enough, and to spare, and began to have thoughts of improving part of it in a way of trading with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and having only two shallops, and no bigger vessels, they laid a deck on the one of them in the midships, to pre∣serve the corn dry from weather, &amp; so sent her laden with corn to a place call'd <HI>Kenebek,</HI> about fifty leagues off to the Eastwards: and notwithstanding they were strangers to the way, and place of trade, and to the people, and having no seamen to go with them, and at that season, being the latter end of the year and drawing on to winter; yet it pleased God to preserve them, and so to bless their endeavours, as that they returned in safety, and with good success, it being the first enterprise they atchieved
<PB N="62" REF="000144_0072_0FA2B365DA514248"/>
in this kind (at least) so far, and it proved an inlet to a further trade, which was greatly beneficial to them afterwards.</P>
<P>And here I may not omit the observable dispensation of Gods providence, respecting his dealing with the Adventurers fore∣mentioned, in reference unto two ships they sent unto these parts about that time, on a fishing voyage only upon their own account, having left the Plantation to shift for themselves; one of these ships was a small one (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR>) the <HI>James</HI> forenamed, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> which was well laden with good <HI>Cor fish,</HI> and in her a great quantity likewise of <HI>Beaver</HI> and other furs, which was sent by the Plantation to the Adventurers, and returned for <HI>England:</HI> the other ship was also laden with good <HI>dry fish,</HI> and she also returned with her; being thus well fraighted, they went to∣gether lovingly and joyfully away, the greater ship towing the lesser at her stern all the way over-bound, and had such fair weather, as they never cast her off, till they were shot deep into the <HI>English Chanel,</HI> almost within sight of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and yet there she was unhappily taken by a <HI>Turks-man</HI> of war, &amp; carried into <HI>Sally,</HI> where the Master and Men were made Slaves, and many of the Beaver-skins were sold for four pence a piece. Thus were all their hopes dashed in this respect, and the joy∣full News they went to carry home, turned into heavy Tidings. Some thought this a Hand of God for some unkindness shewed to the Plantation, by exaction upon them in reference to a par∣cel of goods they a little before had sent over to them on ex∣treme Rates: But Gods Judgements are unsearchable, neither ought we to be too bold therewith. But however, it shews us the uncertainty of all humane things, and what little cause there is in joying in them, or trusting to them.</P>
<P>In the bigger of these Ships Captain <HI>Miles Standish</HI> went over as Agent in the behalf of the Plantation, in reference un∣to some particulars yet depending betwixt them and the Ad∣venturers; as also to the Honourable Council of <HI>New-Eng∣land:</HI> and notwithstanding some Difficulty he met with in his occasions, by reason of the Pestilence which was then so hot in the City of <HI>London,</HI> yet he accomplished his business so, as
<PB N="63" REF="000144_0073_0FA2B3669BE50D60"/>
he left things in a fair way for future Composition be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wixt the said Merchant-Adventurers and the Plantation: and he spake also with some of the Honourable Council afore-named, who promised all helpfulness to the Plantation that lay in them. About this time it pleased the Lord likewise to give them peace, health, and good success on their endeavours, his holy Name be praised.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1626" TYPE="year">
<HEAD>1626.</HEAD>
<P>ABout the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> they heard of Captain <HI>Standish</HI> his arrival, and sent a boat to fetch him home; welcome he was, but the news he brought was sad in many re∣gards, not only in regard of the forementioned losses which their friends had suffered, and some of them dead of the <HI>Plague,</HI> but also that Mr. <HI>John Robinson</HI> their Pastor was dead, which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. John Robinson death.</HI></NOTE> struck them with much sorrow and sadness, as they had great cause: his and their adversaries, had been long and continually plotting, how they might hinder his coming into <HI>New-England,</HI> but now the Lord had appointed him to go a greater journey, at less charge, to a better place.</P>
<P>But before I pass things concerning this Worthy Servant of Christ Mr. <HI>John Robinson,</HI> I shall here insert the honourable testimony that Mr. <HI>William Bradford</HI> senior hath left behinde him, concerning him, being greatly acquainted with his worth and excellency.</P>
<P>Saith he, <HI>such was the mutual love and reciprocal respect that this worthy man had to his flock, and his flock to him, that it might be said of them, as it was once of that famous</HI> Emperour Marcus Aurelius <HI>and the people of</HI> Rome, <HI>That it was hard to judge whether he delighted more in having such a People, or they in having such a Pastor.</HI> But to return.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Standish</HI> likewise brought the sad news of the death of Mr. <HI>Robert C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shman,</HI> their ancient friend, whom the Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The death of Mr.</HI> Robert took C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shman</NOTE>

took away also this year (about the same time) who was as their right hand with their friends the Adventurers, and for di∣vers years had done and agitated all their business with them to their great advantage, of whom occasionally there hath been honourable mention formerly made in this Book.</P>
<P>About this time they received divers Letters from their friends at <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> full of sad lamentation for their heavy loss by the death of their Pastor Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> above∣named; and although their wills were good to come over to their brethren in <HI>New-England,</HI> yet they saw no probability of means how it might be effected, but concluded (as it were) that all their hopes was cut off, and many being aged, began to drop away by death. All which things before related, being well weighed and laid together, it could not but strike them with great perplexity, and to look humanely on the state of things as they presented themselves at this time, it is a marvel it did not wholly discourage and sink them, but they gathered up their spirits, and the Lord so helped them (whose work they had in hand) as now when they were very low, they began to rise a∣gain; and being stripped (in a manner) of all humane helps and hopes, he brought things about otherwise in his divine Providence, so as they were not only upheld and sustained, but their proceedings both honoured and imitated by others, as by the sequel will appear.</P>

<DIV2 N="1627" TYPE="year">
<HEAD>1627.</HEAD>
<P>THis Year they sent Mr. <HI>Isaac Allerton</HI> for <HI>England,</HI> and gave him order to make a Composition with the Adven∣turers, in reference unto some particulars betwixt the Planta∣tion and them, which Captain <HI>Standish</HI> had begun, as is before hinted, and at the ordinary season of the year (for the expe∣ctation of ships) he returned with some success in the business he was imployed in.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="000144_0075_0FA2B36A0C5CDB20"/>Likewise this Year they began to make some distribution of Lands, having had hitherto but to every person one Acre al∣lowed him as to propriety, besides their Home-steads, or Gar∣den-plots; the reason was that they might keep together, both for more safety and defence, and the better Improvement of the general Imployments: which condition of theirs brings to minde that which may be read in Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of the <HI>Romans</HI> first be∣ginnings <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Chap 2.</HI></NOTE> in <HI>Romulus</HI> time, how every man contented himself with two Acres of Land, and had no more assigned them: and <HI>Chap. 3. It was thought a great Reward to receive at the hands of the People of</HI> Rome <HI>a Pin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Corn;</HI> and long after, <HI>the great∣est Present given to a Captain that had got a Victory over their E∣nemies, was as much ground as he could Till in one day;</HI> and <HI>he was not accounted a good, but a dangerous man, that would not content himself with seven Acres of Land;</HI> as also <HI>how they did pound their Corn in Mortars,</HI> as these people were forced to do many years before they could get a Mill.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding as abovesaid, so small a portion of Land served them at the first, yet afterwards for divers Reasons moving thereunto, they were necessitated to lay out some larger Proportions to each person; yet resolving to keep such a <HI>mean</HI> in distribution of Lands, as should not hinder their growth by others coming to them, and therefore accordingly allotted to every one in each Family Twenty Acres to be laid out, five Acres in breadth by the Water-side, and four Acres in length.</P>
<P>I may not omit the inserting of a particular that sell out this year, in reference unto a Ship with many Passengers in her, and some considerable goods, which was bound for <HI>Virginia,</HI> who had lost themselves at Sea, either by the insufficiency of the Master, or his illness (for he was sick, and lame of the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> so as he could but lye in the Cabbin-door and give direction, and (it should seem) was badly assisted either with Mate or Marriners) or else the fear of, and the unruliness of the Pas∣sengers was such, as they made them steer a Course between the Southwest and Northwest, that they might fall with some

Land, whatever it was they cared not, for they had been six weeks at Sea and had no Beer, nor Water, nor Wood left, but had burnt up all their empty Cask, onely one of the Company had a Hogshead of Wine or two, which was also almost spent, so as they feared they should be starved at Sea, or consumed with Diseases, which made them run this desperate Course. But it pleased God, that although they came so near the Sholes of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> or else ran stumbling over them in the night they knew not how, they came before a small Harbour that lieth about the middle of <HI>Mannamoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct Bay,</HI> to the Southward of <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> and with a small gale of wind, and about a high wa∣ter, touched upon a Barre of Sand that lieth before it, but had no hurt, the Sea being smooth so they laid out an Anchor; but towards Evening the wind sprang up at Sea, and was so rough as brake their Cable, and beat them over the Barre into the Harbour, where they saved their Lives and Goods: for although with much beating they had sprung a butt-end of a Plank, yet they soon got over, and ran upon a dry Flatt within the Harbour close to a Beach, and at a low water got out their Goods, and were not a little glad that they had saved their Lives. But when they had refreshed them∣selves, not knowing where they were, nor what to do, were much troubled, but soon after saw some <HI>Indians</HI> come towards them in Canooes, which made them stand upon their guard, but when they heard some of them speak <HI>English,</HI> they were not a little revived; especially when they heard them ask whe∣ther they were not the Governour of <HI>Plimouths</HI> Men, or Friends, and that they would bring them to the <HI>English</HI> houses, or carry their Letters: and when they had feasted these <HI>In∣dians,</HI> and given them many gifts, they sent two men and a Let∣ter with them to the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> by which he had in∣telligence of their condition, and took order for their supply they hoping by mending of their Ship to recover her to go to Sea again, and accordingly did mend her; but afterwards ha∣ving but bad Moring, was put on shore again, and suffered so much shipwrack as she never got off more, but all the Com∣pany

were forced to repair to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> where they continued the best part of a year, being courteously entertained, and so were dispersed: The greatest part of them went to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and some remained in the Country. The chief amongst them were Mr. <HI>Fells,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sibsey,</HI> and the Masters Name was <HI>Johnston</HI> a Scotsman.</P>
<P>This Year the Plantation of <HI>Plimouth</HI> received Messages <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Dutch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> trading in these Southern parts divers years be∣fore the English came, but they began no plan∣tation until af∣ter the English came, and were here seated.</HI></NOTE>. from the <HI>Dutch</HI> Plantation, sent unto them from the Gover∣nour there, written both in <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French:</HI> The sum of the Letters forementioned were, To Congratulate the <HI>English</HI> here, taking notice of much that might engage them to a friend∣ly Correspondency and good Neighbourhood, as, The propin∣quity of their Native Country, Their long continued Friend∣ship, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and desired to fall into a way of some Commerce and Trade with them.</P>
<P>To which the Governour and Council of <HI>Plimouth</HI> returned answerable courteous acceptance of their loving Propositions, respecting their good Neighbourhood in general, and particu∣larly for Commerce: And accordingly the <HI>Dutch</HI> not long after sent their Secretary Mr. <HI>Isaac de Rosier</HI> with Letters and goods, who laid the foundation of a Trade that continued between them many years after, to their mutual benefit. They also brought the <HI>English</HI> acquainted with the trading of <HI>Wampam∣peag,</HI> untill then little known to us, nor esteemed by us, but was after of good valuation, and profitable. Although for the space of 20 years it was of great esteem amongst the Natives in divers parts of the Country, so as it made the <HI>Indians</HI> in these parts Rich, Proud and Powerful, yet untill they had store of it, they could not attain <HI>English</HI> Ammunition, but were fain to im∣prove their own Artillery of Bowes and Arrows: But when as they learned to make store of <HI>Wampam,</HI> they furnished them∣selves with Guns, Powder and Shot, which no Laws can re∣strain, by reason of the baseness of sundry unworthy persons, both <HI>English, Dutch</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> which may turn to the ruine of many: for hitherto the <HI>Indians</HI> of these parts had no Pieces, nor other Arms but their Bowes and Arrows and Clubs,

<P>THis Year died Mr. <HI>Richard Warren,</HI> who hath been men∣tioned before in this Book, and was an useful Instrument and during his life bare a deep share in the Difficulties and Troubles of the first Settlement of the Plantation of <HI>New∣Plimouth.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This Gentle∣mans name is here occasionall; used, &amp; although he came over in year 1625. yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passages in reference to</HI> Morton <HI>fell out about this year, and therefore referred to this place</HI></NOTE>.Whereas about three years before this time there came over one Captain <HI>Wollaston,</HI> a man of considerable parts, and with him three or four more of some Eminency, who brought with them a great many Servants, with Provisions, and other Re∣quisites for to begin a Plantation, and pitched themselves in a place within the <HI>Massachusets Bay,</HI> which they called after∣wards by their Captains Name, <HI>Mount Wollaston;</HI> which place is since called by the Name of <HI>Braintry.</HI> And amongst others that came with him, there was one Mr. <HI>Thomas Morton,</HI> who it should seem had some small Adventure of his own or other mens amongst them, but had little respect, and was slighted by the meanest Servants they kept. They having continued some time in <HI>New-England,</HI> and not finding things to answer their Expectation, nor Profit to arise as they looked for, the said Captain <HI>Wollaston</HI> takes a great part of the Servants, and trans∣ports them to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and disposed of them there, and writes
<PB N="69" REF="000144_0079_0FA2B36D1A4D3B08"/>
back to one Mr. <HI>Rasdale,</HI> one of his chief partners, (&amp; accounted their Merchant) to bring another part of them to <HI>Vir∣ginia</HI> likewise, intending to put them off there, as he had done the rest; and he with the consent of the said <HI>Rasdale,</HI> appointed one whose Name was <HI>Filcher</HI> to be his Lieutenant, and to go∣vern the remainder of the Plantation, untill he or <HI>Rasdale</HI> should take further order there about.</P>
<P>But the aforesaid <HI>Morton</HI> (having more craft then honesty) having been a <HI>Petty-fogger</HI> at <HI>Furnivals Inne;</HI> he in the others absence watches an opportunity (Commons being but hard a∣mong them) and got some strong drink, and other junkets, and made them a feast, and after they were merry, he began to tell them he would give them good Counsel: you see (faith he) that many of your fellows are carried to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and if you stay still until <HI>Rasdales</HI> return, you will also be carried away and sold for slaves with the rest; therefore I would advise you to thrust out this Lieutenant <HI>Filcher,</HI> and I having a part in the Plantation, will receive you as my partners and consociates, so may you be free from service, and we will Converse, Plant, Trade and live together as equals (or to the like effect) This counsel was easi∣ly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See the sad Ef∣fects of the want of good Government</HI></NOTE>. followed, so they took opportunity, and thrust Lieutenant <HI>Filcher</HI> out of doors, and would not suffer him to come any more amongst them, but forced him to seek bread to eat, and other necessaries amongst his neighbours, till he could get pas∣sage for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>After this they fell to great licentiousness of life, in all pro∣phaness, and the said <HI>Morton</HI> became Lord of misrule, and main∣tained (as it were) a school of <HI>Atheism,</HI> and after they had got some goods into their hands, and got much by trading with the <HI>Indians,</HI> they spent it as vainly, in quaffing and drink∣ing both Wine and strong Liquors, in great excess (as some have reported) <HI>Ten pounds worth</HI> in a Morning, setting up a <HI>May-pole,</HI> drinking and dancing about it, and frisking about it, like so many <HI>Fairies</HI> or <HI>Furies</HI> rather, yea and worse practises, as if they had anew revived and celebrated the feast of the <HI>Romans</HI> Goddess <HI>Flora,</HI> or the beastly practises of the mad <HI>Bacchana∣lians.</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="000144_0080_0FA2B36DEDA8E378"/>
The said <HI>Morton</HI> likewise to shew his Poetry, composed sundry Rythmes and Verses, some tending to laciviousness, and others to the detraction and scandal of some persons names, which he affixed to his Idle or Idol <HI>May-pole:</HI> they changed also the name of their place, and instead of calling it <HI>Mount Wol∣laston,</HI> they called it the <HI>Merry Mount,</HI> as if this jollity would have lasted alwayes. But this continued not long, for shortly after, that Worthy Gentleman Mr. <HI>John Endicot,</HI> who brought over a Patent under the Broad Seal of <HI>England</HI> for the Govern∣ment of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> visiting these parts, caused that <HI>May-pole</HI> to be cut down, and rebuked them for their propha∣ness, and admonished them to look to it that they walked better; so the name was again changed, and called <HI>Mount Dagon.</HI></P>
<P>Now to maintain this riotous Prodigality and profuse expence, the said <HI>Morton</HI> thinking himself lawless, and hearing what gain the Fishermen made of trading of Pieces, Powder and Shot; he as head of this confortship, began the practice of the same in these parts: and first he taught the <HI>Indians</HI> how to use them, to charge and discharge them, and what propor∣tion of powder to give the Piece, according to the size or big∣ness of the same, and what shot to use for Fowl, and what for Deer: and having thus instructed them, he imployed some of them to Hunt and Fowl for him; so as they became somewhat more active in that imployment then any of the <HI>English,</HI> by reason of their swiftness of foot, and nimbleness of body, being also quick-sighted, and by continual exercise, well knowing the haunt of all sorts of game; so as when they saw the execution that a Piece would do, and the benefit that might come by the same, they became very eager after them, and would not stick to give any price they could attain to for them; accounting their Bows and Arrows but bables in comparison of them.</P>
<P>And here we may take occasion to bewail the mischief which came by this wicked man, and others like unto him; in that notwithstanding all laws, for the restraint of selling Ammunition to the <HI>Natives,</HI> that so far base covetousness prevailed, and doth still prevail, as that the <HI>Salvages</HI> become amply furnished with
<PB N="71" REF="000144_0081_0FA2B36E85F5C5A8"/>
Guns, Powder, Shot, Rapiers, Pistols, and also well-skilled in repairing of defective Arms: yea some have not spared to tell them how Gun-powder is made, and all the materials in it, and that they are to be had in their own Land; and would (no doubt, in case they could attain to the making of <HI>Sait-Peter</HI>) reach them to make Powder: and what mischief may fall out unto the <HI>English</HI> in these parts thereby, let this pestilent fel∣low <HI>Morton</HI> (aforenamed) bear a great part of the blame and guilt of it to future Generations. But lest I should hold the <HI>Reader</HI> too long in the relation of the particulars of his vile actings; when as the <HI>English</HI> that then lived up and down about the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> and in other places, perceiving the sad consequences of his trading, so as the <HI>Indians</HI> became furnished with the <HI>English</HI> Arms &amp; Ammunition, and expert in the impro∣ving of them, and fearing they should at one time or another get a blow thereby; and also taking notice, that if he were let a∣lone in his way, they should keep no servants for him, because he would entertain any how vile soever: Sundry of the chief of the stragling Plantations met together, and agreed by mu∣tual consent to send to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> who were then of more strength to joyn with them, to suppress this mischief: who considering the particulars proposed to them to joyn together to take some course with him, and finding them weighty, agreed together to take some speedy course, to preven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (if it might be) the evil that was accrewing towards them; and resolved first to admonish him of his wickedness respecting the premises, laying before him the injury he did to their common safety, and that his acting concerning the same, was against the Kings Pro∣clamation: but he insolently persisted on in his way, and said, <HI>the King was dead, and his displeasure with him, and threatned them that if they came to molest him, they should look to themselves;</HI> so that they saw there was no way but to take him by force: so they resolved to proceed in such a way, and obtained of the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> to send Captain <HI>Standish</HI> and some other aid with him, to take the said <HI>Morton</HI> by force, the which accordingly was done; but they found him to stand stifly on
<PB N="72" REF="000144_0082_0FA2B36F43830088"/>
his defence, having made fast his doors, armed his Consorts, set Powder and Shot ready upon the Table; scoffed and scorned at them, and he and his Complices being filled with strong drink, were desperate in their way: but he himself coming out of doors to make a shot at Captain <HI>Standish,</HI> he stepping to him, put by his Piece and took him, and so little hurt was done; and so he was brought Prisoner to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and continued in du∣rance until an opportunity of sending him for <HI>England,</HI> which was done at their common charge, and Letters also with him, to the honourable Council for <HI>New-England,</HI> and returned again into the Country in some short time, with less punishment then his demerits deserved (as was apprehended.)</P>
<P>The Year following he was again apprehended, and sent for <HI>England,</HI> where he lay a considerable time in <HI>Exeter Goal:</HI> for besides his miscarriage here in <HI>New-England,</HI> he was suspected to have murthered a man that had ventured monies with him, when he came first into <HI>New-England;</HI> and a warrant was sent over from the <HI>Lord Chief Justice</HI> to apprehend him, by virtue whereof, he was by the Governour of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> sent into <HI>England,</HI> and for other of his misdemeanors amongst them in that Government, they demolished his House, that it might no longer be a roost for such unclean Birds: Notwith∣standing he got free in <HI>England</HI> again, and wrote an Infamous and Scurrilous Book against many godly and chief men of the Country, full of lies and slanders, and full fraught with pro∣phane calumnies against their Names and Persons, and the wayes of God. But to the intent I may not trouble the Reader any more with mentioning of him in this History: In fine, sundry years after he came again into the Country, and was imprisoned at <HI>Boston</HI> for the aforesaid Book and other things, but denied sundry things therein, affirming his Book was adulterated. And soon after being grown old in wicked∣ness, at last ended his life at <HI>Pascataqua.</HI> But I fear I have held the Reader too long about so unworthy a person, but hope it may be useful to take notice how wickedness was beginning, and would have further proceeded, had it not been prevented timely.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>In the three Ships that came over this year to <HI>Salem</HI> in the Month of <HI>June,</HI> besides many godly Christians, there came over three Ministers; two of them, Mr. <HI>Skelton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hig∣ginson,</HI> were Non-conformists, who having suffered much in their Native Land upon that account, they came over with a professed intention of practising Church-Reformation: the third Minister Mr. <HI>Bright</HI> was a Conformist, who not agreeing in judgement with the other two, he removed to <HI>Charlstown,</HI> where also not agreeing with those godly Christians there that were for Reformation, after one years stay in the Country he returned for <HI>England.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Higginson</HI> and Mr. <HI>Skelton,</HI> in pursuance of the ends of their coming over into this Wil∣derness, acquainted the Governour Mr. <HI>Endicot,</HI> and the rest of the godly People whom they found Inhabitants of the place,
<PB REF="000144_0085_0FA2B376D7B78C68"/>
and the chief of the Passengers that came over with them, with their professed intentions, and consulted with them about setling a Reformed Congregation; from whom they found a general and hearty Concurrence, so that after some Conference together about this matter, they pitched upon the 6th of <HI>August</HI> for their entring into a solemn Covenant with God, and one an∣other, and also for the Ordaining of their Ministers; of which they gave notice to the Church of <HI>Plimouth</HI> (that being the onely Church that was in the Country before them) the people made choice of Mr. <HI>Skilton</HI> for their Pastor, and Mr. <HI>Higginson</HI> for their Teacher. And accordingly it was desired of Mr. <HI>Higginson</HI> to draw up a Confession of Faith and Covenant in Scripture-language; which being done, was agreed upon. And because they foresaw that this Wilderness might be looked upon as a place of Liberty, and therefore might in time be troubled with erroneous spirits, therefore they did put in one Article into the <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> on purpose about <HI>the Duty and Power of the Magistrate in Matters of Religion.</HI> Thirty Copies of the foresaid <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> and <HI>Covenant</HI> being written out for the use of thirty persons who were to begin the Work. When the sixth of <HI>August</HI> came, it was kept as a day of Fasting and Prayer, in which after the Sermons and Prayers of the two Ministers, in the end of the day, the foresaid <HI>Con∣fession of Faith</HI> and <HI>Covenant</HI> being solemnly read, the fore∣named persons did solemnly profess their Consent thereunto: and then proceeded to the Ordaining of Mr. <HI>Skelton</HI> Pastor, and Mr. <HI>Higginson</HI> Teacher of the Church there. Mr. <HI>Brad∣ford</HI> the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and some others with him, coming by Sea, were hindred by cross winds that they could not be there at the beginning of the day, but they came into the Assembly afterward, and gave them the <HI>right hand of fel∣lowship,</HI> wishing all prosperity, and a blessed success unto such good beginnings. After which, at several times many others joyned to the Church in the same way. The <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> and <HI>Covenant</HI> forementioned, was acknowledged onely is a Direction pointing unto that Faith and Covenant contained
<PB N="76" REF="000144_0086_0FA2B3781E865C90"/>
in the holy Scripture, and therefore no man was confined unto that form of words, but onely to the Substance, End and Scope of the matter contained therein: And for the Circumstantial manner of joyning to the Church, it was ordered according to the wisdome and faithfulness of the Elders, together with the liberty and ability of any person. Hence it was, that some were admitted by expressing their Consent to that written <HI>Con∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of Faith</HI> and <HI>Covenant;</HI> others did answer to questions about the Principles of Religion that were publickly propound∣ed to them, some did present their Confession in writing; which was read for them; and some that were able and wil∣ling, did make their Confession in their own words and way: A due respect was also had unto the Conversations of men, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that they were without Scandal. But some of the Pas∣sengers that came over at the same time, observing that the Ministers did not at all use the Book of <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> and that they did administer Baptism and the Lords Supper Without the Ceremonies, and that they professed also to use Discipline in the Congregation against scandalous persons, by a personal application of the Word of God as the case might require, and that some that were scandalous were denied admission into the Church, they began to raise some trouble: of these Mr. <HI>Samuel Brown</HI> and his Brother were the chief, the one being a Lawyer, the other a Merchant, both of them amongst the num∣ber of the first Patentees, men of Estates, and men of Parts and port in the place. These two Brothers gathered a Com∣pany together in a place distinct from the publick Assembly, and there sundry times the Book of <HI>Common-Prayer</HI> was read unto such as resorted thither. The Governour Mr. <HI>Endicot</HI> taking notice of the disturbance that began to grow amongst the peo∣ple by this means, he convented the two Brothers before him. They accused the Ministers as <HI>departing from the Orders of the Church of England, that they mere Separatists, and would be Anabaptists. &amp;c. but for themselves, they would hold to the Orders of the Church of England.</HI> The Ministers answered for themselves, <HI>They were neither</HI> Separatists <HI>nor</HI> Anabaptists,
<PB N="77" REF="000144_0087_0FA2B3784FCB7500"/>
<HI>they did not separate from the Church of</HI> England, <HI>nor from the Ordinances of God there, but onely from the Corruptions and Dis∣orders there;</HI> and <HI>that they came away from the Common-Prayer and Ceremonies, and had suffered much for their Non-Conformity in their Native Land, and therefore being in a place where they might have their liberty, they neither could nor would use them, be∣cause they judged the imposition of these things to be sinful Cor∣ruptions in the Worship of God.</HI> The Governour and Council, and the generality of the people, did well approve of the Mi∣nisters Answer: and therefore finding those two Brothers to be of high Spirits, and their speeches and practises tending to Mutiny and Faction, the Governour told them, <HI>That</HI> New∣England <HI>was no place for such as they;</HI> and therefore he sent them both back for <HI>England</HI> at the return of the Ships the same year: and though they breathed out Threatnings both against the Governour and Ministers there, yet the Lord so disposed of all, that there was no further inconvenience followed up∣on it.</P>
<P>The two Ministers there being seriously studious of Refor∣mation, they considered of the state of their Children, together with their Parents; concerning which, Letters did pass between Mr. <HI>Higginson,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brewster</HI> the reverend Elder of the Church of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and they did agree in their judgements, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> concerning the <HI>Church-Membership</HI> of the Children with their parents, and that Baptism was a seal of their <HI>Membership,</HI> only when they were Adult, they being not scandalous, they were to be examined by the <HI>Church-Officers,</HI> and upon their ap∣probation of their fitness, and upon the Childrens publick and personal owning of the Covenant, they were to be received unto the Lords Supper. Accordingly Mr. <HI>Higginson's</HI> eldest Son, being about fifteen years of age, was owned to have been received a member together with his Parents, and being pri∣vately examined by the Pastor Mr. <HI>Skelton,</HI> about his knowledge in the principles of Religion, he did present him before the Church when the Lords Supper was to be Administred, and the Childe then publickly and personally owning the Covenant of
<PB N="78" REF="000144_0088_0FA2B379093B3090"/>
the God of his Father, he was admitted unto the Lords Supper: it being then professedly owned, according to I <HI>Cor.</HI>7. 14. that the Children of the Church are holy unto the Lord as well as their Parents, accordingly the Parents owning and retaining the Baptism, which they themselves received in their Infancy, in their Native Land, as they had any Children born, Baptism was administred unto them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to the Children of such as were members of that particular Church.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Higginson</HI> lived but one year after the setling of the Church there, departed this life about the same time the next year, in the Month of <HI>August,</HI> 1630.

<P>In the year 1634. Mr. <HI>Reger Williams</HI> removed from <HI>Plimouth</HI> to <HI>Salem:</HI> he had lived about three years at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> where he was well accepted as an assistant in the Ministry to Mr. <HI>Ralph Smith,</HI> then Pastor of the Church there, but by de∣grees venting of divers of his own singular opinions, and seek∣ing to impose them upon others, he not finding such a concur∣rence as he expected, he desired his dismission to the Church of <HI>Salem,</HI> which though some were unwilling to, yet through the prudent counsel of Mr. <HI>Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster</HI> (the ruling Elder there) fearing that his continuance amongst them might cause divi∣sions, and there being then many able men in the Bay, they would better deal with him then themselves could, and foresee∣ing (what he professed he feared concerning Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> which afterwards came to pass) that he would run the same course of rigid Separation and Anabaptistry, which Mr. <HI>John Smith</HI> the Sebaptist at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> had done; the Church of <HI>Plimouth</HI> consented to his dismission, and such as did adhere to him were also dismissed, and removed with him, or not long after him to <HI>Salem.</HI> He came to <HI>Salem</HI> in the time of Mr. <HI>Skeltons</HI> weakness,
<PB N="79" REF="000144_0089_0FA2B37A03D5DF60"/>
who lived not long after Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> was come, whereupon after some time, the Church there called him to office; but he having in one years time, filled that place with principles of rigid separation, and tending to Anabaptistry, the prudent Magistrates of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Jurisdiction, sent to the Church of <HI>Salem,</HI> desiring them to forbear calling him to office, which they not hearkening to, was a cause of much disturbance; for Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> had begun, and then being in office, he proceeded more vigorously to vent many dangerous opinions, as amongst many others these were some; <HI>That it is not lawful for an un∣regenerate man to pray, nor to take an Oath, and in special, not the Oath of Fidelity to the Civil Government; nor was it lawful for a godly man to have communion either in Family Prayer, or in an Oath with such as they judged unregenerate:</HI> and therefore he himself refused the Oath of Fidelity, and taught others so to do: also, <HI>That it was not lawful so much as to hear the godly Ministers of England, when any occasionally went thither,</HI> &amp; therefore he ad∣monished any <HI>Church-members</HI> that had done so, as for hainous sin: also he spake dangerous words against the Patent, which was the foundation of the Government of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony: also he affirmed, <HI>That the Magistrates had nothing to do in matters of the first Table, but only the second; and that there should be a general and unlimited Toleration of all Religions, and for any man to be punished for any matters of his Conscience, was persecution.</HI> And further he procured the Church of <HI>Salems</HI> consent unto letters of Admonition, which was written and sent by him in their name, to the Churches at <HI>Boston, Charlstown, New-town</HI> (now <HI>Cambridge</HI>) &amp;c. accusing the Magistrates that were members of the respective Churches, of sundry hainous offences which he laid unto their charge, and though divers did acknowledge their error and gave satisfaction, yet Mr. <HI>Wil∣liams</HI> himself, notwithstanding all the pains that was taken with him by Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> and many others, to bring him to a sight of his errors and miscarriages, and notwithstanding all the Courts gentle proceedings with him, he not only per∣sisted, but grew more violent in his way, insomuch as he staying
<PB N="80" REF="000144_0090_0FA2B37AB5247A18"/>
at home in his own house, sent a Letter, which was delivered and read in the publick Church assembly, the scope of which was to give them notice, <HI>That if the Church of</HI> Salem <HI>would not separate not only from the Churches of</HI> Old-England, <HI>but the Churches of</HI> New-England <HI>too, he would separate from them:</HI> the more prudent and sober part of the Church being amazed at his way, could not yield unto-him: whereupon he never came to the Church Assembly more, prosessing separation from them as Antichristian, and not only so, but he withdrew all private re∣ligious Communion from any that would hold Communion with the Church there, insomuch as he would not pray nor give thanks at meals with his own wife nor any of his family, because they went to the Church Assemblies: divers of the weaker sort of the Church-members, that had been throughly leavened with his Opinions, of which number were divers wo∣men that were zealous in their way, did by degrees fall off to him, insomuch as he kept a meeting in his own house, unto which a numerous company did resort, both on the Sabbath day and at other times, in way of separation from, and opposi∣tion to the Church Assembly there; which the prudent Ma∣gistrates understanding, and seeing things grow more and more towards a general division and disturbance, after all other means used in vain, they passed a sentence of Banishment against him out of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Colony, as against a disturber of the peace, both of the Church and Common-wealth.</P>
<P>After which Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> sat down in a place called <HI>Provi∣dence,</HI> out of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Jurisdiction, and was followed by many of the members of the Church of <HI>Salem,</HI> who did zea∣lously adhere to him, and who cried out of the Persecution that was against him: some others also resorted to him from other parts. They had not been long there together, but from rigid separation they fell to Anabaptistry, renouncing the Baptism which they had received in their Infancy, and taking up another Baptism, and so began a Church in that way; but <HI>Mr. Williams</HI> stopped not there long, for after some time he told the people that had followed him, and joyned with him in a new Baptism,
<PB N="81" REF="000144_0091_0FA2B37BB170F3B0"/>
that <HI>he was out of the way himself, and had mis-led them, for he did not finds that there was any upon earth that could administer Baptism, and therefore their last Baptism was a nullity, as well as their first; and therefore they must lay down all, and wait for the coming of new Apostles:</HI> and so they dissolved themselves, and turned <HI>Seekers,</HI> keeping that one Principle,
<HI>That every one should have liberty to Worship God according to the Light of their own Consciences;</HI> but otherwise not owning any Churches or Ordinances of God any where upon Earth.</P>
<P>Thus much was thought meet to be inserted here concern∣ing the great and lamentable Apostacy of Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> that it may be a Warning to all others to take heed of a gradual declining from, and forsaking the Churches of Christ, and Or∣dinances of God in them, left they be left of God to run such a course as he hath done; <HI>Wherefore let him that thinks he stands, take heed left he fall,</HI> I Cor. 10. 12. As also to be a Motive to the Saints, to remember him unto God in their servent Prayers for his return, he having been sometimes an able Dispenser of the Word of God, and (in several respects) of an exemplary Conversation.</P>
<P>And yet that there may be a standing Evidence of the Care that was had in those times to prevent the growth of Errours, and of the exercise of the Communion of Churches for that end, it is thought meet further to insert this passage: That be∣fore the putting forth of the Civil Power of the Magistrate for the removing of Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> from <HI>Salem,</HI> and besides other means also used, there was a publick Admonition sent in wri∣ting from the Church of <HI>Boston</HI> to the Church of <HI>Salem,</HI> for the reducing of Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> and the erring part of the Church.

<HEAD>1630.</HEAD>
<P>THis Year it pleased God of his rich grace to Transport over into the Bay of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> divers honourable Personages, and many worthy Christians, whereby the Lord began in a manifest manner and way to make known the great thoughts which he had of Planting the Gospel in this remote and barbarous Wilderness, and honouring his own Way of Instituted Worship, causing such and so many to adhere there∣unto, and fall upon the practice thereof: Among the rest, a chief one amongst them was that famous Patern of Piety and Justice Mr. <HI>John Winthrop,</HI> the first Governour of that Juris∣diction, accompanied with divers other precious Sons of <HI>Sion,</HI> which might be compared to the most fine gold. Amongst whom also I might name that Reverend and Worthy man, Mr. <HI>John Wilson,</HI> eminent for Love and Zeal; he likewise came over this year, and bare a great share of the difficulties of these new beginnings with great chearfulness and alacrity of spirit: They came over with a Fleet of ten Ships, three of them arriving first at <HI>Salem,</HI> in which several of the chiefest of them came, who repaired sundry of them in some short time into the Bay of the <HI>Massachusets;</HI> the other seven Ships ar∣rived at <HI>Charlstown,</HI> where it pleased the Lord to exercise them with much sickness, and being destitute of housing and shelter, and lying up and down in Booths, some of them languished and died: yea, it pleased God to take away amongst the rest, that blessed Servant of Christ Mr. <HI>Isaac Johnson,</HI> with his Lady, soon after their arrival, with sundry other precious Saints. This sickness being heavy upon them, caused the principal of them to propose to the rest to set a day apart to seek the Lord for the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>waging of his displeasure therein, as also for dire∣ction and guidance in the solemn enterprize of entring into Church-fellowship; which solemn day of Humiliation was observed by all, not onely of themselves, but also by their
<PB N="84" REF="000144_0094_0FA2B37D78F91540"/>
Brethren at <HI>Plimouth</HI> in their behalf: and the Lord was in∣treated not onely to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wage the sickness, but also encouraged their hearts to a beginning, and in some short time after to a further progress in the great Work of Erecting a way of Wor∣shipping of Christ in Church-fellowship, according to Primi∣tive Institution. Those choice and eminent Servants of Christ did not despise their poor Leaders and Fellow-souldiers that they found in the same Work of the Lord with them at <HI>Pli∣mouth,</HI> but treated them as Brethren, much pitying their great straits and hardships they had endured in the first beginning of Planting this Wilderness, promising all helpfulness even out of their own Estates according to their power; and their said Brethren at <HI>Plimouth</HI> were perswaded they spake as they thought in their hearts: for, such was the simplicity of those times, as that divers faces were not carried under a hood; Pride, Covetousness, Profaneness, and sinful Self, were asha∣med to be seen, except in obscure places and persons. Oh poor <HI>New-England,</HI> consider what thou wast, and what thou now art! <HI>Repent, and do thy first works,</HI> faith the Lord; so may <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> 43. 18, 19.</NOTE> <HI>thy peace yet be as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.</HI> So be it. But to return.</P>
<P>The first that began in the work of the Lord above-men∣tioned, were their honoured Governour Mr. <HI>John Winthrop,</HI> Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> fore-named, that much honoured Gentleman Mr. <HI>Thomas Dudley,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Wilson</HI> aforesaid: These four were the first that began that honourable Church of <HI>Boston,</HI> unto whom there joyned many others. The same year also Mr. <HI>George Philips</HI> (who was a worthy Servant of Christ, and Dispenser of his Word) began a Church-fellowship at <HI>Water∣town;</HI> as did also Mr. <HI>Maverick</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wareham</HI> at <HI>Dor∣chester</HI> the same year.</P>
<P>Thus out of small beginnings greater things have been pro∣duced by his hand that made all things of nothing: and as one small Candle may light a thousand; so the Light here kindled hath shone unto many, yea in some sort to our whole Nation. Let the glorious Name of <HI>Jehovah</HI> have all the praise in all Ages</P>

<P>THis year one Sir <HI>Christopher Gardiner</HI> (being as himself said)
descended of the house of <HI>Gardiner</HI> Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI> who was so great a Persecutor of Gods Saints in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> dayes, arrived in <HI>New-England;</HI> he being a great tra∣veller received his first honor of Knight-hood at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> be∣ing made Knight at the Sepulchre there: he came into these parts in pretence of forsaking the World, and to live a private life in a godly course, not unwilling to put himself upon any mean imployment, and take any pains for his living, and some∣times offered himself to joyn to the Church in sundry places: he brought over with him a servant or two, and a comely young woman whom he called his Cousin; but it was suspected (that after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner) she was his Concubine: he living at the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> for some miscarriages for which he should have answered, fled away from Authority and got a∣mongst the Indians in the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-Plimouth;</HI> the Government of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> sent after him but could not get him, and promised some reward to those that should finde him; the <HI>Indians</HI> came to the Governour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> and told where he was, and asked if they might kill him, but the said Gover∣nour told them no, they should not kill him by no means, but if they could take him alive and bring him to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> they should be payed for their pains; they said he had a Gun and a
<PB N="86" REF="000144_0096_0FA2B380D8E609E8"/>
Rapier, and he would kill them if they went about it, and the <HI>Massachusets Indians</HI> said they might kill him, but the Gover∣nour aforesaid told them no, they should not kill him, but watch their opportunity and take him, and so they did; for when they light on him by a River side, he got into a Cannoo to get from them, and when they came near him, whiles he presented his piece at them to keep them off, the stream carried the Cannoo against a Rock, and threw both him and his Piece and the Rapier into the water, yet he got out, and having a little dagger by his side, they durst not close with him; but getting long poles, they soon beat his dagger out of his hand: so he was glad to yield, and they brought him to the Governour at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> but his hands and arms were swelled and very fore with the blows they had given him, so he used him kindly, and sent him to a lodging where his arms were bathed and annointed, and he was quickly well again, and blamed the <HI>Indians</HI> for beating him so much they said they did but a little whip him with sticks. In his lodging those that made his bed, found a little Note-book that by accident had slipped out of his pocket or some private place, in which was a memorial what day he was reconciled to the <HI>Pope</HI> and Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and in what University he took his <HI>Scapula,</HI> and such and such a Degree; it being brought to the Governour, he kept it, and sent it to the Governour of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> with word of his taking, who sent for him; but afterwards he went for <HI>England</HI> and shewed his malice against <HI>New-England,</HI> but God prevented him; of which I thought meet to insert a Letter from Mr. <HI>Winthrop</HI> Governour of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> to Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> the Governour of <HI>Plimouth</HI> (in reference to this matter) as also the Copy of an Order rela∣ting to the same as followeth.

<P>The Plantation of <HI>Plimouth</HI> having had some former con∣verse with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as hath been hinted, they seeing them seated in a barren quarter, told them of a River called by them <HI>the Fresh River,</HI> which they often commended unto them for<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Which is the same called</HI>Conecticot River.</NOTE> a good place, both for Plantation and Trade, and wished them to make use of it; but their hands being full otherwise, they let it pass: but afterwards there coming a company of <HI>Indians</HI> into these parts, that were driven out of their Country by the potency of the <HI>Pequots,</HI> they <HI>solicited</HI> them to go thither. These <HI>Indians</HI> not seeing them very forward to entertain the mo∣tion, which they moved with great ardency, they sollicited them of the Government of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> in like sort; but they being then not fit to entertain the motion, in respect that they were newly come into the Country, did not much regard
<PB N="90" REF="000144_0100_0FA2B247D5A68E88"/>
it. Notwithstanding, some of the chief made a motion to joyn with some here in a way of Trade at the same River; on which a meeting was appointed to treat concerning the same matter, and some of <HI>Plimouth</HI> appointed to give them meeting, which they did, but they cast in the way many fears of danger and loss, and the like, on which they of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> de∣clined the thing, and did not proceed therein. Whereupon, those of <HI>Plimouth</HI> went on alone, and prepared a Frame of an House, and stowed it into a Barque, ready to rear at their land∣ing, and went up the said River, and reared their House, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enced it about with a Pallisado, which was done with great dif∣ficulty, not onely of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but also of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding, the place they possessed themselves of, was such as the <HI>Dutch</HI> had nothing to do with, and likewise was lawfully purchased of the <HI>Indians</HI> which they carried with them. And this was <HI>Plimouths</HI> entrance there, who deserved to have held it, and not by friends to have been thrust out, as in a sort they afterwards were.</P>
<P>This year it pleased God to visit <HI>Plimouth</HI> with an infectious Feaver, of which many fell very sick, and upwards of twenty died, men, women and children, and sundry of them were of their ancient Friends; amongst the rest, Mr. <HI>Samuel Fuller</HI> then died, after he had much helped others, and was a comfort to them: he was their Chirurgion and Physician, and did much good in his place, being not onely usefull in his faculty, but otherwise as he was a godly man, and served Christ in the Office of a Deacon in the Church for many years, and forward to do good in his place, and was much missed after God re∣moved him out of this world.</P>
<P>This sickness caused much sadness amongst them, and accord∣ing to their duty they besought the Lord by Fasting and Prayer, and he was intreated of them, and towards Winter the sick∣ness ceased. This sickness being a kinde of a pestilent Feaver, swept away also many of the <HI>Indians</HI> from many places near adjoyning to <HI>Plimouth.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be observed, That the Spring before this sickness,
<PB N="91" REF="000144_0101_0FA2B248911DCA48"/>
there was a numerous company of <HI>Flies,</HI> which were like for <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Strange and un∣wonted Flies a pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>age of a sickness that followed.</HI></NOTE> higness unto <HI>Wasps</HI> or <HI>Bumble Bees,</HI> they came out of little holes in the ground, and did eat up the green things, and made such a constant yelling noise as made all the Woods ring of them, and ready to deaf the hearers; they were not any of them heard or seen by the <HI>English</HI> in the Country before this time: but the <HI>Indians</HI> told them that sickness would follow, and so it did very hot in the Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>August</HI> of that Summer.</P>
<P>This year there arrived in <HI>New-England</HI> those three worthy <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Cotton, <HI>Mr.</HI> Hooker, &amp; <HI>Mr.</HI> Samuel Stones <HI>arrival in</HI> N.E.</NOTE> Instruments, Mr. <HI>John Cotton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Hooker,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Stone,</HI> who were Gospel-Preachers of excellent worth and use in their places, untill God took them out of the world unto himself.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A-great sickness amongst the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></NOTE> In the Spring of this Year there fell a very great sickness of the Small Pox amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> so as they died most mi∣serably of it; for a sorer Disease cannot come amongst them, and they dread it more then the Plague it self, for usually those of them which have this Disease, have them in abundance, and for want of Bedding and Linen, and other Necessaries, they fall into a lamentable condition; for as they lye on their hard Mats, the Pox breaking and running one into another, their skin cleaving by reason thereof to the Mats they lye on, when they turn them, much of their skin will flay off at once, and they will be all on a gore blood, most sad and grievous to be∣hold; and then being very sore, what with cold and other dis∣tempers, they die like rotten sheep.</P>
<P>This Year one Captain <HI>Stone,</HI> who had sometimes lived at <HI>Christophers</HI> in the <HI>West-India's,</HI> came into these parts; of whom I have nothing to speak in way of commendation, but rather the contrary. After he had been to and fro in the Country, he returned towards <HI>Virginia</HI> with one Captain <HI>Nor∣ton,</HI> and so it was, that as they returned they went in at <HI>Co∣necticot</HI> River, where the <HI>Indians</HI> killed the said <HI>Stone</HI> as he lay in his Cabbin, and threw a Covering over him: they like∣wise
<PB N="93" REF="000144_0103_0FA2B249F8AF90F0"/>
killed all the rest of his Company but the said Captain <HI>Norton,</HI> he defending himself a long time in the Cook-room of the Barque, until by accident the Gunpowder took fire, which for readiness he had set in an open thing before him, which did so burn and scald him, and blinde his eyes, as he could make no longer resistance, but was slain also by them, and they made a prey of his goods.</P>
<P>It is to be observed, That the said <HI>Stone</HI> being at the <HI>Dutch</HI> Plantation in the fore-part of this year, a certain Barque of <HI>Plimouth</HI> being there likewise on Trading, he kept company with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour, and made him drunk, and got leave of him in his drunkeuness to take the said Barque, with∣out any occasion or cause given him; and so taking his time when the Merchant and some of the chief of the men were on shore, with some of his own men, made the rest of them weigh Anchor, and set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail to carry her away to <HI>Virginia:</HI> but some of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Seamen, who had been at <HI>Plimouth</HI> and received kindness, seeing this horrible abuse, got a Vessel or two and pursued them, and brought them back. After this he came into the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bay, where they commenced Suit against him; but by the mediation of some it was taken up, and afterwards in the company of some Gentlemen he came to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and was kindly entertained: but Revenge boiling in his breast, (as some conceived) he watched a sea∣son to have stabbed the Governour, and put his hand to his Dagger for that end, but by Gods Providence ordering the vigilance of some that were about him, he was prevented: but God met with him for these and other wickednesses, as hath been before related.</P>

<P>This Year Mr. <HI>Edward Winslow</HI> took a Voyage for <HI>England,</HI> on publick occasions, and it came to pass that he had occasion to answer some Complaints made against the Country, at the Council Board; more chiefly concerning the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Jurisdiction, which he did to good effect, and further prosecuted such things as might tend to the good of the whole: in par∣ticular he preferred a Petition to the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners for the Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> in refe∣rence unto some injuries done by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> unto the Country; which Petition found good acceptance, and was in a way to a satisfactory Answer: but sundry Adversaries interposed, whose ends were the subversion and overthrow of the Churches, at least to disturb their peace, and hinder their growth; but by Gods providence it so fell out in the end, that although those Adversaries crossed the Petition for taking any further effect in the end principally intended in it; yet by this as a means, the whole plot was discovered, and those Adversaries came to nothing: the particulars whereof, are too long here to be inserted.</P>
<P>This Year, on Saturday, the fifteenth day of <HI>August,</HI> was such a mighty storm of Wind and Rain, as none now living in
<PB N="95" REF="000144_0105_0FA2B24B9DBC9C20"/>
these parts, either <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> had seen the like, being like unto those <HI>Hirracanes</HI> or <HI>Tussins</HI> that writers mention to be sometimes in the <HI>Indies.</HI> It began in the morning a little before day, and grew not by degrees, but came with great violence in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The great storm or Hirracane</HI></NOTE> the beginning, to the great amazement of many; It blew down sundry houses, and uncovered divers others: divers Vessels were lost at Sea in it, and many more in extream danger. It caused the Sea to swell in some places to the southward of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> as that it arose to twenty foot right up and down, and made many of the <HI>Indians</HI> to climb into Trees for their safety: It threw down all the Corn to the ground, which never rose more; the which through the mercy of God, it being near harvest time, was not lost, though much the worse: and had the wind continued without shifting, in likelihood it would have drowned some part of the Country. It blew down many hundred thousands of Trees, turning up the stronger by the roots, and breaking the high Pine Trees and such like in the midst, and the tall young Oaks, and Walnut Trees of good bigness, were wound as a Wyth by it; very strange and fear∣ful to behold. It began in the Southeast, and veered sundry wayes, but the greatest force of it at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> was from the former quarter, it continued not in extremity above five or six hours, ere the violence of it began to abate; the marks of it will remain this many years, in those parts where it was forest: the Moon suffered a great Eclipse two nights after it.</P>

<P>This Year the Towns on the River of <HI>Connecticot</HI> began to be planted, and in transporting of Goods thither, from the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bay, two shallops were cast away (loaden with Goods to go thither) in an Easterly storm, at the mouth of <HI>Plimouth</HI> Harbour; the Boats men were all lost, not so much as <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> William Cooper cast a∣way.</NOTE> any of their bodies found for burial, they being five in number in both the Boats: the Principal of them was one Mr. <HI>William Cooper,</HI> an antient Seaman of known skill, having formerly been <HI>Master</HI> of a ship, and had gone great Voyages to the East-Indies and to other parts, but the night being dark and stormy, they ran upon the skirt of a flat that lieth near the mouth of the harbour, and so were over-raked; the goods came on shore along the Harbour, and the Governour caused a careful course to be taken for the preservation of them in the behalf of the right owners, who afterwards received so many of them as were saved.</P>

of the mercy and goodness of God may be taken notice of, to his praise, for destroying so Proud and Blasphemous an Enemy.</P>
<P>In the Year 1634. the <HI>Pequots,</HI> a stout and war-like People, who had made War with sundry of their Neighbours, and being pussed up with many Victories, grew now at variance with the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> a great People bordering upon them; these <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> held correspondence and tearms of friendship with the <HI>English</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets:</HI> now the <HI>Pequots</HI> being conscious of the guilt of Captain <HI>Stones</HI> death, whom they knew to be an <HI>English man,</HI> as also those that were with him; and being fallen out with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> left they should have over many Enemies at once, sought to make friendship with the <HI>English</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> and for that end, sent both messen∣gers and gifts unto them, as appears by some Letters sent from the Governour of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> to the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> as followeth.</P>

<P>Not long after these things, Mr. <HI>John Oldham</HI> (of whom much is spoken before) being now an inhabitant of the <HI>Mas∣sachusets,</HI> went with a small vessel and slenderly manned on trading on those south parts, and upon a quarrel between him <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. Oldham death.</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> was cut off by them in such manner as hath been fore-noted, at an Island called by the <HI>Indians Mannisses,</HI> but by the <HI>English Block-Island;</HI> this with the former about the death of <HI>Stone,</HI> and the baffling of the <HI>Requots</HI> with the <HI>English</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> moved them to set out some to take revenge, and require satisfaction for those wrongs; but it took little effect, some of the murderers of Mr. <HI>Oldham</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led to the <HI>Pequots,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="000144_0109_0FA2B24F6BB91998"/>
and although the <HI>English</HI> went to the <HI>Pequots,</HI> and had some parly with them, yet they did but delude them; and the <HI>English</HI> returned without doing any thing to purpose, being fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trate of their opportunity by their deceit: After the <HI>English</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> were returned, the <HI>Pequots</HI> took their time and opportunity to cut off some of the <HI>English</HI> at connecticot, as they passed up and down upon their occasions; and tortured some of them in putting them to death, in a most horrid and bar∣barous manner: and most Blasphemously in this their cruelty, bad them call upon their God, or mocked and derided them <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Pequots horrible Blasphemy.</HI></NOTE> when they so did; and not long after assaulted them at their houses and habitations, as will appear more fully in the ensu∣ing Relation.</P>

<DIV2 N="1637" TYPE="year">
<HEAD>1637.</HEAD>
<P>IN the fore-part of this Year, the <HI>Pequots</HI> fell openly upon the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Connecticot,</HI> in the lower parts of the River, and flew sundry of them as they were at work in the fields, both men and women, to the great terror of the rest; and went away in great pride and triumph with many high threats: they also assaulted <HI>Saybrock</HI> Fort, at the mouth of the River of <HI>Conne∣cticot,</HI> although it was strong and well defended: it struck them with much fear and astonishment, to see their bold attempts in the face of danger, which made them in all places to stand upon their guard, and to prepare for resistance, and earnestly to solicite their friends and consederates in the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bay, to send them speedy aid, for they looked for more forceable assaults: Mr. <HI>Vane</HI> being then Governour of that Jurisdiction, writ from their General Court to the Governour and Court of <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> to joyn with them in this War, to which they were cordially willing: In the mean time, before things could be prepared for to set out, the <HI>Pequots</HI> (as they had done the winter before) sought to make peace with the <HI>Narrha∣gansets,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="000144_0110_0FA2B251C0B9AF28"/>
and used many pernitious Arguments to move them thereunto, as <HI>That the</HI> English <HI>were strangers, and began to over∣spread their Country; and Would deprive them thereof in time, if they were suffered to grow and increase; and if the</HI> Narrhagansets <HI>did assist the</HI> English <HI>to subdue them, that did but make way for their own overthrow; for if they were rooted out, the</HI> English <HI>Would soon take occasion to subjugate them; and if they Would hearken to them, they should not need to fear the strength of the</HI> English: <HI>for they Would not come to open Battel with them, but fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Houses, kill their Cattel, and lye in ambush for them as they went abroad upon their occasions; and all this they might easily do with little danger to themselves: the which course being held, they well saw the</HI> English <HI>would not long subsist, but they Would either be starved with hunger, or forced to forsake the Country:</HI> with many like things; insomuch that the <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> were once wavering, and were half minded to have made peace with them, and joyned against the <HI>English;</HI> but again when they considered how much wrong they had received from the <HI>Pe∣quots,</HI> and what an opportunity they now had by helping the <HI>English,</HI> to right themselves, revenge was so sweet to them, as it prevailed above all the rest; so as they resolved to joyn with with the <HI>English</HI> against them, and so did. The Court of <HI>Plimouth</HI> agreed to send fifty men at their own charge, and with as much speed as possibly they could get them in a readiness, under sufficient Leaders, and provided a Barque to carry their provisions, and to tend upon them on all occasions, and when they were ready to march with a supply from the Bay, they had word sent them to stay, for the Enemy was as good as van∣quished and there would be no need.</P>
<P>I shall not take upon me exactly to describe their Proceed∣ings in this War, because possibly it hath been done by them∣selves that were Actors therein, and best knew the Circum∣stances of things: I shall therefore set them down in the main and general, according to my best Intelligence.</P>
<P>From <HI>Conecticot,</HI> who were most sensible of the hurt sustained and the present danger, they set out a party of men,
<PB N="101" REF="000144_0111_0FA2B25326CF93D0"/>
and another party met them from the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bay at the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> who were to joyn with them. The <HI>Narrha∣gansets</HI> were very earnest to be gone, before the <HI>English</HI> were well rested and refreshed, especially some of them which came last: It should seem their desire was to come upon the Enemy suddenly and unexpectedly. There being a Barque of <HI>Plimouth</HI> newly put in there, which was come from <HI>Conecticot,</HI> they did encourage them to lay hold of the opportunity of the <HI>Indians</HI> forwardness, and to shew as great forwardness as they, for it would encourage them, and Expedition might turn to their great advantage: So they went on, and so ordered their march, as the <HI>Indians</HI> brought them to the Fort of their Ene∣my (in which most of their chief men were) before day: They approached the same with great silence, and surrounded it both with <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> that they might not break out, and so assaulted them with great Courage, shooting amongst them, and entred the Fort with great speed; and those that first entred found sharp resistance from the Enemy, who both shot and grapled with them: Others ran into their houses, and brought out fire and set them on fire, which soon took in their Mats, and their houses standing close together, with the wind all was soon on a flame, and thereby more were burnt to death then were otherwise slain. It burnt their Bow-strings, and made them unserviceable. Those that escaped the Fire were slain with the Sword; some hewed to pieces, others run through with their Rapiers so as they were quickly dispatched, and very few escaped: The Number they thus destroyed, was conceived to be above Four hundred. At this time is was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the Fire, and the streams of Blood quenching the same; and horrible was the slink and scent thereof: but the Victory seemed a sweet Sacrifice, and they gave the praise thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their Enemies in their <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They Prai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God for giving them to the victory</HI></NOTE> hands, and give them so speedy Victory over so proud, insult∣ing, and blasphemous an Enemy. The <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> all this while stood round about a loos off from all danger and left
<PB N="102" REF="000144_0112_0FA2B2548F40A9C0"/>
the whole Execution to the <HI>English,</HI> except it were the stopping any that brake away, insulting over their Enemies in their ruines and misery, when they saw them dancing in the Fire; calling by a word in their own Language, signifying <HI>O brave Pequots!</HI> which they used familiarly amongst themselves in their own praises, in Songs of Triumph after their Victo∣ries.</P>
<P>After this Service was thus happily accomplished, the <HI>English</HI> marched to the water-side, where they met with some of their Vessels, by whom they were refreshed, and supplied with Vi∣ctuals and other Necessaries: But in their march, the rest of the <HI>Pequots</HI> drew into a Body, and followed them, thinking to have some advantage against them by reason of a Neck of Land; but when they saw the <HI>English</HI> prepare for them, they kept aloof, so as they neither did hurt, nor would receive any. And after the <HI>English</HI> their refreshing, and repairing together for further Counsel and Directions, they resolved to pursue their Victory, and follow the War against the rest: but the <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> most of them forsook them, and such of them as they had with them for Guides or otherwise, they found very cold or backward in the business, either out of envy, or that they thought the <HI>English</HI> would make more profit of the Victory then they were willing they should, or else deprive them of that advantage that they desired, in making the <HI>Pequots</HI> become Tributaries unto them, or the like.</P>
<P>For the rest of this Tragedy, I shall onely relate the same as it is in a Letter from Mr. <HI>Winthrop</HI> to Mr. <HI>Bradford,</HI> as followeth:</P>

<P>I <HI>Received your loving Letter, but straightness of time forbids me: for my desire is to acquaint you with the Lords great mercy towards us, in our prevailing against his and our Enemies, that you may rejoice and praise his Name with us.

some</HI> Pequots, <HI>whom they slow or took Prifoners.

Our Captains were not then come together, but there was Mr.</HI> Ludlow <HI>and Captain</HI> Ma∣son, <HI>with some ten of their men, and Captain</HI> Patrick <HI>with some twenty or more of his, who shooting at the</HI> Indians, <HI>Captain</HI> Trask <HI>with fifty more came so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im at the noise. Then they gave order to surround the Swamp, it being about a Mile round; but Lieute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant</HI> Davenport <HI>and some twelve more, not bearing that Command, fell into the Swamp amongst the</HI> Indians: <HI>The Swamp was so thick with shrubs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> withall, that some stuck fast, and received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Lieutenant</HI> Davenport <HI>was dangerously wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Arm hole, and another shot in the Head, so as fainting they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in great danger to have been taken by the</HI> Indians, <HI>but S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgeant</HI> Rigg <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Sergeant</HI> Jeffery, <HI>and two or three more, rescued them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew divers of the</HI> Indians <HI>with their Swords. After they were drawn out, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Indians <HI>desired Parley, and were offered by</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> <HI>our Interpreter, That if they would come out and yield themselves, they should have their lives that had not their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the</HI> English <HI>Blood.

Then our men cut off a place of
<PB N="104" REF="000144_0114_0FA2B25732038720"/>
Swamp with their swords, and cooped up the</HI> Indians <HI>into a nar∣row compass, so as they could easier kill them through the thickets: so they continued all the night, standing about twelve foot one from another, and the</HI> Indians <HI>coming up close to our men, shot their Arrows so thick, as they pierced their Hat brims, and their sleeves and stockens, and other parts of their Clothes, yet so miracu∣lously did the Lord preserve them, as not one of them was wounded, save those three who rashly went into the Swamp as aforesaid. When it was near day it grew very dark, so as those of them that were left, dropped away, though they stood but twelve or fourteen foot asunder, and were presently discovered, and some killed in the pursuit. In the searching of the Swamp the next morning, they found nine slain, and some they pulled up, whom the</HI> Indians <HI>had buried in the Mire: so as they do think that of all this Company not twenty did escape, for they after found some who died in the flight of their wounds received. The Prisoners were divided, some to those of the</HI> River, <HI>and the rest to us of these parts.

<P>To conclude the discourse of this matter: This <HI>Sasacus</HI> the <HI>Pequot Sachem,</HI> being fled to the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> they cut off his head, and some other of the chief of them, whether to satisfie the <HI>English,</HI> or rather the <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> (who as I have heard hired them to do it) or for their own advantage, I know not.</P>
<P>And thus this War took end; the body of this People were wholly subdued, and their Country taken from them, and such of its Inhabitants as had escaped the heat of our revehge, by fire and sword, being nevertheless at the dispose of the Con∣querers, were by the <HI>English</HI> appointed some to the <HI>Narrhagan∣sets,</HI> and some to the <HI>Monhegens</HI> under Unkas their <HI>Sachem,</HI> who had been faithful and serviceable to them in this War: yet the <HI>Narrhagansets,</HI> were not pleased that themselves had not the sole Government of the Captives, and have since been continu∣ally quarrelling with the <HI>Monheags,</HI> and have sometimes been plotting against the <HI>English</HI> also; but to conclude, the <HI>Pequots</HI> have since been taken under the immediate Government of the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, and live in their own Country, being Gover∣ned by such of their own, as are by the <HI>English</HI> substituted and appointed for that purpose.</P>

Of which said Plantation and Colony, I have little to insert, for want of more full and certain intel∣ligence.</P>
<P>About this time there arose great troubles in the Country, especially at <HI>Boston,</HI> by the broaching of <HI>Antinomian</HI> and <HI>Fami∣listical</HI> Opinions; the chief sect-leader thereof, was one Mrs. <HI>Hutchinson:</HI> these carried on their abominable Tenets, with such subtilty, under a pretence of advancing free grace, and crying up the Covenant of Grace, and down the Covenant of Works; as they took away (by their assertions) Grace from the Covenant; yea so close was this mystery of Iniquity carried on, as that some of the prudentest of the Orthodox party, could not discern it at the first; but at length, the folly of those that were principal therein was made manifest unto all men: the evil consequences thereof faced very sadly, so as it influ∣enced into their Civil State, and caused great disturbance: but by Gods blessing on the improvement of the faithful endeavours

of his Servants, the Messengers of the Churches, who were called together as a Synod to help in the case; together with the prudence and industry of sundry principal ones amongst them, both in Church and State at other times: a right under∣standing of some few things, in difference amongst the sincere and godly, was procured. The Ring-leaders of the Faction being thus detected were censured, not only by the Church, but by the Civil power, and were also condemned to exile; who not knowing where they might sit down safely, made requests unto the Government of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> that they might be at an Island, that they had not hitherto improved, called by the <HI>In∣dians Aquetnet,</HI> (and by the <HI>English</HI> inhabiting it <HI>Road-Island</HI>) which the Government of <HI>Plimouth</HI> aforesaid, considering they were their Country-men and fellow Subjects that were thus distressed, and destitute of habitation, although they had their errors in as great dislike as those from whence they came, yet pittying them in their present straights, granted their re∣quest: so these having there seated themselves, and finding that it was a very fruitful and pleasant place, (such indeed, as that Colony or Jurisdiction hath not any the like left within their Patent) they soon drew many more unto them, not only to fill up that Island, but have also seated two more Towns on the Main; therein (as is judged) incroaching upon the just rights of the aforesaid Colony of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and have of late through mis-information obtained a Patent, not only for the places forementioned, but have also extended it into the heart and bowels of the known &amp; possessed rights of the said Colony: endeavoring to requite their kindness, as sometimes it is said the Hedge-hog did by the friendly Coney. But it is our great hap∣piness, that as God takes notice from on high of the unrighte∣ousness and oppression of the sons of men, so he hath given us a gracious Prince, who mindes the peace of His meanest Sub∣jects, from whose Justice and Prudence we do confidently expect relief, and on that assurance do resolve by Gods help to contain our selves from seeking to vindicate our wrongs in such a way as their injurious dealings might provoke unto.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="000144_0118_0FA2B25A13D6E350"/>This Year there was a hideous <HI>Monster</HI> born at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> of one Mrs. <HI>Mary Dyer,</HI> a Co-partner with the said Mrs. <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> in the aforesaid Heresies; the said <HI>Mon∣ster</HI> (as it was related to me). <HI>It was without Head, but Horns like a Beast, Scales or a rough skin like the fish called the</HI> Thorn∣back <HI>,it had Leggs and Claws like a Fowl, and in other respects as a Woman Childe;</HI> the Lord declaring his detestation of their Monstrous errors (as was then thought by some) by this pro∣digious Birth.</P>
<P>Not long before these Troubles, there arrived at <HI>Boston</HI> one <HI>Samuel Gorton,</HI> who from thence came to <HI>Plimouth;</HI> and upon his first coming thither, gave some hopes that he would have proved an useful Instrument, but soon after, by little and little, discovered himself to be a proud and pestilent Seducer, and deeply leavened with blasphemous and <HI>Familistical Opinion,</HI> and observing such Fictions to be spread by some of his Spirit already in the Country, he takes his opportunity to begin to sowe such seed at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> whereby some were seduced, in special one <HI>John Weeks</HI> and his Wife, who in some short time became very Atheists, looking for no more happiness then this world affords, not onely in practice such, but also in opinion. But the said <HI>Gorton</HI> falling into some Controversie with one Mr. <HI>Ralph Smith,</HI> was summoned to the Court held at <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI> the fourth of <HI>December</HI> 1638. to Answer the said Mr. <HI>Smiths</HI> Complaint; and there he carried so mutinously and feditiously, as that he was for the same, and for his turbulent carriages towards both Magistrates and Ministers in the pre∣sence of the Court, Sentenced to finde Sureties for his good Behaviour, during the time he should stay in the Jurisdiction, which was limited to fourteen dayes, and also Amerced to pay a considerable Fine. In some short time after he departed to <HI>Road-Island,</HI> and in like manner or worse demeaned himself there, so as they were forced to Sentence him to suffer Cor∣poral Punishment by <HI>Whipping,</HI> and they Banished him likewise off the Island. And from thence he with divers of his Ac∣complices went to <HI>Providence,</HI> and there he and they carried so

force to constrain them to come; which they ac∣cordingly performed, and Committed the said <HI>Gorton</HI> and se∣veral of them to Ward: and during the time of their Impri∣sonment, they carried still very proudly and audaciously to∣wards all in place of Authority, sparing not to reproach, abuse and traduce the most Honourable and Reverend both in Church and State; and which is yet worse, spared not blasphemously to fly upon the Lord Jesus himself, his Word and Ordinances, in such a manner as scarce in any Age any Hereticks or Apo∣states have done the like: Not onely abandoning and rejecting all Civil Power and Authority, (except moulded according to their own Fancies) but belching out errours in their <HI>Famili∣stical

In fine, the said <HI>Gorton</HI> and his fellow Prisoners were several of them Sentenced to remain in durance in several Towns of the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> for six Months, and afterwards Banished.</P>
<P>He was a subtile Deceiver, courteous in his carriage to all at some times (for his own ends) but soon moved with passion, and so lost that which he gained upon the simple. To shut up what I have to say concerning him, which is sad; He is since become a for did man in his life, as he hath been declared to be in his cursed Principles and Opinions, and hath not shunned to say and affirm, That all the felicity we are like to have, we must expect in this life, and no more: and therefore advised one with whom he had some speech, to <HI>make much of her self, for she must expect no more but what she could enjoy in this life;</HI> or words to the same effect.

<P>This year three men were Executed for Robbing and Mur∣thering an <HI>Indian</HI> near <HI>Providence,</HI> which besides the Evidence that came against them, they did in substance Confess against themselves, and were Condemned by Legal Tryal. Some have thought it great severity, to Hang three <HI>English</HI> for one <HI>Indian;</HI> but the more Considerate will easily satisfie themselves for the Legality of it: and indeed, should we suffer their Murtherers to go unpunished, we might justly fear that God would suffer them to take a more sharp Revenge. By such Arguments was the Government of Plimouth moved by the Government of the Massachusets to do Justice in the case. And here may be noted, That the <HI>Massachusets</HI> refused this Tryal, as being com∣mitted in the Jurisdiction of <HI>Plimouth;</HI> and they of <HI>Road∣Island</HI> having Apprehended them, delivered them to the afore∣said Jurisdiction of <HI>Plimouth</HI> on the same grounds.</P>
<P>This Year, about the second of <HI>June,</HI> there was a great and fearful Earthquake: It was heard before it came with a rumbling Noise, or low murmure, like unto remote Thunder. It came from the Northwards, and passed Southwards: as the Noise approached near, the Earth began to quake; and it came at length with that violence, as caused Platters, Dishes,

and such like things which stood upon Shelves, to clatter and fall down; yea, people were afraid of their Houses: and it was so, that some being without doors could not stand, but were sain to catch hold of Posts and Pales to prevent them from falling. About half an hour after, or less, came another Noise and shaking, but not so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d nor strong as the former.

Brewster,</HI> the Ruling Elder of the Church of Christ at <HI>Plimouth;</HI> concerning whom, I could say much of mine own knowledge; but I shall content my self, only to insert the ho∣nourable Testimony that Mr. <HI>William Bradford</HI> deceased, hath left written with his own hand, concerning him.</P>
<P>Saith he, <HI>My dear Friend Mr.</HI> William Brewster <HI>was a man that had done and suffered much for the Lord Jesus, and the Gospels sake, and hath born his part in weal and woe, with this poor persecuted Church, above thirty six years, in</HI> England, Holland, <HI>and in this</HI> Wilderness; <HI>and done the Lord and them faithful ser∣vice in his place and calling: and notwithstanding the many troubles and sorrows he passed through, the Lord upheld him to a great age; he was four score and four years of age when he died; he had this</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The death of Mr. <HI>William Brewster.</HI></NOTE> <HI>blessing added by the Lord to all the rest, to dye in his bed in peace a∣mongst the midst of his friends, who mourned and wept over him, and ministred what help and comfort they could unto him; and he again recompensed them whiles he could: his sickness was not long, and until the last day thereof, he did not wholly keep his bed, his speech continued until somewhat more then half a day before his death, and then failed him, and about nine or ten of the clock that evening he died without any pangs at all; a few hours before, he drew his breath short, and some few minutes before his last, he drew his breath long, as a man fallen into a found sleep, without any pangs or gasping, and so sweetly departed this life unto a better.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I would now demand of any, What he was the worse for former sufferings? what, do I say worse? no, he was the better, and they now added to his honor:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thess. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 5,6,7.</NOTE> It is a manifest token <HI>(faith the Apostle)</HI> of the righteous Judgement of God, that we may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which we also suffer; seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recompen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you who are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels; and if you be reproached <HI>(faith the Apostle <NOTE PLACE="marg">I Per. 4. 14.</NOTE> Peter)</HI> for the Name of Christ, happy are ye, for the Spi∣rit of God and of Glory shall rest upon you: <HI>what though he wanted the riches and pleasures of the World in this life, and Pom∣pous

monuments of his Funeral? yet</HI> the memorial of the Just <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 1217.</NOTE> shall be blessed, when the name of the wicked shall not <HI>(with their Marble Monuments.) He was well educated in learning, as at inseriour Schools, so also at the University; and from thence went to the Court, and there served Mr.</HI> Davison <HI>a godly Gentleman, and Secretary of State to Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>and attended him on his Embassage into</HI> Holland, <HI>and was imployed by him in matters of greatest trust; as in keeping of the Keys of the Cautionary Towns delivered up to him for her Majesty, and things of the like nature; his Master would alwayes in private confer with him as a friend or equal: he afterwards lived in good esteem in his own Country, and did much good, until the troubles of those times enforced his remove into</HI> Holland, <HI>and so into</HI> New-England, <HI>and was in both places of singular use and benefit to the Church and People of</HI> Plimouth <HI>whereof he was; being eminently qualified for such work as the Lord had appointed him unto, of which should I speak particularly as I might, I should prove tedious: I shall content my self therefore only to have made honorable mention in general of so worthy a man.</HI></P>
<P>And here I might take occasion to mention with admiration, the marvellous providence of God, that notwithstanding the many changes and hardships that this people, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the first Plan∣ters at <HI>New-Plimouth</HI> went through, and the many Enemies they had, and difficulties they met withal, that so many of them should live until very old age: It was not only this Reverend mans condition, but many more of them did the like; some dying before and about this time, and some living, who attained to sixty years of age, and to sixty five, divers to seventy, and some to more then eighty as he did: It must needs be more then or∣dinary, and above natural reason that so it should be; for it is found in experience, that changing of Air, Famine, and un∣wholsome Food, much drinking of Water, Sorrows and Troubles &amp;<HI>c.</HI> all of them are enemies to health, causes of much diseases, consumers of natural vigor, and the bodies of men, and shortners of life; and yet of all these things they had a large and long part, and suffered deeply in the same:
<PB N="119" REF="000144_0129_0FA2B264506868B0"/>
they went from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> where they found both worse Air &amp; Diet, then that they came from; from thence, endu∣ring a long imprisonment in the ships at Sea into <HI>New-England;</HI> &amp; how it hath been with them here hath already been shewn, &amp; what crosses, troubles, fears, wants and sorrows they have been liable unto, is easily to be discerned, so as in some sort they may say with the Apostle, <HI>they were in Journeys often, in perils of</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">I Cor. II. 26. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Waters, in perils of Robbers, in perils of their own Nation, in perils amongst the Heathen, in perils in the Wilderness, in perils in the Sea, in perils amongst false Brethren, in weariness, in painful∣ness, in watching often, in hunger, thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakedness:</HI> What was it then that upheld them? It was Gods visitation that preserved their spirits; he that upheld the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 10. 12. 2 Cor. 4. 9. 2 Cor. 96.</NOTE> Apostle, upheld them: <HI>They were persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but perished not, as unknown and yet known, as dying and be-hold we live, as chastened and yet not killed.</HI></P>
<P>God (it seems) would have all men behold such works of his Providence, as these are towards his people, that they in like cases might be incouraged to depend upon him in their trials, and also bless his Name when they see his goodness to∣wards others; <HI>Man lives not by bread only:</HI> It is not dainty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 8. 3.</NOTE> fare, peace, rest and hearts ease, in enjoying contentments and good things of this World only, that preserves health and pro∣longs life: God (in such examples) would have the World take notice, that he can do it without them; and if the World will shut their eyes and take no notice thereof, yet he would have his people to see and consider it: <HI>Daniel</HI> could be in better liking with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulse,</HI> then with the Kings dainties; <HI>Jacob,</HI> though he went from one Nation to another People, and passed through Famine, Fears and many afflictions, yet he lived until old age, and died sweetly and rested in the Lord, as many others of Gods servants have done, and still do through Gods goodness, not∣withstanding all the malice of their enemies; <HI>When the branch <NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 15. 32. Psal. 55. 23.</NOTE> of the wicked shall be cut off before his day, and the bloody and de∣ceitful man shall not live out half his dayes.</HI></P>
<P>By reason of the plotting of the <HI>Narrhagansets</HI> ever since the
<PB N="120" REF="000144_0130_0FA2B265002ED060"/>

<P>About the middle of <HI>May</HI> this Year, there came three Men of War into <HI>Plimouth Harbour,</HI> under the command of Captain <HI>Thomas Cromwel,</HI> who had taken several Prizes from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by Commission from the Earl of <HI>Warwick:</HI> they were full of monies, silks, and other rich goods, some of which they left behinde them. They were a company of lusty stout men, but very unruly and hard to govern; notwithstanding the care and vigilance, both of such as were in Authority of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and also of their own Commanders, who could hard∣ly restrain them, especially from inordinate drinking and quar∣relling: It proved fatal to one of them, who being quarrelling with one of their own company, and being commanded by their Captain to forbear, he giving very provoking Language, and also attempting to draw upon his Captain; he took his Rapier from him, and struck him on the head, with the Hilt, of which wound, three or four dayes after he died: the Captain was tried by a Council of War, and acquitted by the largeness of his Commission.</P>
<P>This Year Mr. <HI>Edward Winslow</HI> went for <HI>England,</HI> upon occasion that some discontented persons, under the Govern∣ment of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> sought to trouble their peace, and
<PB N="124" REF="000144_0134_0FA2B269A9955ED8"/> 
disturb, if not innovate their Government, by laying many scandals upon them, and intended to prosecute against them in <HI>England,</HI> by petitioning and Complaining to the <HI>Parliament.</HI> Also <HI>Samuel Gorton</HI> and his company, made complaint against them; so as they made choice of Mr. <HI>Winslow</HI> to be their Agent to make their defence, and gave him Commission and Instructions for that end; in which he so carried himself, as did well answer their ends, and cleared them from any blame and dishonour, to the shame of their Adversaries. After this he fell upon other imployments in <HI>English,</HI> which detained him there, so as he returned not again to <HI>New-England</HI> any more, whose absence hath been much to the weakening of the Go∣vernment of <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> who had large experience of his help and usefulness amongst them in Government, &amp;<HI>C.</HI> of whom I have more to insert in honour of so worthy a Gentleman in its more proper place.</P>

<P>This Year Mr. <HI>John Winthrop</HI> Governour of the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> deceased, the twenty sixth day of <HI>March,</HI> about ten of the clock. He was singular for Piety, Wisdom, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The death of</HI> Mr. Winthrop.</NOTE> and of a publick spirit: he brought over a great estate into the Country, and partly by his liberality, &amp; partly by the unfaithful∣ness of his Baily, spent the most part of it, so as when he died, he
<PB N="131" REF="000144_0141_0FA2B27110AA1918"/>
was but low in that respect: and yet notwithstanding, very much honoured and beloved of the most, and continued in the place of Governour for the most part until his death, which was much lamented by many. He was a man of unbyassed Justice, patient in respect of personal wrongs and injuries, a great lover of the Saints, especially able Ministers of the Gospel, very sober in desiring, and temperate in improving earthly contentments; very humble, courteous, and studious of general good. His body was with great solemnity and honour, buried at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> the third of <HI>April,</HI> 1649.</P>
<P>This year some parts of the Country was much troubled with numerable hosts of <HI>Caterpillers,</HI> which destroyed the fruits of the earth in divers places; and did eat off the leaves of the trees, so as they looked as bare as if it had been winter:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An innumerable company of cat∣terpillers in some parts of the Country.</HI></NOTE> and in some places did eat the leaves from off the Pease straw, and did not eat the Pease. It pleased God to give them a check, and a rebuke, so as they hurt but in some places, and of his good∣ness in short time removed them.</P>
<P>This Year <HI>August</HI> 25. that faithful and eminent servant of Christ Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard</HI> died, who was a soul-searching Minister of the Gospel, and Pastor of the Church of Christ at <HI>Cambridge.</HI> By his death not only that Church and people, but also all <HI>New-England</HI> sustained a very great loss: he not only preached the Gospel profitably and very successively, but also hath left behinde him divers worthy works of special use, in reference unto the clearing up the state of the soul to God-ward; the benefit thereof, those can best experience, who are most con∣versant in the improving of them, and have Gods blessing on them therein to their souls good. His body was honourably buried at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, for their works follow them,</HI> Rev 3. 13.</P>
<P>This Year there passed an Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> for the promoting and propagating the Gospel of Jesus Christ a∣mongst the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI> in reference unto the furtherance and advancement of so good a work, a Corpora∣tion
<PB N="132" REF="000144_0142_0FA2B271C4504B38"/>
of sixteen Select men were appointed, consisting of a Pre∣sident, Treasurer, and Assistants, called by the name of the President and Society for the propagation of the Gospel in <HI>New-England,</HI> to receive such sums of money, as from time to time was, or should be collected and raised by the liberal contributions of such as whose hearts God was pleased to stir up to so glorious a work; and it was by the same Parliament Enacted, that the Commissioners for the United Colonies of <HI>New-England,</HI> for the time being, by themselves or such as they shall appoint, shall have Power and Authority to receive and dispose of the said <HI>monies</HI> brought in &amp; paid to the said Treasurer for the time being, or any other Monies, Goods or Commodities acquired and delivered by the care of the said Corporation at any time: whose receipt or receipts of such Person or Persons so Authorized by them, shall be a sufficient discharge to the said Corporation and Treasurer. The particulars of such Orders and Instructions, with which the said Act is invested, the Reader may be more amply satisfied in, by the perusat thereof, as it is extant bearing date, <HI>July</HI> 27. 1649.</P>
<P>Moreover, let the Reader take notice of the special favour of Almighty God, in moving the heart of the <HI>Kings Majesty,</HI> since his Restitution to his Crown and Regal Dignity, particularly of his Royal Favour to countenance this work, and to secure what hath been, and what may be given toward this work, by a legal settlement, which before was wanting; so as the said glorious design hath been vigorously carried on, both in <HI>Old England</HI> and in <HI>New,</HI>
by such active and faithful Instruments as God hath raised up and improved therein, with some conside∣rable success. The work coming on to such perfection, as that the Holy Bible is Translated and Printed in the <HI>Indian Language,</HI> whereby the glad tidings of the Gospel is, and may be commu∣nicated to them with the greater facility: some souls also of them being gained (as may be hoped) to believe on the Lord Jesus for life everlasting; and daily hopes of further and greater success in that behalf, for which unspeakable riches of his grace, let his Holy Name have all the praise throughout all ages.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas Dudley,</HI> who was a principal Founder and Pil∣lar of the Colony of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and sundry times Governour and Deputy Governour of that Ju∣risdiction, died at his house in <HI>Roxbury,</HI> July 31. in the seventy seventh Year of his age: he was a person of quick un∣derstanding, and solid Judgement in the fear of the Lord; he was a lover of (1) Justice. (2) Order. (3) the People. (4) Chri∣stian Religion; the supream virtues of a good Magistrate. 1. His love to Justice appeared at all times, and in special upon the judgement seat, without respect of persons in Judgement: and in his own particular transactions, with all men he was exact and exemplary. 2. His zeal to Order appeared in con∣triving good Laws, and faithfully executing them upon criminal offenders, Hereticks, and Underminers of true Religion. He had a piercing Judgement to discover the Wolf, though cloached
<PB N="140" REF="000144_0150_0FA2B27C644D6560"/>
with a sheep-skin. 3. His love to the People was evident in serving them in a publick capacity many Years, at his own cost, and that as a nursing Father to the Churches of Christ. 4. He loved the true Christian Religion, and the pure Worship of God, and cherished as in his bosom, all godly Ministers and Christians: he was exact in the practice of Piety, in his person and family all his life; in a word, he lived desired, and died lamented by all good men.</P>

<P>This Worthy Gentleman was interred with the greatest so∣lemnities that the Jurisdiction to which he belonged was in a capacity to perform: many deep sighs, as well as loud volleys of shot, declaring that the People were no less sensible of their own loss, who were surviving, then mindful of the worth and honour of him that was deceased; you might now easily discern a heavy heart in the mournful countenance of every sober minded and considerate man: for as you have heard in the three or four Years last past, God was pleased greatly to weaken this poor tottering Colony of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> by taking away several of the most usefull Props thereof, both in Church and Civil State; some others who had been of singular use, now stooping under the infirmities of old age, could not be so serviceable as in times past; and others removed so far from the center of the Government, that they could not without great difficulties attend their publick concerns, nor could possibly so constantly as our necessities required, which did greatly aggravate our troubles: we were become weak, when we had need of greatest strength; had lost many of our Chiestains, when we stood in need of the best conduct and guidance: for besides the troubles and changes that then attended our Native Country, and might call for great cir∣cumspection in our walking in relation unto them; we had also at this very time, some amongst us that growing weary of the long peace and concord that we had enjoyed, and hoping to fish better in troubled waters, when their bait might be taken in, and the hook not easily discerned, would willingly have been

ringing the Changes in this Jurisdiction also, pretending a great zeal for liberty of Conscience, but endeavouring to in∣troduce such a liberty of Will, as would have proved prejudicial, if not destructive to Civil and Church societies: and at the same time there arrived in the said Colony many of that pernicious sect called <HI>Quakers</HI> whose Opinion are a composition of many errors, and whose practices tend greatly to the disturbance both of Church and State; many unstable people amongst us were leavened with their errors, and proved very troublesome to this as well as other Colonies in <HI>New-England.</HI> But the Lord many times delighteth to appear in the Mount of his Peoples miseries, distresses and troubles, that his power and wisdom may appear when they are weakest, and that they may know that their salvation is from him. At such a time, &amp; when the condition of this Colony was such as hath been declared, God was pleased to minde it, even in its low estate, and when he had taken to himself not only our <HI>Moses,</HI> but many of the Elders and Worthies of our <HI>Israel,</HI> he hath not hither to les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us without a <HI>Jo∣shua</HI> to lead us in the remaining part of our pilgrimage. When the usual time for the renewing of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of such as should govern us came, Mr. <HI>Thomas Prince</HI> was by unanimous vote chosen Governour; and although mens spirits were so distem∣pered as I have related, and it might have been expected that they would have been much divided in their choice; yet God (who disposeth the lot that is cast into the lap) so disposed that all their votes centered there: a good demonstration that he was chosen of God for us, and by his blessing made an Instru∣ment of much peace and settlement in this place, and to this people, in these times of trouble and confusion. The Lord also directing the Freemen of this Jurisdiction at the same time in their Election to the choice of a discreet and able Council, to be assistant unto our said honoured Governor in this so weighty Work, divers of them being desrended of several of the honour'd Magistrates deceased; not only bearing their Names, but having a large measure of their Spirit bellowed on them, besitting them for such Work; so as through the goodness of God, those

storms that seem'd to the eaten the subversion of our All, and did at first prevaile, to the disturbing and shaking of many Towns and Churches, and to the great discouragement of the Mini∣sters in divers places, do seem to be pretty well blown over; such uncomfortable jarrs (as have been sometimes thought un∣cureabie) seem to be throughly reconciled and healed, our Towns for the most part supplied with godly and able Mini∣sters, and we sit under our Vines and Figtrees in peace, enjoy∣ing both Civil and Religious Liberties: For which goodness of the Lord, let his holy Name be praised; and may he grant us for to improve our present opportunities, as he may have some suitable returns, and we may have cause to hope in his grace for the continuance of such favours.</P>

by Office a Deacon of the Church of Christ at <HI>Plimouth</HI>) and in other respects very officious as occasion did require. He having a great Temporal Estate, was occasioned thereby to have abundance of business upon him: but when he was to put off this his earthly Tabernacle, he laid aside all his earthly Incumbrances and Occasions, even as one would have taken off a garment, and laid it down; and without any trouble of Spirit (on that behalf) prepared himself for his Journey to the Everlasting Mansions, prepared for him by his Lord and Ma∣ster in the highest Heavens, whereof he was well assured; as to the like effect he spake some words to Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> near unto the period of his life: and so falling asleep in the Lord, he was buried at <HI>Boston</HI> with honour and great lamentation, in the year and moneth above-mentioned.</P>

</P>
<P>Having noted before, That in the Year 1657. there arrived in the Colony of <HI>New-Plimouth</HI> many of that pernicious Sect called <HI>Quakers,</HI> the Reader may take notice, That by this time, and for some years after, <HI>New-England</HI> (in divers parts of it) abounded with them, and they sowed their corrupt and damnable Doctrines, both by word and writings, almost in every Town of each Jurisdiction; some whereof were, <HI>That all men ought to attend to the Light within them to be the Rule of their Lives and Actions;</HI> and, <HI>That the holy Scriptures were not for the inlightning of man, nor a setled and permanent Rule of life.</HI> They denied the Manhood of the Lord Jesus Christ, and affirmed, <HI>That as Man he is not in Heaven.</HI> They denied the Resurrection from the dead. They affirmed, <HI>That an absolute Perfection in Holiness or Grace is attainable in this life.</HI> They placed their Justification upon their Patience and Suffering for their Opinions, and on their righteous life, and retired demu∣rity, and affected singularity both in word and gesture.</P>
<P>As to Civil account, they allowed not nor practised any civil respect to man, though superiours, either in Magistratical con∣sideration, or as Masters, or Parents, or the Ancient, neither by word nor gesture. They deny also the use of Oathes for
<PB N="158" REF="000144_0168_0FA2B29537A61800"/>
the deciding of Civil Controversies; with other abominable Opinions, Dreams, and Conceits, which some of them have expressed, tending to gross Blasphemy and Atheism.</P>
<P>This efficacy of Delusion became very prevalent with many, so as the number of them increased, to the great endangering of the subversion of the whole, both of Church and Common∣wealth, notwithstanding the endeavours of those in Authority to suppress the same, had not the Lord declared against them, by blasting their Enterprizes &amp; Contrivements, so as they have of late withered away in a great measure; sundry of their Teachers and Leaders which have caused them to erre, are de∣parted the Country, and we trust the Lord will make the folly of the remainder manifest to all men more and more. Errour is not long-lived: the day will declare it. Let our deliverance from so emine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a danger, be received amongst the principal of the Lords gracious Providences, and merciful loving kindnesses towards <HI>New-England;</HI> for the which let present and future generations celebrate his Praises.</P>
<P>This year that Learned and godly Servant of God, Mr. <HI>Henry Dunster,</HI> fell asleep in the Lord. He was sometimes Pre∣sident of <HI>Harvard</HI> Colledge at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> in which he approved himself to the satisfaction of such as were in those Affairs concerned. Afterwards he came into the Ju∣risdiction of <HI>New-Plimouth,</HI> and lived awhile in the Town of <HI>Scituate,</HI> and was useful in helping to oppose the abominable Opinions of the <HI>Quakers</HI> fore-mentioned, and in the defend∣ing of the Truth against them. He deceasing in the said Town of <HI>Soituate,</HI> his Body was embalmed, and removed unto <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI> aforesaid, and there honourably buried.</P>

<P>This year, on the 26 of <HI>January,</HI> at the shutting in of the Evening, there was a very great Earthquake in <HI>New-England,</HI> and the same night another, although something less then the former.</P>
<P>And again, on the 28 of the same moneth there was another about Nine of the clock in the morning.</P>
<P>Forasmuch as I have had special occasion several times in this History to mention divers Earthquakes that have been in <HI>New∣England,</HI> they being great and terrible works of God, and are usually ominous to some; strokes and visitations of his hand unto places and peoples where they are; and sometimes the Lord in the very acting of his power in them, hath declared his severity to the children of men, to their great overthrow and confusion:</P>
<P>I thought it necessary, before I pass on, a little to point at some few particulars, to work and induce us to a profitable remembrance of them; it being very considerable that is said by a useful Author, in taking notice of the Wisdome of God, in preparing the Earth to be a fit Habitation for man to dwell in, addeth withall, <HI>That as if man were not always worthy to tread upon so solid a foundation, we see it oft-times quake and shake, and rock and rend it self, as if it shewed that he which made it threatned by this trembling the Impiety of the world, and the ruine of those that dwell on the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>In order unto that which I have nominated in this behalf, and more principally intend, let us take notice, That Writers have rendred the cause of Earthquakes to be, <HI>That when it
<PB N="162" REF="000144_0172_0FA2B299C52E33D0"/>
happeneth that Air and windy Spirits and Exhalations are shut up in the Caverns of the Earth, or have such passage as is too nar∣row for them, they then striving to break their prisons, shake the Earth, and make it tremble.</HI> They speak likewise of the seve∣ral kindes of them: as</P>
<P>First, When the whole force of the Wind driveth to one place, there being no contrary motion to let or hinder it; many Hills and Buildings have been rushed down by this kinde of Earthquake, especially when the Wind causing it was strong: for if it be a feeble Wind, it onely looseneth or unfasteneth Foundations; if less feeble, then without further harm the Earth onely shakes, like one sick of an Ague.</P>
<P>Secondly, The second kinde is a swelling of the Earth; the which, when the Wind is broken out of its prison, the Earth returns to its place again.</P>
<P>Thirdly, A third kinde is, A gaping, rending, or cleaving of the Earth one part from another, so that sometimes whole Towns, Cities, Rocks, Hills, Rivers, and some parts of the Sea hath been swallowed up, and never seen more.</P>
<P>Fourthly, A fourth kinde is, Shaking that causeth sinking, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thus was the Atlantick Oce∣an caused to be a Sea, as Plato affirmeth, who lived 366 years before Christ was born.</HI></NOTE> and is farre different from the former; for now the Earth splitteth not, but sinketh: this being in such places where though the surface of the ground be solid, yet it hath but a salt foundation, which being moistened by water driven through it by the force of the shaking Exhalation, is turned into water also.</P>
<P>Fifthly, A fifth kinde of Earthquake is contrary to the for∣mer; for as before the ground sinks down, so now it is cast up, like as in the second kinde already mentioned: onely this is the difference, that now it returneth not to its place again, but remains a great Mountain. And note, that if such a Rising be in the Sea, it not onely causeth overflowings, but produceth likewise many Islands, such as were never seen before.</P>
<P>These particulars are treated of at large by approved Au∣thors, and here onely hinted, to the intent that we may take notice of the special Providence of God to <HI>New-England</HI> in
<PB N="163" REF="000144_0173_0FA2B29A37141CE8"/>
this behalf, that we have not as yet felt the misery of the worst of the kindes of Earthquakes forenamed, nor swallowed up in them, but those we have been sensible of have been rather gentle Warnings unto us, to snake us out of our earthly∣mindedness, spiritual security, and other sins, left the Lord do come against us with Judgements of this kinde in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orest and worst sort of them, or otherwise by removing the pre∣sent blessing of godly Government from us.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding that which hath been said, the Efficient Cause is Supernatural, as either principally <HI>God,</HI> or instrumen∣tally the <HI>Angels,</HI> although naturally the Wind shut up within the Pores and Bowels of the Earth, as is before-noted.</P>

<P>THis Year Mr. <HI>Thomas Prince</HI> was Chosen Governour of the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-Plimouth:</HI>

<P>This year Mr. <HI>Samuel Newman;</HI> Teacher of the Church of Christ at <HI>Reboboth,</HI> changed this life for a better. He was sometimes Preacher of Gods Word at <HI>Weymouth</HI> in the Juris∣diction of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> and from thence removed to <HI>Re∣hoboth,</HI> where he continued in the Work of the Ministry untill the end of his dayes.

of spirit resigned himself up to the Lord, and his Spirit into arms of his blessed Redeemer, desiring that the holy Angels might do their office in transporting his Soul into everlasting bliss and happiness. He fell asleep in the Lord on the the fifth of <HI>July</HI> 1663.</P>
<P>This year also it pleased God to put a speedy period to the life of Mr. <HI>John Norton,</HI> who was <HI>a burning and a shining Light;</HI> and although the Church of <HI>Boston</HI> in a more special manner felt the smart of this sudden blow, yet it reflected upon the whole Land. He was singularly endowed with the Tongue of the Learned, inabled to speak a word in due season, not onely to the wearied Soul, but also a word of Counsel to a people in necessity thereof, being not onely a wise Steward of the things of Jesus Christ, but also a wise Statesman; so that the whole Land sustained a great loss of him. At his first coming over into <HI>New-England,</HI> he arrived at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> where he abode the best part of one Winter, and Preached the Gospel of the Kingdome unto them; and ever after to his dying day retained a good affection unto them: From thence he went to <HI>Boston,</HI> and from thence to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pswich</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> where he was chosen the Teacher of their Church; and after the death of worthy Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> he was sollicited, and at length obtained to return to <HI>Boston,</HI> and there served in that Office untill his death. He was chosen by the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Massa∣chusets,</HI> together with the much honoured Mr. <HI>Simon Brad∣street,</HI> to go over into <HI>England</HI> as Agents in the behalf of that Jurisdiction, unto His Majesty and the Privy-Council, upon Business of greatest Trust and Concernment; and soon after his Return, it pleased God suddenly and unexpectedly to take him away by death on the fifthday of <HI>April,</HI> 1663.

<P>THis Year Mr. <HI>Thomas Prince</HI> was Chosen Governour of the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-Plimouth:</HI>


Mr. <HI>William Collier,</HI>


Mr. <HI>John Alden,</HI>


Captain <HI>Thomas Willet,</HI>

Capt. <HI>William Bradford,</HI>&amp;


Mr. <HI>Thomas Hinkley,</HI>
were Chosen Assistants to him in Government.

</P>
<P>This year a <HI>Blazing-Star</HI> or <HI>Comet</HI> appeared in <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> in the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and the beginning of the Twelfth Moneth: Concerning which, it hath been observed, That such was its motion, that in all likelihood it was visible to all the Inhabitants of the Earth; and that also in its motion the <HI>Blaze</HI> of it did turn to all the quarters of the World; and that by its turning according to the several Aspects it had to the Sun, it was no fiery Meteor caused by Exhalation, but that it was sent immediately by God to awake the secure World.</P>
<P>I willingly close with that which Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth</HI> hath Religiously observed, as to the <HI>Theol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gical Application</HI> of this strange and notable Appearance in the Heavens, <HI>That indeed by the Testimony of the Sacred Scriptures, and the common Histo∣ries of former Ages,</HI> Comets <HI>do usually precede, and portend great Calamit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and notable Changes.</HI></P>
<P>To adde a few more Instances to those the said Author hath well observed.</P>
<P>When the Emperour <HI>Jovian</HI> attained to the Empire, (suc∣ceeding the Apostata <HI>Julian,</HI> under whom the Church suffered much Persecution) and that under him both Church and Commonwealth were like to have had a flourishing time, had
<PB REF="000144_0181_0FA2B2A45C3E9B28"/>
he not been taken away by sudden death; Then also appeared <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Socrates, lib. 4. Cap. 22.</HI></NOTE> <HI>a Comet,</HI> shewing that further trouble was yet to be expected to the Church.</P>
<P>Again, other Authors make mention of a strange <HI>Comet</HI> that was seen in the year of Christ 410, being like a Two∣edged Sword, which portended many Mischiefs and Calamities that happened both in the East and West, and such great slaughters of men were about those dayes, as no Age ever afforded the like: All <HI>Europe</HI> was in a manner undone; no small part of <HI>Asia</HI> was affrighted; and <HI>Africa</HI> also was not void of those Evils, as War, Famine, Drought and Pestilence: all of them strove as it were to trouble the whole World.</P>
<P>Also in the Years 1400, 1401, 1402, 1403, <HI>Comets</HI> ap∣peared, and great Calamities followed; sundry unheard-of Diseases were felt, Rivers dried up, and Plagues were increased; <HI>TamerLain,</HI> King of the <HI>Scythians</HI> and <HI>Parthians,</HI> with an in∣numerable <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reade <HI>Carion, lib. 5. pag 854.</HI></NOTE> Host invaded <HI>Asia,</HI> calling himself <HI>The Wrath of God, and Desolation of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Also in the Year 1529 appeared four <HI>Comets;</HI> and in the Years 1530, 1532, and 1533, were seen in each year one.</P>
<P><HI>Lanquet</HI> faith, That there were three within the space of two years, upon which these and the like Calamities followed, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> A great Swea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Sickness in <HI>England,</HI> which took away great multitudes of people; The <HI>Turk</HI> in the quarrel of <HI>John Vuavoyda,</HI> who laid Claim to the Crown of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> entred the said Kingdome with Two hundred and fifty thousand fight∣ing Souldiers, committing against the Inhabitants thereof most harsh and unspeakable Murthers, Rapes, Villanies and Cru∣elties.</P>
<P>Great Famine and Dearth in <HI>Venice,</HI> and the Countries thereabouts, which swept away many; The Sweating Sickness in <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bant,</HI> and in a great part of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>Great Wars likewise about the Dukedome of <HI>Millain,</HI> be∣tween the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and <HI>Francis</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King.</P>
<P>About that time also all <HI>Lusitania</HI> or <HI>Portugal</HI> was struck
<PB N="172" REF="000144_0182_0FA2B2A4CC8692D0"/>
with an Earthquake, insomuch that at <HI>Ulisippo,</HI> or <HI>Lisbon,</HI> above a Thousand Houses were thrown down, and Sixty more so shaken that they were ready to fall: with many other Evils that besell those parts about that time.</P>
<P>And to observe what hath fallen out since this last <HI>Comet</HI> ap∣peared, will not be unuseful, either in <HI>Europe,</HI> or in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Europe,</HI> the great Contest between our own Nation and the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Since the wri∣ting her of there have been sad engagements betwixt the two Nations, and much Blood spilt.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Dutch,</HI> which hath threatned bloody War; and what will be in the conclusion, is known onely to God: Besides other Contests between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and some other of their Neigh∣bours; as also the Pestilence very hot both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>America,</HI> the late and sad blow that our Countrymen at the Isle <HI>Christophers</HI> received from the <HI>French.</HI> And as to our selves in <HI>New-England,</HI> although through the mercy of our good God there is no breaking in, nor going out into Capti∣vity, nor complaining in our streets; yet we have been threat∣ned with Invasion by Forreign Force, and sometimes in ex∣pectation thereof; as also we are not to slight the hand of God in his late fore Strokes in taking away so many by Thun∣der and Lightning, to the great amazement and terrour of many: as also Gods continued strokes in Drought, Blasting, and Mildew, with which much of the Fruits of the Earth have been destroyed. All which considered, ought to induce us to search and try our wayes, and to enter into a strict and serious examination of our hearts and lives, and having found out what those sins are that are most provoking to the Majesty of Heaven, we may reform them, whether in Church, in State, in Family, or in Persons; that so he may <HI>not stir up all his <NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 1. 78 38.</NOTE> wrath, but yet may delight over us to do us good, from the begin∣ning of the year to the end thereof.</HI></P>
<P>This year it pleased God to smite the Fruits of the Earth, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Wheat in special, with Blasting and Mildew, whereby much of it was utterly spoiled, and became profitable for no∣thing, and much of it worth little, being light and empty. This was looked at by the judicious and conscientious of the
<PB N="173" REF="000144_0183_0FA2B2A77A2D20A0"/>
Land, as a speaking Providence against the <HI>Unthankfulness</HI> of many for so great a mercy, and their <HI>Murmuring</HI> expressed in their words, by slighting and undervaluing terms of it: as also against Voluptuousness, and abuse of the good Creatures of God by Licentiousness in Drinking, and Fashions in Apparel; for the obtaining whereof, a great part of this principal Grain was oftentimes unnecessarily expended. This so sad a Dispensa∣tion, with other particulars, occasioned the observation of some dayes in a way of Humiliation before the Lord, somewhat more frequently then ordinary. Let it also be observed, That yet <HI>in judgement he remembred mercy,</HI> by affording a plentiful Harvest of other sorts of Grain, so as the Country suffered not in respect of the want of Bread this year, but had plenty thereof.</P>
<P>This year also His Majesties Commissioners, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Colonel <HI>Richard Nicolls,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Carre</HI> Knight, <HI>George Cartwright</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>Samuel Maverick</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Arrived at <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New∣England</HI> in the moneth of <HI>July:</HI> The tenour of whose Com∣mission was in special, <HI>To reduce the</HI> Dutch <HI>at the</HI> Manhato's <HI>to His Majesties Obedience;</HI> which in some short time was accom∣plished, and the Place and Jurisdiction thereof surrendred up unto His Majesties said Commissioners, who styled it by the Name of <HI>New-York,</HI> and placed a Government over it of His Majesties Subjects, the aforesaid honourable Colonel <HI>Richard Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olls</HI> being Governour in chief there. And whereas they were likewise Commissionated <HI>To hear and determine such Dif∣ferences as might be amongst the Colonies, in respect unto the Bounds of their Jurisdictions;</HI> Some such Differences were by them heard, and in special betwixt <HI>Plimouth</HI> and <HI>Road-Island,</HI> and such Settlement therein concluded as they were capacitated unto. As also sundry Propositions were by them made to several of the respective Jurisdictions, which together with the Agitations concerning them, and the Answers unto them, are elsewhere extant.

They will let you know the resolution we have to preserve all your Liberties and Priviledges, both Ecclesiastical and Civil, without the least violation; which we presume will dispose you to manifest by all wayes in your power, Loyalty and Affection to us, that all the world may know that you do look upon your selves as being as much our Subjects, and living under the same obedience under us, as if you continued in your natural Country.

<P>In the Spring of this Year, that honourable Gentleman Mr. <HI>John Endicot,</HI> Governour of the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> changed this life for a better. He was a very virtuous Gentleman, and was greatly honoured and loved of the most, as he well deserved. He arrived at <HI>Salem</HI> in the year 1628,
<PB N="177" REF="000144_0187_0FA2B2AC4AAB00B8"/>
and had the chief Command of those that at the first there seated, and bare a deep share of the Difficulties of those first beginnings, which were great, by reason especially of the great Sickness and Mortality that was then amongst them, as hath been before-noted: There he continued, untill the Juris∣diction of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> saw reason to desire his removal to <HI>Boston,</HI> for the more convenient Administration of Justice, as Governour of the said Jurisdiction, to which he was frequent∣ly Elected for many years together with little intermission; and in which honourable Service he served God and the Coun∣try, untill old Age, and the Infirmities thereof, coming upon him, he fell asleep in the Lord, and was with great honour and solemnity Interred at <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>This year it pleased God to cause a sad dispensation of his hand to pass before us, in reference to the sudden death of Captain <HI>Davenport,</HI> who in the Mone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of <HI>July</HI> was slain as he lay on his Bed with a blow of Thunder and Lightning. He was a man of some Eminency, being betrusted with the Com∣mand of the Castle in the <HI>Massachusets;</HI> at which said Castle he was slain as aforesaid: The more ought this so sad stroke of God to be considered, and laid to heart, and improved for our humiliation, and the amendment of our lives before the great and terrible God, who so aloud spake unto us in this so sad and awing a Providence.</P>
<P>This year it pleased the Lord again to strike the Wheat of this Country in a more general way then the last year, with Blasting and Mildew, whereby the greatest part of it was spoiled, and the Plowmans hopes (in that respect) very much frustrated. Howbeit, the Lord still mixed with this affliction very much mercy, in sparing the other Grain, whereby the Country was in some good measure supplied.</P>

<P>THis Year Mr. <HI>Thomas Prince</HI> was Chosen Governour of the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-Plimouth:</HI>


Mr. <HI>John Alden,</HI>


Major <HI>Josias Winslow,</HI>


Capt. <HI>Thomas Southworth,</HI>


Capt. <HI>William Bradford</HI>

Mr. <HI>James Brown,</HI> &amp;


Lieut. <HI>John Freeman,</HI>
were chosen to be his Assist∣ants in Government.

</P>
<P>This year it pleased God to go on in a manifestation of his displeasure against <HI>New-England,</HI> in a very remarkable man∣ner, by striking dead in a moment by a blow of Thunder, three persons in the Town of <HI>Marshfield</HI> in the Jurisdiction of <HI>New∣Plimouth,</HI> in the moneth of <HI>June, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HI> one named <HI>William Shirtliff,</HI> and a Woman and a Youth; which sad Dispensation of Gods hand, being considered with some Circumstances, gave cause to the beholders to be much astonished: the said <HI>Shirtliff</HI> having his Wife by the hand, and sitting by her to chear her, in respect that the said storm was so fierce, he was slain, and she preserved, though in some measure scorched with the Lightning; yea, he had one of his Children in his arms, and himself slain, and the Childe preserved. We have likewise received intelligence of four more that about that time were slain by Thunder and Lightning about <HI>Pascataqua,</HI> and divers more hurt. At the time of this storm of Thunder and Light∣ning, in the which those of <HI>Marshfield</HI> died, there arose like∣wise a very great Whirlwind, that where it came it tore up Trees by the Roots, though through mercy it did little other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urt.</P>
<P>It was a great while, and many years spent since the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="000144_0189_0FA2B2AE31FF9B38"/>
came into these parts, before any very considerable hurt was done by Thunder and Lightning to either man, or beast ap∣pertaining to them, although sometimes very fierce storms of that kinde, as frequently as in these times: but now how doth the Lord go on gradually in this, as in other Judgements here in <HI>New England?</HI> first by striking Cattel, and then one person at a time, and this year divers, to the number of seven, be∣sides some Cattel also.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>God thundereth marvellously with his voice, he worketh <NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 37. 5. &amp; 38. 35. &amp; 40. 8.</NOTE> great things which we know not:</HI> He <HI>can send the Lightnings that they may walk, and say, Lo here we are. Hath any an arm like God? or can any thunder with a voice like him?</HI> By this his ter∣rible Voice <HI>he breaketh the Cedars, and divideth the flames of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 29 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE> fire;</HI> which he commissionates to do his pleasure, sometimes not onely striking Cedars, but great Oaks in a wonderful man∣ner, sometimes Beasts, sometimes Men and Women. If <HI>Gods Judgements have</HI> thus <HI>been abroad in the Earth, how ought the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Isalah 26. 9.</NOTE> Inhabitants</HI> (of <HI>New-England) to learn righteousness?</HI> How easily can the Lord <HI>stain the pride of our glory</HI> with a stroke of his hand? Let not the familiarness or frequency of such Pro∣vidences, cause them to be neglected by us, to improve them as God would have us, <HI>to fear before him,</HI> and to turn from such <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles.8 13</NOTE> iniquities especially as are most displeasing unto him, and to hold our lives in our hands, and to be in a readiness for his pleasure, lest <HI>knowing not our time, as the fishes that are taken <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles.9. 12.</NOTE> in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare,</HI> so we shall be snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon us.</P>
<P>This year the Lord threatned the Country with that infe∣ctious and contagious Disease of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> which began at <HI>Boston,</HI> whereof some few died: but through his great mercy it is stayed, and none of late have died thereof.</P>
<P>This year the Lord likewise threatned, and in some measure executed his displeasure upon the Country by Drought; but through his mercy hath of late sent plenty of Rain, for the recovering of the fruits of the earth. Although it is to be
<PB N="180" REF="000144_0190_0FA2B2AE9EDCC5A8"/>
observed, That soon after a day of Humiliation was observed by some Congregations, for the blessing of Rain in the Drought above-mentioned, that sad stroke by the Thunder and Lightning at <HI>Marshfield</HI> fell out: so that we may say with the Psalmist unto the Lord, <HI>By terrible things in Righteousness thou hast answered us, O God of our Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Also this year there hath been some ground of fear of In∣vasion by Forreign Enemies; but hitherto the Lord hath kept us.</P>
<P>This year much of the Wheat is destroyed with Blasting and Mildew, as also some other Grain by Worms, and the Drought aforementioned; but the Lord hath sent much Rain for the recovery of the remainder, through his great mercy.</P>
<P>This year, about the middle of <HI>July,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Prince</HI> Governour of the Jurisdiction of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> Captain <HI>Thomas Southworth,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Eliot</HI> senior, Mr. <HI>John Eliot</HI> junior, Mr. <HI>Samuel Arnold,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Holmes,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Brinsmead,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Cushman,</HI> gave meeting to Mr. <HI>Richard Bourn</HI> of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> in reference to the taking notice of what proficiency <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A special Ma∣nifestation of Gods goodness towards some poor Salvages in the Jurisdi∣ction of</HI> New∣Plimouth.</NOTE>the <HI>Indians</HI> under the Instruction of the said Mr. <HI>Bourn</HI> have attained unto, in the knowledge of God in Christ, and their interest in him by Faith; and to make such Professions or Confessions as they should openly make thereof, to the glory of God, and the satisfaction of the Saints, in order unto their joyning into Church-fellowship.</P>
<P>And the Lord was pleased to come in unto some of them, so as they gave good satisfaction unto the said honoured and ju∣dicious persons forenamed, then assembled in reference to the premises: So that it was concluded by them, That what had passed from the <HI>Indians</HI> in that behalf, should be drawn up in writing, and Copies thereof exhibited to the Churches of the Jurisdiction of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> such of them as are neighbouring near unto them; and if nothing should be then objected, that then in due and convenient time they should be permitted and encouraged to enter into Church-fellowship as aforesaid.</P>
<P>Now although I doubt not but the Passages of these things
<PB N="181" REF="000144_0191_0FA2B2B0C52BA778"/>
will be in due time published by a better Pen, yet I have made bold here to insert so much as I have been informed of them, in regard that they are the first-fruits of the Jurisdiction of <HI>New-Plimonth,</HI> that have come on to so good perfection in this kinde.</P>
<P>This year, in the moneth of <HI>December,</HI> it pleased God to take unto himself by death that worthy Servant of Christ Mr. <HI>William Thompson,</HI> who was a lively dispenser of the Word of God, and very affectionate in the delivery thereof. It pleased God to bless his Labours to the Conversion of many Souls. He was sometimes, together with Mr. <HI>Knowles,</HI> sent unto <HI>Vir∣ginia</HI> by the Elders of the Churches of the <HI>Massachusets,</HI> being requested by a Message sent by some of <HI>Virginia</HI> for some help in Preaching Gods Word amongst them: The fruit and benefit of whose Labours therein, still remaineth upon the Souls of some eminent in this Land. He was Elected and Ordained to be Pastor of the Church of Christ at <HI>Braintry</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI> in which Office he served Christ many years, untill old Age coming upon him, and the prevailing of his <HI>Melancholly dis∣temper,</HI> did in a manner wholly disable him from that Service; and Satan taking advantage thereby, he was under sad deser∣tions and trouble of Spirit: At which time the Reverend El∣ders, and others of the aforesaid Jurisdiction of the <HI>Massa∣chusets,</HI> were very officious for his Recovery, and in sense of his sad condition offered up many Prayers to God for him, and in Gods good time they received a gracious answer; so as in his weakness and sickness it pleased God to come in unto his Soul, and to remove the Cloud of darkness that was upon his Spirit, so that with much peace and comfort he fell asleep in the Lord, and his Body was honourably buried at <HI>Braintry. Mark the upright man, and behold the just; for the end of that man is peace.</HI></P>

Capt. <HI>Thomas Soutbworth,,</HI>


Capt. <HI>William Bradford,</HI>


Mr. <HI>Thomas Hinkley,</HI>

Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Bacon,</HI>
Chosen Assistants to him in Government.

</P>
<P>This year on the last day of <HI>November,</HI> being the last day of the next week, there was heard several loud Noises or Re∣ports, as if it had been Guns discharged in the Air, first one distinctly, and in a short time as it had been a Volley of Shot discharged: It was especially heard and observed at <HI>Nantasket,</HI> and related by sundry of them of good Credit.</P>
<P>In the Spring following, in the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> there appeared a Sign in the Heavens in the form of a Spear, some∣thing thicker in the middest then at either end, of a whitish bright colour; it was seen several nights together in the West, about an hour within the night: it stood stooping, and the one end pointing to the setting of the Sun, and so setled downward by little and little, untill it quite vanished, and descended beneath our Horizon. God awaken us, that we be not heedless spectators of his wonderful Works.</P>
<P>This year, on the seventh of <HI>August,</HI> it pleased the Lord to call home to himself the Reverend, Ancient, and godly Pastor of the Church of <HI>Boston,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Wilson:</HI> He was a truely Reverend and holy Man of God; he came to <HI>New-England</HI> in the year 1630. He was instrumental in the first beginnings of the Church of <HI>Boston,</HI> having been the Pastor of it three years
<PB N="183" REF="000144_0193_0FA2B2B62275F1F8"/>
before Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> Twenty years with him, Ten years with Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> and Four years after him; Thirty seven in all. And in all the Changes of Times that passed over him, he was full of Faith and Prayer, and
eminent for Sincerity and Humility, (being ever low in his own eyes;) and for the grace of Love, he had <HI>largeness of heart as the sand of the Sea,</HI> to do good to all. He was very charitable, where there was any signs and hopes of good; and yet withall very zealous against known and manifest evils. He was Orthodox in his Judgement, and very holy in his Conversation: Very few that ever went out of the world, so generally beloved and reverenced as this good man. He was <HI>a good man</HI> indeed, <HI>and full of the holy Ghost;</HI> He lived to <HI>a good old age, and was full of dayes,</HI> and full of honour, being in the Seventy ninth year of his Age, when the Lord took him to himself. He was Interred with much Honour and Lamentation.</P>
<P>In the time of his languishing sickness he was visited by the Elders round about, especially on the Sixteenth of <HI>May,</HI> the day after the Court of Election, when there being a general meeting of all the Elders of the Churches at his house, they requested Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> (because they knew not whether ever they should have the like opportunity to hear him speak again, and having been from the first a Pillar amongst them, and of much Experience in his observation of the state of things) That he would solemnly declare to them, what he conceived to be those sins amongst us, which provoked the displeasure of God a∣gainst the Country. He then told them, <HI>That he had divers times, and long feared these sins following, as chief among others, which God was greatly provoked with;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Separation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Anabaptism.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Corahism.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This latter he did explain thus; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>when people rise up, as</HI> Corah, <HI>against their Ministers or Elders, as if they took too much upon them, when indeed they do but Rule for Christ, and according to Christ; yet</HI> (faith he) <HI>it is nothing for a Brother
<PB N="184" REF="000144_0194_0FA2B2B7F20D3B80"/>
to stand up, and oppose without Scripture or Reason, the Doctrine and word of the Elder, saying,</HI> [I am not satisfied] &amp; <HI>c.</HI><HI>And hence, if he do not like the Administration, (be it Baptism, or the like) he will then turn his back upon God and his Ordinances, and go away,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And</HI> (saith he) <HI>for our neglect of baptizing the Children of the Church, those that some call</HI> Grandchildren. <HI>I think God is provoked by it.</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>Another sin I take to be, The making light of, and not subjecting to the Authority of</HI> Synods, <HI>without which the Chur∣ches cannot long subsist. And so for the Magistrates being</HI> Gallio-<HI>like, either not caring for these things, or else not using their Power and Authority for the maintenance of the Truth, and Gospel, and Ordinances of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and for the bearing thorough witness against the contrary: Should the Lord leave</HI> THEM <HI>hereunto, how miserable a people should we be!</HI></P>
<P>At night the Assembly being dismissed with Prayer, Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> did (being desired by them so to do) in a solemn man∣ner bless the Elders, making a short Prayer, saying, <HI>I am not like long to be with you; the Lord pardon us, and heal us, and make us more Heavenly, and take us off from the world, and make us burning and shining Lights, by our heavenly Doctrine and Example. And I beseech the Lord with all my heart to bless you, and to bless his Churches, and to bless all his People, and to bless all your Families, and to bless your Wives, and to bless all your Children, and your Childrens Children; and make us all more and more meet for our Inheritance, and bring us all to it in his good time,</HI> &amp;c.These words, with some few other, he spake with great affection, and with tears: and all the Ministers wept with him, and they took their leave of him, even as Chil∣dren of their Father, who having blessed them was about to die.</P>

<HEAD>1668.</HEAD>
<P>THis Year it pleased God to visit <HI>New-England</HI> with the ma∣nifestation of his displeasure, by the death of three Emi∣nent Instruments: The first whereof was that worthy Servant of Christ Mr. <HI>Samuel Shepard,</HI> Pastor of the Church of Christ at <HI>Rowley</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> who deceased in the Spring of this year, in the midst of his dayes, and in the beginning of his Work in the Ministry. The second, that worthy Man of God Mr. <HI>Henry Flint,</HI> Teacher of the Church of Christ at <HI>Braintry</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> who ended his mortal life the 27 of <HI>April</HI> in this year; a man of known Piety, Gravity, and Integrity, and well accomplished with other Qualifications fit for the Work of the Ministry. The third and last, but not the least, that Super∣eminent Minister of the Gospel (rightly so called) Mr. <HI>Jona∣than Mitchel,</HI> Pastor of the Church of Christ at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> who laid down his Earthly Tabernacle on the Ninth of <HI>July</HI> in this year: Of whose rare Endowments, and the great Loss the whole Land sustained by his death, take this following brief Account.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jonathan Mitchell</HI> was born at <HI>Halifax</HI> in <HI>York-shire in England,</HI> of pious and wealthy Parents, who coming over
<PB N="191" REF="000144_0201_0FA2B2C5B888BB88"/>
to <HI>New-England,</HI> brought him over young; his Education in Learning was perfected at <HI>Hanvard</HI> Colledge in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> where he attained to such a degree in knowledge, that he was soon called to be a Fellow of the Colledge, and within few years after his lustre did so shine, that the Church at <HI>Hartford</HI> upon <HI>Conecticot</HI> River made application to him in order to sup∣ply the place of that Eminent Servant of Christ Mr. <HI>Thomas Flooker,</HI> a little before deceased; but the Church at <HI>Cambridge</HI> (by the Advice of their Pastor Mr. <HI>Thomas Shepard,</HI> then living) not willing to part with so great a Treasure, became Compe∣titor with <HI>Hartford,</HI> and gave him a Call to them. This loving Strife between the two Churches of <HI>Hartford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> about him, was in a short time decided by the awfull hand of God, in the death of that Eminent and Glorious Star, Mr. <HI>Tho∣mas Shepard,</HI> Pastor at <HI>Cambridge;</HI> which place being wholly destitute, and <HI>Hartford</HI> being supplied with a Teacher, namely, that Worthy of the Lord, Mr. <HI>Samuel Stone,</HI> the Ballance was cast for <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and in the year 1650 he was Called and Ordained their Pastor. It was an eminent favour of God to that Church, to have their great Breach thus made up, with a man so much of the Spirit and Principles of their former Pa∣stor, and so excellently qualified with respect to the Colledge: for, Reason and Prudence requireth, that the Minister of that place be more then ordinarily endowed with Learning, Gra∣vity, Wisdome, Orthodoxness, Ability, sweet and excellent Gifts in Preaching, that so the Scholars which are devoted and set apart in order to be Preachers of the Gospel, might be sea∣soned with the Spirit of such an <HI>Elijah:</HI> In which regard, this holy Man of God was eminently furnished, and his Labours wonderfully blessed; for very many of the Scholars bred up in his time (as is observed) do favour of his Spirit, for grace and manner of Preaching, which was most attractive. He lived Pastor of the Church about Eighteen years, and was most in∣tense and faithful in declaring much of the Counsel of God. He went through a great part of the Body of Divinity; made a very excellent <HI>Exposition</HI> of the Book of <HI>Genesis,</HI> and part of
<PB N="192" REF="000144_0202_0FA2B2C9716A1DB0"/>
<HI>Exodus;</HI> and delivered many fruitful and prositable Sermons on the four first Chapters of <HI>John;</HI> and in his <HI>Moncthly Le∣ctures,</HI> which were abundantly frequented, he Preached <HI>of Mans Misery by Sin,</HI> and <HI>Recovery by Christ Jesus;</HI> and died in the third part of it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> concerning <HI>Mans Obedience<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christ:</HI> besides many other excellent Truths by him taught upon divers occasions. In all his Labours God was wonder∣fully present with him. He was a person that held very near Communion with God; Eminent in Wisdome, Piety, Humility, Love, Self-denial, and of a compassionate and tender heart; surpassing in Publick-spiritedness; a mighty man in Prayer, and Eminent at standing in the Gap; he was zealous for Or∣der, and faithful in asserting the Truth against all Oppugners of it. In a word, he was a man whom God had richly fur∣nished, and eminently fitted for his Work; lived desired, and died lamented by all good Christians that knew him. It pleased God upon the Ninth of <HI>July,</HI> 1668. in a hot and burning sea∣son, (but much more hot in the Heat of Gods Anger to <HI>New∣England</HI>) to take him to Rest and Glory, about the 43 year of his Age. His Race was but short, but the Work he did was very much. The <HI>Elegies</HI> following may give the Reader a further account of what esteem he was.</P>

<HI>Nature, Learning,</HI> and <HI>Grace;</HI> of comely Proportion, ruddy Complexion, chearful Countenance; of quick Apprehension, solid Judgement, excellent Prudence; Learned both in <HI>Tongues</HI> and <HI>Arts</HI> for one of his time, and studiously intense in acquiring more knowledge. His Abilities and Acceptation in the Mini∣stry did excell; His Piety, Faith, Love, Humility, Self deniall, and Zeal, did eminently shine upon all occasions. He had (un∣der the conduct of his Father) by his diligence, industry, and zeal (for the good of Souls) attained to such skill in the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, that he Preached to the <HI>Indians</HI> sundry years; Travelling many miles in a day once a Fortnight to dispense the Gospel to them. The <HI>Indians</HI> have often said, that <HI>his Preach∣ing to them was precious and desireable;</HI> and consequently their loss, and the obstruction in that Work, much to be lamented. In a word, there was so much of God in him, that all the wise and godly who knew him, loved and honoured him in the Lord, and bewailed his death; which sell upon the 13 day of <HI>October</HI> 1668. and of his Age about 35 years.</P>
<P>I <HI>Shall close up this small</HI> History <HI>with a word of Advice to the</HI> Rising generation, <HI>That as now their godly Prede∣cissors have had large Experience of the goodness and faith∣fulness of God, for the space of near Fourty six years (some of them) and have passed under various Dispensations, sometimes under great</HI> Afflictions, <HI>other-while</HI> the Sun shining upon their Tabernacles <HI>in wayes of</HI> peace <HI>and</HI> prosperity, <HI>and yet notwithstanding, through the grace of Christ, the most of them have held their integrity in his Wayes: That so, such as succeed them would follow their Examples, so farre as they have followed Christ; that it might not be said of them, as it is to be feared it may be, by what yet appears amongst many of them, That indeed</HI> God did once plant a Noble vine in <HI>New-England,</HI> but it is degenerated into the plant of a strange vine. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jerem.2 21.</NOTE> <HI>It were well
<PB N="198" REF="000144_0208_0FA2B2CEDCF1BAA0"/>
that it might be said, that the</HI> Rising-generation did serve <NOTE PLACE="marg">Josh. 24. 31.</NOTE> the Lord all the dayes of <HI>such as in this our</HI> Israel <HI>are as</HI> Joshua's <HI>amongst us,</HI> and the Elders that over lived him, which have known all the works of the Lord which he hath done for their Fathers. <HI>But if yet notwithstanding afterwards such shall forget, and not regard those his</HI> great Works <HI>here presented before them (besides many more that I hope by some others may come to their view) be they assured,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 28.5.</NOTE> He will destroy them, and not build them up. <HI>Oh there∣fore, let the truely godly in this Land be incited by the ex∣ample of</HI> Moles, <HI>as the mouth of the Church, to pray earnest∣ly and incessantly unto the Lord,</HI> That his work may yet <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 90.16. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 44.304.</NOTE> appear to his servants, and his glory unto their children; <HI>and,</HI> that he would pour out his Spirit upon <HI>his Church and</HI> people <HI>in New-England,</HI> and his blessing upon their offspring, that they may spring up as among the grass, and as the willows by the water-courses; <HI>That so great occasion there may be thereby of taking notice thereof in suc∣ceeding generations, to the praise and glory of GOD.</HI> So be it.</P>
