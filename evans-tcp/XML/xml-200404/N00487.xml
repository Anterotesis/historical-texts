<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends &amp; Brethren every where, to whom this may come;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE dearly Salute you in the Love of God: The occasion of this present Writing is in Vindication of the Truth and Us, the detamed Witnesses of it, and particularly of <HI>George Keith,</HI> from the false Judgment, Calumnies, false Infor∣mation and Defamations of <HI>S Jennings, John Simcock</HI> and <HI>Thomas Lloyd,</HI> pretended preachers, and others joyned with them, being in Number twenty eight, in their late Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle sent to the Monethly and Quarterly Meetings in <HI>Pennsilvania, East</HI> and <HI>West Jarsey.</HI></P>
<P>First of all, whereas they pretend to give an Account to these Meetings of the <HI>Tedious Exercise and Vexations Perplexity they have met with in their late Friend</HI> George Keith, <HI>for several Months past.</HI> In this they have dealt most unfairly, and unjustly with him, in that they have given no account of the Occasion of that called by them the <HI>Tedious Exercise &amp; Vexations Perplexity, &amp;c.</HI> which because they have not given, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fit to do the Truth and all Friends of it, to whose hands this may come, that Justice, as to give you a true In∣formation of the Cause and Occasion of the late Difference that hath happened betwixt divers of them, that hath signed their Epistle and these the chiefest among them, and <HI>G.K.</HI> which was this, <HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HI> About fifteen Moneths ago, <HI>William Stock tale,</HI> an Antient Preacher, having accused <HI>G.K.</HI> of preaching <HI>Two Christs,</HI> because he preach∣ed Faith in Christ within, and Faith in Christ without; the which <HI>G.K.</HI> hearing, after he had privately dealt with him, laid his Com∣plaint first before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> twelve of the Friends of the Ministry, met at the House of <HI>Robert E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> who having done nothing in the said Meeting to being <HI>W.Stockdale</HI> to due Conviction or Condemnation for his said Error, but rather for the most part did excuse and defend him, as can well be proved by divers Credible Witnesses then pre∣sent,

only two of the said Friends of the Ministry then present, <HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> John Hars</HI> and <HI>John D lava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> dissented from the rest; then <HI>G.K.</HI> did again lay his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before Friends of the Ministry at the last Yearly Meeting in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in the first week of 7 Mon. 1691. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and judgment, <HI>Whether he was guilty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> preac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Two C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ists? or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> W.

Meeting gave but a very slender and partial determination and judge∣ment concerning it; which yet, such as it was, was not intimated by any Order of the Meeting, as themselves have acknowledged. And indeed such was the Partiality, as well as the Ignorance and gross Un∣belief that openly and manifestly appeared in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Meetings, whereof sufficient Proof can be given, and that of divers owned and esteemed great Preachers among us, that is scarcely credible, a hint whereof we think necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to give for your true Information. In one of these six Meetings <HI>T. Fitzwater,</HI> in Prayer, said, <HI>O God, that dyed in us, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy Life in us, and took it up again, &amp;c.</HI> After he had ended his Prayer. <HI>G.

Also, <HI>Arthur Cook,</HI> in one of these Meetings ac∣cused <HI>G.K.</HI> for saying, at the Meeting at <HI>R. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer's</HI> house, <HI>That Christs Body that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and buried, is gone into Heaven, and was and is in Heaven, even the very same Body;</HI> which <HI>G.K.</HI> most freely acknowledg∣ed he had so affirmed, and <HI>that Christs Body was not changed in Being or Substance of Body, but in Manner and Condition.</HI> And whereas at one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meetings <HI>G.K.</HI> had complained against <HI>J. Sinaock,</HI> that he had questioned <HI>G.K.</HI> at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meeting at <HI>R. Ewer's,</HI> saying, <HI>Dia Christs Bones rise?</HI> which <HI>G.K.</HI> affirmed, and proved from Scripture; but the said <HI>J.S.</HI> boldly deny'd that he asked any such Question, until <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Bradford</HI> affirmed they heard him question it. And not only <HI>John Sinaock</HI> and <HI>Arthur Cock,</HI> and others did openly blame <HI>G.K.</HI> both at the Meeting at <HI>K.Ewer's,</HI> land at other Meetings at the Yearly Meeting, <HI>for imposing a Novelty upon his Aniunt Brethren,</HI> but more especially and principally <HI>Thomas Lloyd,</HI> who was the great At∣torney for <HI>W.

<HI>G.K.</HI> in his Testimony to these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fundamental Principles and Doctrines of the <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> object against G.K'<HI>s Imposing an Unscriptural Faith on his Brethren,</HI> all which is so openly known to many, that we judge, they scarce have the Confidence themselves to deny it; but what was this Unscriptural Faith that they did blame <HI>G.K.</HI> for imposing on he Antient Brethren? even no other but this, <HI>That we ought to believe in Christ without us in Heaven, as well as in Christ within for Salvation;</HI> and <HI>That Christ is in Heaven, having the true Na∣ture of Man, both O, Soul and Body, the same he had on Earth for Being, but wonderfully and must gloriously changed in Condition and Manner, and is not only God in Heaven, but both God and Man, and yet one Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ;</HI> and many are Witnesses, how at the School-house Meeting, as well as at these other Meetings aforesaid, <HI>T.

Offence for G.K. to say, <HI>be trampled their Judgment as Dirt under his feet;</HI> for Dirt is good for something to fatten the Land, but false Judg∣ment is good for nothing, except to discover what ignora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and pre∣judiced men these are against the Trut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

both very ignorant men, so they are not of a very good Fame among their Neighbours, and for that distaste, some stay from Meetings, as we are informed. And one <HI>George Gray</HI> from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> almost wholly a stranger to these matters of difference, taking all on trust from them, except what hath lately happened in some late Meetings, hath showed himself too foolish and rash, as well as ignorant; and the like may be said of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> wholly a stranger to any Differences, but what he had by report, and who lately before divers Witnesses at the house of <HI>W.

<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> As concerning their blaming G.K. for objecting against their <HI>Discipline, and his preparing a Draught, Which he presented them,</HI> G.K. gave no just Cause to be offended at this; hundreds here away of the more sincere sort of Friends, do object, as well as G.K. against the too great laxness of Discipline amongst us, and that there is but little in∣spection into the good Lives and Manners of them that profess Truth among us, far less into their Faith, so that men may almost believe any thing, and yet be owned, if they come to Meetings, and use plain Lan∣guage and plain Habit, and be not grosly scandalous. And as to his Draught that he prepared and presented to the Yearly Meeting, 1690, he was very moderate in it, and did not press it on them; and he is so far from being ashamed of it, that he has now sent it to Friends in <HI>Old England,</HI> to consider of.</P>
<P>5<HI>thly,</HI> Their blaming G.K. for his earnest <HI>desiring that they and we might agree to draw up some Principles and Doctrines of Faith in the most necessary things, to qualifie our Church Members, and distinguish Believers from Unbelievers,</HI> has no just ground, but is rather worthy of Commen∣dation; for hundreds see the necessity of such a thing among us, especially here-away. And for his saying, <HI>That he knew none given forth by the Body of Friends,</HI> it is true he hath so said, and if they know any in the Confession or Declaration of Faith in all necessary things, and sufficient to end the present Differences, let them produce i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; we know that particular accounts of Principles and Doctrines have been given forth by divers particular Friends, as <HI>G.F G.W.

Lloyd</HI> blamed G.K. for <HI>imposing unscriptural words on them,</HI> G.K. pressed him again and again to show in any one particular, but he would not give one instance; then G.K. desired him to answer one Question, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Whether to believe that Christ dyed for our sins, and rose again, was necessary to our Salvation?</HI> but <HI>T.L.</HI> waved it, saying, <HI>I will prove out of thy Books, thou vast not of that Faith sometime ago,</HI> which G.K denyed, well knowing what is in his own Books. And it may be noted, that <HI>T. Lloyd, S.Jinings, J.Delavall &amp; S. Richardson,</HI> came to the said Meeting to countenance the reading of their Papaer of false Judgment against G.K. and his Friends, having put it into the hands of <HI>W.Prestan</HI> to read, who offering to read it, declaring, <HI>That nothing ought to be read in their meeting without the general consent of the Meeting;</HI> but this un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uly and disorderly man, (who hath otherwise showed his Prejudice against <HI>G.K.</HI> &amp; particularly that when G.K. was declaring at another Meeting, <HI>W.P.</HI> interrupted him and called him Lyar, when yet it was proved that he was the Lyar himself at that very time) did presume to read the Paper

Thus these who by their Place should be good Examples of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and good Order, are Transgressors of it.</P>
<P>6<HI>thly,</HI> For their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>refer the Differences in matter of Doctrine either to the Yearly Meeting here, or to the Yearly Meeting at</HI> London, <HI>by their drawing up a Confession, and transmitting it to them,</HI> which they blame G.K. for refusing; G.K. faith, that he told them he had good cause to refuse referring it to the Yearly Meeting here, there being a Faction that pre∣vailed in the last Yearly Meeting to hinder Justice to be done to the truth, but he did not refuse to refer the Difference to Friends in <HI>England,</HI> as ha∣ving any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they would concern his Doctrine, but it he had pro∣mised any such Reference or submission as was required, it would have been called a breach of his Promise, if he had preached any of these Do∣ctrines disputed betwixt them and him, and if God had moved him to preach them, he should either have disobeyed that Motion, or seemed to break his Promise; and therefore he refused to come under any such eye, especially seeing it could not be expected that an Answer could come from <HI>England</HI> in less than a years space; And by a marveolus Providence of God, within a few dayes after this debate, Friends Letters came to us confirming <HI>G.K's</HI> Doctrine in every Particular then in Difference be∣twixt him and them, and since that they cry out, <HI>Who denyes these things?</HI> when it is well known, and can well be proved, many did deny them.

By <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stripes we are healed,</HI> not of Christs Stripes that he suffer∣ed without us, but of the stripes that he given us in our hearts; and when <HI>T.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> prayed in a pub Meeting, <HI>Lord Jesus, who art still cru∣cisied without the Gates of Jerusalem;</HI> and at another Meeting, told, <HI>That was crucisied Christ without the Gate, when their Minds went from the Light in them;</HI> and according to this perverse Exposition, when the Scriptute faith, <HI>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the Camp, Heb.</HI> 13. 13 the sence would be, <HI>Let us go forth from the Light in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> which to be sure is very false and absurd Doctrine.

And yet after all this for them to abuse Friends, by writing to them such a gross Falshood, <HI>That they had tenderly and orderly deals with G.K.</HI> is Abominable Hypocrisie.</P>

<P>9<HI>thly,</HI> Whereas they say, <HI>They would have</HI> G.K. <HI>cease to offer his Bise among them:</HI> What great Non-sence, Confusion and Contradiction is this in them, to suppose that <HI>G.K.</HI> hath a Gift to offer, after they have ren∣dered him as had as the worst of men possibly can almost be, as <HI>fallen us the searing Mountains, slain in his high Places, gone into a Spirit of En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mity, Wrath, Self-Exal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp;c and as Person without the Fear of God before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Eyes, in his Anger and Envy being Cruel against them,</HI> with much more.

<HEAD>Some brief Observations on their seeming condomnation of William Stockdale which is rather, as to the main, a clearing of him, and condemning him only as to some Circumstance, and more severely and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and most falsly condemning G.K.</HEAD>
<P><HI>First.</HI> WHereas they say, <HI>They being prevented in their Meetings of late to proceed orderly in business, by reason of a Turbulent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unsubdued Spirit</HI> (meaning without all doubt in G.K.) <HI>but having respite at this time, have considered, &amp;c.</HI> This is great Hypocrisie and Deceit in them; why were they prevented in their Meetings of late? did G.K. by his Spirit lay violent hands either on their Tongues or Pens, that they might not have given true Judgment against <HI>W.S.</HI> in a case so plain, that a company of Children well instructed in the first Principles of <HI>Christia∣nity</HI> (the eldest of them not exceeding fifteen years) could have given a just decision in less than one quarter of an hour? But how could G.K's Spirit hinder them at the Yearly Meeting, when he went out at their desire tho' there was no cause for his so doing, more than for any of them, for it was not G.K. but Christ Jesus that was mainly concerned in this Affair, for whom, and for his Glory, if they had any zeal for him.) they ought to have been as much concerned as G.K. but it is fullfilled in them what is writ in Scripture of some, <HI>that loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</HI> But why did they take no time since the Yearly Meeting? Why did they not take a quiet time to do it in G.K.'s absence, when he was almost six Months absent in <HI>N. England,</HI> betwixt his first Complaint and that Meeting at <HI>Burlington</HI> last first Month, having gone twice into <HI>N. England,</HI> and was each time absent about three Months? And why did they nothing at the Meeting at <HI>Burlington</HI> against <HI>W.S.</HI> but heard false Accusation, without all Proof, against G.K? Why are they so partial and hypocritical to pretend they had not time till now the 41.4. mo.92 for about 15 Months past? Why did they nor call and appoint an extra∣ordinary Meeting of Friends, as they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> done upon a far less occasion, as when then presently called a Meeting at the house of <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>el Carpenter,</HI> to pass Judgment against the Publishing of the <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Sheet, called <HI>The Christian Faith,</HI> and against <HI>William Bradford</HI> fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so Print∣ing it, tho' he was warranted to print it be the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re of the Mo Meeting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> which hath as great Authority to print without them, as they here have to print without these, unless they here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say, that <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in <HI>America</HI> as <HI>Samuel Jenings</HI> caused

it the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> little considering that the Apostacy came in by such means.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whereas they say, <HI>The Friends then present concluded of a Judg∣ment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> matter, prevented of publishing the same by reason of</HI> George Keith <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Behaviour, and exticam Passion, which abruptly broke up the said Meeting.</HI> But this is another piece of their Hypoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, they should have said, if they would have said truly, what Judgment was given, ye were prevented of publishing of it by the unruly behaviour, and proud and insolent Carriage, as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as unjust proceedings of <HI>Sam.Jenings</HI> and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tbar C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok,</HI> who would not suffer the Judgment given to be published, after G.K. was ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d into the Meeting, until G.K. should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yed for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Brethren, which <HI>G.K.</HI> fervently and earnestly contradicted, crying out against their injustice, and Arbitrary Method, contrary to the way of worldly Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts, in the like case, though some time alter <HI>S.J.</HI> was pleased to say, <HI>That Courts allowed of Discount;</HI> So that according to <HI>J.</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>W.S.</HI> shall be discounted for, and set off, against <HI>G.K's</HI> reviling his Brethren, if he had been guilty thereof, which they can never prove. And whether <HI>A. Cook</HI> was not guilty of extream Passion, who did in a Quarterly Meeting, whereof many can bear witness, pronounce a Curse against G.K. saying, <HI>George, thou best made this B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ec, and Wo be to thee from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Lord,</HI> and yet none of that Party reproved him for so doing?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Wherereas they give their Judgment, <HI>That</HI> W.S. <HI>is reprove∣able and blame-worthy for uttering the said words (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR></HI> That G.K's preaching Christ within and Christ without, was preaching two Christs) <HI>they being an Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce in many sound and tender Friends, and that be condemn the same.</HI> It doth plainly appear, that their Judgment is but a ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shadow, or formality of Judgment, rather than any substantial, effectual, weighty and sollid Judgment against him, which if it had been, they would have aggravated it with other words and expression, and principally blamed him for his words of Unbelief and blasphemy against the son of Man, greatly offensive to God; but instead of that they say, <HI>They being Offensive to many sound and tender Friends:</HI> Why are they so severe to G.K. against whom they cannot justly charge any thing, either in Doctrine or Life, saying of him, <HI>He being a Man without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore his Eyes, &amp;c.</HI> Is it a greater Offence to them, that they are dishonoured, or that the worth Name of Christ is dishonoured, by an open de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yal of him, as <HI>W. Stockdale</HI> did, by saying, <HI>To preach Faith in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> within and Faith in Christ without, is to preach Two Christs;</HI> for at
<PB N="23" REF="000612_0023_0FA9ADD8F3E49F48"/>
this rate, Christ without is to him but a false Christ; and this to them is so small a fault, that to deny Christ without us, they will not say in their Judgment, <HI>it is an Offence to God,</HI> but they say, <HI>It is Offence to many sound and tender Friends;</HI> Oh! great Hypocri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and want of Zeal to the Glory of God and Christ, though they are full of Zeal to their own Honour, that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> stink, and do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> this their great Partiality and Injustice, as well as their great ignorance, Error and Unbelief?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> But why do not the words of their Judgment run thus, <HI>That</HI> W.S. <HI>did say, to preach Faith in Christ without, and in Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, was to preach two Christs, &amp;c</HI> but that they are guilty themselves of not ha∣ving this Faith; for not long ago, <HI>A Cook</HI> questioned G.K. at a Mens Meeting, which many can witness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of late, some of them say, they have a reverend esteem of Christ with∣out, of his Death, Sufferings, Resurrection and A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ention yet none of them preach it as a necessary matter of Salvation, to believe it, that ever we heard of, except <HI>John D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lavall,</HI> who hath of late changed his Faith, and got a say worse. And it cannot be supposed, that they hold Faith in Christ without them to be necessary to their Salvation seeing many of them that belong to the Monthly Meeting, have given their Judgment, <HI>That the Light is sufficient to Salvation without something <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> which is a plain excluding the Man Christ Jesus from having any part in our Salvation, and leaving him only the bare Name or Title of a Savi∣our; and if so, then they had as good have wholly cleared <HI>W.S.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> It is great Confusion and Contradiction in these of that side, to condemn <HI>W. Stockdale,</HI> if they wore in good earnest, and to clear <HI>Tho. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> for if the Man Christ Jesus be our real Saviour, and that his Death, Resurrection, Ascention and Mediation for us without us in Heaven, hath any part in our Salvation, them the Light doth not save us without some-what else; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d therefore <HI>T.F.</HI> is guilty of Condemnation: But if <HI>T.F.</HI> be cleared, then the Man Christ without us is no real Saviour at all, and ought not to be preached, nor Faith in him, but only the Light within, and <HI>W.S.</HI> at this rate is in the right of it, and they have done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to pass Judgment against him. I know no way to reconcile this, but to say, their Judgment against <HI>W.S.</HI> is a Mock-Judgment of show, without any Reality.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> They unjustly blame G.K. for not giving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gospel-Order, and take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> notice how W.S gave him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> at all, either of

<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> That hey blame him for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Will: Stockdale</HI> an <HI>Ignorant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he being,</HI> as they say, <HI>elder in the Truth, and in Tears.</HI> Then according to them, a man may be in the Truth, and a good Christian, and say, <HI>Christ without is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the true Christ.</HI>—but why is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> a bad Name? for if every honest <HI>Heathen</HI> be a true <HI>Chri∣stian,</HI> as he is, according to that Principle held by their Monthly Mee∣ting, <HI>That the Light is sufficient without the Man Christ, and without the Faith of his Death, Resurrection, Ascention and Mediation,</HI> which is that something else than honest <HI>Heathen</HI> is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Christian;</HI> and therefore by their own Principle, to be called a <HI>Heathen</HI> is no Reviling, and to be called <HI>Ignorant,</HI> is no Reviling, when a man is so; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also, <HI>T.
