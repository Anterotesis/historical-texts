AND WHEREAS in Pursuance of the Direction of former Acts of Assembly, by which the said Bills of Credit were emitted, a great Part of the same have been sunk and de∣stroyed, so that there is not current in the Province at this Time, more than the Value of 68,889 <HI>l.</HI> 15 <HI>s.</HI> in the said Bills of Credit, which, since the great Increase of the Inha∣bitants as well as the Trade of the Province, is found to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll short of a proper Medium for negotiating our Com∣merce and supporting the Government. AND WHERE∣AS it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppears, that great Quantities of counterfeit Bills in the Likeness and Imitation of genuine Bills of Credit of this Province, have been imported among us; which has rendred it necessary to call in all our Bills of Credit, and to emit others of the same Value, but of a different Impression from the former.</P>

<PB N="iv" REF="005033_0592_0000000000000000"/>
ever skilful, can form a right Judgment of the Validity of the Title to those Lands, without being first well informed how the Law stood at the Time when the several Deeds, of which such Title is composed, were executed: Hence the Necessity and Useful∣ness of preserving those Laws which have been made for regulating Descents and trans∣fering the Property of Lands must be evident.</P>
<P>As to the ensuing Collection, the Reader may be assured it has been made with much Care and Difficulty; and it is hoped no such Mistakes will be form'd as to frustrate the good Purposes for which it is design'd.</P>

<P><HI>And Whereas</HI> by a late Law of this Province, passed in Year 1700, and confirmed in the Year 1701, it was (among other Things) enacted, That any Person's Lands in this Province should be re-surveyed; and if upon such Re-sur∣vey (after Allowance of four Acres in the Hundred, over or under, for Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erence of Surveys, and <HI>Six per Cent.</HI> for Roads) an Overplus should be found, the Possessors thereof should have the Refusal of it from the Proprietary, at rea∣sonable Rates; and in case of Disagreement about such Rate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Proprietary was to choose two Men, and the Possessor two more, who should either fix a Price on the said overplus Land, or appoint where it should be taken off for the Proprietary in one entire Piece at an Outside, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving to the Purchaser or Renter his Improvements and best Conveniencies) any three of whom agreeing should be

conclusive; and the Charges of Resurveying should be bore by the Purchaser or Renter of the main Tract, if he bought the Overplus, or if not, then by the Proprietary; and that Deficiencies should be made good by the Proprietary, ac∣cording as he received for Overplus-Land as aforesaid.</P>
<P>In Pursuance of which Act, Resurveys have been made of divers Lands, wherein Overmeasure was found; but the Act expiring before the same could be cut off, or the Rates thereof settled as the said Law directed, the Proprietary is not satisfied for the Overmeasure, and the Owners of the Land want Confirmation of what is their just due; <HI>Be it therefore Enacted,</HI> That where any Overplus-Land has been found upon the said Surveys (after Allowances are made for Roads, and Difference of Surveys as aforesaid) the Pro∣prietary, his Heirs and Assigns, and his o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Commis∣sioners or Agents, shall give the Possessor or Owner of such Land, the Refusal thereof at reasonable Rates; and in case of Disagreement with the said Possessor about such Rates, then the Proprietary, his Heirs or Assigns, or his or their Commissioners or Agents, shall forthwith chuse two Men, and the said Possessor or Owner shall at the same time chuse two more, which Persons so chosen, or any three of them, shall within Thirty Days after such Choice, either fix a Price on the said Overplus-Land to be paid by the said Possessor or Owner, or within the same time appoint where it shall be taken off for the Proprietary, his Heirs or Assigns, in One entire and convenient Piece, at an End or Outside; saving to the said Possessor or Owner his Improvements and best Conveniencies.</P>
<P>But in case the said Persons so chosen, as aforesaid, shall refuse or neglect to fix a Price on the said Overplus, or to cut off the same within the time herein before limited, then the Party aggrieved may apply to the Justices at the Court of common Ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for the County where the Land lies, who are hereby impowered and required to grant their Order in that behalf, to five indifferent and disinterested Persons of the Neighbourhood, requiring them, or any three of them, to perform what the said four Persons had refused or neglected to do.</P>
<P><HI>And be it further Enacted,</HI> That where any Overplus shall be taken off as aforesaid, the Proprietary or his Commissio∣ners shall confirm the Residue to the Possessor or Owner thereof, his Heirs or Assigns, saving the Rights of all others; but if the Proprietary, or his Commissioners or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to appoint two Persons on

his behalf as aforesaid, or if after the said Overplus be taken off, shall refuse to confirm the Residue to the Posses∣sor or Owner thereof, his Heirs or Assigns, within six Months after such Overplus is taken off, as aforesaid, and Applica∣tion made for the same by such Owner or Possessor, then and in every such Case all such Possessors or Owners re∣spectively shall stand, and be seized or possessed of the whole Tract, as if no such Re-survey had been made.</P>
<P>But if any of the said Possessors or Owners of Lands so re-surveyed as aforesaid, shall refuse or neglect to chuse two Men in his behalf, then the Persons so as aforesaid to be chosen by the Proprietary or his Commissioners, shall within the time aforesaid appoint where the Overplus shall be taken off, saving the Owner's Improvements and best Conveniencies, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>And if the Owners of any such Lands as have been re∣surveyed as aforesaid, do not reside in this Province, and no Person in the actual Possession of those Lands, then and in every such Case the Proprietary or his Commissioners may appoint two Men of the next Neighbourhood to such Land, who are hereby impowered to appoint where the Overplus of such Lands shall be taken off as aforesaid, leaving to every such Owner the full Quantity belonging to him by Purchase and Location there, together with the Allowances for Roads and Difference of Surveys, and saving the Improvements and Conveniencies, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>And in all Cases where any such Overplus shall be cut, as aforesaid, in pursuance of this Act, the Proprietary or his Commissioners or Agents shall have full Liberty to dispose of, and grant such Overplus to any Person or Persons, that he or they shall think fit; any thing in this Act contained, or in any other Law, to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.</P>
<P>And if upon the said Resurveys any Tract hath been found deficient in the Number of Acres for which it was at first granted after Allowances made, as aforesaid, all such Deficiencies shall be made good by the Proprietary, his Heirs or Assigns, after the same Rate he or they shall receive for such Overplus-Land in that Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><HI>Provided always,</HI> That nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed to be taken off any Overplus-Land out of any Tract, the Possessor or Owner whereof has Right, by his Purchase, to take up more Land over and above the Quantity such Tract was laid out for.</P>
