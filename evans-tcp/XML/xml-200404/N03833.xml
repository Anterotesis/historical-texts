<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>DEUT. XXXII. 35.</BIBL>
<Q>—Their Foot shall slide in due Time.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N this Verse is threatned the Vengeance
of God on the wicked unbelieving Isra∣elites,
that were God's visible People,
and lived under Means of Grace; and
that, notwithstanding all God's won∣derful
Works that he had wrought towards that Peo∣ple,
yet remained, as is expressed, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. void of
Counsel, having no Understanding in them; and that,
under all the Cultivations of Heaven, brought forth
bitter and poisonous Fruit; as in the two Verses next
preceeding the Text.</P>
<P>The Expression that I have chosen for my Text,
<HI>Their Foot shall slide in due Time;</HI> seems to imply
the following Things, relating to the Punishment
and Destruction that these wicked Israelites were ex∣posed
to.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004713_0004_0000000000000000"/>
1. That they were <HI>always</HI> exposed to Destruction,
as one that stands or walks in slippery Places is al∣ways
exposed to fall. This is implied in the Man∣ner
of their Destruction's coming upon them, being
represented by their Foot's sliding. The same is
express'd, Psal. 73. 18. <HI>Surely thou didst set them in
slippery Places; thou castedst them down into Destruction.</HI></P>
<P>2. It implies that they were always exposed to
<HI>sudden</HI> unexpected Destruction. As he that walks
in slippery Places is every Moment liable to fall; he
can't foresee one Moment whether he shall stand or
fall the next; and when he does fall, he falls at once,
without Warning. Which is also expressed in that,
Psal. 73. 18, 19. <HI>Surely thou didst set them in slippery
Places; thou castedst them down into Destruction. How
are they brought into Desolation as in a Moment?</HI></P>
<P>3. Another Thing implied is that they are liable
to fall <HI>of themselves,</HI> without being thrown down by
the Hand of another. As he that stands or walks
on slippery Ground, needs nothing but his own
Weight to throw him down.</P>
<P>4. That the Reason why they are not fallen al∣ready,
and don't fall now, is only that God's appoint∣ed
Time is not come. For it is said, that when that
due Time, or appointed Time comes, <HI>their Foot
shall slide.</HI> Then they shall be left to fall as they are
inclined by their own Weight. God won't hold them
up in these slippery Places any longer, but will let
them go; and then, at that very Instant, they shall fall
into Destruction; as he that stands in such slippery
declining Ground on the Edge of a Pit that he can't
stand alone, when he is let go he immediately falls
and is lost.</P>
<P>The Observation from the Words that I would
now insist upon is this,
<Q><PB N="5" REF="004713_0005_0000000000000000"/>
There is nothing that keeps wicked Men, at any one
Moment, out of Hell, but the meer Pleasure of GOD.</Q></P>
<P>By the meer Pleasure of God, I mean his sovereign
Pleasure, his arbitrary Will, restrained by no Obli∣gation,
hinder'd by no manner of Difficulty, any more
than if nothing else but God's meer Will had in the
least Degree, or in any Respect whatsoever, any Hand
in the Preservation of wicked Men one Moment.</P>
<P>The Truth of this Observation may appear by the
following Considerations.</P>
<P>1. There is no Want of <HI>Power</HI> in God to cast
wicked Men into Hell at any Moment. Mens Hands
can't be strong when God rises up: The strongest
have no Power to resist him, nor can any deliver out
of his Hands.</P>
<P>He is not only able to cast wicked Men into Hell,
but he can most <HI>easily</HI> do it. Sometimes an earthly
Prince meets with a great deal of Difficulty to subdue
a Rebel, that has found Means to fortify himself, and
has made himself strong by the Numbers of his Fol∣lowers.
But it is not so with God. There is no For∣tress
that is any Defence from the Power of God.
Tho' Hand join in Hand, and vast Multitudes of
God's Enemies combine and associate themselves,
they are easily broken in Pieces: They are as great
Heaps of light Chaff before the Whirlwind; or large
Quantities of dry Stubble before devouring Flames.
We find it easy to tread on and crush a Worm that
we see crawling on the Earth; so 'tis easy for us to
cut or singe a slender Thread that any Thing hangs
by; thus easy is it for God when he pleases to cast his
Enemies down to Hell. What are we, that we
should think to stand before him, at whose Rebuke
<PB N="6" REF="004713_0006_0000000000000000"/>
the Earth trembles, and before whom the Rocks are
thrown down?</P>
<P>2. They <HI>deserve</HI> to be cast into Hell; so that
divine Justice never stands in the Way, it makes
no Objection against God's using his Power at any
Moment to destroy them. Yea, on the contrary,
Justice calls aloud for an infinite Punishment of their
Sins. Divine Justice says of the Tree that brings
forth such Grapes of Sodom, <HI>Cut it down, why cum∣breth
it the Ground,</HI> Luk. 13. 7. The Sword of
divine Justice is every Moment brandished over their
Heads, and 'its nothing but the Hand of arbitrary
Mercy, and God's meer Will, that holds it back.</P>
<P>3. They are <HI>already</HI> under a Sentence of Condem∣nation
to Hell. They don't only justly deserve to be
cast down thither; but the Sentence of the Law of
God, that eternal and immutable Rule of Righteous∣ness
that God has fixed between him and Mankind,
is gone out against them, and stands against them;
so that they are bound over already to Hell. Joh. 3. 18.
<HI>He that believeth not is condemned already.</HI> So that
every unconverted Man properly belongs to Hell;
that is his Place; from thence he is. Joh. 8. 23. <HI>Ye
are from beneath.</HI> And thither he is bound; 'tis the
Place that Justice, and God's Word, and the Sentence
of his unchangeable Law assigns to him.</P>
<P>4. They are now the Objects of that very <HI>same.</HI> An∣ger
&amp; Wrath of God that is expressed in the Torments
of Hell: and the Reason why they don't go down
to Hell at each Moment, is not because God, in whose
Power they are, is not then very angry with them;
as angry as he is with many of those miserable Crea∣tures
that he is now tormenting in Hell, and do there
feel and bear the fierceness of his Wrath. Yea God
is a great deal more angry with great Numbers that
<PB N="7" REF="004713_0007_0000000000000000"/>
are now on Earth, yea doubtless with many that are
now in this Congregation, that it may be are at Ease
and Quiet, than he is with many of those that are now
in the Flames of Hell.</P>
<P>So that it is not because God is unmindful of their
Wickedness, and don't resent it, that he don't let
loose his Hand and cut them off. God is not altoge∣ther
such an one as themselves, tho' they may imagine
him to be so. The Wrath of God burns against them,
their Damnation don't slumber, the Pit is prepared,
the Fire is made ready, the Furnace is now hot, ready
to receive them, the Flames do now rage and glow.
The glittering Sword is whet, and held over them, and
the Pit hath opened her Mouth under them.</P>
<P>5. The <HI>Devil</HI> stands ready to fall upon them and
seize them as his own, at what Moment God shall
permit him. They belong to him; he has their Souls
in his Possession, and under his Dominion. The Scrip∣ture
represents them as his <HI>Goods,</HI> Luk. 11. 21. The
Devils watch them; they are ever by them, at their
right Hand; they stand waiting for them, like greedy
hungry Lions that see their Prey, and expect to have
it, but are for the present kept back; if God should
withdraw his Hand, by which they are restrained, they
would in one Moment fly upon their poor Souls. The
old Serpent is gaping for them; Hell opens its Mouth
wide to receive them; and if God should permit it,
they would be hastily swallowed up and lost.</P>
<P>6. There are in the Souls of wicked Men those
hellish <HI>Principles</HI> reigning, that would presently kindle
and flame out into Hell Fire, if it were not for God's
Restraints. There is laid in the very Nature of carnal
Men a Foundation for the Torments of Hell: There
are those corrupt Principles, in reigning Power in them,
and in full Possession of them, that are Seeds of Hell
<PB N="8" REF="004713_0008_0000000000000000"/>
Fire. These Principles are active and powerful, and
exceeding violent in their Nature, and if it were not
for the restraining Hand of God upon them, they
would soon break out, they would flame out after the
same Manner as the same Corruptions, the same Enmity
does in the Hearts of damned Souls, and would beget
the same Torments in 'em as they do in them. The
Souls of the Wicked are in Scripture compared to the
troubled Sea, <HI>Isai.</HI> 57. 20. For the present God re∣strains
their Wickedness by his mighty Power, as he
does the raging Waves of the troubled Sea, saying,
<HI>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further;</HI> but if God
should withdraw that restraining Power, it would soon
carry all afore it. Sin is the Ruin and Misery of the
Soul; it is destructive in it's Nature; and if God
should leave it without Restraint, there would need no∣thing
else to make the Soul perfectly miserable. The
Corruption of the Heart of Man is a Thing that is im∣moderate
and boundless in its Fury; and while wick∣ed
Men live here, it is like Fire pent up by God's Re∣straints,
whenas if it were let loose it would set on Fire
the Course of Nature; and as the Heart is now a Sink
of Sin, so, if Sin was not restrain'd, it would imme∣diately
turn the Soul into a fiery Oven, or a Furnace
of Fire and Brimstone.</P>
<P>7. It is no Security to wicked Men for one Mo∣ment,
that there are no <HI>visible Means</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> at
Hand. 'Tis no Security to a natural Man, that he is
now in Health, and that he don't see which Way he
should now immediately go out of the World by any
Accident, and that there is no visible Danger in any
Respect in his Circumstances. The manifold and con∣tinual
Experience of the World in all Ages, shews that
this is no Evidence that a Man is not on the very
Brink of Eternity, and that the next Step won't be in∣to
<PB N="9" REF="004713_0009_0000000000000000"/>
another World. The unseen, unthought of Ways
and Means of Persons going suddenly out of the World
are innumerable and inconceivable. Unconverted Men
walk over the Pit of Hell on a rotten Covering, and
there are innumerable Places in this Covering so weak
that they won't bear their Weight, and these Places
are not seen. The Arrows of Death fly unseen at
Noon-Day; the sharpest Sight can't discern them.
God has so many different unsearchable Ways of tak∣ing
wicked Men out of the World and sending 'em to
Hell, that there is nothing to make it appear that God
had need to be at the Expence of a Miracle, or go out of
the ordinary Course of his Providence, to destroy any
wicked Man, at any Moment. All the Means that there
are of Sinners going out of the World, are so in God's
Hands, and so universally absolutely subject to his Power
and Determination, that it don't depend at all less on
the meer Will of God, whether Sinners shall at any
Moment go to Hell, than if Means were never made
use of, or at all concerned in the Case.</P>
<P>8. Natural Men's <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Care</HI> to preserve
their own <HI>Lives,</HI> or the Care of others to preserve
them, don't secure 'em a Moment. This divine Pro∣vidence
and universal Experience does also bear Testi∣mony
to. There is this clear Evidence that Men's
own Wisdom is no Security to them from Death;
That if it were otherwise we should see some Difference
between the wise and politick Men of the World, and
others, with Regard to their Liableness to early and
unexpected Death; but how is it in Fact? Eccles. 2. 16.
<HI>How dieth the wise Man? as the Fool.</HI></P>
<P>9. All wicked Men's <HI>Pains</HI> and <HI>Contrivance</HI> they
use to escape <HI>Hell,</HI> while they continue to reject Christ,
and so remain wicked Men, don't secure 'em from
Hell one Moment. Almost every natural Man that
<PB N="10" REF="004713_0010_0000000000000000"/>
hears of Hell, flatters himself that he shall escape it;
he depends upon himself for his own Security; he
flatters himself in what he has done, in what he is now
doing, or what he intends to do; every one lays out
Matters in his own Mind how he shall avoid Damna∣tion,
and flatters himself that he contrives well for
himself, and that his Schemes won't fail. They hear
indeed that there are but few saved, and that the big∣ger
Part of Men that have died heretofore are gone to
Hell; but each one imagines that he lays out Matters
better for his own escape than others have done: He
don't intend to come to that Place of Torment; he
says within himself, that he intends to take Care that
shall be effectual, and to order Matters so for himself
as not to fail.</P>
<P>But the foolish Children of Men do miserably de∣lude
themselves in their own Schemes, and in their
Confidence in their own Strength and Wisdom; they
trust to nothing but a Shadow. The bigger Part of
those that heretofore have lived under the same Means
of Grace, and are now dead, are undoubtedly gone to
Hell: and it was not because they were not as wise as
those that are now alive: it was not because they did
not lay out Matters as well for themselves to secure
their own escape. If it were so, that we could come
to speak with them, and could inquire of them, one by
one, whether they expected when alive, and when they
used to hear about Hell, ever to be the Subjects of that
Misery, we doubtless should hear one and another reply,
<Q>No, I never intended to come here; I had laid out
Matters otherwise in my Mind; I thought I should
contrive well for my self; I thought my Scheme
good; I intended to take effectual Care; but it
came upon me unexpected; I did not not look for
it at that Time, and in that Manner; it came as a
<PB N="11" REF="004713_0011_0000000000000000"/>
Thief; Death outwitted me; God's Wrath was too
quick for me; O my cursed Foolishness! I was
flattering my self, and pleasing my self with vain
Dreams of what I would do hereafter, and when I
was saying Peace and Safety, then sudden Destructi∣on
came upon me.</Q></P>
<P>10. God has laid himself under <HI>no Obligation</HI> by any
Promis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" REASON="missing" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="missing" DISP="〈◊〉"/> keep any natural Man out of Hell one
Moment. God certainly has made no Promises either
of eternal Life, or of any Deliverance or Preservation
from eternal Death, but what are contained in the Co∣venant
of Grace, the Promises that are given in Christ
in whom all the Promises are Yea and Amen. But
surely they have no Interest in the Promises of the Co∣venant
of Grace that are not the Children of the Cove∣nant,
and that don't believe in any of the Promises of the
Covenant, and have no Interest in the <HI>Mediator</HI> of the
Covenant.</P>
<P>So that whatever some have imagined and pretended
about Promises made to natural Men's earnest seeking
and knocking, 'tis plain and manifest that whatever
Pains a natural Man takes in Religion, whatever Prayers
he makes, till he believes in Christ, God is under no
manner of Obligation to keep him a <HI>Moment</HI> from
eternal Destruction.</P>
<P>So that thus it is, that natural Men are held in the
Hand of God over the Pit of Hell; they have de∣served
the fiery Pit, and are already sentenced to it;
and God is dreadfully provoked, his Anger is as great
towards them as to those that are actually suffering the
Executions of the fierceness of his Wrath in Hell, and
they have done nothing in the least to appease or abate
that Anger, neither is God in the least bound by any
Promise to hold 'em up one moment; the Devil is
waiting for them, Hell is gaping for them, the Flames
<PB N="12" REF="004713_0012_0000000000000000"/>
gather and flash about them, and would fain lay hold
on them, and swallow them up; the Fire pent up in
their own Hearts is struggling to break out; and they
have no Interest in any Mediator, there are no Means
within Reach that can be any Security to them. In
short, they have no Refuge, nothing to take hold of,
all that preserves them every Moment is the meer ar∣bitrary
Will, and uncovenanted unobliged Forbearance
of an incensed God.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>The USE may be of <HI>Awakening</HI> to unconverted
Persons in this Congregation. This that you have
heard is the Case of every one of you that are out of
Christ. That World of Misery, that Lake of burning
Brimstone is extended abroad under you. <HI>There</HI> is the
dreadful Pit of the glowing Flames of the Wrath of
God; there is Hell's wide gaping Mouth open; and
you have nothing to stand upon, nor any Thing to take
hold of: there is nothing between you and Hell but
the Air; 'tis only the Power and meer Pleasure of
God that holds you up.</P>
<P>You probably are not sensible of this; you find you
are kept out of Hell, but don't see the Hand of God
in it, but look at other Things, as the good State of
your bodily Constitution, your Care of your own Life,
and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" REASON="missing" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you use for your own Preservation. But
indeed these Things are nothing; if God should with∣draw
his Hand, they would avail no more to keep you
from falling, than the thin Air to hold up a Person
that is suspended in it.</P>
<P>Your Wickedness makes you as it were heavy as Lead,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" REASON="missing" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> downwards with great Weight and Pressure
towards Hell; and if God should let you go, you
would immediately sink and swiftly descend &amp; plunge
<PB N="13" REF="004713_0013_0000000000000000"/>
into the bottomless Gulf, and your healthy Constitution,
and your own Care and Prudence, and best Contri∣vance,
and all your Righteousness, would have no more
Influence to uphold you and keep you out of Hell,
than a Spider's Web would have to stop a falling Rock.
Were it not that so is the sovereign Pleasure of God,
the Earth would not bear you one Moment; for you
are a Burden to it; the Creation groans with you; the
Creature is made Subject to the Bondage of your Cor∣ruption,
not willingly; the Sun don't willingly shine
upon you to give you Light to serve Sin and Satan; the
Earth don't willingly yield her Increase to satisfy your
Lusts; nor is it willingly a Stage for your Wicked∣ness
to be acted upon; the Air don't willingly serve
you for Breath to maintain the Flame of Life in your
Vitals, while you spend your Life in the Service of
God's Enemies. God's Creatures are Good, and were
made for Men to serve God with, and don't willingly
subserve to any other Purpose, and groan when they
are abused to Purposes so directly contrary to their Na∣ture
and End. And the World would spue you out,
were it not for the sovereign Hand of him who hath
subjected it in Hope. There are the black Clouds of
God's Wrath now hanging directly over your Heads,
full of the dreadful Storm, and big with Thunder;
and were it not for the restraining Hand of God it
would immediately burst forth upon you. The sove∣reign
Pleasure of God for the present stays his rough
Wind; otherwise it would come with Fury, and your
Destruction would come like a Whirlwind, and you
would be like the Chaff of the Summer threshing
Floor.</P>
<P>The Wrath of God is like great Waters that are dam∣med
for the present; they increase more and more, &amp; rise
higher and higher, till an Outlet is given, and the lon∣ger
<PB N="14" REF="004713_0014_0000000000000000"/>
the Stream is stop'd, the more rapid and mighty
is it's Course, when once it is let loose. 'Tis true, that
Judgment against your evil Works has not been exe∣cuted
hitherto; the Floods of God's Vengeance have
been with-held; but your Guilt in the mean Time is
constantly increasing, and you are every Day treasuring
up more Wrath; the Waters are continually rising
and waxing more and more mighty; and there is
nothing but the meer Pleasure of God that holds the
Waters back that are unwilling to be stopped, and
press hard to go forward; if God should only with∣draw
his Hand from the Flood-Gate, it would imme∣diately
fly open, and the fiery Floods of the Fierceness
and Wrath of God would rush forth with inconceivable
Fury, and would come upon you with omnipotent
Power; and if your Strength were ten thousand Times
greater than it is, yea ten thousand Times greater than
the Strength of the stoutest, sturdiest Devil in Hell, it
would be nothing to withstand or endure it.</P>
<P>The Bow of God's Wrath is bent, and the Arrow
made ready on the String, and Justice bends the Arrow
at your Heart, and strains the Bow, and it is nothing
but the meer Pleasure of God, and that of an angry
God, without any Promise or Obligation at all, that
keeps the Arrow one Moment from being made drunk
with your Blood.</P>
<P>Thus are all you that never passed under a great
Change of Heart, by the mighty Power of the SPIRIT
of GOD upon your Souls; all that were never born
again, and made new Creatures, and raised from being
dead in Sin, to a State of new, and before altogether
unexperienced Light and Life, (however you may have
reformed your Life in many Things, and may have
had religious Affections, and may keep up a Form of
Religion in your Families and Closets, and in the House
<PB N="15" REF="004713_0015_0000000000000000"/>
of God, and may be strict in it,) you are thus in the
Hands of an angry God; 'tis nothing but his meer
Pleasure that keeps you from being this Moment swal∣lowed
up in everlasting Destruction.</P>
<P>However unconvinced you may now be of the Truth
of what you hear, by &amp; by you will be fully convinced
of it. Those that are gone from being in the
like Circumstances with you, see that it was so with
them; for Destruction came suddenly upon most of
them, when they expected nothing of it, and while
they were saying, <HI>Peace and Safety:</HI> Now they see,
that those Things that they depended on for Peace and
Safety, were nothing but thin Air and empty Sha∣dows.</P>
<P>The God that holds you over the Pit of Hell,
much as one holds a Spider, or some loathsome Insect,
over the Fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked;
his Wrath towards you burns like Fire; he looks upon
you as worthy of nothing else, but to be cast into the
Fire; he is of purer Eyes than to bear to have you in his
Sight; you are ten thousand Times so abominable in
his Eyes as the most hateful venomous Serpent is in
ours. You have offended him infinitely more than
ever a stubborn Rebel did his Prince: and yet 'tis no∣thing
but his Hand that holds you from falling into
the Fire every Moment: 'Tis to be ascribed to nothing
else, that you did not go to Hell the last Night; that
you was suffer'd to awake again in this World, after
you closed your Eyes to sleep: and there is no other
Reason to be given why you have not dropped into
Hell since you arose in the Morning, but that God's
Hand has held you up: There is no other Reason to
be given why you han't gone to Hell since you have
sat here in the House of God, provoking his pure
Eyes by your sinful wicked Manner of attending
<PB N="16" REF="004713_0016_0000000000000000"/>
his solemn Worship: Yea, there is nothing else that is
to be given as a Reason why you don't this very Mo∣ment
drop down into Hell.</P>
<P>O Sinner! Consider the fearful Danger you are in:
'Tis a great Furnace of Wrath, a wide and bottomless
Pit, full of the Fire of Wrath, that you are held over
in the Hand of that God, whose Wrath is provoked
and incensed as much against you as against many of
the Damned in Hell: You hang by a slender Thread,
with the Flames of divine Wrath flashing about it, and
ready every Moment to singe it, and burn it asunder;
and you have no Interest in any Mediator, and no∣thing
to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep
off the Flames of Wrath, nothing of your own, no∣thing
that you ever have done, nothing that you can
do, to induce God to spare you one Moment.</P>
<P>And consider here more particularly several Things
concerning that Wrath that you are in such Danger of.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Whose</HI> Wrath it is: It is the Wrath of the
infinite GOD. If it were only the Wrath of Man, tho'
it were of the most potent Prince, it would be com∣paratively
little to be regarded. The Wrath of Kings
is very much dreaded, especially of absolute Monarchs,
that have the Possessions and Lives of their Subjects
wholly in their Power, to be disposed of at their meer
Will. Prov. 20. 2. <HI>The Fear of a King is as the Roar∣ing
of a Lion: whoso provoketh him to Anger, sinneth a∣gainst
his own Soul.</HI> The Subject that very much en∣rages
an arbitrary Prince, is liable to suffer the most ex∣tream
Torments, that human Art can invent or human
Power can inflict. But the greatest earthly Potentates,
in their greatest Majesty and Strength, and when
cloathed in their greatest Terrors, are but feeble des∣picable
Worms of the Dust, in Comparison of the
great and almighty Creator and King of Heaven and
<PB N="17" REF="004713_0017_0000000000000000"/>
Earth: It is but little that they can do, when most
enraged, and when they have exerted the utmost of
their Fury. All the Kings of the Earth before GOD
are as Grashoppers, they are nothing and less than no∣thing:
Both their Love and their Hatred is to be
despised. The Wrath of the great King of Kings is
as much more terrible than their's, as his Majesty is
greater. Luke 12. 4, 5. <HI>And I say unto you my Friends,
be not afraid of them that kill the Body, and after that
have no more that they can do: But I will forewarn
you whom ye shall fear; fear him, which after he hath
killed, hath Power to cast into Hell; yea I say unto you,
fear him.</HI></P>
<P>2. 'Tis the <HI>Fierceness</HI> of his Wrath that you are
exposed to. We often read of the <HI>Fury</HI> of God; as
in Isai. 59. 18. <HI>According to their Deeds, accordingly he
will repay Fury to his Adversaries.</HI> So Isai. 66. 15.
<HI>For behold, the Lord will come with Fire, and with Cha∣riots
like a Whirlwind, to render his Anger with Fury,
and his Rebukes with Flames of Fire.</HI> And so in many
other Places. So we read of God's <HI>Fierceness.</HI> Rev.
19. 15. There we read of <HI>the Winepress of the Fierce∣ness
and Wrath of Almighty God.</HI> The Words are
exceeding terrible: if it had only been said, <HI>the Wrath
of God,</HI> the Words would have implied that which is
infinitely dreadful: But 'tis not only said so, but <HI>the
Fierceness and Wrath of God:</HI> the Fury of God! the
Fierceness of Jehovah! Oh how dreadful must that
be! Who can utter or conceive what such Expressions
carry in them! But it is not only said so, but <HI>the
Fierceness and Wrath of ALMIGHTY GOD.</HI> As
tho' there would be a very great Manifestation of his
almighty Power, in what the fierceness of his Wrath
should inflict, as tho' Omnipotence should be as it
were enraged, and exerted, as Men are wont to exert
<PB N="18" REF="004713_0018_0000000000000000"/>
their Strength in the fierceness of their Wrath. Oh!
then what will be the Consequence! What will be∣come
of the poor Worm that shall suffer it! Whose
Hands can be strong? and whose Heart endure? To
what a dreadful, inexpressible, inconceivable Depth of
Misery must the poor Creature be sunk, who shall be
the Subject of this!</P>
<P>Consider this, you that are here present, that yet re∣main
in an unregenerate State. That God will execute
the fierceness of his Anger, implies that he will inflict
Wrath without any Pity: when God beholds the in∣effable
Extremity of your Case, and sees your Torment
to be so vastly disproportion'd to your Strength, and
sees how your poor Soul is crushed and sinks down,
as it were into an infinite Gloom, he will have no
Compassion upon you, he will not forbear the Execu∣tions
of his Wrath, or in the least lighten his Hand;
there shall be no Moderation or Mercy, nor will God
then at all stay his rough Wind; he will have no Re∣gard
to your Welfare, nor be at all careful lest you
should suffer too much, in any other Sense than only
that you shall not suffer beyond what strict Justice
requires: nothing shall be with held, because it's so
hard for you to bear. Ezek. 8. 18. <HI>Therefore will I
also deal in Fury; mine Eye shall not spare, neither will
I have Pity; and tho' they cry in mine Ears with a loud
Voice, yet I will not heat them.</HI> Now God stands
ready to pity you; this is a Day of Mercy; you may
cry now with some Encouragement of obtaining Mer∣cy:
but when once the Day of Mercy is past, your
most lamentable and dolorous Cries and Shrieks will
be in vain; you will be wholly lost and thrown away
of God as to any Regard to your Welfare; God will
have no other Use to put you to but only to suffer
Misery: you shall be continued in Being to no other
<PB N="19" REF="004713_0019_0000000000000000"/>
End; for you will be a Vessel of Wrath fitted to De∣struction;
and there will be no other Use of this Vessel
but only to be filled full of Wrath: God will be so
far from pitying you when you cry to him, that 'tis
said he will only <HI>Laugh and Mock,</HI> Prov. 1. 25, 26, &amp;c.</P>
<P>How awful are those Words, Isai. 63. 3. which are
the Words of the great God, <HI>I will tread them in mine
Anger, and will trample them in my Fury, and their
Blood shall be sprinkled upon my Garments, and I will
stain all my Raiment.</HI> 'Tis perhaps impossible to con∣ceive
of Words that carry in them greater Manifesta∣tions
of these three Things, <HI>viz.</HI> Contempt, and Ha∣tred,
and fierceness of Indignation. If you cry to God
to pity you, he will be so far from pitying you in your
doleful Case, or shewing you the least Regard or Fa∣vour,
that instead of that he'll only tread you under
Foot: And tho' he will know that you can't bear
the Weight of Omnipotence treading upon you, yet
he won't regard that, but he will crush you under his
Feet without Mercy; he'll crush out your Blood, and
make it fly, and it shall be sprinkled on his Garments,
so as to stain all his Raiment. He will not only hate
you, but he will have you in the utmost Contempt;
no Place shall be thought fit for you, but under his
Feet, to be trodden down as the Mire of the Streets.</P>
<P>3. The Misery you are exposed to is that which
God will inflict to that End, that he might <HI>shew</HI> what
that <HI>Wrath</HI> of JEHOVAH is. God hath had it on
his Heart to shew to Angels and Men, both how
excellent his Love is, and also how terrible his Wrath
is. Sometimes earthly Kings have a Mind to shew
how terrible <HI>their</HI> Wrath is, by the extream Punish∣ments
they would execute on those that provoke 'em.
<HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> that mighty and haughty Monarch
<PB N="20" REF="004713_0020_0000000000000000"/>
of the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Empire, was willing to shew <HI>his</HI>
Wrath, when enraged with <HI>Shadrach, Meshech,</HI> and
<HI>Abednego;</HI> and accordingly gave Order that the burn∣ing
fiery Furnace should be het seven Times hotter
than it was before; doubtless it was raised to the
utmost Degree of Fierceness that humane Art could
raise it: But the great GOD is also willing to shew
<HI>his Wrath,</HI> and magnify his awful Majesty and mighty
Power in the extream Sufferings of his Enemies. Rom.
9. 22. <HI>What if God willing to shew HIS Wrath, and
to make his Power known, endured with much Long-suffering
the Vessels of Wrath fitted to Destruction?</HI>
And seeing this is his Design, and what he has deter∣mined,
to shew how terrible the unmixed, unrestrain∣ed
Wrath, the Fury and Fierceness of JEHOVAH is,
he will do it to Effect. There will be something ac∣complished
and brought to pass, that will be dreadful
with a Witness. When the great and angry God
hath risen up and executed his awful Vengeance on
the poor Sinner; and the Wretch is actually suffer∣ing
the infinite Weight and Power of his Indignation,
then will God call upon the whole Universe to behold
that awful Majesty, and mighty Power that is to be
seen in it. Isai. 33. 12, 13, 14. <HI>And the People shall
be as the burning of Lime, as Thorns cut up shall they
be burnt in the Fire. Hear ye that are far off what I
have done; and ye that are near acknowledge my Might.
The Sinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulness hath sur∣prized
the Hypocrites &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it will be with you that are in an unconverted
State, if you continue in it; the infinite Might, and
Majesty and Terribleness of the OMNIPOTENT GOD
shall be magnified upon you, in the ineffable Strength
of your Torments: Yea shall be tormented in the
Presence of the holy Angels, and in the Presence of
<PB N="21" REF="004713_0021_0000000000000000"/>
the Lamb; and when you shall be in this State of
Suffering, the glorious Inhabitants of Heaven shall go
forth and look on the awful Spectacle, that they may
see what the Wrath and Fierceness of the Almighty
is, and when they have seen it, they will fall down
and adore that great Power and Majesty. Isai. 66. 23,
24. <HI>And it shall come to pass, that from one new Moon
to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all Flesh
come to Worship before me, saith the Lord; and they
shall go forth and lock upon the Carcasses of the Men
that have transgressed against me; for their Worm shall
not die, neither shall their Fire be quenched, and they
shall be an abhorring unto all Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>4. 'Tis <HI>everlasting</HI> Wrath. It would be dreadful
to suffer this Fierceness and Wrath of Almighty God
one Moment; but you must suffer it to all Eternity:
there will be no End to this exquisite horrible Misery:
When you look forward, you shall see a long Forever,
a boundless Duration before you, which will swallow
up your Thoughts, and amaze your Soul; and you
will absolutely despair of ever having any Deliverance,
any End, any Mitigation, any Rest at all; you will
know certainly that you must wear out long Ages,
Millions of Millions of Ages, in wrestling and con∣flicting
with this almighty merciless Vengeance; and
then when you have so done, when so many Ages
have actually been spent by you in this Manner, you
will know that all is but a Point to what remains. So
that your Punishment will indeed be infinite. Oh
who can express what the Stare of a Soul in such Cir∣cumstances
is! All that we can possibly say about it,
gives but a very feeble saint Representation of it; 'tis
inexpressible and inconceivable: for <HI>who knows the
Power of God's Anger?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004713_0022_0000000000000000"/>
How dreadful is the State of those that are daily
and hourly in Danger of this great Wrath, and infinite
Misery! But this is the dismal Case of every Soul in
this Congregation, that has not been born again, how∣ever
moral and strict, sober and religious they may
otherwise be. Oh that you would consider it, whether
you be Young or Old. There is Reason to think, that
there are many in this Congregation now hearing this
Discourse, that will actually be the Subjects of this
very Misery to all Eternity. We know not who they
are, or in what Seats they sit, or what Thoughts they
now have: it may be they are now at Ease, and hear
all these Things without much Disturbance, and are
now flattering themselves that they are not the Persons,
promising themselves that they shall escape. If we
knew that there was one Person, and but one, in the
whole Congregation that was to be the Subject of
this Misery, what an awful Thing would it be to
think of! If we knew who it was, what an awful
Sight would it be to see such a Person! How might
all the rest of the Congregation lift up a lamentable
and bitter Cry over him! But alass! instead of one,
how many is it likely will remember this Discourse in
Hell? And it would be a Wonder if some that are now
present, should not be in Hell in a very short Time,
before this Year is out. And it would be no Wonder
if some Person that now sits here in some Seat of this
Meeting-House in Health, and quiet &amp; secure, should be
there before to morrow Morning. Those of you that
finally continue in a natural Condition, that shall keep out
of Hell longest, will be there in a little Time! your
Damnation don't slumber; it will come swiftly, and
in all probability very suddenly upon many of you.
You have Reason to wonder, that you are not already
in Hell. 'Tis doubtless the Case of some that here∣tofore
<PB N="23" REF="004713_0023_0000000000000000"/>
you have seen and known, that never deserved
Hell more than you, and that heretofore appeared as
likely to have been now alive as you: Their Case is
past all Hope; they are crying in extream Misery
and perfect Despair; but here you are in the Land of
the Living, and in the House of God, and have an
Opportunity to obtain Salvation. What would not
those poor damned, hopeless Souls give for one Day's
such Opportunity as you now enjoy!</P>
<P>And now you have an extraordinary Opportunity, a
Day wherein CHRIST has flung the Door of Mercy
wide open, and stands in the Door calling and crying
with a loud Voice to poor Sinners; a Day wherein
many are flocking to him, and pressing into the
Kingdom of God; many are daily coming from the
East, West, North and South; many that were very
lately in the same miserable Condition that you are
in, are in now an happy State, with their Hearts filled
with Love to Him that has loved them and washed
them from their Sins in his own Blood, and rejoycing
in Hope of the Glory of God. How awful is it to
be left behind at such a Day! To see so many others
feasting, while you are pining and perishing! To see
so many rejoycing and singing for Joy of Heart, while
you have Cause to mourn for Sorrow of Heart, and
howl for Vexation of Spirit! How can you rest one
Moment in such a Condition? Are not your Souls as
precious as the Souls of the People at<NOTE PLACE="foot" N="*">The next neighbour Town.</NOTE> <HI>Suffield,</HI> where
they are flocking from Day to Day to Christ?</P>
<P>Are there not many here that have lived <HI>long</HI> in the
World, that are not to this Day born again, and so are
Aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel, and have
<PB N="24" REF="004713_0024_0000000000000000"/>
done nothing ever since they have lived, but treasure
up Wrath against the Day of Wrath? Oh Sirs, your
Case in an especial Manner is extreamly dangerous;
your Guilt and Hardness of Heart is extreamly great.
Don't you see how generally Persons of your Years are
pass'd over and left, in the present remarkable &amp; won∣derful
Dispensation of God's Mercy? You had need
to consider your selves, and wake throughly out of
Sleep; you cannot bear the Fierceness and Wrath of
the infinite GOD.</P>
<P>And you that are <HI>young Men,</HI> and <HI>young Women,</HI>
will you neglect this precious Season that you now en∣joy,
when so many others of your Age are renounc∣ing
all youthful Vanities, and flocking to CHRIST?
You especially have now an extraordinary Opportu∣nity;
but if you neglect it, it will soon be with you
as it is with those Persons that spent away all the pre∣cious
Days of Youth in Sin, and are now come to
such a dreadful pass in blindness and hardness.</P>
<P>And you <HI>Children</HI> that are unconverted, don't you
know that you are going down to Hell, to bear the
dreadful Wrath of that God that is now angry with
you every Day, and every Night? Will you be
content to be the Children of the Devil, when so ma∣ny
other Children in the Land are converted, and are
become the holy and happy Children of the King of
Kings?</P>
<P>And let every one that is yet out of Christ, and
hanging over the Pit of Hell, whether they be old
Men and Women, or middle Aged, or young Peo∣ple,
or little Children, now hearken to the loud Calls
of God's Word and Providence. This acceptable
Year of the LORD, that is a Day of such great Fa∣vour
to some, will doubtless be a Day of as remar∣kable
Vengeance to others. Men's Hearts harden,
<PB N="25" REF="004713_0025_0000000000000000"/>
and their Guilt increases apace at such a Day as this,
if they neglect their Souls: and never was there so
great Danger of such Persons being given up to hard∣ness
of Heart, and blindness of Mind. God seems
now to be hastily gathering in his Elect in all Parts of
the Land; and probably the bigger Part of adult
Persons that ever shall be saved, will be brought in
now in a little Time, and that it will be as it was on
that great out-pouring of the SPIRIT upon the <HI>Jews</HI>
in the Apostles Days, the Election will obtain, and
the rest will be blinded. If this should be the Case
with you, you will eternally curse this Day, and will
curse the Day that ever you was born, to see such a
Season of the pouring out of God's Spirit; and will
wish that you had died and gone to Hell before you
had seen it. Now undoubtedly it is, as it was in the
Days of <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> the Ax is in an extraordi∣nary
Manner laid at the Root of the Trees, that every
Tree that brings not forth good Fruit, may be hewen
down, and cast into the Fire.</P>
<P>Therefore let every one that is out of CHRIST, now
awake and fly from the Wrath to come. The Wrath
of almighty GOD is now undoubtedly hanging over
great Part of this Congregation: Let every one fly
out of <HI>Sodom: Haste and escape for your Lives, look
not behind you, escape to the Mountain, least you be
consumed.</HI></P>
