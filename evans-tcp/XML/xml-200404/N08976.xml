<HEAD>A seasonable ADVERTISEMENT to the <HI>Free∣holders</HI>
and <HI>Freemen</HI> of the City of <HI>New-York,</HI>
and all the real Friends to Liberty,
and Lovers of their Country.</HEAD>
<P>AS Nothing can be more essential to the Safety of the Country than the
conducting of Elections free from Corruption on the one Hand, and
Threats and Terror on the other. And as a Number of resolute Freeholders
and Freemen of easy Circumstances, who utterly abhor and detest such scan∣dalous
Practices, are credibly informed, that such Artifices are made use of,
to destroy the Freedom of the ensuing Election, they do hereby give Notice
to all upon whom any Attempts of that Kind have been, or may be made,
that as soon as the Election is over, they will devise a Mode for laying the
Proofs before the Publick, and bringing the Delinquents to due Punishment,
for the double Purpose of exposing those atrocious Invaders of the Rights of
the People, and to do Honour to those who shall nobly stand to their Integri∣ty;
whose Losses will doubtless be amply recompenced by those worthy Citi∣zens
who cannot bear the shocking Spectacle of seeing Freemen and English∣men,
on Account of their Poverty, treated like the most abject Slaves.
And all Persons are particularly desired to take Notice, whether any, and
who of his Majesty's Council of this Province, are concerned in influencing
the ensuing Election; and to give the proper Intelligence by leaving an Ac∣count
thereof with the Printer.</P>
