<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Piece, occasion'd by the setting up a <HI>Printing-Press</HI> in <HI>Williamsburg,</HI> justly claims a Title to some Share of Your Protec∣tion, as the Subject-Matter of it, the Art of <HI>PRINTING,</HI> owes to You its Patronage and En∣couragement; whence, by a natural Deduction, this ought as necessarily to follow the Fate and Fortune of that, as Effects do their Causes.</P>
<P>IF upon the Prospect of a great many Advantages be∣yond-peradventure likely to accrue to this Colony, from an ART so long wanting among us, I have not been able to restrain my own Inclinations to write the ensuing Trifle, (the first Essay of this Kind attempted here,) I hope this at least will make it the less inexcusable, that I have said nothing herein, which, I am confident, will not be readily assented to, by all who have the Happiness to live under the present Administration, in this Colony: Unless, perhaps, this Exception be taken, that where a disinterested and unprejudic'd PATRIOTISM,
<PB N="iv" REF="003298_0003_0F692649B8F498D0"/>
(for I will not be asham'd of the Word) of a Governor to his People, and a reciprocal Affection and Obedience of them to Him is to be describ'd, the Author of this Piece may have wanted a Scale of Thought and Compre∣hension equal to the Height of the Merits <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the One, or the cordial Duty of the other; and that on such a Subject it were better to be silent, than to say too little. I must confess there is some Weight in the Argument; but I seek not to palliate my Imperfections of that Na∣ture, lest I should be answer'd with the same sarcastic Question as <HI>Albinus,</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Author, was by <HI>Cato,</HI> on the same Occasion, <HI>Whether any one had compelled me to write</HI>?</P>
<P>BUT, to obviate this Objection, I would only have Recourse to the Sense of this whole Colony, so often and so heartily express'd in their several Addresses; which I hope will freely remit me to the Moderation of ONE, whose Judgment, tho' it must censure the Weakness, whose Modesty, tho' it must tax the Boldness, yet His Candor will excuse the Endeavours of so humble a Talent as mine, who could propose no other to myself by this present Undertaking, than to manifest with what Sincerity of Observance and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to be thought,</P>
