<P>And he took the Mantle of Elijah, that fell from him, and smote the Waters, and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FAMOUS is the History of <HI>Elijah,</HI> the renowned Prophet of the God of <HI>Israel</HI>; his Zeal for the Lord of Host, his Fidelity and Courage in his Ma∣sters Service, the Miracles which he wrought, and his triumphant Ascention into Heaven, in a Chariot of Fire, make a considerable Figure in the sacred Story. Nor less illustrious is <HI>Eli∣sha,</HI> whom God had ordered <HI>Elijah</HI> to anoint his Successor, to be a Prophet of the Lord in his room▪ Tho' <HI>Elijah</HI> is jealous of the Name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="2" REF="002501_0004_0FDB67E157C5DC78"/>
Honour of the God of Israel, yet is he not jea∣lous of his own Name and Honour; but, while he is yet alive, takes his Successor under his Patronage, does what he can to furnish him for his Work, to raise him in the Esteem and Affections of the People, and rejoices that he is like to leave the work of the Lord in such able Hands, ready to sing his <HI>nunc dimitti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> now Lord lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</P>
<P>THIS Chapter where my Text is, contains the History of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Translation; (for God honoured him at his Death, that he went an unusual road to Glory) and <HI>Elisha</HI>'s entring up∣on the prophetick Function. <HI>Elisha</HI> was appri∣sed of the glorious Exit his <HI>Master</HI> was about to make, and resolves to keep close to him, that he might loose none of the advantages of his Instruction and Converse, and that he might have his own Faith in the invisible World strengthned by the opening of such a bright Scene of Glory.</P>
<P><HI>ELIIAH</HI> having made his last visit to the several <HI>Colleges</HI> of the Prophets, and taken his leave of them, now bids <HI>Elisha</HI> ask what he shall do for him, e're he departs from him.</P>
<P>GREAT the Request which <HI>Elisha</HI> makes; which shewed his Mind intensly fixed upon his Work, and that he desired nothing more than to be thorowly furnished for it. <HI>Let</HI> (says he) <HI>a double Portion of thy Spirit be upon me</HI>; double to the rest of the Sons of the Prophets, that he might be acknowledged his Successor, and wor∣thy the Dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002501_0005_0FDB67E8734FAE60"/><HI>ELIIAH</HI> grants his Request, upon Con∣dition of his seeing him when he ascended, if he continue faithful to him to the last. And God said Amen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o it.</P>
<P>ANON the illustrious Scene appears, the bright Seraphs take <HI>Elijah</HI> in their flaming Chariot, conduct him thro' the Devil's Terri∣tories, and give him a quick, safe▪ and easy passage to Glory, and <HI>Elisha</HI> saw it. Upon which,</P>
<P>HE first pays his last Homage to his endear∣ed Predecessor, drops a Tear at his Departure, bright almost as the Chariot the Prophet rode in, celebrates his Worth, expresses his just esteem and veneration for him, and groans out his Sorrows, in strains as weighty almost as his Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>My Father, my Father, the Chariot of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof.</HI></P>
<P>AND then, he immediately applied himself to the business of his Function: he saw <HI>Elijah</HI> ascend, and he lays hold on the promise made him, and takes up the Mantle of the Prophet, the Badge of his Office, as a sure pledge left him, of his succeeding him in his Office, and of a double portion of his Spirit resting upon him; and returns directly to the School of the Pro∣phets at <HI>Iericho,</HI> to shew the tokens of the Di∣vine Presence with him, have his Office recog∣nised, and begin his Charge. In his way thi∣ther, the River <HI>Iordan</HI> interrupted his Passage, and affords the <HI>first</HI> Proof of his Mission, and the Spirit of God resting upon him, as it was the <HI>last</HI> of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s▪ Which brings me to my Text▪</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002501_0006_0FDB67E98F7E04C8"/><HI>AND he took the Mantle of Elijah,</HI> &amp;c. He had <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I. King. XIX.19, 20.</NOTE> formerly felt the sacred Force the wondrous Power of it, when <HI>Elijah</HI> first cast it over him, and now he is willing to try whether it will be as mighty in its Operations, in his Hands, as it had <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">II. King. 12.8.</NOTE> lately been in the Hands of the old Prophet.</P>
<P><HI>AND he smote the Waters,</HI> so he had seen his Master do before him, and now that he suc∣ceeded him, he is ready to tread in his Steps, and use the like Means that the departed Pro∣phet had done, to manifest his Authority, and fulfil his Ministry.</P>
<P><HI>AND said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah?</HI> Not as doubting His Being, or his Omnipre∣sence, but 'tis an earnest putting in suit the promise <HI>Elijah</HI> had made him, in the Name of his God.
<Q><HI>Elijah</HI> indeed is gone, but <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God remains, and so long the promise is sure.</Q>
<HI>Where is the Lord God of Elijah?</HI> 'Tis an earnest but humble Address to God to be with him, as He had been with <HI>Elijah,</HI> sufficiently to autho∣rise and furnish him to his Work, to remove every Difficulty which lay in his way, to own him in his Office, and crown him with Suc∣cess.</P>
<P>AND God heard the Request of <HI>Elisha,</HI> im∣mediately gave Answer, and evident Proof of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Spirit resting upon him. For no sooner had he smitten the Waters, but the obedi∣ent Waves, as tho' they were conscious of the Divine Energy that accompanied the stroak,
<PB N="5" REF="002501_0007_0FDB67EB141985E8"/>
flee before <HI>Elisha</HI>'s God, and make way for his return to <HI>Iericho</HI>; where the Sons of the Pro∣phets, convinced by the dividing of the Waters, that the Spirit of <HI>Elijah</HI> rested upon him, came and did him Reverence, bowed down to him, and acknowledged him their <HI>Head.</HI></P>
<P>HOW entertaining the History! and how full of Instruction!</P>
<P>To resume my Text, <HI>And he took the Mantle of Elijah that fell from him,</HI> that is as was noted the badge of his Office: So <HI>Elisha</HI> becomes pos∣sessed not only of the <HI>Mantle,</HI> but of the same Character and <HI>Office</HI> of <HI>Elijah,</HI> of his Authority and Dignity, of his Care and Charge. So God takes care to raise up his Prophets, to supply his Church and People, as their wants call for; <HI>Elijah</HI> dies, but the Office dies not with him.</P>
<P>Whence I note,</P>
<P>Ob. I. <HI>THAT when God calls home His</HI> Eli∣jah<HI>'s, He will raise up</HI> Elisha<HI>'s to succeed them.</HI> God always will have work to do in this World, so long as the present frame of it shall continue, and therefore He will always find fit Instru∣ments to do His Work; He improves one In∣strument where, and so long as seemeth good to Him, and then He lays that by, and makes use of an other, as He pleases, and still is but carrying on His great Work and Design by them.</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD is often calling home His <HI>Elijah</HI>'s to Himself. The Ministers of Religion have no more pretentions to Immortality than their Neighbours, but alike are they laid in the dust, and the worm shall cover them. For the Pro∣phets
<PB N="6" REF="002501_0008_0FDB67ECDAC8E348"/>
of the Lord are but Men, cloathed with Flesh, lyable to Casualties, Diseases and Death with other Men; and their very Make and Constitution will not suffer them to continue here always. For no Man living is in Strength so great that he should still live for ever, and not see the Pit; the Grave is the House ap∣pointed for all the living, nor can any plead an exemption therefrom; we see that wise Men die, as well as the fool and the bruitish Person. <HI>Zac.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Your Fathers where are they? and the Prophets do they live for ever?</HI> no not as to their abode in Flesh, and residence in this World. Nor would they choose to continue here always; the blessed Hope of the glorious Rewards of their faithful Services, makes them willing ra∣ther to be absent from the Body, that they may be present with the Lord. Nor will their gra∣cious God continue them always in a state of Labour and Peril. God may sometimes spare them to the World, as Blessings in it, even unto a great old Age, yet He will not suffer them to be always in this World; but will in due time, as seemeth good to Him, who is Lord of Life and Death, call them home to Himself, to the blessed Rest he has provided for them, whither they retire when they are dismantled of their Flesh, even to an House not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens; they rest from their Labours and their Works follow them, and they shall be ever with the Lord.</P>
<P>THEY live for ever in the superiour Regions of Light and Joy, otherwise God would not have been the God of <HI>Elijah</HI> when he had left
<PB N="7" REF="002501_0009_0FDB67EE0A5829B0"/>
the Earth; but rather than they shall live for ever here, God will take an uncommon Method to fetch them home; He'll make a visible de∣scent of flaming Ministers of His, who shall take them under their strong Convoy, and cause them triumphantly to <HI>leap the Ditch where Man∣kind usually falls,</HI> and ascend directly to their na∣tive Skyes. So <HI>Elijah</HI> went up as by a Whirl∣wind and a Chariot of Fire into Heaven, v. 11.</P>
<P N="2">2. BUT when God so removes His Prophets by Translation, or in the more common road to Death, He will take care to provide others, to raise up <HI>Elisha</HI>'s, to fill their Place, and perform their Labours among His People. When He says to <HI>Moses</HI> go up and die, He will say to <HI>Io∣shua</HI> arise thou. Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD always had, and always will have a People in the World, till the final consumma∣tion of all things; and accordingly He always will have His Prophets, or an Order of Men, to minister in holy Things; to publish his Laws, declare His Threatnings, and proclaim His Pro∣mises, and direct His People in the path of Life.</P>
<P>FROM the Beginning the right of instruct∣ing seems to have resided in the head of the Family; but when God had called a Nation to be a peculiar People to Himself, He then con∣stituted one of the twelve Tribes to be the keep∣ers of His Laws, and the Ministers of His Al∣tars, the Stewards of His House, and the In∣structors of His People.</P>
<P>AND so has he authorised and commissioned, by His Son <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> our Lord, a standing
<PB N="8" REF="002501_0010_0FDB67F3915689A0"/>
Order of Men in the days of the Gospel, (tho' not confined to a particular Family or Tribe) to be as His ordinary Prophets, attending con∣tinually to this very thing; to represent the Person of His Son, the great Head of the Church; as Embassadors for <HI>Christ,</HI> to negoti∣ate the grand Affairs of Peace and Reconcilia∣tion between God and Man.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Canon of the Sacred Scripture was compleated, God raised up His extraordi∣nary Prophets, who under the immediate in∣spiration of the Holy Ghost, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>edicted Futuri∣ties, and revealed the Mind of God in things as yet not known; but since the Son of God in His own Person, and His Apostles immediately from Him, have perfected the Rule of Faith and Manners, so that there remains nothing more to be added to the <HI>Sacred Code,</HI> there seems to be no further occasion for such extraordinary Prophets; and therefore the ordinary Preachers of the Gospel are the only remaining standing Order of Prophets, to whom God, by His Son, hath committed the Oversight Care and Charge of His People, to divulge His Laws and Ordi∣nances, lay open His Covenant, lead Men into the Blessing, and apply the Seals of the Cove∣nant to them, and to debar and cut off the visibly prophane and unholy from medling with His hallowed Institutions.</P>
<P>WHEREVER God has provided Himself a Church, there He will also take care to provide such as shall minister to them in holy Things, to gather together His Elect, and fill up the Body of His Church, the fulness of Him who
<PB N="9" REF="002501_0011_0FDB67F8F3D666A8"/>
filleth all in all. Hence 'tis we read, <HI>Eph.</HI> IV.11— <HI>And he gave some Apostles, and some Pro∣phets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and Know∣ledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. TO these His ordinary Ministers, He com∣mits the sacred Badge, as the <HI>Mantle of Elijah,</HI> the Divine Commission, Authority and Power, of the Guides, Overseers, and Rulers of His Church; and will continue to raise up of the same Order of Men, invested with the same sacred Office▪ Power and Betrustment, even to the worlds end. Hence our Saviour said to His Apostles, when He deliver'd their full Com∣mission to them, with an eye to them that should succeed them thro'out all Gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations, <HI>Lo I am with you always, to the end of the World</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Math.</HI> XXVIII.20.</NOTE>. 'Tis very evident, by the mode of Speech, that our Saviour engages to be with His Ministers to the end of Time; <HI>always,</HI> and <HI>to the worlds end,</HI> being necessarily to be understood in a literal Sence, and are explanatory one of an other: and since the Apostles did not continue always to the end of the World, but died like other Men, 'tis very evident therefore that our Savi∣our, when He says, <HI>I will be with you,</HI> meant not only with you my Apostles, but with all my Ministers that shall come after you, whom I invest with this same Commission which I
<PB N="10" REF="002501_0012_0FDB67FA33E28438"/>
now bestow upon you: And this necessarily supposes that there shall be such an Order of Men to the end of the World.</P>
<P>THE Institution was not Temporary, and to endure only for a Season, so song as our blessed Saviour and His Apostles were upon Earth; but as the Conversion of Sinners, the Confirmation of Saints, and the Regimen and Government of the House of God renders the Reason of their Office the same, to the end of World, so God will take care to raise up a suc∣cession of Ministers, a supply to His Church of Men in sacred Order, that shall wear the Character, and perform the Office of His Mi∣nisters unto His Church, till Time shall be no more.</P>
<P>To return,</P>
<P><HI>HE,</HI> (Elisha) <HI>took the Mantle of</HI> Elijah <HI>that fell from him, and smote the Waters.</HI> So he had seen <HI>Elijah</HI> smite the Waters with this very Mantle but a little before; and it was with the same strong Faith in God, and Spirit of Devotion to∣wards Him, <HI>Elisha</HI> smote the Waters, that <HI>Eli∣jah</HI> was acted with; <HI>and when he also had smit∣ten the Waters, they parted hither and thither, and Elisha went over.</HI></P>
<P>From whence I note,</P>
<P N="2">II. Ob. <HI>THAT it highly becomes those whom God puts into the Ministry, as much as may be, to tread in the laudable Steps, and be acted by the same good Spirit of those venerable Fathers, whom they have seen go before them in their Work and Ser∣vice.</HI> How nearly does <HI>Elisha</HI> follow <HI>Elijah</HI>; he lays his Copy before him, and transcribes
<PB N="11" REF="002501_0013_0FDB67FB8D903E88"/>
exactly after it: and the same Spirit that acted the one acted the other also. For surely it ever becomes the Prophets and Ministers of the Lord, as far as in them lies, to prevent all so∣loecism in Rule, incongruity of Parts, and dis∣cord in the Harmony of the divine Precepts, Institution, and Worship. Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY should <HI>tread in the same laudable Steps</HI> their venerable Fathers have gone before them in. They that rise up in the ministerial Order, in all their Services in the Temple, should be careful to walk <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phil.</HI> III.16.</NOTE> by the same Rule, and mind the same things, therein imitating those Men of God that go before them, so far as is consistent with Truth and Holiness. For we are not so tied up to the Example of others, as to be obliged to copy their Errors, in case they should introduce any in their Doctrine or Worship, but may very justly and laudably dis∣sent from them in our practice therein; but so far as we see them walking in the way the great Head of the Church h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h layed out, so far we should endeavour a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose adherence to them. This was the apostolical Direction, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> XI.1. <HI>Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</HI> If therefore their Predecessors were faithful in the House of God, strictly ad∣hered, as they were able, to the Divine Institu∣tions, approving themselves able Ministers of the New Testament, nourished up in the words of Faith and good Doctrine; so too should they, that rise up as in the room of their Fathers, hold
<PB N="12" REF="002501_0014_0FDB67FFF536BDE0"/>
fast the form of sound Doctrine, which has been delivered to them; <HI>to the Law and to the Testi∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny,</HI> speaking, and acting according to the best Light they can receive therefrom.</P>
<P>ON the one hand, they must not basely be∣tray the Cause and Interest of their God, give up the Rights, Dignity, and Authority of their Office and Station, to every capricious, igno∣rant and bold Intruder; but take the Mantle and wear it, and make such Improvement of it, as may be necessary to smite the Waters, to re∣move the Obstacles that lie in the way of their Masters Service, or gently cast the skirt of it over the willing and obedient.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, they must take heed of setting up for themselves, as tho' all were their own, and they were Lords of the Heritage; they must neither add to, nor detract from the sacred Injunctions, but carefully observe the Pattern, and Form, the outgoings and incom∣ings of the House of God, which those who in∣troduce them into the sacred Order have been faithful in, and make over to them as a sacred Depositum committed to their trust. They must feed the Flock of God with the same Bread and Water of Life, the same Word and Doctrine, minister the same Seals and Disci∣pline, and maintain the same Inspection Care and Watch over them, or if possible greater; that in all things they may approve themselves faithful Stewards in the House of God, not suf∣fering His Ordinances to be evaporated into into Smoak on the one hand, nor loaded with thick Clay on the other.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="002501_0015_0FDB6800CF1FBC10"/>2. AND then, as he is to tread in the same regular Steps, so is he to be acted by the <HI>same good Spirit,</HI> of his venerable Fathers. What will the Mantle of <HI>Elijah</HI> avail without the Spi∣rit of <HI>Elijah?</HI> He may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear the Badges of the high Office, and come into the room of an o∣ther <HI>local<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y as a piece of Lumber,</HI> but neither <HI>ra∣tionally</HI> nor <HI>morally,</HI> as becomes a reasonable and religious Creature, unless he is acted by the same good Spirit, without which he will never make good the Ground, nor discharge the Du∣ties of his Character. It was the Spirit more than the Mantle of <HI>Elijah</HI> that divided the Wa∣ters.</P>
<P>HE must therefore make it his first care, that the Spirit of God and Glory rests upon him; that he is awfully sensible of the unsported Ho∣liness and Purity of the Divine Majesty; the sacredness of the Character he takes upon him; and the real inward Holiness, and purity of Manners which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>comes those that bear the Vessels of the Sanctuary; and accordingly must be careful to serve the Lord in the holiness all the days of his Life, in the frame and temper of his Mind, in the duties of his Function, and in his whole Conversation.</P>
<P>Again, HE should endeavour after a like Spirit of Humility and Meekness, Sobriety and Gravity, Righteousness and Temperance; ma∣nifesting a low Opinion of himself, without be∣ing abject and servile; be ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, with∣out a trifling Familiarity, which issues in Con∣tempt; be ready to overlook personal Injuries,
<PB N="14" REF="002501_0016_0FDB6803CB0113E0"/>
and condescend to the meanest, and lay aside all Levity without Morosness; always do to others as he would that they should do to him; stand fast in his Christian Liberty, wherein Christ hath made him free, and yet not use his Liberty for an occasion to the Flesh.</P>
<P>Again, HE should endeavour after the same Spirit of Zeal, Courage and Fidelity. He must be zealous for the Lord of Host, even burn with an holy Ardour of Soul, to advance the Name, Interest, and Kingdom of God in the World; and with a fervent Indignation make head against the torrent of Vice and Immora∣lity, which threatens to deluge all Religion, both Name and Thing; and against all Impos∣tors that set up their Altars against Gods Altar, and would lead or force us to enquire of the God of Ekron, instead of the God of Israel. And his Zeal must be well directed, guided by Pru∣dence, and tempered with Moderation; lest while in his pretended Zeal he call for Fire from Heaven, it prove but the result of his own Passion, and a strange Fire before the Lord.</P>
<P>HE must be couragious in the Cause of God, and not fear the face of Man, nor the wrath of a King, his Captains and their Fifties; but boldly, as becometh his Office, speak the Mind of God, declare His Counsels, utter His Warn∣ings, give forth His Orders, bear Testimony against their evil Manners, and reprove the Disorders and Sins of the greatest, the most haughty, wealthy, and Supercillious, as well as the meanest under his Charge; whatsoever God shall command him, that must he speak.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002501_0017_0FDB680548945D88"/>Finally, AND in all he must be Faithful, di∣ligently attending to his Master's Business, and that continually; shewing all good Fidelity, as becomes a Steward in declaring the whole Coun∣sel of God; dealing to every one their Portion in due Season, instructing the Ignorant, con∣vincing Gainsayers, strengthening the Weak and Feeble, comforting the Disconsolate, resolving the Doubting, recovering the Wandring, cen∣suring the Incorrigible, extending his Care to the poorest Lamb in his Flock, as well as the fattest and well-fleeced Sheep, and in all things doing nothing by partiality.</P>
<P>THUS should those whom God raises up to sustain the Character of His Ministers, tread in the Steps, and be acted by the same Spirit which they see in their venerable Fathers in the sacred Order.</P>
<P>Once more;</P>
<P><HI>AND he said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah?</HI> It argues his entire Dependance upon God for Assistance to the discharge of the Duties, and for the success and rewards of his Office.</P>
<P>HE takes the Mantle, lifts it up, but smites not till he had called upon <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God, to be with him, as He had been with <HI>Elijah.</HI> So he humbly and earnestly asks the fulfilment of his Master's Promise, that a double portion of his Spirit should rest upon him.</P>
<P>NOT the Spirit essential to him as a Man; this was impossible: <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Soul was gone a∣way into the heavenly World. Nor the Spirit and Temper that was accidental to him, arising from his Constitution, and temperament of Bo∣dy;
<PB N="16" REF="002501_0018_0FDB680CCE01B568"/>
this was insufficient: but the Spirit of God that rested upon <HI>Elijah</HI>▪ and by His powerful In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luences carried him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his Work▪ wrought so mightily in him, and by which also he as∣cended. This is the great Request.</P>
<P>THE Words therefore are a Prayer. That <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God would be with him▪ authorise him to his Work, prosper him therein, and reward him.</P>

Elijah</HI> was a Man of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, sacred to Him, by his Character and Station, as His Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Minister; and <HI>Eli∣sha</HI> being about to enter upon the same Office, calls upon <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God to derive all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Pow∣ers, Qualifications, Virtues and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aces, Assist∣ance and Success, to him▪ which He had fa∣voured <HI>Elijah</HI> with: by which he also might become a Man of God.</P>
<P>ALL of the ministerial Function, whether extraordinary, as the Prophets and Apostles, or o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dinary, as the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> under the Law, and the Ministers of Religion in the Days of the Gospel, flows originally from God; but mediately thro' the Lord Jesus Christ the Head of the Church, who having ascended up on high has received such Gifts, that He might be∣stow them upon Men: <HI>Not of Man, nor by Man, but by Iesus Christ, and God the Father, Gal.</HI> I.1.</P>
<P>Thus,</P>
<P N="1">1. ALL the ministerial <HI>Powers, Authority, and Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fications</HI> are from God.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002501_0019_0FDB680E4FD65628"/>THE ministerial <HI>Order</HI> it self is from God, who hath appointed it in the World▪ even from the beginning of Time to the end thereof. But of this we have said eno' already.</P>
<P>THUS, they derive their <HI>Commission,</HI> Power and Authority from God. They are God's Ministers, appointed by Him to this very End; and who should empower them, vest them with Authority, and give them a Commission to act in that sacred Office of His Ministers, but that God alone, who hath designed them thereunto. <HI>For no man taketh</HI> (ought or may take) <HI>this honour to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</HI> Heb. V.4 God of old more immediately seperated the Family of <HI>Aaron,</HI> and the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> to the Priesthood; and in like immediate manner raised up, commissioned and inspired His ancient Prophets; and so too Jesus Christ His Son immediately called and au∣thorised His Apostles, and sent them forth to evangelize the World; yet this hinders not but that the same God and Saviour does now em∣power (tho' in a more mediate way) all that are regularly invested with the ministerial Au∣thority.</P>
<P>FOR how shall they go, unless they are sent? and who should send them but God? Tho' they derive their Authority now more mediate∣ly, yet is it nevertheless from the Original and Fountain thereof: whatever allowed Channel it passes thro', it still flows from the original Head.</P>
<P>NOR need we to lay any great stress upon a lineal uninterrupted Succession from the Apo∣stles,
<PB N="18" REF="002501_0020_0FDB68120B6F69F8"/>
the immediate Followers of our Lord; which seems not absolutely
<Q>necessary on the one hand, nor alone sufficient on the other:</Q>
But God furnishes Men for His Service, dispo∣ses them to engage in His Work, opens the Door to them, and fixes them in their Office, by those who have already received a Power from Him to convey ministerial Betrustments to them.</P>
<P>AND thus, God qualifies for the work of the Ministry. From Him comes all Gifts and En∣dowments of the Mind, both <HI>natural, acquired,</HI> and <HI>spiritual.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS He that furnishes Men with their vari∣ous natural Powers and Capacities of Mind <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b XXXII.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Exod.</HI> XXXVI 1.</NOTE>; and of Him is all their sufficiency to Think or Speak, who prepareth the Heart, and giveth the Answer of the Tongue <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> XVI.12</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM Him too is derived the <HI>Tongue of the learned,</HI> who 'tis assists and strengthens the Powers of the Mind, by Study and Labour, Reading and Meditation, to attain to the vari∣ous degrees of good Literature which He sees meet for them. And as there were of old the <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">As at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Bethel,</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Schools of the Prophets, where the Youth were trained up in those Exercises which pre∣pared the way for their after Serviceableness; so now is the same Care and Pains requisite for the fitting of Youth for future Service in the Church of God, and indeed so much the more now, by how much, under the present Circum∣stances
<PB N="19" REF="002501_0021_0FDB681391C62BC0"/>
of the World,
<Q>an unlearned Ministry would scarce be able to produce sufficient Credentials to their being sent of God.</Q></P>
<P>AND from God are they endowed with that <HI>spiritual</HI> Wisdom, and Understanding in Divine Things, and those measures and degrees of Grace, which are necessary to render them faithful, and able Ministers of the New Testa∣ment. Hence says the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> XII.4. <HI>There are diversities of Gifts,</HI> which he reckons up,— and adds upon them, v.11. <HI>But all of these worketh that one and self same Spirit, dividing to every Man severally as He will.</HI></P>
<P>THUS 'tis God that spirits and inclines them to undertake so heavy a Charge. When they consider the Majesty of the Person whom they are to represent, the sacredness of the Character they are to sustain, the weight of the Task they are to undergo, and the Difficulties they are to encounter with in their way; well may they be ready to shrink back, and cry out who is sufficient for these things; Lord I am but a Child and cannot speak. But God over-rules their Spirits, moves their Inclinations, presses them into His Service, thrusts them forth into His Harvest, and says to them, as to <HI>Ieremiah, Ier.</HI> I.7. <HI>But thou shalt go to all that I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thee; and all that I command thee, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> speak.</HI> When God thus calls them, commands them, and moves their Hearts, they say with Samuel <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> III.10.</NOTE>, <HI>Speak Lord, for thy Servant beareth,</HI> and with <HI>Isa∣iah</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> VI.8.</NOTE>, <HI>Here am I, send me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002501_0022_0FDB681513AB7DF0"/>THUS again, God opens the Door for them, shews them what part of the Vineyard they are to labour in, and acquaints them with their se∣veral Duties. He moves the Hearts of a Peo∣ple to invite them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ying to them as the <HI>Mace∣donians</HI> to <HI>Paul, Act.</HI> XVI.9. <HI>Come over, and help us.</HI> He has appointed to every one their Station, marked out their Work, and shewn them what He requires of them.</P>
<P>FINALLY, From God they derive all their Strength and Ability, to perform their Duties, and bear up under their Burdens. He inspires them with a zeal for the Honour of His Name; fills them with a tender Compassion for immor∣tal Souls; helps them in their Labours Night and Day, in their Studies, Prayers, and Cares.</P>
<P>'TIS the presence of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God with <HI>Eli∣sha</HI> enables him to wade thro' the River▪ and overcome the Difficulties in his way; to bear Reproaches and cruel Mockings, and preserves him in the midst of Perils and Dangers. And if they are sent upon <HI>Isaiah</HI>'s Message, to har∣den Hearts, and blind Eyes, and are made to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oan under the melancholy prospect, that they labour in vain, and spend their Strength for nought; how would their Hearts utterly fail them, and their Spirits be dried up like a Pot∣sherd, and they go mourning under the heavy Pressure? did not the Lord sustain them.</P>
<P N="2">2. FROM God flows all the <HI>Success</HI> of their Ministry. What are we? but earthen Vessels, to whom it hath pleased the Lord to commit His Treasure, that the Power may more evi∣dently appear to be of God,</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002501_0023_0FDB681869821940"/>IN vain will the Waters be smitten; <HI>Elisha</HI>'s Arm, and <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Mantle, the best Accomplish∣ments and the highest Character will not be sufficient to part the Stream, unless <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God be present. Man speaketh only to the hearing of the Ear, but God to the Heart. He causeth our Doctrine to drop as the Rain, and our Speech to distil as the Dew, as the Rain and Snow from Heaven, which accomplisheth the End for which it was sent. He maketh the Word preached to become the Power of God unto the Salvation of all them that believe. At His Commandment we spread the Nets of Sal∣vation, and He fills them more or less, as pleas∣eth Him. For a <HI>Paul may plant, and Apollos wa∣ter; but God only giveth the increase.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> III.6, 7.</P>
<P N="3">3. And lastly; FROM God they receive the <HI>Rewards</HI> of their Fidelity to His Service.
For He <Q>will not keep back the Hire of His Labourers, that have reaped down His Corn;</Q>
but He will certainly distribute to every Man his Peny, when they shall rest from their Labours; their Work (the Rewards of it) shall follow them. He will overlook the Frailties and Infirmities of his faithful Ministers, blot out their Trans∣gressions, and say to them, Well done good and faithful Servants, enter into the Joy of your Lord. And tho' they may not ascend with equal Triumph, yet they shall with equal Safe∣ty with <HI>Elijah,</HI> into the Heavens prepared for them.</P>
<P>THE greater too their Labours have been, the heavier their Burdens, the more their Suf∣ferings
<PB N="22" REF="002501_0024_0FDB681A4C3B5CE8"/>
in the Cause of God, so much the more glorious shall be their Reward; for one Star differs from another in Glory.</P>
<P>YEA, tho' <HI>Israel</HI> be not gathered by their Means, yet shall they be glorious in the Eyes of the Lord; whether the People will hear, or whether they will forbear, they shall be a sweet Savour unto God, who accepteth them, not ac∣cording to their Success, but their Fidelity: And when Christ the chief Shepherd shall appear, then shall they also appear with Him in Glo∣ry.</P>
<P>N. II. I should pass to a second Observation upon <HI>Elisha</HI>'s saying, <HI>Where is the Lord God of Elijah</HI>? viz.</P>
<P>THAT 'tis the Duty of those that are en∣tring upon the Ministry to pray, that the God of their venerable Fathers would be with them also. But all that has been said under the for∣mer Observation▪ and much more that might be added to it, are strong Arguments to enforce this Duty; for since they are to derive their Power, Qualifications, Success and Rewards, from God only, to whom th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n should they go, but to Him only therefor? and this necessarily leads them to give themselves unto Prayer, as well as to Reading and Meditation, that they may answer the great Ends of the Gospel Mi∣nistry. This is so obvious, that I need to say no more upon this head; but hasten to make a few Reflections upon what has been said, by way of Application.</P>
<P N="1">I. HENCE learn what abundant Cause there is for <HI>Thankfulness</HI> to God. Does God take care
<PB N="23" REF="002501_0025_0FDB681BCEFAEA48"/>
of, and furnish His Church with His Ministers, to break the bread of Life unto His People, sure∣ly then they that are thus favoured of the Lord, are under strong Bonds of Gratitude, to present their thankful Acknowledgments to God, for His compassionate Regards to them herein.</P>
<P>THE Ministers of the Lord, faithful to Him, to the common Interest of Religion, and the im∣mortal Souls of their People▪ are a great Blessing wherever they are; and so God intends them, by bestowing them upon a People. How soon else would a Land be over-run, not only with Atheism, and Infidelity, which would necessari∣ly involve them under everlasting Miseries, for where the Vision faileth, the People perish <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> XXIX.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>; but even all manner of Barbarities, Rudeness, and ill Manners, which would soon strip a Peo∣ple of their outward visible Glory, and lay wast all their pleasant Enjoyments.</P>
<P>BUT has God, in His abundant Goodness, and care of a People, furnished them with full Supplies of so rich a Blessing, as His Gospel Ministers? surely then His Saints should shout aloud for Joy; He hath not dealt so with every Nation, prais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Lord <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal▪</HI> CXLVII.20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>REMEMBER, Unthankfulness for such a Mercy will be found very provoking to God, and prove the most dangerous Method to strip you of so great a Blessing.</P>
<P N="2">II. HENCE then a People may learn their Duty to their Ministers▪ If the ministerial Or∣der be of Divine Appointment, and they that
<PB N="24" REF="002501_0026_0FDB681D7872A348"/>
are in it derive their Authority, and all that be∣longs to it from God, this plainly speaks the Duty of their People to them, and that in se∣veral respects. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS shews, That you ought to give a <HI>constant and diligent Attendance</HI> upon their holy Ministration. For does God send His Mini∣sters to you, to declare His Message, and in His Name to warn you of your Danger, and shew you the true way to Life and Happiness? then I am sure it concerns you to give the most con∣stant and diligent Attendance upon their Mi∣nistry. Are they, not to neglect the Gift that is in them, but to be instant in Season and out of Season, to preach the Word, rebuke, exhort, with all long suffering and Doctrine? And is it not equally your Duty readily and chearful∣ly, with Seriousness and Devotion, to attend to all that Doctrine, Reproof and Exhortation, which they bring unto you, not in their own, but in the Name of their and your great Lord and Master?</P>
<P>WHEREFORE forsake not the assembling of your selves together, as the manner of some is, who are ready to think a very slight matter, such as would scarce keep them from going as far to gain <HI>three pence,</HI> a sufficient Excuse for their staying away from the House and Wor∣ship of God. Is this the Reverence you owe to God▪ to His Word, to His Ordinances, and to the Embassadors of Jesus Christ? Remember, God demands it of you, to receive the Law at the Priests Lips <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mal.</HI> II.7.</NOTE>, and He will demand it of
<PB N="25" REF="002501_0027_0FDB682172B95DE8"/>
you an other Day, how you dared to turn your Backs upon His Embassadors.</P>
<P>LET nothing therefore, but Necessity de∣tain you from the House of God; and while you are there, give diligent heed to the things that are spoken to you in the Name of the Lord. Come not into this sacred Place, to al∣low your selves in Sleep, or to carp at the Prea∣cher, much less to sport and drol upon the Word spoken to you; and ever esteem it, as you one day will, but the lees of Wit, which is the greatest Folly, to ridicule the Minister of the Lord, and the Message he brings to you in his Masters Name.</P>
<P>BORE your Ears to the Posts of Wisdom's Gate, as having purposed to dwell in the House of the Lord so long as your Days shall be, and open them wide to receive the Instructions of the Word, that you may be made wise unto Sal∣vation. Hear as not knowing but it may be the last time you may ever be spoken to in the Name of the Lord.</P>
<P>HOW any can pretend Conscience, in their utter refusal to attend upon the authorised Mi∣nisters of God delivering His Message, is be∣yond my Skill to see the Reason of; and no wonder if they are forced, first to deny even the sacred Institution, and then deny all Ordinan∣ces, to support their Practice; but with what face, or pretence to Christianity, I know not. My Soul, come not thou into their Secret, with their Assembly mine Honour, be not thou uni∣ted.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002501_0028_0FDB6822931E8FD0"/>SURE I am, that the Gospel Ministry and Ordinances, are of Divine Appointment, and they that neglect them, do it at their utmost p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ril. Wherefore, remember the Words of Christ, <HI>Luke</HI> X 16. <HI>He that beareth you, beareth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me.</HI> And, <HI>Mat.</HI> X.14, 15. <HI>Whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your Words,— it shall be more tolerable for the Land of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>morrah, in the day of Iudgment, than for that City.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THIS shews, That you ought to <HI>submit</HI> your selves to their ministerial <HI>Teaching and Go∣vernment.</HI> For if they are the Ministers of the Lord, then ought you to submit your selves to them, as unto the Lord.</P>
<P>THEY come to you, not in their own Name, they claim no civil Autority over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou, no tem∣poral Jurisdiction over your Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, nor de∣mand any Obedience and Submissi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to their own Laws; but they come to you in the Name, with the Authority, and at the Commandment of the great God, who sends them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth, to de∣mand Obedience to His Laws: And therefore their Commission is to be acknowledged, and their Inst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uctions complied with.</P>
<P>WHILE we preach to you, not ourselves, but Jesus Christ the Lord, we demand it of you in His Name, and at your Peril, that you not on∣ly hear us, but that you obey us.</P>
<P>SEARCH the Scriptures, and see, if what we decl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re unto you is not agreeable to the Mind of God: If it be not, then reject what we say, and regard it not; but if we only de∣liver our Lords Errand, if we declare only His
<PB N="27" REF="002501_0029_0FDB682409A61F90"/>
Counsel, and publish His Royal Will, then surely it concerns you to be the doers of the Word, and not the hearers only; then ought you to believe what we speak to you, to prac∣tice all the Duties we req<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire of you, and to a∣void all the Sins which we forbid unto you, in the Name of that Lord, whose Servants we are. For this is the true Character of a religious People, <HI>That they have obeyed from the Heart, the form of sound Doctrine, which has been delivered to them.</HI> Rom. VI.17.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all, you must also submit your selves to the Rule and Government of your Ministers. Not that they are Lords of the He∣ritage, or have dominion over your Faith, but they are the helpers of your Joy. Their ministe∣rial Watch, Guidance and Discipline, as Stew∣ards in the House of God, entrusted with the Keys, and Treasures thereof, must be duly ac∣knowledged, and submitted to: For thus you are called upon, <HI>Heb.</HI> XIII.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and submit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> selves to them, for they watch for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Souls, as they that must give an Account, that they may do it with Ioy, and not with Grief, for this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for you.</HI> Without this acknowledgement of, and submission to them, however humanely you may entertain them, you do not receive them as be∣cometh Christians.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS shews, That you o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght to bear a high <HI>Veneration, Esteem, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> for your Mi∣nister. For if he receive his Authority and Of∣fice from God, if he is to minister in holy things, to consult your best Interest, and aim at your
<PB N="28" REF="002501_0030_0FDB68289F23C958"/>
eternal Salvation▪ then su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely he deserves an in∣terest in your Affections, and ought to be high∣ly valued and reverenced by you.</P>
<P>'TIS true, he is but a Man, subject to like Passions with you: so <HI>Elijah</HI> was, and lia∣ble to Infirmities; God treateth not with you now by the Ministration of Angels, but by a Man, your f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow Creature, and 'tis His great Condescention and Goodness, that He does so; you are not therefore to look for Perfection in him▪ but to overlook his humane Weaknesses, and cast a Mantle over his Infirmities. You are to consider him, not so much what he is in himself, liable to Frailties and humane Infirmi∣ties; but what he is in his Character, the Stati∣on God has placed him in, and the Power He has invested him with, as your Minister; and while it is his care to live up, in some good mea∣sure, to his Character, to discharge the Duties of his Post, and exert his Authority, for the ad∣vancement of his Masters Glory, and your best Good▪ you ought to maintain a just Veneration and Esteem for him.</P>
<P>BRETHREN, We mean not by this to as∣sume great Titles to our selves, and big swelling Words of Vanity; but <HI>we beseech you to know them which l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur among you, and are over you in the Lord, and esteem them very highly in love, for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sake.</HI> 1 Thess. V.12, 13. Know them to be but Men, and as such▪ pity their Weaknesses▪ bear with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Infirmities, put the best Con∣struction upon their Actions, and overlook their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>railties; but know them also, in their sacred Character, to be over you in the Lord, and so
<PB N="29" REF="002501_0031_0FDB682B8BB58B18"/>
hold them in Reputation, and let them have a room in your good Affections, at least for their Works sake. If you do not give a good Enter∣tainment to them in your Affections, if you do not uphold a venerable Opinion of them, and sincerely love them, it will be very unlikely, next to impossible, that you should receive the benefit of their holy Ministration.</P>
<P>THEIR Office is high and honourable, in the sight of God, their Commission more im∣mediately from God, than any temporal Rulers, and therefore when they are placed as at the Feet of the People, are contemned and reviled, and Terms of Disgrace and Reproach are fasten∣ed upon them, God will resent the Indignity done to His Ambassadors, as in some sort done to Himself; he that despiseth you despiseth me. Remember the Children that mocked <HI>Elisha.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THIS shews, That they ought <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly to be supported.</HI> For if they are God's Ministers, appointed by Him, to this very Service, and are to attend continually hereunto, then ought you to take care that they are well provided for, and comfortably supported in their Labours. <HI>Count those worthy of double honour that rule well, especially they who labour in the Word and Doctrine.</HI> (1 Tim. V.17.) Not only your Love and Esteem, but an honourable Maintainance is due unto them.</P>
<P>BRETHREN, We do not ask it as a Fa∣vour, that your Minister be comfortably sup∣ported; no, it is a Debt of Justice due both to God and your own Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="002501_0032_0FDB683112240718"/>I confess it is both irksome and grievous to me▪ as beneath the ministerial Character, and the Duty of a People, that Ministers are ordi∣narily forced to contract with their People, for their Support; or that they should be put upon asking for it: I am sure this ought to be taken care of sufficiently, without the Ministers being concerned about it. For God Himself has pro∣vided for His Ambassadors, to bear their Charge and Expence, and laid the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you to pay it in to them; even <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, unto him that teacheth, in all good things</HI>: Gal. VI.6. <HI>For so hath the Lord ordained, that they which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Gospel, should live of the Gospel.</HI> 1 Cor. IX.14.</P>
<P>AND tho' I don't say, that there ought to be the same Allowance to them, as was to the Levitical Priesthood, under the Law; Yet, sure I am, it is not left to the caprice and humours of any Man, living under the Gospel, whether, or how much he shall contribute towards the Charge of the House and Ordinances of God: But the Minister of the Lord ought to live, (far from a state of want and dependace upon the humours of a People) so as to be an Example to the Flock in Charity and Hospitality.</P>
<P>AND surely they that think to save any thing, by witholding more than is meet, will find their sovereign Lord will highly resent their denying Him His Tribute, and make such Dis∣traints upon them, as will greatly tend to im∣poverish them▪ and keep them low.</P>
<P>YOU owe this Duty, as to God, so to your own Souls; for how can it be expected they should grow fat and flourishing in the House of
<PB N="31" REF="002501_0033_0FDB68324E87ECC8"/>
God, while your Minister shall be kept meager and in straits? Tho' for this we may be re∣proached, with the Term of Hirelings, yet I know who 'tis has said, <HI>The Labourer is worthy of his Hire.</HI> Luke X.7. I might add,</P>
<P N="5">5. THIS shews, That you should do all you can to strengthen and encourage your Minister to his Work. He is God's Minister, but 'tis for your good; and how much then sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld you make it your care, to strengthen his Heart and Hands to his Labour? Many will be his Discouragements, strong his Temptations from within, and he may expect to meet with hatred and opposition from abroad, and therefore will need all the Encouragement you can give him, to keep him from fainting under the heavy load. Let nothing in your Carriage add to the weight, and increase his Griefs upon him; but do what you can to make all sit light and easy, help to bear his Burdens, sympathise with him in his Afflictions, and be not ashamed of any Suffering he may meet with, in the Cause of God, from unreasonable Men; let him see in you the travel of his Soul, the fruit of his La∣bour, you and your Children walking in the Truth; his Joy and Comfort here, and the ear∣nest of his Crown of rejoycing hereafter,</P>
<P N="6">6 To conclude, IF all Help, Assistance and Success flows from God, then he had need <HI>of your Prayers,</HI> as well as his own; that the Lord God of <HI>Elijah</HI> would be with him. His Work will be great and Difficult, and his Shoulders unequal to the Burden, without the Divine As∣sistance; and therefore it concerns you to car∣ry

him in the Arms of your Prayers, and ear∣nestly implore the divine Aids may be afforded to him. The holy Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> with all his Advantages, saw his need of an interest in the peoples Prayers, and therefore once and again urgently demands it of them, as, <HI>Eph.</HI> VI.19. <HI>Praying always,— and for me, that Utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my Mouth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldly, to make known the mystery of the Gospel.</HI> So <HI>Rom.</HI> XV.30. <HI>Now I beseech you, Brethren, for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord Iesus sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gether with me, in your Prayers to God for me.</HI> And again, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> III.1. <HI>Finally, Brethren, pray for me, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I do bespeak your earnest Prayers on my behalf, who stand in the room of my depar∣ted Father; helping together by your Prayers for me▪ without which, how can you expect the Divine Blessing on my Labours among you?</P>
<P>THIS is to be your daily Task, each one for himself, in his Retirement, calling upon the Name of the Lord, to carry your Minister, as he will and does you, in the Arms of your Prayers, earnestly entreating that a double por∣tion of the Spirit of God may rest upon him, more abundantly furnish him with all necessa∣ry Gifts and Graces, own him in his Labours, and crown him with Success; that under his holy Ministry, you may become a truly religi∣ous and happy People, that you may be mutual Comforts to each other, and come together in the fulness of the blessings of the Gospel of Peace.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="33" REF="002501_0035_0FDB68385EADF930"/>3. HENCE when it pleases God to remove any of His Servants, His Ministers from among a People, the departure of such should be duly laid to Heart. Shall an <HI>Elijah,</HI> the Prophet of the God of Israel, be taken away, as our Master from our Head, and the People have no sor∣rowful sense of their Loss therein? Surely God expects it of us, that we lay to heart such aw∣ful Providences, that we see His hand therein, and duly humble our selves under it, and in a sense of our Loss, cry out, as <HI>Elisha</HI> did, v. 12. <HI>My Father, my Father; the Chariot of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof!</HI> Able and faithful Ministers are the beauty and strength of the place where they dwell; they are as Lights to their People, and the Salt of the Earth; their Labours among a People are productive of their best Good, their Example influential to their common Ad∣vantage, their Instructions directive to their true Interest, and their earnest Prayers, and interest in the Court of Heaven, are often the ordinary means of diverting the divine Judgment from falling heavy upon their People, and they as often pull down a Blessing upon them: So that tho' they should live to be past all their other Labours, yet so long as they are capable of in∣terceding at the Throne of Grace for their Peo∣ple, so long they are truly a Blessing to them; and therefore cannot be parted with without sorrowful Reflections.</P>
<P>AND this leads me into the mournful Theme which this day calls for, occasioned by the re∣moval of that Man of God, the Aged, Reverend Mr. <HI>SAMUEL CHEEVER</HI> from among us.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002501_0036_0FDB6839D5F2CA28"/>IT pleased God, from whom comes down every good and perfect Gift, to furnish him for the Work of the Ministry, with no small Abi∣lities, both natural and acquired, being owner of a solid Judgment, a copious Invention, and a tenacious Memory, which were improved in him, by a due application of himself to Read∣ing, Meditation and Prayer.</P>
<P>GOD brought him among you some time in <HI>November,</HI> 1668, from which Time, those of you that are advanced in Years, know how much he has been a common Father to the whole Town, in the many temporal Advanta∣ges which you have received from him; he truly went about doing good, and serving you in all your Interests.</P>
<P>BUT as preaching is peculiarly the Ministers Work, so he was well fitted herefor, by an un∣common Knowledge in the holy Scripture, be∣ing an excellent Text-man, and carrying a Bo∣dy of Divinity in his Head, which he would often say to me, it was good for a Divine to be well fornished withal.</P>
<P>IN his publick Discourses to you, he endea∣voured to preserve the truth, purity, and sim∣plicity of the Gospel, teaching you the Truth as it is in Jesus: He made it his great care to shew you your Sin, and Danger, and where your only Remedy lies; that you might be di∣rected to flee from the wrath to come, and lay hold on the Hope set before you. And as he aimed at the winning of Souls to his great Ma∣ster, so he sought not to pleass your Fancy, and tickle your Ears with studied Elocution and
<PB N="35" REF="002501_0037_0FDB683CEBF883F8"/>
formal Periods, but delivered the Mind of God to you with such plainness, and cogency of Ar∣gument and Perswasion, as becomes the Gospel of Christ; and he shunned not to declare unto you the whole Counsel of God.</P>
<P>AND how fervent was he in treating with your immortal Souls, delivering himself to you with that flame and heat, that earnestness and vigour as well shewed his sincere Zeal in his Master's Service, and his hearty desire that you all might be saved: He plainly shewed the live∣ly Impressions of the Truths he preached to you, upon his own Heart, while the fervency of his Voice pierced your Ears, that the united Light and Heat might strike the more forcibly upon your Minds, and gain the more ready Compli∣ance with the great Truths that were delivered to you.</P>
<P>AND he was as constant and assiduous as fervent and zealous a Preacher of the Word of God among you; so that, if I mistake not, from his first coming among you, until the time that Age had worn him out, you never were, more than once, without the constant Entertainments of your Sabbaths, your stated Feasts, and your New Moons; tho' he was alone for about 48 Years: God so graciously confirmed his Health, that for more than 50 Years, he never was hin∣dred from coming to you in the Name of the Lord by any Sickness.</P>
<P>INDEED the infirmities of Age obliged him to take leave of his publick stated Exercises in <HI>October</HI> 1719. which he did from those Words of our Saviour, <HI>Iohn</HI> IX.4. <HI>I must work the
<PB N="36" REF="002501_0038_0FDB683E4BC4B5E8"/>
works of him that sent me, while it is day; the night c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth when no man can work.</HI> And yet about a Year after this, upon a special Occasion, he en∣tertained us with a short, but plain and fervent Excitement, to be <HI>zealous of go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Works.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE his strength and vigour continued, he was a very just and methodical Preacher, (and doubtless had he been fixed in a politer Place, he would have made a brighter Figure) tho' in his latter days, he gave more into an expository way of treating the several Texts that occurred in his preaching: and to the last he could make no publick use of Notes, but de∣livered all memoriter.</P>
<P>AND yet after Age had laid him aside from publick Labour, he was still at his Work, and his Mind so intensly set upon it, that I scarce ever came into his Company at any time, with∣out finding him at his Study, or his Mind taken up with the publick Duties of the Sabbath, and he would be continually expressing his concern, lest he should not be able to do any thing of it, and desiring me to prepare for all the Day, lest he should not be able to come out; which plain∣ly shewed the hearty Delight he took in his Work.</P>
<P>HE was a Man of Peace, of a catholick Mind, and extensive Philanthropy and good Will to all Men, without confining Religion to a particu∣lar Sect; a great Peace-maker among his con∣tending Neighbours, and never made, or excited Parties, or so much as joined himself to any, (that I can learn) but those that were for God and Religion, against Vice and Immorality.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="002501_0039_0FDB6840A4B9FA40"/>HIS Conversation was grave, yet pleasant, suitable to a steady composure of Mind, which he usually enjoyed; tho' at proper Seasons, he knew how to be warm.</P>
<P>HIS Life among you has been the Life of a Christian, and the whole tenour of it a mani∣festing an entire Submission to, and Satisfaction in the disposing Providence of God; and you your selves are Witnesses how holily and un∣blameably he hath behaved himself, walking before you in the paths of serious Godliness; a plain and a humble Man.</P>
<P>WHEN you called me to the pastoral Office, with him, a few Years ago, tho' his own De∣light in the work of the Lord among you, made him not so forward as some might have expect∣ed, to have an Assistant joined with him, yet he evidenced to you an entire Satisfaction in your Proceedings; and I have cause to ac∣knowledge the goodness of God to me herein, that as a Son with a Father, so he received me, repeating the Words of good old <HI>Simeon,</HI> upon his return to his House from my publick Ordination, <HI>Now, Lord, lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a signal and uncommon Favour of God to him▪ that tho' he lived to the Age of fourscore and almost five, yet he had so settled a Constitution, and firm a Health, as to be able to say, that he never was Sick in all his Life;
<PB N="38" REF="002501_0040_0FDB67CB93542A78"/>
a days Indisposition, and some small touches of the Sciatica, he has sometimes known: And as his Health was firm, so at upwards of fourscore, he could read without the help of Spectacles, and had his Hearing quick as Youth, to the last week of his Life; but the Powers of his Mind, for some few Years before he died, failed, especially his Memory, whereby he was greatly unfitted even for common Conversati∣on; and yet his constant Family Prayers were orderly, and regular; so did Grace shine in the decays of Nature.</P>
<P>AND while the decays of Age laid him by from publick Service, how exemplarily Pati∣ent was he under such a Rebuke? He would often say to me,
<Q>Age is too heavy for me, but I must bear it; I can't die when I would, I must patiently wait God's Time, my Times are in His Hands, I rejoice to see that God has provided for His People before I go; God has satisfied me with long Life—.</Q></P>
<P>THUS continued he at Work, and pati∣ently submitting to the Will of God, till a few days ago his Senses wholly left him, and the Night before last he died, and truly died; his Lamp of Life fairly burning out, without b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing put out; for he felt no Sickness nor Pain to the last, nor shewed any the least tokens of them even in his expiring Moments.</P>
<P>SO, while by the Grace of Christ in him, he was secured against the Terrours of the se∣cond
<PB N="39" REF="002501_0041_0FDB68468A9238F8"/>
Death, thro' the Favour of God to him, he knew nothing of the usual ghastly Harbin∣gers, nor the shocking Terrours of a natural Death; but as he was always calm, and easy, in the possession of a comfortable Hope, with∣out strong emotions of Joy, or the distress of of anxious Fears, so he quietly fell asleep in Jesus, and is gone to receive the Rewards of his long and faithful Services.</P>
<P>I will only add, that the little Time I have had, will sufficiently apologize, that I have given no better Account of this aged, and faith∣ful Servant of Jesus Christ; and yet such as it is, I know his humble modest Tho'ts of himself, would not have been easily prevailed upon to have allowed it; for I well remember, that a∣bout a Month or two ago, upon my asking him a Question, which he happened to mis∣understand, he replied to me, with some warmth,
<Q>Prithee, don't go about to flatter me; 'tis eno' that I stand to my own Ma∣ster; my greatest care is to be accepted of him.</Q></P>
<P>AND now may the God of all Grace and Consolation, afford his most compassionate Re∣gards, unto the devout and meek Hand-maid of the Lord, who has been the Companion of his Days for about fifty four Years; comfort her under her Sorrows, and give unto her an happy and endless meeting with him in Glory.</P>
<P>MAY God be a Father unto the mourning Children, and more abundantly enrich them
<PB N="40" REF="002501_0042_0FDB684D33212C20"/>
with the Blessings of Goodness, and return into their Bosome the many Prayers their ascended Father hath laid out for them.</P>
<P>MAY God take care of this bereaved Town, and Flock of His, and always shower down of the Gifts and Graces of His Spirit upon it; and especially may I take hold of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Man∣tle, and say, <HI>Let a double <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spirit rest upon me.</HI></P>
<P>MY Brethren, call to Mind the Things which you have heretofore heard and learned, from your deceased Pastor, and so let aged <HI>Sa∣muel,</HI> now dead, yet speak unto you; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e you followers of him, wherein he followed <HI>Christ</HI>: And may God reward your Kindness▪ and the good Will of the Town, in the Sup∣port, which to their Honour, they have conti∣nued to afford to him, notwithstanding his being called off from publick Usefulness for some Years pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</P>
<P>NOW make your earnest and daily Prayers for your surviving <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> that he may be strengthened to his Work, and succeeded there∣in.</P>
<P>AND let it be the care of us all so to live, that we may die in Peace, like him that is now gone before us; that when our Dust returns to its Dust, our Spirits may ascend to the Lord God of <HI>Elijah</HI>; that we and our departed <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> may have a happy meeting at the Right
