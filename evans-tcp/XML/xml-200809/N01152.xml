<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE that have been Eminent Refor∣mers in the Church of God, have seldom or never been so happy, as to Effect a perfect Reformation. <HI>Asa</HI> reformed ma∣ny things, <HI>But the high places were not taken away,</HI> 2 Chron. 15. 17. And tho' it is said of <HI>Jehoshaphat.</HI> that <HI>he took away the high places out of Ju∣dah,</HI> 2 Chron. 17. 6. Yet, <HI>Chap.</HI> 20. <HI>v.</HI> 33 it is noted, that in the latter end of his Reign, <HI>That the high places were not taken away:</HI> the meaning is, that he did take them away in part, yet did not perfectly effect it. Corruption is wont to creep upon the Church by degrees, and Reformation is not effected at once. Sometimes when those things that are more gross are taken away, some lesser Corruptions are retain∣ed: and sometimes when men go from one extream, they don't stop where they should, but trespass on the other hand. This comes to pass, partly through the dim-sighredness of men: when many Corrupti∣ons are grown up in the Church, it must be a work of Time to make a discovery of them; those that discern some, are not suspicious of others; when the Church is much corrupted, it is a time of darkness, and Errors do not lye open to Observation. Partly it comes to pass through the perversness, and stub∣borness of People, who are backward to turn out of those ways that they have been naturalized unto: that is given as the reason why the High places were not taken away, because <HI>the People had not prepared their heart to the Lord God of their Fathers,</HI> 2 Chron. 20. 22.</P>
<P><PB REF="001372_0003_0FB292C8548D98C0"/>
There have been three remarkeable Instances in these later Ages of the imperfect accomplishment of the work of Reformation.</P>
<P><HI>Lucher</HI> was an instrument in the hand of God to open a door of deliverance from <HI>Popery:</HI> and he did with abundance of Evidence, make a discovery of a Multitude of Abominations in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet was so unhappy as to fall into that corrupt Opini∣on of <HI>Consubstantiation.</HI></P>
<P>The glorious Reformers of our Nation in the dayes of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, went beyond <HI>Luther</HI> in the work of Reformation, and yet even that glorious Re∣formation was very imperfect, and wanting in many things to be mended by the Church in Succeeding Ages: And those holy men who first planted this Land, carryed on the work of Reformation to an higher pitch, yet failed in several things; especially in two points, <HI>viz.</HI> in not accepting Non-scandalous Persons into their Communion; and in not acknow∣ledging a Publick Government in the Church.</P>
<P>And such is the misery of the Church of God that the mistakes of those worthy men, who have led in the work of Reformation, do prove an invincible temptation to many men. As the Renown of those Reformers is a bulwark against those Errors that were Exploded by them, so we find our selves embarrassed by their mistakes from proceeding in the work of Reformation: As if it were criminal not to mistake with them.</P>
<P>It may possibly be a fault and an aggravation of a fault, to depart from the ways of our Fathers; but it may also be a vertue, and an eminent act of Obedi∣ence to depart from them in some things. Men are wont to make a great noise, that we are bringing in of Innovations, and depart from the Old Way: But it is beyond me to find out wherein the iniquity does
<PB REF="001372_0004_0FB292C9D46786A8"/>lye. We may see cause to alter some practises of our Fathers, without despising of them, without priding our selves in our own Wisdom, without Apostacy, without abusing the advantages that God has given us, without a spirit of compliance with corrupt men, without inclinations to Superstition, without making disturbance in the Church of God: And there is no reason that it should be turned as a reproach upon us.</P>
<P>Surely it is commendable for us to Examine the practises of our Fathers; we have no sufficient reason to take practises upon trust from them: let them have as high a character as belongs to them, yet we may not look upon their principles as Oracles. <HI>Nathan</HI> himself missed it in his conjecture about building the house of God: He that believes principles, because they affirm them, makes Idols of them: and it would be no humility, but baseness of spirit, for us to judge our selves uncapable, to Examine the principles that have been handed down to us: If we be any ways fit to open the Mysteries of the Gospel, we are capable to judge of these matters: And it would ill become us so to indulge our selves in ease, as to neglect the Ex∣amination of received principles. If the practises of our Fathers in any particulars were mistakes, it is fit they should be rejected, if they be not, they will bear Examination: If we be forbidden to Examine their practises, that will cut off all hopes of Reformation.</P>
<P>The design of the following Discourse, is to Exa∣mine One practise of these Churches, which is thought to be a failing. It was not composed on a design to be made thus Publick: but the importuni∣ty of some Gentlemen who heard it, has prevailed for the Printing of it.</P>
<P>All that I request of the Reader is, That he do not act like those who told the Prophet: Jer. 44. 16. <HI>A for the word which thou hast Spoken to us in the Name <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="page cropped" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and we will not hearken to thee.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Inexcusableness OF NEGLECTING THE Worship of GOD, under a pretence of being in an Unconverted Condition.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Exodus XII. 47, 48.</BIBL>
<Q>All the Congregation of Israel shall keep it. And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the Lord, let all his Males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it: and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no un∣circumcised person shall eat thereof.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter we have the Institution of the Passover, and the several Laws and Ordinances, that were to be attend∣ed in the celebration of it. Two of which are set down in these Verses: First, <HI>v.</HI> 47. <HI>All the Congregation of Israel shall keep it.</HI> This must be understood with its excepti∣ons.
<PB N="2" REF="001372_0006_0FB292CCDAF0BA80"/>Those that were Unclean, were not to keep it until they were cleansed: <HI>Numb.</HI> 9. 13. <HI>The man that is clean &amp; is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from his People.</HI> Another exception was of the Females: Women were not bound to go to the place which God should choose, where the Passover was to be kept: <HI>Exod.</HI> 23. 17. <HI>Three times in the year shall all thy Males ap∣pear before the Lord God.</HI> Yet when they were present they were bound to keep it. <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 4. <HI>If the household be too little for the Lamb, let him &amp; his neighbour next unto his house, take it according to the number of the souls.</HI> Most probably also, they that were cut off from their People by a sen∣tence of Excommunication, were not to keep it. Secondly, <HI>v.</HI> 48. The stranger is allowed to keep it upon two conditions. (1) That he did desire it. Sometimes strangers that dwelt among them, became proselites and did desire to keep this Ordinance as they were not to be com∣pelled, so they were not to be rejected, if they desired it in an orderly way. (2) That all his Males were circumcised. Circumcision was a token of God's Covenant, when they were cir∣cumcised, they were incorporated, and became as those, who were born in the Land, and en∣joyed equal priviledges with natural Israelites.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> to be spoken to, is, 
<PB N="3" REF="001372_0007_0FB292CE48CA59D8"/>
That Sanctifying Grace is not necessary unto the Law∣full attending of any duty of Worship.</P>
<P>The whole Congregation whether sincerely Godly or not, were to keep the Passover: Sancti∣fying Grace is an inestimable blessing, far be∣yond all the common gifts of the Spirit; it is the very Life of the Soul, it fus it to serve God &amp; to enjoy communion with him; and Sanctifying Grace is necessary to Salvation: without holi∣ness no man can see the face of God: Yea, Sanctifying Grace is necessary to the accepta∣ble attendance of every duty of Worship; if men were not holy their offerings were not ac∣ceptable, nor their Sacrifices sweet to God: but Sanctifying Grace is not necessary to the law∣ful attending of any duty of Worship: if men be not holy, yet it is lawful for them to attend any duty of Worship: No duty of Worship is forbidden to men, because they are destitute of Sanctifying Grace. From the beginning of the World to this day, Men were never forbidden any duty of Worship, for want of Sanctifying Grace. Sanctifying Grace is necessary unto the right discharge of moral duties, as well as in∣stituted: but it is not necessary unto the lawful attending of Moral duties, or the lawful at∣tending of Instituted duties; and as men may not excuse themselves from moral duties from the want of Grace, so they may not excuse themselves from any duty of Worship.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001372_0008_0FB292CFB8AFDB28"/>
I shall clear up the Truth of this Doctrine by an Induction of particulars.</P>
<P>I. <HI>Sanctifying Grace is not necessary unto the at∣tending of those duties of Worship which are required in all Ages.</HI> There are some duties of Worship that are not peculiar either to the State of the Church in the time of the Old Testament, or of the New, but common to both: and they may be attended by such as are Godly, and such as are not. Men in a natural condition may lawfully attend them; Mens being in a natu∣ral condition is no sufficient pretence for neg∣lecting of them. <HI>As,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Prayer:</HI> Such mens Prayers are an abomi∣nation unto God. <HI>Prov.</HI> 28. 9. <HI>He that turneth a∣way his Ear from hearing the law, even his Prayer shall be abomination;</HI> but yet they are to be performed. It is the duty of all men to Pray to God, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18. 1. <HI>He spake a parable to them to this end that men ought always to pray:</HI> The Pharisees were blamed by Christ for Praying in the Streets, that they might have glory from men, and for making long Prayers for a pretence; but they are not blamed for Praying. Ungodly men are much blamed in Scripture for not Praying: <HI>Psal.</HI> 14. 4. <HI>They call not upon God.</HI> Isai. 43 22. <HI>Thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob.</HI> So men are bla∣med for leaving off Praying: <HI>Job</HI> 27. 10. <HI>Will he always call upon God:</HI> And <HI>chap.</HI> 36. <HI>v.</HI> 13. <HI>They cry not when he bindeth them.</HI> All forts of men are directed to cry to God in their necessities:
<PB N="5" REF="001372_0009_0FB292D1F5011780"/>Sinners are put upon it to cry to God: <HI>Isai.</HI> 55. 6. <HI>Seek ye the Lord while be may be found, cast ye upon him while he is near.</HI> Such as are Ungod∣ly are stirred up to Pray to God for forgiveness: <HI>Act.</HI> 3. 22. <HI>Pray God if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven.</HI> It was the manner of the People of Israel good &amp; bad to Pray: <HI>Luk.</HI> 1. 10. <HI>The whole multitude of the People were Praying with∣out at the time of incense.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hearing of the Word.</HI> Men must assemble themselves on the Sabbath to hear the Word. <HI>Lev.</HI> 23. 3. <HI>The seventh day is a Sabbath of rest an boly convocation.</HI> Ungodly men must do it in order to their Conversion: The Word of God is the Means of Conversion: <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 18. <HI>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.</HI> The word of God teaches men to turn to God: it holds forth Conviction, Warning, Incourage∣ment &amp; Direction. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. 14. <HI>How shall they believe on him, of whom they have not heard.</HI> The word of God is the means of Regeneration: <HI>Psal.</HI> 19. 7. <HI>The law of the Lord is perfect Conver∣ting the Soul.</HI> Therefore Ministers must Preach the Word to all sorts of men, good &amp; bad, Christ Preached to the Multitude, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 1, 2. So did John the Baptist, so the Apostles: And it is spoken of as a very bad thing for men to withdraw them∣selves from the assemblies of the People of God: <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 25. Yea it is lawful to Preach the word of God to the Heathen: there was a tempora∣ry command to the Disciples, that they should
<PB N="6" REF="001372_0010_0FB292DA3892FC88"/><HI>not go into the way of the Gentiles, Mat.</HI> 10. 5. But afterward they were commanded, to <HI>teach all Nations, Mat.</HI> 28. 19. And go into all the world and Preach the Gospel to every Creature; and if it be lawful to Preach to them, it is lawful for them to hear it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Preaching of the Word: It is upon all accounts most desireable, that Preachers should be Godly men,</HI> and <HI>Caeteris Paribus,</HI> they that are Converted themselves are most likely to be instruments of the Conversion of Sinners, and the Edification of Saints. Yet it is lawful for men in a natural condition to Preach the Word Christ Jesus sent out <HI>Judas</HI> to Preach the Gospel as well as the other Disciples: <HI>Mat.</HI> 10. 7. It was the work of the Priests and Levites to Preach to the Peo∣ple of <HI>Israel: Deut.</HI> 33. 10. <HI>They shall teach Jacob thy law, and Israel thy judgments.</HI> But we have no reason to think that they were all Godly. God gave extraordinary gifts in the Primitive times to some that were not Godly, to fit them for Preachers, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 11. <HI>If I speak with the tongue of Men &amp; Angels, and have not charity,</HI> &amp;c. Christ directed the People to attend on the Preaching of the Scribes &amp; Pharisees. <HI>The Scribes &amp; Pha∣risees, set in Moses seat; whatsoever therefore they bid you observe, that observe and do.</HI> And <HI>Paul</HI> rejoy∣ced in some mens Preaching of Christ, though they did it with a bad spirit, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 18.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Sanctifying Grace was not necessary unto those duties of Worship, that were peculiar to the times of
<PB N="7" REF="001372_0011_0FB292DCABADE668"/>the Old Teshament.</HI> There were severals acts of worship that were Instituted of Old, but have been abolished long since; when they were Divine institutions, they were to be attended, not only by Godly, but also by Natural men.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Circumcision:</HI> Circumcision was an holy Ordinance, a token of the Covenant between God and his People: but multitudes of People were according to the Ordinance of God to be Circumcised in the flesh, that were not circum∣cised in heart. God never blamed the People of <HI>Israel</HI> for Circumcising persons that were not Regenerate. <HI>Abraham</HI> was appointed to Cir∣cumcise all the Males in his Family: <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 12, 13. <HI>Ishmael</HI> was Circumcised, but yet a carnal per∣son: <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 25. When the <HI>Israelites</HI> bought Ser∣vants from among the Heathen, they were bound to Circumcise them. All the Israelitish Male Children were in their several Generations to be Circumcised, yet there were but few of them that proved Godly. God ordered that the Con∣gregation of <HI>Israel</HI> should be Circumcised at <HI>Gil∣gal: Josh.</HI> 5. 2. <HI>At that time the Lord said unto Jushua, make thee sharp knives, &amp; circumcise again the chil∣dren of Israel the second time:</HI> yet multitudes of them were carnal men.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Passover:</HI> This was a memorial of the Angels passing over the houses of the Israelites, when the first born of the AEgyptians were slain, <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 27. which was a Type of our Redemp∣tion
<PB N="8" REF="001372_0012_0FB292DE1CE0DA50"/>by Christ; therefore Christ is called our Passover: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 7. <HI>Christ our Passover is Sacrifi∣ced for us.</HI> And it was lawful for men to partake of the Passover who were not Regenerated, for it was Gods appointment that the whole Con∣gregation should keep it: <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 47. At the time of the first Institution there were very few God∣ly among them, for they are called <HI>an evil Gene∣ration.</HI> And so at many other times; yet God threatens those that under any pretence did neg∣lect to celebrate the Passover, if they were clean and not in a Journey, <HI>Numb.</HI> 9. 13. And <HI>Hezekiah</HI> sent to invite the People of <HI>Ephraim</HI> &amp; <HI>Manasseb,</HI> and other Tribes to celebrate the Passover, tho' they had lived in Idolatry for some Ages, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 30. 1. <HI>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel &amp; Judah, &amp; wrote letters also to Ephraim &amp; Manasseb, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to the Lord God of Israel.</HI> And Je∣sus Christ himself partook of the Passover along with Judas: <HI>Luk.</HI> 22. 13, 14. <HI>They made ready the Passover, and when the hour was come, he sat down and the twelve Apostles with him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Offering of Sacrifice:</HI> Many times the whole Congregation of Israel offered Sacrifices to the Lord, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29. 20, 21. Though multitudes of them were in a natural condition. Any one of the People of Israel had his liberty as he saw oc∣casion to bring his Sacrifice to the Lord, <HI>Lev.</HI> 1. 2. Yea not only the People of Israel, but the Stran∣gets among them, had a liberty to bring their
<PB N="9" REF="001372_0013_0FB292DFFACDD928"/>Sacrifices, <HI>Lev.</HI> 22. 18, 19. <HI>Wheever he be of the house of Israel, or of the Strangers in Israel that will offer his oblation for all his Vows, and for all his free∣will offerings, which they will offer unto the Lord, for a burnt offering: Ye shall offer it at your own will, a male without blemish.</HI> And in many cafes the People of Israel were bound to bring their offer∣ings. So the Sin-offerings for Sins of Ignorance, <HI>Lev.</HI> 4. The trespass offerings for Sins wittingly committed, <HI>Lev.</HI> 6. 10. So when they were clean∣sed from the Leprosy; and in many other cases: they indeed did it in a very provoking way be∣cause they lived in wickedness, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6. 20. He tells them, <HI>their offerings were not acceptable, nor their Sacrifices sweet to him.</HI> But it was lawful for them, whether Regenerate or Unregenerate to bring their Sacrifices.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Officiating in the work of the Priest-hood.</HI> The Priests besides teaching of the People, were bound to many other Services: as the offering of their Sacrifices at the brazen Altar; the set∣ting the shew bread in order; the lighting of the Lamps; the offering of Incense; the judg∣ing in cases of Leprosy; and in all Ecclesiasti∣cal cases. But if they were not Regenerate yet it was lawful for them to officiate: If they had any blemish they might not, <HI>Lev.</HI> 21. 17. But the want of Regenerating Grace did not make it unlawful for them to officiate. The Priest-hood went by lineal descent from <HI>Aaron,</HI> it belonged to them by Generation, not by Rege∣neration:
<PB N="10" REF="001372_0014_0FB292E1142E9488"/>and it is unreasonable to think that all the Posterity of <HI>Aaron</HI> were Regenerate. <HI>Hophni</HI> &amp; <HI>Phineas</HI> were not, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 12. <HI>The Sons of Eli were Sons of Belial, they knew not the Lord.</HI> And the chief Priests were principal Enemies to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>III. <HI>Sanctifying Grace is not necessary unto the at∣tending such duties of Worship, as are peculiar to the times of the New-Testament.</HI> There be a few du∣ties of Worship that are peculiar to these times of the New-Testament, but there's no peculiar qualifications requisite in those that do attend them: they agree with the Worship in the time of the Old Testament, so that they are to be attended by the Members of the Visible Church.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Baptism.</HI> In Adult persons, it is needful that there be a profession of Faith &amp; Repentance, morally sincere, in order to their being Baptised. <HI>Mat.</HI> 3. 6. <HI>They were baptised of John in Jordan, con∣fessing their Sins:</HI> So the Eunuch before his Bap∣tism, made confession of Christ: <HI>Act.</HI> 8. 37. <HI>I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</HI> But Bap∣tism may be administred to those who are not Regenerate: It is not to be imagined that all that were Baptised by <HI>John</HI> were Regenerate, or judged by him to be so; If Regeneration had been necessary unto Baptism, Christ would not have committed that Work to his Disciples, who were then exceeding raw, <HI>Job.</HI> 4. 1, 2. The Pha∣risees <HI>heard that Jesus made &amp; baptized more Disciples
<PB N="11" REF="001372_0015_0FB292E274D091A0"/>then John, though Jesus himself baptised not but his Dis∣ciples</HI> So there were multitudes Baptised by <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> in <HI>Samaria;</HI> and <HI>Simon Magus</HI> among the rest, <HI>Act.</HI> 8. 12, 13. And it is the appointment of God that the Children of his visible People, should be Baprised, who are generally at that time in a na∣tural condition. If Unregenerate Persons might not be Baptised, the <HI>Pharisees</HI> would not have been blamed for neglecting Baptism: they would have been excused, as not prepared for it: but they are condemned for not being Bap∣tized, <HI>Luk.</HI> 7. 30. <HI>The Pharisees &amp; Lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not being Bap∣tized of him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lords Supper:</HI> No Scandalous person may be admitted to Baptism, neither may any Scandalous person be admitted to the Lords. Sup∣per; but those that are not Scandalous may par∣take of it, tho' they are not Regenerate. Such persons as might lawfully come to the Passover, may also if they have Knowledge to discern the Lords-body, lawfully come to the Lords-Supper, for they are alike figures; the Passover was a type of Christ to dye; the Lords-Supper is a repre∣sentation of Christ who has dyed: It is lawful for Unregenerate men to celebrate the Memo∣ry of the death of Christ, which is a great incou∣ragement &amp; comfort unto them; and so they do in this Ordinance: It is lawful for Unrege∣nerate men to give a Solemn Testimony to the vertue of the death of Christ, and shew it forth;
<PB N="12" REF="001372_0016_0FB292E414FF2328"/>and so they do in this Ordinance, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 26. <HI>Ye shew forth the Lords Death till be come.</HI> That which God teaches us in this Ordinance, is very needful for Unregenerate men to learn; name∣ly the insufficiency of all other things besides the death of Christ for Salvation, and the alsuf∣ficiency of Christ for Salvation: that which we profess in this Ordinance is very fit for Unrege∣rate men to profess; namely the need of Christ, and saving vertue of his blood: as it may be of great advantage to natural men to hear Gods Promise in the Covenant of Grace. So to see God setting his Seal to the Covenant of Grace. If it be lawful for all the Adult Members of the Church to partake of the Lords-Supper, then it is lawful for some Unregenerate men to do it: but it is lawful for all the Adult Members of the Church to do it: this was the practice in the primitive Church, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 17. <HI>We are all parta∣kers of that one bread:</HI> If it be lawful for the Church to require Unregenerate persons to come to the Lords Supper, then it is lawful for them to come; but it is lawful for the Church to require all its Adult Members to keep the Cove∣nant with God: If it be lawful for an Ungenerate man to be in Covenant with God, it is lawful for them to come to the Lords Supper, for if it be lawful for them to be in Covenant, it is law∣ful for them to keep Covenant: If Sanctification were a necessary qualification to partaking in the Lords Supper, than it would be a very Sinful.
<PB N="13" REF="001372_0017_0FB292E5F68BCA78"/>thing for any unsanctifyed person to come, tho' he hoped he was Godly, tho' he was consident of his Godliness. When Christ Instituted this Ordinance, He commanded his Disciples to at∣tend it, <HI>Luk.</HI> 22. 19. Therefore it is an Ordi∣nance to be attended by the whole Church, by all the Disciples of Christ, that have Knowledge. If Sanctification were a necessary qualification, in order to partaking, then the Church should let no others come, and then God would have gi∣ven them a certain Rule in attending of which, they might keep all others away. Men had need have good arguments to make the World believe, that coming to the Lords Table is a priviledge equally confined with Justification, Adoption and eternal Glory; and that none may venture to the Lords Table, but those that shall be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Officiating in the work of the Gospel Ministry:</HI> If a man do know himself to be Unregenerate, yet it is lawful for him to administer Baptism and the Lords Supper. The blessing of this Ordinance does not depend upon the Piety of him that doth administer it. Christ knew <HI>Ju∣das</HI> to be Unregenerate, yet he let him as well as the rest of the Disciples to administer Bap∣tism: <HI>Joh.</HI> 4. 2. <HI>Josus baptized not but his Disci∣ples.</HI> If men be destitute of Regenerating Grace, yet they may administer Gods Ordinances in such a manner as may be for the glory of God, and the Edification of his People. It is most
<PB N="14" REF="001372_0018_0FB292E704863018"/>desirable upon all accounts that they who Offi∣ciate in the work of the Ministry, be holy and gracious men: but men that are destitute of Grace are not prohibited in the word of God to administer the Ordinances of God, if such may Preach surely they may administer Sacraments. <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of Preaching as a greater work than administring. Baptism, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 17. And we may argue that it is greater than administring the Lords Supper.</P>
<P>The Reasons of the Doctrine we,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is no certain, knowledge who have Sanctifying Grace.</HI> If we should be limited by God, so that we might admit none to Church fellowship, but such as have Sanctifying Grace, we should be under extream difficulties &amp; great scruples of Conscience; for if we make the most exact search, we should often be very much mistaken, and in danger to accept of some that were not sincere, and to reject some that were sincere. There is no certain rule given in the Scripture to the guides of the Church, where∣by they can distinguish Saints from Hypocrites; neither do many Persons know what to make of themselves: Some that are Godly have ma∣ny fears whether their hearts be right in the sight of God: which is implyed in that Pre∣cept, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 10. <HI>Give all diligence to make your Calling and your Election sure.</HI> And many Hypo∣crites have a great considence that they are Saints, <HI>Joh.</HI> 9. 40. <HI>Are we blind also?</HI> It is not
<PB N="15" REF="001372_0019_0FB292E8819BD5B0"/>to be imagined that God would give a Rule to his People that is impracticable: If that were the Rule that only Godly men, were to be ad∣mitted to communion in the Church, there is not knowledge enough upon Earth in order to the practice of it: the Church through their ignorance must wholly forbear acting: for their knowledge of other mens Piety is but a supposition, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5. 12. <HI>By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I suppose.</HI> And particular Persons, would never be able to attend that Rule for want of the knowledge of themselves; some would exclude themselves, and others would obtrude themselves contrary to it, so that the Rule would come to nothing. Gods Rules are such that no man has any just cause to object against them: but if this were the Rule that Godly men only might enjoy Ordinances; the Church might object, that it is Gods preroga∣tive to know the hearts of men, and we are ut∣terly uncapable to attend that Rule.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is needful that others should attend duties of Worship, that the Worship of God may be carryed on.</HI> In the flourishing times of the Church, that will hold, <HI>Mat.</HI> 20. 16. <HI>Many are called and few are chosen:</HI> but there be degenerate times, when Religion runs very low among the People of God; and at such a time, there is a great scar∣city of Godly men, <HI>Psal.</HI> 12. 1. <HI>The Godly man ceaseth, the faithful fail from among the Children of men.</HI> Isai. 53. 1. <HI>Who hath believed our Repors,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001372_0020_0FB292E9F5DC8360"/><HI>and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed.</HI> It may be there may be but two or three some∣times in a Parish: in some Countrys especially Godly men are very thin sown: and if the rest must be excluded from any part of the Wor∣ship of God, how can it be carryed on, how can they shew forth the Lords Death till he come? Yea if none but holy men must Offici∣ate in the Church; they would be necessitated many times to be destitute of Ministers: in some Countrys especially it would be a difficult thing to find men qualifyed with Sanctifying Grace. Sometimes there is a great scarcity of Godly Magistrates: <HI>Jer.</HI> 5. 1. <HI>Run to and fro through the Streets of Jerusalem, and see now &amp; know and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth Judgment, that seeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.</HI> So many times there is a great scarcity of Godly Mini∣sters: <HI>Mat.</HI> 23. 3. <HI>Do not after their works, for they say and do not.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This is very useful that men may obtain Sancti∣fying Grace.</HI> If men have it not now yet it will be a wonderful Mercy if they can obtain it be∣fore they dye: and the attending duties of Worship is very serviceable to that end. There∣by they are in the way to be gained, <HI>Psal.</HI> 29. 9. <HI>In his Temple doth every one speak of his glory.</HI> It is a blessed thing to be waiting upon God, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 34. <HI>Blessed is the man that beareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="001372_0021_0FB292EC985A5448"/>The giving of Converting Grace is not Timit∣ted to any one Ordinance. Prayer is very ser∣viceable that way, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2. 3. <HI>If thou cryest after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding.</HI> So the Hearing of the Word is very serviceable. The entrance of God's Word giveth light. So the Sacraments are very useful for Conversion: God teaches us in Baptism that we are natu∣rally polluted, and that we need to be cleans∣ed by the blood of Christ. God in the Lords Supper in vites us to come to Christ, makes an affecting representation of his Sufferings for our Sins, testifies the Sufficiency of Christ: con∣firms the truth of the Covenant of Grace, teaches us that the Promise of Salvation to those that believe in Christ is certain; all Sa∣craments are Seals of the Covenant, as circum∣cision was: <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 11.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The attending of these duties are part of the External Covenant:</HI> The Covenant People of God are bound to attend Covenant duties. If any part of the External Covenant be neglect∣ed, the Covenant is broken. The Covenant that God makes with his Visible People ought to be attended, the Visible People of God have a natural power to attend those duties, &amp; they have a legal power to attend them: they may attend them lawfully: There is no part of the external Covenant, but it may be kept by the Visible Church, therefore they have power to qualify themselves sufficiently, in order to the
<PB N="18" REF="001372_0022_0FB292EF86D11630"/>attending of them: but if Sanctifying Grace were necessary in order to the lawful attend∣ing of them, than it would be out of their power.</P>
<P><HI>The USE of this Doctrine is of Warning; That you be not afraid to attend duties of Worship, because destitute of Sanctifying Grace.</HI> Men that are destitute of Sanctifying Grace can perform no duty in an acceptable manner: but yet you must not give way to a spirit of fear, so as to neglect your duty. Men must be afraid to neg∣lect it and not afraid to attend it: You must make haste to get Sanctifying Grace, but you must not deny God any part of his Wor∣ship, till that is done. It is a poor thing for men to be scared into Religion, but it is sad in∣deed for men to be scared out of Religion, &amp; to neglect Gods Worship out of fear of God.</P>
<P><HI>There be two things that make men neglect the Lords-Supper.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some despise it, they don't find any need of it; their design is the World and their pleasures; and they don't regard the Lords-Supper.</HI> There is a pro∣phane Spirit prevailing in the Land; and ma∣ny men neglect the Lords-Supper from the same reason, that they neglect Secret Prayer: <HI>viz.</HI> Because they do despise holy things, they don't regard communion with God, nor help and advantages to Eternal Life: they are far from that Spirit that <HI>David</HI> had, Who said, <HI>One thing have I desired, and that I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of
<PB N="19" REF="001372_0023_0FB292F330498AB0"/>my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to en∣quire in his Temple.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Some are afraid of it.</HI> They are desirous to do any thing that they can for the promotion of their Salvation; but they are afraid to at∣tend that Ordinance. It is with them as it was with <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 6. 9. <HI>And David was afraid of the Lord that day, &amp; said, how shad the Ark of the Lord come to we.</HI> They have drunk in an opini∣on, that none but Converted, Persons should come to that Ordinance, and so they neglect in: they have been mis-informed about it, and so dare not come: But they should not be afraid to attend that Ordinance.</P>
<P>Consider 1. <HI>Those who discourage Persons from coming to it, because Unconverted, do in their zeal make others to cease from fearing the Lord.</HI> As the <HI>Reubenites</HI> and <HI>Gaditer</HI> did argue in some what alike case, <HI>Josh.</HI> 22. 23, 24. The neglecting outward Worship is the way to neglect inward Worship. Staying from Ordi∣nances is not the way to fit men for Ordinan∣ces: the neglecting of the Sacrament is the way to make the Country grow prophane. Gods Ordinances are the means to advance Religion. If they neglect Prayer, it would hinder them from fearing the Lord; if they neglect Hear∣ing the Word; if they neglect Baptism; so likewise if they neglect the Lords Supper: it will prove no advantage to Religion to neglect any of God's Ordinances; the solemn attending
<PB N="20" REF="001372_0024_0FB292F8CFD39708"/>of Gods Ordinances lead men into a sence of the need of Christ, and benefit of Christ. The limitting of the Lords Supper to a small num∣ber, has a tendency to nourish carnal considence in them that are admitted, and to nourish pro∣phaneness in them that are excluded.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>There can be no sufficient reason assigned, why those who are destitute of Sanctifying Grace, should be debarred from the Lords Supper.</HI> The holiness of the Ordinance can be no reason: for circum∣cision and the Passover were holy Ordinances, yet many Unregenerate Persons did partake of them. Baptism is an holy Ordinance, yet it may be administred to Unregenerate men: the signification of the Lords Supper can be no rea∣son, it signifies Christ as Suffering for our Sins; the Bread is the sign of his Body, and the Wine the sign of his Blood. So the Water in Bap∣tism, is a sign of the Blood of Christ, yet may be applyed to Unregenerate Persons. The sign of Christ crucifyed is of great use to put them in mind of Christ's Sufferings for us: Its being a Seal of the Covenant is no reason, it is of great use to them to see God Sealing his Covenant. As it is of use for God to declare his Covenant, so to see God Sealing his Covenant: the Testi∣mony that is given to Christ in this Ordinance can be no reason, it is very fit that they as well as others should shew forth his Death.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Many that judge that Persons should be Conver∣ted before they come to the Sacrament, do run into a
<PB N="21" REF="001372_0025_0FB292F9C864E148"/>great fault, viz.</HI> they perswade Persons that they are Converted before they are: they are zealous against mens coming to the Lords-Supper in an Unconverted condition, yet advise &amp; incou∣rage such persons to come under a notion that they are Converted; if persons do but carry civilly &amp; religiously, they think they are Con∣verted, and urge them to joyn to the Church; hereby abundance of wrong is done; men are greatly hardned in a natural Estate: and they are laid under great Temptation to flatter them∣selves, as if the bitterness of death were past: this is a means to prevent many mens Conver∣sion; if men are made to believe that they are Godly before they be, that is like to prove a mighty impediment unto their Conversion, they don't lye open to the threatnings of the Word, they think others spoken to, and they pity them; but they are not sensible of their own danger: <HI>Joh.</HI> 9. 41. <HI>Because you say, you see, therefore your sin remaineth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>If none that are destitute of Sanctifying Grace may come, than two sorts of Persons that do come should stay away.</HI> First, such persons as are in a natu∣ral condition, yet have got a confidence that they are Converted: there are many such. <HI>Prov.</HI> 30. 12. <HI>There is a Generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleansed from their filthiness:</HI> But there is no way to keep them from it, the Church can't keep them from it, because they are visible Saints: and their own Consciences will not for∣bid
<PB N="22" REF="001372_0026_0FB292FB6E03D8A0"/>them, because they are confident that they are Converted. And Secondly, there is another sort that should forbear, <HI>viz.</HI> Such Godly men as do not know that they are Converted. If a man be Godly, yet how can he with a good Con∣science come to an Ordinance, peculiar to God∣ly men, when he don't know himself to be God∣ly: if only Saints are allowed to come, he must know himself to be a Saint, before he can know that he is allowed of God to come. As if a man has power to Sell nothing but what is his own, then he must know a thing to be his own before be can sell it with a good Conscience. Or if a Church have power to consure only Scanda∣lous persons, then they must know a man to be Scandalous before they can with a good Con∣science censure him. So in this case, if the Sa∣crament be only for Godly men, they dont know that they have any right to it, until they know that they are Godly.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>It is from the misunderstanding of one Scripture principally, that these are afraid to come to the Lords∣Supper:</HI> viz. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. There are two expressions in that Chapter that they are terrifyed with, One that <HI>He that eateth &amp; drinketh unworthily, is guilty of the body &amp; blood of the Lord:</HI> that is of propha∣ning the Ordinance. And they are said <HI>to eat &amp; drink damnation or judgment to themselves:</HI> but this unworthy eating is doing of it in a rude manner, as <HI>v.</HI> 21. <HI>For in eating every one taketh be∣fore others his own Supper, and one is hungry &amp; ano∣ther
<PB N="23" REF="001372_0027_0FB292FCD8C431D8"/>is drunken.</HI> And he explains himself, v. 29. <HI>Not discerning the Lords body;</HI> that is, not discorn∣ing that bread from common bread. Another expression is, <HI>Let a man examine himself &amp; so let him eat, v.</HI> 28. But it is not said, Let him examine himself whether he should eat or forbear, <HI>but let him Examine himself, &amp; so let him eat.</HI> The mean∣ing is, that he must come solemnly to that Or∣dinance, Examining what need he has of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Church is bound to receive men if they be externally qualifyed, whether they be Godly or no.</HI> If men make a profession &amp; are not Scandalous in their Conversation, the Church cannot refuse them. The Apostle still received those that made a profession of the Gospel, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. 41. <HI>&amp;</HI> 6. 7. Those that are Saints by calling are to be ac∣cepted of the Church, whether they be Conver∣ted or not. The matter of the Church are vi∣sible Saints: if the Church were only to receive those that are Converted, God would have gi∣ven them a certain rule, in attending of which Unconverted Persons should be excluded, but there is no such Rule given: Neither is there any external sign, that does certainly distinguish Converted men from Unconverted; the Church is not concerned to see that they be all real Saints, their work is to see they be visible Saints, if they reject such they are to blame.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>It cannot be an unlawful thing for men to keep the External Covenant.</HI> As the visible People of God have a natural power, so they have a law∣ful
<PB N="24" REF="001372_0028_0FB292FFD53A43E0"/>power to keep the External Covenant. if they keep the External Covenant they are ac∣cepted as a righteous People, <HI>Deut.</HI> 6. 25. <HI>It shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these Com∣mandments:</HI> If they neglect to do any part of the Covenant, they lay themselves open to the judg∣ments of God. God brings War to avenge the quarrel of his Covenant; and this is one part of Gods Covenant, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 10. Circumcision is call∣ed the Covenant. So this is one branch of the Covenant. It is required in the second Com∣mand, That we worship God in that way which he has appointed: and this is the appointment of God, that his whole visible Church do cele∣brate the Memorial of the Death of Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 17. <HI>We being many do all partake of that one bread.</HI> And indeed it is the duty of the Church to re∣quire all its Adult orderly Members to come to the Lords-Supper, and it would be very strange that it should be the duty of the Church to re∣quire them to come, &amp; censure them for not com∣ing, and yet be their duty to stay away because Unconverted.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>It is exceeding strange that it should be the Institu∣tion of God, that only Converted Persons should come to the Lords-Supper, and yet no more care taken that that Institution should be attended.</HI> If it were Gods will that no Unconverted Persons should come, it is much that he does not charge his Church to use their utmost endeavours to discover Secret Hy∣pocrites, and to keep them out of the Church,
<PB N="25" REF="001372_0029_0FB29301618E7828"/>and that he don't command them to pluck up all the Tares that they can discover among the Wheat; as was proposed, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. 28. And is it not much that he does not charge Unconverted men, not to meddle with those holy things? &amp; tell them that they must content themselves with Praying &amp; Fasting, and Hearing &amp; being Bap∣tized, but proceed no further: but we find no such injunctions in the Scripture.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>We have no cause to wonder to find some Divines of our own Nation, and some of other Nations to deny that the Supper is a Converting Ordinance.</HI> I find <HI>Wendiline,</HI> a great Divine in his disputations a∣gainst the <HI>Lutherans</HI> acknowledging again &amp; a∣gain, that the Sacraments may instrumentally be∣gin Faith in Adult Persons; &amp; in another place, saying, That the Sacraments of confirmation; he means the Passover, and the Lords-Supper may organically begin Faith. Yet there be a great many Divines that do deny this. But this is not to be wondred at, seeing they hold, That Elect Infants that have faederal holiness, have at the same time the internal grace of Regeneration. Thus <HI>Voetius Statu. Elect. Unte. Conv.</HI> And he says, That Dr. <HI>Burges</HI> does prove by many Di∣vines, that Elect Infants have an initial &amp; semi∣nal Regeneration upon their Baptism; if it were so, no doubt but their actual Conversion would be in early days, before they come to that Age, when persons are wont to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="26" REF="001372_0030_0FB29302D6356CC0"/>
10. <HI>No Christian Country does neglect this Ordinance no we do in this Land.</HI> In our own Nation at home, so in <HI>Scotland, Holland, Denmark, Sweedland,</HI> and among the Protestants in <HI>Germany</HI> &amp; <HI>France,</HI> they do generally Celebrate the Memorial of Christs Death. This Country is singular in neglecting of it. About Forty years past, there were a Multitude in the Country, Unbaptized: but that neglect was taken into Exami∣nation, and now there is an alteration in that parti∣cular. But to this day there be Four to One that do neglect the Lords-Supper; as if it did not belong to them to magnify God upon the account of the Work of Redemption. We are a People that pretend high in Religion, but indeed we fall short of other People in the very Form of it, and don't come up in our practice in this particular to many other Churches.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>The general neglect of this Ordinance is a visible denying of the Gospel.</HI> Christ has threatned to <HI>deny them before his Father, that do deny him before men,</HI> Mat. 10. 33. And the neglect of this Institution is a visible denyal of Christ. Our business at the Lords Supper is to Celebrate the Memorial of Christs Death, &amp; to give our Testimony to the Gospel: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 26. <HI>As often as ye eat this Bread, &amp; drink this cup, ye shew forth the Lords death till he come.</HI> They therefore that do neglect to do this, do with-hold their Testimony. They act as if they did not believe the Doctrine to be true. What construction can be put upon it, but that they are unconcerned to give their Testimony to Christ, and question the truth of the Gospel; it is an open reproaching of Christ, &amp; a visible contempt of the Gospel? This neglect has a great tendency, to strengthen &amp; confirm others in their Infidelity; for they act as if they did not believe it. And many Children when they are reproved for their Infidelity,
<PB N="27" REF="001372_0031_0FB29304AD845418"/>have that excuse for themselves, That their Fathers and Mothers do not believe the Gospel.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>The neglect of this Ordinance is one great cause of Gods Judgments.</HI> We are under sorrowful dispensati∣ons, and have reason to conclude this neglect to be one especial cause of them. There be indeed abun∣dance of Moral Evils in the Land, that do provoke God to anger: but generally when God brought Judg∣ments on Israel, it was mainly for corruptions in Worship. As we may not introduce Ceremonies of mens Invention, so we must not neglect Ordinances that are of Divine Institution. Neglects of Worship bring destroying Judgments: <HI>Exod.</HI> 5. 3. <HI>Let us Sacri∣fice to the Lord our God, lest he fall upon us with Pestilence, or with Sword.</HI> Let men have what pretences they will, yet those pretences will not excuse them in the neglect of Gods Ordinances. God don't allow men to be scared out of his Worship. But I do judge that the generality that do neglect it, do it out of a care∣less and prophane Spirit, and then it is no wonder, if it brings down the Wrath of God.</P>
<P>It is Objected by some against this Doctrine, <HI>That if the Lords-Supper be a Converting Ordinance, then not only such as are Civil &amp; Religious may be admitted to it, but prophane &amp; vicious Persons for they likewise need Conversion, &amp; it is pity but they should have all helps to Conversion?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>That Baptism is a Converting Ordinance, but yet is not to be administred to Adult Persons that are prophane:</HI> For Baptism is only a Converting Ordinance to the Members of the Church, who are Unconverted. The Hearing of the Word only is the appointed means for the Conversion of others.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Lords Supper is an Ordinance for the strengthening &amp; exercising of Grace:</HI> yet it doth not follow that it is to be administred to Godly men, who are guilty of
<PB N="28" REF="001372_0032_0FB2930699D5C500"/>Scandal, the need that they have to have their Grace strengthned, is no argument that the Lords-Supper should in that case he administred to them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Though the Lord Supper is a Converting Ordinance, yet it is not to be administred to any prophane &amp; vicious men:</HI> For it is a Converting Ordinance only to those that it is appointed to be administred unto; <HI>viz</HI> Mem∣bers of the Church walking orderly. When Church Members carry Scandalous, there are other Ordinan∣ces appointed for their Conversion, in case they be Unconverted.</P>
<P>It is also Objected, <HI>That these who were Unclean were not to partake of the Passover,</HI> Numb. 9 7 <HI>which seems to hold forth to us. That those that are spiritually Unclean in the dayes of the Gospel, may not partake of the Lords-Supper?</HI></P>
<P>A 1. <HI>If those that were spiritually Unclean might come to the Passover, no reason can be assigned why they may not also come to the Lords Supper:</HI> For the Passover was an holy Ordinance as well as the Lords Supper; and the Passover ought to be attended in an holy manner, as well as the Supper.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Ordinances of the Old Testament were not Types of the Ordinances of the New-Testament.</HI> If the reason why the Unclean might not come to the Passover was to signify that those who were Unregenerate might not come to the Lords-Supper: of what Edification would that Institution be to the Jews. They did not understand any such meaning, &amp; if they had, it would have done them no good. But the Ordinances of the Old Testament did signify Evangelical Doctrines, which were of great use to the Jews, so this appointment, that Unclean Persons might not come to the Passover did signify, that those who were spiritually Unclean, should not have communion with God in the highest Heaven, but be Excluded out of the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
