<HEAD>An Election Sermon.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CIII. 11.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Like as a Father pitieth his Children, so the LORD pitieth them that Fear Him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Psalm is Entituled, <HI>A Psalm of David;</HI> in which he stirreth up him∣self and summoneth all his Powers, both of Body and Mind, to bless &amp; praise the Name of GOD. The particular Reasons of it, are;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Special mercy shewn to him in forgiving his sins &amp; healing his diseases, and in saving him from death when in imminent danger.</HI> See ver. 1. <HI>to</HI> 4. He shews his care thus, To relieve the Oppressed, ver. 5, 6. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>His Particular care for &amp; over his Church, even for Israel, in giving his Law to them, and opening to them the mysteries of his Providence in their favour.</HI> ver. 7, 8, 9. So that if he corrects them for their Sins, as his chosen people; yet he limits &amp; sets bounds to his Anger, as to the time and the measure of it. If he visits sore, yet not accor∣ding to the demerit of their sins; but causes His Grace to Exert it self over their Unwor∣thiness, <HI>ver.</HI> 10, 11. But 'tis in special
<PB N="2" REF="004155_0006_1003DAB1C8A1DAA8"/>
to <HI>them that fear Him:</HI> He pardons their sins &amp; does them all away. They are removed from them <HI>so far as the East and the West in their distances,</HI> ver. 12. This the Lord promises to do for the faithful, in the day of his gracious visitation, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31 34. And here, <HI>ver.</HI> 13. His gracious dealing is compared to that of a <HI>tender and compassionate Father</HI> in his dealing with his Children. Text, <HI>Like as a Father pitieth his Chil∣dren, &amp;c</HI> God is a Father to such; in the way of the New Covenant he owns them to be such, let them be <HI>Jew</HI> or <HI>Gentile,</HI> in the Gospel day, without distinction; and he treats them with like care and tenderness. And he is in special so tender and gracious in his dealings towards them that <HI>truly Fear him; i. e.</HI> the Seed of the Faithful; such as are Upright before him, and are under the influence of his Fear. so as to make it their care to please Him by keeping Covenant with him. Be it so they offend at times and break his Laws, He that knows their defects, will bear much with their froward tem∣pers &amp; peevish dispositions. He is not strict to <HI>mark their iniquities against them,</HI> for he <HI>knows their frame,</HI> ver. 14.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>That GOD has a Fatherly Care for His Covenant Children; in special for them that Fear Him.</HI></Q>
<P>Here to shew,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="004155_0007_1003DAB70B77D250"/>1. <HI>He has a Fatherly Care for his Covenant People in general.</HI> He has so for Israel, whilst a Nation or People in Covenant with him; and he has so for a People or Nation taken into Covenant in Gospel times.</P>
<P>And we may briefly hint it in several Instan∣ces, in which the Lord shews it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In declaring them to be his Children and owning them as such.</HI> When God brings <HI>Israel</HI> into Covenant, he thus declares for Himself, and brings them thus to stipulate with him; or to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Here <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the mutual Engagement between them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 26.17, 18. So it is in Gospel Times, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8, 10. <HI>Again,</HI> He is said in terms, <HI>To be their Father;</HI> and they are said to be, <HI>His Sons &amp; Daughters,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.18.</P>
<P>But will the Most High and holy GOD thus transact with Vile and Sinful men, that be as Worms of the dust? Yes, so tis; Oh! ineffable Grace and Condescention in him. The Psal∣mist therefore Expresses his Raised thoughts upon it, Psal. 8.4. <HI>What is man, that thou art thus mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou art pleased thus to visit him?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In taking them under his Fatherly Conduct &amp; Directions</HI> Herein he acts the part of a Father. Parental care tends to this; To be sure for the Child while he is a Child, and wants skill and conduct to direct himself. Now the Father will keep him under his Eye, and not let him go
<PB N="4" REF="004155_0008_1003DABA56A6E788"/>
far from him, or get out of his sight. The Lord has thus the wakeful Eye of his Providence over <HI>Israel</HI> night &amp; day: The <HI>Pillar of the cloud by day,</HI> and that <HI>of fire by night,</HI> to guide them in the way they should go. This shews his par∣ticular care to guide them in the Wilderness, after he has brought them out of <HI>Egypt</HI> by a Mighty Hand and prevented them in their low Estate, <HI>Exod.</HI> 13.21, 22. So <HI>Moses</HI> speaks in his Divine Song concerning them, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.10. Thus, <HI>When Israel is a child the Lord loves him, and calls his son out of Egypt,</HI> Hos. 11.1.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In the Provision he makes for them.</HI> 'Tis the care of a tender Father to provide for his Chil∣dren; to be sure while they be young and not able to provide for themselves. The Lord has this care for men in general, to provide for them, <HI>He provides for Man and Beast;</HI> These are all his Creatures, and live upon his Bounty day by day. But he provides in special
for <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> as his People in Covenant; in the Wilder∣ness, Psal. 78.26. <HI>He gives them bread from hea∣ven, and water out of the rock.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>In taking them under his special Protection.</HI> A Father will do this as he is able for his Child, He will protect him from harm, if he be expo∣sed by Enemies, or by Beasts of prey, &amp;c. The Lord takes <HI>Israel,</HI> from the time of his coming up out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> down to Succeeding Times, under the wing of his Protection. He is tender
<PB N="5" REF="004155_0009_1003B86C5E17EB20"/>
of them, <HI>even as of the apple of his Eye, Deut.</HI> 32.10. If any touch them to do them harm, still they provoke Him to anger by their sins; and shall be sure to feel his Resentments for it, <HI>Psal.</HI> 105.13, 14, 15.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>In bearing with their evil Tempers and Man∣ners.</HI> Parents are thus pitiful towards their Children, in bearing with their peevish Tempers and froward Dispositions; they bear much and long with them; to be sure some do so: they bear with that from them thro' love &amp; tender∣ness, which others can't that be strangers to them or not so nearly related. So the Lord bears with that from his People in Covenant, that he will not bear with from others. He bears with that from them, which they won't or can't bear with from one another. This the Context shews. He bears with them long; and if their Sins be many and very grievous, and heavy Enough to tire his Patience, if he were like a weak and angry man; so that he would be for consuming them at once. See <HI>Jonah</HI> 4.1, 3. <HI>compar'd with Neh.</HI> 1.3. Mal 36. <HI>I am the Lord, I change not: therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>In the Correction he uses when he sees there is need.</HI> He sees at times there is need of it: Milder means won't do; Chidings won't do; Reproofs, Admonitions, Warnings, Threat∣nings won't do; He hews them by his Servants
<PB N="6" REF="004155_0010_1003DAC78F259BF8"/>
the Prophets, and slays them by the words of his Mouth, <HI>Hos.</HI> 6.5. So the Lord threatens <HI>Israel.</HI> But this is not sufficient to Reclaim them. Now he proceeds to visit with the Rod. But how loth does he seem to be to come to it, or to use it as he might? If he Corrects, he acts as a Father in it, and not as an incensed Judge. His Correction is seasonable; He will take a proper time and season for it: He will not do it too soon; so as to be sudden and hasty in it; nor will he defer it too long. He will take them alone to do it, or by themselves as separate from other people, and when their minds are best prepared to receive it, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.28. Farther, In its particular nature and kind, it shall be seaso∣nable and proper to carry light and conviction with it, that they may read or see their Sin in the punishment of it, <HI>Psal.</HI> 18 26. <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. Again, As to the measure of it; The Church prays for this, Jer. 10 24 <HI>O Lord, correct me, but with judgment, &amp;c lest thou bring me to nothing.</HI> He tries lighter strokes, and then more heavy, if there be need; but yet 'tis in measure. <HI>He does in the midst of Judgment remember Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>And for a close to this, here we may observe a Fathers pity herein, His lothness to give them up, if they prove Incorrigible under all See the yearnings of his bowels; as the heart of a tender Parent ready to break within him, <HI>Hos.</HI> 11.8. Yea, rather than do as at times, when all
<PB N="7" REF="004155_0011_1003DACF46555298"/>
means fail, he will try his own Strength upon them, and break their stubborn and rebellious Hearts by the power of his Almighty Arm: (What is more than any Earthly Parent can possibly do) See it in <HI>Ephraim</HI>'s turn, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.19, 20. Thus for the first General Head.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>To shew He has this Care in special for them that truly Fear Him.</HI> Be it so his Fatherly care reaches to the Body of a People in Covenant with him, then that of a more special nature to them that truly fear him. These are the faith∣ful in the Land, on whom the Lord has set his Eye, and in whom he delights.</P>
<P>His Fatherly Care for them intends such things as these in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That his Love to them is Peculiar.</HI> He has set his love upon them before the Foundation of the world. He has Loved them with an Everlasting Love, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.3. They are chosen in Christ, to be to the glory of his Grace, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He has given them to know his Name and to put their Trust in Him.</HI> Others hear of him and may have some sensible manifestations of his Presence and Glory (As <HI>Israel</HI> at the Red Sea, and at Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> after it, upon the giving the Law) that now dispose them to Praise him or to Fear him for a time; but they don't see him, as <HI>Moses</HI> does in the Proclamation of his Name, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34, 6, 7. Or as <HI>Abraham.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004155_0012_1003DAD4AEE43A08"/>
<HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> their Fathers, before did, when he made or declared his Covenant with them; or as such as truly fear God in the Gospel-day, know him at times in his Son Jesus Christ, <HI>Job.</HI> 17.3. The Spirit of God thus opening their Understandings in Gospel Truths and giving them to see &amp; know the things set forth, or the Objects revealed by this medium, in a spiritual manner; or to Evidence the clearness so as they could not see them before, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2, 9, <HI>to</HI> 14. So 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. &amp; <HI>Chap.</HI> 4.6.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Their Relation to God 'tis Saving.</HI> Others are Visibly related to him; they may have right to External Privileges, as having a Regular standing in the Covenant: But these upon be∣lieving in Christ and coming up to the Gospel Condition, have the favour or privilege of Adoption in a <HI>Saving sense</HI> and <HI>meaning.</HI> They have a real vital Union to Christ, <HI>Job.</HI> 1.12. They have the spirit of Children given to them as the fruit of their Faith. Hence a filial fear of God &amp; love to him; coming to him with free∣dom, as Children to a Father, in the duty of Prayer, or by way of Complaint upon occasion. This is more in some than others, and more sen∣sible in the Subject of it at one time than at an∣other; but yet there is something of it in every true Believer, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.15. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.6.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>God's Providence is concerned in all his dealings, to promote their best good and to farther them in the
<PB N="9" REF="004155_0013_1003DADB86EE42F0"/>
way to Eternal Life.</HI> See the faith of the upright man for this, <HI>Psal.</HI> 73.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28. Let us then be directed to look constantly to the glory of God as our ultimate End in whatever we do or suffer, and this will arm us with Christian fortitude and patience, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.7 Others have found its strength &amp; efficacy, when acted from this spirit of Faith, in the view of things unseen and eternal. See it in the Primitive Christians under their Persecutions, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.17.</P>
<P>But for the <HI>ƲSE</HI> of the <HI>DOCTRINE.</HI></P>
<P>USE, I. Of <HI>Information</HI> and <HI>Instruction,</HI> in a few Particulars. Learn hence,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Obligations of such a People to GOD must be special and very great.</HI> As they be the Subjects of his Fatherly Care, so their Obligations are proportionate as Children, to be true and faithful to him. See what the Lord expects from <HI>Israel,</HI> on the account of what he had done in taking them into Covenant with himself. He saves them before hand, as it were. He migh∣tily trusts and confides in them, that they will be obedient &amp; true to what they promise, and what he has so fairly bound them to do. Isa 63.8 <HI>He said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.</HI> They be in particular bound to love the Lord their God, and to cleave to him as their Portion and Inhe∣ritance;
<PB N="10" REF="004155_0014_1003DAF5961D3D58"/>
they are to give up themselves to him in Heart and Life, <HI>Deut.</HI> 6, 4, 5. They be obliged to fear and honour Him. See the Lord's chal∣lenge, (on the common right of a Parent) to <HI>Israel,</HI> Mal. 1.6. <HI>A son honoureth his father, —If I then be your Father, where is mine Honour?</HI> They are to be much in the study of his Pre∣cepts to know his Mind and Will, that so they may be Obedient to him in all things, and may attend the duties of Natural and Revealed Re∣ligion with care: They are to Fear GOD and Reverence their Superiors in every Order. Its like to go well with a People when the Fifth Commandment is strictly observed by them. They are to own and profess the Truths of God, and to Worship him aright, <HI>Job.</HI> 4.24. They are to Fear and Reverence his Great and Holy Name; to Sanctify the Sabbath, to keep it as a Holy Day unto the Lord; to Love his House, his Worship and Ordinances therein, and not live in the careless Neglect of any of his Institutions. Farther, They are to to be Sober, Temperate, Peaceable, Chast, Diligent in Bu∣siness, Men of Truth and Honesty, Kind and Charitable, and so govern their Affections as to these things, by the rules of Reason and Re∣ligion: They are to be Humble and Meek, not Proud &amp; Haughty; so as to gain the ascendant over their corrupt Humours and Passions: And to be in all things Blameless as the Sons of God
<PB N="11" REF="004155_0015_1003DB12E051F4D0"/>
without Rebuke. If the world in general be Corrupt, they ought not to be so; but be sepa∣rate &amp; stop at a distance from them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.19. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.15. They are to consider the End of God's dealing with them, and what will be the End of their contrary Carriage to Him, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.29 Farther, As to the special tyes of Gra∣titude to God, which are thus laid upon them and how if herein they fail and are unmind∣ful of the God that has formed them and Re∣deemed them, there's just ground of Com∣plaint against them; As in <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.6.</P>
<P N="2">2. Learn hence, <HI>How sad it is if such a People do much to provoke him by their Sins.</HI> If instead of Living to him as obedient Children, they Rebel against him; if instead of Trembling at the word, or feeling the weight of God's Au∣thority in it, as well as the justice &amp; goodness of the Precept, they trample upon it and are bold to transgress; This is sad and looks with a dark Aspect on a People. In special,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>If they be Sins which they have been often told of, reproved for, warned against, and called on to humble themselves for before the Lord, and so to Re∣form.</HI> If a people are often told of their for∣getfulness of God, their neglect of his Worship and Ordinances; of their Formality in God's service, or of their strange Ease and Quiet in resting in doing somthing in the duties of Re∣ligion, short of the life &amp; power of Godliness.
<PB N="12" REF="004155_0016_1003DB26934B6C30"/>
If they are told of their Pride, Covetousness, Voluptuousness, Injustice, Deceit and Lying. If they are told of their Strifes &amp; Divisions in Towns and Churches, to the waft of much precious Time, as well as to their apparent hurt and damage in Temporals and Spirituals. And yet there is no return to God by Refor∣mation: Still the same Sins laid in charge against them, Year after Year; no change in the general for the better; but it may be growing worse, here is a sad Omen upon a people, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.25, 26.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Sins for which they have suffered much already.</HI> If for these &amp; such like Sins the Land mourns, and for them the Lord yet smoaks against our Prayers; and we have yet Sickness sore and grievous; just complaint of our low and declining state in Temporals, as well as Spirituals. In particular, as to frowns in Sea∣sons in the Spring, and so in Harvest time, so that the work of our hands fail as to the Fruit of it, and our Stock dies in particular places. If our Losses are considerable by Land or Sea, every Year, and yet we have not Eyes to see nor Hearts to reform; but some are impatient &amp; find fault with others, while some are easie and unconcerned; others be in the dark and at a loss, not knowing what to do to Revive a dying or decaying State; saving but to go on in the Path they have gone on in from year to
<PB N="13" REF="004155_0017_1003DB58DC607720"/>
year; And still the Complaint is, as made by the more serious and thinking Part of this people, as wiftly looking one upon another in Conversation, That the Land is sinking, no Reformation, no Amendment; but things look darker on us from year to year in ssome respect or other! What is it but to come to their case in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.10. <HI>To put away, &amp;c.?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Inference, <HI>It may teach such a People not to distrust God's Care in time of Distrest, Straits and Dangers.</HI> They may be at times much Ex∣posed; their Constitution may be Threatned, by such as are no Friends to it; God is angry, and a series of Evils follow it: yet such a Peo∣ple as are in the hands of a Merciful God and Compassionate Father, are not to distrust his Care. It may be the People ben't brought low enough yet. To be sure they be not as to temper and spirit; it may be as to their Circumstances neither. When the Child is got much out of frame, grown to be very froward, peevish and stout, and will be going away from its Parents in its own strength; no wonder if the Parent lets go its hold and so it falls to wounding in a measure for conviction; yet it goes not out of sight. A sad instance like this in <HI>Israel,</HI> when they had been fret∣ting and provoking the Lord, upon the evil report of the Spies, they will yet venture to go up without Commission from God; but
<PB N="14" REF="004155_0018_1003DB71179A4C20"/>
they smart for their Presumption, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. So a People may be apt to trust to Man and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to their own Strength and the in∣fluence of Others as <HI>Israel</HI> to <HI>Moses &amp; Aaron</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> but yet their burden grows, their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is doubled before the Lord begins to work for their deliverance. And so it may be now, when a People have been looking here and there, to men &amp; means to be saved from Evils, and it Fails; now may be the time for the Lord to shew his Power, <HI>Isa.</HI> 62.6. Farther, In the time of outward Straits, 'tis with the Lord to supply our Wants; He has done it for <HI>Israel</HI> in times past, and he is as able &amp; willing to do it now as then, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.1. He will do it if we trust in him; He has so declared for such as fear him and hope in his grace, <HI>Psal.</HI> 34.10.37.3. Farther, If he brings desolating Judgments by sore Sickness upon some parts of the Land, he may spare us and our Children, if we take the warning and be humbled for our sins before him, sympathize with our Christian Brethren under their sore Bereavements, and unitedly be seeking for sparing Mercy in this time of threatning Calamity. The Lord knows our frames, and considers that we are but dust; as it follows the Text. See ver. 14, 15.</P>
<P N="4">4. Inference, <HI>Learn hence, how dreadful is the state of such a People, to be Rejected of God and to be Cast off by him.</HI> Their repeated Back∣slidings
<PB N="15" REF="004155_0019_1003B8B0D6611870"/>
lead to it, if they be of duration and continuance, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.5. Now they grow to that degree in Sin, and are so habituated to it, that their wound is said to be incurable, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.22. Now if the Lord writes, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> upon <HI>Israels</HI> State, <HI>Hos.</HI> 1.9. First Rejects her, and then the House of <HI>Judah,</HI> for like abomina∣tions. Now is their Glory and defence gone, their City and Temple; Mount <HI>Sion</HI> once the Joy of the whole Earth, is made a Ruinous heap. So if after this there be a revival upon <HI>Judahs</HI> Captivity; they quickly Revolt from God. How low is their State brought at times, by particular Judgments from God, or by Enemies, and they be threatned with utter Ruine, which comes at length upon their Re∣jecting Christ. In the prospect of which, how is their sad state Lamented by him, as he sees the Day of it to be approaching? <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.37. So <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.41, 42.

<P>USE, II. Of <HI>Exhortation</HI> and <HI>Direction, to several Orders and Degrees of Persons among us, with respect to the Relative Duties incumbent on them, in their Places.</HI> And here in particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let it be directed to the</HI> Civil Rulers <HI>of this People; in special to the Honourable the GOVER∣NOƲR, the DEPƲTY-Governour, the Worship∣ful Assistants, Judges and Justices; together with the Representative Body of this People now Assem∣bled on this great and weighty Occasion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Honourable, Worshipful &amp; highly Esteemed;</HI> As the Rule and Government of this People, may be again devolved upon You, by this Days E∣lection, and you may be so directed by Provi∣dence to take the Charge a new upon you; be Intreated <HI>to do it in Humility and the Fear of the Lord</HI> 'Tis from <HI>Him</HI> you derive your <HI>Power;</HI> Let then a tender Regard <HI>for His Honour,</HI> and a Concern for <HI>the Publick good of this People,</HI> be the Principles and Motives by which you are acted in your <HI>Conduct and Government</HI> of them. We Expect of You, <HI>as the Sons of the Mighty,</HI> whose <HI>Name you bear in your Exalted Station,</HI> that

you <HI>Eye Him in his Rectoral Care &amp; Goodness;</HI> and Imitate his <HI>good Providence,</HI> in a tender concern <HI>for the Welfare of this People,</HI> so far as you are capable of. In particular, <HI>Be directed &amp; humbly intreated, to be tender and skilful Guides to the People.</HI> Use and improve <HI>the Knowlege you have</HI> in the <HI>Rules of Government;</HI> and the <HI>Experience you have gained</HI> in the <HI>state of this People,</HI> since you have been in <HI>a Publick Capacity</HI> over them for this End. Do you find the temper of this People <HI>to Shift and Change;</HI> to be running to <HI>the Extreams on the one side or the other;</HI> to be In∣fluenced by <HI>present</HI> and <HI>sudden Views of things,</HI> without a due care or concern to <HI>look to the End</HI> of them? Labour to <HI>see for them,</HI> to <HI>shew them their Dangers</HI> and the <HI>Mischiefs that may follow:</HI> And point out the way to them <HI>which may be more plain and safe.</HI> Thus act in Imitation of the <HI>Faithful &amp; Experienced Ruler, Psal.</HI> 78.72. Again, As the Heads of this People, use your <HI>Strength, Providence &amp; Skill,</HI> for the <HI>Protection and Defence of this People,</HI> in their just Liberties <HI>Civil and Sacred.</HI> Let your <HI>United Counsels</HI> be so im∣proved in your <HI>Present Sessions,</HI> to know if our <HI>Privileges may be in Danger;</HI> what the <HI>Exceptions may be</HI> that are made against the Government, how <HI>they may be Obviated;</HI> that we may be yet <HI>a Peaceable &amp; Quiet Habitation,</HI> under the Um∣brage &amp; Protection of our Most Gracious SO∣VEREIGN. And be it so, the LORD our God

threatens us for our <HI>great &amp; crying Sins,</HI> and his Anger <HI>begins to burn us,</HI> as in other parts of the Land, we Expect <HI>you Observe it,</HI> and Search into the <HI>Cause of it,</HI> or be Leading in it <HI>to Remove it;</HI> so to step in <HI>as Gapmen to make up the Breach,</HI> that we be <HI>not Consumed. Pious Rulers,</HI> as well as <HI>Faithful Ministers,</HI> may be <HI>prevalent Intercessors with God</HI> at such a time, and so be made <HI>Publick Blessings to a People.</HI> See <HI>Numb.</HI> 16.48. &amp; 11.2 <HI>compared with Psal.</HI> 106.23. Moreover, Let the Eye <HI>of this Honourable Assembly</HI> be ever upon the Lord, to be to them for a <HI>spirit of Counsel, Wisdom &amp; Might,</HI> to make them <HI>Wise</HI> &amp; <HI>Know∣ing</HI> in their <HI>present Work</HI> and <HI>Business,</HI> to <HI>Direct their Counsels,</HI> to lead to such <HI>Resolves and Acts</HI> as may be for the <HI>Health, Peace &amp; Prosperity</HI> of this People. Let <HI>Laws</HI> or <HI>Acts</HI> made <HI>to Re∣strain Excesses</HI> amongst us, be Passed <HI>upon Deli∣beration &amp; Judgment:</HI> And if so made, let them not be <HI>hastily Repealed:</HI> Let it not be said, <HI>It won't bear, it can't be practised upon; 'twill do no good to reach the End.</HI> Is the <HI>Remedy</HI> worse, or as bad as the <HI>Disease?</HI> Is there nothing farther to be done to restrain us in our Non-necessaries? Must the way be yet as open to <HI>Intemperance &amp; Luxury,</HI> to <HI>Rioting &amp; Drunkenness,</HI> as it has been? Methinks, I hear the Lord speaking to you, as to the Prophet, Jer. 15.19. <HI>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</HI> Farther, Let your Wisdom &amp; Care be Improved, as to

The People grow and spread themselves, here and there upon the <HI>face of the ground; Crops fail often,</HI> and so does the <HI>Harvest other ways.</HI> Providence frowns in the time of our <HI>Ingathering,</HI> so that if <HI>Husbandry &amp; Frugality</HI> is not promoted, <HI>Man &amp; Beast</HI> is Exposed to suffer.

<P>Farther to this Assembly I would humbly offer or say, Hear the just <HI>Grievances &amp; Complaints of this People,</HI> so as to do them <HI>Justice,</HI> or to set them in the <HI>way to have it done</HI> for them.

much guilt be this way contracted amongst a People, when they be <HI>hardly used,</HI> and kept in a <HI>poor Starving state,</HI> from Rigour or Covetousness in men. Now, it may be, their groans reach Heaven, and bring a blast on People; and that they strangely die, here &amp; there at particular times &amp; seasons; or there is wast of their Sub∣stance other ways, which leads to it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.22</P>
<P>USE, III. And last, <HI>May be in a word of Encou∣ragement &amp; Comfort, to Two sorts of Persons.</HI> Is the Lord as our God &amp; Father in Covenant, a God of <HI>such tender Pity to them that fear him as his Covenant Children?</HI> It may Encourage or Comfort two sorts of persons. In particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Souls in Distress under Inward Troubles;</HI> as Convinced Sinners, or such whom the Lord may be about to humble and prepare for his grace, that yet remain in the dark, and have not seen that the Lord is gracious. Here,</P>
<P N="1">(1) Consider, <HI>There is grace enough in God for you.</HI> Be it so you have sinned with a high hand and have lived long in it, so as to give ground to fear you have got beyond the <HI>reach of mercy,</HI> yet consider this grace &amp; goodness in the <HI>Foun'¦tain,</HI> 'tis Infinite. And it may be the Lord de∣signs to pour it forth upon you, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.20</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>He gives you particular Encouragement to seek it.</HI> Does your trouble and distress drive you to God? as it does if it works aright. As
<PB N="26" REF="004155_0030_1003DC2433EAC968"/>
wounded in spirit, are you so prepared to look <HI>to him for Healing?</HI> Your Encouragement now is great. 'Tis the Spirits work now in the time of his gracious Visitation, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10 <HI>Hos.</HI> 6.10</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>He has bestow'd it on others, as vile or worse than you be.</HI> Be it so you are Vile &amp; deserve to be turned down to Hell, and you appear to be viler than any man; yet there be Patterns of mercy before you. See it in <HI>Manasseh, Mary Mag∣dalene,</HI> the <HI>Thief on the Cross,</HI> &amp; others 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11</P>
<P N="4">(4) <HI>He promises to Accept you upon believing and hoping in his Mercy.</HI> He bids you do it, &amp; warns you not to seek for rest any where else. 'Tis the Lord <HI>against whom you have sinned,</HI> and 'tis his Prerogative to indemnify &amp; clear you from your Guilt. And this is sure to the Soul that truly turns and repents, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.7.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let it be of Comfort to all such as truly fear the Lord.</HI> This Doctrine gives ground of strong Consolation to all such <HI>as truly fear the Lord,</HI> or have reason so to hope from what they have <HI>seen of him</HI> in his <HI>Power, Grace</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> after they have been brought <HI>to sensible Con∣viction</HI> of their own Sinfulness, Nothingness &amp; Unworthiness of his Favour. So if they may gather it from <HI>the gracious fruits of his Love in them;</HI> as to Trusting in him upon being bro't to know him and to see him in his <HI>Relative Goodness;</HI> so to Love him and Fear him with <HI>holy Fear,</HI> as is the spirit of his Children: Such
<PB N="27" REF="004155_0031_1003DC2F864E0F38"/>
have <HI>sure ground of Comfort.</HI> Here Two things. Let such Consider,</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>The Covenant with the Promise of it is sure.</HI> The Covenant is Everlasting: It reaches to you, and to your Seed, upon condition. 'Tis such a Relation made between God and you, as that no Relation in Nature can reach it, or in the way of Civil Contract. 'Tis set forth by many things; but they do but faintly shew it. The Lord speaks of being <HI>a Father to you in Co∣venant;</HI> and he is more than so: Of being <HI>your Husband;</HI> and he is yet more than so, <HI>Isa.</HI> 54.5. Such Relations hold fast for Life; but such is your Covenant Interest, as that <HI>neither Life nor Death can disanul it.</HI> The Covenant <HI>it is Ever∣lasting,</HI> and so is the Foundation of your Com∣fort, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.3. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 38, 39.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Hence all his Dealings with them are in this way.</HI> Let the man that truly fears the Lord Consider this, <HI>The Lord is ever mindful of his Co∣venant, in the good or evil which he brings upon you;</HI> and it reaches to your Children too, as they may be prepar'd to fear him &amp; serve him Early. For which you have great Encouragement to Plead at the Throne of grace. See the En∣couragement, here as it follows the Text, ver. 17, 18. <HI>But the Mercy of the Lord is from Ever∣lasting to Everlasting upon them that Fear him; and his Righteousness unto Childrens Children: To such as keep his Covenant, and to those that remember his Commandments to do them.</HI></P>
