<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been favour'd with the Read∣ing the Ensuing <HI>Treatise,</HI> I desire heartily to bless GOD, who has gra∣ciously directed and led his <HI>Servant</HI> into, and assisted him in the <HI>Composing</HI> it, and inclin'd him to <HI>Publish</HI> it. The <HI>Subject</HI> is certainly the best chosen that can be for Universal and perpetual <HI>Use</HI> to Souls, both for the Convin∣cing and Converting <HI>Sinners,</HI> and the quickning of <HI>Saints.</HI> The Design of this <HI>Epistolary Pre∣face</HI> is, if it may please God, to impress the <HI>Readers</HI> Soul with a serious Consideration of the <HI>Importance</HI> of the great and necessary <HI>Truths</HI> here prepared for him, and to bespeak a very <HI>se∣rious Attention</HI> to them while he reads them. For how <HI>awful,</HI> affecting and awakening shou'd it be to Mankind to hear of that <HI>Great and Glorious Salvation revealed and offered to Sinners in and by the Gospel, and the great and unavoidable Misery which the Neglect of it will bring upon us.</HI> This Great Subject
<PB N="ii" REF="001939_0003_0FBA2670D55DB230"/>
is here handled in the most plain and serious <HI>manner,</HI> with a pure Aim and sincere Zeal (to make the most <HI>upright Judgment of Charity</HI> I am able to form) to inform the Minds and enter into the Consciences of Men.</P>
<P>Sinners are here shewn the <HI>Need</HI> they stand in of Salvation; the <HI>Way</HI> of Salvation is opened; the great and glorious <HI>Nature</HI> of the offer'd Salvation is considered; the <HI>proneness</HI> which there is in Men to neglect it is discovered; the <HI>actual</HI> neglect of it among Men is lamented; and the great and <HI>unavoidable Misery</HI> which this Neglect will bring upon Men is faithfully and solemnly declared. These great Things (which are the <HI>whole of Man</HI> and the <HI>one thing needful)</HI> are here discours'd in a Scrip∣tural and rational manner; and the whole <HI>Ar∣gument</HI> is manag'd in a Method and Stile very solid and judicious, clear and distinct, earnest and moving; such as the Weight, Gravity and Solemnity of the <HI>Subject</HI> calls for.</P>
<P>These are the great <HI>points</HI> which the Souls of <HI>Ministers</HI> should be intently fixed on, if they would <HI>take heed to the Ministry which they have received of the LORD that they fulfil it:</HI> And these things must perpetually im∣ploy the Minds of <HI>serious Christians</HI> in the working out their own Salvation, as well as be continually Inculcated upon <HI>careless Sinners</HI> for their Awak'ning and Conversion.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="001939_0004_0FBA2672CCB24268"/>But the great thing now to be desir'd and en∣deavour'd is, that the <HI>Reader</HI> may bring a Mind seriously dispos'd to <HI>receive the Truth.</HI> And O that Men would suffer themselves to be wro't upon to consider thoroughly these <HI>Three</HI> things: The <HI>Greatness</HI> of that Salvation which is pur∣chased by the LORD JESUS CHRIST for them and freely offered to them: the <HI>Shameful Neglect</HI> of it by Christians; and the insuppor∣table <HI>Miseries</HI> which Men unavoidably bring upon themselves by this Neglect.</P>
<P>No wit or words of Man can at last rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sent, no <HI>tongue of Men or Angels</HI> can say, how GREAT this SALVATION is. It is incompre∣hensibly Great in its Blessed and Glorious <HI>Au∣thor, the Great GOD and our SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST.</HI> It is transcendently Great in the <HI>Price</HI> that purchas'd it, the <HI>Blood of the SON of GOD.</HI> Inestimably Great is the <HI>Subject</HI> of this Salvation, the many Millions of <HI>Immortal Souls</HI> redeemed from the Earth. And inconceivably Great are the <HI>Benefits</HI> to us: Great are the <HI>Evils,</HI> mischiefs and miseries our Souls are saved from, and ineffable the positive <HI>Mer∣cies</HI> and Blessings we are redeemed to: <HI>A Sal∣vation with Eternal Glory.</HI></P>
<P>But how <HI>sad</HI> is it to consider how shamefully Men <HI>despise their own Souls,</HI> and <HI>neglect</HI> the Great Salvation! O the infatuation and stupidity of <HI>Christians,</HI> and O their Guilt and
<PB N="iv" REF="001939_0005_0FBA2675854D1610"/>
Misery herein! how lightly do they esteem <HI>them∣selves,</HI> how lightly the <HI>Rock of their Salva∣tion!</HI> how light do Men set by CHRIST, their Souls and Heaven! and how light do they make of Hell and Damnation! with an equal profaness they set light by the Wrath and Curse of the Eternal GOD, and by his Favour, Love and Blessing. This <HI>neglect</HI> of our selves is a most criminal <HI>Contempt</HI> of GOD: and the <HI>one</HI> is not more impious and ungrateful, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>other</HI> is unnatural, unjust, cruel and barba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us. And what a dominion of Sin and <HI>Lust,</HI> what possession of <HI>Satan,</HI> what disbelief of the glorious <HI>Gospel,</HI> and what aversation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> true <HI>Godliness,</HI> do <HI>either</HI> of them infer?</P>
<P>What need is there often to put the <HI>awful Question</HI> to our selves, <HI>How shall we escape—?</HI> Is our Salvation too small an Interest for our Concern? Are the matters of our Eternal Welfare mean and trivial? Have we any greater and more worthy care to take us up?</P>
<P>O therefore that Sinners would but give way to those <HI>just Fears</HI> which the Word of the Living GOD would excite in them! Would they but sit down and solemnly ask themselves, How think I to escape the Vengeance of GOD? What will become of me at long run? Is not GOD's Word true? Is the Wrath therein revealed against Im∣penitent Sinners sufferable? Can I be content to
<PB N="v" REF="001939_0006_0FBA26775665F688"/>
be the Object of it? What can be more terrible than the <HI>Words of his Curse?</HI> Why shou'd I <HI>bless my self</HI> and say, <HI>I shall have Peace? Can my heart endure, or my hands be strong, in the day when he shall deal with me?</HI> How can I read or hear the Threatnings of GOD's Law and not <HI>exceedingly fear and quake?</HI> Why should they not be to me in GOD's <HI>Word,</HI> and in the Mouth of his <HI>Ministers,</HI> as if I heard them from the <HI>burning Mountain,</HI> utter'd in <HI>Thunders</HI>? from the dark <HI>Cloud</HI> bursting with flashes of Fire? Can I be willing to be <HI>Damned?</HI> Am I come to <HI>that</HI> point, and easie in the Apprehension? Am I a Stock or a Stone? Is my Soul Iron or Marble? Will nothing make Impression on it? <HI>Do I not fear GOD being under Condemnation, and indeed justly?</HI> Have I considered what Damnation is? Is there any thing so fearful? Are any of our Fears <HI>equal</HI> to it? Why then do I not fear and <HI>fly</HI> from the Wrath of the Almighty? Why do I run upon his <HI>Bosses,</HI> and on the point of his Sword? Why do I dare his Vengeance? Why am I so secure and quiet while I lie open to it? Why do I not hearken <HI>now</HI> to my own <HI>Conscience</HI> and take its Alarms, before it change from a faithful <HI>Monitor</HI> into my Eternal furious Ene∣my, Avenger and <HI>Tormentor?</HI> Are its re∣morses and reproaches too uneasie now already to bear? But O the lashes and stings of it will be infinitely more torturing and peircing in the place
<PB N="vi" REF="001939_0007_0FBA2678CD424D68"/>
of Devils and of Despair; when the offer of Sal∣vation is never, never to be made again, and the Misery of Excision from GOD comes into actual bearing!</P>
<P>Thus methinks Sinners under the Gospel should be making their <HI>Reflections,</HI> cherishing those wise and proper <HI>Fears</HI> which are necessary to their effectual Excitation unto an instant and most earnest care for their own Salvation.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Treatise</HI> it self will supply the <HI>Rea∣der</HI> with a more labour'd and regular <HI>Train</HI> of tho'ts to this end. That which remains now for me to add is some <HI>Apology</HI> for my <HI>Self,</HI> that I have suffer'd my self to be prevail'd on by a dear <HI>Friend,</HI> my Reverend <HI>Brother,</HI> to put my Name before his Honour'd <HI>Parents</HI> Book, who is also to me a <HI>Father</HI> in Grace and Learning, and al∣most in Years. This Service to the Publick was intended by the late Reverend Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> of whose just Esteem and high Veneration for the <HI>Reverend Author,</HI> I have been long a Witness.</P>
<P>The Intelligent <HI>Reader</HI> will easily perceive how great a <HI>Master</HI> the <HI>Author</HI> is in practical Preaching, and how well studied and experienc'd he is in the Great Doctrines of our Holy Reli∣gion; and with what <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> he adapts his Studies to the Glory of God, and the Good of Souls. GOD <HI>the Father of Light, from Whom every good and perfect Gift comes
<PB N="vii" REF="001939_0008_0FBA267A49A763C8"/>
down,</HI> hath truly given him the <HI>Tongue of the Learned,</HI> to divide to every one his Portion, to please and profit, convince, perswade and di∣rect. It is in the <HI>calm and still Voice</HI> that the SPIRIT of GOD here comes near to the Soul; but O with what <HI>Light and Power,</HI> had the Words and the Will of Man any power to enlighten the mind, and constrain the heart. The Pages are here crouded, so that the <HI>Reader</HI> will find very much in a little room, and indeed many Heads in a few lines. The Gold may be gather'd in <HI>Ingots,</HI> and does not lye scatter'd in <HI>dust,</HI> nor beaten into <HI>leaves.</HI> And in short I esteem it a <HI>Book</HI> worthy of the attentive Read∣ing of <HI>Younger Ministers,</HI> and to be well di∣gested by them; who may form themselves not a little by it for the <HI>Pulpit;</HI> whereof such sort of <HI>Preaching</HI> is the true Glory; and serves most under the Blessing of GOD to the forming Souls for Heaven.</P>
<P>I Pray GOD that the Reverend <HI>Author</HI> may live long, to see the good Effect of <HI>these</HI> and all his <HI>Labours;</HI> in the just and high Esteem of his <HI>People,</HI> and in their profiting under his <HI>Mini∣stry;</HI> and to see his <HI>Learned Sons</HI> shining af∣ter him in an Excelling Sanctity and Usefulness.</P>

<P>—How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE more Light and Grace God manifests to Men in his trans∣actions with them about their Spi∣ritual and Eternal Welfare, the greater Obligation they are under to get a right understanding of their duty, and to yield a ready and willing obedience to it. The neglect hereof will most certainly make their ignorance and sinfulness more volunta∣ry and inexcusable, and their punishmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="2" REF="001939_0011_0FBA26808D3977B0"/>
more intollerable, The sinning again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the <HI>Law and Light of Nature,</HI> which discovered the Being and several of the Perfections of God, and directed to an honest, righteous and vertuous behaviour sufficiently vindica∣ted the righteousness of God in leaving the <HI>Gentle</HI> World to such dismal effects of his displeasure as he did. As the <HI>Apostle</HI> shews in <HI>Romans</HI> First &amp; Second <HI>Chapters.</HI> But the giving the <HI>Law</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> and by him to the <HI>People of Israel in the Wilderness</HI> was a dispen∣sation attended with more singular advan∣vantages; and therefore the contempt and violation of it exposed to greater and seve∣rer penalties, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.9.</P>
<P>AND since this, the <HI>Revelation</HI> of the gra∣cious purposes of God in the <HI>Gospel</HI> for re∣conciling and saving of both <HI>Jews and Gen∣tiles</HI> by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> doth in an especial man∣ner challenge the greatest regard from all those that are priviledged with it, and the neglect hereof will bring on a porportionable punishment. This is what we are informed in the <HI>Text</HI> now read.</P>
<P>OUR blessed Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> who shew'd an unparallel'd zeal for the Salvation of his Countrymen, as we read, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. <HI>begin.</HI> is most probably concluded to <HI>have wrote this Epistle to them</HI> (which in some <HI>Greek</HI> Copies of it is expressed) the special design where∣of
<PB N="3" REF="001939_0012_0FBA2681CDCCC6A0"/>
is to perswade them to, and confirm them in, the <HI>truth of the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> as be∣ing the promised Saviour of the World, in whom all the <HI>Types and Sacrifices of the Law</HI> had received their accomplishment, however he had been rejected and slighted by that unbelieving Generation. To which end he instructs them in the <HI>transcendent Excellency of his Person,</HI> both with respect to his <HI>Deity</HI> &amp; <HI>Humanity</HI>; and of his <HI>Offices</HI>; That as a <HI>Prophet</HI> he exceeded <HI>Moses,</HI> as a <HI>Priest</HI> he exceeded <HI>Aaron,</HI> as <HI>King &amp; Priest</HI> he exceed∣ed <HI>Melchisedeck.</HI> Having in the 1st <HI>verse</HI> exhorted to an earnest application and in∣tention of mind to the <HI>Doctrine of the Gospel</HI> delivered to them, he doth by several Ar∣guments inforce it in the <HI>Three</HI> following Verses. (1.) By a comparison taken from the Punishment annexed to disobedience to the <HI>Law,</HI> whence he argues a proportionable punishment shall be inflicted upon the neg∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecters of the Gospel Salvation. Verse 2. <HI>if the word spoken by Angels was stedfast, and ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y transgression received a just recompence of re∣ward, how shall we escape!</HI> God in giving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Law</HI> made use of the <HI>Ministry of Angels:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut he employed a more <HI>Glorious Person</HI> even <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is own Son</HI> in publishing his Grace in the Gospel; so that the slighting of this is more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggravated than the contempt of the Law,
<PB N="4" REF="001939_0013_0FBA268465AAEDD8"/>
both with respect to the gloriousness of the Person delivering it; God justly expecting that they who had slighted his Servants would yet <HI>reverence his Son,</HI> and receive his Message: and also with respect to the <HI>Grace and Love</HI> promised in it, beyond what any enjoy'd before. Therefore the neglect here∣of would be more sinful, than disobedience to the Law, and the punishment would be answerable. What the punishment shall be he doth not here expresly declare, but we may gather it from other Scriptures Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth not shall be damned.</HI> and <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.36. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1.89. But the <HI>manner of expression</HI> that the Apostle uses shews it to be very great. <HI>How shall we escape</HI>? It implies, there will be no way or means of escape, but certain unavoidable and inexpressible evil and misery will befa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those <HI>that neglect,</HI> that is, slight, disregard, undervalue or refuse the <HI>Great Salvation.</HI> It is the <HI>Gospel</HI> which is intended by this ex∣pression, is evident from the <HI>preceeding Verse▪</HI> for that which is there called the <HI>Word which we have heard,</HI> is here called <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> as also from the following Words, where it is said to be <HI>declared by the Lord, and further propagated by them that heard him.</HI> And the Gospel is called <HI>Salvation</HI> by a <HI>Metonimy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the office, for the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se</HI>; for it is the <HI>Grace o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>PROP. I. <HI>THAT Men need Salvation, even such Salvation as the Gospel reveals.</HI> This is a Truth necessarily implied in the <HI>Text,</HI> and the very offer of it supposes Mans ne∣cessity of it. It would be a reflection upon the Wisdom, Care and Mercy of God in contriving a way of Salvation, and reveal∣ing it to us, and urging it by so many ar∣guments upon us if we had no need of it. But it may be <HI>evidenc'd</HI> that the state of Men,
<PB N="7" REF="001939_0016_0FBA26900FF92450"/>
yea of all Men is such, that they have great and absolute need of Salvation, and a real sense and conviction hereof will be greatly serviceable to awaken and excite Men to a due concernment and sollicitude, that they may be interested in the Salvation offered to them. They that are pinch'd with a sense of wants are glad of relief. They that <HI>feel their Sickness</HI> will prize a <HI>Physitian.</HI> The Truth of this <HI>Proposition</HI> must be granted by all those that acknowledge Mans <HI>Apostacy</HI> and defection from his <HI>primitive Estate</HI>; and consider aright what are the dismal effects of it. <HI>Experience</HI> shows Man to be a crea∣ture full of, and subject to, abundance of misery; and the <HI>Scriptures</HI> gives us an account of the cause of it. Rom. 5.12. <HI>By one man sin entred into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</HI> The first <HI>Adam</HI> hath conveyed Sin and Death to all his wretched Progeny. All the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> by ordinary ge∣neration are together with him become sin∣ful and miserable, and consequently do stand in absolute need of Salvation. The Truth of the <HI>Proposition</HI> may be cleared up by considering,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHAT Mans natural Estate at present is.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WHAT is like to be consequent upon it here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="001939_0017_0FBA26918A6992B8" MS="y"/>3. <HI>HOW unable he is to relieve himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦able he is to relieve himself under his present misery or prevent what is future.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IF we look into Man's <HI>present natural Estate</HI> it will appear to be such as shews his absolute need of Salvation. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>EVERY man is naturally destitute of the Image of God,</HI> even of that knowledge of God, Righteousness and true Holiness, which was especially the Image of God up∣on him, according to which he was at first created. This was Man's peculiar dignity at first, which nothing else in this lower World was capable of; this was a greater honour to Man, than his Empire and Do∣minion over the World, because this ren∣der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him capable to glorify God and con∣verse with him, which is the highest honour that can be put upon a Creature; but this Man lost, and all Men have lost it together with him. Rom. 3.23. <HI>All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.</HI> Hence no Man naturally hath a Heart to know, to choose and love God as his chief good; to serve and glorify him as his last end; to seek after conformity to him, and communion with him as his true blessedness: but hath a disposition quite contrary hereunto. Now such a loss as this is an inconceivable misery:
<PB N="9" REF="001939_0018_0FBA26930AC9DF10"/>
for by reason hereof the primitive rectitude, harmony and beauty of the Soul is lost. Man is not like what he was when he came out of the hands of God. Surely Man needs to have such a loss repaired, and thereby his primitive health and beauty restored.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>THE Nature of Man is universally cor∣rupted.</HI> Original purity and rectitude being lost, there naturally follows an universal de∣filement and deformity upon the whole Soul, and it is wholly disordered and out of course in all those ways wherein it exerts itself. <HI>Gods Image</HI> being lost, <HI>Satans Image</HI> is intro∣duced. Instead of a holy there is a sinful nature, instead of purity, pollution. God himself gives that testimony concerning Man, Gen. 6.5. <HI>That the imagination of the thoughts of his heart, were only evil continually.</HI> Sinful motions do as naturally rise out of the heart as sparks from the Fire, or filthy steams from a Dunghill. And we find many holy Men in Scripture acknowledging and lamenting this natural pollution, con∣fessing its close adherence to them, from their first being and acting. So <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 51.5. <HI>Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.</HI> So the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 7.18 <HI>I know that in me (that is in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing,</HI> i e. Na∣ture considered in and of it self hath no
<PB N="10" REF="001939_0019_0FBA2694C111C5F0"/>
holy dispositions in it, and therefore will not produce any holy actions. In the same <HI>Context,</HI> he speaks of it not only as, <HI>impotent to good</HI> but <HI>full of contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry against it.</HI> Rising and rebelling against any thing that is holy when presented to, and excited in it; and holy <HI>Job</HI> is understood as bewailing the corruption of nature in that expression, Job 14.4. <HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean</HI>: intimating that all are by nature stained and defiled. And as this pollution extends to all Men so its contagion over∣spreads the <HI>whole man.</HI> Man is wholly corrupt; both Soul and Body are tainted with Sin, to allude to that, Isai. 1.6. <HI>From the crown of the head, to the sole of the foot, there is no part clean.</HI> Hence the Soul is naturally running to evil, and readily imbracing the sollicitations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it meets with; and <HI>the members of the Body are</HI> ready <HI>instruments of unrighteousness.</HI></P>
<P>THIS may be a little <HI>Illustrated</HI> in the <HI>several Faculties</HI> of the Soul.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Understanding,</HI> the leading Facul∣ty of the Soul is wholly corrupted. Hence full of mistakes and darkness in its appre∣hensions: erroneous in its judgment, foolish in its reasonings, evil in its designs, vain in its thoughts. Hence arises low and mean and unworthy thoughts of God. <HI>Psal.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="001939_0020_0FBA2696289A64D8"/>
50.21. When God offers himself as a fit portion and happiness for the Soul, it can see no amiableness in him, but prefers <HI>broken Cisterns</HI> before the <HI>Fountain of living waters.</HI> Hence it is so hardly and not without the powerful irradiation of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> convinced of its misery and wretchedness in its distance and estrangement from God. Sets light by the Offers of his Mercy and Favour that he makes. Can't see the evil of Sin, nor the good of Obedience. But <HI>calls evil good and good evil</HI>: and if at any time any thing that is vertuous be esteemed, its rather from some respect it bears to himself, then from its respect to the nature and will of God. How susceptive and tenacious of Error? How many carnal reasonings against the most Spiritural truths? What swarms of foolish impertinent, yea wicked &amp; hellish thoughts are starting up in the imagination and fan∣cy, and too often brooded and cherished there? What a treasure of folly and vanity is the mind of Man? Who that sees it and considers it will not with the Apostle see cause, to cry out, <HI>Oh wretched Man that I am,</HI> Rom. 7.24.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Will is corrupt,</HI> and discovers it self so to be in the various ways of its actings. Perverse in the choices it makes, preferring evil before good, or a seeming
<PB N="12" REF="001939_0021_0FBA2697B813CA08"/>
and imaginary before a real good: servile in its consent; being over-rul'd by a cor∣rupt judgment or vicious appetite. Tho' there be a natural instinct after happiness, yet thro' the corruption of it, it refuses it when offered, and doats upon a <HI>Sensual</HI> ra∣ther than a <HI>Spiritual</HI> felicity, suited to the na∣ture and capacity of the Soul: is tyrannical in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s commands, without and against all sanctified reason; obstinate in evil and a∣gainst good. So they express themselves, Jer. 1.25. <HI>We have loved strangers and after them we will go.</HI> And this is the ground of Christ's complaint against the <HI>Jews</HI> in his time, Joh. 5.49. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</HI> And thus God complains of his People: Their <HI>neck is as an iron sinew,</HI> Isai. 38.4. That would not hearken to him, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3.7.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Memory</HI> which should be the Treasury and Store-house of the Soul of proper and seasonable Truths, for its di∣rection and comfort, how unfaithful in its office? how ready to receive and entertain and produce what is evil, and to exclude and let slip what is good? How often doth God condemn and upbraid his people for their forgetfulness and incogitancy: <HI>Psal.</HI> 106.21. They forgot God their Saviour. <HI>Psal.</HI> 106.7. They remember'd not the
<PB N="13" REF="001939_0022_0FBA26996C66B6E8"/>
multitude of thy mercies, yea they soon forgot his works. And how much of the same disposition may we find; a forgetful∣ness of mercies and benefits, forgetfulness of vows and promises, forgetfulness of com∣mand's that are often urged, and repeated. Our memories are too like Sieves that let out the flower and retain the bran. Thro' the corruption of this faculty the same Sin becomes often repeated by us.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>Affections</HI> of the Soul are de∣praved and out of course. Hence those things that should be loved, desired and de∣lighted in, are disliked, rejected and hated; and those things which should be hated are loved. God himself who is an infinite, im∣mutable and everlasting Good, and should be loved with all the heart, soul and strength, is disregarded and slighted, and the perishing objects that the World offers, preferred above him. Hence you read, 2 Tim. 3.4. <HI>That they are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.</HI> Jer. 2.13. <HI>They have forsaken the fountain of living waters, and hew∣ed out to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.</HI> The Creature is preferred above the Creator, and Men are naturally seeking a false happiness in the profits, ho∣nours and pleasures of the present life, and neglecting a true and solid felicity in God.
<PB N="14" REF="001939_0023_0FBA269B4626BCD0"/>
Yea not only the perishing things of time are idoliz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and doated upon, but carnal and sinful objects, forbidden pleasures, such as corrupt, defile and debilitate the Soul, are eagerly pursued and inordinately delighted in. The like may be said of the passions of the Soul, grief, anger, fear, sorrow, these are readily carried to wrong objects.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>Conscience</HI> is also wofully cor∣rupted. Conscience is that power in Man whereby he was made capable to consider, review and pass a judgment upon his own actions. It is Gods monitor in the Soul, to accuse when we act contrary to the rule he hath given us, and to approve when we do what is right. But the mind being defiled <HI>Conscience is defiled</HI> also. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.15. Some∣times thro' ignorance it is sleepy and sense∣less, don't observe and condemn for sin as it ought, and sometimes approves what it should condemn. Sometimes thro' the pre∣vailency of corrupt affections, it looseth its authority, don't discharge its office, yea sometimes said to be <HI>seared as with a hot iron.</HI> There's no remorse for sin: no dread of fu∣ture Judgment: no care to have the guilt of Sin removed, the heart purified, and Justice attoned, as a preparation for it. Now the Soul in all its faculties being thus corrupted and vitiated, doth indispensably need Sal∣vation. Hence follows,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="15" REF="001939_0024_0FBA26A5197CEED0"/>(3.) <HI>A disposition and proneness to all kinds of actual Sin.</HI> Such a darkened understand∣ing, such a stubborn will, such a depraved state of Soul, must needs render it inclina∣ble to all kind of evil, and tho' thro' the temperament of the Body, Education, Em∣ployment or Company that persons are link'd with. Corrupt nature discovers and exerts it self in some more in one way, in others more in another: as the stream will run where the channel is cut. Yet there are no particular acts of sin that any have fallen into, but there is in the corrupt na∣ture of all, a disposition to act the same, that spirit of pride and self-love, that natu∣rally governs in every man would carry him hereunto, were an occasion and temptation offered. But tho' many are with-held from many particular ways of Sin that others commit: yet there are none in their natural state but are under the reigning power of Sin, and miserable tyranny of Satan; so that they run into numerous transgressions, in thought word and deed every day. The sense whereof caus'd that complaint in the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> Psal. 19.12. <HI>Who can understand his errors?</HI> and of that lamentation, Psal. 40.12. <HI>Innumerable evils compass me about, mine ini∣quities are gone over my head.</HI> If our actual sins are look'd into, they are like the hairs of
<PB N="16" REF="001939_0025_0FBA26A75C59FAF8"/>
our heads, or like the sands on the sea-shore, numerous and beyond account. He that makes the exactest inquiry into his life and actions that is possible, can't give account of <HI>one of a thousand,</HI> Job 9.3. Where he takes notice of one, a thousand will escape his observation. What duty, what act of our lives can we find that is free from sin? Yea should you single out the best duty that ever you performed, there might be found many sins intermingled with it. Now, <HI>the wages due to sin is death,</HI> Rom. 6.23. Every act of sin makes the sinner obnoxious to it, and binds the curse upon him. The righ∣teous law of God condemns for every trans∣gression of it: every sinful word, thought or action draws down vengeance on your head. So that every sinner stands liable to bear the curse of the Law whenever the justice of God will demand it of him. Were but Mens eyes opened to see their sins, the truth of the threatning, the inflexible severity of Justice, they would readily own that they are under an absolute necessity of Salvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT Men in their natural state <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed Salvation will further appear if we consider, <HI>What misery is consequent upon a sin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul state and sinful course of life.</HI> Sin is in it∣self the Souls greatest misery, and it hath
<PB N="17" REF="001939_0026_0FBA26A8CE4FAA70"/>
the greatest evils entail'd upon it. These might be enlarg'd upon, but I shall only hint at some under these Three Heads.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) ALL <HI>Temporal evils</HI> are the bitter fruits of Sin. <HI>Death</HI> with all its train of diseases, pains, wants, reproaches, jars and divisions among Mankind, which prove means of embittering life and hastning of death are the off-spring of Sin. <HI>Moses</HI> in <HI>Deut.</HI> 28.16, <HI>to the end,</HI> gives us a large account of the curses that Sin would bring upon the people of <HI>Israel.</HI> A sinner is in danger to be cur∣sed in his <HI>Body,</HI> in his <HI>Posterity,</HI> in his <HI>Name,</HI> in his <HI>Estate,</HI> in all his <HI>Designs and Under∣takings.</HI> Should any attempt to give a sum∣mary of the numerous evils that have be∣fallen Mankind since the entrance of Sin, and which have been the <HI>penal</HI> effects of it, they would soon be at a <HI>non-plus.</HI> These have been so various that it is impossible any impenitent sinner should know when he is secure, or be able to foresee what evils may befall him, while he is here in this World. While a sinner lies obnoxious to the curse of the Law in an impenitent and unreconcil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d estate, he is in daily danger of one tempo∣ral misery or other, which may either put a period to his life or embitter it to him; yea to that degree as to give him a kind of
<PB N="18" REF="001939_0027_0FBA26AA4DAEA7B0"/>
pre-possession of Hell upon Earth. Now were there no more then the present miseries that mankind are either groaning under or ob∣noxious to, they might justly awaken desires in them of the removal or moderation or sanctification of them; which is a part of the Salvation to be expected by Christ. But what is worse than this,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) SIN exposes Men to be <HI>Judicially left of God to Spiritual evils,</HI> and that of all sorts, of which Scripture and Experience affords abundance of sad <HI>Instances:</HI> Of <HI>some</HI> that have been left to sottishness and blind∣ness of mind, to security, sleepiness, seared∣ness and benumedness of conscience, so that their foolish hearts are darkened with false conceptions about the plainest and most important truths, and their consciences smite not as they ought for the vilest sins. Of <HI>others</HI> that have been left to embrace er∣rors. <HI>Others</HI> have been given up to vile affections, and whose hearts have been in∣curably <HI>hardened thro' the deceitfulness of sin.</HI> And hence with a desperate boldness rush on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> till despairing fears overwhelm their spirits, and a fearful expectation of Gods fiery indignation possesses their Souls, and they become like <HI>Pashur,</HI> who was threatned to be made <HI>a terror to himself and to his friends.</HI> No Sinner can tell how far a righteous God
<PB N="19" REF="001939_0028_0FBA26ABD4D3F860"/>
in way of punishment for Sin may suffer any of these spiritual plagues to befall him, in this life: therefore to be delivered from the danger of them ought to look'd upon as a most desirable mercy. And yet beyond these,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) EVERY Sinner is in danger of <HI>Eter∣nal miseries in the life to come.</HI> Eternal Death is a part of sins wages, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. Now this comprehends in it, <HI>all forts of evils</HI> both <HI>privative</HI> and <HI>positive,</HI> that either Body or Soul are capable of: and this in the extre∣mity and eternity of them. Our Lord Je∣sus Christ who will be the glorious Judge of the World tells us what sentance shall be pass'd upon the wicked at the last Day <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.41. <HI>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels,</HI> ver 40. <HI>These shall go away into everlasting punishment.</HI> The sentance is full of terror, and may justly rouze up the most sleepy and insensi∣ble sinners to tremble at it, and engage them with greatest intention of Soul, to apply themselves to the <HI>Blessed Jesus</HI> that <HI>saves from wrath to come.</HI> What comfort can he hope ever to enjoy, that shall never enjoy God? What ease can he ever hope to find that will be surrounded with everlasting flames? How vainly doth he bless himself, whom Christ will curse? I proceed,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="20" REF="001939_0029_0FBA26ADDE9AD2D8"/>3. TO shew <HI>Man's impotency</HI> to relieve himself under his present misery, or pre∣vent what is future. Right thoughts where∣of will evidence Salvation by another, to be of absolute necessity. Man hath destroy∣ed himself, but it is beyond his power to save himself. Many have attempted it, and it is no easy thing to convince Men of their insufficiency to do it. But it is a most cer∣tain truth that Men can't do this, For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) HE <HI>hath not power to recover his pri∣mitive holiness.</HI> Without holiness Man can∣not be happy; for the want of this renders him unmeet to enjoy God, wherein his hap∣piness consists. That he can't recover this is evident; <HI>partly,</HI> because the Image of God was put upon man at first by a creating power, and where-ever this is renewed it requires a like power. Nothing less than Almighty Grace is sufficient to determine the will of Man unto the choice and love of holiness. Psal. 10.3. <HI>Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power,</HI> and Eph. 2.10. <HI>Ye are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus to good works. Partly,</HI> because the deprava∣tion of the Soul thro' sin is universal; all the faculties of it are corrupted; they are all indisposed, none remain sound by which the rest should be repaired: the greatest argu∣ments,
<PB N="21" REF="001939_0030_0FBA26AF13C28C48"/>
the strongest perswasions, the greatest encouragements, that are set before Men, will not incline them to it, till victorious Grace effectually doth it. Phil. 2.13. <HI>It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his own good pleasure,</HI> and 2 Cor. 3.5. <HI>Not that we are sufficient of our selves to think, any thing as we ought, but our sufficiency is of God.</HI> And <HI>partly,</HI> because there is a natural, rooted enmity in the heart unto holiness. So that Man left to himself would never choose ho∣liness for his happiness. Rom. 8.7. <HI>The carnal mind is enmity against God, and is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> There is a fleshliness in the mind as well as in the affections which diverts the Soul from God, and inclines him to love himself above God; and the more holy and spiritual any command is the greater resistance and reni∣tence there is in the corrupt heart against it. The great controversy that Men have against Christ is his Government, <HI>They will not have him to rule over them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) HE can <HI>never recover the favour of God,</HI> nor by any act of his own regain the former peace and friendship that was be∣tween God and him, or do any thing that may entitle him to life. He can't fulfil the duty required in the <HI>First Covenant,</HI> which
<PB N="22" REF="001939_0031_0FBA26B047148FA0"/>
was <HI>perfect obedience to the law of God.</HI> Now every meer Man fails of this; he hath not only broken the law of God in his <HI>surety,</HI> but in his <HI>own person.</HI> Eccl. 7.20. <HI>There is not a just man upon earth that doth good and sinneth not▪</HI> and <HI>Jam.</HI> 3.2. <HI>In many things we all offend.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> once had a great opinion of his own righteousness: <HI>he was alive</HI> as he thought, <HI>Rom,</HI> 7.9. counted his observance of the law entitled him to life; but he afterward knew himself better, and tells us, <HI>When the commandment came sin revived and he died.</HI> When he understood the spiritual meaning and latitude of the law, all his confidence fail'd him, and he despair'd of life that way, and was willing not only to account his priviledges but his conscientiousness too to be, <HI>loss and dung that he might win Christ, and be found in him,</HI> Phil. 3.6,—9. It is not partial but perfect obe∣dience that the law promises life unto. If a Man has observed it in a thousand instan∣ces, and after fails but in one, the law con∣demns him presently, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10.</P>
<P><HI>NEITHER can he bear the penalty threatned,</HI> so as to satisfy the law, and procure his own release from the condemnatory sentence of of it that way; it is <HI>Death,</HI> even eternal Death that is the <HI>wages of sin.</HI> Whether God might not have pitch'd upon a lesser
<PB N="23" REF="001939_0032_0FBA26B349C8A768"/>
punishment for sin, and established it in his law is not for Man to determine. Reason tells us, that the punishment God hath threatned is suitable both in regard of the Majesty of God against whom sin is com∣mitted, and because it is little enough to deter Men from sin; but God having estab∣lished this, will proceed accordingly: now it is impossible that a sinner should procure his own discharge by bearing such a punishment. And indeed if Men could have satisfied for their own sins, Christ's Sufferings might have been spared.</P>
<P>I shall add a Word or two of <HI>APPLICA∣TION,</HI> before I pass to the next <HI>Proposition.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. TO <HI>Reprove</HI> the <HI>security and carelessness of such persons who live as if they had no need of Salvation</HI>: Though still in their sins, under the guilt and power of them, and obnoxi∣ous to all the misery that they expose them unto. It might be justly expected that they who have the guilt of all the sins of their whole lives lying upon them, and eve∣ry day liable to the strokes of Divine wrath and vengeance, which they are neither able to bear nor escape, should give themselves no rest till they are delivered from this guilt and danger; that nothing in the World should be able to afford any ease or peace to
<PB N="24" REF="001939_0033_0FBA26B580291B70"/>
them in this condition. But alas! how ma∣ny are to be found with whom it is quite o∣therwise, who are full of carnal mirth and jollity, altogether unconcern'd and insensi∣ble about any Soul wants or dangers: the guilt of sin is no burden to them, the wrath of God is no terror to them. And though they have the offers of Salvation daily sounding in their Ears, and repeated calls and encouragements to put in for a share in the blessedness offered, yet are unaffected and unconcerned about them. To promote the awakening of such sottish and sleepy sin∣ners, let me propose two or three things.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IF you are not convinced of your need of Salvation as in season duty to seek after it, <HI>Damnation will certainly be your por∣tion.</HI> For there is no middle state between these: it is not only a matter very probable that you will fall under the wrath and curse of God, and be cut off from hopes of mercy and comfort hereafter if you neglect this, but it is certain: the ruin of impenitent and unbelieving sinners is positively declared, Mar. 16.16. <HI>He that believeth not shall be damned▪</HI> and Rom. 2.4, 9. While those who receive and obey Christ, and accept Salvation by him, shall be admitted into Mansions of Joy and Glory, of Light and
<PB N="25" REF="001939_0034_0FBA26B676FEA4D0"/>
Immortality: you must be cast out into outer darkness where will be sorrow and shame, pain and grief, vexation and an∣guish. Were there any hopes of being hid from the revenging hand of God, or after a while that you should be annihilated and cease from the number of beings; or that your <HI>Spirits</HI> at Death like the <HI>Beasts should go downward,</HI> never any more to be regarded: this would be some plea to excuse your care∣lessness and security in this matter: but when it is certain that damnation and mi∣sery is like to be your portion and punish∣ment, continuing in this estate, your care∣lessness is inexcusable. Is <HI>Hell</HI> so easy a place, is the wrath of God so slight a mat∣ter, that you need not trouble your self with any concern to escape it? Can you tell what it is to bear the revenges of des∣pised Mercy and incensed Justice? Can you bear the weight of an Omnipotent One? The anguish of the never dying Worm? The burning heat of those Flames that never shall be extinguished? Surely <HI>destruction from God should be a terror to you!</HI> And the dread of damnation should make you concerned to obtain Salvation, and diligently to improve your opportunities in order to it!</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THERE is <HI>nothing in the world will make up the want of Salvation, or be a ground
<PB N="26" REF="001939_0035_0FBA26BC91293BF8"/>
of comfort to you under the feeling of Damnation.</HI> There are many things which secure sinners who are careless of their Salvation divert themselves with, and spend their time and thoughts about; some are anxiously pur∣suing the profits of the World, <HI>panting after the dust of the Earth,</HI> as if the acquiring of it would afford satisfying felicity to them, and they should be happy enough in com∣passing their desires for such things, though they had nothing laid up for Eternity; o∣thers are eagerly set to gratify the <HI>pleasures of sense,</HI> delight in mirth and jollity, in drink∣ing, gaming, wanton dalliances; shun seri∣ous thoughts as uncomfortable companions: others are big with desires and hopes of <HI>Honour and Perferment,</HI> of places of trust and distinction, and seek not the honour of be∣ing God's Children and Favourites; but supposing you could obtain all that profit, pleasure and honour that your largest wishes are reaching after, and in the end fail of Salvation, will these comfort you in the want of it? Surely our <HI>Saviour</HI> ought to be believed, when he tells us that Man will not be profited <HI>who gains the whole world and loses his own soul,</HI> Mat. 16.26. He makes a sad Bargain of it. Admit but a little serious debate with your own hearts and conscien∣ces now, and say, if such things can quiet
<PB N="27" REF="001939_0036_0FBA26C11EAF3980"/>
and comfort you now, when you compare your condition with those whom you have reason to think are got into a state of Salva∣tion. What tho' they have got their sins pardoned, which you have not, yet you have had these and those sensual delights and carnal pleasures, which they han't. While they have gotten a title to the Pro∣mises, an <HI>Heavenly Inheritance,</HI> you have got you a good House well furnished, and plen∣tiful accommodations for the World, which they want. While they are beloved of God, you are applauded, respected and honoured among Men. Will such thoughts refresh and satisfy you now, or rather will not conscience make sad reflections upon you? And how much more will it do so at the approaches of Death, and when you must appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ? when all such things shall appear to be trifles and vanities, no more able to relieve you than <HI>Dives</HI>'s former splendor did him when <HI>horribly tormented in the flames</HI> of Divine wrath.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) YOUR <HI>present carelessness and security is a sad symptom upon you, and plainly bespeaks your condition to be very dangerous.</HI> For from whence arises this indifferency and regard∣lessness about Salvation? Not from thence that they have no need of it, or can be safe
<PB N="28" REF="001939_0037_0FBA26C3347CA158"/>
without it: But it arises from the sleepiness of their consciences, and the blindness of their minds, and the hardness of their hearts. From the power that sin hath in them, or the influence that Satan hath over them: some are hardened thro' the deceitfulness of sin; that hearken to the flattering promises that it makes of profit and pleasure, that it will yield them; and their love to it blinds them that they can't see the evil of it, nor believe the danger attending of it, <HI>but pre∣sume they shall have peace tho' they walk after the imagination of their evil hearts</HI>: Please them∣selves that God either minds not their sins, or is not offended at them; or they <HI>put far away the evil day.</HI> Or it is from the power and influence of Satan over them, they are infatuated by him. The <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks of some, 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>Whose eyes the god of this world hath blinded, least the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine into them.</HI> And there are abundance of methods he uses to this pur∣pose, to strengthen false peace and an un∣grounded hope in them; which I shall not go about to enumerate. Now, the direct tendency of this security is to divert you from a due application of mind to the im∣provement of the means of Salvation; so that this blindness and security is a sad pre∣ludium and fore-runner of Damnation, and eventually proves so to many.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="29" REF="001939_0038_0FBA26C4CA331968"/>2. DOTH Man in his fallen estate need Salvation, let all such be perswaded, to <HI>ap∣ply themselves to get a right understanding, and thorough conviction of their need of it.</HI> Though all need it, yet, as you have heard, too ma∣ny han't a sense of their need of it: but are entertaining presumptuous and self flattering conceits of themselves; like <HI>Laodicea,</HI> Rev. 3.17. Think <HI>they are rich and encreased with goods and have need of nothing:</HI> they han't a sense of their wants and Soul dangers, and don't trouble themselves to seek after a re∣medy. It's not only a duty enjoyned by God but a point of wisdom for Men to know their own state; to pass a right judgment upon themselves; to know what the state of their Souls is, with reference to Eternity, it being of dangerous consequence for Men to <HI>think themselves something when they are no∣thing.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only urge by way of <HI>MOTIVE</HI> here,</P>
<P><HI>TILL you have a sense of your absolute and pe∣rishing need of Salvation, you will not be through∣ly concern'd to obtain it.</HI> 'Tis sense of the want, or apprehension of the worth of things that inkindles desires and excites endeavours in Men to obtain them. Now such is Mans natural aversion to God, and proneness to be at rest in his sins, that he will not be
<PB N="30" REF="001939_0039_0FBA26C621BD3500"/>
heartily concern'd for his favour and pardon∣ing mercy, till he understands and feels his guilt and misery. 'Tis the Curse drives Men to the Promise, and the dread of Justice to the Throne of Grace; a sight and sense of sin, that makes a Saviour with all his be∣nefits become precious, is necessary in the eyes of a sinner. The <HI>Prodigal Son</HI> never thinks of returning to his Father till he ap∣prehends himself <HI>perishing for want of Bread:</HI> Luk. 15.17. <HI>And when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hun∣ger.</HI> And Christ tells us, Mat. 9.12, 13. <HI>The whole need not the physician but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous but sinners to re∣pentance.</HI> And accordingly the invitations of the Gospel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> directed to such. Mat. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are hea∣vy laden, and I will give you rest.</HI> And, Isai. 55.1. <HI>Ho every one that thirsteth come to the waters of life, and he that hath no: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ey.</HI> Heb. 6.18. <HI>Who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before them.</HI> According to the sense Men have of their disease, so will be their cure and remedy. They that think they all nothing, or think that Kitchin Phy∣sick will cure them, enquire not after a <HI>Phy∣sician.</HI> They who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel not their load, re∣gard not offers of ease, none will prize
<PB N="31" REF="001939_0040_0FBA26C86970F2A0"/>
Bread but the hungry, nor value Waters but the thirsty; or make haste to the <HI>City of Refuge,</HI> but those that see the <HI>Avenger of Blood</HI> at their heels. Insensible sinners will make but little account of a Saviour; they who think they can attone for their own sins will not prize the Blood of Christ: they who think they can subdue their own lusts, and purify their own hearts, will not ap∣ply themselves to the regenerating, and sanctifying Spirit to do it for them. The slight careless person doth the work of an Age in a breath; we are all Sinners, but God is merciful; Christ dy'd for Sinners; and there's an end of their Law and Gospel work: This slightiness and superficialness is the great occasion why Men deceive and destroy themselves: It is for this reason es∣pecially therefore that this <HI>Proposition</HI> is so much insisted upon, that persons may be awakened from their self-flattering dreams, to serious consideration of their indispensible need of the Salvation that the Gospel re∣veals. Now to further a right sense hereof, let me offer the following Advice.</P>
<P N="1">1. HAVE a care of judging and deter∣mining your state by false rules, of comfort∣ing your selves with hopes of the goodness of your state upon fallible and uncertain
<PB N="32" REF="001939_0041_0FBA26C9C99F8810"/>
grounds. This is one thing that misleads many and hardens them in their security. If the rule be fallible the judgment you pass upon your selves by it can't be certain. Now there are many false rules by which Men are comforted. <HI>Some</HI> think their condition good because of their frequency in attending the external duties of Religion. This was the confidence of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> Luk. 18.11. <HI>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</HI> It is represented as a plea that shall be rejected by Christ, which yet some will make: Luk. 13.26. <HI>We have eaten and drank in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</HI> External duties of Religion may be fre∣quently attended and that with much seem∣ing devotion and seriousness, from custom, example and education, terrors of conscience, where there is no principle of Grace in the heart. <HI>Others</HI> are comforted upon account of their <HI>moral strictness,</HI> and the conscienti∣ousness of their carriages; they live soberly and righteously among Men, and dare not indulge themselves in such loose, vain and disorderly practices as some do: This was the confidence of the <HI>Young Man</HI> that came to Christ, Mar. 10.20. <HI>All these have I ob∣served from my youth.</HI> Morallity is amiable and commendable, but Men may be put up∣on this either out of respect to their Inte∣rest,
<PB N="33" REF="001939_0042_0FBA26CDF3958160"/>
or to promote their reputation and esteem among Men, or may be scar'd into it thro' terrors of Conscience and fears of Hell. Conscientious Men are not all holy. Again, <HI>Some</HI> comfort themselves because of the <HI>good affections</HI> that they feel many times stirring; they have relentings for sin, and can mourn for their sinful carriages; their hearts are sometimes enlarged in the duties of Worship they attend; they find some de∣light and joy in hearing of the Word, they are affected with the Sufferings of Christ, with the Glory of Heaven, have desires after Grace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but there are religious which are not gracious affections. There is a <HI>Legal</HI> as well as an <HI>Evangelical sorrow</HI> for sin. <HI>Judas</HI> was much affected with his sin, and as you read, repented. <HI>Ahab humbled himself.</HI> The Stony ground hearers <HI>received the word with joy,</HI> were much affected with it. Of <HI>Johns Baptists</HI> hearers you read, Joh. 3.35. <HI>That they were willing for a season to rejoyce in his light</HI>; were much awakened by and affected with his Ministry. The <HI>Foolish Virgins</HI> as you read, Mat. 25. <HI>Desired oyl,</HI> and that with some earnestness and concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Balaam</HI> was affected with the blessedness of the righ¦teous and desired it, <HI>Numh.</HI> 23.10. So that such working of affection can be no solid ground on which you may conclude your
<PB N="34" REF="001939_0043_0FBA26CF231A7EF8"/>
estate to be good; and to add no more, <HI>Some</HI> are attempting to comfort themselves because of some <HI>resemblances of Grace</HI> that they have; They desire to be justified by the Righteousness of Christ, they have a Love to some of the People of God; they have a Heart open to relieve those that are poor and necessitous; they have a zeal a∣gainst Sin; they are willing to own and defend the Cause of God, and to improve their Estates for the support of his Worship and Ordinances. But many such things as these may be found where there is no true Grace. A Man may desire to be justified by Christ's Righteousness, and yet not close with him upon the terms of the Gospel. Men desire abundance of things that they never attain. There may be Love to Good Men upon selfish motives, because they are related to them, or because they have been benefi∣cent towards them; not because they Love God or his Image appearing in them: and as for zeal against Sin, it is many times par∣tial or selfish. <HI>Jehu</HI> was zealous against the <HI>Idolatry</HI> of <HI>Baal</HI>; but his zeal was wild fire, not the fruit of holy Anger against Sin, and Love to the purity of God's Worship. And Men may be serviceable with their Estates to the Worship of God, where there is no true Grace. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.28. You read of things
<PB N="35" REF="001939_0044_0FBA26D162ED6030"/>
dedicated to the Treasury of the House of God, by <HI>Saul,</HI> by <HI>Abner,</HI> by <HI>Joab</HI> as well as others. Many carnal considerations may in∣duce Men to such things.</P>
<P N="2">2. BE willing to <HI>take pains to come to the knowledge of your condition,</HI> that you may see your state as it is. There are several <HI>Helps</HI> which should be used in order to it.</P>
<P N="1">1. SEARCH into and lay weight upon the <HI>Testimony God gives in his Word concerning it.</HI> The Word of God is a Glass that truly represents Mans natural deformity and mi∣sery. It is the great discoverer of the hearts of Men; it lays open the evil nature of sin, and shows the sad issues of it: it is greatly profitable for conviction as well as for com∣fort. It would be greatly to Sinners advan∣tage diligently to search into it, and medi∣tate upon it. <HI>By the Law is the knowledge of sin,</HI> Rom. 3.20. By the Word of God you are acquainted that there is an universal cor∣ruption and defilement cleaving to your na∣tures. <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.5. <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.5. <HI>Behold I was sha∣pen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.</HI> And Joh. 3.6. <HI>That which is born of the flesh is flesh.</HI> Sin like a strong poyson hath diffused itself thro' all the Blood and Spirits of <HI>Adam</HI>'s miserable progeny. It informs us that the noblest Faculties of the Soul are corrupted by it. Tit. 1.15. <HI>Their mind and
<PB N="36" REF="001939_0045_0FBA26D3A03BA1F8"/>
conscience is defiled</HI>: and if the leading and governing Faculties of the Soul are thus de∣praved, no wonder that the affections and passions are tumultuous and disordered. God whose prerogative it is to know the <HI>heart</HI> gives us this account of it. <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.9. That it is, <HI>deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.</HI> So that from such a heart nothing but Sin is propagated into the life and acti∣ons. Hence it comes to pass, that the <HI>plow∣ing of the wicked is sin</HI>; and their very <HI>pray∣ing an abomination to God.</HI> And again, see the account the <HI>Scripture</HI> gives you of your <HI>danger,</HI> it tells you, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.3. That you are <HI>Children of wrath by nature.</HI> It declares that the curse lies upon all that fail of the obe∣dience that the Law requires. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. It tells you, that <HI>God is angry with the wicked every day,</HI> Psal. 7.11. and in abundance of other places of alike nature God testifies to this truth. Now certainly you have reason to credit God's Testimony, who hath a most exact knowledge of Men and things, is of unspotted truth and of such infinite perfecti∣on, that he can be under no temptation to impose upon or deceive us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>LOOK over your past Lives,</HI> and review what <HI>numerous Sins</HI> have been acted in them. God hath endowed you with a power of re∣flecting upon your selves and your past acti∣ons,
<PB N="37" REF="001939_0046_0FBA26D505F98698"/>
and surely Conscience is not always so sottish and asleep but it may he summoned to do its office, even to bring Sin to remem∣brance, to <HI>shew you your transgressions, wherein you have</HI> either <HI>exceeded</HI> the limits of the com∣mand or been wanting to the duty he hath required. Why may you not retire your selves sometimes, and compare the Law of God and your Lives together? and seriously demand, Hath it been the business of your Lives to get the knowledge of God in his Nature, Subsistences, Properties? and to have a heart disposed to love him, trust in him, and reverence him as becomes his Perfecti∣ons? Hath it been your care to worship him according to his prescriptions? to <HI>sanctify his Name in your hearts,</HI> and to sanctify his <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> and account them <HI>holy of the Lord and honourable?</HI> or hath not the contrary hereunto been obvious in abundance of in∣stances? And view your carriages <HI>towards Men</HI>; Hath there not been numerous defects in the several <HI>Relations</HI> you have stood in, of a <HI>Ruler</HI> or a <HI>Subject,</HI> as a <HI>Husband,</HI> or a <HI>Wife</HI>: as a <HI>Parent</HI> or a <HI>Child</HI>; as a <HI>Master</HI> or <HI>Ser∣vant,</HI> have you fill'd up the Duty of these Relations, or hath there not been numerous deficiencies and disorders in them? Hath there been no <HI>rash and excessive anger</HI> boyling in your hearts against, and sometimes break∣ing

<P N="3">3. BE at pains to look into and <HI>get t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> knowledge of your own hearts, the deep polluti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of them, and the various workings of sin in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Self-flattery and security arises very muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from self-ignorance, especially from Men ignorance of their own hearts. Too ofte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is a great deal of vain and groundle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> confidence of the goodness of their <HI>hearts</HI> even in those that will acknowledge th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> errors of their <HI>lives</HI>; if therefore Men woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="39" REF="001939_0048_0FBA26DA562ABE60"/>
observe their own hearts and the manifold workings of sin in them, they would cer∣tainly acknowledge their need of sanctifying and pardoning Grace. Altho' the corrupti∣on of the heart maybe under restraint some∣times in natural Men; yet it doth not ordi∣narily lie so still and quiet but it may be seen upon a serious observation of your own hearts corruption, as well as Grace is an active principle, and <HI>like the oyntment of the right hand</HI> will <HI>bewray it self.</HI> There are se∣veral ways whereby Persons may come to a considerable insight into their own hearts, tho' exceeding deep and deceitful. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. BY <HI>tracing their actual Sins to their proper scource and fountain.</HI> Our <HI>Saviour</HI> teaches us this, when he tells us. Mat. 15.19. <HI>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulte∣ries, thefts, fornication, false witness, blasphemies.</HI> The heart is that <HI>root of bitterness</HI> that bears <HI>gall and wormwood.</HI> Jam. 4.1. <HI>From whence come wars and fightings among you, come they not hence, even of your lusts.</HI> Whence come Mens vain glorious boastings, and proud carriages, but from the pride of their hearts? Whence are their eager pursuits of the World to the neglect of their Souls, and to the un∣just prejudice of their Neighbours, but from the worldliness of their hearts? Whence are their injurious defamations of their <HI>Neigh∣bours,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="001939_0049_0FBA26DBF94F2480"/>
their murmuring against their <HI>Rulers,</HI> but from the envy and frowardness of their hearts? There is not a sinful word that ever came out of the Mouth, or an evil action done in the Life, but it was first conceived in the heart: besides innumerable motions of lust there which are suppressed by the restraints of Grace or Providence. How vile then must the heart be!</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OBSERVE the present actings of your own hearts.</HI> Much of the evil of the heart might be seen if Persons would take notice of them. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> upon experience of his own heart could say, that <HI>Sin wrought in him all manner of concupiscence,</HI> Rom. 7.8. Sin in the heart is working upon all occasions; Men may <HI>observe</HI> it upon <HI>the application of the com∣mand.</HI> When duty is enforced the heart is working in a way of enmity against it, mur∣muring at the strictness and holiness of the command; as tho' God were a hard Master. When sin is threatned or punished Men may observe the workings of the heart in a way of quarrelling, or repining at the justice of God; saying <HI>the way of the Lord is not equal.</HI> Men may <HI>observe</HI> the corrupt workings of their hearts <HI>under the Providences</HI> of God, whe∣ther <HI>merciful</HI> or <HI>afflictive.</HI> If God bestows <HI>Prosperity,</HI> how soon do Men forget God, and despise their Neighbours? How ready
<PB N="41" REF="001939_0050_0FBA26DF85A36F88"/>
to fall into self-admiration as if their own righteousness had deserved it? and how apt with him, <HI>Luke</HI> 12.20. to please themselves with the hopes of lasting felicity here? and presently to pervert the blessings of God to wrong ends? If God brings <HI>Affliction</HI> upon a Man and crosses him in some darling com∣fort or interest, how presently may a Man observe his heart to swell with impatience, and to vent itself in undue complainings or repinings against God? Why it should be thus with them when others are spared from the like mishaps. See this exemplified in, <HI>Psal.</HI> 73. <HI>begin.</HI> Again, <HI>Observe</HI> the heart in <HI>Duties of Religion,</HI> either as to the <HI>manner</HI> of doing them; with what <HI>relunctancy or forma∣lity and superficialness.</HI> What <HI>dulness, weari∣ness</HI>? without the exercise of that Faith in God, holy breathings of Soul after him, or real brokenness of heart for the sins confessed before him▪ or as to your <HI>Ends</HI> in them. What <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pocrisy, self-seeking,</HI> and <HI>carnal respects</HI> governs the heart, rather than respect to the Divine Command, or gracious breathing; after Communion with God? You might see reason from these and such like workings to assent to that of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> Rom. 7.18. <HI>I know that in me (that is in my flesh) dwelieth no good thing</HI> Or to cry out with the <HI>Leper, Unclean, Unclean</HI>!</P>

<HI>Name is Wonderful,</HI> and is eminently so in his <HI>Person,</HI> having the Natures of <HI>God &amp; Man,</HI> mysteriously united in <HI>One Person</HI>: in which work the glorious condescention, wisdom and grace of God eminently shines forth: we needed such a <HI>Days Man as might lay his hand upon both</HI>; a meet Person to transact with an offended God, and to personate and be a surety for Man. Now that he is such a One our <HI>Apostle</HI> particularly shews in the Two First <HI>Chapters</HI> of this <HI>Epistle,</HI> as you may read at leisure. The realliy of both Natures in the Person of Christ the <HI>Scriptures</HI> take care particularly to inform us. The Gospel declares him to be <HI>truly Man</HI>; it gives us the <HI>History</HI> of his <HI>Birth,</HI> of his <HI>Childhood</HI> and <HI>Man∣hood,</HI> and that by degrees he arriv'd at it, as is common for all Men. He <HI>grew in wisdom and stature,</HI> Luk. 2.52. He did the <HI>actions,</HI> and had the <HI>properties</HI> of a real <HI>Body</HI>: he eat, he drank, he slept, he walk'd, he dis∣coursed. He had not the <HI>meer appearance</HI> of a Body, (as some <HI>Hereticks</HI> formerly have taught,) but a true and <HI>real Body, that was prepared for him.</HI> This is undeniably evident by his <HI>SUFFERRINGS</HI>; his Sufferings were <HI>real</HI> which procured <HI>groans</HI> and <HI>tears,</HI> as they are wont to do from humane Bodies; and his <HI>Death</HI> was real, <HI>He became obedient unto death even the death of the cross</HI>; and he there∣fore

took our Nature that he might be a Re∣deemer for us and not for <HI>Angels,</HI> Heb. 2.16.</P>
<P>AND the <HI>Scripture</HI> shews that he was <HI>truly God.</HI> This is plain from <HI>express</HI> Scripture <HI>Testimonies.</HI> Heb. 1.3. <HI>The express image of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Person:</HI> and, Joh. 1.14. <HI>We beheld his glory a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the glory of the only begotten Son.</HI> Joh. 10.30 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>and my Father are one,</HI> (i.e.) One in <HI>Essence</HI> His God-Head appeared by the many <HI>mira∣culous operations</HI> that he wrought.

Now he that had power to work miracles himself, and could enable others to work them is truly GOD.</P>
<P>IT might also be argued from his <HI>Autho∣rity to forgive sins, His clear knowledge of Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearts;</HI> from the <HI>Properties</HI> ascribed to him,
<PB N="49" REF="001939_0058_0FBA26F91D324DE0"/>
the <HI>Titles</HI> given him. But I design only some <HI>hints</HI> at these <HI>Great Truths,</HI> which are among the <HI>Fundamentals</HI> of our <HI>Faith,</HI> and on which so much of our <HI>Comfort by Christ</HI> doth depend.</P>
<P>THE necessity of his being such a <HI>Won∣derful Person,</HI> is shewn in the Gospel, that he might be qualified for the Offices he sustains, <HI>Prophetical, Priestly</HI> and <HI>Kingly</HI>; that he might reveal Divine Truths clearly, con∣vincingly and effectually to the hearts and consciences of Men, and yet in such a way as Men might be able to bear them: that he might perform perfect Obedience to the Law for us, to purchase a right to Life according to the First Covenant, and to suffer the Curse and Penalty of the Law for us, that satisfaction might be given to offended Justice in our name and stead, &amp; that these Suffer∣ings might be acceptable and meritorious. As <HI>God</HI> he could not suffer, as <HI>Man</HI> he could not satisfy by suffering, but as <HI>God-Man</HI> he could do both. And that he might render his Government amiable to us he appears in our nature, and that his power in the execu∣tion of his Authority might be sufficient to restrain and destroy all his and our enemies, he exercises it in his <HI>Divine Nature.</HI> Some of these things may be hereafter further en∣larged upon.</P>

Merit of Christ may be graciously applied to him: though the Salvation revealed in the Gospel is a <HI>Doctrine of Grace,</HI> yet it is not promiscuously thurst upon Men whether they will or no: but God dispenses it in a way suitable to his <HI>own Honour</HI> and the Sinners <HI>Comfort.</HI> God expects not from the sinner a valuable compensation for it, or any perso∣nal worthiness to recommend the sinner to his acceptance. <HI>Salvation</HI> is for the <HI>misera∣ble; Pardon</HI> for the <HI>Guilty.</HI> But yet there are <HI>Duties</HI> to be done by those that expect to be the subjects of it, and it hinders not their being our duties, though it is by his Grace efficaciously working in us that we are enabled to do them: they may not un∣fitly be called <HI>parts</HI> of the <HI>Salvation</HI> which the Gospel offers, or the <HI>Inchoation</HI> of it. Now these are,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>FAITH in the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Which is a Grace variously <HI>expressed</HI> and <HI>described</HI> in the Scripture, suitably to the <HI>state</HI> of a sin∣ner: it's said to be a <HI>Coming to Christ.</HI> Joh. 6.37. <HI>Him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Which implies the lost state of a Soul wandring up and down for succour and finding none, upon Christ's call <HI>comes to him.</HI> It's express'd by <HI>receiving Chirst.</HI> Joh. 1.12. <HI>As many as received him.</HI> &amp;c.

<PB N="52" REF="001939_0061_0FBA2705CD195908"/>
famishing Souls as the <HI>Bread of God that gives life to the World.</HI> It's express'd by <HI>fleeing to Christ for refuge</HI> to lay hold <HI>of the hope set before us,</HI> Heb. 6.18. Because the Soul con∣cern'd for safety and life by Christ is driven by the terrors of the Law, is pursued by re∣venging Justice, and unable to deliver it∣self: it's express'd by <HI>Leaning upon Christ.</HI> Cant. 8.5. <HI>Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness, leaning on her beloved.</HI> This im∣plies that such a Soul is sinking under the burden of guilt and wrath, and betakes it∣self to Christ for <HI>support.</HI> Again, it is ex∣press'd by <HI>sitting under Christ's shadow,</HI> Cant. 2.3. Because such Souls are as it were scorched with a sense of God's wrath. The wrath of a provoked God is a terrible thing to a sensible sinner, which none can screen and defend the Soul from. Christ Jesus is the only shelter. The <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> makes use of such <HI>Metaphors</HI> from things so plain and fa∣miliar, that the nature of this necessary Grace may be the <HI>better understood.</HI> That <HI>Faith</HI> which justifies a sinner is not meerly an <HI>assent to a Proposition,</HI> but is an <HI>act of the will,</HI> as well as of the understanding, whereby a sensible and law-condemned sinner, convinced of the truth of the Gospel, and of the suffici∣ency of Christ to answer the necessities of his Soul, accepts the offer of him that God
<PB N="53" REF="001939_0062_0FBA2707649DFA48"/>
makes, consents to take him as a compleat Saviour, intirely depends and relies upon him for Righteousness, Grace and Life. This <HI>Faith</HI> is <HI>God's Gift,</HI> Eph. 2.8. and the effect of the <HI>Fathers drawing,</HI> Joh. 6.44.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>REPENTANCE</HI> is another duty which the Gospel requires, and which Christ as a <HI>Saviour</HI> bestows, <HI>Act.</HI> 5.31. That Faith which is true is ever accompanied with E∣vangelical mourning and brokenness of heart for sin, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. This is necessa∣rily required to our participation in the com∣forts of the Gospel. It is a part of Christ's Office to <HI>bind up the broken hearted,</HI> Isai. 61.1. Accordingly <HI>Repentance</HI> is a duty often press'd in the Gospel, and hath promises annexed to it. It was the command of Christ to his <HI>Apostles</HI> when he <HI>sent them forth,</HI> Luk. 24.47. That Repentance and remission of Sins, should be Preached in his Name, and ac∣cordingly they did so, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38. <HI>Repent and be baptized every one of you, for the remission of sins.</HI> And, Act. 3.19. <HI>Repent and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.</HI> In vain do <HI>impenitent</HI> Sinners promise themselves Salva∣tion by Christ: while Men love their sins, and live in them, or don't relent for them, or unaffected with the dishonour and wrong done to God by them, they have the hearts
<PB N="54" REF="001939_0063_0FBA2708C8161568"/>
of <HI>Enemies toward God,</HI> and must expect to be dealt with accordingly.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>A Life of sincere Obedience</HI> is also re∣quired of those that would be the heirs of Salvation. You read, Heb. 5.9. <HI>He became the author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</HI> It was one end of Christ's Suffer∣ings, <HI>that he might purify to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works,</HI> Tit. 2.13. And it is the property of a true Faith to <HI>purify the heart,</HI> Act. 15.9. The more it is exercised the more the work of Sanctification is car∣ried on: it not only shews the <HI>reasonableness of Obedience,</HI> for the honour of the Redeemer, but it <HI>directs the Soul to Christ</HI> as the <HI>Fountain</HI> of all Grace and spiritual Life: it realizes the truth of the Promises, encourages and enables the Soul to submit to Christ's Go∣vernment, to choose his Laws, to follow the conduct of his Word and Spirit, to have a respect to all his Commands, knowing that none but <HI>the pure in heart shall see God,</HI> Mat. 5.8. I shall add,</P>
<P N="5">5. THE Gospel is the <HI>great Means</HI> or In∣strument God makes use of for the <HI>Applica∣tion of the Salvation</HI> that it reveals, to the Souls of Men. Hence the <HI>Apostle,</HI> Rom. 1.6. calls it, the <HI>power of God unto Salvation.</HI> Inas∣much as God in and by it is wont to exert the power of his Grace in gaining the
<PB N="55" REF="001939_0064_0FBA270BE772D0E0"/>
hearts of Men to a thankful acceptance of the Salvation therein offered unto them. The Gospel doth not barely bring a report to us, that Salvation is attainable, but it is a <HI>Doctrine</HI> propounded in <HI>God's Name,</HI> cloathed with his <HI>Authority,</HI> and accompanied with his <HI>Presence,</HI> so far (as to some at least) that it becomes effectual to convey the priviledges purchased by Christ and contained in it. Hence St. <HI>Paul</HI> commits Believers <HI>unto God and the word of his Grace,</HI> as that which is <HI>able to build them up and give them an inheri∣tance among them that are sanctified,</HI> Acts 20.32. And it is called, Jam. 1.24. <HI>The ingrafted word which is able to save our Souls.</HI> This may more fully appear by looking upon <HI>some spe∣cial benefits</HI> that are ascribed to it.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is the <HI>special means</HI> made use of by the <HI>Spirit</HI> in the <HI>work of Regeneration.</HI> For this reason as well as others, it may be that it is called the <HI>Word of Life.</HI> The convey∣ing of spiritual Life to a Soul dead in sins and trespasses is the first thing that prepares a Soul for an actual interest in the Salvation purchased by Christ. Till there be a <HI>spirit of Life,</HI> there can be no acts of Life in Faith, Repentance, or any other Graces. Now this is wrought <HI>by the Word.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.23. <HI>We are born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incor∣ruptible by the word of God.</HI> And, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.18.
<PB N="56" REF="001939_0065_0FBA270D99613140"/>
<HI>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.</HI> As God <HI>created</HI> all things at first by his <HI>Al∣mighty Word,</HI> he <HI>spake and it was done, he com∣manded and it flood fast.</HI> So when any Soul is created again <HI>in righteousness and true holi∣ness,</HI> it is done by his <HI>Almighty power</HI> accom∣panying <HI>his Word</HI>; this power is not inhe∣rent in the Word itself, but it is mighty thro' God whenever he pleases to give efficacy to it.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IT is the <HI>special means</HI> of <HI>begetting of Faith,</HI> that Faith whereby Men are united to Christ, and made partakers of his Righte∣ousness. This is declared, Rom. 10.17. <HI>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</HI> In order to believing, it is necessa∣ry that there be a <HI>Revelation</HI> of a suitable ob∣ject of Faith, that there be an offer of this to the sinner, that this revelation and offer be credibly attested to be from God. Now God doth all this by the Gospel: Christ is there <HI>revealed</HI> as the <HI>end of the Law for righte∣ousness, to every one that believeth.</HI> There is an <HI>offer made</HI> and plentiful assurance given to the truth of its being <HI>from God.</HI> What <HI>Paul</HI> said to the convinced <HI>Jaylor</HI> is the voice of the Gospel to every Sinner. Acts 16.31. <HI>Be∣lieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.</HI> It is the <HI>Promise</HI> of the Gospel that is the <HI>Warrant</HI> for <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="57" REF="001939_0066_0FBA270F8C3CE388"/>(3.) THE Word is the great <HI>means of Sanctification,</HI> of <HI>purging out sin and perfecting holiness</HI> in the heart. Christ prays for his <HI>Disciples.</HI> Joh. 17.17. <HI>Sanctify them by thy truth, thy word is truth.</HI> Sanctification is a work that is carried on progressively, the <HI>New Creature</HI> gradually arrives to its <HI>Per∣fection.</HI> Now as a means of advancing this we are directed, 1 Pet. 2.2. <HI>As new born babes to desire the sincere milk of the word, that we may grow thereby.</HI> God in the Gospel prescribes us rules of holiness, tells us <HI>how we should walk and please God</HI>; how we should walk in <HI>every Relation</HI> and <HI>Condition</HI>: it teacheth us <HI>to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in the World,</HI> Tit. 2.12. And it gives the most pro∣per encouragements to holiness, and the most weighty and pressing dehortations from sin. Now when these are believed they be∣come greatly serviceable to promote holi∣ness both in heart and life.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) THE Gospel is the means of <HI>convey∣ing, Comfort, Joy and Peace,</HI> to the Souls of Believers. They stand in need of <HI>Comfort</HI> upon many accounts; <HI>partly,</HI> in regard of the various troubles, trials and sufferings that they are exposed to in the World. The World hates them because of their love to Christ: <HI>partly,</HI> in respect to the temptati∣ons
<PB N="58" REF="001939_0067_0FBA27110E48C8B8"/>
and accusations of Satan, he envies them their happiness and their hopes of it, doth what in him lies to weaken it, &amp; suggests ma∣ny discouragements to their hearts, that they are sometimes ready to sink under: &amp; <HI>partly,</HI> in respect to those guilty fears that arise in their own Consciences. Man being a guilty is thereby become a very jealous suspicious Creature, and needs some powerful supports against these accusations and fears. Now the way of <HI>Comfort</HI> which God hath provided is not by <HI>Visions</HI> and <HI>Voices from Heaven,</HI> but by the <HI>Word of promise</HI> in the <HI>Gospel</HI>; by <HI>this</HI> he <HI>gives strong Consolation unto the heirs of salva∣tion,</HI> Heb. 6.17, 18. Applying of them according to the various conditions and ne∣cessities of his People. I pass to some <HI>AP∣PLICATION</HI> of this.</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> HOW <HI>exceeding thankful</HI> ought we to be for the <HI>Gospel</HI> upon this account, that it lays open and reveals a way of Sal∣vation for guilty Man. A thing so great that all the wisdom of the World could ne∣ver have discovered. A <HI>perpetual night of darkness</HI> had for ever overspread the face of the World, and the whole race of Mankind had been involv'd in guilt and despair, and under a <HI>fearful expectation of God's fiery indig∣nation,</HI> if God hath not scattered it, by the
<PB N="59" REF="001939_0068_0FBA271288FF7B68"/>
breaking forth of the Light of the Gospel. We that are priviledged with it are under special Obligations to be thankful for it.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IN that it is an <HI>Act of special Grace and Mercy.</HI> God was under no obligation to Man to do this for him. Men have no moral excellencies to commend them to God. Sin had distroyed him of his native beauty, made him loathsome before God, <HI>Who is of purer Eyes then to behold iniquities.</HI> There was no such thing <HI>due</HI> to Man in a way of Justice. Yea, Justice was engaged a∣gainst him, and with its <HI>flaming Sword, kept the way to the tree of Life.</HI> God stood in <HI>no need</HI> of Man's Friendship and Salvation: he could otherways have provided for his own honour; or had he seen meet, contented himself to have glorified his Mercy upon the holy Angels, and his Justice upon fal∣len Angels and Men. God's manifestation of his Glorious Perfections is <HI>purely Arbitrary.</HI> He might have conceal'd them as through a vast Eternity he had done. Further God was <HI>in no fear of Man,</HI> to move him to it. Men spare Offenders sometimes thro' fear, but God fears no Man's anger. <HI>All nations are</HI> counted <HI>to him lighter than nothing and va∣nity.</HI> Had God executed upon <HI>Adam,</HI> and all his sinful progeny, the threatning of the first Covenant, there could have been no in∣justice
<PB N="60" REF="001939_0069_0FBA271507C6C4B8"/>
or unreasonable severity imputed to him. I know that the carnal minds of Men are prone to cavil at the Justice of God in the imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, to them who had no actual being at that time, and never gave their <HI>personal consent</HI> to the <HI>Covenant</HI> transaction between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>him</HI>: but the <HI>Equity</HI> of this might be evinc'd, <HI>partly,</HI> from the unspotted <HI>purity</HI> of God, <HI>who is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works,</HI> Psal. 147.17. is subject to no error or partiallity in any of his Administrations: <HI>partly,</HI> from the <HI>common reason</HI> of Mankind, which allows it to be both just and necessary in many ca∣ses for <HI>Children</HI> to act by their <HI>Parents,</HI> and <HI>People</HI> by their <HI>Representatives,</HI> and count themselves <HI>bound by their Act.

<HEAD><HI>PROPOSITION III.</HI> THAT the Salvation Revealed and Offer∣ed in the Gospel is very Great and Glo∣rious.</HEAD>
<P>CARRYING in it the brightest displays of the Divine Glory; containing in it the greatest Mercy. The <HI>Apostle</HI> calls it, <HI>Great Salvation:</HI> the manner of his expression is worth our Observation, <HI>SO Great Salvation.</HI> Which may denote the inexpressible, yea, in∣conceivable Greatness of it! A Salvation beyond any other that God hath ever vouch∣safed to Men. Many great Salvations God hath wrought since the beginning of the World, but the Salvation of Sinners by <HI>Je∣sus Christ</HI> is beyond all comparison. We have an expression parallel hereunto, Joh. 3.16. <HI>God so loved the world that he gave his only be∣gotten Son. So</HI> as can't be told. The love ap∣pearing in this <HI>Gift</HI> is inexpressible! We read concerning the <HI>Works</HI> of God in general that they are <HI>Great!</HI> Honourable and Glorious, <HI>Psal.</HI> 111.2, 3. The works of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> are so, they may fill the hearts of considerate beholders, with wonder and astonishment; such as the highest flights of humane understanding cannot penetrate in∣to:
<PB N="74" REF="001939_0083_0FBA273A009F2630"/>
and it is eminently true of this <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Redemption,</HI> or the Salvation of Sinners by Jesus Christ; for which the Praises of God will be celebrated throughout the days of E∣ternity. There are so many great and my∣sterious things concurring to it and con∣tained in it, such inestimable blessings ac∣companying of it as may justly render it <HI>marvellous</HI> in our eyes. Fully to declare the greatness of this Salvation is possible only u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an understanding capable of comprehending it. I shall only attempt at some <HI>few him</HI> that may give us reason to assent to the <HI>man∣ner of expression</HI> as highly suitable.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF we consider how <HI>great difficulties la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the way of it, and what a <HI>glorious dis∣play of the Divine Perfections</HI> there is in bring∣ing it to pass. Such works as are not with∣out great difficulty brought to pass are wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be accounted great. Now this work o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saving Sinners had such difficulties in the way of it, as quite exceeded the Wisdom of Men or Angels to remove. It was beyond them to determine how the Sinner should be saved, and Sin condemned. How <HI>Mercy</HI> might be exercised, and the rights of <HI>Justice</HI> not impaired. How the honour of Gods <HI>Truth</HI> in the threatning of Death to sin could be vindicated without the <HI>Death of the Sinner.</HI> How the ruling <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God in establish∣ing
<PB N="75" REF="001939_0084_0FBA273BCA75FA80"/>
a Law by which Mankind should be go∣verned, could be manifested unless Divine <HI>Justice</HI> did proceed according to it: and how this could be done and Man preserved from everlasting ruin was above their com∣prehension. But the Wisdom of God hath surmounted all these difficulties, in bringing about this great work, it is so established that there is no breach in the harmony of the <HI>Divine Attributes.</HI> The <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God hath pitched upon such a way wherein his <HI>Truth, Justice</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> might all be <HI>Glorified.</HI> As the <HI>Psalmist</HI> observes, Psal. 85.10. <HI>Mercy and truth have met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</HI> Beside there is a glo∣rious display of the <HI>God-Head</HI> and its per∣fections. Much of the Divine Glory and par∣ticularly that sacred Mystery of the <HI>Trinity of Persons in the God-Head,</HI> is more revealed in this work than ever it was before: God the <HI>Father</HI> contriving, God the <HI>Son</HI> per∣forming, God the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> applying Salva∣tion for and to fallen Man. This <HI>Counsel of Peace</HI> was among these <HI>Sacred Persons</HI> before time, but their particular and distinct opera∣tions in and about it are in time exhibited in the Gospel to raise our admiration and prai∣ses! and <HI>herein</HI> the glorious <HI>Perfections</HI> of the <HI>God-head</HI> are displayed more than in any o∣ther Works.</HI> The <HI>Power, Wisdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Good∣ness</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="001939_0085_0FBA274013A0BFF0"/>
of God, which appeared in <HI>Creation,</HI> in the variety of Creatures that were made, and adapting of them to their respective ends, appears in this work with a yet grea∣ter lustre; and over and above, God's <HI>Holi∣ness, Truth, Justice and Mercy,</HI> shine forth in their transcendent excellencies: the glory of the Divine Perfections did never so display itself as it doth in this wonderful work of bringing about Salvation for sinful Man. Insomuch that you read that the <HI>Heavenly Spirits</HI> desire to stoop down and <HI>look into this wonderful work,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.12. that they might solace themselves with the manifestations of divine Glory appearing herein, and have their love and praise excited upon the occasion of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT may appear so if we consider <HI>how great and glorious a Person</HI> was employed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> purchase Salvation for us. This work was undertaken by the <HI>Son of God</HI> himself, and obtained through his <HI>Incarnation, Obedience, Sufferings, Resurrection</HI> and <HI>Intercession.</HI> We may justly infer the greatness of the work from the glorious dignity of the Person em∣ployed about it. No other than the only <HI>Son of God's love, in whom he was well pleased,</HI> was found worthy or capable to manage such an affair. Now the Son of God being so highly esteemed, so dearly beloved of him▪
<PB N="77" REF="001939_0086_0FBA2741D9BB20B0"/>
never have been employed about a trifle or small matter. The conservation and manifestation of the divine Glory requir'd that so great a Person should be entrusted with this work. You read in 1 Pet. 1.18. <HI>We are not redeemed with, corruptible things, as silver and gold.</HI> No such price was of value sufficient for the Redemption of a Soul; much less of all the Souls of the <HI>Elect</HI>; but it must be the <HI>precious Blood of Christ,</HI> of <HI>God Incarnate</HI> to procure such an inestimable be∣nefit, otherways that might be thought of were insufficient. There was no hopes of Mans re-entry into Paradise to make a new trial of his Fidelity to the first Covenant; that made no promises to Repentance being once broken, and that was guarded against him: there was no hope of having life <HI>by the Law</HI> that was <HI>become weak through the flesh,</HI> Rom. 8.3. Mans sinfulness had rendred him obnoxious <HI>to Death</HI> by it, and uncapable to perform the righteousness it required of him, so far as would be accepted for his Justifica∣tion; nor would any of the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> or <HI>Cere∣monial</HI> purifications of the Law avail here∣unto. <HI>It was not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin.</HI> All these Ce∣remonial rites could not take away the guilt of sin; nor any further relieve the consciences of Men, then as they di∣rected
<PB N="78" REF="001939_0087_0FBA2745967A3620"/>
them to look to the <HI>Great Sacrifice</HI> which they were appointed to <HI>Typifie</HI> and represent; nor were they ever designed by God in their institution and establishment to an higher end. Yea it was a work too great for an <HI>Angel</HI> to have performed: for an infi∣nite wrath would have been a burthen too heavy for any meer creature to have endured. Nor would there have been that worth and value in the services and sufferings of any creature, or indeed of all creatures, as the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is in the satisfaction made by <HI>Christ.</HI> Now the greatness of this Salvation in respect of the <HI>Person</HI> employed for the purchase of it▪ might be here further <HI>Illustrated</HI> by consider∣ing what he doth in order to it.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) HE <HI>assumes an humane Nature into per∣sonal union with his Divinity.</HI> This is a Doctrine that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> do very expresly and largely insist upon, as might be shewn in abundance of Places, and do also declare to us why it was necessary he should do this; that he might be a fit Person to sustain the office of a <HI>Surety</HI> in our stead, being one that had a true humane Nature, was fit to perso∣nate Man, and to satisfy for him, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.16. The reason why the <HI>fallen Angels</HI> are not sa∣ved is, because there is no Surety provided in <HI>their Natures,</HI> to transact for them. But Christ Jesus assumed the <HI>Nature of Man</HI> that
<PB N="79" REF="001939_0088_0FBA27470C0F7A88"/>
he might make satisfaction in the Nature that had sinned; and therefore a <HI>body was prepared for him,</HI> as he informs us; because other <HI>Sacrifices</HI> were not sufficient, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.5,—10. Now this was a great, a glorious and wonderful thing! that the Humane Na∣ture should be thus <HI>exalted,</HI> and that he who was the <HI>brightness of his Fathers Glory, and the express Image of his Person.</HI> Who <HI>thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</HI> should be made in the <HI>likeness of Men,</HI> Phil. 2.6, 7. That <HI>God was manifest in the flesh,</HI> the <HI>Apostle</HI> calls <HI>the great mystery of Godliness,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.16. This astonishing condescention is that which <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Angels</HI> will admire throughout the Ages of Eternity.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IN <HI>submitting to a life of Obedience.</HI> It's said, Gal. 4.4. <HI>He was made under the Law.</HI> He who was the <HI>Supream Lord,</HI> who had given, and who had right to give Laws to Angels and Men; being made Man, be∣comes subject to his own Laws, he was obe¦dient both to the <HI>Moral Law</HI> and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>Mediator.</HI> He fulfilled all Righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>¦ness.

excellency and value into his obedience, that it became highly acceptable and meri∣torious; he submitted to the <HI>Law of a Medi∣ator,</HI> he came from Heaven not to do his <HI>own will but the will of his Father,</HI> and this he delighted in and submitted to. So that in this Relation he <HI>became obedient unto Death even the Death of the cross,</HI> Phil. 2.8. which is,</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Third Thing</HI> to set forth the great∣ness of this Work. There was a debt of pu∣nishment that sinful Man owed to the Law, and this must be discharged. The wisdom of God saw it necessary that the Law should not be abrogated and laid aside: but the threatnings of it must be endured, that Justice might be glorified. Therefore the Lord Je∣sus Christ sustaining the <HI>Relation</HI> of a <HI>Media∣tor,</HI> undertakes to <HI>suffer,</HI> to <HI>die,</HI> to <HI>shed his Blood,</HI> to make his <HI>Soul an offering for sin,</HI> that he might <HI>redeers his Church with his own Blood,</HI> Acts 20.28.

cruel and unjust <HI>Scourging, Condemnation,</HI> and <HI>Contumely</HI> of <HI>Pilate</HI> and the <HI>Roman Soldiers,</HI> that he was <HI>Crucified,</HI> and <HI>laid in a Grave.</HI> Thus our glorious Lord Jesus endured an <HI>ac∣cursed Death</HI> that he might redeem us from the <HI>Curse of the Law.</HI> For the <HI>Scripture</HI> abundantly informs us that his Death and Sufferings had the nature of a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> and that it was for sin, yea that he died for <HI>our Sins,</HI> not for <HI>his own</HI>; for he was of perfect purity and innocence, none could ever convince him of sin, or charge any manner of fault upon him; tho his enemies with the greatest subtilty and malice attempted it. But <HI>he was made sin for us who knew no sin himself, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.21. and, Isai. 43.4, 5.6. Now this being a necessary means for the bringing about our Salvation, shews it to be inexpressibly, yea inconceivably <HI>Great</HI>! There is no higher de∣monstration of love among the dearest friends that have ever been in the World, then to ex∣pose their lives for each other, but Christ hath commended his love beyond this, that while we were <HI>enemies he died for us,</HI> Rom. 5.8, 10. That so glorious a Person as <HI>God-Man</HI> should groan and sigh under the burthen of Divine Wrath, should be exposed to such painful and ignominious Sufferings! even to Death itself! was such a Work as asto∣nished
<PB N="82" REF="001939_0091_0FBA274D0B7699D0"/>
the Creation! and made <HI>all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remble,</HI> besides the obstinate hearts of his Persecu∣tors. It is such a work as never had been done from the beginning of the World, nor shall ever be again to the end of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. HAVING performed the work of his <HI>Humiliation,</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ, as a <HI>Con∣queror over Death and Hell, rose from the Grave, ascended into Heaven, is crowned with Glory, and lives continually</HI> to make <HI>Intercession</HI> for his Peo∣ple. His <HI>Resurrection</HI> was a glorious and eminent proof of his Satisfaction to the Law, in what he had suffered: the Law had threat∣ned Death to sin, therefore that the Sinner might live, the Surety must die: but that the sufficiency &amp; acceptableness of his Death unto the ends for which he suffered might appear he must rise again, and not be <HI>held under the power of Death.</HI></P>
<P>HIS <HI>Resurrection</HI> plainly sheweth that God hath accepted the Death of Christ, as a sufficient <HI>ransom for our Sins.</HI> The active and passive Obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ was every way enough to free us from sin and from condemnation by sin. But his <HI>Re∣surrection</HI> was a visible evidence of the satis∣factoriness of his Death. This had the nature of a <HI>solemn acquittance</HI> and discharge; it is ascribed to the <HI>Father</HI> as his discharge of
<PB N="83" REF="001939_0092_0FBA2755B6F33AF0"/>
him, Heb. 13.20. <HI>The God of Peace which brought again from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dead our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> And from hence, there is special <HI>ground of comfort</HI> afforded to Believers, in ex∣pectation of the blessings of a pardoned estate 1 Cor. 14.17. <HI>If Christ be not risen then are you yet in your sins.</HI> And again, Rom. 4.25. He <HI>died for our offences, and rose again for our justification.</HI> This act of his is a con∣vincing proof that he is indeed the <HI>Son of God,</HI> and Saviour of the World: not an <HI>Im∣postor</HI> or deceiver, as the <HI>Jews</HI> wickedly traduc'd him: his own living also shews him to be capable to <HI>convey life</HI> to others; which if he had remained in a state of Death he could not have done, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.19. And then the acceptableness and value of it, is further discovered in that he not only rose but <HI>ascended to the right hand of God.</HI> This is a pledge and proof of his compleat <HI>Victory</HI> over all his Enemies, and shews how fully he was accepted of the Father. Having such glorious dignity and honour put upon him, it carries strong ground of encouragement to his people to commit themselves and all their concernments into his Hands, Eph. 1.20, 21. 1 Pet. 3.22. <HI>He is gone into Heaven, Angels, Authorities and Powers being made subject to him.</HI> A <HI>further</HI> priviledge following hereupon is his <HI>INTERCESSION</HI> for his People, ant that
<PB N="84" REF="001939_0093_0FBA275740A0DBB0"/>
this must needs be prevalent and successful is sufficiently obvious from the <HI>reallity</HI> of his Death, the <HI>satisfactoriness</HI> of it, and the high <HI>honour</HI> that is now put upon him as the <HI>Re∣ward of it.</HI> He is in all respects accomplished for this work, and a Person so tenderly loved and so highly honoured that he shall not be rejected in any of the requests that he makes for his People, 1 Joh. 2.1. <HI>If any man sin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.</HI> Heb. 2.14, 15, 16, 17. And it is upon these several <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Death, Resurrection, Ascension,</HI> and <HI>Intercession</HI> of Christ, that the <HI>Holy Apostle</HI> lays the Foundation of his own <HI>Triumph</HI> and of all Believers, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.33, 34. and so on. From the consideration of the things spoken there is ground to con∣clude that if the manifestation of the glory of God in the Salvation of his Elect had not been a thing of great weight and impor∣tance, such great things had never been in order to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE greatness of this Salvation might also be argued from the necessary, gracious and effectual <HI>Operation of the Holy Spirit in ap∣plying of it to the Souls of Men.</HI> Not only the coming of Christ, but the coming of the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> which are the most signal favours that God manifests to Mankind, give us rea∣son to conclude that they are some great
<PB N="85" REF="001939_0094_0FBA2758558DF1C0"/>
and weighty ends for which they are be∣stow'd. Now there was a necessity of both these to the bringing home Salvation to the Souls of Men. Had not care been taken for the <HI>Application</HI> as well as the <HI>Impetration</HI> of Redemption, the case of fallen Man con∣sidering his impenitency and obstinacy, had been still deplorable: But the Lord Jesus Christ having satisfied the Justice of God, and pro∣cured favour for sinful Man, he informs us that the <HI>descent of the Spirit</HI> should be one eminent fruit and testimony of it. And by minding them of this, comforts his <HI>Disciples</HI> when greatly dejected with the thoughts of his bodily <HI>absence from them,</HI> Joh. 16.7. And though the Church in all Ages have been in some degree priviledged with the presence of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> yet the more large and plenti∣ful communications of it hath been reserv'd to the <HI>times of the Gospel</HI>; it being the great and special promise that had been given for those times, as may be seen in many <HI>Texts</HI> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> Joh. 7.37, 37. Act. 2.38. Ac∣cordingly the <HI>Apostle</HI> calls the Gospel by way of eminency, <HI>The ministration of the Spirit,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.8. And on this account checks the folly of the <HI>Judaizing Galatians,</HI> that they were grown fond of the <HI>Mosaick Rites,</HI> and had abated in their valuation and esteem of the Gospel, by minding them of the privi∣ledge
<PB N="86" REF="001939_0095_0FBA2759DBC09570"/>
they had had by it. Gal. 3.2. <HI>This on-would I learn of you, received you the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith;</HI> by which he intends the <HI>Preaching</HI> of the Gos∣pel. In 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.12. The Gospel is said to be Preached <HI>with the Holy Ghost, sent down from Heaven.</HI> Now the reason of this com∣munication of the holy Spirit was not only to <HI>prepare</HI> the World to give entertainment to it, by the <HI>extraordinary Operations</HI> that did accompany it at its first publishing, but that also by its efficacious and powerful operati∣ons upon the Souls of Men they might be actually interested in the Salvation that the Gospel reveals. In order to this there are se∣veral gracious operations of the Spirit, in <HI>Convictions of Sin, Opening the Eyes,</HI> and <HI>A∣wakening the Consciences of Sinners,</HI> to shew them their guilty, polluted, perishing condi∣tion without a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and leading them into the knowledge of the sufficiency and suitableness of the remedy, which is reveal∣ed in it; in <HI>Regenerating</HI> the Soul, disposing and inclining of it to a <HI>new Life,</HI> and assisting it thereunto in the work of <HI>Sanctification,</HI> of which the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> is the <HI>principal Author,</HI> who destroys the life of sin by degrees, and cherishes and confirms those gracious dispositions that he hath wrought: and as a <HI>Spirit of Consolation,</HI> refreshing the
<PB N="87" REF="001939_0096_0FBA275B4ADA36A8"/>
hearts of Believers in the expectation of pro∣mised Glory; helping them to see the truth of Promises, and enabling them to discern their own interest in them: on which <HI>ac∣counts</HI> he is called some<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes a <HI>Spirit of Bon∣dage</HI>; sometimes a <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI>; and some∣times a <HI>Comforter</HI>; from the different effects that he works. Now that so gracious a Per∣son as the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> should be employed in this work by such operations upon the hearts of Men in order to their Salvation, shews the work to be Great. But further,</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT it is great Salvation will ap∣pear if we consider, <HI>From what evil and mi∣sery we are saved.</HI> The greater any evil is from which a Person is delivered, the more affected he is wont to be with it. To be delivered from some tormenting pain, from some cruel bondage and slavery; from the apprehensions of present Death, are wont to be accounted great things: but they are the most <HI>formidable</HI> of all evils, from which <HI>Christ delivers</HI> his People. This might be largely opened, but I shall only insist upon some things <HI>briefly.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) IT is a Salvation from <HI>Sin.</HI> For this reason Christ hath the Name <HI>Jesus</HI> put upon him, Mat 1.21. <HI>Because he saves his People from their sins.</HI> It was upon account of sin in a peculia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manner, that Man needed a
<PB N="88" REF="001939_0097_0FBA2761345BAFC0"/>
Saviour. Sin had invaded the whole race of Mankind. The whole nature of Mankind (the Man Christ Jesus excepted) is stained and corrupted with it. All are under Sin. Now sin is of all evils the <HI>greatest:</HI> it is an evil, yea an only evil. It hath no good in it, and it tends to no good. It is a <HI>worse</HI> e∣vil than any <HI>affliction</HI> that Men have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ffer∣ed or can suffer in this World: it's worse than <HI>Death,</HI> yea then Death in the most frightful aspect that it ever appear'd in: hence many of the wisest and best of Men have chosen to suffer all sorts of tortures, and the most <HI>cruel Death</HI> that their enemies could inflict than yield to <HI>Sin.</HI> Yea Sin is really worse than <HI>Hell</HI> itself. Sin is such an evil as is immediately <HI>against God</HI>; it is an opposition to his will and glory, a rebellion against God, a fighting against him, a ble∣mishing his manifold Perfections; his <HI>Wis∣dom, Knowledge, Justice, Truth, H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, Power, Goodness, Patience, Mercy</HI>; as might be large∣ly shewn, and therefore makes the Sinner loathsome and abominable in the eyes of a holy God. Sin is an evil that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebases de∣files and <HI>destroys the Soul,</HI> Prov. 8.36. It hath taken away the primitive beauty of it, and it entails the most dreadful curses upon it. Sin is a resemblance and imitation of the <HI>Devil, Joh.</HI> 8.34. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.8. The more
<PB N="89" REF="001939_0098_0FBA276227A7EE88"/>
Men commit it the more they strengthen the Devils Kingdom, and fall in with his design. Now this being the universal inclination of depraved nature to choose and love &amp; serve Sin, though under various appearances and disguises, it must needs be acknowledged a great and glorious work of <HI>Divine Grace</HI> to save and recover Man from it, to <HI>change</HI> this wretched <HI>disposition</HI> in him, to subdue a heart to God that is so full of rebellion and opposition against him, to cleanse a Soul so deeply defiled; to <HI>create a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit</HI> in him; to turn a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <HI>from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God,</HI> Psal. 51.19. Acts 26.18. to make such a Soul holy, and to prepare it to love, fear and glorify God, and live unto him. And it will further appear so, if we consider, Man's impotency to work such a change in his own Soul; yea his reluctan∣cy against it, and various methods he uses to continue in it, and frustrate the designs of Divine Grace to effect it in him, and the insufficiency of all other means to do it.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) IT is a Salvation from <HI>Hell.</HI> Sin is the worst of <HI>moral evils,</HI> and Hell is the worst of <HI>penal evils</HI>; but this also Christ saves his People from. 1 Thes. 1.10. <HI>Jesus which de∣livered us from wrath to come.</HI> Sin had en∣tail'd
<PB N="90" REF="001939_0099_0FBA219B447CD978"/>
this upon all the miserable progeny of <HI>Adam. Evil pursues Sinners.</HI> Offended Justice hath prepared <HI>Hell</HI> for the vindication of Divine Glory, in the everlasting punish∣ment of Sinners, and there they must feel the full <HI>weight</HI> of <HI>Divine Wrath</HI>; in a privation of all good, and the sense of all that is evil. Now the Lord Jesus Christ by satisfying for Sin and bearing the curse of the Law saves his People from it; so that they shall not come into condemnation. The miseries of Hell a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e inconceivable! and therefore Sal∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>n from it is deservedly to be accounted a great Salvation: and however Men blind∣ed by sensible objects, through unbelief not apprehending the terror or certainty of it, may account otherwise of it; yet when there shall be the actual execution of the curse upon the ungodly; and the Lord <HI>Je∣sus Christ shall appear</HI> in terrible Majesty to perform the work of the Last and <HI>Great Judg∣ment,</HI> and the doom shall be passed upon Sinners, and they shall be sent <HI>away into e∣verlasting punishment,</HI> there will be a full dis∣covery that it is great indeed.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) I might add, that it is a Salvation that comprehends in it <HI>the mitigation and sanctification of all temporal evils,</HI> that the Peo∣ple of God are in this World exposed unto. It is one great and gracious fruit of the love
<PB N="91" REF="001939_0100_0FBA219C86DABED8"/>
of God in Christ toward Sinners, and a part of that Salvation which is wrought for them; that tho' in his Fatherly wisdom he cor∣rects them, yet their chastisements are <HI>Medi∣cinal,</HI> not <HI>Penal</HI> and <HI>Vindictive:</HI> design'd by <HI>Love,</HI> and over-rul'd to their <HI>Spiritual Profit,</HI> and have many comfortable Promises be∣longing to them. And these are all ordered in such <HI>seasons</HI> and in such a <HI>measure</HI> as Di∣vine <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> see to be best: and thro' the Grace of Christ they have many supports and consolations under them, and a seasonable release from them. Nor ought this to be accounted a small or dispicable privi∣ledge.</P>
<P N="5">5. THAT it is a great Salvation which the Gospel reveals and offers to Sinners by Christ, may further appear, if we consider, <HI>What Blessings it contains in it,</HI> and <HI>what Pri∣viledges it intitles Believers unto.</HI> Besides the freedom from the forementioned evils, there are many <HI>positive Blessings</HI> belonging to it, and these such as are invaluably great. The usefulness profit or comfort of any outward blessing is wont to recommend it to our de∣sires, and raise our esteem of it: the more available it is to our present or future good, the more it is wont to be sought after. Now the Salvation which is brought us by the Gospel contains in it the <HI>best Good,</HI> and such
<PB N="92" REF="001939_0101_0FBA219E30B7A630"/>
as we have the greatest reason to desire and to be concerned for. I shall <HI>instance</HI> in some of the <HI>Priviledges</HI> of it, but not <HI>inlarge</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>THEY who are brought to close with the offers of it are brought into a state of <HI>Peace and Reconciliation with God.</HI> The dreadful breach that sin had made between God and the Sinner is made up, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.1. Peace with Men is desirable, <HI>Peace of Conscience</HI> is more desirable: but <HI>Peace with God</HI> is most of all so! and indeed this lays the surest foundation for the other.</P>
<P>AGAIN, <HI>Their Sins are Forgiven,</HI> and they are made <HI>righteous</HI> before God, thro' the <HI>im∣putation of the righteousness of Christ</HI> unto them by <HI>Faith,</HI> Rom. 8.12. That vast debt which they owed, is cancelled: God hath received full satisfaction for it, in their Surety, and doth upon believing freely, fully and for ever discharge them from it. Now this is a blessed Priviledge, and makes those happy that obtain it. <HI>Psal.</HI> 32.1, 2.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Further</HI> hereupon their <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Services</HI> are <HI>accepted,</HI> Eph. 1.6. Their hearts are <HI>sanctified,</HI> and they are graciously renew∣ed and restored to some conformity to the <HI>Divine Image and Likeness,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. And have the <HI>Promises of Preservation</HI> in a state of Grace; that the good Work begun in them
<PB N="93" REF="001939_0102_0FBA21A1AF4D7B58"/>
shall not be so obstructed, either by remain∣ing sinfulness, or the many artifices of the Tempter; but shall in due time be perfected in them. Those weak beginnings of Grace thro' the powerful and abiding presence of the Spirit of Grace shall be preserved and cherished, till they arrive at the stature of perfect Men in Christ. Such a <HI>Promise</HI> was never given to <HI>Adam</HI> in his state of inno∣cency.</P>
<P>THEY have also <HI>Liberty of Access to the Throne of Grace,</HI> and encouragement to expect that they shall <HI>obtain mercy and find grace to help in all times of need,</HI> Eph. 2.18. Heb. 4.16. How much comfort and sollace doth this afford to gracious Souls? That they have such a wise, powerful and gracious God to go to in <HI>all</HI> their wants, fears and temptati∣ons? Hence also they have <HI>gracious Com∣munion with God</HI>: there are special Seasons wherein he makes them glad with his Coun∣tenance, leads them into the understanding of his Excellencies, shews them the stability of his <HI>Covenant</HI>; shines upon their Graces, and <HI>fills</HI> them with unspeakable Consolation.</P>
<P>FURTHER, They have the priviledge of <HI>Adoption,</HI> they are honoured not only with the <HI>Title</HI> of Children, but have the real pri∣viledge of such. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.18. They have a <HI>Child-like Spirit</HI> of love, reve∣rence
<PB N="94" REF="001939_0103_0FBA21A5E3336DC8"/>
and obedience towards God. They have his Fatherly care of them while here; and they have a <HI>Childs Portion</HI> and Inheri∣tance, reserved for and promised to them. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.17. And this is so <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>great,</HI> so full and compleat as will exceed all their desires and expectations; nothing shall be wanting to their satisfaction and felicity. On all these accounts the Priviledges of Sal∣vation are great: but were there no more than this <HI>one act</HI> of Divine Grace, their full <HI>enjoyment of God</HI> in a state of Heavenly Glo∣ry; this might abundantly convince us that it is so. To be <HI>ever with the Lord,</HI> to <HI>behold his face in righteousness,</HI> is a thing great, to astonishment!</P>
<P>I proceed to some <HI>APPLICATION</HI> of this <HI>Proposition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> HOW <HI>greatly concern'd Men ought to be for the Salvation of their own Souls,</HI> and <HI>with what weight this matter should lie upon their Spirits.</HI> It is the <HI>Soul</HI> in a principal manner that is the subject of this great Salvation we have been speaking of, (tho' it is readily granted that the Body according to its state and capacity shall share in it,) had not Man been enobled with a <HI>Soul</HI> of an Immor∣tal nature, there had been no reason to have expected that such great things should ever
<PB N="95" REF="001939_0104_0FBA21A7055DC398"/>
have been done for his Salvation. It was the Soul especially that was stained and cor∣rupted with sin, that needed to be restored by sanctifying Grace; it was the Soul that was firstly subject to the impressions of di∣vine Wrath, and that can have the deepest sense of it. It is the <HI>Soul</HI> that is capable to know, love, fear, glorify and enjoy God, and it was the tender compassions of our Lord Jesus Christ working towards our pre∣cious but perishing <HI>Souls</HI> which (next to the Glory of his Father) mov'd him to do what he hath done for the Salvation of them. Hath then the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Love</HI> of the <HI>Son,</HI> the <HI>Grace</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> been thus employed to bring about Salvation for our lost and dying Souls? How abundantly may it convince us of the great value of them, and engage to a deep concern for them, and solicitude that it may be well with them. There's no design that Men have to carry on, no business that they have to do, of e∣qual weight with this: and which deserves such regard from them. Surely would Per∣sons consider <HI>these things</HI> as they ought, it would be impossible that their Souls should be neglected as they are. As means to a∣waken hereunto, Consider,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) SURELY <HI>GOD knows the worth of Souls.</HI> He that made them must needs know
<PB N="96" REF="001939_0105_0FBA23C3CF498748"/>
the value of them: He knows their nature, their capacity, what vast desires they are fill'd with, and what an eternal felicity they are capable of: and shall we have such mean thoughts of them, as only to think them fit to continue for the Body, to be employed in <HI>searching</HI> into the <HI>works of Na∣ture or Art,</HI> or much less be enslaved to <HI>flesh and sense,</HI> that we might be a <HI>wiser</HI> sort of <HI>Beasts.</HI> It were a shame to us to think so, and not turn our Souls to the contemplation of their nature and use, and to think with our selves, Hath God been thus concern'd for the Salvation of them, what a sin and shame will it be for us to be careless of and unconcerned for them.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Consider, <HI>HOW great danger you are in of losing your Souls,</HI> and failing of the Salva∣tion of them. The <HI>Soul</HI> as precious as it is may be lost, and too many are in every Generation of Men; and there's danger of every one of your Souls in particular, being lost, that are not interested in the great Sal∣vation, that the Gospel reveals to you. For there is a <HI>Sentence of Death</HI> and Condemnati∣en now lies upon you: this seizes upon you so soon as you become one of the <HI>Children of Adam,</HI> Eph. 2.3. We are <HI>Children of Wrath</HI> by nature, and it continues upon you while you abide in unbelief, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.18. None but
<PB N="97" REF="001939_0106_0FBA23C54FF32528"/>
Christ can deliver you from it by presenting himself to Justice in your stead. There's danger, because of your <HI>ignorance</HI> of Christ's Excellency, and your <HI>natural aversion</HI> and un∣willingness thro' <HI>pride, sloth, love of sin,</HI> the snares <HI>and allurements of the World,</HI> to come unto him, for the Salvation he hath pur∣chased: there's danger in regard of the ma∣ny and <HI>unwearied subtle attempts</HI> that <HI>Satan</HI> the great Adversary is using to destroy your <HI>Souls.</HI> He <HI>goes about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.6. And he <HI>hunts</HI> for the precious life; they are the Souls of Men that he would prey upon. He hath already drawn you into abundance of sins, and is daily tempting you to more, that he might bring upon you a dreadful &amp; irremedi∣lous destruction: now should not the dan∣ger you are in of losing them awaken your care of them and thoughtfulness for them.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Consider, <HI>THE loss of your Souls will be very dreadful.</HI> Persons have deeply la∣mented other losses that they have met with, but who can conceive what will be the doleful outcries and bitter complaints of them that lose their Souls? The loss of the Soul doth not consist in the <HI>annihilation</HI> of it; but in its <HI>separation and banishment from God</HI>; and in the impressions of <HI>divine wrath</HI> upon it, and its being sentenc'd to the <HI>eternal regions
<PB N="98" REF="001939_0107_0FBA23C7041DD540"/>
of darkness &amp; despair.</HI> How doleful will it be to be excluded out of the Kingdom of Heaven, when others shall be admitted into it! to be thrust down with infernal Spirits and damned Souls! when others shall <HI>sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of God,</HI> Mat. 8.12. How doleful will it be to be sentenc'd to <HI>de∣part from God</HI>! to be excluded from any com∣fortable sight of God, when others shall be encircled in the Arms of his love, and ad∣mitted to a state of satisfying Fellowship and Communion with him? How doleful will it be, to be a monument of Divine Wrath, to feel the weight of revenging Justice, when others shall taste and experience the love of God, and drink of the river of his Pleasures? <HI>These things</HI> are dreadful beyond what our narrow understanding can now comprehend! and it will yet further inhance these mise∣ries, that when these <HI>Spiritual evils</HI> shall light upon impenitent Sinners, there will be no <HI>Temporal good things,</HI> such as they now enjoy, to alleviate them, nor to divert their thoughts from the afflicting sense of them: The <HI>rich Man</HI> in the <HI>Parable,</HI> Luk. 16.24. is not able to command a <HI>drop of Water to cool his tongue,</HI> when horribly scorch'd <HI>in those Flames</HI>: but especially the <HI>Eternity</HI> of these miseries shews them to be inexpressibly dreadful! if there were any hope that there might ever be an
<PB N="99" REF="001939_0108_0FBA23C85442BCB0"/>
end of them, tho' it were after <HI>Thousands or Millions of Years,</HI> this would be some mitiga∣tion of them, but this thought, that the <HI>Worm never dies,</HI> that the <HI>Fire is never quench∣ed,</HI> fills the Soul with the most tormenting rage and despair!</P>
<P><HI>USE II.</HI> HOW much reason we have <HI>to admire the riches of divine Wisdom, Grace and Love</HI> which hath provided so great and glo∣rious a Salvation for us. We read, <HI>Psal.</HI> 111.4. He hath made his <HI>wonderful works to be remembred.</HI> God would not be forgotten in the World, therefore he hath set before us evident <HI>marks</HI> of his <HI>Perfections</HI> in his works of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> which are with heedful observation and intention of mind to be reflected upon. But the Divine <HI>Perfecti∣ons</HI> do yet more illustriously shine forth in the work of <HI>Redemption</HI>; and in this especially our thoughts should be employed: that our Souls might be filled with suitable apprehen∣sions of them. And for this great work God should ever be <HI>Glorious in our Eyes</HI>! The <HI>Psal∣mist</HI> contemplating the Works of God cries out with admiration and praise! Psal. 8.4. <HI>What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou visitest him</HI>! So great is the distance between the Great and Holy God, and mean and sinful Man; that we have reason to look upon it wonderful <HI>con∣descention</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="001939_0109_0FBA23CCC2F7AC90"/>
that he should express his regards in the lowest instances of it. So holy <HI>Ja∣cob</HI> thought, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.10. But it is much more to be admired, that he should employ his Wisdom in such a wonderful contrivance as that of our Redemption: give his <HI>Son</HI> to as∣sume our nature, to obey and suffer and die, that he might redeem and save us, send forth his Almighty <HI>Spirit,</HI> to make applica∣tion of that Redemption notwithstanding the rebellion and reluctancy of our hearts against it: and it should the more endear it to us, considering that as great and wonder∣ful as it is, it was no more then we had ab∣solute need of, and had been for ever lost and undone, if infinite Wisdom, Love and Grace had not been in this way concerned for us. The <HI>Scripture</HI> sets it forth by such expressions as may abundantly raise our esteem and admiration of it. It tells us, Joh. 3.16. <HI>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.</HI> And Rom. 5.8. <HI>God com∣mended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us</HI>! It calls it <HI>riches of Grace: Treasures of Wisdom: Exceeding Great∣ness of Power</HI>! That it contains such won∣derful displays of the Divine Perfections, that the <HI>Angels desire to stoop down and look into it,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.12. that they may have fresh oc∣casions to excite their <HI>Praises.</HI> How can we
<PB N="101" REF="001939_0110_0FBA23D761D7E120"/>
enough bewail the stupidity, earthliness and sottish inconsiderateness of our hearts? that are looking upon other objects with esteem and admiration, while this great design of divine Wisdom and Love is no more admir∣ed, esteemed and delighted in by us. But to excite hereunto, <HI>Consider</HI> Two or Three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS is <HI>one special way of putting honour upon God for it,</HI> to entertain high and ho∣nourable thoughts of it. God's last and highest end in all his Works is his <HI>own Glo∣ry,</HI> and it seem'd good to the divine Wisdom to pitch upon this way for the manifestation of it; and he will be admir'd in and for it throughout the days of Eternity. Now none can doubt but that they, for whom these great things are done should be peculiarly concerned to give him the glory of it. Did the blessed God design to glorify himself in this work, to give occasion to Men and An∣gels to do it? How unworthy a thing will it be if we don't fall in with this great de∣sign? Now we shall not do this if we con∣tent our selves with some formal verbal ac∣knowledgements of God for it, and han't hearts deeply <HI>affected with it,</HI> and don't <HI>ad∣mire</HI> the <HI>Divine Perfections</HI> shining in it. If we don't often view with wonder and praise the glory of his Grace and Love in the In∣carnation
<PB N="102" REF="001939_0111_0FBA23D8C485BED0"/>
and Humiliation of the Son of God, the glorious discoveries of his Holiness, Truth, Justice, Wisdom and Power, the sweet concurrence of his several <HI>Attributes,</HI> and the lustre they cast one upon another in the car∣rying on this great design, and the immense and infinite <HI>Goodness</HI> of God that appears in the gracious effects procured for us by it. How justly offended was God with the <HI>Peo∣ple of Israel</HI> when they lost a sense of his Mer∣cy in their deliverance from the <HI>Egyptian</HI> ty∣ranny; that <HI>they remembred not the multitude of his mercies</HI>; nor the great things he had wrought for them. Yet this was but a tem∣poral Mercy, and a <HI>shadow</HI> of this glorious Work: therefore not to admire God in this will be the blackest ingratitude. What greater thing can be suppos'd that God should ever do to endear himself to us, and engage the highest esteem of him, and rea∣diness to put honour upon him, then he hath done in this astonishing work?</P>
<P N="2">2. DUE apprehensions and admirations of the Divine Glory appearing in this great Work <HI>will be greatly subservient to your own comfort.</HI> It will be a good evidence of your interest in the priviledges of Redemption. It is ever the <HI>property</HI> of those that have been sharers of this deliverance from sin and wrath to have high thoughts of their Deliverer,
<PB N="103" REF="001939_0112_0FBA23DA5651E9B8"/>
and of the ways and means whereby deli∣verance hath been brought about. 1 Pet. 2.7. <HI>Unto you that believe he is precious.</HI> The Pro∣position is convertible: They to whom Christ is precious do believe: a high valuation of Christ in his Person, Offices, Benefits, is ever a concomitant of Faith, and evidential of it. They who have been led into the spiritual understanding of the Glory of the Person of Christ, the acceptableness of his Obedience, the sufficiency of his Satisfaction, the glory of divine Wisdom, in the contrivance and carrying on the work of our Redemption, will and do undoubtedly close with it, and actually depend upon this glorious Saviour. Men shew their dependance upon created helps by their high thoughts of the suffici∣ency of them. Such a high esteem of the sufficiency and excellency of <HI>Christ</HI> will dis∣cover your affiance and complacency in him. Thus the <HI>Apostle</HI> discovered his interest in Christ by his transcendent respect to and esteem of him, Phil. 3.8. <HI>I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.</HI> And thus the sincere Christian, represented by the <HI>wise Merchant,</HI> is characterized by his transcendent esteem of Christ, and willingness to part with all for him, Mat. 13.45, 6. <HI>The kingdom of Hea∣ven is like unto a merchant-man seeking goodl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
<PB N="104" REF="001939_0113_0FBA23DBC2E67E20"/>
pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.</HI> So the <HI>Church,</HI> Cant. 5.10. Esteems <HI>her Beloved</HI> as the <HI>chief among ten thousand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE III.</HI> IS the Salvation which the Gospel reveals <HI>so Great and Glorious,</HI> as you have heard, <HI>Be hence exhorted, to secure an in∣terest in it.</HI> This is the great design of the <HI>Revelation</HI> of it; this is the unquestionable duty of those that have the offer of it made to them. If this be not your serious con∣cern and endeavour, you <HI>receive the Grace of God in vain,</HI> are nothing the better for the discovery of it. The <HI>Apostle</HI> tells us, 1 Tim. 1.15. <HI>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.</HI> 'Tis no fiction or idle report, but that which is true and certain; and what sinners have the highest reason to busy themselves about, and be deeply con∣cerned for. The report of it is justly ac∣ceptable and should be welcome to perishing sinners. Had the deliverance been a great deal less then it is, it had been worthy of acceptance: had it been only a reprieve from <HI>Hell</HI> for some <HI>Hundreds of Years,</HI> or a release from it after so many Years enduring the torment and misery of it: this had been worthy of acceptance. Men are willing to
<PB N="105" REF="001939_0114_0FBA23E69B42E990"/>
take a great deal of pains for a few Years comfort. If it had been only some <HI>mitiga∣tion of the Curse</HI> that <HI>Christ</HI> had obtained for us, much more if there had been a total re∣lease and discharge from the sufferings of it, tho' there had been no future happiness e∣ver to have been expected; if sinful Man might have been <HI>annihilated,</HI> &amp; made uncapable of sin or misery, this considering what an evil sin is, and what dreadful and astonishing mi∣series it brings with it, had been worthy of our thankful acceptance. But when far be∣yond these God is pleased to provide a Sal∣vation, whereby we may have not a <HI>partial</HI> but a <HI>full deliverance</HI> from all the effects of <HI>Sin,</HI> and be made partakers of peace and friendship with God, to enjoy all needful <HI>Spiritual blessings,</HI> and to be sharers with <HI>An∣gels</HI> in the <HI>everlasting fruition of God</HI> in <HI>Hea∣venly Glory</HI>! This ought to be most earnest∣ly sought after by all that have the offer of it made unto them. Now to <HI>urge</HI> this mat∣ter.</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider, <HI>THE absolute necessity</HI> of com∣plying with the <HI>terms of the Gospel, and being interested in the Salvation that it offers.</HI> Men will take a pretty deal of pains to procure the conveniences of Life: but universal rea∣son acknowledges it to be wisdom to take care of things that are necessary, especially what
<PB N="106" REF="001939_0115_0FBA23E89857C020"/>
is <HI>absolutely</HI> so, that they may <HI>have Bread to eat and Raiment to put on.</HI> Men usually say, they must have these, and will stick at no∣thing in pinching necessities to obtain them. And can these be more necessary then the <HI>Bread of Life,</HI> or the <HI>Garments of Salvation?</HI> What shall become of you if Christ ben't a Saviour to you? God han't left Men to have their choice of several ways whereby they may be accepted, justified and saved: but he hath limited it to this; if you don't obtain Salvation upon the terms of the Gos∣pel there's no hope of being saved at all. There never were but <HI>two ways</HI> proposed to Man by which he might obtain <HI>Eternal Life,</HI> either by <HI>Innocence</HI> and <HI>sinless Obedience</HI>; or by the <HI>Righteousness of Jesus Christ</HI>: either by the <HI>works of the Law,</HI> or the <HI>Grace of Christ</HI> appearing in the <HI>Gospel.</HI> The <HI>First</HI> of these is become impossible to Man in his now fallen estate: none that understand themselves or the Law, can pretend to put in any plea for life upon the <HI>terms</HI> of the <HI>First Covenant. The whole world is become guilty before God,</HI> Rom. 3.19. and are obnoxious to the curse and condemnation of a broken Law. <HI>By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified,</HI> Gal. 2.16. None of the race of sinful Man, how blamelesly, soberly, conscienciously soever they have liv'd, have been able to put in

any plea for life, that might be accepted be∣fore God. It is <HI>the righteousness of Christ alone</HI> that can profit a guilty creature to procure ab∣solution, and acceptance for him before God; this only can endure the trial of God's Tri∣bunal. This the <HI>Apostle</HI> priz'd as his invalu∣able treasure, in comparison wherewith he accounted all his own, to be but <HI>dross and dung,</HI> Phil. 3.9.

<P N="2">2. Consider, <HI>THE compleatness of the Sal∣vation that the Gospel offers, such as is most sui∣table to your necessities.</HI> There were many hindrances in the way of Man's Salvation, God was offended and must be satisfied; the <HI>Law</HI> was broken and must be vindicated; <HI>Satan</HI> had usurp'd a power over sinful Man as a <HI>Prisoner</HI> and Captive to him: The <HI>World</HI> had got possession of his heart and affecti∣ons: These must be overcome. But the Wisdom and Love of God hath graciously consulted Man's necessity, and provided a most suitable and compleat remedy. Con∣cerning the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> it is said, that
<PB N="108" REF="001939_0117_0FBA23EB897A0A68"/>
<HI>He is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him,</HI> Heb. 7.25. to the <HI>uttermost</HI> of our <HI>wants,</HI> and the uttermost of our <HI>de∣sires.</HI> Offended Justice was fully satisfied by what Christ suffered, and the authority of the <HI>Law</HI> was maintained; and the Holiness and Wisdom of God in establishing of it, displayed in the Obedience and Death of the Lord Jesus Christ; so that they put in no bar in the way of the Salvation of a Belie∣ver: and Christ by his Merit satisfies Justice, and vindicates the Law, so by his <HI>power</HI> he rescues from the hand of <HI>Satan,</HI> the <HI>power of Sin,</HI> and the Snares of the <HI>World.</HI> He hath triumph'd over all the <HI>powers of Darkness</HI>: he holds a bridle of restraint upon their rage and malice, he takes the <HI>prey out of the hand of the mighty,</HI> and rescues the lawful <HI>Captive</HI> whenever he pleaseth: he encourages Be∣lievers with this assurance, Rom. 16.20. <HI>The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.</HI> And comforts them against the snares of the <HI>World</HI> with this encouragement, Joh. 26.33. <HI>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the World.</HI> There is in Christ Jesus not only a fulness of <HI>Merit,</HI> but an overflowing <HI>fulness of the Spirit,</HI> to sanctify and preserve to a state of Heavenly Glory, as well as to purchase it for us. Surely such a Saviour should be highly acceptable to your <HI>Souls,</HI> and most thankfully embraced.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="109" REF="001939_0118_0FBA23F2922A5078"/>3. <HI>THE clearness of the revelation of Gospel Light that you enjoy,</HI> should be an argument to get the understanding of it, and a special interest in the blessings that it offers. God Was pleas'd to instruct the <HI>Church of Israel</HI> in the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Salvation by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> by many <HI>Types &amp; Ceremonies</HI> which were <HI>shadows of good things to come.</HI> Their light was glo∣rious in comparison with the state of the <HI>Pa∣gan</HI> World, but obscure in comparison with the <HI>New-Testament</HI> dispensation. As the <HI>A∣postle</HI> at large shews, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now <HI>Old Testament Prophecies</HI> are interpreted in their accomplishment. <HI>Types</HI> unveil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in their <HI>Antitype.</HI> Things that were <HI>dark</HI> are now made <HI>plain.</HI> Now <HI>light</HI> hath broken forth with great evidence and authority, so that it is said, <HI>Light and Immortality are brought to light by the Gospel,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.19. On this ac∣count our <HI>Saviour</HI> saith to his <HI>Disciples,</HI> Mat. 13.16, 17. <HI>Blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear. For verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see these things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear these things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</HI> Now what can you reasonably think is the expectation of God in this dispensation? Surely not that you should <HI>turn it into wantonness</HI>; that you should indulge sin or cherish a spirit of
<PB N="110" REF="001939_0119_0FBA23F747D6AB08"/>
<HI>presumption:</HI> but that it be diligently and thankfully improv'd, that you may be led in∣to the understanding of the Glory of Christ in his Natures, Person, and Offices: might have right apprehensions of the riches of divine Grace and Love: might have your desires after this Salvation suitably enflam'd and directed: that after such wonderful <HI>Grace hath appeared,</HI> you might not perish in your sins.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>GOD graciously tenders this Salvation to you, and is still perswading your acceptance of it.</HI> There is a <HI>special Providence</HI> of God directing the dispensation of the Gospel, both as to the times and places where it shall be afford∣ed. The <HI>Apostles Journeys</HI> were ordered by the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as you may see, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.26, — <HI>Chap.</HI> 16.7. Now by the gracious designati∣on and choices of Providences it is brought and laid before you. It may be said to you as was sometime to them, Act. 13.26. <HI>To you is the word of this Salvation sent.</HI> You are often acknowledging it as a fruit of special Mercy, that God hath brought it to you; that your time is a time of <HI>Light and Grace. An accepted time and a day of Salvation</HI>! And great reason there is to acknowledge the distinguishing Grace of God in this matter toward you: when so many are to be found in the World covered with ignorance and
<PB N="111" REF="001939_0120_0FBA23F909AF5AD8"/>
barbarism, and what <HI>Superstitions</HI> and <HI>Here∣sies</HI> prevail even in Christianized parts of the World. But especially the condescention of God is astonishing, that he hath not con∣tented himself barely to reveal it, but to <HI>press and urge</HI> your acceptance of it, with the most proper and forcible <HI>Arguments.</HI> Yea to di∣rect his <HI>Ambassadors</HI> to entreat Sinners to ac∣cept the offer that is made; as in that won∣derful expression, 2 Cor. 5.20. <HI>As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead he ye reconciled to God.</HI> The great and glorious God who neither wants the friend∣ship or service of any of his Creatures is pleas'd to become a suitor for them, to use the most melting arguments with them, to pursue their own happiness; by accepting the Grace provided in Christ. Now let your own Judgment and Consciences determine whether it ben't a most becoming and rea∣sonable thing, that you should put a due va∣lue upon the offer! that you mayn't be guilty of receiving <HI>the Grace of God in vain</HI>; and ill requiting of such great and astonish∣ing Mercy. God doth not offer it to you out of necessity, but out of choice and by way of trial. So that both his <HI>Mercy</HI> and your <HI>own Interest</HI> should oblige you to accept of it. If you slight God's offers, he can find those that will be glad of them. As the
<PB N="112" REF="001939_0121_0FBA23FB61FCCE40"/>
<HI>Apostle</HI> said to them, Acts 28.28. <HI>The Sal∣vation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and they will hear it.</HI> And especially should this Ar∣gument prevail, considering how long this offer hath been neglected: how often Gos∣pel offers have been repeated without suc∣cess. How long the arms of Mercy have been stretched out in vain to you: how many Calls have been refused: how ill you have requited the Lord for his Mercy. Shall it still be so? Can you find in your hearts to tire out Divine Patience, to trample upon Divine Mercy, and to refuse your own happiness, to hearken to the in∣snaring delusions of the grand Enemy of your Souls, notwithstanding all the care God hath taken to promote the Salvation of them? Who can express the sin and folly of refusing Salvation thus graciously provided and so freely offered and brought to your doors? It was this gave occasion to that <HI>passionate lamentation</HI> of Christ over <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> because they <HI>knew not the time of their visitation,</HI> Luk. 19.42.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>YOUR neglect of Salvation will be very sinful and inexcusable.</HI> The sinfulness of it is manifest in its contrariety to the express de∣claration of the Divine Will discovering your duty; and its aggravated by the clear∣ness of Light and fulness of Grace mani∣fested
<PB N="113" REF="001939_0122_0FBA23FCCD569CA0"/>
in the Gospel. What more can be desired to perswade and convince the judg∣ment and consciences of Men of the truth of the Gospel, and of the sincerity of God in the offer of it, than what God hath done? And how inexcusable then will be your sin if you neglect it? You can't pretend you did not know of it, or that Salvation was to be expected in any other way, or that there wanted sufficient assurance of the truth of the Gospel; or that you had not a warrant to look for an interest in the blessings of it. Much less will you be able to <HI>plead</HI> that you had business of greater weight and necessity to busy your time and thoughts about: that you had no leisure to apply your self to it. <HI>Every mouth will be stop'd</HI> in the great Trial. But <HI>Gospel Sinners</HI> will be most of all inexcu∣sable and self-condemned. It is certain that if you can't satisfy your Consciences now, you will be much less able to clear your selves before God hereafter.</P>

<HEAD><HI>I proceed to the Fourth</HI> Proposition. <HI>PROPOSITION IV.</HI> HOW Great and Glorious soever the Salva∣tion is that the Gospel reveals, it is by too many Neglected.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Apostle</HI> evidently intimates this by the <HI>supposal</HI> that he makes of the fearful hazard that will be consequent upon it. This is a truth too frequently obvious to experi∣ence, that there is often ground to renew the <HI>Prophets</HI> complaint, Isai. 53.1. <HI>Who hath be∣lieved our report.</HI> From one Age and Gene∣ration to another it hath been thus, among those that the <HI>Gospel</HI> hath been Preached to. This is a dismal proof of the deplorable state of Man by the Fall, which hath not only brought guilt and wrath upon him, but a fearful blindness and obstinacy; a most wretched aversion from God; that though he is perishing for want of Salvation, yet when it is brought him, and most graciously tendred, he hath not a heart to accept it and close with the offer of it. This gave occasion to those <HI>complaints</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> Mat. 23.37. <HI>How often would I have gathered you, and ye would not.</HI> Joh. 5.40. Life was to be

had by Christ but they cared not for it, would not come to Christ for it: it is too much the spirit of Men still. Salvation is provided by Christ, revealed in the Gospel, offered to Men in the <HI>Ministry,</HI> urged upon them by the <HI>motions of the Holy Spirit,</HI> and the voice of their own <HI>Consciences.</HI> But yet there are abundance who are nothing the better for it, who obtain no peace or par∣don, no grace or comfort by it. Now this arises from the neglect of it: not improving the opportunities and offers of it that are afforded them.</P>
<P>UNDER this <HI>Proposition</HI> it may be shewed,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THAT it is so, or <HI>that many to whom the offers of Salvation are made do neglect it.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>WHENCE it comes to pass, that they do so.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT many do neglect the Salvation that be Gospel Offers.</HI> This is the <HI>Case,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>OF those that slight and disregard the offers of it, when made to them.</HI> We read of such, Mat. 22.5. Who when <HI>invited</HI> to par∣take in the priviledges of the Gospel, <HI>made light of it</HI>; heard it as a matter of little use and concern to them. There are too many careless inconsiderate sleepy hearers of the Word; that hear as if they heard not, don't
<PB N="116" REF="001939_0125_0FBA24074481C348"/>
seriously regard the Messages sent them by God from day to day: they don't attend to <HI>the things that are spoken</HI> as such whereon their eternal welfare depends. It's strange to see what <HI>ignorance</HI> there is in many about the necessary <HI>Doctrines</HI> of Salvation that are often inculcated upon them; and what <HI>in∣sensibleness</HI> and sottishness there is in many more, of the worth of that Salvation which the Gospel reveals. This comes to pass from their not minding and weighing the truths that are delivered to them. How many live as if they were only born for time, and the interests and pleasures of the present Life, and had nothing to do for Eternity? Hence they spend their days in mirth and jollity, their lives are a continual diversion, from one carnal pleasure and delight to another, their thoughts run continually upon these things, that they regard no proposals that are made to them of things that refer to their <HI>Eternal safety</HI> and welfare. Are sottishly ig∣norant of the state their <HI>Souls</HI> are in. A <HI>spi∣rit of deep sleep</HI> is fallen upon them: they will own that they are <HI>Sinners</HI>; but their being so is no burthen, no terror to them. And hence though they hear of a <HI>Saviour</HI>; and all his glorious sufficiency is set before them to remove their guilt and restore their Souls. Yet <HI>they</HI> mind it not, lay no weight upon it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="117" REF="001939_0126_0FBA240D16307350"/>2. <HI>OF those that don't seriously make it their concern to get a right understanding of the way of Salvation, which the Gospel reveals, and to be interested in it.</HI> They truly neglect Salvation that are not concern'd to be saved. That don't set themselves in good earnest to un∣derstand the terms and method in which it may be obtained. Many have a superficial knowledge of the Doctrine of the Gospel, being all their days educated under it: yet are negligent in improving it. They have no delight to employ their minds in medita∣ting on it, or to know the Spirit, and feel the power of it upon their hearts: don't by serious consideration set themselves to get an understanding of the excellency and suita∣bleness of it to their condition, and of what importance it is to them: how much the command of God and a respect to their own safety and welfare obliges them to hearken to the proposals of it, and to make it their present serious concern to have a special and real interest in it; that <HI>Christ</HI> with <HI>all his Benefits</HI> may be theirs; and they may be sharers in the glorious priviledges of <HI>Pardon, Peace, Holiness,</HI> and a <HI>Title to Eternal Life</HI> by <HI>him.</HI> Some have a desire to be sav'd, now and then have a <HI>good pang</HI> upon them, ex∣press some concern about it under some a∣wakening Truth, or Providence that they
<PB N="118" REF="001939_0127_0FBA2410428FAB90"/>
meet with: but for the most part it is a matter of indifferency to them; their minds are intent upon other matters, and they can content themselves to live in a state of estrangement from God, without any interest in the graces of his Spirit, or any <HI>well-grounded hope</HI> in his Promises. That which should be their grand concern, and pursued with the greatest ap∣plication of mind is laid aside, and other things are preferred before it. They can't tell how to be contented to want Corn and Cattle, and Lands, or such worldly interests, conveniences and honours that they see o∣thers enjoy: but they can bear it well e∣nough to want spiritual and eternal mercies. These things not being obvious to sense, seem to them like the <HI>Poets</HI> Elizeum, but as a <HI>dream or fancy.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT is also the case <HI>of those that thrust it from them, and put away the offer of it as not belonging to them.</HI> There are two sorts of Persons here comprehended,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THOSE that <HI>purposely delay and put off this grand concern of securing Salvation to them∣selves</HI> by closing with the offers of the Gos∣pel: and leave it as a matter of future care, presume there is no present danger that their Souls are in; but that they may safely indulge their security and sloth, and yield to other designs. They will grant the work of <HI>Faith</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="001939_0128_0FBA2411912AAF10"/>
to be necessary, they would not dare to die without it; but they see not a present ne∣cessity of it, but as <HI>Felix</HI> dealt with his Convictions under the <HI>Apostles Preaching</HI>; defer'd them to <HI>a more convenient season</HI>; so they put off this great duty of <HI>believing in Christ,</HI> 'till some other businesses are dis∣patch'd, or 'till the approach of <HI>Death.</HI> They truly neglect the Salvation of the Gospel that neglect to improve the Season allotted to them for the obtaining of it.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>THOSE that are under the power of an unbelieving heart.</HI> 'Tis a fruit of the natural corruption of the heart, to discredit and question God's Truth, as well as to resist his Authority. And Men are very prone when they hear of the abundant Grace of God in Christ towards Sinners, to question the truth of the report, to doubt whether the thing be so or not; to contract the infiniteness of God's Mercy and Christ's Merit: and to look upon the offers made them too great to be true. They are ready to measure God by themselves, and to think him prone to Revenge and slow to Mercy: their guilt sills them with jealousies and suspicions of God; they look upon him as one <HI>hard to be intreat∣ed,</HI> and that Mercy is with great difficulty wrested from him; they must do some great thing to procure it, and move God to the
<PB N="120" REF="001939_0129_0FBA24128D039AA0"/>
exercise of it, or they may'nt expect it: or though some others whose sins han't been of such a heinous nature, so circumstanc'd and aggravated as theirs have been, may hope for favour from God &amp; acceptance in <HI>Christ,</HI> yet think they may'nt dare to do it; they don't look upon themselves to be Persons in∣tended in the offer that is made; that it would be <HI>too much boldness</HI> and arrogance in them to venture upon it; they dare not stay on Christ as a sure <HI>Anchor</HI> against all the tossings of fear and temptation, arising from the sense of their own guilt and unworthi∣ness: but are like a Ship tost upon the waves. This is not so openly frequent among us as <HI>Presumption</HI> and Security, there being more <HI>Presumers</HI> than <HI>Despairers.</HI> But yet it is the case of many who spend their days in fruit∣less complaints and <HI>dejection of Spirit</HI>; who entertain and cherish jealousies of God, and of the authority and divinity of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and of the sufficiency of the Grace &amp; Power of <HI>Christ,</HI> as though there were not shelter enough <HI>under his Wings</HI> to defend them.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> I proceed to shew, <HI>Whence, it is that so many neglect this Great Salvation.</HI> There are abundance of blameable causes to which it might be assign'd.</P>
<P>I shall only <HI>hint</HI> at the more <HI>General.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="121" REF="001939_0130_0FBA24141DE83830"/>1. <HI>A prevailing love to some Lust.</HI> The Lusts of Men frequently have a great inte∣rest in their affections, <HI>Partly,</HI> from their suitableness to their corrupt natures; <HI>partly,</HI> through custom in the service of them: and <HI>partly,</HI> from the many carnal advantages which they propose to themselves by them. Mens lusts are dear to them. They are re∣presented in <HI>Scripture</HI> sometimes by <HI>a right hand</HI> or <HI>a right eye.</HI> Hence they <HI>roll them as a sweet morsel under their tongues.</HI> They hide and spare them, and <HI>will not let them go.</HI> Men will venture abundance from their love to them. 'Tis out of love to their lusts that some will blast their <HI>Reputation.</HI> Others will ruine their <HI>Estates</HI>; grieve their <HI>Friends,</HI> wound their <HI>Consciences,</HI> impair their <HI>Bodies</HI>: and it is from their excessive love to them that many will expose their <HI>Souls to perish for ever.</HI> They are not willing that <HI>Christ</HI> should be a <HI>Jesus</HI> to them to <HI>save them from their sins</HI>; that he should exert the power of his Grace in mortifying their lusts; they could be glad to be sav'd from <HI>Hell,</HI> but they can't bear to part from some sweet <HI>bosom sins</HI>; they are got into a way of <HI>Wantonness,</HI> or a way of <HI>Intemperance,</HI> or a way of <HI>Dishonesty,</HI> or a way of <HI>Worldliness,</HI> and the profit or pleasure of these lusts blinds them. They are <HI>hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</HI> They could be
<PB N="122" REF="001939_0131_0FBA241DE9E85138"/>
glad of <HI>Christ</HI> to pacify their consciences, but they must have their lusts to gratify their corrupt and carnal affections. They are not willing that Christ should do the whole work of a Saviour for them, which is in effect to refuse that he should do any part of it: For the receiving of and submitting to <HI>Christ</HI> in all his <HI>Offices</HI> is a condition indispensibly requi∣site to our partaking of the benefit of his Sufferings and Mediation. Now Mens na∣tural aversion hereunto, and their strong and fixed <HI>love to sin</HI> is the reason why abundance of Persons neglect and refuse the Salvation which the Gospel offers to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>AN immoderate desire of and an inordinate complacency in the lawful enjoyments of the World,</HI> is another cause of it. Worldly com∣forts are present and sensible, such things as Men find a want of, and taste sweetness in: therefore the temptations from them is the more forcible: Their cares for the present life, makes Men neglect a future. Things of <HI>Time</HI> are so pressing and urgent, that <HI>Eter∣nal</HI> Mercies are but little accounted of. This is represented to us, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.17, — 20. This was then, and still is the great hin∣drance to Mens prizing and accepting of <HI>Christ.</HI> Fears of <HI>Poverty</HI> prevail more upon them than fears of <HI>Damnation.</HI> Desires of
<PB N="123" REF="001939_0132_0FBA24200A218D38"/>
<HI>Grandeur and Pomp of living,</HI> or to equal or out-shine their Neighbours in Riches and Honours is of more value to them then to have their <HI>Souls adorn'd</HI> with <HI>Grace,</HI> and pol∣lish'd and <HI>prepared for Glory.</HI> Their heads and hands are so full of their worldly de∣signs, and they are so wholly swallowed up in the thoughts and cares about it, that they have no heart or time to think of the state of their Souls, or to provide for the future welfare of them; they live as if they were born only to mind the interests of <HI>back and belly,</HI> and after a while <HI>like the beasts to perish,</HI> and be forgotten for ever. Hence it comes to pass that many who have some Convicti∣ons of the guilt of sin, and the dangerous state of their Souls, and their need of Christ, quench and suppress these Convictions from <HI>worldly</HI> considerations. They can't listen to them till this or the other design and busi∣ness they have in hand for the World, is dis∣patched. 'Tis the prevalency of this spirit that makes some Men neglect duties of Wor∣ship in their <HI>Families</HI> or <HI>Closets</HI>; and to omit <HI>spiritual opportunities</HI> that might be for Soul advantage; that makes <HI>others</HI> cold and dead and dull and formal in what they do in Re∣ligion. Something is carried on as the <HI>World</HI> will give leave, in a sleepy, customary way, that is neither pleasing to God nor pro∣fitable
<PB N="124" REF="001939_0133_0FBA2421981BB508"/>
to themselves. This <HI>worldly spirit</HI> is as great a hindrance to the Souls of Men in this great duty as any one thing seems to be; and its to be fear'd is the principal cause of it at <HI>this day.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT arises also from <HI>causeless prejudices which Man take up against the way of Salvati∣on, or the means of the application of it.</HI> Our Saviour (<HI>Mat.</HI> 11.6.) pronounces such <HI>blessed</HI> as are <HI>not offended in him</HI>; too many are, and thereby further their own misery. Some take offence at the strict and self-de∣nying terms of the Gospel; they are loath to <HI>sell all</HI> for the <HI>Pearl of great price.</HI> They hear they must part with <HI>every lust,</HI> and they may be put upon it to part with their <HI>dear∣est enjoyments</HI> for Christ's sake. This they are loth to engage themselves to. Some are pre∣judiced at the <HI>strictness</HI> of a <HI>Spiritual Life.</HI> They would have more liberty than <HI>Christ</HI> will allow. Christ doth not abridge Men of any lawful liberty, but some Men will take a <HI>licentious liberty.</HI> The great objection that abundance have against Christ is, that <HI>they will not have him to rule over them,</HI> Luk 10.27. The <HI>Laws of Christ</HI> are too strict for them. Some are prejudiced at the <HI>Falls and Miscar∣riages</HI> of some Professors of Religion, and this indeed is a <HI>fatal rock.</HI> We have a <HI>Woe</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="001939_0134_0FBA24231ADAF448"/>
pronounced to <HI>the World because of offences</HI>! Mat. 18.7. It is indeed no reasonable vin∣dication of those that neglect the Profession of Christ and Subjection to him, because some that own him carry it badly; for we are forewarn'd that there will be <HI>Hypocrites</HI> in the <HI>visible Church.</HI> The Laws of Christ give no countenance to these misbehaviours; but yet too many nourish a base and vile opinion of <HI>Religion</HI> upon this account, and reject the proposals of it: and not only the loose and vain take offence at it, but sometimes those that have had some impressions of Religion upon their hearts grow shy of it upon this account. <HI>Some</HI> are prejudiced against the <HI>Instruments</HI> by whom the offer of Salvation is brought to them. Either some <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>moral imperfection</HI> they have to object against them, their outward meanness or infirmities; or it may be some <HI>personal grudge</HI> they have taken up against them; they don't regard the <HI>Message</HI> because they slight and dis-esteem the <HI>Messenger</HI> that brings it. Thus the <HI>Jews</HI> were stumbled at the <HI>outward mean∣ness</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Apostles,</HI> because they were Men of no note and fame in the World.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT comes to pass <HI>from the influence of bad Examples.</HI> Ones neglect and carelesness
<PB N="126" REF="001939_0135_0FBA242B3671D208"/>
is a temptation to another. There are some Seasons wherein there are fresh and plenti∣ful <HI>effusions of the Spirit</HI> of God upon a place: at such a Season many will be <HI>pressing into the Kingdom of God.</HI> The zeal of some provokes others, then Persons will be helpful to awa∣ken and quicken one another. But again there are times of <HI>great deadness and security,</HI> few that have any real pressing sense upon their hearts of their need of Salvation. At such a time Men do exceedingly <HI>harden one another.</HI> They are ready thus to reason with themselves; such and such are careless about it, and think they may also without any hazard, especially when those do so whom they esteem Men of Prudence, and whose Judgment they value in other cases. This is a <HI>Temptation</HI> to them, to think that if it were a matter of such dangerous consequence to neglect it, such Persons would never do so. It was made an objection against the re∣ception of <HI>Christ</HI> in his time. Joh. 7.48. <HI>Have any of the Rulers or the Pharisees believed on him?</HI> Men are very much led by <HI>Example,</HI> especi∣ally by those of the same standing with them. This is a Temptation unquestionably to many <HI>Young Persons</HI>; they see their Com∣panions are light, vain and careless Persons. Hereby they are emboldned in their Sins, and in the neglect of the Grace offered them by Christ.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="127" REF="001939_0136_0FBA242C52CF00A0"/>5. IT is in many <HI>upon the account of a legal temper and spirit that prevails in them.</HI> Such a spirit there is in Men naturally, and indeed universally inclining them to seek <HI>Justification</HI> by <HI>their own works.</HI> Every Man comes into the World under the obligation of that <HI>Covenant,</HI> and naturally runs to it for Life: is attempting to do something that may ans∣wer his obligation, and abate the rigour and severity of the Law that is in force against him; and <HI>partly,</HI> from the <HI>pride</HI> of his heart whereby he is ready to over-value his own services, &amp; think them much better than real∣ly they are. A spirit of <HI>self-love</HI> is apt to blind Men, that they can't see their own defects, and it is a thing Men are exceeding prone to, to choose to live upon their own <HI>poor stock</HI> rather then to be beholden to <HI>others</HI> for relief in their necessities: they had rather have a few <HI>rags</HI> of their own then be be∣holden to <HI>Christ</HI> for the <HI>Robes of his Righteous∣ness</HI>: And it is <HI>partly</HI> from <HI>ignorance,</HI> not un∣derstanding the excellency and sufficiency of Christs Righteousness, or its acceptableness to God, unto the end for which it is propo∣sed; not understanding or being satisfied with the glorious design of God to exalt his <HI>Grace</HI> in the <HI>free Justification</HI> of a Sinner by the <HI>imputation of Christ's Righteousness</HI> alone, without the <HI>works of the Law.</HI> This was the
<PB N="128" REF="001939_0137_0FBA242D877AA858"/>
case of the <HI>Jews</HI> at the first Preaching of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> Rom. 10.3. No Doctrine was more disrelish'd by them than this of Justification by the Righteousness of Christ thro' Faith. And it is this <HI>Doctrine</HI> that the great <HI>enemy of God's Grace,</HI> both in the times of <HI>Popery,</HI> and since by other <HI>Instruments</HI> hath endeavoured to obscure and resist; and he finds the cor∣rupt hearts of Men ready to fall in with this design. It is the case of <HI>awakened Sinners,</HI> who are deeply concern'd for Salvation to withstand the way which the Gospel reveals by Christ; and so reject the promise for <HI>want of suitable qualifications in themselves.</HI> They would fain get better hearts, better frames and affections, do duties in a better manner: if once they could prepare them∣selves for Christ, they would venture upon him: but for want of such preparations they neglect and are afraid to do it.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT arises also from the <HI>influence and activity that Satan hath to blind and darken the minds of Men, and set them against this duty.</HI> To this the <HI>Apostle</HI> ascribes it. 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <HI>If our Gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not. Satan</HI> is the great promoter of all sin, the <HI>enemy of all righteousness.</HI> But he especially engages him∣self and uses his utmost policy and power to
<PB N="129" REF="001939_0138_0FBA242F544B2CD8"/>
harden Men in <HI>unbelief,</HI> and keep them off from a due closure with Christ upon the terms of the Gospel, and he uses abundance of methods to bring about this design, by suggesting many carnal reasonings and ca∣vils against the truth; perverting the truth to the prejudice of Mens Souls, by quench∣ing convictions, following them with temp∣tations to procrastinate and delay the matter; or <HI>flattering</HI> them with vain <HI>hopes</HI> of the goodness of their estate, because of their orderly lives, frequency in duties, religious affection, reformation, <HI>and the like</HI>; that they need not trouble themselves about a better righteousness: Or tempting them to take up with an <HI>image of Faith</HI> instead of that which is <HI>saving,</HI> to rest upon their good de∣sires of being saved by Christ, while they neglect to venture their Souls upon him, on the encouragement of the Promise From such causes as these arises the too great and common neglect of the Salvation offered to Men by the Gospel. I proceed to the <HI>IM∣PROVEMENT</HI> of this Head.</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> THIS shews <HI>what cause of Humi∣liation and Lamentation there is upon this account, that the Salvation provided by Christ, and offer∣ed in the Gospel is so much under-valued and neg∣lected in our days.</HI> The Mercy and Grace of
<PB N="130" REF="001939_0139_0FBA2433476D36F0"/>
God hath signally appeared towards us, in giving us the priviledges of the Gospel, which are denied to abundance of others in the World; and the Salvation herein revealed and proposed hath been already shewed; the blessings and Promises of it are of a spi∣ritual and eternal nature, and therefore of highest importance to the Souls of Men. The things which Christ tenders to sinners by it, are reconciliation with God, remission of Sin, redemption from the curse of the Law, a title to Eternal Life, and to all the felicity that the Eternal Fruition of God in a state of Heavenly Glory can afford; but how few comparatively prize it, regard it, and are concern'd to have an interest in it. The glad tidings of the Gospel grow stale and common in our times; it is other News that Men generally listen after, it is the world and worldly enjoyments and interests that Men are enquiring after, and busying themselves about. The <HI>favour of God,</HI> and <HI>E∣ternal Life</HI> seem to be small and inconsidera∣ble things in comparison with the great ex∣pectations they have from the World. The prevailing of <HI>such a spirit</HI> calls for our <HI>Humilia∣tion,</HI> and should be <HI>for a Lamentation,</HI> and that on <HI>several Accounts.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. ON account of the <HI>greatness of the Sin.</HI> It is a <HI>Sin</HI> that hath the greatest <HI>ingratitude</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="001939_0140_0FBA24384AFA5168"/>
unkindness in it: it is a <HI>sin</HI> against the <HI>freest Love</HI> and <HI>richest Mercy</HI> that ever was mani∣fested to the World, and therefore must needs have a great deal of provocation in it. The <HI>Apostle</HI> in our <HI>Context,</HI> and <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.28, 9. ag∣gravates it by a comparison taken from <HI>sins against the Law.</HI> The bold transgressions of the Law were punish'd with the <HI>Death of the transgressor</HI>; but the <HI>Apostle</HI> puts a <HI>how much more!</HI> unto the <HI>voluntary transgressions against the Gospel</HI>: and in proportion the slighting and neglecting the Grace tender'd in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> will bring an answerable degree of punishment: even <HI>wrath to the uttermost</HI>! What wonderful love was it that when the <HI>whole World was become guilty before God,</HI> and nothing but certain Death could have been expected by any of the sinful Children of Men: That then the <HI>kindness and love of God should so appear,</HI> as to send his <HI>own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,</HI> to be a Surety and Sacrifice for us? to be <HI>made sin,</HI> and <HI>a curse for us,</HI> to take upon himself the obligation we were under to discharge it in our stead, in such a costly way as by the <HI>offering of him∣self</HI> to make expiation for our Sin? and not only to procure deliverance from sin and all the penal effects of it, but to purchase and offer Eternal Life and Glory in the World to come: That God should single out you to
<PB N="132" REF="001939_0141_0FBA243BC8CDA980"/>
be the subjects of these offers, what asto∣nishing Grace is this! How great then is the <HI>ingratitude</HI> to slight, disregard and neglect the offer of it? that you should carry your self so towards <HI>God</HI> as if his <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Favour</HI> were things of little worth! towards <HI>Christ</HI> as if he spent his Life and endur'd his Suffer∣ings for things of very little value and ac∣count? not worth your esteem and accep∣tance! How highly are Men offended of∣ten times when their favours are slighted. And how much more may the blessed God, when such rich and glorious offers as he makes, are not regarded by the Children of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. ON account of the <HI>sad effects this sin is attended with, even in this world, and those judgments that it brings with it.</HI> When the <HI>Jews</HI> rejected <HI>Christ,</HI> God <HI>destroyed</HI> that <HI>Nation</HI> by astonishing Judgments. God hath for a long time been pleading a <HI>controversy with this Land,</HI> showing his displeasure by many awful humbling rebuk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in his Providence; and undoubtedly there are <HI>many things</HI> which God hath been provoked by, and been testi∣fying against us for: The <HI>Unrighteousness, Oppression, Fraud, Falshood, Intemperance, Wan∣tonness, Uncleanness, Prophanations of God's Sab∣baths, Murmurings, Pride, Contempt of Superi∣ours</HI>; and <HI>other evils</HI> that too frequently break
<PB N="133" REF="001939_0142_0FBA243D4D381820"/>
out: But there's reason to conclude that one main branch of God's controversy with us, is the <HI>not prizing and accepting the Grace of Christ offered in the Gospel.</HI> Our <HI>Blood</HI> hath been <HI>spilt as water upon the ground,</HI> because the <HI>Blood of Christ</HI> hath been so lightly esteem∣ed. The jealousie of God hath been pro∣voked to <HI>blast</HI> those things which have been <HI>idoliz'd</HI> and prefer'd before <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Grace of God by him. There is the grea∣ter ground to conclude that God is angry for this upon a <HI>double account. Partly,</HI> because of the <HI>general prevalency of this sin.</HI> As to ma∣ny other sins there are but few comparative∣ly chargeable with them. But the neg∣lecters of the Great Salvation preach'd to, and press'd upon Men in the Gospel are ma∣ny; they are to be found in all our <HI>Towns,</HI> from one end of the <HI>Land</HI> to another. It is the <HI>prevailing sin</HI> of our days. We may take up the <HI>Prophets</HI> complaint, Isai. 53.1. <HI>Who hath believed our report?</HI> The minds and thoughts of the most are intent upon other things. The <HI>general cry</HI> is, <HI>What shall we eat, What shall we drink?</HI> &amp;c. Not, <HI>What must we do to be saved?</HI> And <HI>partly,</HI> because of the <HI>influence and tendency that this hath to draw Men to, and harden them in other sins.</HI> Did Persons duly understand and consider how great a blessing Salvation from sin is, and
<PB N="134" REF="001939_0143_0FBA243EC28A0258"/>
improve the help offered them by Christ for that end, it would be their care to watch against it, to mortify it, to resist and suppress the motions of it, and not indulge and cherish it as now they do. But this neg∣lect of the Grace of Christ and over-valuing the things of the World disposes Men to <HI>Ir∣religion</HI> and <HI>Unrighteousness,</HI> to entrench upon God's <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> to omit <HI>Duties of Worship</HI> in their <HI>Closets</HI> or <HI>Families</HI>; or to be slight and superficial in them, to <HI>neglect spiritual Op∣portunities,</HI> to grow weary of God's <HI>Ordinan∣ces</HI> because of the labour and charge of them. It disposes Men to acts of unrighteousness, to defraud, over-reach and injure their Neighbours, to break their Promises, to be uncharitable and covetous. <HI>All</HI> must <HI>bow</HI> to this <HI>admired idol.</HI> This sin is fruitful and not only produces abundance of other sins, but keeps Men from the only remedy and pre∣servative from all sin; and is in its nature most vile, as being opposite to what is God's greatest design, to exalt the Glory of his Grace towards sinners by Jesus Christ. So that it is no wonder that the anger of God is so awfully manifested on account the of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN regard of the <HI>certain and fearful dan∣ger such Persons are in of Eternal Judgments.</HI> It is a sin that not only provokes God to
<PB N="135" REF="001939_0144_0FBA2448DE59BEB0"/>
shorten Men's lives, to put an end to their op∣portunities of Gospel Light and Grace, to bring many outward Calamities upon Men in this World, but it will also bring upon them <HI>fearful and unavoidable destruction</HI> in the World to come. If this way of Salvation be neglected, there is no remedy, no way to escape remaining for guilty sinners: God hath provided no other Sacrifice for sin: and if you continue impenitent and unbelieving, that doth most certainly cut you off from any claim to the benefits of Christ. The <HI>Law of Faith,</HI> like that of the <HI>Medes</HI> &amp; <HI>Persians may no man reverse. He that believeth not the son, shall not see life. Except</HI> Men <HI>repent, they must perish.</HI> Unbelief is eminently the mor∣tal sin that certainly damns sinners, and leaves them to have <HI>Judgment without Mercy.</HI> It is not the preparation of a sovereign re∣medy that cures a disease, but the <HI>application</HI> of it. The Righteousness and Spirit of Christ however sufficient for the ends to which they are provided; yet they convey no pardon life and comfort to any Soul, that is not by <HI>Faith</HI> united to Christ. It is not from any defect of Mercy in God or Merit in Christ that so many perish, but from their obstinate refusal of it. That <HI>precious Blood</HI> which in itself <HI>speaks better things</HI> then the Blood of <HI>Abel,</HI> calls for Mercy upon penitent and believing
<PB N="136" REF="001939_0145_0FBA244A65520FD8"/>
sinners, calls aloud for vengeance and dam∣nation upon the heads of the unbelieving and impenitent; and such must expect the amazing and terrible executions of them. Now how greatly to be lamented is this, that the last end of so many of the misera∣ble Children of <HI>Adam</HI> will be to <HI>perish for e∣ver</HI>? Temporal miseries that some endure are very sorrowful; the spiritual Judgments that others undergo are more sorrowful: but <HI>Eternal</HI> evils vastly and inconceivably exceed both. To see Men and Women en∣dued with rational and understanding Souls, capable of eternal Blessedness and Glory, and under the gracious offers of it, insensible of their need of it, and regardless of the Grace and Love that hath done so much to procure it; miserably infatuated and hardened in the love of sinful pleasures, and unperswa∣dable by all counsels; voluntarily rushing forward to their own amazing and eternal ruine, justly calls for our <HI>deepest Lamentation.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THEY are to be lamented over on this account also that <HI>ther's great hazard their op∣portunities</HI> for avoiding the miseries they are in danger of, and obtaining the mercies offered them, <HI>will quickly be gone.</HI> God de∣clares to those whom he priviledges with the light and liberty of the Gospel as, 2 Cor.
<PB N="137" REF="001939_0146_0FBA244B9CE54720"/>
6.1. <HI>Behold! now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation!</HI> And calls upon them to <HI>hear his voice</HI> while it is <HI>called to day,</HI> Heb. 3.7. But he lets Men know that tho' in respect of <HI>clearness</HI> of Light the Gospel dis∣pensation that they are under is a <HI>Day,</HI> yet in respect to the <HI>shortness</HI> of it, it is <HI>but</HI> a <HI>Day,</HI> a <HI>Day</HI> that will quickly terminate, and is continually wasting. The glass of Patience is continually running down and will soon run out: whether sinners improve it or no, its continually flying from them; many thro' their carelessness have lost much of it already: some are got to an <HI>advanced age,</HI> and with respect to nature, can't expect a much longer opportunity; and <HI>some</HI> by a course of sinning have encreas'd their <HI>natural obstinacy. Others</HI> have contracted <HI>evil habits,</HI> or brought themselves under <HI>Spiritual Judg∣ments,</HI> and have provoked God to put a pe∣riod to them. Now the loss of such an op∣portunity is of doleful consequence. It was the consideration of this that drew out our <HI>Saviour's Tears</HI> over <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Luk. 16.44. That <HI>she knew net the time of her visitation.</HI> It is a very <HI>melancholly</HI> consideration to see multitudes of Mankind, daily sliding as it were upon the stream of Time into the ocean of Eternity, and in the mean while full of sottish carelessness, security and sloth, not
<PB N="138" REF="001939_0147_0FBA244D244E76D0"/>
considering whither they are going, or now they shall be disposed of in that Eternal state!</P>
<P><HI>USE II.</HI> OF <HI>Examination,</HI> to stir you up to Consider, <HI>Whether you are not guilty of this Sin of neglecting the Great Salvation which is reveal'd and offer'd to you in the Gospel.</HI> The commonness of this evil, and the dangerous∣ness of it may justly awaken all to a due so∣licitude in this matter. Few will acknow∣ledge their guilt herein; and many are rea∣dy to deceive themselves because of some common effects of illumination, conviction or comfort, that the Gospel hath had upon them; go away with false hopes that all shall be well.</P>
<P>THE great <HI>ENQUIRY</HI> therefore that I would propose to you to put to your own Souls, is, <HI>Whether you have been brought thank∣fully to receive the blessings offered, and heartily to submit to the terms propounded in the Gospel?</HI> For surely they who don't accept the Salva∣tion tender'd do neglect it. How honoura∣bly soever Men speak of the Gospel and pri∣viledges of it, yet if their hearts are not bowed to consent to the offers it makes, and submit to the duties it requires, they do neg∣lect it. A few <HI>Particulars</HI> may be insisted on for your help in this trial.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT you have received and accepted the
<PB N="139" REF="001939_0148_0FBA245159C292F0"/>
Grace offered in the Gospel, <HI>you do indeed value the priviledges of it.</HI> Both <HI>Christ</HI> him∣self and the <HI>Benefits</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> are precious to Believers. The priviledges of Salvation are various, and some of them some carnal Persons may seem to esteem. But to value them all, or indeed rightly to value any, is one <HI>distinguishing character</HI> of true Believers. <HI>Peace with God</HI> is one of the priviledges of the Gospel. Carnal Men would be glad that God would not hurt them, but as for any real esteem of his <HI>Favour,</HI> or rejoycing in his Friendship, prizing his Presence or Fellow∣ship with him, this they are strangers to: but a gracious Soul values this, and accor∣dingly prefers the favour of God above the <HI>increases of Corn and Wine,</HI> Psal. 4.5, 6, 7. Yea accounts his <HI>loving kindness to be better than Life,</HI> Psal. 63.2. The friendship of God is more to them then the smiles of all the World. The sense they have of the excellen∣cy of it is the great inducement to a holy walking before God, and watchfulness a∣gainst any thing that may make a breach between God and them, and provoke him to hide his Face from them. Again, <HI>Liberty of Access to God,</HI> as to a <HI>Father in Christ,</HI> that they may come and pour out their hearts un∣to him in all their straits and necessities, this is a priviledge which gracious Souls have
<PB N="140" REF="001939_0149_0FBA2457DB8AEB28"/>
an high esteem of, and do thankfully im∣prove. Hence their approaches to God are not the effects of slavish fear, but of love, they come not into God's presence as forc'd and constrain'd, but as delighting in it, that they may express a sense of his Grace to∣wards them, and may obtain further mani∣festations and experiences of it. Again, <HI>Another Priviledge</HI> that Believers have by Christ and which they are wont highly to value is, <HI>Deliverance from the reigning power and dominion of sin.</HI> Rom. 6.14. This is a principal part of that Liberty which they enjoy by Christ at present, that by his <HI>Spirit</HI> he enables them <HI>to mortify the deeds of the bo∣dy,</HI> Rom. 8.13. They are made partakers of a new nature by the Spirit of Christ ef∣fectually working in them, which inclines them not only to avoid and resist, but to hate sin, and to love and prize holiness. And as they are improving the consideration of the <HI>Death</HI> of Christ and his design in Re∣demption as arguments to engage their hearts against it; so they have recourse to the <HI>Spirit of Christ</HI> for direction and help in the course of their duty, and for assistance in their conflicts and temptations: and it is their comfort that the Salvation which is <HI>be∣gun</HI> in them in this respect shall in due time be <HI>perfected</HI>; glad would they be of the <HI>per∣fection
<PB N="141" REF="001939_0150_0FBA24590D7728A8"/>
of holiness,</HI> and abolition of sin: and even now while they <HI>groan being burthened,</HI> with the remains of this <HI>body of sin,</HI> they <HI>re∣joyce in Christ</HI> as one that hath engag'd for them, and will give in due time compleat victory. Rom. 7.24, 5. Awakened sinners would be glad to be freed from the <HI>punishment</HI> of sin, but they that are truly gracious would be delivered from the <HI>being of Sin.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. IF you have accepted the Salvation of the Gospel <HI>you will fetch your best and sweetest comforts from the hopes of it.</HI> This character the <HI>Apostle</HI> gives of Believers, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.2. That they <HI>rejoce in-hope of the glory of God.</HI> It is lawful, yea a duty to rejoyce in God on ac∣count of the present effects of his goodness that we partake of, but the chief joy of a Believer is <HI>in God through Christ,</HI> and in the hopes of that perfect and satisfying felicity that shall be enjoyed with God in a state of Heavenly Glory. The promises hereof are their <HI>Songs in the House of their Pilgrimage</HI>; these lighten their burthens, and relieve them under their wants and trials and distresses here: they reckon with the <HI>Apostle,</HI> Rom. 8.18. <HI>That the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in them.</HI> They are often re∣freshing themselves with the meditations of the greatness and goodness and certainty of
<PB N="142" REF="001939_0151_0FBA245A8EF62B70"/>
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dmiring the Mercy and Love that hath made such glorious preparations for such mean and vile and unworthy crea∣tures; are waiting and longing for the <HI>Day of Redemption,</HI> and <HI>groaning</HI> under their pre∣sent distance from God, and the unsuitable∣ness of their hearts to the glory and blessed∣ness of the state that is prepared for them. The temper of the heart is as much disco∣vered by <HI>what it rejoyces</HI> in the hope of, as in the possession of. <HI>Carnal Men</HI> shew the car∣nality of their hearts by the carnal expecta∣tions that they feed themselves with, as well as by their complacency in what they enjoy, as, Luk. 12.19.20. <HI>Gracious Souls</HI> discover the heavenliness of their temper by their <HI>seeking the things that are above,</HI> and groan∣ing after the perfecting of their Redemption. <HI>Carnal Men</HI> may desire <HI>Heaven</HI> as their <HI>Re∣fuge,</HI> when they can be here no longer, but Godly Men desire it as their <HI>Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IF you have accepted the Salvation of the Gospel, <HI>you do then make it your care to answer the design of it.</HI> 'Twill be your seri∣ous aim and endeavour to <HI>walk worthy of the Lord unto all well pleasing.</HI> It was none of Christ's design to countenance licenciousness, to purchase an indulgence to Men's lusts. It is a vile abuse of the Gospel they are guilty of, who take encouragement from it
<PB N="143" REF="001939_0152_0FBA245C020B6830"/>
to continue in sin on this hope, that the Mer∣cy of God and Merit of Christ, will bear them out. God had quite another design in revealing his Grace to sinners in the Gospel. We are told what it was, Tit. 2.11, 12. <HI>The grace of God which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying un∣godliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world.</HI> Who∣ever are taught it effectually, and brought to understand the <HI>truth as it is in Christ Je∣sus,</HI> do learn this by it; they see a glory in this method of divine Grace, as it carries the strongest arguments against sin, and the most forcible inducements to holiness and purity and righteousness, in the course of their lives; and as they have been made sensible of their misery by reason of the power as well as guilt of sin; so they esteem it their priviledge that they have the offer and promise of Grace by Christ to take a∣way the power of sin; and to enable and assist them to walk in newness of life. Hence the Scripture doth so frequently insist upon <HI>such signs</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI>; as being the sure and in∣fallible <HI>marks</HI> of it. They who are made par∣takers of life by Christ do discover it in <HI>righteousness, truth,</HI> and a care of <HI>universal ho∣liness</HI> in the course of their lives. <HI>Consider</HI> therefore, is this your spirit? Do you see a
<PB N="144" REF="001939_0153_0FBA2464EED2D4E8"/>
beauty in holiness? Do you <HI>love</HI> the divine <HI>Law</HI> because of the <HI>purity of it?</HI> Do you im∣prove Promises, Ordinances and Providen∣ces to the advancement of <HI>holiness</HI> in your hearts and lives? Are you really thankful for any advance and progress in it, and mourning for deficiencies in it? After Falls into sin are you in haste to repair to Christ for recovery by giving you repentance and pardoning Mercy? And to renew your watchfulness against sin, and a more strict dependance upon him, that his power might rest upon you, and <HI>his strength be perfected in your weakness?</HI> This is the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Believers.</P>
<P><HI>USE III.</HI> TO <HI>Advise</HI> all such as have <HI>neglected the Salvation that hath been offered them in the Gospel now to embrace it.</HI> Now hearken to the <HI>proposals</HI> God is making to you, in order to your present comfort, and future happiness. That <HI>Caution</HI> of the <HI>A∣postle</HI> deserves to be often thought upon, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.15. <HI>Looking diligently least any man fail of the grace of God.</HI> Every Man in particular had need be concerned that he don't fail of an interest in the Grace of God, or come short of Salvation. The revelation of the Grace of God to Sinners in the Gospel is in it self a Mercy; but if the Doctrine of the Gospel be not believ'd and understood, nor
<PB N="145" REF="001939_0154_0FBA246686F02368"/>
the Mercies it offers accepted, it will even∣tually prove an aggravation of Sin, and a heightening of Judgment.</P>
<P>I shall offer a few Word of <HI>Advice.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. SET your selves <HI>to shake off Presumption and Security.</HI> From the prevailency and power of these it is that Salvation is so much neglected. Men <HI>presume</HI> they have time e∣nough before them, <HI>presume</HI> upon the Pati∣ence of God, the continuance of Means, the assistances of the Spirit: all which are <HI>utterly uncertain,</HI> and not at their command. <HI>Presume</HI> upon their good purposes and reso∣lutions; not understand the <HI>deceitfulness and desperate wickedness</HI> of their own <HI>hearts</HI>; and thro' these presumptions indulge a spirit of <HI>security</HI> and sloth: have no heart to take pains about their eternal welfare, but con∣tent themselves either with <HI>lazy wishes</HI> or superficial and <HI>formal duties.</HI> Therefore shake off this <HI>sloth</HI> and abandon these pre∣sumptions. Conclude upon it, that now is the time of duty; now is the season of hope: That you <HI>know not what a day may bring forth,</HI> when God will put a period to your time or suspend the influences of his Spirit.</P>

know this; by his <HI>Word,</HI> by the voice of <HI>Conscience,</HI> by his <HI>Providences,</HI> by the <HI>Con∣fessions</HI> and <HI>Experiences</HI> of <HI>others.</HI> You are capable of understanding and passing a true judgment upon your state and actions, to see the numerous sins you have been guilty of in the course of your lives, to see the truth of the threatning and curse of the <HI>Law</HI> that lies upon you and stands in force a∣gainst you, your utter impotency to fulfil the righteousness or bear the penalty of it, to make any compensation for sin, or to give to God any ransom for your Souls, to offer any thing to God that may be a price for Eternal Life. So that unless a <HI>Saviour</HI> in∣terpose for you, there's a necessity of your perishing, and it is altogether uncertain how soon it may be.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>LABOUR after an understanding of the sufficiency of the Saviour, and the suitableness of the Salvation that the Gospel reveals, and the just and honourable terms upon which it is offered.</HI> Mens taking up wrong apprehensions of <HI>these things,</HI> breeds prejudices and discourage∣ment. The principal means God hath ap∣pointed to be used to bring you to a know∣ledge of these things, are diligent hearing and searching into the <HI>Word</HI> of God; and earnest applications to God for his <HI>Spirit</HI> to instruct you.

the terms of Salvation, the <HI>Spirit</HI> o∣pens the understanding to see the truth and glory of the things reveal'd. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.39. and <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.14. There you are inform'd of the <HI>Natures, Person</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> of Christ: How <HI>mighty he is to save</HI> even <HI>to the uttermost</HI>; of the sins and wants, of <HI>those that come to God by him</HI>; It shews us the compleatness of his Satisfaction, the acceptableness of his Suffer∣ings, the prevailency of his Intercession, the riches of his Grace and Mercy, his readi∣ness to receive and undertake for believing Sinners, that find an utter inability to save themselves. He imposes <HI>terms</HI> that are not only <HI>just</HI> but <HI>honourable</HI> and <HI>gracious</HI>: he re∣quires no part of the satisfaction due to the Law from the sinner himself, but an <HI>intire dependance</HI> upon what he hath made by his Obedience and Sufferings; that you <HI>break off your sins by repentance,</HI> and return to your duty to God by an entire <HI>Dedication</HI> of your selves, <HI>Soul, Body, Time, Interests,</HI> to <HI>his Glory and Praise</HI>; to which he encourages with the most <HI>great and precious Promises</HI> of Eternal Life and Happiness, as the reward of it at last.

<HEAD><HI>I proceed to the Last</HI> Proposition. <HI>PROPOSITION V.</HI> THE Neglect of this Great Salvation will expose Men to Great and Unavoidable Misery.</HEAD>
<P>THE accepting and entertaining of it will secure the greatest happiness, the choi∣cest blessings to the Children of Men; but the neglect of it will bring on the sorest and heaviest Condemnation; this a truth plain from the <HI>words of our Text.</HI> The <HI>Apostle's</HI> question supposes a vehement <HI>Negation, There will be no escaping,</HI> the severest Vengeance of GOD, if the Salvation offered in the Gos∣pel be neglected and refused. A <HI>question</HI> something like this you have, 1 Pet 4.17. <HI>What shall the end of them be that obey not the Gospel of God.</HI> How miserable and how dreadful it will be he doth not determine, but leaves it to their own thoughts and consciences to judge. And that their con∣demnation and punishment will be intolle∣rable, our <HI>Saviour</HI> plainly asserts when he tells us that the punishment of some of the worst of the <HI>Heathen</HI> will be <HI>more tollerable</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="001939_0158_0FBA247541D7E898"/>
than theirs. <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.22. The plagues and miseries that shall fall upon the most <HI>abomi∣nable</HI> among the <HI>Heathen</HI> shall not be compa∣rable to <HI>theirs,</HI> who shall be found guilty of despising and sinning against the remedy offered in the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>I shall speak to <HI>two things</HI> only for the <HI>Ex∣plication</HI> of this <HI>Proposition.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>HOW doth it appear that such will be ex∣pos'd to Great and Unavoidable Misery?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WHY will this neglect have such a fearful Issue?</HI></P>
<P>THAT their Misery will be exceeding great may appear from the <HI>nature, quality</HI> and <HI>kind</HI> of it in the following <HI>Particulars.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THEY will <HI>have none of their Sins Par∣doned, but must expect to answer for them, and bear the guilt of them all.</HI> Whenever the Sal∣vation offered in the Gospel is received a∣right, <HI>remission of Sins</HI> is one happy effect of it. Remission of Sin doth always follow▪ upon Mens <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> Act. 3.19. And <HI>Chap.</HI> 10.43. But on the other Hand, unbelieving and impenitent Sinners, have the guilt of all their sins lying upon them. There's no remission of sin without the Blood of Christ; and without <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, there's no interest in his Blood, and consequently no <HI>Pardon.</HI> Sinners stand guilty before God
<PB N="150" REF="001939_0159_0FBA2477C86C8A38"/>
of numerous sins, but how many soever they are, they are all chargeable upon them; they have forgotten abundance of them, but God han't forgotten one of them: They are laid up in store with him, and <HI>Seal'd up among his Treasures,</HI> Deut. 32.34. The <HI>Scripture</HI> is plain as to this, that none of their sins are pardoned, nor shall be whilst they abide in their <HI>unbelief.</HI> Joh. 3.18. <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not be∣lieved on the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</HI> And Joh. 8.24. <HI>If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</HI> Now this is a very dreadful misery to have the guilt of all your sins lying upon you; to be liable to answer at the <HI>Bar of God</HI> (as shortly you must) for all the sins that ever you have committed. The <HI>Guilt</HI> of sin is a <HI>heavy bur∣then.</HI> Many have cried out with bitter distress and anguish of spirit, because of it in this World. The very forethoughts of this that God would <HI>bring them to Judgment,</HI> there to answer for the sins they have com∣mitted, hath made many to be a terror to themselves, it hath been insupportable to them. But when sin comes indeed to be charg'd upon sinners it will be unspeakably worse; and that on <HI>these Accounts.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>BECAUSE then Sinners will have a clearer sight of their sins then now they have.</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="001939_0160_0FBA247956E0A8B0"/>
Sinners will then have a fuller discovery of the nature, number and aggravations of their sins. Here they see but a few of them, they that have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ullest conviction of sin don't see all. There are multitudes of <HI>vain Thoughts, idle Words, omissions of Duty, com∣missions of Evil,</HI> that they took no notice of, or have now slipt their Memories: But then there will be a full discovery of them all; they will be Judg'd for <HI>all things they have done in the Body. Ungodly Sinners</HI> shall be <HI>convinc'd of all the ungodly deeds, and all the hard speeches they have done and spoken,</HI> Jude 15. <HI>God will bring every work into Judgment,</HI> Eccl. 12.14. The Judgment will be <HI>particular</HI> both as to <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Things.</HI> Not one of your sins did escape his knowledge, nor will any of them be forgotten. Then God will make good that Word, <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.21. A dread∣ful amazing sight it will be for a Man to have all his sins <HI>set in order before him.</HI> So many Enemies, yea so many <HI>Devils</HI> would not be such a horrid Spectacle! <HI>Conscience</HI> will then be fill'd with light and power, and will freely testify for God, and against the Sinner; will both remember him of his sins and the aggravating circumstances of them. Yea it may be <HI>Thousands</HI> of things that they never saw or believed to be sins, will then be produced against them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="152" REF="001939_0161_0FBA247AD040FED8"/>(2.) <HI>THEN Men will have another manner of sight of the Terror and Majesty of God against whom they have sinned, then now they have.</HI> Abundance of Persons now have slight thoughts of God's Power and Wrath; there∣fore are bold to sin, and secure after the commission of sin; they know but little of the power of his Anger, and the dreadful∣ness of his Wrath, but fancy God to be <HI>like themselves</HI>; but then God will give some discoveries of his Greatness and Majesty, and the <HI>terror of his Wrath</HI>: the very sight whereof will be intollerable to sinful crea∣tures; they will not be able to bear it, but will wish rather to be buried under <HI>Moun∣tains,</HI> and dash'd in pieces with <HI>Rocks,</HI> then to behold the Face of their offended Judge, <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.17. Then they will see and own the truth of what is said, Heb. 10.31. <HI>That it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>THERE will be no hope left that ever it shall be Pardoned.</HI> Here under the greatest distress of Conscience that sinners have been burthened with, there hath been this to mo∣derate them, that there hath at least been a <HI>possibility</HI> of <HI>Pardon</HI>; a <HI>Peradventure that God might give Repentance.</HI> And many who have been under deep distress of Spirit, have af∣terwards had experience of his Grace to their
<PB N="153" REF="001939_0162_0FBA2480203FF370"/>
abundant support and comfort. But there is no such expectation for those that die in their sins, that continue in their unbelief, and neglect of Christ; their <HI>Day of Grace is over</HI>; Mercy hath done with them: they have no more Invitations by a Saviour; the <HI>Patience</HI> of God is come to its utmost period with them, and that <HI>Wrath</HI> which they were so long <HI>preparing</HI> is now executed, and hath actually seiz'd them. Now, the <HI>hopelessness</HI> of their condition renders it inexpressibly doleful! There's no hopes of forgiveness! <HI>no more Sacrifice for sin</HI>!</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THEY must look to bear the Wrath and Curse of God which belongs to the Transgression of the Law.</HI> Guilt and Wrath are insepara∣ble Companions. They who have no inte∣rest in the <HI>Promises,</HI> must expect the execu∣tion of the <HI>Threatning.</HI> They who are not <HI>sav'd</HI> will be <HI>damned,</HI> Mar. 16.16. Joh. 3.36. They who don't hear that gracious Sentence from Christ, Mat. 25.34. <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, &amp;c.</HI> must hear that, ver. 41. <HI>De∣part ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire</HI>! In vain do any dream of a <HI>middle state</HI> between these. They who neglect the Salvation which the Gospel tenders will have nothing to secure them from the dreadful Wrath of God. The <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> will be no <HI>Advocate</HI> for them: He will put in no plea in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

your: nor will it be in the power of any creature either <HI>Angels</HI> or <HI>Men,</HI> to do any thing for their relief. What is the just wa∣ges and demerit of sin they must expect to bear. Now the <HI>Wrath of God due to sin</HI> is an intollerable burden; no misery is to be compared with this. As the Love &amp; Favour of God is a priviledge that is inconceivably great, so the Wrath and Anger of God is a misery proportionably dreadful. <HI>Who knows the power of his Anger,</HI> Psal. 90.11. Nah. 1.6. <HI>Who can stand before thine indignation? who can abide in the fierceness of thine anger?</HI> Much might be here spoken concerning the terri∣bleness of God's Anger in the punishments that it shall inflict upon Sinners, both with respect to the <HI>Privative</HI> and <HI>Positive</HI> effects of it. The guilty sinner is depriv'd at once of <HI>all his Comforts</HI> and all his <HI>Hopes.</HI> He hath neither any natural nor spiritual good; all his enjoyments, friends, pleasures or hopes, wherewith he diverted himself whilst he lived, are now at an end; and he will not have so much as a <HI>drop of Water</HI> to comfort him.</P>
<P>AND the <HI>Positive</HI> Evils that he shall suffer from the actual impressions of <HI>Divine Wrath,</HI> in the <HI>pains of sense</HI> that shall accompany this loss. The extensiveness of them as to the <HI>whole Man,</HI> both <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> and every <HI>part</HI> and <HI>faculty</HI> of them; and the <HI>intenseness</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="001939_0164_0FBA248A8365ACB8"/>
and <HI>extremity</HI> of them, so as to procure bitter out-cries and piercing lamentations: but especially in the <HI>eternal duration</HI> of them. The <HI>Scripture</HI> speaks largely concerning these things, and Men's thoughts may ex∣patiate upon them: but when they have gone to the utmost reach of a <HI>finite under∣derstanding</HI> in speaking or thinking of them, they vastly surpass all that can be thought or said! As none can describe the blessed∣ness of a Soul encircled in the Arms of Di∣vine Love, so none can express the misery of a Soul separated from God, and adjudg'd to the Society of <HI>Devils,</HI> and the inextinguish∣able flames of Divine Wrath!</P>
<P N="3">3. THEY will not only suffer the Wrath of God, <HI>but in a greater and sorer degree than others that have not been priviledged as they have.</HI> This is clear from that forecited <HI>Text, Mat.</HI> 11.22. Where our <HI>Saviour</HI> plainly asserts it. It is beyond question that there will be <HI>de∣grees</HI> of punishment in Hell, for <HI>the Judge of all the earth will do right.</HI> There shall be an impartial trial: Men shall be judg'd ac∣cording as their state shall be found to be, and accordingly as their sins have been ag∣gravated. We are told this, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.47, 48. <HI>That servant which knew his Lords will and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes, &amp;c.</HI> And
<PB N="156" REF="001939_0165_0FBA248B57E46CB0"/>
the more knowledge and love any have a∣bused, the more their guilt will be inhanced, and the more aggravated will their punish∣ment be. They will suffer more from their own <HI>Consciences</HI> in the terrible <HI>accusations</HI> and <HI>reproaches</HI> that they will bring against them. The reflections of Conscience upon the light they had, the warnings that were given them, the offers that were made them; the strivings of the Spirit that they were some∣times under, will be inexpressibly distressing to them. They will suffer more than others <HI>from the Devils</HI> who will be their <HI>Tormentors</HI> as well as Fellow-sufferers. They who now tempt them to sin, and to neglect the means of their Conversion and Salvation, will then upbraid them with it, and be ready to tell them, that if they had ever been priviledged as they were, they would never have been impos'd upon and deluded as they were, nor neglected the Grace offered them as they did. Yea, CHRIST Himself will then appear in greater terror towards them than other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, He will make them sensible by the splendor of his Majesty, what a Glorious Person they slighted and despised: And as one speaks, <Q>He that once came in a flame of Love to save Men, will then appear in flames of Wrath to take Ven∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> upon them that have not obeyed
<PB N="157" REF="001939_0166_0FBA248F5E844180"/>
the Gospel of God.</Q> The more Mercy Men have had and abused in this World, the more Wrath they must expect to feel in the World to come. And to add no more un∣der this Head; It will be a <HI>dreadful aggra∣vation</HI> of the misery of such to remember in how <HI>fair a way</HI> they once were for Salvati∣on, how <HI>near</HI> to the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI>; and for what base and mean things they forfeited it: for what trifles they cast away their <HI>Souls</HI>; and then Sinners will confess that the <HI>Scripture</HI> doth not miscall them, when it terms them <HI>Fools.</HI> They will fast enough load themselves with the opprobrious name, that <HI>they had a price in their hands to have got wisdom, but not a heart to improve it,</HI> Prov. 17.16.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WHENCE is it that the neglect of the Great Salvation of the Gospel shall have such a fearful Issue,</HI> Or, <HI>That the Misery of such Sinners will be so terrible and unavoidable?</HI></P>
<P>Two or Three Things may evidence it.</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE <HI>it is an abuse of the greatest Love and Mercy that God ever manifested to the World.</HI> The Scripture speaks of the love of God in the Gift of Christ as transcendent and superlative, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.10. God shews great Mercy to Man in giving them Food and Cloathing, and other ne∣cessaries
<PB N="158" REF="001939_0167_0FBA2490D3A32150"/>
and comforts of Life. But Infinite love shines forth in the Gift of Christ. God had nothing greater and better to give to the World, than his <HI>Own Son,</HI> an <HI>Only Son,</HI> most <HI>Dear</HI> to him, One in whom he took the highest pleasure and satisfaction; A <HI>Son</HI> that was the <HI>brightness of his Glory,</HI> and <HI>the express Image of his Person.</HI> To give him to endure such Sufferings, to submit to such a state of Humiliation and Abasement as he was pleas'd to do. For our sakes to bear the <HI>Curse</HI> that we might have the <HI>Blessing</HI>! to be made <HI>Sin</HI> that we might partake of his <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI>! to <HI>Die</HI> that we might <HI>Live! for us</HI> that could never profit him, nor recom∣pence him! to make a free offer of this Sal∣vation, yea to repeat the offer, it may be <HI>Hundreds</HI> of <HI>Thousands</HI> of Times to Sinners! and yet all this while to have this Glorious Saviour contemned, this Great Salvation trampled upon, and slighted, as if every triflle, vanity or lust were more desirable, this must needs provoke the heaviest Wrath. If Men know not the worth and glory of a Saviour, how to set a value upon the won∣derful wisdom, grace and love of God that hath appeared in the way of Salvation by him, and the blessed priviledges of it; yet surely God knows the worth of these things, and how to adjudge a proportionable punish∣ment
<PB N="159" REF="001939_0168_0FBA2492E020FDA8"/>
for it. And what sufferings of Sin∣ners can bear a proportion to an indignity cast upon so Glorious a Person? God hath sometimes severely animadverted upon those that have despised his <HI>Servants</HI>: and much more may it be expected that he will be severe upon those that <HI>don't reverence his Son.</HI> However ignorant and careless Sinners make light of this contempt of the Lord Je∣sus Christ: the <HI>Justice</HI> of God in inflicting deserved Vengeance for it will appear <HI>Glo∣rious</HI> in the Eyes of Angels and Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. BECAUSE <HI>such are guilty of refusing the only Remedy.</HI> This is the last and only re∣fuge or means of relief that God hath pro∣vided for Man's restoration to his Image and Favour since his Apostacy from God. We read, Rom. 8.3, 4. <HI>For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us.</HI> When <HI>Adam</HI> the sponsor and surety of the <HI>First Covenant,</HI> fail'd of obtaining Life, and Men through the loss of the Divine I∣mage were so weakened and disabled, that they could not answer their obligation to it, God was pleased to substitute the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> to procure Pardon and Life by a <HI>New
<PB N="160" REF="001939_0169_0FBA24952314C238"/>
Covenant.</HI> But in case this way of Salvation by Jesus Christ be rejected and slighted, God hath made no provision of <HI>Another.</HI> God hath laid out the treasures of his Wisdom and Love in providing of this way. Grace and Mercy towards Sinners have been glo∣rified in as high a degree as we can suppose it possible that they should. God hath <HI>no other Son</HI> to give to die in the Sinners stead, there was a necessity of Death to satisfy for trangressions against the Law. <HI>Without shed∣ding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f blood, there was no remission.</HI> Rivers of <HI>Blood of Beasts,</HI> that by Divine Appointment were shed before the great <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of Christ was offered, were insufficient to expiate sin. How then can it be thought that satisfaction should be made by any meer Creature, when the guilt rises higher by sins both against the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel</HI> too? What can ever ex∣piate for contempt cast upon the Blood of the Son of God? Sinners against the Gos∣pel must be left quite hopeless. God hath provided no remedy, nor is it in their own power to provide any. Therefore their destruction is certain and <HI>unavoidable.</HI> Nor will the Rivers of Tears shed by condemned Sinners in Hell ever be able to quench the flames of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE certainty of it is evident because <HI>the Justice and Truth of God requires it.</HI> The
<PB N="161" REF="001939_0170_0FBA249A469CE2E8"/>
Blessed God hath resolv'd upon it, that he will glorify his Son. The <HI>Word is gone out of his mouth in righteousness,</HI> and shall not be reversed, <HI>that every knee shall bow to him.</HI> The whole World shall be the triumphs of his <HI>Grace</HI> or <HI>Justice.</HI> The <HI>Scripture</HI> contains abundance of terrible comminations against unbelievers. It tells us, they <HI>shall be damned,</HI> that they shall <HI>never see Life,</HI> that the <HI>Wrath of God abides on them,</HI> &amp;c. Now these threat∣nings proceed from a God of invariable <HI>Truth,</HI> unspotted <HI>Justice,</HI> and Almighty <HI>Power,</HI> and will surely be accomplish'd. There is many times a <HI>secret hope</HI> nourished in the hearts of Sinners that God will not be so strict and severe as to execute his threatnings upon them, or if he doth, he will not do it in so terrible a manner, as he hath threatned. But these hopes are pre∣sumptuous and ungrounded. God hath left no foundation for Sinners to build them upon. His threatnings are no rash and sud∣den determinations as Mens often are; but are a sanction of the Gospel Covenant, which God in his Eternal Wisdom and Counsel hath determined and established, therefore will not recede or go back from them. God is unalterably just and true in his <HI>Threatnings</HI> as well as in his <HI>Promises. He is not a man that he should lie, or the son of man
<PB N="162" REF="001939_0171_0FBA24A043156DC0"/>
that he should repent,</HI> Jam. 1.15. There's no expectation that God will alter his mind, or that he can ever want <HI>Power</HI> to execute his threatnings. Besides the <HI>Sufferings of Christ</HI> are a convincing proof of the Truth of them. God spar'd him not when sin was imputed to him: there was a necessity that he should drink the bitter Cup of Divine Wrath, that the Justice and Truth of God might be glorified. And if Justice would not spare the Son of God neither will it spare guilty Sinners. <HI>If these things were done in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</HI></P>
<P>THESE Things may be sufficient to con∣firm the Truth before us, That the de∣struction of such as neglect the Salvation offered in the Gospel will be <HI>Certain</HI> and Unavoidable.</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> THIS Truth may evidence the <HI>fearful blindness and sottishness that many Sinners are under, who neglect the Salvation ten∣dered to them by Jesus Christ in the Gospel.</HI> It is evident from hence, because there will be <HI>no possibility of escaping God's sorest Wrath and Vengeance</HI> if this Salvation be neglected. This way of Salvation which the Gospel pro∣pounds by Jesus Christ is so suitable to the state of fallen Man, so accommodated to
<PB N="163" REF="001939_0172_0FBA24A1A22E7148"/>
answer all his necessities; to relieve him un∣der all his wants and fears; so safe a way, and a way wherein so much of the Grace, Love and Wisdom of God hath appeared, that its own excellency and beneficialness may justly recommend it to all to whom the offer of it is made; but when, together with this, there is such an unavoidable certainty of misery unto all them that neglect it, one might justly expect that every Man should be most deeply concern'd to secure an in∣terest in it, and use utmost diligence to make it his own. But alas! How much doth a contrary spirit appear! What carelessness, slightness and indifferency do abundance manifest in this matter? As if it were a thing of little weight or worth, that they might do well enough in the neglect of. The <HI>Apostle</HI> assigns the true reason hereof, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.3, 4. Were not Men under fearful <HI>blind∣ness</HI> and <HI>strong delusions</HI> from the <HI>god of this World,</HI> it could not be that they should thus neglect their own Mercies. This may be further manifested,</P>
<P N="1">1. IN that <HI>they act so contrary to what they profess to be their Interest.</HI> It is a thing which Men generally, if not universally, acknow∣ledge to be necessary to take care of the Salvation of their Souls, and provide for a future happiness; that if Christ be not their
<PB N="164" REF="001939_0173_0FBA24A296B998B0"/>
Surety and Saviour, they are miserable: that the life and safety of their Souls depends upon their Faith in Christ, and Repentance towards God, but yet they act as if they loved Death, and could be contented to venture Damnation. Tho' a Saviour be offered them, yet they neglect or defer clo∣sing with him. Were they not under a strange infatuation blinded with the love of Sin, or the love of the World, it could not be that they should leave their Souls at this hazard, and run such a venture of perishing for ever: especially when they know their opportunities are continually passing from them, and they know not how soon God may put a period to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN that this is the only way wherein there is any hopes of obtaining Salvation. If this way ben't closed with there is no hope of relief by any other. The Word of God assures us that as there is One God, so there is <HI>One Mediator between God and Men,</HI> and there is but <HI>One.</HI> Foolish Men have multiplied mediators as well as gods; but God never appointed but One. And it is thro' him alone that Salvation is attainable, Act. 4.12. <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any o∣ther for there is no other name given among men whereby we must be saved.</HI> God never sav'd any of the Children of Men upon any other

account, and there's no room to expect he ever will. It must be owned that Heaven is the Lord's, and he may give it to whom he will; and upon what terms he will. But our Saviour tells us, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.6. That he is <HI>the way the truth and life, that no man comes to the father but by him.</HI> You must take this way or perish for ever. They who will not have Heaven upon Christ's terms must go with∣out it. Now when the case is thus, it must be a most strange infatuation and delusion they are under who neglect it.</P>
<P N="3">3. IN that <HI>God hath given as clear and evi∣dent proofs of the certainty of this way of Salva∣tion as can in reason be desired, and of his wil∣lingness to bestow it upon the terms propounded in the Gospel.</HI> So that they can't pretend a want of sufficient Warrant for encourage∣ment to believe. God in his Word plainly discovers to Men what their sinful helpless and undone condition is; and how impossi∣ble it is to them to get righteousness and life by the Law. He hath also plainly dis∣covered the sufficiency and acceptableness of the satisfaction that Christ hath made: that he is well pleased in him: that it was a way of his own contriving; that he <HI>sanctified him, and sent him into the World,</HI> Joh. 10.36. That <HI>the blood of Christ cleanses from all sin,</HI> Joh. 1.7. His Satisfaction was fully commensurate to
<PB N="166" REF="001939_0175_0FBA24AC2FDA4650"/>
the demands of the Law and Justice of God. Believers have the sure Word and <HI>Promise</HI> of God to depend upon in this matter, yea he hath confirmed it by his <HI>Oath,</HI> to this end (as the <HI>Apostle</HI> assures in, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.17, 18.) That the <HI>Heirs of Promise might have strong Consolation.</HI> God formerly confirmed his Word by miraculous works, and still con∣firms it by many supernatural effects: in a∣wakening, quieting and comforting the Consciences of Sinners; filling them with <HI>Joy unspeakable:</HI> and sanctifying their hearts; which are a kind of Inchoation of Glory. Now after the truth of the Gospel hath been so fully confirmed, and is so generally ac∣knowledged; for Men to be careless about the Salvation that it offers; doth surely flow from the blinding hardening power of sin, and the delusions impos'd upon them by the great Adversary of their Souls.</P>
<P><HI>USE II.</HI> TO <HI>Awaken and Reprove such Persons as neglect the Great Salvation.</HI> I in∣tend here all such as are not seriously and deeply concerned to have their hearts brought to a full compliance with the terms upon which it is offered; to abandon their sinful ways, to renounce a dependance upon their own righteousness, and to commit their Souls in a way of believing unto the
<PB N="167" REF="001939_0176_0FBA24AD07CF2540"/>
Lord Jesus Christ, as the Gospel requires: but spend their days in security, in carnal and sensual delights, in an eager prosecution of the profits of the World, or that in the pride of their hearts are seeking to establish a righteousness <HI>as it were by the works of the Law</HI>; and spend their days in sinful dispon∣dency, and vain and fruitless cavils against the duty of believing in Christ, which the Gospel urges unto. I shall mention a few things here, to promote the Awakening and Conviction of such Persons.</P>
<P>Consider, 1. <HI>HOW great contempt of the Grace and Mercy and Condescention of God you are guilty of, by neglecting Christ and the Salva∣tion he offers to you.</HI> The offers of Salvation that are made to sinners are fruits of free and undeserved Grace. God had no need of Man's friendship or service, had just ad∣vantage by the Law against him to have glorified himself in the executions of his Justice upon him: but notwithstanding was pleas'd in sovereign Mercy to provide and reveal a way of Salvation, wherein he would discover his own Perfections, and provide for the happiness of Man. And as the <HI>A∣postle</HI> here informs us, hath sent <HI>His Own Son,</HI> to work out this Salvation for us, and to publish it to us. It is that which <HI>began to be
<PB N="168" REF="001939_0177_0FBA24AE87256050"/>
spoken to us by the Lord.</HI> The ever blessed Lord Jesus Christ was willing to come him∣self from the bosom of his Father to pur∣chase and publish Salvation. Now the greatness of the Person sent upon this great errand and design carries the greater obli∣gation in it to all to accept the offer, and heightens the sin in the refusal of it. God was justly offended with the <HI>Jews</HI> that they <HI>despised his Servants</HI>; and expected that sure∣ly they would <HI>reverence his Son,</HI> when he sent him among them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.57. The fuller and clearer the revelations of divine Grace are to Men, the greater assurance God gives of his readiness to accept them, and bestow Salvation in this way, there is the greater contempt in neglect and refusal of it. The not hearkening to the <HI>Law of God delivered by Angels at Mount Sinai,</HI> was a contempt of God's Authority, and <HI>received a just recom∣pence of reward</HI>; As the <HI>Apostle</HI> tells us in the <HI>Verse</HI> before our <HI>Text.</HI> But it is a much greater contempt to disobey the <HI>Gospel</HI> which was <HI>Preached by Christ</HI> himself. In the one God is despised, speaking by his Servants, in the other by his <HI>Son.</HI> There hath been a great deal of contempt cast upon God by Sinners in all Ages, they under-value his goodness, slight his threatnings, trample up∣on his authority, walk contrary to his com∣mands:
<PB N="169" REF="001939_0178_0FBA24B6A9488EC8"/>
which gave occasion to that of the <HI>Psalmist, Psal.</HI> 10.13. <HI>Wherefore d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the wick∣ed contemn God</HI>! It is an unreasonable and injurious thing that they should do so; but in this case the contempt rises higher, be∣cause not only his Authority is contemned which requires Men to obey the Gospel, but his Grace and Love in the highest disco∣veries of them are slighted and undervalued, as though the rich offers that he makes, were not worthy of your serious regards, did not deserve your thoughts, or the employing your time about. <HI>Do ye thus requite the Lord?</HI> Doth the blessed Jesus deserve no better re∣quital for all the Testimonies he hath given of his tender concern for you?</P>
<P>Consider, 2. <HI>THE inexpressible wrong you do to your own Souls.</HI> Nature teaches Men to love themselves, to seek their own good, and especially requires a due concern for the best part of themselves, their Souls. These being of greater excellency and worth then their Bodies, deserve the highest regards from them. But they that neglect a Saviour disregard and undervalue their own Souls, interpretatively <HI>they love Death.</HI> They bring the most certain and inexpressible misery upon their own Souls. They cut themselves off from any hope of acceptance with God,
<PB N="170" REF="001939_0179_0FBA24B90A38D240"/>
and any title to a blessed Immortality, and bring upon themselves certain and unavoida∣ble misery: yea at present they do un∣speakable wrong to their own Souls, in de∣priving them of all true <HI>comfort.</HI> They can have no pardon of Sin, no peace with God, no hope in the Promises, no priviledge of access to him. These are all obtained by Christ, and communicated only for his sake and upon his account to Believers; and they deprive them also of that which is their <HI>Beauty,</HI> their <HI>Honour,</HI> their <HI>Life</HI>; even that <HI>Holiness</HI> and Sanctification which is a main part of the Salvation which Christ invites Sinners to come to him for. A Soul desti∣tute of holiness is a loathsom vile thing in the Eyes of God. 'Tis fit to do him no ser∣vice, to perform no acceptable duty, to ex∣ert no act of Grace: is enslaved to its own lusts; hurried by its irregular passions; a ready instrument of Satan to serve his de∣signs; is often hurried as that miserable <HI>Demoniack,</HI> Mark 5.5. <HI>To cut and wound and tear himself.</HI> Is pulling down many spiritual Judgments upon himself. If Christ ben't accepted as a Saviour to you, you have none of these blessings from him: the spirit of holiness is his peculiar purchase and gift. <HI>He saves his people from their Sins.</HI> He enligh∣tens their minds, renews their wills, purifies
<PB N="171" REF="001939_0180_0FBA24BA9CD637A8"/>
hearts, conveys and cherishes all spiritual life in them. Now can you be content to be an utter stranger to all true holiness? To live under the tyranny of Satan, and reign of Sin? To have a Soul utterly unservicea∣ble to God while you live, and unfit and unworthy of any fellowship with God when you must die? Now thus it must be if the gracious offers that Christ makes be rejected and slighted. How unworthy the name of a <HI>Man</HI> is he that suffers a Soul to be thus neg∣lected and ruined?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>YOU oppose, and as much as in you lies, frustrate one main design that God hath been car∣rying on from the beginning of the World.</HI> The work of <HI>Redemption</HI> is one of the great and most glorious Works of God which hath been upon his Heart before the foundations of the World; and whereby he designed to raise Eternal honour and glory to himself, and to bring about the greatest good to his Elect. Now the means of effecting this, is by bringing Men to, <HI>Repentance and Faith</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ; submitting to the terms of the Gospel. This is that which God calls Men to, when he brings his Gospel to any place. The great duty he urges Men unto is not to receive the Grace of God in vain. Now it is in vain if his end be not
<PB N="172" REF="001939_0181_0FBA24BD51EFEB40"/>
attained; if Men neglect the duty enjoyned in order to God's Glory, and their own good. Now when Men act contrary to the end of God, it may be reasonably concluded that it is very offensive to him; as on the other hand it is pleasing to him when his end is attained. Hence we read, that our Saviour <HI>rejoyced in Spirit,</HI> upon the report that the <HI>Disciples</HI> brought him of the <HI>success of their Ministry,</HI> Luk. 10.21. Now he enjoyed the end of his coming. We read, that <HI>there is joy in Heaven</HI> upon a Sinners Repentance, <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.7, 10. Heaven rings with joy at the report of it; that God is glorified, and a Soul rescued from destruction; and it is matter of <HI>great joy and refreshing</HI> to those <HI>whom God sends upon this Errand,</HI> to <HI>beseech Men to be reconciled to God.</HI> When they see the glory of God advanc'd in the Salvation of Men, then they shall be able to give up their account with joy. And at another time you read, of Christ's being grieved <HI>be∣cause of the hardness of Mens hearts,</HI> Mar. 8.5. That they did not believe notwithstanding the evident proofs that he gave of his Divi∣nity. And at another time of his <HI>weeping over Jerusalem, because they understood not the things of their peace in the day of their visitation.</HI> Now will you grieve and displease the ever blessed God in crossing him in an end so
<PB N="173" REF="001939_0182_0FBA24C40982FB78"/>
gracious and so glorious? Wherein your own welfare is enwrap'd so much with his honour? Will you rather choose to gratify your Lusts and please the Devil that would destroy you, then to pour out your Souls in earnest cries that his Grace may be effectual in bringing your hearts to comply with the duty that the Gospel requires of you? That God may be glorified and your Souls saved.</P>
<P N="4">4. BY neglecting the Grace tendred to you in the Gospel <HI>you are guilty of much re∣sistance and opposition to the Spirit of God.</HI> The Dispensation of the Gospel is called by the <HI>Apostle,</HI> the <HI>Ministration of the Spirit,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.8. Probably upon this account especially, because there is more of the Spirit goes along with it, then any before it, as he al∣so else-where intimates. There are very few, if any, who live to years of understand∣ing, but they are many times under the strivings of the Spirit, awakening and con∣vincing of them, causing of them to see their sin and danger, exciting many terrors in their Consciences, and putting them in mind of the necessity of Christ, of Faith, and of Repentance. Some improve and yield to these motions of the Spirit, and they are preparatory to their Eternal safety. But these that neglect the Salvation offered
<PB N="174" REF="001939_0183_0FBA24C72BA5D018"/>
them, refuse and <HI>resist the Holy Ghost</HI> in his motions upon them; bear down the light they receive, suppress the convictions they have from the Spirit of God, and so become guilty of sinning against more Grace and Love. Our <HI>Apostle</HI> intimates in the <HI>verse</HI> after our <HI>Text,</HI> that this was one great ag∣gravation of Mens neglecting the Great Sal∣vation, that it was a Doctrine which had been attested to by divers <HI>extraordinary opera∣tions of the Holy Ghost.</HI> And as these for∣merly left Men inexcusable, so will the pre∣sent sensible operations of the Spirit upon Mens hearts, leave Men so now. They feel a divine power going along with the Word, whereby it sensibly touches their Consciences, convinces of sin, and in God's name condemns for it; urges to Repentance and Faith in Christ, in order to peace and pardon with God. So that they cannot but confess these things to be their duty. Now how tremendous a consideration is this, that you should he guilty of resisting the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and withstanding the methods of di∣vine Grace, to recover and save you? To slight the favour of God, to make a light ac∣count of the Blood of Christ? To disregard the Promises, and despise the Threatnings of the Gospel, which rise higher than any be∣fore, and to resist the spirit of God too in
<PB N="175" REF="001939_0184_0FBA24C80E3ADA50"/>
its application of them: how inexcusable will you be?</P>
<P><HI>USE III.</HI> OF <HI>Warning to all such as have hitherto neglected the Great Salvation ten∣dred in the Gospel, no longer to persist in your neglect of it.</HI> It is too long you have done so already; there's no just apology or plea that you can make for it; and you will ren∣der your case the worse by persisting in a thing so sinful and unreasonable. There are none of you but will cry out of, and con∣demn the blindness and obstinacy of the <HI>Jews</HI> that had the first tender of Gospel Grace, but neglected and refus'd it: and withstood their own Mercies. Why then will you imitate their practice, continue care∣less of your own Souls, and provoke God to exclude you as he hath them? 'Tis your priviledge at present to enjoy the light of the Gospel, with all clearness and liberty: the best Mercies are freely tendred to you. God justly expects that his offers be received thankfully, and a due entertainment given to the Lord Jesus Christ; that you don't prefer sins and lusts before a Saviour: that you be not diverted by your Worldly inte∣rests and designs, from securing Heavenly and Eternal mercies. It will be a thing of doleful consequence if after such opportuni∣ties and encouragements you fail of Eternal
<PB N="176" REF="001939_0185_0FBA24C98C5E8CB8"/>
Life. How stinging will be the reproaches of Conscience for it? To enforce this matter,</P>
<P>Consi. 1. <HI>THE greatness of this sin of Unbe∣lief,</HI> in rejecting Christ and the Salvation that he offers. It is not without cause that God hath so often fixed <HI>Damnation</HI> to it, and so plainly threatned the ruine of those that continue in it. Too often this sin is look'd upon as a small matter, as if it were their <HI>misery</HI> rather than their <HI>sin</HI> that it is <HI>not in their power to believe</HI> without the assistance of the Spirit of God. Yea some that startle at other sins, don't tremble at this; but this is a sin that is very sinful, and many ways aggravated in the sight of God. This may appear in that this sin flows from the wickedness of Men's hearts, as all other sins do: it flows from the blindness of Men's minds, and the many unworthy thoughts of God that they are ready to entertain. They doubt of his Wisdom, his Holiness &amp; Truth. They are more ready to lay weight upon the word of a Man, than upon the Word of God. Unbelief reflects upon the Truth and Faithfulness of God. Hence it is said, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.10. <HI>He that believeth not God hath made him a liar.</HI> How fearful a thing is it, to re∣proach the God of truth, and One that can∣not lie? It disparages and virtually denies
<PB N="177" REF="001939_0186_0FBA24CB1BAC32B0"/>
the suffic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ency of Christ, as if He were not a fit object of Trust; not such a compleat Saviour as God testifies him to be, One that is <HI>able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by him.</HI> It disparages the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God, as if he had busied his thoughts to pro∣vide a way of Salvation for Men that they had no need of. It is a sin that is rooted in the pride, perverseness and obstinacy of Men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s hearts. Hence Christ saith to them, Joh. 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me that ye may have life.</HI> 'Tis a sin that is committed a∣gainst more Grace, Mercy and Love then many other sins are. Hence it is said to be in a peculiar manner the damning sin, the sin that binds the guilt of all other sins upon the Soul, and cuts it off from the last and only remedy. It is a sin of a very heinous and horrible nature; therefore justly to be dreaded and deprecated.</P>
<P>Consi. 2. <HI>WHAT Misery this sin of neg∣lecting the Great Salvation offered by Christ hath brought upon others.</HI> If we only look into the state of the <HI>Jews,</HI> their example is very in∣structive and awakening. The <HI>Apostle</HI> tells us, Rom. 11.20. That <HI>for unbelief they were broken off.</HI> Their sin was exceeding great in <HI>Crucifying the Prince of Life.</HI> But it pleased God to make them the offer of the Salvation that was purchased by that precious Blood
<PB N="178" REF="001939_0187_0FBA24D330F829D0"/>
afterward, and had they accepted the offer, it had been effectual to have expiated that crying sin. But for their Unbelief God re∣jected them. They were once a People <HI>highly favoured by God</HI>; there was no People in the World for many Generations so pe∣culiarly priviledg'd by God as they were, (as were easy to shew in many instances) But now as the <HI>Apostle</HI> tells us, <HI>Wrath is come upon them to the uttermost,</HI> 1 Thes. 2.16. None of their priviledges could secure them from an astonishing desolation. <HI>Historians</HI> ob∣serve this as remarkable in their desolation, that God pick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out one of the most <HI>merci∣ful Emperors</HI> that ever sway'd the <HI>Roman Scepter,</HI> to be the Instrument of it, that their destruction might appear to be from the Hand of Heaven, rather than from the cruel∣ty of Man. And very dismal was their deso∣latio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Eleven Hundred Thousand</HI> are said to hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ished by the <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Famine,</HI> and <HI>Ninety Thousand</HI> were sold for Slaves. And <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c.</HI> Nation hath continued under the dread∣ful frowns of Heaven, for now almost <HI>One Thousand Seven Hundred</HI> Years. And <HI>if God spared not the natural branches,</HI> as the <HI>Apostle</HI> argues, <HI>others</HI> have no reason <HI>to be high-mind∣ed but fear.</HI> But it is not only Temporal but Eternal misery too, that this sin hath brought upon innumerable multitudes of
<PB N="179" REF="001939_0188_0FBA24D41B27F338"/>
miserable Men. <HI>Hell</HI> is the place and <HI>por∣tion</HI> of Unbelievers.</P>
<P>Consi. 3. <HI>HOW uncapable you are to perform any act of duty to God, or to find acceptance with God in any service you perform, 'till you are in∣terested in this Salvation by Faith in Christ, and a saving Conversion to God.</HI> It is only in the Name and upon the account of Christ that our Persons and services come to be of any account with God. Without Christ, <HI>God is a consuming Fire,</HI> ready to consume and destroy all the works and workers of iniqui∣ty. The <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> accepts of no obedience but that of a holy Person, and free from all imperfection. And you have no claim by the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> 'till the terms of it are consented to. If therefore you are not united to Christ by Faith, have not the spirit of holiness, enlivening of you, you can't plead acceptance in anything that you do. God takes no pleasure in them, they will not be rewarded or crowned by God at last. Yea, if you are destitute of a principle of Faith and Love to God, they are all done for some corrupt end or other, are not a service to God, but to some Lust. Hence the very <HI>Praying</HI> as well as <HI>Plowing of the wicked is sin.</HI> This duty now urg'd upon you is fundamental to all holy and gracious actions. Were this thing alone
<PB N="180" REF="001939_0189_0FBA24D5875A7240"/>
duly considered it might be enough to make you afraid of continuing any longer in the neglect of this Great Salvation.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THINK how uncertain your opportunity of obtaining the Salvation that the Gospel offers may be.</HI> God hath been a long time ten∣dring the Blessings of the Gospel to you; but he hath set bounds to his Patience how long it shall be exercised; not only towards Men in <HI>general,</HI> but towards <HI>particular Persons.</HI> And you know not what bounds God hath set to it, when you shall come to the period of it. Persons of all ranks and ages many times go <HI>suddenly</HI> down to the Grave. They who are ready to reckon upon many years, many times find such a summons by Death as he did, Luk. 12.21. <HI>This night thy Soul shall be required of thee.</HI> It falls out with <HI>ma∣ny</HI> as is threatned, 1 Thes. 5.3. When <HI>they cry peace and safety sudden destruction as travel upon a woman with child,</HI> seizes upon them. The getting out of a state of Sin into a state of Grace and Salvation is a work of great difficulty, and ordinarily will require time. Your own corruptions will rise in opposition against it. <HI>Satan</HI> will do all he can to divert and discourage you. Therefore you can't be too earnest or too speedy about it; if this be neglected in the day of probation afford∣ed you, <HI>rivers of Tears</HI> throughout the ages of
<PB N="181" REF="001939_0190_0FBA24D70B3969C0"/>
Eternity will not do that for you which the <HI>Blood of Christ</HI> applied by Faith is able to do, even to atone the Wrath of a sin-revenging God. Let the consideration of these things prevail with you without any further delay to break off your sins, however secret, plea∣sing or profitable they have been. To cry mightily to God for the convincing, hum∣bling and converting power of his Spirit, to accompany all Gospel Dispensations and Or∣dinances. Yield a present obedience to the motions of the Spirit upon your hearts, whe∣ther by the Word or Providences of God. Listen to no thoughts of delay, or presump∣tions of future Time and Grace, and deep∣ly bewail your past neglects. This will give hope that your <HI>Souls shall live and not die.</HI></P>
<P>FOR a <HI>CONCLUSION</HI> to this <HI>Dis∣course</HI> I shall add.</P>
<P><HI>USE IV.</HI> OF EXHORTATION, To <HI>all that have professedly embraced and accepted the Great Salvation that hath been offered in the Gospel, and are waiting for the full accomplish∣ment of it; That you would unfeignedly make it your care to answer the great design of God, and to walk worthy of your Priviledge.</HI> Christians need arguments of <HI>Terror</HI> as well as of <HI>Com∣fort and Hope,</HI> to bind them to their duty.

The Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stle tho' he felt the constraining power of the love of Christ, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.14. and was careful of his duty upon that ground, yet in the same <HI>Chapter</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Ter∣rors of the Lord</HI> had an influence upon him, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. The certain and inexpressible mi∣sery of such as neglect this Great Salvation should be a powerful inducement to all who profess to hope for the blessings of it, to walk and live so that they may'nt <HI>seem to come short of it.</HI> We are acquainted what was the great design of the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and what is the duty of the <HI>Redeemed,</HI> Tit. 2.11. <HI>to</HI> 14. Your own reason and conscience cannot choose but acknowledge the suita∣bleness of this. Would the <HI>ever Blessed God</HI> be at the expence of such Wisdom, Grace and Love, that he might restore sinful Man to his Favour and Image, and design him to be a partaker of an Inheritance in Heaven, and not manage this design in a way suita∣ble to his own <HI>Holiness?</HI> Would the <HI>Blessed Jesus</HI> submit to such Abasement and Suffer∣ing, that he might expiate sin, and after∣ward allow his People to give any counte∣nance or indulgence to it in their hearts or lives? Would the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> in a powerful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nner dispense his Grace to Sinners in their Conversion and Sanctification, and not expect a due improvement of the principles
<PB N="183" REF="001939_0192_0FBA24E00C1CBD10"/>
implanted in them? And that they show the reallity and efficacy of Grace upon their Souls, in the holiness of their lives? Both these the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks plainly to, 2 Cor. 5.15. <HI>If one died for all then were all dead, that they that live should not henceforth live to them∣selves but to him that died for them.</HI> And, Gal. 4.25. If you <HI>live in the spirit, see that you walk in the spirit.</HI> The Grace wrought in your <HI>Hearts</HI> by the Spirit, should appear in your <HI>Lives:</HI> The <HI>Sobriety</HI> of your hearts, in eating and drinking, and in the temperate use of all lawful delights: the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of your hearts, in your justice, honesty, faithfulness in all your dealings in your truth and charity: the <HI>Piety</HI> of your hearts in a gracious performance of all acts of Worship: with that reverence, faith, love, as may testify to your own Souls, and as much as may be to the consciences of others, that your Religion is not pageantry and hy∣pocrisy, but the genuine effect of the Grace and Spirit of Christ upon your hearts. In sum, your great duty is to <HI>adorn the Gospel,</HI> to live so as to make it evident, that you do indeed believe the <HI>Promises,</HI> and love the <HI>Precepts</HI> of it. Be <HI>Exhorted</HI> to <HI>Two Things.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. TO a <HI>daily exercise of Faith upon the Lord Jesus Christ, for all the parts of the Great
<PB N="184" REF="001939_0193_0FBA24E189F1C6C0"/>
Salvation</HI> (reveal'd and promis'd to you in the Gospel) <HI>as you stand in need of it.</HI> The <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> contains in it the Promi∣ses of all needful good things whether for this Life or for that which is to come. And it is the great duty of the People of God in a way of believing in Christ (who is the <HI>Mediator</HI> and Head of that Covenant) to look to God for the communication of them as their necessities do require. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.19. and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30. God will have <HI>all Men honour the Son, as they honour the Father.</HI> Now one great means of their doing it, is by their de∣pendance upon him, by coming to God in his Name and Worthiness for <HI>all</HI> the blessings they stand in need of.</P>
<P>LET it be your care then to act Faith upon the Lord Jesus Christ, for your pre∣servation in a <HI>state of justification, and for the comfort of it.</HI> Holiness in the People of God is incompleat. Corruption is still in being, and the flesh will be lusting against the spi∣rit; sin will break forth into act: and this will give Satan advantage to bring in accu∣sations against you; stir up fears and dis∣quiets in your consciences: whether you shall obtain pardon from God. Now at the same time you fall down before God in penitent confessions of sin, it is your duty to renew Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ for

pardoning Mercy. You read, Rom. 1.17. <HI>That the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith.</HI> As Faith brings a Sinnner in∣to a justified estate, so by Faith he is pre∣served in it. God directs you to take this course, 1 Joh. 2.1. <HI>If any man sin we have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins.</HI> It is the duty of Believers to watch against and beat down a self-righteous spirit, not to expect their pardon upon account of their sorrows for present guilt, for past services, or future purposes of better obedience. But to remember, that as by the Righteous∣ness of Christ, they are at first brought into a justified estate, so by his <HI>Intercession</HI> for them, they are continued in it; and it is their work to honour Christ by renewed acts of Faith.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Let it be your care to act Faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, for your <HI>preserva∣tion and progress in a state of Sanctification.</HI> This is another principal part of our Salvation, and it is derived from Christ who is said to be <HI>made of God, for sanctification</HI>: to be <HI>our Life, &amp;c.</HI> He that is acquainted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he holiness of God, and the sinfulness and wretchedness of his own heart, his manifold enemies; will see need of a greater power then his own for the preservation and in∣crease

of the life of Grace in his own Soul. Now God hath graciously provided for the help of his People in Christ, for the carry∣ing on of this work. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.26. And you must honour Christ by <HI>believing the Promises</HI> he hath made of it. Such as these, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26, 27. <HI>Micah</HI> 7.19. <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.10. By <HI>im∣proving the Means</HI> he hath appointed for it; the <HI>Word, Sacraments</HI> and <HI>Prayer.</HI> Enforcing the <HI>Precepts</HI> he hath given for it, and the rule of it, the encouragements he hath given to it, and by a daily recourse to, and depen∣dance on him, in all your conflicts and temp∣tations; and for strength and assistance in all duties and services, under a sense of your own nothingness. In this way Christ is wont to promote Holiness, and cherish Grace in the hearts of his People, to make <HI>his power glorious in their weakness,</HI> to give them cause to say with the Apostle, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Exercise Faith in a dependance upon Christ <HI>for acceptance of your persons and services with God.</HI> Believers are wont to have mean and low thoughts of themselves, and of the services they do for God: And it is very fit they should: Considering how mean and vile they are, and how much sin is interwoven in their best services. This prevails sometimes to sinking discourage∣ments, lest God should disacc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, and

all they do. But under the deepest appre∣hensions of your own unworthiness it be∣comes you to entertain honourable thoughts of the worthiness of Christ: to behold the Humane Nature exalted in him, to see God well pleased with him. And who tells us, Eph. 1.6. <HI>We are accepted in the beloved.</HI> To look to the fulness of his Satisfaction, the prevalency of his Intercession: Who as the great <HI>High-Priest</HI> hath entred into the Hea∣vens for us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.20. Bears the <HI>Names</HI> of his People upon his <HI>Breast,</HI> presents their Persons and Services; atones for their de∣fects; perfumes them with his Merit. This will keep up your drooping spirits.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Act Faith upon the Lord Je∣sus Christ <HI>with respect to your expectations of future Glory and Immortality,</HI> (in the enjoy∣ment whereof this Great Salvation will be compleated.) It is to be lamented that not only the greatest part of those that live in the common light of Christianity, are blind∣ed and can't see afar off, are govern'd by sense and appetite, and are craving only pleasure, profit and honour, think not of the <HI>vast Eternity,</HI> to which they are hastning; but even God's own People need to have a more clear and firm perswasion, and lively sense of things to come; will venture little upon the hopes of them, are so little affected
<PB N="188" REF="001939_0197_0FBA24EC29092C38"/>
with them, take so little pains for the clear∣ing up, and evidencing their title to them, and are much more swaved with the views of temporal advantages, then with the hopes of Eternal Mercies. This tends greatly to the dishonour of Christ. But some there are to whom these things are real; who are <HI>looking for the blessed hope,</HI> Tit. 2.14. <HI>For a City that hath foundations,</HI> Heb. 11.10. Are contemplating the Glory of the Heavenly state, the Rich Inheritance of the Saints. And while viewing the greatness of it, are ready with trembling hearts to say, <HI>Who shall ascend the Hill of the Lord, and stand in his Holy Place?</HI> It may support your hearts in this case, to look <HI>by Faith</HI> upon it, as a <HI>Purchased Possession,</HI> Eph. 1.14. Christ Jesus hath laid down the price of Heaven for his People, fulfill'd the condition of Eternal Life in his perfect Obedience to the Law. That he hath carried our Nature into it, and taken possession of it as a forerunner and surety for his People. And especially may this quiet your hearts in the expectation of it, that Heaven itself, as great and as rich an Inheritance as it is, is not a greater Gift then Christ is: And if God had love enough to his People to <HI>give his Son,</HI> he don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t want love to give <HI>Heaven.</HI> You may conclude with the Apostle, Rom, Rom. 8.32. <HI>He
<PB N="189" REF="001939_0198_0FBA24ED82EE80E8"/>
that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him freely give us all things?</HI> I only <HI>briefly</HI> touch these things. But it is not in these only, but in all <HI>Conditions of Life,</HI> in all <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Trials,</HI> it is your <HI>duty,</HI> and will be your <HI>comfort</HI> to keep up the exercise of Faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. BE Exhorted to a <HI>Life of Universal O∣bedience and Holy Walking before God.</HI> The Apostle tells us, Heb. 5.9. <HI>He is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</HI> Christ came not into the World to countenance licentiousness in his People; to lessen Gods sovereignty over us, or free us from our duty to him. He is a <HI>King and Lawgiver</HI> as well as <HI>Saviour</HI> to his Peo∣ple. 'Tis his aim to make them holy as well as happy. Indeed this ought deserved∣ly to be look'd upon as <HI>a main part of our hap∣piness,</HI> as well as the way leading to it. And there is no sincere choice of Christ, and sub∣jection to him, where he is not received as a King as well as Saviour. It is an abuse of the Grace of Christ manifested in the Gos∣pel, when Persons presume upon inpunity, while they allow themselves in sin. Christ by <HI>suffering for sin</HI> hath given us the clearest representation of the evil nature of sin, and its extream offensiveness to God. By the ho∣liness
<PB N="190" REF="001939_0199_0FBA2110CFD61F78"/>
of his Life he hath given us the most ex∣cellent <HI>pattern</HI> of Obedience: and by the purity of his Laws, hath given us the most perfect <HI>rule</HI> of Obedience. All which things clearly shew, it is what he expects from all his People. The honour of God, their ho∣nourable Relation to him, their hopes from him, and the experiences of his Grace to∣wards them, there own comfort in the ex∣pectation of the blessings he hath promised them, are all Motives to such a Conversa∣tion. The great duty of the Gospel is <HI>Love.</HI> Now Love to Christ is especially to be ex∣press'd by <HI>Obedience</HI>; as in that Precept of Christ, Joh. 14.15. <HI>If ye love me keep my Commandments.</HI> And that this is the most clear and genuine fruit of Love, Christ fur∣ther declares, in <HI>ver.</HI> 21.23, 4. Gods Love to us is a Love of <HI>beneficence,</HI> but our love to him is a love of <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>obedience,</HI> a love to please and honour him. 1 Joh. 5.3. <HI>This is the love of God that we keep his Com∣mandments. And his Commandments are not grievous.</HI> Now if you ask what Obedience is required, this may be best answered by a reference to some comprehensive <HI>Places of Scripture,</HI> where you may find it in <HI>God's Name,</HI> expresly enjoyned. As, 1 Pet. 1.15. <HI>But at he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of Conversation.</HI> Here God
<PB N="191" REF="001939_0200_0FBA21129E6AA2E8"/>
himself is propos'd as a Pattern; which shews that the highest measures of holiness, should be the aims of Christians: they should make it their design to resemble the God they Worship. This is an honour put upon God, when his People are witnesses to his holiness; when they testify to the holiness of God, in his Nature and Laws, by the holiness of their walk. God being perfect∣ly holy both in respect of the purity of his Essence, and the rectitude of his Admini∣strations, shews that Christians should be <HI>holy</HI> in the <HI>state and temper of their Souls,</HI> and in the <HI>course of their actions</HI>; and it is added, in <HI>all manner of Conversation.</HI> The whole of his Conversation ought to savour of holi∣ness: not only his <HI>Religious</HI> but his <HI>Civil Actions</HI> ought to be done <HI>in the Lord,</HI> and for his Glory. In every condition of Life, ho∣liness should appear. When <HI>surrounded with Blessings</HI> his heart should be filled with thank∣ful Praises to God; and he should be ready to <HI>serve him with joyfulness and gladness of heart in the abundance of all things that he enjoys.</HI> Un∣der <HI>Afflictions</HI> he should be holy, be bringing forth fruits of repentance, meekness, pati∣ence, and a due resignation to the divine Will And in every <HI>Relation,</HI> as <HI>Husbands</HI> and <HI>Wives, Parents, Masters, Children</HI> and <HI>Ser∣vants,</HI> the holiness of Christians should shine
<PB N="192" REF="001939_0201_0FBA2114223D0F78"/>
forth in a conscientious observation of all such rules as concern their <HI>Relative Duties</HI>; towards their Families or Neighbours. Such render their holiness questionable that don't shew it in their <HI>Relations.</HI> This is the princi∣pal sphere of their activity: therefore here they have most frequent occasions to express it. And a course of holiness in all Relative duties will have an extensive influence upon others, who shall be the better for it, and will hopefully be ready to imitate it, or at least be awed by it. Indeed if Piety ben't carefully maintained in <HI>Families</HI> it will lan∣guish every where else.</P>
<P>AGAIN, You have another Precept in, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.74, 75. where our duty is made the end of our deliverance. Christ came not to exempt us from the service of God, but that we might serve him the more cheerfully, without <HI>servile fear,</HI> and with cheerfulness and joy of heart. And the branches of duty here urged are <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> the former may respect the duties nextly due to God, and enjoyned in the <HI>First Table</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> a holy fear of, faith in, and love to God as our highest good, our portion and blessedness; a conscientious regard of his <HI>Worship</HI> in all the branches of it, and the <HI>manner</HI> of attending it: A reverence of his <HI>Name,</HI> both in our thoughts and expressions.
<PB N="193" REF="001939_0202_0FBA211585AEB258"/>
A due regard to his <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> accounting them <HI>holy of the Lord, and honourable</HI>: de∣voting our selves to holy Exercises upon them, and watching against all undue frames of heart, or unholy carriages, while we are engaged in them. Because we have to do with a God, who is <HI>Glorious in Holiness,</HI> and <HI>will be Sanctified by all the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that draw near unto Him.</HI> And not only are all our ways before him, but the most secret motions and workings of our hearts. <HI>Righteousness</HI> may respect the duties of the <HI>Second Table,</HI> what∣ever we <HI>owe unto Men,</HI> according to the Re∣lation we stand in to them, or they to us. We owe <HI>respect and honour</HI> to <HI>Superiours,</HI> and it is matter of justice to yield it to them. We owe <HI>respect and love</HI> to all Men, and must be careful not to <HI>injure</HI> them in their <HI>Bodies,</HI> by any <HI>wrong or violence</HI> offered to them. Yea, mayn't dare to cherish <HI>rash</HI> or <HI>causeless Anger</HI> against them. Or in their <HI>Chastity,</HI> by tempting or encouraging them to any thing that is obscene or filthy: to any intemperance, or immodesty, but rather doing what in us lies to prevent it, by giving holy patterns to them, and avoiding all obscenity in words and gestures. All injury to their <HI>Estates</HI> must also be avoided; accor∣ding to that Precept, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.6. There must be no <HI>unfairness</HI> in their dealings one
<PB N="194" REF="001939_0203_0FBA21192C36E0D0"/>
with another; no <HI>unfaithfulness</HI> in their <HI>Pro∣mises</HI>; all <HI>oppressive, covetous, deceitful</HI> me∣thods in their transactions upon any <HI>Worldly account</HI> with each other, are to be resisted with greatest care; and that which is <HI>alto∣gether just must be followed.</HI> Again, no injury must be done to the <HI>Names of others,</HI> by a light and hasty receiving or unwarantably spreading of <HI>reports to their defamation</HI>; and all care should be used that you never un∣justly reproach them, by inventing or car∣rying <HI>false reports</HI> concerning them: but be <HI>charitable</HI> towards all Men, and ready to vin∣dicate them where-ever there is need of it, and ground for it: and all <HI>discontent</HI> and re∣pining against God, or envy at them, be∣cause others are in some respects better then they in any valuable enjoyments, should carefully be avoided. <HI>Christ</HI> came <HI>not to make void the Law</HI>; but rather to <HI>explain</HI> and <HI>enforce it</HI>: that he might render <HI>holiness</HI> more conspicuous; and raise his People to greater eminency in it, then ever before. And it should be the aim and design of all Christians, both for Christ's sake, their own and others, that their Graces may be re∣splendent in the <HI>holiness,</HI> and universal <HI>righ∣teousness of their Conversations</HI>: that as the <HI>Apostle</HI> directs, they may <HI>adorn the Gospel,</HI> Tit. 2.10.
