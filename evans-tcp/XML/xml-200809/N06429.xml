The Governor opened the Conferences with the following Ceremonies, addressing himself to all the Indians present, of every Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>IT gives me great Pleasure to see so many of you, and of so many different Nations, at this Council Fire. I bid you heartily Welcome.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String, I wipe the Sweat and Dust out of your Eyes, that you may see your Brethren's Faces, and look chearful. With this String, I take all Bitterness out of your Breast, as well as every Thing disagreeable that may have gathered there, in Order that you may speak perfectly free and open to us. With this String, I gather the Blood, and take it away from the Council Seats, that your Cloaths may not be stained, nor your Minds any ways disturbed.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> interpreted the Substance of this Speech, and saying, his Memory did not serve him to remember the several Ceremonies in Use on this Occasion, he desired <HI>Nichas,</HI> a <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief, to do it for him; which he did; and all was afterwards interpreted by Captain <HI>Henry Montour,</HI> in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, to <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>After a short Pause, <HI>Tagashata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, rose up, and repeating, as usual, each Paragraph distinctly, as spoke by the Governor, he returned Thanks, and went through the same Ceremonies to the Governor, Council and People of the Province; adding on the last String, <Q>That their Great-Grand-Fathers had told them, that they had made a Road for them to travel to their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and that whenever it should be stopped, they would become a poor People. They were very glad to find the Road open to their Brethren, and should take Care to preserve it so on their Side.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P>After Mr▪ <HI>Weiser</HI> had delivered this in <HI>English,</HI> and it was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, by <HI>Moses Tetamy; Tagashata</HI> proceeded:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brother</HI> ONAS,</P>
<P>By this Belt you sent an Invitation to us to come to <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> which reached our Towns about the Time that the Leaves put out last Spring; but we were then so much alarmed by the <HI>French,</HI> who were near us, that we could not then leave our Country. Some little Time ago we received another Belt from Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> which he informed us was sent to him by you, to be forwarded to us, to enquire into the Reasons why we did not come to you, according to your first Invitation; and Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> desired us to come here, to meet you in Council; upon which we immediately arose, and came as soon as we could, to your Council Fire, and now we are here, as you see.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Two Belts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<Q><P>Here is another Belt by which we were invited lately to come to a Council Fire that was kindled in an Island near the Sea. This surprized us, as we never heard of a Council Fire in an Island. We know of no Council Fires, but the Old Council Fire at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and the Great Council Fire in <HI>Albany.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Here he laid the Belt on the Table.</HI></P>
<P>Then taking four other Strings of Wampum, he said, <Q>These were sent by <HI>Nichas,</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief, with a Message that he was arrived in this Province, and desired we would comply with the Invitation and come down.</Q> Here he laid the four Strings on the Table. <HI>Nichas</HI> having acknowledged the Message, and taken up the Strings, <HI>Tagashata</HI> concluded, saying, <Q>These are your Belts, by which we were invited to come to this Council Fire; and as we are now come, we return them, and desire to see the Belts that were sent by us, particularly one, on which were several Images of Men holding each other by the Hand.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008157_0006_102E3E9F102481E0"/>
The Governor replied, that he would enquire for the Belts sent by them, and they should be returned.</P>
<P>The Substance of these last Speeches of <HI>Tagashata</HI> was interpreted to <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>

<P>This Morning his Excellency Governor BERNARD arrived at <HI>Easton,</HI> and desired a Meeting of the Indians, that he might make them the usual Complements; but was made acquainted by Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> that they were then in Council, deliberating on Matters necessary to be adjusted before the Meeting.</P>

<P>This Morning the Indian Chiefs communicated to the Governors, by Mr. <HI>Wieser,</HI> the Business they had been consulting upon, and said they had concluded to speak to them this Forenoon.</P>
<P>The Governors waited till one o'Clock, expecting the Indians to meet them, being told that they were gathering together for that Purpose; but they not coming, after several Messages sent to hasten them, it was agreed to meet them punctually at four o'Clock.</P>

<P><HI>Tagashata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, intending to speak first, on Behalf of the Indians, had laid some Belts and Strings in Order on the Table.</P>
<P>As soon as the Company sat down, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> holding out a String, said, he had something to deliver, and desired he might be heard first of all. Mr. <HI>Groghan</HI> requested to know, if what he was going to say was the Result of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Council, and if it was their Desire it should be spoke first; but no Answer was given him as to this.</P>
<P>Governor BERNARD signifying his Desire to bid the Indians welcome, and just mention to them the Business he came upon, it was agreed he should speak first; which he did as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I AM glad to see so many of you met together, to cultivate Peace with your Brethren and old Friends the <HI>English.</HI> I heartily bid you welcome, and wish that the good Work for which you are now assembled, may prosper in your Hands, and have that Success, which your wise Men, and all that wish you well, must desire as a Thing much to your Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008157_0007_102E3EA28F7DCE18"/>
The Situation of the Province over which I preside, and the Disposition of it's People, have hitherto afforded very little Occasion for Treaties with the neighbouring Indians; but having some Months ago sent a Message to the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> I received a Message from our Brethren the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> wherein they take upon them to answer my Message to the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and desire that I would meet them at the Council Fire burning at this Place.</P>
<P>It is not usual for the King's Governors to go out of their Provinces to attend Treaties; but I am glad to have an Opportunity of shewing my good Disposition to establish Peace and Friendship with my Neighbours, and therefore I have waved a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Forms, and am come here according to the Invitation I received at <HI>Burlington.</HI></P>
<P>To you therefore, our Brethren the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> and your Nephews the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> I now speak, and desire that you would take into your most serious Considera∣tion, my Message to the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> your Message to me, and my Answer thereto, and let me know what we are to expect from you.</P>
<P>What is past we are willing to forget; but I must remind you, that if you are dis∣posed to be our Friends for the future, you shou'd give us that Proof of your Sincerity which I have desired in my Answer to your Message, and return us the Captives that have been taken out of our Province, and are now within your Power: This should be one of the first Steps, and will be the best that can be taken towards restoring and con∣firming that Brotherly Love and Friendship between us; which, I am convinced, will be for the mutual Benefit of all Parties.</P></Q>
<P>This was interpreted in the Six Nations Language, by Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> and in the <HI>Dela∣ware,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Stephen Calvin,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Schoolmaster in <HI>West Jersey.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> spoke,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I desire all of you who are present will give Ear to me. As you, my Brethren, desired me to call all the Nations who live back; I have done so. Now if you have any Thing to say to them, or they to you, you must sit and talk together.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I sit by, only to hear and see what you say to one another; for I have said what I have to say to the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> who sits here; he knows what has passed between us. I have made known to him the Reason why I struck him. Now, I and the Governor have made up these Differences between him and me; and I think we have done it as far as we can, for our future Peace.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The above Speech was interpreted in the Six Nation Language.</P>
<P><HI>Tagashata</HI> then rose up, and spoke,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the Governors, and your Councils,</HI></P>
<Q><P>IT has pleased the Most High, that we meet together here with chearful Countenances, and a good Deal of Satisfaction: And as publick Business requires great Considera∣tion, and the Day is almost spent, I choose to speak early To-morrow Morning.</P></Q>
<P>The Governors answer'd, That they should be glad to give all the Dispatch possible to this good Work they were engaged in, and desired the Chiefs would fix the Time of Meeting; but they declined it, saying, <Q>They were unacquainted with Hours, but would give Notice when they were ready.</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>At a Conference held at <HI>EASTON,</HI> on the 12th of <HI>October,</HI> 1758.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, The Governors; the Gentlemen of their Councils, and others, as before.</P>
<P><HI>Tagashata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, taking the Strings and Belt of Wampum, which Governor BERNARD gave Yesterday, repeated according to the Indian Custom, the Par∣ticulars of his Speech, and then added,</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008157_0008_102E3EA5646E9578"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>We approve of every Article mentioned to us Yesterday, by the Governor of <HI>Jersey</HI>; all that he said is very good: We look upon his Message to us, as a Com∣mission and Request from him, that we should bring Matters to a good Conclusion with our Cousins the <HI>Minisinks.</HI> They themselves sent for us to do the same Thing, on their Behalf; and at their Request we came here, have taken it in Hand, and will use our utmost Endeavours to bring about the good Work which Governor BERNARD desires, and do not doubt but it will be done to his entire Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I now speak at the Request of <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and our Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> living at <HI>Wyomink</HI> and on the Waters of the River <HI>Sasquehannah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We now remove the Hatchet out of your Heads, that was struck into it by our Cousins the <HI>Delawares:</HI> It was a <HI>French</HI> Hatchet that they unfortunately made use of, by the Instigation of the <HI>French</HI>: We take it out of your Heads, and bury it under Ground, where it shall always rest and never be taken up again. Our Cousins the <HI>Delawares,</HI> have assured us they will never think of War against their Brethren the <HI>English</HI> any more, but employ their Thoughts about Peace, and cultivating Friend∣ship with them, and never suffer Enmity against them to enter into their Minds again.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Delawares</HI> desired us to say this for them by this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>Our Nephews the <HI>Minisink</HI> Indians, and three other different Tribes of that Nation, have, at last, listened to us, and taken our Advice, and laid down the Hatchet they had taken up against their Brethren the <HI>English.</HI> They told us they had received it from the <HI>French,</HI> but had already laid it down, and would return it to them again.</P>
<P>They assured us, they would never use it any more against you, but would follow our Advice; and entreated us to use our utmost Endeavours to reconcile them to you their Brethren, declaring they were very sorry for what they had done, and desired it might be forgotten, and they would forever cultivate a good Friendship with you. These Declarations were made by the principal Warriors of four Tribes of the <HI>Minisink</HI> Indians, at giving us this Belt.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Then taking eight Strings of black Wampum, he proceeded;</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>We let you know, that we have not only brought about this Union with our Nephews on the Waters of the River <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> but also have sent Messages to our Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and to those likewise of our own Nations who are on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> under the Influence of the <HI>French.</HI> We have told all those, that they must lay down the <HI>French</HI> Hatchet, and be reconciled to their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and never more employ it against them. And we hope they will take our Advice. We the <HI>Mohawks, Senecas,</HI> and <HI>Onondagas,</HI> deliver this String of Wampum to remove the Hatchet out of your Heads, that has been struck into them by the <HI>Ohio</HI> Indians; in order to lay a Foundation for Peace.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Eight Strings of black Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tagashata</HI> sat down, and then the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, <HI>Toka aio,</HI> arose, and said,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I Speak in Behalf of the younger Nations, Part of, and confederated with the Six Nations, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Cayugas, Oneidas, Tuscaroras, Tutaloes, Nanticokes</HI> and <HI>Conoys.</HI></P>
<P>A Road has been made from our Country to this Council Fire, that we might treat about Friendship; and as we came down the Road, we saw, that by some Misfortune or other, Blood has lately been spilt on it. By these Strings we make the Road wider and clearer; we take the Blood away out of it, and likewise out of the Council Chamber, which may have been stained; we wash it all away, and desire it may not be seen any more; and we take the Hatchet out of your Heads.</P>
<P><HI>Gave three Strings.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008157_0009_102E3EA922935950"/>
<HI>Brethren, the Governors, and all the</HI> English,</P>
<P>I now confine myself to the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> my own Nation.</P>
<P>I will hide Nothing from you, because we have promised to speak to each other from the Bottom of our Hearts.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> like a Thief in the Night, have stolen away some of our young Men, and misled them; and they've been concerned in doing Mischief against our Brethren the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>We did not know it when it happened, but we discover'd it since. The Chiefs of our Nation held their young Men fast, and would not suffer them to go out of their Sight; but the <HI>French</HI> came and stole them away from us, and corrupted them to do Mis∣chief: We are sorry for it; we ask Pardon for them, and hope you will forgive them: We promise they shall do so no more: And now, by this Belt, we take out of your Heads the Hatchet with which they struck you.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt of Ten Rows.</HI></P>
<P>He added, he had found out, <Q>That some of their young Men had been con∣cerned in striking the <HI>English</HI> four Times.</Q></P>

<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I invited you to come down to the Council Fire kindled at this Place by me and your Nephew <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> with a Design to lay before you Matters of the greatest Conse∣quence to you and us: I am now about to communicate them to you, and to answer all that has been said by you to me, since our meeting together: I therefore by this String open your Ears that you may hear clearly, and carefully attend to what I shall say to you.</P></Q>

<Q><P>I must first put you in Mind, that perfect Peace and Friendship subsisted between you and your Brethren the <HI>English</HI> in this Province, from our first Settlement among you, and that whatever little Disputes happened between your People and Ours, they were amicably settled and adjusted by our wise Men at our Council Fires, according to an Agreement made by our first Proptietor, WILLIAM PENN, and your Fathers. Had this wise Agreement been carefully observed, as it always ought to have been, our late unhappy Differences had never arose. But what is past cannot be recalled, and shall be forgotten. Let us both resolve never to be guilty of the like Error for the Future.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>You gave us Yesterday these two Belts, in Behalf of your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and join'd with them in taking out of our Heads the Hatchets with which we had been struck, acquainting us, that these Hatchets were given to your Nephews by the <HI>French,</HI> and that they would not use them any more against us, but were heartily disposed to cultivate a firm Friendship with us for the Future.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008157_0010_102E3EABA922D688"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We accept your Belts: We thank you for the Pains you have taken in enquiring of your Nephews into the true Cause why they struck us.</P>
<P>Now, that the Hatchets are taken out of our Heads, and we are reconciled; we desire, that your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> will conceal nothing from you and us, that ever did, or now does, he heavy on their Minds, that the Intent of this Meeting may be answered; which was with your Assistance, to put Matters that have at any Time disturbed their Minds, on such a just and reasonable Footing, that the Peace between us may never be interrupted, but continue firm to the remotest Ages.</P>
<P><HI>Two Belts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By these Eight Strings of black Wampum, you, the <HI>Mohawks, Sonecas</HI> and <HI>Onon∣dagas,</HI> told us, that you had not only brought about an Union with the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> on the Waters of the River <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> but had also sent Messages to the <HI>Indians</HI> now on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> as well those of those two Nations, as those of the Six Nations under the <HI>French</HI> Influence, desiring them to lay down the Hatchet, and enter again into Friendship with their Brethren the <HI>English</HI>; and on their Behalf, you have taken the Hatchets out of our Heads, so far as to lay a Foundation for a future Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Mohawks, Senecas <HI>and</HI> Onondagas,</P>
<P>This was a very friendly Part, and we flatter ourselves they will hearken to you, as there are now Deputies here from those Indians on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> with Messages to us, which will be delivered in Publick.</P>
<P>We accept your Strings, and approve your taking the Hatchet, on the Behalf of the <HI>Ohio</HI> Indians, out of our Heads, so far as to make it the Foundation of a future Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Nine Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Cayugas, Oneidos, Tuscaroras, Tuteloes, Nanticokes <HI>or</HI> Conoys, <HI>the younger Nations who are Parts of, and united with the Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>By these Strings you say, that as you came down the Road, which has been opened from your Country to this Council Fire, you saw Blood lately spilt upon it, and have washed it away, not only out of the Road, but out of the Council Chamber, lest that should have been stained.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We join, by these Strings, with you, in removing the Blood, we bury it deep in the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P>Brothers, the <HI>Cayugas,</HI></P>
<P>With this Belt you justly lament the Folly of your young Men, who have suffer'd themselves to be stolen away from you by the <HI>French,</HI> and then at their Instigation, to strike us. You take the Hatchets out of our Heads; you ask Pardon for them, and desire we will forgive the Mischief they have done us, and both you and they promise never to hurt us more."</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We accept the Belt in their Behalf, and give you this Belt, in Token of our Friend∣ship and Reconciliation.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember that the Day before Yesterday, your Nephew <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> told me by this String, <Q>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he had already said to me at our former Meetings every Thing he had to say, and had made me acquainted with the Cause why he had struck us, and that I knew what had passed between us. That we had made up all Dif∣ferences, and had done it as far as we could, for our future Peace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That at my Request he had given the Halloo, and brought down to this Place, you who heard him and are now present; and that he would sit by, and hear what we said together,</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008157_0011_102E3EAF4E3AB340"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As there are a great many of you here who were not present at our former Meetings, I think it proper for your Information, to give you a short Account of what has passed between your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> and us.</P>
<P>About three Years ago, your Brethren the <HI>English</HI> living on the Borders of this Province were struck on a Sudden, at a Time when they were in profound Peace with you and following their Business suspecting no Danger: Many were killed, and others carried away Captive.</P>
<P>We were surprized and did not know who struck us, but sent Messengers up the <HI>Susquebannab,</HI> as far as the Country of the United Nations, to enquire whence the Blow came and for what Reason.</P>
<P>On the Return of these Messengers, we were informed that the Hatchet had been struck into our Heads by our Countrymen the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawanese.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time after this Discovery was made, a Cessation of Hostilities was brought about by the United Nations, at our Request made to them for that Purpose by Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI>; and upon our Invitation, our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> came down with a Number of <HI>Delawares</HI> and other Indians to a Council Fire kindled at this Place, where we have since had several Meetings.</P>
<P>At one of these Meetings <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> told us that the Cause of the War was, that their foolish young Men had been persuaded by the false-hearted <HI>French</HI> King, to strike their Brethren the <HI>English</HI>; and one Reason why the Blow came harder was that the Pro∣prietors of this Province had taken from them by Fraud, the Ground we now stand on, and all the Lands lying between <HI>Tobiccon Creek</HI> and <HI>Wyomink,</HI> on the River <HI>Susquebannab.</HI></P>
<P>At last all Blood was wiped away and buried under Ground; and Peace Belts were exchanged between us and our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> who then told us, he acted in Behalf of ten Nations, and promised to bring in and restore to us all our fellow Subjects that had been carried off Prisoners by them. For the Truth of this short Relation I refer you to our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> who will confirm it to you more particularly.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>To continue our Friendship it is absolutely necessary to preserve Faith and keep the Promises we make with each other. I will speak plainly to you and from the Bottom of my Heart, as one Friend ought to another, that Nothing may lie heavy on my Mind to disturb me hereafter; and I expect the same Openness and Freedom on your Parts.</P>
<P>I desire therefore to know the true Reason, why our Flesh and Blood who are in Captivity and in your Power have not been delivered to us, according to the Promise made us by our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> in Behalf of all the Indians he represented; and what is become of those Belts we gave him to confirm the Peace, and that Promise. For till that Promise is complied with, we can never sleep in Quiet or rest satisfy'd in the Friendship of those who detain our Children and Re∣lations from us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P></Q>
<P>After the Governor had done speaking, the United Nations, being eight in all, gave the usual Cry of Approbation with great Solemnity, each Chief according to his Rank, crying <HI>Yoban</HI>; which was answered by all the Indians present, in a solemn, musical and unisonal Tone.</P>
<P>Then Goveror BERNARD delivered the Belts requested by the <HI>Senecas, Cayugas</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and spoke as follows;</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> has given a particular Answer to what has been said to us both. So far as his Answer relates to the Province over which I preside, I confirm what has been said by this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="12" REF="008157_0012_102E3EB0D55BF4E0"/>
Previous to what follows, it is necessary to observe, that <HI>Pisquetomen</HI> and another <HI>Ohio</HI> Indian having come to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> last Summer, acquainted the Governor, that the Indians in those Parts had not received any Account of the late Transactions with this Government nor any Message from it; nor had any Thing been done that they might be persuaded to lay down the Hatchet. The Governor therefore took that Opportunity to send a friendly Message to those Indians by <HI>Pisquetomen,</HI> and appointed Mr. <HI>Frederick Post,</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> who understood the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, to attend him and acquaint the Indians at <HI>Ohio,</HI> of the Peace made by the <HI>Susquebannab, Delawares</HI> and other Indians, and the Disposition of this Government to forgive what was past, if they wou'd return to their antient Alliance. This Message was accordingly delivered, and an Answer returned by <HI>Frederick Post, Pisquetomen,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hick∣man,</HI> an <HI>Ohio</HI> Indian, who having come down together as far as <HI>Harriss</HI>'s Ferty, <HI>Frederick Post</HI> went to wait on General <HI>Forbes,</HI> and left the two Indians to proceed with the Message; who being now arrived at <HI>Easton, Pisquetomen,</HI> who had the particular Charge of it, introduced it as follows.</P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>WHEN I was at <HI>Allegbeny,</HI> the Chief Men sat together as we do here now. I was employed by the Governor, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and <HI>Israel Pemberton,</HI> these three Men, pointing to them: And the Chief Men told me, that when I shou'd come among the <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants, I must shake Hands for them with the Governor, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and <HI>Israel Pemberton</HI>; [Here he shook Hands with them] and that what they had to say, was written down in a Paper, which he then produced, and said they desired it might be read in Publick. Now, you Gentlemen, who are Head Men, sent <HI>Frederick Post</HI> with me, desiring me to take and carry him in my Bosom there, and when I came there, to introduce him to the publick Council. I did this, and have brought him back sate to you again.</P></Q>
<P>Then taking a Belt and three Strings of Wampum, which were deliver'd with the Paper, he said, he wou'd interpret them; but as all that was said was truly set down in the Writing, it was not necessary. Let it be read. Then <HI>Pisquetomen</HI> delivered the Paper, with the Belt and three Strings of Wampum; and, on being asked afterwards to whom they were sent, answered, one was sent to the Governor, another to <HI>Teedyus∣cung,</HI> and another to <HI>Israel Pemberton.</HI></P>
<P>The Message was read in these Words.</P>
<Q><P>The Indians speak now.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> Hear what I have to say.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> It is a good many Days since we have seen and heard of you from all Sorts of Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> This is the first Message which we have seen and heard of you; we have not yet rightly heard of you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> You have talked of that Peace and Friendship which we had formerly with you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> We tell you to be strong, and always remember that Friendship which we had formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> We desire you wou'd be strong, and let us once more hear of that good Friendship and Peace we had formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> We desire you to make haste, and let us soon hear of you again.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> Hear what I have to say; look <HI>Brethren,</HI> since we have seen and heard of you, of all Sorts of Nations, we see that you are forty that we have not that Friendship we formerly had.</P>
<P>Look <HI>Brethren,</HI> We at <HI>Allegbeny</HI> are likewise sorry that we have not that Friendship with you we formerly had.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="008157_0013_102E3EB25DBCE658"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI> We long for that Peace and Friendship we had formerly▪</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> It is good that you have held that Friendship, which we had formerly amongst our Fathers and Grand-fathers,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We must tell you, we will not let that Friendship quite drop which was formerly between us. Now <HI>Brethren,</HI> it is Three Years since we dropt that Peace and Friendship which we formerly had with you. Now <HI>Brethren,</HI> that Friendship is dropt and lies buried in the Ground where you and I stand, in the Middle between us both. Now <HI>Brethren</HI> since I see you have digged up and revived that Friendship which was buried in the Ground, now you have it, hold it fast. Do be strong, <HI>Brethren,</HI> and exert yourselves, that that Friendship may be well estabilshed between us.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> If you will be strong, it is in your Power to finish that Peace and Freindship well. Now <HI>Brethren,</HI> we desire you to be strong, and establish and make known to all the <HI>English</HI> this Peace and Freindship, that it over all may be well esta∣blished, as you are of one Colour and one Nation in all the <HI>English</HI> Governments.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> When you have made this Peace, which you have begun, known every where amongst your Brethren, and have finished and agreed every where together on this Peace and Friendship, then you will be pleased to send it to me at <HI>Allegheny.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> When you have settled the Peace and Friendship and sent it to me, I will send it to all the Nations of my Colour, when I receive of you the Answer, and have looked that every thing is well done, so that I can send it, and to all the Nations of my Colour; They will all join to it, and we all will hold it fast.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI> When all the Nations join in this Friendship, then the Day will begin to shine clear over us. When we once more hear of you and we join together, then the Day will be still and no Wind or Storm will come over us to disturb us.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Brethren,</HI> you know our Hearts, and what we have told you in this, all the Nations agree to join and what we have to say: Be strong; if you do so, every Thing will be well, and what we have told you in this, all the Nations agree to join.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Brethren,</HI> let the King of <HI>England</HI> know what our Minds is, as soon as possibly you can.</P>

<P>After this was interpreted in the Six Nation and <HI>Delaware</HI> Languagues, the three Strings were delivered to the Governor, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and <HI>Israel Pemberton.</HI></P>
<P>As the Governor was going to close the Conference, <HI>Nichas</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief spoke for some time with great Vehemence, pointing frequently to <HI>Teedyuscung</HI>; and Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> was asked to interpret it; but he desired to be excused, as it was purely relating to the Indians themselves, and desired Mr. <HI>Montour</HI> might interpret it: After some Pause, he said, perhaps it might be better if it was interpreted to the Governors, Councils and Commissioners, in a private Conference; And Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> was desired to mention this to the Indians, and know of them, what they wou'd chuse shou'd be done, whether it shou'd be interpreted now or at a private Conference; and they answer'd now. But soon after, they said, that, at the Request of Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> they consented that it shou'd be interpreted in the Morning at a private Conference.</P>

<P><HI>Nichas,</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief, stood up, and directing his Discourses to both Governors, said;</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>WE thought proper to meet you here to have some private Discourse about our Nephew <HI>Teedyuscung.</HI></P>
<P>You all know, that he gives out, he is the Great Man and Chief of Ten Nations: This is his constant Discourse. Now I, on Behalf of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> say, we do not know he is such a great Man. If he is such a great Man, we desire to know who has made him so. Perhaps you have; and if this be the Case, tell us so. It may be the <HI>French</HI> have made him so. We want to enquire and know whence his Greatness arose,</P></Q>
<P><HI>Tagashata,</HI> on the Behalf of the <HI>Senecas,</HI> spoke next.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I, for my Nation, say the same that <HI>Nichas</HI> has said; I need not repeat it. I say we do not know who has made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> this Great Man over ten Nations; and I want to know who made him so.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Assarandungas</HI> spoke next on Behalf of the <HI>Onondagas.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am here to represent the <HI>Onondagas,</HI> and I say for them, that I never heard before now, that <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> was such a Great Man, much less can I tell who made him so. No such Thing was ever said in our Towns, as that <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> was such a Great Man.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Thomas King</HI> spoke,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren, The Governors and all présent.</HI></P>
<P>Take notice that I speak in Behalf of five Nations, who have their Deputies here present, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Oneidos, Cayugas, Tuscaroras, Nanticokes</HI> and <HI>Conoys,</HI> who have joined together and now make one Nation, and <HI>Tuteloes.</HI> We five are all connected together, and if any Thing is said to one of us, it is communicated to all the rest.</P>
<P>On their Behalf I now tell you, we none of us know who has made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> such a great Man. Perhaps the <HI>French</HI> have, or perhaps you have, or some among you, as you have different Governments, and are different People. We for our Parts entirely disown that he has any Authority over us, and desire to know, from whence he derives his Authority</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Toka aio,</HI> the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, spoke,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I speak to you, on Behalf of the Nations just now mentioned. You may remem∣ber, that you said the other Day, you cou'd not be easy without your Prisoners were returned. We have considered this, and I now assure you, that they shall be returned.</P>
<P>We speak from the Bottom of our Hearts; we will look carefully into all our Towns for them: You shall have them all; we will keep none. If there be any of them that have gone down our Throats, we will throw them up again. You told us a tender Father, Husband, Wise, Brother or Sister, cou'd not sleep found, when they reflected that their Relations were Prisoners. We know it is so with us, and we will therefore use our Endeavours to make your Hearts easy, and we give you this Belt, as a Promise that we will perform our Words.</P></Q>

<HI>Nichas</HI> spoke next in Behalf of the <HI>Mohawks, Senecas</HI> and <HI>Onondagas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I speak now in Behalf of my own Nation, and my two other Brethren, Deputies of the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Onondagas.</HI> We remember you desired us to leave Nothing in our Hearts, but speak open on every Matter, and you said you wou'd do the same to us.</P>
<P>You told us that you cou'd not sleep found whilst your Prisoners were detained from you, nor cou'd you have any Confidence in the Friendship of those who did detain them.</P>
<P>We of these Three Nations promise, that we will use our best Endeavours to make you easy. When we return, we will enquire of every Town for the Prisoners. We will call our Councils, and lay what you have said before them, and make diligent Enquiry for them thro' all our Towns, and all that we can find you shall see.</P>
<P>If any of them are gone down our Throats, we will heave them up again.</P></Q>

<HEAD>At a Conference with the <HI>Indians,</HI> on the 16th of <HI>October,</HI> 1758.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, The Governors and Gentlemen of their Council, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<P>The Minutes of the preceding Conference were read, and approved.</P>
<P>Those of Yesterday's private Conference were read at the particular Desire of the Chiefs of the united Nations, and interpreted to <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and the <HI>Delawares,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Stephen Calvin.</HI></P>
<P>The Governors then spoke separately; Governor <HI>DENNY</HI> beginning as follows: <HI>Brethren,</HI> the <HI>Mohawks, Onondagas, Senecas, Oneidas, Cayugas, Tuscaroras, Naticokes</HI> and <HI>Tuteloes</HI>;</P>
<Q><P>IN a Conference held with you Yesterday, you told me, that we know your Nephew <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> gives out, that he is the great Man, and Chief of Ten Nations, and that this was his constant Discourse; by this Belt therefore you denied him to be so great a Man, and desired to know of me who made him so, or gave him any Autho∣rity over you.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I will answer you truly, and tell you in a few Words, all that I know of the Matter; I have already informed you, that after the <HI>Delawares</HI> had struck us, you, our good Friends, the United Nations, advised them to sit still and do us no more Mischief; and that soon after this, we invited the <HI>Delawares</HI> to meet us at a Council Fire kindled at this Place.</P>
<P>We received an Answer to our Message from <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> as a Chief among the <HI>Delawares:</HI> At the Time appointed he came and told us that he represented ten Nations, amongst which the United Nations were included; that he acted as a Chief Man for the <HI>Delawares,</HI> but only as a Messenger from the United Nations, who were his Uncles and Superiors, to whom he wou'd faithfully carry every Thing that shou'd be transac∣ted between us, that they might do as they saw Cause.</P>
<P>We believed what your Nephew told us; and therefore made him a Counsellor and Agent for us, and desired him to publish to all Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> what we did at our Council Fires, and to let them know we were sincerely disposed to be at Peace with them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I can only speak for myself, and do assure you, that I never made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> this Great Man, nor ever pretended to give him any Authority over you; and I must do him the Justice to declare to you, that at our former publick Treaties, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> never assumed any such Power, but on many Occasions, when he spoke of you, called you his Uncles and Superiors.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="008157_0016_102E3EBA149C4E60"/>
I never shall attempt to nominate or impose a Chief on any Indian Tribe or Nation, but, on all Occasions, will pay due Regard to those who are chosen by their Country∣men.</P>
<P>If any others have made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> so great a Man, as to set himself above you, I am sorry for it. It is more than I know; and they who have done it, must answer for themselves.</P>
<P>I shou'd be greatly concerned, that any Uneasiness shoud arise among you; and hope you will guard against it, and preserve that Harmony which ought to subsist between Friends and Relations.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt and String, you promised me, to make diligent Search in your Towns for our Flesh and Blood, who are Prisoners among you, and return them to us.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have always found you honest and punctual in the Performance of your Promises; your Words therefore give me great Comfort, and fill all our Hearts with Pleasure. We rely upon you, that no Time may be lost in fulfilling an Engagement on which our Peace and Quiet so greatly depend.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt and String.</HI></P>
<P>Then Governor <HI>BERNARD</HI> spoke,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren of all the confederated Nations,</HI></P>
<P>AS you proposed your Questions concerning <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> separately, I think it proper to give you a separate Answer thereto.</P>
<P>I know not who made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> so great a Man; nor do I know that he is any greater than a Chief of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Indians settled at <HI>Wyomink.</HI> The Title of King cou'd not be given him by an <HI>English</HI> Governor; for we know very well, that there is no such Person among Indians, as what we call a King. And if we call him so we mean no more than a <HI>Sachem,</HI> or Chief. I observe in his Treaties which he has held with the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> [which I have perused since our last Meeting] that he says he was a Woman, till you made him a Man, by putting a Tomhawk in his Hand; and thro' all of those Treaties, especially in the last, held at this Town, he calls you his Uncles, and professes that he is dependent on you; and I know not that any Thing has since happened to alter his Relation to you. I therefore consider him to be still your Nephew.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am obliged to you for your kind Promises to return the Captives which have been taken from us. I hope you will not only do so, but will also engage such of your Allies and Nephews, as have taken Captives from us, to do the same. That you may be mindful of this, I give you this Belt.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After the Governor had done speaking, and their Answers were interpreted in the United Nations and <HI>Delaware</HI> Languages, the Indian Chiefs were asked if they had any Thing more to say. On which <HI>Tagashata</HI> arose, and made a Speech to his Cousins the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Minisink</HI> Indians, directing his Discourse to <HI>Teedyuscung.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Nephews,</HI></P>
<P>YOU may remember all that passed at this Council Fire. The Governors who sit there have put you in Mind of what was agreed upon last Year: You both promised to return the Prisoners. We your Uncles, put you in Mind of this Promise, and desire you will perform it: You have promised it, and must perform it. We your Uncles, have promised to return all the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners among us, and therefore we expect that you our Cousins and Nephews will do the same. As soon as you come home, we desire that you will search carefully in your Towns for all the Prisoners among you that have been taken out of every Province, and cause them to be deliver'd up to your Brethren. You know that this is an Article of this Peace that was made between you and your Brethren: In Confirmation of which you received a large Peace Belt; of which Belt we desire you will give an Account, and let us know what is become of it, and how far you have proceeded in it.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="008157_0017_102E3EBF0B185500"/>
After this was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, it was observed, that there were no <HI>Minisink</HI> Indians present; the Governors therefore desired, that Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> and Mr. <HI>Read</HI> would procure a Meeting of the Chiefs of the United Nations, <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and cause the Speech of <HI>Tagashata</HI> to be interpreted to the <HI>Minisinks</HI> in the Presence of their Uncles.</P>
<P><HI>Robert White,</HI> the <HI>Nanticoke</HI> Chief, arose and said, he was going to speak in Behalf of Seven Nations, and directing his Discourse to the Governors, he delivered himself in the <HI>English</HI> Language as follows,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is now more than two Years since we heard of our Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> taking up the Hatchet against the <HI>English.</HI> At the first, Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> sent a Message to the Head Nations, and when they received it, they sent to us at <HI>Otsaningo</HI>; telling us, that as we lived close by our Cousins, they desired we wou'd invite them to meet at our Town, and accordingly we invited them, and they came to a great Meeting at our Town of <HI>Otsaningo.</HI> We then gave our Cousins a Belt of a Fathom long, and Twenty-five Rows in Breadth, and desired them to lay down the Hatchet that they had taken up against the <HI>English,</HI> and to be easy with them: And if they wou'd follow this Advice, we told them, that they wou'd live in Peace, untill their Heads were white with Age; otherwise, it might not be so with them.</P>
<P>Not hearing from our Cousins for some Time, what they did in Consequence of this Belt, we sent to them two other Belts, one of Sixteen and the other of Twelve Rows, desiring them once more to be easy with their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and not to strike them any more: But still we heard nothing from them: Indeed some Time afterwards we understood the <HI>Delawares</HI> shou'd say, that the Indians at <HI>Otsaningo</HI> had grey Eyes, and were like the <HI>English,</HI> and shou'd be served as <HI>Englishm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>; and we thought we shou'd have had the Hatchet struck into our Heads. We now want to know what is become of these Belts: May be they may be under Ground, or they have swallowed them down their Throats.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As our Cousins have been loath to give any Answer to these Belts, we now desire they may let us know, in publick Conference, what they have done with them.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>

<P>The Indians were in Council all Day; and acquainted the Governors, that they cou'd not be ready to meet before Morning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>At a Conference held at <HI>Easton</HI> the 18<HI>th October,</HI> 1758.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT. The Governors, Council, Gentlemen and Indians, with the Interpreters: <HI>As aforesaid.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Peters</HI> and Mr. <HI>Read</HI> acquainted the Governors, <Q>That at a Meeting of the Chiefs of the older and younger Nations, with the several Tribes of the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Minisink</HI> Indians, on Monday Night, the Speech of <HI>Tagashata,</HI> delivered that Morning in the publick Conference, respecting the giving up the Prisoners, was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language by <HI>Stephen Calvin</HI>; and another Belt, on the Part of the Governors, being joined to <HI>Tagashata's</HI> Belt, they were both deliver'd to the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Minisink</HI> Chiefs, to enforce the subject Matter. When this was done, <HI>Tagashata</HI> spoke to the <HI>Minisink</HI> Chief <HI>Egotchowen,</HI> saying, we were told by you, that you had delivered up the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, and we believed you; but our Brethren have told us, that they were not delivered up, and therefore we earnestly desire that they may be made easy on this Article. You know; Cousins, that their Hearts will always be in Grief, till they see again their Flesh and Blood: It is natural that they shou'd be so: It wou'd be so with us, if it was our Case. We desire you will be <PB N="18" REF="008157_0018_102E3EC2ABE73260"/>extreamly careful to perform this Matter fully and soon. Let there be perfect Peace over all the <HI>English</HI> Country. And let it now be published, that we may all live in Peace, and with Satisfaction, now and for ever. I told you, <HI>Egotchowen,</HI> when you was in my Town, to bring with you the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, and that our Brethren wou'd expect it. I wish you had done it. But however, do it now with all Speed, and it will be well.</Q></P>
<P>That <HI>Egotchowen</HI> answered, It is true, <Q>I was at my Uncles Fire, and I believe he desired me to bring the Prisoners down; but I suppose it was not interpreted to me; for I did not understand it clearly; but I now understand it.</Q></P>
<Q><P>That the <HI>Minisink</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI> Indians were desired to collect all their Warriors together, and give them their Belts, and receive from them their Answer, it being necessary they shou'd concur heartily in whatever shou'd be concluded.</P></Q>
<P>Then <HI>Nichas,</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief acquainted the Governors, <Q>That, as Counsellors, they had finished, having Nothing to propose at this present Meeting. The Warriors were to speak now, and <HI>Thomas King</HI> was appointed to deliver their Words;</Q> who there∣upon arose, and began <Q>with an Exhortation as well to all concerned in publick Affairs, Governors and their Councils, and Indian Chiefs and their Councils as to the Warriors of all Nations, White People and Indians, desiring all present to attend carefully to what was going to be related, as Matters of great Consequence, which wou'd serve to regulate the Conduct of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to each other. He added, that the Relation going to be made had taken a great deal of Trouble to put it into Order, and it was made on Infor∣mation given by the several Indians now present, who were acquainted with the Facts.</Q></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>WE the Warriors have waited some Time, in Hopes our Counsellors wou'd have taken this Matter in Hand; but as they have not done it, we have, at their Desire, undertaken it, and they have approved of every Thing. I say, the Counsellors of the five younger Nations, as well as the three older Nations, have approved of what the Warriors are going to relate; and take Notice that the Speech is not only the Speech of all the Warriors of the elder and younger Nations, but of our Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language; and <HI>Thomas King</HI> then proceeded, directing his Speech to the Governors, and all the <HI>English</HI> upon the Continent.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>YOU have been inquisitive to know the Cause of this War; You have often enquired among us, but perhaps you did not find out the true Cause of the Bitterness of our Hearts, and may charge us wrongfully, and think that you were struck without a Cause, by some of our own Warriors, and by our Cousins. But if you look a little about you, you will find, that you gave the first Offence. For in Time of profound Peace, some of the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> passing thro' <HI>South-Carolina</HI> to go to War with their Enemies, were taken up and put into Prison. The <HI>English</HI> knew they were going to War, and that they used to do it every Year: And yet, after they had persuaded them in a friendly Way into their Houses, they were taken up, and put into Prison; and one who was a head Man of that Nation lost his Life, and the others were severely used. This first raised Ill-will in the Minds of the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> and as the <HI>French</HI> came a little after this happened to settle on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> the <HI>Shawanese</HI> complained of it to them, and they made an artful Use of it, set them against the <HI>English,</HI> and gave them the Hatchet. Being resolved on Revenge, they accepted it, and likewise spoke to their Grand-Fathers the <HI>Delawares,</HI> saying, Grand-Fathers, are not your Hearts sore at our being used so ill, and at the Loss of one of our Chiefs? Will not you join us in revenging his Death? So by Degrees our young Men were brought over to act against you. On searching Matters to the Bottom, you will find, that you in this Manner, gave the first Offence. This we thought proper to let you know: It may be of Service for the future. You 
<PB N="19" REF="008157_0019_102E3EC43240E610"/>
may be induced by this, to take better Care in conducting your Council-Business, so as to guard against these Breaches of Friendship, or as soon as they happen, in corresponding immediately with one another, and with the Indian Nations, who are in any wise concerned on such Occasion.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Eight Strings of black Wampum.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This was the Case of the <HI>Shawanese</HI> that I have just now related. Another of the like Nature has since happened to the <HI>Senecas,</HI> who have suffer'd in the same Manner.</P>
<P>About Three Years ago, eight <HI>Seneca</HI> Warriors were returning from War thro' <HI>Virginia,</HI> having seven Prisoners and Scalps with them. At a Place called <HI>Green Briar,</HI> they met with a Party of Soldiers, not less than one Hundred and Fifty, who kindly invited them to come to a certain Store, and said they wou'd supply them with Provisions: And ac∣cordingly they travelled two Days with them, in a friendly Manner; and when they came to the House, they took their Arms from the <HI>Senecas</HI>: The head Man cried out, Here is Death, defend yourselves as well as you can;?? which they did, and Two of them were killed on the Spot; and one, a young Boy, was taken Prisoner. This gave great Offence, and the more so, as it was upon their Warriors Road, and we were in perfect Peace with our Brethren. It provoked us to such a Degree that we cou'd not get over it.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have justly demanded your Prisoners; it is right; and we have given you an Answer: And therefore, as we think this young Boy is alive, and somewhere among you, we desire you will enquire for him. If he be alive, return him; if you have swallow'd him down your Throats, which perhaps may be the Case, let us know it, and we will be content. His Name is <HI>Squissatego.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Six Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have one Word more to mention of the same Nature, and which was the very Cause why the Indians at <HI>Ohio</HI> left you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When we first heard of the <HI>French</HI> coming to <HI>Ohio,</HI> we immediately sent Word to the Governors of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania</HI>; we desired them to come, and likewise to supply us with such Things as were proper for War, intending to defend our Lands, and hinder the <HI>French</HI> from taking the Possession of them: But these Governors did not attend to our Message; perhaps they thought there was no Foundation for our In∣telligence. The <HI>French,</HI> however came, and become our Neighbours; and you neither coming yourselves, nor assisting us with warlike Stores, our People of Necessity were obliged to trade with them for what we wanted, as your Traders had left the Country. The Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> took Care to settle on our Lands for his own Benefit; but when we wanted his Assistance against the <HI>French,</HI> he disregarded us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>At this Treaty you justly demanded to see your Flesh and Blood. We have pressed this on our Cousins the <HI>Minisinks</HI>; and they by this String, desired us to assure you, the Governors, that they wou'd make strict Search in their Towns, and sincerely comply with your Request, and return all the Prisoners in their Power.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Two Strings of black and white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P>Then directing his Discourse to the Governor of <HI>Jersey,</HI> he proceeded,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brother, the Governor of</HI> Jersey.</P>
<P>Our Cousins the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> tell us, they were wronged out of a great deal of Land, and the <HI>English</HI> settling so fast, they were pushed back, and cou'd not tell what Lands belonged to them. They say, if we have been drunk, tell us so: We may have forgot what we sold; but we trust to you, the Governor of <HI>Jersey,</HI> to take our Cause in Hand, and see that we have Justice done us. We say, that we have here and there Tracts of Land, that have never been sold. You deal hardly with us; you claim all the wild Creatures, and will not let us come on your Land to hunt after them. You will not <PB N="20" REF="008157_0020_102E3EC5B892B638"/>so much as let us peel a single Tree: This is hard, and has given us great Offence. The Cattle you raise are your own, but those which are wild, are still ours, or shou'd be common to both; for when we sold the Land, we did not propose to deprive ourselves of hunting the wild Deer, or using a Stick of Wood when we shou'd have Occasion. We desire the Governor to take this Matter into his Care, and see that Justice be done in it.</P>
<P><HI>Two Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>All that has been said has been of one Nature, that is of Matters that are Subjects of Dispute; this that I am now going to speak upon, is of another Nature.</P></Q>
<P>Then directing himself to the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> he said:</P>
<Q><P>We must put you in Mind, that four Years ago, you bought at <HI>Albany,</HI> a large Tract of Land over <HI>Susquehannah,</HI> extending from the Mouth of <HI>John Penn</HI>'s Creek to the <HI>Ohio</HI>: The Proprietors Agents then paid One Thousand Pieces of Eight for that Part which was settled by your People, that have been since driven off and killed. We acknowledge to have received Payment for those Parts that were settled: But for the other Part that we have not received Payment for, that we reclaim. Our Warriors and Hunters, when they heard that we had sold such a large Tract, disapproved our Conduct in Council; so now we acquaint you, that we are determined not to confirm any more than such of the Lands as the Consideration was paid for, and were then settled, though the others were included in the Deed; they are our hunting Grounds, and we desire this Request may be granted, and Notice taken, that it was made in open Conference.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Three white Strings.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Thomas King</HI> sat down.</P>
<P>The Confederate Chiefs, being asked if they had any Thing to say, answer'd, <Q>That they had done; and having eased their Minds of all that lay heavy upon them, they wou'd return Home.</Q></P>
<P>The Governors promised attentively to consider what was said, and give them an Answer.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> then arose and spoke.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I SHOU'D have said something at the Time our Uncles laid before you their Grievances, or Causes of Complaint, in Behalf of my Countrymen, who lived near <HI>Goshen.</HI> About three Years ago, nine of their People were killed at <HI>Goshen,</HI> when they were in Peace. I will not take upon me to say, that the Land had never been sold; but there was no Dispute about this at that Time: I verily believe, that they killed those nine Indians for no other Reason, than because they were hunting on that Land. I speak to all the <HI>English,</HI> when I mention this, as what was very wrong.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Three white Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>One of the <HI>Waping</HI> Tribes, or <HI>Goshen</HI> Indians, tells me, that, as soon as those nine Men were killed, he went with Three Belts and Tears in his Eyes, to <HI>George Vreeland,</HI> in order to have the Matter made up: But he never received any Answer to this Day, though he told him, he wou'd send the Belts to the Governor; and as soon as he shou'd receive his Answer, he wou'd send for him, and let him know. But he had never yet received any Answer.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I give you this String, to enquire what became of the three Belts, and what Answer was made to them.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember we made Peace last Year, and a Peace Belt was made a Fathom long, and of Fifteen Rows; Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> was present, so were some of my Uncles, and the <HI>Minisinks</HI>; they all saw it. You have asked me, what is become of that Belt, and <PB N="21" REF="008157_0021_102E3EC840B51378"/>how far it went. I will tell you: I sent it up the <HI>Susquebannah</HI> to <HI>Diabogo</HI>; from thence it went to <HI>Assintzin</HI>; thence to <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> The chief Men there got together, to consider what was best to be done with it: They all concluded, that it shou'd be sent to our Uncle: He is a Man, and often told us, he ought to see Things first, and consider what is to be done. The <HI>Senecas</HI> had the Belt first; and then all the United Nations afterwards; they had it almost a Year. Now it is come back, and is in <HI>Lapachpeton</HI>'s Hand, who is one of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and lives at <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> How far the Peace Belt went, I don't know; but I suppose it went through all my Uncles: And I assure you, I will do as my Uncle does. He has promised you, he will deliver up all your Captives; and I assure you, I will do so, wheresoever I find them, in all my Towns. Four Tribes, <HI>now present,</HI> have agreed to this, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Delawares, Unamies, Mohiccons</HI> and <HI>Wapings,</HI> who are settled as far as <HI>Secaughkung,</HI> This Belt confirms my Words.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor of</HI> Pennsylvania,</P>
<P>I did let you know formerly what my Grievance was. I told you, that from <HI>Tobiccon</HI> as far as the <HI>Delawares</HI> owned, the Proprietors had wronged me. Then you and I agreed, that it should be laid before the King of <HI>England:</HI> For you said he was our Father, and he shou'd see what were our Differences; for, as you and I cou'd not decide it, he should do it. Let us not alter what you and I have agreed: And now, let me know, if King GEORGE has decided the Matter between you and me. I don't pretend to mention any of my Uncles Lands, I only mention what we, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> own as far as the Heads of <HI>Delaware.</HI> All the Lands lying on the Waters that fall into the <HI>Susquebannah</HI> belong to our Uncles.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> then took up another Belt, designing to speak to his Uncles the United Nations, but whilst he was delivering the above, their Chiefs had one after another left the Council, seeming much displeased: He therefore declined speaking it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>On the 19th <HI>October,</HI> 1758.</HEAD>
<P>The Governors being ready to give their Answers, desired the Indians to meet; but they continued holding private Councils among themselves all that Day, till late in the Afternoon: And, as the Governors were going to the Place of Conference, the Indians sent Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> out of Council, to desire they wou'd defer meeting till the next Morning, their own private Business not being finished.</P>

<P>His Excellency reciting the Request of the United Nations to him, to do Justice to their Nephews the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> concerning their Claim to Lands in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> said, he wou'd make diligent Enquiry, what Lands were remaining unsold by them: But as that wou'd be a Work of Time and Expence, he wished that some Means cou'd be found to give them Satisfaction at this Meeting. The People of <HI>New-Jersey</HI> said, they had bought all, or the greatest Part of the <HI>Minisink</HI> Lands; and the <HI>Minisinks</HI> said they had a great deal of Land unsold. He could not tell who was in the Right; but would suppose there were some Lands unsold: And upon that Supposition wou'd give them some Money, by way of Consideration for them, if they wou'd propose a reasonable Sum; and desired they wou'd advise about it, and give an Answer.</P>
<P>The United Nations said, it was a very kind Proposal, and recommended it to the Con∣fideration of the <HI>Minisinks.</HI></P>

<HEAD>At a Conference with the <HI>Indians,</HI> held at <HI>EASTON,</HI> on the 20th of <HI>October,</HI> 1758.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, The Governor, Councils, Gentlemen and Indians, with the Interpreters, <HI>as before.</HI></P>
<P>Governor DENNY, desired to know of <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> if he proposed to speak, as the abrupt Departure of the Chiefs of the United Nations, from the last publick Con∣ference, had prevented him from finishing what he had to say.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> arose, and addressing himself to the United Nations, said,</P>
<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<Q><P>ACCORDING to our old Custom, we used to speak to one another at Home: But as we are now met here on Business, I must speak to you in the Presence of the <HI>English</HI> Governors; and what I shall say, I desire both you, the <HI>English,</HI> and my Uncles who are here, will attend to.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>I take this Opportunity of speaking to you, in the Presence of our Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and two of their Governors: Please to take Notice of what I am going to say.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<Q><P>You may remember, that you have placed us at <HI>Wiomink</HI> and <HI>Shamokin,</HI> Places where Indians have lived before. Now I hear since, that you have sod that Land to our Brethren the <HI>English</HI>: Let the Matter now be cleared up, in the Presence of our Brethren the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>I sit there as a Bird on a Bough; I look about, and do not know when to go. Let me therefore come down upon the Ground; and make that my own, by a good Deed; and I shall then have a Home for ever. For if you my Uncles, or I die, our Brethren the <HI>English</HI> may say, that they have bought it from you; and so they may wrong my Posterity of it.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Governor DENNY then requested the Attention of the Indians; and spoke,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, Chiefs and Warriors of the United Nations, and your Nephews here assembled.</HI></P>
<Q><P>I Am much obliged to you for the Account you, gave me the Day before Ye∣sterday, of the true Cause of the Bitterness of your Hearts towards us, and the Reasons which induced some of your young Men first to strike us, and others to side with the <HI>French</HI> on the <HI>Ohio.</HI></P>
<P>The Advice you give us, to take better Care and guard against any Breach of Friendship between us for the future, is very kind and wholsome: We will join with you, and endeavour to prevent the like Evils for the Time to come.</P>
<P>I promise you, that I will, immediately, send to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> to en∣quire after the <HI>Seneca</HI> Boy <HI>Squissatego,</HI> who you say was left a Prisoner in his Coun∣try; and if he is alive, you may depend on his being returned to you.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>By these Strings, you put me in Mind, that the Proprietors, four Years ago bought of you at <HI>Albany,</HI> a large Tract of Land over <HI>Susquebannah,</HI> from the Mouth of a Creek called <HI>Kayarondinbagh,</HI> or <HI>John Penn</HI>'s Creek, to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and were paid by the Proprietor's Agents, One Thousand Pieces of Eight, as the Considera∣tion Money, for such Parts as were settled by our People; but that, as your War∣riors disapproved of your Conduct in Council, for making that Sale, you now re∣claimed such of the Lands contained in that Grant, as you have not received a Consideration for.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="008157_0023_102E3ECE40FECE78"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietors of this Province, have on all Occasions manifested their par∣ticular Regard for you: They prefer your Friendship and the publick Good to their own private Interest. Their former Conduct gives you no Room to doubt the Truth of this; what I am about to tell you is a further Confirmation of it: therefore give me your Attention, and listen to what I shall say. You may remem∣ber, that, at a Treaty you held with your good Friend Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> three Years ago, some of your wise Men told him, that there were some among them who were dissatisfied with the Sale of the above Lands, made by them at <HI>Albany,</HI> and were desirous that Part of it should be reserved for them; tho' the Proprie∣tors had purchased it fairly of them, and paid One Thousand Pieces of Eight; which was all they were to receive, till our People settled to the Westward of the <HI>Allegheny,</HI> or <HI>Apalachian</HI> Hills. Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> represented this Matter to the Proprietors, in your Behalf: Whereupon they chearfully agreed to release to you all that Part of the Purchase you have reclaimed, and by a Letter of Attorney, empowered <HI>Richard Peters</HI> and <HI>Conrad Weiser,</HI> to execute a Deed to you for those Lands, on your confirming to them the Residue of that Purchase. On this Sub∣ject therefore you will please to confer with them, and settle the Boundaries be∣tween you, that they may release the Lands to you accordingly, before you leave this Place, and set your Minds at Ease.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for the Pains you have taken with your Nephews, to prevail with them, to return us such of our Brethren as are Prisoners among them; and we depend on the speedy Performance of their Promise.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have something to say to you, which is of the utmost Importance to us all; it requires your particular Attention and Consideration. Providence has brought you and your Nephews together at this Meeting, Face to Face with us, that eve∣ry Thing may be settled, and nothing remain, not so much as a Doubt, to cre∣ate any Uneasiness in our Hearts hereafter. You know, Brethren, that there is an old Agreement between the Proprietors and you, that you will not sell any of the Lands lying within this Province to any one but them; and they never take Possession of Lands till they have bought them of the <HI>Indians.</HI> You know also, that the United Nations have sold Lands to the Proprietors, which your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> now claim as their Right. This is the Case with regard to some Part of the Lands lying between <HI>Tobiccon</HI> Creek and the Head of <HI>Delaware</HI> River, which <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> it your Hearing the Day before Yesterday, said the Proprietors had de∣frauded him of. The Proprietors are desirous to do strict Justice to all the Indi∣ans; but it cannot be supposed they can know in which of you the Right was vested. It is a Matter that must be settled among yourselves; till this is done, there will probably remain some Jealously and Discontent among you, that may inter∣rupt both your and our future Quiet, which we shou'd guard against by all Means in our Power.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I now acquaint you, that a Store of all forts of Goods fit for your Use is opened at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> where the Indians may be supplied at the most reasonable Rates, with any Goods they want; and the best Prices will be given to you for such Skins, Furrs and Peltry as you shall bring. Another Store is intended to be opened at Fort <HI>Allen</HI>; and you may depend upon it, that such Persons will be placed there, as shall use you with the strictest Justice in all their Dealings.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brother Teedyuscung,</HI></P>
<P>As I understood at our last Meeting, that you were prevented at that Time, by the Absence of some of the Chiefs of the United Nations, from finishing what you then had to say, I defer answering, for the Present, such part of your Speech as relates to me. But I shall soon take an Opportunity of doing it.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="24" REF="008157_0024_102E3ED0E8061BE8"/>
After the Governor had done speaking, <HI>Tagashata</HI> and <HI>Nichas</HI> arose, and said, <Q>They did not rightly understand that Sentence relating to the Lands, and requiring them to settle Matters among themselves: They said, the Governor had left Matters in the Dark; they did not know what Lands he meant: If he meant the Lands on the other Side of the Mountain, he knew the Proprietors had their Deeds for them, which ought to be produced and shewn to them. Their Deeds had their Marks, and when they shou'd see them, they wou'd know their Marks again.</Q></P>
<P>Then <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> produced the Deed of 1749; and the United Chiefs look'd at it, and said, <Q>This Deed we well remember: We knew our Chiefs who signed it; some of them are present now. We sold the Land, and were honestly paid for it: The Land was ours, and we will justify it.</Q> They then laid the Deed before <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and all lest the Council, and the Conference broke up.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> having Yesterday requested of the Governor, that two Belts, which he then presented to him, might be sent as their joint Belts to the <HI>Ohio</HI> Indians. This Day, the Chiefs of the United Nations and <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> had a Meeting with two Members of Governor DENNY'S Council; at which the following intended Answer, from Governor DENNY to the <HI>Ohio</HI> Indians, being first interpreted to the Indians, was considered, settled and approved by all present.</P>
<P><HI>Governor DENNY's Answer to the Message from the</HI> Ohio <HI>Indians, brought by</HI> Frederick Post, Pisquetomen <HI>and</HI> Thomas Hickman.</P>
<Q><P>BY this String, my Indian Brethren of the Six Nations, and <HI>Delawares,</HI> join with me, in requiring of the Indian Councils to which these following Messages shall be presented, to keep every Thing private from the Eyes and Ears of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We received your Message by <HI>Pisquetomen</HI> and <HI>Frederick Post,</HI> and thank you for the Care you have taken of our Messenger of Peace; and that you have put him in your Bosom, and protected him against our Enemy <HI>Onontio,</HI> and his Children, and sent him safe back to our Council Fire, by the same Man that received him from us.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I only sent <HI>Post</HI> to peep into your Cabbins, and to know the Sentiments of your old Men, and to look at your Faces, to see how you look. And I am glad to hear from him, that you look friendly, and that there still remain some Sparks of Love towards us. It is what we believed before-hand; and therefore we never let slip the Chain of Friendship, but held it fast on our Side, and it has never dropt out of our Hands. By this Belt we desire you will dig up your End of the Chain of Friendship, that you suffered, by the Subtlety of the <HI>French,</HI> to be buried.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It happened, that the Governor of <HI>Jersey</HI> was with me and a great many In∣dian Brethren, sitting in Council at <HI>Easton,</HI> when your Messengers arrived: And it gave Pleasure to every one that heard it; and it will afford the same Satisfacti∣on to our neighbouring Governors, and their People, when they come to hear it. I shall send Messengers to them, and acquaint them with what you have said.</P>
<P>Your requesting us, to let the King of <HI>England</HI> know your good Dispositions, we took to Heart, and shall let him know it; and we will speak in your Favour to his Majesty, who has for some Time past, looked upon you as his lost Chil∣dren. And we can assure you, that as a tender Father over all his Children, he will forgive what is past, and receive you again into his Arms.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="008157_0025_102E3ED37210CD90"/>
<HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>If you are in E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nest to be reconciled to us, you will keep your young Men from attacking our Country, and killing, and carrying Captive our back Inhabitants; and will likewise give Orders, that your People may be kept at a Distance from Fort <HI>Duquesne,</HI> that they may not be hurt by our Warriors, who are sent by our King, to chastise the <HI>French,</HI> and not to hurt you. Consider the command∣ing Officer of that Army treads heavy, and would be very sorry to hurt any of his Indian Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>A large Belt.</HI></P>
<P>And, <HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Chiefs of the United Nations, with their Cousins, our Brethren the <HI>Dela∣wares</HI> and others now here, jointly with me, send this Belt, which has upon it two Figures, that represent all the <HI>English,</HI> and all the Indians now present, taking Hands and delivering it to <HI>Pisquetomen</HI>; and we desire it may be likewise sent to the Indians who are named at the End of these Messages; as they have all been formerly our very good Friends and Allies; and we desire, they will all go from among the <HI>French</HI> to their own Towns, and no longer help the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>If you take the Belts we just now gave you, in which all here join, <HI>English</HI> and Indians, as we don't doubt you will; then, by this Belt, I make a Road for you, and invite you to come to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to your first old Council Fire, which was kindled when we first saw one another; which Fire we will kindle up again, and remove all Disputes, and renew the old and first Treaties of Friendship. There is a clear and open Road for you; fear therefore Nothing, and come to us, with as many as can be of the <HI>Delawares, Shawanese,</HI> or of the Six Nation Indians. We will be glad to see you; we desire all Tribes and Nations of Indians, who are in Alliance with you, may come. As soon as we hear of your coming, of which we desire you will give us timely Notice, we will lay up Provisions for you along the Road.</P>
<P><HI>A large white Belt, with the Figure of a Man at each End, and Streaks of Black, representing the Road from the</HI> Ohio <HI>to</HI> Philadelphia.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Six Nation and <HI>Delaware</HI> Chiefs, join with me in those Belts, which are tied together, to signify our Union and Friendship for each other; with them we jointly take the Tomhawk out of your Heads, and bury them under Ground.</P>
<P>We speak loud, so as you may hear us; you see we all stand together joined Hand in Hand.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Two Belts tied together.</HI></P>
<P>The Indian Chiefs being asked, if it would not be proper to insert in the Mes∣sage, an Account of the Situation of our Army to the Westward, and desire them to join General FORBES against the <HI>French,</HI> replied, that they would by no Means advise this Government so soon to press them to take up the Hatchet, because their Wounds were not yet healed, nor Peace made, which must first be done. They said further, that as the <HI>French</HI> had many Indians fighting for them, and they by Intermarriages were related to the Indians who sent the Messages, it could not be expected they would easily be persuaded to join the <HI>English,</HI> lest they should kill their own Flesh and Blood; adding, that the only proper Measure, that could now be taken, was to advise them to sit still and keep out of the Way: And this Ad∣vice they believed would be hearkened to.</P>
<P>They then desired, that, at least two of our Inhabitants might accompany <HI>Pisquetomen,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman,</HI> the two Messengers to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> The Confederate Chiefs pro∣mised to send two of their own People with them, and <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said he would send one, if not two <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>

<ITEM>Captain HENRY MONTOUR, His Majesty's Interpreter to the United Nations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. STEPHEN CALVIN, Interpreter of the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Minisink</HI> Languages.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>His Excellency informed them, that he met them to agree about a Consideration for the uncertain Claims of the <HI>Minisinks, Wapings</HI> and other Indians, Claimants of Land in the Northern Parts of the Province of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and desired that it might be considered, that they knew not what they sold, and he knew not what he bought; therefore the Price ought not to be large.</P>
<P>That they might propose a Sum to him, or he would make an Offer to them; or it should be left to their Uncles to consider of a Price, as would please them best.</P>
<P>The United Nations, by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> said, that they had no Claim to the Lands of the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> or others their Nephews, on the East Side of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and should therefore leave the fixing a Price to them.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Minisinks</HI> and <HI>Wapings</HI> withdrew to consult upon it, and being returned, <HI>Egobobowen,</HI> the <HI>Minisink</HI> Chief, said, they would choose the Governor should make an Offer, as they might perhaps demand too much.</P>
<P>His Excellency having consulted the Commissioners, offered them Eight Hun∣dred Spanish Dollars for their Claim in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> as an extraordinary Price.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minisinks</HI> said, they should be glad of the Opinion of their Uncles in the Matter.</P>
<P>The United Nations, by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> said, it was a fair and honourable Offer, and that, if it was their own Case, they would chearfully accept of it: But, as there were a great many Persons to share in the Purchase Money, they recommended it to his Excellency, to add two Hundred Dollars more; and, if that was complied with, the Report of it would be carried to all the Nations, and would be a great Proof of the Affection and Generosity of their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> on this Oc∣casion, and would be very agreeable to them.</P>
<P>His Excellency desired to know of the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and other Claimants, if they approved of the Proposal of their Uncles; and they informed him, that they did.</P>
<P>The Governor after consulting the Commissioners, said, it was more than he had intended to give; but as the United Nations had given themselves the Trouble of being Mediators between them, he could not refuse their Recommendations, and was glad of the Opportunity he had of shewing his Regard to the United Nations, and his Benevolence to the <HI>Minisink</HI> and other Indians, who had resided in the Province where he presided, and therefore complied with their Request.</P>
<P>His Excellency then desired them to remember, that this Consideration Money, was to be in full for the Claims of all the <HI>Minisink</HI> and <HI>Waping</HI> Indians, and all others who claim any Lands, in a Map, which was laid before them at the same Time, which <PB N="27" REF="008157_0027_102E3ED97A3D7450"/>included all the Lands from the Line between the Provinces of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and down <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, to the Mouth of <HI>Rariton</HI> up the same to <HI>Ala∣metung</HI> Falls, on the North Branch of <HI>Rariton</HI> River, thence on a streight Line to <HI>Paoqualin</HI> Mountain, where it joins on <HI>Delaware</HI> River, and thence up the <HI>Delaware</HI> to <HI>Cusbytunk</HI>; and recommended it to them to have Respect to this in the Divi∣sion of the Consideration Money.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Tagashata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, arose, and addressing himself to the <HI>Minisinks</HI> and other Indian Claimants, spoke as follows.</P>
<Q><P>My <HI>Nephews,</HI></P>
<P>I desire you will now give over all Thoughts of your Land, and that we may hear no more Complaints about it.</P>
<P>Now you must remember the Friendship between you and your Brother, and tran∣smit to your Children, and make them acquainted with the Transactions of this Day. I recommend this to you, not from my Lips only, but from the Bottom of my Heart: I hope it will also make a deep Impression in your Hearts.</P>
<P>It seems, as if your Grandfathers had not told you of the Treaties they used to have with their Brethren, but carried them with them to the Grave. But we hope you will not do so, but carefully inform your Children of your Agreements. We have given you this Advice, and hope you will follow it. We also expect you will take Care of your young Men, that they do no more Mischief to their Bre∣thren the <HI>English.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Egohohowen,</HI> then addressed himself to the Governor, and desired to be heard.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are now thoroughly satisfied, and we still retain a Friendship for our Bre∣thren the <HI>English,</HI> and we desire, that if we should come into your Province, to see our old Friends, and should have Occasion for the Bark of a Tree to cover a Cabbin, or a little Refreshment, that we should not be denied, but be treated as Brethren: And that your People may not look on the wild Beasts of the Forest, or Fish of the Waters, as their sole Property; but that we may be admitted to an equal Use of them.</P></Q>
<P>The Governor answered, that, as soon as he got Home, he should issue a Proclama∣tion, to notify to the People of his Province, that he had made a Peace with them, and to order, that, for the Future, they should be treated as Brethren, which he hoped would be done: But desired they would not go into those Parts, where they had lately committed Hostilities, till the People's Passions were cooled; for he could not be answerable for his People's Behaviour, whilst their Losses were fresh upon their Minds.</P>

<P>The Members of the <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> Council received a Message from Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> that the Chiefs of the United Nations were met in Council, with their Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> at the House of <HI>Nicholas Scull,</HI> and that the <HI>Delawares</HI> had something to say to their Uncles, which they desired some of the Members of that Council, and Commissioners should be Witnesses of, and hear.</P>

<HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> on Behalf of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> arose and spoke as follows.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>I desire you will hear me. We have gone so far at this Treaty, as to talk of Lands, I therefore thought proper to meet you here, to let you know, that I have consulted with all my Brethren, your Cousins here present, about the Deed you, our Uncles, signed to the Proprietors of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> shewn to us Yesterday, for the Lands beyond the <HI>Kittachtinny</HI> Hills.</P>
<P>We have seen the Deed, and know it well. <HI>Nutimus,</HI> one of our chief Men has signed it, and here sits one of our Men, named <HI>Philip Compass,</HI> who was pre∣sent when the Sale was made, and remembers, that <HI>Nutimus</HI> our Chief received Forty-four Dollars, as his Part or Share of the Consideration Money. We agree to it, and acknowledge the Land was fairly sold. We give it up, and now con∣firm it, that there may be no Difference, nor any Thing more said about it. This is not the Land I have disputed with my Brethren the <HI>English.</HI> That Land lies between <HI>Tohiccon</HI> Creek and the <HI>Kittachtinny</HI> Hills.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tokaaio,</HI> the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, stood up and spoke as follows, addressing himself to <HI>Teedyuscung.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Cousin,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for your Openess and Honesty on this Occasion, freely to de∣clare the Truth. We wish our Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> naming the Governors of <HI>Pennsylvania, Virginia, Carolina</HI> and <HI>Jersey,</HI> were so plain and precise. They have called us down to this Council Fire, which was kindled for Council Affairs, to renew Treaties of Friendship, and brighten the Chain of Friendship. But here we must hear a Dispute about Land, and our Time is taken up from Day to Day; but they do not come to the chief Point.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> first began to do Mischief; we told them so: They only thanked us for our Openness and Advice, and said they would take Care for the Future, but healed no Wounds. In short, when they speak to us, they do it with a shorter Belt or String, than that which we speak to them with; tho' they can make Wampum, and we cannot.</P>
<P>They ought not thus to treat with Indians on Council Affairs. Several of our Strings and Belts are lost in their Hands entirely. I fear they only speak from their Mouth, and not from their Heart.</P></Q>
<P>On the same Day, P. M. <HI>Pisquetomen</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI> came to take their Leave of the Governor, accompanied with Captain <HI>Bull,</HI> jun. <HI>William Hayes,</HI> and <HI>Isaac Stille,</HI> the Persons appointed to attend them to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> who were particu∣larly recommended to their Care and Protection, by a String of Wampum.</P>
<P>The Belts and Strings were numbered, as well in the written Paper containing the Messages, as on Labels tied to each of them, and delivered to <HI>Pisquetomen,</HI> and the written Message was delivered with the Passports to Captain <HI>Bull.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>The 22d of <HI>October.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The United Nation Chiefs held a private Council, and named two of their People to send to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> viz. <HI>Tojenontawoby,</HI> a <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, and the youngest <HI>Shick Calamy,</HI> who joined <HI>Plsquetomen,</HI> and set off this Afternoon.</P>
<P>As they were setting out, Mr. <HI>Frederick Post</HI> arrived with News from General <HI>Forbes,</HI> that a large Body of <HI>French</HI> and Indians, having attacked his advanced Post at <HI>Lloyal-Hanning,</HI> were repulsed with great Loss on their Side; which News was communicated to the Indians.</P>
<P>The Governors proposed a Meeting of the Indians, but they desired it might be deferred till the Morning.</P>

<P>PRESENT, The Governors, and the Gentlemen of their Council, &amp;c. <HI>as before.</HI></P>
<P>The Minutes were read and approved, to the End of the publick Conference on Friday last, after which Governor DENNY, for himself and Governor BERNARD, spoke.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt, we heal your Wounds; we remove your Grief; we take the Hatchet out of your Heads; we make a deep Hole in the Earth, and bury the Hatchet so low, that no Body shall be able to dig it up again.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Now we have healed your Wounds, we, by this Belt, renew all our Treaties; we brighten the Chain of Friendship; we return to our first Affection; we confirm our antient Union; we put fresh Earth to the Roots of the Tree of Peace, that it may bear up against every Storm that can blow, and live and flourish to the End of Time, whilst the Sun shines, and the Rivers run. And we desire you wou'd publish it among your own and all other Indian Nations, who are your Friends and Allies, and engage them to join with you in a firm Peace with his Majesty, and all his Subjects; in whose Behalf we give you this Belt</P></Q>
<P><HI>A large Peace Belt delivered by the two Governors to the confederate Chiefs, and by them banded round to all the Indians present.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We now open a Road to the Old Council Fire, which was kindled by your and our Fathers in the City of <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> Be assured, that you will always find this Road open, easy and pleasant to travel in, and for the Future whenever Occasion calls, we shall be glad to see you there.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, of the United Nations, and all our other Brethren, your Cousins and Nephews.</HI></P>
<P>We thank you, for the Care and Diligence with which you have attended to the several Matters recommended to you in these Conferences, which have yielded us Abundance of Satisfaction. This Treaty will convince all our Enemies, that we are now united in the firmest Band of Amity; and whilst we join our Strength together, it will not be in their Power to hurt either you or us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As a Token of the Love we your Brethren of this Province bear you, I shall make a Present of a Quantity of Goods, which we have prepared for you, and desire your Acceptance of them; sensible of the approaching Season, and of the many Difficulties you live under, from the present War. We give them with an hearty good Will.</P></Q>
<P>Here his Honour delivered a List of the Goods, and desired Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> and Mr. <HI>Montour</HI> wou'd interpret it to them at a proper Time.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Nichas,</HI> on the Behalf of the three elder Nations; <HI>Thomas King,</HI> on the Behalf of the five younger Nations, and <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> on the Behalf of the other Nations, gave the <HI>Yohan,</HI> and <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> returned it twice on the Behalf of the Governors: After which Governor DENNY said,</P>
<P><HI>Brother Teedyuscung,</HI></P>
<Q><P>BY this Belt you put me in Mind, that we formerly referred our Dispute about Lands to our Father King GEORGE, and you desired to know if he has decided it.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="008157_0030_102E3EDF57FD9DE8"/>
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You shou'd consider the Circumstances of the Affairs of your Father King GEORGE: His Majesty lives at a very great Distance from us, is now engaged in a War with the <HI>French</HI>; and the Business of War takes up a great deal of Time and Attention: Besides, in Time of War, we have but few Opportunities of hearing from him.</P>
<P>As yet I have had no Answer relative to your Affairs. You may depend upon it, as soon as I receive one, it shall be communicated to you. And I can assure you, the Proprietors have pressed Dispatch, and will do every Thing they can, to bring it to a speedy Determination.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Then Governor BERNARD, requesting the Attention of the Indians, addressed them as follows,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren, of the United Nations,</HI></P>
<P>BY this String, you spoke on Behalf of our Brethren the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and said, "That they were wronged in their Lands; that the <HI>English</HI> settled so fast, they were continually pushing them back; and when they asked for their Lands, they were told that they had sold their Lands, and had got drunk and forgot it. If they had swallow'd their Lands, they must be content; but they did not believe that they had swallow'd all, but that some was left. They desired, that I wou'd enquire after their Lands that were left, and to them Justice.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad I have an Opportunity, in the Presence of so many Nations, to express the Desire I have of doing Justice to every one. The Throne of the Great King is founded on Justice: And I shou'd not be a faithful Servant to him, if I neglected to give Redress to all Persons, that have received Injuries from the People, over whom the Great King has placed me.</P>
<P>I have therefore had a Conference with the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> in the Presence of some of their Uncles; and have come to a full Agreement with them, the Proceedings of which are now ready to be read to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have another Proof to give you of the Uprightness and Justice of our Province. We have come to an Agreement with the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and other Indians for the un∣certain Claims they had on the Southern Parts of our Province. I hereby produce the Deeds, that have been executed on this Occasion, that the Subject of them may be explained to you, and be had in perpetual Remembrance by all the Nations present: And I desire, that you may all remember, that, by these two Agreements, the Province of <HI>New-Jersey</HI> is entirely freed and discharged from all Indian Claims. In Confirma∣tion of which, I give you this Belt.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother Teedyuscung,</HI></P>
<Q><P>By this String you tell me, that, after the Killing the nine Indians near <HI>Esopus,</HI> you carried three Belts to <HI>George Vreeland,</HI> who undertook to give them to the Gover∣nor, and you ask what is become of those Belts.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I can only say, that I never heard of those Belts before; nor do I know what Governor <HI>George Vreeland</HI> undertook to carry those Belts to. The proper Governor was the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI>; for in his Province was this Mischief committed. And probably the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> had these Belts; for I have heard that be issued a Proclamation for apprehending the Perpetrators of this Fact. This Fact has been blamed by all good and wise Men; and I am glad it was not done by the People of my Province. I will acquaint the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> with what you have said upon this Occasion, and I will enquire after those Belts, and give you an Answer.</P></Q>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>Governor DENNY, being obliged to return to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on urgent Business, took his Leave of the Indians, saying.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>IT gives me great Pleasure that the Business of this Treaty has been carried on with so much Satisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="008157_0031_102E3EE2D21B8B38"/>
I am sorry, I am now to inform you, that I am obliged to leave you, having received last Night an Express from General <HI>Forbes,</HI> who is now near the <HI>Ohio.</HI> My Business calls me to Town; I shall therefore leave Mr. <HI>Logan</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> to transact the Remainder of the Business, and doubt not but they will act to your Satisfaction. I assure you of my Affection for you, and wish you all Manner of Happiness.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> arose, and desired to be heard on Behalf of the <HI>Wapings,</HI> living near <HI>AEsepus,</HI> and produced a short broad Belt of white Wampum, having in the Center, two Hearts of a reddish Colour, and in Figures 1745, wrote after the following Manner, 17 ♥ ♥ 45. The Belt had a round Circle Pendant, representing the Sun: He then produced two Certificates, One from Governor CLINTON, and the other from Governor HARDY, both which were much in Favour of the <HI>Waping</HI> Indians. He said the Belt was given them by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and represented their Union, which was to last as long as the Sun should continue in the Firmament.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> addressed Governor BERNARD, desiring by a String of Wampum, that he would extend his Protection to the <HI>Wapings</HI>; and as their Chief was old and infirm, he requested the Favour of a Horse to carry him Home; which was readily granted.</P>
<P><HI>Tagashata</HI> made the same Request to Governor DENNY, which was likewise granted.</P>
<P>The Six Nation Chiefs consulted together, and in a little Time, <HI>Nichas,</HI> in their Behalf, returned an Answer to the Speeches of the Governors, laying the Belts and Strings upon the Table, in the Order they were delivered, and repeating distinctly what was said on each of them. At the End of every Article he returned Thanks, and expressed the highest Satisfaction, particularly on the ratifying the Peace, and the large Belt given thereupon, which he said should be sent to all the distant Nations of Indians, to whom it would be very agreeable; he likewise promised, that every Thing transacted in these Conferences, which he again said had afforded them great Pleasure, should be laid before the great Council at <HI>Onondaga,</HI> whose Answers should be carefully transmitted.</P>
<P>He thanked Governor BERNARD for making up all the Differences between that Government and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Minisink</HI> Indians so much to their Satisfaction.</P>
<P>He made an Apology for the Want of Wampum, and the Exchange of other Belts to give in Confirmation of their Performance of the several Things mentioned in the Governors Speeches, agreeable to Indian Customs. And then wished Gover∣nor DENNY a good Journey.</P>

<P>Mr. Secretary <HI>Peters</HI> having observed to the confederate Chiefs, that the Gover∣nors were by <HI>Tokaaio,</HI> charged with having omitted some Things in their Answers, and desired to know what they were. <HI>Thomas King</HI> said, that in Regard to some Things, they had been since supplied, and recommended that some other Things should be more particularly taken Notice of than they had been. Wherefore agree∣able to his Advice, the following Speech was spoke by the Members of the <HI>Penn∣sylvanian</HI> Council, Governor BERNARD assenting thereto.</P>
<Q><P>Brethren,</P>
<P>AS we have now settled all Differences, and confirmed the antient Leagues of Amity, and brightened the Chain of Friendship; we now clean the Blood off your Council Seats, and put them in Order, that when you hold Councils at Home, you may sit in your Seats with the same Peace and Tranquility as you formerly used to do.</P>
<P>A string consisting of a Thousand Grains of Wampum.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>With this String of Wampum, we condole with you for the Loss of your wise Men, and for the Warriors that have been killed in these troublesome Times, and likewise for your Women and Children, and we cover their Graves decently agreeable to the Custom of your Forefathers.</P>
<P>A String of a Thousand Grains of Wampum.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>We disperse the dark Clouds that have hung over our Heads, during these Troubles, that we may see the Sun clear, and look on each other with the Chear∣fulness our Forefathers did.</P>
<P>A String of a Thousand Grains of Wampum.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="33" REF="008157_0033_102E3EE8D9A644D8" MS="y"/>
Then Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> and Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> produced the Confirmation Deed, executed by the Chiefs of the United Nations, as before set forth, which the Indian Chiefs acknow∣ledged to have been their voluntary Act and Deed, and that they clearly understood the Contents thereof, together with the Limits described in the Draught annexed to it; and the same being handed from Indian to Indian, all round the House, it was delivered to the Proprietor's Agents.</P>
<P>After which the Indian Chiefs produced the Proprietary Deed of Release, executed by Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> and Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> the Proprietary's Agents; who acknowledged it to be their Act and Deed, in Behalf of their Constituents, as well as their own, and re-delivered it to the Indians, together with the Belt.</P>
<P>His Excellency Governor BERNARD produced the following Deeds: One Deed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> executed by five Indian Attornies, appointed by a Council of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nations, for all the Lands lying in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> South of a Line from <HI>Paoqualin</HI> Mountains at <HI>Delaware</HI> River, to the falls of <HI>Alamatung,</HI> on the North Branch of <HI>Rariton</HI> River, thence down that River to <HI>Sandy-Hook</HI>; dated the 12th of <HI>September</HI> last, with Endorsements thereon, made by <HI>Teedyuscung, Unwal∣licon</HI> and <HI>Tepascawen,</HI> signifying their Agreement thereto, and Acknowledgment of their having received Satisfaction thereon; Witnessed by three Chiefs of the Six Nations, who in Behalf of the Six Nations, approved the Sale, and also by several <HI>English</HI> Witnesses. And another Deed, dated the 23d <HI>October,</HI> Instant, at <HI>Easton</HI>; from the Chiefs of the <HI>Munsies, Wapings, Opings,</HI> or <HI>Pomptons,</HI> Sixteen in Number, and including all the remaining Lands in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> beginning at <HI>Cushytunk,</HI> and down the Division Lines between <HI>New-Jersey</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> to the Mouth of <HI>Tappan</HI> Creek at <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, and down the same to <HI>Sandy-Hook,</HI> thence to the Mouth of <HI>Rariton,</HI> thence up that River to the Falls of <HI>Alamatung,</HI> thence on a strait Line to <HI>Paoqualin</HI> Mountains, where it joins on <HI>Delaware</HI> River, thence up the River <HI>Dela∣ware</HI> to <HI>Cushytunk</HI>; endorsed by <HI>Nimham</HI> a Chief of the <HI>Opings</HI> or <HI>Pomptons,</HI> who was sick at the Execution thereof, and approved by the Six Nations, which was testified by three of their Chiefs, signing as Witnesses thereto: And Governor BARNARD desired that all present might take Notice of the same, and remember that the Indian Titles to all the Lands in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> were conveyed by those two Deeds.</P>
<P>Which being intepreted in the <HI>Mingo</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI> Languages; His Excellency addressed the Indians, as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q><P>I AM very glad this good Work has been so happily finished. I came among you wholly unacquainted with your Forms, and therefore, if I have omitted any Ceremonies, you will readily excuse me. But in whatever I have been deficient, I am sure, I have not wanted a good Heart towards you.</P>
<P>The Circumstances of our Province, have hitherto rendered us unable to give you any great Proofs of our Regard for you. But I shall endeavour to persuade my People, to do you good Service for the future, by opening a Communication with you; which if rightly managed, will be much to the Advantage of both People. And for my own Part, I shall be always ready to do you Justice; and desire that whenever you have Cause of Complaint against my People, you will take care to signify it to me.</P></Q>
<P>A String.</P>
<P>The Five Nation Chiefs, laid all the Belts and Strings on the Table, that were delivered at this and the last Conference. <HI>Tokaaio,</HI> the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, desired the Governor and all present, would take Notice of what <HI>Thomas King</HI> was going to say, on Behalf of the United Nations.</P>
<P>On which <HI>Thomas King</HI> arose, and taking up the first Belt which was given by <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> when he requested a Deed for the <HI>Wioming</HI> Lands, he addressed the <HI>Delawares,</HI> (<HI>Teedyuscung</HI> not being present) as follows.</P>
<Q><PB N="34" REF="008157_0034_102E3EEC600EAA40"/>
<P><HI>Cousins,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> desired us to make you the Owners of the Lands at <HI>Wioming, Shamokin</HI> and other Places on the <HI>Susquehannah</HI> River; in Answer to which, we who are present say, That we have no Power to convey Lands to any one, but we will take your Request to the Great Council Fire, for their Sentiments, as we never sell or convey any Land, till it be agreed on at the Great Council of the United Nations. In the mean Time, you may make use of these Lands, in Conjunction with our People, and all the rest of our Relations, the Indians of the different Nations in our Alliance.</P></Q>
<P>Which being interpreted into <HI>Delaware,</HI> the String of Wampum was given to <HI>Moses Tetamy</HI> and <HI>James Davis,</HI> to be delivered to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> as he was not present.</P>
<P>Then taking up each Belt and String in the Order it was delivered in this, and the last Conference, he proceeded to repeat distinctly, what had been said under each Article, returning Thanks for all those good Speeches, which he said, were extreamly agreeable. He made particular Mention of the large Peace Belt, saying, <Q>The Nations are greatly pleased, that all the antient Treaties made here, at <HI>Albany,</HI> and elsewhere, are renewed, as well as that the Old Council Fire at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> is kindled again, and a good Road made to it, that may be travelled without any Danger: These in particular, as well as every other Matter transacted at these Conferences, we will make known to our own Nations, and to every other in Friendship and Alliance with us, and we are sure they will be very well received.</Q></P>
<P>Then addressing Governor BERNARD, he thanked him for his farewell Speech, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <Q>It was a very kind one, and that they were much pleased with his having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een present, and given his Assistance at this Treaty, which had given them an Op∣portunity of gaining an Acquaintance with him, which they would ever remember with Pleasure. After a Pause he desired to be excused for mentioning some Thing that had been omitted by the Governors and their Councils.</Q></P>
<Q><P>They have forgot to bring with them Ammunition, of which we always used to receive a sufficient Quantity, not only to serve us in our Journey, but to support us in our hunting Season, that we might be enabled to make Provision for our Families. They have given us Gunlocks without Guns, which are of no Manner of Use to us; and therefore this must have surely been forgot, as it is impossible for Indians to subsist without Guns, Powder and Lead, of which we have received none.</P>
<P>As many of us are old and infirm, we desire our Brethren, will be so good as to furnish us with a Number of Waggons, to convey such of us, as are not able to walk, and the Goods you have been pleased to give us, as far as <HI>Wioming,</HI> where we have left our Canoes, and then we will discharge the Waggons, and they may come back again.</P>
<P>We further desire a Supply of Provisions may be put into the Waggons, enough to serve us till we get to our respective Habitations.</P></Q>
<P>He then took up the Proprietary Release, and returned Thanks for it. He said, <Q>When the United Nations first made the Request to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> to be tran∣smitted to <HI>Onas,</HI> they had no doubt but <HI>Onas</HI> would comply with it, having always found him ready to grant all their Requests. With him we have never had any Difference, he has always settled our Affairs without giving us any Trouble, and to our Satisfaction. We heartily thank <HI>Onas</HI>; this Act confirms us in the good Opinion we always had of him.</Q></P>
<P>Then addressing himself to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> with a String of Wampum, he spoke as follows,</P>
<Q><PB N="35" REF="008157_0035_102E3EEEE05E9F00"/>
<P>This serves to put <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> in mind of his Promises, to return the Prisoners: Remember, Cousins, you have made this Promise in our Presence; you did it indeed before, and you ought to have performed it: To tell Lies, does not become a Great Man: A Great Man always keeps his Word and performs his Promises. Cousins, You must not now fail to keep your Word: We are all now one People, and we must all be punctual in the Performance of our Engagements.</P></Q>
<P>This was interpreted into the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, and the String was given to <HI>Moses Tetamy,</HI> to be delivered to <HI>Teedyuscung.</HI></P>
<P>Then he said, the United Nations had finished what they had to say.</P>
<P>Some Wine and Punch was called for, and mutual Healths were drank, and the Conferences were concluded with great Satisfaction.</P>
