<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>ADULTERY is become so fashionable, and Divorces so frequent, that it may ad∣mit of some debate in the polite world whether the first is criminal or the latter dishonourable: the law, however, judiciously punishes the one and stigmatizes the other.</P>
<P><HI>Advowtry,</HI> which in the old law-book signifies adultery, is the sin of incontinence between two married persons; but if only one of the persons be married, it is, nevertheless, adultery. In this last case, however, it is called simple adul∣tery, to distinguish it from the other which is compound. This crime was severely punished by the laws of God, and the antient laws of the land. The Julian law among the old Romans made it death; but in most countries (as is the case in England) it is at this period punished by fine, and in others by banishment. According to the law made by William the Conqueror, who∣ever, forced a Woman should lose his genitals, the offending parts. Before the statute of the 22d Charles II. which made malicious maim∣ing felony, it was a question, whether cutting off the privy members of a man taken in adultery with another man's wife was felony or not? as an instance of which, in the thirteenth year of
<PB N="iv" REF="011898_0003_0F874B2B1061EC88"/>
Henry III. one <HI>John</HI> a monk, being taken by Henry Hull in the act with his wife, he cut off the privy-members, of the monk, and was only indicted for a <HI>maheim,</HI> or maiming.</P>
<P>Hence it plainly appears that the statute enact∣ed in the reign of that amorous prince, Charles the Second, who doubtless had an eye therein to the very business in question, hath wonderfully propagated and secured the honourable, noble, (I had almost said royal) practice of perform∣ing the drudgery of matrimonial duty; for we cannot suppose the knight errants of those, or the present times, however valorous in espous∣ing the causes, and the protection of their mistres∣ses, would have chosen so publickly (as they have since done) to manifest their abilities in in∣trigues of this kind, had they run the risk of legally losing those very <HI>important</HI> parts, which would ever after have disqualified them from entering the lists of gallantry. I shall not even scruple to suppose that his R. H. notwithstanding the many disguises he took upon himself, and condescensions he submitted to, would have per∣severed either in his intrigue, or his <HI>elegant</HI> cor∣respondence (which was so immediately the means of detection) had not his whole person (which certainly includes those parts) been <HI>sacred,</HI> and had he not been convinced that the greatest damages that could happen to him, would be only issuing a little more money out of the T—y, either for <HI>secret</HI> services or publick law-suits <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide the Damages obtained by Mr. Wilkes against Lord Hallifax, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> (as in similar <HI>cases</HI>) which might, indeed, terminate
<PB N="v" REF="011898_0003_0F874B2B1061EC88"/>
in an additional tax upon <HI>any thing</HI> left <HI>untaxed,</HI> or a new Stamp Act <HI>properly modified</HI> to <HI>quiet</HI> the minds of the people of North America.</P>
<P>As to her Ladyship she seemed resolved at all events to imbibe the sublime sentiments inherent in r—l blood; as either she had, or was very near having a similar connexion with the late duke of Y—k before his departure for the con∣tinent, and which was so generally talked of, that at length it was imparted to Lord Gro—r, and a separation had then nearly taken place up∣on that account; but upon her promising his Lordship in the most solemn manner that she would never again speak to <HI>that</HI> R. H. in <HI>private,</HI> he forgave her. Indeed, her Ladyship may plead something in her excuse, besides her fond∣ness for an alliance with r—l blood; as it is well known that her marriage was not a match of her own choice; but strongly recommended to her by her parents. An anecdote is handed about of her first acquaintance with his Lordship, which is as follows: Lord G— had in his youth led a very debauched life, and had almost de∣stroyed his constitution, by a certain disease which is never communicated but by the ladies; his physicians therefore advised him, as the only means of preserving the small share of health that he remained possessed of, to marry: he ac∣cordingly resolved to marry the first woman of family that was agreeable to him, without paying any regard to fortune. Just as he had come to this resolution, he was walking one day in Ken∣sington gardens, whilst his coach was waiting for him at the gate, and a shower of rain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="vi" REF="011898_0004_0F874B2E1FE4A470"/>
on, he took shelter in the same alcove where Miss V—n (his present lady) and her sister <HI>Carry</HI> had retired for shelter. After some com∣mon conversation upon the weather, and other general topicks, he asked the ladies, if they had not a carriage at hand, to do him the honour of taking part of his; which, with very little in∣treaty, they consented to, as it was likely to be a rainy evening. His Lordship was at first-sight struck with Miss V— and was only waiting for an opportunity of saying a civil thing to her, when upon the road Miss V— declaring,
<Q>she thought his Lordship's coach was the easiest she ever rode in;</Q>
he replied
<Q>he was very happy at its meeting with her approbation; and that she might be mistress of it whenever she pleased.</Q>
She blushed, without making any reply, which he construed into a favourable omen; and the next day he applied to her rela∣tions to obtain their consent to pay his addres∣ses to Miss V—. So great a match highly flattered her mother's ambition; and she prevail∣ed on Miss V— to give his Lordship her hand, though she then declared he was very disagree∣able to her; add to this, her mother, who, on account of her employment in the princess Ame∣lia's houshold, strove upon every occasion to shew the greatest respect to all the r—l family, constantly recommended to her daughter <HI>never to refuse any thing</HI> the K—'s brother requested;— which lady G—r has most <HI>dutifully obeyed.</HI> This she may, at least, plead as some excuse to her relations; but it is a moot point whether it is so good a one as what F—te made for her to lady
<PB N="vii" REF="011898_0004_0F874B2E1FE4A470"/>
H—r—n some weeks since, when he was taking chocolate with her.—
<Q>Good heaven, said her ladyship, is it not astonishing that lady G—r should prefer the D— of C— to lord G—!</Q>
<Q>not at all, my Lady, <HI>replied the wag,</HI> for his R. H. is only <HI>Dis—</HI> but his L—p is <HI>DEATH</HI> itself.</Q></P>
<P>Now we have introduced F—te we shall also introduce a few more of his <HI>bon mots</HI> up∣on this occasion. He said the other day,
<Q>the present K— had created Sir Richard G—r a <HI>Lord,</HI> and his brother had created him a <HI>Cuc∣kold</HI>; dignities somewhat similar according to the present times; and the more so as they had both tipt his head with gold, the first his <HI>coronet,</HI> the last his <HI>horns.</HI></Q></P>
<P>His R. H. asked F—te, the last time he dined with him at North-End, what he thought about his Letters that were read in court.—
<Q>Think, please your H—s, (said Sam) it is impossible to think about them, as you never once thought when you wrote them.</Q></P>
<P>His R. H. told F—te, a short time since, in great confidence,
<Q>That Lady G—r was one of the most sensible women in England; and that he should one day or other see her Letters.</Q>
The day after the trial this genius said,
<Q>I am convinced of what your R. H. said.—She is a damn'd sensible woman as to <HI>parts</HI>; but it was left for a man of your H—s's penetration to discover her genius.</Q>
The same great mimic observed,
<Q>That in several parts of the country a certain perso∣nage, in the course of his intrigue, was taken,
<PB N="viii" REF="011898_0005_0F874B2EA9E76EA8"/>
by his disguise in a black wig, for a horse∣stealer and a highwayman; but no where for a <HI>conjurer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is positively asserted that this course of cor∣respondence was not the first grounds of suspi∣cion: for that lord G—, having surprised a packet with one of the D— of C's curious epistles ad∣dressed to his Lady, which Mrs. Reda the mil∣lener, opposite St. Alban's-street, Pall-mall, was bringing to her immediately after her lying-in, or at least before she had been abroad; his Lord∣ship had the great good nature, upon her Lady∣ship's assuring him that nothing had passed be∣tween her and the D— but indiscretions of the least vicious kind, not only to forgive her, but assure her, that if she gave him no cause for future discontent, the discovery he <HI>had made</HI> should never be public, nor go farther than be∣tween him and her. But the interception of the first letter annexed rekindled all his resent∣ment.</P>
<P>The Editor of these sheets has taken the earliest opportunity of laying them before the public, as this is the most important and remark∣able Trial that ever came before a court of judi∣cature; and the only one that has any similarity to it, fell out in the last century, when Robert earl of Southesk charged his R. H. James duke of York (afterwards James II.) with an amour with his countess; but it was never brought into court: nor is there, perhaps, any precedent in any country of a like process; and though no more than 10,000l. damages were granted, it evidently demonstrates the integrity and up∣right
<PB N="ix" REF="011898_0005_0F874B2EA9E76EA8"/>
sentiments of a British jury, who pay no regard to rank, title, or station, but ad∣minister justice with equal impartiality, from the first to the last subject in the land. His lordship has thereby obtained all he desired by this verdict,—a divorce; and had he received ten times the damages he would have applied it in the like manner he pro∣poses doing these, by distributing them to the most useful and beneficial public charities. So little temptation, indeed, has money in the eyes of his Lordship, that it is confidently asserted that 50,000l. were offered from a certain quarter, to stop the prosecution, but nobly refused by his Lordship.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRIAL OF His R. H. the D. of C. FOR CRIMINAL CONVERSATION WITH Lady HARRIET G—R.</HEAD>
<P>ON Thursday, July the 5th, 1770, at eight in the morning, came on, in the Court of King's Bench, Westminster, before the Right Hon. Lord Mansfield, the cause, wherein Richard Baron G—r was plaintiff, against his R. H. the D. of C. for criminal conversation with Harriet, the wife of the said Lord G—r.</P>

<P>It was contended by the counsel for the defendant, that the laying the damage at 100,000<HI>l.</HI> was excessive and immoderate; but to this it was answered, that, in the reign of Charles the Second, much higher damages were sued for by the then Duke of York, against one Pilkington, a Sheriff of the city of Lon∣don, in an action of <HI>scandalum magnatum,</HI> in the King's Bench, and a verdict of 100,000<HI>l.</HI> was ob∣tained in his favour; and it was farther urged, that when the injury was done to an inferior, that circum∣stance alone greatly aggravated the offence.</P>
<P>Mr. Wedderburn, in the course of opening the cause, strongly insisted on the case becoming more criminal on account of the rank of the defendant: This he instanced in two cases; the first was that of Lord Belvidere in the kingdom of Ireland, whose bro∣ther (Mr. Rochford) having crim. con. with his lady, his lordship obtained 20,000<HI>l.</HI> damages, tho' the de∣fendant's fortune was no way answerable to such a sum. The other was a case of defamation brought by James II. when Duke of York, against a trades∣man in the city, when the damages were likewise laid high: "And these, continued the learned counsel, were given for very substantial reasons; to shew so∣ciety,
<PB N="13" REF="011898_0007_0F874B301DB84AA8"/>
that where particular duty and respect is re∣quired, an action of criminality becomes doubly so, when these ties are broke through.</P>
<P>Mr. Wedderburn then methodically stated the facts. He set forth, that his R. H. in his excursions to Towcester in Northamptonshire, Coventry, Mar∣court-Hill, Whitchurch in Shropshire, Chester, and St. Alban's, in order to meet Lady G—r, assum∣ed, at different times, the names of 'Squire Morgan, 'Squire Jones, the Farmer, &amp;c. that he sometimes appeared as a young 'Squire disordered in his senses, and used to be called at the inns the Fool, particu∣larly at Whitchurch, where a noise being heard in passing from one room to the other, it was disregarded by the people of the house, who said it was only the Fool; and that he had taken down with him to St. Alban's a servant, who went by the name of Trusty, for the purpose of carrying on his intrigue with great∣er security: That they had witnesses to prove, that Lady G— was several times carried to the back door of the D. of C's house in the Park, where she went in, and staid for a considerable time. That se∣veral of Lord G—'s servants went down to St. Alban's with his Lordship's brother, who, upon breaking open the door at the inn, found the D. of C. sitting on the bed-side along with lady G—, with his waistcoat loose, and the lady with her Dresden unbuttoned, and her breasts wholly exposed; that on their entering, her ladyship made towards the door of communication with the next room, but in the attempt fell; on which he, who was left to guard the door they entered by, went to her assistance, which his R. H. availed himself of, and run out, calling on them, when he got on the other side of the door, "to take notice, he was not found in the room; and that he would take his Bible oath, he was not."</P>
<P>But Mr. Wedderburn said, previous to his calling several witnesses to prove this, and many other im∣portant facts, he should read to the court several let∣ters
<PB N="14" REF="011898_0008_0F874B3122264770"/>
written by Lady G—r to the D. of C. and from the D. of C. to her ladyship, which would set the nature of their connexion beyond a doubt; first premising by what means they had fallen into Lord G—r the plaintiff's hands.</P>
<P>His lordship meeting with one of his servants, near Chester, going with a letter from his Lady to put into the post, stopt him to go upon another errand, taking the letter, and saying he would put it in himself: he then had the curiosity to open it, which he found to be the first <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See p. 22.</NOTE> letter from Lady G— to his R. H. when, after having taken a copy of it, he put it into the post, and intercepted all the rest.</P>
<P>Mr. Wedderburn then read the letters in the fol∣lowing order.</P>

<P>I Sent a letter last night but fear you could not receive it while on shore, but I hope it wd not be long getting to you, I hope you are perfectly well, and have had a good voyage so farr.</P>
<P>he appears rather in better temper to day, so I'm in great hopes he did not get enough of the Letter to make out much he stayed out very late last night which seems to have occasioned a <HI>weezing</HI> to day, by the means of my Sisters I think I can send and receive my Letters very safe for the future. Carry is out of Town for a few days so in the mean time I send them by another Sister who comes to see me every day, and she thinks it some business I have with Reda about some Milenary that I dont chuse he should know of so if she gets ever a Letter for me she knows she is not to take it out of her pocket till we are alone so its all cleverly settled again at present, how miserable I should have been if we could not have contrived to hear from one another, I quite live only upon the thoughts of its not being a great while before I have the happiness of a Letter from you, for I'm very sure you'll write as soon as you can, I know your tender∣ness for me well enough to be certain of that,—</P>

Brother, perhaps he is gone to ask his advice, but I don't care he may take what measures he pleases with me if you will but love me, I'd a note from Mrs. Re∣da this evening she sais she is certain he dares not say a word to her but she wishes he would above all things for that she knows very well how to answer him for that she knows enough of his Intrigues for him to be afraid of saying any thing to her, and she is sure he is not <HI>assez Hardi</HI> to say a word to her upon the sub∣ject, her note was in answer to one she had received from me to prepare her in case he should speak to her and I told her if he asked her any questions to say she knew nothing of where or who the Letter came from—I hope I shall be in London when you come back, I dares say I shall I fancy he had not a mind to part with me let him have seen what he wou'd in the Letter for he asked me Yesterday when I shou'd be able to go into Cheshire, I told him I co'd not give the least guess as it depended intirely upon how I was, and I think I've laid a good scheme for I've alreaddy complained I've got a pain in my side &amp; I in∣tend to say it's much worse at the end of the month and that I can't bear the motion of a carriage, it will I really believe be a very good plan, for if I said I had a Feaver or any thing of that kind a physician wou'd know by my pulse I had not &amp; might discover me to him, and besides this will be a more lasting complaint so at the end of five or six weeks, I'll grow very ill and send for Fordyce the Apothecary and make him send me a quantity of nasty draughts which I'll throw out of the window only think how wicked I am for in reality I'm already as strong and as well as ever I was in my life, Ly Harrington called upon me the other day to know how I did I long'd to see her but dared not as he was at home, I intend to go to her as soon as I can get out, Lady Barrymore was with her I've heard nothing of D— I suppose she is afraid of wri∣ting or coming as he is in Town but I shall write to her soon, my month is out by the week the 5th of July but by the month not till the 7th so I'll take it

<DATE>Friday Night</DATE></OPENER>
<P>HOW happy you made me by your Letter it seem ages to me since I heard from you tho' in reality not many days, but Minutes count for years with those that love, but I dont like to hear that you have still a little cough you dont take care of yourself, I wish I could take care of you indeed— he went out yesterday morning to Hallkin and Holy∣well and dont return till tomorrow dinner, he left Mr. Gros—r and 3 or 4 people with me, who are gone and Mr. G— is just gone out for an hour, so I take this favourable time to write to you and shall send it off in the Morning, I long most heartily for the time I shall see you again, your letter came per∣fectly safe, I was so happy to get it, I hope you will have received my last safe where I sent you the Ac∣count of Hollywell, only think of your having lost your road to Tarpolly I should have been so misera∣ble if I'd known it at the time I'm so sorry, how dreadful at that time of night its a terrible intricket road, I'd a very odd discourse with Mr. G— to day about my Lord he first begun by saying he was very uneasy about his health and did not think he was so well as he used to be &amp; he ought to take great care, he after that said he thought he gave up his whole time attention and fortune to Horses and was worse and worse infatuated than ever about them and that he never could talk upon any other subject therefore he never could have any discourse with him and that he would lose all his acquaintance but Jockeys, I could not help laughing at his description of him which was very just for sais he he will set for half an hour with his eyes fixed on a Table or Chair and then apply to Tomm or any body that is by, do you know what Mare such a Filly was out of, or can you tell what Horse such a Colt was got by, by God, I have got the best stud in England no body will have any horses to run but me very soon, then if he or any body that
<PB N="26" REF="011898_0014_0F874B36DB892DD8"/>
don't understand that subject offers to mention any thing else he is as cross as any thing for half an hour, and then fast asleep, so sais Mr. G— you see nobody ever comes to see him but in partys. I never do sais he I always get people to come every day to meet me or else I know my amusement would be to see him snoring in one corner of the room instead of being sociable &amp; like other people—this was as you may imagine a Tete a Tete subject but its so exact a picture of him I was resolved you should have it—I'll tell you how I pass my time I get up about eight or I'm afraid nine Breakfast at ten then walk or ride dine at 3, stupifie or play at stupified Cards after Tea with any body that drops in (he never plays) this lasts till supper but I now &amp; then steal off we sup soon after nine, and in bed before eleven, where I always dream of you my Dearest Friend—I hope soon to have a letter from Carry with some writing from you in Milk, I fancy we shant go to Mrs. H—, till Wednesday when I shall hope for a letter from you if it arrives before me it will be safe as I'd a letter to day to say if any came from Carry they should be taken care off, I imagine we shant come away till quite the end of the week and shall then be so happy in the thoughts of seeing you in a few days, how I long for the 1st and 2d of December and yet it is being too selfish for what a situ∣ation for you but I'll say no more of that as you are so kind to say you dont mind it, to day is my Birth day, I think it has turned out quite lucky to me as I've such an opportunity of writing to you. Mr. G— is come home which obliges me to shorten it and vexes me, tho' I've nothing but nonsense to talk off—I dont like to be interrupted and prevented and I must write to Carry a line as I inclose this to her, I see Almacks begins the 1st Dec. do take a dance there and tell me how it looks it will make but two days difference &amp; I cant bear to prevent you from every thing O dear I am always a teazing you, I think I'm quite provoked at myself, I wish to God I was the only one to suffer in an uncomfortable situation and

I'd bear every thing with pleasure but the thoughts of my dearest Friend being unhappy is ten times more to me than any thing I could ever suffer, indeed my dearest life it is believe me that is my greatest anxiety and concern, I can never make you amends but my sincerest love you shall ever have from the bottom of my soul that you are kind enough to say you value and as long as you esteem it and give me yours it will be our mutual comfort, God bless you my dearest Soul, I'm glad the time is fixed for the Parliament meeting which I hope will bring us to Town Fare∣well a thousand times most sincerely till we meet</P>

thing from you, as you can then act as you think will be best my Maid tells me there has been some of our servants telling her that its all about here that you have been here &amp; she has really told me every particular that you came down with us, and that we met here in the Fields and Lanes, and the day you went away, and that you was at Chester, at Halkin and they knew you there, that you used to have your horses at Ecleston the little Alehouse, that you had a Gentleman with you &amp; a servant, I denyed it &amp; said I wd ac∣quaint my Lord and make every body prove what they had said, Upon which she turned pale looked vastly frighted, and said it was from one person she had heard it &amp; beg'd it might not be mentioned unless she heard more, this makes me hope she made the most of it but yet I fear it has been much talked of by her naming so many particular facts, dont be alarmed my dear Friend, but act as you think proper in regard to your coming down—the worst come to the worst thank God my Lord has told Mr. Gro—r before me we should all be in Town in about a Month—Nothing could make me so unhappy as not to see you, but at the same time we had better not do any thing im∣prudent, and we might possibly not be able to meet but very seldom which when you had taken so much trouble in coming would give me if possible more con∣cern than for you not to come, but consider it well over my Dearest Friend if we can meet with safety nothing could give me so much but <HI>our feelings and our Dangers in this is mutual,</HI> for our meeting imprudent∣ly might endanger our not meeting so often at ano∣ther time, but could it be done safely it would be a pity to loose any of our (too few) opportunities—I was very much frighted at first but by thinking it over am not quite so much alarmed &amp; hope it is not so much talked off as she said— she said that at first they said there was Highwaymen in the reads about and that afterwards a person from Chester knew you &amp; discovered it to every body I hope

<P>YOUR last Letter I must own my dear little Car∣ry makes me very uneasy as I was very plain you was in very low Sperrits, &amp; I'm afraid indeed not well, I am sure I love you too well to risque run∣ning you into any scrape therefore if there is the least Appearance of it I wd not give any Chance of it for the World. the report you know my love is very

false therefore that particular dont make me uneasy as it will be proved to the contrary by seeing we live to∣gether, it was some spiteful person raised it malicious∣ly and very silyly indeed As the whole world must see the contrary, Mama's mentioning it in a serious style to you was very ridiculous as she knows we are living together here &amp; it may be of some use both in regard to her &amp; the World in general as they will se false reports rais'd, if you remember there was exactly the same report raised of Ly Barrymore about the time she was at Bath, the people seeing that false (and I remember myself for one) said we imagined every thing else was so &amp; I assure you my dearest Carry I propose behaving in such a manner as will be quite proper and clever when I come to Town which I hope will be very soon and I shall tell you all my plans when I have the happiness of seeing you—Mama's behaviour to you &amp; speaking to you in that manner I do assure you hurts me much more than any thing in regard to myself; how little Mama's friendship is worth having when she is turned and wound about every different way by a little flattery if she was my friend to day &amp; abused my enemy, if to morrow they falsely told her they lov'd her by way of emposing up∣on her, &amp; getting her to their sides she would still be more inveterate against me than she had been against them—I have been very ill us'd in the World &amp; those that have profess'd themselves my friends have ge∣nerally acted to me in this style, you my Dear Carry have been a real friend, and I shall ever acknowledge it with my last Breath, and ever be sincere to you I only wish it may ever be in my power to serve you I would be happy beyond measure to prove it to you in∣deed I would, I am capable of sincere friendship, I've only my own word for it now, but will prove it with joy and thankfully if fortune will but let me—my poor Friend indeed has taken a most terable Journey and only just seen me twice, they are very prudent &amp; told me the 2d time they should set out immediately for fear of danger, You se by this means my love it

thought of the cold dreadful Journey you have had indeed I've been miserable about you, I'm afraid you are scarcely arrived yet, I've not heard any news at all about you but I've been very low spireted ever since tho I've hid it as much as in my power, I dont know to express my gratitude to you for the constant proofs you give me of the sincerity of your affection, I'm sure all the trouble you have taken only just to se me thoroughly convinces me of it you say all the return you desire is my affection and Friendship in∣deed you have them most sincerely, my heart is al∣ways with you indeed it is my dearest Friend— they came home sunday to dinner he was here a lit∣tle before the rest he came on horseback as he rode part of the way I grew in a fright least as he rode he might have come to shorten the way through the fields &amp; met you, but hoped as he did not arrive till nearish 3 that you was got to where you dined first, to day they are gone to Chester to dinner, and to∣morrow I believe they set out for Wales again for 2 days, I wish we had known it beforehand and may be we might have contrived to have made some use of it but perhaps it may in the end be better as it is, I hope I shall have the happiness of hearing from you &amp; if he is in Wales I shall endeavour to catch my letter be∣fore he comes—I hope C wont make any objecti∣ons to receiving &amp; sending the letters by the means you propose of sending Trusty to her, if she does pray let me know &amp; I'll be sure to find a method of writing to you, &amp; I'll tear my brains to pieces but I'll find some way of hearing once or twice from you while we are here I thank God I dont beleive it will be long for he has been taking to day of setting out &amp; sais he believes he shall go before he at first thought of which was against the meeting of Parliament, as I am in vast hopes he will fix the day soon, &amp; I will immediately write you word when I know, as soon I hear from you and C— and find if I may write again by her I will take the first moment any how if I dont hear to the contrary from C— I'll write
<PB N="37" REF="011898_0019_0F874B3D07434C78"/>
the beginning of next week that if you send on Thursday sevenight it will be at C—y's I shall be sure to find some opportunity as I dare say he will not be long together at home—while I feel it so cold I'm in pain and Misery for you good God in those post Chaises how starving it must be I'm so in fear it shou'd hurt your breast, do take care of your∣self pray my Dear Dear Friend and if you aint quite well pray take some advise, don't take it ill my plaguing you so but really I love you so much I cant help wishing you to take more care of your health.</P>
<P>he seems in a tolerable humour not much one way nor other but still drinks toast &amp; water and very little wine he had a little weazing last night, I suppose dining out to day wont do him much good he sais as the weather is so cold he could get off his business in Wales, but I realy believe he is very glad of any excuse to carry him there as he dont seem to know what to do with himself at home</P>
<P>I do believe &amp; hope there is no suspicions about you, &amp; indeed tho painful I'm sure to both of us I really beleive it was the most prudent thing posible to go before people talked or began to suspect; nothing here has happened worth relating, I've Breakfast'd din'd &amp; sup't gone to bed &amp; rise at the same hour as usual but we rehearst our play in my Room the other night, I fancy it will be done middling well its a most horrid play but they will have it, I must act both the womens characters we are not to have the general Rehearsal in the Playhouse till Monday evening— indeed my dear soul you are very prudent in intend∣ing to go a little in publick before I come to town, it wou'd really look much too particular just to come out then &amp; might cause remarks which possibly might be conveyed to my Ld. &amp; every thing of that sort might rouse him &amp; make him more and more ob∣servant to prevent our Meetings, and the best thing we can possibly do now is to make him believe it is

all over between us, and we have really I beleiv blinded him for some time at least he has no proof about us, &amp; I hope to God that by degrees his suspi∣cions will be lull'd &amp; then we may form some plans for our meeting happily we must not dispair but look forwards that is the only way to support ourselves un∣der our present unhappy situation &amp; there is proba∣bility of many things happening to mend the pre∣sent, so we think like Philosophers &amp; believe every thing is for the best &amp; hope we may enjoy better days soon, &amp; indeed I think it very probable my dear∣est &amp; dear Soul with this idea be happy, if I knew you were so I shou'd be more than half way to it, as I assure you what concerns you is more to me than my own feelings upon any thing. God forbid there should be a Warr if you go what then remains for me but misery, dont lets think on that, no, its wrong, one must not meet misfortunes, but how can I talk so, I'm sure that is not adopting the Style I before proposed to look forward for better times—I shall long to hear from you my dear life, indeed I do, I am afraid you had a miserable Journey indeed, I hope C— will manage our letters as you send, if she wont dont be uneasy I'll certainly contrive some other means to write and to hear from you—I shall write to C— as soon as I've done this &amp; persuade her all I can, I really think no body can suspect any thing as you said—so if you send to her the Thurs∣day after you get this you'll find another from me, I think I have better now conclude and write my letter to C— as I imagine he will come home pretty soon, or I could write to you for ever, indeed my dearest Soul I could tire you to death with my non∣sense—I shall only now add what I have often said to you my Dearest Friend, that you may ever be as∣sured of my tenderest &amp; most sincere affections &amp; that I shall ever remain in the truest sense of the ex∣pression</P>

<P><PB N="42" REF="011898_0022_0F874B3FD87AF7C0"/>After Mr. Wedderburn had read these Letters, which took up very near an hour, he entered into observa∣tions on their contents, as well as the case.</P>
<P>He asked (as the words <HI>mutual feelings</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Letter III. and Letter XII.</NOTE>, and
<Q>I hope I shall never have occasion to <HI>repent</HI> this con∣fidence,</Q>
were mentioned in one of her letters) "What <HI>mutual</HI> feelings should pass between a mar∣ried woman and any other person but her husband? Or, why the word <HI>repent</HI> should be used, if it did not strongly imply a foregone dishonour?" He observ "That it would be given the Jury in evidence that his R— H— had assumed the fictitious name of <HI>Morgan,</HI> a country 'Squire, not very <HI>sound</HI> in his <HI>un∣derstanding</HI>; that he had taken down a servant with him to St. Alban's, who went by the name of <HI>Trusty,</HI> for the purpose of facilitating this amour." He there∣fore asked, "What pain of mind it must cost his R— H—, for one of his elevated station to associate himself for several days with his own servant, pass un∣der a fictitious name, and forego all those honours and distinctions usually paid to his rank, if he had not this dishonourable scheme in pursuit?"</P>
<P>After finishing these observations, which were made with great accuracy and judgment, he told the Jury, "That they had two principal objects for their observation. The first was the very great quality of the defendant, and the second the irreparable injury sustained by the plaintiff. As to the former, he said, no given sum could be punishment sufficient, as the elevated rank and situation of life he sustained, should the more deter him from setting a bad example to the subordinate classes of society." He observed, "There were certain situations in life, that made the same offence more criminal in one than another, on account of the greater duties they may owe the offended party in particular, or society in general. This he in∣stanced in the case of a servant prosecuted for <HI>crim. con.</HI> with his master's wife, when the damages were
<PB N="43" REF="011898_0022_0F874B3FD87AF7C0"/>
laid very considerable, though the offending party had no fortune to bear it; and this he said was done for very wise purposes; to point out to society the great∣er breach of duty in a servant, from whom confidence, respect, and fidelity, were more immediately expect∣ed." He observed, in the present case, tho' the da∣mages may be thought to be laid high, yet, as it was all the punishment the law could inflict, none of it ought to be remitted, as they had it now in their power to convince his R— H— in particular, and every man of rank in general, "That the laws of England in the hands of a BRITISH Jury, are al∣ways superior to situation and connections. He like∣wise hoped, that this would, in future, direct his R. H. to nobler pursuits than the seduction of the wife of a Peer, and incline him to copy from a very near relation of his (meaning his M.) whose conjugal at∣tachments, abstracted from his other virtues, not on∣ly ornamented the throne he filled, but shewed a bright example to his subjects in general."</P>
<P>And now, gentlemen, continued the learned and eloquent Counsel, I shall leave you in possession of these sentiments, and only direct one thing more to your consideration; which is, that you have now be∣fore you the chastity and honour of the sex, the sanc∣tity of marriage, and the custody of British morals, and that your determination will severally operate on each of these."</P>
<P>Several witnesses were then called, the first of whom was,</P>

<P>A clergyman, and chaplain to Lord G. proved the marriage of Lord G. with Miss Harriet V —, on the 19th of July, 1764, it having been solemnized by this witness on that day; proved their having lived happily and well together from that time until the present affair.</P>

<P>Was employed to take care of the Countess of Dunhoff's house, when the family were out of town
<PB N="44" REF="011898_0023_0F874B40C8BC8AB0"/>
—Knew Lady G—. Said that the Countess of Dun∣hoff went out of town in the month of May, 1769, and staid five weeks in the country. That the day the Countess went out of town, Lady G. came in the evening, about seven or eight o'clock, and said her brother would come there that evening, and then La∣dy G. ran up stairs into the drawing-room; in about half an hour after a gentleman came in a chair, with a double knock, the curtains of the chair were drawn very close. He had on a blue great coat,—he got out of the chair, and ran up stairs very quick, he went into the drawing-room, where Lady G. was. The witness did not follow him into the room, but went up about half an hour after, with candles. The lady and gentleman were then sitting on a couch, close to one another. The witness shut up the windows, and left the room. She said they staid till about a quar∣ter past ten o'clock. That it was then about the lat∣ter end of May. That Lady G. went away in her coach. She, this witness, wondered the gentleman did not go away with the lady; but that, soon after he came down stairs, and went away on foot. The gentleman was very fair, with light hair, and large eyes, had a scar on the side of his neck. The very next night after, they came again, both of them, in the same manner as before, and staid pretty much the same time. Lady G. went away alone, and the gen∣tleman soon after. They never did stay later than eleven o'clock any night—That they came there three or four nights one after another, in the same manner. That one evening, as the gentleman was going away, the husband of this witness, a labouring man, happening to be in the hall, and upon her say∣ing that the gentleman was Lady G's brother, her husband made answer, "No, you fool, that he is not, I am sure, for that gentleman is the D. of C." —She said that the couch did remain and continue in the drawing-room at all these several times of their coming.</P>

<P>Servant to the Countess of Dunhoff, in the capa∣city of postilion, had lived with her three years and a quarter.—Remembered to have seen the D. of C. at his lady's house about a year ago, who then asked him to carry a letter to Lady G. and not to tell his own lady of it. He was to take the letter as if it was from the Countess of Dunhoff—which he according∣ly did, and the Duke gave him half a guinea for his trouble—Said he still continued to be servant to the Countess of Dunhoff.</P>

<HEAD>Thomas Denison.</HEAD>
<P>One of Lady G's footmen, remembered about Fe∣bruary, 1769, that he attended his lady to Almack's; that he was ordered to return at eleven o'clock at night; that she then went away in a figured chair to the Countess of Dunhoff's, in Cavendish-square, where he saw the D. of C. come in at that time.—He remembered that in the month of May, 1769, his lady was at Cravenhill, near Paddington, and came
<PB N="46" REF="011898_0024_0F874B41548D6DC8"/>
from thence frequently to the Countess of Dunhoff's. —That he had often attended Lady Grosvenor to St. James's palace, about the latter end of April, or the beginning of May, 1769, where she was set down at the fore-gate, that he had seen her then go cross the court-yard, at St. James's, into the Park, and go in at the D. of C's back door in the Park, attended by the Countess of Dunhoff, and that upon these occa∣sions, which were generally at about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, it was Lady Grosvenor's cus∣tom to discharge the coach, and order it to come again in two hours time; after which she returned through the Park the same way to her coach; that this happened four or five times.—That about the latter end of September, in the same year, he had at∣tended Lady G. to Kensington gardens, where the D. of C. had frequently met her. That in the month of October, in the same year, he attended his lady down into Cheshire. The first night she lay at St. Alban's, the next night at Towcester, the third night at Coventry, the fourth night at the Four Crosses, the fifth night at Whitchurch, and the sixth night at Eden-hall, in Cheshire, the seat of Lord G. That after his Lady's arrival there, he observed she walked out in very dirty weather, and in very dirty fields; that he remembered goins once to deliver a message to her in the fields, and saw her with a man, sitting down or lying down, he could not tell which; that upon seeing him, she suddenly got up and ran to∣wards him; that he did verily believe the man to have been the D. of C. That whilst his lady came towards him to take his message, the man seemed to skulk behind a tree. That on the 21st of December last he attended his lady at St. Alban's, where she was that day, on her return to London. That he, this witness, being already gone to bed, was called up by Mr. Stevens, the butler, who likewise attended Lady G. on her journey to London. That Stevens told him there was a man locked up with their lady in her bedchamber, and that he had called him, this witness
<PB N="47" REF="011898_0024_0F874B41548D6DC8"/>
up, as it was his, Stevens's, intent to break open the door, which he did accordingly effect with an iron po∣ker; that when the door was broke open, he saw the D. of C. standing in the middle of the room, drest, that it was then about eleven o'clock; that Lady G. got to the opposite door, which led to another room; that the D. was buttoning his waistcoat, which had been open.—That Lady G's neck was naked; that her dress was such an one as did button down before, and likewise buttoned at the wrists. That he thinks they call it a jesuit.—The D. upon the discovery being made, stood very much confused, like a statue, and could not speak; that when he did, he said, Gentle∣men, I hope you will not hurt me.—He then attempt∣ed to go out, but Stevens called out, Stop that gen∣tleman. As soon as the D. had got into another room, he said. Take notice, I was not in Lady G's room; to which Stevens made answer, No, you are not now, but you was this minute; to which the Duke replied, He would take his Bible oath he was not in my lady's room. This witness observed the bed to be very much tumbled, but not the bolster; said that he knew the D. very well, that his coat was darkish, his waistcoat of a light colour, that he had a silk handkerchief about his neck, and a dark round wig on, that he had white breeches, and white stockings.</P>

<P>Said that when he saw his lady first in the fields, he was upwards of a hundred yards off; but when he delivered his message, he was not twenty yards off; said that when he attended his lady to Kensington-gar∣dens, Lady Carolina Vernon was usually with her, said that at St. Alban's, the servants of the house were not at the breaking open of the door, but that they did come up soon after and before the bed had been examined.</P>

his lady, in the month of June, 1769, to Carlisle, house, along with Lady Harrington. They staid there about three quarters of an hour, and then came away; remembered to have kept places at Drury-lane, in the month of February, 1769, that the D. of C. came into the box and sat down, and told him he need not stay any longer, for that he, the D. of C. would take care of the place for Lady G. Remem∣bered that in the month of April or May, 1769, his lady and the Countess of Dunhoff went several times in the coach to St. James's palace, and from thence walked through the court-yard into the Park, and so in at the D. of C's back-door, &amp;c. Confirmed the evidence of the last witness as to the St. Alban's af∣fair, with this addition, that he, this witness, put his ear to the key-hole of the door, and could plain∣ly distinguish two voices whispering to each other, upon which Mr. Stevens, and this witness, broke the door open.</P>

That there was one servant with him besides this witness; that he was a groom, and his name John Swan; that they lay at St. Alban's, and went forward next day through Stony-Stratford, lay at Towcester next night; remembered that the Duke's chamber-door was chalk∣ed by him, this witness, and said it was his usual cus∣tom to do so; said that the D. was dressed plain like a country farmer, and this witness in the same man∣ner, and passed for such kind of people, by fictitious names, which he, this witness, gave them of his own accord, without any orders for it from the D. that they came back to London the next morning from Tow∣cester, sat out from thence, about two in the morn∣ing, but returned back in the evening from London

the same road again; that they went on all night, lay at Coventry the next night, and at the Four-Crosses the night after, did not know there was any other company at the inn; that they got to Whit∣church the next night, but at what hour could not tell. The next day at Barnhill, where a family went by, whom they found afterwards to have been Lord G's. They then went to Chester, and from thence to Eden-hall, where his R. H. went to visit Lady G. The next day he went also to visit Lady G. and came back to the Falcon at Chester, where they called each other farmers, and passed as such; did not recollect that he did chalk the door of the Duke's chamber when at the Falcon at Chester. The next day the D. went again to visit Lady G. said that his R. H. never went into Lord G's house at all, nor even into the garden, except on the Saturday, which was the first day, but always saw her on the outside of the garden rails; that they lay on the Monday at Mar∣court-heath, saw Lady G. on Tuesday, lay that night again at Marcourt-heath, and returned to London the next day; that the occasion of their sudden return was, this witness thought that his R. H. was known at Marcourt-heath, and therefore advised him by all means to return to town immediately. Said positively that his R. H. did not at any time go into the house of Lord G. remembered that he received a parcel un∣directed from Lady G. in the month of December, in answer to a similar parcel which he had carried down to her from the D. of C.</P>

He said that at St. Alban's, on the 21st of December he observed a man in a blue coat, who was boring

holes in the door of Lady G's bedchamber, and that he, this witness, acquainted the Duke therewith. That at the time of the breaking open the door, the wit∣ness was in bed, but got up directly, being roused by the noise; that when he came into the bed-chamber, my Lady was gone, and the Duke was not there; that the condition the bed was in was as if <HI>one</HI> person had been <HI>sitting</HI> upon it, and no more; merely the pressure of <HI>sitting</HI> upon it, and no more.</P>

That this witness took an opportunity in the evening to bore two holes in the door of the bed-chamber his lady had made choice of, and stopped them with paper. That he then went down, attended his lady at supper, and carried in a dish of meat to the table; that his lady retired to her chamber before nine o'clock. That he made her a negus, as was his custom, and carried it into the parlour, but finding her gone, he went up stairs with it to her chamber. That she took the negus of him at the chamber-door, and shutting the door, turned the key upon him. He went down and fetched his brother John Stevens, who kept the Wool∣pack at St. Albans, and, returning some time after, he took the paper from the holes in the door, and ap∣plying his ear, very plainly perceived two voices,

one of which he knew to be lady G's, he could not however distinguish any words. That soon after John Andrews, the groom, bringing him word the D. of C. had ordered a chaise to be ready at two o'clock in the morning, he was determined to lose no time, therefore he resolved to break open the door immedi∣ately, and he did so with an iron poker. That the door broke at the hinges, and not at the lock; and the first object he saw was lady G. endeavouring to escape into the next room; in doing so, she fell down; that this witness assisted her to get up. That her ladyship then said, "I suppose you think you have done a very fine thing now." That this wit∣ness answered her, "My lady I am sincerely sorry for the occasion." To which she said, "I am sure you are."

That the D. was asked by this witness, who he was? To which he made no answer. That this witness called in the rest of the servants, who all declared they knew him to be the D. of C. upon which the D. was told, that his person was very secure, and that he might go wherever he pleased.

<P>Several other witnesses were called on in succession, who all corroborated the discovery at St. Alban's, which seemed the principal point aimed at by the plaintiff's counsel.</P>
<P>Mr. Dunning began the defence with observations on the proof, which he said was so far from being positive, that it was not circumstantial; and that if it were admitted upon this occasion, it would open a door for many artifices that might be practised upon the unwary by artful women, in combination with their husbands. After expatiating upon the impro∣priety and danger of allowing such proofs, which he did with great energy, he then produced the follow∣ing exculpatory witnesses.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion to trial">
<P>These witnesses being examined, the Counsel for the Plaintiff gave the reply, which lasted a full hour, and in one part particularly created a great laugh in observing, "That however aggravating the circum∣stances were otherwise, they could not charge his R. H. with intriguing merely for the sake of intrigue, as the <HI>incoherency</HI> of his letters plainly proved him to be really a lover."</P>
<P>Lord Mansfield began about half an hour after six, and, with his usual clearness, summed up the proof
<PB N="58" REF="011898_0030_0F874B47538A49F0"/>
with the utmost strictness and impartiality, and con∣cluded with saying, "That the jury were to consider the damages received, and give an adequate recom∣pence to the person injured, and not give a sum as a punishment upon the person who committed that in∣jury. As in that case, it would become rather a fine, which would be incroaching on the power of the court, in whose breast the inflicting fines alone depends."</P>
<P>His Lordship's speech continued till fifteen minutes before eight, when the jury inclosed till ten minutes before ten, when, of the three complaints, they found the defendant only guilty of one, and then set off in carriages for Bloomsbury-square, with their verdict, finding for the plaintiff TEN THOUSAND POUNDS damages.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of the jury at Lord Mansfield's, in Bloomsbury-square, a number of people, whose curiosity was very great, had collected together round the door; and before the jury had well got into the house, many rushed in with them, Lord Mansfield being acquainted with the arrival of the jury, he came into the hall from his room, by a private door; and being attended by the proper officers of the Court, the usual questions were asked, whether they were agreed in their verdict, and who should speak for them? when he received their verdict, and imme∣diately withdrew. Some of the people, who were nearest the door, after having heard the verdict, com∣municated it to others; and a loud huzza was heard, as approbatory of the jury's conduct.</P>
