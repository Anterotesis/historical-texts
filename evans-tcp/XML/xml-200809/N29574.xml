counsel of God against thy self: Be not a mocker, lest thy bands be made strong, <HI>Isa.</HI> 28.22. When that the Lord heretofore saw the wickedness of man was great, He destroyed the world by a deluge of Water: and Jesus Christ shall shortly be revealed from Heaven in flaming fire, to take ven∣geance on them that obey not the Gospel.

Awake, awake O Arm of the Lord, as in the ancient days: Thou hast promised that the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.25. If the Fa∣ther hath given thee to Christ, thou shalt come to him, and he will in no wise cast thee out; but if he hath appointed thee to wrath, he will let thee alone in thy false peace, because he reserveth thee to the day of Judgment to be punished.

There is no fear of God before thine eyes. Is it not a wonder of mercy, that God should not consume thee in a moment, for thy gross ignorance, and sloth, and stupidity, thy hardness of heart and unbelief, and for thy secret Abomina∣tions?
