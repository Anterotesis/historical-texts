<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the subject here discussed is of sufficient importance to demand serious attention, whether the principle defended be true or false, must be admitted by every competent judge; because of its intimate connec∣tion with the doctrine of justification before God: for that has ever been considered, by our most eminent Protestant writers, both Lutherans and Calvinists, as an article of the greatest moment. Thus, for instance, Dr. JOHN OWEN:
<Q>In my judgment, LUTHER spake the truth when he said, <HI>To lose the article of Justifica∣tion, would at once be the loss of the whole Christian faith.</HI> And I wish he had not been a true prophet, when he foretold that, in the following ages, the doc∣trine hereof would be again obscured <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctrine of Justification. General Considertions,</HI> p. 103. Glas∣gow, 1760. Thus, also, that celebrated foreigner, WITSIUS:
<Q>Diffundit se Justificationis doctrina per totum theologiae corpus, et prout fundamenta hic, vel bene, vel male, jacta sunt, eo uni versum aedisicium vel solidius augustiusque ascendit, vel male statuminatum foedam minitatur ruinam.</Q>

—The leading principle maintained in this Publication, is closely con∣nected
<PB N="iv" REF="031844_0003_0FEF1CC256885368"/>
also, with Christian experience, with devotional practice, and with general obedience to God. The better that principle is understood, and the more its practical influence is felt; the more benign will its genuine tendency appear, with regard to peace of con∣science, and liberty in devotional duties; to the habi∣tual exercise of holy affections, and a course of confor∣mity to the divine commands. It is, by the Author at least, considered in this light.</P>
<P>That prudence and caution are necessary, however, in stating and defending the sentiment here adopted, the Writer presumes, will be acknowledged: because it is a kind of <HI>middle point,</HI> between Arminianism, and Antinomianism—between seeking acceptance with God, <HI>as it were, by the works of the law</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 32.</NOTE>; and renouncing obedience to the divine precepts, as if they had lost their obliging power, or as if our personal obedience were of no importance in any respect. The former of which is pernicious legality; the latter, destructive licen∣tiousness. Whether the Writer have handled the sub∣ject with all that wisdom and care, which its delicacy and importance demand, he dares not assert: but, with sincerity he can declare, that the discussion of it has been attended with much thought, and with frequent prayer.</P>
<P><PB REF="031844_0004_0FEF1CC849D8D408"/>Though the Author detest the <HI>real</HI> principles of what is properly called <HI>Antinomianism;</HI> though, many years ago, in the most public manner, he laboured to explode those pernicious principles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>The Death of Legal Hope, the Life of Evangelical Obedi∣ence,</HI> Sect. VII. Edit. 3d.</NOTE>; and though, in the present Performance, he have endeavoured to guard against being misunderstood; yet he is not without suspicion, that some of his readers will be ready to consider the main position defended, as having a licentious cast. But, should that be the case, he is prepared for it, so as to be neither offended, nor surprised. Nay, while fully persuaded that there is no just ground for such a conclu∣sion, he will consider it as a presumption in favour of the point maintained. Because it is evident, that the doctrine of grace, as preached and recorded by Paul, was treated in a similar manner <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 8, 31. vi. 1, 2, 3, 15. ix. 14—24.</NOTE>. He has long been of opinion, that whoever exhibits the <HI>true glory</HI> of divine grace, and the <HI>high importance</HI> of Christian duty, accord∣ing to the apostolic pattern; will be considered by many as an Antinomian, and by some as an Arminian. Does a minister of the gospel display the absolute freeness, the infinite riches, and the allsufficiency of that grace which is revealed in Jesus Christ, as an immediate ground of encouragement for the vilest of sinners to confide in him? the doctrine will be stigmatized by
<PB N="vi" REF="031844_0005_0FEF1CCB2E9CDC80"/>
multitudes, as manifestly licentious. Does he, as mini∣sterial duty requires, warmly insist, that, be the professed articles of any one's theological creed ever so scriptural; yet, if he be not habitually mindful of the divine precepts; if he keep not the example of Christ in view; if his heart have not an heavenly turn; he is a stranger to the power of evangelical truth, and unworthy to be called a Christian? his preaching will be offensive to the mere formalist; be censured as uncharitable; and reproached, by some, as detestably legal.</P>
<P>The grand principle here defended, is far from being novel; it having been adopted by many Protestant writers of high reputation in the churches of Christ: from some of whom, and especially from Dr. JOHN OWEN, a number of quotations appear in the following work. To the producing of which quotations the Author was induced, partly for the sake of that argument which they contain, in proof of his main point; and partly to evince, that the sentiments here maintained have been espoused by persons of the first eminence, among professed Christians of Calvinistic principles.</P>
<P>That the number of quotations, from the most re∣spectable Calvinistic authors, with regard to the leading position, might have been greatly increased; every one, much acquainted with their theological writings, must acknowledge. Mr. DAVID WILSON, when vindicating

various Writers, denominated POPULAR PREACHERS, against the attacks of gross misrepresentation, of illiberal censure, and of sarcastical contempt; in speaking rela∣tive to the main subject of the following pages, says:
<Q>They [the Popular Preachers] were very ready to acknowledge, that those who are most punctual in the external performance of religious duties, are frequently in a far more dangerous condition than publicans and harlots, or those who lead the most wicked and flagi∣tious lives; because, through the corruption of their own hearts, all their duties, religious services, endea∣vours and attainments, are too often made subservient to the gratification of their pride, and the cherishing of those presumptuous hopes and imaginations whereby they are hardened in their opposition to the true grace of God manifested in the gospel. And they were equally ready to own, that the sovereign mercy of God, with regard to believers at first conversion, does still prevent every good action, motion, or qualifica∣tion in them; every thing that can be supposed to have the least tendency to qualify them for the divine ap∣probation —They affirmed, that the foundation of a sinner's confidence and comfort lies, not in any good works performed by him; in any consciousness of his own sincerity; or any experience of a gracious and sanctifying work of the divine Spirit upon his own soul; but wholly without him, in the promises and testimony of God in the gospel—To maintain, that
<PB N="viii" REF="031844_0007_0FEF1CCFAECB9570"/>
sinners are justified freely, through the righteousness of Christ imputed, and apprehended by faith alone; and yet assert, that no man has a sufficient warrant to rely upon that righteousness alone for justification—as exhi∣bited in the word of the gospel, till he is first conscious of his own godliness and sincerity; is in effect to affirm, that though sinners in general must be justified freely by grace, through the imputed righteousness; yet no sin∣ner in particular ought, or has any warrant to believe, that he is, or ever can be justified in that manner, or without a righteousness of his own; or, at least, some∣thing in and about himself, upon which he may with safety bottom an assurance of the divine favour, and his own justification and salvation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Palaemon's Creed Reviewed and Examined,</HI> Vol. I. p, 195.196. Vol. II. p. 102, 100.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Though the Author be fully persuaded, that a denial of the position maintained, is inconsistent with the ge∣nuine gospel, and with those principles on which every truly pious man proceeds in his prayers, respecting ac∣ceptance with God; yet he is far from concluding, that no one is a real disciple of Christ, who does not expli∣citly avow that position. For he has learned, from experience and observation, that persons will sometimes <HI>dispute</HI> against a particular sentiment, the truth of which is habitually implied in their <HI>prayers,</HI> and its importance
<PB N="ix" REF="031844_0008_0FEF1CD56964D510"/>
tacitly acknowledged in their <HI>own experience.</HI> To this effect is the following language of Dr. OWEN, respecting certain opposers of the doctrine of justification merely by grace, through an imputed righteousness:
<Q>I doubt they oftentimes dispute themselves beyond what they can well abide by, when they return home unto a sedate meditation of the state of things between God and their own souls—I had rather learn what some men really judge about their own justification, from their <HI>prayers,</HI> than their <HI>writings.</HI> Nor do I remember, that I did ever hear any good man in his prayers, use any expressions about justification, pardon of sin, and righteousness before God, wherein any plea, from any thing in ourselves, was introduced, or made use of— Whereas we may, and ought, to represent unto God in our supplications, our faith, or what it is that we believe herein; I much question, whether some men can find in their hearts to <HI>pray</HI> over and plead before him, all the arguments and distinctions they make use of to prove the interest of our works and obedience in our justification before him; or <HI>enter into judgment</HI> with him, upon the conclusions which they make from them —I judge no men upon the expressions that fall from them in polemical writings; wherein, on many occa∣sions, they do affront their own <HI>experience,</HI> and contra∣dict their own <HI>prayers</HI>—To believe the doctrine of [justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ,] or not to believe it, as thus or thus <HI>explained,</HI> is one
<PB N="x" REF="031844_0009_0FEF1CD893DE6530"/>
thing; and to <HI>enjoy</HI> the thing, or <HI>not</HI> enjoy it is another.

<P>That no plausible reasons may be advanced, in oppo∣sition to his main thesis, the Author does not suppose. But, as the writer just quoted observes;

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER any holy disposition in the heart of a sinner be previously necessary to warrant his believing in Jesus Christ? Or, whether, for that purpose, the gospel itself, detached from every consideration of a pre∣paratory sanctifying influence, be completely sufficient? are questions on which the ministers of religion, and the professors of godliness, are greatly divided. The <HI>for∣mer</HI> sentiment is charged, by some, with Arminian legality: the <HI>latter,</HI> by multitudes, with Antinomian licentiousness. <HI>That</HI> is discarded, as fostering phari∣saical pride, as veiling the glory of sovereign grace, and as corrupting the gospel of Jesus Christ. <HI>This</HI> is detested, as encouraging presumptuous hope, as inimical to true virtue, and as averse to Supreme authority, expressing itself in divine law. So opposite are the views of pro∣fessed
<PB N="14" REF="031844_0012_0FEF1CE18887B358"/>
Christians, relative to this momentous article of our enquiry!</P>
<P>After much thought on the subject, I cannot but conclude, however, <HI>That the genuine gospel is a complete warrant for the most ungodly person to believe in Jesus; and that no degree of holiness is necessary for that purpose.</HI> This position, though treated by great numbers as a licentious principle, and as pregnant with dangerous consequences, I consider as a capital article of revealed truth, and as essential to the genuine gospel. I adopt it, as expressing an important fact, in which the perfec∣tion of our Lord's vicarious work, the honour of divine grace, and the peace of distressed consciences, are deeply concerned: to the proof and illustration of which, the following pages are devoted.</P>
<P>To prevent mistakes it is proper to be observed, that, by an <HI>holy disposition</HI> is not meant, a speculative know∣ledge of religious duty; a conviction of spiritual danger; or a desire of immortal happiness: for these, though they accompany, do none of them come under the notion of an holy disposition. These may all exist, more or less, in the minds, the consciences, and the hearts of sinners, without any principle of true sanctity. But, by an holy disposition is intended, a <HI>bias</HI> of the will, a <HI>propensity</HI> of the heart, or a <HI>tendency</HI> of the affec∣tions, in favour of divine authority, and of conformity
<PB N="15" REF="031844_0013_0FEF1CE30DC36448"/>
to the divine image.—By <HI>believing</HI> in Jesus Christ, I do not mean a firm persuasion of his being the promised Messiah, and that the Christian religion is from God, though that persuasion be presupposed; nor a mere assent to any particular proposition, however true, or important; nor yet an assurance of personal interest in Christ, as the only Saviour of sinners: but <HI>relying</HI> upon him as revealed in the doctrine of grace, for pardon, peace, and every spiritual blessing.</P>
<P>Again: The question is not, whether sanctifying influence, and real holiness, be previously necessary to <HI>final felicity?</HI> for that is admitted in its fullest sense. Partly, because <HI>without holiness no one shall see the Lord;</HI> and partly, because without holiness, intellectual hap∣piness is impossible,—Neither is the inquiry, Whether a pious turn of heart be necessary to <HI>communion with God,</HI> in the performance of devotional services? for that com∣munion, on the part of a Christian, is nothing else but the exercise of holy affections toward God, as manifest∣ing himself in Jesus Christ.—Nor, whether an holy ten∣dency in the will be necessary, as an evidence of our <HI>having already</HI> believed in Jesus? for that is cheerfully granted.—Nor, yet, whether a divine influence, attend∣ing evangelical truth, be necessary to a sinner's <HI>believing</HI> in Christ? for that is an important article of the Chris∣tian faith.—But the question to be discussed, is; <HI>Whe∣ther the Gospel itself be a complete warrant for the most
<PB N="16" REF="031844_0014_0FEF1CB9898A5260"/>
ungodly person to believe in Jesus, without any holy dispo∣sition being necessary for that purpose?</HI></P>
<P>By the term <HI>gospel</HI> I here intend, <HI>the doctrine of sal∣vation by grace, through Jesus Christ:</HI> which doctrine is, in the most emphatical sense, <HI>good news,</HI> or <HI>glad tidings;</HI> agreeable to the natural import of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as used by the Evangelists and Apostles. Relative to which particular, I will here introduce a few extracts from Dr. GEORGE CAMPBELL. Thus, that learned Author:
<Q>This term, (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) agree∣ably to its etymology, from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>bene</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>nuncium,</HI> always in classical use, where it occurs but rarely, denotes either <HI>good news,</HI> or the <HI>reward</HI> given to the bearer of good news—The Greek verb <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, when first used by the Evangelists,—conveyed to their coun∣trymen only one and the same idea, which is precisely what the phrase <HI>to bring good tidings</HI> conveys to us. The appropriation of the word to the religious insti∣tution called the gospel, is of later date, and has gradu∣ally arisen out of the former usage. When etymology and use perfectly coincide, we cannot be too literal in our interpretations; when they differ, which does not seldom happen, the latter is to be followed, and not the former—The first meaning of the word (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) then in the New Testament, especially in the Gospels, is, as has been observed, <HI>good news</HI>; a signification which, though always implied, is not always what is
<PB N="17" REF="031844_0015_0FEF1CEBEE64C138"/>
chiefly intended: and therefore the word cannot, without a sacrifice of propriety, be uniformly so ren∣dered. The name, from being expressive of an eminent quality in the dispensation introduced by the Messiah, and from being most frequently applied to it, came gradually to serve as a name for the dispensation itself. When it is thus employed, it is in our tongue properly rendered <HI>gospel</HI>—This [literal and primitive] sense ought to be retained in the version, when the word, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is construed with a noun serving to limit or explain its nature; as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>the good news of peace;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>the good news of the reign.</HI> It was observed, on the explanation of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that the Christian economy was foretold under the denomination of <HI>the reign of God,</HI> and <HI>the reign of Heaven;</HI> and I may add, in the typical lan∣guage of the Psalms, <HI>the reign of David</HI>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is <HI>the good news of the favour of God:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>the good news of your salvation.</HI> The words in the common version, <HI>the gospel of your salvation,</HI> are mere words, and con∣vey no meaning to English ears. The word always <HI>may,</HI> and commonly <HI>should,</HI> be rendered <HI>good news,</HI> and not <HI>gospel,</HI>—when it is construed with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, I <HI>proclaim</HI> or publish—(The word) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, rendered <HI>to preach,</HI> is derived from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, rendered <HI>preacher;</HI> whence also <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, rendered <HI>a preaching.</HI> The pri∣mitive <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies properly both <HI>herald</HI> and <HI>common

writers! all which unite in the general notion of JOY¦FUL NEWS.</P>
<P>Let us now see how an ancient ecclesiastical author describes it. Thus CHRYSOSTOM speaks, as quoted and translated by Mr. HERVEY.
<Q>The gospel compre∣hends, a discharge from punishment; a remission of sins; the gift of righteousness; the endowment of sanctifica∣tion; redemption from every evil; the adoption of sons; the inheritance of heaven; and a most endeared, a con∣jugal relation to the infinitely majestic Son of God. All these divinely precious privileges preached, pre∣sented, vouchsafed, to the foolish, to the disobedient, to enemies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Theron and Aspasio,</HI> Vol. III. p. 321. Edit. 5th.</NOTE>.</Q>
—'The <HI>gospel,</HI>' says LUTHER,
<Q>is the doctrine concerning the incarnate Son of God, who was given to us, without our deserts, for peace and salvation. It is the word of salvation, the word of grace, the word of comfort, and the word of joy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Loci Communes,</HI> Class II. Loc. xiv. p. 69. Londini, 1651.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The gospel, then, properly and strictly so called, is the doctrine of <HI>divine grace.</HI> As such, it is contradistin∣guished to the precepts and prohibitions of divine law, which are the doctrine of <HI>human duty.</HI> But, relative to this distinction, and the contrasted light in which the law and the gospel are placed by it, the following quo∣tation from WITSIUS may not be improper. Thus that
<PB N="21" REF="031844_0019_0FEF1CF6985589B8"/>
eminent writer:
<Q>The <HI>law,</HI> here, denotes that part of the divine Word which consists of precepts and pro∣hibitions; with the promise of a reward to be conferred on those who obey, and a threatening of punishment on the disobedient. The <HI>gospel</HI> signifies the doctrine of grace, and of complete salvation in Jesus Christ, which elect sinners shall receive by faith. Every pre∣scription, therefore, of virtues and of duties; all exhor∣tations and dehortations; all reproofs and threatenings; all promises, likewise, of reward to perfect obedience, belong to the <HI>law.</HI> To the <HI>gospel</HI> pertains every thing that can minister hope of salvation to sinful man: that is, the doctrine of the Person, the offices, the states, the benefits of Jesus Christ; and all promises to which are annexed the pardon of sin, and the possession of grace and of glory, to be obtained by faith in Christ. This is the most strict notion of each word; to which, through the whole of this disputation, regard must be paid—If we understand the word <HI>gospel</HI> strictly, as it is the <HI>formula</HI> of the Testament of Grace, which con∣sists of mere promises, or an absolute exhibition of sal∣vation in Christ; then, properly speaking, it prescribes nothing as duty; requires nothing; commands nothing: no, not even <HI>believe, trust, hope in the Lord,</HI> and such like. But it reports, declares, and signifies to us, what God in Christ promises; what he will do, and is about to perform. All prescription of duty belongs to the <HI>law;</HI> as, after others, the venerable VOETIUS has
<PB N="22" REF="031844_0020_0FEF1CF82922D2A0"/>
excellently well proved. This must by all means be held, if, with all the Reformed, we would steadily defend the perfection of the law, as including all vir∣tues, and all the duties of holiness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Animadvers. Iren.</HI> C. xv. § 1, 9.</NOTE>.</Q>
—This distinc∣tion between the <HI>law</HI> and the <HI>gospel,</HI> strictly understood, appearing to be both just and important, is regarded in the following pages.</P>
<P>Still further, however, to confirm and illustrate the necessity of keeping this distinction in view, it may be observed; that the <HI>law</HI> of God originated in his relation to men, as moral agents; and in his necessary dominion over them, of which it is a natural expression: but the <HI>gospel,</HI> in his royal, supreme prerogative; it being the result of his mere, sovereign pleasure. The <HI>former</HI> considers them as rational creatures that are bound to obey: the <HI>latter,</HI> as guilty creatures, who deserve to suffer. The precepts of divine <HI>law</HI> are the language of stern autho∣rity: the doctrines of the <HI>gospel</HI> are the voice of conde∣scending mercy. In <HI>that,</HI> justice unsheaths the sword, and demands vengeance: in <HI>this,</HI> mercy exhibits pardon, and proclaims peace. Divine <HI>law,</HI> is the awful <HI>ministra∣tion of death</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 7.</NOTE>, as the desert of sin: the everlasting <HI>gos∣pel</HI> is the good news of life, as the effect of boundless grace. <HI>That,</HI> by a righteous charge of guilt, and of deserved ruin, <HI>stops the mouth</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 19.</NOTE>: <HI>this,</HI> by proclaiming a
<PB N="23" REF="031844_0021_0FEF1CFC765C13A0"/>
free pardon, opens the lips in gratitude and praise. God, in the <HI>law,</HI> addresses men agreeably to their per∣sonal deserts, their character, and their state: in the <HI>gospel,</HI> according to the riches of his own grace, the diversity of their spiritual wants, and the vicarious work of Jesus Christ. In divine <HI>law,</HI> the Most High exhi∣bits himself, as invested with absolute dominion, as flaming with eternal purity, and as unchangeably abhor∣rent of moral evil: in the <HI>gospel,</HI> as <HI>condemning sin in the flesh</HI> of his own incarnate Son <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 3.</NOTE>; as <HI>pardoning iniquity,</HI> in its greatly diversified forms; as <HI>justifying the ungodly;</HI> as <HI>the</HI> JUST <HI>God and the</HI> SAVIOUR <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7. Rom. iv. 5. Isaiah xiv. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that, in addressing sinners, respecting their immortal concerns, neither the announcing of dan∣ger, nor the enforcing of duty, is publishing the <HI>gospel,</HI> properly so called. Because it is admitted by all, who are conversant in these things, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>gospel,</HI> denotes <HI>glad tidings.</HI> Such is its natural and proper, its delightful and emphatical meaning. It is most com∣monly employed, in the New Testament, with an imme∣diate reference to the grace of God, and the work of Christ, as they appear in the salvation of sinners. Very seldom is it used by the Apostles, to denote the Christian system <HI>at large</HI>; but, with a few exceptions, in its grand,
<PB N="24" REF="031844_0022_0FEF1D00E54A91E0"/>
appropriate, and emphatical sense, for that part of revealed truth which respects the blessings of salvation, by mere grace, through Jesus Christ. Preaching the <HI>gospel,</HI> therefore, is proclaiming <HI>glad tidings</HI> of salvation for the guilty, the unworthy, and the perishing.</P>
<P>Now, the terms <HI>law, precepts, commands, exhortations, threatenings,</HI> and others of a similar kind, are expressions of an extremely different meaning, from that of the word <HI>gospel.</HI> To assert, therefore, the authority of God in his laws, whether moral or positive; to describe the awful situation of unregenerate sinners? to warn them of their extreme danger; to inculcate, for suitable pur∣poses, an impartial regard to all the divine precepts; and to insist, that an habitual want of obedience to the known commands of Christ, leaves a person destitute of evidence that he either loves him, or believes in him; though of <HI>essential importance,</HI> in the course of a public ministry, ought never to be considered, strictly speaking, as preaching <HI>the gospel.</HI> It may be all true; it may be all proper; it may be all necessary in its place; and yet, not having the nature of <HI>glad tidings</HI> in it, be very different from the gospel.</P>
<P>The word <HI>gospel,</HI> having long been commonly used without any determinate meaning; except, either a denoting the Christian system, or some doctrine, or precept, pertaining to Christianity; and having become, by modern use, a kind of technical term in divinity; is
<PB N="25" REF="031844_0023_0FEF1D027617AFD0"/>
applied, in the most promiscuous manner, to all sorts of religious doctrine, that are considered by their abettorn as warranted in the sacred writings. The public minister, and the private professor, whatever their theological creed may be; are equally pleased with concluding, that the one preaches, and the other hears, the <HI>gospel:</HI> though, frequently, neither of them have any fixed or distinct notion under the term; and even though their views of Christianity render it nearly akin to Deism. It were to be wished, therefore, either that, instead of the old Saxon word <HI>gospel,</HI> the expressions <HI>glad tidings</HI> had been used in our vulgar translation of the New Testa∣ment; or that the former term were universally under∣stood in its original sense, as denoting <HI>good news.</HI> For, were that the case, it is highly probable, there would be more knowledge, and less of self-deception; relative to this momentous affair.</P>

<P>This testimony of God, respecting the gracious <HI>characters</HI> which Christ bears; the merciful <HI>design</HI> of his appearance in the world; the <HI>state</HI> of those whom he came to save; and the <HI>work</HI> which he performed for that purpose; very strongly encourages the guilty, the ungodly, and the altogether unworthy, to believe in Jesus. For, as it is manifest that he did not assume his condescending and mediatorial characters, come into the world, and expire on a cross, to save the innocent, or the righteous, but <HI>sinners</HI>—the <HI>ungodly</HI>—the <HI>justly accursed</HI>; so individuals of that description must be the <HI>only</HI> persons with whom, as a Saviour from eternal ruin, he has any concern.</P>

<P>Who, now, that maturely considers these infallible attestations to the dignity of our Lord's Person, the perfection of his obedience, the depth of his penal sufferings, the vicarious nature of his whole work, and the exuberance of divine grace; can doubt the suffici∣ency, either of Christ or of grace, to save the most vile and miserable of men?

<P>What a wonderful exhibition is here, of sovereign, free, and all sufficient mercy! It extends to the most carnal and covetous, the most ungrateful and worthless of men. It precedes every good motion of their wills,
<PB N="33" REF="031844_0030_0FEF1D18D57B0DD0"/>
and every virtuous affection of their hearts. It waits, neither for any reformation of exterior conduct, nor the least melioration of internal character. It finds them under the power of strong disaffection to God, and with the gain of extortion in their iniquitous hands. Fraught with every spiritual blessing for those who deserve to perish, it pardons their crimson crimes, and softens their obdurate hearts. It gives a new turn to their wills, and elevates their affections to holy objects. It fills them with spiritual comfort, directs their feet into the way of righteousness, and makes them new creatures. Such divinely gracious declarations, and well authenticated facts, must, therefore, warrant the most ungodly person to regard this unparalleled mercy, and to believe in Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>With what an air of supreme authority, and of abso∣lute dominion, does THE ETERNAL here speak! He manifestly considers himself as acting quite in character, when exercising, or withholding mercy, according to his own sovereign pleasure. He neither does, nor can, consider himself as a debtor to any man. The whole of our species, being immersed in guilt, and obnoxious to ruin, equally lie at divine mercy, for all their happiness and all their hope.—But, while maintaining the dignity of his character, and the supremacy of his own will, in the bestowment of spiritual blessings on guilty creatures; he reveals his goodness in the most encouraging manner: which goodness, expressed under the different notions of <HI>love,</HI> of <HI>mercy,</HI> and of <HI>grace,</HI> he represents as an <HI>essential part</HI> of that divine glory which, to the ancient Jewish church, was denoted by the sublimest of all names, JEHOVAH.

<P>So numerous are our offences, and so violent our provocations, that, were not the blessed God equally superior to us in goodness, as he is in power; and in pardoning mercy, as he is in wisdom; we could not have the least ground of hope. Among men, when a breach of private friendship has taken place, the aggres∣sor, being conscious of the injury which he has done, is commonly very backward to admit, that the aggrieved party has any benevolence for him. Thus it is with sinners, when their consciences are awakened, in regard to God. Extremely backward they are to admit, that <HI>there is forgiveness with God,</HI> for such aggravated
<PB N="38" REF="031844_0035_0FEF1D26535DEE78"/>
crimes as theirs. To relieve the distressed soul, by obvi∣ating this very common and pressing difficulty, the Great Sovereign condescends, in the passages before us, tacitly to admit, that, were he like us, neither pardon∣ing nor sparing mercy would ever be exercised toward any of Adam's offspring. But <HI>he is</HI> GOD, <HI>and not</HI> MAN. His <HI>thoughts,</HI> relative to pardoning mercy, <HI>are not our thoughts;</HI> nor his <HI>ways,</HI> respecting that important affair, like <HI>our ways.</HI> Offences, comparable to a debt of only <HI>fifty pence,</HI> are often with difficulty forgiven by us; while he, through the blood of atonement, freely obli∣terates a debt of <HI>ten thousand talents.</HI> Among mortals, it is an instance of love extremely rare, that any one should lay down his life, even for <HI>a good man,</HI> or a public benefactor; but God <HI>recommends his love to us, in that, while we were yet sinners,</HI> and his enemies, he sent his own Son <HI>to die for us.</HI> Far from regulating the manifestations of his compassion, according to the puny instances of human kindness; he not only blesses, but astonishes, by the displays of his matchless favour to sinners.—Yes, <HI>God is</HI> LOVE; and, therefore, he <HI>delighteth in mercy.</HI> What, then, could be more encou∣raging; or what, by necessary consequence, could more strongly authorise, a guilty, ungodly, perishing wretch, to rely on the Lord Jesus, in whom this boundless mercy is manifested?</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="031844_0036_0FEF1D295B042B10"/>On this delightful and important subject, Dr. OWEN expresses himself as follows:
<Q>This <HI>forgiveness that is with God,</HI> is such as becomes him; such as is suitable to his greatness, goodness, and all other excellencies of his nature; such as that therein he will be <HI>known to be</HI> GOD. What he says concerning some of the works of his Providence, <HI>be still, and know that I am</HI> GOD; may be much more said concerning this great effect of his grace; <HI>Still your souls, and know that he is</HI> GOD. It is not like that narrow, difficult, halving, and manacled forgiveness that is found among men, when any such thing is found amongst them. But it is full, free, bottomless, boundless, absolute; such as becomes his nature and excellencies. It is, in a word, <HI>forgiveness that is with</HI> GOD, and by the exercise whereof he will be known so to be—God himself doth really separate and distinguish <HI>his</HI> forgiveness from any thing that our thoughts and imaginations can reach unto; and that because it is <HI>his,</HI> and like <HI>himself.</HI> It is an object for <HI>faith</HI> alone; which can rest in that which it cannot comprehend. It is never safer, than when it is, as it were, overwhelmed with <HI>infiniteness</HI>— Were not forgiveness in God somewhat beyond what men could imagine, no flesh could be saved. This himself expresseth, Isaiah lv. 7, 8, 9. They are, as is plain in the context, <HI>thoughts of forgiveness,</HI> and <HI>ways of pardon,</HI> whereof he speaks. These, our apprehensions come short of: we know little, or nothing, of the
<PB N="40" REF="031844_0037_0FEF1D2D9B7AD5F8"/>
<HI>infinite largeness of his heart</HI> in this matter. He that he speaks of, is an <HI>impiously wicked man,</HI> and <HI>a man of deceit,</HI> and perverse wickedness. He whose design and course is nothing but a lie, sin, and iniquity. Such an one as we would have little or no hopes of; that we would scarce think it worth our while to deal withal about a hopeless conversion; or can scarce find in our hearts <HI>to pray for him</HI>; but are ready to give him up, as one profligate and desparate. But let him turn to the Lord, and he shall obtain <HI>forgiveness.</HI> But how can this be? Is it possible there can be mercy for such an one? Yes; for the Lord <HI>will multiply to pardon.</HI> He hath forgiveness with him to outdo all the multiplied sins of any that turn unto him, and seek for it. But this is very hard, very difficult for us to apprehend. This is not the way and manner of men: we deal not thus with profligate offenders against us. True, saith God: but <HI>your ways are not my ways.</HI> I do not act in this manner like unto you; nor as you are accustomed to do—For the most part, when we come to deal with God about forgiveness, we hang in every briar of disputing, quarrelsome unbelief. This or that circumstance, or aggravation; this or that unpa∣ralleled particular, bereaves us of our confidence. Want of due consideration of Him with whom we have to do, measuring Him by that line of our own imaginations, bringing Him down to <HI>our thoughts</HI> and <HI>our ways,</HI> is the cause of all our disquietments.

Our satisfaction in this matter, is to be taken from his <HI>nature.</HI> Were He a <HI>man,</HI> or as the sons of men, it were impossible that, upon such and so many provoca∣tions, he should turn away from the fierceness of his anger.

<P>Thus Mr. CHARNOCK, with reference to this parti∣cular:
<Q>That fear that Adam had, when, frighted at the voice of God, he hid himself among the trees of the garden, hath remained in part with his posterity, when they reflect upon their crimes. We measure the nature of God by the qualities of our own; and because we are not forward to remit men's offences against us, we are apt to imagine that God hath not clemency enough to pardon the faults committed against him. Hence it is that persons, deeply hum∣bled under a sense of the curses of the law, are ready to lick up the dust under the feet of Christ, and behold∣ing

an absolute necessity of him, are with much ado brought to believe. Though the design of God in setting out Christ for a propitiation be declared to them, the sufficiency of his merit, the acceptation of it by God, the fruits others have found of it, that the design of Christ's coming was to ease those in that condition; yet they are hardly induced to lay aside those jealousies they have of God—When men are soundly convinced of the nature and evil of sin, they become vile in their own eyes. Their sin galls them; the law terrifies them; the notions of God's justice are awakened in them, and lie close to them. They are sensible of the degenerateness and rebellion of their nature: they think God cannot but hate them, and they expect from him only the severity of a judge: and when evangelical mercy is declared, it seems incre∣dible to them, because it exceeds their nature and dis∣positions. The greatness of the mercy proffered makes them stagger: they believe not God to be so merciful, because they cannot be so; (for in all conditions of men, it is natural to limit God according to their own petty dimensions; and not elevate their thoughts to his, but judge of his thoughts by theirs:) and although his mercy is above the mercy of a creature, we are apt to think his nature as incapable of a largeness as our own. Since man has become vain in his imaginations, he is apt to measure divine things according to those principles which are in his own fancy. Hence God

<P>What an admirable description of divine, paternal mercy; and how agreeable to the gracious import of those delightful passages that were last reviewed! The parable which contains this exquisitely tender and charming representation of pardoning mercy and free acceptance, was designed by our Lord to vindicate his own conduct against the objections of scribes and Phari∣sees; to rebuke the pride of selfrighteous confidence;
<PB N="50" REF="031844_0047_0FEF1D49D64439D0"/>
to encourage persons of the most profligate characters to apply for mercy; and to assure them that, in so doing, they shall not be disappointed. <HI>Disappointed!</HI> no: for, be their transgressions ever so many, or their demerits ever so great, our Lord represents the divine Father, as compassionately meeting each profligate upon his return; as embracing him, with parental affection; as passing an act of oblivion upon all his enormous offences; as investing him with the robe of righteousness; as adorning him with the beauties of holiness; and as admitting him into the celestial family: all which is done, without one unbraiding word, and with supreme delight.—The Prodigal came, says Mr. HERVEY,
<Q>with no recommendation, either of dress, of person, or of character. None but his nakedness, his misery, and an acknowledgement of vileness; which had every aggravating, not one extenuating circumstance.

<P>It is hence apparent, that God, in the bestowment of blessings on the children of men, is not influenced by the purity of their hearts, the piety of their lives, or the worthiness of their characters; but by a regard to his own eternal perfection; to the supreme excellence of his own revealed Name; and to the everlasting honour of his own immense goodness. No: the blessings of salvation, on whomsoever conferred, are never to be considered as distinguishing worth, and rewarding merit; but as designed to display the riches of divine mercy, and the glory of the divine character, by relieving the wretched, and saving the unworthy.—Now, the Divine Majesty having revealed himself as exercising mercy, and granting spiritual blessings, for his <HI>own sake;</HI> the polluted, ungodly, and perishing sinner is completely warranted to rely on that mercy, as manifested in the atonement, for pardon, acceptance, and peace, inde∣pendent of every other consideration. This perfectly suits, not only the apostate state of man, but the peerless majesty of God. For as he is possessed of boundless Being; as all creatures received their existence from
<PB N="53" REF="031844_0050_0FEF1D545DBBF428"/>
his power, and are entirely dependent on his pleasure; and as the sum total of all created existence is but an atom, in comparison with him; so he acts perfectly agreeable to his own character, in making himself the ultimate end of his whole conduct, and in all things consulting his own glory.</P>
<P>The passages here produced, being all extracted from the Old Testament, are quite suitable to that revelation which God made of himself under the Jewish Oeconomy; and to the import of his name JEHOVAH, by which he made himself known to the chosen tribes. For that Name was, in a peculiar manner, <HI>his</HI> OWN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. vi. 2, 3. Psalm lxxxiii. 18.</NOTE>: by which he was distinguished, as the only Object of Israel's wor∣ship and as their King, from all the Deities and Sove∣reigns of the ancient Heathens. This most August Name, together with its glorious import, he pro∣claimed to Moses in the most solemn and command∣ing manner <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxiii. 18, 19. xxxiv. 5—8.</NOTE>: to which Name, and its comprehensive significancy, reference is apparently had in many of the texts just adduced. Moses, on a very sorrowful occasion, regarded it, as affording the most powerful plea with God, on the behalf of Israel, when they had greatly offended, and were threatened with extermination <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Numb. xiv. 17—20.</NOTE>. Joshua, too, has recourse to the same sublime Character, in pleading

the cause of Israel at his Maker's footstool, when they were under the tokens of divine anger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Josh. vii. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. The sacred import of this Name was, to the ancient saints, like <HI>a strong tower</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Prov. xviii. 10.</NOTE>, or an impregnable fortress, for the encouragement and confidence which they derived from it. Really to understand the fruitful significancy of it, was always attended with confidence in the God of Israel. For it is written, <HI>They that know thy Name will put their trust in thee</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ps. ix. 10.</NOTE>.—Now, if the revealed character of God, under the Old Oeconomy, was preg∣nant with encouragement for miserable sinners to rely on his mercy for pardon and salvation; it cannot be supposed that evangelical truth, under the Christian system, is less favourable to the cause of human hope.— Relative to the name JEHOVAH, Dr. OWEN says:
<Q>To be known by <HI>this</HI> Name; to be honoured, feared, believed as that declares him, is the <HI>great glory of God.</HI> And shall this fail us?

<P>How admirably adapted is the Oeconomy of Redemption to our apostate state! Are we miserable? God is mer∣ciful. Are we unworthy? God is gracious. Are we, to the last degree, impoverished? God is immensely bountiful. The spiritual blessings which he confers, are <HI>absolutely free gifts:</HI> and gifts, we know, are not pur∣chased, but bestowed: not obtained upon conditions to be performed, but received as matter of mere favour. The blessings of divine grace were not intended to recog∣nise moral worth, but to relieve the indigent; not designed to indicate holy qualities in the receiver, but to display generosity in the giver.—When we reflect on
<PB N="56" REF="031844_0053_0FEF1D5EC177CF08"/>
the personal dignity of Christ, as <HI>the Son of God;</HI> on the unchangeable interest he had in his Father's love; and on the Father delivering him up to an execrable death for mere sinners; we cease to wonder that, with Him, he freely bestows all spiritual blessings, without any regard to worthiness in them on whom they are conferred. Because the gift of Christ himself is the <HI>grand</HI> evidence of God's love to sinners; incomparably greater than that of authorising the ungodly to believe in Jesus, or than that of his giving heaven to saints.</P>

<P>This opposition between divine mercy, and human works; the grace of God, and the worthiness of man; is very observable, and extremely important. For the contrasted view that is here given of these particulars, is far from being an incidental thing. We do not find it, in the Apostolic Writings, once or twice only; and that with reference to articles of comparatively small consequence; but, in <HI>many</HI> places, in an <HI>argumentative</HI> manner, and relative to blessings of the <HI>highest</HI> moment. The sentiment, therefore, which is conveyed by this contrasted form of expression, is to be considered as a <HI>grand principle</HI> of the apostolic doctrine; and this mode of speaking, as the current language of Inspiration, relative to those capital blessings, election, conversion, pardon, and justification.</P>
<P>Now, respecting the objects of God's eternal choice, their conversion to Christ, their complete forgiveness, and
<PB N="58" REF="031844_0055_0FEF1D61DB0EC9D0"/>
their perfect acceptance with the Most Holy; the reasonings of Paul, where this kind of language is used, plainly show, that his design was entirely to exclude, not only all <HI>merit</HI> strictly so called, but all <HI>comparative</HI> worthiness. Yes, he intended to prove, that God, in the bestow∣ment of these blessings, has not the least regard to per∣sonal holiness, or moral worth, in the favoured objects of his kindness; but considers them as equally unworthy with those who finally perish. Nay, in the last of these instructive passages the Apostle proves, professedly and in a formal manner, that <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>works,</HI> or divine favour and comparative human worthiness, are so oppo∣site one to another, that it is impossible for them to con∣cur in procuring the same blessings. So that whosoever considers himself as distinguished from others, by virtuous habits or pious performances, and thence derives encou∣ragement to look for acceptance with God through the imputed righteousness of Christ, confounds the most opposite ideas relating to an affair of the highest moment; rejects the determination of Paul; and must be misera∣bly disappointed.—I said, COMPARATIVE <HI>human wor∣thiness:</HI> for that is all which the nature of the case admits. Because <HI>worthiness</HI> of divine blessings, in a strict, legal, absolute sense, and especially as to <HI>apostate</HI> creatures, is impossible. Consequently, the gospel, in which this contrast between grace and works is thus frequently formed, must be considered as authorising the ungodly to believe in Jesus.</P>

<P>That divine fidelity is here pledged, for the ever∣lasting security of all who really believe in Jesus, will not be disputed by those that maturely consider the gracious declarations, and revere the sacred Writings. It is equally clear, that these passages exhibit the Lord Redeemer as free for miserable sinners, of every nation, and of every character, to whom the glad tidings come. For the language is not, He that is <HI>disposed to keep</HI> the divine commands—He that has <HI>performed conditions</HI>— Whoever is <HI>comparatively worthy</HI>—and believeth in Christ: but, <HI>He that believeth—Whosoever believeth.</HI> Consequently, this exhibition of Christ, and that assu∣rance of complete salvation to all that believe in him, attest the fact for which I contend.</P>

<P>That these instances of saving mercy were entered on divine record, as <HI>acts</HI> and <HI>precedents</HI> of the Court of Heaven; and, under that very notion, are to be regarded by sinners in all future ages, the texts themselves inform us. Now, as these authenticated facts display the riches of reigning grace, in saving some of the most abominable characters that ever lived; and as these instances of superabounding, sovereign mercy to profligate, impious wretches, were intended by Jesus Christ as a <HI>pattern</HI> of his own procedure in following times; they must be considered as warranting the most detestably vile to

believe in our Almighty Saviour. For it is not easy to conceive of more flagitious characters, than some of those that are here specified. Yet they were encouraged to believe in Jesus. On him they relied, and were not disappointed.—Did but those profligates who, by a course of enormous offences, are sunk into a kind of hardened despair, understand the design of these acts and precedents, they would no longer say, with some in the Prophet, <HI>There is no hope: no; for we have loved strangers, and after them will we go</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii. 25.</NOTE>.

On this ground, therefore, we may safely conclude, that the numerous particular instances of divine forgiveness, which stand recorded in holy Scripture, were intended to encourage hope in the guilty breast, and to produce reformation in the profligate life.

But, in proportion as the forgiveness of our sins, and the acceptance of our persons, are considered as depending on conditions performed, or on qualifications obtained, by us; there is reason of joy in our own exertions and worthiness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 9.</NOTE>: which is diametrically contrary to the apostolic doctrine of salva∣tion by grace <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 27. 1 Cor. iv. 7.

<P><HI>The eternal design of God, in the work of salvation by Jesus Christ, was to manifest, exalt, and for ever to glorify his own grace, in rendering the unworthy everlastingly happy.</HI>

<P>As, in that most wonderful of all works, REDEMP∣TION, the design of God was to manifest, illustrate, glorify, his own grace; as the glad tidings of salvation by Jesus Christ reveal that grace, in connection with its design; and as no doctrine deserves the name of <HI>gospel,</HI> which does not exhibit the grace of God, as abounding, reigning, glorious—worthy of everlasting admiration and praise; the genuine gospel must be considered as encouraging, inviting, warranting, the most ungodly to believe in Jesus. For divine grace, in election, redemp∣tion, regeneration, and justification, has no concern with any besides the absolutely unworthy. To this its very nature, and the design of God in dispensing the blessings proceeding from it, are completely adapted. <HI>Its very nature.</HI> For it is not merely <HI>grace,</HI> though as such it must be sovereign; but it is grace with a GLORY around it—<HI>The</HI> GLORY <HI>of his grace,</HI> is the language of Paul. Now, an essential part of its most shining, illustrious, glorious qualities must consist, in its being <HI>absolutely</HI> free, and <HI>infinitely</HI> rich. The former, as to its <HI>objects</HI>; the
<PB N="68" REF="031844_0065_0FEF1D80E06A66A0"/>
latter, as to its <HI>benefits:</HI> and both, as providing for the altogether vile. <HI>The design of God in dispensing the bles∣sings proceeding from it.</HI> This was, we are here expressly informed, not, <HI>ultimately,</HI> our happiness, though that be a great design; much less the rewarding of human worth; but <HI>his own</HI> PRAISE—<HI>the praise of his own</HI> GLORY—and <HI>the praise of the glory of his</HI> GRACE.</P>
<P>'If there be any pardon with God,' says Dr. OWEN,
<Q>it is such as becomes him to give. When he pardons, he will <HI>abundantly pardon.</HI> Go with your <HI>half</HI>-forgive∣ness, limited, conditional pardons, with reserves and limitations unto the sons of men: it may be, it may become them; it is like themselves. That of God is absolute and perfect; before which our sins are as a cloud before the East wind, and the rising sun. Hence he is said to do this work, with his <HI>whole heart</HI> and with his <HI>whole soul</HI>—This forgiveness is in or with God, not only so as that we may apply ourselves unto it, if we will, for which he will not be offended with us; but so, also, as that he hath placed his <HI>great glory</HI> in the declaration and communication of it: nor can we honour him more, than by coming to him to be made partakers of it, and so to receive it from him. For the most part, we are, as it were, ready, rather to <HI>steal</HI> forgiveness from God, than to receive from him, as one that gives it freely and largely. We take it up, and lay it down, as though we would be
<PB N="69" REF="031844_0066_0FEF1D86959A9808"/>
glad to have it, so God did not, as it were, <HI>see</HI> us take it: for we are afraid he is not <HI>willing</HI> we should have it indeed. We would steal this fire from heaven, and have a share in God's treasures and riches, almost without his consent. At least, we think we have it from him <HI>aegre,</HI> with much difficulty; that it is rarely given, and scarcely obtained. That he gives it out with a kind of <HI>unwilling willingness</HI>; as we sometimes give alms without cheerfulness: and that he looseth so much by us, as he giveth out in pardon. We are apt to think, that <HI>we are very willing</HI> to have forgiveness; but that <HI>God is unwilling</HI> to bestow it; and that, because he seems to be a looser by it, and to forego the <HI>glory of inflicting punishment</HI> for our sins; which, of all things, we suppose, he is most loth to part withal. And this is the very nature of <HI>unbelief.</HI> But, indeed, things are quite otherwise. He hath, in this matter, through the Lord Christ, ordered all things, in his dealings with sinners, <HI>to the praise of the glory of his grace.</HI> His design, in the whole mystery of the gos∣pel, is to make his <HI>grace glorious,</HI> or to <HI>exalt</HI> pardoning mercy. The great fruit and product of his grace is <HI>forgiveness</HI>; the forgiveness of sinners. This God will render himself <HI>glorious</HI> in, and by. All the praise, glory, and worship, that he designs from any in this world, is to redound unto him by the way of this grace, as we have proved at large before<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the Hundred and Thirtieth Psalm, <HI>p. 225, 226.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>

This, as observed under a former particular, is expressive of <HI>marvellous loving kindness</HI>; and most strongly adapted to show, that the needy, the ungodly, the perishing sinner, has no reason to suspect the glorious God of reluctance to bestow the blessings of grace. No: he gives with a liberal heart, and a bountiful hand.

<P><HI>The state and character of those to whom the Apostles proclaimed the joyful news.</HI>
<Q>When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools; and changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corrup∣tible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: who changed the truth of God into a lie, and wor∣shipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen—And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; being filled with all unrighte∣ousness,

fornication, wickedness, covetousness, malici∣ousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malig∣nity; whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: who, knowing the judgment of God, that they which do such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them—We have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin. As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unpro∣fitable; there is none that doeth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitter∣ness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 21—32. iii. 9—18.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>What a melancholy moral portrait is this! How strong the colouring, and how dark the shades! Jews and Gentiles, without difference, are here described,
<PB N="75" REF="031844_0072_0FEF1D95A50F9C20"/>
as bearing characters the most detestable; and as being in a state the most awful. Yet this description comes from the hand of one, whose heart was fraught with benevolence to his own species, especially to his coun∣trymen; and from a pencil which could not give an exaggerated representation. Of such characters, in the estimate of Heaven, did the nations consist, when the Apostles, as ministers of divine truth, received their high commission. Yes, to a world thus desperately degenerate, and thus lying in wickedness, were those Ambassadors of Christ sent with tidings of salvation. To this abominably wicked world they exhibited the crucified Jesus; preaching pardon, and announcing peace, through his atoning blood. For, if pardon be not published, if peace be not proclaimed in the name of Jesus, the gospel, strictly speaking, is not preached. As, therefore, it is hard to conceive of characters more hateful, of persons more criminal, or of a state more awful, (except in the case of judicial blindness, or of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit;) than those here described; the ministers of Christ, if they would act agreeably to our Lord's commission, and to the apostolic pattern, must proclaim glad tidings to the vilest of men.</P>

<P>Here we have the position to be confirmed, in very nearly the express language of inspiration. For the Apostles were commanded to proclaim the glad tidings of salva∣tion. Christ, his work, and the grace revealed by him, constitute the substance of those glad tidings, which were to be published in all nations, and to every creature. The nations were in the most deplorable state of of igno∣rance, of depravity, and of wickedness. To them, however, the joyful proclamation was made, that it
<PB N="77" REF="031844_0074_0FEF1D9E72EEC5C8"/>
might be credited by individuals, without exception; and it was by the divinely gracious <HI>report</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 17.</NOTE> that <HI>saith came.</HI> But the facts revealed in that report could not be really believed, without relying on Jesus Christ as the only and allsufficient Saviour.

<P>By this abstract of evangelical truth it must, I think, appear, to every intelligent and impartial reader, that if the testimony of God to an apostate, guilty, and wretched world, concerning his incarnate Son, and relative to the riches of his own grace, be not a suffici∣ent warrant for the most ungodly person upon earth to believe in Jesus; it is not easy to conceive of any divine declarations which could have been made, that would have authorised any of those whom the Scriptures call <HI>sinners,</HI> or the guilty in a <HI>perishing condition,</HI> to believe in Christ</P>
<P>Leaving my reader to consider the foregoing para∣graphs in their connection one with another, I shall only add; If the gospel be not a complete warrant for the most ungodly to believe in Jesus, it must be either because the grace revealed in it <HI>is not equal to their wants</HI>; or because they are <HI>tacitly forbidden,</HI> while destitute of holiness, to treat him as the Saviour.

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. NO DEGREE OF HOLINESS PREVIOUSLY NECESSARY, TO WARRANT OUR BELIEVING IN JESUS CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a sinner is burdened with guilt, and filled with apprehensions of eternal ruin, his language is, '<HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> or, <HI>How shall I escape the wrath to come?</HI> Being ignorant of that righteousness which the gospel reveals for the justification of the ungodly, he labours to obtain acceptance with God by his own efforts: till, being better acquainted with the purity of the law, the holiness of God, and the corruption of his own heart, he despairs of being justified by the works of the law.</P>
<P>To a person thus convinced of sin, and apprehensive of danger, one should suppose the glad tidings of sovereign grace, and the doctrine of complete salvation by Jesus Christ for the chief of sinners, would be embraced with all possible readiness. Experience and observation prove, however, that awakened sinners are frequently backward to receive encouragement from the glorious gospel. This arises, not from any defect in the grace it proclaims, or in the salvation it brings; not because
<PB N="82" REF="031844_0079_0FEF1DAD463A44D0"/>
the alarmed sinner is under any necessity, or in any distress, for which it does not reveal complete relief; but because he does not behold the glory of that grace which reigns triumphantly in it, and the design of God in making the rich provision. He wants to find himself some way <HI>distinguished</HI> from others, as a proper object of mercy, by holy tempers and sanctified affections. This is his grand embarrassment. In other words he considers himself as not sufficiently <HI>humbled,</HI> under a sense of sin; as not having a suitable <HI>ahhorrence</HI> of it; and as not possessing those <HI>fervent breathings</HI> after holiness, which, as he supposes, are necessary before he can be warranted to believe in Jesus, with a well grounded hope of success <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my <HI>Reign of Grace,</HI> Chap. iv. p. 84, 85. Edit. 4th.</NOTE>—Thus the sinner, though oppressed with guilt, and earnestly desirous of salvation, opposes the designs of divine grace, by ardently seeking for holy qualifications, and personal worthiness, as prerequisite to faith in Jesus Christ! But, that no degree of holiness is previously necessary, to warrant our believing in the Lord Redeemer, I shall in the following paragraphs endeavour to prove.</P>
<P>Under what consideration, then, is any degree of holiness in the heart of a sinner necessary, before he believe in Jesus? As constituting <HI>part</HI> of his justifying rigteousness? This cannot be, without admitting, that
<PB N="83" REF="031844_0080_0FEF1DB2FAC8B0D8"/>
acceptance with God is, in some degree, by our own righteousness.—As the <HI>stipulated condition</HI> of acceptance with Christ? If so, a sinner, on performing that condi∣tion, may claim Christ, and all spiritual blessings in him, as matter of pactitional debt.
<Q>For, as Dr. OWEN says, where one thing is the condition of another, that other thing must follow the fulfilling of that condition: otherwise the condition of it, it is not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctrine of Justification,</HI> Chap. I. p. 124. Glasgow, 1760.</NOTE>.</Q>
Yes, whether the condition prescribed be greater or less, the punctual performance of it must give a legal title to all the blessings annexed to that condition: which, in the case before us, would be to obtain justifi∣cation by the works of the law.—As the qualification for obtaining an <HI>interest in Christ,</HI> or a participation of his benefits? But, necessary as a pious turn of heart is, to evince that we <HI>are</HI> partakers of Christ; it is not either an holy disposition, or faith itself, by which we <HI>obtain</HI> an interest in the blessings of our Lord's media∣torial work. No; that exalted privilege is not <HI>obtained</HI> by us, but <HI>freely granted</HI> of God, in the decree of election <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 2, 6, 9, 11, 24. Eph. i. 3—7.</NOTE>. For the substitution of Christ, and the whole of his vicarious work, very strongly imply, that all the elect were interested in him <HI>before</HI> they possessed either faith, or holiness. Nay, genuine faith, and real sanctity, ought ever to be considered, not as the <HI>cause,</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="031844_0081_0FEF1DB5E12E8990"/>
but as the <HI>fruits</HI> and <HI>evidences,</HI> of that interest. <HI>Ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep—He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John x. 26. Eph. i. 4.</NOTE>. Besides, were any degree of holiness the requisite quali∣lification for an interest in Christ, it must be equally so respecting justification by him: which, again, brings us us to the works of the law, as being remotely the pro∣curing cause of our justification before God.—As a <HI>stimulus,</HI> urging an application to Jesus Christ? But, friendly as every holy disposition in the heart of a con∣verted sinner is, to communion with Christ, and to general happiness; no principal of sanctity can, with propriety, be considered as a requisite motive to our first believing in him. Because holiness, in the whole of its nature, is as manifestly spiritual health, as depra∣vity and guilt are moral disease <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ps. ciii. 3. Isa. liii. 5. Ps. vi. 24. 1 Pet. ii. 24. Hosea xiv. 4.</NOTE>: and every sinner, in his first believing on Christ, regards him as the great Physician—as <HI>the Lord that healeth</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. ix. 12. Mark ii. 17. Luke v. 31. Exod. xv. 26.</NOTE>. But is it usual for either health, or the commencement of it, rather than disease, and the danger attending, to excite an ardent desire after a skilful and compassionate physician? —As <HI>characterising</HI> the only persons to whom, by divine authority, the gospel can be addressed? Then the Apostles must be considered as having preached salvation
<PB N="85" REF="031844_0082_0FEF1DB91ABD90D8"/>
in the name of Jesus, to the <HI>church</HI> only; not at all to the <HI>world:</HI> whereas their commission was, as we have already seen, <HI>Proclaim the glad tidings to</HI> EVERY CREA∣TURE. —As necessary to preserve the sinner, after he believes in Jesus, from <HI>abusing</HI> revealed mercy? But, as I perceive no scriptural evidence of any one really believing in Christ, and yet, in the general course of his conduct, <HI>abusing</HI> divine mercy; so we have the most express, infallible information, that <HI>the grace of God which bringeth salvation teaches to deny ungodliness</HI>; that <HI>faith</HI> in Jesus <HI>works by love</HI> to God and man; that <HI>faith without works is dead,</HI> and no better than that of devils.—But let us examine the subject more at large.</P>
<P>Every holy disposition is, to a certain degree, <HI>true holiness.</HI> On supposition, therefore, that it be necessary for a sinner to possess any measure of real sanctity, in order to warrant his reliance on Christ; it may be justly demanded, What▪ mortal shall determine the requisite <HI>quantum?</HI> Or who shall say, <HI>Thus much is necessary, and no more?</HI> Nor, consistently with the doctrine of justification entirely by an imputed righteous∣ness, and merely in a way of grace, is it easy to say, as appears by the preceding induction of particulars, for what purpose it can be necessary.</P>
<P>An holy disposition, in any case, or in the least degree, is a disposition to <HI>universal and perfect holiness.</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="031844_0083_0FEF1DBAA6D7D900"/>
For as there cannot be the least holiness, where there is no sincere affection for God; so, all holiness radically consists in love to him, as revealed in Jesus Christ. Consequently, if the contrary of our position be true, no sinner can warrantably believe in Jesus, until he be cordially disposed to perform all the divine precepts, and have the root of perfect holiness in him. But, were any minister of the word, when speaking of Jesus Christ as the Saviour of sinners, expressly to say;
<Q>You, and you <HI>only,</HI> who are heartily disposed perfectly to keep the law, are warranted to believe in Christ;</Q>
it would, I presume, be esteemed a strange kind of gospel, and little short of an insult on the distressed con∣science.</P>
<P>As we cannot conceive of holiness existing in any creature, that is entirely destitute of love to God; nor of God being loved by any creature, that does not know him; so, neither will the Scriptures permit us to conclude, that any of Adam's degenerate offspring ever knew and loved the true God, <HI>except as revealed in the Mediator.</HI> Nor will the Bible warrant our supposing, that sinners ever love the Supreme; or that they cordi∣ally approve the true character of God; before they believe in Christ, as exhibited in the gospel. <HI>There is forgiveness with Thee, that thou mayest be feared—We love Him, because he first loved us.</HI> For though he deserve the profoundest reverence, and the warmest
<PB N="87" REF="031844_0084_0FEF1DBC32FD9AA8"/>
affection, for what he is in himself; it is as manifesting his glory in Jesus Christ, that we either sincerely love, or truly revere him.</P>
<P>If, by an awakened sinner, it be admitted as a fact, and believed as a doctrine, that no one is authorised to depend on Christ for pardon and peace, until possessed of an holy disposition; he must necessarily be more solicitous to find evidence of that important requisite existing in his heart, than to understand and believe what the gospel says concerning Christ. For such a persuasion must unavoidably direct his attention to the virtuous inclinations he desires to feel, and the righteous works he wishes to perform; rather than to the riches of revealed mercy, and to the all sufficiency of the Redeemer's work. This mode of proceeding must, therefore, while it fosters his legal pride, embarrass his pained conscience: which effects are equally foreign from the genius of evangelical doctrine, and from the nature of true faith.</P>
<P>Our Lord, not being the Saviour of man, as <HI>man;</HI> or of man, as <HI>holy</HI>; but of man, as <HI>depraved, guilty,</HI> and <HI>condemned</HI>; it apparently follows, from the nature of the case, that if Christ, under his graciously saving character, ever be regarded at all, in a way of depen∣dence; the sinner must, in his first application to him, consider himself as totally base and worthless. But,
<PB N="88" REF="031844_0085_0FEF1DC1D926A8E0"/>
did he possess the least degree of true sanctity, that would be a false estimate of his own character. For holiness is no other than intellectual <HI>beauty,</HI> moral <HI>worth,</HI> and spiritual <HI>excellence.</HI> It is that by which angels are principally distinguished from devils: and, consequently, any degree of it must constitute a most important differ∣ence, in state and character, between them that possess it, and those who are entirely unholy.</P>
<P>According to the sentiment here opposed, no one is authorised to believe in Jesus, until he is <HI>born of God:</HI> for such only, have any degree of real holiness. Be the conscience of a sinner, therefore, ever so much burdened with guilt, he must have some evidence of his being <HI>a new creature,</HI> before he can consider the gospel as exhibiting any relief, or as revealing a Saviour in whom he may confide. Consequently, if, while possessed of these views, and acting consistently with them, he were to believe in Jesus; it must be under the notion of his being <HI>already</HI> a child of God, and of his possessing true holiness.— But, were any man, professing faith in Christ, expressly to declare,
<Q>That it was under the notion of his previously possessing <HI>a new heart,</HI> or a sincere love to holiness, that he first believed in Jesus Christ;</Q>
even though his exterior conduct were ever so regular, many of those who deny the position for which I plead, would be ready to suspect him of selfde∣ception. For they, I presume, would be very appre∣hensive,
<PB N="89" REF="031844_0086_0FEF1DC50F2E8150"/>
that his notions were selfrighteous, and his hope delusive. But if, previous to believing in Christ, and in order to warrant a dependence upon him, there must be an holy turn of heart; why should the person supposed fall under a suspicion so harsh? If it be a fact, that none but those who are previously born of God, and sincerely disposed to keep his commands, are encou∣raged, by the gospel, to believe in Jesus Christ; it cannot be either unlawful, or improper, from them, under that <HI>very character and consideration,</HI> to place their first reliance upon him. Because it is acting consis∣tently, by applying the principle to practice. Whereas, for persons to maintain, that some degree of holiness is previously necessary to warrant our believing in Christ; who, nevertheless, in their first application to him, con∣sider themselves as in danger of eternal ruin, and abso∣lutely unworthy, are inconsistent.</P>
<P>The principle against which I contend implies, that sinners must be <HI>cordially reconciled</HI> to the true character of God, as revealed in the Mediator, before they rely on Christ, and before they believe the gospel. But this is contrary to the apostolic doctrine. For, as it is by the gospel only, that the true character of God is made known to men; so the grand mean of reconciling the hearts of sinners to God, is the doctrine of our Lord's vicarious work. This we are taught, by the following admirable passage: <HI>All things are of God, who
<PB N="90" REF="031844_0087_0FEF1DC695E1C6B0"/>
hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation: To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

<P>The gospel, strictly so called, is the doctrine of reconciliation to God, as a righteous governor, by the death of his own incarnate Son; and it is through <HI>believing</HI> the testimony of God respecting the death of Christ, that the hearts of sinners are first reconciled to God, as appearing under his true character. For, faithful and gracious as that divine testimony is, it can have no such influence on the will, any further than it is believed.—Remarkable is that saying; <HI>If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 10.</NOTE>.

<P>Admitting the sentiment against which I militate, no one either does or can believe on Jesus Christ, until possessed of substantial reason to consider himself as <HI>free from condemnation,</HI> and as an <HI>heir of immortal happiness:</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="031844_0090_0FEF1DD12996CA20"/>
for, that such is the state of each regenerate person—of every one distinguished and adorned by true holiness, is plain from the tenour of divine Revelation. To be a child of God, by regeneration; to have pious affection toward God, and a cordial inclination to keep his commands; are, in the estimate of Scripture, evidences of a safe state, and ascertain everlasting felicity to all that are so distinguished <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 1.2.</NOTE>. Yet, on the hypothesis opposed, such must be our state and character, before we are warranted to believe in Jesus!</P>
<P>That this is a just representation of the case, appears from the writings of an Author who strenuously main∣tains the reverse of that for which I plead. Thus he speaks:
<Q>A <HI>hearty</HI> submission to, and <HI>acquiescence</HI> and <HI>delight,</HI> in the law of God, rightly understood, and so a true hatred of sin, must take place <HI>in order</HI> to any degree of true approbation of the gospel, and faith and trust in Christ—The sinner who comes to Christ for salvation, <HI>comes as a true penitent</HI>; and <HI>that</HI> repen∣tance —is necessary to <HI>this</HI> faith.</Q>
—Now, that <HI>delight</HI> in the law of God, rightly understood; a <HI>true hatred</HI> of sin, and <HI>real penitence,</HI> are evidences of regeneration, and of genuine holiness, will scarcely be denied. It is equally clear, admitting the doctrine of final persever∣ance, that persons of such a character are safe, as to
<PB N="94" REF="031844_0091_0FEF1DD2B19E0E90"/>
eternity: and yet, according to our Author, such must every one be, before he may dare to believe in Jesus! —Afterwards, however, which proves my assertion, the very same Gentleman reasons in the following man∣ner.
<Q>That men are <HI>naturally destitute of every degree</HI> of that which has the nature of true holiness, is most evi∣dent from Scripture; in that the promises of salvation are every where made to them who exercise the <HI>least degree</HI> of this, or of that which is opposite to sin: and such have the character of <HI>good</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> persons, in distinction from others. Now, if the <HI>least degree</HI> of goodness intitles a man to salvation, and denominates him <HI>a good man</HI>; then all men are naturally, wholly, without any degree of this, and so wholly corrupt; for all men are represented as naturally in a state of condemnation, and wholly destitute of that which is necessary in order to their salvation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. S. HOPKINS'S <HI>Two Discourses,</HI> p. 23, 24, 106. Ben∣nington, 1793.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Were any measure of holiness previously necessary, to warrant our believing in Jesus Christ; pardon of sin, and peace with our offended Sovereign, should be exhibited in a gospel ministry, as before observed, to none but those who are <HI>already born of God:</HI> because none but they possess the least degree of genuine sanctity. Nay, the gospel should be preached to regenerate persons, <HI>as</HI> such; no other being authorised to rely on Jesus, as revealed in
<PB N="95" REF="031844_0092_0FEF1DD87427E9D8"/>
in it. But, would this answer the gracious designs of our Lord's command, <HI>Preach the gospel to every creature?</HI> Preaching the gospel is, as already observed, <HI>proclaiming glad tidings</HI> to guilty, depraved, and ruined creatures— tidings of pardon, of peace, and of salvation, through Jesus Christ. Preaching the gospel, is preaching Christ himself, or bearing a public testimony to his gracious gracious character, and perfect work. Preaching the gospel, therefore, is proclaiming salvation by sovereign grace—is exhibiting Jesus, not as willing to supply the deficiencies in <HI>upright</HI> characters; nor, merely, as grant∣ing assistance to persons <HI>already</HI> in the way to heaven; but, as the only, the all sufficient, the absolutely free Saviour of the condemned, the worthless, the lost.</P>
<P>Again: Did the Apostles preach Jesus Christ, or did they proclaim pardon and peace through his blood, to those only whom they considered as <HI>really penitent,</HI> and as having an <HI>holy turn</HI> of heart? The reverse is a fact: for, as we have before seen, they were commissioned to proclaim glad tidings to the profligate, impious, and wicked world. Those, however, who are truly peni∣tent, and possessed of real holiness, are not <HI>of the world,</HI> but <HI>of God;</HI> being manifestly called out of their natural state.—When Paul was preaching to his Jewish brethren, of whom he had a painful suspicion that, while they wondered at his testimony, they would reject it and perish in their unbelief—even those Jews, who after∣ward
<PB N="96" REF="031844_0093_0FEF1DDB6AF3A6B8"/>
are said to be <HI>filled with envy,</HI> to <HI>contradict and blaspheme;</HI> his language was, <HI>Be it known unto</HI> YOU <HI>there∣fore, men and brethren, that through this</HI> illustrious Jesus <HI>is preached unto</HI> YOU <HI>the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 46, 50.</NOTE>. Now, as it would be a dangerous mistake to suppose, that Paul declared the sins of those ungodly Jews to be <HI>already</HI> forgiven, and their persons justified; so it would be inconsistent with the nature of his gracious declaration to imagine, that he did not consider them as authorised, by his infallible testimony, immediately to believe in Christ for pardon and acceptance with God.—I will add, is it supposable that Paul and Silas considered the Philip∣pian jailor as born of God, and possessed of true holi∣ness, when, in answer to his important query, they said; <HI>Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved?</HI> There is not, that I perceive, the least reason for any suppo∣sition of that kind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Reign of grace,</HI> Chap. V.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As it was under the character of a <HI>priest,</HI> that Christ expiated guilt, and made reconciliation; so, when a sinner first applies to him, though it be for the blessings of salvation in general, yet his eye is principally fixed on pardon and peace. Justifying faith, says Dr. OWEN,
<Q>respecteth Christ in his <HI>priestly</HI> office alone, as he was the
<PB N="97" REF="031844_0094_0FEF1DDE8C4BEB30"/>
surety of the Covenant, with what he did in the dis∣charge thereof. The consideration of his other offices is not excluded, but it is not formally comprised in the object of faith <HI>as justifying</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On Justification,</HI> Chap. III.</NOTE>.</Q> —Thus also Mr. CHARNOCK:
<Q>When the venom of sin begins to work in the conscience, and the thunder of the law alarms it to judgment, and the punishment due to sin is pre∣sented in the horrors of it; the question immediately is, Whether there be any remedy, and where? How forgiveness of sin is to be attained? The only remedy is proposed in Christ, and Christ <HI>as a sacrifice.</HI> It is not Christ risen, or ascended, or exalted: not Christ, only as the Son of God, or the head of angels: not Christ, as the creator of the world, or by whom all things consist: but Christ, as answering the terms of the first Covenant; as disarming justice; and this he did, as a <HI>sacrifice.</HI> By this he bore the curse; by this he broke down the partition wall; by this he joined apostate man and an offended God. This is that true faith pitcheth on, daily revolves, and daily applies to. This is the <HI>first</HI> object of the soul, Christ <HI>made sin;</HI> Christ <HI>bearing the punishment</HI>; Christ <HI>substi∣tuted</HI> in the room of the offender—This is that which pacifies God; and only that which pacifies God can pacify the Conscience <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Works,</HI> Vol. II. p. 549.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="031844_0095_0FEF1DE175654408"/>Is it congruous, then, to suppose, that a criminal, when seeking pardon of sin and peace for his conscience, must necessarily apply for them under the notion of his previously possessing a pious turn of heart? Yet, whoever is persuaded, that any degree of holiness is absolutely necessary to warrant his believing in Jesus, cannot but regard the atonement, if, consistently with his principles, he ever do regard it, under the notion of his being possessed of the requisite sanctity.—Were the atonement of Christ entirely rejected, and were he revealed as willing to assist only the weak, but well disposed, in <HI>saving themselves</HI>; then, indeed, it might be esteemed rational to conclude, that whoever is authorised to depend on him for help, must be well qualified, by holy inclinations and strenuous exertions. But, for those who consider the death of Christ as vicarious and expia∣tory; or as constituting the only ground of hope for pardon and peace; to maintain, the necessity of holiness as warranting our dependence on that very death, is extremely inconsistent. For, according to the sentiment opposed, though the death of Jesus be, confessedly, an <HI>atonement</HI>; and though, by the very nature of the case, it could be intended for <HI>none</HI> but the guilty; yet, before any of that criminal character be permitted to regard it with affiance, they must be <HI>holy.</HI></P>
<P>As no one can be thoroughly persuaded, that, in order to faith in Christ for pardon and acceptance, an holy
<PB N="99" REF="031844_0096_0FEF1DE4A3CD19A0"/>
disposition is absolutely necessary, without being anxiously concerned to obtain the important requisite; so, no sooner does he consider himself as possessing that requi∣site, than it becomes to him <HI>the primary source of peace.</HI> Yes, his first encouragement and hope arise,—not from the atonement of Christ; not from revealed mercy; nor from the testimony of God concerning his incarnate Son, and the work performed by him;—but, from the <HI>change</HI> which has taken place in his own heart; from the <HI>holy tendency</HI> of his will; from the <HI>difference</HI> which subsists between himself and others, that are altogether unworthy. Conscious that some degree of moral worth attaches to his character, and considering this as previously necessary to warrant a sinner's dependence on Christ; his first hope is derived, not from divine <HI>grace,</HI> as revealed in the <HI>gospel;</HI> but from his own <HI>holiness,</HI> as required by the LAW: which is directly contrary to the grand prin∣ciples of evangelical truth.</P>
<P>Our Lord says, <HI>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 14, 15.</NOTE>. Now here, it is evident, our divine Instructor teaches us to consider the dying state of the Israelites, that were bitten by the fiery serpents, as an emblem of our perishing condition by sin: the brazen serpent, elevated
<PB N="100" REF="031844_0097_0FEF1E213765DE98"/>
on a pole, as a type of himself expiring on the cross: the looking of wounded Israelites to the brazen serpent, as emblematical of condemned sinners depending on his own death; and the perfect recovery obtained, by viewing the artificial serpent, as emblematical of that salvation which is through faith in his atoning blood. To this, perhaps, there may be an allusion, when Jeho∣vah says; <HI>Look unto</HI> ME, <HI>and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xlv. 22. Faith in Christ crucified, says Dr. OWEN, is

<HI>On Justification. General Considerations.</HI></NOTE>. We may infer, however, that as the wounded Israelites, without any preparative, except a sense of danger be so denominated, were authorised to look at the brazen serpent, with an expectation of complete recovery; so sinners, while destitute of every holy qualification, and as impelled by an apprehension of eternal ruin, are warranted to believe in Jesus Christ, with hope of complete salvation.</P>
<P>Very emphatical is the language, and exceedingly rich is the grace which appears, in the following passage. <HI>When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward
<PB N="101" REF="031844_0098_0FEF1DEBF786EF70"/>
us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE>. —In the work of redemption by Jesus our Lord, there are two particulars on account of which the love of God to men is principally celebrated by the inspired Writers: which particulars are, <HI>the sending of his only begotten</HI> SON, and <HI>the delivering him up to death for</HI> SINNERS <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John iii. 16. Matt. xxi. 37. Rom. viii. 32. 1 John. iii. 16.</NOTE>. It is to the latter of these that Paul directs our attention, in the text before us. Here we have a mode of expression that is very uncommon; and, considering of whom the Apostle speaks, it is truly wonderful; <HI>God</HI> COMMENDETH <HI>his love!</HI> He exhibits its brightest beauties; he presents to our view its most winning attractives; he displays it in the most surprising and charming point of light. As if he should say;
<Q>Such is MY love! So free, so fervent, so fruitful of benefits, and so becoming my infinite excellence, that I consider the manifestation of it, as the chief glory of all my ways respecting the sons of men! to whom I RECOMMEND <HI>it,</HI> in a peculiar man∣ner, as the eternal source of their happiness, and as the principal subject of their delightful meditation.</Q>
— <HI>God commendeth his love</HI> TOWARD US. Wonderful saying! That reasonable creatures ought ever to consider divine benevolence as the fountain of their felicity, is plain to every thinking person: but that the Most High should speak of RECOMMENDING <HI>his love,</HI> even though
<PB N="102" REF="031844_0099_0FEF1DED8E7E01B8"/>
it were to <HI>angels,</HI> is truly amazing! How much more wonderful, then, to hear him speak of <HI>commending his love to</HI> MEN—to polluted mortals—to criminals, who deserve perdition!</P>
<P>But <HI>how,</HI> or in what <HI>way,</HI> does the Supreme com∣mend his own philanthropy? Not by passing an act of indemnity in favour of those who lothe sin, and love holiness. Not by justifying those who have performed qualifying conditions, and by giving heaven to saints. Nor does he recommend his love to men, in pardoning their offences, accepting their persons, and bestowing immortal happiness upon them, by the mere exertion of his royal prerogative and supreme dominion. No: respecting these particulars, the admirable text is entirely silent. But it was by <HI>sending his</HI> OWN SON, and by giving him up to death for us, <HI>when we were yet</HI> WITH∣OUT STRENGTH, to perform any thing truly good; <HI>while we were</HI> YET SINNERS, or entirely destitute of every amiable quality; and while we were absolutely UN∣GODLY in the turn of our hearts, and the course of our lives. In other words, a detestable compound of depravity and guilt, of weakness and unworthiness. Of such a nature is that apostate state in which we were, when <HI>God com∣mended his love to us,</HI> by the gift of his incarnate Son; and by Jesus falling a victim, in our stead to eternal justice!</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="031844_0100_0FEF1DF0776BFD00"/>Again: It is worthy of observation, that Paul does not say, God commends his <HI>mercy,</HI> or his <HI>grace;</HI> but, which is yet more emphatical, delightful, and wonderful, his LOVE. It deserves also to be remarked, that the Father's <HI>giving</HI> or <HI>sending</HI> of his own Son, and the <HI>volun∣tary death</HI> of Jesus for us, are most commonly ascribed to the LOVE, not the <HI>mercy</HI> or the <HI>grace,</HI> of the Father, and of the Son <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 16. 1 John iii. 16. iv. 9, 10. Gal. ii. 20. Eph. v. 2, 25.

When God has completely delivered his people from all the penal effects of their apostacy, they will no longer be the objects of his goodness, under the strict notion of <HI>mercy;</HI> because mercy has regard to <HI>misery.</HI> When they are perfectly free from all the unworthiness attending depravity and guilt, they will no longer be the objects of divine good∣ness, under the apostolic notion of <HI>grace</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 24. iv. 4. ix. 5, 6. Eph. ii. 5—9.</NOTE>: for grace, in the writings of Paul, respects the unworthiness of a <HI>sinful</HI> creature. But saints will ever be the blessed objects of divine goodness, under the delightful notion of LOVE. Holy angels are the objects of divine goodness under the notion of <HI>love;</HI> but not of <HI>mercy,</HI> or of <HI>grace,</HI> in
<PB N="104" REF="031844_0101_0FEF89AC6FD6EED8"/>
the apostolic sense of those terms, when used respecting sinners.</P>
<P>Relative to this distinction, Dr. GOODWIN says; <HI>Love</HI> is
<Q>a desire to communicate good, the chiefest good, unto the creature; but <HI>mercy,</HI> it is to pull the creature out of a depth of misery—So that mercy super∣addeth this to love, that it respects the creature in <HI>misery.</HI> Parents, they love their children, simply as they are their <HI>children;</HI> but if they be fallen into misery, then love works in a way of <HI>pity</HI>—It is not mercy only,—but [the Apostle] also mentioneth <HI>love</HI>; —because that mercy only respecteth <HI>misery,</HI> as I said before: it goes no further, simply <HI>as</HI> mercy, than the relieving those that are in misery—Mercy causeth a king to pardon a traitor: but if he shall take this trai∣tor and advance him to the highest dignity, place him with him in the throne, as it were; this must needs be from <HI>love</HI> too; this is superadding, in that respect, unto mercy—God's <HI>love,</HI> it is the greatest thing of all the rest; it is more than all his benefits. The <HI>love</HI> of Christ was more than his sufferings; and his sufferings were more than his benefits: and the love of God, it is more than all his gifts, yet he hath given great things to us, and done great things for us. <HI>Amor est primum donum; his love is the first gift,</HI> as one well saith: in the gift of which all things else are yours. The gift of his Son, it was a great gift; but it was founded in
<PB N="105" REF="031844_0102_0FEF1DF4C6760998"/>
his love. <HI>He so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</HI> Though we, being sinners, need <HI>mercy,</HI> (that is the next thing we want) and therefore we look to it, O mercy, mercy! because we apprehend ourselves in misery: but do you look beyond mercy, and look to <HI>love</HI>; which is a greater thing to you than mercy; raiseth and enlargeth mercy; and, when mercy hath done with you, will do more, or as much for you as mercy hath done, and guideth mercy— <HI>Love</HI> is a desire to communicate good unto us—<HI>Mercy</HI> respecteth us as we are fallen into sin and misery— And then that of <HI>Grace,</HI>—it adds but this, a <HI>freeness</HI> unto both. Love and mercy freely bestowed, that is called <HI>grace,</HI> in either <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Eph. ii. 4, 5, 6. <HI>Works,</HI> Vol. I. Part II. p. 129, 130, 132, 138.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. CHARNOCK, thus:
<Q><HI>Love</HI> is a perfection of a higher strain than <HI>mercy:</HI> mercy may be prevalent, where love is absent—This [goodness of God] under the name of his <HI>love,</HI> is rendered [or given as] the sole cause of the redeeming death of the Son: it was to COMMEND <HI>his love</HI> with the highest gloss, and in so singular a manner that had not its parallel in nature, nor in all his other works, and reaches, in the bright∣ness of it, beyond the manifested extent of any other attribute. It must be only a miraculous goodness that
<PB N="106" REF="031844_0103_0FEF1DF7B291DCA0"/>
induced him to expose the life of his Son to those diffi∣culties in the world, and death upon the cross, for the freedom of sordid rebels. His great end was, to give such a demonstration of the liberality of his nature as might be <HI>attractive</HI> to his creature, remove its shak∣ings and tremblings, and encourage its approaches to him. It is in this he would not only <HI>manifest</HI> his love, but <HI>assume the Name of</HI> LOVE. By this name the Holy Ghost calls him in relation to this good will manifested in his Son: <HI>God is</HI> LOVE. <HI>In this is manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</HI> He would take the Name he never expressed himself in before. He was JEHO∣VAH, in regard of the truth of his promise: so he expressed himself of old. He is GOODNESS, in regard of the grandeur of his affection in the mission of his Son: and therefore he would be known by the name of LOVE now, in the days of the gospel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Works,</HI> Vol. II. p. 333. Vol. I. <HI>Discourse on the Goodness of God.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>If, then, the highest demonstration of divine favour; that which, in the estimate of God himself, is the <HI>grand</HI> recommendation of his love to men; consist in his giving Jesus to die for us while we were yet <HI>sinners, ungodly,</HI> and <HI>without strength;</HI> we may safely conclude, that
<PB N="107" REF="031844_0104_0FEF1DF940CA83C0"/>
the sentiment opposed cannot be <HI>to the praise of the glory of his grace.</HI> For, how incongruous it is to suppose, that though the blessed God <HI>recommend</HI> his love to us, considered as mere sinners; and though it is in Christ only, as dying for mere sinners, that the admirably glo∣rious properties of divine love are to be seen; yet, before those very sinners for whom Christ died, and to whom God recommends his love, are <HI>permitted</HI> to believe in Jesus, and to behold the wonderful excellencies of that amazing love, they must have some degree of spiritual <HI>strength</HI>—they must become <HI>godly</HI>—they must be real <HI>saints!</HI> for all these ideas attach to every one that possesses the least measure of true holiness. God, in the death of Jesus, recommends his love to <HI>sinners,</HI> or the <HI>ungodly</HI>; yet they must cease to be such before they regard it!—Should any persons of so base a character presume to approach the dying Jesus as their only hope, the ungracious genius of that principle against which I contend cries in their ears, <HI>Procul ô, procul este profani: Hence, far hence, O ye profane!</HI></P>
<P>Had the glorious God been represented as recom∣mending his love to the <HI>penitent,</HI> the <HI>upright,</HI> the <HI>virtuous;</HI> we might have concluded, that none but persons of those amiable characters were authorised to regard Christ with dependence, and with expectation. But, had that been the case, the love of God to us could not, with propriety, have been so contrasted, as it is here, with the love of
<PB N="108" REF="031844_0105_0FEF1DFF0C109B98"/>
one man to another. <HI>For sinners love those that love them</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke vi. 32.</NOTE>; and the Apostle admits, that, for a <HI>good</HI> man, some one perhaps may <HI>even dare to die.</HI> Besides, on that supposition, the divine Father might have been viewed, and would certainly have been considered by distressed souls, as commending his love to <HI>rectitude,</HI> to <HI>virtue,</HI> to <HI>holiness,</HI> rather than to <HI>sinners;</HI> and the abso∣lutely unworthy would have had no ground of hope.— Whereas, if Christ died for us <HI>while we were yet sinners;</HI> and if God, by that very fact, more than by any other effect of divine goodness, <HI>commend</HI> his love to us; we ought, surely, to consider the eternal Father as recom∣commending the <HI>crucified Jesus</HI> to us, while we are <HI>yet sinners</HI>—recommending him, as an all sufficient Saviour for the most guilty; as perfectly suitable to the circum∣stances of the most needy; and as completely free for the most unworthy. Thus he is revealed in the glad tidings: and what is believing in Jesus, but relying upon him, or treating him, according to this view of his character? God himself, in the death of Christ, com∣mending his love to mere sinners; the ungodly must be warranted thankfully to regard that recommendation, and to believe in the Son of God.</P>
<P>Christ is made <HI>sanctification</HI> to all that are truly con∣verted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 30.</NOTE>. Every holy disposition, therefore, in the

Ought we, then, to support the affirmative of what is opposed, to consider our Lord as actually made sanctification to any sinner, who is not authorised to believe in him? or imagine that an ungodly person must receive holiness from Jesus Christ, in order to warrant his dependence upon him? So to do, would confound the state of believers with that of unbelievers; would invert the order of things in the method of grace, and be attended with various absurdities.—Does the Most Holy sanctify any sinner? it is as <HI>the God of peace</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. v. 23.</NOTE>: but he bears that delightful character, only as <HI>reconciling the world to himself</HI> by the death of Christ.

<Q>God only sanctifies as a <HI>God of peace</HI> —Would we be <HI>perfect in every good work</HI>; would we do the will of God; would we have every thing wel∣pleasing in his sight wrought in us? then we should go to him as a <HI>God of peace</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii. 20, 21. <HI>Works,</HI> Vol. II. p. 222.</NOTE>.</Q> —'Sanctification,' says Dr. OWEN,

For he <HI>was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,</HI> destroying the enmity which entered by sin, and laying the foundation of eternal peace. From hence it is, that he will <HI>sanctify</HI> us, or make us holy; without a respect whereunto he would no more do so,
<PB N="110" REF="031844_0107_0FEF1E0388E1FCA0"/>

— Must it not be necessary, then, for sinners to regard the atonement of Christ as all sufficient, in which the divine Father appears under that gracious character, <HI>the God of peace;</HI> in order to a well-grounded expectation of ever possessing the least degree of true holiness?</P>
<P><HI>Coming</HI> to Christ, and <HI>believing</HI> on him, are the same thing; as appears from the words of our Lord himself. <HI>He that</HI> COMETH <HI>to me, shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me, shall never thirst</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John vi. 35.</NOTE>.

Because, in whomsoever an holy disposition is implanted, it will, more or less, exert itself in pious affections, and righteous conduct: which must be considered in the light of spiritual <HI>fruit.</HI>—I said, <HI>vital</HI> union; like that of a living branch to a flourishing vine. For, so far as I have observed, it is allowed by all who are conversant in these affairs, that, previous to believing in Jesus Christ, there is no such union between him and any sinner.</P>
<P>The Scriptures teach us to consider all unbelievers as in a state of enmity to God, and of spiritual death. <HI>To the unbelieving,</HI> we are also informed, <HI>nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Titus i. 15.</NOTE>.

<PB N="112" REF="031844_0109_0FEF1E0C370D7D98"/>
have some degree of spiritual purity, before they obtain permission to believe in Jesus. For I think it is demon∣strable, that he in whose heart any holy disposition resides, is neither under the dominion of disaffection to God, nor in spiritual death, nor destitute of spiritual purity.</P>
<P>Under whatever characters Christ is represented as considering his people, with reference to their legal and moral state. when he gave himself a ransom for them; under the very same characters are unconverted persons warranted to believe in him. For we cannot suppose, without absurdity, that Christ died for men under <HI>one</HI> character, and that they must depend upon his death under <HI>another.</HI> Now it is plain, from the Records of Inspiration, that those whom Christ came to save, and for whom he died, were considered by him, as <HI>guilty</HI>— as <HI>ungodly</HI>—as <HI>enemies to God</HI>—as <HI>extremely depraved</HI>— as <HI>the chief of sinners</HI>—as <HI>justly condemned</HI>—and as <HI>lost</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 15.

Consequently, such being their native characters, and such their awful state, they must believe in him at first, not as <HI>qualified</HI> persons, but as <HI>perishing</HI> wretches; not as <HI>adorned</HI> with the beauties of holiness, but as <HI>lothsome</HI> with the pollution of hell.

<P>I said, <HI>in a</HI> SCRIPTURAL <HI>sense:</HI> because they who possess the least degree of true holiness, are not, either in the Old or the New Testament, denominated, abso∣lutely, <HI>sinners,</HI> the <HI>ungodly,</HI> the <HI>lost,</HI> and so on; but the reverse. Yes, notwithstanding their numerous and crimi∣nal imperfections, with regard to inherent holiness and personal obedience; they are characterised, Those that <HI>know the Lord—fear the Lord—love the Lord—serve the Lord:</HI> the <HI>righteous</HI>—the <HI>upright</HI>—the <HI>perfect: disciples, believers, faithful brethren, sons of God, saints,</HI> and so on.

<P>It was the design of our Lord, in his admirable para∣ble of the Prodigal, and in that of the Publican <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 11—32. xviii. 10—14.</NOTE>, to inform us, Under what <HI>character,</HI> or under what <HI>consi∣deration</HI> of ourselves, we must apply to God for pardon, for peace, and for salvation. What, then, are the most prominent features of those two parabolical persons, when viewed as coming to God for acceptance? The Prodigal appears as a ragged, filthy, starving wretch; who, impelled by mere necessity, returns to his Father, without any recommendation of person, or of character; and as deserving to be for ever exheridated. The Publican, smitten with a sense of enormous guilt; far from considering himself as possessing any holy dispo∣sition; and harrassed with apprehensions of eternal ruin; appears as a criminal who deserves to be damned, and who dares not lift up his eyes to heaven, even when <HI>he cries for mercy</HI> through an atonement. Surely, then, these characters, and the scope of these parables, are far from teaching, that sinners must have some degree of holiness before they be authorised to believe in Jesus.— Nay, in the parable of the <HI>Pharisee</HI> and the <HI>Publican,</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="031844_0112_0FEF1E123677B9C0"/>
our Lord so describes the former as to show, that whoe∣ver approaches God, with a view to <HI>justification</HI> before him, under any other character than that of a <HI>miserable sinner;</HI> or as encouraged by any other consideration, than that of <HI>mercy revealed</HI> in the atonement; is charge∣able with selfrighteous pride, and sure to meet with a fatal disappointment.</P>
<P>I said, <HI>with a view to</HI> JUSTIFICATION <HI>before God:</HI> for this is the single point under consideration. Because it was <HI>that</HI> for which our Lord represents the Pharisee and Publican, as addressing the Most High; and because it is <HI>that</HI> which an awakened sinner principally seeks, in his first application to Jesus Christ.—Has a person <HI>believed through grace?</HI> has he already <HI>received the atonement?</HI> and is he approaching the throne of divine mercy for a fresh application of pardon, with reference to the imper∣fection of his duties, the daily operation of his corrup∣tions, and the backslidings of which he is conscious? Or, does he apply for larger measures of sanctifying influence? he may come to God as one of his <HI>disobe∣dient children,</HI> or as <HI>a feeble and very imperfect follower</HI> of Jesus Christ, crying, <HI>Abba, Father.</HI> Nay, when lamenting over his indwelling depravity and actual trans∣gressions, he may even say; <HI>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men,</HI> that are profligates in their conduct; that are dead in sin; or that are seeking <HI>to establish their own righteousness.</HI> For the Pharisee, in this parable, is
<PB N="116" REF="031844_0113_0FEF1E18353304C0"/>
not censured, merely because he thanked God for <HI>the difference</HI> which subsisted between himself, and the profli∣gate part of the world; but because he placed that differ∣ence to the account of his <HI>justification before God.</HI> In <HI>that</HI> respect, the chaste lady, and the vile prostitute; the most virtuous characters, and the greatest profligates, are completely on a level; having only one common ground of hope—<HI>the vicarious obedience of Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>It must, I think, be granted, that when a sinner first believes in Jesus, he is concerned chiefly about pardon and acceptance with God. But, if so, the spirit of those instructive parables to which I advert, absolutely forbids our supposing, that any degree of holiness is required of a sinner, to warrant his dependence on Christ. We will, however, for the sake of argument, admit the contrary. We will suppose that a sinner, under a persuasion of his possessing some degree of true sanctity, applies to the glorious Jesus; and that he addresses God in prayer, for justification, agreeably to this view of himself. What, then, will be the spirit of his address at the throne of Eternal Majesty? Must it not, either expressly or implicitly, be as follows?
<Q><HI>God, I thank thee, that I am not</HI> as the multitude of <HI>other men!</HI> Once, indeed, I lived in disobedience, and loved sin: but now it is otherwise, as to the turn of my heart, and the course of my life. Having a pious disposition, my will is under an holy bias; which leads
<PB N="117" REF="031844_0114_0FEF1E19C7009E28"/>
me to revere thy authority, and to keep thy commands. Thus possessing the requisite divinely prescribed to all those that would acceptably believe in Jesus, and through his merits obtain justification; I cannot doubt, either of acceptance with thee, or of admission into thy eternal kingdom.</Q>
—This, or something similar, is the genuine language of every one who, in his devotional addresses relative to <HI>justification,</HI> proceeds on that ungra∣cious principle which I oppose! There is reason to think, however, that many who warmly <HI>dispute</HI> for the principle, entirely desert it in <HI>prayer;</HI> and would even be shocked to hear a religious address to the Deity, respecting justification, formed upon it.—But, if the principle in question be an article of divine truth, it must be of great importance: for it enters deeply into the doctrine of justification. Why should it not, then, by all that embrace it, be avowed in their solemn prayers for pardon and acceptance, especially by those who, with the Pharisee, consider themselves as possessing the requisite holiness? Why does it not make a conspicuous appearance in their devotional practice? To scruple the propriety of such an avowal, is an implicit condemnation of the principle itself.</P>
<P>Remarkably pertinent, relative to this particular, is the following language of Dr. OWEN. The Pharisee ascribes
<Q>all that he did to God. <HI>God, I thank thee:</HI> although he did all [he mentions,] yet he owned the
<PB N="118" REF="031844_0115_0FEF1E1B4AC2DA30"/>
aid and assistance of God, by his grace, in it all. He esteemed himself much to differ from other men, but he ascribed it not unto himself that so he did. All the righteousness and holiness which he laid claim unto, he ascribed unto the benignity and goodness of God. Wherefore he neither pleaded any <HI>merit</HI> in his works, nor any works performed in his <HI>own strength,</HI> without the aid of grace. All that he pretends is, that by the grace of God he had fulfilled the <HI>condition</HI> of the Cove∣nant, and thereon expected to be justified. And whatever words men shall be pleased to make use of in their vocal prayers, God interprets their minds accord∣ing to what they trust in, as unto their justification before him. And if some men will be true to their <HI>own principles,</HI> this [prayer of the Pharisee] is the prayer which, <HI>mutatis, mutandis,</HI> they <HI>ought</HI> to make.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctrine of Justification,</HI> Chap. XVII.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Paul, when proving the doctrine of justification by an imputed righteousness, and when adducing the case of Abraham as quite in point, thus interrogates and replies; <HI>How was it</HI> (the Patriarch's faith, or that in which he believed) <HI>then reckoned? When he was in circumcision? Or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncir∣cumcision</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 10.</NOTE>. The Apostle's design in these queries and answers was to evince, that justification before God is of <HI>mere grace,</HI> by an imputed righteousness; and that no
<PB N="119" REF="031844_0116_0FEF1DEA6E6EF680"/>
duty performed by us, nor any holiness wrought in us, has the least influence in procuring that inestimable blessing. Adopting the inspired Writer's manner of speaking, I may, therefore, interrogate and answer thus: How, then, is the vicarious obedience of Christ imput∣ed to a sinner? When he is possessed of <HI>true holiness?</HI> Or when he is considered as <HI>ungodly?</HI> Not when in the <HI>for∣mer,</HI> but while in the <HI>latter</HI> state: for the text is express, He <HI>that justifieth the ungodly</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 5.</NOTE>. Consequently, no degree of holiness is previously necessary to warrant our believ∣ing in Jesus Christ: because it would be absurd to con∣sider any person as <HI>ungodly,</HI> who possesses the least measure of real holiness.</P>
<P><HI>They who are in health need not a physician, but they that are sick;</HI> is a maxim of common sense, as well as of Scripture. Now Christ is the physician of souls, whose disease consists in depravity and guilt. To sup∣pose, therefore, that sinners must possess any measure of true holiness, before they are warranted to believe in Jesus; is equally incongruous as to maintain, that a patient must be in a convalescent state, before he can, with propriety, apply to a physician. For, I presume it must be admitted, that when any sinner becomes possessed of holy inclinations, he is, in a moral sense, <HI>convalescent.</HI> His recovery is <HI>begun</HI>: and taking the doctrine of perse∣verance

But the sentiment against which I contend implies, either, that the gospel may be received, without relying on Christ; or, that holiness may exist in the heart of a sinner, who does not believe the truth: neither of which can be supported by the word of God. Not the <HI>former:</HI> for the genuine gospel is the testimony of God concern∣ing Christ. It is a revelation, and an exhibition, of his Person and offices; of his grace and work <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 1.</NOTE>.

<P>To maintain that a sinner, before he can warrantably believe in Jesus, must have some degree of holiness, is contrary to the apostolic doctrine of justification before God.

<P><PB N="126" REF="031844_0123_0FEF1E362C259ED8"/><HI>With the</HI> CHARACTER <HI>of those whom God justifies.</HI> Thus it is described by the Apostle: <HI>To him that work∣eth, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 4, 5.</NOTE>. He that <HI>worketh not</HI>—the <HI>ungodly</HI>: such is the character of him that believes in Jesus, and whom God graciously justifies! But if the mere sinner be not authorised to believe in Jesus; if any degree of holiness be previously necessary to faith in him; I do not perceive how it can be consi∣dered as a fact, that God justifies him who <HI>worketh not,</HI> or any that are <HI>ungodly.</HI> Let us again hear Dr. OWEN, expressing himself as follows;
<Q>To say, he who <HI>worketh not,</HI> is justified through believing; is to say, that his works, whatever they be, have <HI>no influence</HI> into his justification; nor hath God, in justifying him, any respect unto them. Wherefore he <HI>alone</HI> who <HI>worketh not</HI> is the subject of justification; the person to be justi∣fied. That is, God considereth no man's works, no man's duties of obedience, in his justification; seeing we are justified <HI>freely by his grace.</HI> And when God affirmeth expressly, that he justifieth him who <HI>worketh not,</HI> and that <HI>freely by his grace;</HI> I cannot understand what place our works, or duties, of obedience, can have in our justification. For why should we trouble ourselves to invent of what consideration they may be,
<PB N="127" REF="031844_0124_0FEF1E37C065C2C8"/>
in our justification before God, when he himself affirms that they are of <HI>none at all?</HI> Neither are the words capable of any evading interpretation. <HI>He that worketh not,</HI> IS <HI>he that worketh not,</HI> let men say what they please, and distinguish as long as they will. And it is a boldness not to be justified, for any to rise up in oppo∣sition to such express divine testimonies, however they may be harnessed with philosophical notions and argu∣ings; which are but as thorns and briars which the word of God will pass through and consume.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But the Apostle further adds, in the description of the subject of justification, that God <HI>justifieth the</HI> UN∣GODLY. This is that expression which hath stirred up so much wrath among many, and on account whereof some seem to be much displeased with the Apostle him∣self. If any other person dare but say, that God <HI>justifieth the</HI> UNGODLY; he is presently reflected on as one that, by his doctrine, would overthrow the necessity of godliness, holiness, obedience, or good works. For what need can there be of any of them, if God justifieth the <HI>ungodly?</HI> Howbeit, this is a periphrasis of God, that he is he who <HI>justifieth the</HI> UNGODLY. This is his prerogative and property. <HI>As such</HI> he will be believed and worshipped; which adds weight and em∣phasis unto the expression: and we must not forego this testimony of the Holy Ghost, let men be as angry as they please. But the difference is about the <HI>mean∣ing</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="031844_0125_0FEF1E3DB1FA3468"/>
of the words. If so, it may be allowed without mutual offence, though we should mistake their proper sense. Only it must be granted, that God <HI>justifieth the ungodly.</HI> That is, say some, those who <HI>formerly were ungodly</HI>; not such who <HI>continue</HI> ungodly when they are justified: and this is most true. All that are justified, were before ungodly: and all that are justified, are at the same instant made godly. But the question is, Whether they are godly or ungodly, <HI>antecedently,</HI> in any moment of time, <HI>unto their justification?</HI> If they are considered as <HI>godly,</HI> and are so indeed, then the Apostle's words are not true, that God justifieth the <HI>ungodly:</HI> for the contradictory proposition is true, God justifieth <HI>none but the godly.</HI> Wherefore, although in, and with, the justification of a sinner, he is made godly; for he is endowed with that faith which puri∣fieth the heart, and is a vital principle of all obedience, and the conscience is purged from dead works by the blood of Christ; yet, antecedently unto his justifica∣tion, he <HI>is</HI> ungodly, and <HI>considered</HI> as ungodly; as one who <HI>worketh not;</HI> as one whose duties and obedience contribute nothing to his justification. As he <HI>worketh not,</HI> all works are excluded from being the <HI>cause;</HI> and as he is <HI>ungodly,</HI> from being the <HI>condition,</HI> of his justification—Not this, or that sort of works; not this, or that manner of the performance of them; not this, or that kind of interest in our justification; but <HI>all</HI> works of what sort soever, and however performed, are
<PB N="129" REF="031844_0126_0FEF1E409DFEAE30"/>
excluded from <HI>any kind</HI> of consideration in our justifi∣cation, as our works or duties of obedience.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It will be said, <HI>That our personal obedience is by none asserted to be the righteousness whereby we are justified before God, in the same</HI> MANNER <HI>as it was under the Covenant of works.</HI> But the argument speaks, not as unto the <HI>manner,</HI> or <HI>way,</HI> whereby it is so; but to the <HI>thing itself.</HI> If it be so in <HI>any</HI> way or manner, under what qualifications soever, we are under that Covenant still. If it be of works <HI>any way,</HI> it is not of grace <HI>at all—All is now resolved into the merit of Christ, upon the account whereof alone, our own personal righte∣ousness is accepted before God unto our justification.</HI> The question is not, On what <HI>account,</HI> nor for what <HI>reason,</HI> it is so accepted; but whether it be, or no: seeing its so being is effectually constitutive of a Cove∣nant of works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctrine of Justification,</HI> Chap. XVIII, XIII.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The sentiment is adapted to <HI>encourage boasting.</HI> This, however, is directly contrary to the apostolic doctrine. For Paul assures us, that, by God's method of justifying sinners, all boasting, even in <HI>comparative</HI> worthiness, is entirely, and for ever excluded. Thus he interrogates and determines: <HI>Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus—Where is boasting,
<PB N="130" REF="031844_0127_0FEF1E42277885D0"/>
then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay: but by the law of faith—By grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 24, 27. Eph. ii, 8, 9.</NOTE>. According to the doctrine of Paul, a justified sinner, with reference to the moment preceding his justification, has no more ground to think well of his personal qualifications, or to applaud his own exertions, relative to that affair; than his unhappy neighbour has, who is dying under a curse, and sinking into final ruin.—But, admitting that any degree of holiness be necessary to warrant a sinner's dependence on Christ, it must be so to justification through faith in his blood: because it is in virtue of personal sanctity that he is qualified for <HI>believing;</HI> and, consequently, for the <HI>imputation</HI> of our Lord's vicarious obedience to him. His own righteousness being thus essentially necessary, must share in the honour of his justification. Surely, then, whoever is thus prepared for the benefit of an imputed righteousness, must have, in comparison with others that are not so qualified, <HI>cause of boasting.</HI></P>
<P>For, as Dr. OWEN argues,
<Q>If we are in <HI>any sense</HI> justified [by our personal righteousness] in the sight of God, we have <HI>whereof to boast</HI> before him. We may not have so <HI>absolutely,</HI> and with respect to <HI>merit;</HI> yet
<PB N="131" REF="031844_0128_0FEF1E43B73996A8"/>
we have so comparatively, and in respect of <HI>others,</HI> who cannot make the same plea for their justification. But all <HI>boasting is excluded:</HI> and it will not relieve, to say, <HI>That this personal righteousness is of the free grace and gift of God unto some, and not unto others;</HI> for we must plead it as our <HI>duty,</HI> and not as God's <HI>grace—Boasting is excluded.</HI> Apparent it is from hence, and from what [the Apostle] affirms concerning Abraham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 2.</NOTE>, that a great part, at least, of the controversy he had about justification, was, Whether it did admit of any <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in those that are justified?— <HI>Boasting,</HI> in our language, is the name of a <HI>vice,</HI> and is never taken in a good sense. But <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the words used by the Apostle, are of an indifferent signification; and, as they are applied, may denote a <HI>virtue,</HI> as well as a <HI>vice.</HI> So they do, Heb. iii. 6 <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See also Rom. xv. 17. 1 Cor, i. 31. Gal. vi. 14. with many other places.</NOTE>. But always, and in all places, they respect something that is peculiar in, or unto, whom they are ascribed. Wherever any thing is ascribed unto one, and not unto another, with respect unto any <HI>good</HI> end, there is a <HI>fundamentum <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a founda∣tion for boasting.</HI> All this, saith the Apostle, in the matter of our justification, is utterly excluded. But wherever respect is had unto any <HI>condition,</HI> or <HI>qualifica∣tion,</HI> in one more than another, especially if it be of
<PB N="132" REF="031844_0129_0FEF1E4549B30070"/>
works; it giveth <HI>a ground of boasting,</HI> as he affirmeth, Rom. iv. 2. And it appears, from comparing that Verse with this, [Rom. iii. 27.] that wherever there is <HI>any influence</HI> of our own works into our justification, there is <HI>a ground of boasting.</HI> But, in evangelical justi∣cation, no such boasting in any kind can be admitted. Wherefore, there is <HI>no place</HI> for works, in our justifica∣tion before God: for if there were, it is impossible but a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, [<HI>boasting,</HI>] in one kind or other, before God or man, must be admitted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctrine of Justification,</HI> Chap. VI.</NOTE>.</Q>
—I have enlarged the more on this particular, that the reader may perceive how nearly the principle opposed relates to the doctrine of justification; and how much this capital doctrine is corrupted by that principle.</P>
<P>Once more: Supposing it necessary for every sinner to possess more, or less, of true holiness, before he be authorised to believe in Christ; it is hard to conceive how any one ever can believe in him. This, perhaps, may appear by the following considerations. Whoever believes in Jesus, relies on him as redeeming sinners from the curse of the law, and the damnation of hell. No one, therefore, depends upon him, till convinced of sin, and apprehensive of danger. Now, as nothing but sin exposes men to present condemnation, and sinal ruin; so it is that only which renders them filthy, and
<PB N="133" REF="031844_0130_0FEF1E4832C3B270"/>
vile, and worthless. The more any one, therefore, feels his want of deliverance from <HI>the wrath to come</HI>; the more keenly sensible he must be of his complicated guilt, his great baseness, and his absolute unworthiness, in the fight of God. While, consequently, he is persuaded, that some degree of holiness is previously necessary to warrant his reliance on Jesus Christ; he must either labour to reform his life, to amend his heart, and to obtain some righteousness of his own, as the pedestal on which to stand when laying hold of Christ, or sink in despair: and, in either case, he is far from believing on the Son of God.—Thus, while earnestly desiring an interest in Christ, and considering himself as destitute of the requisite holiness, he, as the Prophet speaks, <HI>labours in the very fire,</HI> and <HI>wearies himself for very vanity.</HI> Having such views of himself, and of the character under which only he is warranted to believe in Jesus; neither the gospel, with its cheering declarations; nor the Mediator, with his immense fulness of blessings and of grace, can afford him the least relief; they being quite out of his reach. Because, till conscious of an holy disposition, or a pious turn of heart, he neither does, nor can consider himself as one toward whom the gospel wears a smiling aspect; or as authorised to take the least encouragement from it. On the hypothesis opposed, therefore, nothing but embarrassment, and painful disappointment, are likely to attend him.—But were he, by strenuous efforts, to obtain a persuasion,
<PB N="134" REF="031844_0131_0FEF1E4C7745DB48"/>
that his inclinations have taken a virtuous turn; that his internal character is greatly improved; and, under this consideration of himself, to conclude, That <HI>now</HI> he may believe in Jesus Christ; what must be thought of his conduct? Why, that he is ignorant of the gospel; that he is <HI>of the works of the law</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.</NOTE>; and, that the pains he has taken have produced a good conceit of himself, rather than prepared him for faith in Jesus Christ. So inimical to solid peace and real holiness is the sentiment which I oppose, that, according to the different state of a person's conscience, it has a natural tendency, either to <HI>elevate</HI> with selfrighteous pride, or to <HI>depress</HI> with desponding fear. The <HI>former,</HI> if the great evil of sin be not perceived, and the conscience drowsy: the <HI>latter,</HI> if the mind be enlightened, and the conscience tender. For, as Dr. OWEN has well observed,
<Q>The more spiri∣tual any man is, the more he sees of his <HI>unspiritualness</HI> in his spiritual duties <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the cxxx Psalm,</HI> p. 345.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>On this hypothesis there is, indeed, no such thing as <HI>gospel,</HI> or glad tidings, for any of those whom the Scrip∣tures denominate, <HI>sinners</HI>—the <HI>ungodly</HI>—the <HI>lost</HI>—those who are in the way to final ruin. Because, according to the principle against which I plead, all the revealed relief by Jesus Christ, is directed to those only whose hearts are under an <HI>holy hias.</HI> But the sacred Writers
<PB N="135" REF="031844_0132_0FEF1E4F80D082E8"/>
are far from pronouncing persons of that character, the <HI>ungodly,</HI> or the <HI>lost:</HI> and they are equally far from teaching, that creatures, possessing any degree of true sanctity, are in danger of eternal perdition. For it is absurd to suppose, that our divine Sovereign will ever send holiness to hell: or that the subjects of truly pious dispositions are in the road to ruin.</P>
<P>Whereas, if we consider the inspired Writings as exhibiting a full, free, and everlasting salvation, by Jesus Christ, for the chief of sinners; if we consider the testi∣mony of God concerning his incarnate Son, as a com∣plete warrant for the most guilty and ungodly to believe in him; there is a revealed foundation of hope for the vilest of men, even when they have the strongest con∣viction of that being their proper character. The word of grace, respecting the perfect work of Christ, being viewed in this light, is deservedly, and by way of sin∣gular eminence, called, THE GLAD TIDINGS. For, be the wants of a sinner ever so many, and his unworthiness ever so great, the all sufficient Jesus is presented to view, as encouraging his immediate dependence, and as rejecting none that apply to him. Agreeably to which Mr. HERVEY says;
<Q>Nothing is requisite, in order to a participation of Christ and his benefits, but <HI>a grant from God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Theron and Aspasio,</HI> Vol. II. p. 374. Note Edit. 5th.</NOTE>.</Q>
—It is not under the notion, of being

elected to everlasting life; of possessing any virtuous disposition; of being, by good habits or qualities, distinguished from other men; of being well humbled for sin; or of being deeply awakened in conscience, that sinners must first believe in Jesus. No: but as trans∣gressors; as in a perishing state; and as having nothing to preserve them from despair, except what the Scrip∣ture says concerning Christ, his offices, and his grace. It is, at least, in this view of the gospel, and of Jesus as revealed by it, that the writer of these pages either enjoys peace, or expects felicity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. OBJECTIONS ANSWERED.</HEAD>
<P>AGAINST the sentiment for which I plead, and in opposition to the course of my reasoning, it has been strenuously urged;
<Q>Repentance includes an holy disposition, and must <HI>precede</HI> faith in Christ.</Q>
—But, supposing the priority of repentance to faith were granted, it would infer no valid objection to the principle here defended: except it were proved, that repentance must precede, as constituting an essential part of the sinner's <HI>warrant</HI> to believe in Jesus. That, however, is not likely to be soon evinced.</P>
<P>In what light, then, is true repentance to be consi∣dered? As <HI>a change of mind, or after-thought?</HI> This, indeed, seems to be the literal import of the original word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: and that, we acknowledge, precedes faith in Jesus Christ. For while a sinner is either stupidly inattentive to his immortal interests, or expecting justification by his own obedience, he will not come to Christ.—As <HI>a conviction of sin,</HI> attended with apprehen∣sions of eternal ruin? This also, it is readily granted, precedes faith in Christ. For, whoever believes in Jesus,
<PB N="138" REF="031844_0135_0FEF1E5B5F697930"/>
regards him as the only Saviour from divine wrath: respecting the danger of which, a conviction of sin must precede. Nay, we are led, by the language of Scripture, to consider believing in Christ, as no other than <HI>fleeing to the hope set before us,</HI> that we may escape <HI>the wrath to come</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 18. Matt. iii. 7.</NOTE>. That conviction of sin and sense of danger, should not be considered, however, as inducing God to <HI>give,</HI> but as inclining us to <HI>receive:</HI> not as exciting the Father of mercies to forgive our offences, or the com∣passionate Jesus to justify our persons; but as impelling us to accept the provision which sovereign grace has made for the entirely destitute. Besides, neither that <HI>change of mind,</HI> nor this <HI>apprehension of danger,</HI> can be justly considered as an holy disposition: because they respect the state of the intellect, and of the conscience; not that of the <HI>heart.</HI> Or, if the heart be affected, it is no otherwise than as a new turn is given to the operation of self-love: which, simply and absolutely considered, has no holiness in it.</P>
<P>Must repentance, then, be viewed under the notion of <HI>sorrow for sin,</HI> and <HI>aversion to it,</HI> considered as an opposition to divine authority, and as a contrariety to divine purity? This, indeed, is that repentance which is connected with pardon and salvation. But then it may be justly queried, whether it was ever found in any
<PB N="139" REF="031844_0136_0FEF1E5CED0E6C80"/>
sinner before he believed in Jesus Christ: as the follow∣ing considerations, perhaps, may show.</P>
<P>Repentance, under this notion of it, is manifestly a fruit of sincere esteem for the dominion of God, and of love to his infinite excellence. Because no one can be cordially grieved for opposing a government, which he does not esteem; nor for his past aversion to excellence, which he does not admire. But the Scrip∣tures will not permit our concluding, that these pious affections are possessed by sinners, before they receive the truth, and believe in Christ. If we really love and revere God, it is <HI>because he first loved us;</HI> because <HI>there is forgiveness with him;</HI> because that love, as expressed in the gift of his own Son, and that forgiveness, through the atonement, have been more or less revealed to us, in the glad tidings of reconciliation.—All men, when their consciences are alarmed, being pained with appre∣hensions of eternal destruction, will sorrow for the <HI>conse∣quences</HI> of sin; but none besides believers in Jesus mourn over and abhor its <HI>intrinsic</HI> evil.</P>
<P>Genuine sorrow for sin, and self abasement before God, are closely connected, in ancient prophecy, with faith in the bleeding Immanuel, and with reconciliation to our offended Sovereign; rather, they are considered as <HI>effects</HI> of that faith and reconciliation. For thus it is written; <HI>I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou
<PB N="140" REF="031844_0137_0FEF1E62F08090A0"/>
shalt know that I am the Lord: that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame,</HI> WHEN I AM PACIFIED TOWARD THEE <HI>for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God—I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall</HI> LOOK UPON ME <HI>whom they have pierced, and they shall</HI> MOURN <HI>for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in</HI> BITTERNESS <HI>for him, as one that is in bitter∣ness for his first born.</HI> To which may be added the following words: <HI>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoan∣ing himself, thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chas∣tised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God. Surely,</HI> AFTER <HI>that I was turned, I repented; and</HI> AF∣TER <HI>that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xvi. 62, 63. Zech. xii. 10. Jer. xxxi. 18, 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Here we have genuine sorrow for sin, considered as rebellion against Jehovah's government, and as abhor∣rent from his purity. Here we behold a remembrance of past offences paining the conscience, and shame suffu∣sing the cheeks; confusion producing silence and grief almost breaking the heart. Whence is it, then, that inveterate rebels are thus affected, and adamantine
<PB N="141" REF="031844_0138_0FEF1E65D5B51548"/>
hearts thus melted? Not from denunciations of divine vengeance; nor from apprehensions of endless perdition: but from <HI>knowing,</HI> as taught by <HI>the Spirit of grace,</HI> the import of that sublime name, JEHOVAH <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxxiv. 5, 6, 7. Isa. xlv. 21.</NOTE>; from <HI>look∣ing</HI> to the pierced Messiah; and from God being <HI>recon∣ciled</HI> to them. Yes, not only mercy revealed to the guilty, but faith in the divine testimony, a believing regard to the dying Jesus, and conversion to God, are presented to view as producing repentance.</P>
<P>That the manifestation of divine benignity toward our apostate species, is friendly to holy sorrow; and that the exercise of human compassion towards disaffected neighbours, has a natural tendency to produce reforma∣tion, we are taught by the following remarkable words. <HI>The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance—If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 4. xii. 20.</NOTE>. Are the exercise of divine kindness, in the course of common Providence, and the puny efforts of human compassion, for the relief of distressed fellow-creatures, adapted to produce repentance and reformation in their different objects? then, surely, we may conclude, that the bound∣less benignity of God, revealed in the gospel of our sal∣vation, must be incomparably better fitted, to excite an
<PB N="142" REF="031844_0139_0FEF1E675FEDC848"/>
abhorrence of sin, conciliate the affections to God, and produce a series of holy obedience.</P>
<P>Further: True repentance is the <HI>gift</HI> of Christ, con∣sidered as the ascended Sovereign and Saviour of his church. As it is written, <HI>Him hath God exalted, with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts v. 31.</NOTE>. Repen∣tance and pardon, being here so intimately connected, and both of them represented as the gifts of Jesus Christ; we are led to conclude, that real repentance for sin, and faith in the blood of Christ, coexist; that godly sorrow supposes and includes faith in revealed mercy; and that both of them are the fruits of sovereign grace.</P>
<P>Dr. OWEN, when speaking of <HI>humiliation for sin,</HI> expresses himself as follows.
<Q>There is a respect in it to the <HI>love of God:</HI> and this breaks the heart of the poor returning sinner. Sorrow from the <HI>law,</HI> shuts itself up in the soul, and strangleth it. Sorrow from the <HI>love of God</HI> opens and causeth it to flow forth. Thoughts of sinning against the <HI>love</HI> of God, managed by the Holy Ghost, what shall I say? their effects in the heart are not to be expressed—True humility consists more in <HI>believing,</HI> than in being <HI>sensible</HI> of sin—Let there be no mistake: there can be no <HI>evangelical</HI> sense
<PB N="143" REF="031844_0140_0FEF1E6A59CD7FD0"/>
of sin, and humiliation for it, where there is not <HI>union</HI> with Christ. Zech. xii. 10—It is the soul's appli∣cation to God for <HI>forgiveness,</HI> and not its sense of sin, that gives unto God the glory of his grace—No repen∣tance is acceptable with God, but what is built, or leans, on the faith of forgiveness—God expressly declares in the Scripture, that <HI>the forgiveness that is with him,</HI> is the foundation of his prescribing repen∣tance unto man. One instance may suffice, Isa. lv. 7 —<HI>Legal</HI> repentance, which precedes gospel faith, and is without it, is neither a disposition, preparation, nor condition of our justification <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the Hundred and Thirtieth Psalm,</HI> p. 54, 63, 64, 137. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>0. <HI>Doctrine of Justification,</HI> Chap. I.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus Mr. JAMES HERVEY:
<Q><HI>Repent ye, and believe the gospel.</HI> This may be the meaning of the exhortation. <HI>Repent;</HI> relinquish all your wrong notions, relating to the way and manner of finding acceptance with the Deity▪ <HI>Believe the gospel;</HI> which opens a most unex∣pected avenue, for the communication of this blessing. Which brings you glad tidings of a salvation, fully procured by the incarnate God, and freely offered to the unworthy sinner. The word, you know, is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: which, in its primary signification, denotes not so much a reformation of conduct, as a change of sentiment.—Suppose it to signify a reformation of
<PB N="144" REF="031844_0141_0FEF1E702EAD9D90"/>
conduct; the meaning then may be as follows. <HI>Repent;</HI> forsake all your vices, and all your follies; mortify every evil temper, and renounce every evil way. In order to render this practicable, <HI>believe the gospel;</HI> wherein a Saviour is preached and displayed. Who makes peace for such offenders; reconciles them to God; and obtains eternal redemption for them. This will sweetly withdraw your affections from iniquity, and sweetly attach them to the blessed God. Whereas, without this powerful expedient, you will never be delivered from the pleasing witchcraft of your lusts. Sin will always have the dominion over you, so long as you are <HI>under the law,</HI> and not <HI>under grace.</HI> Repentance, thus understood, is not the <HI>condition</HI> of obtaining salvation, but the fruit of <HI>salvation itself—I came, not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</HI> Many persons, I am apt to suspect, mistake the meaning of this sweet passage; and turn the <HI>freely flowing</HI> benefits of the gospel, into the <HI>rigorous</HI> requirements of the law. They reckon, our Lord's calling to repentance, is like a schoolmaster calling the youths to their task; or like a householder calling his servants to their work. Whereas, it is like Joseph, the governor of Egypt, calling his brethren, each to receive a suit of apparel, and all to partake of his hospitable banquet. Christ, as a Saviour, is the greatest of benefactors. When, therefore, he calls to repentance, his intention is, not to demand, but to bestow; not to enjoin, but
<PB N="145" REF="031844_0142_0FEF1E731B8B0A68"/>
to impart. <HI>He is exalted,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>to give repentance</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eleven Letters to Mr. J.</HI> WESLEY, p. 114. 115. <HI>Theron and Aspasio,</HI> Vol. III. p. 330, 331. <HI>Note,</HI> Edit. 5th.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus Mr. THOMAS BOSTON;
<Q>The subject of true repentance is a <HI>convinced, believing,</HI> soul. An <HI>uncon∣vinced</HI> sinner cannot be a true penitent; for what the eye sees not, the heart rues not. Neither can an <HI>unbelieving</HI> sinner be so; for without faith the heart may be rent <HI>for</HI> sin, but not <HI>from</HI> it—Faith is the spring and source of repentance: so that though the graces of faith and repentance are given together and at once, in respect of <HI>time;</HI> yet, in the order of <HI>na∣ture,</HI> faith goes before repentance, and the acting of faith goes before the exercise of repentance; and he that would repent, must first believe in Christ, that he may repent—Then, it is not gospel doctrine, <HI>That Christ will receive none but true penitents;</HI> or that none but such have a warrant to embrace Christ, by faith— For sensible sinners to think that they dare not, and ought not, to believe and embrace Christ, till they be more deeply humbled, and do more thoroughly repent of their sins and, in a word, be <HI>more fit</HI> to receive him: is but a gilded deceit, and a trick of the false heart—The more faith, the more repentance; as, the fuller the spring is, the streams run with the more vigorous current <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Works,</HI> p. 608, 609, 610.

<P><PB N="146" REF="031844_0143_0FEF1E749FC85E28"/>It is objected,
<Q>Though it be not necessary for a sinner to <HI>know</HI> that he is born again, before he believe in Jesus Christ; yet <HI>regeneration itself</HI> must precede faith. For the heart of a sinner being naturally in a state of enmity to the divine Character, he will never turn to God, while in that situation, for pardon and acceptance.</Q>
—In answer to which, the following par∣ticulars are proposed for consideration.</P>
<P>Before this objection can be justly considered as valid, it must be evinced, not only, that regeneration <HI>precedes</HI> faith; but also that it is necessary to <HI>authorise</HI> a sinner's reliance on Jesus Christ, than which, few sentiments are more foreign from the genuine gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Regeneration must precede faith.</HI> This, though assumed as a certain fact, may be justly doubted: for the page of Inspiration does not warrant our supposing, that any one is born of God, <HI>before</HI> he believes in Jesus Christ; or, that regeneration is effected by the Holy Spirit, <HI>without</HI> the word of grace. For we are taught, by the sacred Writers, to consider the word of truth, with regard to adults, as the mean of regeneration, and of many other happy effects. They teach, for instance, <HI>That it is the instrument of enlightening the mind, of awak∣ening the conscience, and of softening the heart.</HI>

<P><PB N="150" REF="031844_0147_0FEF1E7F55B4C340"/>Such is the language of Inspiration, relative to the high importance of revealed truth, in the great plan of salvation by Jesus Christ! Hence it appears, that few things are more evidently contained, or more strongly asserted in Scripture, than the instrumentality of divine truth in the <HI>regeneration</HI> of sinners. It is there described as the honoured mean, as <HI>the seed of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 23, 24, 25. 1 John iii. 9.</NOTE>, by which the Holy Spirit effects the regeneration, the sanctifica∣tion, and the consolation of those that are saved. But it is impossible for us to conceive of the mind being enlightened, of the conscience being relieved, of the will being regulated, and of the affections being purified, by the word of truth, any further than it is believed.— I conclude, therefore, that regeneration is not, in order of time, previous to faith in Christ. Consequently, as they are the <HI>ungodly</HI> whom the Spirit regenerates by the truth, so persons of that character are warranted to believe in Jesus.</P>
<P><HI>It is not requisite for a sinner to</HI> KNOW <HI>that he is born again, before he believe in Jesus Christ.</HI> But, if it be a fact, that regeneration <HI>itself</HI> is previously necessary to faith in Christ; whoever is persuaded of that fact, and ardently concerned about his eternal happiness, cannot forbear to investigate the state of his own soul, respecting regeneration, with much the same solicitude as if he
<PB N="151" REF="031844_0148_0FEF1E824BFB7D58"/>
considered being born again, under the notion of his <HI>warrant</HI> to rely on Jesus Christ: and thus his conscience must unavoidably be embarrassed, respecting his permission to believe, until he become persuaded of his regeneration. Nay, on supposition that the heart must be renewed, previous to believing the gospel, and to any degree of dependence upon the atonement; it seems as if sinners <HI>ought</HI> always to inquire into the state of their own hearts, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have <HI>evidence</HI> of their being renewed by divine influence, before they can, without presumption, expect the least benefit from Jesus Christ.—I said, <HI>without presumption.</HI> For, according to the sentiment here opposed, it would be <HI>presumption</HI>—it would argue a <HI>criminal forwardness,</HI> in any one to rely on Christ for acceptance with God, before he perceived the marks of regeneration attending his tempers and conduct.—It is readily granted, that the hearts of sinners are, by nature, <HI>strongly disaffected</HI> to the divine Character; and that, while under the power of this enmity, they are far from God. But the energy of the Spirit applying the word of reconciliation to their hearts, the truth is believed, and their enmity subdued, in the same instant. According to that saying, <HI>Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free</HI>—free, from guilt on your consciences, and from reigning enmity in your hearts.</P>
<P>Still further to prove and illustrate the instrumentality of divine truth, in the regeneration and sanctification of
<PB N="152" REF="031844_0149_0FEF1E86E0487338"/>
sinners, the following quotations are pertinent. Thus Mr. CHARNOCK:
<Q>We are new-created by the Spirit of God infusing faith into us—Faith is of absolute necessity to regeneration—<HI>The gospel is the instrument whereby God brings the soul forth in a new birth.</HI> The scripture doth distinguish the efficient and instrumental cause, by the prepositions <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. When we are said to be <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> it is (John iii. 5.) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (1 John iii. 9.) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; (1 John v. 1.) never <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: but we are no where said to be born OF <HI>the word,</HI> or begotten <HI>of the word;</HI> but <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>by,</HI> or <HI>with, the word,</HI> (1 Pet i. 23.) and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (1 Cor. iv. 15.) I have begotten you <HI>through the gospel.</HI> The preposition <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, usually denotes the <HI>efficient,</HI> or material cause; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>instru∣ment,</HI> or means, by which a thing is wrought. Sin entered into the heart of Eve by the word of the devil; grace enters into the heart by the word of God. That entered by a word of error; this by a word of truth. <HI>Ye are clean through the word I have spoken to you:</HI> (John xv. 3.) whereby our Saviour means the word outwardly preached by him; for it was the word <HI>spoken</HI> by him. Not that it had this efficacy of itself, but as an instrument of their sanctification, rendering them ready to every good work. The holiness therefore which it begets, is called the <HI>holiness of truth:</HI> (Eph. iv. 24.) opposed to the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>lusts of deceit,</HI> Verse the twenty-second. Lusts grow up from
<PB N="153" REF="031844_0150_0FEF1E8B25436208"/>
error and deceit; and holiness of the new man grows up from truth—If the Spirit quicken, [or excite spiritual diligence,] it is by some gospel precept; if it comforts, it is by some gospel promise; if it startles, it is by some threatening in the word: whatsoever working there is in a Christian's heart, it is by some word dropping upon it—The Spirit makes the word, not only the fire to kindle the soul, but the bellows to blow: it is first <HI>life,</HI> then <HI>liveliness</HI> to the soul. It is through the word he begets us, and through the word he quickens us: <HI>Thy word hath quickened me.</HI> It is by the <HI>word</HI> God gathers a church in the world; by the same <HI>word</HI> he sanctifies it to greater degrees. (Eph. v. 26.) It is the <HI>seed</HI> whereby we are born; the <HI>dew</HI> whereby we are refreshed. As it is the seed of our birth, so it is the <HI>milk of our growth,</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 2.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Works,</HI> Vol, II. p. 43, 509, 155, 158. Edit. 2d.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus Dr. OWEN:
<Q>This [regeneration] is wrought by the <HI>word.</HI> 1 Pet. i. 23. <HI>We are born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God.</HI> Wherein, not only the <HI>thing itself,</HI> of our regeneration by the word, but the <HI>manner</HI> of it also, is declared. It is by the collation of a new spiritual life upon us, whereof the word is the seed. As every life proceeds from some seed, that hath in itself virtually the whole life to be educed from it, by natural ways
<PB N="154" REF="031844_0151_0FEF1E8E0A4D2D30"/>
and means; so the word in the hearts of men, is turned into a vital principle, that, cherished by suitable means, puts forth vital acts and operations. By this means we are <HI>born of God,</HI> and quickened, who <HI>by nature, are children of wrath; dead in trespasses and sins.</HI> So Paul tells the Corinthians, that he had <HI>begotten them, in Jesus Christ, by the gospel</HI>—It is the instrument of God for this end; and mighty and powerful, through God, it is for the accomplishment of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On Heb.</HI> ii. 2, 3, 4. p. 178.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The same excellent Author, when speaking of <HI>sanc∣tification</HI> by the truth, says:
<Q>There is a great answera∣bleness and correspondency, between the <HI>heart</HI> of a believer, and the <HI>truth</HI> that he doth believe. As the word, is in the gospel, so is grace in the heart: yea, they are the <HI>same thing</HI> variously expressed. (Rom. vi. 17.) <HI>You have obeyed from the heart, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the form of doctrine delivered unto you.</HI> As our Translation doth not, so I know not how, in so few words, to express that which is <HI>emphatically</HI> here insinuated by the Holy Ghost. The meaning is, that the doctrine of the gospel begets the <HI>form, figure, image,</HI> or <HI>likeness</HI> of itself, in the hearts of them that believe. So they are cast into the <HI>mould</HI> of it. As is the one, so is the other. The principle of <HI>grace</HI> in the heart, and that in the <HI>word,</HI> are as children of
<PB N="155" REF="031844_0152_0FEF1E90F4BCC350"/>
the same parent, completely resembling and represent∣ing one another. Grace is a <HI>living word,</HI> and the word is <HI>figured, limned grace.</HI> As is regeneration, so is a regenerate heart: as is the doctrine of faith, so is a believer. And this gives great evidence unto, and assurance of the things believed—First, the <HI>truth is in Jesus:</HI> then it is expressed in the word. This word, learned and believed, becomes grace in the heart, every way answering unto the Lord Christ his <HI>image,</HI> from whom this <HI>transforming truth</HI> did thus proceed. Nay, this is carried by the Apostle yet higher, namely, unto God the Father himself, whose image Christ is, and believers his, through the word, 2 Cor. iii. 18. iv. 6 —Regeneration doth not, in order of time, precede the soul's interest in the forgiveness that is with God, or its being made partaker of the pardon of sin. I say no more but that it doth not precede it in order of <HI>time;</HI> not determining which hath precedency in order of <HI>nature.</HI> That, I confess, which the method of the gospel leads unto, is, That absolution, acquitment, or the pardon of sin, is <HI>the foundation</HI> of the communi∣cation of all saving grace unto the soul; and so <HI>pre∣cedeth</HI> all grace in the sinner whatever—It is hence evident, that an assurance of being regenerate, is no way previously necessary unto the believing of an inter∣est in forgiveness; so that although a man have not the former, it is, or may be, his duty to endeavour the latter. When convinced persons cried out, <HI>What
<PB N="156" REF="031844_0153_0FEF1E96D64B7178"/>
shall we do to be saved?</HI> the answer was, <HI>Believe, and and you shall be so.</HI> Believe in Christ, and in the remis∣sion of sin by his blood, is the <HI>first</HI> thing that convinced sinners are called unto. They are not directed first to secure their souls that <HI>they are born again,</HI> and then afterwards to believe. But they are first to believe, that the remission of sin is tendered to them in the blood of Christ; and that by him they may be justified from all things, from which they could not be justified by the law. Nor, upon this proposition, is it the duty of men to question whether they have faith, or no, but actually to believe; and faith, in its operation, will evidence itself. See Acts xiii. 38, 39 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the Hundred and Thirtieth Psalm,</HI> p. 160, 161, 339, 340.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Again, he says:
<Q>The whole matter of sanctification and holiness is peculiarly joined with, and limited unto, the <HI>doctrine, truth,</HI> and <HI>grace</HI> of the gospel: for holiness is nothing, but the implanting, writing, and realising of the gospel in our souls. Hence it is termed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (Eph. iv. 24.) <HI>The holiness of truth;</HI> which the truth of the gospel ingenerates, and which consists in a conformity thereunto: and the gospel itself is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (Tit. i. 1.) <HI>The truth which is according to godliness;</HI> which declares that godliness and holiness which God requireth. The prayer also of our Saviour, for our sanctification, is
<PB N="157" REF="031844_0154_0FEF1E99CD3A5A40"/>
conformed thereunto, (John xvii. 17.) <HI>Sanctify them in</HI> (or <HI>by) thy truth; thy word is truth:</HI> and he sanc∣tified himself for us, to be a sacrifice, that we <HI>might be sanctified in the truth.</HI> This alone is that <HI>truth</HI> which makes us free; (John viii. 12.) that is, from sin and the law, unto righteousness in holiness. It belongs neither to nature, nor the law, so as to proceed from them, or to be effected by them—There neither is, nor ever was in the world, nor ever shall be, the least dram of holiness, but what, flowing from Jesus Christ, is communicated by the Spirit, according to the <HI>truth and promise</HI> of the gospel. There may be something <HI>like</HI> it, as to its outward acts and effects, (at least, some of them;) something that may wear its livery in the world, that is but the fruit of men's own endeavours, in compliance with their convictions; but <HI>holiness</HI> it is not, nor of the same kind or nature with it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Discourse concerning the Holy Spirit,</HI> B. IV. Chap, i. § 8. See Mr. T. SCOTT's <HI>Essays on the most Important Subjects in Reli∣gion,</HI> p. 21.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Respecting the word of truth as the instrument of regeneration, it has, to the following purpose, been objected:
<Q>They who consider divine truth as the mean of regeneration must grant, that it is by the Holy Spirit the word is introduced into the mind, in order to its having such an effect—That some operation of
<PB N="158" REF="031844_0155_0FEF1E9B5387A240"/>
the Spirit on the understanding takes place, in order so to <HI>change</HI> it, as to receive the word—And, that this operation <HI>precedes</HI> the entrance of light into the mind. Consequently, that the <HI>change</HI> by which the mind is prepared to receive the light, is not effected by means of the word: and yet, in that very change men are <HI>born of the Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. S. HOPKINS's <HI>Two Discourses,</HI> p. 112, 113.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>According to this view of the subject, the word of truth, having no influence, is of <HI>no use,</HI> in the work of regeneration; the salutary and important change being produced entirely without it. Either, therefore, by those expressions, <HI>born again,</HI> the objector must intend something very different from what is meant by them in Scripture; or he is not far from contradicting the express determination of inspired Writers: as appears by various passages already adduced—To imagine that a preparation of the <HI>mind,</HI> merely to receive the truth, is a change so great as to answer those emphatical expressions, <HI>regeneration, born again, born of the Spirit, born of God,</HI> and <HI>a new heart;</HI> is, I think, very unwar∣rantable. Because, on that supposition, the change denoted by being <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> takes place merely in the <HI>intellect,</HI> or thinking faculty; not at all in the <HI>will,</HI> or the <HI>heart.</HI> But, whatever light any person may have in his mind, the Scriptures never teach us to consider
<PB N="159" REF="031844_0156_0FEF1E9CDB85C2D8"/>
him as <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> except his heart be renewed, so as to love God and approve of his ways. Nay, the Author himself confirms my assertion, by elsewhere saying;
<Q>This regeneration of which I am speaking consists in a change of the <HI>will,</HI> or <HI>heart</HI>—I have good grounds to assert, that in regeneration the <HI>will,</HI> or <HI>heart</HI> is the <HI>immediate subject</HI> of the divine operation, and so of the moral change that is effected thereby <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 57, 58.</NOTE>.</Q>
<HI>Though I—understand all mysteries, and all knowledge,— and have not love, I am nothing.</HI> The glorious God, however, is not loved by apostate creatures, unless as revealed in Jesus Christ, and by the gospel.</P>
<P>It is too hastily assumed, that the mind is <HI>prepared</HI> to receive the light of spiritual knowledge, previous to the truth having any influence upon it. For, may not the Holy Spirit, without any antecedent operation, apply divine truth, or the sense and meaning of the word; so as to enlighten the understanding, impress the conscience, and affect the heart? May not that omnipotent Agent, without any previous preparation, attend his own word with such energy, as to irradiate the mind, subdue the will, and give a new turn to the whole soul? Nay, do not the scriptural passages already produced, naturally lead us to conclude, that this, with regard to regenera∣tion, is a fact? If there be not an aptitude in the word of
<PB N="160" REF="031844_0157_0FEF1E9E68405A10"/>
truth, as an instrument in the hand of God, to produce this great moral change, why is that word compared to <HI>light,</HI> called a <HI>two-edged sword,</HI> and represented as giving <HI>life?</HI> When the Apostle says, <HI>I had not known sin but</HI> BY <HI>the law;</HI> and, <HI>the law worketh wrath</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 7. iv. 15.</NOTE>; does he not intend to inform us, that the divine precepts, and their awful sanction, are <HI>means</HI> by which the Holy Spirit convinces of sin, and alarms the conscience? So, when David says, <HI>Thy word hath quickened me;</HI> and when our Lord prays, <HI>Sanctify them through thy truth</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxix. 50. John xvii. 17, 19.</NOTE>; must we not consider them as teaching, that the word of grace is the mean of producing comfort, and of pro∣moting holiness? When Paul speaks of life and immor∣tality being <HI>brought to light by (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) the gospel;</HI> and of Gentiles being made partakers of <HI>the promise in Christ by the gospel</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i. 10. Eph. iii. 6.</NOTE>; does he not intend to represent the doc∣trine of redemption by Jesus Christ, as the <HI>great mean</HI> by which that light, and this promise, came to be enjoyed by us? Why, then, should we affix a different sense to similar language, respecting the work of regeneration, in the texts before adduced, from the writings of Paul, of James, and of Peter? Why, when the word of truth, or the gospel of divine grace, is represented as that by which sinners are <HI>born again</HI>—as the very <HI>seed</HI> of regene∣ration —should the words receive a qualified interpre∣tation;
<PB N="161" REF="031844_0158_0FEF1EA2C8963A18"/>
so as to mean something, which the Author to whom I advert does not consider as regeneration, <HI>pro∣perly</HI> so called?—To be OF <HI>the truth;</HI> TO be OF <HI>faith;</HI> and to be OF <HI>God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xviii. 37. 1 John iii. 19. Gal. iii. 9. John viii. 47. 1 John iii. 10. iv. 3, 6. v. 19. 3 John 11.</NOTE>; are various forms of expression, to exhibit the same spiritual character in different points of light. Is any one represented as OF <HI>GOD?</HI> he is to be viewed as <HI>born of the Spirit.</HI> Is he said to be OF <HI>faith?</HI> we must regard him as <HI>believing in Jesus.</HI> Is he described as OF <HI>the truth?</HI> we must consider him as having <HI>received the gospel,</HI> and as living under its influ∣ence. But, according to the objection under our notice, a person may be OF <HI>God,</HI> yet neither be OF <HI>faith,</HI> nor OF <HI>the truth.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, for an awakened sinner to be persuaded, that regeneration is prior to faith in Jesus, and that it is effected without the instrumentality of divine truth; is adapted to give an injurious direction to his <HI>prayers</HI> and his <HI>expectations,</HI> respecting that affair. The <HI>former:</HI> because if he pray agreeably to that idea, it will be for something under the notion of regeneration, in which the knowledge of Christ, and a regard to his atonement, have no concern. Consequently, for something which leaves him at a distance from wisdom, and from happi∣ness. —The <HI>latter:</HI> because, neglecting the testimony
<PB N="162" REF="031844_0159_0FEF1EA5D3E47010"/>
of God concerning Jesus, he will be ready to look for some secret, and enthusiastical impulse, to produce the important change. Two evils, these, of no small con∣sequence, in whomsoever they are found.</P>
<P>Once more: This Author himself, I think, must admit, that Satan laid the foundation of his kingdom among men, by the use of language replete with infernal falsehood. But, if so, it cannot be absurd to maintain, that the spiritual dominion of Christ, in the hearts of sinners, commences under the salutary operation of divine truth. If the father of lies, by words of deceit, without any previous physical influence on the mental powers, polluted the imagination, obscured the under∣standing, and corrupted the heart of Eve, when in her primitive state, and under a strong bias to obedience; which, I presume, this Writer will acknowledge: why should he deny, that the Holy Spirit, by the word of truth, without any preparatory agency on the soul, enlightens the mind, impresses the conscience, and gives a new turn to the heart, of one that is dead in sin?</P>
<P>That our first parents, in their innocent state, were under a powerful predilection for whatever was morally right, must be allowed; except we deny their being created in a state of complete rectitude: and that no divine agency upon their minds, or their will, was employed to produce a compliance with Satan's temp∣tation,
<PB N="163" REF="031844_0160_0FEF1EA8C4DB8F90"/>
must be granted; unless the Most Holy be impi∣ously considered as the author of sin. The propensities of their nature, therefore, in favour of communion with God, and of obedience to him, we may justly conclude, were not less powerful than those in the hearts of their degenerate offspring are, to objects quite the reverse. Consequently, as the first inclination to evil, in the human heart, when perfectly pure, was produced, with∣out any previous physical influence, by the lie of Satan; we are led, by analogy, equally as by the language of Scripture, to consider the first holy tendency, in a heart that is totally corrupt, as produced by the truth of God, without any preparatory agency.</P>
<P>This argument from analogy is the more observable, as it arises from the only fact of the kind, that ever did, or ever will take place among men. It may be rendered more conclusive, however, by remarking, that though the Scriptures teach us to consider depravity as first produced in the holy hearts of our paradisiacal proge∣nitors, <HI>merely</HI> by the operation of Satan's falsehood; yet the same infallible Writings lead us to conclude, that evangelical truth is only the <HI>mean</HI> of renewing depraved hearts, or of turning them to God. Were it demon∣strated, therefore, that the vigour of holy tendencies, in the pure nature of our original parents, was much less than that of depravity, in the hearts of their poste∣rity; we might, nevertheless, adopt a principal of rea∣soning
<PB N="164" REF="031844_0161_0FEF1EAE762AC2A0"/>
repeatedly employed in the writings of Paul, and say: If the language of deceit, from the lying lips of Satan, without any previous influence, was capable of corrupting an holy heart, and of producing actual disobedience; <HI>much more</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 9, 10, 15, 17.

<PB N="165" REF="031844_0162_0FEF1EB186BD5398"/>
whence is that knowledge of the divine character to be derived? From the glad tidings of salvation? That is contrary to the principle on which this Author manifestly here proceeds. For, according to his theology, the divine character must be known and approved, <HI>before</HI> the gospel be either known or understood—before we have the least spiritual acquaintance with Jesus, or any dependence on his atoning death, for pardon and peace. This, however, is apparently contrary to the following divine declarations. <HI>No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son</HI> WILL REVEAL HIM—<HI>The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father,</HI> HE HATH DECLARED HIM—<HI>To give the knowledge of the glory of God,</HI> IN THE FACE OF JESUS CHRIST—<HI>We all, in an unveiled face</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, <HI>beholding as in a glass</HI> THE GLORY OF THE LORD, <HI>are changed into the same image</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. xi. 27.

But, were the position on which I animadvert founded in fact, we should have little occasion for the glad tidings of salvation, and the death of Jesus, in order to learn the true character of God.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="031844_0163_0FEF1EB30ECE6BA8"/>Whence, then, if not from the doctrine of redemp∣tion, is the knowledge under consideration to be derived? Not, surely, from the works of <HI>creation,</HI> and of <HI>common Providence.</HI> For then, with the ancient Heathens, we must <HI>seek the Lord, if haply</HI> we may <HI>feel after him,</HI> like men groping in darkness, that we may <HI>find him</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 27.</NOTE>.—Or, must sinners, by studying the absolute purity, the exten∣sive demands, and the tremendous curse of Jehovah's <HI>law,</HI> become acquainted with the divine character? This, indeed, seems to be our Author's meaning: and it is readily granted, that the true nature of the law being well understood, furnishes, <HI>in certain respects,</HI> a knowledge of the divine character. For, by that system of moral duty, and its penal sanction, we are informed of the absolute dominion, the flaming purity, and the punishing justice of God. These, however, constitute only a <HI>part</HI> of his character: and we must either know more of his peerless excellence, and supreme perfection, than the law reveals, or have neither confidence in him, nor peace of conscience—neither hope, nor holiness.</P>
<P>The character of God which must be known, in order to our present sanctification and future happiness, reveals much more of his eternal excellence than is dis∣played in the moral precepts, and in their awful sanction. For they who are not acquainted with this character,

except so far as the violated law has taught them; have no more knowledge of it than Adam had, immediately after his first offence, and before divine mercy was re∣vealed. Our original father, at that unhappy moment, knew enough of his Maker's character to fill him with terror, and to drive him from the divine presence; but nothing at all that excited esteem or veneration, confi∣dence or love; nor yet repentance, or genuine sorrow for sin, and self-abasement before his affronted Sovereign. For we find that he, and his partner in disobedience, were thoroughly disposed, had it been in their power, to have exculpated themselves, by charging the blame upon others. <HI>The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree—The serpent beguiled me</HI>— were their pleas; without any confession of guilt, or any petition for pardon. Having no knowledge of the divine character, besides that which suited the law of their creation, and their state of innocence, they could have no hope, till mercy was revealed: and, among sinners, where there is <HI>no</HI> hope, there is no holiness—no abhor∣rence of sin, as to its intrinsic evil; nor any genuine self-abasement before God.

Now, in these ancient oracles, which expressly declare the divine character, that character appears to be as rich with sovereign grace, as it is bright with eternal holiness; and as alluring with pardoning mercy as it is tremendous with punishing justice. But where, except in the cross of Christ, are the grace and holiness, the mercy and justice of God, united and realised, according to the venerable import of these characters? Or how, except by the doctrine of redemption, shall we behold the cross of Christ, as exhibiting the divine character? Such, however, is that Name, by which the Great Invisible will be known by all his people: under which Name, he will be trusted and loved, adored and obeyed.</P>
<P>The following declarations also, enter deeply into the divine character, as revealed to the ancient Jewish church. <HI>Thou art a God of pardons; gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness—There is forgiveness with Thee that thou mayest be feared</HI>: and it is with a direct view to the divine character as thus described, that the people of God are heard, in a transport of joy, to exclaim; <HI>Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because

In each of these delightful and comprehensive sayings, the Apostle has a direct regard to those discoveries which the Eternal has made of himself in the work of redemption by Jesus Christ.—<HI>God is</HI> LIGHT; <HI>God is</HI> LOVE. These two ideas united, constitute a character supremely beautiful, and supremely venerable—a character, which encourages confidence, excites hope, and commands reverence. This character expresses, in the most sublime and concise manner, the import of those ancient oracles already produced, from the writings of Moses, and of Isaiah. <HI>They that know God,</HI> as thus revealed, <HI>will put their trust in him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="031844_0169_0FEF1EC666AD17B0"/><HI>Sinners must approve the divine character—must be heartily reconciled to God and his law; before they can be reconciled to the grace of God through Christ.</HI> But, if they be so reconciled, previous to believing in Jesus, and to a view of revealed mercy, it should seem as if they had not much occasion for either faith, or grace, or Christ. Because it must be admitted, that persons of such piety are already accepted of God, bear his image, and are in the way to heaven. A small degree of assistance from Christ, and from grace, may be neces∣sary, perhaps, to <HI>expedite</HI> their progress in the heavenly road; on which, without regarding sovereign mercy and atoning blood, they have so happily entered; and to render them a little more <HI>comfortable</HI> under the afflictions with which they meet. But, certainly, as they already approve the divine character, and have made such advances in sanctification; they cannot believe in Christ as justifying the <HI>ungodly,</HI> nor consider themselves as entirely unworthy. Because, on a comparison with unregenerate persons, who have always constituted a vast majority of mankind, their moral worth is very great. For they who <HI>approve</HI> the divine character, and are <HI>heartily</HI> reconciled to God and his law, must be viewed by all the world, as the <HI>cordial friends,</HI> and the <HI>willing servants</HI> of God.—On the principles of this Author, therefore, we may safely assert, that their hearts are holy, their character honourable, and their state secure, without any dependence on sovereign grace,
<PB N="173" REF="031844_0170_0FEF1EC94FEFF0D8"/>
and without believing in the great Mediator: so that they are actually in the way to heaven, without regarding either grace, or Christ. Eternal election does not more firmly ascertain the future holiness of its objects, than being '<HI>heartily</HI> reconciled to God in his law,' secures the everlasting felicity of all those to whom that charac∣ter belongs, Because, being so reconciled, they are in possession of that <HI>holiness,</HI> without which, <HI>no one shall see the Lord:</HI> and, consequently, in a state of preparation for the heavenly world. There is not, there cannot be any more danger of God abandoning those to ever∣lasting perdition, who are become his cordial friends; than there is of his reversing the decree of election. Are multitudes of our species under a divine curse? it is as <HI>rebels</HI> against God, as habitually <HI>disapproving</HI> of his character, and as <HI>disaffected</HI> to his law. Are numbers consigned over to final ruin? it is as <HI>enemies</HI> to God, as <HI>hating</HI> his character, and as <HI>averse</HI> to his government. For, as a certain writer says,
<Q>Nothing that loves God can perish.</Q></P>
<P>Nor, on our Author's principles, is it only in a <HI>future</HI> state, that the characters under consideration are sure of blessedness. For, previous to any reliance, either on divine grace, or on Jesus Christ; and even before they are <HI>permitted</HI> to rely on the one or the other; they must have a considerable degree of true happiness. Because it seems impossible for any reasonable creature to be
<PB N="174" REF="031844_0171_0FEF1ECADA1EA158"/>
really miserable, wherever he exist, while he
<Q><HI>approves</HI> the divine character, and is <HI>heartily</HI> reconciled to God and his law.</Q>
For such an one <HI>voluntarily sanctifies</HI> the name, the perfection, the government of God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lev. x. 3. Isa. viii. 13. xxix. 23. 1 Pet. iii. 15.</NOTE>. He sincerely unites with saints on earth, and with angels in heaven, in loving and adoring the Supreme. As a sincere approbation of the character and govern∣ment of God is, in every stage of our existence, essential to human happiness; and as, wherever, in the wide creation, such an holy approbation is more or less wanting, there is a proportional degree of guilt and misery; so happiness is, by divine constitution, attached to that approbation, and must attend the person who 'is <HI>heartily</HI> reconciled to God and his law.'—Nor is this the language of mere theory: for every believer knows by experience, that, whatever his afflictions and trials may be, he always feels himself happy, when con∣scious of his being
<Q>heartily reconciled to God and his law.</Q>
While that is the case, he imitates our Perfect Pattern; and his language is, <HI>Not my will, but thine be done.</HI> But the supposition of any one so approving the divine character, being so reconciled to the government of God, and <HI>sanctifying the Lord God in his heart,</HI> before he believes the gracious gospel, or depends on Jesus Christ, is an opinion absolutely unfounded.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="031844_0172_0FEF1ECDCBB183D8"/>The reason of an holy disposition, or a virtuous turn of heart, being requisite, previous to faith in Jesus Christ, is thus expressed.
<Q>The necessity of the sinner's exer∣cising virtue, antecedent to his justification, and in order to it, is not because he needs any worthiness of his own, or can have any; but because by this alone can his heart be so united to the Mediator, as to be the proper ground of his being looked upon and treated as so far One with him, as that his merit and righte∣ousness may be properly imputed to him, or reckoned in his favour, so as to avail for his pardon and justification<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. S. HOPKINS's <HI>Two Discourses,</HI> p. 32, 33. <HI>Note.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>That the principle which I oppose has a natural ten∣dency to feed self-righteous hope, in the heart of a formalist, and to harrass the awakened sinner with des∣ponding fear, has been already observed. This pernicious tendency principally arises, from its corrupt∣ing the doctrine of justification before God. For, under the influence of this anti-evangelical sentiment, our Author very plainly maintains, That something besides the righteousness of Christ, as revealed in the gospel, and freely imputed to him that believes, is absolutely neces∣sary to justification. That <HI>something,</HI> he tells us, is <HI>virtue,</HI> and the <HI>exercise</HI> of it—to an <HI>eminent</HI> degree; as we have seen under the last objection. This virtue he expressly pronounces necessary, <HI>antecedent,</HI> and <HI>in order</HI> to justification. But if so, the Most High does
<PB N="176" REF="031844_0173_0FEF1ED3BA7AFA50"/>
not, as Paul represents him, justify the <HI>ungodly</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. No: it is the sinner as become truly <HI>virtuous,</HI> or as possessed of moral worth.—In strong contradiction to himself, however, this Writer says; Not that the sinner '<HI>needs</HI> any worthiness of his own, or can have any.' But, is nothing to be called <HI>worthiness,</HI> which does not enable a man to claim acceptance with God, as a <HI>legal debt?</HI> Or is he ashamed of the term <HI>worthiness,</HI> while he retains the thing? For what is the <HI>exercise of virtue?</HI> what is an <HI>approbation</HI> of the divine character? what is an <HI>hearty reconciliation</HI> to God and his law, but moral <HI>worthiness?</HI> Whatever our Author may think or say of these things, the generality of others, I doubt not, will consider them as exceedingly amiable, as morally excellent, as worthy the greatest saint, and as highly approved by the Most Holy.—While this Author utterly renounces the doc∣trine of Roman Catholics, respecting the merit of <HI>condig∣nity</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Two Discourses,</HI> p. 30, 31. <HI>Note.</HI></NOTE>; he seems to approve their notion of merit, with regard to <HI>congruity.</HI> That notion, however, was held in detestation by our old Protestant writers, both Lu∣therans and Calvinists, as inimical to the doctrine of Scripture; and is deservedly exploded by the <HI>Thirteenth Article</HI> of the Church of England.</P>
<P><HI>It is</HI> ONLY <HI>by the exercise of this virtue, that the heart of a sinner can be so united to Christ, as to be the ground of
<PB N="177" REF="031844_0174_0FEF1ED69DEA1C90"/>
his righteousness being imputed, for pardon and justification.</HI> The only ground, then, on which our Lord's obedience can be imputed to sinners, is,—not their having been <HI>chosen</HI> in him, before the foundation of the world; not his <HI>relation</HI> to them, under the character of a substitute; nor the <HI>vicarious</HI> nature of his perfect work; but, their own <HI>virtue,</HI> their excellent <HI>moral qualities,</HI> or the <HI>good∣ness</HI> of their own hearts in cleaving to Jesus Christ! Yes, they having the <HI>virtue</HI> to esteem Christ, God has the <HI>benignity</HI> to love them. But, as their virtue is not quite complete, he, to manifest his delight in virtue, and to supply its imperfections, grants them the benefit of our Lord's imputed righteousness. Thus our own obedi∣ence becomes a pedestal, on which the righteousness of Christ may stand exalted; and whence, having such an excellent basis, it appears to great advantage! For, according to this dogma, it is by the co-operation of human worthiness, and of divine grace, that sinners obtain both pardon and justification.</P>
<P>Never, to the best of my recollection, did I meet with a more palpable corruption of that capital article, <HI>Justi∣fication before God,</HI> by any writer who did not explode the doctrine of imputed righteousness, than that in the words to which I refer! The doctrine of our Author, in this respect, is indeed too nearly akin to that of the Schoolmen, and of the council of Trent. For thus Dr. OWEN, relative to the Popish doctrine of acceptance

<Q>This [first] justification, they say, is <HI>by faith;</HI> the obedience and satisfaction of Christ being the only meritorious cause thereof.

—Thus, also, Mr. JAMES HERVEY, when addressing Mr. J. WESLEY:
<Q>What can be meant by, <HI>Christ shall profit you nothing, if ye be circumcised?</HI> If ye make circumcision, or any thing whatever, besides the righteousness of Christ, necessary to your acceptance with God, ye shall receive no advantage from all that the Redeemer has done and suffered. This is to halt between works and grace, between Christ and self: and such divided regards, he will interpret as an affront, rather than an acceptable homage▪ Indeed, this is, in Christians, the grand apostacy. By this they deny the sufficiency of their Saviour's most consummate righteousness—and must expect no salvation, but by doing the whole law.—<HI>If any one say, that man is justified only by the imputation of Christ's righteousness, or only by the remission of sins,</HI> WITHOUT THE CO-OPERATION OF INHERENT GRACE AND HOLY LOVE, <HI>let him be accursed.</HI> Thus dogmatizes, and thus anathematizes, that Mother of falsehoods,

<Q>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank thee, that I <HI>am not as other men are</HI>—The Publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, <HI>God be merciful to</HI> ME A SINNER. I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For every one that exalteth himself,</Q>
by pleading his own virtuous exercises,
<Q>shall be abased; and he who humbleth himself,</Q>
by sincerely confessing that he is absolutely unworthy, and by casting himself at the feet of sovereign mercy,
<Q>shall be exalted—I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ;—for therein is the righteousness of God revealed,</Q>
not from one exercise of virtue to another, but
<Q>from faith to faith—The righteousness of

God without the law,</Q>
which requires the exercise of virtue, is manifested—even the righteousness of God; 'which is,' not by virtue, but
<Q>by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that believe—Being justified,</Q>
not as exercising virtue, but
<Q>FREELY by his GRACE— That he might be just, and the justifier,</Q>
not of him that is virtuous, but 'of him that believeth in Jesus,' all sinful as he is.
<Q>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works, or virtue? Nay, but by the law,</Q>
or doctrine
<Q>of faith. Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified without the deeds of the law,</Q>
or the exercise of virtue—
<Q>If Abraham was justified by works,</Q>
or thro' the co-operation of his own virtuous exercises,
<Q>he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. For what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness. Now to him that worketh,</Q>
in the exercise of moral virtue,
<Q>is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that <HI>worketh</HI> not,</Q>
nor is distinguished by virtuous exercises;
<Q>but believeth on him that justifieth the UN∣GODLY,</Q>
and therefore entirely destitute of all true virtue;
<Q>his faith is counted for righteousness. Even as David describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness WITHOUT <HI>works,</HI></Q>
or virtuous exercises of the heart and life:
<Q>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</Q>

<Q>seems to be more con∣trary unto reason, than what is here made manifest by the event. The Gentiles who lived in sin and pleasure, not once endeavouring to attain unto any righteousness before God, yet attained unto it upon the preaching of the gospel. Israel, on the other hand, which <HI>followed after righteousness,</HI> diligently in all the works of the law and duties of obedience unto God thereby, came short of it, attained not unto it. All <HI>preparations,</HI> all <HI>dispositions,</HI> all merits, as unto righteousness and justification, are excluded from the Gentiles. For in all of them there is, more or less, a <HI>following after righteousness;</HI> which is denied of them all. Only by faith in Him who <HI>justifieth the ungodly,</HI> they attain righteousness, or they attained the righteousness of faith. For to attain righteousness <HI>by faith,</HI> and to attain the righteousness <HI>of faith,</HI> are the same thing. Where∣fore, all things that are comprised any way in <HI>following
<PB N="184" REF="031844_0181_0FEF1EEA0B31BCE8"/>
after righteousness,</HI> such as are all our duties and works, are excluded from any influence into our justification. And this is expressed to declare the sovereignty and freedom of the grace of God herein; namely, that we are justified <HI>freely by his grace,</HI> and that on our part all boasting is excluded. Let men pretend what they will, and dispute what they please, those who attain unto righteousness and justification before God, when they <HI>follow not after righteousness;</HI> they do it by the <HI>gratuitous</HI> imputation of the righteousness of another unto them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Doctrine of Justification,</HI> Chap. XVIII.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Where, now, either in the preceding, or in any other passages of holy Writ, shall we find our Author's doc∣trine, respecting
<Q>the necessity of a sinner's exercising virtue, <HI>antecedent</HI> to his justification, and <HI>in order to it?</HI></Q>
Where, in the Oracles of God, is that <HI>union</HI> with Christ, which constitutes the <HI>proper ground</HI> of his righteousness being imputed to us, represented as arising from the exercise of our <HI>own virtue?</HI> Or where, in the inspired Volume, do we perceive any thing said, about the hearts of sinners being united to Christ, <HI>previous</HI> to faith in him, and justification by him? Nay, our Author himself seems to contradict this, by elsewhere saying;
<Q>He who <HI>believeth not</HI> in Christ, is not <HI>so united</HI> to him and in him, as that his merit and righteousness—may be properly
<PB N="185" REF="031844_0182_0FEF1EECEA93D760"/>
imputed to him, or reckoned to his account—The Son of God, who is equal with God, and is God,—is ready to pardon and save all that come unto him; to which all, even the <HI>most guilty and vile,</HI> are FREELY invited <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Two Discourses,</HI> p. 15, 91, 92.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They, whom our Lord invites, and whom the gos∣pel encourages to believe in him, are described as <HI>labouring</HI> under a burden; as <HI>thirsty,</HI> and so on.</Q>
True: but must we consider that <HI>burden,</HI> or this <HI>thirst,</HI> as the mark of a gracious change having taken place in their hearts; as an holy qualification for acceptance with Christ; or as <HI>authorising</HI> them to believe in him? If so, the gospel, as already proved, should be preached to none but those who are <HI>born of God</HI>—that are, to a considerable degree, sanctified—that are already in the way to heaven; and those who are, in Scripture, deno∣minated <HI>sinners,</HI> have no encouragement. Whereas, our Lord's commission was; <HI>Preach the gospel,</HI> or pro∣claim the glad tidings, <HI>to every creature:</HI> and his invi∣tation is, <HI>Come, and take</HI> FREELY—<HI>without money and without price.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>burden</HI> which is here meant, by our compas∣sionate Saviour, seems to be no other than <HI>guilt,</HI> oppressing the conscience; of which the awakened sinner <HI>labours</HI> to get rid, by means of his own devising: and the <HI>thirst,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="031844_0183_0FEF1EF2C6846D30"/>
an earnest desire of happiness, in the attainment of such objects as cannot afford it. Now, a <HI>burden</HI> and a <HI>thirst</HI> of this kind are frequently experienced by those who are unregenerate, and far from having the least degree of holiness. Cain, for example, the firstborn of woman, felt that burden, and complained of it, as too heavy for him to bear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iv. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>; though he was, and continued to be, an enemy to God. Judas, also, experienced the weight of that burden, to an intolerable degree; sunk under its pressure; and perished without remedy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvii. 3, 4, 5.</NOTE>. Whence it appears, that the deepest sense of guilt, and the most alarming apprehensions of eternal ruin, are, detached from other considerations, no evidence of love to God; no proof of sanctifying influence; nor any indication that the subjects of them are in the way to holiness and happiness.—Yet, as Dr. OWEN has well observed,
<Q>Some, finding this <HI>sense of sin,</HI> with those other things that attend it, wrought in them, in some measure, begin to think, that <HI>now</HI> all is well: this is all that is of them required. They will endeavour to make a <HI>life,</HI> from such arguments of <HI>comfort</HI> as they can take from this <HI>trouble.</HI> They think this a <HI>ground</HI> of peace, that they have <HI>not</HI> peace. Here some take up before conversion, and it proves their ruin. Because they are convinced of sin, and troubled about it, and burdened with it, they think it shall be well with them. But, were not
<PB N="187" REF="031844_0184_0FEF1EF450B9C4D0"/>
Cain, Esau, Saul, Ahab, Judas, convinced of sin, and burdened with it? Did this profit them? Did it interest them in the promises? Did not the wrath of God over∣take them, notwithstanding? So it is with many daily: they think their <HI>conviction</HI> is <HI>conversion;</HI> and that their sins are <HI>pardoned,</HI> because they have been <HI>troubled</HI>— For a soul to place the spring of its peace or comfort in any thing of its own, is to fall short of Christ, and take up in <HI>self.</HI> We must not only be <HI>justified,</HI> but <HI>glory</HI> in him also. (Isa. xlv. 25.) Men may make use of the <HI>evidence</HI> of their graces; but only as a medium to a farther end: not as the <HI>rest</HI> of the soul, in the least. And this deprives men's very <HI>humiliations</HI> of all gospel humility. True humility consists more in <HI>believing,</HI> than in being <HI>sensible</HI> of sin. <HI>That's</HI> the soul's great selfemptying and abasing: <HI>this</HI> may consist with an obstinate resolution to scramble for something upon the account of selfendeavours <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the Hundred and Thirtieth Psalm,</HI> p. 62, 63.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Is the <HI>heavy-laden</HI> sinner invited to Christ? it is, not as <HI>qualified</HI> by being burdened, but as <HI>guilty</HI> and <HI>perish∣ing,</HI> that he must apply to the Saviour; taking all his encouragement so to do, from the testimony of God concerning Jesus.—As to a <HI>thirst</HI> of happiness, it is na∣tural to intelligent beings: nor does it seem possible for any creature to possess rational existence, without desir∣ing
<PB N="188" REF="031844_0185_0FEF1EF5DDC58178"/>
its own happiness. But the divine Oracles have informed us, that sinners may hunger for that which is <HI>not bread,</HI> and thirst for that which cannot <HI>satisfy.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. TILLINGHAST, in answer to this objection, says:
<Q>When Christ bids those that are <HI>weary and heavy-laden</HI> come to him, doth it therefore follow, [that] he ex∣cludes all others? I grant, such are to come: and such are most <HI>backward</HI> and <HI>afraid</HI> to come, and there∣fore called. But doth it follow, therefore, that no other must come; and that these, and only these, are called? If a prince send forth [a] proclamation to a company of traitors, to come in, and he will pardon them; and because he knows that there are some few among them, that are so sensible of what they have done, and brought themselves into by their rebellion, that they will never come upon this general proclama∣tion, but, for fear, will run away; he therefore sends particularly to these, by name, <HI>You, and you, who dare not come for fear as being hanged; Come, I will pardon you, and you;</HI> doth it therefore follow, because they have a call, as it were by name, therefore now all the rest, who have a general call are excluded? So here.—But this fain would I know, What is the state and condition that souls are then in, when they are thus <HI>weary and heavy-laden?</HI> Are they in the state and condition of <HI>sinners,</HI> or not? Righteous, or un∣righteous? One [of these] they must be. If you say,
<PB N="189" REF="031844_0186_0FEF1EFB7938A2C8"/>
they are not <HI>sinners,</HI> but <HI>righteous</HI> persons; then I ask, How came they [to be] thus? Is it by their being <HI>weary and heavy laden,</HI> barely? Or is it by their applying of the promise? If it be by their being <HI>weary and heavy-laden,</HI> then what need you press them to come to Christ for justification; when as they have the same by this their qualification? If it be by applying the <HI>promise,</HI> or having it applied to them; then it will follow, that, notwithstunding this their qualification, that they are <HI>sinners,</HI> and so remain until they apply the promise, or have it applied to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Six Treatises,</HI> p. 67, 68. London, 1663.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Thus, Mr. THOMAS BOSTON:
<Q>The thirst men∣tioned (Isa. lv. 1.) [must not] be restricted to a <HI>gracious</HI> thirst, a thirst after Christ and his righteousness. For some, at least, of the <HI>thirsting</HI> ones, to whom the offer is there made, are <HI>spending money for that which is not bread,</HI> and their <HI>labour for that which satisfieth not.</HI> But it is evident, that sinners duly sensible, who are thirsting after Christ and his righteousness, are not spending their money and labour at that rate; but, on the contrary, for that which alone is <HI>bread,</HI> and <HI>satisfieth;</HI> namely, Jesus Christ, the <HI>true bread, which came down from heaven.</HI> Wherefore, the <HI>thirst</HI> there meant, must needs comprehend, yea, and principally aim at, that thirst after happiness and satisfaction which,
<PB N="190" REF="031844_0187_0FEF1EFE64E60798"/>
being natural, is common to all mankind. Men, pained with this thirst, do naturally run, for quenching thereof, to the empty creation, and their fulsome lusts: and so they <HI>spend money for that which is not bread,</HI> and their <HI>labour, for that which satisfieth not;</HI> finding nothing there that can satisfy that their appetite, or thirst—As little is the solemn gospel-offer (Matt. xi. 28.) restricted to a certain set of men endowed with some laudable <HI>qualifications,</HI> going under the name of <HI>labouring</HI> and being <HI>heavy-laden:</HI> the which do, indeed, denote the <HI>restlessness</HI> natural to the sinful soul of man, spending its labour <HI>for that which satisfieth not.</HI> Our father Adam left his whole family with a conscience full of guilt, and a heart full of unsatisfied desires. Thus we naturally having a restless conscience, and a restless heart, the soul as naturally falls a labouring for rest to them. And it labours in the barren region of the fiery law, for a rest to the conscience; and in the empty creation, for a rest to the heart. But, after all, the conscience is still heavy-laden with guilt,—and the heart is still under a load of unsatisfied desires. So neither the one, nor the other, can find rest indeed. This is the natural case of all men: and to souls thus <HI>labouring</HI> and <HI>laden,</HI> Jesus Christ calls, that they may <HI>come to him, and he will give them rest:</HI> namely, a rest for their con∣sciences, under the covert of his blood; and a rest to their hearts, in the enjoyment of God through him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Works,</HI> p. 227, 228. See also, p. 845. <HI>Note.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="031844_0188_0FEF1F05B0E6AD40"/>It has, with some degree of confidence, been de∣manded;
<Q>Whether, if sinners must not come to Christ <HI>as penitent,</HI> and as possessing an <HI>holy disposition;</HI> they are to believe in him, <HI>as impenitent,</HI> and as under the <HI>reigning power</HI> of their depravity?</Q>
But this, like some other objections, is not pertinent. For the question is, What is the proper <HI>warrant</HI> for a sinner to believe in Jesus? Not, What is <HI>the state of his heart,</HI> in the mo∣ment when he first believes?—Or, if the objection did apply, it might be answered; Neither <HI>as</HI> a penitent, nor <HI>as</HI> an impenitent sinner: but merely under the character of one that is <HI>guilty</HI> and <HI>perishing.</HI> It was for such that Jesus died: it is to such the tidings of salvation were addressed by the Apostles: and, therefore, such are en∣couraged to believe in Christ. The objector might, consequently, with equal reason have asked; Whether, in a public ministry, salvation by the Redeemer should be exhibited to <HI>penitents,</HI> or to <HI>impenitents;</HI> to those that have some degree of holiness, or to those who have none? and then the answer would have been; To nei∣ther <HI>those,</HI> nor <HI>these,</HI> respectively <HI>as</HI> such: but to all of them, without exception, as deserving condemnation and final misery. Nor is there any reason to doubt, whether he to whom, by divine authority, salvation through Christ is preached, be warranted to believe in him.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="031844_0189_0FEF1F014E503710"/>It has been objected,
<Q>To assert that sinners, while destitute of holiness, are warranted to believe in Christ; is to maintain, that they are authorised to expect the felicity of heaven, while their native love of sin conti∣nues in all its force, and while they are hardened rebels against God.</Q>
But there is a great and palpable difference between persons, while in their native state, being authorised to <HI>believe</HI> in Jesus; and their being warranted, while in that condition, to <HI>expect</HI> final hap∣piness. Yet this objection proceeds on a supposition, that whoever is encouraged by the word of grace to de∣pend on Christ; is, at the very same instant, merely on the same ground, and while an unbeliever, equally au∣thorised to expect everlasting life: which is a gross mis∣take. For he that believes in Christ, relies on him as <HI>justifying the ungodly:</HI> but he who, on scriptural grounds, hopes for future felicity, expects it as a believer; as in a justified state; as having a turn of heart, in some de∣gree suited to the employments and enjoyments of hea∣ven. Because, <HI>without holiness, no one shall see the Lord.</HI>— Did Paul, for instance, <HI>believe</HI> in Jesus? it was under the consideration of himself, as <HI>a blasphemer, a persecutor,</HI> and <HI>the chief of sinners</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 13, 14, 15</NOTE>. Did he rejoice in <HI>hope?</HI> it was, as having <HI>received the atonement</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 1, 2, 11.</NOTE>; as bearing the image of Christ; and as having a spiritual relish for
<PB N="193" REF="031844_0190_0FEF1F08A23FC2E0"/>
heavenly things. The <HI>sinner</HI> believes: the <HI>believer</HI> hopes.—Nor can any man believe in Christ, and <HI>continue</HI> a rebel against God: for sovereign mercy, when it relieves the conscience, alters the bias of the heart, and forms the character anew. God, in the exercise and manifestation of pardoning grace to rebels, makes them his friends. Thus divine <HI>goodness leads to repentance,</HI> to holiness, and to hope of everlasting happiness. <HI>There is forgiveness with God, that he may be feared.</HI></P>
<P><Q>If we maintain that the ungodly are warranted to believe in Jesus, there will be great danger of encou∣raging a superficial, Antinomian faith. Because guilty creatures, under the power of their depravity, are much more likely to approve the character of Christ, when represented as willing to receive the altogether unholy; than if he were considered as receiving none but those who are cordially disposed to perform the divine precepts.</Q></P>
<P>That the sentiment for which I plead, may be prosti∣tuted to licentious purposes; and that, in certain instances, it probably has been so abused, will be admitted. But, be that as it may, Jesus must either be so exhibited in a public ministry, as to suit the character, the state, the circumstances of apostate creatures, or there is no <HI>gospel</HI> for them. Besides, the misapplication of any doctrine, affords no argument against, either its truth, or its impor∣tance:
<PB N="194" REF="031844_0191_0FEF1F0B8A8C9F60"/>
because the most excellent doctrines, and the plainest passages of Scripture, have been frequently abused to execrable purposes.</P>
<P>This objection seems to imply, that a selfrighteous turn of heart, and pharisaical pride, make no part of human depravity. For it apparently supposes, that there is little or no danger of sinners treating Christ with disrespect, except by considering him as <HI>the minister of sin:</HI> or, of their opposing the designs of divine grace, in any way, besides that of licentiousness. But it appears, from Scripture, from experience, and from observation, that sinners are naturally and strongly inclined to seek justification <HI>by the works of the law;</HI> that a violent pro∣pensity to cherish the notion of self-worthiness, is an essential part of their natural depravity; and that the disrespect with which Christ is generally treated by them, arises principally from that quarter. Yes, their low thoughts respecting the evil of sin, and the high opinion they form of their own character, are the chief source of that neglect with which they treat the divine Jesus, and of all their opposition to saving grace. Nay, so universal, and so predominant is this propensity to self-worthiness, that, for <HI>one</HI> who abuses the sentiment here defended, by converting it into an occasion of sin; <HI>ten thousand</HI> may be justly considered as dishonouring Christ, and as rebelling against God, under the pernicious influence of that principle which I oppose.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="031844_0192_0FEF1F0D1AF27FA0"/>It is a great mistake to imagine, that ungodly men are so ready to adopt the sentiment for which I contend. Certain it is, from the history of our Lord's ministry, and from the writings of Paul, that few things in the preaching, either of Christ, or of the Apostle, were so offensive to persons of respectability among the Jews, as the doctrine which they preached, relative to pardon and acceptance with God. The discourses of Jesus, respecting divine grace, were extremely offensive to the Scribes, the Pharisees, and the reputedly devout in general. But, had the tenour of our Saviour's preach∣ing, or of his converse among the people, been contrary to the principle here avowed; it is not supposable that the Jews would have so frequently complained of him, and objected against his conduct, as they did. Witness the following sayings: <HI>Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?—Behold—a friend of publicans and sinners!—Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?—This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who, and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner—This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them—They murmured saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sin∣ner</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. ix. 11. xi. 19. Luke v. 30. vii. 39. xv. 2. xix. 7.</NOTE>. Now, it is evident, these murmurers and objec∣tors were the reputedly devout; those who considered
<PB N="196" REF="031844_0193_0FEF1F0EA9D8C4C0"/>
themselves, and were considered by others, as possessing virtuous dispositions and holy zeal: yet they were those to whom our Lord addressed himself in the following manner; <HI>Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots,</HI> the most profligate of both sexes, <HI>go into the kingdom of heaven before you. For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him; and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward that ye might believe</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxi. 31, 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such was the treatment of Jesus, by the most respec∣table part of the public; and such was his language concerning those who, under the fair pretext of zeal for holiness, rejected his doctrine, and persecuted his per∣son! With reference to whom, when arguing on their selfrighteous principles in vindication of his own conduct, he spake three admirably gracious Parables at the same time, which Luke has recorded <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xv</NOTE>.—Now, can it be supposed, with any appearance of probability, that the selfrighteous Jews would have cast such reflections on the character of Christ, as a public teacher, if he had insisted on any degree of personal holiness, as previously necessary to faith in revealed mercy, as the only ground of acceptance with God? Had our Lord, in the course of his ministry, from time to time assured them, that every one must, prior to receiving his testimony of
<PB N="197" REF="031844_0194_0FEF1F14594ED220"/>
pardoning mercy and believing in him, be heartily disposed to keep the commands of God; they could not, with any shadow of reason, have raised such a clamour against his doctrine and conduct.</P>
<P>That the ministry of Paul was perfectly consistent with the sentiment here defended, appears from those objections with which he meets, kand from the answers which he returns. Thus, for example: <HI>Some affirm that we say, Let us do evil, that good may come—Do we then make void the law through faith?—Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?—Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 7, 8, 31. vi. 1, 15.</NOTE>?—Such were the objections: and they imply, That, in the estimation of those who made them, the doctrine of Paul, implicitly, or by necessary consequence, <HI>vacated the authority of God</HI> in his law—That believers, being delivered from the kw, as a covenant, or as prescribing the condition on which everlasting life is to be obtained, may safely <HI>continue in sin</HI>—That such continuance in the practice of sin, would <HI>illustrate the riches,</HI> and <HI>manifest the glory,</HI> of divine grace—And that, by accumulating moral evil, <HI>the highest good would be promoted.</HI></P>
<P>To such various and formidable objections was the doctrine of Paul considered, by multitudes, as justly
<PB N="198" REF="031844_0195_0FEF1F173A8BA008"/>
exposed! objections, however, which he repelled with abhorrence, and refuted with ease. But, could any person of common understanding, with the least appear∣ance of propriety, have made these objections to the gospel which Paul preached, if he had taught, That an <HI>holy turn of heart, a disposition to perform the commands of God,</HI> or <HI>the exercise of virtue,</HI> is previously necessary to war∣rant a sinner's dependence on Jesus Christ for pardon and peace? Common sense, and a moment's reflection, forbid the thought. For, on that supposition, he must have laid the foundation of expecting any spiritual benefit from Christ, in the <HI>previous, personal holiness</HI> of every sinner who applies to him: which would have subverted the whole of his doctrine, respecting the justification of sinners before God.—Has it been usual—I appeal to the intelligent reader—has it been usual, in modern times, for the doctrine of religious teachers to be charged with such consequences, or to be opposed by such objections; when it was notorious, that they firmly insisted on the necessity of every one exercising virtue, or possessing some degree of true holiness, in order to warrant a reliance on Jesus Christ for pardon and ac∣ceptance? Was any teacher of religion ever charged with <HI>making void the law;</HI> or with implicitly saying, <HI>Let us do evil, that good may come;</HI> by those who heard his discourses, or perused his writings, in which he main∣tained, that no sinner is authorised to believe in Christ, until he is <HI>disposed to observe the divine precepts?</HI> Surely
<PB N="199" REF="031844_0196_0FEF1F1A2C9FACF0"/>
not! or, if a fact, the objector's conduct must be consi∣dered as the effusion of mental imbecility, as a violent paroxysm of prejudice, or as the virulence of deliberate malice.</P>
<P>But if, on the contrary, we understand Paul as maintaining, That Christ, with all his fulness of spi∣ritual blessings, is <HI>free, perfectly</HI> free for the vilest; if we consider him as encouraging the <HI>chief</HI> of sinners, merely under the character of perishing wretches, to rely on Jesus for their immediate acceptance with God, and as giving them assurance that, in so doing, they shall not be disappointed; if we further consider the Apostle as teaching, that the justification of sinners is merely, en∣tirely, absolutely on the ground of our Lord's vicarious obedience imputed; <HI>then</HI> we perceive the true source of these objections. For that doctrine, in the eyes of all whose hearts are leavened with legal pride, will ever be treated as an insult on moral virtue; as inimical to the divine law; and as having the most licentious tendency. The same doctrine, it is apparent, is opposed by similar objections in our own times: but, <HI>Wisdom is justified of her children.</HI></P>
<P>The principle for which I plead will be further confirmed, if we take into consideration those <HI>replies</HI> which the Apostle made in defence of his doctrine. How, then, does he answer the unfounded and calum¦niating

objections? Not by saying,
<Q>No: I never as∣serted, I never meant, that sinners may believe in Christ, for pardon and peace, before they are disposed to observe the divine precepts. I always taught, that they must love God, or be virtuously inclined to per∣form his will, before they can acceptably believe in Christ.</Q>

God forbid! know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

<P>Here we see, that Paul repels and refutes the objec∣tions, by strong negations; by showing the absurdity of those grounds on which some of them proceed; and by denouncing the judgment of God against all those who dared, out of hatred to evangelical truth, maliciously to slander the apostolic ministry. It should be observed, however, that the Apostle does not give the least intima∣tion of his doctrine having been misunderstood, relative
<PB N="201" REF="031844_0198_0FEF1F231E5077B0"/>
to the <HI>moral state</HI> of those whom he encouraged to believe in Jesus, for the remission of sins, and acceptance with God.—To prove that none can justly consider themselves as having <HI>already</HI> believed in Christ, except they be cordially disposed to holy obedience, his replies are pertinent and strong: but they do not in the least imply, that sinners must have some degree of holiness, or that they must exercise virtue, before they are war∣ranted to believe in him. The want of observing this obvious distinction, seems to be the principal reason of that confusion which often attends the ideas of serious persons on this important subject; and of those mistakes into which they fall, relative to the true ground of a sinner's application to Christ, by which their consciences are frequently so much embarrassed.</P>
<P>Once more: It may, perhaps, be objected;
<Q>The principle defended infers the doctrine of <HI>general redemp∣tion.</HI></Q>
To this I answer, in the words of Dr. OWEN.
<Q>Many disputes there are, <HI>whether Christ died for all individuals of mankind, or no.</HI> If we say <HI>No,</HI> but only for the elect, who are <HI>some of all sorts:</HI> some then tell us, we cannot invite all men promiscuously to believe. But why so? We invite not men, as <HI>all</HI> men; no man, as <HI>one</HI> of all men; but all men as <HI>sinners:</HI> and we know that Christ <HI>died for sinners.</HI> But, is this the <HI>first</HI> thing, that we are, in the dispensation of the gospel, to propose to the soul of a sinner, under the law, <HI>That
<PB N="202" REF="031844_0199_0FEF1F24A5276DC8"/>
Christ died for</HI> HIM <HI>in particular?</HI> Is that the <HI>begin∣ning</HI> of our message unto him? Were not this a ready way to induce him to conclude, Let me then continue in sin, that grace may abound? No: but this is, in order of nature, our first work; even <HI>that</HI> we have had in hand. This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is <HI>the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.</HI> There is a way of reconciliation provided. God is in Christ <HI>reconciling the world to himself.</HI> There is a way of acceptance: <HI>there is forgiveness with him</HI> to be obtained. At this <HI>threshold</HI> of the Lord's house, doth the greatest part of men to whom the gospel is preached fall and perish; never looking in to see the treasures that are in the house itself; never coming into any such state and condition, wherein they have any ground or bottom to enquire, Whether Christ died for them, in particular, or no? They believe not this report, nor take any serious notice of it. This was the ministry of the Baptist; and they who received it not, <HI>rejected the counsel of God</HI> concerning their salvation; and so perished in their sins. This is the sum of the blessed <HI>invitation</HI> given by Wisdom: and here men stumble, fall, and perish. Luke vii. 10.

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. THE SALUTARY AND PRACTICAL TENDENCIES OF THE PRINCIPLE MAINTAINED.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE truth, as it is in Jesus,</HI> being the doctrine <HI>according to godliness</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 21. 1 Tim. vi. 3. Titus i. 1.</NOTE>, cannot but be adapted to practi∣cal purposes; and, therefore, must have a salutary influence on the hearts of all those who really believe it. Of this nature is the sentiment for which I plead; as, perhaps, may appear by the following considerations.</P>
<P><HI>It has a natural tendency to humble self-righteous pride, by annihilating all distinctions among men, respecting the ground of their acceptance with God.</HI> Now this is per∣fectly agreeable to the genius of evangelical truth, and to the nature of Messiah's kingdom; as appears by the following prophetic Oracle, relative to the ministry of John the Baptist, and the commencement of gospel times. <HI>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountaim and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all
<PB N="204" REF="031844_0201_0FEF1F2A8E929740"/>
flesh,</HI> on one common level, and without the least regard to difference of character, <HI>shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xl. 3, 4, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As <HI>vain man would be wise, though born like a wild asses's colt</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job xi. 12.</NOTE>; so proud man would be righteous, though guilty before God, and obnoxious to ruin. If, however, the divine law be equitable, sinners are justly accursed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.</NOTE>; and, if their condemnation be righteous, they cannot have the least hope, except through sovereign mercy.— A small degree of difference from others, with regard to exterior character, is commonly considered, notwith∣standing, as recommending to the favour of God, and as furnishing a ground of hope, through Jesus Christ. Now, in whomsoever this persuasion prevails, the gospel is understood as directing all the relief it reveals, to the qualified, the virtuous, the worthy: not the guilty, the vile, and the wretched. It is considered, therefore, not as adapted to humble the proud heart, and to relieve the pained conscience; but as maintaining a proper dis∣tinction between different characters, and as paying a just regard to human worth. While, consequently, to multitudes, who think themselves comparatively righte∣ous, it ministers food for self importance; it leaves others, who consider themselves as the chief of sinners, without the least foundation of hope.—The principle,
<PB N="205" REF="031844_0202_0FEF1F2EF4CD2A88"/>
however, for which I contend, has a directly contrary tendency: for, in prophetic language, it <HI>levels</HI> moun∣tains, and <HI>elevates</HI> valleys. Or, in the words of our Lord, it <HI>abases</HI> those that are exalted, and <HI>exalts</HI> those that are abased<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii. 12. Luke xiv. 11. xviii. 14.</NOTE>. Because it maintains, that there is the very <HI>same</HI> ground of encouragement, and to an <HI>equal</HI> degree, for men to belive in Jesus, whether they be esteemed moral, or profligate; pious, or profane.</P>
<P><HI>It is most happily suited to relieve those who are held in the snare of despondency, by forbidding despair in the vilest wretch that lives.</HI> Many there are, we have reason to think, who, having, for a long course of time, violated the dictates of conscience, by indulging their worst pro∣pensities; having, in multiplied instances, acted contrary to friendly advice, to their own resolutions, promises, vows; and having, perhaps, been the manifest occasion of ruin to various others; implicitly say, with those in the Prophet, <HI>There is no hope: no; for we have loved strangers, and after them will we go</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii. 25.</NOTE>. Thus, in a kind of sullen despair, they harden their consciences; in order to enjoy, for a while, the pleasures of sin, without con∣troul, and without remorse. Perceiving no reason for hope, they endeavour to discard fear. Having no con∣ception that <HI>there is forgiveness with God,</HI> for persons in
<PB N="206" REF="031844_0203_0FEF1F31DFA94150"/>
their situation; or that such enormous offenders may find acceptance through Jesus Christ; they rush on to final ruin. For, where there is no hope of escaping evil, there are no efforts to guard against it.</P>
<P>The doctrine for which I plead, is, however, adapted to break the destructive snare, by exhibiting a ground of hope. Yes, the gracious gospel, considered as a com∣plete warrant for the ungodly to believe in Jesus, encou∣rages the most profligate, and the most criminal, to regard the atonement of Christ as allsufficient.
<Q>There is not,</Q>
as one observes,
<Q>a more effectual remedy [against despondency,] than the consideration of the <HI>freeness</HI> of the grace of God in Christ and the promises: which are not made to such as <HI>deserve</HI> mercy, but to such as <HI>want</HI> it; not to righteous persons, but to sin∣ners; not to the whole, but to the sick—Of all the ways and experiments to bear up a sinking spirit, there is no consideration like this, That from the beginning to the end of our salvation, nothing is prima∣rily active but <HI>free grace.</HI> This is a firm bottom of comfort against the guilt of the most bloody and crim∣son sins: because free grace is not tied to any rules: it may do what it pleases<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. SPURSTOWE'S <HI>Wells of Salvation opened,</HI> p. 50, 51.</NOTE>.</Q>
It belongs, indeed, to the very nature of <HI>grace,</HI> properly so called, to be abso∣lutely free and sovereign, in all its bestowments: for
<PB N="207" REF="031844_0204_0FEF1F3368D51830"/>
where there is desert, whether intrinsic or pactional, the operation of grace necessarily ceases, and, if recti∣tude prevail, that of equity takes place.</P>
<P><HI>It is admirably fitted to excite hope and produce comfort in those who, though not sunk in despondency, are deeply distressed by a sense of guilt, of depravity, and of unwor∣thiness.</HI> Are the consciences of men alarmed, by a conviction of sin, and an apprehension of deserved wrath for past offences? Are sinners, being acquainted with their own hearts, conscious of strong propensities to evil, and of numerous criminal imperfections attending their best performances? they consider themselves as altoge∣ther vile. Discerning nothing in their hearts, nor any thing in their lives, which deserves the name of <HI>holiness;</HI> but, on the contrary, much that seems to mark them out for destruction; they have nothing to remove their painful fears, or to relieve their burdened consciences, except what the gospel says concerning divine mercy, as manifested in Jesus Christ. He being revealed, however, as perfectly suitable to their wants, and as completely free for their acceptance; they are presented, by sovereign grace, with an allsufficient Saviour for their immediate dependence. Considing in the testi∣mony of God as true, and receiving the provision of his grace as a free gift; they find relief, and enjoy peace Nor does the comfort obtained arise from reflecting on the <HI>manner</HI> in which they believe, but from that <HI>grace</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="031844_0205_0FEF1F37D99C1F30"/>
which the gospel reveals, and from the <HI>allsufficiency</HI> of Jesus in whom they trust.</P>
<P><HI>It is of great importance to the real Christian, in times of spiritual darkness and of discouragement.</HI> Has he, by the power of indwelling sin, or through the force of Satan's temptations, lost that peace which arises from a view of interest in Jesus Christ? Is he incapable of approaching God with a filial confidence, crying, <HI>Abba Father?</HI> he recurs to this truth, as the first spring of his encouragement, and, under the character of a <HI>sinner,</HI> applies to Christ afresh. It being fixed in his mind, as a leading principle of revealed truth, that the most ungodly are authorised to believe in Jesus; and that no degree of previous holiness is necessary for that purpose; he cannot, even in his worst condition, but consider himself as within the verge of that encouragement. As, therefore, it is by faith in Christ that he derives hope; and as, under the influence of hope, spiritual endeavours are excited; so, in this procedure, not only peace of conscience, but prayer and watchfulness, brotherly love and self-denial, communion with God and heavenly mindedness, are promoted.</P>
<P>Besides, under the practical influence of this principle, he will not be so liable to deceive himself, with regard to his real state in the sight of God; by inferring his regeneration from any religious impulses which he has felt,
<PB N="209" REF="031844_0206_0FEF1F3C2529CF28"/>
or from any starts of devotional affection which he may experience. No: he will be dispo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> form a conclu∣sion, respecting his general character, in the estimate of Omniscience, from the <HI>habitual regard</HI> which he pays, to the atonement, the authority, and the example, of Jesus Christ. For though it must be admitted, that every real Christian is <HI>led by the Spirit of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 14.</NOTE>; and though, by the word of truth, that divine Agent produce, excite, and maintain devout affections in the soul; yet we ought never to consider substantial evidence of true godliness, as arising from secret impulses, however strong; nor from transient flashes of religious affection, be they ever so high: but from the <HI>general frame</HI> of the heart, respecting the glorious God, as revealing himself in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>It is of great moment in the Christian's daily walk with God.</HI> The reason is, it has a powerful tendency to promote an habitual regard to the word of grace and the atonement of Christ, as the only source of spiritual peace. The Christian, being conscious of daily con∣tracting fresh guilt, considering his transgressions, and his numerous imperfections in religious duty, as attended with peculiar aggravations, arising from his knowledge of the divine will, the blessings he enjoys, the profession he makes, and the character he bears; it is only by an
<PB N="210" REF="031844_0207_0FEF1F3DB22B4EB8"/>
habitual dependence on the atonement of Christ, that peace is maintained in his conscience, and that he feels the operation of evangelical motives to obedience. This, if I mistake not, is perfectly congenial to that grand maxim of Inspiration; <HI>The just shall live by faith</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hab. ii. 4. Rom. i. 17.

This grace, being revealed in the gospel, being discerned by faith, and thus appearing in lustre, and with power, <HI>to all men</HI>— To men of every rank, every age, every character; making no difference between the servant and his master; between the ruddy stripling and the hoary sire; between the vile prostitute and the chaste vestal; but opening its inexhaustible stores, to be received by one as well as the other—This grace, does what? Cause Antinomianism, or practical ungodliness, to come in with a full tide? Quite the reverse. It represses it like an immoveable barrier. It <HI>teaches us to deny,</HI> to re∣nounce ungodliness, <HI>all ungodliness:</HI> not only external, gross abominations, but <HI>worldly lusts</HI> also; every vici∣ous inclination, and every irregular desire.

<P>Dr. OWEN, when directing sinners to regard that forgiveness which is with God, as the first source of their encouragement, says;
<Q>This is the <HI>only</HI> way and means to enable you to obedience, and to render what you do therein acceptable unto God. It may be, that some of you are under the power of convictions, and have
<PB N="213" REF="031844_0210_0FEF1F46872CCAC0"/>
made engagements unto God to live unto him, to keep yourselves from sin, and to follow after holiness. It may be, you have done so in afflictions, dangers, sicknesses, or upon the receipt of mercies: but yet you find that you cannot come unto any stability, or consis∣tency, in your course. You break with God and your own souls, which fills you with new disquietments; or else hardens you, and makes you secure and negli∣gent: so that you return unto your purposes no oftener, than your convictions, or afflictions, befal you anew. This condition is ruinous and pernicious, which nothing can deliver you from, but this closing with forgiveness. For, all that you do without this, however it may please your minds, or ease your consciences, is not at all accepted with God. Unless this foundation be laid, all that you do is lost. All your prayers, all your duties, all your amendments, are an abomination to the Lord. Until peace is made with him, they are but the acts of enemies, which he despiseth and abhor∣reth. You run, it may be, earnestly; but you run out of the way: you strive, but not lawfully, and shall never receive the crown. True gospel obedience is the fruit of the faith of forgiveness. Whatever you do without it, is but a building without a foundation; a castle in the air. You may see the order of gospel obedience, Eph. ii. 7—10. The foundation must be laid in <HI>grace; riches of grace,</HI> by Christ, in the free pardon and forgiveness of sin. From hence must the
<PB N="214" REF="031844_0211_0FEF1F4AF3438CE8"/>
works of obedience proceed, if you would have them to be of God's appointment, or find acceptance with him. Without this, God will say of all your services, worship, obedience, as he did to the Israelites of old, (Amos v. 21—25.) <HI>I despise all; reject it all:</HI> it is not to him, nor to his glory, Now, if you are under convictions of any sort, there is nothing you more value, nothing you more place your confidence in, than your duties: your repentance, your amendment: what you do, and what in good time you will be. Is it nothing unto you, to lose all your hopes and all your expectations, which you have from hence? To have no other reception with God, than if all this time you had been wallowing in your sins and lusts? Yet thus it is with you, if you have not begun with God on his own terms; if you have not <HI>received the atonement,</HI> in the blood of his Son; if you are not made partakers of forgiveness; if your persons are not pardoned, all your duties are accursed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This alone will give you such motives and encou∣ragements unto obedience, as will give you life, alacrity, and delight in it. You perform duties, ab∣stain from sins; but with heaviness, fear, and in bon∣dage. Could you do as well without them, as with them; would conscience be quiet, and hope of eter∣nity hold out; you would omit them forever. This makes all your obedience burdensome; and you cry
<PB N="215" REF="031844_0212_0FEF1F4C83940400"/>
out in your thoughts, with him in the Prophet; <HI>Behold, what a weariness it is!</HI> The service of God is the only drudgery of your lives; which you dare not omit, and delight not to perform. From this wretched and cursed frame, there is nothing that can deliver you but this closing with forgiveness. This will give you such motives, such encouragements, as will greatly influence your hearts and souls. It will give you free∣dom, liberty, delight and cheerfulness, in all duties of gospel obedience. You will find a constraining power in the love of Christ therein: a freedom from bondage, when the Son truly hath made you free. Faith and love will work genuinely and naturally in your spirits; and that which was your greatest burden, will become your chiefest joy. (2 Cor. vii. 1.) Thoughts of the love of God, of the blood of Christ, or the Covenant of Grace, and sense of pardon in them, will enlarge your hearts, and sweeten all your duties. You will find a new life, a new pleasure, a new satisfaction, in all that you do <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the Hundred and Thirtieth Psalm,</HI> p. 262, 263, 264.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><HI>It it perfectly consistent with the necessity of true holiness, to constitute the Christian character, and to evidence the Christian faith.</HI> Does any one ask, What is my <HI>warrant</HI> for believing in Jesus Christ?

<PB N="216" REF="031844_0213_0FEF1F4E0A1E8F98"/>
the word of grace, or the testimony of God concerning Jesus.—If the question be, What is the <HI>evidence</HI> of my having believed in Christ, as justifying the ungodly? regard must be had to the prevailing turn of your heart, respecting the riches of his grace, the allsufficiency of his work, and the plenitude of his authority: an habi∣tual approbation of which, constitues evidence to a per∣son's own conscience of real faith in him.—If the ques∣tion be, What is necessary to render a <HI>profession</HI> of that faith credible to others? then the answer is, As <HI>faith worketh by love,</HI> and as <HI>faith without works is dead;</HI> so a profession of faith in Jesus, not attended with fruits of love to his name, is entirely vain: and all pretences of love to Christ, without obedience to his commands, are equally futile. For thus it is written, <HI>If ye love me, keep my commandments—He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me—If any man love me, he will keep my words—He that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings—This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments—This is love, that we walk after his com∣mandments—He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 15, 21, 23, 24. 1 John v. 3. 2 John 6. 1 John ii. 4.</NOTE>. —Carefully to distinguish, between that which <HI>authorises</HI> our believing in Jesus, and that which <HI>evidences</HI> our faith in him, is of the highest importance. Because,
<PB N="217" REF="031844_0214_0FEF1F559E15D7E0"/>
maintaining that holiness is previously necessary to the <HI>former,</HI> savours of selfrighteousness, intrenches on the honours of divine grace, and embarrasses the awakened conscience: while it is evident, that a denial of its utility, respecting the <HI>latter,</HI> contradicts the assertions of Inspi∣ration, verges upon licentiousness, and tends to Antino∣mianism.</P>
<P>Relative to these particulars, to some articles of Christian experience, and to the state of unconverted sinners; I shall conclude the whole with various extracts from Dr. OWEN. Thus, then, that judicious Author:
<Q>Our <HI>foundation</HI> in dealing with God, is Christ alone; <HI>mere</HI> grace, and pardon in him. Our <HI>building</HI> is in and by holiness and obedience; as the fruits of that faith by which we have received the atonement. And great mistakes there are in this matter, which bring great intanglements on the souls of men. Some are all their days laying the foundation, and are never able to build upon it, unto any comfort to themselves, or usefulness to others: and the reason is, because they will be mixing with the foundation stones, that are sit only for the following building. They will be bring∣ing their obedience, duties, mortification of sin, and the like, unto the foundation. These are precious stones to <HI>build</HI> with, but unmeet to be first laid to bear upon them the <HI>whole weight</HI> of the building. The foundation is to be laid, as was said, in <HI>mere grace,</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="031844_0215_0FEF1F58B7A4F6F0"/>
mercy, pardon in the blood of Christ. This the soul is to accept of, and to rest in, <HI>merely as it is</HI> GRACE; without the consideration of any thing in itself, but that it is sinful and obnoxious unto ruin. This it finds a difficulty in, and would gladly have something of its own to mix with it. It cannot tell how to fix these foundation stones, without some cement of its own endeavours and duty: and because these things will not mix, they spend a fruitless labour about it all their days. But, if the foundation be <HI>of grace,</HI> it is not at all <HI>of works:</HI> for, otherwise, <HI>grace is no more grace.</HI> If any thing of our own be mixed with grace in this matter, it utterly destroys the nature of <HI>grace;</HI> which, if it be not <HI>alone,</HI> it is <HI>not at all.</HI> But doth not this tend to licentiousness? Doth not this render obedience, holiness, duties, mortification of sin, and good works, needless? God forbid! yea, this is the only way to order them aright unto the glory of God. Have we nothing to do, but <HI>to lay the foundation?</HI> yes, all our days we are to <HI>build</HI> upon it, when it is surely and firmly laid. And these are the means and ways of our edification. This, then, is the soul to do, who would come to peace and settlement. Let it let go all former endeavours, if it have been engaged unto any of that kind: and let it alone receive, admit of, and adhere to <HI>mere grace, mercy, and pardon;</HI> with a full sense that, in its self, it hath nothing for which it should have an interest in them, but that all is of mere

grace, through Jesus Christ. <HI>Other foundation can no man lay.</HI> Depart not hence, until this work be well over. Surcease not an earnest endeavour with your own hearts, to acquiesce in this righteousness of God, and to bring your souls unto a comfortable persuasion that God, for <HI>Christ his sake, hath freely forgiven you all your sins.</HI> Stir not hence, until this be effected. If you have been engaged in another way; that is, to seek for an interest in the pardon of sin, by some endea∣vours of your own; it is not unlikely but you are filled with the fruit of your own doings: that is, that you go on with all kind of uncertainties, and without any kind of constant peace. Return, then, again hither: bring this foundation work to a blessed issue in the blood of Christ; and, when that is done, up and be doing.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You know how fatal and ruinous it is, for souls to abuse the grace of God, and the apprehension of the pardon of sins, in the course of their obedience to countenance themselves in sin, or the negligence of any duty. This is to turn the grace of God into wantonness, as we have elsewhere at large declared. And it is no less pernicious, to bring the duties of our obedience; any reserves for them; any hopes about them, into the matter of pardon and forgiveness, as we are to receive them from God. But these things, as they are distinct in themselves, so they must be distinctly
<PB N="220" REF="031844_0217_0FEF1F5E6BD62330"/>
managed in the soul: and the confounding of them, is that which disturbs the peace, and weakens the obedience of many. In a confused manner, they labour to keep up a life of <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>duty;</HI> which will be, in their places, conjoined, but not mixed or com∣pounded. First, to take up mercy, pardon and for∣giveness, <HI>absolutely on the account of Christ;</HI> and then to yield all obedience in the <HI>strength</HI> of Christ, and for the <HI>love</HI> of Christ, is the life of a believer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the Hundred and Thirtieth Psalm,</HI> p. 300, 301, 302.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>They that believe <HI>forgiveness</HI> in a due manner, believe it for the ends and purposes for which it is revealed of God—If God reveals any thing for <HI>one</HI> end and purpose, and men use it quite unto <HI>another;</HI> they do not receive the word of God, nor believe the thing revealed, but steal the word, and delude their own souls. Let us then weigh, to what end and purposes this forgiveness was first revealed by God; for which also its manifestation is still continued in the gospel. We have shewed before, who it was to whom this revelation was made, and what condi∣tion he was in, when first it was made unto him. A lost, wretched creature, without hope or help, he was: how he should come to obtain acceptance with God, he knew not. God reveals forgiveness unto him, by Christ, to be <HI>his all.</HI> The intention of God in it was,
<PB N="221" REF="031844_0218_0FEF1F202C785E70"/>
that a sinner's ALL <HI>should be of grace.</HI> (Rom. xi. 6.) If any thing be added unto it, for the same end and purpose, then <HI>grace is no more grace.</HI> Again, God intended it as a <HI>new foundation</HI> of obedience, of love, and thankfulness. That men should <HI>love,</HI> because for∣given; and be <HI>holy,</HI> because pardoned, as I have shewed before; that it might be the righteousness of a sinner, and a spring of new obedience in him, all to the praise of grace, were God's ends in its revelation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the Hundred and Thirtieth Psalm,</HI> p. 239.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Self-condemnation and ab<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rency do very well consist with gospel justification and peace. Some men have no peace, because they have <HI>that,</HI> without which it is impossible they should have peace. Because they cannot but condemn themselves, they cannot entertain a sense that God doth acquit them. But this is the mystery of the gospel, which unbelief is a stranger unto. Nothing but <HI>faith</HI> can give a real subsistence unto these things, in the same soul, and the same time. It is easy to learn the <HI>notion</HI> of it, but it is not easy to experience the <HI>power</HI> of it. For a man to have a sight of that <HI>within</HI> him, which would condemn him, for which he is troubled; and, at the same time, to have a discovery of that <HI>without</HI> him, which will justify him, and to rejoice therein; is that which he is not led unto, but by faith in the mystery of the gospel.
<PB N="222" REF="031844_0219_0FEF1F6479839A30"/>
We are now under <HI>a law for justification,</HI> which ex∣cludes all boasting, Rom. iii. 27. So that though we have joy enough in another, yet we <HI>may</HI> have, we always <HI>have,</HI> sufficient cause of humiliation in ourselves. The gospel will teach a man to <HI>feel</HI> sin, and <HI>believe</HI> righteousness, at the same time. Faith will carry heaven in one hand, and hell in the other; shewing the one deserved, the other purchased. A man may see enough of his own sin and folly, to bring <HI>Gehen∣nam <SUP>è</SUP> Coelo,</HI> a hell of wrath out of heaven; and yet see Christ bring <HI>Coelum ex Inferno,</HI> a heaven of blessed∣ness out of an hell of punishment. And these must needs produce very diverse, yea contrary effects and operations in the soul: and he who knows not how to assign them their proper duties, and seasons, must needs be perplexed. The work of self-condemnation, then, which men in these [painful exercises] cannot but abound with, is, in the disposition of the Covenant of Grace, no way inconsistent with, nor unsuited unto, justification, and the enjoyment of peace, in the sense of it. There may be a deep sense of sin, on other considerations besides <HI>hell.</HI> David was never more humbled for sin, than when Nathan told him it was forgiven: and there may be a view of hell, as <HI>deserved;</HI> which yet the soul may know itself freed from, as to the <HI>issue</HI>—A deep sense of the evil of sin, of the guilt of [a] man's <HI>own</HI> sin, is no way inconsistent with gos∣pel assurance of acceptance with God through Christ,
<PB N="223" REF="031844_0220_0FEF1F676F5BC398"/>
and of forgiveness in him. By a sense of the guilt of sin, I understand two things; a clear conviction of sin, by the Holy Ghost saying unto the soul, <HI>Thou art the man:</HI> and a sense <HI><SUP>c</SUP></HI> the displeasure of God, or the wrath due to sin, according to the sentence of the law —Deep sorrow for sin is consistent with assurance of forgiveness: yea, it is a great means of preservation of it. Godly sorrow, mourning, humiliation, con∣triteness of spirit, are no less gospel graces, and fruits of the Holy Ghost, than faith itself; and so are con∣sistent with the highest flourishings of faith whatever. It is the work of <HI>heaven itself,</HI> and not of the <HI>assurance</HI> of it, to wipe all tears from our eyes—Sorrow, abso∣lutely exclusive of the faith of forgiveness, is <HI>legal,</HI> and tendeth to death. Assurance, absolutely exclusive of godly sorrow, is <HI>presumption,</HI> and not a <HI>persuasion from him that calleth us.</HI> But, gospel-sorrow, and gospel-assurance, may well dwell in the same breast, at the same time. Indeed, as in all worldly joys there is a secret wound; so, in all godly sorrow and mourning, considered in itself, there is a secret joy and refresh∣ment. Hence it doth not wither and dry up, but rather enlarge, open, and sweeten the heart. I am persuaded, that, generally, they <HI>mourn most</HI> who have <HI>most assurance.</HI> All true, gospel mourners, will be found to have the root of assurance so grafted in them, that, in its proper season (a time of trouble) it will undoubtedly flourish.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="031844_0221_0FEF1F6A62F26170"/>
<Q>A deep sense of the indwelling power of sin, is con∣sistent with gospel assurance. Sense of indwelling sin will cause manifold perplexities in the soul. Trouble, disquietments, sorrow, anguish of heart; expressing themselves in sighs, mourning, groaning for deliverance, always attend it. To what purpose do you speak, to a soul hghly sensible of the restless power of indwelling sin, concerning <HI>assurance?</HI></Q>
<Q>Alas, saith he, I am ready to perish every moment! My lusts are strong, active, restless, yea outrageous: they give me no rest, no liberty, and but little success do I obtain. <HI>Assurance</HI> is for conquerors; for them that live at rest and peace. I lie groveling on the ground all my days, and must needs be uncertain what will be the issue.</Q>
—But when such an one hath done all
<Q>he can, he will not be able to make more woful com∣plaints of this matter, than Paul hath done before him, Romans the seventh: and yet he closeth the dis∣course of it with as high an expression of <HI>assurance,</HI> as any person needs to seek after<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 24. viii. 1.</NOTE>. It is not <HI>assurance,</HI> but <HI>enjoyment,</HI> that excludes this sense and trouble. But, if men will think they can have no assurance, because they have <HI>that,</HI> without which it is impossible they should have any, it is hard to give them relief. A little <HI>cruse of salt</HI> of the gospel, cast into these bitter waters, will make them sweet and wholesome. Sense

of the guilt of sin, may consist with faith of its pardon and forgiveness in the blood of Christ. Godly sor∣row may dwell in the same heart, and the same time, with joy in the Holy Ghost: and groaning after deli∣verance from the power of sin, with a gracious per∣suasion, that <HI>sin shall not have dominion over us, because we are not under the law, but under grace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ut supra,</HI> p. 279—283.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Known</HI> holiness, is apt to degenerate into selfrighte∣ousness. What God gives us, on the account of <HI>sanctification,</HI> we are ready enough to reckon on the score of <HI>justification.</HI> It is a hard thing to <HI>feel</HI> grace, and to <HI>believe</HI> as if there were none. We have so much of the Pharisee in us, by nature, that it is some∣times well that our good is hid from us. We are ready to take our corn and wine, and bestow them on other lovers. Were there not in our hearts a <HI>spiritu∣ally sensible</HI> principle of corruption; and in our duties a discernible mixture of <HI>self;</HI> it would be impossible we should walk so humbly with God in a Covenant of Grace and pardoning mercy. It is a good life, which is attended with a <HI>faith</HI> of righteousness, and a <HI>sense</HI> of corruption—Oftentimes, holiness in the heart is more known by the opposition that is made there to it, than by its own prevalent working: the Spirit's operation is known by the flesh's opposition. We find a man's
<PB N="226" REF="031844_0223_0FEF1F71C9632ED8"/>
strength by the burdens he carries, and not the pace that he goes. <HI>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the bady of this death?</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a better evi∣dence of grace and holiness, than, <HI>God I thank thee, I am not as other men.</HI> A heart pressed, grieved, burdened, not by the <HI>guilt</HI> of sin only, (which reflects with trouble on an awakened conscience) but by the close adhering <HI>power</HI> of indwelling sin, tempting, seducing, soliciting, hindering, captivating, conceiving, restlessly disquieting; may from thence have as clear an evidence of holiness, as from a delightful fruit-bearing. What is it that is troubled and grieved in thee? What is it, that seems to be almost killed and destroyed; that cries out, complains, longs for deliverance? Is it not the new creature? Is it not the principle of spiri∣tual life, whereof thou art partaker? I speak not of trouble and disquietments for sin committed; nor of fears and perturbations of mind, lest sin should break forth to loss, shame, ruin, dishonour; nor of the con∣tending of a convinced conscience, lest damnation should ensue; but of the spirit against sin, out of a <HI>hatred</HI> and a <HI>lothing</HI> of it, upon all the mixed consi∣derations of love, grace, mercy, fear, the beauty of holiness, excellency of communion with God, that are proposed in the gospel. If thou seemest to thyself to be only <HI>passive</HI> in these things; to <HI>do</HI> nothing, but to <HI>endure</HI> the assaults of sin; yet if thou art sensible, and standest under the stroke of it, as under the stroke of
<PB N="227" REF="031844_0224_0FEF1F73561F8F18"/>
an enemy, there is the root of the matter. And as it is thus, as to the substance and <HI>being</HI> of holiness, so it is also as to the <HI>degrees</HI> of it. Degrees of holiness, are to be measured more by opposition, than self opera∣tion. He may have more grace than another, who brings not forth so much fruit as the other; because he hath more opposition, more temptation: and sense of the want of ALL, is a great sign of <HI>somewhat</HI> in the soul— It is certain, whilst we are in the flesh, our duties will taste of the vessel whence they proceed. Weakness, defilements, treachery, hypocrisy, will attend them. To this purpose, whatever some pretend to the contrary, is the complaint of the church, Isa. lxiv. 6. The chaff, oftentimes, is so mixed with the wheat, that corn can scarce be discerned. And this know, <HI>That the more spiritual any man is, the more he sees of his unspiri∣tualness in his spiritual duties.</HI> An outside performance will satisfy an outside Christianity. Job abhorred himself most, when he knew himself best. The clearer discoveries we have had of GOD, the viler will every thing of SELF appear. Nay, further, duties and per∣formances are oftentimes very ill measured by us; and those seem to be <HI>first,</HI> which indeed are <HI>last;</HI> and those to be <HI>last,</HI> which indeed are <HI>first.</HI> I do not doubt but a man, when he hath had distractions to wrestle withal; no outward advantage to further him; no extraordinary provocations of hope, fear, or sorrow, on a natural account, in his duty; may rise from his

knees with thoughts that he hath done nothing in his duty but <HI>provoked God:</HI> when there hath been more workings of grace, in contending with the deadness cast on the soul by the condition that it is in; than when, by a concurrence of moved natural affections, and outward provocations, a frame hath been raised that hath, to the party himself, seemed to reach hea∣ven: so that, it may be, this perplexity about duties, is nothing but what is common to the people of God, and which ought to be no obstruction to peace and settlement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the Hundred Thirtieth Psalm,</HI> p. 343, 344, 345.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Take heed of spending time in complaints, when vigorous actings of grace are your duty. Fruitless and heartless complaints, bemoanings of themselves and their condition, is the substance of the profession that some make. If they can object against themselves, and form complaints out of their conditions, they suppose they have done their duty. I have known some who have spent a good part of their time, in going up and down from one to another with their objections and complaints. These things are contrary to the life of faith—Yet some, I fear, may please themselves in such a course, as if it had somewhat of <HI>eminency</HI> in religion in it. Others, it may be, drive the same trade in their <HI>thoughts,</HI> although they make not, outwardly, such
<PB N="229" REF="031844_0226_0FEF1F7C22F47898"/>
complaints. They are conversant, for the most part, with heartless despondings: and, in some, they are multiplied by their <HI>natural constitutions,</HI> or <HI>distempers.</HI> Examples of this kind occur unto us every day—We must say, then, unto such heartless complainers, as God did to Joshua, <HI>Get you up: why lie you thus upon your faces?</HI> Do you think to mend your condition by <HI>wishing</HI> it better, or <HI>complaining</HI> it is so bad? Are your complaints of want of an interest in forgiveness, a sanctified means to obtain it? not at all. You will not deal so with yourselves in things natural or civil. In such things you will take an industrious course for a remedy, or for relief. In things of the smallest importance in this world, and unto this life, you will not content yourselves with <HI>wishing</HI> and <HI>complaining.</HI> As though industry, in the use of natural means, for the attaining of natural ends, were the ordinance of God; and diligence in the use of spiritual means, for the obtaining of spiritual ends, were not!—Do you use diligence, study, endeavours, <HI>all diligence;</HI> diligence at all times, in all ways by God appointed; <HI>all manner</HI> of diligence, within and without, in private and public, to this end and purpose? Do you study, meditate, pray, watch, fast, neglect no opportunity, keep your hearts, search, try, examine yourselves, fly tempta∣tions, and occasions of cooling, deadening, and stifling grace? Do these things abound in you? <HI>Alas, you cannot do thus; you are so weak, so indisposed.</HI> But,
<PB N="230" REF="031844_0227_0FEF1F7DA8809F30"/>
alas, you will not; you will not part with your ease; you will not crucify your lusts; you will not use <HI>all diligence:</HI> but must come to it, or be contented to spend all your days in darkness, and to lie down in sorrow.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thus do men frequently miscarry. Is it any news for persons to bewail the folly of their nature and ways, in the <HI>morning and evening;</HI> and yet scarce stand upon their watch <HI>any part of the day,</HI> or in any occa∣sion of the day? Is this <HI>giving all diligence?</HI> Is this <HI>working out our salvation with fear and trembling?</HI> And may we not see professors, even indulging to themselves in ways of vanity, folly, wrath, envy, sloth, and the like; and yet complain at what a loss they are, how unquiet, how uncertain? God forbid it should be otherwise with you! or that we should endeavour to speak peace unto you, in any such a frame! To hear of a person, that he walks slothfully, carelessly, or indulgeth his corruptions; and to find him camplaining, that he is at a loss, whether he have any interest in pardon, or no; to give, or tender, comfort to such mourners, without a due admonition of their duty to <HI>use diligence,</HI> in the use of means, for to help on their deliverance out of the condition wherein they are, is to tender poison unto them—Spiritual

<P><Q>Men living under the <HI>profession</HI> of religion, and not experiencing the <HI>power,</HI> virtue, and efficacy of it in their hearts; are, whatever they profess, very near to Atheism; or, at least, exposed to great temptations thereunto. If they profess they know God, but in works deny him, they <HI>are abominable, and disobedient, and, unto every good work, reprobate.</HI> Let such men lay aside tradition and custom; let them give up themselves to a free and rational consideration of things; and they will quickly find that all their profession is but a miserable selfdeceiving; and that, indeed, they be∣lieve not one word of the religion which they profess. For, of what their religion affirms to be <HI>in themselves,</HI> they find not any thing true, or real—He that pro∣fesseth the gospel, avows that the death of Christ doth <HI>crucify sin;</HI> that faith <HI>purifieth the heart;</HI> that the Holy Ghost quickens, and enables the soul, unto duty; that God is good and gracious unto all that come unto him; that there is precious communion to be obtained with him, by Christ; that there is great joy in believing. These things are plainly, openly, frequently insisted on in the gospel. Hence the Apostle presseth men unto obedience, on the account of them; and, as it were,
<PB N="232" REF="031844_0229_0FEF1F80C54AF330"/>
leaves them at liberty from it, if they were not so. Philip, ii. 1, 2. Now, if men live long in the pro∣fession of these things, saying that <HI>they are so,</HI> but indeed find nothing of truth, reality, or power in them; have no experience of the effects of them, in their own hearts or souls; what stable ground have they of believing any thing else in the gospel, whereof they can∣not have an <HI>experience?</HI> A man professeth that the death of Christ will <HI>mortify sin,</HI> and subdue corruption. Why doth he believe it? because it is so affirmed in the gospel. How, then, doth he find it to be so? Hath it this effect upon his soul, in his own heart? Not at all: he finds no such thing in him. How, then, can this man believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, because it is affirmed in the gospel; seeing that he finds no real truth of that which it affirms to be in himself? So our Saviour argues, John iii. 12 —Of all dangers, therefore, in profession, let pro∣fessors take heed of this; namely, Of a <HI>customary, traditional,</HI> or <HI>doctrinal</HI> owning such truths, as ought to have <HI>their effects and accomplishment in themselves,</HI> whilst they have no experience of the reality and effi∣cacy of them.

what end should they continue longer in the avowing of that which is not?

the living God.</HI> You hear the voice, or read the words of a poor worm; but the message is the <HI>message,</HI> and the word is the <HI>word,</HI> of Him who shaketh heaven and earth.

<P><Q>If you are, then, resolved to continue in your pre∣sent condition, I have no more to say unto you. <HI>I am pure from your blood;</HI> in that I have declared unto you the counsel of God in this thing; and so I must leave you to a naked trial between the Great God and your souls, at the last day. Poor creatures! I even tremble to think, how he <HI>will tear you in pieces,</HI> when <HI>there shall be none to deliver!</HI> Methinks, I see your poor, destitute, forlorn souls; forsaken of lusts, sins, world, friends, angels, men; trembling before the throne of God, full of horror, and fearful expectation of the dreadful sentence. Oh! that I could mourn over you whilst you are joined to all the living; whilst there is yet hope! Oh, that in this your day, you knew the things of your peace <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>!</Q></P>
