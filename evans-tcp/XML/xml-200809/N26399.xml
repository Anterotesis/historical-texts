<L>A beautiful creature was making her moan,</L>
<L>The tears they were falling full fast from her eyes</L>
<L>She pierced the air and my heart with her cries.</L>

<L>I gently requested the cause of her moan,</L>
<L>She told me her sweet Senecino was gone;</L>
<L>And in that sad posture she ever would remain,</L>
<L>Unless her dear charmer return'd home again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps it is some linnet, or blackbird, said I.</L>
<L>Perhaps it is the lark that has soar'd in the sky:</L>
<L>Come, dry up your tears, and abandon your grief,</L>
<L>I'll bring you another that shall give you relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It's no blackbird, nor linnet, nor sky lark, said she,</L>
<L>But one that is fairer by far, than all three,</L>
<L>My sweet Senecino, for whom I now cry,</L>
<L>Is sweeter than all the gay songsters that fly.</L>

<L>Since the press gang laid hold of poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>

<L>'Twas the first day of April I sat off like a fool,</L>
<L>From Kilkenny to Dublin, to see Lawrence Tool,</L>
<L>My mother's third cousin, who oft had wrote down,</L>
<L>And begg'd I'd come see how he flourish'd in town:</L>

<L>He beckon'd a press-gang that came without fail,</L>
<L>And neck and heels drag'd off poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then they scamper'd away, as they said with a prize,</L>
<L>(For they thought me a sailor run off in disguise)</L>
<L>But a terrible blunder they made with their strife,</L>
<L>For I'd ne'er seen a ship or the sea in my life:</L>
<L>Away to a tender with me they did steer,</L>
<L>But of tenderness devil a morsel was there,</L>
<L>O! I roar'd and I curs'd, tho' it did not avail,</L>
<L>They down in the cellar cram'd Patrick O'Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We set sail from Dublin the very next day,</L>

<L>Fast hold with my trotters, for fear I should flip,</L>
<L>I let go with my hands to stick fast by my toes,</L>
<L>The ship gave a roll and away my head goes,</L>
<L>I plung'd in the water and splash'd like a whale,</L>
<L>'Till with boat-hooks they fish'd up poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>
<L>'Midst shouts, jests and laughter, they hoisted me in</L>

<L>Such ropes and such pullies, such fights met my eye,</L>
<L>And so large were the sheets that they hung up to dry:</L>

<L>They clapt sticks in the capstern, as I after∣wards found,</L>

<L>With a freight of live lumber and Patrick O'∣Neal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to go down below I exprest a great wish,</L>

<L>And it being ban-jan day they gave me burgue:</L>

<L>They call'd it a hammock, and bade me get in,</L>
<L>I laid hold, took a leap, but my footing being frail,</L>
<L>It swang me clean over!—poor Patrick O'Neal.</L>

<L>Maria chose her wretched seat,</L>
<L>To mourn her sorrows free.</L>

<L>No more to charm the vale she tries,</L>
<L>For grief has fill'd her breast;</L>
<L>Those joys which once she us'd to prize—</L>
<L>But love has robb'd her rest.</L>
