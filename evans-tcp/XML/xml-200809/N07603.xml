<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE take the earliest opportunity after our being met together to give your excellency notice of it; and this we look upon to be the more necessary since our conversing upon the subject of a future congress has occasioned an alteration of the place of meeting.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An alteration of place proposed.</NOTE> A change in every respect so much more convenient to us, will, we flatter ourselves, not be otherwise to you; the distance will, we understand, be the same, and the accommodations no doubt better: It was the intention of some of us to have gone up Savannah river by water, but the tediousness of that passage has deterred us,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulty of go∣ing by water,</NOTE> as the difficulty, if not impractica∣bility,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or by land, to Augusta.</NOTE> of conveying ourselves, and the necessary conveniencies, by land, has made us lay aside all thoughts of this also. The behaviour of some of the Indians to the king's subjects,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And the ill beha∣viour of the Indians, point out the pro∣priety of the altera∣tion.</NOTE> and their ill disposition towards one another, points out too the propriety, of assembling them at some place where they will be under a greater check and controul, than they would be in so straggling and ill-settled a place as Augusta: but with regard to the Indians themselves, we imagine the alteration will not be disagreeable; they were before apprised that Augusta was pitched upon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Small-pox in Ca∣rolina, the reason why Augusta was at first proposed.</NOTE> because the small-pox was in Carolina; that disorder having long since ceased, will be reason therefore sufficient to assign for the change of place. The Chactahs,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">That obstacle now removed.</NOTE> Chicasahs and Catawbas, are not at all likely to make objections; the Cherokees are extremely averse to going to Augusta; and if the Creeks should entertain any jealousy, the superintendent will no doubt be able to convince them, that nothing is intended by the change of place, but to render the meeting more commodious to the governors, some of which have already come a great way, and will suffer unavoidably by proceeding farther. Capt. Stuart will either lodge the presents at Augusta, or order them back again, as may appear to him the most proper, when he has sounded the Indians on this subject. We should have been glad, if time would have permitted to have known your sentiments upon this alteration; but the day appointed draws so near, that capt. Stuart thinks it proper to set off on thursday, in order to be ready to receive such Indians as may arrive. We are,</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE just received yours of the 4th instant, acquainting me with an intended alteration of the place of meeting to hold the future congress. The change, if to be in Charles-Town, is certainly more convenient and agreeable to you, and it ever gives me pleasure, when, in executing any part of my duty, I can do it in such manner as may be most agreeable to those concerned; though I must observe, that the difficulties thrown in the way, I conceive (on a trial) would not have proved so great as represented or imagined.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who represents Augusta as a pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> The place affords sufficient houses, plenty of provisions, and accommodations of every kind, though not so elegant as in Charles-Town. As to any particular conve∣nience or inconvenience to myself, I set that quite out of the question where his majesty's service interferes; and although some, very few, of the upper Creek have misbehaved lately, yet I am fully persuaded, the meeting at Augusta would have been perfectly safe, and all parties secure from danger. I wish the Creeks, &amp;c.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And safe pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> may be prevailed on to proceed any further than Augusta, but doubt very much whether they will. Mr. Stuart, in his letter to me, does not mention the least difficulty or objection made by the Cherokees against Augusta, but that they had received his invitation with the greatest cordiality and joy. And I should suppose the Chactahs and Chicasahs would have no objections to a saving of three hundred miles travelling. You have omitted to mention the place, only in a postscript say, "the Indians will be ordered to Dorchester." The time I presume is now uncertain; but, when you are pleased to inform me of that and the place, I shall certainly attend, if health permits.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And proposes to attend, when the time, &amp;c. is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> With respect to any reasons that may be given to the Indians, or directions about the presents, or my sentiments on the propriety of the alteration, it's needless for me to give any opinion on matters predetermined. I shall only say, that I still think the king's intentions might be more effectually executed at Augusta. I am, with great regard, Gentlemen,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Charles-Town, South-Carolina, <DATE>14th October, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have this morning been favoured with your letter of the 8th instant, upon which we think it just necessary to observe, that Augusta, its ac∣commodations and security, must have been misrepresented to us; and besides, that the getting there at all,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulty of get∣ing to Augusts very great.</NOTE> with the least degree of convenience to ourselves, was scarce possible. Mr. Stuart might have omitted acquainting your excellency with the disinclination of the Cherokees to meet at Augusta,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cherokees disinclined to meet there, and propose Saludy old-town for the congress.</NOTE> in consequence of two of their nation being killed by the Creeks; but they expressed it strongly to him, proposed Saludy old-town for the congress, and determined to wait on the path in hopes of an alteration of place. We are in great hopes, that the late outrages committed by the upper Creeks are not the acts of the nation in general;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observations on the conduct of the Creek Indians.</NOTE> but, if the generality were well inclined, they would either prevent, or punish, such frequent repetitions of insolence and murder. A letter of the 4th instant, which governor Boone has received from Augusta,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Information re∣ceived that the Up∣per-Creeks would not come at all.</NOTE> says, that none of the Creeks will be there, at the congress; if this was their resolution before the place of meeting was changed, it looks as if they could not hope, that their offences would be forgiven them: With regard to the Chactahs and Chicasahs, they are already on their route;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indians in general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> expectation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</NOTE> we all know, that two or three hundred miles to an Indian, is nothing, when he is in expectation of either rewards or revenge; and they frequently come that distance uninvited, and upon an uncertainty. We before declared, how agreeable it would have been to us, to have consulted you upon the alteration, if time would have permitted: We now express our hopes, that your arrival here, or in Dorchester, the place appointed for the congress, will be as soon as possible, that every thing may be concerted previous to the coming of the Indians; and we flatter ourselves, that, by the assistance we shall be able to give each other, that the king's instructions wlll be executed faithfully, effectually, and with dispatch.

<P>LAST night I received a letter, sent by an express, from Augusta, informing me,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He says, the Wolf king is gone to Pen∣sacola—a bad omen▪</NOTE> that the Wolf king was gone to Pensacola, to make some demands relative to the ceded lands; and giving an account of the situation of affairs in the upper Creeks, which, to say no more, I think have not a very pleasing aspect,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calls his council, on the present criti∣cal situation of In∣dian affairs.</NOTE> and made me determine to call the gentlemen of the council together, for their opinion on the present appearance of things amongst the Indians, and what may be most proper to be done, for his majesty's service in general, and the safety of this province in particular, in case Mr. Stuart cannot prevail on the Creeks to proceed to Dorchester or Charles-Town. My last, by Joyner, I wrote immediately on the receipt of yours, on a supposition, and in hopes, that Mr. Stuart might prevail with the Creeks to proceed down: but, on the receipt of my letters last night, I began to reflect more fully on the consequence of their refusing to go any further; and the more I reflect on the critical situation of affairs with these Indians,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Much evil to be expected, if the In∣dians return in dis∣gust.</NOTE> the more I am convinced of the danger that, in all probability, will attend their returning home disgusted; and I very much fear they will not go down to Dorchester; they are not in a situation or humour to follow orders.—Nay, I am apprehensive, if they should hear of an intention to carry them down to Charles-Town, they will not come even to Augusta, and therefore I have now wrote to lieutenant Barnard and Mr. Galphin, desiring them to give Mr. Stuart their best assistance in the affair — Gentlemen at a distance, may not see or consider this matter in the light it strikes me; and a Creek war, may be as litle felt in Virginia, as the northern massacres are in this province; our commiseration is of little service to those who feel and suffer; even North and South Carolina would feel little or nothing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rupture with the Creeks, in comparison of this province: I must therefore consider this matter in a more serious light than you may; and, it is to be presumed, I am better acquainted with their situation, and our own, than gentlemen at a greater distance. And his majesty's council are unanimously and clearly of opinion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The council ad∣vise him to meet the savages at Augusta.</NOTE> that, should the Creek Indians refuse to go down to Charles-Town, and return back from Augusta displeased, at this critical conjuncture, it might be productive of the worst consequences, to his majesty's service in general, and the safety of this province in particular; and therefore, in order to prevent, if possible, the dangers that may attend their returning disgusted, have advised me, in case the Indians refuse to proceed to Charles-Town, to meet them at Augusta, as the best, if not the only, method, to prevent further misunderstandings with them, and to promote his majesty's most gracious intentions, and establishing peace and friendship with them on a more firm basis.</P>
<P>This advice entirely coincides with my own opinion; and I judge it altogether expedient for me to go up to Augusta to meet them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">He agrees with his council in that point.</NOTE> in case they will not proceed to Charles-Town, and can be prevailed on to wait at Augusta.</P>
<P>I send a person express to acquaint your excellencies with this matter. If the Indians in general go to Charles-Town, I shall attend the congress there: If they will not go, it then seems absolutely necessary for me to proceed to Augusta, 
<PB N="8" REF="009706_0008_0F7A465C55F81D70"/>
where I shall give them a talk;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And proposes to give the Indians a talk there, and also a share of presents.</NOTE> and proceed further with them, according as I find them authorized by the nation or not, and as things may be circumstanced; in which Mr. Stuart may join if he pleases. If this event should happen, I doubt not but you will join in opinion, that a proportion of the presents his majesty has been graciously pleased to send out on this occasion, will be necessary to give them. I have sent an express to Augusta, and wrote to Mr. Stuart on the subject. The bearer has orders to wait a day for any commands you may have. I am,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Letter to governor Wright.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Charles-Town, South-Carolina, <DATE>15th October, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are this moment favoured with your letter of the 11th, by express; and, after having seriously considered it, find no fresh intelligence but what our letter of yesterday observed upon; nor conceive a difficulty or objection to be started by the Creeks,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creeks objec∣tion to meet at Dor∣chester, balanced by the Cherokees disli∣king Augusta.</NOTE> against coming to Dorchester, but what may, and, according to our information, will be urged by the Cherokees, against their going to Augusta; this, in great measure, induced us to change the place appointed. The superintendent,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The superintendent, supposed to be the best judge of the dis∣position of Indians, approved the change of place.</NOTE> who is supposed to know the disposition of Indians in general, and from whom we are supposed to receive the information regarding them, so far from advancing reasons against, concurred in, the alteration of place; and we have no sort of doubt, but he will be able to reconcile the lower Creeks (for the upper will not come at all) to the meeting being held at Dorchester,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gov. Wright re∣quested to co-ope∣rate with the super∣intendent to intreat the Indians to come to Dorchester.</NOTE> especially if you should think it adviseable to go to Augusta and give him your assistance, as that will effectually prevent any ill-designing low people from instilling jealousies into the Creeks, merely because i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be more beneficial to them to have the congress at Augusta. You may observe, Sir, that they are not in a humour to follow orders: But if the Creeks, or any, after so solemn an invitation on the part of four provinces, should be either refractory or sulky, we cannot think, they should be either caressed or indulged. On the service we are now ordered by the king,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The service of the congress described.</NOTE> it is our duty, and intention, to promote the security and advantage of every colony concerned; nor can this be more effectually done, as we conceive, 
<PB N="9" REF="009706_0009_0F7A465CD306E150"/>
than by convincing each nation of Indians, that the four southern governors act in concurrence; every expression of kindness will have additional weight, and the danger of breaking with us will be evidently greater; and this is certainly the spirit of the king's intentions: we therefore must beg you to exert your influence with the Creeks, that the congress may, as it was intended, be general. We have not heard from Mr. Stuart since he left this place, so that, at present, we may presume, he sees no further objection, though apprised of all Indian intelli∣gence. We send him a copy of your letter, that, when acquainted with your doubts, he may be more attentive to remove every suspicion or umbrage.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Fort Augusta, <DATE>15th October, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I GOT to this fort the 11th current,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Only 60 Indians (Catawbas) at Au∣gusta, the 11th of October.</NOTE> where I found no other Indians than about sixty Catawbas, including women and children, who had been here about two days before my arrival. On the thirteenth, in the morning, I received a letter, by express, from lieutenant Taylor, dated 10th, referring me to the intelligence contained in the inclosed letter to your excellency, and which I imagine contains full accounts of what passes in that nation. I likewise send a duplicate of the talk sent here from the lower Creeks, by the messenger of whom Mr. Camp∣bell wrote you,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little hopes of getting the savages to Dorchester.</NOTE> with lieutenant Barnard's answer; by which your excellency, and the other governors, will be able to judge of their temper, and which gave me bad hopes of success in endeavouring to persuade them to go further.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An upper Creek warrior, &amp;c. arrive 14th Oct and with them the Chicasah leader, and a princi∣pal headman of the Chactahs.</NOTE> Yesterday in the morning, the upper Creek warrior Mustisicah, with the second man of the Tuckabatchies, and a number of their followers, came here; with them were, the leader of the Chicasahs, Pia-mattah; one considerable leading man of the Chactah nation called Red-Shoes, and about twenty Chicasahs of note, and their followers: Colbert, who had arrived some days before them, informed me, that his reception, in the Chactah nation, had been most friendly; that many of the most considerable amongst them had determined to accompany him down, but upon receiving news that two of their people were killed by the Creeks,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Chactahs kil∣led by the Creeks.</NOTE> none thought proper to venture except this Red-Shoes. Colbert adds, that the treatment which he and the Chicasahs received,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Creeks insolent to the Chicasahs &amp; Col∣bert their interpreter</NOTE> in their way through the Creek nation, was extremely insolent, and had made those Indians extremely anxious to return home; accordingly, they pressed me much to dispatch them: I invited them to come to the fort this day,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chicasahs, Creeks and Catawbas ac∣quainted with the change of place.</NOTE> with the Catawbas and Creeks; I acquainted them with the alteration of the place of meeting proposed, and the reasons for it. The Chicasah leader said, he had come a great way upon my invitation, and found himself disappointed;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chicasah leader re∣fuses to go further, yet not displeased.</NOTE> that he was too much tired to go any farther, and should return without taking any thing amiss; that such accidents were often not to be avoided; that he was glad he had seen me; and whenever he should promise me any thing, I might depend upon meeting with no disappoint∣ment. The next who spoke, was the second man of the Creeks, who said, that he had come punctually at the time, and to the place of appointment, and ex∣pected to have seen the governors; that it was their hunting season, when they should have been in the woods providing for their families, but that their time was taken up in this visit, which they should not think lost, if I would deliver the king's talk to them, and dispatch them immediately; that several of their own people had promised to attend the meeting, who were not come, but that it seemed to be the present prevailing custom for men to speak with two tongues. 
<PB N="11" REF="009706_0011_0F7A465F9DAEE080"/>
I repeated the reasons for altering the place of meeting, which I enlarged upon as much as the subject would admit, and desired they would let me know, after considering the affair maturely, whether or not they would go to Dorchester: they did not hesitate a moment, but positively refused to go one step further.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Creeks also refuse to go further.</NOTE> I then asked, if they would stay here 'till the return of a messenger I should send to the governors? this, with great difficulty, the Creeks were prevailed upon to consent to: they have agreed to wait here ten days,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">At last agree to wait ten days for the return of an express.</NOTE> at the expiration of which time, if they do not see the governors, or receive the king's message from me, they are infallibly to go away. Lieutenant Barnard sends an express to governor Wright, who will be acquainted with what has passed, about the time this reaches your excellency's hands. The bearer, Kalteisen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as undertaken to carry this with the greatest dispatch, and by him I beg to be favoured with your determination. By all the intelligence I can pick up from the traders, the Creeks were never more disposed to a rupture,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creeks seem disposed for war.</NOTE> than at this time; and as those who are now here, and who are supposed to be the best affected to us of any, are so jealous, there cannot be any room to hope, that others, who are hourly expected here, will consent to go down to Dorchester: they are conscious of their bad behaviour,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Past ill be∣haviour makes them afraid to trust them∣selves further in the set<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lements.</NOTE> and (upon Indian principles) do not choose to put themselves any more in our power, by going further into the settlements. The Wolf, and a deputation of leading men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A party of them gone to Pensacola, to prescribe bounds to the English there.</NOTE> are now gone to Pensacola, to circumscribe the limits of the garrison within such a narrow compass as will hardly allow them garden room.</P>
<P>The Chicasahs knew the determination of the Creeks to go no farther than this place (as all the Indians had received intimation of the alteration proposed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They were before apprized of the alte∣ration of place.</NOTE> and had consulted upon it, before they spoke with me). Pia mattah considered, that,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chieasah leader's remark, in case the Creeks should return disgusted.</NOTE> if the Creeks should return disgusted, it would be dangerous for him and his people to remain here, and return through their country after them; it was from this consideration that he refused to go down, although he has many other objections of seeming weight, which, however, I should have got the better of, if this material one had not occurred.</P>
<P>I find it absolutely impracticable to satisfy these Indians now here,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impossible to satis∣fy the Indians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sir Jeffery Amherst's allowance of provi∣sions.</NOTE> with the allowance of provisions stipulated by Sir Jeffery Amherst. They have always been used to a very different treatment; and such an innovation, introduced by me, would give a very unfavourable impression of me at my first entrance on the execution of my office; besides, they would be disgusted,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such an innovation, at this time, would be dangerous.</NOTE> and would probably go off; which I would by all possible means avoid, 'till I am made acquainted with the determination of yourself and the other governors, it being the general opinion of people here, that, in such an event, a Creek war would immediately take place, and by the intelligence I can procure I think it probable they are right.</P>
<P>Matters being in this situation, I have not sent any directions for the boats with the presents to return, because that may be done in sufficient time, after the return of the express, for them to be at Dorchester, if any congress do take place there. I have the honour of being, with the greatest respect, Sir,</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Talk from the lower Creeks.</NOTE>WE, headmen of the lower Creeks has heard bad talks, and are desirous to hear the truth. When we were young men, the governor of Charles-Town always spoke good and friendly to us, and told us that the path should be straight and white to the nation; and it is our desire it should so continue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They make pro∣fessions of friendship to the English.</NOTE> and to let the governors see our good intentions. We, headmen of the lower towns, will still hold the English fast by the hand; it is the great God above that gave us the knowledge so to do. We have heard a word amongst us, which has put us in a fright, and don't know what to do 'till we hear the truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">But are alarmed at some bad talks spread among them.</NOTE> We were intending down to Augusta, 'till this news came up amongst us; for we saw the great king's talk, and it was a very good one; we all got together to hear it, and, agreeable to the white people's desire, we intended to go down; it was not we lower towns only that were sent for, it was all the English friends, the upper towns, the Chicasahs, Chactahs, &amp;c. We hear the upper towns does not intend to go down; and we are afraid, that if only we lower towns go, we might be detained 'till the upper towns came down,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">And afraid to lose their horses.</NOTE> and thereby might lose our horses. These three rivers are all one people, and the upper towns does not want to go down; but we don't throw away the white people's talk; and we desire the governors to send us word,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Therefore desire to be dispatched.</NOTE> whether we lower towns may be dispatched when we go down. When the governors sees this talk, they may consider, and think that we have some reason for not coming down at the time appointed. It seems you keep your talk very private, but there is nothing to be hid from we red people: there was a red man from the Tuckabatchies went down with the white people, and when he got to Augusta, the white people desired him to go back imme∣diately, and he came away according to their desire; as he returned back, he overtook a gang of pack-horses, and kept company with them to the Oakmuljees, and a white man told him several things, but whether it be true or not we cannot tell; this man that brings us this news, is an old man, and would not tell lies: we have heard,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They suspect that the governors want their lands.</NOTE> that the governor of Charles-Town intends to buy our lands from us, as far as Ogeechie, and as high up as Broad-River; and the governor of Savannah intends to buy from us, as far as the fork of Alatamaha; and the governor of North-Carolina intends to buy as far as the Okonies: we lower people desired this man not to speak of this to any of the towns where the murder was committed, but keep it secret 'till we heard the truth: and we have sent down a red man with the white man, and we desire that the red man and white man may be paid for their trouble.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Talk to detain the Indians at Augusta, 'till the governors arrive there.</NOTE>WE, the governors to the great King George, of his colonies of South and North-Carolina, and Virginia, entertained hopes of seeing our brothers of the Indians nations at Dorchester in South-Carolina, there to brighten the chain of friendship between the white and red men, according to the directions we have received from the great king, our common father, for that purpose: which chain we are desirous to hold fast by one end; and if you are inclined to lay strong hold on the other, nothing hereafter will be able to break a single link of it, and our friendship will last, as long as the sun shall shine, or the waters flow. And to convince you, that our talk is straight, and that we do not talk with double tongues, we are determined to set out to meet you at Augusta, since you find the difficulties so great to come so near to Charles-Town: no difficulties can stop us, the great king's appointed governors, from executing his orders.</P>

The great king's design, in ordering all his governors to act in concert as one man, and in inviting all the nations bordering on these colonies, to hear his talk, was directly contrary to what you have heard; for we shall there declare, that your lands will not be taken from you; and this is to be done before you all, and not in secret, that no nation of Indians may be ignorant of his gracious intentions, and of his fatherly care of the red as well as the white. We have sent this talk previous to our coming, but which we shall follow immediately, to convince you of our sincerity, and to

<P>LAST night I was honoured with your excellencies letter of 15th current, inclosing a copy of governor Wright's letter of 11th and your answer; and before now governor Boone must have received my letter of 16th, by express, in which I fully informed him of my transactions with the Indians, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lower Creeks and Cherokees expected at Augusts 20th of October.</NOTE> and of their absolute refusal to proceed to Dorchester. The lower Creeks and Cherokees will be here this day, being only a few miles off.

A regard to your excellencies conveniency, induced me to acquiese in your proposal of altering the place of meeting, and to use my utmost endeavours to reconcile the Indians to that measure, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Stuart suspects the Indians to be privately tampered with by the traders.</NOTE> although I then expressed a doubt of being able to prevail on the Creeks to proceed further into the settlements, having had no intelligence from the upper Creeks, Chactahs, and Chicasahs, or answer to the invitation I sent them, on the part, and by order, of the king, to meet your excellencies and me, upon the special service we have in charge. I could not be certain of success, and I did not doubt but your excellencies had resolved on the measures to be pursued by you in case of a disappointment. I am conscious of having done my duty, by endeavouring to remove their jealousies, and using every argument that occurred to me, to induce them to proceed. If the Indians be privately tampered with (which I suspect) it must be by the traders, the very channel through which I am obliged to converse with them. My best endeavours to engage the good offices of the traders, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And doubts his own influence as su∣perintendent.</NOTE> on this occasion, have and shall not be wanting; but my influence may possibly be very insufficient, for, as matters are now situated, they have nothing to fear or hope from my authority as super∣intendent: but perhaps Mr. Wright's endeavours may be more efficacious, and I learn that he is soon expected.</P>

I arrived in the Chactah nation; and on my arrival I called all the headmen of the Chactahs together, and there delivered my message: but none of the headmen of the French party would come to hear it. The talk was very agreeable to them of the English party, and they all with one consent agreed to come down.</P>
<P>August 3d. I arrived in the Chicasah nation. Two days before my arrival there, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Chactah killed by the Creeks.</NOTE> there came a Chactah fellow from the Breed camp, giving an account, that the Creeks had killed the Chactah that went to the Breed camp with Mr. Buckles, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chicasah kill three French men, a Indian women, and take a negro boy.</NOTE> and that he, the same fellow, narrowly made his escape. Four Chica∣sahs that had been at war, and having strayed from the rest of their gang, came on a camp of people, and killed three Frenchmen and two Indian women, and took a negro boy alive.</P>
<P>On the 5th of August. I had a talk with the headmen of the Chicasahs, and they were all agreed thereto.</P>
<P>12th. A runner came to me from the Chactahs, and acquainted me, that none of them would go down, on account of the Creeks being at war with them.</P>
<P>13th. This day I sent a runner back. And on the 22d I received an answer, that none of them would go down, by reason of the Creeks killing one of their people, and threatening destruction to them all; and that, if they should go down, it might be a detriment to their brethren the Chicasahs, for which reason they referred it, and concluded to go to war, to take satisfaction for the man <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chicasahs de∣termine to go to war against the Creeks.</NOTE> they lost.</P>
<P>August 25th. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three traders killed by the Creeks, and their goods taken.</NOTE> News came from the Creeks, that three white men were killed, and all their goods taken; and that the Mortar threatened to kill every white man that should come up to the Chicasah nation.</P>
<P>28th. A headman came from the Chactahs, and desired the Chicasahs to act for them as they would for themselves, and the Chactahs would stand to every thing or proposal, the same as if they themselves were present. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chactahs re∣quest the Chicasahs to act for them at the congress.</NOTE></P>
<P>30th. The Chicasahs held a council, whether it was proper for them to go down or no; and, after five days deliberation, they concluded to go down, and pitched on the seventh day of September for their setting off.</P>
<P>September 17th. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creeks threa∣ten to kill the Chi∣casahs.</NOTE> I arrived at the Breed camp, and there met with very bad talks, hearing of the Creeks threatening to kill the Chicasahs.</P>
<P>23d. I set out from the Breed camp.</P>
<P>25th. I arrived in the Waukakoes, with the Chicasahs, and was well treated there.</P>
<P>26th. I arrived in the Oakchoys, with the Chicasahs. And there I invited

the Oakchoy king down:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oakchoy king's reason for not at∣tending the gover∣nors.</NOTE> All the reason he had for his not coming, was, that the governor would not send him a negro boy, to mind his stock while he came to see the governor.</P>
<P>27th. The Chicasahs had a talk in the Oakchoy square, giving very good talks: And the Oakchoy king told the Chicasahs, that if it was good talks that the governors gave below, it would be better times than ever has been; but if bad talks, he would not cut his land in pieces and give it away to the white people for nothing.</P>

<HEAD>Talk to the Indians.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and brothers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are come here in the name, and by the command of the great King George, who, under God, the master and giver of breath, is your and our common father and protector.</P>
<P>The talk you are now to hear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commanded by the king.</NOTE> is from the great king, and ordered to be delivered to you by four governors of different provinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Superintendent to be regarded as the mouth of the four governors.</NOTE> and the superintendent, who is equally connected with all; for this reason, he is pitched upon to be our mouth.</P>
<P>Our words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their unanimity.</NOTE> our hearts, our intentions are the same; as our respective provinces join together, so are our interests inseparable.</P>
<P>No conference was ever intended to be more general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference Intended to be general;</NOTE> none more friendly.</P>
<P>This is not a partial meeting of one nation of Indians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not a partial one.</NOTE> with one governor; but the great king's good disposition towards his red children, is to be communicated to you, in the presence of one another.</P>
<P>His goodness is as extensive as the dominions he possesses;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great goodness of the king to the In∣dians.</NOTE> at a time when he has nothing to apprehend from any enemies, he opens his arms to receive his red children;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who have been deceived by.</NOTE> and he does it the rather at this juncture, as he knows the insinuations and falshoods, which have been formerly circulated among you, by the per∣fidious and cruel French.</P>
<P>We desire you to recollect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And dupes to the French.</NOTE> in how many instances they have misled and deceived you; you well remember their lies, and have been the dupes of their promises.</P>
<P>They are never easy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French rest∣less mischievous in∣cendiaries.</NOTE> unless engaged in mischief themselves, or when engaging others; incapable of supplying your wants, they endeavour to detach you, from your best and only friends the English.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="009706_0024_0F7A466AC8D615C0"/>
The great king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great king's intentions explain'd</NOTE> who wishes to extend the commerce of his subjects, to live in peace and friendship, and relieve the distress of all mankind, bore with uncommon patience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His patience with the French,</NOTE> the repeated insults and excessive cruelties, which the French alone could perpetrate; to cruelty they added treachery and perfidy: fair speeches were in their mouths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who are not to be trusted.</NOTE> but mischief in their hearts; and when they did not act openly themselves, they deceived and instigated the red people to outrages, which could only end in separating them from the white people, with whom they ought, for the advantage of both, to be united.</P>
<P>At length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His moderation described.</NOTE> when the great king saw his moderation disregarded, his children plundered and destroyed, and that the French were resolved to contend with him for superiority, that one country in short, could not hold them both: he then exerted himself like a man;<NOTE PLACE="marg">And his power, in soon subduing the French &amp; Spaniards.</NOTE> and, in a short time, defeated and humbled that perfidious enemy, and also the Spaniards, who, by the fatal and mischievious practices of the French, had been involved in the quarrel.</P>
<P>The king has now given peace to both nations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He gives them peace.</NOTE> and to prevent the revival of such disturbances and troubles, by repetitions of such dangerous proceedings, and for this purpose only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And fixes their boundaries.</NOTE> he insisted, in the treaty of peace, that the French and Spaniards should be removed beyond the river Missisippi, that the Indians and white people may, hereafter, live in peace and brotherly friendship together: It will be your faults,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fault of the Indi∣ans, If they do not live in peace with the English.</NOTE> if this does not happen, for we are authorized by the great king, to give you the most substantial proofs of our good intentions, and desire to live like brothers with you.</P>
<P>If you bring the same friendly disposition, what can you desire more, than a repetition of the assurances already given you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indians lands not to be invaded.</NOTE> by the king's orders, with regard to your lands; which we now from our hearts confirm.</P>
<P>Do we not act like friends and brothers, when we declare, that all past offences shall be buried in oblivion and forgivenness;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All past offences forgiven.</NOTE> and this we do, because we are persuaded, that the French imposed on your credulity, and deceived you.</P>
<P>Do you wish for any thing more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indians shall have plenty of goods but must protect the traders.</NOTE> than to be plentifully supplied with goods, by the white people, who alone can supply you; this we promise you, but it must also depend on yourselves, for those nations where traders reside, must provide for their security, or no man will stay with them.</P>
<P>Besides this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Justice promised them upon all oc∣casions.</NOTE> we engage as far as we can for ourselves, and those under our controul, to manifest an attention to your interests, and a readiness to do you justice upon all occasions.</P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And the forts ce∣ded to us, shall be employed for their protection.</NOTE> we promise you faithfully and solemnly, that those forts now ceded to us by the French, shall be employed for your protection, assistance and con∣venience; and for the better carrying on trade with you, by which we all shall be benefitted.</P>
<P>Consider now like wise men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indians ad∣monished to consider of the Indulgences shewn them.</NOTE> whether this is the language of ill designing people; whether there is any occasion at this time, to make you such friendly assurances, unless it was our intention to keep our words.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="009706_0025_0F7A466B842F8C68"/>
The white people value themselves on speaking truth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The congress or∣dered to be so gene∣ral, to prevent jea∣lousies.</NOTE> but to give still greater weight to what we say, the great king has thought proper, as we observed before, that his four governors and the superintendent, from a great distance, should utter the same words, at the same time; and to remove every umbrage or jealousy, that you should all hear them, in presence of one another, and bear testimony for one another, in case we should ever act contrary to our declarations.</P>

Although his skin is not white, his heart is so, and as much so as any white man. He has now done on that subject, and will proceed to something else.</P>
<P>He wants not to imitate other Indian nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disapprove the conduct of other in∣dians.</NOTE> and declares he cannot do without the white people, and that he believes it is the same case with all the red people: He cannot find out the reason why other red people are not as he is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons assigned for the frequent dis∣turbances that hap∣pen between the white &amp; red people.</NOTE> he leaves it to the governors to find it; yet he will give you his sentiments, viz. He and every one with him are of opinion, that so many white men being among the Indians, as traders, is the occasion thereof, and he thinks in time it may be his case to act like other red people; the great numbers of traders create disturbances between the red and the white people; he has a very great regard for the white people, but they have not for one another. This is from his heart, and he hopes to be believed; the young people may become outrageous, and mischief he done, because the traders will not stay in one place, and before he can interpose, harm may happen; he hopes not to be doubted as to the truth, he therefore desires,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The headmen re∣ferred to.</NOTE> that the headmen may be asked, and they will confirm what he says.</P>
<P>He never saw either of the governors, yet was always in their interest, as having heard well of them, and is willing to convince them in any shape.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They desire an an∣swer▪</NOTE> He has now given his talk, and would be glad of an answer.</P></Q>
<P>Which request being considered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is promised them.</NOTE> he was desired to proceed, and he should have an answer to the whole at once. He then went on as follows, viz.</P>
<P>"Many white people go through his towns to trade with the Chactahs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They desire the number of traders may be lessened,</NOTE> he would not have the whole stopped, the number only lessened."</P>
<P>And upon his being asked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The name two, whom they would have continued,</NOTE> what number would be sussicient to supply his own towns? he replied, "Heyrider and John Brown were enough, and he desired no more."</P>
<P>POUCHIMATAHAH, the second man of the Chicasahs, then said, "It is not out of any Ill-will to other traders, but that the two above mentioned have always been with them; he is heartily glad to see his brothers here in health; and that he only reminded his brother Piamatah relative to the above two traders."</P>
<P>Stephen Forrest, interpreter for the Creeks.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN ALECK,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creek's talk.</NOTE> for the upper and lower Creeks, delivered himself thus,</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>He is glad to see you all here, and having received a good talk, will now give his, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="009706_0027_0F7A466D0F5B88A8"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt.

Formerly they had a good talk from the great king George, and such shall always remain with them; that the lower towns were always well inclined; and as for the white people, he desires they may remain quiet among them.</P></Q>
<P>TELLETCHER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Creek de∣scribes boundaries.</NOTE>, the second Creek, then declared, "That the red people were formerly ignorant, but God Almighty, and the king of England, had made them otherways; and proposed, that the lands above the rocks, should remain unsettled; and that the line, between the white people and the Indians hunting grounds, should run from the rock, down to Savannah river; and the other way, from the said rock to Mr. Galphin's cowpen; from thence to the lower ford on Ogeechie river, hear the settlement of one Lambert; and from thence to cross to Sancta Sevilla, to the Alatamaha river.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Injunction,</NOTE> Little-River by no means to be settled, but from thence.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The English to keep within the bounds that were prescribed to the Spaniards.</NOTE> St. John's (a marsh) the Spaniards only possessed, the English must not exceed the same bounds, as from thence is their hunting grounds: he has de∣scribed the bounds of the lands to the white people, and hopes they will make no encroachments upon them.</P></Q>
<P>And then Captain ALECK said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aleck complains of his lands being run out.</NOTE>, "That the lands he was settled upon, was run out, and as the governor of Georgia knew nothing of it, he desires to know from the four governors, the reasons of it." Then</P>
<P>TELLETCHER said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds of Pensa∣cola, and</NOTE> <Q>That no settlement should be made by the white people at Pensacola, but within the ebbing and flowing of the tide.</Q></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mobile, described.</NOTE> Mobile to be settled in the same manner, the tide to determine the line.</P>

<P>SYMPOYAFFEE (or Fool Harry) then said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trading in the woods complained of.</NOTE>, "As the governors had heard the rest of his nation, he hoped they would hear him. And then desired them not to suffer any people to trade in the woods, but to go into the towns to trade; no rum to be sold to the Indians in the woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Selling rum there a pernicious practice</NOTE> because the young people there got drunk, and disposed of their skins for that commodity, and so were rendered unable to pay their debts to the traders in the nation, which frequently occasioned quarrels and mischief among them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes quarrels, &amp;c</NOTE>, He speaks boldly before the whites and red, and that the reds often lend runners for rum, which he desires may be prevented; and if the governors will not forwarn the white people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If continued, the venders will suffer.</NOTE> he will not kill them, but he will take all they have from them, and ask them if they are French or Spaniards."</P>

<P>SECOND CREEK added, "As the king has been so good as to forgive, and give them a good talk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As doth another Creek Indian.</NOTE> he is in hopes the children will grow up without interruption on either side; there is a road to Charles-Town, and the line of Ogeechie is the line for the white people to grow between."

<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>Fort AUGUSTA, WEDNESDAY November 9th.</HEAD>
<P>AT a full congress of the Governors, Superintendent, Indians, &amp;c. the replies were delivered as follows.</P>
<P>ANSWER of the several governors and the superintendent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reply to the Chi∣casahs talk.</NOTE> to Pia-Mattah the Chicasah leader's talk.</P>
<Q><P>Friend, brother, and ally,</P>
<P>WE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their conduct ap∣proved.</NOTE> the several governors and superintendent, are extremely pleased with the talk you delivered the day before yesterday; as our eldest brother you began replying, and gave an example to the other Indians; your talk was as strait, and as grateful, as your conduct has been for these many years; we ac∣knowledge your fidelity; we have had repeated proofs it, and we hope that by this meeting the chain of friendship, which has long united us, will receive ad∣ditional strength and brightness.</P>
<P>The words you have uttered are those of a wise and generous man; and such as experience has taught you; you observe, that you cannot do without the white people; this is most certainly true▪ but it is as certain, that by preserving 
<PB N="33" REF="009706_0033_0F7A4673C613AA00"/>
your heart entirely English, by making their enemies, your enemies, and their friends, your friends, you have felt no wants whatever; the great king has liberally supplied you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No difficulties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obstruct their being supplied by the Eng∣lish while they be∣have well.</NOTE> he has convinced you, that let his children be ever so remote, let seas, or mountains separate them, that as long as they behave as faithfully as you have done, they never will be cast off. You say that the number of traders which pass through your country to the Chactahs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their objection to the number of tra∣ders answered.</NOTE> and the too great num∣ber which trade with your people, breed disturbances, which you may not always be at hand to prevent. You now shall have a reply to both those remarks. By the cession of Mobile to the English, the Chactah trade will be carried on from thence, because it will be more convenient to both English and Indians, so that from this time you will have no complaints of that kind to make. Your other request, that Heyrider and Brown only should traffic among you, has been considered by us as your friends, and we are persuaded that some white man for his own interest has imposed upon you.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons given why a few will not be advantageous for them.</NOTE> You may believe us as the great king's beloved men, that where the trade is in few hands the prices of goods are always higher; but if you give a preference to the traders you have mentioned, you are under no obligation to buy goods of others; if Heyrider and Brown are your friends, deal with them only; but they are more likely to continue to use you well, when you have other traders to resort to, in case they abuse you. This advice comes from us all, and we give it, because we esteem and value you. We have nothing further to add, but that you may safely rely on the continuance of that friendship and assistance which the great king has always given you.</P></Q>
<P>With which they seemed satisfied.</P>
<P>Previous to the answer to the Creeks, Forrest (the interpreter) being desired to ask Capt. Aleck, on behalf of himself and brothers, if he understood the line as settled yesterday? he answered in the affirmative. Then the reply was proceeded on, viz.</P>
<Q><P>Friends and brothers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reply to the Creeks▪</NOTE></P>
<P>IN reply to the answer of you the Creek Indians to the great king's talk, the governors and superintendent say, that your repea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed assurances, that your hearts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their answer ap∣proved.</NOTE> and the hearts of your whole people (for whom you speak) are strait and good towards the great king George and his subjects, they receive cordially; and that such friendly declarations as these duly observed on your parts, you may depend shall be properly regarded by us, who will continue to exercise the king's great benevolence and goodness to you agreeable to his talk given you at our first meeting.</P>
<P>The complaint made of straggling people going about the woods between Augusta and the Creek country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stragglers selling rum, &amp;c. in the woods, to be sup∣pressed.</NOTE> and carrying rum and other things to trade with such Indians as they may meet with when hunting, is a mischief that we are sensible of, and what we are very desirous of putting a stop to; and you may be assured, that every thing which can be done shall, in order to prevent such practices. You have also mentioned, that if any negroes run away, or horses or cattle stray, into your grounds, that you will seize upon them and keep them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negroes, horses, &amp;c. must not be seized by the Creeks.</NOTE> but, with respect to these two points, you must recollect, and well remember, the treaties and agreements you have formerly entered into with the white people, 
<PB N="34" REF="009706_0034_0F7A46748E29ABE0"/>
and that you are not to do any mischief or damage to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nishe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not to take satisfaction of the English themselves, but complain to the governors.</NOTE> or take away their property, or take any satisfaction yourselves against the white people; but if you think you receive any injury, you are to make your complaint to the governor of the province, who will always be ready to hear you, and do you justice; and this is the method you must observe, and not attempt to do any mischief to the white people, or take away the goods and horses of such as you may find trading in the woods, for that would be contrary to your former engagements, which are still binding, and must be observed and kept; but you must complain against them to the governor; and you well remember, that, by a former treaty, you<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are remind∣ed of rewards allow∣ed for taking up ne∣groes, &amp;c.</NOTE> are allowed a reward for taking up negroes that run away from their masters, and you will still be rewarded for taking up any such. You know it is very difficult to prevent negroes from running away, and cattle and horses from ram∣bling, and it would be unjust in you to claim them as your own for straying into your lands, at the same time you may be assured that the utmost care will be taken to prevent it.</P>
<P>And here we think it necessary to observe, that great complaints have been made by the traders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charged with steal∣ing traders horses,</NOTE> that some of you have stolen their horses, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> refuse to deliver them when found in your possession; also by several of the inhabitants, that you wantonly kill their cattle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And wantonly kil∣ling cattle.</NOTE> and that, even since the holding of the con∣gress, several cattle in this neighbourhood have been wantonly shot, and the car∣casses left on the spot. If these things be true, it is not agreeable to the friendly declarations made by you, and we expect that nothing more of this sort be done for the future.</P>
<P>We have examined the commission delivered by Togulkie, and have heard and believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The governors will not interfere in the choice of emperors, but approve them when chosen.</NOTE> that his father was a great king and warrior in the Creek country, and we hope Togulkie may be so too; but we shall not interfere with you in the choice or appointment of your emperors or kings, but whenever you shall agree amongst yourselves upon the election or choice of an emperor, we shall be ready to confirm such choice.</P>
<P>Capt. Aleck has mentioned a claim to his settlement at Sancta Sevilla, which he says has been run out;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aleck's charge of encroaching on his land, answered.</NOTE> as to which the governors observe, that they know of no survey being made on any settlement of his; that if any such thing is done, it is without their privity; and, if the lands are really his, nothing that has been done can affect his property, but he will continue to enjoy them.</P>
<P>You have proposed enlarging and extending the boundaries or limits of the lands to the westward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His proposal to enlarge the western boundary.</NOTE> which may be settled by the white people; and this you declare to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And reasons why.</NOTE> in gratitude and return for the great clemency and generosity shewn to you by his majesty, and which in his name we agree to accept of: So that, for the future, the settlements of the white people are to extend up Savannah river to Little river, and back to the fork of Little river, and from the fork of Little river to the ends of the south branch of Briar creek, and down that branch to the Lower-Creek path, and along the Lower-Creek path to the main stream of Ogeechie river, and down the main stream of that river just below the path leading from Mount-Pleasant, and from thence in a strait line cross to Sancta Sevilla on the Alatamaha river, and from thence to the southward as far as 
<PB N="35" REF="009706_0035_0F7A46754F5CFFA8"/>
Georgia extends or may be extended, to remain to be regulated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The enlargement described.</NOTE> agreeable to former treaties, and his majesty's royal instruction, a copy of which was lately sent to you; and this matter may be more particularly mentioned and described in the treaty which we shall now propose to be made between us.</P></Q>
<P>Upon an explanation of the boundary line in the talk to them, they were again asked, if they <HI>clearly</HI> understood it? to which they all, and the Wolf king in particular, answered in the affirmative.</P>
<P>"And as to what you have mentioned about the lands to the southward of Georgia, near St. Augustine, Pensacola and Mobile; these are matters that the great king has not impowered us to talk with you about: he has appointed go∣vernors for those countries, who will soon come over and be there; and we shall acquaint them with what you have said, and must leave you to talk with them and settle that matter, for we cannot do any thing in it."</P>
<P>REPLY to Red Shoes, the Chactah leader (Colbert interpreter.)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reply to the Chac∣tahs.</NOTE></P>
<Q><P>Friend and brother,</P>
<P>YOUR talk was but short, but we are well satisfied with it; we are sorry for any accident which prevented more of your people from complying with the great king's invitation; as they are not come, you must be more careful to remember what you have heard, and to relate it to your nation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Admonished to re∣member what they have heard.</NOTE> you desire to be under the English as the other red people are; do you behave as well as faithful as the Chicasahs, your friends, and you will meet with the same treatment from the English; probably long before you get home, plenty of English goods will be in your nation; in your transactions with the white people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And advised to co∣py the Chicasahs.</NOTE> take the Chi∣casahs for your pattern, they have reaped the advantage of our friendship, and we sincerely hope that your whole nation will embrace the offers of good will which we have made you, and that one heart only may be in the bosoms of the white people and the Chactahs.</P></Q>
<P>With this talk Red-Shoes was well pleased.</P>
<P>REPLY to the Cherokees (Watts interpreter.)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reply to the Che∣rokees.</NOTE></P>
<Q><P>Cherokee friends and brothers,</P>
<P>THE governors and superintendent observe with pleasure the good disposition with which you are come to this meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their behaviours applauded.</NOTE> apparent in your talks and in your countenances; and the just sense you shew of the great king's kind and fatherly intentions to you and all his red people and children.</P>
<P>In your answers to the talk delivered from him, you mention two points, to each of which you will now receive particular answers. The first relates to the trade carried on between the white people and your towns; the other to the lands on which the white people are settled. As to the trade, you have goods sent among you by almost all the colonies over which we preside;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why few traders go amongst them.</NOTE> but the prices you are inclined to give for goods are so small, that few traders choose to carry goods into your towns: You must consider, that if traders do not make an advantage of their goods, they will not carry them; you would do the same yourselves.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="009706_0036_0F7A46760DAFDC48"/>
The trade of South Carolina stands on another footing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And why a factory was settled at Kee∣howee.</NOTE> At the time the path into your towns was but lately cleared from blood; to preserve it clean, to pre∣vent the same mischiefs from being repeated, which had been occasioned by the madness of your young men, and the misbehaviour of our traders, a factory was settled at Keehowee, and a trader whom we can depend upon for using you well established there;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keehowee a plen∣tiful and cheap place for goods.</NOTE> plenty of goods are constantly kept for your supply, and the price as low or lower than any private trader can afford them: This regulation the province of South Carolina cannot alter, because it has been laid before the king; it is in his power, and in his alone, to make an alteration; and until this is done, South-Carolina has not the power of lending private traders.</P>
<P>In North Carolina there are no Indian traders at all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Indian traders from North Carolina.</NOTE> either to your nation or any other.</P>
<P>And as to Virginia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virginia traders at liberty to go among them or not.</NOTE> the traders there are free to carry up their goods or not, as they find their advantage. There are no laws to compel them to go, or to<NOTE PLACE="marg">They cannot be compelled.</NOTE>restrain them from going. Every man carries up his goods as he thinks proper, and sets such prices upon them, as he judges will answer his expence in carrying them up into your towns. You are also free to purchase them or not, as you approve of the prices set upon them. And all we have to add on this subject is, that the government of Virginia sets no prices on the goods sent up to you, but leaves you and the traders to agree upon the price in such manner as is suitable to you both.</P>
<P>We shall now come to the other point relative to lands. You have complained of settlements being made on the part of Virginia to the westward of the New river, and desire no further settlements may be made there. In order to comply strictly with the great king's instructions, copies of which you have among you, and that we may in no shape deceive you, we will explain the state of those settlements.</P>
<P>By a former governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lands run out explained.</NOTE> and above twenty since, a large grant of lands in that part of the country was made to one col. Patten, who under that grant sold out parcels of the land to people who settled there: In these settlements you have acquiesced without complaint to this time, as they are at a great distance from your country. Another large grant was also made by the great king just before the breaking out of the war with the French; but those disturbances prevented many persons settling un∣der that grant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No intrusion upon them made or in∣tended.</NOTE> and by the king's late instructions to the governor of Virginia no land can be granted even so far as the eastern banks of that river. And in obe∣dience to that instruction not a foot has been since granted upon that river, so that you have nothing further to apprehend on that account. And we now take this opportunity to confirm you in your security, by assuring you, that on the return of the governor of Virginia into his colony, all treaties will be carefully examined, and punctually observed, and you may depend on strict justice being done to you. It is possible, some idle persons may sit down on lands without any authority whatever:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Any idle people settling upon them to be removed on complaint made.</NOTE> But this you ought not to consider as an act of the government, which does not nor ever will countenance and protect people settling in that manner, but heartily concur with you in removing them on complaint made by you to the governor for that purpose.</P>

In relation to the settlements above Long Canes in South Carolina, those set∣tlements were allowed and agreed to in the treaty of peace signed at the close of the last war, by lieutenant-governor Bull and Attakullakuila, between the white people and your nation.</P></Q>

<Q><P>Col. Ayres, and brothers of the Catawbas,</P>
<P>IT gives us great pleasure and satisfaction, to find that the good talk which we gave you from our great king, and father of both his white and red children, is so satisf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctory to you. As you have always been fast friends to all his white children, so our king and father holds out his arms to receive and protect you from all your enemies; and is very sensible of your constant love and friendship for all your white brothers: And you may be assured of his confirming to you, all your just claims to your lands and hunting grounds, pursuant to the agreement made between your nation, and his governor of South Carolina, and Mr. Atkin his supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>intendent of Indian affairs, upon your having a fort built for your pro∣tection from your enemies, when you deserted your old towns; which was then agreed upon, on both sides, to be a square of fifteen miles, to be laid out on both sides of the Catawba river, and part of the line was actually surveyed.</P>
<P>If you stand to your former agreement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their hunting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be secu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to them.</NOTE> your lands shall be immediately sur∣veyed and marked out for your use; but it you do not, your claim must be un∣decided, 'till our great king's pieasure is known on the other side the water.</P></Q>
<P>The talk being given to the Indians, the Cherokees acknowledged, of their own accord, that they had claimed more than were their hunting grounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cherokees confess they have clai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed more lands than be∣long to them.</NOTE> and what they now desired, was, that they might not be molested in hunting as far as the spring head of Holston river. They desired the governors to write to Mr. Wilkinson at Keehowee, to send goods from thence to Estatowih; to which it was replied, that the governors had it not in their power, the great king had ordered it otherwise.</P>
<P>The Catawhas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Catawhas are promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d an imme∣diate survey of their lands.</NOTE> upon appearing satisfied with the line of fifteen miles square, were informed, that a new survey should be made, and when the line was run the people settled within should be removed, and no new warrants granted them, or any others to settle within those limits: Upon which they desired a new line would be run out immediately.</P>
<P>The Catawbas being asked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And they choose col. Ayres for their emperor.</NOTE> if they approved Colonel Ayres as their chief or emperor? answered unanimously, yes. In consequence of such their declaration, the governors and superintendent accepted him.</P>
<P>Then the question was put to the respective chiefs of the several tribes of In∣dians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A treaty of peace proposed and agreed to.</NOTE> whether in consequence of their good professions towards the English, they were inclined to enter into a treaty of peace, &amp;c. and in writing for that

<SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to the king's commands,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Letter to the se∣cretary of state</NOTE> signified to us severally by your lord∣ship, by letter of the 16th of March, we have met the different chiefs of the Chicasahs, Cherokees, Creeks, Chactahs and Catawbas, and have used our utmost endeavours to carry his majesty's intentions into execution.</P>
<P>The removal of the French and Spaniards from the ceded places, which your lordship meant the Indians should be apprized of by us, they were before ac∣quainted with; this was unavoidable; the dispatching of invitations to nations so remote as the Chactahs and Chicasahs, necessarily took up a great deal of time, their consultations upon them not much less, and their journey hither still more; however, my lord, we do not apprehend, that their receiving the above intelli∣gence from other hands has been detrimental to the king's service. The Chica∣sahs, ever faithful to the British interest, are perfectly satisfied with the change. The Chactah leader, now in confederacy with the Chicasahs, had before made repeated offers of declaring against the French, provided he was supplied with English goods; and seems well pleased with the neighbourhood of the English, whose assistance he had before courted: We have, in our reply to him, given him reason to expect, that, by the time he reaches home, there will be traders in his nation by the way of Mobile; and we beg leave to recommend to your lordship, that the Chactahs be supplied with goods from that quarter, as a mea∣sure necessary to confirm them in their present professions, and to render them independent of the Creeks, against whom they may be a very useful check when their supplies are no longer so precarious, as they now are by passing through the Creek country. The Creeks had been represented to be very ill disposed, the murders they had committed were frequent, and even subsequent to the receipt of your lordship's letter; and even since the holding of the congress, though amply supplied with provision, they have been accused of wantonly killing the people's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ yet their talks have been more friendly than we expected, and their voluntary offer of an augmentation of boundary to Georgia, upon the king's forgivenness of all past injuries being signified to them, supposing their professions sincere, and the chiefs of consequence enough to act for the whole nation, which they declare they do, is certainly as strong a proof as they can at present give of their good-will, it will be necessary, however, to mention to your lordship, that we have been privately cautioned, by the leader of the Chicasahs, against confiding in the Creek professions; he says he knows them, that nothing done here will be confirmed by the absent leaders, in comparison of whom the present chiefs are in∣considerable: The Cherokees, in their intelligence, have gone still farther, but as they seem on the point of a war with the Creeks, their testimony is to be sus∣pected. Though the talks will convey to your lordship our opinions of the 
<PB N="43" REF="009706_0043_0F7A467C0392C798"/>
different dispositions or the Indians, yet we thought necessary to add thus much, and to acquaint your lordship, that the Cherokees seem very pacific, but morti∣fied at the refusal of traders from South-Carolina, which the act now in force there prevents their being gratified with. And we beg leave to observe to your lordship on this head, that the general promise of goods which we have made, by the king's orders, to the respective Indians, requires such a performance as it is impossible, circumstanced as we are, to be answerable for, for we have no coer∣cive power over traders. Your lordship will pardon us for suggesting, that there never was a time more seasonable, for the establishing the commerce with In∣dians, upon a general, safe, equitable footing, and which we are afraid will never be done by respective provinces. The Catawbas boundary as before agreed upon, is now confirmed, and they are well satisfied with it. Permit us to refer your lordship, for all further particulars of the congress, to the original papers which we shall have the honour of transmitting with the utmost dispatch, and to hope that we have faithfully executed the king's commands, and approved ourselves,</P>
