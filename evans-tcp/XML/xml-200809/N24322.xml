<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN it pleased God to manifest the glorious Dispensation of his blessed Son, our Lord and Saviour, in the Flesh, Apostles were called and sent forth in his service, and numbers believed in his name. These were to receive Power from on high after that the Holy Ghost had come upon them, for which they were commaded to wait, and accordingly they were endued with the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>In the early times of Christianity it was found necessary for the Apostles, Disciples, and Believers, to meet often together for the consolation and strengthening one of another, when pursuant to the very nature and design of the Gospel, which brought Peace on Earth, and good will to Men, a Care arose for the esta∣blishment and edification of the Church, and their labour was, that all should be of one mind and become as one Family.</P>
<P>But in succession of time the simplicity and good purpose of such Meetings declined, and a particular set of Men, for worldly and carnal ends, assumed an authority, exercising Lordship over the Flock (observing the command of our Lord so far only as to retain the name of Servants, when nothing was less in their view) pomp and power were assumed, and they made a distinction of themselves by the aggrandizing name of the Peculiar Heritage of God, and then social Good, and Charity in Mind and Practice was very much lost.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="032162_0007_0FF165C0EAF4B058"/>And as it hath pleased the Lord in these latter days, to call a People to freedom, and from under that unwarrantable Yoke of Bondage, so he hath been pleased to raise in the Hearts of his Servants that primitive Love and Good will which eminently dis∣tinguished his Disciples; wherein they have been persuaded and directed, by his wisdom and power, to have Meetings established for like good purposes as in the primitive times, therein to wor∣ship him, and have oversight, care, and compassion one over ano∣ther, and to endeavour that all may walk humbly, decently and honestly, and be of one mind, as becomes the Servants and Fol∣lowers of our holy Lord.</P>
<P>This is called our Discipline, in the exercise whereof Persuasion and gentle Dealing is and ought to be our practice; and when any, after all our Christian endeavours cannot be reclaimed, the extent of our judgment is Censure, or disowning such to be of our religious Communion. And as this authority and Practice is Christian, so it is laudable and reasonable in Society; for the good and reputation of the whole Body ought to claim our greatest re∣gard, subordinately including that of every Member. Hence arises a care and concern for Decency and comely order in all our Meet∣ings for Worship and Discipline, as well as honesty, plainness and orderly walking in all the Members of our religious Society, that others seeing our good works may be induced to glorify our Fa∣ther who is the Author of them, and thereby be brought into that Faith which works by Love to the purifying of the Heart.</P>
<P>And for the worship of God, and the more regular and easy proceeding in the service and discipline of the Church, Meetings have been by Divine assistance, as above hinted, set up and esta∣blished, serviceable and subordinate to each other, as particular
<PB N="vii" REF="032162_0008_0FF165C2CA312568"/>
Meetings for worship, one or more of which constitute a Prepara∣tive Meeting. Monthly, which mostly take in several particular or Preparative Meetings, who are to meet together once a month. Quarterly, including so many monthly Meetings as may under right direction most usefully meet together once every three months. And Yearly, which is composed of so many Quarterly Meetings as may most conveniently attend the same; each of which have their respective Powers and Service for the well ordering of Society, and advancement of Truth and Righteousness.</P>
<P>And whereas it hath been experienced, that in these Meetings great comfort, support, and satisfaction have been received and enjoyed, when the members have attended them in awe, humility, and love, with no other views but the service of God, and the help and assistance one of another, all friends who are, or would be, accounted members of those Meetings, are, in brotherly love exhorted, that they come together in uprightness and singleness of heart, suitable to our calling, and the dignity of that power, which, as we rightly and meekly so demean ourselves, will preside and govern in all our Meetings; and there we ought to wait for the spirit of Meekness and Charity, which is the essential adorning which God will beautify and cloath his true Church with, with∣out which none can be truly Members thereof, nor really service∣able therein. This will divest of Partiality, stiffness in opinion, and high thoughts of ourselves, or of our own strength and abili∣ties, and raise in us Patience and condescension, according to that excellent admonition of our Blessed Lord, who knows the secrets of all Hearts, <Q>But he that is greatest among you shall be your Servant.</Q> Matt. XXIII. 11.22.26. 1719</P>

<HEAD>APPEALS.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Liberty of ap∣peal.</NOTE>IF any persons are dissatisfied with, or do think themselves ag∣grieved by the testimony or judgment entered against them in a monthly-meeting, they may have liberty at the same, or the next,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notice of ap∣pealing to be given to month∣ly-meeting;</NOTE> or the third monthly-meeting, but not after, to notify their intentions of making application to have the cause heard at the next quarterly-meeting; which notification the said monthly-meet∣ing should enter on their minutes, and appoint four, or more Friends (not excluding others) to take a copy of the meeting's records in the case, signed by the clerk, and therewith attend the said quarterly-meeting; and there on the monthly-meeting's be∣half, shew their reasons for what is done, submitting the same to the said quarterly-meeting. And the said quarterly-meeting is to hear and consider, and confirm or reverse the same, as they in the wisdom which God shall afford them may see most just and neces∣sary.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to quarter∣ly-meetings of appeal to year∣ly-meeting.</NOTE> And if the parties should be dissatisfied with the judgment of the said quarterly-meeting, and do notify the same, or the next quarterly-meeting, but not after, their intention of making appli∣cation for a hearing at the next yearly-meeting; the said quarterly-meeting shall in like manner make entry thereof, appoint four, or six Friends to attend the yearly-meeting, with the records of both monthly and quarterly-meetings in the case, signed as aforesaid, and speak to the matter, where the same is to be finally deter∣mined. 1719.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Notice of dis∣ownment of a member to be given.</NOTE>And in all cases where a meeting finds itself under the necessity of disowning any member, let such member have notice thereof, either by the meetings acquainting him or her thereof, if present, or, if absent, by sending a Friend or two for that purpose. Like∣wise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Copy of judg∣ment to be giv∣en.</NOTE> when the judgment or testimony is made, let a copy thereof be delivered, or, by two Friends, sent to the party, with notice of the privilege of appealing, if he or she is dissatisfied.</P>

<HEAD>ARBITRATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE any difference arises between Friends about their worldly property, in which there appears, to overseers or other active judicious Friends, to be cause of dispute, or diversity of sentiment, let all proceed in the following manner:— 1719.</P>
<P N="1">1st. The party thinking he hath reason of complaint is himself calmly to speak,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences a∣bout property, how to be de∣termined.</NOTE> or if he lives at a distance too great to do it in person, write to the party by whom he thinks himself injured, and endeavour by gentle means, in a brotherly manner, to obtain his right; but if that doth not prevail, then let him, or if they live at a distance, as aforesaid, some Friend whom he may write to and empower on his behalf, take one or two of the overseers or other judicious and discreet Friends, and in like manner make his claim, and they unitedly are to labour for a just and expeditious settlement of the matter.</P>
<P N="2">2d. If this step fails of success,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advice to refer them to arbi∣trators.</NOTE> the Friends accompanying are to persuade and admonish the parties to choose a suitable num∣ber of Friends as arbitrators, and engage themselves to each other in a proper manner, to stand to, and abide by, the determina∣tion of such arbitrators. If either of the parties refuse comply∣ing with such advice, he or she so refusing ought to be complained of to the preparative meeting, by one of the overseers, or by the party complainant, on neglect of the overseers, of which, when intended, the other party is to have notice, that he or she may be present, as he or she ought to be.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The party com∣plained of to be notified when to be carried to monthly-meet∣ing.</NOTE> And if the parties cannot there be brought to an agreement to refer the difference by choos∣ing arbitrators, the complaint is to be carried forward by that meeting to the monthly-meeting, with previous notice also to the party complained of, and a desire to attend; where the first in∣quiry should be, whether the abovementioned Gospel order has been duly observed? if not, the complainant is to be referred back thereto, and no notice taken thereof on the minutes; but if it hath, the monthly-meeting is to advise the hearing and determina∣tion
<PB N="12" REF="032162_0012_0FF165CE2CA657F8"/>
thereof out of meeting; and in order thereto, the parties should each nominate one or more Friends for determining the difference, and bind themselves to abide by their decision, as may be agreed on.</P>
<P N="3"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arbitrators to be chosen.</NOTE>3d. If the parties, or either of them, neglect to attend the meeting, without sending a sufficient reason, or refuse to nomi∣nate and choose arbitrators as aforesaid, the meeting, after la∣bouring with the party so neglecting or refusing, should testify their disunion with such offender, if he or she cannot be brought to comply with what is above advised and required, or to settle the difference without; and where arbitrators are chosen in any case, they ought, as speedily as may be, to appoint time and place, and duly attend the business, by giving the parties and their witnesses a full and fair hearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hearing of the matter.</NOTE> in the presence of each other, using all caution and care to avoid unnecessary delay, and to make the determination within the time appointed.</P>
<P N="4"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Party refusing to appear be∣fore arbitrators, to be disowned.</NOTE>4th. If either party refuse to attend the arbitrators, and sub∣mit his or her case, or to stand to and abide the award when made, such party must be dealt with as disorderly, and regardless of peace and unity; and after due admonition, if he or she persists therein, let such be disowned.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Re-hearing, when to be al∣lowed.</NOTE>5th. And where bonds or other engagements are entered into by the parties, the award ought to be final, unless the dissatisfied party do make it evident to the satisfaction of the monthly-meet∣ing, that there is manifest error or injustice in the same; and when that is made thus to appear, the matter is to be re-considered by the same or other arbitrators, as in the judgment of the said meet∣ing may seem best; and such correcting judgment shall be final.</P>
<P N="6"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suing without taking these steps to be dis∣owned.</NOTE>6th. It is the sense of this meeting, that if any person in reli∣gious membership with us shall arrest, or sue at law, any other Friend, in such disputed matters, not being under a necessity so to do, in the judgment of the monthly-meeting, or of a few solid, active, judicious, concerned Friends, consulted in cases of emer∣gency, before he hath proceeded as herein before directed, that such person doth therein depart from the principle of truth, and the known way thereof, and ought to be dealt with by the meeting he belongs to for the same; and if he or she doth not immediately discontinue such legal proceedings, and condemn such disorderly conduct, to the satisfaction of the meeting, he or she ought to be disowned. E. D. &amp; 1719.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="032162_0013_0FF165D109E2CEB8"/>And whereas there may be some circumstances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> even in dis∣puted matters, wherein the foregoing wholesome method of pro∣ceeding cannot be complied with; such as, 1st, The party ab∣sconding or leaving the country with design to defraud his or her creditors; or, 2d, That the going through the meetings, by the time it must necessarily take up, might be a manifest damage to the creditor or claimant, by other people's postponing him or her, as in cases of apparent danger of bankruptcy, or the party being overloaded with debts, and other creditors generally coming on; or, 3d, That there may be danger of future damage to such as submit thereto, as in the case of executors, administrators, or trustees; it may therefore be necessary, and it is advised, that the monthly-meeting where such cases happen, do hold excused such as shall, in the two first mentioned circumstances in this paragraph, appear to them to be really necessitated to proceed at law; and in the latter case of executors, administrators or trustees, where it shall appear to the meeting that our friendly way would be unsafe, such may be permitted to have the matter tried at law, with this caution, that the parties on both sides do behave towards each other in brotherly love, decency and moderation, without anger or animosity, which will be as a becoming testimony even in courts, and shew that nothing but the nature of the case, and our common station with our neighbours, under the laws of the land, brings any of us there. 1719.</P>
<P>And as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur duty to seek peace with all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caution against suing others, or obliging them to sue us.</NOTE> and avoid giv∣ing provocation or offence to any, it is advised, that Friends be careful not to go to law with others without urgent necessity, nor in a vindictive disposition of mind, nor give them just occasion to sue or implead us; endeavouring, in both cases, to shew a becom∣ing temper of justice and uprightness, by a pacific disposition, to refer our differences with such, to prudent and just arbitrators, where it may safely be done, rather than contend at law.— <Q>Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously, be∣tween every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.</Q> Deut. i. 16. And where it appears that any of our members do, after this advice, persist in a conduct clearly inconsist∣ent with moral justice, and refuse to take the advice of their Friends in concerns with others not in membership with us, such disregard to equity and Christian unity ought to be testified against.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="032162_0014_0FF165D3CF9F3CB0"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Public Friends not to be chosen arbitrators.</NOTE>It is the advice of this meeting, that persons differing about worldly affairs, do, as little as may be, trouble public ministring Friends with being arbitrators in such cases.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arbitrators may take legal counsel.</NOTE>Where arbitrators are at a loss for want of legal knowledge, it may be justifiable, at the expense of the parties, to take the opi∣nion of council learned in the law, in order to their being enabled to come to a just and lawful judgment on the matter submitted to their determination. 1751.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arbitrators not to be advocates;</NOTE>In order that arbitrators may be more truly useful, they should not consider themselves as advocates for the party by whom they were chosen, but men whose incumbent duty it is to judge righte∣ously, fearing the Lord. They should shun all previous informa∣tion respecting the case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">to stand unbias∣sed;</NOTE> or, having heard any, should stand unbi∣assed in their judgments, before they hear both parties together fully,<NOTE PLACE="marg">to hear both parties fully;</NOTE> whilst either hath any fresh matter to offer, until a certain time limited by mutual agreement. Let no evidence or witness be rejected or withheld.<NOTE PLACE="marg">not bound to give the reasons of their award.</NOTE> The arbitrators are not bound to express in their award, or otherwise, their reasons for their decision.

<P>This meeting doth earnestly exhort all parents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advice against reading perni∣cious books.</NOTE> heads of families and guardians of minors, that they prevent, as much as in them lies, their children, and others in their service, and under their care and tuition, from having or reading books and papers tending to prejudice the profession of the Christian religion, to create in them the least doubt concerning the authenticity of the Holy Scrip∣tures, or of those saving truths declared in them; lest their infant and feeble minds should be poisoned thereby, and a foundation laid for the greatest evils.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Play-books, ro∣mances, &amp;c. to be discouraged.</NOTE> And being sorrowfully affected under a con∣sideration of the hurtful tendency of reading plays, romances, novels, and other pernicious books; it is earnestly recommended to every member of our religious society, to discourage and sup∣press the same;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printers not to print, sell, or lend them.</NOTE> and particularly to caution printers and booksellers under our name, against printing, selling, or lending such books; intreating them to avoid a practice, for the sake of gain, so incon∣sistent with the purity of the Christian religion.

<HEAD>BURIALS.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends advised against going with the dead of other socie∣ties into their worship houses.</NOTE>FRIENDS are exhorted to be careful themselves, and to keep their children from going with the dead, at the burials of those not in communion with us, into any of their worship houses; and to avoid as much as may be the hearing any of their sermons, that so Friends may discharge their conscience in the sight of God, and wait for wisdom and counsel from him, and so act, that truth in all things may be honoured by us, and no offence justly given to those not of us. 1711.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Excess at buri∣als cause of deal∣ing.</NOTE>Whereas at some burials, where persons come from far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere may sometimes be occasion of some refreshment, let i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one, where necessary, with such moderation, and the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Friends be with such gravity, as becomes the occasion; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny appear otherwise, let such be dealt with and reproved, as is advised in case of misbehaviour at marriages. And it may further be ob∣served, that any excess on these occasions, and the making such solemn times as these ought to be and are, to appear as festivals, must be burthensome and grievous to the sober Christian mind, which will be under a far different exercise at such times: Friends are therefore desired, with care, to use their best endeavours every where, to avoid and break off that expensive and offensive custom of making provision of strong drink, and the extensive serving of it about, which hath often led to intemperance, and made inter∣ments, which ought to be attended with a becoming solemnity, ap∣pear as noisy festivals, which hath been a grief to many sober-minded amongst us, and is a bad example to others. 1719.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Charity and Love recom∣mended.</NOTE>WE recommend fervent Love and inward Charity one to∣wards another, and to all men, having always in view the good of mankind generally, and zealously endeavouring to promote peace on Earth and good will to men; this will greatly tend to preserve Unity. Where Charity abounds there is Love to God, and Love to man, but where that is wanting, zeal towards God fails, and the Love of other things prevails, tending to cool that cementing Disposition which makes Friends and Neighbours dear to each other. It is for want of Charity, that men speak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Dignities, detract, and lessen the name of their Neighbour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Love and Uni∣ty recommend∣ed.</NOTE>Love and Unity is the true ornament and band of our society, under our heavenly head Christ Jesus, without which Formality will take place of substance, and the life and power of true Religi∣on will be withdrawn. Let every one therefore watch over his own heart, and often examine whether he finds Love to God, and to the brethren really established there on all occasions, but more especially when we meet together for Worship or Discipline; and let not the enemy of our souls by any means rob us of this Badge of Discipleship, or tarnish its beauty. He yet goes about seeking whom he may devour. He knows that our strength is in the Lord, and consists in our being united in Love, and bound together in an humble dependance upon our God, and if he can by any inventi∣on, break those cords, and destroy that Union, Waste and Deso∣lation will come upon us like a Flood. Let us therefore, dear Friends, be ever on our guard, and suspect him as the author of all evil, and of every evil suggestion of our own heart or others; and

let us unite and be strong in the Lord against all our adversaries, and their attempts to divide us, and against the enemies of our own house. Our interest as men, and as christians is one, and every true member must and will endeavour to preserve that inte∣rest entire and unhurt. 1727.</P>

Evils.—A faithful performance of the Obligation which lies upon us to Educate our Children in the way of Truth is well pleasing to God, as may be seen in Abraham, of whom the Lord said <Q>Shall I hide from Abraham the Thing which I do, for I know him, that he will COMMAND his Children, and his Household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do Justice and Judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him,</Q> which indeed was to Bless him, and to make of him a great Nation. But it was not so with old Eli, who had a sort of easy way of reproving his sons, but did not restrain them, when he had power, which brought the wrath of God upon them. I. Samuel II.

<P>Advised,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Children not to be placed out but to Friends.</NOTE> that Friends be careful not to put their Children Ap∣prentice to such who are not Members of our Society, whereby they are often led out of the purity of our plain way into a disre∣gard of our Religious Principles; but as much as in us lies take 'special Care to place them with sober, exemplary Friends, that they may be preserved in the way of Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends to give the preference to Friends Chil∣dren.</NOTE> and in the Love of it.

<PB N="26" REF="032162_0026_0FF165F69DA8C9E8"/>
as an understanding is unfolded in them, with our reasons for this Godly circumspection, that it is a Barrier against the loose, vicious, and immoral part of mankind; reminding them that our worthy Predecessors in the truth suffered much for these things, by which they unshackled themselves from the vain Antic modes, Customs, and Fashions of the Times, which are often Indecent and Immo∣dest, and lead into hurtful company, pernicious diversions and en∣tertainments (and purchased for them, an invaluable privilege) which even many of those who are in the use of these things ac∣knowledge to be inconvenient, expensive, and not consistent with the blessed truth.—Thus our children and young people may in sin∣cerity be induced to walk in the steps of the Righteous who have gone before, and follow them as they followed Christ, who hath prepared a resting place in Joy and Peace for all who thus Testify to a degenerate world, their Love and obedience to him, that so the Lord may have a succession of faithful Servants from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Age and Generation to another.</P>

<P>And it is further advised that all Parents and Masters of Families,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Youth to be kept to Meet∣ings and not permitted to wander about.</NOTE> do use their utmost Endeavours to keep their Youth duly to Meet∣ings, and to prevent the indecent straggling abroad of their chil∣dren and servants, especially on First Days of the Week, and to keep them out of all tumultuous crowds or gatherings of rude peo∣ple.

Our Blessed Saviour, who was the greatest pattern of plainness and self denial, forbad his disciples to receive human honour, or to call Men, Master &amp;c. in way of Cere∣mony; and it is only by his precious Blood and Spirit that we can be redeemed from a vain Conversation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against attend∣ing plays &amp;c.</NOTE> which includes Plays, Sports, Pastimes, an unnecessary resort to Taverns, Places of Public Diversi∣on, and all other gratifications of the senses, which deprave the Mind, and are inconsistent with that Modesty, Gravity, and Seri∣ousness which the Christian Religion dictates, and with those truly rational and noble Pleasures of the soul, set forth in a strong light by the holy Apostle. <Q>The Fruits of the spirit are Love, Joy, Peace, Long suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, and Temperence.</Q> Gal.

<P>IT is concluded that the following order be observed on receiving Persons into Membership—That they apply to the Overseers or Elders, and request to come under the Care of Friends, who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mode of re∣ceiving new Members.</NOTE> when they are easy so to do, are to lay it before the Preparative Meeting; and after that Meeting is fully satisfied, by paying a solid Visit, or otherwise, they are to lay the case before the Monthly Meeting; which Meeting shall appoint some suitable Friends to inquire into the Person's Life and Conversation, and also to take a solid Oppor∣tunity of Conference with the Party, in order the better to under∣stand whether his or her Motives for such Request be sincere, and on the Ground of true Convincement; and make Report of their sense of the Persons suitableness to become a Member, which, if satisfactory to the Meeting, a Minute should then be made, signify∣ing the acceptance of such into Membership, and appointing a Friend or two to acquaint the Person thereof, and request his or her attendance at the next Monthly Meeting—But in all such Cases, Friends are desired carefully to attend to the Advice of the Apostle, "Lay hands suddenly on no Man." The want of which regular and due Care hath often hurt the Particulars, by settling them in a false Rest, and been very injurious to the Reputation of Soci∣ety. N. E. D.</P>
<P>On deliberate consideration it is recommended, in all applicati∣ons of persons to be received into Membership, that Monthly Meetings be deep and weighty in their deliberations and result; and when a Monthly Meeting becomes satisfied, and united in believing that a Person applying to be received as a member of our Society, is convinced of our religious principles, manifesting a good degree of subjection to the Divine principle in his or her heart, and a circumspect Life and conduct, may in their freedom receive such with propriety, without respect to nation or colour. 1796.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Superstitious observation of Days, Months and Times.</NOTE>ADVISED, that Friends keep to their wonted Example and Testimony against the Superstitious observation of Days, and to the simplicity of Truth, and our antient Testimony, in calling the Days and Months by Scripture Names, and not by Hea∣then. E. D. 1691. 1697.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for our Practice.</NOTE>We think it expedient to continue in remembrance, some of the Motives which induced our antient Friends to forbear the Vulgar Appellations of the Months and Days, and to observe in their con∣versation and writings such Names as were agreeable to Scripture, and the Practice of good Men therein recorded.</P>
<P>The Children of Israel, the People whom God chose out of all the Families of the Earth to place his Name among, and to make himself known unto, were strictly commanded, not only to abstain from the Idolatrous Practices of the Nations, in the midst of whom they dwelt, but were enjoined to be <Q>Circumspect in all Things that the Lord commanded," and even to "make no mention of the Names of other Gods, neither to let it be heard out of their Mouth.</Q> Exod. XXIII. 13.—This Injunction was not relative to any Legal or Typical Rites, external Ceremonies, or Institutions of the Law peculiar to the Jewish Nation, but was a perpetual Command and standing Ordinance, respecting the Ho∣nour of the one Almighty Being, the same Yesterday, to Day, and forever, and as such ought to be regarded by us, and by all the Generations of those, who, with the Heart believe, as well as with the Tongue confess, <Q>That the Lord he is God, and that there is none else besides him." Deut. IV. 35. Who hath declared, "I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another, neither my Praise to Graven Images.</Q> Isa. XLII. 8.</P>
<P>Convinced of this great and everlasting Truth, both by the Te∣stimony of the Holy Scriptures, and the manifestation of that di∣vine Principle, which leads those who are faithful to its teachings,
<PB N="40" REF="032162_0041_0FF16621345A5800"/>
from all that would dishonour the Name of God, either in Word or Deed, our antient Friends were conscientiously concerned to refrain from the use of those Names of Months and Days, which had been ascribed by way of Honour to the Idols of the Heathen, and in conformity to their false Worships; this Concern rested up∣on them, from a firm Persuasion, that the Glorious Gospel Day and Time was come, wherein the Lord was fulfilling his Covenant with Israel, viz. <Q>I will take away the Names of Baalim <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word <HI>Baalim,</HI> being the Plural Number of Baal, signifying Lord, has relation to the Names of divers Idols of the Heathen, worshipped in several Places.</NOTE> out of his Mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their Name.</Q> Hos. II. 17.</P>
<P>And that you may the more clearly discern the importance of that Christian Testimony borne by our Predecessors in this Case, we recommend what follows to your serious consideration. viz.</P>
<P>A brief Account of the Origin of the Names of some Months of the Year, and of all the Days of the Week, now customarily and commonly used.</P>
<P N="1">1st. January was so called from Janus, an antient King of Italy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Months.</NOTE> whom heathenish superstition had deified, to whom a Temple was built, and this Month dedicated.</P>
<P N="2">2nd. February was so called from Februa, a word denoting <HI>Pur∣gation</HI> by Sacrifices; it being usual in this Month for the Priests of the Heathen God Pau to offer Sacrifices, and perform certain Rites, conducing as was supposed, to the cleansing or purgation of the People.</P>
<P N="3">3rd. March was so denominated from Mars, feigned to be the God of War, whom Romulus, Founder of the Roman Empire, pretended to be his Father.</P>
<P N="4">4th. April is generally supposed to derive its Name from the Greek appellation of Venus, an imaginary Goddess, worshipped by the Romans.</P>
<P N="5">5th. May is said to have been so called from Maia the Mother of Mercury, another of their pretended ethnic Deities, to whom in this Month they paid their Devotions.</P>
<P N="6">6th. June is said to take its Name from Juno, one of the supposed Goddesses of the Heathen.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="41" REF="032162_0042_0FF16622D1EDB8C0"/>7th. July, so called from Julius Caesar, one of the Roman Empe∣rors, who gave his Name to this Month, which before was called Quintilis or the Fifth.</P>
<P N="8">8th. August, so named in Honour of Augustus Caesar another of the Roman Emperors—This Month was before called Sextilis or the Sixth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Macrob Saturn. Lib. I. Chap. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>The other Four Months, namely, September, October, No∣vember, and December, still retain their numerical Latin Names, which according to the late regulation of the Calender will for the future be improperly applied. However, from the continued use of them hitherto, as well as from the Practice of the Jews before the Babylonish Captivity <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Scriptures to the Time of Ezra.</NOTE> it seemeth highly probable, that the method of distinguishing the Months by their Numerical Order only, was the most antient, as it is the most plain, simple, and rati∣onal.</P>
<P>As the Idolatrous Romans thus gave Names to several of the Months, in honour of their pretended Deities; so the like Idolatry prevailing among our Saxon Ancestors, induced them to call the Days of the Week by the Name of the Idol which on that Day they peculiarly worshiped—hence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Days.</NOTE>The First Day of the Week they called Sunday, from their ac∣customary adoration of the Sun on that Day.</P>
<P>The Second Day of the Week they called Monday, from their usual Custom of Worshipping the Moon on that Day.</P>
<P>The Third Day of the Week they named Tuesday, in honour of one of their Idols called Tuisco.</P>
<P>The Fourth Day of the Week was called Wednesday, from the Appellation of Woden, another of their Idols.</P>
<P>The Fifth Day of the Week was called Thursday, from the Name of an Idol called Thor, to whom they paid their Devoti∣ons on that Day.</P>
<P>The Sixth Day of the Week was termed Friday, from the Name of Friga, an imaginary Goddess, by them worshipped.</P>
<P>The Seventh Day they stiled Saturday, as is supposed from Sa∣turn, or Seater, by them then worshipped.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Verstegan and Sheringham.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="032162_0043_0FF16625A0D65B58" MS="y"/>In the Ages of Popish Superstition, not only the use of such Heathenish Names and Customs were indulged, but also other un∣sound and unscriptural Practices in Religion were invented and introduced. For when the Profession of the Christian Religion became National, Multitudes of Heathenish Priests, whose Interest lay in the performance of Rites, Ceremonies, and Sacrifices, em∣braced prevailing Christianity with selfish Views, and laboured early, with too much success, to find employment for themselves, by imposing on the People a new set of Ceremonies and Sacrifices, bearing some resemblance to those, which in their former state of Heathenism they had been accustomed to: From this corrupt Source sprang the Popish Sacrifice of the Mass, the Celebration of which, at particular Times, and on particular occasions gave rise to the Vulgar Names of Michaelmas, Martinmas, Christmas, and the like.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that these Appellations and Names of Days, Months and Times are of an Idolatrous or Superstitious Original, contrary to the Divine Command, the Practice of good and holy Men in former Ages, and repugnant to the Christian Testimony borne by our faithful Friends and Predecessors in the Truth, for the sake of which they patiently endured many Revilings; let neither the reproach of Singularity, nor the specious Reasonings of such as would evade the Cross of Christ, turn you aside from the sim∣plicity of the Gospel, nor discourage you from keeping to the Lan∣guage of Truth, in denominating the Months and Days according to the plain and Scriptural way of Expression, thereby following the example of our worthy Elders, and coming up in a noble and honourable Testimony against these, and all other remains of Ido∣latry and Superstition. E. D. 1751.</P>
<P>Some Reasons for not observing Fasts and Feast Days and Times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons against Fast and Feast Days &amp; Times &amp;c.</NOTE> and other human Injunctions and Institutions relative to the Worship of God, and against Illuminating our Houses and closing our Shops on occasions of Rejoicing. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ever since we were a People we have had a Testimony against mere Formality, and human Injunctions in Matters of Religion and the Worship of God, and being taught by the Precepts of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Testimonies of his Apostles, and our own
<PB N="43" REF="032162_0044_0FF1662880F81BA0"/>
Experience, that the Worship and Prayers which God will accept, can only be performed by the immediate assistance of the Holy Spirit; we are conscientiously concerned to maintain our Religious Dissent from formal and ceremonious Injunctions; by which set Forms and Times are appointed in Man's Will for Divine Worship; for though the Jews in the first Covenant had many Fasts and Feasts and holy Days, yet even in that Time, when the observation of Fasts and appointed Days was enjoined, the Lord by the Prophet declared, <Q>He was weary to bear their appointed Feasts, that their solemn Meeting was Iniquity.</Q> Isaiah. I. 10 to 15. Because for want of a proper Disposition to seek and serve him; their Hearts re∣mained polluted. <Q>Ye shall not Fast as Ye do this Day to make your Voice to be heard on high, is it such a Fast that I have chosen, a Day for a Man to afflict his Soul? Is it to bow down his head as a Bullrush, and to spread Sackcloth and Ashes under him? Will thou call this a Fast and an acceptable Day to the Lord? Is not this the Fast that I have chosen, to loose the Bands of Wickedness, to undo the heavy Burthens, and to let the op∣pressed go free, and that ye break every Yoke? Is it not to deal thy Bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the Poor that are cast out, to thine House; when thou seest the Naked that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thyself from thine own Flesh; then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer, thou shalt cry, and he shall say here I am.</Q> Isa. LVIII. 4 to 9. From which it appears, that even when Public Fasts were observed by Divine appointment, yet the Lord declared his disapprobation of them, when the Observers thereof did not manifest their sincerity by suitable Fruits of Repentance and amendment of Life. But we dare not comply with Injunctions of that kind, as the Dispen∣sation in which those outward Observations were enjoined, has long since Ceased. Christ, our Holy Head and High Priest, who is the substance of that which was pointed to, and hoped for, en∣joins his Followers the observance of a Daily, universal Fast; a Fast from every thing which has not a tendency to purify and per∣fect the Soul, and render it more and more fit to become the Ta∣bernacle of the Holy Ghost. He positively requires of his Disci∣ples and Followers, <Q>That they deny themselves, take up their Cross and follow him" Matt. XVI. 24. And "that they Watch and Pray always, that they may be accounted worthy to

stand before him.</Q> Luke. XXI. 36. That in the Primitive Churches they saw an end of these Shadows of things to come, and were brought to him, the substance, in whom all Figures and Sha∣dows do end, is manifested by the repeated expressions of the Apo∣stle Paul. <Q>For Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believeth" Rom. X. 4.—"But now hath he obtained a more excellent Ministry, by how much also he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was established upon better Promises." Heb. VIII. 6. But now after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the Weak and Beggarly Elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage. Ye observe Days, and Months, and Times, and Years; I am afraid of You, lest I have bestowed upon You labour in vain." Gall. IV. 9 to 11. "One Man esteemeth one Day above another, another esteemeth every Day alike: He that regardeth the Day regardeth it unto the Lord, and he that regardeth not the Day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. Let us not therefore Judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a Stumbling Block or an occasion to fall, in his Brothers way." Rom. XIV. 5, 6, &amp; 13. "Let no Man therefore Judge you in Meat or Drink, or in respect of an holy Day, or of the New Moon, or of the Sabbath Days, which are a shadow of things to come, but the Body is of Christ.</Q> Coll. II. 16.17. And we apprehend that the Testimony and Practice of our Forefathers is truly consistent therewith, as will appear on a perusal of their Writings, and particularly those of our worthy Friends Wm.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutual duty of Parents and Children here∣in.</NOTE>ADVISED, that Parents and Guardians of Children, in the fear of God, take special care to prevent those under their charge from being engaged or entangled with any upon the account of Marriage, before all things relating to their outward Estates be firmly agreed on both parts; that so no breach may be made up∣on the account of outwards things, to the hurt or prejudice of young People. E. D.</P>
<P>And we do also, advise and exhort all young and unmarried People among Friends, that they do not make any motion or pro∣cedure one with another upon the account of Marriage, without first acquainting their Parents or Guardians therewith, and duly waiting upon them for their consent and agreement therein. And we also advise, that, in the first place, all concerned seriously wait upon the Lord for counsel and clearness in this weighty concern, before they make any motion or procedure with any in order to Marriage; so as they may not be led by any forward, brittle, or uncertain affections, in this great concern, to their own hurt, grief of their Friends, and dishonour of truth; and let it be the godly concern of both Monthly and Quarterly Meetings to be care∣ful and mindful of the preservation and good of children in this matter, as here proposed and signified; and not to omit giving due and faithful warnings and admonitions in this great and weighty concern.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Certificates to join in Marri∣age.</NOTE>Agreed that all single Persons, who profess the Truth, being about to marry at a distance from home, do take care to procure Certificates from the Monthly Meeting they belong to, of their right of Membership, and clearness from any other Person in re∣spect to Marriage; and also that they obtain the mind of their Parents or Guardians therein;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriages not to be permitted without consent of Parents &amp;c.</NOTE> and that none be permitted to join themselves in Marriage until such Certificates, and the consent of their Parents or Guardians thereto, be also signified in Person, or by writing, where it is practicable, or may be reasonably obtained. 1682.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="032162_0065_0FF1666464EAE5B0"/>It is agreed, after well weighing the same, that Father and Son ought to be discouraged from Marrying two Sisters. 1685.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Father and Son not to Marry Sisters.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is declared to be the sense of this Meeting, that if any Wi∣dower or Widow, professing Truth, shall make or accept an offer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offers of Mar∣riage not to be made in less than 9 or 10 Months after former Hus∣band or Wise's Death.</NOTE> application, or procedure in order to Marriage, before nine or ten Months be expired, after the Death of Wife or Husband, of such Person or Persons so proceeding, such offer, acceptance, or procedure is over hasty and indecent; and the respective Quarterly Meetings are desired to give Cautions against such proceedings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor accom∣plished in less than twelve months.</NOTE> And no Monthly Meeting ought to permit any Marriages to be proposed in the said Meeting sooner than a Year after the death of Husband or Wife. 1749.</P>

<P>After serious consideration concerning Marriages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriages not to be delayed on account of any former misde∣meanor.</NOTE> this Meeting being ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in that respect, advises, that no misdemeanor be trea∣sure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or remain against any Person until the time of present∣ing Marriage and then started, though perhaps long before done, and known to those who so object to it at that time, which is a wrong thing; and such doings should be checked and discouraged in all Meetings. 1712.</P>
<P>Agreed, that it be recommended to Monthly Meetings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parties making suit for Marri∣age, not to live in the same House.</NOTE> that according to the ancient decent practice amongst Friends, they take care that such men and women Friends who make suit or pro∣posals of Marriage one to the other, do not dwell in the same House, from the Time that they begin to be so concerned, until the Marriage is accomplished. 1714.</P>

<P>Let such be dealt with as keep company in order for Marriage with those not in membership with us, or with any bound Servant, without the leave of her master or mistress. And for being pre∣sent, or suffering their Children at Marriages of members either

by the official interference of Priests, or in any other way out of our comely order; or the marriages of those not in membership, which are accomplished by the assistance of a Priest. 1719.</P>
<P>It is the advice and Judgment of this meeting, that where Pa∣rents or Guardians have approved the Visits or addresses of a man to their children or those under their care, that they do not retract the same, without giving such Reasons as shall appear well ground∣ed and sufficient for so doing, to the satisfaction of the Monthly Meeting whereto they belong.</P>
<P>That all according to our usual custom, do offer or propose their Marriage to two Monthly Meetings, and that the second time be to the next successive Meeting, unless sickness or other material cause prevent. At the first Meeting, if no reason appear to the contrary, the appearance should be minuted, and inquiry made concerning consent of Parents and Guardians, if either have any, and if the Man belongs to the same Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquiry to be made.</NOTE> two Friends are to be then appointed to inquire into his clearness for proceeding in such Marriage; and if there is issue by a former Husband; to see that the childrens rights are legally secured, and make report to the next Meeting. And the proper care is previously to be taken by the Women Friends concerning the Woman. And if either of the Parties be from another Country, or belong to another Monthly Meeting, let inquiry be then made for a Certificate from such Meeting, and where none is produced let the Party be informed that the Marriage cannot pass, or be allowed without one, which should certify their clearness from all others in respect of Marriage. But if the Meeting which the Friend belongs to lies within such distance as that it may probably be obtained so as to be produced at the next Meeting, and there appears no objection, nor any thing else to obstruct, it may then pass for the first time. At the second Meeting, if what is above expressed be done, and all ap∣pear clear, let an entry be made of their second appearance, and what more is usual and necessary, and the Couple left at their liber∣ty to accomplish their Marriage according to the good order used among Friends.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriages to be accomplished gravely.</NOTE>It is further advised, that the said Marriage be accomplished de∣cently, gravely, and weightily; and that the parties themselves, their Parents, and others concerned, do take care at the Houses or Places where they go after the Meeting is over, that no reproach

after deliberate consideration it is concluded that a sincere acknow∣ledgment from such may be received by the Monthly Meeting; but lest the acceptance of acknowledgments to reinstate such Per∣sons, should tend to encourage Marriages of that kind, Monthly Meetings are enjoined to take the advice and assistance of their Quarterly Meetings, before they accept of such offerings, being well assured that the Parties are brought to a due sense of their Transgressions, manifested by uprightness of Life and Conversation, in order that they may be rightly restored with the concurrence of the Quarterly Meeting. 1725. 1779.</P>
<P>This Meeting, after due consideration thereon, is of opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Cousins by Affinity, or any nearer of Kin, not to Marry.</NOTE> that no Marriages ought to be allowed amongst us, between any Man and his Wife's first Cousin; and so of other Relations equally near, or nearer of kin. 1734. 1755.</P>
<P>The Meeting being informed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriages be∣tween first Cou∣sins to be testi∣fied against.</NOTE> that notwithstanding the sense of Friends declared against Marriages between first Cousins, it has been practiced by some who pretend to be of us; this Meeting therefore declares it as their sense, that where any Marriages of this kind shall happen for the future, that Monthly Meetings on notice th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eof, do forthwith publish their Testimony against them. 1739.</P>
<P>An application for the sense of this Meeting from one of the Quarters, whether a man may be restored into Fellowship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage with Wife's half Sis∣ter, the Parties disowned can∣not be restored to Membership.</NOTE> who has been Disowned for Marrying his Wife's half Sister, being solidly and deliberately considered, it is resulted, that as Marrying within that degree of kindred is forbidden by the Laws of the Government, and is contrary to our Christian Testimony, it will not be for the reputation of Truth to receive such into Member∣ship with us as a religious Society, while they live in the breach thereof. 1760.</P>
<P>The Increase of the breaches of our Testimony in going from amongst us in the weighty engagement of Marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Early care of the Youth.</NOTE> being often for want of due care in Parents, and those who have the impor∣tant charge of educating the Youth under their Trust, early to admonish and instruct them in the Principles of Truth, and of im∣pressing their minds with the duty of religiously observing them; as much as possible restraining them from such Company as will be likely to entangle their affections in an improper manner; where∣fore we tenderly advise to an increasing care amongst Friends in

all Quarters towards the Youth, that the consistency of our Prin∣ciples in all respects with the nature of true Religion, may be en∣forced on their tender minds, by upright examples as well as by Precepts; and that where there is apparent danger of the affections of any being improperly entangled, and the care of Parents and Guardians and those who have their oversight appears not sufficient to prevent their taking imprudent steps in the accomplishing of their Marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where Testi∣monies or ac∣knowledgments for Marrying out should be published.</NOTE> care be taken, timely to apply for the help of their Friends. And on mature consideration we are of opinion, that such who run counter to the good advice of their Parents, or Guardians, and Friends, thus communicated to them, and accom∣plish their Marriage in a clandestine manner, more especially when they contribute to the support of an hireling Ministry, do bring Scandal on Society by their undutiful, perverse conduct, and that Monthly Meetings when such aggravated Circumstances occur, ought to set forth the same in their Disownment, and may be jus∣tified in Publishing their Testimony against them, as well as the Papers of acknowledgment taken from such. 1761.</P>

<P>The following proposal was laid before the Yearly Meeting (to wit) <Q>We of the Committee appointed to correspond with Friends in England, and to visit the Monthly Meetings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting for Sufferings esta∣blished.</NOTE> having had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nference with the Committee appointed to adjust the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tings accounts; and taking into consideration the dis∣tressed stat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Frontier Settlements of these Provinces, and that we have just grounds to apprehend that many of our Friends, who are now situate in parts immediately exposed to danger, may so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> stand in need of relief and assistance, and for want of a timely care and Provision being made, may, in the approach∣ing Winter suffer deeply; are unanimously of opinion that it will be expedient to raise such a sum of money for the stock of the Yearly Meeting as may enable those with whom the distribution of it may be entrusted, to do more considerable service than the sums usually raised would answer, and therefore conclude, that less than One Thousand Pounds may not be sufficient. And in order that due care may be taken to distribute or employ the Money to general satisfaction; we propose, that the Treasurers of this Meeting should observe the directions of a Committee to be appointed by this Meeting. And that such a Committee may be constituted in the most equal manner, and the several Quar∣terly Meetings be properly represented, we propose that this Meeting should nominate twelve Friends, living in or near Phi∣ladelphia for the convenience of their getting soon together; and that it be recommended to the several Quarterly Meetings to appoint four Friends to represent each Quarter; and that the

<P>After a deliberate and weighty Consideration of which, a spirit of sympathy and brotherly concern appearing, and many useful and necessary observations and, exhortations to excite Friends to a religious attention to the present humbling Dispensations of Divine Providence; the Meeting very unanimously agrees, that the Sum of One Thousand Pounds be raised in the usual manner as soon as may be; and the Meeting confirms the Proposal of appointing a Committeè,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes to be kept.</NOTE> and the limitation of their Trust, with this addition, that the said Committee should keep fair Minutes of all their Pro∣ceedings, and produce the same to the next Yearly Meeting; and the Representatives of the several Quarterly Meetings are desired to meet together and nominate twelve Friends to be returned To∣morrow for the approbation of this Meeting.

And let those who frequent∣ly neglect, or do not in time attend our Meetings, or go out and in unnecessarily, or otherwise disturb the Meeting, be rebuked and cautioned.

<P>It appearing, by the Reports brought up to this Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attendance of week day Meet∣ings.</NOTE> that there is a neglect and deviation in some, from that ancient and honourable practice of Meeting together on Week Days for the worship of him that lives forever, it would be a matter of comfort that there might be a general amendment in this respect: Those who have been preserved in faithfulness therein, having livingly to testify from that experience which cannot deceive, that it hath been very profitable, and knowing the benefit of such a Practice, their regard for those Providentially placed under their Care so prevails, that they cannot be easy without encouraging and putting forward their Children, Apprentices and Servants to this religious Duty, as well as other behaviour suitable thereunto. And if this useful Practice was more generally attended to, it would do more for us and them than any outward acquisition of Wealth; and without doubt, some such may with thankfulness have to view our pio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Care in taking them from Worldly Business to seek a City eternal in the Heavens. 1760.</P>
<P>This Meeting again recommends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wilful neglect of Meetings cause of Dis∣ownment.</NOTE> that Friends who are exercis∣ed in the Discipline, would early extend their Brotherly love and care, in visiting such amongst us who are neglectful of their Duty in attending our Meetings for Public Worship.

<P>It is observed that the God and Fountain of all our mercies has opened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ministers and Elders to advise young Ministers in tenderness.</NOTE> and is opening in divers of our Young People, a Spring of living ministry; therefore our earnest desire is, that both Ministers and Elders may be as nursing Fathers and Mothers to those that are young in the ministry, and with all care and diligence advise and admonish them, and if they see occasion reprove them in a tender and Christian Spirit, observing the Rules of our Discipline and counsel of Friends in that respect; also exhort them frequently to read the holy Scriptures, and earnestly seek the mind of the Spirit of Truth, to open the mysteries thereof, and as they keep in true Patience and submission to the will of God, stand faithful, and abide in the simplicity of the Gospel, being ex∣ercised in their proper Gifts, keeping down to the openings of Divine Love and Life in themselves, they will witness a gradual growth, and be content to wait for it in the will of God, and not strive to extend their Declaration's further than they find the Life and Power of Truth to bear them up.</P>
<P>And our advice is to all our Ministers, that they be frequent in reading the Scriptures of the old and new Testament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ministers for what to be dealt with.</NOTE> and if any in the course of their ministry, shall misapply, or draw unsound inferences or wrong conclusions from the Text, or otherwise mis∣behave themselves in point of Conduct or Conversation, let them be admonished in Love and Tenderness by the Elders or Overseers where they live, and if they refuse to acknowledge and give satis∣faction for their offences, let them be further dealt with, in the wisdom of Truth, as the case may require. 1723.</P>
<P>We tenderly recommend to faithful Friends, and especially Mi∣nisters and Elders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ministers and Elders to watch over the Flock, and be good ex∣amples.</NOTE> to watch over the Flock of Christ in their re∣spective Places and Stations, always approving themselves by their

<P>Many just and pertinent Remarks being made in this Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends to be ca∣utioned against importing or re∣tailing Distilled Spirits.</NOTE> clearly letting forth the corrupting, debasing, and ruinous effects consequent on the importation and retailing large quantities of dis∣tilled Spirits, whereby the intemperate use of them is greatly aided and encouraged, to the impoverishment of many, distempering the Constitutions and Understandings of many more, and increasing Vice and Dissoluteness in the Land, wherewith many religiously attentive minds have been long painfully burthened; it is the unit∣ed sense of the Meeting, that well concerned Friends in all Quar∣ters, be earnestly excited to suffer the affecting importance of this mighty evil, religiously to impress their minds, and animate them with a lively concern to exert honest endeavours, both by Example and loving entreaty, to caution and dissuade all our Members from being concerned in the importation or retailing distilled Spirits, or giving Countenance thereto. 1784. 1787.</P>
<P>A fervent concern attending this Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends who import retail or distill spirituous Liquors to be treated with.</NOTE> respecting the melan∣choly fruits of a too unguarded love of Lucre in promoting the in∣temperate use of Spirituous Liquors, by importing, distilling, and retailing them; a sense of the mighty and extensive mischiefs pro∣duced thereby, being expressed with much weight and energy; the importance of which evil, and promoting a Remedy therefor, requiring deliberate care as well as deep and faithful attention; and it appearing there is an increasing concern harmoniously pre∣vailing against the practice of trading in, and making use of an ar∣ticle, which is attended with obvious pernicious effects on the mo∣rals and Health of the People in general; it is recommended in the most tender earnest manner to our Quarterly and Monthly Meetings, to manifest a true disinterested regard and attention to the judgment and pressing exhortation of the collective body of Friends, as ex∣pressed in the Minute of this Meeting in 1777, and the subsequent

advices to this time, as well as the renewed exercise which has attended the minds of Friends now assembled, for the preservation of our fellow Members from the temptation of partaking in the Gain of unrighteousness. And for the effecting this desirable pur∣pose, we think it expedient, that Quarterly and Monthly Meet∣ings be excited and enjoined early to appoint Committees unitedly to proceed in visiting and treating with our Members individually who are concerned in importing distilled spirituous Liquors, either on their own account, or as Agents for others; and those who pur∣chase and retail them; as also those Members who are concerned in the Distillation of those Liquors from Grain or other Produce, either in their own Families, or encouraging or promoting it in others.</P>

<HEAD>NEGROES OR SLAVES.</HEAD>
<P>IT appearing to have been the concern of this Meeting from time to time revived with increasing weight, to testify their uneasi∣ness and disunity with the importation and purchasing of Negroes and other Slaves, and to direct the Overseers of the several Meet∣ings to advise and deal with such as engage therein; and it hath likewise been the continued care of many weighty Friends, to press those that bear our name to guard as much as possible against be∣ing in any respect concerned in promoting the bondage of such un∣happy people; yet as we have with sorrow to observe that their number is of late increased amongst us, we have thought proper to make our advice and judgment more public, that none may plead Ignorance of our Principles therein, and also again earnestly exhort all, to avoid in any manner encouraging that practice, of making Slaves of our fellow creatures.—For if we continually bear in mind the Royal Law of doing to others as we would be done by, we shall never bereave our fellow Creatures of that valuable Bles∣sing, Liberty, nor endure to grow Rich by their bondage; to live in ease and plenty by the toil of those whom violence and cruelty have put in our power, is neither consistent with Christianity or common justice, and we have good reason to believe draws down the displeasure of Heaven; it being a melancholy but true reflec∣tion, that where Slave keeping prevails, pure Religion and Sobrie∣ty decline, as it evidently tends to harden the heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Evil effects of Slave keeping.</NOTE> and render the Soul less susceptible of that holy spirit of Love, Meekness and Charity which form the peculiar characteristic of a true Christian. How then can we who have been concerned to publish the Gospel of universal Love and Peace amongst mankind, be so inconsistent with ourselves, as to purchase such who are Prisoners of War, and thereby encourage this antichristian practice; and more espe∣cially as many of those poor Creatures are stolen away, Parents from Children, and Children from Parents; and others who were in good circumstances in their native Country, inhumanly torn from
<PB N="92" REF="032162_0092_0FF166B1871504D0"/>
what they esteemed a happy situation, and compelled to toil in a state of slavery, too often extremely cruel.—What dreadful scenes of Murder and cruelty those barbarous Ravages must occasion in the country of those unhappy People, are too obvious, Remember our blessed Saviour's positive command to do unto others as we would have them do unto us; and that with what measure we mete it should be measured to us again. And we entreat all to ex∣amine whether the purchasing of a Negro, either born here or im∣ported, doth not contribute to a further importation, and conse∣quently to the upholding all the evils above mentioned, and to the promotion of Man stealing, the only theft, which by the Mosaic Law was punished with death. <Q>He that stealeth a Man and sel∣leth him, or if he be found in his hands, he shall surely be put to death.</Q> Exod. XXI. 16.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Badge of a true Christian.</NOTE>The distinguishing Mark and Badge of a true Christian is Love and good works; our Saviour's whole Life on Earth was one conti∣nued exercise of them— "Love one another as I have loved you." How can we be said to love our Brethren, who bring, or for self∣ish ends keep them in Bondage?—Do we act consistent with this noble principle, who lay such heavy Burthens on our fellow Crea∣tures? Do we consider that they are called, and sincerely desire that they may become Heirs with us in Glory? and rejoice in the liberty of the Sons of God, whilst we are withholding from them the common Liberties of Mankind? or can the Spirit of God by which we have always professed to be led, be the author of those oppressive and unrighteous Measures? Or do we not thereby mani∣fest that temporal Interest hath more influence on our conduct herein than the dictates of that merciful, holy, and unerring Guide?</P>
<P>And we likewise earnestly recommend to all who have slaves, to be careful to come up in the performance of their duty towards them, and to be particularly watchful over their own Hearts, it being by sorrowful experience remarkable, that custom, and a fa∣miliarity with evil of any kind, hath a tendency to bias the judg∣ment and deprave the mind; and it is obvious, that the future wel∣fare of those poor Slaves who are now in bondage, is generally too much disregarded by those who keep them; if their daily task of labour is but fulfilled, little else perhaps is thought of; Yea, even that which in others would be looked upon with horror and Detes∣tation
<PB N="93" REF="032162_0093_0FF166B447EEEA10"/>
is little regarded in them by their Masters, such as the fre∣quent separation of Husbands from Wives, and Wives from Hus∣bands, whereby they are tempted to break their Marriage Cove∣nants, and live in Adultery, in direct opposition to the Laws both of God and Man, although we believe that Christ died for all Men without respect of Persons; how fearful then ought we to be of engaging in what hath so material a tendency to lessen our Huma∣nity, and of suffering ourselves to be inured to the exercise of hard and cruel measures, lest we thereby in any degree lose our tender and feeling sense of the miseries of our fellow Creatures, and be∣come worse than those who have not believed.</P>
<P>And Dear Friends, you who by Inheritance have Slaves born in your Families, we beseech you to consider them as Souls committed to your trust, whom the Lord will require at your hands, and who, as well as you, are made partakers of the Spirit of Grace, and called to be Heirs of Salvation; and let it be your constant care to watch over them for good, instructing them in the fear of God, and the knowledge of the Gospel of Christ, that they may answer the end of their Creation, and God be glorified and honoured by them, as well as by us; and so train them up, that if you should come to behold their unhappy situation in the same light that many worthy men, who are at rest, have done, and many of your Bre∣thren now do, and should think it your duty to set them free, they may be the more capable to make a proper use of their liberty.</P>
<P>Finally Brethren, we intreat you in the Bowels of Gospel Love, seriously to weigh the cause of detaining them in Bondage; if it be for your own private gain, it is much to be feared that the love of God, and the influence of the holy spirit is not the prevailing Principle in you, and that your Hearts are not sufficiently redeemed from the World, which that you with ourselves may more and more come to Witness, through the cleansing virtue of the holy spi∣rit of Jesus Christ, is our earnest desire. 1754.</P>
<P>The inconsistency of the Practice of being concerned in import∣ing or buying Slaves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concern against importing or buying Slaves, made Rule of Discipline.</NOTE> with our Christian Principles being consider∣ed: It is the sense and judgment of this Meeting, if any trans∣gress, Overseers ought speedily to inform the Monthly Meeting of such Transgressors, in order that the Meeting may proceed to treat further with them, as they may be directed in the Wisdom of Truth. 1755.</P>

<P><PB N="95" REF="032162_0095_0FF166B78E7821D0"/>It is the present sense and judgment of this Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends who import, sell, pur∣chase or give away slaves to be disowned pu∣blicly.</NOTE> that such of our Members who are concerned in importing, selling, or pur∣chasing; or that shall give away or transfer any Negro or other Slave, with or without any other Consideration than to clear their Estate of any future incumbrance, or in such manner that their Bondage is continued beyond the time limited by Law or Custom for white Persons; and those who accept of such gift or assignment, ought to be speedily treated with in the Spirit of true Love and Wisdom, and the iniquity of their Conduct laid before them. And if, af∣ter all this Christian labour, they cannot be brought to such a sense of their injustice, as to do every thing which the Monthly Meet∣ing shall judge to be reasonable and necessary for the restoring such Slave to his or her natural and just right to Liberty, and condemn their deviation from the Law of Righteousness and Equity, to the satisfaction of the said Meeting, that such Member be testified against as other Transgressors are by the Rules of our Discipline for other immoral, unjust, or reproachful conduct.</P>
<P>And understanding that some Members of our religious Society through inattention, and others from different motives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficult cases how to be ma∣naged.</NOTE> have been induced to be concerned in hiring Slaves on Wages, such should be excited to consider, that this Practice manifestly contributes to pro∣mote the unrighteous Traffic we are desirous to suppress; and therefore, they should be advised and admonished against being thus accessary to promoting it. Also that Friends be cautioned and advised against acting as Executors or Administrators to such Estates where Slaves are bequeathed or likely to be detained in Bondage.</P>
<P>And we are of the Mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Friends here∣tofore in part disowned for this practice, to be further treat∣ed with &amp; diss∣owned for other Breaches of dis∣cipline.</P><P>Slave holders to be treated with and dis∣owned.</P></NOTE> that where any Member has been heretofore so far excluded from religious fellowship as the Minute of 1758 gives Authority, nevertheless, in case of other disorderly conduct, that they be treated with agreeable to our Discipline. 1774.</P>
<P>Under the calming influences of pure Love, we do with great unanimity give it as our sense and judgment, that Quarterly and Monthly Meetings should speedily unite in a further close Labour with all such as are Slave holders, and have any right of Member∣ship with us; and where any continue to reject the advice of their Brethren, and refuse to execute proper Instruments of Writing, for releasing from a state of Slavery such as are in their power, or to whom they have any claim, whether arrived to full age, or

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaves set free and their Chil∣dren to be ad∣vised and in∣structed.</NOTE>It is recommended to Friends in their several Quarterly and Monthly Meetings, seriously and attentively to consider the cir∣cumstances of such Negroes and their Children who have been re∣stored to freedom, and the obligation we are under to discharge our religious duty to them, which being disinterestedly pursued, will lead the Professors of Truth to advise and assist them on all occasions, particularly in promoting their Instruction in the Principles of the Christian Religion, and the pious Education of their Children, as also to advise them in respect to their engagements in Worldly concerns as occasions offer. And it is desired that Friends of judg∣ment and experience may be nominated for this weighty service; it being the solid sense of this Meeting, that we of the present ge∣neration are under strong obligations to manifest our concern and care for the Offspring of those People, who by their labour have greatly contributed toward the cultivation of several of these Co∣lonies, under the afflicting disadvantage of enduring a hard Bon∣dage, and many amongst us are enjoying the benefit of their Toil.</P>

Mind to reject or oppose the judgment and concern of the Yearly Meeting heretofore given, that Monthly Meetings, after due la∣bour and Christian endeavours have been used to convince them of their Error, without effect, should proceed to declare that they are not in fellowship with us. And it is further desired, that Friends in the course of their labour with such who continue to hold Slaves in Bondage, may be well assured of the disposition of Mind of the Mistresses of Families, that they unite with us in our Concern and Testimony against the iniquitous Practice; and where a contrary disposition appears, and is persisted in, our Discipline should be exercised against them. 1778.</P>
<P>We are united in judgment that the state of the oppressed Peo∣ple who have been held by any of us or our Predecessors in Capti∣vity and Slavery, calls for a deep inquiry and close examination,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slaves set free to have their just rights at∣tended to by those concerned.</NOTE> how far we are clear of withholding from them, what under such an exercise may open to view as their just right; and therefore we earnestly and affectionately entreat our Brethren in religious Pro∣fession to bring this matter home, and that all who have let the oppressed go free may attend to the further openings of Duty.</P>
<P>A tender Christian sympathy appears to be awakened in the minds of many who are not in religious Profession with us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This concern to be spread among those who are not in unity with us.</NOTE> who have se∣riously considered the oppressions and disadvantages under which these People have long laboured, and whether a pious care to be extended to these, and to their Offspring is not justly due from us to them, is a consideration worthy of our serious and deep atten∣tion, or if this obligation did not weightily lay upon us, can be∣nevolent Minds be directed to any object more worthy of their li∣berality and encouragement than that of laying a foundation in the rising Generation for their becoming good and useful Men?

And that they avoid the immoderate or vain use of Lawful things, which though innocent in themselves, may thereby become hurtful; avoid also such kinds of stuffs, colours and dress, as are calculated more to please a vain and wanton, or proud mind, than for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> real usefulness; and let Tradesmen and others, Members of our religious Society be admonished accordingly, that they may not make themselves accessary to these evils; for we ought in all things to take up the daily Cross of Christ; minding the Grace of God which brings Salvation, and teaches to deny all ungodliness, and worldly Lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present World, that we may adorn the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, so shall we feel his Blessing, and may be instrumental in his hand, for the good of others. 1682. 1694. 1695. 1711.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Watchfulness against vain cus∣toms and Fashi∣ons.</NOTE>It comes before this Meeting, to press all Friends to diligence, and watchfulness, against the vain customs and growing Fashions, which have been so nobly denied and avoided by our Elders and Forefathers, who stood their ground in a faithful Testimony against those things, which now too much appear in some places, especi∣ally among our Youth, that our Discipline may be observed, and duly put in practice, in this, as well as more weighty Points. 1715.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Self denial and true circum∣spection recom∣mended.</NOTE>As we have been redeemed from the confused Doctrines of the Schools, and the unwarrantable power of Men in their unscriptu∣ral impositions of Articles, Modes, and Ceremonies, and turned to an inward work in the simplicity of the Gospel of Jesus our Lord; so, from the beginning, it hath fallen closely on our elder Bre∣thren to bear Testimony against all Vanity and Pride; all super∣fluity and excess: being rightly made to see, in the first place, the great necessity of sincerity and uprightness of Heart towards God,
<PB N="103" REF="032162_0103_0FF166CD82631D50"/>
and obedience to his Commands; and next how inconsistent it is with this inward work, to retain or launch into the vain Customs and Fashions prevailing amongst the Professors of Christianity; for how is it possible for a mind truly religious to be delighted in such follies. Let our Youth and others, who may make light of that plainness of Speech, Apparel, and Furniture, which our elder Brethren have been led into, but seriously examine their own Hearts, with due application and regard to the Grace of God placed there, and they will find, that so far as they embrace such Vanities, they weaken themselves in the true practice of religious Duties, and invite further Temptations, and more dangerous Vices.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypocrites be∣ing plain no reason to dis∣courage plain∣ness in sincere Friends.</NOTE> Neither can it be a satisfactory excuse, if they should observe any one who may conceive the appearance of plainness to be some temporal advantage to them, do put it on with unsanctified Hearts, and Minds filled with deceit, for such as these are an abomination to God and good Men, and ought no more to deter the sincere heart∣ed from an exemplary behaviour and conduct, than it should a just Man from speaking Truth, because some Persons when they co∣vertly can, will be guilty of Falsehood. From these considerati∣ons, and in true love to the Youth and others, a solid concern came upon Friends at this time, to encourage all to a Christian Life of self denial, with all comeliness of conversation and simplicity of Manners; observing that in some there appears too much careless∣ness and neglect of this beautiful circumspection, and in others too much highmindedness, whereby they err from the narrow Path which leads to true Peace and Happiness;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Former Epistles or Minutes to be read in Youth's or o∣ther Meetings.</NOTE> it is therefore the ad∣vice of this Meeting, that Friends in their respective Quarterly and Monthly Meetings, as they find occasion, do cause former Epistles or Minutes, or such parts of them as regard any growing or rising Evil, to be read in our Youth's or other Meetings, as may be thought best. 1726.</P>
<P>We tenderly exhort all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plainness and simplicity of the Gospel our fore∣fathers suffered for it.</NOTE> seriously to consider the plainness and simplicity which the Gospel enjoins and to manifest it in their Speech, Apparel, Furniture and appearance in all things; in their Saluta∣tions and Conversation, into which our Forefathers were led by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, his Precepts and example; and for which they patiently suffered long imprisonments, and great persecutions; being convinced that it was their duty thus to bear a Testimony against the vain Spirit of the World. 1746.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="032162_0104_0FF166CF22E82C28"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">A watchful care recommen∣ded. Our Sa∣viours example still leads to it.</NOTE>Whereas we have with deep concern observed that there is a great declension from that simplicity in Speech, Behaviour, and Apparel, which our worthy Ancestors were led into; and as we find by experience, that the same spirit of Truth which led our Antients to lay aside every thing unbecoming the Followers of Christ, will still lead in the same Path, all who submit to its guidance, we earnestly entreat all Friends to watch over themselves in these re∣spects—The example of our blessed Saviour and his Followers, and of virtuous and holy Men in all ages, ought to make a due impres∣sion on every considerate Mind; and especially on such as have had the advantage of an Education in a Plainness agreeable to such Example.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Misconduct of plain Persons, no objection to plainness.</NOTE>Let not any such as degenerate in these respects excuse their own weakness, under a pretence of the misconduct of some who have appeared outwardly Plain; an objection of very little weight; for did they rightly consider, they would clearly see, that the very reason why Deceivers sometimes put on plain Apparel, is because true Men have been accustomed to wear it—We also tenderly ad∣vise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An exemplary Plainness with∣out respect of Persons.</NOTE> that Friends take heed, especially those who should be ex∣emplary to others under their care, that they exercise plainness of Speech without respect of Persons, in all their converse among Men; and not balk their Testimony by a cowardly compliance, varying their Language according to their Company; a practice of very ill example to our observing Youth, and rendering those who use it contemptible, and looked upon as a kind of Hypocrites, even by those with whom they so comply: such a mean spirited Practice seems to be cautioned against by the Apostle, when he advises. I. Tim. "That the Deacons be Grave, not double Tongued;" a caution plainly importing that it is inconsistent with the gravity of the Gospel. E. D. 1743.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Evil effects of a departure from Plainness.</NOTE>It is matter of exceeding Grief and Concern to many of the faithful among us, to observe, how far that exemplary plainness of habit, speech, and deportment, which distinguished our Fore∣fathers, and for which they patiently underwent the reproach and contradiction of Sinners, is now departed from by many under our name: a declension, from the simplicity of Truth herein hath been, and we fear is, attended with pernicious Consequences, in opening the way of some, the more easily and unobserved to attend the places of public resort, for the exercise of Sports, Plays, and
<PB N="105" REF="032162_0105_0FF166D0CE1587A0"/>
other hurtful and destructive Diversions of the Age, from which Truth taught our faithful Elders, and still teaches us wholly to re∣frain; and indeed the Christian Gravity of their lives and actions, always carried with it a severe reproof, and manifest opposition to the wantonness and Levity of such dangerous and sinful Pastimes. Wherefore, we beseech you, be not deceived, nor led aside by false notions of imaginary Pleasures, <Q>to partake of the unfruitful works of darkness," but "watch and be sober;" and as becom∣eth Children of the light, and of the Day, "abstain from all ap∣pearance of evil.</Q> I.

<HEAD>Some Observations relating to the Establishment of Schools.</HEAD>
<P>It is the opinion of the Committee, that Friends having united with others, in employing such Persons for Masters, who have not submitted to the operation of Truth, hath had a tendency to strengthen a disposition in our Youth to avoid the Cross, and unite with the spirit of the World; whereby many hurtful and corrupt things have gained ground amongst us.</P>
<P>On reviewing the Minutes of the Yearly Meeting, we find, that at several Meetings, particularly at and since the Year 1750, the consideration of the importance of training up our Youth in useful Learning, under the tuition of religious, prudent Persons, suitably qualified for that service, came weightily before the Meeting; when it was recommended, that Friends should exert themselves therein as fully as their circumstances would permit; and that the likeliest means to induce Persons properly qualified, to undertake the business would be, to have some certain income fixed, in con∣sideration of which the Master should be obliged to teach so many Children, on behalf of each Monthly or Particular Meeting, as the said Meeting shall judge adequate to the Salary; and that no Master should be employed, but with the approbation of a Com∣mittee of the Monthly Meeting, appointed for that and other ser∣vices, relating to such Schools: But we find that notwithstanding those pressing recommendations, very little has been effectually done therein. We therefore think it necessary that it be recom∣mended to the Quarterly, and from thence to the Monthly and Preparative Meetings, that the former advice of collecting a Fund, for the establishment and support of Schools, under the care of a standing Committee appointed by the several Monthly or Parti∣cular Meetings, should generally take place, and that it be recom∣mended by the Yearly Meeting, to Friends of each Quarter, to send up the next Year an account of what they have done therein. And we also think it necessary, that this weighty concern should in future become the continued care of the Yearly Meeting, by an Annual Query; that so the matter may rest on a solid foundation, and every possible encouragement and assistance may be afforded to
<PB N="116" REF="032162_0116_0FF166EFDBD70F58"/>
Friends, in the settlement of Schools, procuring Masters &amp;c. &amp;c. through the whole extent of the Yearly Meeting. And, notwith∣standing some difficulties may appear in the raising a sufficiency, fully to answer the end proposed, yet as improvements of this kind have often arisen from small beginnings, it is desired, that Friends be not discouraged, by their inability, but having faith in the divine blessing, being conferred on their benevolent intentions, would begin, by making some provision, agreeable to the circum∣stances of their respective Meetings. That within the compass of each Meeting, where the settlement of a school is necessary, a lot of Ground be provided, sufficient for a Garden, Orchard, Grass for a Cow, &amp;c. And that a suitable House, Stable &amp;c. be erect∣ed thereon. There are but few Meetings but which may, in la∣bour, in materials or money, raise so much as would answer this charge. Such a provision would be an encouragement for a staid Person with a family, who will be likely to remain a considerable time, perhaps, his whole life, in the service, to engage therein. This will obviate the necessity Friends often think themselves under, of hiring no other but a single person, for a Master, on account of boarding him, from one House to another, amongst themselves; hence they are induced to bargain with transient Persons, often of doubtful characters; some of whom have proved to be Men of corrupt minds; and even where their conduct is moral, yet they are seldom likely to remain in the service any longer than some employ more agreeable to support themselves offers: Whereby the Teachers miss of opportunity of improvement, which nothing will give, equal to that experience gained by long practice, in the edu∣cation or the Youth. A service, which, however it may be slighted by many, if duly performed, is as arduous to the Teacher, as it is of advantage to the Youth: And which if it was undertaken by pious minded Persons, more from an inclination of benefiting the Youth, than from a desire of gain, would afford a satisfaction far exceeding that of spending their time either in supineness and ease, delighting themselves in the enjoyment of their Wealth, or in the pleasure of amassing more. For indeed as the Apostle observes I. Cor. VI. 20. II. Cor. V. 15. <Q>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price—that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them.</Q> And here a sorrowful consideration occurs, which we
<PB N="117" REF="032162_0117_0FF166F2D4F08110"/>
desire to mention with caution and tenderness, that is the back∣wardness so apparent amongst us to contribute that part of our sub∣stance, which the circumstance of things and the necessities of the People, have on different occasions made necessary; if this had not been the case, a matter of so great importance as the virtuous edu∣cation of our Youth, would not have lain neglected, for so long a course of Years; after such pressing advices had been, so expressly, handed down from the Yearly Meeting: Hence arises a query, how far our neglect of applying to the necessary service of our fel∣low-men, such part of the goods many have laid up in store, is one of the causes of the deep affliction which now so feelingly at∣tends, and how small a part of what has been forcibly taken from many, if it had been seasonably, and cheerfully contributed, would have answered the several good purposes, which have either been refused, or neglected by us.</P>
<P>The giving proper encouragement to such Teachers as are capa∣ble by example and precept, to promote the growth of piety and virtue; as well as due instruction in our Youth, and are likely to continue in the service, would be attended with further advanta∣ges as well from the experience the Teachers would necessarily gain, as the opportunity they would have of training up lame Chil∣dren, and such, who in other respects, may be incapable of sup∣porting themselves by labour, to be educated and qualified to serve as School Masters; a consideration well worthy our particular Care, as well from duty as interest. The benefit of the Youth, and the means of a comfortable living for the Master, may be in∣creased, by the conveniency which might be made, for boarding some children, under his care, whose distant situation might other∣wise impede their instruction.</P>
<P>And if to what has been proposed, Friends were willing to add the promoting a subscription, towards a Fund, the increase of which might be employed in paying the Master's Salary, if necessary, and promoting the education of the poorer Friend's children; such a Fund though it might be but small in the beginning, being a fix∣ed object, would draw the attention of Friends to contribute, whereas so long as there is no beginning made, this weighty ser∣vice is neglected, by many, who would be glad of giving encou∣ragement to so necessary and good a work.

in proportion to their abilities, it will, like the Widow's Mite, entitle them to the blessing: People frequently appear to think it is at their option to do what they will with their substance which they call their own, to give or to withhold, at their plea∣sure, forgetting that they are but as Stewards, accountable to him who has entrusted them: Others think they are justifiable, though in the neglect of this plain Duty, in order to heap up the more Riches for their offspring, contrary to our Blessed Saviour's express Command, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures on the Earth," and notwithstanding the multiplied experience, daily before our Eyes, that Riches, generally prove as Wings to raise their Children above Truth; or as thick Clay to bind them to the Earth; But neither of these conclusions will stand the test of that Gospel injunc∣tion, "Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thyself;" nor enable to give a satisfactory account when that alarming proclamation will be made, <Q>Steward, give an account of thy Stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer Steward.</Q></P>

<P>It sorrowfully appearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liberality again recommended to promote Schools under exemplary Tea∣chers.</NOTE> that there are affecting deviations from that plainness of speech, behaviour and apparel, which Truth has, and if obeyed does lead into; it is affectionately recommended to Parents and Heads of Families, to seek after best wisdom for the government of those under their care, and that proper endeavours may be used to inculcate on the tender Minds of the rising Youth the essential Principles and Doctrines of the Christian Religion, that so, that obvious rawness and ignorance which appears in many, may be done away; and as helpful thereto, Friends are again ear∣nestly desired, with true liberality, to encourage and promote Schools under the care of religious, exemplary Tutors, and to esta∣blish Funds as recommended by this Meeting in the Year 1778. to revive which five hundred Copies of the said recommendatory Mi∣nute are now directed to be printed and sent down to the Quarterly and Monthly Meetings.</P>

<P>We entreat all Parents seriously to lay to heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The importance of a religious education.</NOTE> the great and lasting importance of a religious education to their Offspring; and to be more solicitous that their tender minds may be impressed with virtuous Principles, and early directed into the path of Purity▪ by which they may obtain the Pearl of great Price, than to provide for them superfluous and uncertain Riches, frequently the sorrow∣ful means of their Declension and ruin.

<P>ADVISED, that no Friends Suffer Romances, Play Books,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holy Scriptures to be preferred to o∣ther Books.</NOTE> or other vain and idle Pamphlets in their Houses or Families, which tend to corrupt the Minds of Youth; but that they excite them to the reading of the holy Scriptures, and other good and religious Books. 1721.</P>
<P>Recommended as an incumbent duty on Friends to cause their children to be frequent in reading the holy Scriptures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frequent read∣ing the Scrip∣tures recom∣mended.</NOTE> and in ob∣serving to them the examples of such children, as in Scripture are recorded to have early learned the fear of the Lord, and hearken∣ed to his counsel: Instructing them therein; labouring to impress their Minds with reverence towards God, from whom they have their daily support; shewing them that they ought not to offend him, but love, serve, and honour him, in whose hands all Blessings are. E. D. 1709.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as the Scriptures of Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An esteem for the Scriptures to be raised in the Minds of Youth.</NOTE> are the external means of conveying and preserving to us an account of the things most sure∣ly believed, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Flesh, and the fulfilling of the Prophecies relating thereto; we recommend to all Friends, especially Elders in the Church, and Heads of Families, that they would, both by example and advice, impress on the minds of the younger Rank, a reverend esteem of those excellent Writings, and advise them to a frequent reading and meditating therein;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concerned Friends to re∣commend their usefulness.</NOTE> and that you would at proper times and seasons when you find your minds rightly disposed thereunto, give the Youth to understand, that the same good experience of the work of Sanctification, through the operation of the Spirit of God, which the holy Scriptures plentifully bear Testimony to, is to be witnessed by Believers in all Generations, as well as by those in the first Ages of Christianity; on which occasions, some account of your own experience may be helpful to them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And tell the Youth their ex∣perience.</NOTE> And this may be the means under the Divine Blessing, of leading their Minds in∣to

a firm belief of the Christian Doctrine in general, and in parti∣cular the necessity of the aid and help of the operations of the holy Spirit of God in the Hearts of Men, abundantly declared in that most excellent Book the Bible; and for preserving them from being defiled with the many pernicious notions and Principles, con∣trary to such sound doctrine, which are at this time industriously dispersed, to the reproach of the Christian Profession. E. D. 1728.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parents &amp;c. to instruct their Children in the Scriptures and point out the great Truths they contain.</NOTE>We tenderly and earnestly advise and exhort all Parents and Heads of Families, that they exert themselves in the Wisdom of God, and in the strength of his love, to instruct their Children and Families in the Doctrines and Precepts of the Christian Religion, contained in the holy Scriptures; and that they excite them to the diligent reading of those excellent writings, which plainly set forth the Miraculous Conception, Birth, Holy Life, wonderful Works, Blessed example, Meritorious Death, and Glorious Resurrection, Ascention and Mediation of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; and to educate their children in the belief of those important truths, as well as in the belief of the inward manifestation and operation of the Spirit of God on their own Minds, that they may reap the benefit and advantage thereof, for their own Peace and everlasting Happiness, which is infinitely preferable to all other considerations—We therefore exhort, in the most earnest manner, that all be careful in this respect, a neglect herein being in our Judgment very blame-worthy.

<HEAD>TAVERNS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is advised, that Friends unite in endeavouring to lessen the number of Taverns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of Taverns discou∣raged.</NOTE> and to be careful in respect to signing Pe∣titio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to recommend Persons for that employment. 1738.</P>
<P>We entreat our young Friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unnecessary resort to Ta∣verns discoura∣ged.</NOTE> with readiness to receive and observe the loving wholesome admonition of their Parents and Friends, and carefully to avoid all evil Company, and communica∣tion which corrupt good manners: And we think it necessary to renew our advice, not only to the Young, but to those of riper Age, to avoid the keeping of much Company, and resorting to Taverns and Places of entertainment when necessary Business does not call them, whereby they are not only subjected to the tempta∣tion of drinking to excess, the dismal effects of which in many we see and lament, but hereby an opportunity is offered, for Men of corrupt Minds to sow the evil Seeds of loose Principles, to the calling in Question the great Truths of Religion set forth in the Scriptures of Truth, and striking at the Foundation of Godliness and holy living, the ensnaring Consequences whereof we desire all may lay to Heart in time. And in order that those who are un∣happily taken in these Snares, or engaged in such dangerous Con∣versation, may be induced to break off before it is too late; it is our desire, that the Elders, and considerate concerned Friends, may show a disposition to engage them in their Company, and treat them with freedom and kindness, which will very much make way for such advice as they may have to communicate to them; but if after all this labour no fruits of amendment appear, then proceed to a regular discharge of Duty, by dealing with them ac∣cording to Gospel Order 1746.</P>
<P>Considering the difficulties and Snares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caution against keeping Ta∣verns,</NOTE> both to our young Peo∣ple and others, which are attendant on keeping Houses of public enter∣tainment, Beer Houses and Dram Shops, whereby the reputation of Truth has greatly suffered, and in some Places the children and Families of Persons concerned herein have been brought into dis∣grace

and ruin; it is the united sense of this Meeting, that Friends ought not to give way to the desire of outward Gain arising from such employments; but to keep themselves clear thereof by attend∣ing to the pointings of pure wisdom, which will lead us to seek for a way of supporting ourselves and Families in Business more con∣sistent with our holy Profession, and not liable to such snares and dangers. And that all professing with us be advised not to go in∣to these Practices; and that such as are already engaged therein should be advised to decline them, as being opposite to the sense of this Meeting now expressed. And that Quarterly and Monthly Meetings do keep this subject closely in view, and by no means neglect the proper care towards all such who are in danger of de∣viating in these respects. 1777.</P>

<P>ADVISED,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Punctual per∣formance of pro∣mises.</NOTE> that all Friends be careful of entering into hasty engagements, but when they give their words, that they as carefully abide by and perform them to the utmost of their power, the Reputation which Truth gives them being otherwise wound∣ed, and such often occasion great disappointments to others, and give great offence, and where any fail herein, it is desired that they be admonished to give satisfaction, and do better. And let none Trade beyond their ability, to the hazard of others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">None to Trade beyond ability.</NOTE> nor suffer their Minds to be defiled or oppressed by the Earth. 1695. 1701.</P>
<P>This Meeting being under an earnest care and concern for the Glory of God, the reputation of our religious Profession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends not to launch out too far; but keep to their proper Business.</NOTE> and safe∣ty, and growth of every Member, do advise and counsel all Friends in true love, and for their own good, that they keep to such honest and lawful employments as they well understand, and are able to manage for a necessary support of themselves and Families; and that they do not launch out beyond their abilities, especially upon such credit as their Profession of the Truth may have given them, more at the Hazard of others who trust them, than at their own, which is not only a dishonour to Truth, but dishonest as Men; such cannot be owned therein to have a place in the Body.</P>
<P>It is the advice of this Meeting that Overseers and other con∣cerned Friends do visit every Family amongst us where they think there is occasion to suspect they are so declining in their worldly circumstances as to be likely to bring reproach on our Christian Profession, by falling short of honestly discharging their contracts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends to visit Persons suspect∣ed of going backward in their Circum∣stances.</NOTE> to the injury of their just Creditors; and if they will not take the ad∣vice of Friends, then the Monthly Meeting to which such belong ought to deal further with them, with liberty after due inquiry into the case to testify against them as the nature of the case, and reputation of Truth may be found to require. 1710.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="032162_0128_0FF16711E6E34AB0"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends to keep their words, &amp; pay their debts in time.</NOTE>Advised, that such be dealt with, as Trade by Sea or Land, or buy, bargain or contract, beyond their ability; and such as keep not their words, promises, or engagements in their dealings; nor pay their just debts according to time agreed on, these being a re∣proach to Truth; and if they do not amend, and duly answer they are to be further proceeded against. 1719.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To avoid ha∣zards, live plain, avoiding evasi∣ons and Deceit.</NOTE>It is our earnest desire that all Friends be very careful to avoid an inordinate pursuit after the things of this world, by such ways and means as depend too much upon the uncertain probabilities of hazardous enterprizes, but rather labour to content themselves with such a plain way and manner of living as is most agreeable to the self denying Principle of Truth which we profess, and which is most conducive to that tranquility of Mind requisite to a religious conduct through this world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Care of our first Friends herein.</NOTE> Our primitive Friends were very re∣markable for their uprightness and honesty in their Commerce and Converse; very exact in performing their words and promises, without evasive excuses; and in their dealings they were sincere, to the reputation of the Society; much less did they by deceitful pretences, involve themselves in a multitude of affairs which they had not understanding or Stock to manage, or contract debts which they were unable to pay, and thereby wrong their Neighbours, which the Testimony of Friends has ever been against. 1724. 1734. 1746.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends in dan∣ger of failing, to call their cre∣ditors together, and refusing so to do, to be censured.</NOTE>Advised, that a conscientious care dwell on all our Minds, not only to be just in our Trade and Dealings, neither deceiving the Buyer in what we sell, or falsifying the Balances, but that we keep to our promises, and pay our Debts in due time, not exceed∣ing our circumstances in our way of living, or in our Trade, and when any Member of our religious Society finds himself not able to comply with his contracts, that he call his Creditors together, and declare his condition in time, and where any thus circumstanc∣ed refuse so to do, let such be testified against. 1737.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Glorious free¦dom of the Spi∣rit of Truth.</NOTE>It being evident, that the Spirit of Truth, where it is received and given way to, brings into such a glorious Liberty and free∣dom of Spirit, that those who keep under the influence of it, are not in Bondage to the Spirit of this World; We therefore desire both Old and Young to bear in Mind the advice and promise of our Blessed Saviour, <Q>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added.</Q> Mat. VI. 33. But we are jealous that the lukewarmness and indifferency
<PB N="129" REF="032162_0129_0FF16715E65683A0"/>
which is manifest in too many respecting the maintaining our antient Testimony, hath crept in and prevailed, and the progress of the work of Religion in their Hearts hath been obstructed by the inor∣dinate pursuit of Worldly Riches. 1746.</P>
<P>See this Sentiment further pursued under the head Conduct and Conversation. Page 35. 1734.</P>
<P>Advised, that Friends every where should be careful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to defraud the Govern∣ment of its dues.</NOTE> not only to be in no respect concerned in defrauding the Government of its Duties, but in our Conversation that we do not by any means abet or encourage the Practice in others; wherein we desire that all Friends would sincerely unite in a becoming zeal, to maintain a faithful Testimony. 1755. 1771.</P>
<P>It is earnestly recommended that Friends frequently inspect the state of their affairs, and when any find themselves unable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends to dis∣close their cir∣cumstances when danger∣ous.</NOTE> or have not more than sufficient to pay their just Debts, that they immedi∣ately disclose their circumstances to some judicious Friends, or prin∣cipal Creditors, and take the advice of their Brethren how to act, and be particularly careful not to pay one Creditor in preference to another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To keep accounts with care.</NOTE> It is also recommended to all Persons concerned in Trade, to keep their accounts in such a clear, and accurate man∣ner, that in case of failure, their Creditors may see how the defi∣ciency has happened: And those Friends who may be appointed by Monthly Meetings to visit those who have failed, should always inquire of Assignees or Trustees, how they have acted in the above respects, and report to the Meeting. And it is advised,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duty of Trus∣tees or Assign∣ees.</NOTE> that when Friends accept the office of Trustee or Assignee, they be active in collecting the effects of the Estate, and punctual in mak∣ing speedy distribution. And it is the Judgment of this Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collections, &amp;c. not to be re∣ceived from such who fail, until they make full payments.</NOTE> that Monthly or other Meetings ought not to receive collections or bequests for the use of the Poor, or other services of the Society, of Persons who have fallen short in the payment of their just debts, though legally discharged by their Creditors; for until such Persons have paid the deficiency, their Possessions cannot, in equity, be consi∣dered as their own.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Certificates not to be given to excuse from Militia Fines.</NOTE>It appearing that a Militia Law is lately passed in the lower Counties, by which Friends are to be excused from some part of the penalties inflicted, on producing Certificates from the Monthly Meetings to which they respectively belong, of their being Mem∣bers; which being considered, it is the sense of this Meeting, that the granting of such Certificates may be attended with inconveni∣ence, and therefore adviseth against them. 1742.</P>

Agreeable to which is the Doctrine of our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and his Apostles; whereto our antient Friends abundantly bore testimony, both in Doctrine and Practice, and suffered deeply for; which hath been confirmed by several of our Yearly Meetings, by their express declarations and testimonies against carrying of Guns for defending our Ships, Persons, and Goods; being under many strong obligations to observe the same; nevertheless, some professing to be of our Society have slighted and neglected this our antient and Christian Testimony to that degree as to be concerned in Privateering, or as Owners of Ships going with Letters of Mart, which is a flagrant and lamentable departure from our peace∣able principle, which hath always been to confide in the protection and Providence of Almighty God, and not in weapons of war. And as these practices are attended with injustice, barbarity, and

bloodshed, this Meeting, after a serious consideration thereon, have thought it our incumbent duty to bear our Testimony against the same; and it is the unanimous sense of this Meeting, that all Quarterly and Monthly Meetings, ought speedily to deal, in the Spirit of Truth and love, with every Person found in the practice of any of these things, in order to bring them to a sense of their Error, and to reclaim them from it, which if they cannot do, then to testify against them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to purchase prize goods.</NOTE> And it is also the Judgment of this Meet∣ing, that all our Members be cautioned and earnestly admonished against purchasing of prize goods, knowing, or having reasonable cause to suspect them to be such, as a thing altogether inconsistent with our principles. 1744.</P>
<P>As it hath pleased the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bearing of Arms and fight∣ing, unlawful to us.</NOTE> by the breaking forth of the glori∣ous light of the Gospel, and the shedding abroad of his holy Spirit, to gather us to be a People, and to unite in Love, not only one to another, but to the whole Creation of God; we therefore en∣treat all who profess themselves Members of our Society, to be faithful to that antient testimony borne by us ever since we were a People, against bearing of arms, and fighting, that by a conduct agreeable to our Profession we may demonstrate ourselves to be real followers of the Messiah, <Q>The Prince of Peace, of the in∣crease of whose government and Peace there shall be no end.</Q> Isa.

<P>It being represented to this Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends not to accept the Ba∣lance after dis∣traint and sale of their proper∣ty for Fines, &amp;c.</NOTE> that in some Places where distraint hath been made of Friends goods for not paying fines, for nonperformance of warlike services, the officers after sale of them, have proposed returning the overplus, after deducting the Fine and costs; it was unanimously agreed, that in all such cases, Friends should rather suffer cheerfully than accept such overplus, unless where, without any change of the species the officers return the same goods which they distrained, or a part of them. 1755.</P>
<P>It is declared to be the sense of this Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Furnishing Waggons to convey Military stores a Milita∣ry service.</NOTE> that furnishing Waggons or other means for conveying of Military Stores, is a Military service, and that the care of Elders, Overseers, and faith∣ful Friends, should be extended, in true love and christian tender∣ness, to such as deviate herein, in order to convince them of their error. 1758.</P>
<P>We desire that all Friends would be careful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends not to be spectators of Military prepa∣rations, &amp;c.</NOTE> that in no part of their conduct they manifest an approbation or countenance to such

things as are obviously contrary to our peaceable profession and principles, either as spectators or otherwise, at the same time avoiding to give just occasion of offence to any who do not make religious profession with us, thereby discovering that we are actuat∣ed solely by a conscientious Principle and christian spirit, agreeable to the repeated cautions and advices heretofore given forth by this Meeting, our Meeting for Sufferings, and the Epistles from our Brethren in Great Britain. 1775.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends not to pay fines, Pe∣nalty or Tax in lieu of personal service, or al∣low their Chil∣dren or servants to act therein,</NOTE>As we cannot, consistent with our Christian peaceable Testimony, founded on the example and precepts of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and of his Apostles, be concerned in the promoting of War, or warlike measures of any kind; it is our judgment, that such who make religious profession with us, and do either openly or by connivance, pay any Fine, Penalty, or Tax, in lieu of their personal services for carrying on War; or who do consent to, and allow their Children, Apprentices, or Servants to act therein, do thereby violate our Christian Testimony, and by so doing manifest that they are not in religious fellowship with us.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tax for pur∣chasing Drums Colours, &amp;c. not to be paid.</NOTE>It is the sense of this Meeting, that a Tax levied for the purchas∣ing of Drums, Colours, and other warlike uses, cannot be paid consistent with our Christian Testimony. 1776.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Taxes for carrying on War cautioned against.</NOTE>Finding that in several Quarters a religious scruple hath appeared, and increaseth among Friends against the payment of Taxes impos∣ed for the purposes of carrying on War, their Minds being deeply concerned and engaged, faithfully to maintain our Christian testi∣mony against joining with or supporting the spirit of Wars and fightings, which hath remarkably tended to unite us in deep sym∣pathy with the seed of Life in their Hearts: And feeling a sincere
<PB N="133" REF="032162_0133_0FF1671EC41DF480"/>
desire for the advancement of the Kingdom of the Prince of Peace, in such a gradual progress as may be consistent with his di∣vine will; it is the united sense of this Meeting, fervently to recom∣mend to all the Members of our religious Society, that in singleness of Heart we may be truly exercised in giving due attention to the dictates of unerring Grace, and strictly careful not to stifle or sup∣press the secret monitions thereof in our Minds;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A compliance with requisiti∣ons for the pur∣poses of War cautioned against.</NOTE> and that all may be closely excited to watchfulness and care to avoid complying with the injunctions and requisitions made for the purposes of carrying on war, which may produce uneasiness to themselves, or tend to increase the sufferings of their Brethren, which we apprehend will be the most effectual means of advancing our Christian testimony in purity, and of preserving us in a conduct consistent with the holy principle we profess. And thus we shall experience fervent love and concord to prevail amongst us, which will enable us to seek and promote the edification one of another, in that Faith which worketh by love, freed from every censure inconsistent there∣with. 1778.</P>
<P>Being favoured with that solemn covering which produceth una∣nimity and brotherly love, this Meeting doth agree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to be con∣cerned in armed Vessels or the purchase of goods imported in them.</NOTE> that although our solid sense hath been frequently given to excite and encourage all Friends to stand faithful to our antient testimony against the spirit of Wars and Fighting, yet it may be seasonable and proper, for the preservation of the weak, and strengthening the faithful, to advise and exhort the Members of our religious Society to great watchfulness and circumspection in their conduct, conversation, dealing, and commerce. And such of our Members who are con∣cerned in armed Vessel's should be admonished and dealt with agreeable to the Rules of our Discipline.—And it is further recom∣mended that our Members individually religiously cherish the ren∣der intimations of the peaceable Spirit of the Gospel, with respect to suffering motives of worldly advantage to induce them to ship or order their goods shipped in armed Vessels: And that all Friends be vigilant and careful that they do not suffer their Minds to be drawn out by prospects of Gain to deal in or purchase goods so imported.</P>
<P>And we are desirous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends to at∣tend to their tender scruples against grinding Grain for the Army.</NOTE> and earnestly recommend that Friends in every Quarter be encouraged to attend to their tender scruples against contributing to the promotion of War, by grinding of
<PB N="134" REF="032162_0134_0FF167207234EF90"/>
Grain, feeding of Cattle, or selling their property for the use of the army, or other such warlike purposes. And that in Christian love and tenderness, advice should be extended to such among us who have deviated, or are in danger of deviating from the testi∣mony of Truth in these respects, in order that a concern and la∣bour may be manifested for the advancement of the peaceable Kingdom, and for our preservation in that Bond of brotherly love which cements and unites the true followers of Christ. And it is with unanimity recommended to the Quarterly and Monthly Meet∣ings, and to the Members of our religious Society in general, to observe and practise the advices and caution herein communicated. 1779.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends to at∣tend to the mo∣nitions of Grace against sundry things promo∣tive of War.</NOTE>It is our unanimous sense and judgement, that a living concern for the advancement of our testimony to the peaceable Kingdom of Christ, by refraining from such compliances as evidently tend to war and bloodshed, still continues to spread in many minds; and a fervent desire hath prevailed amongst us, that according to the advices given forth by this Meeting at sundry times, particularly in the Year 1776, 1778 and 1779, respecting an engagement in any Business tending to promote War; sharing or partaking of the spoils of War, by purchasing or selling Prize Goods; payment of Taxes for the purposes of War; being concerned in armed Vessels; importing or shipping of goods in such Vessels; dealing in or pur∣chasing goods so imported; grinding of Grain; feeding of Cattle; or selling their property for the use of the army; the Members of our religious Society be again exhorted to attend to the monitions of Divine Grace, and carefully guard against suppressing them, either in themselves or others, that so they may be preserved in a conduct consistent with our holy Profession, and from wounding the minds or increasing the sufferings of each other; not at all doubting, that he to whom appertains the Kingdom and the power, who is wonderful in working, will continue to carry on and perfect his blessed cause of Peace in the Earth. And a solid attention to this concern is recommended to the diligent care and practice of Quarterly, Monthly, and Preparative Meetings, and our Brethren in general, having a due regard to the movings of divine wisdom, which will produce a single eye to the honour of Truth and the unity of the Church. 1780. 1781.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="032162_0135_0FF16726C3EEBAA8"/>It is the united sense and judgement of this Meeting that it is incon∣sistent with our religious Testimony and Principle for any Friend to pay a Fine or Tax levied on them on account of their refusal to serve in the Militia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Military Fines not to be paid, however appli∣ed.</NOTE> although such Fine or imposition may be ap∣plied towards defraying the expences of civil Government. 1790.</P>
<P>It is recommended to Monthly Meetings to extend labour to such Members as have dealt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Military Cer∣tificates not to be dealt in.</NOTE> or hereafter may deal in public Certificates issued as a compensation for expences accrued and services perform∣ed in the late War; and as we are united in sentiment that such a traffic is inconsistent with our peaceable Testimony and Principles; if any after proper counsel and admonition, should so far disregard the sense of this Meeting and the advice of Friends as to continue in the practice, Monthly Meetings may safely proceed to testify against them as in cases of other breaches of our Discipline, 1791.</P>

<HEAD>WILLS.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friends to make their Wills in health.</NOTE>WE think it proper to recommend, that Friends make their Wills in time of health; and that they be careful to renew them as often as occasion may require. 1721. 1722.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Making Wills in time of health, and without re∣membrance of resentments ad∣vised.</NOTE>Knowing how quickly many are removed by Death, it is weigh∣tily recommended, that care be taken by each Monthly Meeting, that Friends who have Estates to dispose of, be advised to make their Wills in time of health, and strength of Judgement, and there∣in to direct their substance as in Justice and Wisdom may be to their satisfaction and peace; laying aside all resentment, though occasion may have been given, lest it should go with them to the Grave, remembering we all stand in need of Mercy and Forgiveness. Making such Wills in due time can shorten no ones days, but the omission, or delay thereof to the time of a Sick Bed, when the Mind should not be diverted from a solemn consideration of the approaching awful period of Life, has often proved very injurious to many, and been the occasion of creating animosities in Families, which the timely performance of this necessary duty, before the painful struggles of Nature impaired the understanding, or ren∣dered so arduous a temporal consideration unseasonable, might have effectually prevented. E. D.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and to employ skilful Persons to draw them.</NOTE>Friends are earnestly recommended to employ Persons skilful in the Law, and of good repute, to make their Wills, as great incon∣venience and loss, and sometimes the ruin of Families hath hap∣pened through the unskilfulness of some who have taken upon them to write Wills, being unqualified to act in a matter of such importance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inventory speedily to be made.</NOTE> And all Friends who may become Executors or Ad∣ministrators are advised to make a full clear and perfect Inventory of the estate and effects of the deceased, as soon as possible after the Interment, as many difficulties and disputes have arisen, and sometimes injustice been done for want of it, or by deferring it too long.

<HEAD>YEARLY MEETING.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears by the Records,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Yearly Meeting.</NOTE> that the first Yearly Meeting was held at Burlington the 31st day of the Sixth Month 1681, for the Provinces of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 1681.</P>
<P>It is unanimously agreed by this Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One Yearly Meeting for Pennsylvania &amp; New Jersey.</NOTE> that there be but one Yearly and General Meeting in Pennsylvania and West Jersey, one Year at Burlington, and another at Philadelphia for Men and Wo∣men. 1685.</P>

<P>As to the proposal for an alteration of the Yearly Meeting of Business to Philadelphia, to be there held every Year;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spring Meet∣ing established.</NOTE> this Meet∣ing concludes it best, for divers considerations, to remain as it is at present established: But being of opinion that a Yearly Meeting for worship to be held at Philadelphia annually may be of service, this Meeting appoints that a Meeting shall be held at Philadelphia on the second first day of the Week in the next third Month, and to hold two days for worship, and so to be continued annually on the same day. 1712.</P>
<P>The time fixed upon for the Spring Yearly Meeting at Phila∣delphia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of hold∣ing Spring Meeting.</NOTE> was altered to the third First day of the Week in the first Month. 1713.</P>

<P>It is the sense of this Meeting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extracts, &amp;c. from Yearly Meeting to be sent by Quar∣terly to Month∣ly Meetings.</NOTE> that full copies of Extracts of the Minutes of this Meeting, and of all other Papers which are sent at any time by direction of this Meeting to the several Quarterly Meetings, should, by the Clerk or such other Friend as each Quar∣terly

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of hold∣ing Y. Meet∣ing.</NOTE>Agreed to hold the Yearly Meeting on the fourth First Day of the Week in the ninth Month. 1758.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of open∣ing the Yearly Meeting of Mi∣nisters and El∣ders, and Year∣ly Meeting of Business.</NOTE>By a Minute from our Meeting of Ministers and Elders now produced and read, it appears, that they have had for several Years under consideration, the benefit and expediency of opening that Meeting on the Seventh day of the Week preceding the Yearly Meeting, at the tenth hour in the forenoon, instead of the eleventh, and that the Yearly Meeting for Business should begin on Second Day at the tenth hour in the forenoon instead of the third in the afternoon; and that the Meetings for public worship on that Day should hereafter be discontinued, which being solidly attended to is concurred with and adopted. 1789.</P>

<HEAD>YEARLY AND OTHER MEETINGS FOR DISCIPLINE OF WOMEN FRIENDS.</HEAD>
<P>FORASMUCH as our Women's Meetings for Discipline were at first set up and established in divine wisdom, and by long ex∣perience have been found of manifest advantage, not only to the Society in general, but the Youth of their own sex in particular. It is earnestly desired, that our Sisters in the Truth, whom the Lord hath endued with Spiritual Gifts, may be encouraged to come up to the help of their Brethren in that part of the Discipline of the Church properly claiming their attention and care: On con∣sidering the nature and extent whereof, it is apprehended a benefit might accrue, by explicitly setting forth their distinct allotment and separate services in their Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, and also in their Yearly Meeting.</P>

<P N="7"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elders, how to be chosen.</NOTE>VII. When the nomination of a Woman Elder is judged expe∣dient, the Women's Meeting should appoint a judicious Committee to join with a Committee of the Men's Meeting in the consideration thereof, whose united result is first to be communicated to the Men's Meeting, and their conclusion afterwards imparted to the Women's.</P>
