cruiser belonging to this regency, shall be al∣lowed to take any person, of whatever nation or denomination, out of any vessel belonging to the United States of North America, in order to examine them, or under pretence of making them confess any thing desired; nei∣ther shall they inflict any corporal punishment, or any way else molest them.</P>
<P><LABEL>ARTICLE 6th.</LABEL> If any vessel belonging to the United States of North America, shall be stranded on the coast of this Regency, they shall receive every possible assistance from the subjects of this Regency: all goods saved from the wreck shall be permitted to be reimbarked on board of any other vessel, without paying any duties at the custom house.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="031410_0008_0FEC50B5980E5EF8"/>
written obligation so to do. Should the Dey want to freight any American vessel that may be in the Regency, or Turkey, said vessel not being engaged; in consequence of the friendship subsisting between the two nations, he expects to have the preference given him, on his paying the same freight offered by any other nation.</P>
<P><LABEL>ARTICLE the 15th.</LABEL> Any disputes or suits at law, that may take place between the sub∣jects of the Regency and the citizens of the United States of North America, shall be decided by the Dey in person, and no other.
