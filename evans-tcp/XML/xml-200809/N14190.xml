<HEAD>AN AFFECTIONATE ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear young Friends, fellow Members of the same Meeting,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not that suitable advice has not been administered to every state and condition, that induces me to make this address; but as the connection between us may occasion this to be read, while advices more worthy may escape notice, I trust it will sufficiently justify me in thus at∣tempting to impart some things, wherein I apprehend your present and future wel∣fare is much concerned.</P>
<P>I would, however, first premise, that all will allow the most important concern to us, in this life, is to endeavour after such a state of mind, that we may be enabled so to live and conduct ourselves in this world,
<PB N="6" REF="017968_0005_0FA409892AFB20C8"/>as that all our actions may tend to render us fit companions for men here, and for purified and blessed spirits hereafter: our existence will else be of no value, no other pursuit being worthy our attention. The solemn period, that will reduce every state, condition, and thing, to one level, is certain to us all; prosperity and adver∣sity, riches and poverty, health and sick∣ness, however differently estimated now, will then, in fact, admit of no choice or difference, or afford any comfort, other∣wise than as such proper uses have been made of them as may have promoted this great end: for if we were possessed in the highest degree of this world's good, or what is most sought after, viz. health, power, affluence, and pleasure, and had not a better hope, we should be most miserable; that which we feared to lose, and knew we must lose, would take away the true enjoyment of every blessing assorded by Divine Providence. On the contrary, did we but experience our minds redeemed from transitory things, and sixed on the better hope, we should, as was testified of the meek, enjoy even the earth in a right and true manner; receiving with thankful hearts the mercies of the Almighty, using this world as not abusing it, and not be
<PB N="7" REF="017968_0006_0FA4098A33EA6BA8"/>afraid, whenever it should please him to call us hence, freely to resign up all. Hav∣ing said this, I shall now proceed, and hope to be enabled to convince you, that the profession of your education, becoming that of your judgment and practice, will, through divine assistance, bring you into this happy situation, which both your greatest interest and most incumbent duty demand you earnestly to seek after. I need hardly ask you the question, "Your fathers, where are they, and the prophets, do they live for ever?" Zech. i. 5. You will readily answer, They are gone. What then? are the words they taught, and the statutes they were commanded by the Almighty, buried with them? I hope not. By whom then should the knowledge of them be pre∣served? Surely by such as are left behind. And I pray that we, who are the natural branches, may not (through our disregard thereto) lose our birthright for a mere mess of pottage; (a poor temporary gratification) but, like the sons of Jonadab, keep all their precepts: that the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, may not want a man of their posterity to stand before him for ever.</P>
<P>You need not be told, that they were very singular and different from others in their dress and address; and, however
<PB N="8" REF="017968_0007_0FA40A10A4C285C0"/>light some may now esteem these things, they suffered greatly for the same, both in body and goods, and their sufferings have opened to us a door of great liberty, but we do not, I fear, sufficiently prize it: if we did, there would be no running back again into bondage. If the Hebrew who might have been free and would not, de∣served to have his ear bored through with an awl, and be fixed in slavery for ever, such backsliders certainly do. There is such a dignity in the truth, and such a nobility in appearing like friends agreeable to our known principles, that it keeps even transgressors in awe, and libertines at a distance. A deviation opens a door to every hurtful thing, and introduces an acquaintance that oftentimes leads to ruin in this world, and, which is much worse, (though far be it from me to limit the mercies of the Almighty) unfits us, I fear, for happiness in the world to come. My beloved young friends, do not plead for this or that, as seeing no harm in it: ab∣stractedly considered, it may be indifferent, but, as it is connected, of the utmost im∣portance. A cocked-up hat, fashionable cloaths, or using the plural number instead of the singular, may be called by you in∣different things; you may say that speech
<PB N="9" REF="017968_0008_0FA40A11B61467F8"/>is to convey ideas, and what religion can there be in having a hat a little lower or higher? And in the same manner plead for every other liberty; but indeed these are very far from being indifferent things to us. These singularities, as you may call them, are like the locks of Sampson's hair, wherein if we suffer ourselves by any Delilah to be deceived, and depart from the plainness and simplicity of our profession, we shall lose our strength, and become weak as other men: who, seeing us in their state, will soon entice us into those things I have hinted at. I do not, however, by this mean to be understood, that we are to lay such a stress on an external appearance, as in any-wise to neglect what is internal. Make the inside clean, and the outside will be clean also. Our predecessors in the truth, we know, from well-grounded ob∣jections, laid aside greatly the exteriors men had added to religion, and recom∣mended to us an inward purity of heart and soul. If therefore, we become dead to the power of truth, having neither form nor power, we are so far from ex∣ceeding other professions, that, in my opi∣nion, we fall greatly short. I pray it may not be so with us; but, as our fathers before us walked in the truth, that we
<PB N="10" REF="017968_0009_0FA40A126DC44348"/>may likewise so walk; and have to say to them that succeed us, follow us as we have followed them, who followed the Lord Jesus in truth and righteousness. May you also be examples to the youth in other meetings; that they, beholding your circumspection, and the fear of God im∣pressed on your minds, may be encouraged to tread in the same path. Never be ashamed of being religious. I have thought nothing ever advanced the character of David more, than that zealous joyful self∣abasement which appeared in his dancing before the ark: and though, by the spirit of the world, such may be despised, as act∣ing too mean a part for the dignity of human pride, yet by the upright-hearted they will be had in honour, and their souls shall be satisfied as with marrow and fat∣ness, and know a growing in that which is truly good; when leanness and barrenness shall attend the scoffers, who at length shall be made to confess, Wisd. v. 4, 5. "We fools accounted their life madness, and their end to be without honour. How are they numbered amongst the children of God, and their lot is amongst the saints? What hath pride profited us, or what good hath riches and vaunting brought us? All these things are passed
<PB N="11" REF="017968_0010_0FA40A1332A28E10"/>away like as a shadow, and as a post that hasteth by, and we are now consumed in our own wickedness. But the righteous live for evermore, even they whom we had sometimes in derision, and a proverb of reproach: their reward is with the Lord, and the care of the Most High is over them." Thus by acting in character, agreeable to your profession, you will gain all things; and out of it, lose all. For what advantage can the whole world af∣ford, or any thing therein, when the time comes, which is most sure, that we shall have but one desire, even to die the death of the righteous, and our latter end to be like unto theirs, so emphatically set forth in the foregoing passages.</P>
<P>I would now set before you some out∣ward advantages you enjoy superior to many of your brethren; and press that proper use to be made of them which may further this great purpose of life—To finish well. Our meeting has been favour∣ed with a living, acceptable ministry: many watering seasons we have had, here a little and there a little. These blessings are not to be lightly esteemed; nor are we so to depend on them, as to neglect in any wise our attention to that great Minister, to
<PB N="12" REF="017968_0011_0FA40A13E71D2E00"/>whom both those that edify and those that are edified are servants. If we do, we shall suffer great loss; and as, on a certain oc∣casion, the Almighty said to Moses, "They are thy people, not mine," may it not be applicable to us? A lamentable exchange or difference, to become the children of men, from being children taught by the Most High, and in his truth established. The end of all true ministry is to direct to this; and the softening showers of the gospel are to water the heritage, that the good ground being opened thereby, the true seed may take root and grow up, bringing forth an increase proportionate to the talent received: in some thirty, some sixty, and some an hundred-fold. The frequent opportunities afforded us to meet together, are also great advantages; I do intreat you, by no means neglect them. It is great encouragement to see a meeting well and timely filled. I remember to have heard a friend once say in testimony, "That such as were indifferent about coming to meetings, were most indifferent when there." This is a truth to which I believe our ex∣perience will readily assent. Let us there∣fore in an especial manner guard against this indifference; and though we may have attended many meetings, and seem to
<PB N="13" REF="017968_0012_0FA40A14DA309AE8"/>be nevertheless in a distressed state, and hardly to know what good is, yet if we miss but one, that one might have been to us as the appearance of Jesus was to the disciples when they were very low in their minds. He then stood in the midst of them, and said, "Peace be unto you;" he shewed them his hands and his, side, and they were glad; he also breathed on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. Ob∣serve, from this memorable meeting one disciple was absent, and the report from others could not make him believe; and though our Lord, in condescension, af∣forded him another opportunity, when he could only cry out, "My Lord, and my God!" yet are we not to presume upon that, but cry earnestly to be endued with ability to perform the present duty in the present time.</P>
<P>Be exceeding choice of your company; for true it is, that evil communications corrupt good manners. Be as careful what books you read; and avoid those in the least tending to libertinism and deism, as you would an infectious distemper. Man, by all his earthly wisdom, cannot find out God; finite cannot comprehend infinite. In his unregenerate state, man
<PB N="14" REF="017968_0013_0FA40A17E6EF71B8"/>may puzzle and perplex himself with mat∣ters too high for him. Meddle not there∣with, but ever bear in remembrance, "The man that walketh uprightly, walketh se∣curely;" and that to such as "walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit, there is no condemnation." This is enough for us to believe and practise; let us leave the rest to the all wise Disposer of all things, and say with David, "He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see? And he that teacheth men knowledge, shall he not know?"</P>
<P>After requesting your frequent perusal of the holy scriptures, I would in a particular manner recommend to your reading the several volumes, intituled, Piety Promoted. What can more excite to piety, than to view men in their expiring moments joy∣fully leaving this world, from a conscious∣ness of a life spent in the fear of God? a time in which no dazzling object can de∣ceive, or any worldly enjoyment flatter. William Penn's Rise and Progress, wrote by way of preface to George Fox's jour∣nal, Dr. Rutty's Liberty of the Flesh and Spirit distinguished, and John Fry's Serious and Affectionate Address, I would also wish
<PB N="15" REF="017968_0014_0FA40A194C4B00D0"/>you all often to read, and seriously to consider. The many journals left by wor∣thy deceased friends will afford both de∣light and profit; the experiences of great and good men being by the wise always had in esteem. I am not insensible, whilst I thus recommend the examples of others, that great hurt hath been occasioned by the falling away of some men, from whom better things might have been expected, and that by their fall many have been wounded. I confess this is a lamentable circumstance; but should thousands fall on the right, and ten thousands on the left-hand, truth is truth; and may the failures of others tend to make us more circumspect and careful of ourselves, and quicken our endeavours, to the utmost of the ability afforded us, to be stedfast, im∣moveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord: ever bearing in remem∣brance, that the best of men are no longer safe than whilst on their guard; that the higher the attainment, the greater the fall; and that if the light that was once in us becomes darkness, that darkness is great indeed! And as, in the outward, when a man becomes blind, after having once seen, the loss of sight is more severely felt by him than by a person born blind; so
<PB N="16" REF="017968_0015_0FA40A1A7798E130"/>when those who have once spiritually seen afterwards fall into blindness, it is no marvel that the state of such should be worse than that of those who have not been so enlightened. I have seen so much hurt sustained by some who have begun right, by not keeping to the simplicity and innocency they once knew and began in, that I cannot but greatly desire our preservation and perseverance: and that with Joshua we may resolve, That, let others do what they will, we will to the utmost of our power follow on to know and serve the Lord.</P>
<P>It is a short time we have to be here, even the youngest: it will soon pass over, and flee as a shadow, or as a post that hasteth by. How many strong persons do we see unexpectedly called away? Have we not had in our own meeting very recent instances? By the records of our burials, I find in one month buried four young men, aged 28, 20, 18, and 17 years, and two in the 37th year. Were we con∣stantly to consider our latter end, it might tend greatly to make us wise, and sup∣press every inordinate desire. As I have dwelt pretty largely on this subject in the beginning of this address, I shall not add
<PB N="17" REF="017968_0016_0FA40A1AB663B8A8"/>much; my end in resuming it being rather to set before us the uncertainty when, than the certainty of our dissolution: being sensible of our aptness to put such consi∣derations afar off, especially in the young, the healthy, and the strong. But although the aged must die, the young may, and we see they do. How greatly, how essentially then doth it behove us to walk circum∣spectly, not as fools, but like wise men, redeeming our time. It was nobly re∣solved by one of old, who said, "All the days of my appointed time I will wait, until my change come." May you all be like minded: it will tend, I believe, to make your life comfortable, and your latter end peace.</P>
<P>As to your demeanour in your outward affairs, nothing can so perfectly direct you therein, as keeping to the truth; nor can any thing else enable you to bear disap∣pointments, which will unavoidably hap∣pen. Some points, however, it may not be amiss to mention. Treat all, with whom you have to do, with meekness and calmness: a soft answer turns away anger, and a wrong is sooner redressed and ac∣knowledged through a mild conduct than repreach. Imitate not those in an higher
<PB N="18" REF="017968_0017_0FA40A1B75CEBFF0"/>sphere of life. Endeavour to live rather below than above your situations. I have often seen exceeding hurt to individuals in this particular, who might have been very comfortable, had they confined their way of life to their situation in it; but, by looking and aiming at an higher, have, to support it, gone into hazardous undertak∣ings, brought very great inconveniency on themselves; and then have been ready to complain, and think their lot hard. An∣other thing I would observe to those in small circumstances, who may be in trades and business, that they do not trust their affairs in the hands of such as are likewise but of small circumstances. Men of greater may run hazards not justifiable in them: if they have less business on account of their caution, it is to be preferred, rather than to risque the little they have, where there may be a danger.</P>
<P>And such of you as may earn your bread with the sweat of your brow, repine not at it. Remember, that godliness with con∣tentment is great gain. Providence, in the all-wise disposal of things, has more equal∣ly bestowed his gifts than men perceive. The poor are exempt from many watch∣ings, toils, and fatigues, which the rich
<PB N="19" REF="017968_0018_0FA40A1C34D9E458"/>experience; their food is pleasant, and their rest sweet. The possession of the truth will make all conditions happy; and with∣out it all is confusion. The poor in this world, possessing these greater riches, will not repine for want of the lesser: their bread will be sure, and their water never fail, and they shall not even want outward bread. It will be a blessing to have to ad∣minister to such; and although at times their difficulties may appear great, such will remember what the apostle saith, "That the time is short, that they that weep be as though they wept not; and they that re∣joice as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy as though they possessed not:" and further, what he wrote to Timothy. "We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out; and hav∣ing food and raiment, let us be therewith content." Thus is verified what the same apostle wrote to his same beloved Timothy, "Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is, (through contentment) and of that which is to come" (by its effects.)</P>
<P>I shall not enlarge; a few short hints may be better remembered than longer dis∣courses; nor have I any desire to appear
<PB N="20" REF="017968_0019_0FA40A1D304EB300"/>in this public manner: for could I have conveyed these advices as from an anony∣mous writer, it would have suited my own inclination better; but I could not see how that might be done, so as to answer the end proposed. Finally, therefore, let me recommend to you, my dear young friends, in the words of the apostle, "that ye be kindly-affectioned one to another in bro∣therly love, in honour preferring one an∣other, and the God of love and peace be with you all. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>TRUE RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>HE hath shewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</P>
<P>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</P>
<P>Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatso∣ever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</P>
<P>The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="017968_0022_0FA40A1F6429DFA0"/>
<P>Add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to pa∣tience godliness, and to godliness bro∣therly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity.</P>
<P>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be bar∣ren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</P>
<P>—Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.</P>
<P>For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting king∣dom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>BLESSED are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</P>
<P>Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be found: but the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</P>
<P>The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is in the sight of God of great price.</P>
<P>The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.</P>
<P>The Lord taketh pleasure in his people; he will beautify the meek with salvation.</P>
<P>The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</P>

<P>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.</P>
<P>Lord, make me to know mine end, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the measure of my days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am.</P>
<P>Behold, thou hast made my days as an hand-breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee; verily every man at his best estate is altogether vanity.</P>
<P>Surely every man walketh in a vain shew, surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.</P>
<P>All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass: the grass withereth, and the flower thereof fadeth, but the word of the Lord endureth for ever.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="017968_0025_0FA40A250F61EB60"/>
<P>—The time is short; it remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that re∣joice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this world, as not abusing it; for the fashion of this world passeth away.</P>
<P>I made me great works, I builded me house, I planted me vineyards, &amp;c. I with∣held not myself from any joy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do, and behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun! But,</P>
<P>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth; yea, saith the spi∣rit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.</P>
<P>Oh that they were wise, that they un∣derstood this, that they would consider their latter-end!</P>
<PB N="27" REF="017968_0026_0EA40A252D2E1210"/>
<P>Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</P>
<P>Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble; he cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</P>
<P>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</P>
<P>The wicked is driven away in his wick∣edness, but the righteous hath hope in his death.</P>
<P>The hope of the righteous shall be glad∣ness, but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</P>
<P>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE YOUTH OF NORWICH MEETING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET me request your attention to the following lines. The subject nearly concerns you.—Despise not the counsel of One who has often looked upon you with tender regard, and been secretly engaged on your account, that the many gracious visitations of Divine love and mercy to you might be affectionately received, and duly prized by you. If you sincerely em∣brace them in humble resignation, and faithful obedience, the power of Truth will preserve you, and the fresh springs of life increase, and establish you in the
<PB N="30" REF="017968_0028_0FA40A26ACCC7D98"/>saving knowledge of God; but if you chuse the ways of the world, and walk after the sight of your eyes, and the ima∣ginations of your hearts, rejecting the gentle drawings and inward reproofs of his Holy Spirit, you not only forsake your own mercies for lying vanities, but also put a high indignity and affront upon the Sovereign Majesty, the great Judge of the quick and dead, who is every where a pre∣sent Observer of our conduct, and too jealous of his honour to suffer, without displeasure, the froward will of the crea∣ture to have the preference in any, to his just and holy will; and who will not force those into felicity who refuse his gracious offers.</P>
<P>Unless you take up your daily cross to selfish indulgencies and carnal gratifications, you cannot be the disciples of Christ, nor inherit those enjoyments which are of a divine and permanent nature. <Q>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if "ye through the Spirit do mortify the "deeds of the body, ye shall live. For "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons, or children, of God.</Q> Rom. viii. To follow the Lamb, whither∣soever he leads, is the only way to true and lasting happiness, notwithstanding the
<PB N="31" REF="017968_0029_0FA40A2782F3EF88"/>deceitful flatteries of a degenerate world, and the delusive persuasions of corrupt na∣ture to the contrary.</P>
<P>The subtil enemy of your peace begins with fair shews and plausible temptations, in things which, to inexperienced minds, appear of small concern. He knows, should he at once attempt you with mani∣fest iniquities and obvious impieties, it would shock your tenderness, and defeat his destructive intentions. He therefore seeks first to ensnare you, by secretly opera∣ting upon the complacency of your natural tempers, and your aversion to give disgust, by putting forward and heightening your natural desires, rather to please than profit yourselves and others, in your deportment and converse; and also to betray you into an ill-grounded shame of godly conversa∣tion, and pious walking, and a breach of the due adherence to those distinguishing peculiarities which the Truth has led its faithful followers into, and placed as an exterior hedge of preservation about them. These the blind world calls affected singu∣larities, and clownish absurdities, and styles the disregard and disuse of them an innocent freedom, and prudent demeanor. Thus the insiduous adversary leads first in∣to
<PB N="32" REF="017968_0030_0FA40A283AD4B6F8"/>partial compliances, and proceeds by making every succeeding step towards a captivating conformity, appear trivial, and of no consequence. By this means he de∣ludes the weak and unwary gradually to assimilate with the world, in language, in dress, in behaviour, in the superfluity and folly of its modes and fashions, in its cor∣rupt associations, and poisonous diversions, the natural tendency of all which is to entangle, darken, and debase the mind, and by alienating it from the light and life of Christ, to render it so unguarded as to make way for the introduction of unsuita∣ble connections, unhappy marriages, and, in brief, every kind of corruption and misery.</P>
<P>Be intreated therefore to beware, in time, of every approach towards a false liberty in the smallest matters, lest they prove introductions to greater. Guard strictly against every thing that would lead you to slight the tender touches and con∣victions of Divine Grace. Withdraw from alluring objects. To tamper at all with temptations, is to lose ground. It is vain to imagine you can go what length you please, and no further; that you may se∣curely temporize to a certain degree, or
<PB N="33" REF="017968_0031_0FA40A28E72B2D08"/>to just such a pleasing point of compliance as you are now tempted to, in behaviour, dress, and language, in order to appear genteel, candid, well bred, intelligent, polite, and to escape the disagreeable sensa∣tions of false shame, and the reflections of being stupid, mulish, and Quaker-like. This leads into liberty, but it is the liberty of the flesh, which is in reality the bondage of corruption.</P>
<P>Content not yourselves with a birth in the Society; but seek to secure a birthright in the Truth; without which the first will not avail you in the sight of God. Let the Spirit of Truth govern your inclinations; for whatever inclination you give your affection to, or passionately espouse, will prove your master. Indulge not an eager curiosity; it led Dinah to dishonour, and became the ruin of a city. Be cautious of your company; for that will affect both your manners and character, and eventual∣ly your future state. Humor not the car∣nal mind in dressing your mortal, change∣able, uncertain bodies, beyond what truth warrants, and decency requires; for more is not decoration, but disguise, which in the ultimate runs into deformity, and ad∣ministers offence to him who resisteth the
<PB N="34" REF="017968_0032_0FA40A2A485A1B78"/>proud, but increaseth grace to the humble. Flatter not the vanity of those who look for a plural address to themselves, whilst they treat their Maker in the singular num∣ber; as if Infinite Omnipotence was less, or less worthy, than the poor creature, whose very breath and being is not one moment at his own disposal.</P>
<P>I would beseech you, who are conscious that you have already been turned aside or stumbled at the cross, proceed no further, but fly to the great Redeemer, who so won∣derfully condescended from the heights of immortal Glory, took a painful humanity upon him, and bled for us, that he might bring us to celestial enjoyments, and for that end trod the most thorny paths, and left us the fairest example of humility, meekness, resignation, purity, and the most perfect plainness in every respect. Slight not the pattern he set, but follow it, for his blessed sake, and the security of your own happiness; shun all the gilded baits, the fair seeming caresses of a delusive world, in small matters as well as great, for they are all one in nature, tho' different in degree. Beware of the little foxes; they crop the tender buddings of the vine of life. Studiously avoid all friendships, flatteries,
<PB N="35" REF="017968_0033_0FA40A2A8E656108"/>formal visits, idle pastimes, and parties of pleasure, which in any measure lead out of the fear of God, divert you from daily attention upon him, and indispose you for humble walking with him.</P>
<P>Who, in their proper senses, would lose an eternal mansion in the heavenly Jerusa∣lem and paradise of God, for the paltry pleasures and silly satisfactions which must shortly end in everlasting bitterness? Shall the decking of these perishable bodies, the vanity of this uncertain life, the gratifica∣tion of sense, the lure of idle associates, or the apprehension of derision from persons ignorant of the virtue and power of truth, or unfaithful to it, have greater impres∣sion with you than the love of Him that made you, the favour of Him that sustains you, and a state of immutable blessedness with him in the realms of eternal light and glory? Make not so miserable a choice and preference, but practically adopt this apostolic advice, <Q>Be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by "the renewing of your minds, that ye "may prove what is that good and accept∣able, and perfect will God.</Q> Rom. xii.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="017968_0034_0FA40A2B624E7C68"/>
<P>To behold blooming youth renouncing those temptations and appearances of pre∣sent advantage, which captivate the gene∣rality of their cotemporaries, for the sake of that glorious truth which leads, under the cross, to the crown immortal, cannot fail of being acceptable to God and good men. "I rejoiced greatly," saith the good apostle, "that I found of thy children walking in Truth." "I have no great∣er joy than to hear that my children walk in Truth."</P>
