<HEAD><HI>The Publishers</HI> TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOU hast here presented to thy View, <HI>A GLIMPSE of GLORY</HI> from the heavenly <HI>Zion,</HI> so bright and lively, as nothing of humane Composure, yet extant, can equal. A Ray of such hea∣venly Fire, as, being received into an Heart affected with Eternal Objects, may prove a blest Mean to inflame it into a Divine Rapture of holy Longing, to see, and enjoy these unseen Things, which are here in so bright Colours represented. Whosoever will in Sincerity, and with At∣tention, peruse this small TREATISE, will be led in∣to such a delightful Contemplation of divine and heaven∣ly Things, as may, in a Manner, transport his very Soul into that heavenly <HI>Paradise</HI>; carry him along the beau∣tiful Banks of that pure River of the Water of Life; and represent to the Eyes of his Mind, that noble and glorious Company that stands about the LAMB, on Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> in white Robes, with Palms in their Hands, singing a new Song of Praise to JEHOVAH and the LAMB. Here shall he find the incomparable Beauties of that upper <HI>Paradise,</HI> and royal Palace of the King of Kings, described so brightly, in such high and lofty Expressions, as well suit these sublime and supernatural Objects; and yet withal so easy to be understood, that
<PB N="iv" REF="005510_0003_101848B56311F760"/>
the meanest Capacity, exercised in spiritual Things may apprehend the true Sense and Meaning of them. The holy Heart of the Author has been so much in Heaven, that from the End of the <HI>Prelude,</HI> to the Conclusion, he talks altogether like one in Heaven already, and as a Possessor of the GLORY he describes: Which is to be attentively noticed, for the better understanding of the Scope and Intent of the Discourse.</P>
<P>Besides the Description of Heaven, and the Glory which the Saints shall enjoy there; (which is the professed Sub∣ject of the Book:) There are not a few other excellent Subjects interspersed, and pretty largely handled. How sweetly doth he expatiate upon the Praises of Christ, the ever-blessed Redeemer? How lively doth he describe him, in his humbled State: his humble, laborious, sorrowful, yet holy Life; his painful, shameful and accursed Death; his infinite Love to his Chosen, that put him upon all that voluntary Humiliation and Suffering? With what Ravishment doth he admire the Difference of these Two, so distant Estates? In what sweet, lively and bright Ex∣pressions doth he declare the mutual Intercourse betwixt this glorious Redeemer, and his Chosen, especially in the upper HOUSE? It is also another great Aim of the Author, to display the Attributes of GOD, to his Glory: His Grace &amp; Mercy towards the Elect; his Sovereignty in his Works of Creation, Providence, and especially Election; his Truth &amp; Faithfulness, in making good all his Promises; his Unchangeableness, in his Purposes of Love and Grace to his own; his spotless Holiness and Justice, in punishing the Wicked. How lofty is he in describing the Sovereignty of God over his Creatures; either to create, or not create, elect, or pass by, as he pleased? How sweet, large &amp; ravishing is he, in holding forth the FREEDOM &amp; RICHES of REDEEMING GRACE! And how doth he exult and glory in the Unchangeableness of God, which secures the same to all Eternity? His wonderful Wisdom, in contriving the
<PB N="v" REF="005510_0003_101848B56311F760"/>
Saints Way to the Kingdom, thro' a Life of Sufferings, Afflictions, Poverty, Labours, Watchings, Sorrows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is pleasantly cleared up; and many mysterious Provi∣dences, relating thereunto, judiciously unfolded; which may serve much for Confirmation and Consolation to many poor drooping Believers. In describing the Holi∣ness and Justice of God, in the eternal Punishment of the Damned, he takes Occasion largely to delineate the mise∣rable Estate of the Ungodly: Nor is this improper for his Subject; for Contraries, set beside other, serve to in∣lighten one another. He sets forth their extreme Misery from the Greatness of their Torments; the great and in∣conceivable Loss they undergo, in their eternal Banish∣ment from the Presence of GOD and the LAMB; the Eternity, yet Justice of their Punishment: Which Justice he founds not on an arbitrary Constitution, but on the infinite Holiness, Justice and Sovereignty of God, against whom Sin is an infinite Offence, as striking against his very BEING and GLORY; and therefore deserving an Infinity of Punishment. The Blasphemies they con∣tinually belch forth against their Creator, for his puni∣shing them, tho' at the same Time their Consciences ap∣prove him just; and their horrid Inclination to fulfil their Lusts, tho' they cannot: All which he reckons their Pu∣nishment, as well as their Sin, for he was at no Loss to believe, <HI>That there is Sinning in Hell.</HI> And finally here is set forth the holy Triumph of the Righteous over the Wicked, Devils and Men, once their mortal Enemies; now laid low under the Soles of their Feet, and for ever banished their holy and happy Society. All which the Author describes in such a moving and pathetick Manner as might cause an Adamantine Heart to relent &amp; tremble, and to enquire, <HI>What must I do to be saved? How shall I escape the Wrath to come?</HI></P>
<P>And indeed, to bring Souls to such a serious Enquiry, and draw Hearts from this base, empty Earth, to an In∣quest after Heaven and Salvation, is the great Aim of the
<PB N="vi" REF="005510_0004_101848B8565A5210"/>
Author through all this Book. And hence, how pathe∣tick and vigorous is he, in his Inviting, Perswading, and Reasoning with the Unconverted (whom he commonly stiles <HI>Worldlings,</HI> because yet intangled in the Lusts of the World) to awaken them to a due Concern about hea∣venly Things, and wean their Hearts from earthly Vani∣ties; and by lessening their Esteem of them, to draw their Affections from them?</P>
<P>And that such as are perswaded, seriously to mind and apply themselves to this noble and necessary Study, may not want an Help at Hand, to discover to them the Good∣ness or Badness of their Estate: He hath added in the Conclusion of the Work a considerable Number of Excel∣lent Marks or Notes, whereby a Christian may discern his being in Christ, and whether he be in an heavenly Frame, or not; also by them a formal Hypocrite may be detected.</P>
<P>If there be any Flights of lofty and sublime Thought, here and there, that may offend the Censorious, 'tis de∣sired, That before they censure, they would first compare them with the Similitudes and Expressions of holy Scrip∣ture, and next with the Sentiments of sound Divines, gi∣ving some Grains of Allowance, on Consideration of the sublime and rapturous Way of writing, here used; and, 'tis confidently presumed, they'll find Nothing, but what is most agreeable to Truth, in this whole Tractate. There is a Sentence, Sect. 54, where he seems to make <HI>Sincerity</HI> the Condition of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> as Perfecti∣on of Obedience was the Condition of the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI>; which may perhaps offend some, who dislike the very Term <HI>Condition in a Covenant of Grace.</HI> But who∣soever considers how large and pathetick he is, in de∣scribing the free Grace of God, and ascribing all the Glo∣ry of Redemption and Salvation to Christ, and only to Christ, must be perswaded, he cannot mean, that the Be∣liever's Sincerity, or any Grate of his whatsoever, is the Condition of the New Covenant, in a legal Sense; for so
<PB N="vii" REF="005510_0004_101848B8565A5210"/>
Christ's Righteousness alone is the Condition of that Co∣venant. Nor can we charitably judge, That this Term, <HI>Condition,</HI> is in any worse or stricter Sense affirmed of <HI>Sincerity,</HI> which presupposeth and includes Faith, than it is of Faith it self, in the 32 <HI>Answer</HI> of our <HI>Larger Cate∣chism.</HI> It is clear then, That the Author takes <HI>Condition</HI> in a large Sense, for any Thing required or accepted in the new Covenant: And so it is true, That as <HI>Adam</HI>'s Works were to be perfect, in Order to Acceptation; so the Believer's good Works cannot be accepted without Sincerity; and will, thro' Christ, be accepted when Sin∣cere: Which must certainly be all the Author intends by <HI>Condition</HI> in that Place.</P>
<P>He is also pretty positive in his Opinion of the Reno∣vation of the Earth and visible Heavens, at the Day of Judgment; which he describes in bright and beautiful Emblems. The Opinion is indeed controverted among the Learned: But most of the Orthodox are of the Au∣thor's Side. Hence, when he is speaking of Things in that renewed State, after the Day of Judgment, none needs marvel, that he calls <HI>Sun, Moon</HI> and <HI>Stars everlasting,</HI> and the Earth an <HI>eternal Monument,</HI> as in Sect. 43; Or, stum∣ble at any such uncommon Expressions: For he speaks as one beyond Time in Eternity.</P>
<P>Moreover, the intelligent and observing Reader will here find such a surprising Variety of the most profound Gospel-Mysteries, interwoven in such a beautiful and art∣ful Contexture, as will every where entertain his Under∣standing, with an uncommon Delight.</P>
<P>'Tis hoped, none will desiderate Method, or quarrel the Want thereof as a Defect; if it be but reminded, That devotional Books, amongst which this may justly claim a chief Room, are not usually astricted to the Rules of Art and <HI>Logical</HI> Method: It being the Design of such Writers, not so much to please the Fancy, or entertain the Understanding with an orderly Ranging &amp; Methodi∣zing of Things, as to quicken and inflame the Affections
<PB N="viii" REF="005510_0005_101848BC60F3D250"/>
with divine and sublime Meditations: Where, not a Gingle of empty Eloquence fills the Ear; but heavenly and supernatural Objects, brought down, as it were, from the eternal World of Spirits, and made familiar to the Understanding, move and engage the Heart, and ele∣vate the Soul to follow hard after these only worthy and substantial Delights. And besides, the intelligent Reader will find upon due Perusal, that 'tis not a meer rude Heap of indigested Matter; but that there is really a comely Order observed, in the Disposing of the Thoughts herein contained, which will sufficiently gratifie the Under∣standing, while the incomparable Matter melts and in∣flames the Affections.</P>
<P>As for the Titles of the Sections, the Publishers were not assured, whether they were added by the Author himself, or by some other Hand: Nay, they did not want Ground of Suspicion, both from the Difference of Expression, and sometimes from the Unsuitableness to the Matter, that some less skilful Person had added them. Yet having no Copies save one (except the Letters, and Saint's Song, whereof we found several Copies) to com∣pare, 'twas tho't safest to retain them, lest any Thing might be desiderate that was in the Manuscript: And the judicious Reader is left to his Choice, whether to read on the Matter, without Regard to these Titles, or otherwise; for it must be owned, That, considering the Variety of heavenly Purposes, sometimes comprized in one of these Paragraphs, 'tis no easie Matter for any Man to devise an apposite Title, to express the Substance of the Matter therein contained.</P>
<P>There is no Doubt, but the Reader, by this Time, will be longing for some Account of the Author: And it were to be wished, that a true and genuine Relation of the Life of that pious Youth could have been recovered, in or∣der further to oblige the Publick; which had it been pra∣cticable, no Pains would have been spared to transmit it: And without all Doubt, such a Life would have been a
<PB N="ix" REF="005510_0005_101848BC60F3D250"/>
rare and excellent Draught, worthy of Christian Imitation. He was the Son of a godly Father, Minister of the Gos∣pel at <HI>Tondergirth</HI> in <HI>Annandole</HI>; concerning whom there is related this remarkable Passage. When the LORD had taken away from him his beloved Wife, the Desire of his Eyes, he spent the whole ensuing Night in Prayer and Medication in his Garden. One of the Elders of the Parish coming next Morning to visit him, and condoling his Want of Rest by Reason of the Dispensation so lately befal∣len him, he replied thus, or to this Effect: <Q>I declare I have not all this Night had one Thought concerning the Death of my Spouse; I have been so wholly taken up with the Meditation of heavenly Things. I have been this Night upon the Banks of <HI>Ulai,</HI> plucking an Apple here and there.</Q> This Passage plainly shews what a heavenly Soul this holy Man hath been; and how plentifully this gracious Youth, his Son, hath been blessed with the same Spirit, is abundantly evident from the ensu∣ing Treatise. His Brother Mr. <HI>John Welwood</HI> was a Per∣son well known to many, and his Memory still favory to all that knew him, for his Holiness, Diligence in the La∣bours of the Ministry, amidst many Perils from Bloody Persecutors and false Brethren; his undaunted Zeal and Courage in the Cause of Christ, tho' under a very weak and sickly Constitution of Body. What a Life of Faith he lived in these Perillous Times, is evident from several Letters of his, written to his Godly Acquaintances, and Friends, yet extant in Manuscript. And as he excelled in the Grace of Faith, so this holy Youth, the Author, seems to have peculiarly abounded in that of Love, as will be abundantly manifest from the whole of this heavenly Tra∣ctate. And how zealous he was for the royal Prerogatives of his lovely Redeemer, usurped by wicked Rulers; and the public Concerns of His House and Glory; may be gathered from several Passages in this Treatise, tho' the Nature of the Subject did not permit him to enlarge much this Way. It appears plainly, from his Letters annexed
<PB N="x" REF="005510_0006_101848BE23DD84C0"/>
to this Treatise, that he designed to have served the Lord Christ in the Work of the Ministry, if it had pleased the Lord to have continued his Abode here below: But the good Lord was pleased early to transport him from the Wilderness of Earth to the Paradise of Glory; and to accept the Will, in that Matter, for the Deed, as him∣self speaketh. He died at <HI>London,</HI> in Time of our late Per∣secution, as would seem, of a Consumption; under which Affliction, how much he profited and grew in Grace, ap∣pears also evidently from the same Letters. He conclu∣ded his holy and happy, tho' short, Life, with the swee∣test Assurance of obtaining that Coelestial Blessedness, he here describes, and quietly slept in the Lord. And tho' the rest of the History of his Life cannot here be com∣mitted to Writing, (as was design'd, if certain Informa∣tion could have been obtained) yet there is here a ge∣nuine Transcript of it to be read; for no doubt he en∣deavour'd to live what he wrote, and such a lasting Monu∣ment erected to the Glory of his Redeemer, as will also serve to transmit his Memory embalmed to Posterity, without needing an Elogium from any other Hand.</P>
<P>To conclude, the Treatise it self will, upon due Pe∣rusal, so approve it self to every gracious Heart, by its heavenly and divine Strain; the noble Design it drives, namely to exalt Christ, and allure Souls to him, by its most sweet and taking Composure; its Stile being both lofty, as to the Subject, and condescending to the most I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>literate; and finally by the sweet Discoveries it makes of that holy City, the heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the Hope, Rest and Joy of all the Saints: The Treatise, I say, will so recommend it self, as that it shall need no Ivy to be hung out to invite the Passenger; and will only need to be known, to recommend it sufficiently to every de∣vout Soul.</P>
<P>That the Almighty Lord, with whom is the Residue of the Spirit, and who only can command the Blessing, may make this TREATISE a blessed Mean, in the Hand
<PB N="xi" REF="005510_0006_101848BE23DD84C0"/>
of his holy Spirit, to build up and comfort Believers, to quicken them to Heavenly-mindedness, and draw them from the too eager Love of this Earth; and awaken, allure and draw Sinners to JESUS CHRIST, charmed and ravished with the unspeakable Glory of the great Reward, here described, which He hath promised to all them that turn from Iniquity, and sincerely love Him; is the earnest Desire of the Publishers.</P>

<HEAD>A Glimpse of Glory: OR, A Gospel-Discovery of EMMAUEL's Land. The PRELUDE.</HEAD>
<P>ROUSE thee, O my Soul, from this base and contagious Earth: Why should lower Thoughts, and base Aims possess thee thus? What hast thou here, that may draw thee a∣side from the Centre of thy Felicity, but for one Moment? If this World, in her rosy and youthful Constitution, be very Vanity and Vexation of Spirit; what must there be now in her sad and withered State? If in her Smiles, she be not worth the regarding; what Folly is it, to court a frowning Nothing?</P>
<P N="2">2. Is it Time, O my Soul, to place one Beam of thy Affection upon such a filly, base Dunghill, so as to give it an affectionate Look? Trample it under thy Feet: Car∣ry thy self after the Manner of these, who expect the Kingdom. GOD hath formed thee of such a capacious Constitution as nothing can satisfy thee below his infinite SELF; and shouldst thou be confined, in thy Outgoings, within the Limits of this lower, smoky Region? Mount up swiftly, far above the Sun, Moon and Stars, beyond the Borders of this narrow Vault, where thou mayest sweetly bathe thy self, in these Oceans of Joys and Felicity, that know neither Brim nor Bottom: Thou art not to waste away thy Conceptions on Things to Day in their Vigour, and to Morrow they are not: Shadows, empty Nothings, Night-dreams &amp; Vanities, insufficient Objects for the Fa∣culties of such a noble Being, to fix upon. Art thou not
<PB N="16" REF="005510_0009_101848C7F92424B0"/>
beginning to consider of a more enduring Substance? The Kingdom that cannot be shaken, <HI>Emmanuel</HI>'s glorious, stately and ever flourishing Land, the smiling, rosy Place where his Servants do incessantly serve him, and see his Face eternally, without a Cloud; where our all-lovely WELBELOVED doth corporally dwell, and shall for ever take up his eternal Abode; a fruitful, fragrant, beautiful, delightsom Soil, overflowing with the true and real <HI>Nectar</HI> and <HI>Ambrosia</HI>; a Garden of Delights, a Para∣dise of Pleasures, planted at the Beginning by the Almigh∣ty's own Right-hand, whereon he hath manifested, in an high &amp; transcendent Manner, the incomprehensible Glo∣ry of his Power, Love and Goodness, wonderfully, above what Eye hath seen, Ear hath heard, or the Mind of Man, within the Tents of Mortality, considered: What a won∣derful Frame is this! O the alluring Objects up above! The first Thought whereof set all on a Flame: O what Desires! O what Longings! When shall Mortality be swallowed up of Life, Death of Victory, Time of Eternity, Miseries of Blessedness, Sorrows of Joys, Pains of Pleasures, painted Enjoyments &amp; Delights of his Love &amp; eternal Sweetness?</P>
<P N="3">3. All Creatures are ever in Action, especially these of the highest and most noble Rank, which must neces∣sarily have some Object or other, to fix their Outgoings upon: The most excellent and sublime are then to be chosen; and what more excellent, than what will fill all the Powers and Faculties of blessed Men and Angels throughout all Eternity?</P>
<P N="4">4. To take a View of the higher <HI>Canaan,</HI> is neither Cu∣riosity nor Audacity, but a necessary Duty, lying upon all, who are travelling thither: The Advantages of such a noble Study cannot be told, nay, nor conceived, but by the Exercised therein.</P>
<P N="5">5. According to the Knowledge, so are the Affections, both as to Kind and Degree: What we know not, that we cannot love; &amp; what we behold lovely, we cannot but love it. Seraphick Spirits, no Wonder you are ofttimes
<PB N="17" REF="005510_0009_101848C7F92424B0"/>
ravished from your selves! Ah silly Worldlings, you cannot but have a drooping Life of it; since you know nothing but Earth: Had you an half Glimpse of the more enduring Substance of the ever-flourishing, never-fading Glory, how should you be in an unexperienced Frame of Joy and Admiration! How should you disdain all the lesser Beauties on this Side of Time! But ah! you never saw the enduring Glory; and what Wonder you are as you are?</P>
<P N="6">6. Mortality hath no greater Joy, than the solid Hope of Glory; the Sweetness, arising from the solid Hope of so great Things, fills the Soul with wonderful Ravishments, and perfumes the lowest of earthly Enjoyments: Surpas∣sing Joys to my Soul: These temporal Things, my LORD bestows upon me, are as Pledges of the fair Inhe∣ritance. And are not all visible Things as so many Em∣blems of the Invisible? Wordlings, you are Fools, to i∣magine, We have a sad &amp; melancholy Life: None live but we; tho' we may be said to be, as to this Life, <HI>Of all Men the most miserable</HI>; 'tis only as to the Bulk of Externals: You know not our Joys, nor the Manner of our Enjoyments; neither can ye know them.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Of Necessity we must search after another Life, than this evan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing Vapour.</HI></P>
<P>May not the Vanity and Vexation of Spirit, in the Pur∣suit of every sublunary Enjoyment, force us to the search∣ing after another Life? If we search not for the Glory to come, then let us search after nothing at all. Sirs, what Madness, to notice this Earth, unless in Order to Eter∣nity? Do you not clearly see all your temporary Enjoy∣ments die in the Birth? Are not the glistering Shews of Men on this Stage of the World, like the Appearance of Aerial Things in the Clouds? Here are Armies engaging one another, there are Ships under Sail, yonder are Men riding in the Equipage of Kings, Queens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> other wheres are Towns, Castle, Rivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All appear real to the

<P N="8">8. <HI>The small Study of Glory proves us, in a great Part, carnal.</HI></P>
<P>Is it not evident, we have our Eyes too much upon Shadows, and that we divide our Looks betwixt Heaven and Earth; since our Joys are more carnal than spiritual, and our Longings and Desires run so little heaven-ward? Ah, our Love to the only WELBELOVED, is not un∣like that that every Nation carries to their God; else we would be often crying out, Is not my Welbeloved gone unto another Country? and shall not my Heart &amp; Love for ever dwell there, and only there? Sit I down here, When he hath removed himself to another Place? Can there be any Thing desirable where he is not? O, all ye Beauties of this lower World, what are you to me, if my LORD be absent ? Let me pass through all possible Diffi∣culties, even through ten thousand Oceans of burning Fire and Brimstone; providing I land at last, on that ten thou∣sand times happy Place, where he for ever dwells; that these Arms may be blessed in embracing, these Eyes in e∣ternal beholding, and all my Faculties may be filled with his eternally ravishing Sweetness. Oh, when shall I behold thy Countenance! When shall I hear thy Voice! When shall I stand amongst these happy, happy, happy Ones, who stand in the immediate Presence of thy all-glorious Majesty, and have the naked, immediate and clear Vision of thine eternally ravishing Godhead; Ah, how is it I think of any Thing, but Heaven? Why are we not ever in an impatient Longing, to be in his everlasting Embraces? Know we what it is, to take him for our only WELBE∣LOVED? Is not every Sounding of his very Name, me∣lodious Harmony in our Ears? Doth not every Hearing or Reading of him, affect us with a wonderful Sweetness?
<PB N="19" REF="005510_0010_101848CAC45E9B48"/>
Do not the Tho'ts of our being in his naked Embraces ere long, fill us with an Extasy of Joy? Are we not of∣ten challenging Years, Months and Days, that they suc∣ceed so leasurely one another; and contending with Sun, Moon and Stars, that they run their Course so slowly; looking upon every Hour, as an Age, in his Absence; and Death as of a sweet and lovely Countenance, since it opens us a Passage to the full Enjoyment of him; and the Marrow of all Creature-Excellency, as a Mass of Deformity, if it should eclipse for a Moment, the sweet Enjoyment of his Alsufficient Self?</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Students of Glory, overlook the Difficulties and Vex∣ations of Time.</HI></P>
<P>Sweet, sweet is the Way to my blessed Home! Can the Way be thought tedious, that leadeth to such bound∣less Joy? O the goodly Country I behold lying at the End of my Race!

The Affairs of Time move not as such. O what Allurements! Who can see, and not run? O thy violent, sweet, attractive Vertue! How strongly and quickly dost thou draw thy Members up to Heaven after thee! See I not thee, O WELBELOVED, standing with the massie Crown of Glory in thy Hand, crying, Run, and have it? And shall I not run, even run with Patience and chearfully unto the Death? How chearfully did my LORD go up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to purchase the Crown for

me! a Crown to be purchased thro' a World of Sor∣rows and Difficulties! What am I doing? Why stand I thus? All is purchased already, and the Word is to me, <HI>ENTER and POSSESS.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>The Study of Glory is so alluring, that the more we study, the more we love to study it.</HI></P>
<P>Had we a Discovery of the only excellent Things, how difficult would it prove, to get our Thoughts plucked off them? Most lovely Things, seen in their Loveliness, captivate the Affections most▪ and consequently determine the Tho'ts: Do we not think most upon what we love most? Worldlings I appeal to your Consciences, if your Tho'ts run not out most upon earthly Things: Why? You know them only, and esteem them most: But, had you a View of the real World, the Outgoings of your Soul would run in an higher Orb. Had we the Impressions of Glory on our Spirits, lower Objects should not easily draw down our Tho'ts, or turn them aside; yea, our higher Powers should be so strongly affected, as that the lower Powers should be regulated even in Sleep; our I∣maginations would be composing and dividing the Ideas of the Life to come, they received, according to their Natures, from the higher Faculties. How oft would we be, in our Dreams, walking up and down the Streets of the gol∣den City, the Beds of Lilies and Roses, in the higher Pa∣radise of Glory, the Banks of that <HI>River of Water of Life</HI>? Days-Thoughts have Influence upon Night-Dreams: the Disposition of the Fancy follows that of the Mind. Ah, ye Sons of Men, what Wonder your Fancy run out after so foolish a Manner! The Strength of your sublime Powers is wasted on Dunghil-concernments, your Tho'ts are full of Earth, and all your lower Powers are full of it also.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Creatures are only to be esteemed more or less ex∣cellent, according to their Knowledge; it being the</HI> primum Mobile <HI>of all other Endowments.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="005510_0011_101848CC9D3EF428"/>Creatures are Excellent according to their Knowledge: Let Beasts imagine, that the Scenical Garbs of Riches, and Titular Honours, add any Thing real to Men: It is only Knowledge that differenceth; without it a Man is but a Beast; and with it, in its elevated Pitch, he is a glorified and immortal Creature: <HI>This is Life Eternal, That they might know thee, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI> And is not the Knowledge more Noble, ac∣cording to the Excellency of the Objects, they being taken up congruously? O then, are they not seraphick Creatures, whose Minds are set upon the only Excellent Things? had we a sight of that surpassing Glory, how would our Minds be elevated wonderfully above this base Dung∣hill? How should we look down upon the greatest Things of Earth, as inconsiderable Trifles, far below our sublime Spirits? how should we trample on Crowns and Sceptres, yea, many Worlds tho' existent, when elevated, <HI>on our high Places, clothed with the Sun, and having the Moon under our Feet?</HI> How should we laugh at silly Earth-Worms, crawling over one another with great Trouble and Vexa∣tion; Ah Childish Spirits! are you contending and wa∣sting your Inch of Time on Trifles and shining Nothings? what is the Gain, when all your Projects are accomplished? Heirs of Glory, no wonder, you are termed by Truth it self, <HI>the Excellent Ones of the Earth</HI>; none of excellent and generous Spirits, but you. The Opinions of blind Worldlings concerning you is of no Value; the Excel∣lency, and Baseness of Mankind is not yet laid open: Mortality, and its black Retinue, obscure all: A little Patience, and the Almighty shall unmask the whole Race of Mankind.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>A clear View of so great Rewards, heartens to all Duties.</HI></P>
<P>The clear Sight of the great Recompense of Reward, makes the Creature chearful in Duty; Am I so slow in my Race, and the matchless Inheritance at the Stake? Cries not my Lord unto me, <HI>Be thou faithful unto the Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life?</HI> Is there
<PB N="22" REF="005510_0012_101848D0106DE308"/>
such a necessary Connection betwixt a Momentary Fight, and an Everlasting Triumph? O the Disproportation! who would not fight? who would not wrestle? O let me run to the Death.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>The better we are versed in the Study of Heaven, the more we are fitted for it.</HI></P>
<P>Is not Grace young Glory? and the Forethoughts of Heaven, a Preparation for Heaven? even as black Nature is a Preparation for Hell, the height and Perfection of Wickedness: A Sutableness is congruous betwixt the Creature and its Condition. High Spirits are not for base, low Things; as creeping Spirits are not for high. What Things in Heaven can delight a carnal Soul? Earth, Earth, and only Earth, is its known Object: Give him Earth, and he desires no more. There is Congruity, and Discongruity betwixt the Capacity and Object: Beasts have no uptak∣ing of intellectual Things; neither carnal Men (termed Beasts in Scripture) of the Things of GOD. O sweet! How do the Saints smell of Glory, before they enter in? May they not say, <HI>Whither I go, I know, and the Way I know?</HI> Were I ignorant of the World I remove for ever into, could I be thus in so joyful a Frame? My Soul is going to the Place, where my Heart is already. <HI>I know in whom I have believed,</HI> and what is his Reward, <HI>O Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Noble Uptakings of Glory, make us in Part Posses∣sors of Heaven and Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Serious Meditating on Heaven, renders us, in some Man∣ner, Possessors thereof: <HI>Our Conversation is in Heaven,</HI> saith the Apostle; and again, <HI>You are come</HI> (not to the Mount visible) <HI>unto Mount</HI> Zion, <HI>and to the City of the living God.</HI> Converse and Presence is only by Benefit of the Mind; were we dwelling in Heaven by Faith, we might be said to be in Heaven, before we were there; or rather Heaven would come down unto our Souls; Christ
<PB N="23" REF="005510_0012_101848D0106DE308"/>
and all his glorious Train would be intimate unto us. O then! we might say, my Company is sweet, My Fellow∣ship glorious: He, whose Presence enlightens, enlivens and beautifies Heaven, is ever present with me: <HI>I have set the LORD always before me, because he is at my Right-Hand, I shall not be moved. A Bundle of Myrrhe is my Welbeloved unto me, He shall ly all Night betwixt my Breasts.</HI> O passing Joys and Sweetness! the Source of all Joys and Sweetness doth possess my Heart. Blinded Worldlings, you see but the outward Garb of Saints; saw you what were within, you could not but admire their Happiness: <HI>The King's Daughter is all glorious within.</HI> Saw you your own selves, in your own genuine Colours, ye would run from yourselves, if it were pos∣sible: Hell lodgeth within you, and you know it not; but anon, when the Conscience is awak'ned, ye shall know it, to your dreadful Experience.</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>Heaven is the proper Place, where all Excellency dwells: Should we not then dwell mentally there?</HI></P>
<P>As the Fields are most pleasant, fertile and beautiful, which lie nearest the perpendicular Rays of the Sun; so the more nearly we approach the <HI>Sun of Righteousness,</HI> the more vigorous and lively shall our Condition be: How shall we bloom and flourish <HI>like a Tree planted by the Rivers of Waters</HI>? O how beautiful shall we become in the Eyes of God, Angels, and Saints! Worldlings, you live in a cold Climate: Can any Thing befal you, ex∣cept Withering and Decay? Come hither, this is the Sunny-side of the World; were ye here, ye could not but cry out, <HI>The Lines are fallen to me in pleasant Places; yea, I have a goodly Heritage.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. <HI>We are allowed to have our Mind no where else, but in Heaven, that only being free of the Contagion of Sin.</HI></P>
<P>To have the Mind in Heaven, is safe; to let it fall down to Earth, is most dangerous: Mostly from this do <HI>Satan,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="005510_0013_101848D31A589160"/>
the World, &amp; our vile Hearts get such Advantage against us: This is the Place where Satan dominiers; to dwell here, implies a Submission to the Sceptre of his Govern∣ment. No Wonder so many Mischiefs befal Earth-worms. Heaven is the Saints proper Soil: If ye be wise, O Citi∣zens of the New <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> range not without the Bor∣ders of your Kingdom, lest some Evil befal you.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>According to the Excellency of our Knowledge, accor∣dingly is the Sphere of our Activity; and consequently our Fitness for doing great Things for our LORD's Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Who are most accomplished for the greatest Actions and Sufferings for Christ? Who, but these who are most above? If the Study of humane Sciences renders a Man in some Measure excellent, What will the Study of this Hyperphysical Science do? All other Sciences are subor∣dinate to this; it being a practick Science, directing and illuminating our Minds, in the right and solid Uptaking of all Things. Know much of GOD, and know much of all Things.</P>
<P N="18">18. <HI>What we know and affect, that we are; if Earth, we are earthly; if Heaven, we are heavenly.</HI></P>
<P>The Difference betwixt Saints and all Wordlings, lies much here; as the Man is, so are his Thoughts. Do the Faculties of thy Soul run most out on Heaven and Glo∣ry? Doth Heaven more affect thee than Earth? Is't the ordinary Frame of thy Spirit? O the Blessedness of thy Condition! little canst thou conceive what thou art com∣ing to. But, doth thy Mind run most upon Earth? is it the most delightsom Object? &amp; is Heaven a fram'd and strange-like Subject to meditate upon? Is that the or∣dinary Harmony of thy Spirit? O thy dreadful Condi∣tion! who can conceive it? But thou shalt know it ere long.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="005510_0013_101848D31A589160"/>And how sweetly &amp; cordially are we invited to come up from this base Earth, and partake of that noble Fellow∣ship with the Father and the Son?

<P N="19">19. <HI>It is dangerous to take a superficial View of Glory, and no more: We are to search, &amp; die searching; since Earth hath so strange a Power upon Creatures composed of Earth.</HI></P>
<P>O Heirs of this never-fading Glory, need we speak of the Things you have a View of, far above all our Ex∣pressions! See you not what is inexpressible? are you not ravished with the Goodness of your Lot? have you not been often upon the <HI>Top of Mount</HI> Pisgah, viewing the higher and lower World; the vast Difference betwixt the Childrens Inheritance, and that of the Bastards? have ye not received a Taste of the delicious Fruits that grow on <HI>the Tree of Life</HI>? have ye not received in your Souls, some Sparkles of that heavenly Joy and Love? have you not experimentally seen the Nothingness and Vanity of all created Enjoyments? How is it then; that so many of you are so base and carnal in your Deportment, as it is difficult to discern betwixt your Walk, and that of the Sons of the Earth? What! back to the Earth again, after you have re∣ceived so high an Elevation? You somewhat resemble the fallen Angels. Sirs (if it be so, that you are fallen in∣deed) it is an Hundred to One, if ever you approach so

near Heaven, on this Side of Time: Apostasy, in the smal∣lest Degree, is very dreadful. Be it so, you cannot totally and finally become Earth again; yet, is it not sad, ne∣ver to come near to the first Attainments? as it mostly falls out in fallen Saints: Even <HI>David</HI>'s last Ways were below his first. But however, Can ye endure so to dis∣grace your Lord's Glory, before the Eyes of vile World∣lings, who esteem Heaven a well invented <HI>Chimera</HI>? Can you feed their Atheism? And dare you shake the Faith of weak ones, and be the sad Occasion of many's going back at the Birth? Either walk in an heavenly Manner, or pro∣fess no Religion at all: If your Converse be like that of Dunghil-wretches, wherein do ye glorify GOD more than they? Yea, you do dishonour him more a Thousand Stages. Christians, can you forget your sweet Country, in this me∣lancholy Wilderness; is not Death at your Hand? Our Time is short, for making ready for Eternity; ere we get a Sight of the vain World, Death will assault us. What is Time, but a Preparation for Eternity? Were there not Connexion betwixt these two, verily, Time were of no Consideration: Have we lost the real Use of our Senses? Do not all we see, or hear, invite us to go up, and leave this despicable World? Every earthly Enjoyment hath Vanity written upon it; every Thing here hath a frow∣ning Countenance: Are we not <HI>looking for a City whose Builder and Maker is God?</HI> Let us be perswaded of the Truth of so great Things; let us <HI>embrace the Promises, and confess, we are Strangers and Pilgrims on Earth,</HI> that the Natives of this World may perceive <HI>we seek a Coun∣try.</HI> Cry out, Sirs, <HI>Adieu,</HI> you guilded Enjoyments, ab∣stracted from the Life of all Enjoyments, ah glistering Nothings! what are you all to me! What to One who hath sound the enduring Substance? Welcome, a Thou∣sand Times Welcome, eternal Joys, substantial Pleasures, enduring Comforts. Welcome Enjoyment of God, in any Measure, tho' thro' a Glass. Mount up, O my Soul, on the Seraphick Wings of heavenly Meditation:

<HI>Tho' thou hast lien among the Pots, yet shalt thou be as the Wings of a Dove, covered with Silver, and her Feathers with yellow Gold.</HI> Let not a low Sight content thee, never rest, until thou be over the Borders of Time, where thou shalt be at Rest, and free of Trouble: Here is nothing but <HI>Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. <HI>Scripture gives us a Discovery of Things beyond Time.</HI></P>
<P>By a spiritual Uptaking of the Scriptures, in their own genuine Sense, we might attain unto the sublime Know∣ledge of excellent Things: They are wisest, who are best studied in them: Faith is an Instrument, whereby the Soul takes up aright the Things contained therein. And doth not every Page smell of Heaven and Glory? The Glory of God, and intellectual Creatures, and everlasting Enjoyment of him, is the Subject and Scope of all. Nay, this great Volume of this visible All, demonstrates some∣what invisible, of a far higher Nature: <HI>The Heavens de∣clare the Glory of God: The invisible Things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the Things which are made.</HI> How many Draughts and Emblems of Glory may we behold, in the glorious Fabrick of Heaven and Earth; how doth the Spirit set before our Eyes, that inconceivable Glory to come, in Types and borrowed Terms, drawn from the Glories of this lower Region? Verily, they have the Advantage of others, who have Spirit and Opportunity, for searching into the admirable Works of God's Creation: For, such is the Nature of Things visible, that they lead us to these that are invisible.</P>
<P N="21">21. <HI>Glory is not to be considered after a Philosophical Manner, being altogether supernatural.</HI></P>
<P>To enquire metaphysically into the Nature of this ex∣cellent Glory, is not our Intention: We desire not to speak other Things, than what is written. Subtil Inqui∣ties are cold, having small Influence on the Affections,
<PB N="28" REF="005510_0015_101848D880541F28"/>
the Inflaming of which is our Aim. A Gospel View of Glory, in a Scripture Dialect, is our Design. That the Scrip∣ture termeth Heaven, a <HI>City</HI>; and again, a <HI>Bride,</HI> shews that all Emblems come wonderfully short, in representing such inconceivable Things; and therefore Discourses thereof are not to be examined, according to vulgar Rules. Glory may be understood, either <HI>formally,</HI> or <HI>subjective∣ly,</HI> which is the supernatural Elevation of the Creature; or <HI>objectively,</HI> which is the Manifestation of GOD to the Creature: The Glory then to be revealed, is a supernatu∣ral Perfection, and that in Kind. Natural Wisdom, never so intense, is not Glory: The Splendor of the Sun, tho' a thousand Stages gradually augmented above what it is, is still but natural Glory, and not a supernatural Elevati∣on. Every Thing is perfect, beautiful, excellent or glo∣rious (which Terms express the same) in its own Kind; but in Heaven, are all supernaturally excellent, as being elevated far above the Reach of their natural Beings.</P>
<P N="22">22. <HI>All Creatures from the highest to the lowest, are passively capable of supernatural Elevation.</HI></P>
<P>What baser Things than Dust? and yet that's admitted within the New <HI>Jerusalem</HI>: Yet may intellectual Beings be said (Gr. <HI>kat' exochen,</HI> i. e. <HI>by way of Eminence</HI>) to be only capable of Glory: And then we may say, <HI>Glory is the highest Elevation (actual) of a Creature, in its Being, Faculties, Vertues, Operations and Relations, by which it is enabled to enjoy God to the full.</HI></P>
<P N="23">23. <HI>Nothing leads us so excellently to the Knowledge of Glory, as Grace its Forerunner.</HI></P>
<P>Grace being an Endowment above the Strength of Na∣ture, what is it else, but <HI>young Glory</HI>? For that the Know∣lege of the one will lead us by the Hand unto the Know∣lege of the other: As Glory is Grace in the Bloom and fullest Vigour, so Grace is Glory in the Bud &amp; first Spring∣ing; the one is Holiness begun, the other Holiness per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ec∣ted;

the one is the <HI>Beholding of God darkly, as thro' a Glass, the</HI> other <HI>Beholding him Face to Face.</HI> Christians, are you considering, that in Part you are glorified already? Tho' it be small, <HI>like a Grain of Mustard-seed,</HI> and ob∣scured by Corruption and Mortality; a little Patience, and you shall see it grow out wonderfully in all Dimen∣sions, and flourish, and bloom, and be fruitful and fra∣grant through never-ending Ages. You have tasted that the Lord is good; you shall swim, ere long, in the Oce∣ans of Goodness: You have had his amiable Countenance lifted up upon you; a little hence shall ye for ever dwell under the Noon-Day Rays of his ravishing Face: Some Drops of celestial Joy have fallen into your Hearts, unto Ravishment; you shall enter into the Ocean it self ere long: You are walking with the Lamb, in the Days of your Pilgrimage; <HI>you shall follow Him</HI> anon <HI>whitherso∣ever he goes.</HI> May ye not then attain to some Conception of Glory? the Tree may be known by its Seed; the di∣rect Rays, by the reflex. As for you, Worldlings, who know not what it is to have Communion with GOD the very natural Consideration of such dazling Glory, may rouse up your Senses, and cause you to understand what you never heretofore considered.</P>
<P N="24">24. <HI>Saints get some Discoveries more evident, than through a Glass, which may be termed Glimpses of Glory.</HI></P>
<P>The Saints, on this Side of Time, are not seldom more than Victors; they have Sights above that of Faith: O the Sights, O the Sweetness, O the Ravishments, more like those of Overcomers, than Fighters, which the Saints experience! Why may we not then attain to some Appre∣hensions of the Glory above? may not the Experience of our selves and others lead us into the Discovery of won∣derful Things? No Doubt, the <HI>New Creation</HI> is a super∣natural Elevation, which we shall never be able to attain unto, through the ordinary and connatural Influencing of the Spirit on our congenite Faculties; His marvellous

Light is of another Nature, than that common Light which he communicateth <HI>to every one that cometh into the World.</HI> Natural Excellency, never so gradually perfected, is still natural; gradual Difference changeth not the Kind. Join all common Graces of Reprobates together, could they make up a Saving or Supernatural? Many Carnals make not a Heavenly; many material Excellencies, make not up a Spiritual: Grace is a heavenly, new Principle infused, not the perfecting of what hath been already, in the Worldling. O Sirs, beware of a Beguile here: The intense natural Knowledge of Divine Mysteries, with the Overflowings of Love and Joy arising there from, may dazle our own Eyes, and the Eyes of the Spectators. Look that you have Heaven indeed within you, else you can∣not enter there. O to be <HI>Partakers of the Divine Nature!</HI> O for the Noble <HI>Mind of Christ</HI>! O to be <HI>transformed in the Spirit of our Minds!

Look well to it, let it not be choked with Cares, Anxieties &amp; Vanities; Tho' the Beginning appears small and inconsiderable, the End will be wonderfully glorious and excellent: The Wonders to be manifested upon thee, will be the Perfection of what thou hast got already: <HI>If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the Dead be in you, He shall also quicken your mortal Bodies, by the Spirit that dwelleth in you.</HI></P>

<L>Into the new Creation, whose bright Glory</L>

<HEAD><HI>A Glimpse of Glory:</HI> OR, A Gospel-Discovery of EMMANUEL's Land.</HEAD>
<P>THOU Glory and Beauty of the higher Pa∣radise, fulfil thy Promise upon me, in let∣ting me see Thee in thy Beauty, and <HI>that Land that is very far off.</HI> A Discovery of thine Excellency, a Taste of thy Sweet∣ness, should cause me to overlook all sublunary Things, should enable my Glory to proclaim thine aloud before the Sons of Men. Let thy Strength appear in Weak∣ness: Thou can'st perfect Glory and Praise by Babes, and Nothings; get thy self Glory, and I have all I can desire.</P>
<P N="2">2. All Joys! Am not I exalted on the high Places of the Earth? Wonderful! what strange Things are these? <HI>What hath God done</HI>? Shall I write, or shall I not? What avails <HI>Earth's Idiom</HI> here, which falleth short in the full Expression of earthly Things? Shall I not debase my LORD's Glory, if I endeavour to represent it by the low, base and childish Expressions of <HI>Earth's Idiom</HI>: But since our condescending LORD is pleased, in borrowed Terms, to express these inexpressible Enjoyments, which <HI>neither Eye hath seen, nor Ear hath heard, or the Heart of Man conceived,</HI> we will follow his Footsteps; being certain, tho' our Expressions reach not the Brim of that Ocean, yet they may surpass most Men's Esteem of it. May we not then, in borrowed Speeches and dark Em∣blems,
<PB N="34" REF="005510_0018_101848E2B614C5B8"/>
delineate <HI>the Glory of his Kingdom,</HI> the Excellency of his Person, &amp; <HI>the Riches of his Inheritance in the Saints in Light, until we come unto the Fulness of the Stature of Christ:</HI> When we shall <HI>see</HI> and express <HI>Him, as He is.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Soul must be elevated on the Wings of heavenly Meditation, before it get a Sight of the promised Land.</HI></P>
<P>Now, my Soul, thou art got up to the Top of this sublime and majestick Mountain overlooking the celestial <HI>Canaan.</HI> Ah, my Senses are not celestial! Yet do the Things I see and hear, fill me with <HI>Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory</HI>: I cannot tell what my Faculties are filled with. Words are narrow for such high and wide Things. But should we not express these Things according to our Measure?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Glory is rather to be admired by Mortals, than un∣derstood.</HI></P>
<P>I am quite amazed, confounded and ravished at once. O eternal Dwelling-place of blessed Men and Angels, and of the MAN infinitely more excellent than all! How am I affected with thy various Beauty, excellent Glory, and delightsom Sweetness! What appearest thou now, O lower World? Thou art the Dunghil; this the Palace-royal: Thou art the Footstool, this the Throne. Were the Cur∣tains betwixt the higher and lower World drawn aside, all lower Glories would disappear: All Glories are here, and only here: This is the World. Where shall we find Emblems any where else, sufficient to represent, in the thousand thousand Part or Property, one of the infinite Beauties, various Glories, admirable Excellencies, tran∣scendent Vertues, wherewith this Land is stored? Verily it is a large Land indeed, like a Confluence of infinite Number of Worlds. O my Lord, thy Report was true, <HI>In my Father's House are many Mansions.</HI> The Earth is Nothing to the visible Heavens, and the visible to the in∣visible. O vast Land! Are they not shallow Fools, who
<PB N="35" REF="005510_0018_101848E2B614C5B8"/>
boast themselves of Shovelfuls of Earth? But Worms are much taken up with Dunghils. Nothing below this nar∣row Vault of the visible Heavens can bound the Outgo∣ings of capacious and sublime Spirits.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>We may imagine, in this our Childhood, childishly; and so conceive of Glory in a metaphorick Way.</HI></P>
<P>And O the Beauty and Sweetness, wherewith this bles∣sed Land is adorned! Earth in its <HI>May</HI>-clothing, with its various Beauties, appeared somewhat delightsom before; but all former Apprehensions are swallowed up; all the Senses &amp; Faculties are lost in the endless Maze of infinite Varieties of Beauties and Excellencies. Are not the Eyes almost ravished from their proper Orbs, by the strong at∣tractive Vertue of ravishing Objects? Are they not daz∣led and confounded? What Varieties! what Glories! what numberless Numbers! Every Object is enough to allure unto Ravishment: But the Conspiration of them all cannot be told. How are the Ears charmed with number∣less Variety of melodious Raptures! so that the Ears be∣come Harmony itself. How do incessant and full Gales of odoriferous Exhalations perfume and fill with a passing Sweetness, not only the Brain, but every Vein, Artery and Sinew I That which enters the Mouth, every where, surpasseth <HI>Ambrosia</HI> &amp; <HI>Nectar.</HI> The circumjacent Spirits have so pleasant Embraces, as they still refresh the Body, that cannot be weary. What shall I say? Am I not nonplus'd here? Lo, all Beauties, both material and im∣material, here! All Things are here in an eminent formal Manner. O mighty God, this World is a Master-piece of thy Power, Wisdom and Goodness indeed. Did I never see more of thy ravishing Attributes, than what is imprin∣ted on this golden World, should I not be ravished with an eternal Rapture? This is a Land befitting the Inhabi∣tants; all Things are ever in their <HI>May</HI>-clothing, do bloom and flourish with an eternal and glorious Verdue, seem∣ing, as it were, all to outbrave one another, in wonderful
<PB N="36" REF="005510_0019_101848E4A6318AC8"/>
Beauty and Excellency: What would an earthly Para∣dise appear here? Shall we speak of Gold and Gems, trampled upon by Beasts? Sure the Sun in its Strength would blush to let forth its Rays on so beautiful a Place, the least Stone here would look him out of Countenance; Nothing in the lower World, which is not here; and nothing here, which is to be seen in the lower World. If we speak any Thing in earthly Idiom, it must be in perfect Contradictions; all is covered over with all Vari∣eties of Beds of Lilies, and Roses, and dropping sweet-smelling Myrrhe, every where the Vines flourish, the Man∣drakes send forth an odoriferous Exhalation, the Pome∣granates bud, the Grapes and all Fruit hang in goodly Or∣der; all is overslown with <HI>Ambrosia, Milk</HI> and <HI>Hony</HI>; all is an Orchard, all a Champain Field; every Place is the sunny Side of the Hill, and also a pleasant Shadow; every Place is filled with odoriferous Gales, and yet there is nothing but one sweet and endless Calm: The Winds that blow here are like vital &amp; animal Spirits. Are they not these Heart-refreshing, and Soul-rejoicing Brea∣things of the Spirit of Life? All are planted with Trees, every one of which doth specifically differ from one ano∣ther, and bears every Month, every Hour, every Minute, Ten thousand Kinds of Fruits; and every Fruit contain∣eth Ten thousand Qualities; and every Quality Ten thousand Vertues, and every Vertue Ten thousand De∣lights, and every Delight is enough to confound My∣riads of Worlds of Men and Angels. All Things send forth melodious Notes, odoriferous Perfumes, and what may charm Thousands of Senses, differing specifically from one another: All Things here do more than con∣tain all the Vertues and Excellencies of Sun, Moon and Stars. O what every Thing is, how inconceivable, and be∣yond Imagination! This World is all Things, 'tis a Pa∣lace, also it is a glorious and stately City, decked with the Glory and Comeliness of her Builder; <HI>Whose Light is like unto a Stone most precious,</HI> whose Walls are high
<PB N="37" REF="005510_0019_101848E4A6318AC8"/>
and beautified with <HI>Twelve Gates, and at the Gates are Twelve Angels, whose Figure is Four-square, whose Cir∣cuit Twelve thousand Furlongs, and the Height of the Wall an Hundred forty four Cubits; the Building thereof is of Jasper, and the City of pure Gold, as it were transparent Glass.</HI> If the Foundations thereof be of Pearl, the Houses, Streets and Walls of Gold, what must the Deckings of the Houses be? If the ordinary Stuff exceed the Price of the Diamond, who can weigh our most noble JEWEL of the <HI>New Jerusalem</HI>? Sure all the Excellency of this lower Universe would be of no Reckoning here; yea, many Worlds are not to be valued. Must not this be a glorious and delightsom City, which is immediately enlightned with the uncreated Glory of JEHOVAH, and the LAMB? <HI>All the Kings of the Earth bring in their Glory and Ho∣nour hither</HI>: All other Glories and Excellencies are swallowed up, and concentred here: All Joys, all Plea∣sures, all Contentments, all Desires are for ever here.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>We cannot be so high, in our own Conceptions of Glory, but still we may be higher.</HI></P>
<P>But let us draw near, that we may discover more of these wonderful Things: What ravishing Melody is this? Were it not Heaven to dwell within the Sound of Heaven's Melody? I am altogether ravished! O <HI>it is good to be here</HI>! O the sweet, sweet, sweet Frame the In∣habitants are in! Their <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> have converted me almost into Joy itself. But what can I say? The Idiom of Glory hath a wonderful Efficacy and Deepness, beyond our shallow Uptakings, as far transcending Earth's Lan∣guage, as Immortality doth transcend Mortality: And I want an Ear celestial, musical, to perceive distinctly, and understand these angelical Songs, and wonderful Expres∣sions of Joy, Love and Admiration in the higher House: But the very Sound is enough to ravish all our Senses. Hear I not something like the Song of <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Lamb?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="005510_0020_101848E6CB77DE08"/><Q>We will sing unto the Lord; for he hath triumphed gloriously, his Enemies hath he over whelmed with ever∣lasting Shame: He is our Strength, and our Song, and he is become our Salvation: Thy Right-hand, O Lord, is become glorious in Power; who is like unto thee? Glorious in Holiness, fearful in Praises, doing Wonders. Thou in thy Mercy hast led forth thy People, which thou hast redeemed; thou hast guided them in thy Strength, unto thy holy Habitation: We have a strong City, Salvation hath our God provided for Walls and Bulwarks. We will greatly rejoice in the Lord, our Souls shall incessantly and eternally be joyful in our God; for he hath clothed us with the Garments of Sal∣vation, he hath covered us with the Robes of Righteous∣ness. Thou hast awaked, &amp; put on Strength, O Arm of the Lord; Art not thou it, which dried up the <HI>Red-Sea</HI>? that hath made the Deeps of the Sea a Way for thy Ransomed to pass over? Therefore the Redeemed of the Lord do return, and come with Singing unto <HI>Sion,</HI> and everlasting Joys upon their Heads; and Sorrow &amp; Sigh∣ing hath fled away. Sing ye Heavens, shout ye lower Parts of the Earth, break forth into Melody, ye Moun∣tains; for the Lord hath redeemed <HI>Jacob,</HI> and glori∣fied himself in <HI>Israel.</HI> Behold, we dwell on high, our Place of Defence is the Munition of Rocks: Our Eyes do see the King in his Beauty; our Eyes do behold <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI> a quiet Habitation, a Tabernacle that shall ne∣ver be taken down. And in this Mountain hath the Lord of Hosts made, unto all People, a Feast of fat Things; and hath swallowed up Death in Victory, and hath wi∣ped away all Tears from all Faces. The Lord is a Sun and Shield: He hath given Grace and Glory; no good Thing hath he withheld from these who have walked uprightly. How excellent is thy Loving-kindness! We are abundantly satisfied with the Fatness of thy House, and thou hast made us drink of the Rivers of thy Plea∣sures: Thou hast turned our Mourning into Dancing;
<PB N="39" REF="005510_0020_101848E6CB77DE08"/>
thou hast put off our Sackcloth, and girded us with Gladness: The Lines are fallen to us in pleasant Places; yea, we have a goodly Heritage: Thou hast shewed unto us the Path of Life; in thy Presence is Fulness of Joy, and at thy Right-hand are Pleasures for evermore. Worthy is the Lamb, that was slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Blessing; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God, by thy Blood, out of every Kin∣dred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation; and hast made us unto our God, Kings and Priests; and we shall reign for ever and ever. Cry and shout, thou In∣habitant of <HI>Zion</HI>; for great is the holy One of <HI>Israel</HI> in the Midst of thee.</Q> What a golden Life is this? Am not I come into Mount <HI>Zion?</HI> Know I not now by Experience, that the Converse of Mortals may be above? O what a ravishing Frame am I now in! The Melody of Heaven draws me nearer and nearer; I cannot, I will not, I may not rest, until I look <HI>within the Vail.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Christ, the Desire of all Nations, because he is God, most fully manifested to finite Capacities.</HI></P>
<P>O strange! Nothing but wonders! Are not the whole Inhabitants of the higher <HI>Canaan</HI> all in a Sea of Delight, Love and Admiration? Are they not all flocking round about, as contending, who shall be most satiated with the matchless Beauty and Loveliness of the WHITE and RUDDY ONE, the STANDARD-BEARER <HI>among Ten thousand</HI>? O the Days-man, betwixt God &amp; Creatures! the Wonder of Wonders, the Glory &amp; Triumph, and Shame of Creatures, the Beauty of Heaven, the Admirati∣on of Earth, the Compend and Model of Heaven and Earth, and all Things, the Life of all Joys, Marrow of all Loves, Flower of all Desires, Fountain of all Sweetness, Sun of all Glory, the everlasting Delight of the Father, and Ravishment of Men and Angels, the Centre whereun∣to all Hearts, all Loves, all Eyes do eternally &amp; inces∣santly
<PB N="40" REF="005510_0021_101848E8ED0A3E30"/>
run, the Brightness of the Father's Glory, the ex∣press Character of his Person! Christ Jesus, God-Man, the ever-flourishing Stock &amp; the Stem of <HI>Jesse,</HI> the Plant of Renown! All are chanting thus.</P>
<P>Speak no more of Beauties; Men &amp; Angels, all lesser Glories are quite swallowed up: This is the only Beauty, the only Excellency, by the borrowed Rays of whose Loveliness, we are all rendered glorious: Out of his Ful∣ness have we all received; let us down with these massie Crowns of Glory at his Feet; <HI>For of him, and by him, and through him, and to him are all Things.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>No Manifestation of God, so full and sweet to Crea∣tures, as through</HI> Emmanuel; <HI>so infinite is the Distance.</HI></P>
<P>O! my only WELBELOVED, thou art God, thou art God, the infinite <HI>JEHOVAH</HI>; and therefore thou art become my ALL, and only One; none but Him! I disdain all Yesterday-beings, for a Welbeloved: Yet, since thou art a Creature also, thou art more lovely as to me; wert thou not Man, as well as God, I could not enjoy thee so familiarly and nearly: Though Sin in its self cannot be the Object of Joy, yet the Result thereof is passing joyful: This World of free Grace, transcends never so many Worlds of another Kind. The Enjoyment of God, as a Redeemer, Husband, Brother, is another Manner of Enjoyment, than of God Creator. Happy, happy we, that ever we were miserable! We had been un∣done, if we had not been undone. We ruined our selves, but thou hast made us up, far, far above all that we had to lose: O sweet Debt of thy free redeeming Grace! Shall not every Moment of Eternity augment my Obligation? I am thy bound Dyvour, O my Lord; and therefore my Happiness shall grow and bloom throughout all Eternity.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>One Sight of Christ is enough to ravish never so many.</HI></P>
<P>The first Sight of thine Eyes hath stricken me with everlasting Admiration! Many excellent Beauties do my
<PB N="41" REF="005510_0021_101848E8ED0A3E30"/>
blessed Eyes behold, but thou dost infinitely transcend them all. Thy Countenance hath a Beauty &amp; Excellency above all possible created Glory! Increated Glory rays thro' the Vail of his humane Nature! My blessed Eyes, a thousand Times blessed Eyes, which behold the Man, who is God! Fellow-Beholders, this Sight hath cast us for ever into a wondering Frame! the more we be∣hold, the more we are inflamed; the more we love, the more we behold! O Wonderful eternal Circle! Hence Joys inutterable, inexpressible; hence the sweet praising Disposition, hence Admiration, hence Beholding; and thus throughout Eternity.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>All our Enjoyment nothing, till we see him Face to Face.</HI></P>
<P>O Flower of Excellency! O Ocean of Loveliness? Mortality could take up no considerable Portion of thee; the most excellent of their Discourses was childish Nonsense: Nothing, but <HI>seeing thee Face to Face,</HI> can discover thy Worth. Verily I never saw thee until now; and therefore Love and Joy were never in their highest Vigour. I love, I love now indeed! What tho' I might be said to love thee in thy Absence, and to be filled <HI>with Joy unspeakable and glorious,</HI> with the very Sound of thy Name? These Drops are nothing to the Ocean, the Tasting to the Banquet. O sweet, sweet, Nothing but Joy! who can stand beside infinite Love, and not be inflamed? Am I not almost converted into Love it self? O delight∣som ravishing Fire! What greater Happiness, than to burn here for evermore.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>The Soul is not perfectly happy, until it rest, with∣out Interruption, in the Welbeloved's Love.</HI></P>
<P>Now we are for ever in one anothers Arms; the Days of Heaven shall not put a Period to these Love-Embraces: <HI>Thou hast set me as a Seal upon thy Heart, as a Seal upon thine Arm; for Love is strong as Death,</HI> the Coals there∣of
<PB N="42" REF="005510_0022_101848EBC490DA90"/>
would burn up Hell itself. Nothing but full Eternity, incessant Enjoyment, will satiate this burning Love; and therefore art thou unto me <HI>as a Bundle of Myrrhe, which lieth forever betwixt my Breasts.</HI> This is the Place where Love doth bloom, with an eternal Verdure: No Ups and Downs, and Hidings of his Face; no Love∣sickness, thro' the want of personal Possession; no need of <HI>Apples,</HI> or <HI>Flagons of Wine</HI>; no contending with Time and Days, because of their seeming lazy Pace; nor with interposing Clouds, ling'ring Death, Sin and Mortality: Nothing, but full Enjoyment; I am as I would be: I see thy Face to the full; and therefore my Happiness overflows the Banks.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>The mutual Interest betwixt Christ and his Chosen, is an eternally sweet Consideration.</HI></P>
<P>Thou art mine, my dearest Lord, and I am thine; I was thine from Eternity, and thou art become mine to Eternity. O my large, wide, broad Inheritance! Thou art mine in full Possession: O my Happiness, my Happiness! my Loves overflow, my Joys are in their Spring-tide! <HI>Even thou art mine, and thy Desire is towa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds me.</HI> No Wonder I am ravished with thy Beauty: But art thou ra∣vished with mine? Wast thou not at Rest, until thou hadst brought me to these higher Chambers of Glory, that thou mightest be delighted forever in my Fellow∣ship? What am I to thee? If there be any Thing in me can draw one Look from thee, it is thine, only thine, and not mine own. If the Rays of this borrowed Love∣liness in me redound back upon thee, Thou hast recei∣ved but what is thine own. Beholdest thou ravishing Loveliness in me, who am, what I am only of thee? what boundless Ocean of Sweetness, what infinite Worlds of Beauty are in thy matchless Self! Many an excellent Object have I seen, but thou hast ravished my Heart from them all. I have found, I have seen him, who is only lovely: This fair One hath my Heart for evermore.
<PB N="43" REF="005510_0022_101848EBC490DA90"/>
Choicest Beauties of Yesterday, were it possible for you to draw my Affections in the least aside? I have tasted of Creatures Sweetness, but they could not satisfy: Shall it not be my endless Exercise, incessantly to kiss, and draw ravishing Consolations from the Lips, that brought the joyful Tydings of this boundless Happiness? None but Thee! If I love and delight in other Beauties, it is as they are decked with thy Loveliness; as they are Em∣blems, Shadows and Reflections of thee, who art <HI>alto∣gether lovely</HI>: But thou art the substantial Beauty, thou art the Beauty! Let innumerable Millions of Worlds of Beauty stand round about Thee, one Ray of thy Tran∣scendancy would eclipse them all. Beholders, can you tell what you see? O his Beauty, his Beauty! What more can be said, than that it infinitely transcends the Concep∣tions of Men and Angels?</P>
<P>Other Loves are but the Picture and Resemblance of Love, to this sublime and noble Love of JESUS: This is Love indeed; should I speak of Flames? am I not en∣tred into the Ocean? The I Floods, the Worlds of Love, <HI>for God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</HI> Is not this a sweet ravishing Habitation? What Joy to think, This is my eternal Re∣pose? I dwell in the Midst of hot burning Flames, without Harm, as in a Bed of Roses, and an Orchard of Delights.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>The glorified Soul, reflecting on former Things, looks upon all, as childish.</HI></P>
<P>This is the <HI>Fulness of the Stature of Christ</HI>: How ca∣pacious, to receive incessantly Floods of Love! Before, my Soul was narrow, now it is larger than the Heaven of Heavens. O the Outrunnings of my Soul after Thee! Before, they were small Streams; now they are huge Floods; small Things are not now noticed; all our Desires are now swallowed up. What is the Moon when the Sun doth appear? How massie, massie art thou, O Love of Jesus! would thou not down-weigh innume∣rable

Worlds? Had I known, in the Ten thousand Part on Earth, what now I know, the World would have ima∣gined me quite beside my self: How wonderfully would I have spoken, written and done? But, ah, how poorly and childishly did we speak of thee; What Joy, that Mor∣tality is done away!</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Saints and Angels shall be ever going forth into the matchless Excellencies of their WELBELOVED; and running them, as it were, over and over again.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' I behold thee, as thou art; yet am I ever sup∣plied with new Matter of Admiration: When more Ages are past, than Atoms in the Creation, I shall not be jejune, to express thine infinite Excellency. Men &amp; Angels, when shall you dive so deep, as you may dive no further? But shall I not for ever delineate thy Beauty now, when I have thee in my Arms? Sirs, shall we not for ever speak of him, of whom too much cannot be spoken? No Inju∣ry is here done to the Father and blessed Spirit; Their Glory and Excellency do visible shine here: And do these Arms embrace God, these Eyes see him? O the Mystery of Godliness! Men and Angels, you are all astonished: God visibly manifested! O Wonder of Wonders! Is not thy Name rightly termed, <HI>WONDERFUL?</HI> O my ele∣vated Thoughts! O Eternity, Eternity thou shalt be fil∣led with Wondering: What Glory shines in this Man's Face! Thy Countenance, Welbeloved, hath a non-such Majesty. The Saints have the Face of glorified Crea∣tures, and no more; but the Majesty of thy Counte∣nance is altogether Divine. O Perfection's Flower, and Marrow of Loveliness! None, who see thee, will enquire, <HI>What art thou more than another Beloved?</HI> O thy Face, thy ravishing Face! Indeed thou art <HI>the White and Rud∣dy, the Standard-bearer amongst a Myriad</HI>: Thy Face; my Welbeloved, is like the Face of the Son of God; every Smile is full of inexpressible Joy; <HI>For God, thy God hath anointed thee with the Oil of Gladness, above all thy Fellows.</HI> Is not this He, Men and Angels, <HI>Whose Visage
<PB N="45" REF="005510_0023_101848F0457B5DB8"/>
was more marred than any Man's</HI>; in whom the world saw no Beauty, or Desireableness? Is not this He, whose Face was spit upon by the Filth and Offscourings of Men? Verily, Welbeloved, tho' thou art <HI>the same, Yesterday, to Day, and for evermore</HI>; yet appearest thou far changed, from what thou appearedst on Earth. O but then thou didst strangely mask thy Divine Beauty with the Vail of Mortality, which now thou hast done away, that thy Glory may shine forth in its full Splendor before thy Chosen! O thy stately Majestick Head, only worthy to be <HI>crowned with Glory and Honour,</HI> to be exalted far above all Creatures! Strange! this majestick Head, that was once beset with a Crown of Thorns, is now surrounded with the Bright∣ness, which carries in its Bosom boundless Joys. This was <HI>the Joy than was set before him.</HI> O Blessed we, that have such an Head! The Head of this golden World is of <HI>fine Gold.</HI> O how beautiful are the Adornments of thy Head! O thou wouldst entangle all Creatures for ever in the Folds of overcoming Love! How am I ravished with thine Eyes! Heaven and Glory dwells in every Look; the first Glance of them did strike Heaven and Love into an e∣ternal Rapture: Nothing can resist their overcoming E∣manations of Love. And, did these Eyes gush forth Tears, through bitter Grief and Sorrow? Could ever the least Sadness &amp; Darkness enter into such Divine Orbs of Light and Joy? Thou hast overcome me with thine Eyes, my fair One. One Look of Thee, and no more, would ra∣vish Ten thousand Worlds of Men &amp; Angels. O the Noon-day Light of thy Countenance for ever and ever! And who can tell the Comeliness of thy fragrant, beautiful Cheeks? And what can be said of thy rosy Lips? How do they perfume this Land with their fragrant Myrrhe, that inces∣santly drops from them! O what boundless Ocean of Grace is poured into them! <HI>Therefore, God hath blessed thee for evermore.</HI> Every Kiss of them is an Heaven of Sweetness. I am filled and overcome with this Mirrour of Glory! <HI>The Smell of thine Ointment,</HI> afar off, did ravish my
<PB N="46" REF="005510_0024_101848F300E2CA98"/>
Heart; but now I am more, Ten thousand Times more, than ravished! One Drop of this Myrrhe would sweeten ten thousand Oceans of all imaginable Bitterness: And O thy princely Hands, fit to sway the Sceptre of this ever-flourishing Kingdom, delightsome Habitation! Can there be a more blessed Posture? <HI>His Left-hand is under my my Head, and his Right-hand doth embrace me.</HI> Am not I circled in the Arms of unsearchable Love? <HI>The eternal God is my Refuge, and underneath are everlasting Arms.</HI> These blessed Arms, that were stretched upon the Cross for me, do embrace me sweetly, for evermore. Whether thy Love doth more shine forth in the first, or latter Pos∣ture, cannot be told: But sure thy Love, in all its Re∣splendency, passeth all created Understanding. <HI>O</HI> the Glo∣ry, Sweetness and Excellency of thy Belly! <HI>O</HI> thy Bowels of Compassion! <HI>O</HI> what Rivers of Water do from thence flow out incessantly upon us! And what is compa∣rable to thy stately Legs? How glorious are thine Out∣goings among us! <HI>O</HI> my King and God, when thou <HI>trode upon the high Places of the Earth, its Foundations were shaken. How didst thou trample the People in thine Anger, and the Kingdoms in thy Fury?

Every Part of him, so to speak, is an infinite Mass of Beauty. What a Beauty then must all these numberless Beauties, composed in one, be? Is not <HI>thy Countenance as</HI> Lebanon, <HI>excellent as the Cedars?</HI> Thy Majesty is wonderfully various, and every Variety the Height of Excellency. By sweet Experience, I may say, <HI>The Mouth is most sweet</HI>: The Relicts of the Impression of one of thy Love-kisses may fill the Soul with passing Joys, throughout endless Ages.

distilling from the Hony-comb! Thy Voice, thy ra∣vishing Voice! Even to stand without the Gates of <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> and hear the Sound thereof, might wrap up a Creature in eternal Ravishment. And, is it possible, my matchless One, to attain the furthermost of thy infinite Perfections, tho' but one simple Excellency? Let me ra∣ther further and further into the Ocean of thy Loveliness, thro' endless Ages; yet shall ever be in the Entry: Ne∣vertheless will I pay thee the Tribute of Praises, &amp; cry up thee before Men and Angels; and speak of thine Excellen∣cy, while my Being remains. I praise thee not, because I am able to shew forth thy Worth fully; but strong Love doth constrain me, that forever I must be express∣ing, and for ever the Conclusion must be, THOU ART ALTOGETHER LOVELY; for to Thee alone doth this Epithet appertain. You chiefest of created Excellencies, can this agree to you? Are you nothing but Masses of pure, essential and unmixed Love? Who but he, even he alone is altogether lovely? He is all Loves, all Sweetness, all Ravishments: Nothing but Loveliness in Him! His Weakness, Infirmity, Poverty, Contempt, Crosses, Losses, Pains, &amp; Death, flash forth the ravishing Resplendencies of surpassing Love and Sweetness. Heart and Love, and all is gone from me. O the sublime Thoughts of my elevated Understanding! O this Frame! this Love! this Sweet∣ness! All are inutterable, all are inexpressible!</P>

<P>That <HI>we might be ever with thee, and behold thy Glo∣ry,</HI> was one of thy great Petitions, in the Days of thy Flesh; Thousand, thousand Times blessed I, that ever this was asked!

in a Vision of the Night, <HI>through a Glass,</HI> or any Way, is ravishing; as I often have sweetly experienced, in the Days of my Pilgrimage: <HI>To touch the Hem of thy Gar∣ment,</HI> or to see Thee in thy Infancy, was a Happiness inexpressible. What shall we say to our Lot, who are as near thee as out Heart can desire? O this high, high, high Dignity! O beloved Estate! far above the Heaven of Heavens; Nay, Numberless Heavens supperadded to one another! And am I in thy immediate Presence, even in the Chambers of Presence with Thee? O lovely one <HI>who inhabits Eternity</HI>! what Honour is this? What shall I say of it? But, thy Ways are incomprehensible. This is the Prerogative of the Saints, this is it! <HI>What shall be done unto the Man, whom the King delighteth to ho∣nour</HI>? Spake he not in good earnest, when he told us of Dignities, Thrones, Crowns, Priesthoods, &amp; Posses∣sions of all Things? Shall I never enough wonder at the Honour of the Saints? This is the Dignity of the Over∣comers, to wear the Lawrel, the Badges of Honour, the Garlands of Glory. How came thou to all this, O silly Self? hast thou been born to wear an immortal Crown, to be overladen within and without with so great a Weight of Glory? Thou appears, indeed, in the Equipage of a King, decked with Majesty, Glory and Honour; arrayed with wonderful Excellency and Comeliness. Waft thou not once, O thou silly I, a base Worm, defi∣led with the very Filth of Hell? How hast thou robb'd the Almighty of his Glory, dishonored his Excellency, wronged his Holiness, trampled upon his most precious Things, on his Blood; done what thou couldst to pre∣cipitate thy Self into eternal Perdition; violented the Gates of that woful Prison, O undone Soul, to cover thy Self with utter Darkness from the charming Beams of the Sun of Righteousness? yet am here, even here, surrounded with inexpressible Glory! Many Thousands, less deserving, are in the Place of utter Darkness. O thy Love! thy Love! <HI>which passeth all Understanding!</HI> O

thy free, free Grace! <HI>O the Height, and Depth, and Length, and Breadth</HI> of thy Ways! My Enjoyments are more than free; hath he not brought me over my De∣servings? But nothing can stand in the Way of infinite Love. Thou loved me, because thou loved me; and because thou loved me, I became lovely in thy Sight. <HI>Not unto us, not unto us be the Glory</HI>; but unto JEHO∣VAH, and the LAMB be Praise for ever and ever.</P>

<P>What astonishing Condescendency, to admit Bits of Nothing so near thee! Can this thy Way be ever enough admired?

Since free Love will have it thus, and it is not his Way, to create Desires, and not fulfil them: Strong Love can take Rest no where, but in his naked Embraces. On Earth I was unsatisfied, oftentimes complaining of Dis∣tance and Absence; and when I found Thee, <HI>I would not let thee go,</HI> but held thee fast, until weentred into those glorious Mansions: And how are my Thoughts heightned, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> holding Thee Face to Face?

All the Things of Time, from the greatest to the smallest, are now seen to be Wonders; howbeit that little of them was discerned, &amp; that in a brutish Manner. Strange! O Beloved, thou art another Manner of Christ than we spake of, in the Days of our Mortality: Thy very Name was scarce conceived. How came I hither with so little Conceptions?

My Knowledge on Earth w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of no Evidence, in Comparison of this Noon-Day V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion of Glory: As the Man looks back on his In∣fancy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a meer brutish Ignorance; &amp; the Man awak∣ned, on his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-past Dream; so do I now, on my most refined Conceptions on Earth.

<P N="18">18. <HI>To be Witnesses of the Glory of JEHOVAH and the LAMB, is an inexpressible Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>And dost thou manifest thy Self, in such a Manner, to us! What is essential Eternity to Beings of Yesterday! Are we fit Witnesses of thy Glory? O infinite Jehovah, are we not before thee, as Nothing &amp; Vanity? May not the Greatness of thy Glory, if thou shouldst let it forth to the full, confound, even confound us to Nothing? In Infiniteness nothing can comprehend, but an infinite Un∣derstanding: The furthermost of all created Glory is <HI>Nothing and Vanity</HI> in thy Presence, tho' it might seem somewhat among its like.

<P>Shall we not wonder again and again, and for ever, at the Way thou hast taken to manifest so nearly &amp; famili∣arly unto us, thy incomprehensible Glory?

To enjoy thee any Way, requires an infinite Conde∣scendency; the Disproportion being infinite: But this, this is the most wonderful Condescendency possile!

to the Opprobry and Laughing of the rascally Multitude; then condemned to the vile and shameful Death of the Cross, for Blasphemy and Treason; and that by the Pe∣tition of the vast Multitudes gathered together to the Passover, who preferred a base Robber before him! The Sentence was not sooner pronounced, than executed; for he was hanged betwixt two Thieves, in the Sight of the Multitude, to the Insultation of Devils, and their Slaves, who beheld this matchless One nailed to the cursed Tree, and bled to Death in great Torment, and Anguish of Spi∣rit: White the Sun, clothed in Mourning for his Lord, contrary to the Course of Nature, sympathized with the eclipsed Creator, and withdrew its Beams from these, who had eclipsed the Light of the whole Creation. Thus did my <HI>Welbeloved</HI> continue for a long Space, and gave up the Ghost in great Torment of Body and Spirit, yes was buried, continued under the Power of Death for a Time: And this, even this is the same.

But, Men and Angels, what are your Conceptions of this Dust, to be the Temple wherein the high and lofty One, the almighty Jehovah, the eternal consubstantial Son of God, doth personally dwell, and with which he is personally united?

Wisdom! O thy Love, thy boundless Love! Love that <HI>passeth all Understanding!</HI> Strange! hath the Almighty exalted thee, O Man's Nature, unto this incomprehensible Dignity? It was much thou receivedst the Characters of Divine Maiesty and Excellency; yet more to be admitted into Friendship &amp; Converse with that great and dreadful Former of all. O are not such Gradations of Wonder, like Millions of Worlds, placed above Millions of Worlds, and again, and again, and for evermore? Is not Man in∣finitely obliged to such a Sovereign? If the crawling Worms be infinitely obliged for their Being, what shall be said of Man, created with so noble a Being, in so noble a Condition: Was it possible he could ever have loved, feared, praised him enough? was it possible a Creature, thus dealt with, could rebel? Yet strange! when this dreadful Prodigy did enter the Creation, O astonishing Rebellion! monstrous Ingratitude! From thenceforth, what could be expected but pure Vegeance, like an o∣verflowing Flood, should destroy Head and Tail, Root and Branch, with an eternal Destruction? Could any Mercy have been expected from Heaven to Earth, when Earth had denounced open Enmity against Heaven? What shouldst thou have done, dread Sovereign of all Things, with base, monstrous and ingrate Mankind, but make it wholly the Butt of thy unmixed Wrath? What are never so many Worlds of Men and Angels to Thee, that thou shouldst spare them, if once they dare to utter one World against thee? Shouldest thou reduce to Nothing, what thou hast created? What hast thou lost, since thou couldst produce, in this very Moment, Millions of Millions of Worlds? Yea, and if produced, what are they, but as so many Millions of Shadows &amp; Nothings before thee? O the Conscendency, the Sweetness of thy Nature!

the golden Sceptre, as a Manifestation of the Thoughts of boundless Love, that flamed in thy Heart from all Eternity? erecting a glorious Throne of free, altogether free Grace, upon the horrid Apostasy &amp; Rebellion of ungrate Man? Who could have imagined such a Dispensation as this? Were you expecting this, you glorious Angels, when ye beheld Man backslide so monstrously? Were you thinking so prodigious Ingratitude would come to this? Were you not amazed at such a second Covenant, after the breaking of the first? Yea, are we not all in the same admiring Frame? O Eternity, thou art sufficient to make the Impression old, which God hath enstamped on the Minds of Men and Angels. The Objects are wonderful! Our Faculties are wonderfully evelated! What Wonder, my Heart is fixed! O this Frame of Spirit! I see, I see, that a World of altogether free Grace, was the only Design of Eternity! even that Heaven should be filled for ever with a Song, <HI>To him that sitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever.</HI> Lord, what hast thou done? Not only hast thou become Friends with Man again; not only hast thou made him thine everlasting Minion, but thou hast also personally assumed his Nature: that thou mightst draw him nearer thy Self, &amp; manifest thy Glory unto him, in a more familiar, intimate, sweet &amp; wonder∣ful Way, than was possible in the first Dispensation. Won∣derful! Did Man cast off the Image of his Maker? And, did his Maker take upon him Man's Image, to restore all again? Didst thou, O my God, assume personally our Nature, even in its lowest Estate, that thou mightst weep, and sigh, and groan, and sorrow, and die for undone Man? Is not this Love indeed! Man had <HI>destroyed him∣self,</HI> but did our excellent Welbeloved step in betwixt eternal Wrath, and the miserable Sinner; and all the Bil∣lows of Divine Vengeance did he receive, till Divine Fu∣ry was pacified! No Sorrow, no Shame, no Pain could ter∣rify him: Infinite Love is invincible. I will not spare base Man, said offended Majesty, in the Day he rebels against

me, as I have said, he must die the Death; for the Word hath gone out of my Mouth. Be it so, saith the Son of God; here am I, a Man ready to suffer all Sorrow, Grief and Pain, of Soul and Body, unto the very Death: Hath Man sinned? Man shall bear the Punishment. I, even I will die the Death: <HI>Sacrifice and Offerings thou wilt not accept; but a Body thou hast given me.</HI> I will bear their Grief: I will carry their Sorrows. My Father, I am glad thou lay upon me the Iniquity of them all; they are thine and mine from Eternity: This was our Tran∣saction before all Ages, That in the Fulness of Time, I should lay down my Life for these, thou hast given me out of the World; <HI>Therefore, Thou, O Father, dost love me, because I lay down my Life for my Sheep.</HI></P>

O then my Happiness overflows its Banks! Am not I overjoyed, as at the first Entry? How famili∣arly and sweetly do I converse with thee, O excellent Weldbeloved! Myriads of Ages appear not a Moment in thy Presence. This Dispensation is an eternal Wonder! Would not this have been thought a horrid Petition, before the Promulgation of the Gospel? <HI>O that thou wert as my Brother, that sucked the Breasts of my Mother: when I should find thee without, I could kiss thee: His Left-hand should be under my Head, and his Right-hand should em∣brace me. I am my Beloved's, and his Desire is towards me.</HI> Indeed our Dignity before our Fall was high and

What shall we do throughout Eternity, but wonder? <HI>God manifested in the Flesh,</HI> O strange? Lord God Almighty, what couldst thou do more to Creatures?</P>

<P>Shall I not behold and admire, admire &amp; behold, and flame and love, while this immortal Being remains? The Vail is drawn aside, and we behold clearly the Man, Christ Jesus, filled with the Godhead! Indeed the Earth is full of a Divine Glory, the Heavens also in a more spe∣cial Manner, Saints and Angels wonderfully &amp; eminent∣ly; yet all in Measure: But Glory dwells in this Man above all Measure! He is God equal with the Father. No Nearness to the Fountain of all Glory, unto that Near∣ness of the humane Nature of our Welbeloved, with the Godhead! O then the Emanations of thy inexhausti∣ble Fulness! Even thy Glory, Beauty and Sweetness, shall overflow their Banks for ever &amp; ever. We are ever filled and over-filled with thy Fulness; yet there still re∣mains as much behind. Infinite Worlds of Men and An∣gels couldst thou satiate, and make to run over with thine overcoming Love and Sweetness. <HI>Upon whom</HI> may, and <HI>doth not thy Light shine</HI>? Thou art the Sun, we are the Stars: What should we be, didst thou draw in thy Glory? Wherever thy Glory is peculiarly manifested▪ there is Heaven. Let me be any where, so be thou shine upon me. They have the sunny Side of the World, who behold thy Face in Righteousness. A World of all Creature-Beauties and Delights, is a Hell without Thee: I should count them a Mass of Deformity, should they for one Mi∣nute stand in betwixt me and thy ravishing Countenance.

Blessed ones, what must He be, whose Glory and Beauty, darting in upon us, doth beautify us all? What were we, if this fair One were not amongst us? By thy darting upon me, I am Partaker of Divine Nature, even transformed from Glory to Glory. O thy attractive, lovely Emanations! I cannot, will not, but follow thee, whithersoever thou goest, tho' without the Borders of this great All, or thro' the Lake that bur∣neth with Fire and Brimstone: These then should be no more what they are, but Worlds of Joy and Delights. O thy Glory, thy Glory, thy Glory! Cursed Monsters, who are under eternal Vengeance, for your Hatred to his Excellency, had you a Glimpse of this transcendent Glo∣ry, should not your Misery and Torment be quite for∣gotten? But ye are banished from his Presence &amp; Glo∣ry, and therefore you are unutterably miserable. O my Happiness? <HI>Is it not good to be here?</HI> Wonderful! was I ever loth to come here? My Lord is here, are not then <HI>all Things here?</HI> Was I ever loth to come here, because silly harmless Death did stand in the Way?

I am like Thee, who partake of thy Nature, the Beams of thy Excellency every where darting upon me. O this Illumination! O the high, high Pitch of Glory! O the everlasting Smiles of my Lord's Countenance! O Mani∣festations of more and more throughout Eternity! All the Enjoyments of Eternity are as one Moment; All Ages are as swallowed up in the infinite Depths of boundless Excellencies. Creature-enjoyments are empty, and may be received; but infinite Love ravisheth throughout E∣ternity: When more Ages are past than there are Atoms in the Creation then shall I be, just as I am now, ever swiming and diving in the Depths of thy infinite Perfecti∣ons, and never attaining the furthermost. This is a Life! How sweet to dwell under the Noon-day Beams of thy ravishing Countenance? All Darkness and Ignorance are quite dispelled; every Thing is known as it is, in its own proper Essence: Here Wisdom flourisheth in its highest Region; my former Attainments are swallowed up, like the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of a Candle beside the Sun.

How was I vexed with low and unbeseeming Thoughts of thy all-glorious Majesty? Whence Deadness and Un∣fitness of Spirit for worshipping of thee aright. Now I am inlightned with the full and immediate Beams of thy Glory: And O how great and precious are my Thoughts of thee! O this ravished Frame of Spirit! How am I all inflamed with divine Love?

Thy substantial Image is lovely, O my heavenly Father! O then thy Loveliness! Men and Angels, you are but as so many painted acci∣dental Draughts of God's Excellency; but Christ Je∣sus is the substantial Image of God, his very Power, Ef∣ficacy, and Excellency, by which he doth all Things; his very Self.

What could Jehovah do more for us, than he hath done? Hadst thou any greater Gift, than the only Son of thy Love? Didst thou give thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osom-De∣light to be a Propitiation for us, the Off-scourings of all Things? Is not this Love infinitely transcending all finit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Capacities? That thou vouchsafed a Being on us, was a great Bounty; but more, that Thou created us after thy lovely Divine Image; yet more, thou con∣descended to enter into a Covenant with us; and yet higher, to be appointed thy everlasting Minions! But what shall we think, Men &amp; Angels, hath he not given unto us the Son of his everlasting Delight? This Gift can never be enough admired &amp; esteemed! O Almigh∣ty Jehovah, Thou givest like a King! too great a Gift indeed, for us to receive, but not too great for Thee to give. Nothing can be too great for Thee; and this was the greatest Gift that thou couldst give: Hadst thou given us Ten thousand Worlds of Beauty, stored with all imaginable Paradises of Pleasures, with innume∣rable created Heavens of Sweetness, with infinite Le∣gions of Men and Angels, should they not have been esteemed rich and noble Gifts? But all is just nothing to matchless JESUS. It is a Shame to lay any Thing in the Ballance with him: One Ray of his Godhead would confound all possible created Excellencies to no∣thing.

to the blessed, a Thousand Times blessed Bargain of the New Covenant? Verily, that Love thou manifested in the Fulness of Time, did show the Love that flamed in thy Heart, before all Ages: Tho' thou waft in the <HI>Bosom of the Father,</HI> ever delighting him, and delighting in him; yet didst thou come down to base Earth, and conversed familiarly with silly, sinful, frail Man! and was found to be a Man, that Thou might save him lost and undone to the uttermost. Men and Angels, you are all looking in, with Astonishment: To behold God Personally, clo∣thed with the humane Nature, is a Sight, we can never enough view and admire! The Mirror, wherein we behold the Love of God to Creatures, in its full Splen∣dor. Waft thou never enough near and intimate with us, until thou becamest <HI>Bone of our Bone, and Flesh of our Flesh?</HI> until thou becamest one with us, who art one with the Father; <HI>For both he that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctified, are all one: For which Cause, thou art not ashamed to call us Brethren.</HI> O essential Love; art thou not here manifested transcendently? That Sentence was comely in thy Mouth, <HI>Love your Enemies.</HI> Hast thou not loved thy mortal Enemies, to the Death?

How sweet hast thou been unto us, in the Days of our Pil∣grimage! How didst thou convince, convert, enlighten and comfort! We should have perished in our Journey to this goodly Land, hadst thou not strengthned us, in our inward Man. And waft Thou so sweet in the Days of our sinning? Art thou not now sweet, infinitely more than sweet? O the full, incessant, eternal Flow∣ings of the Spirit of Love! This South-wind breathen strongly, causing the Spices of the higher Paradise exhale a ravishing Fragrancy every where: How, in every High-tide, nothing but ravishing Perfumes? no Winds, but the Breathings of the Holy Spirit. O what Rivers, Oceans, Worlds of Consolation! One Drop of this fall∣ing upon the Heart, appeared Heaven itself; but this is more than Heaven! Every Drop of this boundless Ocean of Sweetness, I am entred for ever into, would ravish Ten thousand Worlds of Men and Angels. This could not be conceived by Mortals, unless in a childish Manner; the first Fruits surpast their Apprehensions, and yet had no Proportion considerable with the Harvest. None can apprehend this, except they be experienced therein; and none can be capable of this Experience, but those, who are raised to this wonderful Pitch of Glory. These Floods of Sweetness would have undone us, in a Moment, had we entred them in our frail Mortal Estate. O miraculous Elevation of Glory, which can bear such Sweetness! Are we not as so many Trophies, and Monuments of thy transcendant Power, in its high Victory?

Thy Sweetness, O thy ravishing Sweetness; The Floods, Oceans, Worlds of eternal ravishing Delights treasured up at thy Right-hand, wherein I am entred and swim for ever and ever! Thy Land, O Emmanual, overflows with Pleasures. Never, never did I know what Joy was, until now. Now I feel, <HI>Light hath been sown for the Righteous, and Joy for the Upright in Heart.</HI> Joy is come to its <HI>May</HI> blooming Vigour. O the Rivers of Pleasures, that sweetly run through all the Faculties of the Soul and Body! O the full Gales of the Spirit of Consolation! Am I not almost Joy it self? Are these the Joys that were so much spoken, and written of, on the other Side of the Water? Surely, Earth's Idiom hath come wonderfully short! Thy Word was written to Children, and therefore did express all in a Manner suted to childish Capacities; but nothing low and childish here! O Massie, Solid, Substantial, Enduring Joys!

Is it not good to be here? <HI>Have not the Lines fallen unto us in pleasant Places?

O sweet Dispensation! first to be afflicted, and then comforted; to weep, and then to re∣joice, to run, and then to rest! O High-tide of over∣flowing Joys! which hath swallowed up all former Griefs and Sorrows. The first Sight of thy ravishing Countenance, O my God, made me, as it were, forget that ever I was on Earth! This Land hath a sweet-smel∣ling Countenance: Pain and Sadness should be converted here into Joy and Delight. Here is an eternal Spring; <HI>For the Winter is past, the Rain is over and gone, the Flowers appear on the Earth, the Time of the Singing of Birds is come, and the Voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land.</HI> Now we have everlasting Joys for Sorrow, the Oil of Gladness for the Spirit of Heaviness.

Nothing on Earth was heard among us, but the confused Noise of Warriors, the Sighs and Groans of Men in an Agony. Now the Heavens of Heavens are filled with the joyful Melody of Heroick Conquerors. We sowed in Tears for a Moment; and now reap in Joy for evermore! Thou hast made us glad, unconceivably above the Days Thou hadst afflicted us: Thou hast arisen, and thine Ene∣mies are scattered, and all thy Haters are fled before Thee; as Smoke is driven away before the Wind, so are they e∣vanished before thy terrible Presence: But all the Righte∣ous are glad, and they rejoice before Thee; yea, they ex∣ceedingly rejoice.</P>

Were I in the Place of my Deserving, should I not been even now Blaspheming thine all-glori∣ous and exalted Name? O thy free, free Love!

Had I been left to my hellish Will, I should for ever have destroyed my self: But Thou sweetly and connaturally, ere ever I was aware, didst ravish Heart and all from me; So that my Will could not but stoop to thy overcoming Loveliness. When I was following after the monstrous Imagnations of my evil Heart, debauching my Loves and Joys on Creature-enjoyments, despising the only Excellent Things, then didst Thou discover thy irresistible Lovliness unto me; which bowed, trans∣formed, and enamoured all the faculties <HI>of my Soul</HI>; so that I could not but yield, most willingly yield: Con∣naturally did the Influences of thy Spirit work on the Powers of my Soul; So that I closed with Thee on thine own Terms, as freely as I had been absolute Sovereign of myself; and yet as infallibly as I had been no intellec∣tual Agent.

Who should exalt, and love, and fear, and obey, and serve Thee, if not we? Didst thou love us from E∣ternity? And shall we not praise thee to Eternity? And can we but extol thee? Not so much because thou art Good to us, as because thou art Good in thy self. But, O how is my Heart inflamed, to think, how thy Love from Eternity brake forth in Time! How didst thou shew forth the Acts of thy free sovereign Love? in that thou hadst written my Name for eternal Life! How bravely have all Exigences, and cross Dispensations con∣spired to my Welfare?

Thy Ways to me in Time are the Matter of an eternal Song! All Exigences of Time did so jump together, as every one hath proved a Step to this inexpressible Glory. Free redeeming Love hath been written on all the Passages of my Pilgrimage! and most in the last Water; when I be∣gan to sink, thou held me up in thy Arms, and put my Head in thy Bosom, and said, <HI>Be of good Cheer my Love, thy Sins are forgiven thee; fear not, my Dove, but rejoice exceedingly; for thy God, thy Head, thy Lord, thy Hus∣band, thy Saviour is here, holding thee in his Arms.

O high, high Capacity of Glory! O su∣perexcellent and only Glory in its Blooming! O the ra∣vishing Frame, that we are for ever into! Are we not the self-same Persons we were on Earth? and yet we are not the same! Every one of us is like our All-lovely and WELBELOVED! whom we eternally behold, with our bodily Eyes, according to our proper Measure; every one of us is at the highest Pitch of created Perfection: This is a wonderful Transformation indeed! O Sun, Sun of the lower World, I can look thee out of Countenance, and dazle thee with every Cast of mine Eyes! Is this, sometime poor, frail, despicable I? Surely this is I! this self-same I, who was so silly in mine own Eyes, and the Eyes of all the Beholders. Wonderful! Am not I crush∣ed under such an exceeding Weight of Glory? But Glory, and only Glory, can sustain it self. Thy eternal Power and Godhead is manifested upon us, in a transcen∣dent Manner; Thou hast gone beyond, by almost infinite Degrees, the Limits of Nature: The natural World is quite abolished; what now is natural, and agreeable to created Beings, before was miraculous and naturally impossible.</P>
<P N="33">33. <HI>The highest Manifestations of God in Time, are but meer Emblems of the Noon-day Manifestation.</HI></P>
<P>The most signal Foretaste of this Glory on Earth, was thy Transfiguration, O Welbeloved, in the Days of thy Mortality, on the holy Mount, <HI>when thy Face shone as the Sun, and thy Raiment was as the Light</HI>; so that mortal Beholders were amazed, &amp; confounded: Such an Unsuita∣bleness there is betwixt Mortality and Immortality! Weak Heads would not be able to bear one Draught of this ce∣lestial Wine. And was thy Face so majestick and glori∣ous, in the Days of thy Mortality and Sorrow? Is it not
<PB N="76" REF="005510_0039_101812CA75D19A68"/>
more than Majestick and Beautiful, now in the Days of thy Joy and Exaltation, when <HI>Thou hast seen all the Tra∣vel of thy Soul, and art satisfied?</HI> More Loveliness is to be seen in every View of thy divine Countenance, than on in∣finite Numbers of excellent, beautiful Worlds. One Sight of thee, and no more, may set never so many Myriads of Men &amp; Angels in the burning Flames of immortal Loves! Much was spoken, in Time, of thy Acts, and Glory, and Majesty; but lo, the thousand, thousand Part hath not been told! Indeed thou art a Beloved, <HI>more than another Beloved.</HI> All Joys, that I ever took thee for my All, and only One! That ever I cried heartily, <HI>Amen,</HI> to the blessed Bargain of the new Covenant, &amp; renounced my Vanities and came to thee! That ever I subjected myself to the O∣bedience of all thy Commandments! That ever I prefer∣red a holy, heavenly, mortified Walking, in Time, to the fulfilling my vain fleshly Inclinations! That ever I <HI>estee∣med the Reproaches of Christ greater Riches than the Plea∣sures of Sin for a Season</HI>! Now I clearly behold, That <HI>I have chosen the good Part, that shall never be taken from me.</HI> O happy I! that ever <HI>I sold all, and bought this matchless Pearl of invaluable Price</HI>! O my Riches, my Riches! Since I have Thee, O Welbeloved, what can I have more? Strange! wast thou despised by base Worldlings? But they knew thee not; thy ravishing Loveliness was hid from their blinded Eyes; which if they had seen, how should the whole Race of Mankind run after thee? Men and Angels, all Beauty, all Loveliness, all Excellen∣cies are here to be seen: Much is to be seen in this visible Fabrick of this great Creation; but no Ma∣nifestation of Glory to this! Who can desire more, than to stand beside thee? O Flower and only Beauty of Hea∣ven, what are all created Heavens? Thou art only Hea∣ven thy self. No Wonder, <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> you inor∣dinately desired such an Armful, as the dead Body of this lovely Lord Jesus; since you knew it was, tho' a dead Lump of Clay, the Body of the Man, who is God, infi∣nitely

above the Value of innumerable, glorious created Heavens. What a sweet Armful now, when exalted to such an high Pitch of Glory?</P>
<P N="34">34. <HI>The Saints are every Way like their WELBELO∣VED; since full Love must have full Similitude.</HI></P>
<P>Love desires the nearest Similitude, and Conjunction: As Thou becamest like us, assuming our Nature; so hast Thou made us like Thee, both in Spirit and Body. We are in every Part transformed into thy lovely Image: Whatever before was Terrestrial, is now Heavenly and Divine. These Tabernacles were <HI>sown in Corruption, Dis∣honour and Weakness; Now they are raised in Incorrup∣tion, Glory and Power. They were sown natural Bodies; they are raised spiritual: For as once we bare the Image of the earthly</HI> Adam, <HI>so now we bear the Image of the hea∣venly.</HI> O thy vivifying Spirit, that raised Thee from the Dead! <HI>By whom</HI> thou hast made us uncapable of any the least Change, tending to Corruption! And what tho' it were not so? Here is the Tree of Life, whose very Leaves are Medicines of Mortality. Thou art the Light and Life of the higher House; thy sweet, lively Influen∣ces can make dead Clay live eternally. O thy sweet Sha∣dow! Thy pleasant Fruit! Thy ravishing Perfume, fil∣ling all with immortal Vivacity! Is it possible any can die beside Thee, O Fountain of Life! What Wonder, I am so lively, who have the Beams of Life ever darting upon me? The Inhabitants here cannot say, <HI>They are sick.</HI> Here is perfect Security; our Iniquities are blotted out, and quite abolished. O excellent Life of God, in its Perfe∣ction! rendering, not only the Spirit, but also <HI>the Body,</HI> every Vein, every Artery, every Sinew, <HI>active</HI> with immortal Vigour; for all is filled and over-filled with Joy. O my Beloved Thou art excellently termed, <HI>The Prince of Life, the Resurrection and the Life.</HI> Verily, Thou wast in good Earnest when thou criedst <HI>He that believeth on me, out of his Bell shall flow Rivers of

living Waters.</HI> O the Power &amp; Strength of Immortality! We are become mighty, we have the Strength of an U∣nicorn; The Lord Jehovah is become our Strength. We will walk upon the high Places of the Universe. <HI>He hath given Power to them that were faint, &amp; to them, who had no Might, He encreased Strength.</HI> What was the Strength of Clay to heavenly Vigour? The Disproportion be∣twixt the Excellency of the Terrestial, and Celestial, cannot be told: And no Wonder we are so vivacious and strong; since our earthly Part is become heavenly and glorious: Flesh and Blood is done away, as incompati∣ble with such heavenly Majesty. These Bodies, tho' sub∣stantially the same, yet are they quite other as to the Qualities, which are Heavenly, Spiritual and Divine. Na∣ked Beings, considered as such, are endowed with no Ex∣cellency: It is only by supervenient Modifications they are rendered intrinsically more, or less, excellent, or base. What Wonder we are thus? Whose Essences are clothed over, and perfected, without and within, with superex∣cellent Perfections, meerly heavenly and divine. O the Comeliness and Beauty wherewith Soul and Body is a∣dorned! O what Beauty, when two excellent Beauties are united in one! O sweet Union! O pleasant delightsom Fellowship! In the Days of Mortality, the Consort be∣twixt them was, in a great Part, jarring and unpleasant, the one did obscure the Excellency of the other: But now the Soul in the Body, is like the Sun shining in its proper Sphere; or like the Light darting thro' a perspi∣cuous Body, adorned with various modifying Beauties, whereby the Rays are variously perfected, in their modi∣fied Out-goings: All the Properties, Perfections, Facul∣ties, and Actions of Soul and Body, are modified and perfec∣ted by their substantial Connexion. Indeed, my Lord, we have gained wonderfully, by losing our first Excellency; which was excellent in itself, and glorious and heavenly in Comparison of our sinful Condition, we precipitated ourselves headlong into: But was earthly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Com∣parison

of this. Who could have imagined that an earth∣ly animal Creature, should have been exalted to the State of Angels? How silly is Man, in an earthly State? How excellent, in an heavenly? and all by the Power and Vir∣tue of the Man, who is infinitely more than a Man.</P>

<P>We are blessed, and more than blessed, who enjoy thee every Way: We drink abundantly, both out of the Fountain and Streams, at once; being satiate with the re∣flex &amp; direct Emanations of thy eternal Sweetness. Even thou thy self art in an incomprehensible Way delighted with the Reflections of thy Glory, where with this beau∣tiful All, but especially thy Spouse, is adorned. Art thou not inamoured with thy ravishing Image imprinted on her? So that thou criest out, <HI>Thou hast ravished my Heart, my Sister, my Spouse; thou hast ravished my Heart with one of thine Eyes, with one Chain if thy Neck: Thou art all fair, my Love, there is no Spot in thee.</HI> The Love of Compla∣cency ariseth from Similitude: O then shew thy Love to us; our Love to thee, and one another! We are become altogether fair, by washing ourselves in thy most preci∣ous Blood. What can be our Exercise thro' Eternity, but sweet Embracing? O our ravishing sweet Entertain∣ments of Love, among these ravishing Mountains of Roses and Spices! O what Compellations! What Love-Kisses! O the overcoming Perfume of the vast Mountains of Myrrhe, and Hills of Frankincense! O the Smell of his <HI>Lebanon</HI>-Garments! O his fragrant Ointments! O his Soul overcoming Emanations! Every Hour here is Heaven, and more than Heaven. What Joy to see Christ, and all his Members together, in the royal Palace of Glory?

We all longed to be here, sought to be here, prayed to be here, ran to be here, groaned and wept to be here; and behold, we are all

As from Eternity I loved them; so to Eternity will I enjoy them: As I made them Sharers of my Sufferings and Sorrow; so have I made them Partakers of my Glory and Joy: As I have entred into the Oceans of boundless Joys; so have I made them to enter also. The Desires of my Soul are fully accomplished: My fair Ones Joys are full: As their Afflictions were my Afflictions, their Sorrows my Sor∣rows; so their Joys are my Joys: For <HI>we are One, and they are One in us, even as we are One</HI>: For <HI>I have given them the Glory, which thou hast given me; I in them, and thou in me</HI>; whence <HI>they are made perfect in one.

<Q>As we have heard, so have we seen in the City of the Lord of Hosts, God hath established it for ever. The Lord our God doth save us this Day, as the Flock of his People; for we are the Stones of a Crown lifted up, as an Ensign, upon his Land: For how great is his Goodness, and how great is his Beauty! Sing, O Daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all thy Heart, O Daughter of Jerusalem: For the Lord thy God, in the Midst of Thee, is migh∣ty; He hath saved Thee, and rejoiceth over Thee with Joy; He rests in his Love, He joyeth over Thee with Singing; He hath healed our Backslidings, He hath loved us freely: For his Anger is turned away, and he comforteth us. He is as the Dew unto us, we grow as the Lily, and cast forth our Roots as Lebanon. He hath made us, and the Places round about his holy Hill a Blessing, &amp; causeth the Showers to come down in their Season; even Showers of Blessing for evermore. And the Tree of the Field doth yield her Fruit, and our Land doth yield her Increase; and we are safe in our Land, and do know the Lord. Behold, He hath brought us from all Countries, and gathered us from the Coasts of the Earth: For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the Hand of him that was strong∣er than he; therefore are we come to, and sing in the Height of Zion; and flow together to the Goodness of the Lord, for Wheat, and for Wine, and for Oil, and for the Young of the Flock, and for the Herd: And our Soul is as a watered Garden; And we shall not sor∣row any more at all: For behold, the Lord hath crea∣ted a new Heaven, and a new Earth, and the former is not remembred, nor doth come into Mind. Our Gates are open continually, they shall not be shut Day nor Night; for Brass we have Gold, and for Iron we have Silver, and for Wood Brass, and for Stones Iron.

Our Light doth break forth as the Mor∣ning, and our Health springeth forth speedily: And our Righteousness doth go before us, and the Glory of the Lord is our Reer-ward. We are saved of the Lord with an everlasting Salvation; we shall not be ashamed, nor confounded, World without End. O Lord, Thou art my God, I will exalt thee, I will praise thy Name; for thou hast done wonderful Things; Thy Counsels of Old, are Faithfulness and Truth; for thou hast been a Strength to the Poor, a Strength to the Needy, in his Distress; a Refuge from the Storm, a Shadow from the Heat: And hast brought down the Noise of Devils and their Slaves, as Heat in a dry Place. And hast swallowed up Death in Victory, and wiped away Tears from all Faces. Lo, this is our God, we have waited for Him; He hath saved us, we will be glad and rejoice in his Salvation: He extendeth Peace to us like a River, and our Glory is like a flowing Stream. Our Heart rejoiceth, our Bones flourish like an Herb: And the Hand of the Lord is known to∣wards his Servants, and his Indignation towards his Enemies; for he hath punished the World for their Evil, and the wicked for their Iniquity; and hath caused the Haughtiness of the Proud to cease; and hath laid low the Pride of the Terrible, and broke the Staff of the Wicked, and the Sceptre of the Rulers. Hallelujah, Salvation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power unto the Lord our God: True and righteous are his Judgments; for he hath judged all his Ene∣mies; and the Glory of Avenging Justice is for ever displayed.

We are one with thee; for both <HI>He that sanctifieth, &amp; they that are sanctified, are one.</HI> Are you not excellent then, O ye Angels? Were not pas∣sing excellent, and only delightsom, O ye excellent Ones of the Earth, when incompassed about with innumerable Infirmities; and are you not now, so many Masses of Ex∣cellency and Delight? If, when clothed with Mortality, you were of sublime and princely Spirits; what are you now, when <HI>Mortality is swallowed up of Life</HI>? Was our Converse sweet in the Valley of Tears and Sorrows? and is it not more than pleasant in this Paradise of Joys and Delights? Was our Lamenting our Distance from God, to one another, sweet? What Ravishments in our mutual Congratulations of these overflowing Delights, and Hap∣piness, in the immediate Presence of JEHOVAH and the LAMB? What a golden Life is this! As this full Enjoy∣ment of Thee, O my God, doth swallow up all other Enjoyments; so doth it perfect them also. Until our Love to thee was perfected, never did we love one a∣nother perfectly. The more thou art loved, the more of thy Image. Thou art the Centre of all my Faculties; All my Love to Saints and Angels terminates in Thee; Thou hast clothed them with thy Loveliness, and they are become Lovely: Yea, tho' they were not, yet, since they are the Object of thy Love; therefore will I love them: But, because thou hast loved them, therefore hast thou made them wonderfully lovely; and there∣fore, how are we all kindled together, into an eternal Flame! O what a wonderful Sympathy! As we suffered in one another's Afflictions; so do we rejoice in one a∣nother's Joy. O this superabundant Joy and Happi∣ness! Since all your Joy and Happiness, Men and Angels, are mine; even me they affect; I am as filled with them: The Happiness of Thousands, and Myriads
<PB N="90" REF="005510_0046_1018492E895392C0"/>
of Thousands, are abridged into one Happiness. And how discovering is the Light of thy Glory! I know every one of you in particular, as by Name, and what was your Lot on Earth. When our Converse is more joyful, shall not our Fellowship now be passing excel∣lent? The Faculties are great, the Objects are great, and great is Eternity, which we have ever before us in our Fellowship: We are not confined, as on Earth, to Days, Hours and Years; but shall speak to one another of his infinite Excellencies again and again and more and more, and for ever speak: And what new Delights, since Earth's childish Dialect is done away! Words, Sentences, Orations, and Volumes, were as dark Shadows, of little or no Signification: But O the profound Idiom of Im∣manuel's Country! Every Word is like a Talent, repre∣senting more than Ten thousand excellent Volumes, in Earth's Language. How admirably do Mortality and Immortality differ in all Things! Cry out then his match∣less Praises; Shall we not contend, who shall speak most excellently of his Glory? shall we not be for ever recoun∣ting his wonderful Goodness to us, in Time and Eterni∣ty? O ravishing Fellowship with Men and Angels! O more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han ravishing Voice of the Son of God! Were it not the Prerogative of Glory, that one Enjoyment cannot divert from another, I should for ever shut all my Fa∣culties against you, O Fellow-Creatures, that they might only be filled with JESUS my only WELBELOVED, whatever I enjoy, still I enjoy thee perfectly and fully; with whomsoever I converse, <HI>continually I am with thee.</HI> Thou art the Beginning, Middle, and End of all. O the eternal high Tides of Joys in my Heart! Nothing can separate me, in the least, from this immediate Enjoyment of thee. The Members are not hindered from receiving Influences from the Head, because of their mutual Com∣merce among themselves; reflex Rays hinder not the di∣rect; the enjoyment of the Thing <HI>included</HI> eminently, hinders not the Enjoyment of that which <HI>includes.</HI> I en∣joy
<PB N="91" REF="005510_0046_1018492E895392C0"/>
Thee; and therefore I enjoy all Things; and my En∣joyment of Creatures, is no new Enjoyment, but another Manner of enjoying of Thee; like the beholding the Light of the Sun darting from the Moon: Every one of us re∣flects the Beauty, <HI>wherewith thou adornest us.</HI></P>
<P N="41">41. <HI>All the Attributes of God contribute to our eternal Blessedness, but His Unchangeableness is the Crown of all.</HI></P>
<P>How do all smile with a ravishing Countenance, whether we view in Time on Earth, these present Enjoyments; or their Flourishing throughout Eternity? The Conside∣ration of God's wonderful Providence in Time, will fill the Thoughts with enless Admiration. And am I not ravished, in looking back into infinite Perfections, be∣fore all Ages? Here there is ever a Further; but 'tis ac∣cording to finite Conception, to look upon Thee, as <HI>past, present</HI> and <HI>to come.</HI> Thou art eminently all Things, yet not formally, and in their own proper Nature: We change every Moment, and have still new Actings; be∣cause we are <HI>finite</HI> Beings: But with thee there <HI>is no Va∣riableness, nor Shadow of Turning.</HI> Whatever thou dost, from Eternity thou dost it: Thy Actings have neither Beginning, Middle, nor Ending; Which are but one simple Act, the same with thy Self, tho', virtually and e∣quivalently, it contains in its Bosom innumerable Actions; even as thy Everlastingness, innumerable Days, Years and Ages. Who can admire enough thy Simplicity? All thy Excellencies are but one Excellency, equivalent unto in∣finite Worlds of Excellencies. O what a blessed Life have we, Men and Angels, <HI>in dwelling in God,</HI> the Almigh∣ty, Alsufficient JEHOVAH! in whom is contained infi∣nite Varieties of all Joys, all Pleasures, all Sweetness, all Contentments, all Beauties, all Glories, in a transcendent, eminent, and most perfect Manner. O happy I! who have such an infinite One, boundless One in all Perfections, to be my Portion! O thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, eternal, unchange∣able
<PB N="92" REF="005510_0047_1018493070A82188"/>
in thy Wisdom, Power, Holiness, Justice, Goodness and Truth. Everlasting Ravishments! He, who loveth us, is <HI>unchangeable</HI>; He, in whom we trust, is the <HI>Rock of Ages,</HI> whose <HI>Goings forth have been from Eternity.</HI> O then! thy Smiles are everlasting. Our Happiness is eternal; it is Joy upon Joy, to consider, this Life can have no Pe∣riod: It hath neither Middle, Progress nor Ending; But shall ever be a Beginning, and shall be ever, ever alike far from the Period of my Joys and Happiness, ever in this same ravished unspeakable Frame of divine Love and Joy, I am just now into! Shall it ever be high Tide? O more than Happiness! It overflows its Banks: It is much I bear this Joy! O my Joys, my Joys, you are of an immortal Duration! O my excellent Welbeloved, now hast thou with Eternity crowned all my Happiness! To think ever to be disjoined from thee, would imbit∣ter all the present Sweetness: The greater the Enjoy∣ment, the greater the Loss. Temporary Enjoyments no∣thing affect me: What will end, will be as if it had not been. Never so many Ages are nothing in the Minds of elevated Creatures: Only Fruits are taken with Time. Nothing is real and substantial, but what is enduring. Nothing vain and empty now: All Things here shall be ever in the self-same State, we are now in. So are all Things in Hell also. The Fashion of this World shall never pass away: All are now solid and enduring: Vani∣ty is for ever banished out of the Universe; all Things shall be for ever as they are. O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Joys! tho' you were low, yet the Thoughts of your e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernal Permanency may cause you to swell over your Banks. O Glory, Glory! how massie art thou? Not a Thing glistering now, and anon evanished. O the more enduring Substance! The King∣dom immoveable! These everlasting Arms incircle us eter∣nally! For <HI>the Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to all Generations.</HI> We <HI>that trust in the Lord, are like Mount</HI> Zion, <HI>that cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e removed, but abid∣eth for ever. The Glory of the Lord shall endure for e∣ver:
<PB N="93" REF="005510_0047_1018493070A82188"/>
He shall rejoice in all his Works. The Children of thy Servants shall continue, and their Seed shall be established before thee: With long Life dost thou satisfy them, and shewest them thy Salvation. Thou art the Strength of their Heart, and their Portion for ever.</HI> O real, solid, sub∣stantial, enduring Portion! Indeed, thou art the <HI>Rock of Ages.</HI> All the innumerable Ages past, present, and to come, do roll upon thee, as their Foundation. <HI>Thy Years are throughout all Generations: Of old didst thou lay the Foundations of the Earth; and the Heavens were the Work of thine Hands: They did perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all of them waxed old, like a Garment; as a Vesture thou changed them, and they were changed: But thou art the same, and thy Tears shall have no End.</HI> O my passing Happiness shall have no End! O Life, and Marrow of Joys! I shall be ever with thee, O most lovely WELBELOVED! Some transient Glimpses of thy Loveliness upon my Soul, was an Heaven upon Earth: But O, the permanent and full Outlettings of thy Beauty, Sweetness, and all Excel∣lencies, are more than Ten thousand Heavens of Happi∣ness! I am here dwelling within the boundless Circle of E∣ternity! O sweet for evermore! only because of my sweet∣est Welbeloved, whom I fully &amp; eternally enjoy! What Good would my Life do unto me, were I not to enjoy him, throughout eternal Ages? Not, that I account it not an invaluable Happiness, to receive one Love-kiss, and no more, from thy sweetest Mouth: Should not its won∣derful Impression leave a passing ravishing Sweetness, throughout endless EVERMORE? One Sight of thy only excellent Beauty, one Smell of thy ravishing fragrant Garments, one Love-smile of thy overcoming lovely Face, transcendently excels the Height of all Creature-Enjoy∣ments. Any Thing of Thee, my matchless ONE, is of incomparable Excellency: Thy very Frowns are incon∣ceivably sweet, because thine.</P>

<P>Thy Kingdom, O <HI>Emmanuel,</HI> is an everlasting King∣dom; the Sceptre of Glory dost thou sway to all Gene∣rations. Indeed, when Time and Days come to a Period, and thou hadst put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power, thou delivered up the Commission of governing the Church, and (in Part) bringing the World back to thy Father; and art subject as Days Man betwixt God and Creatures, that God may only fill the Faculties of Men and Angels, with his uncreated Sweetness: Yet, as Days-Man, thou art for ever King, Priest and Prophet of thy Chosen; the eternal Head of Men and Angels; <HI>The First-born among many Brethren, having the Prehemi∣nency in all Things</HI>: Thou art the great Lord Mediator, the crowned King of <HI>Zion,</HI> for ever and ever: We are under Thee so many crowned Kings in <HI>Zion</HI>: But thou art exalted above all; upon the Throne of thy Father <HI>Da∣vid</HI> dost thou sit; <HI>and of thy Kingdom there shall be no End.</HI> The Lord <HI>hath laid Help upon One that is Mighty, he hath exalted One chosen out of the People; He hath made Him his First-born, higher than the Kings of the Earth: His Mercy doth he keep for him, for ever; and his Cove∣nant standeth fast with him: His Seed also hath he made to endure for ever, and his Children as the Days of Hea∣ven: All Kings fall down before him; all Nations serve him. There is an handful of Corn in the Earth, on the Top of the Mountains; the Fruit thereof doth shake like Lebanon: And they of the City do flourish like the Grass of the Earth. O PLANT of RENOWN,</HI> Men and An∣gels are as so many Branches ingrafted in Thee eternal∣ly! or else we should in a Moment wither. To all Eter∣nity we stand in Need of a Days-Man; we are not able eternally to stand on our own Legs; neither are we able to behold God so fully and familiarly, as in the Face of <HI>EMMANUEL,</HI> the White and the Ruddy! And what a∣mazing Dignity, Men and Angels, for us to reign over all,
<PB N="95" REF="005510_0048_1018493333D76878"/>
as Co-heirs with this essential Heir of all Things? Do I reign with thee, <HI>O KING</HI> of Kings? Wonderful! Thou hast given me <HI>Power over the Nations, and I do rule them with a Rod of Iron; as the Vessels of a Potter are they bro∣ken in Shivers</HI>; even as he received of his Father! What were earthly Kingdoms and Principalities, but evanishing Vapors, Night-dreams and Vanities? What were the <HI>Shields of the Earth,</HI> but Bits of half-dead Clay, breathing for a few Hours, Days and Years, at the most, and then re∣turned to Dust again? No Wonder he loaded the basest of Men with the greatest Portion of thick Clay: Such a Dunghil was a fit Portion for <HI>Dunghil-worms</HI>: No won∣der he gave so little of Earth to his Chosen; such Gifts are below sublime, heavenly and Divine Spirits. Sirs, have we not been ordained for far better, and more ex∣cellent Things than Earth's silly Glory? It was not our Father's Will we should be troubled with many Nothings: Much Clay would have clogged us, in our Way. He knew best what was for us, who cut us short of Creature-Enjoyments. What have we lost, who have received Gold for Clay, Diamonds for common Stones, solid Sa∣tisfaction for vexing Vanities, Heaven for Earth, Eterni∣ty for Time, all Things for nothing? All Glory to him, that sits upon the Throne, and the Lamb. Let the Crown eternally flourish on the Head of the Purchaser of such su∣perabundant Happiness. O the great Things we have esca∣ped? O the great Things we have attained! And were these Joys purchased by Sorrow? This golden Life, by a shame∣ful and cruel Death? This Glory, by Shame and Contempt? This Rest, by Labour and Wrestling? This Exaltation, by Lowliness and Submission? O the Price, the Price! Every Sight of the Man who is God, would overvalue, and over∣buy Ten thousand excellent Worlds. O my Happiness! Art thou not of infinite Value, tho' thou wert not, in the thou∣sand Part, what thou art? <HI>What can we render unto the Lord for his wonderful Goodness?</HI> What can we, thy eternal∣ly bound Dyvours, do but cry aloud, Thy Excellency?

And, the more we praise thee, the more our Obligation grows upon our Hand. O, let us ever, in this Manner, run our selves into thy Debt. No greater Liberty, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> higher Prerogative, than to be eternally obliged Debt on to thy free Grace, redeeming, exalting Grace. O then! shall I not praise thee, my Redeemer, my Exalter? Shall not boundless Eternity be filled with thy Praises? Is my Happiness, Life-immortal? And shall not my Praising be immortal also? O this high, high praising Frame! No∣thing but ravishing Hallelujahs throughout Eternity. O Sirs, is not this Frame altogether inexpressible, wholly inconceivable?</P>
<P N="43">43. <HI>The Manifestation of God, in Time, nothing to that of Eternity; and that of Eternity, nothing to what dwells hidden in Himself.</HI></P>
<P>Even the small Breathings of these full Gales of the Spirit, that blow strongly in this higher Region, falling down upon the Land of Grace, filled my Heart with such passing Sweetness, that I could not but cry out, Lord, <HI>my Heart is fixed, my Heart is fixed, I will sing Praise unto thee.</HI> O let all Creatures, in all Places of thy Dominion, sing forth thy Excellencies. Let me behold thy Name set on high, and the Desires of my Soul are accomplished. I am ravished, I am ravished with thy surpassing Sweetness, thy overcoming Love∣liness! Is not this Heaven, even Glory come down to Grace's Region? Or, what can Glory be more? But now, now I clearly find, these have been but the first Fruits, some Drops falling off this boundless Ocean; and no Wonder little seemed exceeding great to a little Child; then I could not be capable of Glory, in the Perfection and Bloom thereof. The Ground sufficient to bear a Tree, in its first arising thro' the Earth, would not be able to bear the least Branch when it attained its perfect Pitch. Yet the Remembrance of thy Ways to me, in my Childhood, is full of Delectation. How thou hast

bro't thy Sons to Glory, is an eternal Wonder! O to think of the wonderful Discoveries of thy self to weak Mortals! whence Thou evidenced, that thou couldst shew forth thine Excellency by Weakness and Emptiness, Did I not sometimes, even when a blockish Mortal live rather by Sight, than Faith? O the strange Disco∣veries of thy infinite Beauty! from whence arose high flaming Love, then Zeal, for setting Thee on high, far above all. Continually were thy Praises in my Mouth; I desired, that all I tho't, spake, or did, should tend to thy Glory, <HI>for whom are all Things.</HI> How tormen∣ted was I, to see so few on Earth, for extolling Thee! To see almost <HI>All minding their own Things,</HI> and very few Thine. How vexed was I, that my Heart was so shallow, and my Faculties so unfit for glorifying Thee? Therefore did I long to be here, for nothing more than to praise Thee aright, before this glorious Assembly of Men and Angels. How oft have I been crying out, O to be an Instrument of his superexcellent Glory! Let me be eternally confounded, (abstract from sinning) if thereby his Excellency may be manifested. What are all Creatures to him? Let him be exalted, let him be praised, tho' we all should be abased for evermore. O the inexpressible Sweetness, my Soul finds in praising Thee! In the Bosom of this Divine Exercise is contained a great Reward. It is both the Work and the Wages. It is Happiness to extol Thee; it is only Hell, not to be for thy Glory. <HI>O praise him,</HI> for ever <HI>praise him, all his Works.</HI> It is a light Thing that thou alone shouldst praise Him, O silly I! O when shall I stand among the innu∣merable Assembly of Praisers, and tell, and hear told over thine Acts, and Glory, and Wisdom, and infinite Excellencies forever and ever! Verily all thy Promises are <HI>Yea,</HI> and <HI>Amen,</HI> to those who put their Trust in Thee. Thou hast given unto me all the Desires of my Heart: Now, O now, I am in the Land of Praises, in to Midst of you, O glorious Creatures, who for ever
<PB N="98" REF="005510_0050_1018493A07DD8CC0"/>
sing forth <HI>Hallelujahs,</HI> to <HI>Him</HI> that sits upon the Throne, and the <HI>Lamb.</HI> It was but the Weakness of mortality caused small Stirrings to appear high and mighty Over∣flowings. O Glory, Glory! Thou art indeed substantial and massie. Since Glory cannot fully delineate thy Ex∣cellency, I behold thy amiable Countenance to the full, O God of Glory; and O then the Enlargement of my Heart! O then, the wonderful Flames of Love! Nothing was known, was felt; until now: I have heard some Rumor of Thee; but now I behold and perceive, that all possible Creatures, exalted to the highest Pitch of Excellency, can never be able to praise thee to the full: Even because of this, I will praise Thee, that Thou art infinitely above all Praises. Were thou not infinite, Thou shouldst not be the eternal Object of my Praises: Crea∣ted Enjoyments cannot satiate for ever. How am I over∣joyed, Thou hast thus fitted me for setting Thee on high! How am I lifted up in my Capacity, almost infinite Stages above the highest Pitch of Mortality! Sirs, This is ano∣ther Manner of Praising than was to be found within Mor∣tality's Tents: Our Songs can only be learned by these who have attained the Height of wisdom; even who are <HI>filled with all the Fulness of God.</HI> What are finite Things in the Way of our Conceptions? We are past from the low Conceptions of Mortals: Earth's putid Idiom, in its highest Strain, composed &amp; divided by all possible Ways, or portrayed down in as many Books as would fill the Creation, should not express in the thousandth Part, so much of the Excellency of our never-enough exalted One, as one Sentence of this Song of Glory. What is expressed by dull Sound, or tuned out in Black and White, is not now worth the Noticing; yet, had I no other Way of ex∣pressing thy Excellency, before Men and Angels, I should for ever and ever be writing Songs of thy match∣less Praises, that all the Beholders might, in some Mea∣sure, conjecture the high Tho'ts of my Heart. Were there Oceans of Ink greater than Ten thousand Worlds, and Paper and Pens conformable thereunto, I should soon
<PB N="99" REF="005510_0050_1018493A07DD8CC0"/>
exhaust them, in writing new Songs of thy matchless Praises; and yet the Thoughts of my elevated Heart should not in the least be diminished; but should be, like an eternal Fountain, ever inditing new Matter, ever sending forth new Streams of Praises. What Wonder? I am filled with thine Image: I behold thee Face to Face, and therefore see more and more of Thee to all Eternity. Ever, ever shall I have new Discoveries, &amp; yet for ever shall I have the same; <HI>for I behold Thee as Thou art.</HI> What Wonder we are in such an high praising Frame, O blessed Ones! who, being framed so capacious, to re∣ceive the full Emanations of his infinite Glory and Sweetness, stand continually in his immediate Fellowship? Are we not ravished in praising? 'Tis the only Happi∣ness to be thus exercised; The only Misery, to have the Faculties exercised in other Things. No Monster to a Creature careless of thy Glory! You abominable Prodi∣gies of Nature, who are not for extolling your Creator, Preserver and Benefactor, Can the Desperateness of your State be told? Should you not praise him, eternally praise him? He is the Potter, you are the Clay; He is the absolute Sovereign, you his eternal bound Vassals: All that you are, and have, is of him: If you are mise∣rable, it is only of your selves: Nothing from Him, but that which is good. He is a pure Mass of Holiness, Excellency and Desirableness. O cursed! O desperate! O astonishing Frame! to have the Heart hardned against the Original of all Joys and Blessedness. Thousand Times happy I, who am thus, thus conformed unto the Divine Nature! O this sweet, sweet Frame of Heart I am alto∣gether for Praises: This is the Land of Praises; the whole Assembly resounds with Praises. O my blessed Ears! which are eternally filled with the melodious Raptures of <HI>Emmanuel's</HI> ravishing World. Is it possible Sorrows can enter here? All is filled with superabounding Joys: Every where thy Beauty is fully manifested. Let us dive deep, and look, and look again, ever shall we find new

Matter for Love-Songs. Doth not a sweet willing Con∣straint lie upon us to praise Thee? Inundations of all Goodness do flow out from thee, O inexhaustable Ocean of all Excellency: And must they not incessantly run back to Thee again? Yea, who can but extol Thee, O alsufficient JEHOVAH? because Thou art essentially beautiful and excellent. What tho' little of thy Good∣ness were let forth on Creatures? the Manifestation of thy Goodness to Creatures adds just Nothing to Thee: Whether Thou create or not create one Creature, on a World, or Millions of Worlds, all is the same to Thee. Thou art infinitely above the Praises, or the Blasphemies of Creatures. Thy Glory is unchangeable; before all Ages did thy infinite Perfections shine forth, in the same infinite Splendor; So that, in the Fulness of Time, when it pleased Thee, to shew forth thy Glory, in the Produc∣tion and Adorning of finite Beings, nothing in the least was added to thy boundless Excellency: Thy Creating was the Manifestation of what was from Eternity; not the bringing forth of what was not at all: As when the Sun should dart forth his Light, which before he kept within himself; or a Box of precious Ointment, when broken, exhales a Perfume, which before lie hidden.</P>
<P>And what hast Thou manifested on Creatures, to that which thou might'st, if so it had pleased thy Sovereign Will!

What are these Handful of Creatures, unto these vast numberless Armies, eminently contained within the Compass of thine infinite Power? whence, thy Dominion over Things that are not created, is greater, than over Things that are. From all Eternity hadst Thou the Sovereign Disposition of all possible Beings, and they are for ever at thy Beck. Hadst Thou never determined to create any Creature, Thy Power and Sovereignty should ever have shined forth in as full a Splendor, in order to these self-same
<PB N="101" REF="005510_0051_101849B2F42F6FA0"/>
Creatures existent, as now it doth: To restrain a Being from existing, or to cause it exist, are alike Acts of in∣finite Sovereignty. Men and Angels, shall we not cry up the Incomprehensible Excellency of our God? What can we contribute even to his declarative Glory? Are we any Thing, to the Infinite Armies in the Womb of his Omnipotency? and yet hath He appointed us the only Criers up of his Praises; the only Spectators, through∣out all Ages. O how inconceivable are thy Ways! Hast Thou chosen these few out from among innumerable Ar∣mies of Excellent Creatures, contain'd within the Bosom of thy Excellency? Might'st Thou not have Numberless Worlds of Men and Angels just now serving Thee, and not one of us existent? How is absolute Sovereignty, and free Grace to be seen every Where? Creation is an Act of free Grace and Goodness. O thou whole Han∣dy-Work of God, how oughtest Thou to praise thy So∣vereign Lord? You Sun, Moon and Stars, for ever exalt him, who conferred upon you an everlasting Being, passing by infinite Numbers of others; and only you hath He chosen, as never-ending Monuments of his tran∣scendent Excellency. Thou Earth, with thy various Beauties, praise thy bountiful Creator, who hath appoin∣ted thee an eternal Monument of his Justice and Mercy, passing by innumerable possible Ones. O thou glorious and majestick Heavens, sing forth the high Praises of thy Almighty Former; tho' thou art the Top and Flower-excellency of this vast All, what art thou to these innu∣merable possible Heavens, Jehovah could produce? Thou whole Creation, tho' thou art exact in Number, Weight and Measure, what art thou to what Incomprehensible Jehovah can effect? What are you, O all ye Creatures? you are infinitely every Way within the Limits of his in∣finite Power; yea, tho' it were not so, one Blast of his Nostrils, could confound you to nothing in a Moment.

This is the only World God hath been pleased to make; from Eternity to Eternity there is no other; neither shall this undergo Changes any more: How sweet a Savour doth the Almighty smell? pronouncing that the <HI>Vicissitudes of Day and Night, Seed-Time and Harvest, Winter and Summer shall for ever cease</HI>; and that an eternal Spring-tide, an end∣less Summer, an incessant Harvest shall remain.

blessed Counsel of Eternity! that chose us in him <HI>before the Foundation of the World; having predestinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Jesus Christ unto him∣self, according to the good Pleasure of his Will, to the Praise of the Glory of his Grace; wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved: Having made known unto us the Mystery of his Will, according to his good Pleasure, which he had purposed in himself; that in the Dispensa∣tion of the Fulness of Time, he might gather together in one all Things, in Christ, both which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth.</HI> It was not thy Purpose, Dread Sove∣reign, that any should inherit Glory, through their own Obedience: A World of Working was but for a Time that this of altogether free Grace might shine forth more gloriously. Free Grace's Banner is the only Pavilion, we should for ever abide under. How greatly did the Devil befool himself, in endeavouring to obscure the Glo∣ry of his Maker, by the Rebellion of Man? Was he not herein an Instrument in the Hand of the great Sovereign, whereby He made Way for his chief and only Purpose? What should our Blessedness have been, to what now it is, if we had wanted thee, O <HI>EMMANUEL,</HI> the <HI>Man of God's right Hand,</HI> the very <HI>Breath of our Nostrils</HI>? Our eternal Songs should not have been so melodious; the Praises of free redeeming Grace should not have been heard here: <HI>Glory to the Lamb,</HI> that was slain, and lives for ever, should never have been sung. No Worlds to this World! No Happiness to this Happiness! This is the Flower and Top of all possible Dispensations! Here is a Confluence of innumerable Providences, that shall never be comprehended. <HI>Many,</HI> O LORD my God, <HI>are thy wonderful Works, which thou hast done; and thy Thoughts which are to us-ward, they cannot be reckoned up in Order to thee.</HI> How evidently do I now see, that thy Love passeth all Understanding; that thy Ways are in∣numerable, and thy Thoughts unsearchable? My Eyes are eternally fixed upon thee, O Flower of all Beauty and

Loveliness; thou art the Centre whereto all Desirableness and Excellency betakes itself: In beholding thee, I be∣hold all Things. Art thou not Love, discovered to the Full? Mercy manifested, in its highest Perfection? Judg∣ment and Righteousness visibly, in its full Splendor? What have we, which is not in thee? And what can Crea∣tures want, which is not in thee? Shall we not, O En∣joyers, be satiate, beautified, ravished, blessed, for evermore, with that infinite Fulness of all Excellency, which dwells in him? We behold, to the Full, <HI>thy Glory, as the Glory of the only begotten Son of the Father, full of Grace and Truth</HI>: And <HI>of thy Fulness have we all received, and Grace for Grace.</HI> We have received thy Testimony, have set to our Seal that God is true; That thou, whom he sent into the World, speakest the Things of God: For <HI>He giveth not the Spirit by Measure unto thee.</HI> O how great is the Mystery of Godliness, <HI>God manifested in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory!</HI> If this was wonderful in Time, is it not ten thousand Times more now, when the bright Day of Eternity hath broken up? If a Sight of this, by Faith, was ravi∣shing; am I not now passed all the Limits of such Moti∣ons? O this Frame! O Glory, Glory! thou art massie indeed!</P>

To have enjoyed thee, according to the first Dispensation, had been unspeakable Happiness; but to be chosen in Christ, is overflowing Happiness! O! were we predestinate to be conformed to the Image of the

Son, which in Time was begun, and now is perfected? Any Tincture of thee, O Welbeloved, any Perfume of thy Garments, is passing glorious and excellent. O then, thousand Times blessed I! who am clothed with the Robes of thy Righteousness, the Garments of thy Beauty; who am satiate with thy Likeness, filled with thy Sweet∣ness, adorned with thy Loveliness, decked with thy ra∣vishing Graces. I am like thee, I am like thee! Here is all my Happiness. This, thy ravishing Image, was be∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in me, in Time; and now thou hast brought it to the high Bloom and Perfection. What passing Joys! to think how thou hast made me grow up, from my Childhood, to this manly Constitution: How hast thou been making me grow up until thou transplantedst me from thy lower Garden of Grace, to thy higher Paradise of Glory! Once I was a small Shrub, scarce discernable from the base Thorns and Briers, that overgrew the Earth: But now I am thro' thy infinite Excellency, a mighty and flou∣rishing Cedar, in this higher <HI>Lebanon.</HI> Strange! now, thou hast brought me to this glorious Condition; and still from lesser to greater, until I have arrived at Per∣fection! Is it not most evident, that <HI>the Path of the Just is as the shining Light, that shineth more and more, until the perfect Day?</HI> Tho' our <HI>Beginning was small,</HI> yet our <HI>latter End is greatly increased</HI>: Our Beginning was full of Ignorance and Infirmity; now our Age is clearer than the Noon-day. We shine forth as the Morning! Thou hast <HI>brought forth our Righteousness as the Light, and our Judgment as the Noon-day.</HI> And thus hath been thy Way, in all thy Proceedings. How small was thy Church in the Beginning? How few in Number among the numerous Multitude of Mankind? Yet, how didst thou increase and multiply her, as the Sand in the Sea-shore, in Despite of Devils and wicked Men? And appearedst thou not, O Welbeloved, as a <HI>small Stone, cut out without Hands?</HI> And yet hast become great and filled all. Thou shewedst thy self, at thy first Manifestation in the Flesh, unto the

Sons of Men, <HI>in the Form of a Servant</HI>; So that thou waft of no Reputation in the Eyes of a stupid World, who are only affected with external Shews: How didst thou make thy Gospel to go through the World, without any earth∣ly Pomp or Observation? So that the wise Men of the World, for a long Time, did little notice it; yet, did thy Name break forth before all Nations: The whole World spake of thy Glory. It had been a <HI>light Thing,</HI> that thou shouldst only have <HI>raised up the Tribes of</HI> Jacob; but thy God did also give thee for a <HI>Light to the</HI> Gentiles, that thou mightst be his <HI>Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth.</HI> When Darkness did cover the Earth, and <HI>gross Darkness the People,</HI> thou filledst them with thy Glory, and madest the Place <HI>of thy Feet glorious:</HI> For the LORD sent the <HI>Rod of thy Strength out of</HI> Zion, and caused thee <HI>to rule in the Midst of thine Enemies,</HI> and made <HI>thy People willing in the Day of thy Power; and at thy right Hand did strike through Kings in the Day of his Wrath</HI>: Thou <HI>judged a∣mong the Heathen</HI>; Thou <HI>filled the Places with the dead Bodies</HI>; Thou <HI>woundedst the Heads over many Countries.</HI> How vain hath the Judgment of Worldlings proved, who despised the Seeds of Glory, sown in the Hearts of the Chosen? They considered not the Noon-day Brightness, succeeding the Dawning. Fools! were only taken with what filled the external Senses: Transitory Glory was a <HI>dying Blaze.</HI> It is gone, eternally gone! The Bastard's Portion did flourish, and seem to eclipse the Childrens for a Moment; because it was then the <HI>Bastard's Harvest,</HI> but the <HI>Children's Seed time</HI>: Because thou wouldst shew thou couldst lead thy Chosen, in their weak and childish Estate, into this Kingdom through Fighting, and Wrestling, and great Opposition of all Kinds: Whereby our eternal Song is drawn up higher, in exalting thy Wonderful Provi∣dence, in bringing us to Glory. What astonishing Things do I behold, concerning my Pilgrimage, which then I could not perceive! O Time! Time! thou fills Eternity with Admiration. Wonderful! thou brought us not

hither at the first Production of our Beings: And was an Inch of Time a <HI>Prelude</HI> to Eternity? Did a Moment's Fighting usher in an eternal Triumphing? A Life of Faith, a Life of Beholding? A small Intercourse by Let∣ters and Love-tokens, an eternal, full, and naked Enjoy∣ment? O wonderful! O sweet Dispensation! O pleasant Conspiration of divers Providences, and all linked toge∣ther in the most comely Order! What an excellent Con∣nection, between Time and Eternity? What Joy, to be viewing them both at once, and comparing them toge∣ther? It is wonderful! to consider the Difference betwixt the Workings of thy Spirit upon me now, and then, toge∣ther! Was it not the Day-star, that arose then in my Heart? Now all is fully illuminated. I am placed under the full Rays of thy Glory. How is this Being of mine filled with thy Divine Nature? All is perfected! O my elevated Faculties! All my Accomplishments in Time, are so perfected, as they are swallowed up; And so may be said to be done away, as a small Drop, by the Approach of a vast Ocean. What higher Happiness, than thus to resemble thee, O Fulness of all Happiness! O everflou∣rishing Estate of Joys! Every Moment is a golden Life, every Day is ten thousand Heavens of Blessedness.</P>

<P>This is the Day of our King's <HI>Espousals,</HI> and the Day of the <HI>Gladness of his Heart</HI>: This is the Day we longed, prayed, sighed, weeped and wrestled for. And may not every Minute obliterate Millions of Millions of Ages of Sorrow and tormenting Labour? This is the Day wherein it is ever Morn, ever Noon-day; but never a declining Shade. You Sorrows, you Griefs, you Labours, you can∣not enter this thrice blessed <HI>Day of Eternity!</HI> It is our <HI>Marriage-Day,</HI> the Day of the Gladness of our Hearts.

Consummation of the Match betwixt our glorious <HI>Bride∣groom</HI> and us. In Time we were betrothed unto him, by the Mediation of his Ambassadors, and there passed Love-tokens as a Seal of the Willingness of Parties, and such were sufficient until the full Accomplishment. Now, O Now! are we met together, in this majestick <HI>Marriage-hall of Glory,</HI> prepared for the Solemnizing of this eter∣nal Marriage. All are now in the <HI>Marriage-robes.</HI> At∣tendants of the Bridegroom, you are majestickly arrayed, as it well becomes the Ministers of so magnificent a Prince. O how doth the Father of the Prince, the Bridegroom, appear in his Glory, and Majesty! What wonderful Ma∣nifestations of JEHOVAH are here? and how is the BRIDEGROOM adorned? O my Head and Husband! How hast thou arrayed thyself in thy royal and gorgeous Apparel? Thou appearest indeed like a Prince, in his <HI>Marriage-day!</HI> O but thy Raiment is far changed! Thou hast cast from Thee the base Garb of <HI>Mortality,</HI> that in a great Part obscured thy matchless Glory and Loveliness, and hast decked thy Self with ravishing <HI>Divine Majesty</HI> and Loveliness, as with a <HI>Garment.</HI> Thou sought and <HI>wooed thy Bride</HI> in a low and contemptible Equipage; Thou madest it known thou couldst draw Hearts to Thee in the most low and despicable Condition: It would not have been so wonderful, if thou hadst allured, and gained Consent, appearing in thy royal and majestick Estate. But here is the Wonder! yet, no Wonder: Since Lowness, Weakness, Shame and Contempt, cannot but change their Nature, and become Exaltation, Vigour, Glory and Re∣nown; if once Thou assume them. But now, Thou art altogether gloriously arrayed, sutable to the <HI>Person</HI> and the <HI>Day.</HI> O the Beauty! O the ravishing Perfume of thine <HI>Apparel!</HI> All thy <HI>Garments smell of Myrrhe, Aloes &amp; Cas∣sia,</HI> out of the <HI>Ivory Palaces,</HI> whereby they have made thee glad. The very Perfume of his Raiment is two Hea∣vens! What Sweetness then, to stand within the Place filled with such ravishing Fragrancy. But O! to be ever thus,

in an eternal Act of Marrying, Espousing, Embracing, Kissing, and full Communications of Love, is ten thousand Lives of Satisfaction, ten thousand Worlds of perfect Blessedness, all beaten in one Mass. Who but CHRIST, and US! How hath he arrayed us, according to his Grandeur and Excellency? All is embroidered with Gold and Gems; every Diamond, every Rubie, every Sapphire transcends, by innumerable Stages, the Sun of the lower World, shining in his Strength. And doth not this great ALL appear in joyful Apparel, as befitting the Es∣pousals of so glorious a COUPLE? All Things dance and sound forth melodiously, our <HI>Epithalamium.</HI> What a Life is this? ever to be Marrying! ever to be at the Marriage-Feast! ever to be entring the Bed of Love! This Feast is furnished with all Delights, it ravishes every Moment, and throughout all Eternity! O what Variety! O what Efficacy in every Delicate! Every one doth forever satiate: and yet Delights are ever renewed! This Land is nothing but a Table furnished with all A∣bundance of Fruits always. All Milk, all Spices, all Delights, every where superabound eternally. And in what a ravishing Manner art thou ever inviting! <HI>Eat, O Friends, drink yea drink abundantly, O Beloved</HI>: Drink and drink again, and forever drink. This is a Day of Gladness and Rejoicing; this is the Day of the Accom∣plishment of all our Desires. The POMP of this Day is glorious indeed! Verily, my GOD, Thou hast made us as happy as can be! This Dispensation transcends in∣conceivably all other! This Delight and Love is ever blooming and green! O this sweet and delightsom Bed of Love! One Sight and Smell of it, afar off, is ravishing. How is it all strewed over with ever-flourishing, and o∣verflowing Roses and Lilies; with infinite Kinds of odo∣riferous and beautiful Flowers of infinite Virtues? All my Faculties are filled, and overfilled with all Manner of Delights and Sweetness! Is not this Wine of Glory, O Enjoyers, of wonderful Efficacy? who can endure to

pull the Cup from the Mouth? and yet every Draught doth satiate to the full. And is it not endowed with all possible Vertues? Do not its Spirits fill all the Faculties and Powers with an immortal Vigour; an unspeakable Sweetness, and surpassing Joys? Great Things hast thou prepared, O WELBELOVED, far above all our Concep∣tions! What shall be my never-ending Exercise, but to be satiate and ravished with thine uncreated Sweetness? If my Closing with Thee, tho' absent, was passing joy∣ful, how shall I now rejoice, and exult, in solemnizing the BARGAIN, in satiating my self for ever with fully-manifested LOVES, in this Bed of Love? The Wooing-time seemed small and inconsiderable; O the Marriage is wonderfully glorious and excellent! What esteemed a base World of thy great Call, when thou sent thine Am∣bassadors to call them unto this everlasting Supper? How did they slight such an astonishing Dispensation, as a well-invented Fancy, and turned themselves wholly to their Earthly Enjoyments, as being the only real Things, which affected their <HI>brutish Minds?</HI> Do you not now see your desperate Madness, O vile Worldlings? Is not your Ap∣prehension wonderfully changed? Did you slight the sweet Invitations of the Almighty, to such boundless Happiness? Well, you shall never taste it, through all Eternity. You have gotten your Choice, a momentany Enjoyment of Earth have you received: This boundless Joy you never cared for. If you have done wisely, re∣joice therein throughout Eternity. O happy I! that ever I gave up my Name into the Number of thy espou∣sed Ones! <HI>That ever Thou inclined my Heart to take Thee,</HI> for my Lord, Head and Husband! O blessed Choice! thousand Times blessed Choice! Had I known in Time, how happy a Bargain I had made, should I not have been overjoyed unto the Death? And was there such Difficulty, to get the Children of Men to say, <HI>Amen,</HI> to such an advantagious Bargain? Didst Thou knock, and knock again, O Welbeloved, at the Doors of our

Hearts, before we would heartily accept? didst Thou ar∣gument, beseech, threaten and weep for a Consent? Who would have thought, but one serious Invitation had been enough for all Mankind! O blockish Mortality! O stupid brutish Madness! Thou hast not Cause here to exalt thy self, O empty Self, who despised, and overlooked, so much this glorious Match: Who stood more out against these glorious Offers? Didst thou not <HI>play fast</HI> and <HI>loose</HI> with JESUS, as all others? When He saw, he could not prevail with thee, more than others, (all Mankind being alike in their Orignal) He put in his Hand by the <HI>Hole of the Door,</HI> and then caused <HI>thy Bowels be moved for him</HI>: He filled thine Heart, <HI>ere ever thou wast aware,</HI> with his overcoming Love and Sweetness. Thou wast hearing the Sound of this Gospel in a dead and natural Way, but he breathed upon all thy Faculties, and said unto thee, Live; and thou arose from the Dead, and heard, and saw Wonders in the Gospel, that blind stupid World∣lings could never perceive. Had he suffered thee to follow thy natural Inclinations, thou hadst marched on, to end∣less Destruction, contrary to all his loving Invitations. Nay, but since from Eternity he had chosen thee, of his own good Pleasure, out of the Mass of Mankind, He could not but manifest his Love to thee, in Time, in a special Manner; and therefore he past from Intreaty, to Ravish∣ments, and drew thee with such strong <HI>Cords of Love,</HI> that thou couldst not but yield. O my holy One, no Creature can resist thy overcoming Beauty: When thou dartest forth thy Love, all is set in a Flame; Hell and Death could not resist thee. Ever hast thou been drawing Sinners up to Heaven after thee, unto this great Marriage; and now we are all within the Bed of Love. Love! Nothing but ravishing Love! O what Looks of Love! Nothing but Kisses, but eternal Embraces! Men and Angels, is it pos∣sible we can be more happy? What can Creatures have more?

Nay, He is our Brother, near of Blood unto us; we will kiss, eternally kiss, and shall not be ashamed. Nay, He is our Husband, One with us, as he is One with the Father, One in Nature, Spirit, Mind and Affections: <HI>He is ours, and we are his.</HI> O what great Communications of Love shall we eternally be filled with! Are you not chanting forth <HI>Marriage-Songs,</HI> O ye Angels? are ye not foe ever inventing Love-Songs of your matchless Bridegroom, O ye Saints? O thou whole Creation of God, art thou not in a smiling exulting Posture? And is not all this Glory and Blessedness the Object of your Grief and Sorrow, vile Miscreants? are you gnashing your Teeth, through Torment and Sorrow, and Envy, when the whole Creation <HI>claps its Hands,</HI> for exceeding Joy? Is it not most just, that you are the <HI>Curse</HI> and the <HI>Derision</HI> of all? You judged your selves unworthy of this bound∣less Happiness, and are you not justly shut out from this joyful <HI>Marriage-Supper</HI> of the Lamb? No more crying, <HI>Come unto the Marriage</HI>: All is past and done, nothing to do; all Things continue in this very Condition they are in. O now, who but JEHOVAH and the LAMB! Who but the Lamb and his Spouse! who are now Masters of all, who are now the eternal <HI>Triumphers.</HI> Behold, Men and Angels, behold your King and Head, and Welbeloved, in his Robes-royal, with such a massie Diadem of Glory on his Majestick Head, as would crush in Pieces Ten thousand Myriads of Worlds: Every Ruby of his Crown transcends all Valuation; the Diamonds and Pearls for ever dazle the Eyes of the Beholders: All the Spectators are amazed &amp; confounded; they sparkle and ray forth Beauty and Loveliness thro'∣out all Generations. Is it possible you can restrain your Eyes, O Spectators! must not all your Faculties bend thither eternally? Who can express the Thoughts of his Heart? who can tell what he clearly beholds? who can

This Chariot is of <HI>the Wood of Lebanon, the Pillars thereof are of Silver, the Bottom of Gold, the Covering of Purple; the Midst thereof being paved with Love for the Daughters of Jerusalem.</HI> Is not this a Majestick Chariot, that contains such a great Com∣pany of Kings and Priests? What a Life is this, thus to ride in the Chariot with the great King of Glory, whose Goings forth have been from Eternity! Is this the Honour of the Saints? Is this the Glory we heard, and spake so much of, on Earth? Is this the Ac∣complishment of my Expectations? This is more than ever I could ask, or think; thus to triumph, in at the Gates of this golden City, up and down its golden Streets, along the Border of this <HI>pure River of living Water,</HI> overshadowed with this delightsom <HI>Tree of Life</HI>! O astonishing Exaltation! O silly I, art thou not highly exalted! It was much thou couldst expect this, but more thou can bear it. One Beam of thine infinite Excellen∣cy, O my excellent Welbeloved, hath a wonderful Efficacy, that can render Dunghil Wretches of such sublime royal Spirits, as that they can carry, bravely, the highest Exaltation and Glory!

You Flower and Excellency of all Creature-beauty and Loveliness, you could not allure me, to leave, for one Moment, this ravishing Repose. This was a Counterpoise in all thy Difficulties through the Valley of Tears: The Fore-thoughts of this, added Strength and Courage in all thy Faintings and Infirmi∣ties: The Hope of this sweet Rest hath not been vain.

Had I had suitable Apprehensions thereof, how valiant had I been for the Truth upon the Earth? How should I ever contended to the uttermost, for the smallest Things of my WELBELOVED? How should I raised up against me the Tongues and Opprobries of the most excellent Saints on Earth? How should I have been so couragious, and zealous for his Interests, as that I should have proved <HI>a Man of Contention,</HI> in the purest Times? The Threat∣nings, Opprobries and Mockings of either Friend, or Foe, should have been Nothing regarded by me: But I should have so carried, that I should have scarce escaped capital Punishment, in the best of Times.

How should I have run and fought, and fought and run, ever with <HI>Joy unspeakable and glori∣ous?</HI> Can there be greater Blessedness, than to dwell within these Arms of Love; My Labour, my Grief, my Sorrow, hath been just nothing: One Moment's Repose in thy Bosom, sweetest Welbeloved, might swallow up Ten thousand Ages of all Labour, Pain and Sorrow.

How highly infinite Bounty can exalt; How wonderfully infinite Excellency can make beautiful and excellent! O my Faculties! you shall be ever filled with Astonishment: Ever satiated with his uncreated Sweetness! Can I suffer any Want in thy Bosom, O Fountain of Excellency? Shall I not be filled, whom am set down beside this Well of living Water, un∣der the Boughs of the Tree of Life, whose delicious Fruits are ever falling upon me? I am satiate with thy Love, my fair One; some Glimpses thereof on Earth, were ravishing, wonderfully above what the Abundance of <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> could produce: The Report of thine Excellency and Glory filled the Heart, with passing Sweet∣ness: Thy ravishing Emanations cannot be contained within this large Land: but had Influence upon the lower World, causing many of the Inhabitants to be deeply in Love with thee, whom they never saw; so that they re∣nounced the Love of all Things for thee, strove exceeding∣ly to be like thee, and please thee in all Things: Fought against all Opposition, endeavoured to the uttermost, for exalting thy Glory, and continued in a longing Frame, to behold thee Face to Face: And so remained faithful unto the Death. Thy Lovers are never satiate, till they

have thee in their Arms: The Enjoyment of thee afar off is ravishing sweet, &amp; cannot but cause the Beholder to run with all his Might, until he be at thee, even innected in thine eternal Embraces. O my Life, my Life! O sweet, sweet, sweet for evermore!</P>
<P N="51">51. <HI>The Life of Glory, the only Life, that overtops all other Lives, and swallows them up.</HI></P>
<P>All Creatures live according to the Capacity of their Being, but no Life to that which is Divine! The Animal Life is dead and dark, and without Efficacy and Beauty; the Intellectual is a low and base Thing: But this Life of Glory doth only excel all other Excellencies. All o∣ther Lives are swallowed up here! That which is in <HI>Part,</HI> and imperfect, is <HI>done away,</HI> by that which is the Perfection of Excellency. O my Lovely One, thou art in∣deed the Prince of Life! Thou art the Life of all the Inhabitants of this majestick City: Didst thou withdraw what thou hast communicated, should we not be so ma∣ny Lumps of Death and Deformity? Thou art my ALL in all, my fair One! Thou art my Life, and Vigour of all my Joys and Desires. That divine Life, by which thou eternally livest, hast thou breathed into me; so that I am become inconceivably above a living Soul, or an in∣tellectual Creature: This noble divine Life didst thou communicate unto me, in my dead and sensual Condition, but in a small Measure, that it was much obscured by Sin and Corruption; then being the Time of Childhood and Wrestling: But how hath it grown more &amp; more, until it hath overtoped, and swallowed up all other Lives; so that now I am filled with all thy Fulness? Even thy Na∣ture, thine Image, thine Excellency hast thou fully im∣pressed upon me: So that, as thou art, so am I. O secure Estate! I Christ is my Life; is not then my Life eternal? My Life lies in the Fountain; and shall it not be ever in its Vigour and full Strength? Other Lives are like small Drops, separated from the Ocean, and may vanish: How
<PB N="133" REF="005510_0067_10184960EDE84608"/>
soon did animal, rational and intellectual Lives fall from their native Constitution? Nothing permanent, which is not Divine; nothing everlasting, which lies not immedi∣ately without the Mixture of Creature-imperfections; The nearer thee, the safer; the further off thee, the more dangerous; to be quite cut off from thee, is perfect and only Misery. Cursed Men and Angels have no other In∣fluence from the Fountain, but that which conserves their natural Beings, in their natural Operations. O Welbelo∣ved, not only in thee do <HI>I live, move and have my Being,</HI> but thou art my <HI>All in all</HI>! I am filled with all thy <HI>Ful∣ness.</HI> O my Life, my Life! Do I not live for ever∣more?</P>
<P N="52">52. <HI>No Necessity of Creatures in Heaven: Jehovah is eminently all Things.</HI></P>
<P>All Things are swallowed up in thine infinite Excellen∣cy! Created Enjoyments are cried down, Times and Days are for ever fled away: All Things are immediate∣ly subjected to JEHOVAH, even the SON himself. All Rule, all Authority is put down; no Subordinations a∣mong Creatures; one Thing stands not in Need of ano∣ther; every Thing would be, as it is, tho' all other Creatures were done away: All flourish by the immedi∣ate Rays of the <HI>Sun of Righteousness</HI>; GOD doth main∣tain all Creatures without the Concurrence of Creatures: No Connections of second Causes, no Dependencies of one Creature upon another: Nature's World is quite a∣bolished; the Conditions of Beings are altogether chan∣ged: Yet, in how sweet an Order do all Things agree? All are independent; yet, all conspire in one; the Bond of Love betwixt all, is strong and immortal; the mu∣tual Aspects of all are pleasant, and superabounding, in Beings accomplished, every one in their own Measure, immediately from the Original of all Perfections. You Creature beauties, the full Emanations of your Loveli∣ness and Sweetness are ever darted upon me with Delight;
<PB N="134" REF="005510_0068_10184964BAB47910"/>
yet, am I happy to the uttermost, whether I enjoy you, or not: Time was when I could not well have wanted you; But now, whether I enjoy you, or not, I am ever the same; being filled and satiate with his eternal Sweetness: You are the Adornments, Outfields and Pendicles to my great Inheritance, and no Addition thereunto. And art thou, O my GOD, become All unto me? The Want of all my temporal Enjoyments is a Gain, that cannot be told! How have I been vexed, and wearied, with being occupied about vain, empty, unsatisfying <HI>Nothings</HI>; So that I was glad of a borrowed Vision of thee, of a re∣flex Manifestation of thy Glory and Excellency; and was so covered over with <HI>Shadows,</HI> that I could neither order right Expressions, nor Conceptions, because of Darkness. How oft have I bemoaned, <Q>When shall the Day dawn, and the Shadows fly away that I may be filled im∣mediately with his Glory? This Sight of his Beauty, this Taste of his Sweetness is tormenting, as well as de∣lightsom: I cannot rest, until I get full Enjoyment: Still I would have more and more of GOD, until I be filled with all his Fulness: But Oh! I cannot; Ten thousand Things stand in betwixt me and him, through this earthly and sinful Estate; so that I am oftimes so confused and disordered, that I can desire nothing at all: How doth this poor Life depend every Moment, on ten thousand Things? Here am I diverted, through Mortality, by every Thing that comes in my Way; in∣numerable Creatures having a commanding, diverting Influence over me: Must I be ever sleeping, eating, drinking, conversing in this and that Trifle? Must I draw Consolations from this, and the other, and the third Creature; and have a Fellowship with my GOD, by Benefit of Means and Ordinances, which ever have the Tincture and Savour of Imperfection? And are not the Conduits oftimes so corrupt, as that they imbitter my Enjoyments? And are they not so stopt, as that I am almost dead son Want? How am I drawn aside

hither and thither; this feeble Flesh being apt to receive new Impressions, every Moment, from every Thing that comes in the Way! And how vexing are all these Enjoyments, tho' most necessary? What a nauseating Round do I run, ever tossing the same Stone? That <HI>which hath been, is that which shall be, and there is no new Thing under the Sun. What Profit hath a Man of all his Labour?</HI> For tho' the Eye is not satisfied with Seeing, nor the Ear with Hearing, so that new Enjoy∣ments are ever required; yet, must the same Things be run over, and over again: And what might seem more excellent, than by the serious Search and Study of Things, to have the Heart filled with great Experience of Wisdom and Knowledge? Yet, I perceive, that <HI>this also is Vanity and Vexation of Spirit</HI>; for <HI>in much Wis∣dom, is much Grief</HI>; and <HI>he that increaseth Knowledge, increaseth Sorrow.</HI> Run fast, O Time, and Days, that this World may be cried down for ever, and God may become All in all. Silly Worldlings desire to have these Enjoyments eternally; because they know no bet∣ter: Something the Faculties must be exercised with, tho' with vexing Vanity. O but I have a Sight of the only satisfying Object! O to have all these out of the Way! Were it not thy good Pleasure I should conti∣nue thus for a Time, I could not but die through long∣ing for the immediate Vision of God. Scattered Streams, and Drops are become bitter; When shall I enter, Bo∣dy and Soul, into the Ocean, and be filled, and swal∣lowed up for ever and ever? When shall I receive the direct Rays of all Excellency from the Sun of Righte∣ousess; no Clouds intervening throughout Eternity?</Q> O Flower of all Blessedness! O golden Life of all my Desires! I am past from the Light of the Sun, and of the Moon; I am past from the necessary Help of Shadows, and Nothings. The LORD JEHOVA His my only Strength, and Light, and Life, and Joy, and Song, and all Things. Is it not sweet living thus, in the immediate Presence of

Jehovah and the Lamb? O <HI>Emmanuel's</HI> World, thou art an excellent Habitation! How sweetly and commodious∣ly art thou situate, directly against the SUN, and ORI∣GINAL of all Light, and Life, and Joy, and Sweetness? Who can but be lively and joyful here? Indeed, this is the smiling World, the rosy, and sunny Side of the Creation. What more can be said of my overflowing Happiness, than that I am here for evermore?</P>
<P N="53">53. <HI>Glory is an eternally blooming Thing.</HI></P>
<P>Is not the Fountain of Life deep? Men and Angels, is it possible you shall ever draw it dry? Nay, is it possible you can draw so much, that less remains behind? Yea, what could Millions of Millions of Angels multiplied do here? Not only drink, and for ever drink; but en∣ter in, and you shall be, as so many Nothings, swallow∣ed up, as it were, and lost forever. What infinite Springs of Sweetness, and Consolation ly hid? Dig further and deeper for ever, and still you shall find new Springs: Still there remains as many hid, as at the first Searching. What boundless Varieties of Joys and Sweetness? Every Draught, every Tasting may eternally ravish: yet, eve∣ry Moment, every Instant is filled with new Delights, new Ravishments: For what can exhaust infinite Delights and Sweetness? We may feel, and taste, and enjoy it, as it is; but can we comprehend it, and search it out unto Perfection? When we are all filled, the boundless Ocean is nothing diminished. And since we are ever drinking, ever drawing in Floods of increated Sweetness, are not our Delights infinitely various, and renewed every Mo∣ment? Which is an Enjoyment of the same, after diverse Manners, according to its infinite Varieties of Perfections, which eminently and virtually dwell therein. O then, the various and wonderful Conceptions of Men and An∣gels! O the ever green and flourishing Communications of ravishing Loves, and Joys! Shall there not be, every Moment, a new Love-song of Praises? Shall not infinite

Perfections, more and more seen, supply forever with new Expressions of the Excellency, Glory, Loveliness, Sweetness and Kindness of HIM, that sits upon the Throne, and the LAMB? We are past from augment∣ing of our Knowledge, by borrowed Visions; or per∣fecting it, by striving to know more, and more evident∣ly, and distinctly: All Confusion and Darkness is done away; Error, Ignorance, and false Uptakings, are no more: <HI>We know as we are known,</HI> even nakedly, imme∣diately, and <HI>Face to Face</HI>; without a prospective Repre∣sentation, or Clouds interveening: So that, as to Kind, Knowledge is perfect; yet, shall we not ever be search∣ing into the unsearchable Riches of this bottomless Mine, filled with all Varieties of Silver, Gold, Gems, Dia∣monds, Rubies and Sapphires, of inconceivable Value and Excellency? Are we not as so many <HI>Divines,</HI> search∣ing, preaching, discoursing more and more of the tran∣scendent Excellency of that Fountain of all Fulness! Do we not, in this ravishing Exercise, run over again, in the same Round? O then, throughout all Eternity our Happiness shall ever be increasing. In the very first Entry, all superabounds and overflows its Banks; so that nothing is wanting, in the least, to perfect Happi∣ness, Satisfaction and Fulness: Yet shall these over∣flowing Tides of Loves, and Joys, and Ravishments for ever swell higher and higher; so that the succeeding Moment shall be more superabounding than the immedi∣ately preceeding. O then, the Growth and Flourishing of ten thousand Myriads of Ages! And doth not this River increase proportionable to its Greatness? O then! after Myriads of Ages, according to the Number of the Atoms of the Creation; how shall it be augmented above the Number of all these Atoms, thousands of Times multipli∣ed by themselves? So that, to all Eternity, we are ever <HI>changed from Glory to Glory,</HI> and ever ascend higher and higher, and still the Steps become wider and wider; the Faculties ever are more and more clear and extended;
<PB N="138" REF="005510_0070_101849692244D7A8"/>
and the Discoveries more and more wonderfully ravish∣ing. This infinite World of all Perfections is beheld clear∣ly and immediately as it is; yet, who can comprehend all the Beauties, Delights, Excellencies and infinite Per∣fections, wherewith it is stored? Or, who can reach the infinite Number of <HI>Paradises, Mountains, Vallies, Ri∣vers?</HI> Yea, who can reach the ten thousand thousandth Part of its Immensity? So that eternally we shall follow the LAMB, through new Gardens, Orchards, Paradises, Mountains, and ever be going directly forward, making greater and greater, and more wonderful Discoveries. All the Powers and Faculties become more and more powerful and vigorous; so that Joy, and Delight, and Love, and Ravishment, shall swell more and more in Height, and Breath, and Length, and Depth through∣out Eternity. Men and Angels, is not our Inheritance inconceiveably large and fertile, rich and beautiful, and delightsom? Can we among us all but reckon over our <HI>Palaces, Cities, Paradises, Countries, Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Worlds?</HI> O what high Stretchings of Mind! and what further and further Stretchings, to let in these boundless Inundations of increated Sweetness, that over∣flow incessantly, rapidly, and eternally? O my God, this Happiness is more than superabounding! Who can express? who can conceive, what a Life it is, to be received into the Bosom of thy infinite Excellencies? to be admitted into the eternal Enjoyment of thy in∣comprehensible SELF! O what eternal Manifestati∣ons of the GODHEAD, to Men and Angels, in the Face of CHRIST! What Outlettings of new and va∣rious Influences from the <HI>Sun of Righteousness!</HI> What incessant Showers of the Dew of our WELBELOVED's Youth! What high, full, constant, lively and cherish∣ing Gales of the sweet ravishing Breath of JEHOVAH!

Strength, Verdure and Blooming and Fruitfulness? Poor Life, that depends on Creature-influences and Creature-enjoyments! Neither are they satisfying in themselves; nor can they yield new Sweetness eternally. Was it not the highest of all Madness and Folly, to forsake the eternal Fountain of living Waters, and rest an broken Cisterns, that can hold no Water? O Joy of all Joys, that ever I rested upon Thee, as my only Portion! O my Happiness! my Happiness surpasseth all Expression!</P>
<P N="54">54. <HI>Emmanuel's Land is altogether of free redeeming Grace, yet is it given by way of Reward.</HI></P>
<P>And what is this great Assembly of such glorious and majestick Creatures, but a Number of bound Debt∣ors to the free Grace, altogether free redeeming Grace of JEHOVAH and the LAMB? Are ye not, O blessed Creatures, so many Monuments of the free and undeserved Bounty and Love of Him, whose Love passeth all Understanding? Away with Deserving and Merit! what can Creatures do to Thee? what can their Acting, or Suffering for Thee, merit at thy Hand? If any have any Thing of its own, or can do any Thing of it self, then may it glory in what is its own. If all Creatures are not eternally obliged to love, and obey, and serve Thee, with all their Might and Vi∣gour; then let them ask Wages for obeying. Yea, is it not an eternal Wonder, Thou shouldst make Men, or Angels Actors, or Witnesses of thy infinite Glory and Excellency? What are all Creatures to thee, that thou should open thine Eyes upon them? what unspeakable Dig∣nity, to be allotted to the lowest Piece of Service for Thee? The more Creatures adore, and love and obey Thee, the more they are run into the Debt of thy free Grace: Yea, tho' Creatures could deserve, the very active Glorifying of thee carries in its Bosom full and overruning Recompense. And what Proportion imaginable is there betwixt the
<PB N="140" REF="005510_0071_1018496C2E106B60"/>
Acting or Suffering of a finite Creature, and one Mo∣ment of these boundless Joys? The Service is finite, but the Reward is invaluable. Tho' it had been possible for Creatures to persevere under a <HI>Covenant of Works</HI>; yet could they not have deserved, nor earned <HI>Wages,</HI> except by Virtue of <HI>Paction,</HI> a Product of wonderfully free, and condescending Grace: Which Way of Earning is under this <HI>second Covenant,</HI> and that in a more sublime and glorious Manner. Perfect Obedience was the Con∣dition of the <HI>First</HI>; Sincerity of the <HI>Second.</HI> Continuati∣on of a national Life, in an earthly Paradise, so long as the Creature persevered, was the Reward of the <HI>First</HI>; Eternal Duration of a divine Life, in this celestial Para∣dise, the Reward of the <HI>Second.</HI> The <HI>First</HI> was made with the earthly <HI>Adam,</HI> as the Head, and principal Person of the earthly Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se; the <HI>Second,</HI> with the heavenly <HI>A∣dam,</HI> as Head &amp; principal Person of the heavenly: But the <HI>First</HI> ruined both himself and his; not being able to fulfil the Bargain: The <HI>Second</HI> hath made up both him∣self, and his, for evermore, by perfect Obedience, and full Satisfaction, and Excellency of Power, in transfor∣ming his Children into his heavenly Image, and bring∣ing them all infallibly to Glory. The Covenant was principally made with our WELBELOVED; all the Pro∣mises of the new Covenant were made to him, as the Chief and <HI>First-born of many Brethren</HI>; So that it was impossible, that any of his Chosen from Eternity could be lost; being put into so sure an Hand, who was counta∣ble to the Father for every one of them; having from Eternity received them from Him, as his Spouse, his Chil∣dren, his Brethren, his Co-heirs, his Pupils, to be guided and tutored by Him, in Time and Eternity: So that all the Stress and Care of our Salvation was laid upon our great Lord Redeemer's Shoulders; according to which Trust, He hath Called, Justified, Sanctified us, Inabled us, kept us from falling away, in the midst of Infirmi∣ties, Difficulties, Temptations; and presented us <HI>without

Spot, or Blemish, before his Father.</HI> Our first earthly Fa∣ther played the Bankrupt with all, and left us poor, vile, miserable Wretches, lying in our <HI>Blood, and no Eye pitying us</HI>; our Nature being in his Loins, as the <HI>Root</HI> and <HI>Original</HI> of us all. Did he not degrade and debase; So that from excellent rational Creatures, created after the ravishing Image of our Maker, we became Brutish, Vain, Foolish and Vile? But in came our Welbeloved, and assumed our Nature, in its low and base Condition, with all its Infirmities and Passions, <HI>yet without Sin,</HI> and raised it up to a far, far higher Pinnacle of Excellen∣cy, than ever it fell from. Before, its Excellency was natural, but now it is supernatural; before earthly, now heavenly and divine. What are our Thoughts of the in∣conceivable Rays, and ravishing Resplendencies of free, free, free Grace, shining from the Godhead, in the Face of Christ, to undone Creatures? What could we do for our selves, when broken and lost? was not our Conditi∣on on most desperate-like? We could not keep our selves in our first Condition, when intire and in our full Vigour; What then could we do, when broken in Pieces and de∣stroyed? Had we not been obliged to Him, who had restored us to our former Estate, or meerly saved us from eternal Wrath, tho' no more? But O! what astonish∣ing Bounty, Love, Mercy, Condescension, Compassion, Kindness, Patience, and infinite Wonders shine here! Sirs, what have we lost, by our great and unspeakable Loss? Our Fall was abominable, dreadful, monstrous, ungrate and astonishing; yet what have we lost? Ah! no Thanks to us, that we are not eternally undone: Utter Destruction may be ascribed for ever to us, tho' the Guilt thereof is eternally cancelled; let all the Glory and Praise rest upon his Head, unto whom it doth alone appertain; even on his glorious and majestick Head, who is the <HI>Author and Finisher</HI> of this great Salvation. We are thine! we are thine, O excellent WELBELOVED; even

thine upon all possible Accounts! In our first Condition we were thine by Creation, thine by Covenant, &amp; these were sweet! But O now! Now we are also thine by Re∣demption, thine by Purchase, thine by a better Covenant-Foundation, a better Foundation than by Conquest; thine by a new Creation, thine by Exaltation to this glo∣rious &amp; divine Estate. O sweet, sweet! we are altoge∣ther thine, and nothing our own! O boundless Joys! I am eternally tied to thee, by all Obligations! O my inconceivable Happiness! Self hath not the least Occasion to boast of itself: No Creature, Man or Angel, hath a∣ny Thing to glory in, before thy Presence. O thou Hea∣ven of Heavens, shalt thou not be filled with Songs of free redeeming Grace? What should we do with our Diadems, our Sceptres, our Palms, our Robes, our glo∣rious Adornments? What should we do with all that we are and have, but cast them down at the Feet of him, who hath created, redeemed, and sanctified us? e∣ven at the Feet of him, who <HI>hath redeemed us to God, by his own Blood, and made us to our God, Kings and Priests? and we shall reign for ever and ever.</HI> O excel∣lent! The less our own, the better; the more thine, the more blessed Condition! We are altogether thine; all our Excellency, all our Actings, all our Sufferings, all our Glory, is only thine. This Kingdom thou alone didst purchase, without the Help of any: All, all are the Product of free, eternally free Love; all is given to us most freely! From Eternity were we chosen to all this Blessedness, most absolutely, without Respect of fore∣seen Excellency, or Deserving. All is most free to us; but dear to our WELBELOVED! What couldst thou give more, my dearest Lord, than thy Life, thy Blood, thy very Self? Couldst thou lay down a greater Pawn for our Salvation, than thy noble, su∣per-excellent, and glorious Self? Could Love have been manifested in a more transcendent, glorious and excellent Way? What couldst thou have done more

than thou hast done? Is not this in excellent Inhe∣ritance, Men and Angels? Is not this Land a beautiful, rich and pleasant Land indeed? Doth this look like the <HI>Field of Blood?</HI> Our <HI>Emmanuel</HI> conquered all this by his Blood and Death: He rode over Hell and Devils, and vanquished all the Opposers of this boundless Bles∣sedness. Thousands and ten Thousands were nothing in his Way. He made Nations and Languages Sacri∣fices to divine Justice. <HI>He rent the Heavens, and came down; the Mountains flowed down at his Presence: He trod down the People in his Anger, and made them drunk in his Fury; and did bring down their Strength to the Earth. He gave Egypt for our Ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> Were not these great Things: Hath he not re∣deemed <HI>Zion</HI> by Blood? Hath he not made a noble Conquest? Yea, He slew Death it self; He went to the Land of Death and Destruction, and vanquished his strongest and most cruel Enemies, in their own native Soil. O wonderful! <HI>He led Captivity captive,</HI> by being led Captive! By undergoing Shame, and Pain, and Grief, and Ignominy, He conquished boundless Joys and Delights, and Glory, and Renown: By dy∣ing, he vanquished Death, and him that had the Pow∣er thereof. Here, O here is the invaluable Price! The Life, the Life, <HI>the Blood of God!</HI> Wonder, and stand in an eternal Amazement, all Creatures! The Life of the Lord of Life, was laid down a Ransom for us! as the Price of our eternal Blessedness. Who can value the Life and Blood of the Man, who is GOD, blessed for evermore? Shell we speak of Ten thousand Millions of Millions of Excellent Men, of glorious Angels? That is just nothing. Shall we speak of Myriads of Myriads of Worlds, more excellent every one than another? That is just nothing also: So many Creatures, so many Nothings. Never so many Worlds are so many Shadows, in Comparison of the enduring Substance. O the Price, the Price! Do not the Thot's

thereof heighten the Conceptions of Men and Angels beyond all Conception? What strange Flamings of Love! What high Motions of Joy! What overflowing Tides of Admiration, at every Thought of the wonderful Way, wherein God hath done all this to us! All this Honour saith, Behold the Son of God shamed! All this Glory saith, Behold eternal, essential Glory obscured! And this joyful and flourishing Life saith, Behold the Prince of Life in a great Agony, bleeding to Death, even the shameful and painful Death of the Cross? O highest Manifestation of infinite Love! All is come thro' the Bowels of our dearest Lord Jesus, whose Love to us was so strong, that nothing could in the least quench it: He laboured thro' Love, sorrowed thro' Love, wept thro' Love, He died of Love. When cold Death be∣gan to seize on his Heart, he found it all flaming with the Love of his dearest Spouse; neither could he destroy these immortal Flames, which flash and dart forth their overcoming Rays, throughout Eternity. O thy incom∣prehensible Love! Bend hither all your Faculties, Men and Angels, and be amazed for evermore! O my hea∣venly Father, by thy infinite Gift, thou hast lost no∣thing; the Son of thy everlasting Love and Delights is ever in thy Presence. O my Redeemer, thou hast lost thy Life, yet thou hast not lost it; behold, <HI>Thou art alive for evermore.</HI> The Price of all doth eternally re∣main, else should the Things bought be nothing. Let no Creature speak of its Excellency, or Acts; what can they conquest? What can they purchase? Our <HI>Emmanuel</HI> hath purchased all Things: Indeed by <HI>Birth-right</HI> he is the eternal and essential Heir of all; yet hath he added a new Right, and made all his over again by <HI>Conquest. Not unto us, not unto us; but unto Thee be all the Glory, Do∣minion, and Praise,</HI> for ever and ever: Yet, O wonder∣ful Bounty, Condescendency and Love! Thou hast put on our Heads the Crowns of Conquerors, the Laurels of Triumph: Thou hast put in our Hands the never-fading
<PB N="145" REF="005510_0073_101849732B608DA0"/>
Palms of Victory: Hast thou done all? And shall we bear the Honour of, <HI>Well, and Heroically done,</HI> for the great and massie Diadem of Glory? Hast thou conque∣red? And shall we triumph, as Purchasers of Heaven and All? Hast thou suffered? And shall we enter into this Glory, as having undergone all the Assaults of Hell and Death, in our own proper Strength? This is a sweeter, more condescending and wonderful Dispensation, than it thou hadst brought us immediately out of the State of Nature into this State of Glory; or created us in the Midst of this incomparable Happiness. O sweet, sweet! to think, That Grace hath ushered in Glory; a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe of Believing, a Life of immediate Vision; a Life of Labour and Difficulty, this Life of eternal Repose; a Life of Shame and Reproach, this Life of immortal Glory and Renown; a Life of Fighting, this Life of everlasting Triumphing; a Life of Tears, Pain and Sad∣ness, this Life of boundless Joys and Delights; a Life of Fears and Weakness, this Life of perfect Security and Might! How wisely hath my Lord connected all Things together? that our Glory might be more than Glory; our Happiness more superabounding Happiness. This Glory, this incomprehensible Glory, and Renown will he have to rest for ever upon our Heads. Words of Amazement! to hear my LORD say, in the Presence of all, to e∣very one, <HI>Well done, good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful over a few Things, I will make thee Ruler our many Things; enter thou into the Joy of thy LORD: Heroically done, for this massia Diadem of Glory: Wor∣thy art thou to walk with me in White; for thou hast kept clean Garments, in the Midst of a polluted World: Thou hast valiantly fought and overcome; and art thou not worthy to triumph with me, throughout the vast Ages of endless Eternity? As I have done, so thou hast suffered patently, even unto the Death; and therefore, it well becomes thee to enter into this un∣speakable Glory.</HI> What, Lord! must I, poor silly I, once

base, sinful, wretched and undone I, must even I possess this undefiled, incorruptible, never-fading Inheritance? What have I done? Or, what have I suffered for thy ex∣cellent Name? Yea, what have I not done, endeavoured and desired against thy Holiness? Yet, even I must enter here, as worthy of all! I must wear the Conqueror's Crown! I must bear the Palms of Victory! Even thus it must be, thus it should be; since it is the good Pleasure of my LORD the King. When our Bridegroom hath made his Spouse the Perfection of Beauty; How is his mystical Body composed of various Members, every one endowed with its own proper Beauty? Every one is not graced with the same Measure of Excellency; since every Member conduceth to the beautifying of the whole: Va∣rieties of Glories in the same is wonderful, ravishing and pleasant. Even on Earth, the Spouse was adorned with va∣rious Excellencies, chiefly for Beauty, and not for Neces∣sity: Nay, the Heavens and the Earth are not defective herein: Were every Star like the Sun; or all the Stars of equal Glory; or, the whole Expansion adorned with e∣qual Glory; or were every Part of the Earth covered o∣ver with the same Beauties, so that nothing did excel a∣nother; Were all Heaven, or all Earth; or were Earth of equal Glory with Heaven; or were all a Sun; or were the higher and lower World nothing differing in Glory; all would be every Way the same; and so nothing so beautiful as it is. Indeed the Head is loving to all the Members, and is alike affected with them all; yet, every Member is in its own Order, <HI>According to his good Plea∣sure, which</HI> from Eternity <HI>he purposed in himself.</HI> As he distributed, after divers Degrees and Manners, his Gifts and Graces, to his Chosen in Time; so doth he make the Harvest correspondent to the Seed-time, the manly Con∣stitution to the Infancy, the Vigour and Blooming to the Budding and first Springing forth. According to the Grace given unto us in Time, and the Improvement

thereof, in acting, or suffering for his Glory; accor∣dingly is every one of us rewarded: As he did promise and testify, That as <HI>every Man should receive according to his Works</HI>; So <HI>they that are wise, shall shine as the Fir∣mament,</HI> and <HI>they that turn many to Righteousness, as the Stars forever and ever.</HI> The Connection betwixt Time and Eternity here, is not natural, from the Nature of Things, as if so much Grace deserved so much Glory; so much, or so long Acting or Suffering, such or such a Diadem of Honour: But meerly from his <HI>good Pleasure,</HI> who disposeth all Things most absolutely and freely: I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so it pleased him, he might have disposed otherwise; but this is the most excellent, because he hath done it. All our Excellency, and all our Acting, or Suffering, was only of him, and not of our selves: He alone did <HI>work in us both to will, and to do, of his good Pleasure.</HI> The more we were graced, the more we were enabled, the more we were obliged: Only it hath pleased his infinite Bounty to perfect in Eternity, according as he did begin in Time; and to give us the purchased Possession, by Way of Reward. In our LORD's Distribution of his Rewards, he considers the Multitudes of Talents, and the Improvement of them, and Way of Improvement; as, if with Vigour and great Sincerity; also Perseverance there∣in, and Duration, with more and more Magnanimity unto the Death; also the Greatness of the Opposers is conside∣red: Also the Effects, and extending of Talents, for the Good of others; as when the Man acts bravely, be∣fore Sun and Moon, whereby great Glory doth redound to him, for whom are all Things; and <HI>many are strength∣ned, and converted unto Righteousness</HI>: Suffering is con∣sidered in itself, as such, excelling Acting; which is more or less excellent, even as acting according to other va∣rious Circumstances. O the wonderful Way thou hast taken to beautify thy Spouse! How doth the Head shine most eminently above all the Members; and every Mem∣ber, according to its Measure, aloted from Eternity? E∣very

one of us was appointed, before the Foundation of the World, to this Measure of Glory, most absolutely and freely, without any Respect to Excellency, or good Works in Time: And yet, O eternal Admiration! <HI>He hath rewarded</HI> every one of us, <HI>according to our Righte∣ousness; according to the Cleanness of our Hands he re∣compensed us:</HI> For <HI>we kept the Ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from our GOD</HI>: For <HI>all his Judgments were before us</HI>; and we did not put away his Statutes from us; we were also <HI>upright before him,</HI> and we <HI>kept our selves from our Iniquity</HI>: Therefore hath <HI>the LORD recompensed us, according to our Righteousness, according the Cleanness of our Hands in his Eye-Sight</HI>: For <HI>with the Merciful thou hast shewed thyself merciful; with the upright Man, thou hast shewed thyself upright; with the Pure, thou hast shewed thyself pure; and with the Froward, thou hast shewed thyself froward: For thou hast loved the afflicted People, and hast brought down the high Looks.</HI> All thy Promises to the Overcomers hast thou perfectly accomplished.

And how many were accounted, by the Ge∣nerality, true and sincere Saints, because of their selfish prudential Way of Carriage, in all Exigencies, and among all Sorts of Persons; because of their larger Recommen∣dation of all, and Baseness of Spirit, in the publick In∣terests of God; tho' rejected, deserted, blasphemed, and troden upon by almost all; because of their Compli∣ance with the Humors of most, and insinuating of them∣selves upon both by Good &amp; Bad, in an humble and loving Manner; because of their sinful Reservedness, in the Mat∣ters of God, in a declining Time; because of their keep∣ing themselves free from gross Outbreakings; because of their Counterfeiting of real Saints, by acquiring a fine out∣ward Carriage, and a huge literal, notional Knowledge of divine Things; that they might pray, write and dis∣course like Men, much in the intimate Fellowship of Je∣sus: As also, because of their outward Prosperity, which gave Men a brave Lustre in the Eyes of dull Mortals.

This is the Kingdom, these are the glorious Mansions, I have set them down into. <Q>I spake not to you, my fair Ones, of earthly Kingdoms, and Possessions: These celestial Habitations were you ordained unto, as your ever∣lasting Country.

Did you ever want Journey-bread, as long as on the Way to this Country? Tho', for your Good, I did not laden you with the thick Clay of the Earth, I ever cut out that Lot, which was best for you; which was not a Life of earthly Abundance: If it had been otherwise, I should have made you the only Sharers of Earth, the only Potentates of Time; But Dunghil Earth, was far below your Divine Minds. How degra∣ding had it been, to see my Fellow-heirs vexed, tor∣moiled, and distracted with Dunghil-Concernments?

Wo unto you, that shut Heaven both upon your selves and others: Wo unto you, who <HI>devoured the Needy, and for a Pretence made long Prayers</HI>: Wo unto you, who compassed Sea and Land, to draw others unto your Faction, under the Pretence of the Salvation of Souls: Wo unto you, who, by your foolish Subtil∣ties, did cast a Mist upon all the Duties of Religion: Wo unto you, who were strict in the Circumstantials and Externals of Religion, and careless of the Power and Life thereof: Wo unto you, who pretended Love and Reverence to the dead Saints, because they could not testify against you; But maligned, persecuted and con∣temned the living Ones, because of their standing out against the Sins of the Generation wherein they lived. O cursed Wretches, the Flames of my Rage shall feed themselves upon you: Try your Stoutness and Mag∣nanimity now; the Threatning of my Fury and In∣dignation did little affect you: You gave me the Lie, and said, <HI>It is not the Lord, neither shall Evil befal us.</HI> When my Hand was stretched out, you would not see; but now you see, and feel, and are everlastingly asha∣med: Your Atheism is quite done away; know ye not now, that I am a God of Truth and Equity? Have I not performed all upon you, that ever I spoke? Are you not filled with Wrath? Is not Soul and Body tor∣mented with the dreadful Flames of my Fury? Shower I not down upon you incessantly Fire and Brimstone, and an horrible Tempest of all Manner of Pains, Griefs, and Torments? Devils and wicked Men, tear &amp; tor∣ment, and curse one another; you concurred bravely in sinning, concur in your punishing; you loved the Fel∣lowship of one another, be eternally together: Com∣panions in Time, and Companions in Eternity. The Fellowship of any holy Ones you little esteemed; I

have made betwixt them &amp; you a vast Gulf of eternal Separation: Had you known their Dignity, you should have wondered, that I suffered you to abide in the same World with them. What think you now of provoking me, vile Wretches? Are you the Creatures, that tho't highly of sinning? Are you able to despise and mock at the just Punishment thereof? No more vain Laugh∣ing and Jollity; the Fewel of your base sinful Delights have I taken for ever from you: Not one Smile of Joy from henceforth. All the Mercies I vouchased upon you, did ye use against me; the more I continued my Bounty, the more you rebelled and vexed my holy Spirit; tho' <HI>in me you lived, moved and had your Being,</HI> yet you forgat me, and minded your own worldly Things, more than my Glory and Interests through the World. All your Actions were subordinate to base Self; even your most excellent-like Actings and Suffe∣rings for my Cause, were ever out of one selfish Design or other: I will fill you with your own Ways. You shall not be troubled with Offers of Mercy any more, or with the Exercises of Godliness any more: Nothing but Blasphemy fills your hellish Mouths. You shall not be vexed with the Company of my Saints any more: You shall have your Fill of one anothers hellish Fellow∣ship throughout Eternity: Your Choice and Delight shall not be taken from you. Know you not who I am? Am I not he, whom you despised and forgot? Am I not he, whose Yoke ye brake asunder from your Necks? Am I not he, whom you defied, and proclaimed War against? Gird up now your Loins, like Men, and main∣tain your Quarrel valiantly; shew, by your magnani∣mous Deportment, the Justness of your Enmity against Me. Desperate Wretches, you have not the Heart to submit; neither are you able to stand against one Bil∣low of my Indignation.

Misery of you all; only your selves have destroyed your selves: Madly and desperately have you run to your own Destruction; and who was obli∣ged to stand in your Way? Who hath struck you with such a monstruous Hatred to all Good, and Inclination to all Evil? Are ye not naturally wicked, and abo∣minable? Are you not Haters of my Holiness and Ex∣cellency? Had ye not from the Beginning a strange Averseness from my spotless Holiness? Blasphemous Wretches, you see <HI>my Ways are equal,</HI> to your eternal Torment and Confusion; your Mouths are for ever stopped, and you are found guilty: Nothing have you to say for your selves, your monstrous hellish Frame is as a thousand Witnesses against you. Should not I alone be exalted? Should I not crush to Pieces all the Despisers of my Glory? Shall I not for ever cause you to drink the pure and unmixed Wrath of the Almighty, that is poured forth without Mixture? That ye may be filled with my Fury and Indignation, and may be drunk, and made mad, and torment and tare, and devour and curse yourselves, and one ano∣ther; that every Thought may bring in a dreadful Horror, and hellish Pangs. O mine Enemies! mine Enemies, whom I made the Shields of the Earth, who became greater in Wickedness, than in your worldly Greatness: You Ringleaders of Iniquity, Betrayers of the great Trust I dignified you with; the Ruin of thousands shall fall on your Heads. Did you tyrannize, without Law, or Reason? Alledging, You were ac∣countable to none for Outrages, but unto me; that you might fulfil your wicked Desires without Countroul∣ment? O vilest of Wretches, whom I set over my Church, to defend Her from all external Damages, to hold her in all her glorious Privileges, that I left her, in my Legacy; and to hold the Crown, upon my Head, in Despite of the Opposers: Did you make Havock of her? Did you rob her of her Adornments? Did you pull

the Crown off my Head, and put it on your own? Did you neglect the Affairs of my Church, and subordinate them to your own temporal, vain, transient Affairs? Did you put the Sword in the Bowels of my Chosen, which I gave you to protect them with? O mine Enemies! I will neither fight with small or great, in Comparison of <HI>You</HI>; even <HI>you,</HI> I will ever be avenged upon; <HI>you,</HI> and all your Parasites, Executors, Applauders, Conni∣vers and Consulters to your horrid Rebellion.

I am He, whose Blood you esteemed as Water; my Brethren you hated, because they bare my Image; for my Sake, even for my Sake, you persecuted them; whatever was your Pretensions, the <HI>Power of Godliness</HI> was the Butt of your Malice: Durst you malign the Exercising of my Spirit of Grace, in its highest Actings, as a Spirit of Sedition, and rebellious Combinations?

Our Seeing of the <HI>first Temple</HI> will not cause us to weep, because of this <HI>Second:</HI> Here is a magnificent Royal Palace reared up, in the Place of a Dungeon; A stately Majestick City, in the Place of a few poor Cottages. Was the former Fabrick real? or was it not rather imaginary? Were they not Fools, who were only delighted with it? Were they not bewitched, and led away with Fancies, Night-Dreams and Vanities? I thought the former Earth, in the Days of my Mortality, full of the Glory, Bounty, Riches and Excellency of the great Former; and was it not? Yet, was it a dark Shadow, to what mine Eyes behold. This is a Change could never have entred within the Conceptions of the most excellent Creatures; This is materially the <HI>Former,</HI> and yet not the Former. It is manifest, my ALMIGHTY ONE, thou canst create never so many Worlds, differing altogether in Excellency from one another: But thou hast done it, because it so pleased Thee: Just, and holy, and wise, and true art thou, in all thy Ways. This is the Stage whereon thou actedst most wonderful Things, as a <HI>Prelude</HI> to this endless Day of Eternity: Whereon thou ran an inconceivable Mass of various Dispensations, which will fill Eternity with Admiration: Here didst thou display the Banner of thy Mercy, and Justice, in the very same Traces of Providence, as the wisest of Mor∣tals could not trace thy Footsteps; Here thou wroughtst the never-enough admired Work of our Redemption; here thou wooed thy Bride; here thou prepared thine Enemies for the Time of Vengeance; here thou madest all Things ready for this everlasting Day; and therefore in thy Wisdom hast thou continued it, an eternal Monu∣ment.

Might it not render a Creature eternally blessed, to consider thy infinite Glory, and Perfections, written on thy Handy-work? Even in the Days of my Childhood, I could not open mine Eyes, on the most ordinary Productions of thine Excel∣lency, without strange Stirrings, Love, Joy and Admi∣ration. O the ravishing sweet Sights, that even then I have seen of Thee, through the Glass of the Creature! How have my Thoughts run a Maze of ravishing De∣lights and Sweetness, in considering the Vastness and Expansion of the Canopy of the lower World! the Beams of thy Chambers, laid in the Waters; the Clouds, thy Chariots, whereon thou didst gloriously ride; the Winds the Pavement whereon Thou walkest; Thy Omnipotent Power, in laying so firmly the Foundations of the Earth, that it cannot be moved; The prodigious Overflowing of the Waters, when they overwhelmed the Earth; The un∣searchable Manner of bounding the boistrous Waves of the raging Sea, by sandy Bulwarks; Thy Wisdom, in watering the Vallies from the Mountains, and the Mountains from the Sea and Heavens; that the Fowls of the Air, and the Beasts of the Field might drink abundantly: The Excel∣lent Vertues of base Dunghil-Earth, manifested in its rich, pleasant, sweet, various and lively Off-spring; as, Grass, Herbs, Flowers, Shrubs, Trees, and innumerable Mul∣titude of Beauties, filling all the Senses with passing Delectation, and subservient to all the Defects of indigent Mortals; as Nutriment, Medicine, Clothing, and Habi∣tation: The wonderful Eye of thine omniscient Provi∣dence over the most inconsiderable Creatures; as, the Conies, and Goats, who were provided of fit Refuges from all Danger: The exact Ordina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of Sun, Moon and Stars; The Vicissitudes of Light and Darkness, for the several Exigencies of Men and Beasts.

such ravishing Thoughts of thy Power, Wisdom and Goodness, how have I been filled, according to the Mea∣sure of Mortality, with inexpressible Joy and Sweetness? So that I could not but cry out, with ravishing Astonish∣ment, O LORD, <HI>how manifold are thy Works? In Wis∣dom hast thou made them all! The Earth is full of thy Riches!</HI> And again fell into the deep Contemplation of the Greatness of the Sea, its innumerable Progeny of small and great Animals; Thy Wisdom, in Appointment of Navigation; and Power, in the Leviathan's playing there; thy rich Bounty, in holding a well-furnisht Table, to so numerous a Family, as the People of Heaven, Earth, and Sea; Their necessary Dependence on thee, every Instant, in their Living, Moving, Being; so that they are not, if Thou draw in thy Self and the Vivify∣ing Spirit thou communicates unto them. Have I not, O my GOD, been in many such sweet Meditations, until I have been wrapt up in a Frame of Spirit inutterable, inexpressible? and sung forth in the midst of such Sweet∣ness, <HI>The Glory of the LORD shall endure for ever; The LORD shall rejoice in all his Works: I will sing un∣to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing Praises unto my God, while I have my Being; my Meditation of him shall be sweet; I will rejoice in the Lord.</HI> How oft have I thought, Is the Wilderness so sweet and pleasant? What must the In-land be? Is there such ravishing Variety of Beauty, Glory, and Sweetness, all along in my Pilgrimage? What can I imagine to behold in my Na∣tive Country?

And is this Earth so sweet, when cursed, and defiled, because of its abominable Inhabitants? what shall it be, when renewed, and made only an Ha∣bitation of Righteousness? Shall not every Place excell <HI>Eden?</HI> and <HI>Eden</HI> the Celestial Camps? Indeed, O lower World, we might, in our Mortality, conceive something confusedly of thy Renovation; but could never have imagined, thou shouldst have been thus: O Earth, thou appearest to be placed after the former Manner, to be of the former Magnitude, and Figure, as to every Point corresponding to the same Points of the Heaven of Hea∣vens; also the lower Heaven differs not in Magnitude, Situation, and Number of Tapers, from the former; and only herein do the old and new World agree: Now, the smallest Star would have confounded the In∣habitants of the old, and made the very Sun to evanish in its Light: The Beams of Light darting every where are substantial; filling not only the Eyes, but all the Sen∣ses with passing Delight; it containing innumerable Per∣fections and Vertues, not to be perceived by Mortals; their Senses being few, and capable of little: But now, every Sense is equivalent to Ten thousand thousand dif∣fering in Kind from one another: The Light of one Lu∣minary confounds not the Rays of another, tho' all are united and made one: The Moon appears to change Faces, by the nearer, or further, Approach of, or Distance from her King; yet she is ever more glorious than the Sun in his former Condition: Every Star showers down Millions of Millions of various Influences, which in a Moment would convert the former Earth to a Lump of Gold and Gems: All are transparent, even the Sun, Moon and Stars, though compact solid Globes of Light: No Vail drawn betwixt the higher and lower Habitation: No smoky Fumes betwixt Heaven and Earth: No Winds, nor Storms, Tempest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, pinching Cold, nor pierceing Heat: No Vicissitudes of Summer and Winter: Nothing but

an eternal Spring-tide, and endless Summer, a constant Harvest: All are in their blooming Estate, and fullest Perfection. What Wonder! Is it not the Centre of infi∣nite Influences? the sweet Influences of <HI>Pleiades</HI> are ne∣ver bound up, but are every Minute showered down; the Bands of <HI>Orion</HI> are ever loosed: And is not the heavenly Earth so impregnate, with such infinite Vertues? Is it not so lively and vigorous; so full of the Seeds of innumerable Excellencies, as that, in it self, it is beau∣tiful, fruitful and excellent, without Influences from Creatures of an higher Nature? In its own Nature doth it contain the Vertue and Operations of Sun, Moon and Stars. How infinitely various are the Sensitive Vegetables? What Beauty, and Glory, and Vertue is to be found in every One? The smallest Pile of Grass might alone banish Darkness from the whole Universe. O the Roses and Lilies! every one like a Star in its proper Orb: All Things are like Lamps of Light; yet, nothing hindering the Varieties of Colours, which are infinitely various, and wonderfully lively: All the Rays of such innume∣rable Beauties and Excellencies, tho' united in one, are nothing troublesom, through their Intensity, but the more delightsom: And all Lights, all Colours, all Ex∣cellencies as infinitely intended.

One Gale would cause Death it self to be lively; being a thousand Times more excellent, than the most pure and refined Animal Spirits of Mortals: One Gale of this, would have rendered the former Earth a fertile <HI>Eden</HI> for many Ages: Eyes and Ears, and all the Faculties, are lost in an endless Maze; To find a Beginning, Middle and Ending, is a Task for Eternity. All is one Orchard, one Paradise, one Field, one Garden of Delight! The most curious Artifice of Cities, Palaces, or what else, would be De∣formity. Nature now cannot be bettered by Helps: JEHOVAH hath ordered all, in an Order above the In∣vention of all Creatures: <HI>Eden</HI> here would be like a black Spot on a fair and beautiful Face.

When it is augmented with never so many Ages, and your Strength augmented to bear it; ne∣ver can it be said, He inflicts more than is meet; since Your Rebellion is against an infinite Majesty, and is of an endless Nature: Since You are ever sin∣ning more and more; therefore are You obliged to his everlasting Mercy and Bounty.

Did you imagine, That the vilest of Men should domineer over the most Excellent, and no more of it? That <HI>the Wicked might oppress the Man more righteous than himself,</HI> and yet no more of it to all Eter∣nity? Did the Almighty create Man after his Image, to eat and drink, and pass away an Inch of Time, and no more? Was it the Purpose of the wise Disposer of all Things, that Men should be ranked according to the Fan∣cies of Riches and titular Honour acquired by Vanity, and maintained by Folly? What think you now of those You contemned not long ago, whom You esteemed as the <HI>Filth and Off-scourings of all Things,</HI> whom You thought unworthy of Your excellent Presence, because they were not laded with the thick Clay of the Earth? What Distance &amp; Reverence looked You for from Fellow-Creatures, as if they had been made for so base an End, as to hold up Your Yeas and Nays? As if Caping and Cringing, &amp; such histrionick Vanities had been requisite for the Sons of Wisdom? O joyful Day of Eternity! wherein all Things are unmasked; all Odds are made Even. The Fore tho'ts of this held up my Heart, in my sad Pilgrimage.

They that practised best your foolish Modes and Inventions; that could comply best with your foolish Humours; that knew best, how to scrape together the Pelf of the Earth, were esteemed wise and accomplished by you: As for the truly Wise (who were ever very rare, and the Wonders of their Age) you contemned, and reproached them, as the Dregs of Man∣kind. How did you triumph over the Poor, and Meek of the Earth? while your World remained, which was but for a Moment. An everlasting World is now come; May we not triumph Time-about? Which of us have chosen the better Part? Judge ye: Present Things you esteemed only real; and wondered at our Folly, that lived upon the Hope of Things to come; yea, and to come after Death, and the Dissolution of all Things: And are you not Fools, who neglected Immortality and Glory, and Ho∣nour, tho' you had a miserable, pining Life on Earth, ear∣ning your daily Bread by sore Labour and Grief? Could not a frowning vexing World loose your base Minds from it? O vile Wretches, esteemed you Earth, in its Winter∣garb, before the eternal Enjoyment of the Fountain of all Blessedness? Verily your Mouth is eternally stopped. Wretches of Wretches, who were endowed with the Knowledge of the only excellent Things; who spake, and wrote to the Good and Admiration of others: Wonder∣ful! knew you so much of the Alsufficiency of JEHO∣VAH, the Emptiness of all Things below him; and yet did not put your Trust in him, did not care for a near Fellowship with him, but placed your Love and Delights on Vanities? You are to be doubly punished, who knew your Master's Will, and did it not: Good had it been for you, vilest Wretches, that you had been Idiots and Sots: How did you despise some of the <HI>Excellent Ones of the Earth</HI>; because of your more sagacious Nature, in up∣taking?

your Knowledge puffed you up; Charity hath been away; your Gifts and Abilities have you not used to his Glory <HI>for whom are all Things</HI>: But Self hath been the End of all your Endeavours. What a glorious Lustre had you then among weak Saints! The Rottenness of your Heart was overvailed with a Multitude of natural Gifts, and E∣ducation: But he, who knoweth all Things, hath found you out; he hath weighed you in an even Balance, and ye are found wanting. Now, it is manifest, who is the Searcher of the Hearts, and the Trier of the Reins: Were they not wise, who overlooked the Approbation of Men, and gave all Diligence to be approved to thee? What thy Tho'ts are concerning a Creature, that it is indeed. Ma∣ny Hypocrites have passed off the Stage of Time, with the Pasport of many of the Saints; but thy <HI>Well done</HI> hath only landed fair in thy blessed Kingdom. Indeed, LORD JESUS, in Time thou madest a brave Separation betwixt the Righteous and the Wicked; how oft hast thou sifted thy Church over, and over again, with smaller and smal∣ler Sieves? So that the Difference betwixt the Wheat and the Chaff was very discernable. How oft hast thou drawn the Controversy betwixt thy Friends, and thy Ene∣mies, to smaller and smaller Concernments? So that many, who, for Shame, could not, inpalpably gross Things, comply with the Devil and his Slaves; yet in Matters that seemed of less Consequence, did they side with them; whence their Hypocrisie and Luke warmness in the Matters of GOD did appear. O Apostates and Be∣trayers of the Interests of Jehovah and the Lamb, your Mouth is eternally stopped! Many fine Excuses did your hellish Minds invent,in the Midst of your Villany: Your fine Subtilties, drawn from Prudentials and Politicks, are now laid open before Sun and Moon.

You sta∣ted Enemies against JEHOVAH, and the LAMB, what think you of your desperate Madness? Thought you to conquer and destroy the Friends and Darlings of the high and mighty One?

We believed, that what he had promised, He would perform, tho' we saw them not, either intui∣tively, or rationally; tho' we had not received the Promi∣ses, but only had a View of them afar off, yet were we perswaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed our selves Strangers and Pilgrims on Earth; Declaring plainly to Worldlings, that we were seeking a Place of eternal Abode, overlooking the Wilderness, as a Way∣faring Place. O fairest WELBELOVED, how was I ena∣moured and ravished with thy very NAME, when I had not seen thee! How was I perswaded of the Truth of all thy Promises and Threatnings, as if I had beheld them fully accomplished? How gladly and cheerfully did I loose my Heart and Love from all temporal Concern∣ments, that they might be set wholly upon the great Things to be revealed?

What was a Man's Holiness to you, but some ima∣ginary Fancies &amp; Opinions, he had learned by Education and Teaching, and entertained through Conceitness and Fancy? Some precise Tenets, which were needless and superfluous: For Religion, in your Judgment, was an easy and trivial Matter; the Generality were Saints: A large and wide Charity had you for every one, not trans∣gressing the Limits of common Humanity; Civilians, Moralists, Formalists illuminated, were all, in your O∣pinion, fit for the glorious and majestick Kingdom; fit for entring this golden CITY, &amp; conversing familiarly with JEHOVAH and the LAMB, in this royal Hall of Glory: Us you reproached, as Censorious &amp; Unchari∣table; because we looked upon Holiness, as a difficult, rare, and excellent Thing: because we counted the Way to this unspeakable Glory strait, and travelled by few; because we looked upon the Saints, as so many miracu∣lous Signs and Wonders. Who have judged right, is now manifest to the whole Creation. <HI>We have sought, we have vanquished!</HI> Glory, Glory, immoral Glory to the CAP∣TAIN, <HI>the Author and Finisher,</HI> for evermore.</P>

<P>O pleasant and melodious World! The former was jarring, every Part in Opposition to another: All Things were full of Labour, Groaning and Travelling, until this glorious Birth was brought forth. It could not stand, being divided against it self, being full of intestine Wars, and Desolations; it could not but come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought, and this fair Fabrick arise in its Place. Behold, nothing now but Peace and eternal Friendship: No∣thing is out of Order; Every Part agrees with the whole, for sounding forth an eternal <HI>Hallelujah</HI> to the great Former. All Contention and Violence are banished out of this blessed World, into utter Darkness: Nothing but deep Peace and Security; all Things seem to kiss and embrace one another; these eternal Gales have no Flux or Change, tho' they are for ever blowing. Sirs, is not this gentle Breathing passing delightsom, af∣ter so sore and hot a Battle? All is perfumed with <HI>Myrrhe</HI> and <HI>Frankincense</HI>! One Blast might cause Ten thousand Worlds to live. What a Life hast thou, O blessed Self?

O these <HI>Wells of Salvation,</HI> infinitely trans∣cending the <HI>Pools of</HI> Baca'<HI>s Vail!</HI> One Drop is more delightsom and satisfying, than the Oceans of all earth∣ly Sweetness. What were the broken Cisterns, that Fools were drinking of? They were inflaming, not quench∣ing; more fantastical than real.

But you awaked and <HI>behold it was a Dream.</HI> Are you not confounded, when your Eyes are opened, to perceive so deep a Delusion? Were you not imagining your selves enjoying Riches, and Honours, and Pleasures? But now the glorious Day of Eternity is broken up, and where are they? Here are Realities: This Land is filled with eternal Springs of li∣ving
<PB N="192" REF="005510_0097_101849B49EACDC08"/>
Waters of all Sweetness and Satisfaction; Strange! ever drinking, and never cloyed and surcharged: the dee∣per, &amp; more Draughts, the greater Delectation! O my Conceptions on Earth! O my Enjoyments now! I did not in the least conceive them. O my eternally pre∣sent Enjoyments: And yet, I have all I could conceive. Whatever Pleasure, Satisfaction, and what can conduce to a Life filled with all Manner of Excellencies, Delights and Sweetness, is here in the Top and Flower of all Perfecti∣on. When I strained my Conceptions to the highest Pitch of Mortality, and imagined Glory, Excellency and Sweetness, augmented and perfected, by Myriads of My∣riads of Stages, above all the Glory I could perceive or imagine; still I have fallen wonderfully below this: And yet my Conceptions, in Part, represented this; for all Things are here: Here is an eternal Confluence of all Manner of good Things: Who can imagine any Thing, which might be here, and is not: What want we, O In∣habitants of this wealthy City? Is not this the Centre, whither all Glory and Sweetness run, like a flowing Stream? And what Wonder? This is the City-royal of the eternal KING Here, here He manifesteth, immedi∣ately, and in open View, his unsearchable Riches, tran∣scendent Glory, infinite Power, boundless Goodness, and the infinite Varieties of his unconceivable Excellencies. Were they Fools, who overlooked base Earth, and laid out their whole Strength, for acquiting a Right to the glo∣rious Possession, and the unsearchable Treasures of this Ten thousand Times blessed Land of <HI>EMMANUEL</HI>? Poor Earth, with thy glistering, nothing Enjoyments, whither art thou gone? O real, solid and substantial Enjoyments! all the Glorious, Beauties and Excellencies of Time were meer Shadows and Resemblances of what I behold. What, there, was in Appearance, is here indeed; the real Spring-tide is here: Here are the true Gardens and Or∣chards of Delights: Here are the substantial Roses, Lilies and Violets: Here are the true Pearls, Rubies and Dia∣monds;
<PB N="193" REF="005510_0097_101849B49EACDC08"/>
all the former were but Counterfeit, and in Ap∣pearance such. I see the Difference betwixt Things here, and what were in Time, is such, as is between the bare Shew, and the Substance. I thought, I saw Crowns and Sceptres, Honours and Renown; but they were Vapours, glistering after their Similitudes, which are now evanished eternally to nothing; and behold the real Diadems, Sceptres, and Honours; I thought, I found some Pleasure and Delight; I thought, I beheld great Varieties of all Kinds: But the Night is gone, and the Day is broken up, that dispelleth glistering Shews and Vapours, in discove∣ring the real and substantial Things: All Things are here in Substance, which in Time were in Appearance. Here are the real Dwellings, Cities, Orchards Hills of Frank∣incense, Mountains of Spices. We were far mistaken, O Inhabitants, to speak of any Thing, as existent any where else than here; else all our Speech and Conceptions, within Mortality's Region, were meerly figurative: For, to conceive of Things properly, as they were on Earth, there was neither Sun, Moon nor Stars; neither Lilies nor Roses, nor Beauties, nor Excellencies; they are here, and only here for evermore. Were they wise, who placed their Delights on Shadows, and evanishing Nothings? Were they Fools, who overlooked all the vain Fancies of Time, and fixed their Minds only on this <HI>enduring Sub∣stance?</HI> I have found the Substance, for the Shadow: I, even I am Possessor of the World of eternal Joy and Satisfaction.</P>

O ye Angels, could you have found out such a noble Draught! Could you have invented such an admirable Way, of bringing poor, feeble, sinful Mortals to Glory? O sweet, sweet Dispensation! Base Earth, that is now for ever eva∣nished, was not my Country, but the Place of my Exile; not my Abode, but my Pilgrimage; and therefore it was well it frowned upon me, and appeared like the Thing that indeed it was, a vain, empty, glistering Nothing. My Lord hath been tender of his Darlings, and could not suffer Night-Dreams and Fancies to beguile them; which they might, they being in their childish and mor∣tal Condition, if they had appeared with a smiling plea∣sant Countenance. O my God, the greatest Snares that ever thou rainedst upon thine Enemies, was when thou gave them <HI>the Desires of their Heart:</HI> Earth they desired, and Earth thou madest to look kindly upon them; and therefore they are ruined for evermore. I see the Dispen∣sation, that most crossed my own natural Disposition, hath contributed most for my Advantage: My Lord hath withheld no good Thing from me: It was best I should have had a Life of Sorrow, Torment and Vexation; it was well I was cut short of earthly Enjoyments.

When I imagined, I had got thee wrought up to a sublime heavenly Frame; how soon didst thou become carnal and earthly again! When thou seemed all in a Flame of Divine Love and Zeal, how didst thou become cold and indifferent, ere ever I was aware?

When I could not but cry out, <HI>O my Heart is fixed, my Heart is fixed; I will sing; yea, I will forever be altogether for Praises:</HI> How soon wast thou unsettled, and tossed up &amp; down with the Winds of Vanity!

<P>Whatever Sweetness and Delight I enjoyed in Time, is now augmented, Myriads of Myriads of Stages: By my leaving of Earth, I have lost no Enjoyment, not only because of Recompence, and Enjoyment of an higher Na∣ture; but also because all Kinds of Enjoyments are here in an eminent and divine Manner. Thy Land, O EM∣MANUEL, <HI>is stored with all Manner of precious Things,</HI> New and Old, <HI>which thou hadst prepared</HI> for thy Chosen, before all Ages. All the Joys and Delights that I met with in Time, were as so many light Essays and small Preludes of these substantial and enduring Pleasures; All have been slight Fore-tastes of this superabounding Harvest of Eternity: What was then in Drops, is now in Oceans; for I am entred for ever into the FOUN∣TAIN of all Fulness and Satisfaction: And what Sweet∣ness, before, I experienced blockishly and in Part, I find now in the most evident, sublime and vigorous Manner: Even my most refined Enjoyments of thy blessed Self, were but low, childish Motions, arising from shallow improper Apprehensions, raised by the Contraction of a Multitude of borrowed <HI>Ideas,</HI> extracted from lower Ob∣jects; which indeed were passing glorious and sweet for the Time, filling Mortality almost above its Measure, appearing <HI>Childhood-Glory</HI> fallen down on <HI>Grace's Coun∣try</HI>: But O the vast Difference betwixt Mortality and Immortality!

more by certain Report, than evident Experience; for what can the Mortal imagine higher, than by the sweet Outletting of the Glory and Desire of Men and Angels, to be filled and overfilled <HI>with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory?</HI> But a Drop that would overfill a Vessel of the narrowest Size, would be as just Nothing to one of the Capacity of many Worlds.

me, in my low and despicable Condition: I have most sensibly found thy strengthning, cheering Presence, in all Afflictions and Difficulties; I found thee another Manner of GOD, than the foolish World imagined thee to be, even a <HI>present Help in Times of Trouble,</HI> and that gave Ear to my Prayers, and answered them speedily; both by the Influences of thy Spirit on my Heart, and thy Dispensations. Tho' then I was a Child, yet didst thou teach me to discern betwixt thy Frownings, and thy Smiles; the Light of thy Countenance lifted up, and the turning away of thy Face: Thou madest thy self famili∣ar unto me; So that I approached unto thee, in all Exi∣gencies, as unto a near &amp; intimate Friend, of whose Kind∣ness and Help I was perswaded, and trusted accordingly: I depended and trusted on Thee as a Father, casting all my Cares upon Thee; so that I was careful for nothing: I learned to know my Duty, and the Way of its Perfor∣mance, and committed the Event of all to my LORD and Sovereign absolutely, without the least Reservation; being perswaded that he would completely fulfil all Things fully committed unto him, because he had promised; and would not make them ashamed, who placed their Con∣fidence in him. And now I may testify before the whole Creation, that thou hast been better to me, in my Pilgri∣mage, than I could imagine, or desire; and that the Lot Thou carved out for me, in Time, hath been best for me: I would not for Ten thousand Worlds it had been other∣wise, as to the smallest Dispensation; the most cross and Ruin-like Dispensations, as to Sense, have been the sweet∣est, having had the noblest Effects, and nearest Manife∣stations of thy Love and Sweetness accompanying them: If any have proved any Thing bitter and disadvantagi∣ous, it was because I brought them on my own Head, by my sacrilegious Boldness, in disposing of my Self, and what concerned me, without his Approbation and Consent: Yet, even these he turned to my Good; his Power being so transcendently excellent, as to bring

Light out of Darkness; and his Love being so bound∣less, to those whom he had chosen from Eternity, that he would suffer no Harm to befal them, but make all Things to contribute to their Good. O! can we but wonder at, and rejoice in the incomparable Condescendency, Wisdom and Excellency of our LORD, who hath con∣trived and effected our eternal Happiness after so stupen∣dious a Manner! Could we ruin our selves, since it was his Will to save? Could we in the least stand in the Way of our Happiness, since it was his sovereign eternal Plea∣sure, to make us as happy as can be? O eternal Asto∣nishment! the more we have undone our selves, the more he hath made us happy; the more we have degra∣ded our selves, the higher hath he exalted us; the more we have hated and provoked him, the more kind and in∣timate is he become to us!

Tho' he be infinitely above all the Praises of all possible Creatures; yet can we but cry him up, to whom all Glory is due? Are we not constrai∣ned, who see his Face, to express, and again and again throughout Eternity, to express his INFINITE PER∣FECTIONS? As Creatures, we are bound to be all for him; but these stupendious Obligations superadded, above all Production and Preservation, have elevated unto such a Frame, that common Tyes are almost swallowed up and evanished. O his Goodness, his Goodness! How great is his Goodness! and how great is his Beauty! Every Ray, every Outletting would ravish never so many Creatures. <HI>I will extol Thee, my GOD, O King, and I will bless the Name for ever and ever. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his Greatness is unsearchable. I will speak of the glorious Honour of thy Majesty, and I will declare thy Greatness. Yea, all thy Works shall praise Thee, O Lord, and all thy Saints shall bless Thee. While I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve, I will praise the Lord; I will sing Praises to my God, while I have my Being.

O Sing unto the Lord a new Song; Praise him in the Firmament of his Power; praise him for his mighty Acts; praise him, according to his excellent Greatness: For in this Day is the BRANCH of the Lord beautiful and glorious; and the Fruit of the Earth excellent and comely: For them that are escaped of</HI> Israel, <HI>and that are left in</HI> Zion, <HI>and that remain in</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>are called Holy. There hath come forth a ROD out of the</HI> Stem of Jesse, <HI>and a BRANCH hath grown out of his Roots; and the Spirit of the Lord doth rest upon him, the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, of Counsel, Might, Knowledge, and of the Fear of the Lord: With Righteousness doth he judge the Poor; and reprove with Equity, for the Meek of the Earth: And he smote the Earth with the Rod of his Mouth; and with the Breath of his Lips did he stay the Wicked. And Righteousness is the Girdle of his Loins, and Faithfulness the Girdle of his Reins. The Wolf doth dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard doth lie down with the Kid and the Calf, the young Lion and the Fatling together, and a little Child may lead them; for the Earth is full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.</HI> O Lord, <HI>Thou art my</HI> GOD, <HI>I will praise Thee, for thou hast done won∣derful Things; thy Counsels of old are Faithfulness and Truth: For thou hast brought down all those, that r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up against Thee; and art for a CROWN of Glory and a DIADEM of a Beauty to thy People.

We remember not the former Things, neither consider the Things of old: Behold, Thou dost a new Thing, and it springeth forth and we understand it: Thou dost even make a Way in the Wilderness, and Rivers in the Desert. The Beasts of the Field honour Thee, the Dragons arid the Owls; because Thou givest Water in the Wilderness, and Rivers in the Desert, to give Drink to thy People, thy Chosen.

In Famine he hath redeemed us from Death, and in War from the Power of the Sword; we have been hid from the Scourge of Tongues; neither were we afraid of Destru∣ction when it came: At Destruction and Famine we did laugh; we knew also that our Seed should be great, and our Off-spring as the Grass of the Earth; and that our Ene∣mies should for ever be made our Footstools: For thou hast destroyed them for ever, O GOD; and hast made them to fall by their own Counsels: Thou hast cast them out, in the Multitude of their Transgressions; for they rebelled a∣gainst thee. They are brought down, and fallen; but we are risen and stand upright; for thou hast saved the affli∣cted People, and hast brought down high Looks. We will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast lifted us up, and hast not made our Foes to rejoice over us: Thou hast brought up our Souls from the Grave; thou hast kept us alive, that we should not go down to the Pit. Sing unto the Lord, O ye Saints of his, and give Thanks, at the Re∣membrance of his Holiness; for his Anger endureth but for a Moment; in his Favour is Life. Weeping may en∣dure for a Night, but Joy cometh in the Morning.

to talk so poorly and childishly of such great and excel∣lent Things! A ready Way to bring down the low Thoughts, that the Sons of Men have of Thee, much lower! A Destruction to my Design here, — the Flower of my Desire, which is only to ravish the Judgments and Affections of the Sons of Men, concerning the Excellen∣cies of thy PERSON, the Greatness of thy Kingdom, and the Glory of thine Inheritance in the Saints, in Light. My dearest One, let this never see the Light, if it be apt to produce any other Effect. Pardon, dear LORD, my childish Boldness, and accept the <HI>Will</HI> for the <HI>Deed</HI>: Thou knowest, it is my Design, to set thee on high! But ah my Stupidity! Ah my childish Ignorance!

If, even now, I am wondering at my childish Expressions of such superexcellent Things, what will my Reflections be, when attained to the Ful∣ness of the Stature of Christ? It quiets my Mind somewhat, that I have expressed more, and ascended higher, than the Conceptions of most; and that all Expressions, and Dis∣courses of sublunary Excellencies shall blush and think Shame to appear here: And that tho', whatever I shall be able to say, be unw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rthy of the meanest of thy Saints; yet, may it be an Occasion, to some of them of stirring themselves up to a more heavenly Frame of Spirit, and more serious and profound Apprehensions of the Things that are invisible.</P>

Is it pos∣sible you can bear the Fore-tho'ts of what you are co∣ming to? Shall you ever be able to pluck your Minds down from such ravishing Things? Have not all sub∣lunary Excellencies disappeared in your Sight? What are the Stars, when the Sun doth appear?

You Delights, you Sorrows of Time, you are much over∣looked by me, while I ly thus, within the View of eternal Ravishments. One Moment's immediate Converse with JEHOVAH, and the LAMB, shall eradicate all the Im∣pressions of Sorrow and Grief, that I can possibly under∣go. Shall I not see him, as he is? Am I not to see him Face to Face? These Arms, even these very Arms, shall embrace the Chief of Ten thousand: I shall be for ever satiate with his infinite Sweetness; even drunk and over∣filled with his overcoming Loves. O the Frame of my Spirit! I can say nothing; Expressions fail me, for re∣presenting the high Thoughts of my Heart! Where am I now? Am I not almost in Heaven already? Heart, and Love, and all have fled thither; nothing remains here, but this vile Clay tabernacle; and, ere it be long, it shall be there also.

Foolishness of your by past Vanity, in spending your Strength for transient, evanishing Shadows? Are you not almost beginning to fall in Love with our blessed Country? Yea, are you not content to renounce the Love of your Dunghil for it? Are you not come to such a blessed Change, in your Tho'ts? Come hither, the Bargain is done, Heaven is yours; for it is, Love, and have it. What mean you Sirs? Why should any of you thus stand wavering? Must you not have Heaven? If you lose it, what can you purchase? Is there any Impedi∣ment? Be willing, and welcome. Dare any of you doubt of the Reality of the only real Things? What, because they fall not under your brutish Senses? Then you may doubt whether you conceive, or not. Are ye such Brutes, as to think, there is no Up-taking but sen∣sual, when the mental are Myriads of Stages more evident and real? Sirs, can there be any so mad, as deny all the Countries he never saw with his Eyes; when attested by Multitudes of Eye-witnesses, of diverse Sorts and Ages? And have not Numbers, of all Ranks and Conditions, of the most Excellent in all Ages, attested their most excellent Discoveries of this happy World? One of whose Atte∣stations is more worthy, than the Testimony of Ten thou∣sand of ordinary Men. O Sirs, want of Consideration causeth you to look upon the only substantial Things, as uncertain Fancies. But consider Eternity seriously, and you shall find your selves moved in another Manner, than those, who are led away with <HI>Enthusiasms.</HI> Sirs, enter into your own Hearts, enquire at your Consciences, and you shall find Heaven and Hell written upon them.

What! shall your Thoughts be so superficial and transient, as you shall undergo no Transformation in the Spirit of your Minds; but still remain earthly? What, still earthly? and presently back to Earth again! Are you like earthly Exhalations, which by Bensil of a slight fiery Impression, tho' seen while aloft, yet still retaining the drossie Nature, they fall down again. Shall Glory be so soon forgotten, as if it were like a <HI>Nine-Days Wonder</HI>? How are you af∣fected? Are you not in some heavenly Frame? And will you suffer it to evanish by Negligence, vain Conceits, worldly Thoughts and Words, and fleshly Lusts? Shall Dunghil-earth eclipse the ravishing View, you have got∣ten?

What lets you then, that you become not heavenly and divine? Are you not altogether in Love with our WELBELOVED, the Author of all? Are you not closing with him, on his own Terms, as he hath offered himself, in his Testament?

<P>We have written unto you, Worldlings, what we have seen and found, that you may know that there are excel∣lent Things indeed, which never fell under your brutish Senses; and to let you know that Godliness is another Manner of Thing, than ever entred within your Concep∣tions, that you may enquire after the Reality of such ex∣cellent Things, and strive to get a Sight of him, who is invisible; that in seeing, you may love him; &amp; in loving, may be blessed for evermore. Poor Worldlings, we can∣not but pity you, who cannot pity your selves: You see not your own base and low Condition; for if you could, your Condition were changed. Were it possible to de∣monstrate your Vileness and Misery? Are you affected with nothing so much, as what falls under your Senses? What Preheminence have you above the Brutes of the Field! The Joys and Desires and Intentions of both are confined within an Inch of Time: Both are earthly, Loth are temporal, both decay in a Moment, and come
<PB N="219" REF="005510_0110_10184A2F0F4F99F8"/>
to Nought. I appeal to your selves, base Worldlings, If they may be termed high-spirited, whose Thoughts and Projects are only upon Earth, the Fashion of which pas∣seth away; as you cannot but perceive with your very bodily Senses. Ah Sirs, is it not even sad? Earth is the Centre of all your Love and Desires; earthly Glo∣ry, earthly Riches, earthly Delight affects you most; let you have Abundance of Earth, and that eternally, and eternally you can live without the Enjoyment of JEHOVAH and the LAMB: The Kingdom above these visible Heavens appears strange <HI>Utopian</HI>-like Inven∣tions, which, tho' ye give an historical Faith to, yet you are affected little or nothing with the News of such as∣tonishing Things; and labour and endeavour, and pro∣ject more for these perishing Things: Which snows, You are base Earth-worms, who have chosen this Dung∣hil for your Country; despised and undervalued the en∣during Substance; and have not stirr'd up your selves, to the deep Perswasion of the Truth, and Reality of such wonderful Things; but embrace Earth, and confess your selves its Natives, and home-born Slaves. May you not at last see your own Baseness and Slavery? Are you not ashamed of your former Vileness? Are you not be∣ginning to perceive, that the Saints are the only excel∣lent and noble Persons? Are you not looking upon it, as the greatest Misery and Baseness, to be earthly in your Mind and Affections? Are you not accounting it the only Dignity and Accomplishment, to be humble and di∣vine? Again, we beseech you to be ingenuous, and not to lull your selves asleep, in Security's Lap, with a Num∣ber of careless <HI>Will-bees,</HI> and <HI>May-bees.</HI> What, Sirs? Confess you the Reality of these wonderful Things to come? Confess you, that Heaven and Hell is the eternal Lot of all Mankind? Which of them are you making for? You know, according to your Preparations here, so are you hereafter to be; as you sow, shall you not reap? If you sow to the Flesh, shall you not reap
<PB N="220" REF="005510_0111_10184A30A39C12D8"/>
Corruption? And if you sow to the Spirit, shall you not reap eternal Life? Whether will you travel the Way to the one or the other? Choose you: GOD sets <HI>Life and Death before you</HI>; beguile not your selves; <HI>God will not be mocked.</HI> Will you remain earthly; and yet think to enter the pure heavenly City? Is there a Foot-breadth for Earth-worms there? If earthly-minded Creatures, re∣maining earthly, may expect to enter the fair and clean <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> then shall Heaven be filled with all Sorts of Cattle, and Hell shall be for ever empty; which is indeed the Opinion of stupid Worldlings, whose extensive Chari∣ty reaches all Men that ever were, or shall be: Who are of so sweet and mild a Disposition, as that they dare not, cannot judge any, and are not ashamed to say of the basest Dunghil Worldling, <HI>It may be he has somewhat Good.</HI> But, believe it, Earthly-mindedness is a palpable gross Vileness, to all, who have their Senses, in the least, exercised. Enter your own Hearts, poor Wretches, and behold your own Practice, and the Practice of the Gene∣rality of all who are about you; and you shall perceive your selves smell strongly of Earth. Do not all your Aims and Projects tend Earth-ward? Are not your last Tho'ts in the Evening, your first Thoughts in the Morning, the most of your Thoughts all the Day long, running upon lower Concernments? Earth, only Earth, fills your base Minds: Few, transient and brutish are your Conceptions of Things above: Eternity you make your By-aim, and Earth your chief Design. Do you not esteem earthly Glo∣ry and Riches most? Are not these, who are most ladned with the thick Clay of the Earth, greatest in your Eyes? Had you not rather have wealthiest, the Men of most Account and Power in Time, to be allied to you, than the afflicted People? Can you not converse familiarly with Dunghil-worldlings, without any Trouble or Antipathy? Yea, have ye not the cursed Heart, to become one Flesh with a black Lump of Death and Hell, if so be they be laden with the Earth's worm-eaten Trash, or please your
<PB N="221" REF="005510_0111_10184A30A39C12D8"/>
carnal Inclination, and foolish Fancy? Are you not more taken up with your own private, petty affairs, than with the great Concernments of Christ, and his Church? Have you not more Delight in earthly Enjoyments, than in the Exercises of Godliness? Are you not more sensible of your temporal Losses, than of your spiritual? Do not your Joys <HI>ebb</HI> &amp; <HI>flow,</HI> according to the Ebbings and Flowings of worldly Things? Are you not ignorant of <HI>Rejoicing in Tribulation,</HI> because of the Smiles of Jeho∣vah's amiable Countenance? And of <HI>Sorrowing,</HI> in the midst of earthly Abundance, because the WELBELOVED hath <HI>frowned, with dawn himself, &amp; is gone</HI>? Worldlings, Is it not even thus with you? Let your Consciences speak, Men and Women; O hear them, that God may hear you. I say, Is it not most evident to your selves, that thus it is with you? And are you for Glory? Are you for the clean and holy City? Are you for <HI>dwelling with e∣verlasting Burning</HI>? Are you for walking with the Lamb, clothed with the white and beautiful Garments of Holiness? Are you for standing among the fair delight∣som Assembly of Saints and Angels, who eternally sur∣round the Throne of Jehovah and the Lamb? Are you? Ye base Worldlings, as long as ye are what you are, you have nothing to do with Glory: Stand aback, <HI>touch not the Mount.</HI> Beasts are not to meddle with so great Things: Heaven is only for holy Ones; for <HI>with∣out Holiness no Man shall see the Lord.</HI> Believe it, Sirs, you are Ten thousand Miles from Holiness: Holiness is a strange, unknown Thing in the World: The most refined <HI>Moralists, Civilians, Carnal Gospellers,</HI> and brave <HI>Forma∣lists,</HI> have scarce heard the Sound thereof: <HI>There is a Path that no Fowl knoweth,</HI> and <HI>which the Vulture's Eye hath the seen,</HI> and <HI>the Lion's Whelps have not troden it, nor the fierce Lion passed by it.</HI> But, <HI>where shall Wisdom be found? And where is the Place of Understanding? Man knoweth not the Price thereof; neither is it found in the Land of the Living</HI>: The Depth saith, <HI>It is not in me</HI>;
<PB N="222" REF="005510_0112_10184A34B48FFE60"/>
And the Sea saith, <HI>It is not with me. It cannot be gotten for Gold; neither shall Silver be weighed for the Price thereof: No Mention shall be made of Coral, or of Pearls; for the Price of Wisdom is above Rubies.</HI></P>
<P>Believe it, Holiness, or Wisdom, is a rare Thing: A Saint is a Wonder. God hath placed them among the nume∣rous Multitude of Mankind, like so many Signs and Won∣ders: So many Saints in the World, so many Miracles of Nature: A Saint, in the Kalender of the Generality of Professors, is an ordinary Person; but, in Christ's, most extraordinary. There are fewer real Christians, than the most precise, and strictest in their Censures, can ima∣gine. If the Nature of Holiness were well known, we should wonder, that there is, among all Mortals, one ho∣ly One; for, in very Truth, a Saint is nothing else, but a Piece of Heaven, a new Creature, transformed from the Image of Hell, into that of Glory, One whose Conver∣sation is only above, who is <HI>come unto Mount</HI> Zion, <HI>and unto the City of the living God</HI>: A Saint hath not the Stamp and Fashion of this World; his Heart and Love are quite gone from him to another Place; his Words, his Actions, his Deportment manifest <HI>he seeks a Country</HI> a∣bove, and that he despiseth and overlooks all Things here, as Things inconsiderable, dead and crucified in his Eyes: His Joys, his Pleasures, his Contentments, his Treasures lie not here: His Torments, his Griefs, his Misery lies not in temporal Things; his Mind is elevated far above the Laughings or Frownings of a transitory World: Its Ups and Downs, its Ebbings and Flowings cannot affect him: His sublime Mind is set upon higher Objects; for he <HI>looks not to the Things that are seen; but to the Things that are not seen: For the Things that are seen, are tempo∣ral; but the Things that are not seen, are eternal.</HI> Heaven is his Soil, his Element, the Centre of his Love and Desires: He longs, he prays, he greatly desires, he weeps to be there. The Desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the full and naked Embracements of <HI>The Chiefest of Ten thousand,</HI> overtops, and swallows up his
<PB N="223" REF="005510_0112_10184A34B48FFE60"/>
Desire and Love to all other Things. What tho' he hath fair, pleasant Possessions of Earth, many dear Friends, and pleasant Companions? What tho' he have an excellent Wife, and hopeful Children? All these are but <HI>Dross</HI> and <HI>Dung,</HI> unto the very <HI>Knowledge of the Excellency of JE∣SUS</HI> his LORD: They are good and pleasant, but no∣thing to the only WELBELOVED. He can leave them all gladly, to be with him. O my Comfort, my Children, my Friends, my Possessions, my Hopes here away, my Life, I could not but with exceeding great Grief, be thus separate from you, were I not going to One, who is sweeter, dearer and more lovely to me, above all Expres∣sion, than you all: The Loss of all Things is no Loss; if I go to the full Enjoyment of Him, whom my Soul lo∣veth. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven, or on Earth, but Him?</HI> Whom do I love and desire, but Him? No Enjoyments whatsoever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n quench my Longing to be with Him: He is my All, and only One. Farewel, all lower Enjoyments, the Love of my fairest WELBELOVED swallows up all other Loves. Be closed, my blessed Senses, from receiv∣ing any more sublunary Objects, that ye may be ever∣lastingly filled with his transcendent Loveliness, Sweet∣ness and Excellency. And no Wonder the Saint cannot want Christ, since he is transformed into his lovely Image, a Partaker of his divine Nature; one, who is endued with the same Mind that was in him; one, who hath Christ <HI>dwelling in him</HI>; one, who hath <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven within him</HI>: So that it is natural unto him to tend God-ward, and Heaven-ward; even as it is natural for the Worldling to tend Earth-ward and Hell-ward. Every Thing hath a Propensity and Love to its own Centre and Like; and bends off from its Opposite: The Fire ascends towards the Centre and great Glob of Fire; every Bit of Earth disjoined, tends back to the whole again. Tho' there were neither Reward, nor Punishment; yet a holy One must love, serve, obey, praise and adore his God; for Heaven must operate like Heaven, even necessarily, tho'
<PB N="224" REF="005510_0113_10184A272A1F91C0"/>
freely, sweetly, and without Compulsion. Again, World∣lings must tend Earth-ward, tho' they should find never so much Vexation, Torment and Grief in it; tho' he should never be so often threatned, and perswaded of all the Miseries that follow an earthly, sensual and brutish Way of living; since he is all Sense, Earth and Corrup∣tion, altogether destitute of the Divine Nature: In a Word, a Worldling is a visible incarnate Devil; a Saint, a visible incarnate Angel: Only Hell, on this Side of Time, is not fully accomplished in the one; nor Heaven fully perfected in the other. The holy One smells strongly of Glory; and the nearer he approacheth to his Journey's End, the more resplendent a Lustre hath he of Heaven: <HI>The Path of the Just</HI> being <HI>as the shining Light, that shi∣neth more and more unto the perfect Day.</HI> O Tincture of Heaven! Their Actions have still a greater Smell of Glo∣ry; but all is nothing to the Glory and Excellency of their invisible and inward Operation: Little or nothing appears without, in Comparison of that which is within. O the noble and seraphick Thoughts! O the strange Mo∣tions of Love, and Joy, and Admiration, above all possi∣ble Expression! O the ravishing Perfumes of passing Joys and Sweetness, wherewith the Beloved fills the Heart! It is impossible for the Saint, to put down in Black and White, what he feels on his Soul: All the Tongues of Men and Angels cannot manifest his sweet and noble Thoughts of his only WELBELOVED. He would glad∣ly express them to all that are about him, but he finds it impossible. He is sometimes contending with his nar∣row Fancy, that it cannot find out a more sublime, clear and excellent Way of expressing the matchless Worth of his Welbeloved: Other whiles, he is angry at the cold, shallow and putid Manner of others Discoursing: He would have all Men speak nobly, write nobly, do nobly, for Jesus. Nothing vexeth him more than to perceive the Generality of Men forget him: Or, when they speak of him, to talk so coldly and creepingly, as if he were a
<PB N="225" REF="005510_0113_10184A272A1F91C0"/>
common, ordinary Beloved. He would have his Lovely One filling the Hearts and Mouths of all: He hates the Fellowship where he is not highly esteemed, loved, praised and adored: He greatly honours, and loves that, (tho' otherwise never so low and despicable) where he is prai∣sed, worshipped and much accounted of. It is his conti∣nual Torment and Affliction, he hath so low and unbe∣seeming Thoughts of him: He is in great Rage at his Heart, that it should, at any Time, go astray, from such an excellent Object, after Vanity: He lays Bands on, watcheth over, and commands his Heart, that it have no∣ble and excellent Thoughts of him; and entertain no other Beloveds beside him: He desires Nothing more, than to have his Heart wholly set upon him, and forever ravished and overcome with his Love. And no Wonder; since Christ, and he are One; One in Nature, Mind, Affections, Spirit, and all Things: As the Lord Jesus is, so is he, in a great Part. Every one of the Saints resem∣bles the Children of the King of Kings: Among all the Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> there are none their like; for they are <HI>a chosen Generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People; that they should shew forth the Praises of him, who hath called them out of Darkness unto his mar∣vellous Light.</HI> The Generality of Mankind hath, ever from the very Beginning, looked upon them, as strange Manner of Persons, &amp; nick-named them with various and strange Sorts of Names, according to the Iniquities of the Times and Places they lived in, because of their Rare∣ness in Number, Singularity in their Way of Living and Practice, Preciseness in their Principles, and oppo∣sing the Sins of the Times their Lot is cast into.</P>
<P>Ah! poor Worldlings, do ye not see, that a Saint is an∣other Manner of Person than you imagined? Do you not perceive, that you are as far below real Holiness, as Earth is below Heaven? Is it not manifested to yourselves, that you are not the Creatures, whose Minds and Affec∣tions are heavenly and divine? that you are not of a
<PB N="226" REF="005510_0114_101812E6CA0C0D50"/>
more noble and excellent Spirit than your Neighbours? True, your own desperate, deceitful Heart will cause you to imagine your selves rare Pieces of Excellency; yet it will give you no Demonstration, but only cause I, as such, appear great; and so confound every Thing, as you may evade us, one Way or another. So desperate are Worldlings, that they cannot abide to examine their Con∣ditions; and when others hold out the Light, that they may discover them, they wink, lest they behold their own Misery and Vileness. But, Worldlings, may you not see your Nakedness, If you will but ask seriously, at your selves, a few ordinary Questions, and solve them faithfully, according to the answer of your Conscience?</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Have you ever felt the Pangs of the new Birth? Are you Strangers to this? Know you not, <HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?</HI> This is strange! A Saint, a regenerate Crea∣ture, a Man born over again; and yet without Pain, or Labour! Such a great Mutation, without great Symp∣toms and Concomitants, cannot be. Ah! most Men's Religion hath come to them in a Night-dream.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Were you ever at <HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> Here, blessed Jesus, I subscribe a Blank, put in any Thing thou wilt; and, in thy Strength, I will gladly endea∣vour the Performance of all; only save me; O save me, else I eternally perish. It is strange, you have not come this Length that many Reprobates have come, and yet imagine your selves Saints.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> Hath the great Salvation appeared so great, in your Eyes, filled so your Minds, that it hath overtop∣ped, and swallowed up the Thoughts of all other Con∣cernments? Are you not come this far, that some Re∣probates have, for a Time, attained unto? And can you imagine your selves Partakers of the great Salvation? Ah, mad Delusion!</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> Were you ever sick of Sin? Have you been more burdened under your Iniquities, than ever you were
<PB N="227" REF="005510_0114_101812E6CA0C0D50"/>
under an earthly Affliction? Do you not find the grievous Weight of a Body of Death? Yea, go you not lightly under your Iniquities? Only some of the grossest of them torment your natural Conscience; As for Ori∣ginal Sin, your know it more by Speculation, than by Feeling: This doth show you are dead <HI>in Sins and Tres∣passes, alienated from the Life of God.</HI> Can you then imagine your self such a noble Creature as a Saint?</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly.</HI> Were you ever sick of Love for JESUS? Were you ever running after him, with the Tear in your Eye, with your Hands upon your aking Sores? Were you ever weeping, and groaning, and sighing at his Feet, for Mercy, and Pardon, and Reconciliation, and the Lifting-up of his amiable Countenance? Were you ever wrestling with Sin, as for your Life, and saying, Blessed Jesus, I must have Thee; Thee to be my Lord, my Head, my Advocate, my King, my Priest, my Prophet, my only Beloved, or I cannot live? Ah! Sirs, you, who know not experimentally what I am saying, have your Religion to seek yet.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>thly.</HI> Were you ever crying, as it were, <HI>O Daughters of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>I charge you, if you see my Beloved that you tell him, that I am sick of Love?</HI> Have you been fainting, because of an absent and withdrawing Lord? Have you had a wearisom Night without Sleep for Christ, because you could not find him? Know you not, by Experience, what I am saying? O then! you are Strangers to Christ.</P>
<P N="7">7<HI>thly.</HI> Are not your Thoughts of Christ so high, that you cannot, in the thousandth Part, express them to others? Are not all Things Dross and Dung to you, in Comparison of Christ? If you can express all your Thoughts of him, you want the Mind of a Saint.</P>
<P N="8">8<HI>thly.</HI> Though an eternal Enjoyment of all possible created Paradises of Joy and Delight, filled with all Smells, all Tastes, all Sights, all Melodies, all Delights the Heart of Man can imagine, were placed on the one
<PB N="228" REF="005510_0115_101849C177301CE0"/>
Hand; and the eternal Enjoying, Praising, and Adoring JEHOVAH and the LAMB, on the other; which of these two Lives would your Heart most affect, and run after: It may be, you will say, <HI>I had rather enjoy Christ, than all Things.</HI> How then comes it to pass, you long not to be with him? How comes it to pass, you have more Delight in earthly Enjoyments, than in the Exer∣cises of Godliness? Why is Meditating on him, the Ex∣cellency of his Person, and the Glory of his Kingdom, so melancholious, and seldom an Exercise! Why are you not making it your Study and Delight, to keep up a near and intimate Fellowship with the Father, and the Son? Ah! poor Things, you are altogether ignorant of your selves; and therefore you talk, and you know not what.</P>
<P N="9">9<HI>thly.</HI> Find you in your Soul a strong and ardent Longing and Desire after God, and still to have more and more of him, till you be filled with all his Fulness? Have you a greater Thirst after him, than ever you had after cold Water in an unquenchable Thirst, through a burning Fever, or great Heat, Labour and Weariness? Surely, if you be Partakers of his Nature, you cannot but bend to him with a strong Bensil. Are your De∣sires after him cold and indifferent, and broken Cisterns can quench your Thirst! Be assured, you are dead, and have not your Senses exercised.</P>
<P N="10">10<HI>thly.</HI> Can you discern betwixt the Exercises of Godliness, and God in the Exercise? Are you some∣times seeking him, and cannot find him? Are you not calling unto him, and he gives no Answer? Are you ignorant of a mutual Converse with him? Find you not him speaking into your Heart, as really as you spake up to him? Know ye not what it is, to receive an Answer of Prayer? Ah! ye are Strangers to the My∣stery of Godliness.</P>
<P N="11">11<HI>thly.</HI> Find you more Delight in his Fellowship, when you are alone, than ever you found in all your
<PB N="229" REF="005510_0115_101849C177301CE0"/>
earthly Enjoyments? Have you not been brought into his Chambers of Love, and rejoiced and been glad in Him? Have you not found his Love better than Wine, and the Savour of his good Ointments most cheering and refreshing? Nay, found you not, in some Measure, to your own sweet Experience, all the Intercourses written down in the <HI>Song of Songs</HI>? What say you? Are you Strangers to these Things; and yet, an espoused Soul to Christ? That cannot be.</P>
<P N="12">12<HI>thly.</HI> Have you not a Respect to all his Command∣ments, since you have resigned your self wholly over to him, without Reservation? Dare you contradict a known Precept, and can sacrilegiously cut and carve upon his Latter will, and put your own carnal Glosses upon his clear Commands, for your own worldly and carnal Ends? And yet Saints! and yet Lovers of JESUS! That's impossible.</P>
<P N="13">13<HI>thly.</HI> Doth your Goodness reach the Saints, <HI>the Excellent of the Earth,</HI> in whom is all your Delight? Is there any in your Eyes, by a thousand Stages, so great, as a Saint? Is not a Creature the more lovely, excel∣lent and esteemed in your Eyes, the more wise he is, the more he is like All-lovely Jesus? As for the several Fan∣cies of Riches and Honour, you value them not, these are not the Things that heighten and depress Persons in your Account: But on the contrary, are you the People, that esteem Persons, according to Gay-clothing, Multi∣tude of Trash, much of earthly Honour, Power, Autho∣rity and Renown? Affect you more to have a really ho∣nourable Consort, Children, Kinsmen, and Friends, than to have them wise and holy? Art thou such a Creature, that thou lovest the Converse of the Wealthy and Prosperous; and can take a Wordling, known to be such, to be the inseparable Companion of thy Life, be∣cause of worldly Advantages; And can converse famili∣arly and merrily with Worldlings, without any Antipa∣thy, or Hurt to the Frame of thine Heart? Art thou such
<PB N="230" REF="005510_0116_101849C4C40D23D0"/>
an one, and yet a Saint? Ah! poor Thing, thou art a Stranger to Holiness. It may be thou art a Formalist; that is, a Person illuminated, who hath a Custom of reading, and conferring, and meditating, and praying; and it may be, weeping, and hearing the best, it may be with Jeopardie; but the Life and Marrow of Religion thou art altogether ignorant of.</P>
<P N="14">14<HI>thly.</HI> Do not the Affairs of Christ's Church through the World, and especially through the particular Church He doth most own, lie nearer your Heart, than all other Things? May you not say, <HI>If I forget thee,</HI> O Zion, <HI>let my Right-hand forget her Cunning; If I prefer not</HI> Jerusa∣lem <HI>to my chiefest Joy</HI>? Are not your own Affairs oft-times forgotten by you; so much are you taken up with the Affairs of CHRIST? That Christ may be great, his Interests glorious, and his People exalted, is the Flower and Top of your Desires. You are exceeding angry against, not only his open persecuting Enemies, but all who are indifferent or luke-warm in his Mat∣ters; Thou canst abide none, but the zealous Ones; Art thou not, as it were, burnt up with Zeal for the Glory of the only excellent ONE? So, that thou art crying out, <HI>Let the Sinners be consumed from the Earth; Let the Wicked be no more; Let all his Enemies perish; but let those, that love Him, be like the Sun, going forth in his Strength.</HI> But on the contrary, do thine own Af∣fairs share largest of thy Thoughts? thou art oft-times so occupied with them, that the Affairs of <HI>Zion</HI> are al∣most forgotten: It may be, thou wishes well unto her, and had rather she did swim, than sink; yea, would undergo a considerable Loss, upon Condition she might be exalted: But wouldst thou have the Affairs of Christ great, meerly out of Desire to his Glory and Exaltation? Dost thou desire the Rising of his Interests, tho' it were upon thy Fall and Ruin? Are thy great Affairs, even what concerneth Life, and the greatest Affairs of thine own, small, and of no Consideration in thine Eyes, in
<PB N="231" REF="005510_0116_101849C4C40D23D0"/>
Comparison of the smallest Things of CHRIST? Yea, art thou not One, who can overlook, and cede many Things to the Enemy? <HI>Not an Hoof,</HI> is too great Pre∣ciseness to Thee. And is not thy Hatred, and Indigna∣tion, at his Enemies, weak and indiscernable? Thou canst hear his Work and People spoken Evil of, unconcern∣edly, and be little or nothing moved: Thou art a very meek and moderate Man in his Cause; and art thou one of his? Hath he the Flower of thy Love? Is that <HI>Love</HI> burning in thine Heart, <HI>which many Waters cannot quench</HI>? Art thou a genuine Son of <HI>Zion?</HI> Never think it; poor deluded Creature, thou hast Religion yet to seek.</P>
<P N="15">15<HI>thly.</HI> Do all earthly Things appear dead and cru∣cified-like unto thee? Dost thou look upon this Earth as a melancholick Wilderness? And hast thine Heart and Eyes still upon thy Country? Yea, dost thou look with a disdainful Eye upon this base World, so full of Wickedness, Vexation, and Vanity; wherein thy Lord, and all his Followers, have got so bad Entertainment? But, on the contrary, dost thou look upon thine Enjoy∣ments in a lovely and warmly Manner, and hast sweeter and more pleasant Thoughts of them, than of the Life to come? When the World smiles upon thee, dost thou smile upon it again; and canst easily bear the Want of the full Enjoyment of GOD; being so well pleased with an easy, earthly Life, either in Reality, or in Imagination; as thou art saying to thy self, <HI>It is good to be here</HI>? Art thou thus, and yet a Saint, a Pil∣grim, who is travelling heaven ward, a Creature, whose Heart and Love is in another Country, and not here? This is a Repugnancy; never think it, Man: Think thy self the Thing thou art, <HI>an Home-born Slave</HI>; and then thou art a Step in the Way to true Liberty.</P>
<P N="16">16<HI>thly.</HI> Art thou longing to be in the immediate Embra∣ces <HI>of the Chief of Ten thousand</HI>? To behold <HI>him Face to Face,</HI> and be satiate with his immediate Fellowship? Is it
<PB N="232" REF="005510_0117_101849C90C5CFA60"/>
oft the Cry of thy longing Heart, <HI>When shall I see him as he is,</HI> and that white and beautiful Company following him <HI>whithersoever he goes</HI>? When shall I see the Bride∣groom and the Bride kiss and embrace one another? When shall he set his majestick Head thro' these visible Heavens, and appear in his royal Marriage-robes, before the whole Creation? Ah! the envious Heavens, that hide him from my longing Eyes! Ah! the longsom Days, that ly betwixt me and him! When shall we be eternal∣ly in others immediate Embraces? But on the contrary, canst thou live contentedly, in the Midst of earthly A∣bundance, with small or no Desires of his immediate Fel∣lowship? Is this the ordinary Frame of thy Spirit: And yet a Saint! It cannot be. Can the chaste Spouse not long for her absent Bridegroom? Can the true Lover live patiently, without beholding the Beloved's Face? Ah! Sirs, you have not been really espoused to him. Have you not received his Love-tokens, nor been ravished with the Smell of his fragrant Ointments? and what Wonder, you are as you are?</P>
<P N="17">17<HI>thly.</HI> Are you depending on God in every Thing? Acknowledge you him in all your Ways, and in every Exigency that befals you? <HI>Cast you all yours Cares upon him,</HI> and <HI>trust in him</HI> for all Things in Time and Eter∣nity? So that you find your Mind greatly eased; as ha∣ving One to your Father, who is both able and willing to carry you thro' all Difficulties and Afflictions? Are you endeavouring to do his Commandments, and commit the Event of all absolutely unto him, who, you know, brings all to a good Issue? Have you renounced the Dis∣posing of your selves, and resigned that, with all your Concerns, even unto him? And dare not do any Thing without his Approbation? Or, on the contrary, do you rely on this Thing, and that Thing? If there be Money in the Purse, or <HI>Calves in the Stall,</HI> then you hope, you shall not want: You trust in hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ane Probabilities; but if those fail you, you are dispondent; Thou hast not the
<PB N="233" REF="005510_0117_101849C90C5CFA60"/>
Confidence in GOD, that may hold up thy Heart, in as cheerful a Condition, as <HI>when Corn and Wine abounded</HI> unto Worldlings. Thou cannot lay as much Weight on the large Promises in the Book of GOD, as Worldlings on their Charters in earthly Possessions; and therefore, thou art ever anxious about the event, and commits not the Disposing of thy self to him: Thou walkest by the Compass of Riches, Ease, Reputation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And whether it be the Will of Christ, is thy last Consideration: Whether it be a Course, that will most glorify him, and make thy Progress swifter to Glory, doth not so much trouble thee; as whether it be a Course, will render thee prosperous, full of Ease, Wealth and Esteem in a World. Doth thine Heart dictate unto thee such an Occupation, such a Mar∣riage, and such an Interprize will bring in great Wealth, much worldly Joy, a Multitude of Friends, greater world∣ly Honour, <HI>&amp;c</HI>? Therefore it is to be followed. Ah! deluded Wretch, walkest thou by earthly, carnal Rules; and yet such a noble Creature, as a Saint? Never enter∣tain such Fancies: The Saints walk as Christ walked, He is their Fore-runner, and Captain.</P>
<P>The Difference between a Saint and a Worldling, may, in some Manner, be apprehended from what we have spo∣ken. Ask seriously, at your selves, such Questions; re∣flect upon your Way of Walking; see what is the con∣stant Frame of your Heart, and what your Heart affects most; what your have been, and what you are aiming at, and seeking most; what you rejoice most in; what the Thoughts and Intentions of your Heart run out most up∣on. O Sirs, be not beguiled in so weighty a Concern∣ment: If you err here, you are eternally undone: It is Satan's great Endeavour, to hinder you from considering your self, or your Condition; he delights to see you pass away your Time, in considering your natural Abili∣ties, your corporal Endowments, your Estate in the World, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But he is afraid you consider your spiri∣tual Estate, how it stands betwixt God and you; whe∣ther
<PB N="234" REF="005510_0118_101849CBB020D8B8"/>
you be in friendly Terms with him, or not: If not, how you may attain unto a near Fellowship; and how you may keep your self in his Love and Favour, and grow more and more familiar with him. He loves, and endeavours to divert your Mind off eternal Concernments to temporal. But, Sirs, ought you not to give Eternity the first Place, the First, and Flower, and Choice and Might of all your Endeavours? Make sure Work in so great, great a Matter: Thy eternal Weal, or Wo, is upon the Wheels, Man; what shall be your Lot through∣out endless Ages, is a Concernment above all you can con∣ceive, or endeavour. Knowest thou not how the Matter stands? Is not the Time short, thou hast to prepare thy self i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o? Is not thy Life most uncertain? Is not the Work of Salvation a great, a long, a difficult Work? Is it not most ordinary, that Men die, as they live; and most certain, that their eternal Condition is, as they die? Knowest thou not, that it is written, <HI>To Day, if ye will hear my Voice, harden not your Hearts? Thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> Come, O come, and embrace so friendly a Call. Have you any Excuse? Are you about any Business of such Concernment? Is any suc∣ceeding Hour better than now? Doth not thine Heart draw on a new Scruff of Hardness? Why then, fall to Work in good earnest, as for Life and Death: Make sure Work, build not upon Sand, but on the Rock? Never rest, till you have Christ indeed, and not some Fancy in his Place; be sure you get an Interest in him. Never think your selves right, until you have a familiar and lively <HI>Fellowship with the Father and the Son</HI>; until there be mutual Communications of Love betwixt Christ and you; until you have heartily, and for ever, given your self wholly over to him, and taken him wholly over to you, to be your King, Priest and Prophet; to be your All, and only One; until you be enamoured with his matchless Beauty, overcome with his passing Sweetness; until Earth, in its best Condition, be an empty Nothing,
<PB N="235" REF="005510_0118_101849CBB020D8B8"/>
and Vanity in your Eyes; until Heaven become your na∣tive Country, were Heart, and Love, and all do ly; so that it shall be as natural for you to be heavenly-minded, as for Earth-worms to be earthly. O then! we shall greet you, by the excellent and princely Name of Saints. O then, you shall be no more Beasts, but Crea∣tures of an high and seraphick Nature, the Sons and Mini∣ons of the High and Lofty One; the Princes &amp; Heirs of Heaven, and Earth, and all Things; for then <HI>all Things are yours, whether</HI> Paul, <HI>or</HI> Apollos, <HI>or</HI> Cephas, <HI>or the World, or Life, or Death, or Things present, or Things to come: All are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</HI></P>

<P>DIspatch, O WELBELOVED, and hasten the Day of our eternal Marriage; put Time, and Days out of the Way: Great Things hast thou to do, before thou descend visibly to this lower World: Thou hast been making great Dispatch, since thou ascended; and still the nearer thy second Coming, thou still hastenest thy Work the more: These few Years immediately preceed∣ing, How hast thou put many and great Things through thy Hand? And now thy Kingdom is upon the advancing Hand; tho' it seem almost all tottering and decaying. That great and glorious Work, thou promisedst of old, is just now in the Birth, and near the breaking forth: Thy grand Enemies have begun to fall before Thee, and have still lost Ground; and tho' now they seem to have the Advantage, it is but in Appearance: Thou art but making thy self to flee before them, that thou mayest draw them all out after Thee; but, ere ever they shall be aware, thou wilt make thine Ambushcado's to assault them on the

Reer; and in a Trice thou wilt environ them on every Side, give them an irreparable Rout. Thou art, O migh∣ty Captain, as it were, retiring thy self, that thou mayest come back on thine Enemies with the greater Force: Thou art at the crying out, <HI>Ah! I will ease me of mine Adversaries, and avenge me of mine Enemies:</HI> For, <HI>be∣hold, thou makest the Earth empty, and makest it waste, and turnest it up-side down, and scatterest abroad the Inha∣bitants thereof: Thou art coming out of thy Place, to pu∣nish the Inhabitants of the Earth, for their Iniquity</HI>; for, <HI>Thou shalt rise up, as in Mount</HI> Perazzim; <HI>Thou shalt be wroth, as in the Valley of</HI> Gibeon; <HI>that thou mayest do thy Work, thy strange Work; and bring to pass thy Act, thy strange Act. At the Noise of the Tumult, the People shall flee; at the Lifting up of thy self, the Nations shall be scat∣tered, and their Spoil shall be gathered, like the Spoiling of the Caterpillers; as the Running to and fro of Locusts, so shalt thou run upon them</HI>; for <HI>thy Sword shall be bathed in Heaven, it shall come upon</HI> Idumea, <HI>and upon the People of thy Curse, unto Judgment: Thy Sword shall be filled with Blood, and shall be made fat with Fatness:</HI> For, <HI>Thou hast a Sacrifice in</HI> Bozra, <HI>and a great Slaughter in the Land of</HI> Idumea: And <HI>the Unicorns shall come down with them, and the Bullocks, with the Bulls</HI>; and <HI>their Land shall be soaked with Blood, and their Dust made fat with Fatness</HI>: For <HI>the Day of Vengeance is in thine Heart, and the Year of thy Redeemed is come. Thou art looking, and there is none to help</HI>; and <HI>thou wonderest that there is none to uphold; therefore thine Arm shall bring Salvation unto thee, and thy Fury it shall uphold thee: Thou wilt put on Righteousness, as a Breast-plate, as an Helmet of Salvation upon thine Head</HI>: And <HI>Thou shalt put on the Garments of Vengeance for Clothing, and shalt be clothed with Zeal as a Cloke</HI>: And <HI>Thou wilt tread down the People in thine Anger, and make them drunk in thy Fury; and wilt bring down their Strength to the Earth.

We are thy covenanted People, thine in a more peculiar Manner, than any People, Nation, or Language throughout the Uni∣versal World: Thy Name is called most signally over us, thy Glory and Renown is most especially concerned in our Affairs: Greater Mercy, Power, Wisdom and Sove∣reignty hast Thou not manifested on any People, since Thou ascended on high: How majestick and glorious have thy Outgoings been among us? As if here had been the chief Place of thy Dwelling on Earth. Such majestick Banners of Mercy and Justice hast thou erected among us, as have amazed the Nations about: And tho', ere it be long, Thou wilt pour out our Blood like Wa∣ter, by the Force of the Sword, because of our horrid Apostasies and Inventions; Yet, <HI>Thy Loving-kindness shalt Thou never remove from us,</HI> but shalt erect a Banner of Love over us, until the Day of thine Appearance.

Hast Thou not ever frustrated the cruel and hellish Intents of thine Enemies, and made their De∣vices to fall on their own Heads; And shalt Thou not now plunge them in the midst of their own Mischiefs, as that the Inhabitants of the World shall cry out, <HI>Hig∣gaion, Selah</HI>?

Tho' Sighs and Tears did not move Thee, yet wilt Thou not regard the Cry of the <HI>Souls under the Altar,</HI> who testified for the very smallest of thy Interests unto the Death? Is not thy Kingdom now upon the advancing Hand, and the glorious Days at the Close of Time, which of old thou hast promised, at the Door? <HI>Anon,</HI> Thou wilt tread upon the <HI>high Places of the Earth, and the Inhabitants shall tremble,</HI> and be amazed: <HI>And the Loftiness of Man shall be bowed down, &amp; the Haughti∣ness of Men shall be made low, and thou alone shalt be exalted in that Day.</HI> Thou art coming <HI>forth in great Fury,</HI> and shalt <HI>tread the Wine-press without the City, up to the Horse-bridles:</HI> And the Carcases of the Men of this Generation shall be like Dung upon the Earth; <HI>for the Sword shall devour from the one End of the Land, even to the other</HI>: No Flesh shall have Peace, because <HI>the

<SALUTE>Dear Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I were able to dictate now, when I am entring into Eternity, I could tell you the Consolations, where∣with I am comforted of God, even when the chiefest Delights of the World, these Trifles, upon which the Sons of Men dote, can be no Comfort to me. Alas! what are all the Comforts, that flee away at Death? Even the Vanities of Time, which cannot convoy a Man with∣out the Borders of Time; and far less endure with him through Eternity. My Death would seem Judicial-like to blind Worldlings, who see no Judgment, but to be de∣prived of the empty and tasteless Vanities of Time; But I see, That <HI>all Things work together for Good to them, who are the Called according to his Purpose</HI>: Even Dif∣ficulties Temptations, Griefs and Woes have all an happy End to the Godly: <HI>Out of the Eater cometh Meat, and out of the Strong cometh Sweetness</HI>: So, even eating and con∣suming Griefs, Sickness and Losses, which make the out∣ward Man decay, renew the inward Man, and make him flourish; Even the strongest Difficulties, Temptations and Foes, when overcome, yield the sweetest Victory: And the Thoughts of having rushed through so many Ene∣mies, and so strong, shall be sweet throughout Eternity. I see clearly, all the Steps of divine Providence toward me, have conspired to a blessed Close; even the most difficult of them, especially this Half-Year: I would not,
<PB N="251" REF="005510_0126_101849E0B97C8998"/>
for never so much, but that I die were I die, and am sick in this Place; for his Dispensations have a wonderful Depth in them, &amp; cannot well be discerned, but by Eyes inlightned from above. But Worldlings are blind, and vary strangely in their Judgment of Things; and even the Saints, while here, are much blinded with Sin and Infir∣mities of this over-powering Mortality: Death has in∣deed a terrible Face to these, that place all their Happi∣ness in this Life; but I fear it not; it is not Death, but an Harbinger of Glory unto me: It is an hard-favoured Messenger, sent from my sweet <HI>Lord</HI> to me; 'Tis a dark and sad Chariot carrying to the Land of Light and Joy. My <HI>LORD</HI> hath done to me, what he hath determined from Eternity; and all his Purposes, even all the Tho'ts of his Heart, are full of Love, infinite Love, to those that wait upon him. I resolved to glorify him on Earth, and dedicated my Life wholly to my <HI>LORD's</HI> Service; and I know it is all one with him, as if I had done it: And I shall, in another Manner, exalt and serve him above, than I could have done here below, weighted with Mor∣tality, and innumerable Infirmities. My <HI>Lord</HI> hath said to me, It would weary thee, to stay too long in this Val∣ley of Tears and Misery; I take it, as if thou hadst done me many Years Service: I have abridged thy Days, but not thy Life: I have shortned thy Toiling, but not thy Reward. And O what a blessed Thing it is, that He takes the Task of many weary Years Service off my Hand! My Warfare is ended; O the joyful Change I am undergoing! When shall I see Him, as He is; When shall I get my Fill of lovely Jesus? O his Beauty, his Beauty, his Beauty! Men and Angels may admire the Freeness of his Grace, and admire it, and ever admire it! But what can they say, or comprehend of it? O the Freeness of his Grace! that he should admit the like of me to stand eternally before him, and to be for ever in his Presence; to be one of his honourable Train; Nay, to enjoy him, as near as can be! O! think ye, I lose any

Thing, who get the Forestart, and become Possessor of that Inheritance? The Inheritance of many a more excel∣lent and ancient Saint than I; nay, the Inheritance of the Heir of all Things? 'Tis little of Heaven I know, being obscured with Mortality, and living by Faith, and not by Sight. But O to think of the Expressions of Scripture concerning it; <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nor hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, what GOD hath prepared for those that love him:</HI> If Heaven could be conceived by us, I should not so much esteem it. But O, it is a massie Thing! O strange! that GOD should make Bits of mortal Men (and what a poor worth∣less Thing Man is, let any behold in a dying and dead Carcase) not only as happy as we can desire, or conceive, but as happy as can be! O, the beholding of the Face of the Ancient of Days! But I know in whom I have belie∣ved; and that he is able to present me spotless before the Father, with exceeding great Joy. If I perish, let him see to his Promise. I have laid all upon him: If I perish (through the Strength of my LORD, by whom I can do all Things) I shall perish believing. I expect much of Heaven, more than I can conceive; But, O! I think I shall be exceedingly deceived, (O sweet Deceit!) for I shall find more than Ten thousand Worlds can compre∣hend. I shall see my Father ere long; Many sweet Days have he and I had upon Earth: Many innumerable Ages shall we have in Heaven together. O Heaven! O, the Difference betwixt this melancholious, smoky Inn, and the Magnificent Hall of Glory! O the Change I am undergoing! I go from the Twilight of the Sun and Moon, to the Noon-day of the Splendour of Glory; from a Dunghil, to a Throne; from bodily Infirmities, Dis∣tresses, Diseases, and Pains, to a Land, whose Inhabitants do not say, I am sick; from wearisom Labour and Toil∣ing, into an inconceivable sweet Paradise, where I shall rest for evermore; from a mortal Company, to an innu∣merable immortal <HI>Company of Angels, to the General As∣sembly,
<PB N="253" REF="005510_0127_101849E4C1562DA8"/>
and Church of the First-born, which are written in Heaven; and to GOD the Judge of all; and to the Spirits of just Men made perfect; and to JESUS the Mediator of the New Covenant.</HI> O! what think ye, to be eternally, even for ever and ever among such sweet Company? Are there any more honourable and amiable Company, than they? O! what shall I say? What shall I think? that filthy and unworthy I should shew my Face among so glorious an Assembly. What is here, but Vanity and Grief of Heart? O do you not long to be gone, to be in that sweet and inconceivable Paradise? Cast your An∣chor within the Vail, and then you need not fear Death, come when it will. But O, long Life, or Death rather! For the sooner at our Journey's End, the better; and the longer we are clogged with Sin and Misery, the worse; but the more we will love to linger in this <HI>Sodom.</HI> 'Tis hard to get our Hearts drawn quite off Time: We look kindly to the Bastard's inheritance; and therefore we ab∣hor Death, and can frist Heaven longer than any Thing else: But if we could get a Sight of the King in his Beauty, and <HI>of the Land that is afar off</HI>; then, O to be gone! O to be up above these visible Heavens, and a∣mongst these glistering Companies, who enjoy him to the full! O! if Man knew how vain a World this is! O! but they are happy, and inconceivably happy, who escape fairly the Temptations, Snares and Difficulties that are in this Valley of Tears, and who are fairly landed on that odoriferous, flowery Land, an that ravishing Land, which infinite and eternal Love did contrive to be the royal Theatre, whereon should be shown, to Men and Angels, <HI>the Height and Breadth, Depth and Length, of that Love, which passeth Understanding!</HI> If you run fast, you cannot be long behind me; and we shall see one another immediately: Death is no Separation to the Saints; For Time is nothing: For what is it to be sepa∣rated for a few Hours, <HI>to them</HI> that are to dwell eternally together? What is transient Time to never ending Eter∣nity
<PB N="254" REF="005510_0128_101849E7D8F173C8"/>
of Joys! Death is far mistaken by the most Part of Saints, they have a wrong Conception of it; It is a sweet Repose to a weary Soul, and looseth the Soul from the Bands of Mortality, letting it out from a filthy, stinking Prison, unto the sweet and fragrant Air of Glory; It ends all Sorrows and Sighings, and begins unspeakable Joys: 'Tis but a dark Cloud ushering in the bright Dawn∣ing of eternal Glory. O but my Lord hath excellent∣ly circumstantiated my Death! O I admire his Love! I could tell many sweet Passages of Providences he hath cast in my Way: But I delay, until I be sitting upon the Brink of the River of Life; and then I shall number them: I cannot now praise him; Alas that I am so stu∣pid and dull; but I shall praise him anon, I shall eter∣nally praise him! <HI>O be glad and rejoice in our God!</HI> O sweet! that poor, dying, miserable I was not left to Uncertainties, not to know what to do; but to have such a sweet and kind Lord to repose on! Had I stayed long∣er in this wretched Life, I was resolved to have shown my self as faithful to you as I could: But I commit you unto his Grace, who hath cared for me, even unto Death: Commit your self to him, he will bring all to a good Issue that is trusted to him. We are not our own; therefore we are not to dispose of our selves. CHRIST is a good Tutor and Governour, and carries all these well through, that commit themselves to him. See that <HI>Mary</HI> neglect not Seeking of God, Praying, Reading of the Scriptures; Let her not frequent ill Company. O the Worth of a Soul! and the Reward of these, that are in∣strumental in gaining of a Soul! Our Bodies must go to the Dust; but our Souls are of more Worth than Ten thousand Worlds. I am not able to say more, I am so weak. O! run fast, Death is at the Door. We are all stepping into Eternity; What is Time, but a Preparation for it? Overlook Time, and live, as daily Dying, as one that must pass away immediately, and never be here any more. They build Castles in the Air, who imagine any

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> A Letter to his Brother <HI>James.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hope, the last Words of your Brother, who is now stepping into Eternity, will have some Weight with you; and this Consideration will make you not to neglect them. Know you why you came into the World? I am sure, and you are as sure, Not to eat, and drink, and pass away your Time in earthly Business; but to get the Work of your Salvation well wrought and fini∣shed, before Death assault you: It is most uncertain, and steals upon Men, as a <HI>Thief in the Night,</HI> when they are secure, never dreaming of such a great Change: Tho' truly my Gracious LORD lets me see Death still ap∣proaching nearer and nearer; that I may draw ever near∣er and nearer him, who is Life. O! it concerns you, to try, Whether you shall be a base Miscreant, crawling in the Bottomless Pit, with unspeakable Torments, in the Midst of wicked Men and Devils, blaspheming Jehovah and the Lamb to Eternity; or, a glorious Saint, confor∣med unto the Image of the SON of the eternal GOD, loving, praising, adoring him, that sitteth on the Throne, and the Lamb, for ever and ever. Consider what I say, The Business is so weighty, so exceeding weighty, that Time, with all its Well and Wo, is to be overlooked, in Comparison of this absolutely and only necessary Thing: I tell you, There is an absolute Necessity, that you be
<PB N="256" REF="005510_0129_101849EAAD6D3A08"/>
holy (let not the Poor Name affright you; for Holiness is the sweetest, and most easy Thing in the World, to them that are holy:) For, <HI>Without Holiness, no Man shall see the LORD</HI>: And Salvation must be nearer your Heart, by many Degrees, than all other Concernments, tho' they were Ten thousand Worlds. You must know the Bargain of the New Covenant, &amp; close heartily with it, in all its Fulness, without the least Reservation: Upon it, I recommend unto you Mr. <HI>Guthry</HI>'s <HI>Trial of a sa∣ving Interest in CHRIST</HI>; and desire you to read it, till you become such an one, as he describes. Believe it, <HI>Godliness is profitable for all Things; having the Promises of this Life, and that which is to come.</HI> Tho' it may seem troublesom in the Beginning; and tho' Christ's sweet and easy Yoke may seem an hard Wreath; yet believe me, there is Nothing in the World, but it, which can give Rest, and full Satisfaction to the Soul: All Things here are unsatisfying, tho' you had all that you can desire of them. O this is a vain World! These who are near Eternity will say so. O the vast Difference betwixt Time and Eternity! I assure you, if you had all that your Heart could wish or desire of the Pomp, Treasures and Pleasures of Time, you would find no Contentment in them: And when you shall be in such a Condition, as I am in, when pale Death shall be staring you in the Face; then all the Glory of Time will be, in your Eyes, nothing but a withered Flower. But alas! we are drunk with this World; and we never know well what we are doing, till Death make us sober. I must say again, and again, O the Difference betwixt Time, &amp; Eternity! They that get Heaven, can get no more; for, alas! What are all Additions of Time? What is a few Days Eating, and Drinking, &amp; Trifling? Yea, what are all the massie Exer∣cises of Time, compared with the Exercises of Glory? We place too much of our Happiness in this Side of Time; and therefore Death is a great Disappointer: But we should be indifferent to all Things in Time, and have our Eyes
<PB N="257" REF="005510_0129_101849EAAD6D3A08"/>
ever fixed upon the Thoughts of Eternity: Then 'tis not at all to be regarded, in what Time of a Man's Life he die, if he die in the Lord: Yea, 'tis an invaluable Bles∣sing for the Prisoner, or weary Pilgrim, to have all his Toilings by his Hand, and to win to his native Soil. You may think, I put a hard Task upon you; because our Nature is all polluted, and we are accustomed to do Evil. But the Ways of Holiness are sweet, and <HI>all its Paths are Peace</HI>: If you were once acquainted with the Ways of it, you would say, That Sin is the most base and vile Thing in the World; and Holiness is the most noble Ornament. And consider this, The more you set your Mind on Holiness, the more sweet and easy will you find it. As for temporary Things, take no Care for them; they are but Additions to the Son's Inheritance. I may say by Experience, He hath made good his Word to me in all these Things of Time; He hath made it good unto the End of my Race, in a most strange and wonderful Way: So that I have tasted more of my Lord's Good∣ness, and wonderful Providence, in this last Half-year of my Life, than in many Years before: I think it a mer∣ciful Dispensation, that he hath weaned my Heart from the World, more in this Half-Year's Sickness, than in many Years Health; This whole Half-year of my Life hath been a continual Winter, for bearing down my Corruption, both Original and Actual: And now the World hath no Relish to me. Farewel, vain World, I heartily submit unto Death, if it were for no more, but because it is the good Pleasure of my Lord, who most mercifully takes me away from the Bondage of my Corruption, and from the dreadful Evils to come. Medi∣tate seriously on Death: It is a Business most weighty, a Business upon which your eternal Well or Wo de∣pends: The End crowns the Work; die well, and you are well, even well for evermore. And O! is not E∣VERMORE a massie Word? You shall find Death easy, if you be a diligent Seeker of God in your Life∣time:
<PB N="258" REF="005510_0130_101849EC3A6975F0"/>
If otherwise, you shall find it the forest Battle, that ever you fought; and you shall quake, when you shall hear an avenging God speaking audibly in your Con∣science, <HI>He is not mine, take his evil Soul, Devils; pull him to Pieces, and hale him away to utter Darkness:</HI> The poor Soul wrestles in vain, but an avenging God leaves it for a Prey to Devils. Look not on Death, as afar off: Lit∣tle will be the Difference betwixt my Death and yours. This Generation will quickly be gone: Time is a gliste∣ring Star, appearing something before-hand, but indeed it is a transient Nothing. And one that dies at Sixty Years of Age, and another that dies at Twenty Years, think both alike, their bypast Time is a Dream. Short, or long Time is not to be regarded, but in Preparation for Eterni∣ty: And he that is prepared, hath lived long enough. I could give you many Instructions, were I not very weak: Beware of ill Company; never think to see God, if you walk with ill Company: Companions in Time, &amp; Com∣panions in Eternity. Lay some Vows upon your self; but remember this, That you vow to do nothing, in your own Strength; for you shall find, that when you are weakest in your own Eyes, then are you strongest: I say, Lay some Vows upon your self, as to pray thrice a Day seriously and conscientiously; to read so much Scripture; and to mediate. Not that Men are tied to particular Times, but it is most profitable to lay Bands upon our loose Corruptions, which else will plead for too much Liberty. Imagine not your Thoughts to be free; vain Thoughts are the Source of vain Words, and unprofitable Actions; the Mind is the Spring of all. Be∣ware of the Sins of the Time, as you would shun the terrible Judgments that threaten an apostate Generation: The Pastors are become brutish, they are <HI>Sons of</HI> Belial, <HI>and know not the Lord</HI>; therefore they, who hear them, are Partakers of their Abominations. I need say no more. You never have rightly sought God, until it be your chief Delight to seek him; therefore, never rest till you
<PB N="259" REF="005510_0130_101849EC3A6975F0"/>
can say, <HI>I will go to God, my chiefest Joy.</HI> O then you are as happy as God can make you (to speak so, with Reverence to that <HI>High and Lofty One, who inhabits Eternity</HI>) and can you be more happy? I take to wit∣ness against you, your own Conscience, and the great Judge of the Quick and the Dead, that, if you continue in any vain Imagination, <HI>living without God in the World,</HI> neglecting <HI>so great a Salvation,</HI> you are <HI>a Trampler under Foot of the Blood of the Covenant,</HI> and a Despiser of all Ad∣monitions: But all this will do little, until He, who made Heaven and Earth, regenerate you. It may be he will hedge up your Way on every Side by Affliction, that you may be constrained to flee unto him, who is a <HI>present Help in Time of Trouble.</HI> This, if you follow it, is the best Legacy I could have left you; for, if you knew the Dan∣ger of the Pelf of this World, little of it would suffice. I would not for a World, I had been born to be rich: The lighter burdened with thick Clay, the better; 'tis hard to get up the Mount, tho' ye had but a very small Weight upon your Back: For our Corruptions are weighty e∣nough, without any Addition. If you neglect that, which not I, but Christ commands you, Farewel for ever. If you obey, Farewel for a few Days; and then you and I shall meet, in the only Paradise, the Flower of the whole Creation: We shall sit down upon the flowery Banks of the River of Life, and ravish our selves for ever and ever, with everlasting and unspeakable Joys.

<P>I Am sorry, I did not write sooner, before my Strength and speech did fail; but I would be glad to spend my

last Breath upon you, if I could do you any Good. I cannot forget you, even when I have forgotten the Vani∣ties of the World; you are precious unto me, since I knew you in some Measure a Seeker of God. O what Advantages there are in seeking of Him! I defy Men and Angels to number and comprehend them: Endless Eternity shall be short enough to lay open the inconcei∣vable Gains of Godliness. If you seek him diligently, sincerely and constantly, you shall have all Things: And O is not that a vast Word, ALL THINGS? All shall be yours, <HI>whether the World, Life or Death, Things present, or Things to come</HI>; all these shall be yours, even the Great ALL, and whatsoever is his. O but the Saints have a long, large and full Charter! If you had a Char∣ter for many Lands, it were but a narrow Thing: But now every Place where you tread on is yours; and what can you desire more? Beheld the Heaven, and consider even the Heaven of Heavens; for these are yours: Is it possible, that a Saint, the Heir of all Things, and Joint-Heir with the Son of the Eternal; Is it possible, I say, that he can want any Thing? Nay, the great Eternal, the Maker of all Things, He is yours; and what can you desire more? Is it possible, that a Saint can want any Thing, whether spiritual or temporal? I mean any Thing that is good for him: And he alone knows what is best for us. When I look through the Passages of my Life, I see my Lord and Guide hath led me the best Way; and these have been the sweetest Dispensations, which crossed most my natural Disposition, and which seemed most Judgment-like to carnal Eyes. We are like ignorant Children, that have no Judgment to make Choice of Things; but would swallow down sweet Poison, and give away a rich Inheritance for painted Trifles. No Wonder then, the World be Fools and Mad-men in their Choice. My Life hath been but a Tract of Afflictions, and I would not for a Thousand Worlds it had been other∣wise. Tho' my <HI>Old-Man</HI> desired still to be swiming in the
<PB N="261" REF="005510_0131_101849F0590D0278"/>
Ease and Vanities of the World; yet I see my Lord hath been kindest, when I esteemed him most cruel. The last Part of my Life might seem Judgment-like: But O you would wonder, if you knew what I know, and what my Lord hath done for me, in this last Half-year of my Life, both as to Things temporal and spiritual: I cannot understand them now, but I shall very shortly; and they shall be to me Matter of eternal Praise. Tho' I had abounded with all the Ease, Delights, Pomp &amp; Glo∣ry, and Riches of Time; yet would I be glad to die, and leave the Puddle of swinish Pleasures, and drink of the pure River of everlasting Joys, that floweth from be∣neath the Throne of GOD. This World quite mistakes Death: O! who would not willingly leave such a vain perishing World? wherein we are still dishonouring our God; a World wherein the Saints get bad Entertainment; a World wherein the LORD of Glory was, and is daily, crucified: What is here? All the Glory and Excellency of the Creation is up above: A few imperfect Saints are only here. But it is above, I shall see and embrace all these Worthies, the Courtiers of the King of Glory. You need not be sad for my Death; and will not, if you post hard after me, and follow on to know the LORD: For Time is just Nothing. We shall be glad and rejoice, with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory, throughout all Eterni∣ty, in that Land of Glory, and inconceivable Joys. O, if you knew but a little of the Excellency of that Land of Blessedness! You would, in a Manner, envy those who go before you. Tho' you should pass never so many sweet Days ere you can get thither, you would weary: For your self, you are yet in an Hell, of Sorrow and Sin, while out of Heaven, and while they are in an Heaven of Joy, and Pleasure. O! Beware of Worldly-mindedness, &amp; car∣ping Cares; Commit all to your Father: <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteousness thereof; and then all other Things shall be added unto you.</HI> Fear not, <HI>It is your Father's good Pleasure to give you a Kingdom</HI>:
<PB N="262" REF="005510_0132_101849F1E04A1918"/>
And he that gives Heaven, will give as much Earth as will suffice you, and more than is sufficient, is a heavy Weight, that will pull you down the Mount. O mark this! <HI>He that gave his only begotten Son,</HI> out of his Bo∣som, to be tormented unto Death for you; <HI>Will he not also with him freely give you all Things,</HI> even every Thing that pertains to Life and Godliness? As for Things temporal, the less of the World, the better: All the Saints will testify it, at least when they are leaving it. I can put my Seal to it now, when I am entring into Eternity, that it is most dangerous to be intangled ei∣ther with Riches, Honours, or Pleasures; And that it is the sweetest Dispensation, to be afflicted, and cut short of them; for Prosperity is the Neck-break of the Life of Godliness, as the Experience of many a deceived Profes∣sor may testify; who seemed Something, when afflicted; but when once they got the Bag, betrayed Christ. 'Tis hard for a <HI>Camel to go through a Needle's Eye</HI>: The more we are inveigled with this deceitful World, the less do we value Heaven. Now Nothing more glews a Man's Heart to the Earth, than Riches, which have weighed many a Man down to the Pit; where he is weeping and gnashing his Teeth, cursing Riches, and tor∣menting himself, that ever he desired them: Whereas, if he had been poor, he should have been now (as Men may conjecture) rejoicing amongst these glorified Ones. Remember, that it is utterly impossible to serve God and <HI>Mammon</HI>; And if your Treasure be not in Heaven, nei∣ther will your Heart be there. I bless my LORD for mine Afflictions (which have been still greater and great∣er, till now, I am leaving them all) as much as for any Mercy, I ever received: For now I reap the peaceable Fruits of Righteousness, And tho' now I be weeping, while I sow; yet shortly shall I have as much as I can bear of the masie Sheaves of unconceivable Glory. <HI>Weep and howl, ye rich Men, for your Misery that shall come upon you:</HI> For <HI>you now receive your good Things,</HI>
<PB N="263" REF="005510_0132_101849F1E04A1918"/>
and the Saints <HI>their evil Things</HI>; therefore immediately shall <HI>ye be afflicted and tormentod, and they shall be com∣forted. Blessed are they that mourn now, for they shall be comforted.</HI> For the Saints weep, while the World re∣joiceth; but our Sorrow shall be turned into Joy, and their mad Mirth into unspeakable and eternal Horrour. O! if Men did consider this, they would not toil for their Ease and Pleasures of Sin, which are but for a Mo∣ment; nor would they envy the rich Gluttons, but ra∣ther the poor <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s, that are despicable in the Eyes of all. <HI>Fret not when you see the Wicked prosper</HI>; nor va∣lue Poverty, Shame and Contempt; since the only excel∣lent Ones, <HI>of whom the World was not worthy, wandered about in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins; being destitute, af∣flicted, and tormented:</HI> And the honourable Apostles, and Followers of the Lamb, were accounted <HI>the Offscourings of all Things.</HI> O if the Saints would take Time, sit down and consider these Things! they would find it sweet, to be conformed, in Sufferings, to their Lord, <HI>who was a Man of Sorrows, &amp; acquainted with Grief</HI>; That they might also be conformed to him in Glory. I fear Earthly mindedness may be your Predominant; therefore strive most against it: For, how can one set their Heart upon Trash, and earnestly desire it, and Heaven also? I per∣swade you, the only Way to have as much of the World as is necessary and good for you, is to commit your tem∣poral Lot wholly to Christ, without the least Reservation: This is best; for Nothing can be committed to him, and go wrong: Try him, and if ye do not find that he will carry you bravely through, so that you shall lack Nothing that is good for you, then call him a Liar: Yet, never any of the Saints could say, he failed them in a Jot of what he promised them. And how great are his Promises! as you will find in Scripture: They are all comprehended in this, <HI>The Lord is a Sun and Shield; he will give Grace and Glory; and no good Thing will he withhold from them that love him, and walk uprightly.</HI>
<PB N="264" REF="005510_0133_101849F5D4AC6F48"/>
Trust all to him; for, whether should you tutor your self, or he? Which of you is wisest? Cast all upon him, to the least Bit of Bread! and ye shall find a great Ease. They are miserable, who must care for themselves, and what concerns them, and have not a GOD to run to, on whom they may lay themselves, and all their Burdens. O! learn to trust in God for all Things, temporal and eternal: It is an hid Mystery to many Saints, in many Things, especially, to trust against Sense, to hope against Hope; when there is no humane Probability, then to re∣ly upon the bare Word of him who is true, is a Diffi∣culty; where his Providence seems to contradict his Pro∣mises, or to make his Promise a Liar: But will you trust him for Heaven, and not for a Moment of Time? Think you, he will withhold Journey-bread, if you be a Travel∣ler to the higher <HI>Canaan?</HI> It were a great Absurdity, to command any to go a Journey, and not to give what is necessary for it. Go on to Heaven, hold your Face still thitherward, and Christ will still be supplying all your Wants: Indeed he will not satisfie your carnal Disposi∣tion, nor give you more than a Pilgrim needs; so that you should forget the Race set before you, by being in∣tangled with a Number of Superfluities. I would say more, If Breath and Strength would permit: You know not what a World you are into; 'Tis full of Snares and Difficulties. You will find it hard to keep clean Gar∣ments; unless you commit your self unto him, who can carry you as <HI>with Eagles Wings,</HI> and strengthen and support you, when you are ready to fall. Tho' you should be the precisest of all round about you; you will find all little enough, when you come to Death: O! Death is a weighty Business. You have scarce Time to prepare for it: All our Time is little enough for Preparation, tho' we should cut our selves short of our indifferent earthly Exercises: What Need had we then, to beware to pass our Time vainly? 'Tis precious every Moment of it having a Relation to Eternity. O Eter∣nity!
<PB N="265" REF="005510_0133_101849F5D4AC6F48"/>
Eternity! Get some Sight of it, and your Thoughts shall be wonderfully changed: For, I tell you, could you get a Glimpse of that massie Thing, called, ETER∣NITY, all the Things in Time should be no more in your Eyes, than a childish Toy in the Eyes of a Man. Even the World decked in its best Robes, seems such a poor Thing to me, that I would not be at the Pains to stretch out my Hand, if I had it for the taking up; &amp; such will it seem ere long to many. Worldlings are but Beasts; and the richest and most flourishing of them, could you see them with my Eyes, are but mean Dunghil Worms; their Meditations cannot flee over Time. Then look up∣on the World as mad, they know not what they are doing; they value only Time, and yet they know not how to get it past away. Be a great Reader of the Scriptures; for there shall you find Instruction, to make you wise to Sal∣vation; and thereby you may guide your Steps warily, in an evil Time: There shall you find Threatnings, to rouse you up; and Promises, to comfort and sustain you in the saddest of Conditions. Reverence the Ordinances, administred by faithful Pastors; for they are the Ambas∣sadors of the Lord, our King: But, abhor false Pro∣phets, which lead Men into Destruction. Alas that there should be any of Christ's Servants, who give an ill Ex∣ample to these that are Simple, counselling them, by their Practice, to follow Thieves &amp; Robbers, whose Voice Christ's Sheep will not hear. Set, at least, three Times a Day apart, for Prayer; for when we neglect that, our Hearts are cold all the Day long; and then we are easily snared with any Temptation we meet with. Sometimes meditate, and consider your Self, and others; that so you may not go on in your Journey like the World, who never ponder their Way, but are led to Destruction by their earthly Desires, rushing into it, as Horses to the Bat∣tle. What have you to do here, but to mind Salvation? Consider this; for Death will strip you naked of all Things here; but chuse the <HI>one Thing necessary, that shall never
<PB N="266" REF="005510_0134_101849F8DA8A72E8"/>
be taken away.</HI> Remember then, that all Things here are subordinate to Salvation: Our Time is short and un∣certain, we flee away. Death will be upon you ere you be aware; it surpriseth alike all Sorts of Ages, Young and Old: Chuse you, whether you will have Death sweet or bitter. For my Part, I fear not Death; my LORD hath said to me, <HI>Son, be of good Cheer, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</HI> O who would not go hence, if it were but to stand at one of the Gates of the golden City, and see the Lord, with all the Ransomed Ones, the no∣ble Company of Priests and Kings, standing round about the LAMB, crowned with Honour and Glory! One Hour of Heaven, yea, one Sight of the Face of the Ancient of Days, would do more than make up all the bitter Affli∣ctions I have swimmed through in Time: Nay, I think the very Fore-thoughts of Glory do already swallow up all the Impressions of the Tribulations of Time, that have seized on me: They are nothing now; they are gone, and shall never return again; Yea, they are, as if they had not been. This shall be Matter of high Praises, through endless Eternity, for evermore. O vast Eterni∣ty! But O silly Time! No Wonder <HI>Paul</HI> said, <HI>We look not at the Things that are seen, but the Things that are not seen; for the Things that are seen, are temporal; but the Things that are not seen, are eternal:</HI> The Things that are seen, were not from Eternity, neither shall they be to Eternity. O then! overlook them: Close your Eyes, as it were, upon them; and you shall see strange Sights, which shall make your Course to Glory swift and cheerful? O! what think you of Christ? Is there any like him? is there any but He? If you have him, you have all Things: His Words cannot be told. What think you of it, to be saved from everlasting Burnings? What think you of it, that sinful wretched we should be as happy as can be? Even eternally, and unconceivably happy! and all this purchased by the Death and Blood of our kin∣dest LORD JESUS? O who would not love such an

One? Surely, it is impossible to know him any Way a right, and not to love him: He is the Ravishment of Men and Angels. Increated Glory shines through the Vail of his humane Nature: We cannot enjoy God more sweetly, familiarly and fully, than through him: He is the blessed Days-Man betwixt God and Man; the Man Christ Jesus. Him I wish I could declare evermore: But my last Words, tho' they were fewer, may have a strong Impression upon you. Run fast, lose not the Crown; Heaven is well worth an Inch of Time's Run∣ning. Cross corrupt Nature's Disposition; as you sow, so shall you reap: And consider, That Death will teach you, that all that you do is fruitless, which tends not to the great Salvation: All other Mercies are not worth, in Comparison of this great Salvation; and a short Time will spend them all: But it shall endure for evermore. O but the News of Heaven, such a sweet Heaven to weary Pil∣grims, such a ravishing Paradise to these that are in this smoky Dunghil; I say, They are the greatest News that can be! And this whispered in your Ears, <HI>Run for you shall have the Crown,</HI> is another Kind of News, than, <HI>Run, and you shall have Riches, Honour, and Pleasures.</HI> Bless him at all Times, who hath disposed your Lot so, as these only great Things have taken you by the Heart, Be not weary in Well-doing; for <HI>in due Time you shall reap, if you faint not</HI>: And we shall see one another short∣ly, in the Midst of such Joys, as the Tongues of Men and Angels cannot in the least express: Therefore, you have no Cause of Sadness, but of Rejoicing, that you have another Friend gone before you, who will welcome you shortly into your Lord's Joy. Grace be with you. Ac∣count it all one, as if I had spoken all this to you Face to Face. These are the Words of</P>

<HEAD><HI>IV.</HI> A Letter to his Cousin <HI>Thomas Welwood.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Cousin,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough I be almost amidst Death's Pangs, I cannot forget you; because of the sweet Friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip we have had together; and because you are (I'm perswaded) one of the Heirs of Glory, and among those who wrestle through manifold Temptations, unto the Land of eternal Consolations! O if I could tell you what my Lord hath done for me unto this very Hour; and much more since I came hither, than in many fore∣going Years! I think, if I had Time, I could fill a whole Volume with wonderful Experiences of his Loving-kind∣ness, strange Providences, and sweet Chastisements: So that an Half-Year may be better than an hundred. 'Tis not the Length of Time, we are to look to: We have a race to run to Heaven; and when we have fini∣shed it, we have done. Oh! <HI>Cousin,</HI> even a Saint may live long, and make very small Progress to Glory: Yea, many go backward; and it were better for them, they di∣ed ere that be, before they dishonoured God by their backsliding Carriages: Therefore run fast, <HI>Eye the Joy that is set before you,</HI> and patiently endure all the Temp∣tations and Troubles in Time; for your Lord hath promi∣sed, that <HI>He will never leave you nor forsake you: And none shall be able to pluck you out of his Hand.</HI> Indeed you may have sore Trials, both outward and inward; but <HI>be of good Courage, and he shall strengthen your Heart</HI>: For you are not to bear your own Burden, but to cast it fully over upon Him. And I promise you, in my Lord's Name, you shall be sustained: He is our Strength, our Wisdom, our Righteousness, and our All; even all that we want, all that we can desire. Never notice

long or short Life: but live to die, and then you die to live eternally. O! think much upon Eternity, and you shall think Nothing of Time. Alas! alas! the Things of Time fill our Eyes so, as we never regard Eternity: Yet, Time will be at a Close ere ever we be a∣ware. I have somewhat the Advantage of you in getting the Fore-start: But we shall be together perpetually, even immediately; &amp; we shall have another Manner of Con∣verse, than possibly we could have had on Earth. In Heaven they are not confined to Moments, Days &amp; Years; we shall have Eternity to rejoice and be glad in: O what a Life shall we have, when you and I shall <HI>follow the Lamb whither soever he goes</HI>! When we shall have Sin, Temptations and Miseries done away! We know not the Excellency of our invaluable Inheritance; and therefore are we so much taken up with earthly Trifles, and Shadows, that are Nothing; which bewitch all the Worldlings out of their Wits, &amp; the Saints too, in a great Measure: It were more Wisdom in us, <HI>to use the World, as not abusing it,</HI> as not setting our Hearts upon it. Be∣ware of the Cares of the World, and the Deceitfulness of Riches, wherewith you may be intangled, in the Condi∣tion you are in; if you take not Heed, your Course to Glory will be the more slow, and you will drive your Chariot-Wheels heavily up to the higher City; yea, the thick Clay will make them come back upon you. O consider how great a Business Salvation is! We can never consider it enough. You will think so, when you come to Death, which you ought to look upon as at the Door.</P>
<P>I speak not these Things, as if you knew them not al∣ready; but I put you in Remembrance, desiring to com∣municate a little of my Mind to you, now, when I am at the Brink of Time; because Providence hath so ordered that we cannot speak Face to Face these Things, which are the true and genuine Thoughts of my Heart. Beware of the Pollutions of the Times. It is comfortable to me
<PB N="270" REF="005510_0136_101849FEC411EE60"/>
that I had Little or Nothing to do, as to outward Things, with this horrid, cursed Defection. <HI>Hate the Garments spotted with the Flesh</HI>: Clean Garments are of great Worth; and these few, in this woful Time, that have kept their Garments clean, <HI>shall walk with our Lord in White; for they are worthy.</HI> To keep clean Garments, that is, to be pious alone; pious in your Fa∣mily, in your Worship; pious in your worldly Employ∣ments; full of Charity, despising the World; walking wisely towards these that are without, and towards these that are within. And as to the Times, let your Zeal be wise, and your Wisdom zealous. You may believe a dying Man, I am fully perswaded that this Prelacy is abo∣minable Antichristianism; and that the Prelates and Cu∣rates are the Ministers, not of CHRIST, but of Antichrist and Satan; and that it is utterly unlawful to hear them, or do any Thing, that may shew you esteem them Mi∣nisters, or any Way strengthen their Hands. O the dread∣ful Wrath, that is hanging over these Lands like a Cloud, which will fall down in a Deluge of Divine Vengeance. God will make this Land to swim in Blood; even the Blood of all Sorts, Great and Small, Rich and Poor, Old and Young, shall be poured out like Dust: He shall be a strange Man, that shall happily escape such a Con∣sumption. I will not speak much of the Matter, but I see fearful Things coming. But, O the glorious Days succeeding these! I cannot apprehend the Glory that shall shine in <HI>Britain,</HI> which shall enlighten to the Ends of the Earth. I fear not Death, 'tis Sin only we ought to fear; <HI>The Sting of Death is Sin</HI>; That being taken away, it is most harmless. It is sweet to die in Christ! O what an Exchange do I make! I shall see him, and that glorious Company of Saints and Angels, <HI>following Him whithersoever He goes</HI>: The first Hour of Glory shall, in a Manner, make me forget that ever I was upon Earth. My Afflictions have been greater than the Spectators could imagine; and still greater and greater, until I ar∣rive
<PB N="271" REF="005510_0136_101849FEC411EE60"/>
at the Haven of eternal Rest. O 'tis sweet! O 'tis sweet! after a great-Toil and Labour. My Lord is ta∣king me in the fittest Time; for both Body and Soul are very weary and sore tossed: But this Body shall get a sound Sleep, and a ravishing Wakning. O the great Dif∣ference betwixt what it is now, and what it shall be short∣ly! Who can conceive what Christ hath done for the Saints? O the Depth of free, altogether free Love and Grace! It shall take up Eternity to cry up the in∣conceivable Love of JEHOVAH and the LAMB. O to think that Bits of Clay, sinful Clay, like you and me should be conformed unto the Image of our only Lord Jesus! That is a wonderful Exaltation! wonderful in the Eyes of all these, that see their own Emptiness and Vile∣ness. O admire! O praise! O adore! Let these Things be still imprinted on your Heart; all other Things are but Trifles. Look upon the World, as a Number of mad Bodies: They are Beasts, whose Conceptions are con∣fined within an Inch of Time: They are poor Spirits, who gape after Time's Riches, Honour and Pleasures. If the World knew what they were doing, they would wonder at themselves; at least, they would begin to que∣stion, whether their Life on Earth was real, or only emp∣ty, and a Night-dream. O such a Sight as I have gotten of the World! O 'tis but vain, Vanity of Vanities: The Flower and Choice of it is curs'd, and al∣together Vanity. O if I could tell you of the Nothing∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the World, and of Things temporal; and of the Massiness of Things eternal! Compare them together, and you will wonder at the Difference! The most Part of Professors (among whom I put my self) take an easy Way to Heaven: And O where will you find the Man, or Woman, that studies a close Walk with God! 'Tis recorded of <HI>Enoch,</HI> that <HI>He walked with God Three hundred Years</HI>: But who can say, He hath walked with God one Day? We lose God in the Midst of our worldly Employments, and cannot say, <HI>We have set the
<PB N="272" REF="005510_0137_10184A005E6B6250"/>
Lord always before us</HI>; Therefore, we cannot say, <HI>We shall not be moved.</HI> We approach to Him, in the Mor∣ning, Evening, and at other Times; but we neglect our Thoughts: Whereas to live full of holy divine Tho'ts, is to live a Saint: As the Man is, so are his Thoughts. Alas! I may say it, by sad Experience, Unwatched-over Tho'ts have made me, many a Time, not to dif∣fer much from a Worldling. Keep your Thoughts right, and all shall be right: <HI>Keep thine Heart with all Dili∣gence</HI> (saith the Spirit of God) <HI>for out of it are the Issues of Life.</HI> If your Thoughts be right, your Prayers will be seasonable, your Words and Actions will be seaso∣nable, for, <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth speaketh,</HI> and the Hand acteth. Commit all your Affairs, temporal, spiritual and eternal, wholly to your heavenly Father, without the least Reservation: <HI>He cares for you</HI>; Therefore, <HI>be careful in nothing, but in every Thing give Thanks. Run, run with Patience, the Race that is set be∣fore you; Laying aside every Weight,</HI> that may bear you down: Intangle not your self with the World; have as little ado with it, as you can: <HI>The Righteous shall scarcely be saved</HI>; they, who go uprightest, shall find hard enough Work: We are so full of Corruptions ori∣ginal and actual, that Holiness is quite contrary to our corrupt Natures: I mean not the common Holiness, which even those, that are strict, are thought to have; but that which our Lord commands; <HI>He that loveth Father or Mother, Sister or Brother, or the World, or himself bet∣ter than me, is not worthy of me.</HI> O it is an unknown Thing, to <HI>deny all, to take up their Cross daily, and follow CHRIST.</HI> I had a great Desire to preach CHRIST; But He will accept the Will for the Deed: I go to bet∣ter Exercise, whereof one Hour is better than all the Prea∣chings betwixt this, and Christ's second Coming, com∣pendized in one. All here are but Shadows; all above is Substance. O what elevated Divines are above! They are all filled with all the Fulness of God; &amp; do preach
<PB N="273" REF="005510_0137_10184A005E6B6250"/>
and cry up the transcendent Excellencies of JEHOVAH and the LAMB: There is a perpetual Crying-up of Christ. In <HI>Canticles,</HI> He can never enough speak of his Spouse: Up above, his Spouse can never enough speak of Him. There all are ravished with the Ancient of Days! Who, but the Ancient of Days? Who but CHRIST? Who, but the Saints? Then, let never Earth &amp; Heaven be compared together; for I tell you, Earth, is but a tormenting Hell, in Comparison of that unspeakably de∣lightful, and altogether ravishing Land, unto which un∣worthy (but happy) I am going, O methinks, I am touching the Skirts of the fragrant Breathings of the Mountains of Spices! And O how I must be ravished, when I shall draw in no other Air, but the Breathings of the higher Paradise? They have the Advantage, that get the Fore-start to Heaven, and seeing the Face of JEHO∣VAH first; and being more antient Possessors of that ex∣cellent Inheritance. Why should any be afraid to go to Heaven too soon? Why should any be afraid he be too soon happy? Let Worldlings desire to crawl long on their Dunghils: But let us ever be longing <HI>to be dis∣solved, and to be with our LORD, which is best of all.</HI> I commit you, your Mother-in-law, your Wife and Children, to the Protection of the Almighty; and pray for temporal and eternal Blessings to be poured out up∣on you.

<P>THough I be stepping into Eternity, and was thought to have been just entring into it about Half an Hour ago, I could not but remember you and
<PB N="274" REF="005510_0138_10184A0458479F38"/>
dictate a little of my Mind unto you: Not that I intend∣ed to write any Instructions unto you, but only shew, That God is good to them that seek him; and that in his Providence, his Promises are all accomplished to the Full, to me. I cannot tell what he hath done for my Soul; but I think, He hath brought me to the End of my Days, to the End of my Race, by such a wonderful Chain of divine Providence, that I would not, for Ten thousand Worlds, He had brought me any other Way; or, that my Race had been either longer, or shorter. He liveth long enough, who liveth till he get Heaven: All other Things are but Pendicles. He liveth short While, who is unprepared for it; of whatsoever Age he be: Therefore my Death needs not offend any Man; for, what can I get more, than the <HI>Kingdom immoveable, undefiled, and that fadeth not away</HI>? I desired to live, for no other End, but to preach my <HI>Lord to the great Congregation</HI>; And think you not, He will accept the <HI>Will</HI> for the <HI>Deed</HI>? I de∣dicated my Life for his Service; and I hope, He will graciously take it off my Hand, as if I had done him many Years Service. And I must tell you, He hath many wonderful Ways of Bringing his Children unto Glory: I could tell you it by sweet Experience, if my Weakness and Breath would permit. I would not, for all the Glo∣ry, Riches and Pleasures of a vain World, my Lot had been another than my Lord hath appointed it; yea, my last Half-Year's Providence hath been a golden Chain, which neither I, Men, nor Angels can sufficiently value. Would you know, what I think now of Heaven? Tho' I were out of this State of Mortality, I could never think of it enough! O! O! O! the Joy of being with JEHO∣VAH and the LAMB! O the <HI>Excellency of the Know∣ledge of Christ Jesus,</HI> even on this Side of Time! But to see Him as he is, O who can tell what a Sight it is? Even these who see <HI>Him Face to Face,</HI> see, as it were, but the Skirts of his Beauty and Excellency: And let them dive still deeper and deeper, till Eternity, as it were, be at

an End, they shall still be but beginning, and yet never well begun. To shew my great Love and Respect I have e∣ver had to you, both formerly and now, I write unto you, even when the Dead-Rittle is in my Throat: And tho' I be in a great Agnoy, I find the only Way to Heaven, that <HI>New and Living Way,</HI> is only by the Blood of the Son of GOD: There is no other Way, but, <HI>Believe</HI> in Christ and be <HI>Saved.</HI> But it is a lively, purifying, loving and believing Way. I cannot say much, I am in Death's Pangs. But, <HI>O Death! where is thy Sting? O Grave! where is thy Victory?</HI> I am like to have a sharp Combat; but, I hope, Christ will not be an indifferent Spectator. The End crowns the Work. And if once I were within <HI>Emmanuel</HI>'s surpassing sweet Land of Conquest, then should I trample Death and Hell under Foot; and tri∣umph over all the Miseries and Afflictions of Time, which seemed to triumph over me. O Death what art thou, in mine Eyes! My LORD hath swallowed thee up in Victory: And can a free-born Son, and Con∣queror, through the Blood of the everlasting Covenant, be afraid of a conquered Slave? <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.13. Hell, Sin, Devil and Death are conquered Slaves. I rest,</P>
