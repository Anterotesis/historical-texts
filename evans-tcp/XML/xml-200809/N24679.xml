<P>TRAVELS OF A PHILOSOPHER; OR, OBSERVATIONS ON THE MANNERS AND ARTS OF VARIOUS NATIONS IN <HI>AFRICA</HI> AND <HI>ASIA.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> following interesting work was originally read before the Royal Society of Agriculture at <HI>Lyons,</HI> of which the author was then President; and soon after that before the Royal Society of <HI>Pa∣ris.</HI>—It was so well received by those learned bod∣ies, that it soon found its way to the press, and has since been translated and re-printed in <HI>London. M. LE POIVRE</HI>'s manner is easy and elegant—his observations striking and judicious—his sentiments philanthropic and benevolent.—His principal aim appears to be to prove that the genuine happiness of every nation depends upon the improvements of <HI>Agriculture;</HI> and that for this end the property of the industrious ought to be permanently secured by laws and modes of government that should be subject to no violation.</P>
<P>For the benefit of the <HI>American</HI> Farmers and Legislators it is now re-printed, in hopes that it may be an incitement to a proper mode of thinking on the subject of Agriculture, as well as to greater exertions and industry among the different ranks of people amongst us.</P>

<HEAD>TRAVELS OF A PHILOSOPHER.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>EVERY people, however barbarous, have arts peculiar to themselves. The diversi∣ty of climates, whilst it varies the wants of man∣kind, offers to their industry different produc∣tions on which to exercise it. Every country, at a certain degree of distance, has fabrics so singu∣larly peculiar to itself, that they could not have been the fabrics of other regions: but agricul∣ture, in every climate, is the universal art of mankind: from one extreme of the globe to the other, nations still barbarous, as well as those whose ideas are civilized, procure to themselves, at least, a part of their subsistence by the culture of their fields; yet this art, however universal, is not every where equally flourishing.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032696_0004_0FF429CC3647D020"/>It never fails to prosper among wise nations, who know how to honor and encourage it;—it supports itself but feebly amongst a people half polished, who either prefer to it frivolous arts, or who, being sufficiently enlightened perhaps to per∣ceive its utility, are still too much slaves to the prejudices of their ancient barbarity, to affran∣chize and confer honors on those who exercise it;—it languishes, and its influence is scarcely to be observed amongst barbarians, who despise it. The state of agriculture has ever been the princi∣pal object of my researches among the various people I have seen in the course of my voyages. It is almost impossible for a traveller, who perhaps only passes through a country, to make such re∣marks as are necessary to convey a just idea of the government, police, and manners of the inhabit∣ants. In such a case, the criterion which best mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the internal state of a nation, is to observe the public markets, and the face of the country. If the markets abound in provisions, if the fields are well cultivated, and covered with rich crops, then in general you may conclude that the coun∣try is well peopled, that the inhabitants are civil∣ized and happy, that their manners are polished, and their government agreeable to the principles of reason.—You may then say to yourself, I am amongst <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>When, on the contrary, I have arrived amongst a people, whom it was necessary to search for amidst forests, whose neglected lands were over∣grown with brambles; when I have traversed
<PB N="7" REF="032696_0004_0FF429CC3647D020"/>
large tracts of uncultivated desarts, and then at last stumbled on a grubb'd-up wretchedly culti∣vated field; when arrived at length at some can∣ton, I have observed nothing in the public mar∣ket but a few sorry roots, I no longer hesitated to determine the inhabitants to be wretched sava∣ges, or groaning under the most oppressive sla∣very.</P>
<P>I never remember a single instance of being obliged to retract this first idea, conceived simply by inspecting the state of agriculture amongst the various nations I have seen: the knowledge of various particulars, which a long residence amongst many of them has enabled me to acquire, has ever confirmed me in opinion, that a country poorly cultivated is always inhabited by men bar∣barous or oppressed, and that population there can never be considerable.</P>
<P>You will observe by the detail I now offer you of my enquiries, that in every country agriculture depends absolutely on the laws, the manners, and even on the established prejudices of the respective inhabitants. I shall begin with observations on some parts of Africa.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>The Western Coasts of Africa.</HEAD>
<P>The islands and western districts of this part of the world which I have seen, are for the greater part uncultivated lands, inhabited by unhappy ne∣groes. These wretched men, who have so poor
<PB N="8" REF="032696_0005_0FF4310BE4FD1DC0"/>
an estimation of themselves as to sell one anoth∣er, never employ a thought on the cultivation of their lands. Satisfied to exist from day to day, under a climate where their wants are few, they cultivate just as much as prevents their dying of hunger; they carelessly sow every year some maize, a very little rice, and plant, in small quan∣tities, different kinds of potatoes, not of the na∣ture of ours, though the culture is much the same; we know them by the name of <HI>yams.</HI> In gener∣al their harvests are so poor, that the Europeans, who resort to them for the purchase of slaves, are obliged to bring from Europe or America the pro∣visions necessary for the maintenance of those unfortunate creatures doomed to compose their cargoes.</P>
<P>The negroes, who inhabit the environs of the European colonies, give somewhat more atten∣tion to agriculture than the others;—they rear slocks; they cultivate rice in greater quantities; and in their gardens are found pulse, of which the seed has been brought from Europe; yet all they know of agriculture, they have learnt from the Europeans settled amongst them; their own ex∣perience is extremely bounded; and I have nev∣er been able to discover in their industry any process which could in the least improve our own.</P>
<P>From the river of Angola to Cape Negroe, and from thence till you approach the Cape of Good Hope, nothing is to be seen but sterile uncultivated
<PB N="9" REF="032696_0005_0FF4310BE4FD1DC0"/>
lands; the coasts are naked, and covered with barren sands; and you are under the necessity of travelling many leagues before yon can discover a palm-tree, or the slightest verdure. The coun∣try and its few inhabitants seem to be struck with one common curse. From the informations I have received touching these countries from the Italian missionaries, who, with an admirable zeal, have penetrated into the heart of these accursed re∣gions, I learn likewise that agriculture is just as languid in the interior parts as upon the coasts, al∣though, in many places, the soil appeared much more fruitful from its natural productions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>The Cape of Good Hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HEAD>
<P>The countries around the Cape were condemn∣ed to the same sterility before the Dutch took pos∣session of them; but since their establishment on this point of Africa, the lands produce in abun∣dance wheat and grain of every kind, wines of different qualities, and a considerable quantity of exellent fruits, collected from every quarter of the world: There you see extensive pastures covered with horses, black cattle, and sheep— these herds and flocks thrive exceedingly well. The abundance which this colony enjoys, com∣pared to the barrenness of the surrounding coun∣tries, evidently demonstrates that the earth de∣nies her favors only to the tyrant and the slave; but becomes prodigal of her treasures, beyond the most sanguine hope, so soon as she is free, and cultivated by men of discernment, whom wise and invariable laws protect.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="032696_0006_0FF4310D69A28DD8"/>A number of Frenchmen, forced from their coun∣try by the revocation of the edict of Nantz, have on this coast found a new establishment, and with it, security, property, and liberty, the only true encouragers of agriculture, the only principles of abundance. They have enriched this adopted mother by their industry; they have there founded considerable colonies, some of which bear the name of that unhappy country which de∣nied them the use of water and of fire, the re∣membrance of which however they still fondly cherish.</P>
<P>The colony of Little Rochelle surpasses all the rest, by the industry of the colonists, and the fertil∣ity of the lands which belong to it. The pastures are there composed of a variety of grasses, natives of the country, together with several different species of herbage, which compose our artificial meadows in Europe, such as trefoil, lucern, and faintfoin. The exotic plants, the seeds of which have been imported by the Dutch, flourish there as the natural productions of the country. Those seeds are sown by an operation of the plough; they cut the grass only the first year; the second they open the meadows to cattle, which live there at discretion, without any other attention than that of collecting them together every evening into a park enclosed with strong and high palli∣sades, to secure them against the lions and tigers, with which this country abounds.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="032696_0006_0FF4310D69A28DD8"/>Some of these enclosures are watered only by the rains, although they generally endeavor to chuse them in the neighborhood of some brook, where they dig commodious watering places. In all these pasturages, they have an eye to groves of trees, where the herds and flocks may find shel∣ter against the intense heat of the sun; particu∣larly in January, February and March, which in this part of the world are the most sultry months in the year.</P>
<P>The arable land is here labored as in Europe, sometimes by horses, but oftener by oxen: the Dutch of this colony have by their industry cor∣rected the natural sluggishness of these latter ani∣mals, by exercising them while young in a brisk pace; in consequence of which I have seen, at the Cape, carriages, drawn by teams of ten or a dozen yoke of oxen, go as expeditiously as if drawn by horses.</P>
<P>The grains commonly sown at the Cape, are wheat, turkey corn, and rice; these generally produce an increase of fifty-fold. They culti∣vate a variety off different kinds of pulse, such as pease, common beans, and French beans. This pulse makes a refreshing provision to the ships touching at the Cape going or returning to In∣dia.</P>
<P>A particular species of this pulse is much in re∣quest in India, to which they export a considera∣ble quantity; it is there known by the name of
<PB N="12" REF="032696_0007_0FF4310EF2237AD0"/>
<HI>Cape-Pease:</HI> it is a kind of French bean which requires no prop; its grain is of the form of that bean, but larger and flatter; it tastes like our green peas, and preserves its freshness for a long time. I have this year attempted the culture of this plant, which promises success. The climate at the Cape seems to demand from the cultivator an attention which appears not so necessary in this country, and which would even perhaps be prejudicial to the productions of our lands.</P>
<P>The Cape however is exposed the greatest part of the year to violent hurricanes, which blow generally from the north-east. These winds are so impetuous that they would beat down the fruits from the trees, and sweep to destruction the la∣bors of the farmer, had they not provided a bar∣rier for the security of the harvest. The Dutch colonists have divided their lands into small fields, which they have surrounded with high pallisades of oaks and other trees, planted very close to one another, some what resembling a charmille, de∣signed for the ornament of a garden. These pal∣lisades they cut every year, as they grow; their height being commonly from twenty-five to thir∣ty feet; every separate field, in consequence, is enclosed like a chamber.</P>
<P>It is by this industry alone that the Dutch have rendered this colony not only the granary of all their settlements in the East-Indies, but the most commodious place for vessels to touch at for re∣freshments and provisions of all kinds.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="032696_0007_0FF4310EF2237AD0"/>When the Dutch began to form their vine∣yards, they endeavored to procure plants from those cantons which enjoyed the greatest repu∣tation for their wines; but after many fruitless attempts to produce, at the extremity of Africa, the vines of Burgundy and Champagne, they ap∣plied to rearing the plants transported from Spain, the Canaries, and the Levant, where the climate is more analagous to the Cape. At present the plants which are cultivated most successfully, are those of the Muscadel kind: the red Muscadel particularly, which they rear in a small district called Constance, produces most delicious wine; the Dutch East-India Company always secure this vintage, which they send in presents to the sover∣eigns of Europe.</P>
<P>The vines at the Cape are cultivated without vine-props; the method of labour is much the same with that in France. The vineyards are surrounded by a number of trees, upon which they entwine the slips of the great Spanish Musca∣dine, in form of espaliers, very high, by which the vines are sheltered from the violence of the winds.</P>
<P>The same attention, at the Cape, is paid to gar∣dening, as to the other branches of agriculture. You there find all the variety of European pulse, greens, herbs, and roots, with the best of those peculiar to other parts of the world. Indepen∣dent of the gardens of the colonists, which are kept in as fine order as any in Europe, the India
<PB N="14" REF="032696_0008_0FF431121B565638"/>
Company have caused to lay out two or three gardens, extensive and magnificent, which they support with an expense worthy of a sovereign company.</P>
<P>Fifteen or twenty European gardeners, whose abilities are approved before they are embarked, are employed in the cultivation of each of those vast gardens, under the direction of a principal gardener, whose place is lucrative and honora∣ble. It is in those gardens, at the expense of the company, that all the experiments are made in every new species of culture; and it is there that every private individual is provided gratis, with such plants and seeds as he may have occasion for, together with the necessary instructions for their cultivation. These gardens furnish, in the great∣est abundance, herbage and fruits of various kinds to the company's ships.</P>
<P>Travellers cannot but with pleasure and admi∣ration observe large enclosures consecrated to the study and improvement of Botany, in which the most rare and useful plants, from every quarter of the world, are arranged in the most excellent order: the curious have the additional satisfaction also of finding skilful gardeners, who take plea∣sure in describing and pointing out their virtues.</P>
<P>Those beautiful gardens are terminated by large orchards, where are to be found all the fruits of Europe, together with several natives of Africa and Asia. Nothing is more agreeable
<PB N="15" REF="032696_0008_0FF431121B565638"/>
than to see in different expositions, even in the same enclosure, the chesnut, the apple, and other trees, from the most northern climates, together with the muscadine of the Indies, the camphres of Borneo, the palms, and a variety of other trees, which are natives of the torrid zone.</P>

<HEAD>MADAGASCAR.</HEAD>
<P>After doubling the Cape of Good Hope, you enter the Indian sea, where you find the great Isl∣and to Madagascar: we are still unacquainted with many places of this island, though the Portu∣guese, Dutch, French, and other Europeans have had settlements, and frequented it, above two centuries. Those parts which we know, are ve∣ry fertile, and the inhabitants would in all proba∣bility, cultivate them extremely well, were there a vent for their productions. They rear numer∣ous herds of cattle and sheep; their pasturages, such as nature has formed them, are rich: in ma∣ny cantons are large tracts of tilled ground, cov∣ered with grass of an extraordinary size, which grows to the height of five or six feet; the natives call it <HI>Fatak;</HI> it is excellent for nourishing and fattening their horned cattle, which are of the largest species, and differ in shape from ours, par∣ticularly by a large fleshy protuberance on their neck.—Another grass, of a finer blade, shoots spontaneously through the sands on the sea coast, which furnishes food for the sheep: these are of the same species with those of Barbary, and differ from ours most remarkably, by the monstrous size
<PB N="16" REF="032696_0009_0FF4292DF5BC4190"/>
of their tails, which weigh in general from six to eight pounds.</P>
<P>The Madecasses or Malegaches (which is the name of the inhabitants of this island) cultivate scarce any other grain but rice: they sow at the commencement of the rainy season; in conse∣quence of which they are not under the necessity of watering their fields. In laboring their ground, they use no other instrument but the pickaxe; they begin by grubbing up all the weeds; then five or six men, ranging themselves in a line on the field, dig little holes as they pass along, into which the women or children, who follow, throw the grains of the rice, and then with their feet cover them with earth: a field sown in this man∣ner produces an increase of above eighty or a hundred fold, which proves rather the extreme fertility of the soil, than the goodness of the cul∣tivation: badly understood as it may be, how∣ever, the inhabitants of Madagascar live in abun∣dance. In no country in the world, that I have seen, are rice and other essential provisions cheap∣er than in this island. For a remnant of coarse blue cloth, which may be worth perhaps twenty pence, the Madecasse gives two or three measures of rice. These measures are furnished by the Eu∣ropeans, who never fail to enlarge them every year; yet the islanders do not complain. The measure is first of all heaped; the buyer then, in virtue of an established right for securing good measure, thrusts his arm to the elbow in the rice, and with one sweep empties it almost entirely,
<PB N="17" REF="032696_0009_0FF4292DF5BC4190"/>
which the Madecasse has the patience a second time to replenish, without a murmur. This mea∣sure is called a <HI>Gamelle,</HI> which, thus filled, will hold about 160 pounds of pure rice.</P>
<P>There cannot be a doubt, but if our [the French] India Company, who alone are in posses∣sion of the trade with the natives of this island, would give proper encouragement to agriculture, it would in a short time make a rapid progress.— Our islands of Bourbon and France would here always find a certain resource against those dearths which too frequently distress the latter of these islands. Our squadrons bound for India, who put into the Isle of France for refreshments, would there always find abundance of provisions brought from Madagascar, and of consequence would not be subjected to the necessity of losing their time at the Cape, or at Batavia, begging refreshments from the Dutch, whilst the enemies of France, as happened in the late war, are conquering their settlements, and destroying their trade.</P>
<P>Wheat would grow in Madagascar in the same abundance as rice: it was formerly cultivated successfully in the settlement which we then pos∣sessed at the southern point of the island, called Fort Dauphin. Even at this day fine stalks of wheat are still to be found there, produced from the scattering grains of the ancient crops, which being blown about by the winds have annually, since our being drove from that settlement, sown of themselves, and sprung up at random, amongst
<PB N="18" REF="032696_0010_0FF431139E6A58B0"/>
the native herbs of the country. The lands there are of inconceiveable fertility; the islanders in∣telligent and ingenious. In those districts where the Arabs have not penetrated, the simple laws of nature are their guides; their manners the man∣ners of the primitive ages. These laws, and these manners, are more favorable for agricul∣ture, than all our sublime speculations, than all our most applauded theories on the most approv∣ed practice; than all those ineffectual means now employed to re-animate an art, which our man∣ners teach us to regard with contempt, or treat with levity; and which is perpetually harrassed, perpetually oppressed by innumerable abuses, which derive their source from the very laws themselves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>The Isle of Bourbon.</HEAD>
<P>Almost 200 leagues east of Madagascar lie the two islands of Bourbon and France; the soil of which is naturally as fertile as that of Madagas∣car, whilst they enjoy a happier climate. Bour∣bon has no port; it is of consequence little fre∣quented by the shipping. The inhabitants have preserved their simplicity of manners, and aggri∣culture is there in a flourishing state. The island produces wheat, rice, and maize, not only for its own consumption, but even furnishes a small sup∣ply to the Isle of France: the culture there is the same as at Madagascar. The horned cattle and sheep, which they have imported from that island, thrive here extremely well, especially as they have
<PB N="19" REF="032696_0010_0FF431139E6A58B0"/>
also introduced the grass called <HI>Fatak,</HI> which, as I have before observed, makes excellent pastur∣age.</P>
<P>The lands of this island are principally employ∣ed in the culture of the coffee-tree. The first plants of this shrubby tree were brought from Mocha. It multiplies by its grains sowing spon∣taneously; little attention is required; nothing more is necessary than to grub up, three or four times during the first year, the neighboring weeds, which would otherwise rob it of its proper nour∣ishment: the second year it grows without care; its branches, which extend horizontally along the surface of the ground, by their shade stifle the growth of all such weeds, as might shoot up within their circumference: at the end of eighteen months the coffee-tree begins to bear fruit, and in three years yields a plentiful crop. They plant these trees chequer-wise, at about the distance of seven feet from one another, and when they grow too tall, prune them to the height of perhaps two feet from the ground.</P>
<P>The coffee-tree demands a light soil: it thrives better in sand almost pure, than in rich ground: they observe in the isle of Bourbon, that these trees yield annually, one with another, about a pound of coffee: this fruit comes to perfection, and is gathered in during dry weather, which gives it a great advantage over the West-india coffee, which never ripens nor is got-in but in the rainy seasons. The coffee, after it is gather∣ed
<PB N="20" REF="032696_0011_0FF4311524959DA8"/>
in, must be dried; for several days, therefore, it is exposed to the sun, till the bean becomes ex∣tremely dry; they then clear it of the pulp, which is done by pestles in large wooden troughs.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>The Isle of France.</HEAD>
<P>This island possesses two excellent harbors, where all the shipping of the French Company, employed in the commerce of China and the In∣dies, touch for refreshments; here also rendez∣vous their armaments in times of war: this island is, of consequence, not so solitary as Bourbon. The politics and manners of Europe have here more influence. The lands are as fertile as those of Bourbon; rivulets, which are never dry, water it like a garden: notwithstanding which, the harvests often fail, and scarcity is here almost perpetually felt.</P>
<P>Since the days of the celebrated M. de la Bourdonnois (who governed this island for ten or twelve years, and ought to be regarded, as the founder of the colony, for his introduction and patronage of agriculture) they have wandered in∣cessantly from project to project, attempting the culture of almost every species of plants, without properly prosecuting any one of them. The cof∣fee, the cotton, the indigo, the sugar-cane, the pear, the cinnamon, the mulberry, the tea, and the cocoa trees, have all been cultivated by ex∣periments, but in such a superficial manner as
<PB N="21" REF="032696_0011_0FF4311524959DA8"/>
could never secure success. Had they followed the simple plan of the founder, which was to se∣cure bread, the island would at this day have been flourishing; abundance would then have reigned amongst the colonists, and the shipping never been disappointed of the necessary refresh∣ments and provisions.</P>
<P>The cultivation of grain, nevertheless, though neglected and badly understood, is that which suc∣ceeds the best. Those lands, which are so em∣ployed, yield annually a crop of wheat, and an∣other of rice or Turkey-corn, without the inter∣vention of one fallow year, and without the least improvement, or any other mode of labor, than that which is practised at Madagascar.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maniac</HI> was first introduced into this isl∣and by M. de la Bourdonnois: the culture of this plant was at first attended with very great difficulty, but is now the principal resource of the colonists for the nourishment of their slaves. As the culture of this root is here the same as in America, I shall not repeat what has been relat∣ed by a number of travellers.</P>
<P>They formerly brought from Madagascar black cattle and sheep; but since they have discovered that more advantage attends the transportation of slaves they have neglected the increase of their cattle, which the continual demands of the ship∣ping and the wants of the inhabitants at the same time daily diminish: Besides, they have never
<PB N="22" REF="032696_0012_0FF431182B746B90"/>
hitherto formed any pastures; such as they have attempted having been laid out with so little skill, that they have not succeeded. The island produ∣ces naturally, in different cantons, an excellent kind of grass, which grows to the height of five or six feet. This grass begins to appear above ground about the beginning of the rainy season; it performs all its vegetation during the three months, which this season lasts: the inhabitants take advantage of this to pasture their herds, who fatien upon it amazingly; but the vegetation over, there remains nothing on the ground but a straw too hard to afford nourishment to the cattle; and soon after the fire, which is kindled here by a thousand accidents, consumes this straw, and with it frequently part of the neighboring for∣ests. During the remainder of the year, the herds wander about and languish amongst the woods.</P>
<P>The greatest fault which has been committed in this island, and which has proved most prejudicial to cultivation, is the method of clearing the woods from off the grounds by fire, without leav∣ing groves and thickets at proper distances. The rains, in this island, conduce most to the ameliora∣tion of the grounds; but the clouds being stopt by the forests, there the rains fall; whilst the clear∣ed lands are scarce watered by a single drop: the fields, at the same time, being thus deprived of defence, are exposed to the violence of the winds, which often entirely destroy the harvests. The Dutch, as we have before observed, found no
<PB N="23" REF="032696_0012_0FF431182B746B90"/>
trees at the Cape; but they have planted them there, as shelter for their habitations. The Isle of France, on the contrary, was covered with woods, and the colonists have entirely destroyed them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>Coast of Coromandel.</HEAD>
<P>Agriculture has ever flourished in the East-In∣dies; it has, however, degenerated since the conquest of this country by the Moguls; who, like all barbarous nations, have despised that in∣dustry which nourishes mankind, to attach them∣selves to that destructive art which desolates the earth.</P>
<P>The conquerors, when they took possession of the country, appropriated to themselves at the same time all the lands. The Mogul emperors divided them into great moveable fiefs, which they distributed amongst their grandees; these farmed them out to their vassals; and those again to others; so that the lands are now no longer cul∣tivated but by the servants and day-labourers of the sub-farmers.</P>
<P>As no country in the world is more exposed to revolution than the Indies, subjected to masters whose government is an absolute anarchy, the possessor of the fief, as well as the farmer, for ever uncertain of their fate, endeavor to make the most of the lands and their cultivators, without ever bestowing a thought on improvement. For∣tunately
<PB N="24" REF="032696_0013_0FF43119B74EA930"/>
for these barbarian conquerors, the con∣quered natives, inviolably attached to their an∣cient manners, apply themselves incessantly to agriculture, from inclination, and from religion. Notwithstanding the frantic despotism of the Mo∣gul government, the Malabar,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French give the name of Malabar not only to the ancient inhabitants of the Malabar coast, but in general to the Aborigines of the great peninsula of Indostan.</NOTE> despising and pi∣tying the master whom he obeys, cultivates, with the same ardor as if he was proprietor, the fields of his ancestors, the care of which is confided to him by the usurper.</P>
<P>The laborers are a tribe much honored among the Indians. Religion has consecrated agriculture, even to the animals destined for the labor of the ground. As the Indians in general are deficient in pastures, as horses are scarce, as buffaloes and other cattle for the draught multiply but slowly, the ancient Indian policy made it a crime against their religion to kill these useful animals. The Malabars make them more serviceable than any other people: they employed them, as we do, in laboring the ground; as also in drawing their carriages, and in carrying every kind of load: there are no other beasts of burden in the neigh∣borhood of Pondicherry. I am convinced that in every country they might be rendered equally useful.</P>
<P>The soil on the Coromandel coast is light, dry, and sandy; the industry and labor, however, of
<PB N="25" REF="032696_0013_0FF43119B74EA930"/>
the natives make it produce two crops every year, without the necessity of one fallow season. After the rice harvest is over, there is always a crop of some smaller grains, such as millet and a species of French beans, of which India produces a variety of different kinds.</P>
<P>The most remarkable process of Indian hus∣bandry, is the watering their grounds for the cul∣ture of rice.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Machine for watering Rice Grounds.</HEAD>
<P>If the grounds they propose watering, have neither rivulet nor fountain sufficiently abundant, they dig a pit-well, on the brink of which they raise a pillar of near the same height as the depth of the well. At the summit of this pillar, which is forked, is an iron bar, which crossing both divi∣sions horizontally, supports a kind of see-saw, to one end of which a ladder is suspended; the oth∣er end of this see-saw, projects from the top of the pillar about three feet, having a long pole fast∣ened to it in a position parallel with the pillar, at which hangs a large bucket of wood or copper: by the side of this machine is a large reservoir, built with bricks and closely cemented, elevated above the level of the grounds they propose to water; the opening whence the waters are dis∣charged being on that side which fronts the field. Every thing being thus disposed, a man ascends to the top of the column, by the ladder fixed to the see-saw: as soon as he has reached the
<PB N="26" REF="032696_0014_0FF4311B44E8CA48"/>
top, another man, stationed by the side of the re∣servoir, plunges the bucket, which is suspended by the pole, into the well; upon which he at the top descends the ladder, and bringing thereby the bucket full of water to a level with the reservoir, the other there empties it. As soon as the reser∣voir is full, they open a kind of sluice; the inun∣dation begins, and is kept constantly flowing by the operations of these two men, who sometimes are thus employed whole days, the one ascending and descending, the other throwing the bucket in∣to the well, and emptying it when full.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Mode of Labor.</HEAD>
<P>The Malabars labor their grounds with instru∣ments resembling the Aire and the Souchée, in use in the south of France. They employ oxen, but more commonly buffaloes; these last being stronger, and more capable of enduring the heat, than the oxen, which, on the coast of Coroman∣del, are generally weakly, and of a small size.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Flocks of Sheep, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>These animals are generally fed with the straw of rice, some herbs and boiled beans. Here and there in the fields you see some small flocks of goats, and others of sheep, which differ from ours by their being covered with hair instead of wool. They are known in the French colonies by the name of <HI>Chiens marous.</HI> These flocks, however, are lean, and multiply but slowly.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="032696_0014_0FF4311B44E8CA48"/>Were the inhabitants of India to eat the flesh of animals, like the Europeans, their cattle would very soon be destroyed. It appears, therefore, that the religious law rendering it criminal for an Indian to eat the flesh of animals, has been dicta∣ted by the wisdom of sound policy, which has employed the authority of religion to secure obe∣dience to a regulation which the nature of the cli∣mate required.</P>
<P>The principal food of the Malabars is grain, butter, pulse, and fruits. They eat nothing which has ever enjoyed life. The countries to the south and west of Indostan, are the granaries of this vast continent, and maintain the inhabit∣ants in abundance. These countries still remain in the possession of the Aborigines of the country, whose laws are extremely favorable for agricul∣ture. The Moguls have endeavored often to make themselves masters of these countries, but hitherto in vain.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Gardens.</HEAD>
<P>In the Malabar gardens there is no kind of pulse equal to ours. Exclusive of the various kinds of French bean, some of which are of the arborescent kind; the best they cultivate is the <HI>Bazella,</HI> known in France by the name of the <HI>Spinage of China;</HI> this is a lively, clambering plant, which, while growing, they support upon sticks, like our peas, or prop up against the walls, which it very soon
<PB N="28" REF="032696_0015_0FF4311F359DFF78"/>
covers with a most agreeable verdure; its taste is almost the same with our spinage.</P>
<P>Gardening is but little known on the Coro∣mandel coast. The orchards are better supplied than the gardens; yet they have no fruits that can be compared to those of Europe. They do not understand the art of engrafting. Their most common fruits are the pine-apple, the man∣go, the bonana, and the gouyave. The two first of these fruits are but indifferent on the Coro∣mandel coast, though excellent on the Malabar coast, and several other parts of India.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Cocoa-Tree.</HEAD>
<P>The most useful of all the trees in their or∣chards is undoubtedly the cocoa-tree. This tree bears clusters of nuts of an immense size. When these nuts are ripe, they yield a species of oil in great abundance, which the Indians use for vari∣ous purposes, particularly in seasoning their gar∣den stuff: the taste of this oil, however, is ex∣tremely disagreeable to those who are not accus∣tomed to eat it. But the method of rendering the culture of this tree most advantageous, is the extracting wine from its fruit. The Indian watches the time when the nuts of the cocoa-tree have attained to the size of our ordinary nuts which happens soon after the fall of the flower▪ he then makes an incision in the stalk of the clus∣ter about seven or eight inches from the trunk o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the tree; here he fastens an earthen vessel to re¦ceive
<PB N="29" REF="032696_0015_0FF4311F359DFF78"/>
the juice, which issues in great abundance: the mouth of the vessel he carefully wraps round with a cloth, to prevent the admission of the air, which would soon turn it to the fret. The ves∣sel fills in twenty-four hours: the Indian takes care to change it every day. This natural wine, which is called <HI>Soury,</HI> is sold and drunk in this state. It has much of the taste and strength of the <HI>Must,</HI> or new wine of the grape: it keeps, how∣ever, but a few days; it is necessary then to distil it, otherwise it would sour, and become entirely useless. This species of wine, when distilled, is the well-known liquor called <HI>Arrak.</HI></P>
<P>A cocoa-tree, thus managed, is worth a pagoda (about eight shillings) per annum. These trees are planted about twenty-five or thirty feet dist∣ant from each other. They produce nothing for ten or twelve years, but then annually bear fruit for above fifty years. They flourish best in a mixed sandy soil; and succeed extremely well even in pure sand.</P>
<P>The Malabars cultivate, in the open fields, a variety of plants, whose productions are of an oily substance; such as the <HI>Sesame</HI> or <HI>Gergelin,</HI> which is a kind of fox-grass, and the <HI>Ricin</HI> or <HI>Palma Christi.</HI> The fresh oil extracted from this plant, which is known in Europe for a violent and dan∣gerous caustic, cannot have the same hurtful qual∣ity in the Indies, as the Malabars consider it as a gentle purgative, and the best remedy for almost all the diseases incident to infants at the breast;
<PB N="30" REF="032696_0016_0FF4312349BEA4E8"/>
giving them usually, every month, a spoon-full of it, mixed in an equal quantity of their mother's milk.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this article by observing, that the reader must not form an idea of agriculture over the Indies in general, from the sketch I have given of that on the Coromandel coast: this coast and the countries adjacent, form but a small part of the East-Indies, properly so called: they are, at the same time, the most barren, and have suf∣fered most from the devastations of the Moguls, from the destructive government of these con∣querors, and from the continual wars which har∣rass and depopulate the country. The coasts of Orixa, Malabar, the territory of Surat, the banks of the Ganges, and the interior parts of Indostan, are much more fertile, and in many of these coun∣tries agriculture flourishes surprisingly.—I re∣late nothing but facts, which I had opportunities of observing myself.</P>

<HEAD>The Kingdom of Siam.</HEAD>
<P>The kingdom of Siam, situate on the peninsula of the Indies beyond the Ganges, is in general extremely fertile. Divided, like Indostan, by a chain of mountains from north to south, it enjoys all the year round, and at the same time, two ve∣ry opposite seasons. The western division, all along the bay of Bengal, is deluged by continual rains, during the six months that the monsoons continue to blow from the west. This season is
<PB N="31" REF="032696_0016_0FF4312349BEA4E8"/>
considered as their winter on this coast; whilst in the other division of the kingdom, towards the east, they enjoy the finest climate, and never ex∣perience that difference of season, which reigns on the western side, except by the overflowing of the Menam. This noble river runs along a great way among mountains, where the rains concenter: it washes the walls of the capital, and annually overflows, without the least ravage, a delightful country, covered all over with rice plantations. The slime, which the Menam leaves behind, enriches the soil prodigiously; the rice seems to grow up in proportion as the inundation rises, and the river at length gently retires by de∣grees into its bed, as the rice approaches to matu∣rity, and has no further occasion for its waters. How bountiful has nature been to those who in∣habit this charming country!—she has, however, done more: the fields produce, in profusion, an infinite variety of most delicate fruits, which re∣quire almost no cultivation; such as the pine-ap∣ple, the mangoustas (the most delicate fruit per∣haps in the world) mangoes of different kinds, and all excellent, several species of oranges, the banana, the ducion, the gacca, with other fruits of an inferior quality. Nature, still more bounti∣ful, has also scattered over this country, almost on the surface of the ground, mines of gold, cop∣per, and a species of fine tin, which there, as in other parts of India, they name <HI>Calin.</HI></P>
<P>In this terrestial paradise, surrounded with so much riches, who would imagine that the Siam∣ese
<PB N="32" REF="032696_0017_0FF43126987E8200"/>
are, perhaps, the most wretched people in the world?</P>
<P>The government of Siam is despotic: the sov∣ereign alone enjoys that liberty which is natural to all mankind: his subjects are all his slaves; every one of them is annually taxed at six months personal service without wages, and even with∣out food: he allows them the other six months to procure themselves wherewithal to exist the year. Under such a government, there is no law that can afford protection to individuals against violence, or in the smallest degree secure them in their property. Every thing is subjected to the caprice of a prince, rendered brutal by every spe∣cies of excess, particularly that of power; who passes his days locked up in his seraglio, without an idea of any thing beyond the walls of his pa∣lace; and particularly ignorant of the wretched condition of his subjects. These are exposed to the avarice of the grandees, who themselves are only the chief slaves, and tremblingly approach, on appointed days, the presence of their tyrant, whom they adore like a divinity, though subject to the most dangerous caprices.</P>
<P>Religion alone has preserved the power of pro∣tecting against tyranny those who, ranging them∣selves under its standard, are admitted into the order of the priests of <HI>Somonacondom,</HI> the deity of the Siamese. Those who embrace this order, and their number is considerable, are by law obli∣ged to observe the strictest celibacy, which in a
<PB N="33" REF="032696_0017_0FF43126987E8200"/>
warm climate, such as that of Siam, whilst it oc∣casions great disorders, almost depopulates the country.</P>
<P>It may easily be conceived, that under such a government agriculture cannot flourish; it may be said, even, that no regard is paid to it at all, when the small portion of ground which is la∣bored, is compared to the immense extent of lands which are totally neglected.</P>
<P>With regard even to those grounds which they have laid out, nature may be said to do every thing. Men oppressed, debased, without spirit, nay, in a manner without hands, give themselves scarce any other trouble than just to reap what the earth pro∣duces; and, as the country is extensive, and thinly peopled, they enjoy abundance of necessaries, al∣most without labor.</P>
<P>From the port of Mergin, situated on the west∣ern coast of this kingdom, to the capital, during a journey of ten or twelve days, you cross im∣mense plains, charmingly watered, and the soil excellent; some of which appear to have been formerly tilled, but now lie quite uncultivated. This journey travellers are under the necessity of making in caravans, in order to defend them∣selves from the tygers and the elephants, to which this fine country is in a manner entirely abandoned, during a journey of eight days there scarce being the vestige of a habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="032696_0018_0FF4312823403B20"/>The environs of the capital are cultivated; the lands belonging to the king, those of the princess, the ministers, and principal officers, dis∣play the amazing fertility of the country, produc∣ing, as I have been assured, an increase of two hundred fold.</P>
<P>The Siamese method of cultivating their rice, is first to sow it very thick in a small square plot of ground, well watered, a little below the surface of the earth. As soon as the plants have grown about five or six inches high, they pull them up by the roots, and transplant them, in small par∣cels of three or four stalks, distant from each other about four inches every way. These plants are placed deep in a clay soil, which has been previ∣ously well labored with a plough, drawn by two buffaloes. The rice transplanted in this manner, has beyond comparison a much greater increase, than if allowed to grow up in the same ground where it was originally planted.</P>
<P>It is the Chinese, and the Cochin-chinese, set∣tled in the capital and its neighborhood, who con∣tribute most to the improvement of the grounds. These strangers are useful to the sovereign, by the commerce they carry on with him, and it is the interest of the government to protect them from oppression.</P>
<P>In the neighborhood of the uncultivated lands I have mentioned, you find others, belonging to different individuals, who, discouraged by con∣tinual
<PB N="35" REF="032696_0018_0FF4312823403B20"/>
oppressions, have quite abandoned them. It is astonishing, however, to observe these lands, frequently neither labored nor sown for years to∣gether, produce extraordinary crops of rice. The grain, reaped negligently, sows of itself, and re-produces annually another harvest, by the help of the inundations of the river Menam; which proves, at the same time, the extreme fer∣tility of the ground, and the extreme misery of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The orchards of the prince, and the great Tal∣apoins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A religious order.</NOTE> are admirable for the variety of their fruits, all of the most exquisite kind; but these delicacies no private individual is allowed to en∣joy. When a man is so unhappy as to have in his grounds a tree of excellent fruit, such as the mangoustas, a party of soldiers never fail to come every year, to secure, for the king, or some great minister, the produce of this tree. They take an account of every mangousta, good or bad, making the proprietor guardian and security for the whole; and when the fruits ripen, should there happen the smallest deficiency the poor pro∣prietor is subjected to all the insolence of unre∣strained power; it becomes of consequence, a real misfortune for a private man to be possessed of such a tree.</P>
<P>The Siamese rear herds of buffaloes, and horned cattle; but all the care they take of them, is to con∣duct
<PB N="36" REF="032696_0019_0FF429338155CC00"/>
them in the day time, to the fallow grounds, which abound in pastures, and re-conduct them, in the evening, to the enclosures, in order to secure them from the tygers, of which there are great numbers in this country. The milk, and a very little labor, is all the advantage they draw from them. Their religion, which is the same that pre∣vails in Indostan, and which the Talap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s alone know any thing about, forbids them killing these animals. They elude, however, this law, by selling them to the Mahometans, settled among them, who kill them, and sell their flesh private∣ly. They have also great numbers of poul∣try, particularly ducks of the best kinds in the Indies.</P>
<P>The king maintains a number of tame ele∣phants. Each of these monstrous animals has twelve or fifteen men daily employed in cutting herbs, bananiers (a kind of large rose) and sugar∣canes. They are after all of no real use; they serve only for shew. They display, say the Sia∣mese, the grandeur of their prince; and he con∣ceives an idea of his greatness, more from the number of his elephants, than from the number of his subjects.</P>
<P>These animals, wherever they come, make most destructive havock; of this their keepers take advantage, making every individual, who is possessed of cultivated lands, or gardens, pay an∣nually a certain tribute: should they refuse, the elephants would immediately be let loose, and
<PB N="37" REF="032696_0019_0FF429338155CC00"/>
ravage and ruin desolate their fields: for what subject would be hardy enough to dare to fail in respect to the elephants of the king of Siam, ma∣ny of which, to the disgrace of humanity, are load∣ed with a profusion of titles, and preferred to the first dignities in the kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>THE MALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>Beyond the kingdom of Siam is the peninsula of Malacca; a country formerly well peopled, and, consequently, well cultivated. This nation was once one of the greatest powers, and made a very considerable figure on the theatre of Asia. The sea was covered with their ships, and they carried on a most extensive commerce. Their laws, however, were apparently very different from those which subsist among them at present. From time to time they sent out numbers of colo∣nies, which, one after another, peopled the islands of Sumatra, Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, Borneo, the Celebes or Macas∣sor, the Moluccas, the Philippines, and those innu∣merable islands of the Archipelago, which bound Asia on the east, and which occupy an extent of seven hundred leagues, in longitude, from east to west, by about six hundred of latitude, from north to south. The inhabitants of all these islands, those at least upon the coasts, are the same peo∣ple; they speak almost the same language, have the same laws, the same manners.—Is it not somewhat singular, that this nation, whose posses∣sions are so extensive, should scarce be known in Europe?—I shall endeavor to give you an idea of
<PB N="38" REF="032696_0020_0FF4312CED4B65E0"/>
those laws, and those manners; you will, from thence, easily judge of their agriculture.</P>
<P>Travellers, who make observations on the Malais, are astonished to find, in the centre of Asia, under the scorching climate of the line, the laws, the manners, the customs, and the prejudi∣ces of the ancient inhabitants of the north of Eu∣rope. The Malais are governed by feudal laws, that capricious system, conceived for the defence of the liberty of a few against the tyranny of one, whilst the multitude is subjected to slavery and oppression.</P>
<P>A chief who has the title of king, or sultan, issues his commands to his great vassals, who obey when they think proper. These have inferior vassals, who often act in the same manner with re∣gard to them. A small part of the nation live independent, under the title of <HI>Oramoai,</HI> or <HI>noble,</HI> and sell their services to those who pay them best; whilst the body of the nation is com∣posed of slaves, and live in perpetual servi∣tude.</P>
<P>With these laws the Malais are restless, fond of navigation, war, plunder, emigrations, colo∣nies, desperate enterprises, adventures, and gal∣lantry. They talk incessantly of their honor, and their bravery, whilst they are universally consid∣ered, by those with whom they have intercourse, as the most treacherous, ferocious people on the face of the globe; and yet, which appeared to
<PB N="39" REF="032696_0020_0FF4312CED4B65E0"/>
me extremely singular, they speak the softest lan∣guage of Asia. That which the Count de Forbin has said, in his memoirs, of the ferocity of the Macassars, is exactly true, and is the reigning characteristic of the whole Malay nations. More attached to the absurd laws of their pretended honor, than to those of justice or humanity, you always observe, that amongst them, the strong oppress and destroy the weak: their treaties of peace and friendship never subsisting beyond that self-interest which induced them to make them, they are almost always armed, and either at war amongst themselves, or employed in pillaging their neighbors.</P>
<P>This ferocity, which the Malais qualify under the name of courage, is so well known to the Eu∣ropean companies, who have settlements in the Indies, that they have universally agreed in pro∣hibiting the captains of their ships, who may put into the Maley Islands, from taking on board any seamen, of that nation, except in the greatest dis∣tress, and then, on no account, to exceed two or three.</P>
<P>It is nothing uncommon for a handful of these horrid savages suddenly to embark, attack a ves∣sel by surprise, poignard, in hand, massacre the people, and make themselves masters of her. Malay batteaus, with twenty-five or thirty men, have been known to board European ships of thirty or forty guns, in order to take possession of them, and murder with their poignards great
<PB N="40" REF="032696_0021_0FF429350BAF0EF0"/>
part of the crew. The Malay history is full of such enterprises, which mark the desperate fero∣city of these barbarians.</P>
<P>The Malais, who are not slaves, go always armed: they would think themselves disgraced, if they went abroad without their poignards, which they call <HI>Crit.</HI> The industry of this nation even surpasses itself, in the fabric of this destruc∣tive weapon.</P>
<P>As their lives are a perpetual round of agita∣tion and tumult, they could never endure the long flowing habits, which prevail amongst the other Asiatics. The habits of the Malais are ex∣actly adapted to their shapes, and loaded with a multitude of buttons, which fasten them close to their bodies in every part.—I relate these seem∣ingly trifling observations, in order to prove, that, in climates the most opposite, the same laws pro∣duce similar manners, customs, and prejudices. Their effect is the same too with respect to agri∣culture.</P>
<P>The lands possessed by the Malais are, in gen∣eral, of a superior quality. Nature seems to have taken pleasure in there assembling her most favorite productions. They have not only those to be found in the territories of Siam, but a vari∣ety of others peculiar to these islands. The coun∣try is covered with odoriferous woods, such as the eagle or aloes wood, the sandal, and the cassia odorata, a species of cinnamon. You there breathe
<PB N="41" REF="032696_0021_0FF429350BAF0EF0"/>
an air impregnated with the odours of innumera∣ble flowers of the greatest fragrance, of which there is a perpetual succession the year round, the sweet flavour of which captivates the soul, and inspires the most voluptuous sensations. No traveller, wandering over the plains of Malacca, but feels himself strongly impelled to wish his residence fixed in a place so luxuriant in allure∣ments, where nature triumphs without the assist∣ance of art.</P>
<P>The Malay islands produce various kinds of dying woods, particularly the <HI>Sapan,</HI> which is the same with the Brasil wood. There are also a number of gold mines, which the inhabitants of Sumatra and Mallaca call <HI>Ophirs:</HI> some of which, those especially on the eastern coast, are richer than those of Brasil or Peru. There are likewise mines of fine copper, mixed with gold, which the inhabitants name <HI>Tombage.</HI> In the islands of Su∣matra and Banea are mines of calin, or fine tin; and at Succadana, in the island of Borneo, is a mine of diamonds. Those islands enjoy also ex∣clusively, the rotin, the sagou, (or bread-palm-tree) the camphre, and other precious aromatics, which we know under the names of various spice∣ries.</P>
<P>The sea too teems with abundance of excellent fish, together with ambergris, pearls, and those de∣licate birds nests (so much in request in China) formed in the rocks with the spawn of fishes, and the foam of the sea, by a species of small sized
<PB N="42" REF="032696_0022_0FF4312E71CB9AB8"/>
swallow, peculiar to those seas: this is of such an exquisite substance and flavor, that the Chinese long purchased them for their weight in gold, and still buy them at an excessive price.</P>
<P>In the midst of all this luxuriance of nature, the Malay is miserable. The culture of the lands, abandoned to slaves, is fallen into con∣tempt. These wretched laborers, dragged in∣cessantly from their rustic employments by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stless masters, who delight in war and maritime enterprises, have rarely time, and never resolu∣tion, to give the necessary attention to the labor∣ing of their grounds. Their lands, in general, remain uncultivated; and produce no kind of grain for the subsistence of the inhabitants.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Sagou.</HEAD>
<P>The sagou-tree, in part, supplies the defect of grain. This admirable tree is a present which bountiful nature has made to men incapable of labor. It requires no culture; it is a species of the palm-tree, which grows naturally, in the woods, to the height of about twenty or thirty feet; its circumference being sometimes from five to six. Its ligneous bark is about an inch in thickness, and covers a multitude of long fibres, which, be∣ing interwoven one with another, envelope a mass of gummy kind of meal. As soon as this tree is ripe, a whitish dust, which transpires thro' the pores of the leaves, and adheres to their extremities, proclaims its maturity. The Malais then cut them
<PB N="43" REF="032696_0022_0FF4312E71CB9AB8"/>
down near the root, divide them into several sec∣tions, which they split into quarters: they then scoop out the mass of mealy substance, which is enveloped by and adheres to the fibres; they di∣lute it in pure water, and then pass it through a straining bag of fine cloth, in order to separate it from the fibres. When this paste has lost part of its moisture by evaporation, the Malais throw it into a kind of earthen vessels, of different shapes, where they allow it to dry and harden. This paste is wholesome, nourishing food, and preserves for many years.</P>
<P>The Indians, in general, when they eat the sagou, use no other preparation than diluting it in water; but sometimes they dress it after differ∣ent manners: they have the art of separating the finest of the flour, and reducing it to little grains, somewhat resembling grains of rice. The sagou, thus prepared, is preferred to the other, for the aged and infirm; and is an excellent remedy for many complaints in the stomach. When diluted either in cold or boiling water it forms a whitish jelly, very agreeable to the taste.</P>
<P>Though this sagou-bearing-palm grows natu∣rally in the forests, the Malay chiefs have formed considerable plantations of it, which constitute one of their principal resources for subsistence.</P>
<P>They might have the finest orchards in the world, would they give themselves the trouble to collect the various plants of those excellent fruits
<PB N="44" REF="032696_0023_0FF429378AB58BF0"/>
which nature has so liberally bestowed upon them: we find, however, none but a few straggling trees planted at random around their houses, or dis∣persed over their lands without symmetry or or∣der.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the great island of Java have somewhat better ideas of agriculture, than the other Malais, since their subjection to the govern∣ment of the Dutch. These sovereign merchants have taken advantage of the feudal system of the Malais, to reduce them under their yoke; art∣fully weakening the regal power, by fomenting, at times, the rebellions of the great vassals; and humbling the vassals, in their turn, by succoring their princes, when drove to the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>The Javanese begin to recover from that state of anarchy, the consequence of their ancient laws now almost no longer remembered. They cultivate with success, rice, coffee, indigo, and sugar-cane. They rear, on the eastern coast of the island, and in the districts of Madur and Solor, in the neighbor∣hood, numerous herds of buffaloes, of a monstrous size: their flesh is excellent, and they are of infi∣nite use in laboring the ground. They have like∣wise numbers of horned cattle, the largest and finest, perhaps, in the world. The common pas∣turage in this, and the rest of the Malay islands, is the same grass I have mentioned under the arti∣cle of the Isle of France, which the colonists there almost entirely neglect.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="032696_0023_0FF429378AB58BF0"/>Here it would be proper to describe the man∣ner of cultivating the spiceries, the indigo, the sugar-cane and the camphre; but these must be the subject of another discourse. I could have wished also to have comprehended, in this me∣moir, the observations I have made on the hus∣bandry of China. You could then have compar∣ed nation against nation; and, after having ob∣served agriculture despised and debased amongst barbarians, oppressed and loaded with fetters by their frantic laws, the genuine productions of delirium incompatible with reason, you would have beheld this art (divine it may be called, as taught to man by the great Author of his being) supported and protected by the most simple of laws, those of nature, dictated to her by the first inhabitants of the earth, and preserved, since the beginning of time, from generation to generation, by one of the wisest and greatest nations in the world. This comparative representation, whilst on the one hand, it displayed the misery and mis∣fortunes of every kind, which attend the neglect of agriculture, would, on the other, have demon∣strated how much this art, honored, protected and encouraged as it ought, will ever advance the happiness of the human race.</P>

<HEAD>PART SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>I LAST year began to give you a sketch of my inquiries into the state of agriculture among different nations of Africa and Asia. I observed that scarce a vestige of it could be traced amongst the stupid, the indolent negroes, who inhabit the western coasts of Africa; whilst it flourished, under the shade of liberty, amongst the Holland∣ers at the Cape of Good-Hope. I pointed out the happy abundance which reigned in the fertile island of Madagascar, inhabited by a people gov∣erned by the greatest simplicity of manners, and un∣acquainted with other laws than those of nature. Whilst I did justice also to the system of cultivation that prevailed at the Isle of Bourbon, which hav∣ing no po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and of consequence little or no inter∣course with Europe, the colonists have preserved an uncorrupted system of manners, ever favora∣ble for agriculture, I was, at the same time, un∣der the necessity of acknowledging, that this art which requires perseverance and simplicity, was greatly neglected at the Isle of France, which, having two excellent ports, and being much fre∣quented by European ships, was more influenced by the inconstant and volatile manners of our quarter of the world; and that, in consequence, though the soil, in point of fertility, was equal to
<PB N="47" REF="032696_0024_0FF4312FF6E256B8"/>
Madagascar and Bourbon, their harvests general∣ly failed, and an almost perpetual scarcity pre∣vailed over the island.—I passed from thence to the great peninsula of the Indies, where agricul∣ture, however oppressed by the barbarous laws of the Mogul conquerors, is still honored and sup∣ported by the religion, the manners, and the per∣severance of the conquered Malabars.—At Siam, under the happiest climate, and blessed with a soil inferior in fertility to no country in the world, agriculture we have observed debased by the in∣dignities of tyranny, and abandoned by a race of slaves, whom nothing can interest, after the loss of liberty.—I have represented it almost in the same condition amongst the Malais, who inhabit immense dominions, and innumerable islands, where nature has distributed her choicest trea∣sures, and lavished her bounties with a profusion unknown to other regions. The destructive ge∣nius of the feudal laws, which keep this people in a perpetual ferment, permits not their application to the culture of the finest soil in the world. Nature alone does all. I am convinced that if the other nations of the earth, who have the mis∣fortune to be governed by the feudal system, in∣habited a climate equally happy, and lands equally fertile with those of the Malais, their agriculture would be equally neglected: necessity alone could force the plough into their hands.</P>
<P>In my last discourse I endeavored to give you an idea of the most interesting modes of local agriculture which came under my observation:
<PB N="48" REF="032696_0025_0FF4313573914B40"/>
my principal object, however, was to enable you to remark that in every country, in every quarter of the world, the state of agriculture depends en∣tirely on the established laws, and, consequently, on the manners, customs, and prejudices from which these laws derived their origin. I now proceed.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>THE POWER OF AGRICULTURE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Origin of the Kingdom of Ponthiamas.</HEAD>
<P>Departing from the peninsula of Malacca, and the islands of the Malais, towards the north, I fell in with a small territory called <HI>Cancar,</HI> but known on the marine charts, under the name of <HI>Ponthi∣amas.</HI> Surrounded by the kingdom of Siam, where despotism and depopulation go hand in hand; the dominions of Camboya, where no idea of established government subsists; and the ter∣ritories of the Malais, whose genius, perpetually agitated by their feudal laws, can endure peace neither at home nor abroad: this charming coun∣try, about fifty years ago, was uncultivated, and almost destitute of inhabitants.</P>
<P>A Chinese merchant, commander of a vessel which he employed in commerce, frequented these coasts. Being a man of that intelligent reflective genius, which so characteristically marks his na∣tion, he could not, without pain, behold immense tracts of ground condemned to sterility, though naturally more fertile than those which formed the riches of his own country; he formed, there∣fore,
<PB N="49" REF="032696_0025_0FF4313573914B40"/>
a plan for their improvement. With this view, having first of all hired a number of labor∣ers, some Chinese, others from the neighboring nations, he, with great address, insinuated him∣self into the favor of the most powerful princes, who, for a certain subsidy, assigned him a guard for his protection.</P>
<P>In the course of his voyage to Batavia, and the Phillippine Islands, he borrowed from the Euro∣peans their most useful discoveries and improve∣ments, particularly the art of fortification and de∣fence: with regard to internal police, he gave the preference to the Chinese. The profits of his commerce soon enabled him to raise ramparts, sink ditches, and provide artillery. These preli∣minary precautions secured him from a coup de main, and protected him from the enterprises of the surrounding nations of barbarians.</P>
<P>He distributed the lands to his laborers, with∣out the least reservation of any of those duties or taxes known by the names of service or fines of alienation; duties which, by allowing no real pro∣perty, become the most fatal scourge to agricul∣ture, and is an idea which revolts against the common sense of every wise nation. He provid∣ed his colonists, at the same time, with all sorts of instruments proper for the labor and improve∣ment of their grounds.</P>
<P>In forming a laboring and commercial people, he thought, that no laws ought to be framed, but
<PB N="50" REF="032696_0026_0FF43136F88E93A0"/>
those which nature has established for the human race in every climate: he made these laws re∣spected by obeying them first himself, and exhi∣biting an example of simplicity, industry, frugal∣ity, humanity, and good faith:—he formed, then, no system of laws—he did more—he estab∣lished morals.</P>
<P>His territories soon became the country of eve∣ry industrious man, who wished to settle there. His port was open to all nations. The woods were cleared; the grounds judiciously labored, and sown with rice; canals, cut from the rivers, watered their fields; and plentiful harvests, af∣ter supplying them with subsistence, furnished an object of extensive commerce.</P>
<P>The barbarians of the neighborhood, amazed to see abundance so suddenly succeed to sterility, flocked for subsistence to the magazines of Ponthi∣amas; whose dominions, at this day, are consid∣ered as the most plentiful granary of that eastern part of Asia; the Malais, the Cochin-chinese, the Siamese, whose countries are naturally so fertile, considering this little territory as the most certain resource against famine.</P>
<P>Had the Chinese founder of this colony of mer∣cantile laborers, in imitation of the sovereigns of Asia, established arbitrary imposts; if by the in∣troduction of a feudal system, of which he had examples amongst the neighboring nations, he had vested in himself the sole property of the
<PB N="51" REF="032696_0026_0FF43136F88E93A0"/>
lands, under the specious pretence of giving them away to his colonists; if he had made luxury reign in his palace, in place of that simplicity which distinguished his humble dwelling; had he placed his ambition in a brilliant court, and crowds of fawning slaves; had he preferred the agreeable to the useful arts, despising the indus∣trious who labor the ground with the sweat of their brow, and provide sustenance for them∣selves and their fellow creatures; had he treated his associates as slaves; had he received into his port strangers in any other shape than as friends; his fields had still been barren, his dominions un∣peopled; and the wretched inhabitants must have died of hunger, notwithstanding all their know∣ledge of agriculture, and all the assistance they could derive from the most useful instruments either for tilling or sowing their grounds. But the sage Kiang-tse, (the name of this judicious Chinese) persuaded that he should always be rich, if his laborers were so, established only a very moderate duty on all the merchandise entered at his port; the produce of his lands appearing to him sufficient to render him powerful and great. His integrity, his moderation, and his humanity, made him respected. He never wished to reign; but only to establish the empire of reason. His son, who now fills his place, inherits his virtues as well as his possessions: by agriculture, and the commerce he carries on with the produce of his lands, he has become so powerful, that the barba∣rians his neighbors, stile him king, a title which he despises. He pretends to no right of sover∣eignty,
<PB N="52" REF="032696_0027_0FF4293A52F4B8E0"/>
but the noblest of all, that of doing good; happy in being the first laborer, and the first mer∣chant of his country, he merits, as well as his father, a title more glorious than that of king— <HI>the friend of mankind.</HI></P>
<P>How different such men from those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>quer∣ers so celebrated, who amaze and desolate the earth; who, abusing the right of conquest, have established laws, which, even after the world has been delivered from these tyrants, has perpetuated for ages, the miseries of the human race.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>Camboya and Tsiampa.</HEAD>
<P>To the northward of Ponthiamas we find the countries of Camboya and Tsiampa. They are naturally fertile, (Camboya in particular) and appear in former times, to have been well culti∣vated; but the government of these two little states, having no settled form, the inhabitants be∣ing perpetually employed in destroying tyrants, only to receive others in their place, have aban∣doned the culture of their grounds. Their fields, which might be covered with rice, with herds, and with flocks, are deserts; and the natives are reduced to feed on a few wretched roots, which they gather from amidst the brambles, which overspread their lands.</P>
<P>Travellers are surprised to find, at a little dis∣tance from the wretched canton of Camboya, the ruins of an old city, built with stone, the architec∣ture
<PB N="53" REF="032696_0027_0FF4293A52F4B8E0"/>
of which has some resemblance to that of Europe. The neighboring fields too still preserve the traces of ridges: every thing shews that agri∣culture and the other arts have once flourished there; but they have now disappeared, with the nation who cultivated them. Those who at pre∣sent inhabit this country have no history, no tradi∣tion even, which can throw the faintest light upon the subject.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>COCHIN-CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>The Cochin-chinese, who border on Camboya to the north, observing the lands of this kingdom desolate and abandoned, some years ago took possession of such tracks as were most conveneient, and have there introduced an excellent culture. The province of Donnay, usurped in this manner from Camboya, is at present the granary of Co∣chin-china. This kingdom, one of the greatest in Eastern Asia, about one hundred and fifty years ago, was inhabited by an inconsiderable nation, barbarous and savage, known by the name of <HI>Loi,</HI> who, living partly by fishing, partly on roots, and the wild fruits of the country, paid lit∣tle regard to agriculture.</P>
<P>A Tonquinese prince, unsuccessful in a war he carried on against the king of Tonquin (under whom he enjoyed an office somewhat resembling the maires de palais, under the Merovingian race of the kings of France) retired with his soldiers and adherents across the river which divides that
<PB N="54" REF="032696_0028_0FF4313913A15848"/>
kingdom from▪ Cochin-china. The savages who then possessed this country, fled before these strangers, and took refuge among the mountains of Tsiampa. After a long war with their old ene∣mies, who pursued them, the Tonquinese fugi∣tives remained at length peaceable possessors of the country known under the name of Cochin-china: it extends about two hundred leagues from north to south, but narrow and unequal from east to west. They then applied themselves entirely to the cultivation of rice, which, being the ordinary food of the inhabitants of Asia, is to them an object of the greatest importance. They separated into little cantonments, and established themselves on the plains, which extend along the banks of the river.</P>
<P>The fertility of the soil, which had lain long uncultivated, soon recompensed their labors by abundance; population increased in proportion to the culture; and their cantons extended in such a manner, that all the plains of this vast country being put into a state of improvement, they were tempted to make encroachments on those of Cam∣boya, which were in a manner totally abandoned. I never saw any country where the progress of population was so remarkable as in Cochin-china, which must be attributed not only to the climate, and the fertility of the soil, but to the simplicity of their manners, to the prudence and industry of the women as well as the men, and to the variety of excellent fish, which, with rice, is their ordina∣ry food.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<PB N="55" REF="032696_0028_0FF4313913A15848"/>
<HEAD>Culture of different Kinds of Rice in Cochin-China.</HEAD>
<P>The Cochin-chinese cultivate six different kinds of rice: the <HI>Little Rice,</HI> the grain of which is small, oblong and transparent; this is by far the most delicate; it is generally administered to the sick: the <HI>Great Long Rice</HI> is that whose form is round: the <HI>Red Rice,</HI> so called because the grain is enveloped in a husk of a reddish color, which adheres so closely, that it requires a very uncom∣mon operation to separate it. These three kinds are produced in the greatest abundance, and form the principal subsistence of the natives. They require water, it being necessary to overflow the grounds where they are cultivated.</P>
<P>They raise also two other sorts of dry rice, which grow in dry soils, and like our wheat, re∣quire no other watering but what they receive from the clouds. One of these species of rice has a grain as white as snow; when dressed it is of a slimy viscous substance; they make of it different kinds of paste, such as vermicelli. Both these kinds form a considerable article in their com∣merce to China. They cultivate them only on the mountains and rising grounds, which they labor with the spade. They sow these grains as we do wheat, about the end of December or be∣ginning of January, when the rainy season ends: they are not above three months in the ground and yield a plentiful crop.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="032696_0029_0FF4313D09D2A218"/>I am induced to believe, that the culture of this valuable grain would succeed extremely well in France. In the years 1749 and 1750, I often travelled over the mountains of Cochin-china, where this rice is cultivated; they are very high and the temperature of the air cold; in the month of January, 1750, I observed that the rice was very green, and above three inches high, altho' the liquor in Reaumur's thermometer was only about four degrees above the freezing point.</P>
<P>I carried some quintals of this grain to the Isle of France, where it was sown with success, and produced a greater crop than any other species. The colonists received my present with the great∣est eagerness, as, exclusive of its superior increase, it has a finer taste, is attended with less trouble, there being no necessity for overflowing the fields; and, as it ripens fifteen or twenty days sooner than the other kinds, it can be reaped and secured before the hurricane season, which fre∣quently makes dreadful havock with their latter harvests. The other kinds of rice, being of a slower growth, require their grounds to be laid under water, after the manner of the natives of the Coromandel coast; but our colonists pay so little attention to agriculture, that they have never hitherto introduced it.</P>
<P>One might have imagined, that the advanta∣ges flowing from the cultivation of dry rice, would have engaged the colonists to attend to it with the greatest care; and that, from the Isle of
<PB N="57" REF="032696_0029_0FF4313D09D2A218"/>
France, it might have been with ease introduced into Europe: but I have in vain endeavored to procure it from this island; those to whom I have applied, have sent me only common rice, which demands water and warmth. The culture of dry rice has, like every other species of agricul∣ture, been abandoned to the unexperienced igno∣rance of slaves, who have mixed all the different kinds together, in such a manner, that the rice of Cochin-china being ripe long before the others, the grains have dropt from the ears before they were reaped, and the species, in this manner, has been by degrees, entirely lost in that island. Would any traveller, whom business or curiosity might lead to Cochin-china, send over but a few pounds of this excellent grain, he would deserve our warmest acknowledgments.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chinese cultivate the common rice nearly in the same manner with the Malabars on the Coromandel coast.—After having twice ploughed their ground, they sow the rice in a lit∣tle field which has been well labored with the spade; the surface of this little field they just cover with water, to the height only of a few lines; and as soon as the rice is about five or six inches high, they harrow over their large fields, and overflow them with water; then pulling up the rice-plants in the seed-plots, transplant them into these grounds, thus prepared, in small par∣cels of four or five stalks, about the distance of six inches the one from the other. Women and children are generally employed in this work.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="032696_0030_0FF4293E08626C60"/>The Cochin-chinese have no machine for over∣flowing their grounds, nor have they any occa∣sion: their plains, from one end of the kingdom to the other, are commanded by a chain of high mountains, plentifully supplied with springs and rivulets, which naturally overflow the grounds, according as their course is directed.</P>
<P>They cultivate likewise different kinds of grain, such as the mahis millets of different sorts, seve∣ral species of the French bean, potatoes, yams, and a variety of roots proper for the subsistence of men and animals. But the culture of most im∣portant advantage to them, next to the rice, is the sugar-cane; and no country in Asia produces it in greater abundance than Cochin-china.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Sugar-Canes.</HEAD>
<P>The sugar-canes of this country are of two kinds; the first grows thick and tall, the joints at a considerable distance from one another, the color always green, the juice abundant, with very little of the salt in it. This species of cane is in general use for feeding and fattening of cattle; and experience teaches them, that no kind of food fattens sooner or better the human species, as well as animals, than this sugar-cane, eat while green, and the sugar which is extracted from it.</P>
<P>The second species is smaller in every respect, with its joints approaching nearer together: when ripe it assumes a yellow color; and contains less water and more salt than the other.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="032696_0030_0FF4293E08626C60"/>The Cochin-chinese, when preparing the ground for the sugar-cane, turn it up to the depth of two feet; this operation is performed with a plank. They then plant joints or eyes of the cane, three and three together, in a horizontal position, in the same manner almost as they plant vines in several provinces of France. These slips are planted chequer-wise about eighteen inches deep in the ground, distant six feet from one ano∣ther; this operation they perform near the end of the rainy season, in order that the slips may be sufficiently watered, till such time as they have taken root. During the first six months, they give them two dressings with a kind of pick-axe, in order to destroy the weeds, and preserve a moi∣sture about the roots of the canes, by heaping the earth around them.</P>
<P>Twelve, and sometimes fourteen, months after the plantation, they gather the first crop. By this time the canes, though planted at the distance of six feet, become so bushy that it is impossible to enter the field, without the assistance of a hatch∣et to clear your way.</P>
<P>The canes being cut, and tied up into bundles, are carried to the mills, in order to extract their juice. I shall not here describe the form of these machines, which resemble in a great measure those of the West-Indies; instead of water, they em∣ploy horned cattle or mules to set in motion the two cylinders, between which the sugar-canes are pres∣sed.
<PB N="60" REF="032696_0031_0FF4313F6F28F7B0"/>
These engines have been described by num∣bers of travellers.</P>
<P>The juice being extracted, they boil it some hours in large kettles, in order to evaporate part of its water: it is then transported to the neigh∣boring market, and sold in that condition. Here ends the industry and the profits of the Cochin-chinese planter. The merchants purchase the juice, which resembles pure water; they boil it again, throwing into the kettles some alkaline substance, such as the ashes of the leaves of the musia or bananier, and shell-lime; they are ac∣quainted with no other; these ingredients throw up a thick scum, which the refiner carefully skims off, the action of the alkali hastens the separation of the salt from the water, and by the force of ebullition, reduces the juice of the cane to the consistence of syrup. As soon as this syrup be∣gins to granulate, they decant it into a great earthen vessel, where they cool it about an hour; when a kind of crust, still soft, and of a yellowish color, appears on the surface of the syrup; they lose not a moment then to empty it into a vessel of a conic shape, which they call a <HI>form.</HI> With∣out this intermediate operation of cooling the syrup, it would harden into a mass, and not being granulated, would consequently want one essen∣tial quality of sugar.</P>
<P>These sugar-cones, or forms, in Cochin-china, are, like those of our West-India colonies, of bak∣ed earth, about three feet high, pierced at their
<PB N="61" REF="032696_0031_0FF4313F6F28F7B0"/>
narrow extremities, and contain in general about forty or fifty pounds of sugar. These <HI>forms,</HI> when full, are placed on another earthen vessel, the mouth of which is proportioned to receive the narrow end of the cone, and must be large enough to contain the coarse syrup, which distils from the sugar, through some straw which imperfectly stops up the little opening in the bottom of the <HI>form.</HI></P>
<P>When they suppose the syrup has acquired the consistence of salt in every part of the cone, they then proceed to whiten and purify it. They di∣lute in a trough a fine sort of whitish clay, with such a quantity of water as, when thus prepared, prevents it from having too much consistence; with a trowel they then lay it upon the surface of the sugar to the thickness of about two inches in the void space left at the top of the form by the condensing of the sugar, after purging itself of the coarser syrup or molasses. The water con∣tained in the clay penetrating by degrees into the mass, washes it, and carries off insensibly the re∣maining syrup, and every foreign particle that adheres most closely to the sugar. When the clay hardens, they replace it with a fresh quanti∣ty, diluted as the first: this operation, which lasts about twelve or fifteen days, is the same here as in our West-India colonies. Some refin∣ers of Cochin-china, however, have another method. In place of clay, tempered thus with wa∣ter, they cut into small pieces the trunk of the mu∣sa or bananier, which they place upon the sugar:
<PB N="62" REF="032696_0032_0FF431425DA6DDB8"/>
the trunk of this tree is very watery; the water of a detergent quality; and distils from the fibres which envelope it, in very small drops. Those who follow this method pretend, that the oper∣ation is thereby rendered less tedious, and that the sugar acquires a finer color.</P>
<P>The process of the Cochin-chinese, in refining their sugar, goes no further: they are unac∣quainted with the stoves in use in the West-Ind∣ies. After having clayed their sugars sufficient∣ly, they sell them in the public markets, particu∣larly to the Chinese, and other strangers, who are invited to their ports by the moderate price of this commodity, which is cheaper at Cochin-china than any where in India.</P>
<P>The white sugar of the best quality is general∣ly sold at the port of Faiso, in exchange for oth∣er merchandise, at the rate of three piasters (about fourteen shillings) the Cochin-china quin∣tal, which weighs from one hundred and fifty, to two hundred pounds French<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ninety-one pounds eight ounces French, make one hundred pounds English.</NOTE>. The trade in this commodity is immense. The Chinese alone, whose lands do not produce enough for their own consumpt, purchase annually from Cochin-china above forty thousand barrels, weighing about two thousand pounds per barrel.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="032696_0032_0FF431425DA6DDB8"/>This country, it should be observed, which produces this commodity in such abundance, and at so low a price, being a new kingdom, ought to be considered, in some measure, as a colony: it is worthy observation too, that the sugar-cane is there cultivated by free men, and all the pro∣cess of preparation and refining, the work of free hands. Compare then the price of the Cochin-chinese production with the same commodity which is cultivated and prepared by the wretch∣ed slaves of our European colonies, and judge if, to procure sugar from our colonies, it was neces∣sary to authorise by law the slavery of the unhap∣py Africans transported to America. From what I have observed at Cochin-china, I cannot enter∣tain a doubt, but that our West-India colonies, had they been distributed without reservation amongst a free people, would have produced dou∣ble the quantity that is now procured from the la∣bor of the unfortunate negroes.</P>
<P>What advantage then has accrued to Europe, civilized as it is, and thoroughly versed in the laws of nature, and the rights of mankind, by le∣gally authorising in our colonies the daily out∣rages against human nature, permitting them to debase man almost below the level of the beasts of the field? These slavish laws have proved as opposite to its interest as they are to its honor, and to the laws of humanity. This remark I have often made. Liberty and property form the basis of abundance, and good agriculture: I never observed it to flourish where those rights of
<PB N="64" REF="032696_0033_0FF4314564DB0F00"/>
mankind were not firmly established. The earth, which multiplies her productions with a kind of pro∣fusion, under the hands of the free-born laborer, seems to shrink into barrenness under the sweat of the slave. Such is the will of the great Author of our nature, who has created man free, and as∣signed to him the earth, that he might cultivate his possession with the sweat of his brow; but still should enjoy his liberty.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chinese, exclusive of the sugar-cane, employ themselves in the culture of a vari∣ety of other productions, of great importance both to their interior fabrics, and external com∣mercce.</P>
<P>They cultivate the cotton-tree, the mulberry, the pepper, the varnish-tree, the date, the tea, the in∣digo, and the saffron, together with a plant pecu∣liar to the country, called <HI>Tsai,</HI> which being fer∣mented like indigo, furnishes in great plenty a flower of a green color, which, in dying, gives a durable tincture of a fine emerald color. This plant would undoubtedly be a most valuable pre∣sent to our West-India colonies.</P>
<P>I must at present decline entering into a de∣scription of the various processes attending these different cultures. They will afford subject for some future memoirs.</P>
<P>The soil, in general, of Cochin-china, is excel∣lent, and they cultivate it well. Their mountains
<PB N="65" REF="032696_0033_0FF4314564DB0F00"/>
in general are fallow, as population is not even sufficiently considerable for the cultivation of all the plain grounds they have taken possession of in Camboya: these mountains produce, however, the eagle or aloes-wood, which is the most pre∣cious perfume in the world; the sapan-wood, the same with that of Brasil; and the cinnamon, in small quantities indeed, but much superior in quality to that of Ceylon. The Chinese pay three or four times more for it than for that which the Dutch import from that island. They have sev∣eral sorts likewise of admirable wood for joiner and cabinet-work, particularly the rose-wood; the tea-wood is excellent for building, and is pre∣ferred to all others in the construction of the royal galleys, having every property that can be wished for, either for beauty or solidity. From their mountains also, and from the forests with which they are covered, they procure ivory, musk, wax, iron and gold in great abundance. These moun∣tains too are full of game, such as deer, antelopes, wild goats, peacocks; pheasants, &amp;c. The chace is free to all, but dangerous from the number of tygers, elephants, rhinoceros, and other carnivo∣rous and destructive animals, with which the for∣ests abound.</P>
<P>The sea, which washes their coasts, as well as the rivers, are well supplied with excellent fish. Every one has the liberty of fishing; and in this the Cochin-chinese take great delight. I have already observed, that they live chiefly on fish and rice.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="032696_0034_0FF42943D34E2B50"/>Their domestic animals are, the horse for the road, the buffalo for labor, and the cow, the hog, the goat, the goose, the duck, and hens of vari∣ous kinds, for the table. These animals thrive extremely well, and are in great abundance. The king alone reserves to himself the exclusive right of breeding elephants for the war; and this is a reservation which no man envies him. He main∣tains generally four hundred of them; he could maintain four thousand men at a much less ex∣pense. The Cochin-chinese have few good fruits; the pine-apple, and oranges of different kinds, are the best their country produces. They do not cultivate the vine, though it is one of the native productions of their lands. They are but indifferently provided with pulse. In a word, their orchards and their gardens are very incon∣siderable. They attach themselves to the more essential branches of agriculture.</P>
<P>Although this art is not yet arrived at that de∣gree of perfection in Cochin-china, to which it might be carried, with the advantage of such an excellent soil, yet the manners of the people being very favorable, it flourishes greatly.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chinese are gentle, hospital, fru∣gal, and industrious. There is not a beggar in the country; and robbery and murder absolutely unknown. A stranger may wander over the kingdom, from one end to another (the capital ex∣cepted) without meeting the slightest insult: he will be every where received with a most eager

curiosity, but, at the same time, with great bene∣volence. I have here remarked a custom singu∣lar indeed, but expressive of their goodness of heart. A Cochin-chinese traveller, who has not money sufficient to defray his expenses at an inn, enters the first house of the town or village he arrives at: no body inquires his business; he speaks to none, but waits in silence the hour of dinner; so soon as the rice is served up, he mod∣estly approaches, places himself at table along with the family, eats, drinks, and departs, with∣out pronouncing a single word, or any person's putting to him a single question: it was enough they saw he was a man, a brother in distress; they asked no further information.</P>
<P>The six first kings, founders of this monarchy, governed the nation as a father governs his family; they established the laws of nature alone; they themselves paid the first obedience to them. Chiefs of an immense family of laborers, they gave the first example of labor; they honored and encouraged agriculture, as the most useful and honorable employment of mankind. They re∣quired from their subjects only a small annual free-gift, to defray the expense of their defensive war against their Tonquinese enemies.</P>
<P>This imposition was regulated, by way of poll∣tax, with the greatest equity. Every man, able to labor the ground, paid into the magistrate, on account of the prince, a small sum proportioned to the strength of his constitution, and the vigor of
<PB N="68" REF="032696_0035_0FF43146E8EF9188"/>
his arm; and nothing more. It was under their reign, that this nation multiplied so surprisingly, in consequence of the plenty furnished by the cul∣ture of their fields. Whilst they reigned, the treaties entered into on the banks of the river, which separates Tonquin from Cochin-china, be∣tween the chiefs of their family and those who followed them in their retreat, were most reli∣giously observed. It is to this reciprocal fidelity that Cochin-china owes its present flourishing state with regard to power, population and agriculture. Their successor, who now reigns, inherits their goodness of heart, but has the weakness to suffer himself to be governed by his slaves. These have acquired the art of separating the interest of the prince from that of his people. They have inspired him with the thirst after personal riches. The vast quantity of gold which they have dug from the mines, during this reign, has already proved detrimental to industry and agriculture. In the palace it has been productive of luxury and corruption, its never-failing attendants.</P>
<P>This prince has been insensibly led to despise the simple habitations of his ancestors. He has built a superb palace, a league in circumference, surrounded by a wall of brick, on the model of that of Pekin. Sixteen hundred pieces of cannon, mounted around the palace, announce to the peo∣ple the approaching loss of their liberties and rights.</P>
<P>He found a necessity too for a winter palace,
<PB N="69" REF="032696_0035_0FF43146E8EF9188"/>
a summer palace, and an autumn palace. The old taxes were by no means sufficient to defray these expenses; they were augmented; and new impositions devised, which, being no longer vol∣untary contributions, could not be levied but by force, and tyrannical oppression. His courtiers, who found their interest in the corruption of their prince, have given him the title of <HI>King of Hea∣ven: Vous Tsoi,</HI> hearing himself often so stiled, at length thought he might assume it—"Why," addressing himself one day to me, "don't you come oftener to pay your court to the <HI>King of Heaven?</HI>"</P>
<P>These designing sycophants, who guard every avenue to the royal ear, have had the address to over-awe the ordinary administration of justice; and, taking advantage of exemption from pun∣ishment, have pillaged the laborers, and filled the provinces with oppression and distress.</P>
<P>All along the high roads I have seen whole vil∣lages newly abandoned by their inhabitants, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦rassed by fruitless toil, and never-ending exac∣tions, and their fields, in consequence, falling back to their first uncultivated state.</P>
<P>In the midst of all this growing disorder, the prince, whole mind has been surprised by fawn∣ing flatterers, and who alone is ignorant of the villany of those around him, still preserves a re∣pect for the manners of his ancestors; he does not indeed, like his forefathers, give an example
<PB N="70" REF="032696_0036_0FF4314BA745AA48"/>
of personal labor, but still his desire is to protect agriculture.</P>
<P>I have seen him, at the commencement of the new year, preside, with all the simplicity of his predecessors, at the general assembly of the nation, which is annually held on that day, in the open field, in order to renew the reciprocal oath for observation of the primordial contract, which established him father of his people, at the same time that they invested him alone with the pow∣er, the noblest indeed of all, of making his people happy.</P>
<P>When he speaks of his subjects, he calls them still by no other name than that of his children. I have seen him too assist, like a simple individual, in the annual assembly of his family, according to the ancient usage of the nation; an assembly where the most aged always preside, without re∣gard to the dignities of those of younger years. This, however, seemed to me only a formality <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>erable from custom; for what is man where the <HI>King of Heaven</HI> appears?</P>
<P>Corruption, it is true, has not yet infected the general body of the people; they still preserve their primitive manners: it is hitherto confined to the palace, and the capital: its source, how∣ever, is too elevated to prevent its poisoned streams from flowing to the plains. It is from the great that the corruption of a people ever de∣rives its origin.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="032696_0036_0FF4314BA745AA48"/>When it shall have infected every rank; when the foundations of agriculture, liberty and pro∣perty, already attacked by the great, shall be overthrown; when the profession of the far∣mer shall become the most contemptible, and the least lucrative, what must be the fate of agriculture? without a flourishing agriculture what must be the fate of those multitudes, foster∣ed under its wing?—what must be the fate of prince and people?—it will resemble that of the nation who possessed the country before them; perhaps that of the savages, who yielded it to that nation: of them there are no remains, but the ruins of an immense wall, near the capital, which appears to have been part of a great city: it is of brick, and of a form very different from what is to be seen in the other countries of Asia: no history, however, no tradition has preserved the memory of the builders.</P>
<P>Upon the whole I conclude, from the general corruption which threatens the manners of the Cochin-chinese, that agriculture is on the decline, and that whatever efforts they may make to sup∣port it, it has now passed its meridian, and must infallibly degenerate.</P>

<HEAD>CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>I now approach the period of my travels. De∣parting from the coasts of Cochin-china, and di∣recting my course towards the north-east, I pro∣ceeded for China, which the Cochin-chinese call,
<PB N="72" REF="032696_0037_0FF4314E1AAD6438"/>
with great respect, <HI>Nuse d'ai Ming—the kingdom of the great Luminary.</HI> After some days naviga∣tion, before there was any appearance of land, I perceived along the horizon a forest of masts, and soon after an innumerable multitude of boats, which covered the surface of the water. These were thousands of fishermen, whose indus∣try drew from the deeps subsistence for numbers. The land now began to rise to my view; I ad∣vanced to the mouth of the river, still amidst crowds of fishers, throwing out their lines on eve∣ry side. I entered the river of Canton; it is peo∣pled like the land; its banks lined with ships at anchor; a prodigious number of small craft are continually gliding along in every direction, some with sails, others with oars, vanishing often sud∣denly from the sight, as they enter the number∣less canals dug with amazing labor, across exten∣sive plains, which they water and fertilize. Im∣mense fields, covered with all the glory of the harvest, with stately villages rising to the eye on every side, adorn the remoter view, whilst moun∣tains, covered with verdure, cut into terrasses, and shaped into amphitheatres, form the back ground of this noble landscape.</P>
<P>I arrive at Canton, where new subjects for ad∣miration arise; the noise, the motion, the croud augments; the water, as well as land, being eve∣ry where covered with multitudes. Astonished at the amazing appearance, I inquire into the num∣bers of inhabitants of this city, and suburbs; and after comparing different accounts, find that they
<PB N="73" REF="032696_0037_0FF4314E1AAD6438"/>
must amount at least to eight hundred thousand souls. My surprise, however, is greatly increas∣ed, when I learn, that to the northward of Can∣ton, about five leagues up the river, is a village named <HI>Fachan,</HI> which contains a million of in∣habitants, and that every part of this great em∣pire, extending about six hundred leagues from north to south, and as much from east to west, was peopled in the same proportion.</P>
<P>By what art can the earth produce subsistence for such numbers? do the Chinese possess any se∣cret art of multiplying the grain and provisions necessary for the nourishment of mankind? To solve my doubts I traversed the fields, I introdu∣ced myself among the laborers, who are in gener∣al, easy, polite and affable, with some share of learning, and knowledge of the world. I exam∣ine, and pursue them through all their operations, and observe that their secret consists simply in manuring their fields judiciously, ploughing them to a considerable depth, sowing them in the pro∣per season, turning to advantage every inch of ground which can produce the most inconsidera∣ble crop, and preferring to every other species of culture that of grain, as by far the most impor∣tant.</P>
<P>This system of culture, the last article except∣ed, appears to be the same that is recommended in all our best authors, ancient and modern, who have wrote on this subject; our common labor∣ers are acquainted with it; but how much must
<PB N="74" REF="032696_0038_0FF4314F9E3D8FD8"/>
our European farmers be surprised, when they are informed, that the Chinese have no meadows, na∣tural nor artificial, and have not the least concep∣tion of fallowing, never allowing their lands the slightest repose.</P>
<P>The Chinese laborer would consider meadows, of every denomination, as lands in a state of na∣ture; they sow their lands all with grain, and give the preference to such grounds as we gen∣erally lay out in meadows, which, lying low, and being properly situated with respect to water, are consequently by far the most fertile. They affirm, that a field sown with grain, will yield as much straw for the nourishment of cattle, as it would have produced of hay, besides the addi∣tional advantage of the grain for the sustenance of man, of which they can spare too, in plentiful seasons, a small portion for the animal crea∣tion.</P>
<P>Such is the system adhered to from one extrem∣ity of their empire to the other, and confirmed by the experience of four thousand years, amongst a people, of all the nations in the world, the most attentive to their interest.</P>
<P>That which must render this plan of agricul∣ture the more inconceivable to Europeans, is the idea of their never allowing their lands to lie one season unlabored. Those who for some years have endeavored, with such public-spirited zeal, to re∣animate amongst us this neglected art, have consid∣ered
<PB N="75" REF="032696_0038_0FF4314F9E3D8FD8"/>
as the first and most important object, the mul∣tiplication of artificial meadows, to supply the de∣fect of natural ones, for the fattening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cattle; without once venturing to think of suppressing the mode of fallowing the grounds, however far they carried their system of increasing the number of artificial pastures.</P>
<P>This system, which appears the most plausible of any they have projected, and is received with the greatest partiality by our farmers, is, never∣theless, contradicted by the constant experience of the greatest and the most ancient land laboring nation in the world, who regard the practice of meadows, and fallowing grounds, as an abuse, destructive of plenty and population, which are the only important objects of agriculture.</P>
<P>A Chinese laborer could not but smile, if you informed him, that the earth has occasion for re∣pose at a certain fixed period of time: he certainly would say, that we deviated greatly from the point in view, could he read our treatises ancient and modern, our marvellous speculations on agri∣culture: what would he say, if he saw our lands, part of them fallow, part of them employod in useless cultures, and the remainder wretchedly labored? What would he say, what must be his feelings, if, in travelling over our fields, he ob∣served the extreme misery and barbarism of their wretched cultivators?</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="032696_0039_0FF431538AAC2998"/>The Chinese lands, in general, are not superi∣or to ours: you see there, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with us, some ex∣celle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds, others midd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng, the rest bad; some soils strong, others light; lands where clay, and lands where sand, gravel, and flints every were predominate.</P>
<P>All these grounds, even in the northern provin∣ces, yield annually two crops, and in those to∣wards the south often five in two years, without one single fallow season, during the many thou∣sands of years that they have been converted to the purposes of agriculture.</P>
<P>The Chinese use the same manures as we do, in order to restore to their grounds those salts and juices, which an unintermitting production is perpetually consuming. They are acquainted with marl; they employ also common salt, lime, ashes, and all sorts of animal dung, but above all that which we throw into our rivers: they make great use of urine, which is carefully preserved in every house, and sold to advantage: in a word, every thing produced by the earth is re∣conveyed to it with the greatest care, into what∣ever shape the operations of nature or art may have transformed it.</P>
<P>When their manures are at any time scarce, they supply the deficiency, by turning up the ground, with the spade, to a great depth, which brings up to the surface of the field a new soil, enriched with the juices of that which descends in its room.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="032696_0039_0FF431538AAC2998"/>Without meadows the Chinese maintain a num∣ber of horses, buffaloes, and other animals of ev∣ery species necessary for labor, for sustenance, and for manure. These animals are fed, some with straw, others with roots, beans, and grain of ev∣ery kind. It is true, they have fewer horses, and horned cattle, in proportion, than we have, yet it is not necessary they should have more.</P>
<P>The whole country is cut into canals, dug by the industry of the inhabitants, extending from river to river, which divide and water this vast empire, like a garden. Travelling, trans∣porting of goods, almost every species of car∣riage is performed on these canals, with great ease, and small expense: they don't even use horses to drag their boats; every thing is done by the sail or the oar, which they manage with singular dexterity, even in going up the rivers. Where any kind of labor can be performed, at a moderate price by men, it is a maxim with them never to employ animals. In consequence of this, the banks of their canals, are cultivated al∣most to the water's edge; they lose not an inch of ground: their public roads resemble our foot paths; their canals, however, are infinitely more useful than high ways: they convey fertility ev∣ery where, and furnish the people great part of their subsistence in fish.—There is no comparison between the weight which can be transported in a boat, and that which can be conveyed by any kind of land-carriage; no proportion between the expense.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="032696_0040_0FF429455CAE8780"/>The Chinese are still less acquainted with the use, or rather the luxury of chariots, and equi∣pages of every kind, which crowd the principal ci∣ties of Europe. The horses necessary for these, assembled in thousands in our capitals, consume the produce of numberless acres of our best grounds, which, if cultivated with grain, would afford subsistence for multitudes, who are dying of hunger. The Chinese wish rather to maintain men than horses.</P>
<P>The emperor and chief magistrates are carried through the cities by men, with safety, and with dignity; their march is sedate and majestic, it threatens not with danger those who walk on foot: they travel in a kind of galleys, safer, more commodious, equally magnificient, and less ex∣pensive than our land equipages.</P>
<P>I have before observed, that the Chinese lose not an inch of ground. They are very far, therefore, from alloting immense parks, of the finest ground, for the maintenance alone of deer, in contempt of the human race. The emperors, even those of the Tartar line, have never hither∣to dreamed of forming these parks; still less the grandees, that is, the magistrates and the learned: such an idea could never find place in the mind of a Chinese. Even their country houses, and boxes of pleasure, present nothing to the eye all around, but useful cultures, agreeably diversified. That which constitutes their principal beauty, is their delightful situation, judiciously improved,
<PB N="79" REF="032696_0040_0FF429455CAE8780"/>
where, in the disposition of the various parts which form the whole, there every where reigns a happy imitation of that beautiful order of nature, from whence art has borrowed all her charms.</P>
<P>The most rocky hills, which, in France, and other places of Europe, they turn into vineyards, or totally neglect, are there compelled, by dint of industry, to produce grain. The Chinese are acquainted, indeed, with the vine, which here and there they plant in arbors; but they consider it as a luxury, and the wine it produces as an un∣necessary superfluity: they would imagine it a sin against humanity, to endeavor to procure, by cultivation, an agreeable liquor, whilst, from the want of that grain which this vineyard might have produced, some individual perhaps might be in danger of perishing of hunger.</P>
<P>The steepest mountains, even, are rendered ac∣cessible: at Canton, and from one extremity of the empire to another, you observe mountains cut into terrasses, representing, at a distance, im∣mense pyramids divided into different stages, which seem to rear their heads to heaven. Eve∣ry one of these terrasses yields annually a crop of some kind of grain, even of rice; and you cannot with-hold your admiration, when you behold the water of the river, the canal, or the fountain, which glides by the foot of the mountain, rais∣ed from terrass to terrass, even to the summit, by means of a simple portable machine, which two men with ease transport and put in motion.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="032696_0041_0FF43155AC67A530"/>The sea itself, which seems to threaten the sol∣id globe it surrounds, has been compelled, by in∣dustry and labor, to yield part of its dominions to the Chinese cultivator.</P>
<P>The two finest provinces of the empire, Nan-king and Tche-kiang, formerly covered with wa∣ter, have been united to the continent some thou∣sands of years ago, with an art infinitely superior to that which is so much admired in the modern works of Holland.</P>
<P>The Chinese had to struggle with a sea, whose natural flux from east to west urges it continual∣ly towards the coasts of these two provinces; whilst the Dutch have had nothing to oppose but a sea, which by the same natural motion, always avoids their western shores.</P>
<P>The Chinese nation is capable of the most stu∣pendous works; in point of labor I never observ∣ed their equals in the world. Every day in the year is a working day, except the first, destined for paying reciprocal visits, and the last which is consecrated to the ceremonial duties they pay to their ancestors.</P>
<P>An idle man would be treated with the most sovereign contempt and regarded as a paralytic member, a load to the body of which he made a part; the government would in no manner per∣mit it. How opposite from the ideas of other Asiatics, where none are admitted to any degree
<PB N="81" REF="032696_0041_0FF43155AC67A530"/>
of estimation, but those who, from their situation in life, have nothing to do!— An ancient empe∣ror of China, in a public instruction, exhorting the people to labor, observed, that if in one cor∣ner of the empire there was one man who did no∣thing, there must, in some other quarter, be an∣other who suffers on that account, deprived of the necessaries of life. This wise maxim is fixed in the breast of every Chinese; and, with this people so open to reason, he who pronounces a wise max∣im pronounces a law.</P>
<P>Behold, gentlemen, a slight sketch of the gen∣eral picture of Chinese agriculture, with the pe∣culiar genius of that people for this art. The limits of my discourse will not permit me at pre∣sent to enter into a detail of the different cul∣tures I have seen in this country: I shall only ob∣serve, that they are such as abundantly supply all the wants, and conveniences of the most populous nation in the world, and furnish, with their su∣perfluity, an important article for foreign com∣merce.</P>
<P>From these observations it is obvious, that agriculture flourishes in China more than in any other country in the world: yet it is not to any process peculiar to their labor, it is not to the form of their plough, or their method of sowing, that this happy state, and the plenty consequent on it, is to be attributed; it must chiefly be de∣rived from their mode of government, the im∣moveable foundations of which have been laid
<PB N="82" REF="032696_0042_0FF431572F475CF0"/>
deep, by the hand of reason alone, coeval almost with the beginning of time; and from their laws, dictated by nature to the first of the human race, and sacredly preserved from generation to gener∣ation, engraved in the united hearts of a great people, not in obscure codes, devised by chicane∣ry and deceit.—In a word, China owes the pros∣perity of her agriculture to the simplicity of her manners, and to her laws, which are the laws of nature and reason.</P>
<P>This empire was founded by laborers, in those happy times when the laws of the great Creator were still held in remembrance, and the culture of the earth considered as the noblest of all em∣ployments, the most worthy of mankind, and the general occupation of all. From <HI>Fou-hi</HI> (who was the first chief of this nation, some hundreds of years after the deluge, if we follow the version of the Septuagint, and in this quality presided over agriculture) all the emperors, without exception, even to this day, glory in being the first laborers of their empire.</P>
<P>The Chinese history has carefully preserved an anecdote of generosity in two of the ancient emperors, who, not perceiving among their chil∣dren any one worthy to mount a throne, which virtue alone ought to inherit, named, as their suc∣cessors, two simple laborers. These laborers, ac∣cording to the Chinese annals, advanced the hap∣piness of mankind, during very long reigns; their memory is still held in the highest veneration.
<PB N="83" REF="032696_0042_0FF431572F475CF0"/>
It is unnecessary to observe how much examples, such as these, honor and animate agriculture.</P>
<P>The Chinese nation has ever been governed like a family, of which the emperor is father: his subjects are his children, without any other inequality but that which established by talents, and by merit. Those puerile distinctions of <HI>no∣blesse,</HI> and <HI>plebeians, men of family,</HI> and <HI>men of mean birth,</HI> are no where to be found but in the jargon of new people, still barbarous, who, hav∣ing forgot the common origin of all men, insult without reflection, and debase the whole human race; whilst that nation whose government is an∣cient, dating its commencement with the first ages of the world, are sensible that all men are born equal, all brothers, all noble. Their lan∣guage has not even hitherto invented a term for ex∣pressing this pretended distinction of birth. The Chinese, who have preserved their annals from the remotest times, and who are all equally the children of the emperor, have never so much as suspected an inequality of origin amongst them.</P>
<P>From this principle, that the emperor is father, and the people his children, spring all the duties of society, all the duties of morality, every virtue of humanity, the union of every wish for the common good of the family, consequently an attachment to labor, and above all to agriculture.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="032696_0043_0FF4315A20D939B8"/>This art is honored, protected, and practised by the emperor, and the great magistrates, who generally are the sons of plain laboring men, whom merit has raised to the first dignities of the empire; and, in a word, by the whole nation, who have the good sense to honor an art the most useful to mankind, in preference to others more frivolous, and less important.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Ceremony of opening the Grounds.</HEAD>
<P>On the fifteenth day of the first moon, in every year, which generally corresponds to the begin∣ning of March, the emperor in person performs the ceremony of opening the grounds. This prince, in great pomp, proceeds to the field ap∣pointed for the ceremony: the princes of the im∣perial family, the presidents of the five great tri∣bunals, and an infinite number of madarius accom∣pany him. Two sides of the field are occupied by the emperor's officers, and guards; the third is allotted for all the laborers of the province, who repair thither to behold their art honored and practised by the head of their empire, the fourth is reserved for the mandarins.</P>
<P>The emperor enters the field alone, prostrates himself, and nine times strikes his head against the ground, in adoration of <HI>Tien,</HI> the GOD of heaven; he pronounces, with a loud voice, a prayer ap∣pointed by the tribunal of rites, invoking the blessing of the Almighty Sovereign on his labor and on the labor of his people, who form his fam∣ily;
<PB N="85" REF="032696_0043_0FF4315A20D939B8"/>
he then, in quality of sovereign pontiff of the empire, sacrifices a bullock, which he offers up to heaven, as the source of every blessing: whilst they cut the victim in pieces, and place them on the altar, they bring to the emperor a plough, in which are yoked a pair of bullocks, magnificent∣ly adorned. The emperor then, laying aside his royal robes, takes hold of the handle of the plough, and turns up several furrows the whole length of the field; then, with a complaisant air, having delivered the plough to the mandarins, they successively follow his example, emulating one another in performing this honorable labor with the greatest dexterity. The ceremony concludes with the distribution of money, and pieces of stuff, among the laborers there present; the most active of whom finish the remaining labor, in presence of the emperor, with great agility and address.</P>
<P>Some time after, when they have sufficiently labored and manured their grounds, the emperor repairs again, in procession, and begins the sowing of the fields; always accompanied with ceremony, and attended by the laborers of the province.</P>
<P>The same ceremonies are performed, on the same days, in all the provinces of the empire, by the viceroys, assisted by all the magistrates of their departments, in presence of a great number of the laborers of their respective provinces. I have seen this opening of the grounds at Canton, and never remember to have beheld any of the ceremonies invented by men, with half the plea∣sure
<PB N="86" REF="032696_0044_0FF42926E24F18A8"/>
and satisfaction with which I observed this.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Encouragement of Agriculture.</HEAD>
<P>The Chinese agriculture has, at the same time, other encouragements. Every year the viceroys of the provinces send to court the names of such laborers as have chiefly distinguished themselves in their employments, either by cultivating grounds till then considered as barren, or, by a superior culture, improving the production of such lands as formerly had bore grain. These names are presented to the emperor, who confers on them honorary titles, to distinguish them above their fellow laborers. If any man has made an important discovery, which may influence the im∣provement of agriculture, or should he, in any manner, deserve more distinguished marks of re∣gard than the rest, the emperor invites him to Pekin, defraying his journey with dignity, at the expense of the empire; he receives him into his palace, interrogates him with regard to his abili∣ties, his age, the number of his children, the ex∣tent and quality of his lands; then dismisses him to his plough, distinguished by honorable titles, and loaded with benefits and favors.</P>
<P>Who is happiest, gentlemen, the prince who conducts himself in this manner, or the nation who is thus governed? Amongst a people where all are equal, where every one aspires after dis∣tinctions, such encouragements cannot fail to in∣spire
<PB N="87" REF="032696_0044_0FF42926E24F18A8"/>
a love for labor, and an emulation for the cultivation of the ground.</P>

<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Attention of the Chinese Government.</HEAD>
<P>The whole attention, in general, of the Chinese government, is directed towards agriculture. The principal object of the father of a family, ought to be the subsistence of his children. The state of the fields, in consequence, forms the great object of the toils, the cares and the solicitudes of the magistrates. It may easily be conceived, that with such dispositions, the government has not neglected to secure to the laborers that liberty, property, and indulgence which are the great springs for the improvement of agriculture.</P>
<P>The Chinese enjoy, undisturbed, their private possessions, as well as those which, being by their nature indivisible, belong to all, such as the sea, the rivers, the canals, the fish which they contain, and the beasts of the forest: navigation, fishing, and the chace are free to every one; and he who buys a field, or receives it by inheritance from his ancestors, is of course the sole lord and mas∣ter.</P>
<P>The lands are free as the people; no feudal services, and no fines of alienation; none of those men interested in the misfortunes of the public; none of those farmers who never amass more exhorbitant fortunes, that when an unfavorable season has ruined the country, and reduced the un∣happy

laborer to perish for want, after having toil∣the year round for the sustenance of his fellow subjects; none of that destructive profession, hatched in the delirium of the feudal system, un∣der whole auspices arise millions of processes, which drag the laborer from his plough into the obscure and dangerous mazes of chicane, and thereby rob him, while defending his rights, of that time which would have been importantly employed in the general service of mankind.</P>

<P>This impost, which is not exactly the tenth part of the produce, is regulated according to the na∣ture of the grounds: in bad soils it is perhaps on∣ly the thirtieth part, and so in proportion. This impost, however, of the tenth part of the produce of the earth, which belongs to the emperor, is the only tax on the lands, the only tribute known in China since the origin of the monarchy: and such is the happy respect which the Chinese have
<PB N="89" REF="032696_0045_0FF4315D2A6AD360"/>
for their ancient customs, that an emperor of China would never entertain the most distant thought of augmenting it, nor his subjects the least apprehension of such augmentation. The peo∣ple pay it, in kind, not to avaricious farmers-gen∣erals, but to upright magistrates, their proper and natural governors. The amount of this tribute, though apparently trifling, must be immense, when we consider that it is levied on every foot of ground of the most extensive and best cultivat∣ed empire in the world. This tax is paid with the greatest fidelity, as they know the purposes to which it is applied. They know, that part of it is laid up in immense magazines, distributed ov∣er every province of the empire, and allotted for the maintenance of the magistrates and soldiery: they know, that, in the event of scarcity, these magazines are open to all, and the wants of the people supplied with part of that which was re∣ceived from them in times of abundance: they know too, that the remainder of this impost is sold in the public markets, and the produce of it faithfully carried to the treasury of the empire, the custody of which is entrusted to the respecta∣ble tribunal of <HI>Ho-pou,</HI> from whence it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ver is is∣sued but to supply the general wants of the family.</P>

<HEAD>Comparison of the Agriculture of Africa and Asia with that of China.</HEAD>
<P>Recollect, gentlemen, what I have said of the laws, the manners, and the customs of the different nations of Africa and Asia, the state of whose agri∣culture
<PB N="90" REF="032696_0046_0FF43160067AB100"/>
I have examined: compare nation with nation, and then judge, if the unfortunate Mala∣bar, without property, subjected to the tyrannical government of the Moguls; judge if a race of slaves, under the iron sceptre of the despot of Si∣am; judge if the Malais, ever turbulent, and fettered by their feudal laws; judge, I say, if these nations, though possessing the finest grounds in the world, can possibly ever make agriculture to flourish like the Chinese, gov∣erned as a family, and subjected to the laws of reason alone.—I shall again repeat, therefore, with confidence, that, in every country in the world, the fate of agriculture depends solely on the laws there established, on the manners of the people, and even on the prejudices which de∣rive their origin from those laws.</P>
<P>What industry have the inhabitants of the earth displayed, from one extremity of the globe to the other, in rendering themselves unhappy! created to live in society, to cultivate the earth, and enjoy from their labor the infinite blessings of the great Creator, they had only to listen to the voice of nature, who would have taught them happiness below: in place of which, they have strained their faculties in the invention of bar∣barous institutions, and perplexing legislations, which being ill adapted to the feelings of man∣kind, and discordant with that law which is en∣graved in every man's breast, their establishment could only be effected by force, deluging the world with blood; and which, once established,
<PB N="91" REF="032696_0046_0FF43160067AB100"/>
have continued to desolate the earth, checking population, by the oppression of agriculture.</P>

<HEAD>The State of Agriculture in Europe.</HEAD>
<P>What an object for an attentive traveller, to observe the state of agriculture amongst the va∣rious people who divide the globle! In Europe behold it at present flourishing, in a country which, during many preceding ages, was reduced to the necessity of begging subsistence amongst the neighboring nations, who possessed a happier climate, and a greater extent of territory. Dur∣ing those ages of barbarism, their loss of liber∣ty and right of property brought along with them the ruin of cultivation; nor has she recov∣ered those natural rights of mankind, and re∣established the foundations of drooping agricul∣ture, but through seas of blood, and outrages shocking to humanity.</P>

<HEAD>In Africa.</HEAD>
<P>Africa, in general, whose regions, known to the antients, were considered as the granaries of the world, now present nothing to the view but grounds either entirely neglected, or wretchedly cultivated by the labor of slaves.</P>

hardened even by the sweat of her laborers in chains. The northern regions of that quarter of the world are inhabited by inconsiderable tribes of savages, miserable, and without cul∣ture; yet free, and, in consequence, less wretch∣ed perhaps than those nations who pretend to be civilized; but who, being farther removed from the laws of nature, by the privation of those rights which she bestows, make ineffectual efforts to procure that happiness, which a good agriculture alone can produce.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>In Asia.</HEAD>
<P>The vast continent of Asia offers to your consi∣deration, in one quarter, an immense uncultivat∣ed region, peopled by a race of banditti, more intent on plunder than the cultivation of their grounds; in another, a great empire, formerly flourishing, and excellently labored, now inhab∣ited by the poor remains of a wretched people, perishing with hunger from the neglect of agri∣culture, and shedding their blood, not for liberty, but for a change of tyrants. This charming fer∣tile quarter of the world (the cradle of the hu∣man race) now beholds her lands in slavery, her laborers in chains, subjected either to the blind despotism of unfeeling tyrants, or the destruct∣ive yoke of the feudal system.</P>
<P>But turn your eyes to the eastern extremity of the Asiatic continent, inhabited by the Chinese, and there you will conceive a ravishing idea of
<PB N="93" REF="032696_0047_0FF43163B4AC8328"/>
the happiness the world might enjoy, were the laws of this empire the model of those of other countries. This great nation unites under the shade of agriculture, founded on liberty and rea∣son, all the advantages possessed by whatever na∣tion, civilized or savage. The blessing pronoun∣ced on man, at the moment of his creation, seems not to have had its full effect, but in favor of this people, who have multiplied as the sands on the shore.</P>
<P>Princes, who rule over nations! arbiters of their fate! view well this perspective; it is wor∣thy your attention. Would you wish abundance to flourish in your dominions, would you favor population, and make your people happy; behold those innumerable multitudes which overspread the territories of China, who leave not a shred of ground uncultivated; it is liberty, it is their undisturbed right of property that has established a cultivation so flourishing, under the auspices of which this people have increased as the grains which cover their fields.</P>
<P>Does the glory of being the most powerful, the richest, and the happiest of sovereigns, touch your ambition, turn your eyes towards Pekin, and behold the most powerful of mortal beings seated on the throne of reason:—he does not command, he instructs;—his words are not de∣crees, they are the maxims of justice and wis∣dom;—his people obey him, because his orders are dictated by equity alone.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="032696_0048_0FF4316621DE41F0"/>He is the most powerful of men, reigning over the hearts of the most numerous society in the world, who constitute his family.—He is the richest of sovereigns, drawing from an extent of territory six hundred leagues square, cultivated even to the summits of the mountains, the tenth of those abundant harvests it incessantly produces: this he considers as the wealth of his children, and he husbands it with care.—To sum up all, he is the happiest of monarchs, tasting every day the inexpressible pleasure of giving happiness to mil∣lions, and alone enjoying, undivided, that satis∣faction which his subjects share—his children! all to him equally dear; all living like brothers, in freedom and abundance, under his protection.</P>
<P>He is called the son of <HI>Tien,</HI> as the true and most perfect image of heaven, whose benevolence he imitates; and his grateful people adore him as a God, because his conduct is worthy of a man.</P>
