<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE writer of this discourse is persuaded, that many years ago, when he first began the study of the Scriptures, and for some time afterwards, he should have considered it as an exceeding great benefit if these truths had been unfolded to his un∣derstanding as he has now declared them. And this is his reason for making them public; that others may receive that benefit which he should have so highly esteemed during his great embarassment when he was trying to understand them.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ACTS, XVIth, 30th and 31st. Verses.</BIBL>
<P>"Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy House."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE are two ways of Salvation menti∣oned in Scripture.</P>
<P>One is. by a perfect unceasing obedience:</P>
<P>The other is by trusting in the mercy of God, through Christ.</P>
<P>The first is called the Covenant of works.</P>
<P>The second that of Grace or the Gospel.</P>
<P>The first is an impracticable way: the second is possible.</P>
<P>If it be asked why the first should ever be proposed, seeing it is impracticable, the answer is, it leads the way to the second, which is the only possible way.</P>
<P>The more strict the first covenant is the more it leads men to see that they are sinners, and under condemnation; and when they see them∣selves under condemnation, and that they can∣not
<PB N="5" REF="032050_0004_0FF107EBD4955538"/>
come up to the terms of the first covenant it leads them to seek for shelter under the se∣cond.</P>
<P>The terms of the second covenant are con∣tained in the words of the text.—"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." which is a plain and simple condition, and whoever does that, comes up to the stand∣ard which the gospel requires; including this in the idea of believing on the Lord. i.e. To believe on him and continue to believe—to trust in him and continue to trust—for to believe on the Lord is to trust in him, as when we believe in a man, we trust in him, in his word or promise.</P>
<P>As God, in his holy word, is said to be lov∣ing to every man, and his mercy is over all his works, and he will have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, we might suppose that in sending his gospel for the salvation of men, the terms of it would be made as plain as possible, and at least as plain as the terms of the first covenant—and so they are. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is a plain direction. And this is not an arbitrary condition. It is a necessary one. For by faith the door of in∣tercourse is opened between God and our souls, and divine communications are made thro' faith as the door. God wills our happiness, and in or∣der to it wishes us to be like him, and in propor∣tion as we are like him we shall be happy, and in proportion as we are unlike him we shall be mi∣serable. Now God is love—love in his very
<PB N="6" REF="032050_0005_0FF107EE21E3BC48"/>
essence—then according to the degree of our love will be our happiness, and according to our hatred or enmity to him so will be our mi∣sery. Now there is no way of attaining to this love, but through a sense of his goodness, and of his benefits conferred upon us; through a belief in his reconciliation; by considering him as a friend and not as an enemy; and that is only had through the knowledge of Jesus Christ in the gospel. So that faith in him is not only the condition required on our part but it is also the door or way, by which all spiritual blessings, and heavenly tempers and graces descend into the hearts of all believers, united to Christ their head, as the branch receives nourishment from the vine. And as the branch must continue in the vine in order to bear fruit, so must the members of Christ continue also united to him by faith, in order to bring forth fruit to the glory of God, and to the strengthening and confirming their faith.</P>
<P>By this state of the case it is very apparent that no other condition is requisite. And yet the plain gospel is clouded by a multitude of errors which from time to time have been spread over the minds of men by the great enemy of souls, as we may well suppose, when he is the only hindrance to salvation. For we are told that "if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ
<PB N="7" REF="032050_0006_0FF107EFB8A58A88"/>
who is the image of God should shine unto them:" and that <HI>I. Corinthians,</HI> I. <HI>chap. and</HI> 18<HI>th verse.</HI> "The preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God."</P>
<P>Among the many errors, one in particular seems to have prevailed, and prevailed the more because it seems plausible: and it is this—that if a man believes the scriptures; believes that Jesus Christ is the son of God, and came into the world as a Savior, and will yield a sincere obedience to the moral law, he will be saved.</P>
<P>A zeal to religion though a false one seems to have introduced this opinion. The abettors of this say, that if believing in the Lord or trusting in him will save a man, then a man may live as he list—there is no hold upon him; he may live as wickedly as he pleases, and yet trust to be saved at last. This is a very com∣mon, though unfound objection. And it is to be feared that those who make it know not what faith in Christ is. When those who are united to him by faith receive from God the Father and through the son as mediator, all spiritual blessings; when love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, and all heavenly graces bringing salvation in their train descend into the heart, will such a one live wickedly? No. He will have as great a desire to serve God as ever he had to serve sin, "for the love of Christ constraineth him," and he serves as a son and not as a servant. For the fear of damnation
<PB N="8" REF="032050_0007_0FF107F1B656ACD0"/>
never carried any man to Heaven. It may lead him to Repentance. It is the hope of glory which purifies his heart and makes him fit for heaven: and that is to be had through a belief in the promises, obtained through the know∣ledge of the gospel.</P>
<P>Although a man should be led astray by a false persuasion of his safety at the beginning of his faith before he becomes established, yet the assertion is still true that if a man continues to believe on the Lord he will be saved. So that if he receives the whole of the doctrine, that of believing, and continuing to believe, he cannot be injured by it, because he cannot tell that he shall continue in the faith till he receives the spirit of adoption, and is sealed with the holy spirit of promise, as the earnest of his inheri∣tance, and then the love of Christ will constrain him to serve God although he was persuaded that there was no hell at all.</P>
<P>Another reason for this opinion of sincere obedience may be this,</P>
<P>The law of God must require perfect obedi∣ence, every law must exact it: and none of us can perform every tittle—that is such a complete obedience as is required.</P>
<P>Therefore a relaxation of the law must be made, or who can be saved? For which reason some have supposed that the Gospel Covenant comes in, like a court of chancery, to mitigate the severities of the rigid law. This is plausible, but a great mistake.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032050_0008_0FF107F5AB029308"/>God intends that we shall be happy by loving him, and therefore to give us heaven not as a matter of debt but as a favor—by pardoning our multiplied transgressions under the first co∣venant, and so drawing us to love him and be happy; all which is destroyed by this scheme.</P>
<P N="1">1st. A man who looks to his sincere obedi∣ence as one of the conditions of salvation is thereby kept from trusting in the mercy of God, or in the Lord to save him; because he can ne∣ver tell whether his obedience is good enough —a sincere obedience cannot be defined: and I never knew an instance of one who looked to his sincere obedience as the ground of his ac∣ceptance that knew what was to become of him in the next life—He was always in a state of uncertainty. Such will sometimes have a glim∣mering hope; but it is like the morning cloud that soon passeth away.</P>
<P>Some under such a persuasion will have a false hope when their obedience is very imperfect indeed; and others whose obedience is much better will be troubled with doubts and scruples concerning their state, and that because, having chalked out to themselves a second condition besides the one which the gospel covenant re∣quires, and not knowing whether they have performed it they cannot trust in the mercy of God and cannot have true peace of mind from a sense of God's reconciliation; that peace of God, which passeth all understanding; nor that love which casteth out fear.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="032050_0009_0FF107F7B0567F18"/>So that when men out of zeal want to esta∣blish the doctrine of sincere obedience in order to shut the door of licentiousness, they little think by so doing that they actually shut the door of holiness. For holiness is from the Lord; so is love, if it be distinct from holiness, salvation is a supernatural work, wrought by a divine power in the heart of believers.</P>
<P>It is a mistaken notion in some to suppose that a man is saved by being lifted up and carried to a delightful spot. For salvation is in a man's own breast. The kingdom of God, said our Lord, is within you: and that kingdom we are told is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. A man under the persuasion of sincere obedience being part of the gospel covenant, is kept also in a great measure from the benefit he might reap from the first covenant which was intended to shew him his utter helplessness—that he is under the wrath of God, and must perish unless he can flee to the mercy of God in Christ. —But this benefit is lost to him because he has got a salvo; a mitigation of that severe law that was intended as a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith; as the apostle writes to the Galatians, whom he was trying to bring back to the gospel, and who had been persuaded to depart from it. And such a man not seeing his danger is not dri∣ven to the foot of mercy, and to cast his soul as it were upon Christ to be saved by him as the
<PB N="11" REF="032050_0010_0FF107FBA69C1FF0"/>
only Savior. But the man that thus cometh to him he will in no wise cast out.</P>
<P>The advocates for this third way of salvation have been called upon to shew in what part of scripture it is contained; and though they are unable to do it; yet they say it is agreeable to the general tenor of scripture.</P>
<P>I must therefore beg leave to quote many pas∣sages, that you may judge whether the doctrine of salvation by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is not fully maintained therein, and with this ob∣servation that all these are positive assertions which ought to have more weight than conclu∣sions drawn from inferences, especially as there is often much fallacy in reasoning.</P>
<P>Then 2dly, I shall from the old testament shew that trusting in the Lord amounts to the same thing as believing on him, because the same blessings, or as great, are annexed to the one as to the other.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. I shall shew what foundation we have to trust in the Lord, as every faith or trust must have a foundation.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Shall add a few short arguments, and afterwards answer some objections and conclude.</P>
<P>The passages are as follow:</P>
<P>"He came unto his own, and his own re∣ceived him not: but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name." <HI>John I.</HI> 11<HI>th &amp;</HI> 12<HI>th, verses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="032050_0011_0FF107FE0C26D700"/>"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilder∣ness, even so must the son of man be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in him should not pe∣rish, but have eternal life."</P>
<P>"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved." <HI>John III.</HI> 14.15, 16, 17, <HI>Verses.</HI></P>
<P>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that be∣lieveth on me hath everlasting life." <HI>John VI.</HI> 47<HI>th Verse.</HI></P>
<P>St. Peter when he was sent to Cornelius to tell him words whereby he and his house should be saved, among other things when he was speaking of Christ, said these words, "To him give all the Prophets witness, that, through his name, whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins." Now we should consider what all the prophets give witness to as the con∣current Testimony of Scripture.</P>
<P>"What shall we say then, that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found? For if Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory, but not before God, for what saith scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for Righteousness." <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> IV, 1, 2, <HI>&amp;</HI> 3<HI>d verses.</HI></P>
<P>"Therefore being iustified by faith, we have
<PB N="13" REF="032050_0012_0FF108006580B158"/>
peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." <HI>Rom. V. &amp;</HI> 1 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>"Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling block and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed." <HI>Rom. IX.</HI> 33 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>"Moreover brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also you have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have belie∣ved in vain." <HI>I Cor.</HI> XV. <HI>&amp;</HI> 1 <HI>&amp;</HI> 2. Here we see that they would be saved by keeping in mind that gospel which they had received, which con∣firms what I before advanced that it is necessary to continue in the faith that God may thereby work in us that which is pleasing in his fight. It nevertheless still makes faith the condition; and is no objection to its being the only one.</P>
<P>"That we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ.</P>
<P>In whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance."—<HI>Ephes. I.</HI> 12, 13 <HI>&amp;</HI> 14 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>"According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him." <HI>Ephes III.</HI> 12 <HI>&amp;</HI> 13 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>"I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live, yet not I but Christ liveth in me: and the
<PB N="14" REF="032050_0013_0FF10802AE9F2E40"/>
life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God, loving and giving him∣self for me." <HI>Galatians II.</HI> 20 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>All the hopes we have of heaven are founded upon the promise made to Abraham; who is called the father of the faithful, and was made by God himself the father of many nations, be∣cause in him should all nations of the earth be blessed. Therefore St. Paul writes to the Gala∣tians thus, "Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith are the children of Abraham and they which be of saith are blessed with faithful A∣braham." He writes also, "ye are all the chil∣dren of God by faith in Christ Jesus" And again "because ye are sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Ab∣ba, Father." When they are united by faith to Christ their head, they become one with him, they are children of Abraham, and children of God, and if children then heirs. So that the benefits of being fixt, permanent believers in Christ are inexpressible—And yet attempts are continually making to rob men of these blessings, by drawing off their attention from these things and by various devices hindering their faith in Christ Jesus. The Pharisees did it of old—they shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: They neither went in themselves, neither suffe∣red they them that were entering to go in. Our Lord said, "Wo unto you lawyers: for ye
<PB N="15" REF="032050_0014_0FF10805512C6490"/>
have taken away the key of knowledge; ye en∣tered not in yourselves, and them that were en∣tering in ye hindered." And this should be a warning to us all not to hinder the success of the gospel; which a man undesignedly may yet ignorantly do. God had mercy on St. Paul because he did it ignorantly in unbelief: yet it became a great grief to him, perhaps as long as he lived.</P>
<P><HI>John VI.</HI> 28<HI>th. Heb. X.</HI> 38, 39. <HI>I. Pet. I.</HI> 9.</P>
<P><HI>I. John, V.</HI> 13. <HI>II. Tim. IV.</HI> 7. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth—<HI>Romans II.</HI> 20. <HI>II. Corinthians, I.</HI> 24.</P>
<P>I shall forbear any more quotations on this point, these perhaps being sufficient to establish it: and shall proceed to shew from the old testa∣ment that trusting in the Lord amounts to the same thing as believing in him: the word trust being the term commonly used in the former, whilst faith or belief is the more general term in the latter, though both are sometimes used in the old as well as the new.</P>
<P>Isaiah XXVI. 3. "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee: be∣cause he trusteth in thee."</P>
<P>Here we see a man is kept in peace because he trusts in the Lord—which answers to St. Paul's saying in the 5th of Romans, "Being justified by faith we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ."</P>
<P><HI>Psalm XXXI,</HI> 27. "Be strong and he shall
<PB N="16" REF="032050_0015_0FF10808B0EA7DD0"/>
establish your heart, all ye that put your trust in the Lord."</P>
<P><HI>Ps. XXXII.</HI> 11. Great plagues remain for the ungodly; but who putteth his trust in the Lord mercy embraceth him on every side."</P>
<P><HI>Ps. XXXIII.</HI> 17, 18. "Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, and upon them that put their trust in his mercy; to deli∣ver their soul from death and to feed them in the time of dearth."</P>
<P><HI>Ps. XXXVII.</HI> 40. "The salvation of the righteous cometh of the Lord, who is also their strength in time of trouble. And the Lord shall stand by them and save them; he shall de∣liver them from the ungodly, and shall save them, because they put their trust in him."</P>
<P>Now they who trust in the Lord are the right∣eous—they come up to the standard which the second covenant requires, and therefore the Lord will save them.</P>
<P>The last I shall quote on this point is from the CXXV. <HI>Ps.</HI> and 1st verse—"They that put their trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Sion, which may not be removed, but standeth fast forever."</P>
<P>By comparing all these together we find that believing in the Lord is the same thing as trust∣ing in him.</P>
<P>But not only will salvation from wrath be se∣cured to those who trust in him, but deliverance from temporal evils and dangers also. Whoe∣ver can trust in the Lord will surely be deliver∣ed, because by trusting in him they become the
<PB N="17" REF="032050_0016_0FF1080BAD2D4308"/>
subjects of the promises, and his promises can never fail. Daniel was delivered in this manner from the lion's den. "So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God."</P>
<P N="3">3dly. I shall endeavour to show what founda∣tion we have to trust in the Lord, as every faith or trust must have a foundation.</P>
<P>In the first place, it is necessary to believe the scriptures as the word of God; and every man where the gospel is preached, may, by examina∣tion have a good ground to believe that the scriptures are of divine revelation; and this according to the clear dictates of that reason with which God originally endued mankind. Then from the scriptures he may learn that Jesus Christ is the son of God, and from thence have an idea that he is able to save. Believing that he is able to save, he may next learn that he is willing to save all that will receive him as a sa∣vior. He may learn that Christ died for all men, and became a propitiation for sin, so that God may receive sinners without any infringe∣ment of his justice, because a full and sufficient atonement hath been made for their sins. He may further learn that Christ declared that he came to save sinners—that he came to save that that was lost.</P>
<P>Therefore every man has good ground to say,</P>
<P>As Christ died for all men, he died for me
<PB N="18" REF="032050_0017_0FF1080E1AA1AC38"/>
As Christ came to save sinners he came to save me. As he came to save that that was lost, he came to save me. Every man then has a good foundation to trust in the mercy of God, or to trust in the Lord for salvation. And this is an∣swerable to St. Paul's declaration that "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."</P>
<P>It is true, faith is the gift of God. So are many other gifts which we know do in some measure depend on ourselves; such as riches, knowledge, and one more general, not fit to be mentioned.</P>
<P>As faith cometh by the word of God it is reasonable to suppose that he gives faith by en∣lightening the mind to understand his word; by removing the blindness cast over the understan∣ding, that a man may discern the truth; may discern what is true whether he believes it or not.</P>
<P>Some are earnestly seeking after faith as a gift; and sometimes they think they have it, then again that they are mistaken, making it an un∣certain thing. Perhaps they mean God's gracious act of imputing righteousness to a man, which is the consequence of faith. "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteous∣ness. This imputation is a subsequent act howe∣ver speedily it may follow. So is peace.—Be∣cause they believe, and by faith, peace is given: which may solve the dispute, whether it is because of faith, or by faith as the means.</P>
<P>Some also wait for certain good frames and
<PB N="19" REF="032050_0018_0FF10811174E7610"/>
feelings, before they can venture to trust on the Lord. This seems to arise from the opinion that Christ died only for a certain select number, and then how can they trust in him unless they had some tokens whereby they might hope to be of that number. But these frames and feelings are the consequence of faith: if so, and they wait for these frames before they will trust, they will probably wait in vain.</P>
<P>What saith the scripture; Isaiah, "Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in dark∣ness and hath no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God." This seems like the way to be enlightened with the light of the living. "Behold all ye that kin∣dle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow." <HI>Isaiah I.</HI> 10, 11. <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this point I cordially agree with some good divines; that Jesus Christ being generally offered to the world as a savior, all men have alright to lay hold on him as a savior, and to commit themselves to him, just as they are, with∣out waiting for any qualification in themselves, but to come as sinners, and rely upon him. We may suppose that the publicans and harlots did so in his day, for they entered into the kingdom of heaven before the Pharisees.</P>
<P>The former had nothing to offer, and there¦fore
<PB N="20" REF="032050_0019_0FF108135D8AED60"/>
could more easily see themselves sinners, and be more ready to receive mercy and hea∣ven as a free gift, than the others who had much merit to plead in their behalf.</P>
<P>All men have then a foundation to receive the Lord as a savior, and to look to him for it, be∣cause being God he is able to save: as it is written in the XLV. of Isaiah, "There is no God else beside me; a just God, and a savior; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth for I am God; and there is none else."</P>
<P>This is the sum of what I teach—</P>
<P>Look unto the Lord for salvation and he will save you. And as all men have a good founda∣tion to receive the Lord Jesus as a savior, they who reject him will fall under the sin of unbe∣lief, which they could not incur if he did not come to save them.</P>
<P N="1">I. John, v. &amp; 10. "He that believeth on the son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, be∣cause he believeth not the record which God gave of his son."</P>
<P N="4">4thly. I am to add a few short arguments, answer some objections, and conclude.</P>
<P N="1">1. John, VI. 28, &amp; 29. The Jews said to our Lord, in answer to his telling them to labour for the meat that endureth to everlasting life, "What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This
<PB N="21" REF="032050_0020_0FF0D3466820D7A8"/>
is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent."</P>
<P>This declaration of our Lord is a strong ar∣gument in support of what has been advanced.</P>
<P N="2">2. He said himself on another occasion, "all things are possible to him that believeth." And again, "whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever be saith. Therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them."</P>
<P>Now it is not at all more difficult to conceive that a man will go to heaven by believing he shall go there, than to remove a mountain by believing he can do it. But he can believe neither the one nor the other without a good reason for it. A man at the beginning of his faith does not believe he shall go to heaven; but when the Lord gives him the spirit of adop∣tion, and seals him with his spirit as the earnest of his inheritance, he then has a good and substantial reason, to believe that he shall inhe∣rit. And by the hopes of glory he is made fit for glory. "Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, (we) are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord." II. Cor. III. 18. And the a∣postle John says "now we are the sons of God? and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but

we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is." By beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, i. e. as I apprehend it, beholding now by faith, we are changed in some degree, so as to behold him hereafter without fear, but when the time comes that he shall appear we shall be like him or compleatly changed because we shall see him as he is, i. e. face to face. This I think St Peter alludes to when he says, "Hope to the end for the salvation that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." For then saith will be swallowed up in vision. "Now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face." So then we may say, let a man believe that he shall go to heaven and continue to be∣lieve it, he will assuredly go there. St. Paul says the same thing to the Colossians "You that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he re∣conciled in the body of his flesh thro' death, to present you holy and unblameable and unre∣proveable in his fight; if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every crea∣ture under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a minister." Colos. I. 21, 22, 23.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the LVth chapter of Isaiah it is written "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye buy wine and milk without money and without
<PB N="23" REF="032050_0022_0FF1081BADBEBD38"/>
price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David."</P>
<P>This I apprehend is a figurative expostulation with such as hunger and thirst after righteous∣ness, shewing them a shorter way to be filled than by labouring and toiling as they do in the painful works of the law, or thinking to attain to righteousness by what they can do. As the apostle writes concerning the Gentiles and Jews. "The Gentiles, saith he, which follow∣ed not after righteousness have attained to righ∣teousness, even the righteousness which is of faith; but Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they stumbled at that stumbling stone." He said a little before "a short work will the Lord make upon the earth" And this is a short work to attain to righteous∣ness by faith, instead of labouring for that which satisfieth not: and therefore the expostulation in Isaiah about labouring in vain, concludes with this advice. Incline your ear and come unto me, hear and your soul shall live: i. e. hearken diligently to the word of God; get knowledge;
<PB N="24" REF="032050_0023_0FF1081DF9CAA998"/>
hear the glad tidings of the gospel, and your foul shall live; and the Lord will make an ever∣lasting covenant with you; his covenant of peace; the same that he promised to make with the house of Israel—"I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least to the greatest. For I will be mer∣ciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." For when the Lord sends his love into their hearts, this love blots out their sins, and they also know him according to the promise; for God is love, and "he that loveth is born of God, and know∣eth God." I. John IV. And this is the same co∣venant that is promised to the Jews when they shall be gathered out of all lands. "I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good: but I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me."</P>
<P>A promise is also made to those who continue in the faith that they shall be set free. In John the 8th chap. 31 v. &amp;c. "Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, if ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." It is plain from the following words that he meant a freedom from sin, and
<PB N="25" REF="032050_0024_0FF108205BF72630"/>
this freedom from sin is obtained by a deliver∣ance from the law: It is not only from the law that we have the knowledge of sin; but sin has its power from the law. "The strength of sin is the law." When a man is delivered from the law he is delivered from the power of sin: as the apostle writes to the Romans. "Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law but under grace." Therefore it is through knowledge that we become delivered and that in our own apprehension. We consi∣der the law as having nothing to do with us, no more than if a law had never been made, which could have brought us under condemnation; though it remains as a rule of life, that by it we may regulate our conduct so as to please God our Father. And by this we see how the knowledge of the truth can set us free: and St. Paul in a very particular manner attributes that freedom from sin which the Roman Con∣verts enjoyed, to their having obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered them, or as some reader it, into the mould of which they were cast or delivered. When a man is set free from the law he serves God as a son, and not as a servant, as our Lord said upon the occasion, "If the son shall make you free you shall be free indeed."</P>
<P>Again, We may consider faith as owing to a certain degree of humility. As a proof of this we often see it follow great convictions for sin which humble men much. The jailor, who
<PB N="26" REF="032050_0025_0FF10822B375F728"/>
spake the words of the text, we may suppose to be much humbled by the earthquake; and that it disposed him the more readily to hear the words of St. Paul which brought him to receive bap∣tism, to believe in God and rejoice in him. We find too that charity which is the highest attainment, believeth all things, hopeth all things, as well as endureth all things.</P>
<P>Add to this, those who are strong in faith are said to give glory to God: and that without faith it is impossible to please him, insomuch that the heavy wrath of God came on Israel because they believed not in God and put not their trust in his help; whereas Enoch by faith was translated that he should not see death; and all those worthies we read of, and of whom the world was not worthy, obtained a good report through faith, though they received not the promise. From this we judge that faith is no trifling thing; and from all that has been said to establish this doctrine we may conclude, that to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, is the con∣dition required under the Gospel Covenant; and that there is no other way, as "there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." <HI>Acts,</HI> IV. 12 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>I am now to answer some objections.</P>
<P>Obj. 1st. The maintainers of a sincere obedi∣ence or the necessity of works joined to faith to make out the conditions of our acceptance, have in the course of time been driven from a former
<PB N="27" REF="032050_0026_0FF1082498ADDF00"/>
hold which they maintained, and have since ta∣ken shelter in another.</P>
<P>They have been made to see that a man is not justified by the deeds of the law. This has been made so evident to them, that they now acknowledge that by faith alone a man is justi∣fied, and brought into a state of salvation; but that hereafter he will be justified by his works. By this subterfuge they hope to reconcile St. Paul and St. James—The former they suppose speaks of our first justification, the latter of our second at the day of judgment. But un∣luckily for them, St. Paul almost constantly speaks of justification by faith in the fight of God—of that justification which we must have when we appear before him.</P>
<P>They quite reverse the matter. Abraham was justified by works, says St. Paul, or if he was justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before God. Though he were justified here, yet before God, or in his sight, he could not by his obedience, because no obedience not absolutely perfect can stand before the absolute purity of God.</P>
<P>"By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified, in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin." <HI>Rom. III.</HI> 20 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>In the 3d of <HI>Galatians</HI> the same apostle writes, "that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident, for the just shall live by faith." "If there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness
<PB N="28" REF="032050_0027_0FF108266D5C6570"/>
should have been by the law. But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."</P>
<P>The inheritance was promised to Abraham and to his seed—that is to Christ, and all that are his. All that are of Faith are the children of Abraham. If they become united to Christ by faith or Abraham's children by faith, why should the badge of their sonship be altered? Why should not the same faith which constituted them children continue them such? To say that they are now by faith translated into the king∣dom of Christ, but that after they are put into the kingdom other terms are imposed is quite fanciful, for it has no foundation in scripture.</P>
<P>"If the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise, but God gave it to Abraham by promise." What are the children to do? Why like their father to live by the promises, be persuaded of them and embrace them, and then the promise will have effect in purifying their hearts, otherwise not. For the apostle says, if they which be of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise of none effect. Accord∣ing to his reasoning I should judge that in pro∣portion as a man looked to his obedience for his acceptance in the same proportion would his faith be made void, and the promise of none effect: and this must be the case of those who look for acceptance on account of their good works at the day of judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032050_0028_0FF1082969E7EF90"/>The apostle says further, as the law worketh wrath—"therefore it is of faith, meaning the inheritance, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all." The promise will be sure to all believers both among Jews and Gentiles— and if the inheritance is first promised to faith is it not strange that it should be changed to something else; when it is declared that it is of Faith that it might be by grace, and elsewhere to be of grace and not of works lest any man should boast—and elsewhere it is said that "to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt." Which the Lord will not allow of, because he wills men to love him and be happy—and to love him by receiving Hea∣ven as a free gift.</P>
<P>Besides, if St. Paul had any idea of a second justification by works, could he have concluded his life with this declaration? "I am now rea∣dy to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Hence∣forth there is laid up for me a crown of righte∣ousness, which the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day: and not to me only but to all them that love his appearing." He rests all his hope upon his having kept the faith.</P>
<P>St. Ignatius in his epistle to the Ephesians has a very bold expression, "my soul be the surely
<PB N="30" REF="032050_0029_0FF1082CCFC0B700"/>
of all them that trust in the Cross," which he could not have used if he had thought any other condition necessary to salvation.</P>
<P>But the epistle of St. James is reckoned to afford a strong argument in favor of justification by works; at least in the day of judgment: which it becomes necessary to consider.</P>
<P>St. James asks, "what doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?" And a little further he says—"Even so faith, if it hath not works is dead, being alone." This is not denied. It is not contended that a faith which doth not produce works will avail any thing.</P>
<P>But the apostle goes on to declare, that A∣braham was justified by works when he offered up his son—and that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect: And that the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness—and adds, "ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."—And at the end of the chapter observes, "as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also." And this seems to be the conclusion of his reasoning, that faith without works is dead, which is not denied, it being a living faith producing works which is contended for.</P>
<P>I will not say that the apostle meant that the works of Abraham and of Rahab were a justi∣fication
<PB N="31" REF="032050_0030_0FF1082F19816758"/>
of their faith in the eyes of men, be∣cause these were secret transactions, but that his meaning was as he says, that Abraham's faith was made perfect by works, and that his works were a confirmation that he was a believer, be∣cause he thereby fulfilled the scripture which declared him to be one. This is giving faith its due preeminence. Then when he adds, "ye see then how that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only," I suppose him to mean, consistently with what he had said, that as works strengthen faith they tend to our justification. This may be illustrated thus. A man being alive is enabled to eat, and eating continues life or enables him to live. So faith being alive produces works, and works keep faith alive. Yet life is the principle by which a man can see his friend and enjoy his company, not his eating which is only a secondary help. In like manner it is faith which enables a man to see God with Joy; and his works only strengthen and confirm his faith. For where there is no opportunity of performing good works as in the case of the thief on the cross, there faith without works is sufficient, and makes it evident that faith is the essential thing, For salvation depends upon a man's being in such a state or disposition, as to be able to bear the glory of God. Faith and love constitute his state, first faith, followed by love, as good works strengthen faith, then they tend to bring as into a state of justification in our own mind,
<PB N="32" REF="032050_0031_0FF108325E2E45C8"/>
or such a state of faith and love as will enable us to stand before God without confusion, and to love him.</P>
<P>But if a right faith must have good works where is the use of contending in this manner? It is very useful, and highly proper to clear the truth of those difficulties with which it is em∣barrassed; because a man is naturally disposed to look to his own endeavors for acceptance; even those who know better are prone to it; and every look or thought of that kind tends to make void faith and render the promise of none effect.</P>
<P>On the other hand when we consider that nothing we can do will give us any title to sal∣vation, but that when we have done all we are yet unprofitable servants, then we shall be more disposed to humility, trust in the mercy of God, and rely upon his promises.</P>
<P>Object. 2. But it is said, every man shall be rewarded according to his works.</P>
<P>Answer. So they will. Believers will be rewarded in proportion to their works, and unbelievers will be rewarded—punished, in proportion to theirs. "Say ye to the righte∣ous it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Wo unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the re∣ward of his hands shall be given him." <HI>Isaiah III.</HI> 10 &amp; 11 <HI>v.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, our Lord told the Jews that if they were the children of Abraham they would do
<PB N="33" REF="032050_0032_0FF10835591ED8E0"/>
the works of Abraham and as this is the case that true believers will do the works of Abra∣ham, when two qualities appertain to the same people, the promises may be made indifferently to either; or blessings be annexed to both; as where it is said; "There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit." <HI>Rom. VIII.</HI></P>
<P>But again it is said, that St. Paul writes to Timothy—"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, rea∣dy to distribute, willing to communicate; lay∣ing up in store a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life." Now as there is no laying hold of eter∣nal life but by faith, and it is allowed that good works help us so to do, there is no force in this objection.</P>
<P>That salvation is not granted to good works we may judge also from this reason.</P>
<P>Good works are only signs or indications of goodness. It is goodness not works which meet with the reward of heaven. Then a man if he have goodness of heart, or love will be happy without performing any good works if he dies without having an opportunity, which is commonly allowed upon this account; because God foresees what he would do if he had lived, and takes the will for the deed. They who thus
<PB N="34" REF="032050_0033_0FF10837C08A84F0"/>
argue still go upon the supposition that good works will obtain the reward; whereas the truth is, it is the disposition of heart, and not the outward indications of it that will meet with a reward, and that of course, tho commonly ex∣pressed as if done by a special donation.</P>
<P>Object. 3. As I have mentioned that Christ died for all men as a reason why all men might trust in him, besides his being generally offered as a savior, which some believe who do not allow the former, I must answer an objection to it.</P>
<P>I have been told that St. Augustine believed that be died for all men till he considered that faith is the gift of God, which kind of reasoning ought not to be opposed to plain declarations of scripture. The chief argument of the objectors I mean is this.</P>
<P>As all men are not saved, Christ did not die for all men, for if he died for all men, all would be saved.</P>
<P>But in answer to this it may be observed, that the death of Christ does not of itself quali∣fy any man for salvation, or make him meet for heaven. It does not qualify one of the elect, because it makes no alteration in the heart. Salvation is wrought in the heart through a faith in the atonement, and a trust in God's mercy in consequence of it. Therefore this objection should not hinder us from yielding to positive assertions, which ought not to be bent to preconceived opinions.</P>
<P>St. Paul writes to Timothy, that God "will
<PB N="35" REF="032050_0034_0FF10839D1153AE0"/>
have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one media∣tor between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time." Again St. Peter speaks of false teachers who shall privily bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruc∣tion." Both these passages are very plain: the one shewing in expressterms that God is willing that all men should be saved; and that there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all" —the other, that some will bring upon them∣selves swift destruction, denying the Lord that bought them. Now though it should be said that a ransom for all does not mean all men, but only all the elect, which seems to be a poor shift, this cannot be applied nor evaded with re∣spect to those who deny the Lord that bought them, and bring destruction on themselves, un∣less they should say that the Lord bought them without dying for them, or that destruction does not hinder their salvation.</P>
<P>Again, Christ dying for all men does not hinder those who reject him as a savior from falling under a sin of unbelief. As faith is the condition of the gospel covenant, so unbelief is the peculiar sin against it; and a horrible sin it is to make God a liar, in not believing the record which he gave of his son It is therefore, I suppose, that the "gospel of the kingdom
<PB N="36" REF="032050_0035_0FF1083EC56C6998"/>
shall be preached in all the world for a witness to all nations," before the end of the world. St. Peter also informs us why the gospel was preached to them also that are dead —namely that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit," i. e. that these departed spirits, might be judged like men living in the flesh, tho' as spirits they are alive like God, who is a spirit. For he had just before told us that Christ after his death preached to the Antede∣luvian spirits that lived in the days of Noah; and this is the reason given for it, that they might be judged like men living in the flesh.</P>
<P>Another reason why Christ died for all men is this. All men will be raised from the dead by virtue of this atonement. "For as in Adam all die so in Christ shall all be made alive." As they will be raised at the last day whether they believe or not, so did he die for them whether they believe or no, but those who believe in his death now may have a good ground to trust in his mercy, and look for salvation through him; thro' the divine influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty, and communicated from time to time as he shall think fit; whilst his death cannot screen from wrath those who believe not in it, because God in glory will be a consuming fire to unbelievers, and at the same time the hope and consolation of Israel.</P>
<P>But we may yet consider Christ as a general savior—that he offered himself as a general
<PB N="37" REF="032050_0036_0FF108408BB89858"/>
sacrifice for sin; that whosoever will, may lay hold on him as a propitiation, and look to him for salvation; just as if a fountain was opened near a town for general use, that whosoever will may take of the water freely. In this case he died as much for one man as another, though his death with respect to salvation becomes ef∣fectual only to such as apply it to themselves. Still here is good ground for every man, not only to believe the historical facts concerning him, but also to trust in him. Whereas when his death is considered only as intended for the elect, I cannot conceive upon what ground any man can believe in him otherwise than that he came to save the elect. How then can any man believe in him for salvation? For though faith is the gift of God, yet he tells no man that he is one of the adopted till after he is a believer. "Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." and "because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying Abba, Father." And if "the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God," then we are children before we receive that testimo∣ny. If no man receives the spirit of adoption till after he is a believer, how can he with pro∣priety wait for any such token before he can venture to trust in Christ? or how can he do it unless he receives him generally as a savior, who died for one man as well as another. It is probably owing to this, that some get a hope,
<PB N="38" REF="032050_0037_0FF10842596CC618"/>
from a text of scripture applied to their minds, that they are one of the number for whom Christ died; which hope they lose after a while and then they are to seek again for some other sign.</P>
<P>But Mr. Hervey and his friends place this matter on a much surer footing. They consider the Lord Jesus Christ as offered generally as a savior; and as all where the gospel comes are invited to receive him as such, they all have suf∣ficient ground to do so, insomuch that they will be condemned if they do not.</P>
<P>If the gospel is to be preached in all the world as a witness to all nations, and all those, who, having an opportunity of hearing it, re∣ject the Lord Jesus as a savior, will be condem∣ned for rejecting him, this is a proof that he died equally for all. And though none can be∣lieve effectually but by the power of God; and though it should be the case, that this power is not exerted but in behalf of a certain number, yet those who reject Christ as a savior will justly fall under condemnation, because salvation is open to all; and there is no hindrance on the part of the Lord? the hindrance being only owing to Satan, who blinds their understanding: And their rejecting the gospel is a proof that they are under his power. Therefore the sen∣tence of condemnation can be as well considered as coming upon them, as that the Lord should swear in his wrath, that the Jews should not enter into his rest because they had erred in their hearts and had not known his ways. It
<PB N="39" REF="032050_0038_0FF108443536B9F8"/>
is for this reason the gospel will become a wit∣ness against them. But it could be no witnes against them, if Christ did not die as well so them as for others,</P>
<P>I shall now conclude with a few exhortations.</P>
<P>As Salvation is a matter of such great mo∣ment it becomes every man to examine himself whether he be in a good way; therefore according to St. Paul's advice to the Corinthians it would be proper to examine "yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your ownselves; know ye not your ownselves how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates," or disappro∣ved, as rendered by some? Abiding in the faith is also necessary. No time is limited we must abide in order to bear fruit. Our Lord said, "as the Branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me." For some believe only for a while and in time of temptation fall away; whilst the word in others is "choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and brings to fruit to perfection. How necessary is it then to examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith. This is to be done by comparing your state and conduct by the word of God. For every man attentive to salvation may under divine teaching know his state from the holy scriptures. The works of the flesh and the fruit of the spirit are there described. The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; and all these are
<PB N="40" REF="032050_0039_0FF108479FB727E8"/>
the consequence of believing and continuing to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>To live under a known and habitual in∣dulgence in sin is without question not to be in a good state. But as some indulge themselves in fashionable excesses and think no harm of it, and be in error thro' ignorance, it is proper to remind them, that there are three great ene∣mies, the devil, the world, and the flesh, and it is no great matter which a man is enslaved to in respect to salvation, as either will exclude from heaven if persisted in. If many did not deceive themselves and one another, they ne∣ver could conceive that a man could serve God and mammon at the same time. It is true it depends upon how much the heart is affected by the things of the world. God has given us all things to enjoy in moderation, but when the heart is drawn from him, whether it be by idols of gold or silver, toys or pleasures it should be a proof to us that we are not spiritually minded, which is called life and peace. Worldly mind∣edness then is also a bad sign. "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life is not of the Father, but is of the world." I. John. II. 15. &amp; 16. v. Altho' it is not a determinate thing how far a man may be attached to the world with safety, as all men have concerns in it, yet each man
<PB N="41" REF="032050_0040_0FF108492E6BCDE8"/>
by attention may examine how far his thoughts are weaned from the right object; and so far the injunction will be a rule to examine himself by. On the other hand we are told that we know we are passed from death into life if we love the brethren. This rule is but little attended to, because few think much of the professed fol∣lowers of Christ, because of prejudices on ac∣count of the walk of some who make such pro∣fession. Many do not consider that some only believe for a while, and the faults of others are enlarged upon they being more narrowly watch∣ed by their neighbours, who have been awaken∣ed in some measure by their conversions, and are rather glad of an excuse to trouble themselves no more about such things but to go on in the old way of being saved if they are as good as others.</P>
<P>A disposition to prayer is also a sign of being in the faith; heavenly mindedness and prayer being great indications of spiritual life.</P>
<P>Fatherly chastisements for your faults is an∣other mark, "for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he re∣ceiveth." And if you are sons and have any ex∣perience in religion you will very sensibly feel the force of this truth.</P>
<P>And if you have abided, you will preceive the fruts of the spirit, producing a conduct an∣swerable to them.</P>
<P>But if after examination you find that you have no well grounded trust in the Lord, and
<PB N="42" REF="032050_0041_0FF1084BE00C6438"/>
no fruits answerable to it, you should try, by humiliation and prayer, and diligent applicati∣on to get your mind informed and get that knowledge which will enable you to cast your whole dependance upon that almighty Savior who came down from heaven for us men and for our salvation. And when you trust in the Lord you will come to see, because the Lord will teach you, if ye continue long enough to learn, that you have nothing to do with the law but as a rule of life, whereby you will be judg∣ed and chastened as sons, that you may not be condemned with the world. You will know what it is to be alive unto God, and will expe∣rience the truth of that saying in the Psalms, "I will run in the way of thy comandments when thou hast set my heart at liberty."</P>
<P>On the contrary, if you fall back to the law, by not taking heed to the things which you have heard, and by not continuing in the doctrine of Christ, you will find deadness in all your do∣ings,—that you "build again the things which you destroyed, and make yourself a transgres∣sor, (Galatians) and that Christ will profit you nothing because you are fallen from grace."</P>
<P>May the Lord give you a right understand∣ing in all things!</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON MR. LOCKE'S <HI>Paraphrase &amp; Notes.</HI> ON ST. PAUL'S EPISTLES.</HEAD>
<P>MR. LOCKE does not seem fully to ex∣press St. Paul's meaning in some material points. For in many places where there is a seeming inconsistency in the apostle, there is also an appearance of the like inconsistency in Mr. Locke. This is observable with regard to the great point which has been much canvassed in the world—whether our salvation is to be obtained by works or by faith. Therefore al∣though the exposition in each place should ap∣pear just, yet if the seeming inconsistency is not removed, the enquirer after truth is not satisfied with it, nor can he be in such case, as long as he is persuaded that there is no real, but only an apparent inconsistency in the di∣vine writings.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="032050_0043_0FF1085209B96CF8"/>Mr. Locke in his paraphrase on the III. chap∣ter of the Galatians, has these words—"As A∣braham believed in God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness; so know ye that those who are of faith, i. e. who rely upon God and his promises of grace and not upon their own per∣formances, they are the children of Abraham who shall inherit." And in his notes upon the same chapter he says, that the blessing—justifi∣cation—righteousness—life—inheritance—be∣ing the children of God, therein mentioned, are in effect all the same thing on one side; and the curse, v. 13th. the direct contrary on the other side; and also that the blessing promi∣sed to Abraham and his seed was wholly upon the account of faith. Indeed this point he is so clear in, that there can be no doubt of his opinion about it: for he does not suppose with some, that the apostle meant only the Jewish law, when he said by the deeds thereof there should no flesh be justified; but that his mean∣ing was, that men could be justified by no law whatever—because every one failing of an ex∣act conformity of his actions to the immutable rectitude of the eternal rule of right, will be found unrighteous. Again, upon Ephesians, he says, "The apostle gives such a draught as in every part of it shews, that in the Kingdom of Christ they are set far above the Mosaical rites, and enjoy the spiritual and incomprehensible benefits of it, not by the tenure of a few out∣ward ceremonies, but by their faith alone in
<PB N="47" REF="032050_0044_0FF108556ED8A530"/>
Jesus Christ, to whom they are united, and of whom they are members."</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these and such like expres∣sions, signifying that it is by faith and not by works of any kind that we are justified; yet in other places he asserts, and that as the apos∣tle's meaning, that it is faith and a sincere o∣bedience joined that will procure us everlasting life. For instance on the 7th of Romans, speaking of those under the law, he says "their endeavors after obedience delivered them not from that death which their bodies or carnal appetites running them into transgressions brought upon them. That deliverance was to be had from grace, by which those putting themselves from under the law into the gospel state were accepted, if with the bent of their minds they sincerely endeavoured to serve and obey the law of God, though sometimes thro' the frailty of the flesh they fell into sin." A∣gain, "Converts to christianity are free from condemnation, if they perform what is requi∣red of them."</P>
<P>Now in order to reconcile these contradicti∣ons, he supposes, that a man before he is brought into a state of grace, is in a state of death: that he is then as insensible to spiritual things, as a dead man, and that he can do no∣thing to recover himself—that his being resto∣red is altogether of grace, and that it is by faith alone;—But when a man is restored to a state of grace, or life, or salvation, which are
<PB N="48" REF="032050_0045_0FF10856FA2EFD30"/>
said to signify one and the same thing, then in order to obtain eternal life hereafter or the King∣dom of Heaven, he must yield a sincere obedi∣ence, which the following quotations may serve to evince.</P>
<P>"It is the favor of God alone through Jesus Christ that delivers frail man from death. Those under grace obtain life upon sincere intentions and endeavors after obedience, and those en∣deavors a man may attain to in this state of frailty. But good intentions and sincere en∣deavors are of no behoof against death to those under the law, which requires compleat and perfect obedience, but gives no ability to attain it. And so it is grace alone through Jesus Christ that aceepting what frail man can do, de∣livers from the body of death." Again, "These two considerations of the kingdom of heaven some men have confounded and made one; so that a man being brought into the first of these wholly by grace without works, saith being all that was required to instate a man in it, they have concluded that for the attaining eternal life, or the kingdom of God in the world to come, faith alone and not good works are re∣quired, contrary to express words of scrip∣ture, and the whole tenor of the gospel: But yet not being admitted into that state of eter∣nal life for our good works, it is by grace here too that we are saved, our righteousness after all being imperfect, and we by our sins liable to condemnation and death: But it is by grace
<PB N="49" REF="032050_0046_0FF1085A39A14008"/>
we are made partakers of both these kingdoms; it is only into the kingdom of God in this world we are admitted by faith alone without works, but for our admittance into the other, both faith and obedience, in a sincere endeavor to perform those duties, all those good works; which are incumbent on us, and come in our way to be performed by us from the time of our believing till our death."</P>
<P>These shew Mr. Locke's opinion very clearly, and the ideas he had of this matter; but whe∣ther they are answerable to what the apostle had on this subject may be much disputed.</P>
<P>If blessing, justification, righteousness, life, inheritance mean the same thing, and mean as he says, the thing promised to Abraham and his seed, sometimes called blessing, sometimes inheritance &amp;c. and a man partakes of this pro∣mise solely by faith without works, then accor∣ding to his idea of the two states, the being admitted into the first state was all that the Apos∣tle meant by receiving the blessing and partak∣ing of the inheritance promised to Abraham. It was only an admission into an easier covenant, such as Beveridge compares to a court of Chan∣cery with respect to a court of Common law. So that the matter as far as it respects Mr. Locke's argument will depend upon what this inheritance is; for if it means only that spiritu∣al state of grace, which believers are now pla∣ced in as preparatory to the kingdom of hea∣ven, all the arguments drawn from the expres∣sions about justification by faith, are of no
<PB N="50" REF="032050_0047_0FF1085D3AC764D0"/>
force when applied to the state of glory hereaf∣ter.</P>
<P>With deference to the opinion of that great man, I would suppose, that the kingdom of Christ was begun in this world and continued on to the other: and that obtaining an inheri∣tance in him was being translated into his king∣dom; that as christians are now blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, they in him receive the blessing promised to Abraham, In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed: that when they are now raised up and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, they are created in him unto good works; and that being joined to him in one spirit they are instated in this inheritance, as the sealing of the holy spirit is the earnest thereof; and that men in this world are possessed of eternal life, and pass from death unto life, according to our Savior's words.</P>
<P>So far this seems to be St. Paul's meaning with respect to the inheritance; but not that they were different kingdoms, the admission into which was upon different terms: for all who shall be found of this kingdom will meet with the happiness annexed to it hereafter.</P>
<P>Can we suppose that Abraham when he was justified was admitted into an easier covenant, that required a less perfect obedience than he was in before? and if we do not suppose it with respect to him why should we in respect to his offspring? God gave him the inheritance by promise: and he and his seed are the heirs to
<PB N="51" REF="032050_0048_0FF1085F74130A18"/>
it. He was made the father of all that believe, "And all that are of faith are the children of Abraham. Here is one and the same inhe∣ritance promised to Abraham, and to his seed, then all that is necessary in order to become heirs to it, is to become children of Abraham; and whatever the term believer may signify, believers undoubtedly are the true heirs. For which reason we should stick by this truth, and make it a rule when we get upon sure ground there to keep footing: otherwise some seeming∣ly contrary scripture will insensibly push us from it. This has been often observed. Therefore let <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adhere to this truth that believers are the true heirs to the inheritance promised unto A∣braham.</P>
<P>But an admission into this kingdom is not only by faith, but the privileges, as well as the future benefits annexed to it, are also deri∣ved from faith. The same apostle writes thus to the Colossians, You that were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy, and unblameable, and unreproveable in his light; if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard &amp;c." In like manner he says to the Hebrews, "we are made partakers of Christ if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence, stedfast unto the end." If believers are now translated into the kingdom of Christ, and if they conti∣nue
<PB N="52" REF="032050_0049_0FF10861C8878860"/>
in the faith, will be presented holy, and unblameable and unreproveable. It shows that it is either one and the same kingdom, or that the terms or way of admission are the same, i.e. by becoming and remaining believers.</P>
<P>But to proceed—Mr. Locke in one of his notes on the 2d of Romans says, "we see by the doctrine of St. Paul and the new testament, there is one and the same rule of rectitude set to the actions of all mankind, Jews, Gentiles, and Christians, and that failing of a compleat obedience to it in every tittle, makes a man unrighteous, the consequence whereof is death." Again, "Every one failing of an exact confor∣mity of his actions to the immutable rectitude of that eternal rule of right, will be found un∣righteous, and so incur the penalty of that law." And yet he supposes, that God dispenses with the exact performance of this eternal rule; and that he accepts of a less perfect obedience as more suitable to the frailty of men: and that the merits of Christ are the foundation of this change, so that those who came under this mild∣er covenant by faith, are not under the law, but under grace. This I judge to be his mean∣ing. But we no where find that God accepts of a less perfect obedience. He may pardon sin, and yet require compleat obedience; an immutable eternal rule must forever remain unchangeable. Christ died to pay the penalty of this law, of this eternal law, but not that the rigor of it should be abated afterwards. It does not seem consistent with the wisdom of
<PB N="53" REF="032050_0050_0FF1086362C69A68"/>
God's government that an obedience to him should in any instance be dispensed with. As governor of the universe he has a right to com∣pleat obedience, and cannot consistently with that order necessary to be preserved admit of deviations from it: neither can we conceive how any line can be drawn to distinguish how far these deviations may be allowed, so as to satis∣fy the creature: For though God may define it, yet man cannot, and therefore he must be uncertain of his fate. But we can conceive how God can be reconciled to men consistently with his justice. When a perfect atonement has been made for sin▪ we readily see how the penalty of the law has been paid, &amp; how our offended crea∣tor can love us freely. Then there is no occa∣sion for introducing this doctrine of sincere obedience. For sinners being, reinstated by faith, whenever they transgress there is the same atonement to fly to: Christ is still the propitiato∣ry, or mercy seat; by faith in whom they can be healed as well as they could at first be resto∣red. So that this eternal rule of right may still remain as inflexible as ever in its demands. If a sincere obedience is believed as acceptable, it is likely to cause men either to be in doubt of their state; or else to think they are good e∣nough, and so keep them from looking to the mercy seat of Christ. Whereas he who consi∣ders not his sincere obedience, but what the law requires, will be more apt to look to the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, and by so doing to yield a more perfect obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="032050_0051_0FF108663948D738"/>This doctrine of being accepted by thus en∣deavouring to please God, is no where plainly declared in scripture. It is only from deductions taken up. Then we will next consider the VIth chapter of Romans, from whence it would seem that Mr. Locke was induced to embrace it, in order to reconcile the doctrine there with what he had so strongly enforced of justification by faith alone; for his comments are otherwise seemingly irreconcileable.</P>
<P>The scope of this chapter seems to be this; to show to the disciples the consequence that would follow their yielding themselves to the service of sin; namely that it would produce death. He had just before said that the law entered that sin might abound, but where sin abounded grace did much more abound; therefore lest any should say, shall we sin then that Grace may abound, he asks, how shall we that are dead to sin live any lon∣ger therein? he shews, that they were delivered from the service of sin. He considers sin as a master to whom they had been subject—and observes that they were now delivered from that subjection—and that sin should not have dominion over them, because they were not under the law but under grace. Yet from what he says it may be inferred that they might re∣turn to the service of their old master; there∣fore he warne them against it, and tells them not to yield to sin, but unto God as those that are alive from the dead; and that if they do yield to sin the wages he will give them is death; but that the gift of God is eternal life through
<PB N="55" REF="032050_0052_0FF1086926AEADF0"/>
Jesus Christ our Lord. This seems to be nearly the substance of the chapter. Now Mr. Locke seems to give this interpretation to the passage about sin not having dominion over them— "If their obedience were to sin, they were vassals of sin, and would certainly receive the wages of that master, which was nothing but death: But if they obeyed righteousness, i. e. sincerely endeavored after righteousness, though they did not attain it, <HI>sin should not have do∣minion over them by death.</HI> i. e. <HI>should not bring death upon them:</HI> Because they were not under the law which condemned them to death for eve∣ry transgression; but under grace, which by faith in Jesus Christ justified them to eternal life from their many transgressions." Again in his note on the 14th verse. "The force of St. Paul's reasoning here stands thus: You are obliged by your taking on you the profession of the gospel, not to be any longer slaves and vassals to sin, nor to be under the sway of your carnal lusts, but to yield yourselves up to God to be his servants in a constant and sincere purpose and endeavor of obeying him in all things; this if you do, sin shall not be able to procure your death; for you Gentiles are not under the law which condemns to death for every the least transgression, though it be but a slip of infir∣mity; but by your baptism are entered into the covenant of grace, and being under grace, God will accept of your sincere endeavors in the place of exact obedience; and give you eternal life through Jesus Christ;
<PB N="56" REF="032050_0053_0FF1086C76617A70"/>
but if you, by a willing obedience to your lusts, make yourselves vassals to sin, sin, as the Lord and master to whom you belong, will pay you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith death, the only wages that sin pays."</P>
<P>From hence we see Mr. Locke is of opinion, that sin not having dominion, over them means, that sin should not bring death upon them, be∣cause every transgression under grace was not punished with death, but under the law it was. But it does not appear, that the being delivered from the dominion of sin meant their deliver∣ance from death the consequence of sin, but their deliverance from their master sin who gave death only as his wages. He repents it again and again, that the wages of sin is death, and yet asserts that sin not having dominion over them means, that sin shall not procure their death as they yield to him in a few instances only, and do not give themselves up entirely to his sway. But the meaning I think is, that when they were under grace and not under the law, sin loses it's strength, because "the strength of sin is the law," and if they were delivered from the law and no longer under it, sin loses it's force, and consequently has no more dominion over them; which it would have if they returned again to the law. Therefore the apostle in this chapter attributes their deli∣verance to their having obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which he had delivered them; or into the mould of which they had been delivered or cast, i. e. The doctrine of the gospel which he taught them they had re∣ceived,
<PB N="57" REF="032050_0054_0FF1086E1C721EA8"/>
and it cast them into that form of thought which overpowered sin, and made them alive for the service of God. In the same man∣ner he tells the Galatians, that if they walked in the spirit, they should not fulfil the lust of the flesh"—for this is being freed from the do∣minion of sin. But it is said, "If ye live af∣ter the flesh ye shall die, but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live." And this seems to imply that life will be given to those that obey. But if we reflect a little we shall not find that to be the case; but that the meaning is, that if they mortify the deeds of the body they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> continue to live. For they were already alive; the expression that they shall die if they live after the flesh, denotes that they were alive, as well as the whole con∣text. They were made alive by faith in Christ Jesus, and it was necessary that they should obey in order to continue so: for if they again yield∣ed themselves "servants to sin, his servants they were to whom they obeyed whether of sin un∣to death, or of obedience unto righteousness." We must remember that believers are the heirs. They obtain the inheritance and keep it by faith; and as good works are enjoined as necessary to their future happiness, the easiest way to solve this difficulty is to suppose, that a certain degree of obedience is necessary to preserve their faith. If this can be allowed all the difficulty will va∣nish. For a proof of it we may refer to what the apostle writes to the Hebrews. "Take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil
<PB N="58" REF="032050_0055_0FF1086FD5531F28"/>
heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily while it is called, to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the begin∣ning of our confidence stedfast unto the end."</P>
<P>This shews that sin hardens the heart and in∣troduces unbelief. The apostle also advising Timothy about holding faith and a good consci∣ence, adds, "which some having put away, concerning faith have made shipwreck;" which further proves that without obedience there is no continuance in the faith; and it is conform∣able to what has been already mentioned, that sin will produce death; and it does so by destroying that faith by which life is preserved. And that obedience will confirm our faith St. James as∣sures us when he says, that Abraham's faith by works was made perfect." So that we may still say that believers are the true heirs, and yet allow that good works are necessary to salvation, because they strengthen that faith that men must preserve in order to partake of the fulness of the inheritance. This seems to be an easier way of reconciling the matter, than either by saying on the one hand, that faith in it's nature includes e∣vangelical obedience, or on the other, that good works are not necessary to salvation, but are only useful, ornamental, and evidences of a true faith; or even to say with Mr. Locke, That faith alone instates a man in a way of salvation, and that a sincere obedience joined with faith is the condition on which he is finally saved; be∣cause
<PB N="59" REF="032050_0056_0FF108736846E9C0"/>
it is more agreeable to the tenor of the Gospel, which declares that christians are not only by grace saved through faith, which is supposed to be the first state they are brought into, but also that they are "kept by the power of God, thro' faith unto salvation;" and that if that which they had heard should remain in them, they also should continue in the son and in the father."</P>
<P>Now tho' we could not define obedience so as to know when it was sincere or not, yet we may conceive a certain degree of it to continue us in the faith, and that of course; or that a cer∣tain degree of deviation <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> moral rectitude might destroy our faith; and yet this to be ve∣ry different from saying that sincere obedience is the condition upon which eternal life is given. It is different in it's nature, and different in it's consequences; because a man who considers his future life to depend on his obedience is always under bondage, &amp; has not the freedom of a Son: whereas a son looks upon the inheritance as his own, and though he should think it possible to be cast off, yet as long as he finds in himself no dis∣position to revolt, he is under no fears about it. But the case is very different in him "who thro' fear of death is all his lifetime subject to bondage."</P>
<P>When Mr. Locke mentions that "Adam's one sin had brought death on the Gentiles, from which they were all restored by Christ's death, with addition of eternal bliss and glory to all those who believe in him;" how can he consist∣ently
<PB N="60" REF="032050_0057_0FF108769B827718"/>
with this say elsewhere, that a sincere obe∣dience was also a condition? For the expression of eternal bliss must relate, not to the state of grace here, but to the state of glory hereafter. But perhaps the word obey was omitted by mis∣take. But when he says that those who rely up∣on God and his promises of grace and not upon their own performances, they are the children of Abraham who shall inherit; There it is plain he means the first state of grace to which they were admitted by faith alone; for he had obser∣ved that the blessing promised to Abraham and to his seed was wholly upon the account of faith."</P>
<P>And is it not astonishing th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should con∣fine this inheritance to the state of grace only in this life? St. Paul desired to be found in Christ having the Righteousness of God by faith—he does not mention it as a thing only to instate him in the favor of God, but as what he wished to continue and be found in. And when he was about to be offered up what he seemed to rejoice in was that "he had fought a good fight—that he had kept the faith—that thence∣forth there was laid up for him a crown of righ∣teousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge would give him at that day, and not to him on∣ly, but to all them that loved his appearing." And this we may readily suppose, because such as rely upon the promises of God being children of Abraham, would look for him and rejoice to see him.</P>
