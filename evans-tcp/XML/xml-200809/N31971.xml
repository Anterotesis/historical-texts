<Q>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salva¦tion?</Q>
<BIBL>Heb. ii. 3.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE LORD GOD has no Pleasure in the Death of a Sinner: For as he is loving t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every Man, he would have all Men to come to the Knowledge of the Truth and be saved. Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so loved the World, that he gave his only begot∣ten Son, that all who believe in Him, should not perish, but have everlasting Life. There∣fore, as the Apostle observes in the Context, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ought to give the more earnest Heed to the Thing which we have heard, lest at any Time we should le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them slip; for if the Word spoken by Angels wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stedfast, and every Transgression and Disobedienc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> received a just Recompence of Reward; How sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we escape if we neglect so great Salvation?

<P N="1">1. When GOD saved <HI>Noah</HI> in the Ark, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onderful; but this Salvation is much inferiour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Deliverance of our Souls from the Deluge of GOD's Wrath, which we obtain by the Gospel. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Preservation of <HI>Lot</HI> from being consumed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Sodom</HI> was miraculous; yet the Gospel's saving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the Veng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance of Eternal Fire is greater—We may Instance in <HI>Daniel,</HI> and the three Chil∣dren in the fiery Furnace: Yet still all is not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e compared with the Deliverance accomplished by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>SUS CHRIST, for those that receive Him; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e saves them from the roaring Lion, and the 
<PB N="5" REF="042181_0005_101BA30638F45A50"/>
fiery Furnace, the Smoak of which ascendeth up for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Author of this Salvation is described <HI>Isa.</HI> ix. 6. Even the mighty GOD, the Father of Eternity, the Prince of Peace. It was not a Man, or an Angel; but GOD manifest in the Flesh; yea, that GOD who is over all; of whom all Things were made, and by whom all Things consist. GOD looked to see if there was any to help, and there was not one that could recover Man from his A∣postacy. He must save Man Himself, or Man must perish for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. As to the Means which GOD used to accom∣plish Man's Salvation; He was made in the Like∣ness of sinful Flesh, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 3. That is, He took our human Nature upon Him, with all its Miseries and Infirmities, Sin only excepted. This appeared from His being a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief. And He not only took on Him ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nature, and suffered much Affliction and Tempta∣tion, for near thirty-four Years; but He also laid down his Life for our Ransom. Without shedding of Blood, there was no Remission; and, only the precious Blood of this immaculate Lamb, could have put away Sin: and because of its inestimable Worth it is called The Blood of GOD, <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 28.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Salvation itself, or the Benefits that ac∣crue unto those who are real Christians, I shall con∣sider these chiefly; for this indeed is the very Thing intended by the Apostle. And</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="042181_0006_101BA3080213F3B0"/>
1. Through CHRIST we are saved from the Guilt of all our Sins. For there is no Condemnation to them that are in CHRIST JESUS, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 1. All that believe in Him are justified from all Things. <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 39. By being saved from the Guilt of Sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mean, that free Redemption which the Sinner has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Blood of CHRIST, in the Moment he lays hold on the Promise by Faith. The Words of St. <HI>Peter</HI> confirm this: To Him (i. e. to CHRIST) bear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Prophets Witness, that whosoever believeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Him, should receive Forgiveness of Sins, <HI>Acts</HI> x. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. This is the Gift of GOD. By Grace our Sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re forgiven; for by Grace we are saved through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot of ourselves, it is the Gift of GOD: not of Works, lest any Man should boast, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 9. CHRIST is the sole Cause of our Justi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cation. What He did, and suffered, and ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leads as our High Priest, is the meritorious Cause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f our Aceptance with God; and Faith is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly Condition on which we receive this Atone∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, or, the Instrument by which we apprehend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Love and Righteousness of GOD, in CHRIST <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ESUS.</P>
<P N="2">2. Through CHRIST, Believers are saved from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Power of Sin. This is copiously set forth by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. <HI>Paul,</HI> in the sixth Chapter to the <HI>Romans.</HI> Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ith the Apostle, at the sixth Verse; Knowing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is, that our Old Man is crucified with Him, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Body of Sin might be destroyed, that henceforth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should not serve Sin. And again, at the 14th Verse, 
<PB N="7" REF="042181_0007_101BA30D2BB64AD8"/>
Sin shall not have Dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace. Even under that Grace that bringeth Salvation and that lead∣eth you to renounce all Ungodliness, and Worldly Desires. The Son hath made you free. He hath made you victorious over Sin. You trample it un∣der your Feet. You are crucified with CHRIST. Sin is conquered, and Grace reigns through Righ∣teousness. Those that receive Remission of Sins, in the same Moment they rceive Power to forsake all outward Sin, and to keep down inward Sin. The Law of the Spirit of Life, which is through CHRIST JESUS, has made them free from the Law of Sin and Death.</P>
<P N="3">3. Believers are saved through CHRIST from the Contagion of Sin; for He destroyeth all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rks of the Devil. He brings in everlasting Righte∣ousness. He fully saves His People from their Sins. He heals all their Diseases, and cleanses them from all Unrighteousness. This is largely promised and explained in the thirty-sixth Chapter of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> from the twenty-fifth to the twen∣ty-ninth Verse. GOD promises,</P>
<P N="1">1. That He would cleanse them from all their Filthiness and Idols. 2. Give them a new Heart and a right Spirit. 3. Give them His Spirit. 4. Cause them to walk in His Statutes, to keep His Judgments, and to do them. 5. That they should be saved from all their Uncleannesses. This is 
<PB N="8" REF="042181_0008_101BA30EB72D7918"/>
the Rest that remains for the People of GOD: for ageeable to these Words of the Prophet, are the Words of the Apostle, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. <HI>Col.</HI> 1. <HI>Tit.</HI> 2. All compared and joined together, a∣bundantly prove, That GOD's People who exer∣cise themselves unto Godliness, are not only a chosen Generation, and a Royal Priesthood; but also, an holy Nation, a Peculiar People, who are called out of Darkness into marvellous Light, that they may shew forth the Virtues of CHRIST JESUS. Thus they are Partakers of a divine Na∣ture. The great and precious Promises are ful∣filled in them.</P>
<P N="4">4. They that are delivered from the Body of Sin and Death, are saved likewise from Fear, from all Fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at has Torment, 1 John iv. 18 1. From the Fear of Man. 2. From the Fear of Death; for now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey can triumph, and say, O Death, where is thy Sting! the Sting of Death is Sin; but their Sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re forgiven; therefore the Fear of Death terrifies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem no more. 3. From the Fear of Hell or the Wrath of GOD. It is turned away, <HI>Isa.</HI> xii. 1.</P>
<P N="5">5. Believers are saved from the Power of the Grave. This Corruption shall put on Incorrup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, and this Mortal shall put on Immortality. The Bodies of the Saints shall be fashioned like to the glorious Body of CHRIST, <HI>Phil.</HI> iii. 18. Thus, O Grave, He will be thy Destruction.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Saints are saved from Hell, and all Mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery. All Tears are wiped away from their Eyes,

<P>II. I come in the second Place to shew, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Neglecters of this Salvation, shall be sore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> punished; for as the Apostle saith, If the Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spoken by Angels, on <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> at the Promu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gation of the Law, was stedfast, and every Tran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gression, and Disobedience, received a Just Re∣compence of Reward, How shall we escape if w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣neglect so great Salvation! That is, if we throug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Carelessness or Stubbornness, neglect to make ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Calling and Election sure. If we trample unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Foot the Son of GOD, His Love in dying for us and esteem His precious Blood (with which H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seals His Covenant) an unholy, or commo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thing. The greater the Salvation is, the mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> grievous will the Damnation of those be who ne∣glect it. Nothing can possibly provoke the LORD GOD more, than that Men should slight Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mercy, which He has so stupendously and wonder∣fully manifested in CHRIST His Son. The Son must also be angry, that after all He has done fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> His Vineyard, Men should make light of Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Love, which He has shewed in dying for them. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to explain this Point more particularly. It is ne∣ceflary to shew, That impenitent Sinners of every kind, do not, and cannot escape the Vengeance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> GOD. And</P>
<P N="1">1. Those that never seriously consider their lat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r
<PB N="10" REF="042181_0010_101BA313C13EC960"/>
 End; that never cry for Mercy, or Forgive∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess; those that despise the Grace of CHRIST, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd have no Relish for spiritual Things, have that which condemns them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their own Breasts, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at Monitor Conscience, which GOD has placed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Soul, to bear Witness against their ungodly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds. Their own Hearts condemn them whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey will or no. GOD shines often into their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouls, and shews them the Error of their Ways, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the iminent Danger they are in.—Therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are like the troubled Sea, whose Waters cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p Mire and Dirt. There is no Peace, saith my GOD, to the Wicked, <HI>Isa.</HI> lvii. 20, 21. The Wrath of GOD abideth on them; they are misera∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le. They have no solid Joy, no permanent Plea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure; for GOD has kept Happiness in Himself, and He is resolved it never shall be given to the Dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bedient. All the Happiness of the Wicked is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke the Morning Cloud, and early Dew; there is a Curse on them, and on whatsoever they do. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat even in this Life, God punishes those that a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use His Mercy.</P>
<P>And though the Ungodly may seem to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asy, and joyful, we know it is not so. While <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here is Hardness of Heart, and Ignorance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f CHRIST, the Soul must be miserable; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Righteous have two Heavens, viz. A Heaven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Grace here, and Heaven of Glory in the World to come; even so the Neglecters of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alvation are in a Sense damned while they live; 
<PB N="11" REF="042181_0011_101BA31934675438"/>
the Pangs of Hell get hold on them; the Worm that dies not, is gnawing them; the Dogs of Hell are often let loose on them; especially when they come to die; then they are confounded; all their miserable Comforters forsake them: Die they must. O what breaking of Bones is this? This is unto them the Beginning of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orrow that shall never end. If they look back, they see nothing but Sin and Shame in all their Life: if forward, Hell and Wrath are before them. If they look up, they must see an angry GOD; and if down, an open Gulph! Undoubtedly, the Devil, and his Angels are ready to seize on the Soul immediatly. The Sinner is hedged in on every Side.</P>
<P N="2">2. But suppossing those that neglect the great Salvation could escape here, they cannot escape in the World to come; for all their Works shall be brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto Judgment: They shall not go unpunished: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o; strong is the Lord, who Judgeth them; and He is righteous and terrible too. When the Day of His Wrath is come, the Neglecters of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alvation shall not be able to sit in Judgment, nor and in the Congregation of the Righteous: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooks shall be opened; even their Consciences, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar Witness against them. And another Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all be opened, that is, the Book of Remem∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance, where all their omissions, and Commis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, and all their Vilenesses are registered.—And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, Where shall the Wicked and Ungodly ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar! This is the Day of Vengeance of our GOD, 
<PB N="12" REF="042181_0012_101BA31AC2F003A0"/>
when His Son shall be exalted on the holy Hill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <HI>Sion,</HI> to make His Enemies His Foot-stool. Now he Wicked will call upon the Rocks, and the Mountains to fall upon them and cover them from the Face of Almighty GOD! And in one Sense, they shall get the Thing that they desire: for the Rocks will fall upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to grind them to Pow∣der. Then shall they be bound in Bundles to burn them up, <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii. 30.</P>
<P>Again, The Vengeance of GOD will still pur∣sue them; they shall be cast into the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone, which is the second Death, <HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 8. Where the Smoke of their Torments, ascend up for ever, and ever! Now the Wicked are in their own Place: and because they would not have the Fear of the LORD; they would not have CHRIST to reign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over them; they rejected His Counsel, and would none of His Reproof; therefore He laughs at their Calamity, and mocks when their Fear cometh. All the Curses of GOD; all the Threat∣mings in the Bible, are now inflicted on them The Vials of GOD's Wrath are poured down upon them. Here are Weeping and Lamentation an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Woe. Thus they that neglect the great Salvation shall go into everlasting Fire, and have their Portion with the Devil and his Angels, where their Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall not die neither shall their fire be quenche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> You see clearly the Wicked cannot Escape neith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Day of Judgment, or in Eternity. But GO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 
<PB N="13" REF="042181_0013_101BA31F5D51AD20"/>
will thus avenge himself on his Adversaries.</P>
<P>III. I come in the last Place to apply the pre∣ceding Considerations. And</P>
<P N="1">1. You may observe how transcendent the Deliver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ance accomplished by CHRIST is; how far superio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to all those wonderful Works and Deliverances which GOD wrought in old Times. We are now saved; saved in the Ark of the Covenant, eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> CHRIST. He is our hiding Place and our Rock <HI>Isa.</HI> xxxii. 2. We are saved from a Deluge of Wrat and Misery, much worse than that which destroye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the old World; but more of this hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do you not discern two remarkable particula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> couched under the Second Head?

takers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light: to come to GOD's eternal Joy! O what a Salva∣tion is this! My Brethren, seek it while it may be found. Never rest, till your Souls are released from the Bondage of Corruption, and brought into the Liberty of the Sons of GOD. Now is the Time that the Grace of GOD must appear to you, to save you from all Sin? The Blood and Righte∣ousness of CHRIST must be applied, and brought into your Souls. We must now know CHRIST for ourselves. Except He wash us, we have no Part with Him. Wash us, O LORD, and make us clean! O deliver us from the Body of this Death! Pray and cry, till you know that GOD is your Sal∣vation. Cry for the Spirit of Adoption, to purify your Hearts. Believe for the Remission of your Sins. Do not deceive your own Souls. If CHRIST does not dwell in your Hearts by Faith; if He does not shed abroad His Love there, your Faith, your Religion is vain. If ever you enter into Glory, you must be justified, in the Name of the LORD JESUS, and sanctified, by the Spirit of our God. All the Body of Sin must be destroyed. That is, all old Thing must be done away, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 17. And this must be done here, even in the present World. For there is no Work, nor Device, nor Wisdom, nor Knowledge in the Grave, whither we go.</P>

shall be punished both in Time, and in Eternity. GOD has cursed them, and they cannot be blessed. They shall have a trembling Heart, and failing of Eyes; neither shall they find Rest for Body or Soul. My dear Friends, let me freely speak unto you; and do not count me your Enemy for telling you the Truth. Have you not neglected this Sal∣vation? Have you not made light of the Message GOD has sent! He has warned you to flee from the Wrath to come; but alas, you are many of you yet in your Sins. O make no more lame Excuses. Let not your Farms, your Merchandize, or any of the Cares of this Life, take up your Hearts, and all your Time. Count all but Dross and Dung, in Comparison of the Saving Knowledge of CHRIST JE∣SUS our Lord. O kiss the Son, lest He be angry with you, and swear in His Wrath, you shall never taste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of His Supper!</P>
<P>Now pluck out the right Eye. Cut off the right Hand. Lay aside every Weight; And whatever Sin does most easily beset you. Except you are thus minded; unless you put this in Execution, You cannot escape the Damnation of Hell. GOD will bring you to Judgment, O you stout-hearted stiff-necked Sinners! Ye Enemies of GOD; ye Heirs of Woe; ye murderers of your own Souls. Repent, repent. Turn to GOD while Mercy's Doo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is open, before you are consigned over to the Tor∣mentors.—You know you are not happy now No; How should you, while you neglect the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Salvation? And the Misery you now feel in you Body and Mind, is only the Beginning of Sor∣rows. Justice is punishing you. The Arm of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord is lifted up to cut you down. You hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cumbered the Ground, GOD knows, too long.</P>
<P>O GOD, in the Midst of Wrath, remember Mercy. Spare us good LORD, till we recover our spiritual Health; till our Souls are washed in the Blood of the Lamb.—Do not say, "We can∣not bear this Man; we hate him; he never pro∣phesies Good concerning us." I can prophesy no better concerning you, while you are living in Re∣bellion against GOD. I dare not speak smooth Things to you. No; I ask you, How can you stand before the righteous Judge? If He was <HI>now</HI> to require your Soul of you, How could you an∣swer before Him, for having neglected the great Salvation? Would your vain and worldly Excuses satisfy Him? I warn you this Day, to cast away your Transgressions. I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you, that if you do not; these Words which you here this Day, will increase your Damnation to all Eternity; and how then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall we dwell with everlasting Burnings? O that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes Fountains of Tears, that I might weep over your dying Souls! O that I could perswade you to be recon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iled to God!</P>
<P>And now lest any should utterly despair, let me tell you GOD is willing to forgive you all. After

all you Have done, He will take you into his favour. Here is a <HI>great Salvation</HI> for <HI>great Sinners.</HI> Come, though your Sins be as Scarlet, They can be made as white as Snow, in the Blood of CHRIST. Be encou∣raged. Draw near and hear, and your Soul shall live. JESUS the Sinner's Friend is ready to receive you. He came to save such poor, vile, helpless Sinners as we are. Methinks your Hearts begin to relent. You seem desirous to see JESUS. LORD carry on the Work Thou hast begun.</P>
<P>Yet, saith the LORD, I am willing to have Mercy upon you, to forgive all your Sins, to heal all your Diseases. My Heart is filled with Mercy to∣wards you. I love you still; and I rejoice to bless you, and make you happy. And to convince you of my great Love for your Souls, I gave my only begotten Son to die for you. I have also sent you my Spirit, and Messengers to woo you, and be∣seech you to be reconciled to Me. And O Sin∣ners, will ye now hearken unto Me? Will ye b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wise, and accept this Mercy? Will you be forgi∣ven, and that freely? Are you satisfied to cast away your Transgressions? and be made the Sons and Daughters of the LORD Almighty? Can you hold out any more? Does not your Misery move you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Does not my Love constrain you? O let something prevail! I am not willing that any of you should perish. I swear unto you, I have no Pleasure i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Death. O believe this, and now receive my Son. I give Him to you freely. Take Him an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

use Him as you stand in Need of Him. Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Him be for Light, and for Comfort, for Righ∣teousness, and for Strength unto you. And more∣over, I will give you My Holy Spirit, to guide you and assist you; and still more, after I have pre∣pared you for Glory, I will give you a Crown and a Kingdom. You shall sit at My Table and dwell in my House, and have the Privi∣leges of Sons. Your Sins shall not be menti∣oned to you. I will love you as though you had never offended Me.</P>
<P>Now I say, O Sinner, If thou didst here the LORD speak thus unto thee, sure thou wouldes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> leave thy Sins, and accept of Mercy. Why the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these are in Effect, the very Words of GOD▪ He reasons with you, after this Manner. We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may you and I make answer and say, it is true LORD I am a vile, weak Sinner. I condemn myself▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abhor myself as in Dust and Ashes. And O my GOD, I admire and embrace thy Mercy: I fly to Thee for Succour, and Salvation! I am desti∣tute of all Good. O be it unto me according to thy Word! Receive me graciously, and love m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> freely. Sanctify me wholly, and save me eter¦nally. Is this the Language of thine Heart, O thou afflicted, and tossed with Tempest and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> comforted? Be of good Courage then; thou ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not far from the Kingdom of GOD. The Time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Redemption is at hand. Come LORD JESUS▪ come quickly.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="042181_0020_101BA3316C352F38"/>
To conclude. I beseech you never to rest till your Hearts are thus broken; till you are deeply sensible of your lost Estate, and fly to Him for Mercy. And ye that know what is in your Heart, Cry, yea, cry mightily unto the LORD till he gives you rest for your Soul.—Again, you that are justified freely, thro' the Redemption that is in JESUS CHRIST, see that ye walk as becometh the Gospel. Be ye Followers of GOD as dear Chil∣dren; and walk in Love, even the Love of GOD and Man. Abound in every Good Word and Work.—Your Prayers, and Tears, and Hearing and Communicating, will not indeed merit heaven. JESUS CHRIT hath done this.</P>
<P>Yet you are called upon to walk in these Ordinances of GOD blameless. You are created <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n CHRIST JESUS unto Good Works, in which God has appointed you should walk. Do not therefore imagine that I have been making void the Law thro Faith; GOD forbid, for I know the Law is Holy, and the Commandment Holy, and Just and Good: that is, if a Man use it lawfully; for the End that GOD gave it; namely to be a School¦master to bring us to CHRIST; and, after we are justified, to be a Rule of Life unto us. Let us thus love the Law of the LORD, and keep the Covenant of our GOD, that we may prove what is that Good, and acceptable and perfect Will of GOD! To whom be the Glory, Kingdom and Dominion, through our LORD JESUS CHRIST, World without End. Amen.</P>
