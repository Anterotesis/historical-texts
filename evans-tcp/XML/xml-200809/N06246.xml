<P>The Governor opened the Conference, directing his Discourse to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and spoke as follows.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1757" UNIT="year"/> I AM very glad to meet you once more with your People, and some of your Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> according to your Agreement with me at this Place in <HI>November</HI> last. The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> you have brought down with you on this Occasion, and the Pains you have taken to carry the News of our good Dispositions for Peace to so great a Distance, confirms the good Opinion we have always had of you, and shews the Sincerity of the Professions you have made of your earnest Desire to restore the Friendship and Bro∣therly <PB N="4" REF="007921_0004_102E019853BB2D90"/>Love that always subsisted between us and the <HI>Indians,</HI> till your foolish young Men were seduced by the evil Spirit, and turned against us.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung, <HI>and Brethren of the</HI> Ten-united-Nations,</P>
<P>We are now met together to finish, by the Assistance of the Almighty, the Great Work of Peace, and to make a new Chain of Friendship so bright, that it shall never rust, and so strong, that it shall never be in the Power of wicked Spirits to break it, that we may always hereafter be as one Man, with but one Heart and one Head. I invite you to join heartily and sincerely with me herein by this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>You may remember, that when we were here last Fall, I asked you what was the Cause of the Breach between our Brethren the <HI>Delawares</HI> and us; whether we, the People of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> had done you any Injury; and desired you would open your Hearts, and tell me your Mind freely. In answer to this you told me, that your foolish and ignorant young Men, when they saw the Proceedings of our Enemy, the <HI>French</HI> King, and believed the Things that were told them, were persuaded by this false hearted King to strike your Brethren the <HI>English</HI>; and that the Cause why the Blow came the harder on us was, that the Proprietaries had defrauded you of some of your Land, and that you had been treated in the same Man∣ner in the <HI>Jerseys</HI>; but that this was not the principal Cause of your striking us. I was wil∣ling to enquire into the Truth of this Charge at that Time, but you declined it, because few of the <HI>Indians</HI> then present originally owned those Lands; but said, that you would endeavour to bring as many of them down as you could find to the next Meeting.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>According to the Promise I made you at our last Treaty, I laid all our Proceedings before Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> who, you have been often told, is appointed by our Great King his sole Agent for <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs in this District, to take Care of them as a Father, that no one may wrong them. Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> has since deputed your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Friend, Mr. <HI>George Crog∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an,</HI> who is well acquainted with your Affairs and Language, to act in his Behalf, to attend this Treaty, and enquire into every Grievance you may have suffered, either from your Bre∣thren of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> or the neighbouring Provinces.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I took Care also to send Copies of our several Treaties with you to <HI>England,</HI> where they were laid before the King's Ministers, who, being desirous that Justice should be done you, ordered that Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> should enquire into the Foundation of your Charge against this Province, in order that you may receive Satisfaction, in case any Injury has been done you.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I have freely opened my Heart to you, and am ready, with Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> His Majesty's Deputy Agent, whenever you think proper, to hear any Thing you may have to say to us about the Grievances you may think you labour under from this Province.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When the Governor had ended his Speech, I spoke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung, <HI>and you my Brethren the Sachems and Warriors of the Ten Nations you represent at this Meeting,</HI></P>
<P>You have been informed by your Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> that the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> your Fa∣ther, has appointed Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> Baronet, to be His Majesty's chief Agent and Su∣perintendent of the Affairs of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> their Allies and Dependents in this District of <HI>America,</HI> and he has appointed me his Deputy, and ordered me to attend this Meeting, and hear any Complaints you have to make against your Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> in respect to his defraud∣ing you of the Lands mentioned in the Conference you held with this Government last Fall in this Town; or any other Injuries you have received from any of His Majesty's Subjects in this District. I am now ready to hear what you have to say; and I assure you, in the Name of Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> I will do every Thing in my Power to have all Differences amicably adjusted to your Satisfaction, agreeable to his Orders and Instructions to me.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>When I had delivered my Speech, the Governor told <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> that we had done for the present; and that whenever he was ready to give an Answer, we should be ready to hear him. Then <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> replied, That he had something to say now; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ressing himself to the Governor and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ spoke as follows.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>I will let you know in a few Words what my Desire is. I kindly receive your Words this Day: They are true, and make my Heart glad. By this Belt (holding up a Belt) I let you 
<PB N="5" REF="007921_0005_102E019A8C238F28"/>
know I will speak To-morrow. I think it proper to speak my Mind with Openness. I think it my Duty to remember the Conduct of my foolish young Men. I see a great deal of Mischief done. I will first begin with cleaning up the Blood that has been shed, and removing the dead Bodies out of the Way: After that, I will make known my Grievances. I remember what Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> said to me by the Messengers he sent to me: I sent back to him, by the same Messengers, and desired him, as he was a wiser Man than I, and of greater Abilities, that he would be strong, and lend his Assistance to cure this Wound.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> had ended his Speech, he told the Governor he thought he should be ready to speak To-morrow Morning at Eight o'Clock;—and that Time was accordingly ap∣pointed for the next Meeting.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>I desired the Favour of Mr. <HI>Jacob Duché</HI> to assist Mr. <HI>Trent</HI> in taking down the Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> spoke to the Governor and myself, desiring us to give Attention; then directing his Speech to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and all His Subjects, spoke as follows.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>YOU remember that you sent to me to come down to you, and invited me to bring down with me as many of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> as I could, by Reason of the Difficulty of the Times. You then said to me, Brother, you are weak, I am strong: If you come down, I will put away all the Difference and Uneasiness that has happened, and will make a lasting Peace. Now, as I have brought some from each of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> with me, I would have you remember your Promise, and exert your Power. Also, remember our Women and Chil∣dren, that it may be well hereafter. Also, as you must remember the Blood that has been shed, and the dead Bodies that lie scattered up and down, I would have you join with me to remove these out of the Way, that we may see one another Face to Face, and after this we will proceed to other Business.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>As you are a great deal stronger than I, you must exert your Power. When Differences arise between two Brothers, when one comes and makes Proposals of Peace, if the other does not accept them, nothing can be done. Now, as much Blood is spilt, I desire you will join with me to clear this away, and when that is done, we will proceed to other Business.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>According to the Promise I made you, that I would invite as many of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> as I could, I have now brought with me as many as I could, who are here present to witness what shall be transacted; but, in order to make a lasting and durable Peace, we must all ex∣ert our Abilities. When any Persons are engaged to lift a great Weight out of the Way, if all do not exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their Strength, they cannot remove it; but if all join, they will easily re∣move it. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Parts, gather up the Leaves that have been sprinkled with Blood; we gather up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ood, the Bodies and Bones; but when we look round, we see no Place where to put them, but when we look up, we see the Great Spir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> It is our Duty therefore to join in Prayer, that he would hide these Things, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never be seen by <PB N="6" REF="007921_0006_102E019EE8AAFAF0"/>our Posterity, and that the Great Spirit would bless our Children, that they may hereafter live in Love together; that it may never be in the Power of the evil Spirit, or any evil mind∣ed Persons, to cause any Breach between our Pesterity.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of seventeen Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As you remember you invited me to bring down some of the <HI>Ten Nations,</HI> so now some from each of them are here present, particularly some from my Uncles the <HI>Five Nations.</HI> When we had endeavoured, as much as in our Power, to remove the dead Bodies, and the Mischief past, you also invited me to come and take hold of your Hand. We accordingly now come, and take hold of one of your Hands, and the <HI>Five Nations</HI> also come and take hold of the other Hand, that we may all stand together as one Man with one Heart. This now being done, when we look up, and see the clear Light, we shall enjoy it; we shall also enjoy, in Peace and Quietness, what the Land produces; and we shall enjoy the Comforts of the Day, and the Comforts of the Night; we shall lie down in Peace, and rise in Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of twelve Rows, strung on Cords.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Reason of this great Cloud of Mischief that has been past is, that our old Standers, or Forefathers, never took regular Methods to have a lasting Peace: They never looked for∣ward for their Children: They only had a View of this that decays, and what lies round about upon the Earth. When they came into Council, they only talked about the Things on the Earth, that are soon gone. They ought to have looked forward, and to have made such Agreements on both Sides, that their Children after might never disagree. And as we see their Mismanagement, let us do better, that we, as long as we live, may be faithful, and that by this our Meeting together our Children hereafter may enjoy a lasting Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eleven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You remember, according to your Orders, that Messengers have been sent to carry your Messages to distant Parts among us, in order to promote this good, this important Work of Peace, on which our Lives depend. One of these Messengers is now in a dangerons Condi∣tion, being shot by one of your young Men. Do not be too much grieved; but as I desire to be used with Justice, according to your Laws, I insist, if this young Man die, that the Man who shot him may be tried by your Laws, and die also, in the Presence of some of our People, who may witness it to all the Nations, that their Brethren the <HI>English</HI> have done them Justice. And if any Thing of the like Kind should happen on our Parts, we will do you the same Justice; that is, if any of our People shall murder any of yours, we will de∣liver up the Murderer, to be tried by your Laws. And as the Relations of the young Man must be grieved, I desire, as you have it in your Power, that you would remove the Grief and Sorrow from their Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor then acquainted <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that we would take into Consideration what he had now said; and when we were ready to give an Answer, we would let him know.</P>
<P>As we were rising the King, by his Interpreter, told me, that what he had now said was of great Importance; he desired therefore we would take Time to confider it well; that he would wait with Patience till we were ready to give him an Answer.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>YOUR Memory serves you faithfully, with Respect to what was pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed by each of us in the last <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onferences.</P>
<P>Our warmest A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>edgments are due to you for your just Performance of your Engage∣ments. You have made known our good Dispositions far and wide. You have brought <PB N="7" REF="007921_0007_102E01A186E05488"/>down your Uncles, and some of each of the other Nations with whom you are joined. We are pleased to observe they have hearkened to you, and are come so well disposed to con∣clude and establish a firm and durable Peace. We return you very hearty Thanks in Behalf of His Majesty King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> the People of this Province, and all His other Subjects.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are sensible with you, that unless we both exert the utmost of our Strength, we shall not be able to accomplish the great Work we are mutually engaged in.</P>
<P>Whilst we see the dead Bodies of our People lying uncovered, and exposed to ravenous Birds, it is against Nature, and all the Principles of Religion and Humanity, to proceed to the Confirmation of Peace.</P>
<P>We therefore, in Conjunction with you, diligently search for, and collect together, not only their dead Bodies and scattered Bones, but the very Leaves, Grass, and every Thing else that their Blood has touched; and join with you in looking up to Heaven, from whence the God of Peace beholds with Delight our Advances to Reconciliation, Concord and Unity. We pray he may cast a Veil over all that has happened in these unhappy Times, that it may be no longer remembered. We supplicate his Almighty Goodness to pardon all that is past. We pray him to dispose all the People of this, and the succeeding Generations, to the latest Posterity, to live in Love together. We entreat he will never permit the evil Spirit to en∣ter so far into our Hearts, or evil minded Men so far into our Councils, as to interrupt the Course of Friendship, or blast the smallest Leaf in the Tree of Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Having now collected the dead Bodies, we agree with you to stand together, <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> as one Man, with one Heart; we lay hold with you, your Uncles, and the <HI>Ten Na∣tions,</HI> of the Belt of Friendship; we hold it fast with all our Strength. We bring with us all the Sincerity and Warmth of honest and upright Hearts. We rejoice to behold again the Light of the Sun shining in a clear Sky. We promise ourselves that, with the Blessing of the good Spirit, your Endeavours, united with ours, will be able to secure to us, and to our Children, and Childrens Children, durable Peace and Happiness, so that we may quietly enjoy the various Comforts of Life with which this fruitful Country abounds, and may sleep in Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Though our Forefathers and yours might make some Mistakes, and might not see far enough into the Consequences of some of their Measures, yet in general we can truly say, they were ever kindly disposed to one another; they were open and upright in their Inten∣tions; they lived together in perfect Peace, and the mutual Exchange of good Offices.</P>
<P>It is very commendable in you to remind us that they have not been altogether regular, but confined their Views to the then present Times, and to the Interest of their own Ge∣neration, not so much consulting as they should have done the Good of future Generations. We shall be glad to join with you in promoting one general Interest, that may extend to the latest Posterity. We will lay aside all narrow partial Regards, and put Matters on a lasting Foundation, and endeavour to exceed our Ancestors, not only in the Goodness of our Mea∣sures, but in a more careful and exact Manner of doing Business.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have observed what you say, with respect to one of your Messengers. The Accident grieves us. In such Times, <HI>Indians</HI> should not go single, or into inhabited Parts, without proper Passports and Escorts.—We have careless and unthinking Men amongst us; we have bad Men too, who have mischievous Hearts. The Man who is supposed to have committed this Act is in Goal, and (in case the Messenger dies) shall be tried by our Laws, which re∣quire Blood for Blood, in the Presence of such <HI>Indians</HI> as you shall appoint to attend the Trial, of which you shall have due Notice. It is a Matter firmly settled, by repeated Treaties, between us and the <HI>Indians,</HI> that whenever an <HI>Englishman</HI> kills an <HI>Indian,</HI> or an <HI>Indian</HI> kills an <HI>Englishman,</HI> the Murderer, or Person offending, shall be tried by our Laws, in the Pre∣sence of both Nations.</P>

<P><HI>Brother</HI> Moses Tetamy,</P>
<P>You are the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> of the young Man who has been unfortunately wounded. It gives us great Concern that any Thing of this Kind should happen. We have employed the most skilful Doctor we have amongst us to take Care of him, and we pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Almighty would bless the Medicines that are administered for his Cure. We by this String of Wam∣pum <PB N="8" REF="007921_0008_102E01A32F618058"/>remove the Grief from your Heart, and desire no Uneasiness may remain there. We have assured our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that strict Justice shall be done on the Trial, and we choose that you yourself should be a Witness of it.</P>

Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> who has nominated Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> his Deputy. I am glad to hear this News, and to see the Man that is appointed. I hope, Brother, that it will be well accepted by both of us. It is our Duty to respect the Person that the King has appointed, and with Sincerity of Heart to join together, that as the present Business is well begun, it may end so. I hope he will execute his Commission with Justice.

<P>After I have opened the Passage from your Heart and Mind, that you may see and understand, by this Belt I desire you may fully understand what I now say. It is plain the Proceedings of our Ancestors were shorter than they ought to have been, in Respect and Behalf of their Children; and also their own everlasting Peace in the World to come. You may easily see the Reason of the gloomy and dark Days; they have proceeded from the Earth. Our Misunderstanding or Mismanagement has proceeded from the Earth, as well as our Diffe∣rences and Grievances that have passed and repassed. Though it was not the principal Cause that made us strike our Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> yet it has caused the Stroke to come harder than it otherwise would have come. Now it lies much in your Power to look strictly into your Hearts, as we always prefer and acknowledge you above us in Abilities, Strength and Knowledge. And as it lies a great deal in your Power to know whether what I have said be true or not, it depends much on you, Brother, that it may be openly and publickly declared and published to the Province or Provinces under the Government of the Great King, both to his Satis∣faction, and to the Satisfaction of those appointed to manage this Affair.—Brother, now as we have met together Face to Face to speak with great Sincerity, I will endeavour to lay every Thing plain before you, not to cover one Part, but to lay every Thing before you, that you may see plainly, in order that we may have true Satisfaction from one another, and that what may be proved to be our Right and Due, may be established for ever in a durable and lasting Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I would desire also that you would look with all Diligence, and see from whence our Dif∣ferences have sprung. You may easily see they have sprung from the Land or Earth, which was mentioned before, though it was not the principal Thing. If regular Methods had been formerly taken for an Habitation or Residence for the poor <HI>Indians</HI> in this Land, this would not have come to pass. Now as it lies much in your Power to search particularly into what was mentioned before, with respect to the Land, which was the Cause of our Differences, <PB N="9" REF="007921_0009_102E01A5B1C472B0"/>if I now can prevail with you, as I hope I shall, honestly to do what may be consistent with Justice, then I will, with a loud Voice, speak, and the Nations shall hear me. Then it depends on you, Brother, as I shall speak with a loud Voice, and as you are of great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Abilities than I, to assist me, that what I speak to the Nations may be true, and that when I have made Proclamation with a loud Voice, by your Assistance, the Nations may hear and receive it with great Joy.</P>
<P>Gave a Belt.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Pumpshire,</HI> being asked to explain what was meant by the first Part of this Speech, he said, the Meaning was this: The Land is the Cause of our Differences; that is, our being unhappily turned out of the Land, is the Cause: And though the first Settlers might pur∣chase the Land fairly, yet they did not act well, nor do the <HI>Indians</HI> Justice; for they ought to have reserved some Place for the <HI>Indians.</HI> Had that been done, these Differences would not have happened.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have now in a few Words to let you know what my Inclination and Desire is, agreeable to what I have said. I now put it into your Power to make a lasting Peace, and that I may have my reasonable Enjoyment from this Land; as we are sensible that this Land was made by that Almighty Power that has made all Things, and has given this Land to us. I was the first to whom he gave it; and as it pleased him to convey you to us, and unite us in Friendship in the Manner already mentioned, which was well known by our Ancestors, it is now in your Power, and depends entirely on your Care and faithful Diligence, that it may not be broken as it has been; and if it be broken, it will be owing to you. I think it is my Duty to mention to you in publick, that I will comply with all Submission. This I ask, that I may have some Place for a Settlement, and for other good Purposes, in which we may both agree; but as I am a free Agent as well as you, I must not be bound up, but have Li∣berty to settle where I please.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> informed the Governor, that he had done for this Time, and left it to the Go∣vernor's Pleasure to appoint a Time to answer him.</P>
<P>As the Governor had by Letter informed me, that <HI>Teedyuscung's</HI> Speech appeared to him dark and confused, and desired me to call a Meeting in private with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and know what they meant; I accordingly, on the 30th of <HI>July,</HI> at Five a Clock in the Morn∣ing, sent for the King, and some of his Counsellors, and desired them to call a Council and confider well the Speeches the King had made, and afterwards to explain them to me. At Half after Nine o'Clock, King <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> with <HI>Jepiscauhunb, Epoweyowallund, Penawagh∣wottind, Lepaghpetund, Kuhtanamaku, Jangepapawey, Weneywalika,</HI> his Counsellors, and <HI>John Pumpshire,</HI> Interpreter, met at my House, and explained his Speeches as follows.</P>
<P>The Complaints I made last Fall, I yet continue. I think some Lands have been bought by the Proprietary, or his Agents, from <HI>Indians</HI> who had not a Right to sell, and to whom the Lands did not belong. I think also, when some Lands have been sold to the Proprietary by <HI>Indians</HI> who had a Right to sell to a certain Place, whether that Purchase was to be mea∣sured by Miles or Hours Walk, that the Proprietaries have, contrary to Agreement or Bar∣gain, taken in more Lands than they ought to have done, and Lands that belonged to others. I therefore now desire that you will produce the Writings and Deeds by which you hold the Land, and let them be read in publick, and examined, that it may be fully known from what <HI>Indians</HI> you have bought the Lands you hold, and how far your Purchases extend, that Copies of the Whole may be laid before King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> and published to all the Pro∣vinces under his Government. What is fairly bought and paid for I make no further Demands about: But if any Lands have been bought of <HI>Indians</HI> to whom these Lands did not belong, and who had no Right to sell them, I expect a Satisfaction for these Lands. And if the Proprietaries have taken in more Lands than they bought of true Owners, I expect likewise to be paid for that. But as the Persons to whom the Proprietaries may have sold these Lands, which of Right belonged to me, have made some Settlements, I do not want to disturb them, or to force them to leave them, but I expect a full Satisfaction shall be made to the true Owners for these Lands, though the Proprietaries, as I said before, might have bought them from Persons that had no Right to sell them.</P>
<P>With respect to our Settlement, we intend to settle at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and we want to have certain Boundaries fixed between you and us; and a certain Tract of Land fixed, which it shall not be lawful for us or our Children ever to sell, nor for you, or any of your Children, ever to buy. We would have the Boundaries fixed all round, agreeable to the Draught we 
<PB N="10" REF="007921_0010_102E01A7E6265F68"/>
give you that we may not be pressed on any Side, but have a certain Country fixed for our own Use, and the Use of our Children for ever.</P>
<P>And as we intend to make a Settlement at <HI>Wyoming,</HI> and to build different Houses from what we have done heretofore, such as may last not only for a little Time, but for our Chil∣dren after us; we desire you will assist us in making our Settlements, and send us Persons to instruct us in building Houses, and in making such Necessaries as shall be needful; and that Persons be sent to instruct us in the Christian Religion, which may be for our future Wel∣fare, and to instruct our Children in Reading and Writing; and that a fair Trade be establish∣ed between us, and such Persons appointed to conduct and manage these Affairs as shall be agreeable to us.</P>
<P>I then asked him, as Fort <HI>Augusta</HI> was within the Lands he desired to be assigned to them, whether he would acknowledge that Fortress to belong to the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for the Use of His Subjects in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and all His other Subjects; and whether he would not be willing it should continue as a Trading-House, not only for the Good of us the <HI>English,</HI> and the Nations he represents, but of all the Nations that now are, or may be hereafter, in Al∣liance with us; and whether he will not engage, in Conjunction with the <HI>English,</HI> to defend it against any of His Majesty's Enemies that may come against it?</P>
<P>To which the King, in Behalf of the Nations he represents, replied, That he agrees that that Fort shall belong to the <HI>English</HI>; that it shall continue as a Trading-House; and he and his People, in Conjunction with their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> engage to defend it against any of His <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty's Enemies that shall come to attack it.</P>

<P>King <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> desired that (before the Governor spoke) what passed between him and me in a private Conference Yesterday should be read in publick, which was accordingly done, and in∣terpreted to the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then the Governor made the following Speech.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung, <HI>and Brethren Sachems and Warriors of the</HI> Ten Nations,</P>
<P>IT gives me Pleasure to hear you declare your Satisfaction at the Appointment our Great King has been pleased to make of Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> to be the Superintendent of the Affairs of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and that Sir <HI>William</HI> had appointed Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> to be his Deputy; and further, to hear you so fully and openly acknowledge it to be the Duty of both of us to respect the Person whom the King has thought fit to entrust with so important a Commission. I thank you for these dutiful Expressions, and do not in the least doubt but they come from the Bottom of your Hearts.—I assure you, Brethren, I shall heartily join my Endeavours to yours, that the good Work of Peace, so well begun, may be happily finished to our mutual Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You say that the Proceedings of our Ancestors were shorter than they ought to have been, in Respect and Behalf of their Children; and also of their own everlasting Peace. Bro∣ther, our Ancestors of this Province have been always esteemed a good, honest and wise Peo∣ple, and have always been distinguished for their brotherly Love and kind Treatment of the <PB N="11" REF="007921_0011_102E01AA35C2C1A0"/><HI>Indians,</HI> and their upright Dealing with them in their Publick Transactions. You say that the Cause of our Differences proceeded from the Land, and advise us to look strictly into our Hearts for the Truth of this. Brother, we have, according to your Desire, looked into our Hearts, and are not sensible that any of our Transactions with the <HI>Indians,</HI> either with Re∣spect to Land, or otherwise, could have given Reason for the unhappy Breach betwen us. You have been so honest as to declare on all Occasions, that the Land was not the principal Cause why you struck us, but was only a Reason why the Stroke came the harder on us. As then, it was not the Cause of our first Differences, it ought not to be any Obstacle to an immediate Conclusion of the Peace, which we are now met together with such good Intentions to establish. However we may differ in Opinion about Matters of Property, these are trifling Considerations, compared to the important Affair of uniting together in the firm Bands of Friendship. Let us therefore for the present suspend them, and all Matters of less Mo∣ment, and apply ourselves in the first Place heartily to the Great Work of Peace, so much wished for by both of us, and put Things on such a Footing, that the Great King over the Waters, and His Subjects, and all the <HI>Indians,</HI> shall be pleased with it.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You say, that if you can prevail with us to do you Justice in your Complaint about Land, you will then with a loud Voice speak, and the Nations shall hear you. Brother, I must now inform you, that immediately after our last Treaty, I sent to the Proprietaries a Copy of the Complaints you then made of their defrauding you of your Lands, and received their An∣swer to it some Days before I set out to meet you here, wherein they express the greatest Con∣cern that you, who they conceive have been so well treated both by their Father, <HI>William Penn,</HI> and themselves, should charge them with Crimes of so heinous a Nature as Fraud and Forgery, by which their Reputation (which to them and every honest Man is dearer than Life itself) is so deeply wounded. Your Complaint has likewise been laid before the King's Ministers, who, looking upon it as a Matter of great Importance, determined that it should be carefully enquired into, and examined, before some Person no ways concerned in Interest, on whose Honesty and Judgment they could depend; and therefore appointed Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> to hear the Particulars of your Charge, and the Proprietary's Defence, and lay the whole Matter before His Majesty for his Royal Determination, in order that he may do you Justice himself, if you are injured. Our great King looks on you as His Children; and therefore His Ministers have directed the same Method to be taken in hearing the Merits of your Complaint, as is used among His own Subjects, with this Difference only, that their Disputes are finally settled by Judges appointed for that Purpose; whereas, in your Case, His Majesty will determine it himself.</P>
<P>Before I received the Orders of His Majesty's Ministers, that your Complaints should be heard before Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> I fully intended, at this Meeting, to call on the Proprie∣taries Agents to answer the Charge you made against them, and to have the Matter strictly enquired into; but as I am the King's Servant, and bound by Duty as well as Inclination to obey His Orders, and His Majesty's Deputy Agent, Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> who is now present, in∣forms me he has no Power to suffer any Altercations on this Complaint, and that he does not think it would be for the Good of His Majesty's Service, I must refer you on this Oc∣casion to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> to whom I shall send proper Persons to represent the Proprie∣taries, with Records, Deeds and Evidences, to shew the Justice of their Title at any Time he shall appoint, of which he will give Notice to you, and all Persons concerned. As that Gentleman is known to be a good Friend to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and a Man of Honour and Integrity, it gives me great Pleasure to find he is well approved of by you, and I do not doubt but you will most chearfully agree to leave the Examination of your Claims to him, and concur in the Method His Majesty has directed for settling our Differences, in which you will be certain of having strict Justice done you.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I could give you many Instances of the great Affection and Regard the Proprietaries have for you, and all the <HI>Indians</HI>; and that they set a far greater Value on your Friendship, than on any private Interest or Advantage to themselves; they have lately given to you and the World a most convincing Proof of this. You no Doubt have heard, that the Proprietaries, about three Years ago, at a general Meeting of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> held at <HI>Albany,</HI> fairly and openly purchased of them a great Country, lying on the West Side of the River <HI>Sasquehannah;</HI> but upon its being represented, that some of the <HI>Indian</HI> Tribes were dissatisfied with the Ex∣tent of that Grant beyond the <HI>Allegheny</HI> Hills, the Proprietaries chearfully agreed to surren∣der, and give up again to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Lands Westward of those Hills, and have given their Agents Orders to release it to them at the proposed Meeting before Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> and to settle Boundaries with them.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="007921_0012_102E01ABDC0372A0"/>
<HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have considered what you said about a Settlement for yourselves and your Posterity, and am informed by Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> that <HI>Wyoming</HI> is the Place you would chuse to settle at.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietaries have never granted away any Lands, though within the Limits of this Province, without first purchasing them of the <HI>Indians</HI>; and having never bought of them the Lands between <HI>Shamokin</HI> and <HI>Wyoming,</HI> they have therefore never laid Claim to them under any <HI>Indian</HI> Purchase, and expresly desire this may be told to the <HI>Indians,</HI> lest evil-dis∣posed Persons should have suggested any Thing to the contrary; and, in the Name of the Proprietaries, I now disclaim all such Right, of which I would have you take Notice. I am pleased you have made Choice of that Place; it is perfectly agreeable to me, and I assure you I will heartily concur with you in using all the Means in my Power to have these Lands settled upon you and your Posterity, agreeable to your Request. As to the other Purposes for which you desire this Settlement of Lands, they are so reasonable, that I make no Doubt but, on my Recommendation of them to the Assembly, they will chearfully enable me to comply with them.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have now answered the Speeches you made me the other Day, and, I hope, to your Satisfaction, as I agree with you to submit the Differences about Lands to the Great King, which is your own Desire. I now assure you that I am heartily disposed and ready, with the King's Deputy Agent, to confirm the Peace which you and I have been for some Time tak∣ing Pains to establish.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>Teedyuscung <HI>addressing himself to the Governor, spoke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor,</HI></P>
<P>BY this Belt (holding up a Belt) I remember what you said Yesterday in the Evening. All was well accepted, and very good, only one Word, or one material Thing. When the several different Nations of us, that call ourselves the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> that are present, I mean the Counsellors, had considered what you said, we approved all except one Thing. Also this Morning early, when we came to sit down by ourselves, and our Secretary with us, when we had done, and had fully understood one another, and agreed on every Word, we then ordered our Secretary to write it down.—[<HI>John Pumpshire</HI> said, I will just mention this in Addition; we ordered him to read it over three or four Times, and approved it.]—Having done that, we have the Words already written down, and if it please the Governor to hear it read, this that is written down is what was concluded on.</P>
<P>The Governor, in Answer, told him, Brother, you know that this is quite a new Me∣thod, and was never practised before.</P>
<P>Brother, it is true, replied <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> you are right; this was not formerly practised; it never used to be so. Don't you see that I aim, by having a Clerk of my own, to exceed my Ancestors, by having every Thing for the best. I endeavour, according to my Ideas, to look to those that have the Authority; as for Instance, if they take up a Handful of Corn or 
<PB N="13" REF="007921_0013_102E01AEEB4BB998"/>
Pebbles, if they drop any, even one Grain, I will take Notice, and will speak of it, that they may take it up.</P>
<P>The Governor then applied to Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> to know whether this had ever been practised in any Treaty; Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> said it never was, and turning to the King, said, Brother, this is quite a new Method, and what was never before practised. I well know the <HI>Indians</HI> have good memories, and can remember what was transacted twenty Years ago, as if Yesterday, I should therefore be glad the King would repeat himself what he has to say, as we are only treating with him. Then <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> replied, Well, Brother the Governor, what we have consulted and concluded on this Morning is this; I remember you told me last Night, that what was transacted last Fall, was laid before the King's Ministers; and we took parti∣cular Notice that you told us, that some Time before you came from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> you fully intended to make all Satisfaction to me at this Treaty about Lands and Deeds; but that you received a Letter, or Letters, from the King or Proprietaries, I am not certain which, you know best; in Consequence of which, you told us that you could not act in this Affair, but that Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> was appointed to transact <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, and Mr. <HI>George Crog∣ban</HI> was appointed to act in his Name. We remember very well, when we had a private Conference with you at your Dwelling, that you and Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> rose up, shock Hands with me, and you told us, this was the very Man that was appointed to act between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> Now, in Consideration of these Things, why should we be obliged to go to Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> to have the Proof of Lands and D eds examined by him, when there is nothing in the Way, the Land Affair not being to be compared with the great Work of Peace, and should not be any Hindrance to our making a League of Friendship.</P>
<P>Now I will give you my Reasons for not going.</P>
<P>In the first Place, I do not know Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI>; he may be an honest and sincere Man. We do understand he treats his <HI>Indians</HI> very well; but we are sensible that some of the Nations are there that have been instrumental to this Misunderstanding, in selling Lands in this Province, having in former Years usurped that Authority, and called us Women, and threatened to take us by the Foretop, and throw us aside as Women. But, after a long Space, I believe it is evident, nay, there are Witnesses present, who can prove that it is otherwise. Also, when I have considered these several Particulars, as you told us there was nothing in the Way to hinder us from confirming a durable and lasting Peace, I at present desire nothing at all of my Brethren the <HI>English</HI> for my Lands, I only want, for the Satisfaction of the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> present, and also of all other <HI>Indians,</HI> that the Deeds may be produced, and well looked into; and as you have told me that Mr. <HI>George Croghan</HI> was the Man that would settle Affairs for our Peace, here he is; I want nothing but to see the Deeds fairly looked into, and true Copies of them taken and put with these Minutes now taken. And, after they have been fairly taken down, if you agree to this, then I shall, by two Belts tied together, take you by the Hand, and, with my Uncles, con∣firm a lasting Peace with you; and if it please the Governor, and Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> let the Co∣py of the Deeds be sent to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> and to the King, and let him judge. I want nothing of the Land till the King hath sent Letters back; then if any of the Lands be found to belong to me, I expect to be paid for it, and not before. Brother, another Reason for not going is, if we cannot agree to settle this Affair here, I am afraid the Nations that are watching and looking into what is done here, will have Reason to think we have not acted an honest Part, as they expect a real, true and lasting Peace will be settled here. I am also concerned on Account of our Women and Children back, and of our Brethren the <HI>English</HI> on the Frontiers. For these now present, who it was expected would go Home with great Joy, will go Home with their Finger in their Mouth, as every Body expected this would be the Time of confirming a real and lasting Peace. I told you I would proclaim with a loud Voice, and those present are Witnesses to what I said, and will not be easy if this is not done. I think nothing hinders us at all.</P>
<P>As you told us you had Letters from the King, or Proprietaries, I desire they may be pro∣duced and read, and put down with the Minutes. Now this is the Conclusion, and in Con∣firmation of what I have said, I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The King further said, I desire also that a Copy of what passed in private between you and me, may be given to be entered with these Minutes, and that it may be read in publick at our next Meeting.</P>
<P>As soon as the Meeting was over, I told the Governor, the Good of His Majesty's Service required, that <HI>Teedyuscung</HI>'s Request of having the Deeds and private Conferences read, and Copies of them given him, with a Copy of so much of the Proprietaries Letters as relates to having the Enquiry made by Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> should be granted.</P>

<P><HI>TEEDYUSCUNG,</HI> with three <HI>Nanticokes,</HI> who arrived Yesterday, and three of his Council, came to me at my Lodgings, and desired I would bear what those <HI>Nanticokes</HI> had to say. Upon which the <HI>Nanticoke</HI> Chief made the following Speeches.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>THE chief Man of the <HI>Nanticokes</HI> has sent me here, to see the Governor and you; and desired me in his Name to wipe the Tears from your Eyes, which those trouble∣some Times may have occasioned; and I do it with this String of Wampum.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>You may have swallowed, since these Troubles arose, something bitter, which has given your Heart some Uneasiness: I, with this String of Wampum, remove all Grief from your Hearts, that your Minds may be as easy as they were in Times of Peace.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>I see a great deal of Blood spilt; I, with this String, clean the Blood from off your Beds, that you may sleep easy, and from off your Council Seats, that you may sit with Pleasure in Council with your Brethren; and with this Feather I open your Ears, which the great high Winds may have stopped, that you may hear what your Brothers may say to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>We must consider, and think it was not the good Spirit that has occasioned this Disturb∣ance; no, it was the evil Spirit that surely occasioned all this Mischief, and I hope God will direct us to do every Thing in our Power to assist in the Good Work of Peace, that we may be once more united together, and live in Friendship, as the good Spirit has ordered us.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>I am come here to this Council Fire with our Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and you, to give all the Assistance I can to the good Work of Peace, and to join my Cousin <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> to gather up the dead Bodies and scattered Bones together, and will join in Prayer to the good Spirit to hide them; and when the Peace is confirmed, I will put both my Hands into the Chain of Friendship with you, and our Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; to confirm my Words, I give this String of Wampum.</P>

<P>The Governor told <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that Five o'Clock Yesterday was appointed for the Time of Meeting; but understanding that the King was then particularly engaged with some Friends lately come in, be had deferred meeting them till this Morning.</P>
<P>The Governor spoke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE well weighed and considered what you said to me at our last Meeting, and am sorry you do not incline to go to Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> to have your Complaints strictly en∣quired into, and examined by him. It is true Sir <HI>William</HI> has, for some Time past, had a 
<PB N="15" REF="007921_0015_102E01B2CA3F42B0"/>
general Commission from the King to superintend <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, and that he has given Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> a Power to Act as his Deputy, under which he might have been justified in going in∣to an Examination as well of your Complaints as the Proprietaries Defence, had not the King's Ministers lately been pleased to direct the Hearing to be before Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> himself. Though you may think yourselves at Liberty, and may resuse to comply with these Directions, yet, as I told you before, I am the King's Servant, and obliged to obey, and can∣not take upon me to go into a Defence of the Proprietaries Title at this Time. But as you so earnestly desire to see the Deeds for the Lands mentioned in your last Treaty, that you may be satisfied whether they are genuine, or whether the <HI>Indians</HI> who signed them had a Right to sell those Lands, I have brought them with me, and am willing to shew them to you now, or at any other Time you will appoint, and give you Copies of them, agreeable to your Request.</P>
<P>Here the Deeds were laid down on the Table.</P>
<P>And now let all further Debates and Altercations concerning Lands rest here, till they shall be fully examined and looked into by Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> in order to be transmitted to the King for His Royal Determination.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>After having now gratified you in every reasonable Request, and being sincerely desirous to re-establish that Friendship and brotherly Love which so happily subsisted between your Ance∣stors and ours, I am ready, with the King's Deputy Agent, to take hold of the two Belts you mentioned with both my Hands, and confirm a lasting Peace, and exchange them with one prepared for that Purpose, in the Name of the King of <HI>England,</HI> and all His Subjects, as soon as we can agree upon the Terms.</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>The Orders of His Majesty's Ministers, on this Occasion, have been signified to me by the Proprietaries, which is the proper Channel through which they should come. That you may the better understand this, it will be necessary to inform you, that the Proprietaries are Governors in Chief over this Province, and I am appointed their Deputy, with the Approba∣tion of the Crown. When, therefore, the last Treaty was laid before the King's Ministers, they gave the Proprietaries Notice of their Resolution, that the Matter should be heard before Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> only, to whom they would send special Directions for that Purpose. The Proprietaries, for whom I act in this Case, have made me acquainted with the Ministers Or∣ders, and desired me to regulate my Conduct by them. It would have been irregular and improper to have sent the Order itself to me, but I do not doubt the King's Ministers have transmitted it to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> as an Authority for him to hear and examine our Diffe∣rences, and that he has received it before this Time. As I could not suspect that you would have required a Copy of such of the Proprietaries Letters as relate to this Matter, I did not bring them with me here; wherefore, it is not in my Power to comply with your Re∣quest, to furnish you with Copies of them; and to confirm the Truth of this, I give you this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P>When the Governor had ended his Speech, he asked the King whether he would have the Deeds read now, and Copies taken. Before the King returned an Answer, he took up the Belt which the Governor had just delivered, and rising up, spoke first to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and then to the <HI>Five Nations</HI>; then turning to the Governor, said,</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I understand the Words you have said here, but they are not agreeable to your Know∣ledge, nor a full Answer to what I said. There are two Things not agreeable.</P>
<P>The Governor said, Will the King please to tell what these two Things are. No, replied the King, let the Governor find them out. The Governor said, he did not know what the King meant; he wished he knew what Answer to make.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> then said, If it please the Governor, in a few Words, what has been spoken on that Belt is as a Rumbling over the Earth, or Confusion about Lands. I did not want you to make Mention of them, when I expected an Answer in a loving Manner. I wanted you should come to the main Point, without having so many Words with it.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Indians</HI> seemed very much at a Loss about the Governor's Speech, I spoke to the King, and told him, that the first Part of the Governor's Speech was only to inform the King that the Deeds are now produced, and Copies will be given to him, agreeable to his own Request, that they may be sent to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> to be by him transmitted to the King 
<PB N="16" REF="007921_0016_102E01B4660D4988"/>
for His Determination. This done, we in the next Place now offer to take hold of the two Belts you mentioned at the last Meeting: That what was said about agreeing upon Terms, only referred to the Exchange of Prisoners, and other Things usual on making Peace; which <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said he would do after the Peace was confirmed: That in the Conclusion of his Speech, the Governor only told the King, that the Proprietaries Letters, for a Copy of which the King asked, were at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> for which Reason the Governor could not comply with what the King requested, but that an Extract of as much of them as referred to this Affair, will be delivered to me some Time hence: In Confirmation of which the Governor gave the Belt.</P>
<P>As soon as the King heard this, he rose up, and taking up the two Belts tied together, he spoke as follows.</P>
<P>I desire you would with Attention hear me. By these two Belts I will let you know what was the ancient regular Method of confirming a lasting Peace. This you ought to have considered, and to have done; but I will put you in Mind. You may remember, when you took hold of my Hand, and led me down, and invited my Uncles, several of whom are present, with some from each of the <HI>Ten Nations,</HI> when we had agreed we came down to take hold of one of your Hands, and my Uncles came to take hold of the other Hand. Now, as this Day and this Time is appointed to meet and confirm a lasting Peace, we, that is, I and my Uncles, as we stand, and you, as you stand in the Name of the Great King, three of us standing, we will all look up, and by continuing to observe the Agreements by which we shall oblige ourselves one to another, we shall see the clear Light, and Friendship shall last to us, and our Posterity after us, for ever. Now, as I have two Belts, and Witnesses are present who will speak the same, by these Belts, Brothers, in the Presence of the <HI>Ten Nations,</HI> who are Witnesses, I lay hold of your Hand (taking the Governor by the Hand) and brighten the Chain of Friendship that shall be lasting; and whatever Conditions shall be proper for us to agree to, may be mentioned afterwards: This is the Time to declare our mutual Friendship. Now, Brother the Governor, to confirm what I have said, I have given you my Hand, which you were pleased to rise and take hold of; I leave it with you. When you please, I am ready. Brother, if you have any Thing to say as a Token of confirming the Peace, I shall be ready to hear; and as you arose, I will rise up, and lay hold of your Hand. To confirm what I have said, I give you these Belts. <HI>Gave two Belts tied together.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor said, that he and I would be ready to give an Answer presently.</P>
<P>Then the King taking out another Belt, said, If the Governor please, I have a Word or two more to say to you. In remembering the old ancient Rules of making Friendship, I re∣member I was formerly represented as a Woman by my Uncles, the <HI>Six</HI> or <HI>Five Nations</HI>; but they gave me a Pipe, and good Tobacco; those present know it to be true; and what I say is in Behalf of all those present, and those afar off. That Pipe and good Tobacco of Friendship, I now deliver to you. Brother, when you shall smoke that good Tobacco, it will give you such a Relish, that you shall feel it as long as the Sun shines. That very good Tobacco and Pipe that I shall deliver into your Hand, represents among us a perpetual Friend∣ship. Now I deliver you an equal Part of it, and I desire it may be a lasting Comfort in this World, and the World to come. <HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> had confirmed the Peace in Behalf of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> he represents, his Honour the Governor, and myself, confirmed it in Behalf of the King, and all His Sub∣jects, and exchanged the Belts in the following Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung, <HI>and all our Brethren of the</HI> Ten Nations,</P>
<P>We your Brethren, all His Majesty's Subjects now present, have heard with Satisfaction what you have said, and with great Pleasure receive the two Belts you have given us, which will confirm a lasting Peace to us and our Posterity, and we embrace this Meeting to ex∣change with you a Belt of Friendship, and take hold of you with one Hand, and of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> with the other, and confirm, in the Name of the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and all His Subjects, a lasting Peace, that may continue as long as the Sun and Moon give Light; and we hope this Day may be always held in Remembrance by our Posterity; and we will be ready to consult with you at any Time about settling other Matters, as you yourself have said. We now rise and take you into our Arms, and embrace you with the greatest Pleasure as our Friends and Brethren, and heartily desire we may ever hereaster look on one another as Bre∣thren, and Children of the same Parents: As a Confirmation of this we give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a very large white Belt, with the Figures of three Men in it, representing His Majesty King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> taking hold of the <HI>Five Nation</HI> King with one Hand, and <HI>Teedyus∣cung,</HI> the <HI>Delaware</HI> King, with the other, and marked with the following Letters and Figure, <HI>G. R. 5 N. D. K.</HI> for King <HI>GEORGE, Five Nations, Delaware</HI> King.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="007921_0017_102E01B6D1152F28"/>
This done, the King again asked the Governor for a Copy of the Conferences that had been held in private, that they might be read in Publick, and entered with the Minutes. The Governor said it was ready, and should be delivered immediately, and one was sent for it. The Governor then asked the King when it would be agreeable to him to have the Deeds read. The King said, To-morrow Morning, between Seven and Eight a Clock; which Time was accordingly agreed on; and the Reading of the Private Conferences was deferred till that Time.</P>
<P>I think it necessary to insert here the following Speech of <HI>Laboughpeton,</HI> a <HI>Delaware</HI> Chief, made to <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> at the Time he seemed at a Loss about the Governor's Speech to him, which is as follows.</P>
<P>"What, has not our Brother desired you to bring us down by the Hand to make Peace? why don't you do it? We have been here these twenty Days, and have heard nothing but scolding and disputing about Lands: Settle the Peace, and let all these Disputes stand till after."</P>
<P>As soon as the Meeting was over, I let the Governor know I could not help taking Notice, that there was one Deed relative to those Lands wanting, which is mentioned in a Treaty held by this Government with the <HI>Indians</HI> in 1728, said there to be dated in 1718, and that I expected to see that Deed, and have a Copy of it; and likewise Extracts of so much of the Proprietaries Letter to him as relates to the Desire of His Majesty's Ministers, signifying to them, that they ordered the Differences subsisting between them and the <HI>Indians</HI> to be ex∣amined by Sir <HI>William Johnson.</HI> And that as <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> in Answer to a Message his Ho∣nour had sent by Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> to him Yesterday Morning (which will appear as follows) said, that he would be contented, so he see all the Deeds relative to these Back Lands now in Dispute, and have Copies of them, and of the Proprietaries Letter; and further said, as soon as that was done, he would not say one Word more about the Disputes about Lands; I then let his Honour know, as <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> had now confirmed the Peace, I expected his Ho∣nour would now furnish me with a Copy of that Deed, and the Proprietaries Letter to him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Easton, August</HI> 2, 1757.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Morning <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> sent <HI>Samuel Evans</HI> for me to come to him at Colonel <HI>Weiser's</HI> Lodging: I went there, and found him with five of his Counsellors, and Mr. <HI>Weiser.</HI> Upon my coming in, Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> told <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> that he wanted to have some Conversation with him. <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> asked him if it was by Order of the Governor. Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> replied, it was by Consent of the Governor and Council.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> then asked <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> whether he wanted to see all the Deeds of the Pro∣vince from the first Purchases, or only those relating to the Back Lands where we are. Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> said, the Reason for his asking was, that he believed the whole of the Deeds were not brought up, but such only as were thought necessary, and relating to his Complaint, and the late Purchases.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> answered, I should be well pleased to have seen all the Deeds, as the Country to the Sea Shore was first ours; but if there be the Deeds for these Back Lands, which is the main Point, I will be contented, so that I see them, and have Copies of them, and of the Letters from the King's Ministers or Proprietaries; as soon as that is done, I will not say one Word more about the Differences or Lands, but confirm the Peace as soon as that is done.</P>
<P>This Evening the Governor wrote me, that his Letter from the Proprietaries was in <HI>Phi∣ladelphia,</HI> Extracts of which he would give me as soon as I went to Town. And he assured me, that he would give me a Copy of the Deed mentioned in the Treaty of 1728.</P>

<ITEM><HI>TEEDYUSCUNG,</HI> King of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> attended by several Chiefs and Deputies of the <HI>Ten Nations</HI> he represents, and a great Number of others.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THE Conferences held in Council between the Governor and King <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> were produced, and read; and to them was added, by Order of the King, and approved by the Governor, a Paragraph relating to the King's insisting a second Time on having a Se∣cretary, and the Governor's Answer.</P>
<P>The Deeds shewn Yesterday were again produced, and <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> was told, that Mr. <HI>Charles Thompson,</HI> his Secretary, had got Copies of them, and compared them with the Origi∣nals; and was asked if he chose to see the Originals. The King said, I am satisfied, as my Secretary has seen the Copies compared. If he is satisfied that they are true Copies, I am satisfied that they should be sent to the King for His Determination; then asked Mr. <HI>Thomp∣son</HI> if he had seen them compared. Mr. <HI>Thompson</HI> said, he had seen and compared all the Deeds that were delivered Yesterday. The King then desired an Account of what Deeds were produced, which was accordingly taken, and is as follows. 1. A Paper Copy of the last <HI>Indian</HI> Purchase, 28th of <HI>Sixth Month,</HI> 1686. 2. A Release from the <HI>Delaware Indians, August</HI> 25, 1737. 3. A Release of the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Five Nations</HI> of the Lands on <HI>Sas∣quehannab</HI> River, <HI>October</HI> 11, 1736. 4. A Release from the <HI>Six Nations</HI> of Lands Eastward to <HI>Delaware</HI> River, dated <HI>October</HI> 25, 1736, with another indorsed on it, dated the 9th of <HI>July,</HI> 1754. 5. A Deed of Release for <HI>Indian</HI> Purchase, dated the 22d of <HI>August,</HI> 1749.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> The above Deeds were shewn in open Council, and Copies of them delivered to <HI>Teedy∣uscung,</HI> which his Secretary acknowledged he had compared with the Originals, and that they were true Copies.</P>
<P>When this was done, the Governor spoke to <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung, <HI>and all our Brethren of the</HI> Ten Nations.</P>
<P>As you and all His Majesty's Subjects are now united again in the firm Bands of Peace, it is our Duty to do every Thing in our Power to make each other happy; and it was stipulated at the Conferences held at this Place last Sommer, that all Prisoners you had taken should be delivered up.</P>
<P>The Relations of those who yet remain Prisoners amongst you, have their Eyes fixed on me, expecting at my Return to see their Friends restored to them; but as few of them are brought down, and this will be a Bar to our Happiness, it is necessary for you to do every Thing in your Power to restore to us, as soon as possible, all our People that remain Pri∣soners amongst any of your Nations; and to procure those who are among any other Tribes in Amity with you, to be sent to us.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>It is a Rule among Nations, upon confirming a Peace, to deliver up all Prisoners on both Sides. It is the only Method we can take to convince each other of our Sincerity; and we do insist on this being done. You will be so good, immediately on your Return, to convey them down by some of your young Men, who shall be well rewarded for their Trouble.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>When the Governor had delivered his Speech, and gave the Belt, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said, I will take no other Belt but the very same I have. Why have you done this now? Why did you 
<PB N="19" REF="007921_0019_102DC827CE82BCA8"/>
not do it before? After we had finished, why do you make any Words about such Things? This was your Duty; you ought to have done it before. If you really believed I would be faith∣ful and honest, you might be sure I would do it without your delivering a Belt. Now, as you have mentioned these Things, I also will mention, that you must deliver me my just Due about Lands. As you mention that your People look to you, expecting to see their Relations sent back at this Treaty, so the Nations that lay Claim to these Lands look to me for them.</P>
<P><HI>Returned the Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor told <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that he did not do this, as if he had distrusted his Ho∣nour, the King having already given a full Proof of that, by delivering up some Prisoners. for which he thanked him; that he only meant to put the King in Mind of his Promise.</P>
<P>I then told <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that before the Peace was concluded, when I was explaining to him the Governor's Speech, that Part of it where the Governor says, "as soon as we can agree upon the Terms," related intirely to the Exchange of Prisoners, and <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said, that should be settled afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> then applied to his Secretary, to know if any such Thing had been mention∣ed; and being informed by his Secretary, that it was entered in the Minutes, he (<HI>Teedyus∣cung</HI>) then rose up, and, having first consulted with his own People, and the <HI>Five Nations</HI> spoke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor,</HI></P>
<P>Please to hear me in few Words. What you told me I have told to my Uncles the <HI>Six Nations</HI> present, and also to all the <HI>Ten Nations.</HI> We have consulted on these Words that you have now spoken: We now think they were very proper, and are very agreeable: We look on it as our Duty: Why should we keep your Flesh and Blood, or any of your People, when we have agreed as one, and look on one another as one, and treat one another as Bre∣thren? After we have all considered, and all present have heard, we beg your Pardon, that we forgot to give you an Answer immediately. As it was written down by our Clerk in the Minutes Yesterday, it must be so; and as we are now sensible this Matter was mentioned Yesterday, we accept your Words, and look on it as our Duty to answer you, and to per∣form; whatever shall be in our Power, we shall endeavour to do. In Confirmation of which I give you my Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Gave the Governor his Hand.</HI></P>
<P>After this Speech the Governor again delivered back the Belt to the King, who readily accepted it.</P>
<P>The Governor then told the <HI>Indians,</HI> that a Present was prepared, and would be delivered to them To-morrow, as a Token of Friendship.</P>
<P>I told <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that as the Business was now nearly finished with <HI>Onas,</HI> I had something to say to him, in the Name of the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that I would let him know when I was to speak to him.</P>
<P>After the Council broke up, the Governor sent for <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and some of his Coun∣sellors, to his Lodgings, from whence we went to Mr. <HI>Vernon</HI>'s, where an handsome En∣tertainment was provided, at which were present, the Governor, his Council, the Speaker, and Members of Assembly, the Commissioners and Gentlemen in Town; the <HI>Delaware</HI> King, his Counsellors, Warriors, and all the <HI>Indians,</HI> Men, Women and Children, in Number about Three Hundred. After Dinner Peace was proclaimed in Form, and the Proclama∣tion interpreted to the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Six Nations</HI>; at the Close of which, the Governor, by his Secretary, expressed his Satisfaction at being one of the happy Instruments of bringing about this Peace. His Honour recommended it to all Ranks and Professions of Men, to cultivate, to the utmost of their Power, a good Understanding with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to treat them kindly, that they may daily see the Advantage of preserving our Friendship.</P>
<P>Having given this in Charge to the Freeholders present, be desired <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> to do the same to his People, that we might on both Sides forget what was past, and live affectionately together for the Time to come. A Detachment of the <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> Troops was drawn up in the Front of the Company, and fired three Vollies.</P>
<P>The Governor afterwards continued his Entertainment, at which there was a great Chear∣fulness. At Night was a large Bonfire, and a Variety of <HI>Indian</HI> Dances.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>THIS Morning another Sheet of Council Conferences was produced, which the Go∣vernor said was omitted to be delivered Yesterday; for which Reason they were de∣livered, and publickly read To-day, and ordered to be annexed to the Conferences in Council, delivered and read Yesterday.</P>
<P>After this was read, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> arose and said, Brother, I am obliged to you; I hope, as it lies in your Power, you will act for our mutual Good. I take you as a Brother. When any Thing is omitted, I hope you will mention it to me; and I likewise will mention any Thing that I find you may have forgotten. I hope we both speak with an honest Heart. I trust much to my Interpreter. I thank you for making that Addition, and, in Token of Friend∣ship, I give you my Hand.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor then addressed the</HI> Indians <HI>as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Peace, so happily concluded, gives an universal Joy. I shall proclaim it far and wide, that all may hear and know it. The People of this Province are disposed to observe it faith∣fully, and will do the <HI>Indians</HI> every good Office in their Power.</P>
<P>Altho' we have now so solemnly entered into this Peace with each other, yet you are sen∣sible there are still many Enemy <HI>Indians,</HI> who are daily doing Mischief on our Frontiers. Yesterday I received an Account of one Woman's being killed, and four Persons taken Pri∣soners, between <HI>Tolbao</HI> and <HI>Monaidy.</HI> As it will therefore be very difficult to distinguish be∣tween our Friends and our Enemies, I should be glad you would favour me with your Ad∣vice how to act in such a Manner, as not to hurt our Friends, or suffer our Enemies to escape.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Governor, and People of this Province, observe, with a brotherly Compassion, the many Difficulties to which the <HI>Indians</HI> are exposed in these troublesome Times, and have therefore provided a Quantity of Goods to supply them in their Distress. You will, on your Return Home, proclaim the Peace, Union and Friendship, which is now established between us, and let every one know, as you have Opportunity, how well disposed you have sound us. Accept these Presents, as a Testimony of the sincere Affection of us your Brethren towards you.</P>
<P>To <HI>this</HI> Teedyuscung <HI>replied,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am obliged to you for putting me in Remembrance of these Things. I will take them into Consideration, and To-morrow, when I am ready to give you an Answer, I will let you know. He further added,</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>There is something which we intended to say before, but forgot, as we have not the Use of Writing. But better late than never; we will therefore mention it now. The Copy of the Deeds, and the Transactions of this Treaty, we entrust to our Clerk. We believe him to be an honest Man. Every Thing is done to Perfection. We hope you will not be a∣gainst his making out a Copy, and giving it to Mr. <HI>Isaac Norris,</HI> whom we also appoint for us, to transmit to the King a Copy of the Deeds and Minutes of the Treaty, that, if one should misearry, the other may go safe.</P>
<P>On which I acquainted <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that the Governor and myself had no Objection to Mr. <HI>Norris</HI>'s having true Copies of the Minutes of these Conferences and Deeds, to send to the King, as he requested.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="007921_0021_102E01BF9455A870"/>
Then, by Order of the Governor, Proclamation was made, that no One should cheat, defraud or purchase any of the Goods now ready to be given to the <HI>Indians,</HI> upon the Pain and Penalties that may fall thereon.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said, he had yet one Thing more to mention.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have some Complaints to make about Lands in the <HI>Jerseys,</HI> in Behalf of myself, <HI>John Pumpshire, Moses Tetamy,</HI> and others; which Complaints are contained in these two Papers: And as you represent Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> the King's Agent here, I desire you may take them under your Consideration, and see that Justice is done us on that Account, as it is the King's Orders to you, to see Justice done to all the <HI>Indians</HI> in these Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> then ordered Mr. <HI>Thompson</HI> to read the Papers, and give me true Copies of them, which he did immediately in publick Council.</P>
<P>The Papers delivered me are, a Copy of an old <HI>Indian</HI> Deed; and a Letter of Complaint about Lands in the <HI>Jerseys,</HI> signed by <HI>John Pumpshire</HI>; I then acquainted him, that I would take the Papers under my Consideration, and give him an Answer.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Easton, August</HI> 6, 1757.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Morning I expected to have had a Meeting with the <HI>Indians,</HI> but as the friendly Association of <HI>Quakers</HI> had called the <HI>Indians</HI> together, to deliver them a Present, the <HI>Indians</HI> thought proper to put off the Meeting for this Time.</P>
<P>After this the three <HI>Nan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>coke</HI> Messengers came to me, and congratulated the Governor and myself on the Conclu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of the Peace, and said, they had put both their Hands into the Chain of Friendship, as they were ordered by their Chief before they left Home, and, by a String of Wampum, desired that the Governor might send some Person with them to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> to take Care of them, and supply them with Necessaries on the Road, as they were come to take the Bones of their Friends which died at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> to their own Town, to be buried with their Relations.</P>
<P>Gave a String.</P>
<P>This Afternoon <HI>Packsinosa,</HI> the <HI>Shawanese</HI> Chief, with <HI>Abraham,</HI> a <HI>Mohickon</HI> Chief, and about Fifty or Sixty of their People, came to Town. Soon after Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> and <HI>Conrad Weiser,</HI> went to them, and, with a String of Wampum, bid them Welcome, agreeable to the ancient Custom of our Forefahters. <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chief, did the same.</P>

<P>Teedyuscung, <HI>taking out the Peace Belt that had been delivered to him by the Governor and my∣self, repeated over what had been said on it, informing</HI> Packsinosa <HI>and</HI> Abraham <HI>of the Peace concluded by him between the</HI> English <HI>and the</HI> Ten <HI>several</HI> Nations <HI>he represents, repeating over the Names of the</HI> Ten Nations.</P>
<P><HI>After which I spoke to them, in the Name of Sir</HI> William Johnson, <HI>as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung, <HI>and all the Chiefs and Warriors of the</HI> Ten Nations, <HI>our Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>AS we are now become one People, we must look on the Enemies of the one as the Enemies of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="007921_0022_102E01C14C0BE490"/>
And I now, in the Name of the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> your Father, and my Master, de∣sire you will turn the Edge of your Hatchet against your and our common Enemies, in Conjunction with your Uncles the <HI>Six Nations</HI> and us; and that you will not suffer any of His Majesty's Enemies to pass through your Country to war against any of His Subjects in this or the neighbouring Colonies: And if a Body of the Enemy, so large that you are not able to repel, should attempt to pass across your Country, I expect you will give the earliest Notice you can of it to your Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> either by Way of <HI>Fort Augusta,</HI> or any other Way you shall judge most convenient.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You said, as soon as the Peace should be confirmed, that you would speak with a loud Voice, and the Nations around should hear you. As that good Work is now happily accom∣plished, I desire you may proclaim it aloud, that all the Nations may hear it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You must be sensible that your Brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> are the most wealthy and powerful People on this Continent, and not only so, but the best inclined to help and assist their Bre∣thren the <HI>Indians</HI> with the Necessaries of Life; all this you should let the Nations know that you speak to; and I assure you, in the Name of the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and of Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> His Majesty's sole Agent, and Superintendent of the Affairs of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> their Allies and Dependents, in the Northern District, that they are ready to receive with open Arms all the Nations you shall speak to, that desire to take hold of the Chain of Friendship, and be united with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> you, and us, your Brethren the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Papers you delivered me Yesterday, containing your, <HI>John Pumpshire, Tundy,</HI> alias <HI>(Moses) Tetamy,</HI> and others, Complaints of Lands you say you have been defrauded of in the <HI>Jerseys</HI>; I assure you I will do every Thing in my Power to have a strict Enquiry made about them, and when I can get the fair State of the Case, I will lay it before Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> for him to send to the King for His Royal Determination, unless the Difference can be set∣tled here to your Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To this</HI> Teedyuscung <HI>answered,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I will, in Answer to what you tell me, let you know what I intend to do. I shall, Bro∣ther, as I promised to speak with a loud Voice to the Nations, perform my Promise, and speak to the different Nations. I will faithfully let them know what you have promised, and, as we are Witnesses that you are wealthy and powerful, and well disposed to assist such as shall come in as Brothers, I will let them know it. And also, as I think it is very proper that I should do so, and as I think it my Duty, whatever Nation I see coming against the <HI>English,</HI> whenever I see them, I will make ready, and do every Thing in my Power to vin∣dicate the Cause of myself, and of my Brethren. If I am able, I will let them go no far∣ther than where I tell them to stop. If they will not, by reasonable Terms, turn about, and join with me, I will then either make an End of them, or they of me. And if there is a great Number, so that I may not be able to withstand them, I will take all prudent Steps to let my Brethren the <HI>English</HI> know. And also, if I perceive that there is so great a Num∣ber, that it is not safe for my Women and Children, I will acquaint my Brethren the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> that they may assist me in defending my Women and Children, and I will leave my Country, and bring them down to you.</P>
<P>Now, you may remember I was stiled by my Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> a Woman in for∣mer Years, and had no Hatchet in my Hand, but a Pestle or Hominy Pounder, but now, Brethren, here are some of my Uncles, who are present, to witness the Truth of this; as I had no Tomahawk, and my Uncles were always stiled Men, and had Tomahawks in their Hands, they gave me a Tomahawk. And as my Uncles have given me the Tomahawk, and appointed and authorized me to make Peace with a Tomahawk in my Hand, I take that Tomahawk, and turn the Edge of it against your Enemies the <HI>French.</HI> In Confirmation of what I now say, I give you this String.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have just a Word or two more. I remember what you have spoken, in order that we may prevent any Mischief, by having a Signal: I should be glad that the <HI>French</HI> may not deceive us, that not one but several Signs and Methods may be fixed on by you. And whatever you shall think proper, I will agree to.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P>I then returned <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> Thanks for his kind Speech, and let him know that I would consult with the Governor about settling the Signals, and would give him an Answer.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="007921_0023_102E01C5220C8998"/>
<HI>Teedyuscung</HI> then taking up four Belts, and a String, spoke to his Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> telling them, that as they had empowered him, he had, in the Presence of these Witnesses they had sent, made a firm Peace with their Brethren the <HI>English</HI>; he, therefore, by these Belts desired, that they would perform their Part; and as they said they would take hold of the <HI>English</HI> by one Hand, and he by the other, he had now done it. And as the Chain of Friendship was now brightened, he desired they would be strong, and if they see any Ene∣mies coming against us, they would look on it, that whoever strikes any one of us strikes all. These Belts he gave to <HI>Anaquateeka,</HI> and desired he would carry them to the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> then acquainted me that he had done; whereupon <HI>Packsinosa</HI> spoke to me as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I heartily thank you for being so kind as to wipe the Sweat from our Faces, picking out the Briars, and taking away all bad Thoughts from our Minds, and cleaning the Passage from the Heart to the Throat, that we may see our Brethren, and be well from all our Wounds. By these Strings we return you Thanks.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P>The same he said by another String to the <HI>Six Nations</HI> and <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>Then the young Warrior, <HI>Anaquateeka,</HI> arose, and, directing his Speech to the <HI>English,</HI> and his Cousins, said,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>My Cousins have entrusted me with all that was here transacted, respecting the great Work of Peace here confirmed, to lay it before the <HI>Six Nations.</HI> I assure you I will execute the Trust reposed in me with Faithfulness, and lay it before the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> particularly before the <HI>Senecas,</HI> to whom I belong. I do not pretend to be a Counsellor: I am a young War∣rior; yet the Affairs of War and Peace belong to us Warriors: And as I am entrusted, I assure you I will take Care that all the <HI>Six Nations</HI> may know what is here done.</P>
<P>Then his Honour the Governor, Mr. <HI>Logan,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> came into Council. I ac∣quainted the Governor, that I thought it was proper what had been transacted this Morning should be read, and it was accordingly done; after which the Governor addressed <HI>Packsino∣sa</HI> as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Packsinosa,</P>
<P>You have been frequently invited by this Government to come and give us the Pleasure of a Visit. I am glad to see you, I take you by the Hand, and bid you heartily welcome, and thank you for bringing along with you <HI>Abraham,</HI> the <HI>Mohiccon</HI> Chief; he is likewise extremely welcome.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have often enquired after you, and always heard you continued to be our hearty Friend, and a Lover of Peace. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>William Johnson</HI> was kind enough to send me an Account of the Conferences he lately held <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you at <HI>Fort Johnson,</HI> and they gave me great Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>With Pleasure I acquaint you, that Peace is now concluded, and it will add much to the Joy all feel on this successful Issue of our Conferences; and I am glad to see you and <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> here to take hold of the Peace Belt.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We were in Hopes to have seen you with <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> when he came here. We heard you was not come, but would follow: I have staid some Time in Expectation of your Ar∣rival. I should have been glad to have spent more Time with you, but the Business of the Government obliges me to return to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> this Afternoon, so that you will please to use Dispatch in letting me know any Thing you may have to say to us.</P>
<P>Having finished this Speech, the Governor told <HI>Packsinosa,</HI> that some Presents were re∣served for him and his Friends, which should be delivered presently.</P>
<P>Teedyuscung <HI>then addressing himself to the Governor, spoke as follows</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have a Word or two more to say. You know when you employ your Soldiers, they are paid for their Services. As I am joined with you, you being rich, and I poor, as I am going against your Enemies, and carrying my Flesh against them, I think it would be proper, for the En∣couragement of my young Men, to appoint some Reward for Scalps, and Prisoners, and that some Place may be fixed, where the Scalps and Prisoners may be brought in, and the Reward received, that my Men may return quickly from thence.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="007921_0024_102E01C7B8B9DDA8"/>
Then the Governor said, he would take into Consideration what he, <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> had said, and in Half an Hour would return an Answer.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> further added; You may remember, when I mentioned <HI>Isaac Norris,</HI> the Speaker, I mentioned him alone; but I did not intend to mention him alone, but that he, with the Assembly, should look into it, and send Copies Home.—I then told <HI>Teedyus∣cung,</HI> that I had no Objection to Mr. <HI>Norris,</HI> with the Assembly, sending authentick Copies of the Minutes of this Treaty, and Deeds, Home.</P>

<P>Teedyuscung <HI>addressed the Governor as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>WE have now finished. The Treaty is over. Peace is confirmed. I told you I thought of going to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but upon considering the Matter with more At∣tention, I think it will be more for the publick Service if I proceed immediately to <HI>Diahogo:</HI> Many Nations will be uneasy to know what has been done at this Council-Fire, and will take their Measures accordingly; I shall therefore make the best of my Way to <HI>Diahogo,</HI> and proclaim there, and to Nations still more distant, the Confirmation of the Peace with our Brethren the <HI>English.</HI> This will take up three or four Months; after which I may perhaps come and see you at <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> I wish the Governor a good Journey, and that we may both live to enjoy the Fruits of this happy Peace, which gives my People great Joy.</P>
<P><HI>To which the Governor returned the following Answer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung,</P>
<P>It gives me great Pleasure that we have brought the important Business we met about to so happy an Issue. You have very agreeably prevented my mentioning to you the Necessity of your returning Home, in order to publish to the <HI>Indians</HI> what has been transacted here. I thank you for the Change of your Purpose: It is a further Sign of your Zeal for Peace, and I make no Doubt but you will use your utmost Dispatch.</P>
<P>In Answer to what you requested this Morning, I assure you that your Warriors will al∣ways find this Government ready to reward them for any Services they shall do against the Enemy. I cannot at present give you a more particular Answer, but shall lay your Proposals before the Assembly, who meet To-morrow, and consult with them thereupon.</P>
<P>Teedyuscung <HI>replied.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor,</HI></P>
<P>You have not so much as given us a rusty Iron to defend ourselves. If we meet an Ene∣my on the Road, what are we to do? We cannot defend ourselves against him. We have nothing to do it with. Our young Warriors think as much of themselves, and their Lives are as dear to them as white People's. But you have not given them any Encouragement to go against the Enemy. Can this be right? You know you have not. Consider this well Brother.</P>
<P>Further, Brother, I think it proper to tell you, if <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> shall go to War to∣gether, my young Men will not be subject to an <HI>English</HI> Captain; and if any of your People will go to War with me, I expect they will be subject to my Directions: We understand our own Way of Fighting better than you.</P>
<P>The Governor then said he had given Directions to Colonel <HI>Weiser</HI> to agree with him on proper Signals for the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they were coming towards the inhabited Parts of this Province, as this was a Matter that ought not to be spoke of in Publick.</P>
<P>They then took a kind Leave of each other, and the Governor set out for <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
