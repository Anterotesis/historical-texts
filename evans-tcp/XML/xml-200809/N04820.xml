<P>A Vindication of Gospel-Truth, AND Refutation of some dangerous Errors, In Relation to that important QUESTION, <HI>Whe∣ther there be</HI> PROMISES <HI>of the Bestowment of</HI> special Grace, <HI>made in Scripture to the</HI> UNRE∣GENERATE, <HI>on Condition of any</HI> Endeavours, Strivings, <HI>or</HI> Doings <HI>of theirs whatsoever?</HI></P>
<P>CONTAINING A <HI>Reply</HI> to what the Author of a late LETTER from <HI>Aristocles</HI> to <HI>Authades,</HI> has offer'd on the <HI>Affirmative</HI> Side of the Question, with a View to invalidate the Arguments advanc'd by the Rev.

<HEAD>A Prefatory Epistle TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is no rare or uncommon Thing, that religions Disputes spend themselves on meer <HI>Circumstantials</HI>; Things, that 'tis of little Im∣portance, on which Side of the Question, the Truth is found, as to them, And for that Reason they are often pass'd over by wise Men, as not worthy of any close Attention or warm Debate. But the Case is otherwise in the Controversy now before us; the Subject whereof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any light Matter, or bare Circumstantial of Christianity: But 'tis one of the great <HI>Things</HI> of the Gospel; nothing less than wherein the Nature and Extent of the <HI>Gospel it self,</HI> and <HI>New Covenant,</HI> therein revealed, consists.— So that on what Side of this Debate, the <HI>Truth</HI> lies, there lies the <HI>Co∣venant</HI> of Grace, and real Gospel of Jesus Christ: But, on the other Side lies <HI>an∣other Covenant,</HI> and <HI>another Gospel,</HI> as to this Particular, a Covenant of <HI>Man's</HI> own devising, a Gospel such as <HI>Divine</HI> Revelation knows nothing of.</P>
<P>We, on the one Hand, readily own, that the <HI>New Covenant</HI> promsis <HI>eternal Life</HI> to <HI>unseigned Faith, Repentance, Love,</HI> &amp;c. And in a Word, to all <HI>Obedi∣ence</HI> thence arising; which in a Gospel-Sense is termed, <HI>Good Works, Fruits of Righteousness,</HI> &amp;c. But then (as is observed in the following Papers) we are expresly taught by the Holy Ghost, that none such car be performed by us, <HI>previous</HI> to our Regeneration.</P>
<P>Moreover, it is readily acknowledged by us, that the <HI>Encouragement</HI> given to all, to whom the Gospel is publish'd, to labour after a saving Compliance therewith, is great; and such as by an infinite Wisdom is sated to the State of the fallen Crea∣ture: But still, short of a <HI>Promise,</HI> ascertaining the Success of his Endeavours

so as that, whenever <HI>first Grace,</HI> or saving Conversion, is bestowed, it should be in the Way of GOD's performing a <HI>Covenant Obligation,</HI> he had graciously last him∣self under, on Condition of any Seekings, Strivings, of Doings of the Sinner.</P>
<P>What Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad those with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther Side, advance, is, That GOD has graciously <HI>obliged</HI> himself in the New Covenant, not only is bestow eternal Life on the sincerity Penitent, or Godly (as above) but also is bestow his <HI>special, ef∣fectual Grace</HI> on the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Condition of certain Endeavour put forth by them, whilst under the Deminion and Guilt of Sin — So that the Controversy here plainly respects the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Extent</HI> of the <HI>New Covenant.</HI>—'Tis there∣fore of the same Importance, that we rightly understand what Truth is in this P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as that we rightly understand what the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> is— Nor is it possible the Sinner should know in what <HI>Form</HI> or <HI>Manner</HI> be may hope successfully to address the Divine Majesty by Prayer for the Bestowment of <HI>special Grace,</HI> but by rightly understanding the Nature and Extern of the New Covenant, in regard of this Particular. — For if <HI>special Grace</HI> be given only in Pursuance of a <HI>Cove∣nant Engagement,</HI> or in the Way of perfoming some <HI>Promise</HI> of GOD, made to certain Doings of the unconverted Sinner, then doubtless it must be a very <HI>wrong</HI> Method for the Sinner to seek it otherwise, then in the Way of <HI>Covenant Right,</HI> or <HI>Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>,</HI> by having performed those Things to which it is gracious promised: Be∣cause that would be to seek it out of GOD's covenanted Way of bestowing of it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the other Hand, if it be given meerly in the Way of <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> and not at all, in the Way of GOD's performing any gracious Promise of his, made to the Doings of the Sinner, then it must be very wrong for the Sinner to seek it as a Blessing <HI>promis'd</HI> him, to which he has or may have a <HI>Covenant-Right</HI> by any Doings of his, in his unregenerate State: Because that would be to seek it in an. <HI>An <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>criptural</HI> Way, a Way in which GOD hath never by any Engagement of his given him the least Encouragement to expect the Bestowment to it.—And if this latter be the Case, it must then certainly follow, that all Presence of <HI>preaching the Go∣spel of Christ,</HI> under this Head of urging Sinners upon seeking after renewing Grace as <HI>promised</HI> to their own Doings, is so far from preaching the true Gospel of Jesus Christ, as that 'tis in Reality a <HI>perverting the Gospel,</HI> or preaching con∣trary to it: And is so much worse to than nothing, in this Particular, as the Tra∣veller's being directed to a wrong Road, is worse than no Direction at all; be∣cause, that, instead of forwarding his Journey, at least greatly retards it.</P>
<P>To speak plainly here, such is the Tenor of the New Covenant, according to the Doctor (if I understand him at all) that the <HI>Sinner,</HI> which receives the <HI>special Grace</HI> of GOD for the Renovation of his Nature to Holiness, receives it as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th Way of <HI>Covenant Right,</HI> by his Works, whilst Unregenerate, as the <HI>Saint</HI> in Christ Jesus receives the Reward of future Glory by a <HI>Covenant Right,</HI> arising from a Compliance with Gospel-Terms.</P>
<P>Such a <HI>Scheme</HI> of the Covenant as this (I acknowledge) I have never yet been all to see in the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> — And therefore, I have endeavoured in the following Sheets (after what has been thought sufficient, is replaced to the <HI>Doctor's</HI> Letter) to evidence from various Arguments, that this Notion of the New Covenant is merely humane, what neither is, nor can be divine, according to the Revelation, which GOD) has given us of his Mind and Will.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected, that I make some Apology for my publishing this Reply to the <HI>Doctor's Letter,</HI> as it appears now <HI>out of Seaten</HI>; not only because, it is
<PB REF="006010_0005_10277111EE9C6F20"/>
some Time since his Letter came abroad; but especially because it hath already received a sufficient Answer from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Dickinson;</HI> after which it may be thought, nothing further can be needful.—</P>
<P>I would say them, 1st. That when I entered upon this Affair, it was with a View, that the <HI>Dr</HI>'s Letter was not like to receive any Answer at all. — And therefore, though I knew my self one of the least among my Brethren, and by no Means able to give the Cause that fall Advantage, which Truth would allow: Yet taking of to be the Cause of GOD, and of common Concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, I was willing to do my Part in the Defence of it; even as the least of the King's Subjects ought not to stand by and see the Interest of his Prince suffer, without attempting what is in his Power to defend it. Thus was I induced to make the present Attempt.—And,</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> Though the Sufficiency of Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI>'s Reply be fully conceeded, as to be sure it is by me; Nevertheless, doubtless, this will be allowed by all, that how∣ever well Error is demonstrated against, and Truth vindicated by one, yet still the sane Thing being done by another Hand in a <HI>different</HI> Manner, tends to Confirma∣tion: And usually carries this Advantage with it, <HI>viz.</HI> That some who did not so clearly see Truth in the former Representation, will more clearly discern it in the latter: And that, even, when the latter is greatly inferior to the former; which I am sensible is the present Case; and yet I conceive it possible, that even this Meanness may serve the better to accomodate what is said, to the Understanding and Acceptation of the more Illiterate. Upon this View, together with their Considera∣tions, I have by the Importunity of Friends, been prevailed on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the following Sheets (which indeed for some Time have lain by) might be made publick.</P>
<P>As to the Manner of composing, I am not insensible, that the same Things with some Variation of Expression, are once and again repeated in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Places of this Performance; which though naturally distasteful to the polite and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>ing Reader, will (I hope) be easily overlook'd, since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cas out of a compassionate Design thereby of accomodating Things better to the weakest Understanding; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if possible, every Capacity might be reach'd with a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tion of Truth.</P>
<P>As to any Thing of Peremptoriness of Expression made Use of by me in this De∣bate, all that I would be understood thereby to signify is, that the things, in the Writing of them, to me appear'd considerably clear: Not that I expect that this Manner of Expression should be of any further Influence with the Reader than the Evidence of Truth, with which it is accompanied, justly requires.—</P>
<P>If any Thing of undue Warmth or Harshness of Language rewards the Rev. Dr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> if any Thing of that Wind beyond what the Nature of the Cause, and the Defence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> required, and what Christianity it self will vindicate, shall be found in the following Debate, to have drop from my Pen, it is what I have not upon a cool Reflection been able to observe, and shall readily retract any such Instance, upon being convinced hereof</P>
<P>Though I pretend not to an Exemption of what I have here wrote, from much of Weakness and humane <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; yet this, I trust, I may say with good Assurance, that so far as I am conserves to my own Views and Designs, I have done it for the Sake of what I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally believe will be found at last to be <HI>divine Truth</HI>; and
<PB REF="006010_0006_10277125D5C85310"/>
with an Aim (so far as it may please GOD to bless my weak Endeavours) to pre∣vent, at least in some Measure, an Inundation of (what are commonly called) <HI>Pelagian</HI> and <HI>Arminian</HI> Errors; which, to my best Observation, have a very threat∣ning Aspect on the dear Churches of God in this Land, and do speak their Danger of being sooner or later carried off, at least in some essential Points, from the <HI>Gos∣pel of Christ</HI> (which our Fathers valued above all their worldly Interests, and which they brought over into this Wilderness, and left as a precious Legacy to their Pos∣terity) even to the receiving <HI>another Gospel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In fine,</HI> All I shall request of the Reader, is, that you would peruse with Can∣dour, and an unbless'd Aim at Truth; compare what is here said, with the public <HI>Confessions of Faith,</HI> especially with the Articles and Homilies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but above all with the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> weighing it in the Ballance of the Sanctuary: And if in any Thing you find it contrary to GOD's Word, reject it; but so far as you find it agreeable to that sacred Standard, receive and em∣brace it. And may the Father of Lights and of Mercies guide you into a saving Acquaintance with all Truth, sanctify you by, and establish your Heart in the Truth, for Jesus Sake. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>A</HI> LETTER <HI>to the Rev. Dr.</HI> JOHNSON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING been requested by a Friend, to make such <HI>Re∣marks</HI> on that Part of your late Performance, intitled, <HI>A</HI> LETTER from <HI>Aristocles</HI> to <HI>Authades,</HI> which relates to the <HI>Promises,</HI> as to me might appear necessary, for the <HI>Vin∣dication</HI> of some of the great and precious Truths of the <HI>Gospel</HI>; and having taken said <HI>Letter,</HI> in that Part, under Considera∣tion, it appears to me most unexceptionable, in a Matter of so great Importance, as that of the <HI>Cause of GOD,</HI> wherein (as you acknow∣ledge) <HI>the eternal Salvation of Souls is very nearly concerned,</HI> to appear open and free and as I trust, you will find me equally far from a <HI>disputatious Temper,</HI> as you profess your self to be, so I hope I shall find my self, by your own Example, secured of a kind and candid Acceptance. Therefore I shall, without any further Apology, ad∣dress my self to you, Sir, in what I have to offer on this Head.</P>
<P>Now that our Readers may have a clear Understanding of this Matter, I think it proper to be noticed, that what gave Occasion to your <HI>Letter,</HI> was a <HI>Sermon</HI> published by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> of <HI>Stratfield,</HI> in Vindication of the <HI>Sovereignty of GOD,</HI> in the Dispensa∣tion of his <HI>special Grace</HI> to lost Sinners, on <HI>Exod.</HI> XXXiii. 18. In the Improvement of which Sermon it is inferred, <HI>That there are no Pro∣mises of special Grace made unto any Doings of the Unregenerate, by the Performance of which they might become intitied to it.</HI> Accordingly your <HI>Letter</HI> consists of two Parts; the Former on the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of GOD, the Latter on the Promises. It is the <HI>Latter,</HI> that I am here principally concerned with.</P>
<P>Having finished the former Head of Discourse, you introduce the latter in the following Words. Pag. 22. <HI>Indeed you was then only un∣dertaking to prove, that there are no Promises in the Scripture to the Un∣regenerate; [meaning by the Unregenerate, those (whether baptized, or not) who are under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin.]</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="006010_0008_102771692FB8C430"/>Here, that I may proceed with the greater Clearness, I shall</P>
<P>I. State the <HI>Question.</HI></P>
<P>II. Consider what is offer'd by you to <HI>invalidate</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Arguments advanced in his <HI>Sermon,</HI> in Favour of the <HI>Nega∣tive</HI> Side of the Question.</P>
<P>III. Consider what you have offer'd in Confirmation of the <HI>affir∣mative.</HI> And then,</P>
<P N="4">IV. Suggest a few Things to Consideration which serve, among many others, to persuade me, that the Truth lies on the <HI>Negative</HI> Side.</P>
<P>According to this Method, I am</P>
<P>I. To State <HI>the Question.</HI>—Now in Order to this it may be ob∣served, That the <HI>Question</HI> between Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> and you is not, <HI>Whe∣ther there be any Promises in the Bible</HI>? Which you seem, wildly enough, to insinuate. (<HI>Page</HI> 21, 22, 23.)—Nor is it,</P>
<P>Whether there are any conditional Promises made to Sinners in the Scrip∣tures?</P>
<P><HI>Neither is it,</HI> Whether it be the Sinner's indispensable Duty, in the Use of appointed Means, earnestly to seek after the Attainment of spe∣cial Grace?—<HI>Nor yet,</HI></P>
<P>Whether God's Bestowment of special Grace upon Sinners be ordinarily in the Way of the Sinners diligent, earnest, and painful Endeavours, in the Use of appointed Means? <HI>Nor,</HI></P>
<P>Whether the Encouragement Sinner's have, in the Gospel, to hope that Success may attend their thus seeking, be very great and precious?</P>
<P>Nor yet,</P>
<P>Whether the Sinner's Encouragement to hope for the Success of his En∣deavours, rises in Proportion to his Diligence and Painfulness in the Use of appointed Means?—<HI>None of all these properly belong to the Con∣troversy in Hand.</HI></P>
<P>You do indeed, Sir, charge Mr. <HI>Cooke,</HI> in some of his Expressions, with denying there are any <HI>Promises</HI> at all in the Scripture, <HI>Pag.</HI> 22. But yet at the same Time you are oblig'd to confess, <HI>That he was only undertaking to prove there were no Promises, in the Scripture, to the Unregenerate.</HI> So that it is evident, you did not really un∣derstand him to mean, what you insinuate his Words speak.</P>
<P>But to come directly to the Case.—</P>
<P>The <HI>Question</HI> properly now before us is, <HI>Whether there be Promises of the Bestowment of special Grace, made in the Scripture to unregenerate Sinners, on Condition of any Endeavours, Strivings, or Doings of theirs whatsoever?</HI> or, which amounts to much the same,</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006010_0009_1027717F6E91DC18"/>Whether God bestows special Grace on the Unregenerate, in the Way of performing a Covenant-Promise made to any Doings of theirs whatso∣ever; allowing that Promise, both as to the Matter and Being of it, to be of Meer Grace?</P>
<P>The Question being thus fairly stated, the Business is brought into a narrow Compass; and had you proved either of these, both had readily been granted; But Nothing of this Nature hath hitherto been found in your <HI>Letter.</HI> You do indeed, once and again, insist upon it, <HI>That in the final Retributions to be awarded to Men in the Life to come, God acts as a righteous judge of the Behaviour of his Crea∣tures, and rewards or punishes according to Stipulation; and that in this grand affair absolute Sovereignty has no Place.</HI> Pag. 6, 20.—And who of us ever entertained one single Thought to the contrary? What therefore, Sir, you would be at, in insisting so much on this Point, I am unable to conceive; unless you would hereby insinuate to the World, that the Rev. Author of that <HI>Sermon,</HI> referr'd to in your Letter, is of a contrary Mind, and if so, you had done well to pro∣duce your Evidence.—Or,</P>
<P>Can it once be imagined, that because God acts as a Judge in the final Retributions to be awarded to Men, at the Day of Judg∣ment, therefore he acts as a Judge also in the Bestowment of effectual Grace here in this World, while in a State of Probation? Where is the Connection between these Things? Especially, since you concede, <HI>That God is entirely sovereign and arbitrary as a Benefactor in the Distribution of his Talents and Favours, both spiritual and temporal, as proper Means of Trial and Probation in this World, i.e.</HI> (say you) <HI>the various Abilities, Capacities, Priviledges and Advantages be bestows on Mankind: He is intirely at Liberty</HI> (meaning as to these Things) <HI>to do what he will with his own.</HI> Pag. 6.— Now is not special Grace, bestowed on Men in this World, a <HI>Favour,</HI> a <HI>Priviledge,</HI> and an <HI>Advantage</HI> to those on whom it is bestowed? And is it not a preci∣ous <HI>Talent,</HI> given for Improvement, as a proper Means of Trial and Probation here? Especially since, according to your own Notion of Things, <HI>it may be, and oftentimes is lost for want of Improvement, and it's Avail to the eternal Salvation of any one, is intirely owing to a due Improvement.</HI> —So that I see not, but that according to your own Account, taken in your own Words, the great God is Lord of his own, with Respect as well to the Bestowment of special Grace, as other spiritual Priviledges and Talents dispensed to Men under the Gospel.—</P>
<P>If you say, <HI>Nay,</HI> but God bestows special Grace, not as a <HI>Bene∣factor,</HI> but as a Righteous <HI>Judge</HI> of the Behaviour of his Creatures,
<PB N="12" REF="006010_0010_1026E52A1671AE88"/>
I answer, This is the Thing you should have proved; and had you done <HI>this,</HI> instead of explaining <HI>your Way of thinking</HI> so largely, you had done something to the Purpose: but so long as this is not done, you have really done just Nothing. For it is not Acquaintance with your Way of thinking, which we want; but Evidence, that your Way of thinking is grounded upon the <HI>Word of God.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, it appears to me, you have abundantly conceded, that God acts as a <HI>Benefactor</HI> in the Bestowment of special Grace, when in Pag. 8. you grant that <HI>Every Thing beyond what is just sufficient to render Being desirable, even to a perfect Creature how obedient soever, is Matter of meer sovereign Goodness, in which God may go into what Variety be pleases: Much more</HI> (say you) <HI>must the whose System of the Go∣spel to fallen Man be Matter of meer sovereign free Grace.</HI>— Now if the whole System of the Gospel bestow'd on fallen Man, in this State of Probation, be, in an eminent Degree, Matter of <HI>meer sovereign free Grace,</HI> because it goes far beyond what is just sufficient to render Being desirable, Why is not the Bestowment of <HI>special</HI> Grace on some of the fallen Race, in this State of Probation, at least in an e∣qual Degree, Matter of <HI>meer sovereign free Gift?</HI> Is not the Be∣stowment of <HI>special</HI> Grace on some of the fallen Race, at least as much beyond what is just sufficient to render Being desirable, as the System of the Gospel; since the former is the End, and Design of the latter?— Again,</P>
<P>You acknowledge, that <HI>common</HI> Grace is given of God, as a <HI>Bene∣factor</HI>; your Words are, <HI>absolutely given in Christ to all,</HI> Page 25. By which I presume you intend, <HI>Given</HI> in a Way of <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> by an <HI>absolute Proprietor.</HI> And if so, then I ask, Since God bestows <HI>common</HI> Grace as a <HI>sovereign Benefactor,</HI> why not <HI>special</HI> Grace too? Seeing according to you, <HI>special</HI> and <HI>common</HI> Grace differ in Degree only, not in <HI>Kind</HI>; so that all that is necessary in Order to render <HI>common</HI> Grace, where it is bestowed on any, <HI>special,</HI> is only the Addition of some further Degrees of the same <HI>Kind.</HI> And since you grant, that God bestows some <HI>Degrees</HI> of <HI>common</HI> Grace, as a <HI>Benefactor,</HI> in the Way of <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> How does it appear, that God never <HI>adds</HI> such further <HI>Degrees</HI> of the same Kind, as are necessary to render it <HI>spe∣cial,</HI> in the same Way of Sovereignty? Especially since you grant, as above, that <HI>What is beyond what is just sufficient to render Being de∣sirable,</HI> — <HI>God may go into what Variety be pleases.</HI> i.e. There is no Objection justly lying against it (according to you) if God pleases to add those further Degrees of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> same <HI>Kind,</HI> that are necessary to render <HI>common</HI> Grace, where it is bestowed, <HI>special.</HI></P>
<P>But still more express, if it be possible, is what you say in Page
<PB N="13" REF="006010_0011_102771AE88BC2908"/>
5, 6. where you tell us; <HI>In Order to think clearly on this Subject,— it seems, to you, very necessary to distinguish between the Consideration of God as a Benefactor, and as a Judge: And between the Bestowment of various Talents and Favours upon Men in this Life, which is a State of Probation, and the Retributions to be awarded in the Life to come, accord∣ing to what Use they shall have made of them here. In the one</HI> (i.e. in the Bestowment of various Talents and Favours upon Men in this Life, you say) <HI>God acts as a sovereign Lord of his Favours: In the other, as a righteous Judge.</HI> Now is it not certain that the Bestow∣ment of <HI>special</HI> Grace belongs to the State of <HI>Probation</HI> in this Life, and not to the State of <HI>Retribution</HI> in the Life to come? And is it not certain, that those endowed with this precious <HI>Talent</HI> here, will receive a <HI>Reward</HI> in the Life to come, according to their <HI>Improve∣ment</HI> here? And if so, then, Is it not certain, according to your own Distinction, that God acts as a <HI>Benefactor,</HI> and not as a <HI>Judge</HI> in the Bestowment of it? So that, by your own express Declarations, you seem intirely to have given up the Question.— However, I shall r.ow proceed, according to what I have proposed,</P>
<P>II. To consider what <HI>you have offered</HI> to invalidate Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Arguments, advanced in Favour of the <HI>Negative</HI> Part of the Question. Where it is observable, after you have proposed the Question, as above, your first Attack is by way of Query, thus; <HI>But, pray Sir, how did you prove it? Why by this Argument</HI>; <Q>If God had bound himself by his <HI>Promise,</HI> to any of his Creatures, he is no more at perfect <HI>Liberty,</HI> either to grant, or with-hold the promised Blessing, as may please him.</Q>—<HI>Now</HI> (say you) <HI>surely if this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no Promise at all, to Good, or Bad, is consistent with the divine Sovereignty</HI>; and so on.—</P>
<P>Here, Sir, you must have Patience with me, whilst: I attempt to set this Matter in a true Light; because, I apprehend, you have at least, when we have made the best of it, here committed a <HI>Blundery,</HI> and then made your own Mistake the intire Ground of your break∣ing out into some warm Reflections upon the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooke,</HI> Author of the <HI>Sermon</HI> referr'd to; as excluding the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> and contem∣ning the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> as an <HI>utterly senseless</HI> and <HI>unmeaning Thing.</HI> P. 21, 22. An awful Charge this! and still more so to him that brings it against another, if founded intirely on his own <HI>Mistake.</HI> Now, in or∣der to set this Matter in a clear View, it may not be amiss, to take No∣tice, that the Argument quoted by you is fetcht from the <HI>Author</HI>'s Improvement of that Subject, in the Way of <HI>Inference,</HI> viz: <Q>That it is a great <HI>Mistake,</HI> and of very <HI>dangerous</HI> Consequence, which many carnal Person under the Light of the Gospel fall into, who
<PB N="14" REF="006010_0012_102771B022BC0760"/>
will persuade themselves, that they are <HI>able</HI> (with the common Concurrence of divine Providence in upholding their Beings and Faculties) to <HI>do that</HI> which hath a certain <HI>Connection</HI> with, or which shall <HI>assuredly issue in,</HI> their <HI>Conversion</HI> and eternal Salvation.</Q> (<HI>Serm.</HI> Pag. 16.) That is, as the <HI>Author</HI> abundantly explains him∣self, throughout the following Part of that Discourse, <Q>They per∣swade themselves, that they are able to <HI>do that,</HI> which will <HI>intitle</HI> them to certain <HI>Promises</HI> of the Bestowment of <HI>effectual Grace.</HI></Q>— And having said several Things for the Illustration of this Point, he at length argues in this Form, <HI>viz:</HI> <Q>If God be a <HI>Sovereign</HI> Dispenser of his saving Graces and Favours, and may grant or with-hold them, according to his <HI>meer good Pleasure,</HI> as I have en∣deavoured before to shew; then Sinners in their <HI>natural</HI> State have no <HI>Claim</HI> to the <HI>Promises.</HI></Q>—The Form of Reasoning here made use of, is plainly that of an <HI>hypothetic</HI> Syllogism.—The <HI>As∣sumption,</HI> or Minor Proposition, viz. <Q><HI>That God is a sovereign Dis∣penser of his saving Grace, and may give, or with hold it, according to his meer good Pleasure,</HI></Q> This the Author intimates he had before made good. The <HI>Consequence</HI> is clear and undeniable, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That if God be a <HI>Sovereign</HI> Dispenser of his saving Grace to Sinners, may grant, or with-hold it, according to his meer good Pleasure, then, <HI>Sinners have no Claim to it by gracious Promises made by God to any Doings of theirs.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now the whole Design of the <HI>Author</HI> in the Use of those Words (quoted by you) was to confirm this <HI>Consequence</HI>; and lay open the <HI>Inconsistency</HI> there is, between God's bestowing saving Grace on the Sinner, in the way of <HI>sovereign free Favour,</HI> as being at perfect <HI>Li∣berty,</HI> either to grant, or with-hold it, according to his meer good Pleasure,—And his acting herein at the same time in the Character of a Judge or Rewarder, <HI>obliged</HI> by his <HI>Promises</HI> to the Doings of the Sinner. And the Words fully answer the Purpose, for which they were used; for if God once makes a <HI>Promise</HI> to his Creatures, he is no more at perfect <HI>Liberty,</HI> whether to grant, or withhold the promised Blessing. So that the <HI>Inconsistency</HI> between these two is equal to that of the same Person's being <HI>bound</HI> and <HI>free,</HI> at the same Time, and in the same Respect: Things impossible in Na∣ture, opposite States, Contraries, that can never agree to one and the same Person. So that if one of these be <HI>true,</HI> the other must necessarily be <HI>false.</HI> Thus it is evident, the Words you quote, do fully prove what they were brought to prove.</P>
<P>Now instead of properly denying any Part of the Argument, or discovering any Weakness in it, you only with great Assurance af∣firm,
<PB N="15" REF="006010_0013_102771B1AE1DE880"/>
that <HI>surely if this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no</HI> Promise <HI>at all, to God or Bad, is consistent with the Divine</HI> Sovereign∣ty: <HI>and then where is there any Place for any</HI> New Covenant, <HI>or indeed</HI> Old <HI>either? And if the Case be so</HI> (say you) <HI>away with the Bible sure enough?</HI> and so on.</P>
<P>But pray, Sir, think a little, whether you have Truth with you, in what you here affirm. You say, <HI>If this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no Promise as all, to God or Bad, is consistent with the di∣vine Sovereignty</HI>—With your Leave, Sir, Had you here justly and carefully distinguished, and said, This Argument proves, that no Promise at all to Good or Bad, is consistent with absolute <HI>Sovereign∣ty,</HI> in Respect to conferring the Good promised: <HI>i.e.</HI> That there∣in God acts not as a <HI>Sovereign,</HI> at perfect Liberty, to grant, or to with-hold the Good promised; because, in that Particular, he hath <HI>obliged</HI> himself by his gracious <HI>Promise</HI>: you had expressed your self much more agreeable to the <HI>Truth.</HI> This is what that Argument was brought to prove, and undeniably does prove.—But, <HI>Dear Sir,</HI> How does this exclude the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> or not leave any <HI>Place for it</HI>? or how does it <HI>contemn the Sacred Scriptures, as a meer Imposture, a meer Force, and utterly a senseless and unmeaning Thing</HI>? Had you, Sir, kept to Truth in this Instance, you had saved all those hard Speeches, with which you fill up a great Part of three Pages together, (p. 21, 22, 23.)</P>
<P>However, granting, this Argument proves, as is above conceded, yet how does it from hence appear, that <HI>no Promise,</HI> to Good or Bad, is <HI>so</HI> consistent with the divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> as to allow any Place for <HI>New Covenant,</HI> or <HI>Old</HI> either, or the <HI>Being</HI> of any Promises at all! This is what you confidently enough affirm, that the Argument proves, if it proves any Thing. But this is your own grand Mis∣take: you have, in this particular, evidently gone beyond the Truth. How do you infer, that <HI>if God's obliging himself by gracious Promises, to any of his Creatures, be inconsistent with his being at Li∣berty to giant or with-hold the Thing promised, then it is inconsistent also with his making any Promises at all, or entering into any Covenant at all!</HI> I can't see how God's being <HI>obliged</HI> by his Promises, <HI>when made</HI> to any of his Creatures, and so not being at Liberty to perform, or not perform them, as he pleaseth, does in the least militate against the <HI>Being</HI> of any Promises at all, or subvert the New Covenant.</P>
<P>Further,</P>
<P>Are not the <HI>Author</HI>'s Words, which you quote, and call <HI>this Ar∣gument,</HI> most evidently <HI>true</HI>? Nay, are they not so true, as that, from Reason, Scripture, and the Attributes of God, it is impossible
<PB N="16" REF="006010_0014_102771BAAFA743B8"/>
they should be otherwise than true? For if a Promise made to ano∣ther be, in it's own Nature, <HI>binding,</HI> and God be a God of <HI>Truth,</HI> who <HI>cannot lie,</HI> then it is impossible but that, if God makes a Pro∣mise to any of his Creatures, it must be binding, and his Truth obliges him to Performance. Which is the Sum total of what is contained in the Author's Words. And if so, how was it possible, Sir, that you should make (shall I say?) such dreadful Work, with a plain, rational, scriptural Truth, as on the Account thereof, to throw out those black Imputations on the Rev. <HI>Author</HI>! However, I charitably hope and believe that all this, in you, arises from nothing worse than a gross Mistake, and may be imputed to a too hasty Proceeding, without clear Ideas. Yet in Faithfulness to the Cause of Truth, and to you, Rev. Sir, I must observe, 'tis evidently such a Mistake as is very <HI>blame-worthy,</HI> and scarce excusable.—And that,</P>
<P N="1">1. Because on this <HI>Mistake</HI> alone you evidently ground all those <HI>censorious,</HI> and <HI>unchristian Reflections</HI> you make on the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooke,</HI> in your Letter, <HI>Pag.</HI> 21, 22, 23. Where you represent him as one <HI>flying in the Face of the whole Scriptures; denying any Promi∣ses at all—destroying the very Being of the New Covenant—and by Consequence, of the whole Design, and Purport of all revealed Religion!</HI> This you confess is a <HI>heavy Charge,</HI> and grieve over the Gentle∣ness having brought it upon himself, and then resolve all into this, as the Means by which he has done it, <HI>viz.</HI> his having asserted, that, <HI>If God had once bound himself by his Promise to any of his Creatures, be is no more at perfect Liberty either to grant or with-hold the promised Blessing, as may please him, but is inviolably holden by his own Promise.</HI> A Truth, as evident both from <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> (and as inno∣cently asserted) as any other Truth in the whole Book of God: And yet, by some unknown Art of yours, the Rev. Author must be thus blackned! How is it possible for Innocence it self to escape, where men will allow themselves in such Treatment of one ano∣ther?</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Aggravation attending this Mistake, is, that it was committed in a Case so exceeding <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>easy</HI>; that it is scarce conceivable, how any one unprejudic'd and duly disposed (though but of a common Capacity) should fall into it.—Had the Case re∣quired uncommon Sagacity, deep Penetration, or accurate Discern∣ing, in order to distinguish between God's Promises obliging him so as to be inconsistent with his being at perfect Liberty, either to perform or not perform them, <HI>when made,</HI> and their obliging him so as to be inconsistent with their <HI>being made</HI> at all,—the Mistake had
<PB N="17" REF="006010_0015_102771BC575079B0"/>
been much more excusable. But since those Ideas are, not only distinct, but very manifestly so, it is hardly conceivable, how any one should imagine such a Connexion, or so near a Relation be∣tween them, as that the one should be infer'd from the other; which is the present Case.</P>
<P>To conclude this Particular, though I am resolved, so far as pos∣sible, consistent with Truth, to be on the charitable Side: Yet I can do no less than refer it to your own serious Consideration, whether it be not evidently from your own intire <HI>Mistake,</HI> at least, that you charge all those frightful Things mentioned on the Rev. Author: And if you find this to be the Case, I would charitably hope, you will give the World Conviction by your Practice, as well as by your Words (Page 1.) <HI>That you desire nothing more, than to know the Truth, that you may be governed by it.</HI></P>
<P>You go on to produce some Proof, <HI>that there are Promises, in the Scriptures</HI>: what no one, I suppose, ever denied. You appeal to any Man of common Sense, that reads the <HI>Bible</HI> carefully, whether there be not <HI>Promises</HI> in it: And then very gravely quote 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 4. to prove the Point. Here I shall only appeal, with you, to any Man of common Sense, whether this Management be not trifling, and unworthy a grave Divine? But you carry on your Appeal still further, and expostulate, "<HI>Whether it be not manifestly the Design and Tendency of the whole Scriptures, from the Beginning to the End, to inculcate these two Points,</HI> viz. <HI>To put Mankind upon the most vigorous Activity in seeking and pursuing their everlasting Happiness</HI>; and then <HI>to ascertain to them Success in so doing</HI>?" Is it not (<HI>say you</HI>) one of the first Things you read in <HI>Genesis,</HI> after the Fall (4. 7.) <HI>If thou dost well, shalt thou not be accepted</HI>? And the last in <HI>Revela∣tions</HI> (22. 14) <HI>Blessed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have a Right to the Tree of Life</HI>?</P>
<P>I answer, If these qualifying Words, viz. <HI>through well doing,</HI> be ad∣ded, either expresly or implicitly, to your Propositions, they are both true, and can be made good from the Scriptures: otherwise they are both false; for the Scripture no where puts Mankind upon seeking their everlasting Happiness, or ascertains them Success in the Pursuit, in any other Way than that of <HI>Well-doing,</HI> truly such in the Account of <HI>God, i. e.</HI> Doing <HI>his Commandments</HI>; which being thus understood (as certainly they must be, in order either to their being true, or there being any Pertinency in the <HI>Texts</HI> brought for their Proof) what is there in them to your Purpose? Will the Con∣sequence hold good, That, because God has promised <HI>eternal Life</HI> to those, who do his Commandments (who in the Way of <HI>Well-doing
<PB N="18" REF="006010_0016_102771C3D88C7838"/>
seek for Glory</HI>) Therefore he has promised the Bestowment of <HI>spe∣cial Grace,</HI> to the Doings of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> that are under the Guilt and Dominion of Sin?</P>
<P>How then you should once imagine (if really you did so) that these <HI>Texts</HI> had any Reference to the Question in Hand, is beyond me to conceive; unless it should be supposed, that <HI>well-doing</HI> in the Account of God, or (which is the same) <HI>Doing his Commandments,</HI> so as to have <HI>Right to the Tree of Life,</HI> is what agrees to the <HI>Unregene∣rate,</HI> under the Guilt and Dominion of Sin: which certainly none will pretend to.</P>
<P>Besides, Is it not exceeding clear from the Occasion and Design of those Words, quoted from <HI>Gen.</HI> 4. 7. (if intended in a Gospel-Sense) That by <HI>well-doing</HI> there must be meant Nothing short of Compliance with the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> presenting Services, and Of∣ferings to the blessed God with a Respect had to the <HI>Mediator,</HI> by <HI>Faith,</HI> for their <HI>Acceptance?</HI> And is it not expresly witnessed by the Holy Ghost (in <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 4.) <HI>That by Faith</HI> Abel <HI>offer'd a more excel∣lent Sacrifice than</HI> Cain? And if so, is it not certain that <HI>Cain</HI>'s not of∣fering his Sacrifice in <HI>Faith</HI> was his <HI>doing not well,</HI> so that <HI>Sin lay at the Door,</HI> and stood in the Way of God's gracious <HI>Acceptance</HI>? Is it not also abundantly evident, that the Design of the Lord's Rea∣soning with <HI>Cain,</HI> wherein these Words are made Use of, was to point out to him his own <HI>Sin,</HI> as the true Ground of that <HI>Differ∣ence</HI> (whereat he was much offended) made by the holy God, be∣tween his Sacrifice and his Brother's, in point of <HI>Acceptance</HI>; And thereby to set before him Matter of Conviction, that <HI>his Anger</HI> a∣gainst God, and against his Brother, was intirely groundless?—<HI>And the Lord said unto</HI> Cain, <HI>Why art thou wroth? And why is thy Coun∣tenance fallen? If thou dost well, shalt thou not be accepted</HI>? i. e. (according to good Expositors) If thou hadst <HI>done well,</HI> as thy Brother did, thou shouldst have been <HI>accepted</HI> as he was, <HI>viz.</HI> If thou hadst offer'd thy Sacrifice in <HI>Faith,</HI> with an Eye to the <HI>Mediator</HI> for A∣cceptance, thou hadst been equally <HI>accepted</HI> of God with thy Brother. <HI>And if thou dost not well, Sin lieth at the Door,</HI> i. e. If through the Pride of thine Heart, not duly considering thy own Sinfulness, or the infinite Purity of my Nature, and that the Way of Life by the first Covenant, the Way of <HI>immediate</HI> Approach to, and Acceptance with God, by any Services or Offerings whatsoever, is by Man's Apostacy intirely and for ever shut up, and awfully guarded by a Band of Angels, and a flaming Sword, that turns every Way to keep the Way of the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> i. e. that Way of Life by Man's <HI>doing the Law,</HI> or personal Obedience, the <HI>Doing</HI> in order to Life pro∣posed
<PB N="19" REF="006010_0017_102771C55CFA55C0"/>
in the <HI>first Covenant,</HI> which (it seems) the Use of the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> as a Sacrament of that Covenant, was design'd to ratify and confirm, and that the only Way now of Approach to, and Ac∣ceptance with an infinitely holy God, for the fallen Creature, is by <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Mediator</HI>; If thus arrogantly, in thy own Self-sufficiency, thou hast presumed to approach unto God, and present thy Offer∣ing in a meer moral or legal, and <HI>immediate</HI> Way, and not by <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Mediation</HI> of the promised <HI>Seed,</HI> in this <HI>thou hast done not well,</HI> so that <HI>Sin lieth at the Door:</HI> this thy <HI>Unbelief binds Sin</HI> upon thee, exposes thee to Punishment, and is a Bar in the Way of any the least Expression of my <HI>Respect</HI> to thee or thy Offer∣ing. And of these Things you have had proper Notice, as well as your Brother: therefore if after all you will dare thus presumptuously to approach me in this antiquated <HI>legal</HI> Way, and not in the <HI>new</HI> and <HI>living Way,</HI> through a <HI>Mediator,</HI> you can blame only your own Folly for the Disappointment you are angry at.</P>
<P>Now that this is the plain Meaning of these Expressions, con∣strued in an Evangelical Sense, and in Analogy with the Christian Revelation, is evident. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is certain, <HI>Cain</HI>'s <HI>Fault</HI> in this Matter must be, at least espe∣cially, his <HI>not</HI> offering his Sacrifice in <HI>Faith,</HI> respecting the <HI>Mediator,</HI> the promised <HI>Seed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is certain, the Lord's <HI>Design,</HI> by Reasoning with him, in the Use of these Words, must be, to <HI>point out</HI> to him his <HI>Fault,</HI> in this Matter.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is therefore certain, that these Expressions, <HI>If thou dost not well,</HI> must point out his Fault in <HI>not</HI> offering his Sacrifice in <HI>Faith,</HI> and consequently that the <HI>doing Well,</HI> spoken of as that upon which he should have been <HI>accepted,</HI> must mean his <HI>offering his Sacrifice in Faith</HI>: for if his <HI>Unbelief</HI> was that <HI>not doing well,</HI> whereby he failed of Acceptance, then his <HI>Faith</HI> must be that <HI>doing well,</HI> which would have secured his Acceptance.— Upon the whole therefore, if by <HI>doing well</HI> here, as spoken of to <HI>Cain,</HI> be meant his complying with the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> approaching to God through a <HI>Mediator,</HI> and presenting his Offerings <HI>in his Name,</HI> and if this be evidently con∣nected with his <HI>Acceptance</HI> with God, or his having Right to any the least Expression of God's <HI>Favour,</HI> How is it possible by this <HI>Text</HI> to prove, or from it justly to insinuate, That the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> under the Guilt and Dominion of Sin, i. e. Short of Faith in the Mediator, have a Right to the Bestowment of <HI>special Grace,</HI> by Vir∣tue of some <HI>Promise</HI> made (though supposing it of meer Grace) to certain Doings of their own?— Whether this be not to pervert this
<PB N="20" REF="006010_0018_102771C86B4E0770"/>
Scripture from it's true Meaning, I refer to all impartial and judici∣ous Readers.</P>
<P>But it is especially wonderful to me, Sir, when you seemed to fetch so large a Compass, and carry the whole Scripture before you, from the Beginning of <HI>Genesis</HI> to the End of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> as tho' every Page and Line were on your Side of the Question, that on such a Survey of the whole sacred Canon you should fix on <HI>this Text</HI> in particular, as one most clear and full to your Purpose; a Text which, not only does not contain the lest Shadow of a Hint in Favour of your Opinion, but is a clear and shining Testimony against it!—</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P>If the Performance of that <HI>Duty,</HI> which as to the <HI>general Nature</HI> of it, we are sure, and for any Thing the Scripture informs us, as to the <HI>particular Circumstances</HI> attending it (except the Want of <HI>Faith</HI>) was agreeable to the <HI>Will of God,</HI> was notwithstanding this <HI>rejected</HI> of God for the Want of <HI>Faith</HI>; What clearer Testimony can be given, <HI>That God is obliged by no gracious Promises, to shew his special Favour to the fallen Creature on any Condition, short of Faith in the Me∣diator?</HI> Was not <HI>Cain</HI> by awful Experience convinced of this? And does not this Example contain Matter of more powerful Conviction, to all Mankind acquainted with it, than any Declaration by meer Words could do? Inasmuch as it is a Verification of what God has said, in the <HI>last Verse</HI> of the preceeding <HI>Chapter</HI>: Signifying, that God himself, as a consuming <HI>Fire,</HI> is engaged against any of the fallen Race's being entitled to his special Favour, by any Means whatso∣ever, short of <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Mediator.</HI> But to proceed,</P>
<P>In the next Place you assert a <HI>Right,</HI> at least a <HI>conditional Right</HI> to certain Blessings, passed over to us by the Promises.— "<HI>What else</HI> (say you) <HI>can be made of them, but that God designed to pass over a Right, at least a conditional Right to his Creatures of what he promises them</HI>?—The <HI>Matter</HI> and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing of the Promises</HI> indeed (you con∣ceed) are <HI>of meer sovereign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Grace;</HI>" But <HI>surely</HI> (say you) <HI>not∣withstanding this, when he has been graciously pleased to grant us these precious Promises, it must have been his Design to pass over a Right to us of the Blessings promised,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a conditional Right.</P>
<P>Here Sir, I must confess my self unable, with any Certainty, to fix on your Meaning; And while this is the Case, it is impossible for me to determine, what I should think proper to reply, in Case the Meaning of what is said were ascertain'd. However, while by this loose Manner of dealing in doubtful Generals, we are left un∣capable of making a pertinent Reply, with any Certainty, to what is intended: Yet at the same Time we are secured, that such Man∣ner
<PB N="21" REF="006010_0019_102771CA257E7320"/>
of Dealing can never prove any Thing against or hurt the Cause, that is thus opposed, except it be in the Minds of those, who are car∣ried away by Sounds, without any determinate Ideas. Nevertheless to make the best Guess I can in the Case.—</P>
<P>If, by a <HI>conditional Right to the Blessings promised,</HI> you mean a Right to <HI>Grace and Glory, and every good Thing,</HI> pass'd over to us in Case of an <HI>upright Walk</HI> before God, I readily grant it; and that this Right is given us on the Score of God's meer Grace in <HI>Christ.</HI> But if you mean (as I think you must, in Order to mean any Thing to your Purpose) by a <HI>conditional Right to Blessings promised,</HI> a Right to the Bestowment of <HI>effectual converting Grace,</HI> pass'd over to the <HI>Unrege∣nerate,</HI> on Condition of certain Doings of <HI>theirs</HI>; in this Case you proceed on a false <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> and evidently take for granted, that very Point in Debate, and which you should have proved. "<HI>In his Right therefore</HI> (say you) <HI>we must plead, who has purchased this Be∣nefit for us, and not in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do, which we can only humbly consider as meer Qualifications, necessary to render us capable of receiving what God in Christ hath freely promised.— We must plead.</HI>—if you here mean pleading for the Bestowment of effectual <HI>converting</HI> Grace; and if by <HI>any Thing we do</HI> being <HI>considered only at meer Qualifications,</HI> &amp;c. you mean something less than what hath in it the Nature of a <HI>Condition,</HI> What is this short of giving up the Question? For if there be no <HI>Conditions</HI> on Man's Part, then special Grace is not bestowed in the Way of God's <HI>performing his Promise to any Doings</HI> of the Sinner as such. But if, by <HI>our Doings being considered only as meer Qualifications,</HI> you mean something that hath in it the Nature of a <HI>Condition,</HI> to which a Promise of the Be∣stowment of effectual converting Grace is annexed, then where is the Injustice you charge upon the <HI>Author,</HI> for representing your Doctrine as asserting the Sinner's <HI>Right,</HI> arising from the Perfor∣mance of such <HI>Condition,</HI> and his <HI>pleadable Claim</HI> thereupon to the Good promised?</P>
<P>Again, If, by <HI>the Benefit purchased for us,</HI> be meant a <HI>conditional Right to eternal Salvation,</HI> or the <HI>Gospel</HI> it self, and the Covenant-Promises therein, whence such conditional Right ariseth; it may safely be granted, that Christ hath purchased this Benefit for us.—But if, by <HI>the Benefit purchased for us,</HI> you mean, among other Things, a conditional Right to the Bestowment of <HI>converting Grace,</HI> passed over to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> in the Gospel-Promise, or a Right granted them on Condition of certain <HI>Doings</HI> of <HI>theirs,</HI> then what you have said in the above-quoted Passage is intirely to be set aside, as founded on a Supposition not true. The Being of the Sinner's <HI>Right</HI> to the Be∣stowment
<PB N="22" REF="006010_0020_102771CC1CB8A940"/>
of converting Grace, by Virtue of any Promises made to his own Doings or Endeavours, is the very Thing called in Question and therefore I call it a <HI>Supposition not true,</HI> and till it be proved, must look upon it in that Light.</P>
<P>In a Word, what you have said above of a <HI>Conditional Right passed over to us,</HI> and <HI>of the Benefit purchased for us,</HI> was either meant to in∣clude in it the Idea of a conditional <HI>Right</HI> to the Bestowment of <HI>con∣verting</HI> Grace, passed over to <HI>unregenerate</HI> Sinners, or not. If this be included, then, for the Reasons above, what you have said here is to be intirely set aside, together with that you have said of the View in which our <HI>Doings</HI> are humbly to be considered. But if <HI>not,</HI> then what you have there said, is nothing to the Purpose. And so I may pass on to consider the Grounds of what you further advance by Way of <HI>Charge</HI> against the Rev. <HI>Author,</HI> in the following Words.—</P>
<P>"<HI>It was therefore</HI> (say you) <HI>very unjust for you to put Things in such a ridiculous Lights as you did, to talk of</HI> owing, claiming, challenging, <HI>&amp;c. No-Body ever dreamt of using such Language to God, which could not become an Angel, much less a fallen, sinful Creature, when the Matter, and indeed the very Being of the Promises is Matter of free Grace.</HI></P>
<P>By Way of Reply here, I say,</P>
<P N="1">1. It may be considered, that the Author, in making Use of these Expressions, was only designing to personate those of your Opinion, who maintain, that <HI>converting Grace</HI> is bestowed according to <HI>Works</HI> done by the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, <HI>in the Way of God's performing his Covenant-Engagements,</HI> made to cer∣tain <HI>Seekings</HI> and <HI>Strivings</HI> of theirs. And now because the Author did not set himself to correct their several Ways of expressing their own Ideas in this Matter;—as one, That <HI>by his Endeavours he was insured of the Bestowment of effectual Grace</HI>; Another, That <HI>he was entitled, had a Claim, or Right</HI>:—A Third, That <HI>he was thereby inter∣ested</HI>;—And some so bold in Expression, as to assert, That <HI>God had promised to their Endeavours, and by their Endeavours they could therefore challenge</HI>:— Because (I say) the Author did not enter into Dispute with this Sort of People, for their <HI>assuming</HI> and <HI>challenging</HI> Language, nor teach them in what Manner of Expression, Persons of <HI>that Opi∣nion</HI> should address themselves to God, which did not at all belong to his Subject, but instead thereof endeavoured to convince them of the grand <HI>Error at Bottom,</HI> which was the mistaken Ground of all that Variety of bold Phrases made Use of by them; therefore he is thus very <HI>unjust,</HI> in your Judgment: But, I charitably believe, not so on this Account, in any other Person's in all the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is observable here, that what you condemn in the Author,
<PB N="23" REF="006010_0021_1026E534F1224EE0"/>
as <HI>unjust</HI> and <HI>setting Things in a ridiculous Light,</HI> is not the menio∣ning only of some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of these Expressions, but of such a <HI>Variety,</HI> and of some as well as others; as seems evident by your adding an <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (Page 24) Now had the Author mentioned only such Phrases as sounded most <HI>harsh,</HI> to express that Connexion between the Do∣ings of the Unregenerate and the Bestowment of effectual Grace, maintained by those of your Opinion; or had you condemned only such Expressions, I had readily so far conceded. But since the Au∣thor makes Use of a great Variety of Expressions, and among o∣thers, of many of the <HI>lowest</HI> Sort, by which such Connexion can pos∣sibly be expressed, such as—the Sinner's being by his Endeavours <HI>Insured, Assured, Intitled, Interested;</HI> nay, <Q>doing that which hath a <HI>certain Connexion</HI> with, or which shall <HI>surely issue</HI> in their Conversion.</Q> (<HI>Ser.</HI> Pag. 16, 17, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) And since you condemn, in the Author, the Use of these <HI>lowest</HI> Expressions, by which any <HI>sure Connexion</HI> between the Sin∣ner's Endeavours, and the Bestowment of effectual Grace, can possibly be express'd; Is not this again entirely to give up the Question? For if the Use of the lowest Expressions, by which this <HI>Connexion</HI> can be express'd, is to be condemned as <HI>very unjust</HI> and <HI>putting of Things in a ridiculous Light,</HI> it must be because there is indeed <HI>no Connexion</HI> between the Doings of the Unregenerate, and the Bestowment of effectual Grace: And if so, then <HI>no Promises</HI> made to these at all.</P>
<P>The Reason assign'd here with a View to make this Charge good against the Author, is, <HI>That the Matter, and indeed the very Being of the Promises, is Matter of free Grace.</HI> But what Force of Argument does this carry with it? Have not you with your own Pen confus∣ed this Reason, by what you say in your 23d Page? Where, hav∣ing conceded, That <HI>the Matter and Being of the Promises is of meer so∣vereign free Grace,</HI> you subjoin, <Q><HI>But surely notwithstanding this, when he has been pleased to grant us these precious Promises, it must have been his Design to pass over a Right to us of the Blessings promised.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now,</P>
<P>That the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Being</HI> of the <HI>Promises</HI> being Matter of <HI>meer</HI> Grace should in <HI>pag.</HI> 23. be <HI>no Reason</HI> at all, why a <HI>Right</HI> should <HI>not pass by such Promises,</HI> and yet be assigned as a <HI>good Reason</HI> (in <HI>p.</HI> 24) to censure the <HI>Author</HI> you have in Dealing, as <HI>very unjust,</HI> and <HI>ridiculing your Doctrine,</HI> while representing it as asserting a <HI>Right passed by such Promises</HI>; this must, I think, be placed among the Inconsistencies of your Letter.—So very difficult a thing is it, for any one, in the De∣fence of <HI>Error,</HI> constantly to speak the same Things! And when this is the Case, it must necessarily be equally difficult for the Rea∣der
<PB N="24" REF="006010_0022_102771D087851838"/>
to fix upon the true Meaning of such an Author; or indeed for his Answerer to confute what is said in one Page, and not at the same Time confirm what is said in another—You close the Para∣graph before us with a summary Reflection: "<HI>Considering Things in this Light</HI> [i.e. as the Matter, and indeed the very Being of the Promises, is Matter of meer Grace] <HI>then what Sense is there in your</HI> Categoric Syllogism, <HI>and all your other Reasonings on this Subject</HI>?" Where you professedly offer a View of the Promises in <HI>this Light</HI> as a sufficient <HI>Refutation</HI> of all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had said on this Subject in his Sermon. But the Weight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Force hereof having been already considered, I refer it to every impartial Judge.—And now pass on to what I further proposed,</P>
<P>III. To consider what you have offer'd in <HI>Confirmation</HI> of the <HI>Af∣firmative</HI> Part of the Question.</P>
<P>Thus the next Paragraph of your <HI>Letter</HI> begins.— <HI>But still you, "insist upon it, that there is no Promise to the Unregenerate.</HI>"—Mean∣ing by the <HI>Unregenerate</HI> (as in <HI>pag.</HI> 23. you express your understand∣ing of the Author) <HI>these (whether baptized or not) who are under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Where, having said several Things, you demand of the <HI>Author</HI> to tell you, <Q>if <HI>there be no</HI> Medium <HI>between an obstinate relentless Sin∣ner, and one that is throughly</HI> regenerate, <HI>in his Sense of the Word</HI>?</Q> And having explained what you mean by a Sinner in a <HI>middle</HI> State, between the <HI>Obstinate</HI> and the <HI>Regenerate,</HI> viz. <Q><HI>One who is brought by the Assistance of common Grace—to be serious, and really solicitous for Salvation, so as being deeply sensible of his own Guilt and Weak∣ness, earnestly to cry to God for Help, and strive in earnest that he may be qualified for God's Help.—Now</HI> (say you) <HI>this is the Man to whom I say the Promises to divine efficacious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or special Grace do belong.</HI> This is he <HI>who hath, to whom shall be given,</HI> in our Savi∣our's Sense, <HI>Math.</HI> 25. 29.</Q>—That is, such an awakened striv∣ing Sinner, though by your own Confession <Q><HI>not yet throughly con∣verted from Sin to God,</HI></Q> you say, <HI>is the Man</HI> who <HI>hath,</HI> in our Sa∣viour's Sense, where he saith, <HI>Unto every one that hath, shall be given, and he shall have Abundance.</HI></P>
<P>Here, since you confidently affirm your Opinion on the Place, though without advancing any the least Shadow of Proof, I shall take Leave to enquire into the Meaning of this <HI>Text</HI>: in Order to which, it may not be amiss to observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Scope and Design of the <HI>Parable of the Talents,</HI> to which this Text belongs, is evidently to shew, wherein our <HI>Rea∣diness</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="006010_0023_102771D3751C67B0"/>
for Christ' s coming to <HI>Judgment</HI> must consist; and what will be the main <HI>Inquiry</HI> of the <HI>great Day,</HI> upon which the final Decision of our everlasting Fate will then turn, <HI>viz.</HI> whether we have done <HI>well,</HI> or <HI>ill,</HI> in the Account of the New Covenant? whether we've been <HI>good</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> Servants of the Lord, or <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>slothful,</HI> in the Management of the <HI>Talents,</HI> with which we have been in∣trusted?—</P>
<P>This doubtless will readily be granted by every impartial atten∣tive Reader, who duly considers the Occasion of this <HI>Parable,</HI> viz. The Discourse, begun by our Saviour, in the preceeding Chapter, of his Second coming to <HI>Judgment,</HI> and continued down through this: followed here <HI>first</HI> with the Parable of <HI>the Ten Virgins,</HI> evidently referring to Christ's Coming to Judgment, at the End of the World, and principally design'd to awaken Christians to the greater Watch∣fulness from the Consideration of the Uncertainty of the Time. v.13. <HI>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the Day nor the Hour, wherein the Son of Man cometh.</HI>—Next follows this Parable of the <HI>Talents,</HI> ma∣nifestly design'd (as has been observed) to hold forth wherein our <HI>Readiness</HI> for Christ's second Coming to <HI>Judgment</HI> will consist, <HI>viz.</HI> in our having <HI>sincerely improved the Advantages,</HI> with which we have been intrusted, and so having approv'd ourselves <HI>good and faithful Servants,</HI>in the Account of the <HI>New Covenant.</HI> And wherein this will consist, is further illustrated in a particular Instance, put for all the rest, viz. that of honouring the Lord with our Substance, in Acts of <HI>Charity</HI> to the Poor, done for <HI>Christ</HI>'s Sake: contain'd in a Description of the Process of the <HI>last Judgment,</HI> continued to the End of the Chapter.—And hence,</P>
<P N="2">2. By the <HI>Reckoning,</HI> here mentioned as <HI>deferred for a long Time</HI> is plainly to be understood the <HI>final Account,</HI> which we must all in that Day render to God, of our respective Improvements. This is fur∣ther evident from the Reward assign'd to the <HI>Faithful,</HI> and the Doom passed on the <HI>Unfaithful.</HI> To the one is said, <HI>Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord</HI>: but of the other,—<HI>Case the unprofitable Servant into outer Darkness, there shall be Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth.</HI> Where our Saviour insensibly slide, out of the <HI>Parable,</HI> into the <HI>Thing</HI> in∣tended to be signified: and thereby gives us an infallible Key to the whole; it being plain here, that these Expressions, <HI>Outer Dark∣ness,</HI> where there is <HI>Weeping</HI> and <HI>Gnashing of Teeth,</HI> are, by a Pe∣riphrases, used by our Saviour to signify the Miseries of the Damned in <HI>Hell.</HI>—Hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. It follows, that by <HI>him that hath,</HI> is evidently meant one who shall <HI>then</HI> be found to <HI>have,</HI> in the Account of God, what the New
<PB N="26" REF="006010_0024_102771D53A5CA898"/>
Covenant requires, what in the Eye of that Covenant will denomi∣nate him a <HI>Good and Faithful Servant,</HI> or one that has <HI>done well.</HI> This is plain, in Regard 'tis with an evident Reference to the making up of that final Account in the Day of <HI>Judgment,</HI> that he is here said to <HI>have.</HI>—And hence,</P>
<P N="4">4. It is equally evident, that by the following Expression, <HI>To him shall be given,</HI> is meant the <HI>final Reward</HI> of Glory in the future World.—</P>
<P>Now if the <HI>Reckoning</HI> here mentioned, refers intirely to the final Account in the Day of <HI>Judgment</HI>; and if it be the Scope and De∣sign of this <HI>Parable,</HI> to point out what that is, which will then stand us in Stead, in that Day of <HI>Reckoning,</HI> viz. <HI>Well-doing,</HI> in the Ac∣count of the <HI>New-Covenant</HI>; And if by <HI>him that hath,</HI> be meant one that hath already exemplified that <HI>Well-doing,</HI> and is thereupon adjudg'd unto <HI>Glory</HI>; How is it possible that the <HI>seeking striving Sinner,</HI> "not yet converted throughly from Sin to God," but "still under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin," should be "the Man <HI>that hath,</HI> in our Saviour's Sense," in this Parable?—What <HI>hath</HI> such a Man? <HI>Hath</HI> he that which would stand him in stead, were he <HI>now</HI> standing at the Bar of God? <HI>Hath</HI> he what the <HI>New Covenant</HI> demands? <HI>Hath</HI> he what, in the Eye of that Covenant, will denominate him a <HI>good and faithful Servant,</HI> one that <HI>has done well,</HI> and stands intitled to eternal <HI>Glory?</HI> Can this possibly be true of one, who (according to your own Concession) is <Q>under the Do∣minion and Guilt of Sin,</Q> and consequently an Unbeliever and an Impenitent in the Gospel-Sense, unreconciled to God, and in a State of Enmity and Rebellion against God, and under a righteous Sen∣tence of Condemnation? Nay, is not <HI>the Man that hath, to whom shall be given,</HI> in this <HI>Parable</HI> of the Talents, evidently represented by our Saviour as one who has pass'd the awful <HI>Trial</HI> of the Great Day, and is publickly approved, and welcomed to Glory? <HI>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant,—enter into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI> And does the <HI>seeking, striving</HI> Sinner, which you describe, answer the Character of <HI>this</HI> Man? Hath he pass'd his last Trial? Is he openly approv'd of his Lord, and welcomed to the State of the Blessed? How therefore you could, so confidently as you do, af∣firm <HI>him</HI> to be <HI>this Man,</HI> in our <HI>Saviour's Sense,</HI> I must leave.</P>
<P>If you should excuse your Mistake, by alledging the Judgment of some <HI>great and learned Men,</HI> that have construed this Parable in Fa∣vour of the Opinion you here advance; I answer, <HI>Every Error,</HI> ad∣vanced in the Christian World, has its Pretence of being grounded on some Text of <HI>Scripture.</HI> Nor is this at all to be wonder'd at: for
<PB N="27" REF="006010_0025_102771DEE7F23628"/>
when once Persons have fallen into any erroneous Opinion, the Fruit of their own Imagination, and what appears to them reasonable, in their own very partial View of Things, they will easily fancy such Opinion supported by this or that Text of sacred <HI>Scripture</HI>; it mat be, by a great Variety: And sometimes (because it is impossible, in that Case, to fix upon any Text, that is full and clear to their Pur∣pose) they pretend, that the <HI>Current of the whole Scripture</HI> runs that Way, from the Beginning of <HI>Genesis</HI> to the End of <HI>Revelation.</HI> Ne∣vertheless, certainly this is not to come to the Scriptures as a pure Fountain, to derive our Opinions from thence; but to bring our O∣pinions with us to the Scripture, and by the Help of a strong Imagi∣nation, to mould the Bible by them. Now,</P>
<P>This I take to be evidently the Case of those who urge a Promise to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> from this <HI>Parable.</HI> They first, it seems, con∣clude from their own View of Things, that such a <HI>Promise</HI> to the Sin∣ner is highly <HI>reasonable,</HI> as may secure it in <HI>his own Power</HI> (at least <HI>morally</HI>) to be everlastingly <HI>happy</HI>: Which Conclusion being ground∣ed partly on a <HI>favourable</HI> Thought of the State of the fallen Creature, especially on the State of an <HI>awakened reforming</HI> Sinner, as describ∣ed above, they seem to conceive some <HI>Fitness</HI> in such a State of the Sinner, <HI>qualifying him for Help from God,</HI> and constituting him a pro∣per Subject of <HI>gracious Promises.</HI> This seems to be intimated in your Notion of there being a certain "<HI>Medium</HI> between an <HI>obsstinate relentless Sinner,</HI> and one that is <HI>throughly regenerate,</HI> or intirely devoted to God," and seems to be the Ground of your insisting that the Sinner be brought to "<HI>strive in earnest,</HI> that he may be <HI>quali∣fied for God's Help.</HI>"—And now being fix'd in this Opinion, that there is a <HI>Meetness</HI> in this State of a Sinner to receive <HI>Help</HI> (i. e. <HI>efficaci∣ous Aid,</HI> or special Grace) <HI>from God,</HI> these Gentlemen bringing this Opinion with them to the sacred Text, they read here that <HI>To every one that hath, shall be given,</HI> and thence conclude a <HI>Promise</HI> from God made to the <HI>striving Sinner,</HI> though not yet thorowly devoted to God in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But, good Sir, by whose Authority do they make this Conclusion? Does; it slow from divine Promises? Christ indeed in the <HI>Parable</HI> hath said, <HI>Unto him that hath, shall be given</HI>: But hath he any where: said, that the <HI>striving</HI> (but unconverted) <HI>Sinner</HI> is this Man <HI>that hath</HI>? Or, Is there in all this <HI>Parable</HI> one Word, or Syllable, about the <HI>striving Sinner,</HI> or of the Bestowment of <HI>converting Grace</HI>? Surely, nothing like it. No, This is the preconceived <HI>human Opinion</HI> (I spake of) which every one brings with him to the <HI>divine Text,</HI> who infers a <HI>Promise</HI> to Sinners from this <HI>Parable.</HI> And it is impossible
<PB N="28" REF="006010_0026_102771E1DBCAF998"/>
to argue any Thing, for their Opinion, conclusively from the <HI>Para∣ble</HI> it self.</P>
<P>You go on to say, "<HI>And I am under an invincible Necessity of un∣derstanding</HI> MATTH. 7. 7. and 11. 28. LUKE 11. 13, &amp;c. <HI>as belong∣ing to such as be.</HI>" These Promises, you hold, do belong to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> though under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, yet <HI>seek∣ing,</HI> and <HI>striving,</HI> as aforesaid. But how do you prove this? Why first by the <HI>Necessity you find your self under</HI> thus <HI>to understand them</HI>: You plead, that you are <HI>necessitated</HI> so to understand them, and that you <HI>cannot for your Life help</HI> thus interpreting them, &amp;c. As if you meant to carry the Argument intirely by Dint of this Plea from a felt <HI>Necessity</HI> upon you.—But since it is allowed, on all Hands, that wrong Conceptions through Prejudice, or Want of a clear Under∣standing of the Case, may be the Ground of such an apprehended <HI>Necessity,</HI> as well as the Evidence of Truth, you will doubtless allow this Consideration to be absolutely set aside in the present Debate, as containing nothing conclusive or argumentative in the Case be∣fore us.</P>
<P>You proceed, and say,—"<HI>Can any one be so absurd as to interpret these Promises thus? You that have already received the special Grace of God,</HI> Ask, and ye shall receive:— <HI>You that have already found Mercy,</HI> Seek, and ye shall find:—<HI>You to whom the Gate of Mercy is already opened and are already got within it,</HI> Knock, and it shall be opened:— <HI>You who have already get Rest,</HI> Come to me, and I will give you Rest, <HI>&amp;c.— Is not this</HI> (say you) <HI>making perfect</HI> Nonsense <HI>of the precious Promises of God! To me it seems nothing can be more so. And yet this must be your own interpretation</HI> (say you to the Rev. <HI>Author</HI>) <HI>if you deny their being made, even to the Unregenerate</HI>:" i. e. to such of them as have been described.</P>
<P>The Argument used here is what is called <HI>Reductio ad Absurdum</HI>: And its whole Force lies in this That these <HI>Promises</HI> cannot be <HI>other-wise</HI> interpreted, than as belonging to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> while such, but by resolving their Meaning into <HI>perfect Nonsense.</HI> Now, if this can be proved, I own, the Argument must be yielded: For, to be sure, we must not <HI>make perfect Nonsense of</HI> the holy Scriptures.— But where is the Proof? You, Sir, indeed have said it; and that's all:—To refute this your Notion of the <HI>Absurdity</HI> of understanding these <HI>Promises</HI> otherwise, than as belonging to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whilst such, it may suffice to observe, that it is intirely grounded on one or other, or all of the following <HI>false Hypotheses</HI>: viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That these conditional Promises were not spoken, or meant to <HI>Believers,</HI> but to others <HI>exclusive</HI> of them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="29" REF="006010_0027_102771E3A138D260"/>2. That the <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Inquiry</HI> here, or what is here enjoined to be <HI>asked</HI> and <HI>sought,</HI> is limited to the first Grace of sav∣ing <HI>Conversion,</HI> and extends not to After-Grace, in <HI>progressive</HI> Sancti∣fication.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the <HI>asking, seeking, knocking,</HI> and <HI>coming</HI> to Christ, unto which the <HI>Promise</HI> is here annexed, are to be conceived as Doings that are <HI>short</HI> of that <HI>Faith,</HI> which implies a thorow Conversion to God in Christ.</P>
<P>These, I think, must be the Suppositions, on which your Notion of the <HI>Absurdity</HI> of our Interpretation is intirely grounded; Which being fairly examined, and removed by the Force of Truth, these <HI>Promises</HI> may be interpreted as we understand them, without any the least Shadow of <HI>Absurdity,</HI> and be sure, without any Danger of their being made <HI>perfect Nonsense.</HI> And now,</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>these Things are here supposed,</HI> and made the intire Ground of that <HI>Absurdity,</HI> pretended to be in understanding those <HI>Promises</HI> otherwise than as belonging to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whilst such, is evi∣dent from this Consideration, That the <HI>removing</HI> of these <HI>Suppositions</HI> is the removing of all Appearances of <HI>Absurdity,</HI> and leaves not any the least Shadow of it in the Case. For if these Promises are spoken and meant to <HI>Believers,</HI> and the Matter of the <HI>Petition</HI> here enjoin∣ed, is not limited to the first Grace of Conversion, <HI>exclusive</HI> of After-Grace in Order to progressive Sanctification, where is the <HI>Absurdity</HI> you speak of, even according to your own Reading of the Text? "<HI>You that have already received the special Grace of God,</HI> that are true Believers, Heirs of the Promises, that have Grace and Glory and very good Thing laid up in them, <HI>Ask; and ye shall receive</HI>;— you <HI>who have already found Mercy, Seek and ye shall find,</HI> i. e. further Mercy, or <HI>more Grace.</HI> Is it <HI>absurd,</HI> that he which hath <HI>Life,</HI> should <HI>have it more abundantly</HI>? Is it at all <HI>absurd,</HI> that the Believer, who has received the <HI>first</HI> Grace, should he enjoined to <HI>ask, seek,</HI> and <HI>knock</HI> at the Door of Mercy, for further Supplies? Or, is it <HI>absurd,</HI> that he should be promised <HI>Success</HI> in so doing? So, if the <HI>Asking,</HI> to which the Promise is here annexed, be asking in <HI>Faith,</HI> where is the <HI>Absurdity</HI> of understanding these Promises <HI>otherwise</HI> than as be∣longing to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> continuing such? Nay, how is it possible that they should belong to them at all, while continuing in their <HI>Unbelief</HI> and not <HI>through Christ having Access by the Spirit unto the Fa∣ther</HI>?— Thus it is fully evident, here, that the whole Pretence of <HI>Absurdity,</HI> in understanding these Promises otherwise than as belong∣ing to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> depends intirely on the Truth of this, and the other Suppositions; Which if found <HI>not true</HI> the Objection you
<PB N="30" REF="006010_0028_102771E612290470"/>
make, vanishes intirely. So that what remains for me to do here, is,</P>
<P N="2">2. To evince the utter <HI>Falseness</HI> of each of these <HI>Suppositions.</HI>— And,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Supposition, that these Promises were not spoken and meant to <HI>Believers,</HI> but to others <HI>exclusive</HI> of them, is evidently a <HI>Mistake.</HI> For it is certain, that Christ's <HI>Disciples</HI> were present at the preaching of this Sermon on the Mount, <HI>Chap.</HI> 5. 1. And likewise that what is said by our Saviour in <HI>Luk.</HI> 11. 13. was said directly to his <HI>Disciples,</HI> on their Request that he <HI>would teach them to pray,</HI> v. 1. Certain it is therefore, that these Promises were spoken and meant to <HI>Believers,</HI> and not to others <HI>exclusive</HI> of them; unless it be sup∣posed here, that Christs <HI>Disciples</HI> were not Believers; what no one, I presume, will pretend. Nay, which is more, to make good this Supposition, it must be proved, that there was not one of the whole Company present a <HI>Believer.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Supposition, that the <HI>Matter</HI> of the <HI>Petition</HI> and Inqui∣ry here, or what is here enjoined to be <HI>asked</HI> and <HI>sought,</HI> is limited to the first Grace of <HI>Conversion,</HI> exclusive of consequent Grace in <HI>progressive</HI> Sanctification, is also evidently <HI>false.</HI> For since these Du∣ties were enjoined upon the <HI>Disciples</HI> themselves, with Promises of Success, and not on others <HI>exclusive</HI> of them, it must therefore be impossible, that the Matter of <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Inquiry</HI> enjoined them should be limited to the <HI>first</HI> Grace, because this they had <HI>already</HI> re∣ceived; and therefore to enjoin them to ask and seek <HI>that,</HI> would be an Inconsistency and Absurdity indeed.—The Supposition,</P>
<P N="3">3. That the <HI>asking, seeking,</HI> &amp;c. to which Success is here <HI>promised,</HI> are Doings s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of that <HI>Faith,</HI> which implies an intire Devotedness to God in Christ, is also evidently <HI>false.</HI> For, if the <HI>asking</HI> and <HI>seek∣ing,</HI> &amp;c. to which the <HI>Promise</HI> here is annex'd, be any Doings <HI>short of unfeigned Faith,</HI> then we are to understand our Saviour here to <HI>en∣join</HI> these Duties without regarding their necessary Principle, which is <HI>Faith.</HI> The Injunction ought in Reason to be interpreted in the same Latitude as the Promise that is annexed. And can it once be imagined, that our blessed Saviour would enjoin his Disciples to <HI>ask, seek,</HI> and <HI>knock</HI> by Prayer, without <HI>Faith unfeigned</HI>? Would not this be to teach them to approach unto God otherwise than through a <HI>Mediator</HI>; contrary to the grand Design of the <HI>Gospel</HI>? Which is stiled Rom. 16. 26. <HI>The Revelation of the Mystery made known to all Nations for the Obedience of Faith.</HI> Would it not to be to enjoin what could by no Means be pleasing or acceptable to God? Since (Heb. 11. 6.) <HI>Without Faith it is impossible to please God.</HI> Do not the Scriptures
<PB N="31" REF="006010_0029_102771EDA612AC70"/>
enjoin us (Col. 3. 17) <HI>to do all In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ</HI>? And can this be done without <HI>Faith</HI>? Yea, do not the Scriptures require the Exercise of <HI>Faith,</HI> in every Instance, to accompany Pray∣er? Seeing they declare it the Will of God (1 Tim. 2. 8.) <HI>That Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands, without Wrath and Doubting.</HI> And can Prayer be performed with <HI>holy Hands lifted up,</HI> where that <HI>Faith</HI> is wanting, which <HI>purifieth the Heart</HI> and Hands? But certainly, it cannot be done <HI>without Doubting.</HI> Does not the Apostle <HI>James</HI> ex∣presly caution all against this Mistake, of placing Dependance on the Success of Prayer destitute of <HI>Faith</HI>? Jam. 1. 5, 6, 7. <HI>If any Man lack Wisdom, let him ask of Gods, that giveth to all Men liberally, and up∣bradeth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in Faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth, is like a Wave of the Sea, driven with Wind, and tossed. For let not that Man think that he shall receive any Thing of the Lord.</HI> q. d. Taking into Consideration the Extent of the New-Covenant, the whole Design of God's Mercy to fallen Mankind through a <HI>Mediator,</HI> and the unbounded Goodness of God's Nature, whereby, in this New-Covenant-Way, he deals out to all Men most liberally, without upbraiding any; yet nevertheless, upon the largest View of these Things, let no Man fall into this Mistake, that a <HI>faithless Prayer</HI> will take hold of God, or obtain any Mercy at all, at his Hand.—From all which, and much more that might be offered, were it needful, it is incontestibly evident, that the last of these Suppositions, as well as the two former, is intirely a Mistake.</P>
<P>Nor is it less evident, that the <HI>Coming to Christ,</HI> to which a Promise of Rest stands annexed (<HI>Matth.</HI> 11 28.) is plainly meant of comings by <HI>Faith</HI>; and it were easy to shew, it is generally so; understood by Divines, of every Denomination. But if an Appeal be had here from the Authority of Men to the Authority of God, and according to that most excellent Rule of interpreting Scripture by Scripture, you are disposed to rest satisfied in a Decision of this Matter, by our Lord Jesus Christ himself, we then have it in <HI>John</HI> 6. 35. <HI>I am the Bread of Life: be that cometh to me, shall never hun∣ger; and be that believeth on me, shall never thirst.</HI> Where it is ex∣ceeding obvious, that <HI>coming to Christ, as the Bread of Life,</HI> and <HI>be∣lieving on him,</HI> are used as Terms of the same Import, and equal Sig∣nificancy: the same spiritual and everlastingly satisfying Blessings being <HI>promised</HI> to each.</P>
<P>Now, upon the whole, If it be certain, that the <HI>Intire Reason</HI> you have assign'd, why these Promises should be understood, as belong∣ing to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whilst such, is the <HI>Absurdity</HI> of understanding them <HI>otherwise</HI>; which indeed you say cannot be done without
<PB N="32" REF="006010_0030_102771F0A10166E0"/>
making <HI>perfect Nonsense</HI> of them;—and if it be also certain, that this Notion of the <HI>Absurdity</HI> of understanding them otherwise, be grounded wholly on certain <HI>Suppositions</HI>; Which Suppositions, no less certainly are meer <HI>Mistakes,</HI> and utterly ungrounded: Then it must, I think, undeniably follow, that the whole <HI>Reason</HI> you have assign'd why these Promises should be understood as belonging to the Unregenerate, whilst such, is intirely <HI>removed</HI> and <HI>vacated.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus rescued these <HI>Texts</HI> from that unnatural Force put upon them, by means of <HI>false</HI> Suppositions, and restored their <HI>true</HI> and <HI>genuine</HI> Meaning; all that are honestly minded, and have no <HI>preconceiv'd Scheme</HI> of their own to serve by <HI>wresting the Scriptures,</HI> will (I doubt not) be able to read these <HI>Promises</HI> as made immedi∣ately to the <HI>Children of God,</HI> to excite them to be much and ear∣nest in the great Duty of <HI>Prayer,</HI> from the Consideration of the Certainty of <HI>Success</HI> to attend the <HI>Prayer of Faith; the effectual ser∣vent Prayer of a righteous Man availing much.</HI> Though they are im∣provable also as an Excitement and Encouragement to all <HI>others,</HI> to be concern'd that they may be brought likewise to <HI>ask, seek, knock,</HI> and <HI>come</HI> by <HI>Faith</HI> to the Mercy of God through the <HI>Mediator,</HI> as the only certain Means of Success. taught us in the Scriptures of Truth, by Divine <HI>Promises</HI> made thereto.</P>
<P>Having, as you supposed, established the Sense of these Texts in your own Favour; you, in the next Place, thus proceed. "<HI>For God's sake, Dear Sir, let us take Care that we do not, from a violent Attach∣ment, to any preconceived humane Schemes, pervert the plainest and most obvious Declarations, and Promises of the Gospel. To me it is manifest, that this is what those on your Side really do; and that your whole System, where it is peculiar, is not founded on the holy Scriptures (taken in the whole, and critically read and considered) but on the empty Cob-webs of</HI> Scholastical Metaphysics (vain Philosophy, Science falsly so called): <HI>together with some few obscure</HI> Texts, <HI>not rightly understood, for want of a critical Skill in the ancient Languages, and the Notions and Contro∣versies of those Times, and for want of an exact Attention to the Scope and Argument of the sacred Writers; In Consequence of which you ma∣nifestly torture the plainest Texts, to make them speak your Sense, and so</HI> corrupt the Plainness and Simplicity of the Gospel, <HI>and in Effect make it a meer unintelligible Riddle.</HI>"</P>
<P>Here, Sir, being struck with the utmost Surprize, I must beg leave to <HI>pause</HI> a while, as not able suddenly to resolve what is best to say! — Is <HI>this</HI> the <HI>Charity</HI>!—<HI>This</HI> the following after <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI>! — which you seem so earnestly to pray for, in your next Page.—Is <HI>this</HI> the melting of your <HI>Bowels,</HI> for them, over whom
<PB N="33" REF="006010_0031_102771F8070B7780"/>
(<HI>Pag.</HI> 22.) you profess to <HI>grieve,</HI> and for whom (<HI>Pag.</HI> I) you ex∣press your <HI>Charity,</HI> as <HI>Serious Christians,</HI> that are not at all sensible of their Mistake! Was it possible Sir, that you should conceive any the least Tendency, in these astonishing Lines of yours, to win upon their Affections, or to set before them any Matter of Conviction;— unless it were of the present Temper of their <HI>quondam</HI> Friend to∣wards them?</P>
<P>Could you once imagine, Sir, that the Loudness of your Cry a∣gainst others, as being <HI>violently attached to human Schemes, perverting the plainest Texts, building en empty Cobwebs</HI> &amp;c. would secure you from the same Imputations; or prevent your being; in the Sequel, found in the Number of those, against whom you make such a hi∣deous Outery? The dark Character, you have here drawn, may perhaps in the Substance of it really agree to one or other of these contending Parties: But then what Right have <HI>you,</HI> 'good Sir, to fit <HI>Judge,</HI> in your own Cause? Which, to make sure Work, you have done: and no wonder at all; that you have carried the Case in your own Favour.—However, the Right of Appeal is challenged; and the Matter chearfully submitted to the Judgment of impartial Readers, whether you have gained your Point, or not; <HI>i. e.</HI> Whe∣ther the Scriptures you have alledged, with your Reasons enforcing them, compared with what has now been replied, do clearly and fully prove the <HI>Affirmative</HI> Part of the Question before us; I say, <HI>clearly</HI> and <HI>fully,</HI>—for such ought to be the Proof in this <HI>important</HI> Case; since the Opinion you've advanced, affects the very Constitu∣tion of the <HI>New-Covenant,</HI> and adds to it an <HI>essential Branch,</HI> that we know nothing of.</P>
<P>The Covenant of Grace we acknowledge; the Tenor whereof is plainly this, <HI>He that believeth on the Son of God hath everlasting Life, and shall never perish.</HI> According to this, God is a Covenant-God and Father to <HI>Believers.</HI> But a <HI>Covenant-Obligation,</HI> whereby God is bound to give his <HI>special efficacious Grace,</HI> and so his <HI>Spirit,</HI> and his <HI>Christ,</HI> to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> by Virtue of his own <HI>Promise,</HI> made to any <HI>Do∣ings, Seekings, Strivings</HI> of theirs, short of that <HI>Faith,</HI> by which the <HI>Just do live,</HI> is what <HI>we</HI> don't know any Thing of, neither do the <HI>Scriptures of Truth,</HI> nor indeed any publick <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> in the Protestant World, that we are acquainted with, nor even the <HI>Arti∣cles</HI> and Homilies of your own Church of <HI>England.</HI> And therefore until this Point, which you so contend for, be settled, by clear and full Evidence from <HI>Divine Testimony,</HI> we must not, we dare not, ad∣mit of it, left we be found guilty of <HI>adding to the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P>But what is most of all surprizing here, is, that you should not only
<PB N="34" REF="006010_0032_102771FB464A7940"/>
so peremptorily decide the Case in your own Favour, but that you should in so confident a Manner accuse and condemn all on the other Side, as "<HI>perverting the plainest Declarations of the Gospel,—founding their whole System, so far as it is peculiar</HI> (which at least must in your Sense, take in this of denying <HI>Promises</HI> of special Grace to any Do∣ings of the <HI>Unregenerate</HI>) <HI>on the empty Cobwebs of scholastical Meta∣physicks, vain Philosophy, Science falsly so called,—Scripture are rightly understood, for Want of critical Skill in the antient Languages, and exact Attention to the Scope and Argument of the sacred Writers; in Conse∣quence of which</HI> (say you to die Rev. <HI>Author</HI> and those of his Mind) <HI>you manifestly torture the plainest Texts to make them speak your Sense, and corrupt the Simplicity of the Gospel, and make it in Effects a meer unin∣telligible Riddle.</HI>"</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I pray tell me, was this truly the Case with all those famous <HI>Bishops, Doctors,</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who have given their Suffrages full in Favour of the <HI>Negative</HI> Side of the Question? Or was this indeed the Case with the whole Body of the Clergy of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the first Dawn of the Reformation? And was this the Case with all those other eminent Divines at home and abroad, living and dead, that might be mention∣ed, as favouring the <HI>Negative</HI> in the present Question? In sober Earnest, tell me, Sir, Do all these <HI>pervert the most obvious Promises of the Gospel, from a violent Attachment to human Schemes</HI>? Do all these godly, learned Men <HI>torture the plainest Texts, to make them speak their Sense</HI>? Do they all, in this Point at least, <HI>build upon the empty Cobwebs of Scholastick Metaphysicks, and vain Philosophy</HI>? Have none of them ever been Masters of a sufficiect <HI>critical Skill in the ancient Languages</HI>? &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I might here confront vour Opinion with the contrary Judgment of many of the greatest Writers in your own Church: from whom I might easily collect enough to fill up a considerable Volume, But I shall at present give you only a Quotation from that renowned <HI>Prelate,</HI> pious and learned Bishop <HI>Hopkins,</HI> on the <HI>Covenant</HI> (P. 152) where having said several Things on this Head, he sums up the Matter thus. <Q>In brief, the <HI>absolute</HI> Covenant promiseth the first Grace of Conversion to God; the <HI>Conditional</HI> promiseth <HI>Life, if</HI> we be <HI>converted.</HI> The <HI>Conditional</HI> promiseth <HI>Life, if</HI> we <HI>believe</HI>: The <HI>Absolute</HI> promiseth <HI>Faith,</HI> whereby we may believe to the saving of our Souls; and there∣fore it is called an <HI>absolute</HI> Covenant, because the <HI>first Grace</HI> of Con∣version to God <HI>cannot</HI> be given upon <HI>Conditions.</HI>—It is indeed com∣monly wrought in Men by the right Use of <HI>Means,</HI> as hearing the Word, Meditation, Prayer, &amp;c but these Means are not <HI>Con∣ditions</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="006010_0033_102771FE64B0E220"/>
<HI>of Grace,</HI> because we have found that in some Instanecs God hath not limited himself to them.—And indeed, what is there that can in Reason be supposed a <HI>Condition</HI> of God's bestow∣ing the Gift of the <HI>first Grace</HI> upon us? Either it must be some Act of <HI>Grace,</HI> or of meer <HI>Nature.</HI> Not of <HI>Grace,</HI> for then the <HI>first</HI> Grace would be <HI>already</HI> given: Not of <HI>Nature,</HI> for then <HI>Grace</HI> would be given according to <HI>Works,</HI> which is the <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Upshot</HI> of PELAGIANISM.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, for my own Part, though I am far from concluding, that <HI>every one,</HI> who is in this Error, is a <HI>Pelagian</HI>: Because this may be the Case with some, who have, ere they were aware, been induced, by what they have head plausibly said on this Point, to entertain a favourable Thought of it: Yet I am fully persuaded, that this learn∣ed BISHOP <HI>throughly understood what be here says,</HI> and that when ever <HI>Truth</HI> in this Point is searched to the Bottom, the <HI>Affirmative</HI> Part of ike Question will be found the pernicious Fruit of Error, growing on the <HI>Pelagian</HI> Root of denying the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> as held forth in our publick <HI>Confessions</HI> of Faith, and in the <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Homilies</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI>:—And that, reserving Credit to the Doc∣trine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> it will be found a much harder Task to <HI>recon∣cile</HI> with the <HI>Divine Attributes</HI> this unaccountable Notion of a <HI>Grant</HI> in the Gospel, of <HI>New Covenant-Blessings,</HI> on Condition of <HI>Old Cove∣nant-Works,</HI> i. e. certain Doings of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whilst such, than to reconcile with the Divine Attributes, the Notion of God's permiting fallen Mankind to come into the World in such a corrupt and sinful State, as not to have it secured in all Respects in their <HI>Power</HI> (as well <HI>Morally,</HI> i. e. notwithstanding any inherent Vicious∣ness or Depravity, as <HI>naturally</HI>) to be everlastingly <HI>happy.</HI> And here, Sir, by the Way, since you have been ready to impute it to <HI>Prejudice,</HI> when any among your <HI>Dissenting Brethren</HI>(as you call them) have doubted of <HI>your Orthodoxy</HI> in the grand Point of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> I would observe that you have now (on what is recited above) an advantage of considering the Matter more free from <HI>Prejudice</HI>; since it is not the doubtful Tho't, but firm persuasion of one of your own <HI>Bishops,</HI> that the <HI>Error,</HI> which <HI>you</HI> plead for is the very <HI>Sum</HI> and <HI>Up∣shot</HI> of <HI>Pelagianism.</HI></P>
<P>What now remains of your Letter, is chiefly a repeating and urging of that <HI>invincible Necessity,</HI> which you say you are under, of under∣standing these Promises as belonging to the <HI>unregenerate,</HI> i. e. whilst such. "I <HI>cannot for my Life</HI> (say you) <HI>help interpreting these, and the like Promises in this plain, easy and obvious Manner: You that have not yet received the Grace of God,</HI> for the thorow Renovation of your

Souls, <HI>Ask and ye shall receive</HI>" Again you say,—<HI>Thus I am neces∣sitated,</HI>—and—<HI>Thus I am obliged</HI>—" Which concludes the Argumen∣tative Part of your <HI>Letter,</HI> Pag. 26, 27.</P>
<P>Here I shall only appeal to the impartial Reader, Whether it be not abundantly evident, from what has been argued and remark'd a∣bove, that no such <HI>invincible Necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> or <HI>Obligation,</HI> as you plead, ariseth from any thing either expressed or implied in those sacred <HI>Texts.</HI> To me it is evident, that whenever this Matter is thorow∣ly examin'd, it will be found, that the <HI>Necessitation</HI> or <HI>Obligation</HI> up∣on you, results not in the least from the genuine Sense or true Force of these <HI>Scriptures,</HI> as unavoidably to be interpreted, as including this Point of Doctrine, which you plead to be held forth in them; but I doubt, you find and feel, in the present Debate, a pressing <HI>Neces∣sity</HI> upon you, in Order to support your <HI>Scheme,</HI> a <HI>Necessity</HI> (I say) of alledging some plausible <HI>Texts</HI> from the Book of God, to countenance your Notion of God's being <HI>obliged</HI> to the Bestowment of <HI>converting</HI> Grace, by virtue of his own <HI>Promise</HI> made to the <HI>Doings</HI> of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whilst continuing such.</P>
<P>There being an inseparable <HI>Connection</HI> between the Opinion of God's being obliged, by <HI>Covenant,</HI> as above, and what you seem to make a grand Foundation-Principle in your <HI>Scheme,</HI> (pag. 6.) "<HI>That it is inconsistent with the</HI> Attributes of God <HI>to give</HI> Being <HI>to any of his In∣telligent Creatures</HI> (the Corruption of the <HI>Fall</HI> notwithstanding) <HI>without putting them into a</HI> Condition, <HI>that (every Thing being considered, in the whole of their Nature and Duration) would render Being desirable to them</HI>;" No Wonder then, that you are so earnestly intent upon finding out some Texts of <HI>Scripture</HI> interpretable in Favour of your Opinion a∣bout a <HI>Promise</HI> to the <HI>Unregenerate.</HI></P>
<P>For if, as you say, it be thus <HI>inconsistent with the Attributes of God,</HI> to give Being to any of the Offspring of fallen <HI>Adam,</HI> without put∣ting them into this <HI>desirable</HI> State of Being, above described, then it must be also <HI>inconsistent with God's Attributes,</HI> to give them any <HI>Being</HI> at all, without securing it in their <HI>Power,</HI> in all Respects (as well <HI>Morally,</HI> as <HI>Naturally</HI>) to be, in some Degree at least, <HI>finally happy</HI>: un∣less you should suppose, that that State of Being is <HI>desirable,</HI> that is destitute of sufficient <HI>Power</HI> to be in any Degree <HI>finally happy</HI>; which doubtless <HI>you</HI> will be far from allowing.—And since you readily ac∣knowledge (pag. 24.) that "<HI>the Sinner cannot, of himself, [even under all the external Advantages of the Gospel] truly repent and turn to God,</HI> without <HI>his Help</HI>; i. e. <HI>Divine efficacious Aid, or special Grace</HI>; and so consequently without this, has not sufficient <HI>Power</HI> to be in any Degree finally <HI>happy</HI>; Is it not a clear Case, that unless you can
<PB N="37" REF="006010_0035_10277202E0F8B068"/>
weld this Link of your Theological Chain, and fasten it into the o∣ther, by proving from the Word of God, that <HI>He</HI> has actually <HI>pro∣mised Special Grace,</HI> or (as you call it) <HI>Efficacious Aid, to the Unrege∣nerate,</HI> on Condition of some Doings of theirs, <HI>whilst such,</HI> your Chain must fail you, and so your <HI>Superstructure</HI> and <HI>Foundation</HI> must necessarily sink together!</P>
<P>Hence, No Wonder, you have bestir'd your self so vigorously, in <HI>such a Season,</HI> when the Power of <HI>Sovereign Grace</HI> hath been dis∣play'd, in a Manner that is truly admirable, for Conviction, unto great Numbers in one Place and another, of this great Gospel-Truth, by happy Experience of a Work of Grace (hopefully) wrought in their Hearts; and especially since, by long Observation and Experience it is found, that according as the <HI>Work of God's Grace</HI> in the saving Conversion of Sinners <HI>sensibly goes on</HI> among a People, this <HI>Error,</HI> or mistaken Opinion of God's being by Covenant <HI>obliged</HI> to dispense his special renewing Grace, on the Doings of <HI>Ubregenerate</HI> Sinners, whilst such, <HI>sensibly goes down</HI> among them.—So that the <HI>Scheme</HI> you defend, has not only been in imminent Danger, in the late remark∣able Season of Grace; but has really fallen in the Hearts of very <HI>many,</HI> who, being (hopefully) <HI>turned from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> God,</HI> have of their own Accord confessed their full <HI>Conviction</HI> in this Point, and frequently bemoaned their past <HI>Ig∣norance</HI> in such Language as this,—<HI>Once we thought, God bestowed re∣newing Grace on Sinners, as having promised it to their Endeavours; but now we know, it is otherwise, and are convinc'd by our own Experience, agreable to the Scriptures, that when ever God converts and saves any, it is merely,</HI> because so it seemeth good in his Sight! <HI>O(say they) how spiritually blind we were! for alas, what can there be in the Doings of a wretched, sinful, all over polluted, guilty Creature, out of Christ, that an infinitely holy God should oblige himself to!</HI>—It was therefore, Sir, but reasonable to expect (considering the View which <HI>you</HI> have of Things) that you should on this Occasion <HI>bring forth your strong Reasons</HI>; and produce the whole Strength of Argument, that could be gathered, from all that hath been said on your Side of the Question, or that the Case would possibly admit in Defence of this Principle of yours. Accord∣ingly it is observable, that the Run of your Letter is correspondent with what others have said before you: and the <HI>Scriptures</HI> you quote, the same that have chiefly been insisted on by them; though to <HI>me</HI> indeed in the same <HI>groundless</HI> Manner, and very far short of bring∣ing out a Conclusion in <HI>your</HI> Favour. But relying on the Reasons already assigned, which I submit to the Impartial, I will dismiss the present Head, when I have only made one further Remark.—
<PB N="38" REF="006010_0036_1027720DEA596288"/>
How it is possible, that any Reasonable Creature should, upon a due and deliberate Meditation on those <HI>Scriptures,</HI> be able (from the pure Force of what is therein express'd or imply'd) to appeal to Om∣niscience, and say, LORD, according to my best Understanding, There clearly read thy gracious <HI>Promise,</HI> of the Bestowment of <HI>effectual con∣verting Grace,</HI> made in certain Doings of the <HI>Unregenerate</HI> whilst such—This, I must confess, is quite beyond all the Power of Discerning. I am conscious of in my self.</P>
<P>Thus I have done with the third Thing proposed, and now pro∣ceed to the next and last.</P>
<P N="4">IV. To suggest and urge some <HI>Considerations</HI> in <HI>Favour</HI> of the <HI>Negative</HI> Side of the Question before us; which will lead me to illus∣trate and confirm the main <HI>Arguments</HI> advanc'd by Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> in his Sermon.</P>

<P>It appears to me reasonable, and just, to allow The first Place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s Arguments (which you have not formally c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sidered) as they lie in his <HI>Sermon</HI>; where, under the Applicati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> having first infer'd, "That it is a <HI>great Mistake, and of danger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Consequence,</HI> which many carnal Persons under the Gospel fall in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who will persuade themselves, that by their own <HI>Doings</HI> (though t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> cannot properly <HI>merit,</HI> yet) they are <HI>insured</HI> of spiritual and sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g Mercies, by Virtue of <HI>Promises,</HI> which God hath made to them in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Word?"

He argues</P>

Creature is all this while <HI>going about to establish a Righteousness of his own,</HI> for the general Kind the same with That, required in the <HI>first</HI> Covenant.</Q>—The <HI>Author</HI> argues against that mistaken Perswasion,</P>
<P N="2">2. That it leaves Room for <HI>Boasting</HI>: And this, he justly observes, "is quite inconsistent with and contrary to the whole Tenor and main Design of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which is perfectly to exclude all Boast∣ing in and of <HI>our selves,</HI> and to lay the Crown of our Salvation on the Head of rich, free, and sovereign <HI>Grace</HI> through Christ Jesus."</P>
<P>Omitting at present the three other subservient Considerations, mentioned by the <HI>Author</HI> in his Sermon, I shall confine my Thoughts to the two above-recited: And considering these in one complex View, as they are of such near Affinity, and so closely connected, I shall vindicate them both together, for Brevity's Sake.</P>
<P>Now, to open the Way to this Defence, allow me to make a few preliminary Observations. And I say in general, If it can be made evident, that to hold certain <HI>Seekings, Strivings,</HI> or <HI>Doings</HI> whatso∣ever of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whilst such, <HI>conditional</HI> of the Bestowment of <HI>special converting Grace,</HI> or that to which the <HI>Promise</HI> of such Grace is made, be to countenance the fallen Creature's <HI>going about to establish his own Righteousness,</HI> and to allow of that Boasting, to which the Gospel every where expresly denies any Place in the Affair of <HI>bringing us unto God</HI>; it will then doubtless be acknowledged, upon such Evidence, that the <HI>Arguments</HI> above are solid and conclusive.— And the Truth of the foregoing Proposition, may, I think, be evinc∣ed by the following Considerations.</P>
<P N="1">1. That to suppose <HI>special converting Grace</HI> ensured or secured to the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> by a <HI>Promise</HI> thereof made to any <HI>Doings</HI> of theirs, whilst under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, and establishing a <HI>Con∣nection</HI> between such <HI>his Grace,</HI> and such <HI>their Doings,</HI> is to suppose God's acting properly as a <HI>moral Governor</HI> in this Affair, and making the Sinner's <HI>Works</HI> the Rule of his Dispensations, even in point of <HI>Regenerating</HI> Grace, or effectual Calling.—And again,</P>
<P N="2">2. This supposes some acceptable Degree of <HI>moral Goodness, in∣trinsick Worth,</HI> or <HI>true Excellency,</HI> in these <HI>Doings</HI> of the Unregene∣rate; something in them of vital and true <HI>Holiness,</HI> in God's Ac∣count: and implies that his Method of <HI>saving us</HI> is <HI>by Works of Righ∣teousness, which we have done,</HI> and not meerly <HI>according to his Mercy,</HI> or sovereign Grace.—Because if there were not some acceptable Measure of <HI>moral Rectitude</HI> and <HI>true Goodness,</HI> or nothing that is truly <HI>vital, spiritual</HI> and <HI>holy,</HI> in such their <HI>Doings,</HI> it seems not reconcila∣ble with the <HI>moral Perfections</HI> of God, and therefore impossible in
<PB N="40" REF="006010_0038_10277213CDAEF9B8"/>
the Nature of Things, that he should establish a <HI>Rule,</HI> respecting these <HI>Doings</HI> of theirs as the <HI>Condition</HI> of his Promise, according to which, as a moral Governor, he conducts himself in the Dispensation of his <HI>first</HI> special Grace to Sinners.—And now,</P>
<P N="3">3. To assert, that there is any the least true <HI>Vitality, Spirituality,</HI> or <HI>moral Rectitude</HI> before God, in the best <HI>Doings</HI> of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> even of Sinners in your <HI>middle</HI> Condition, i. e. "Such as are really solicitous for Salvation, but not yet throughly converted from Sin to God," and accordingly to conside in and plead any such Doings as <HI>intitling</HI> (though by virtue of the Promises only) to <HI>special Grace,</HI>—this it self is that very <HI>Boasting,</HI> which by the whole Tenor of the Christian Revelation is <HI>excluded</HI> out of the Business of our <HI>seek∣ing to be justify'd by Christ,</HI> and <HI>coming to God by him</HI> for Salvation.— And hence it inevitably follows,</P>
<P N="4">4. That to teach for Doctrine, that any the best <HI>Endeavours</HI> and highest <HI>Improvements</HI> of Sinners <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> or in your Sense of the Word, such as are "<HI>not yet intirely devoted to God</HI>" are the reveal'd federal <HI>Condition</HI> of promised converting <HI>Grace,</HI> is in true Construc∣tion nothing less than to <HI>introduce</HI> into the Scheme of Salvation that very <HI>Boasting,</HI> which the Gospel most expresly <HI>shuts out,</HI> and to pa∣tronise that <HI>going about to establish our own Righteousness,</HI> which is inconsistent with a due <HI>Submission to the Righteousness that is of God by Faith.</HI>—This Conclusion will necessarily arise out of the Premi∣ses; which, as I apprehend, admit of the easiest and most copious Proofs, from Revelation and Reason.</P>
<P>As to the Thing supposed in the <HI>first</HI> Proposition, it appears to me one; of the leading Principles in the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, and is agreable (Sir) to your profess'd Opinion, That God dispenses his <HI>special Grace,</HI> or in your Sense of the Words, his <HI>efficacious Aid,</HI> not as an absolute Proprietor and sovereign Benefactor, but as a <HI>moral Go∣vernor,</HI> and <HI>righteous Judge</HI> of the Behaviour and Improvements of his Creatures.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>second</HI> Proposition, this is strictly demonstrable from the first; since to suppose the Behaviour and Improvements of the Creature to be the <HI>Rule,</HI> which God respects, as a <HI>moral Gover∣nor</HI> and <HI>righteous Judge,</HI> in the Dispensation of his special efficacious Grace, and yet at the same time to suppose the said Behaviour and Im∣provements quite <HI>devoid</HI> of all true moral <HI>Goodness</HI> or vital <HI>Holiness</HI> in the sight of God, would be nothing less than to make two <HI>incompa∣tible</HI> Suppositions, and to run yourself into a flat <HI>Contradiction.</HI></P>
<P>So that the only Article in the Premises, that demands Proof, in
<PB N="41" REF="006010_0039_10277215926B1298"/>
Order to bring out the Conclusion, and establish the Argument in hand, is the <HI>third,</HI>—as above. And this again is too evident, to need any elaborate Confirmation of it. For the Sinner's conceiving so highly of his own <HI>Doings,</HI> or any possible <HI>Strivings, Seekings,</HI> or <HI>Comings to Christ,</HI> which he is capable of in his <HI>unregenerate</HI> Condition, and while (according to you) <HI>not yet thoroughly converted,</HI> as to imagine some true <HI>Virtue,</HI> some proper <HI>Righteousness,</HI> or moral <HI>Rectitude</HI> in such his Performances and Endeavours, and accordingly to imagine a <HI>Right</HI> to the Blessing of <HI>special Grace,</HI> or Divine efficacious Aid, <HI>pass'd over to him</HI> by Means of these his Doings and Attempt though only as Compliances with the Divine conditional <HI>Promise,</HI> in which God is supposed to have made a sure <HI>connetion</HI> between renewing Grace and such Endeavours; <HI>This,</HI> if I know any thing of Gospel-Humility, is not <HI>to think soberly,</HI> but <HI>to think of himself more highly than he ought to think,</HI> as the Case appears to me. Here is spiritual <HI>Pride,</HI> founded on vain Imaginations. Here are Falsehoods set up for Truths, and improv'd to <HI>Self-Righteousness,</HI> and to such <HI>Self-Boast∣ing,</HI> as hath much of moral Evil in it. And methinks, none should doubt whether the Gospel-Scheme of Salvation excludes <HI>this,</HI> when it is so expresly declared that <HI>Boasting</HI> (all sinful Boasting) <HI>is excluded by the Law of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>The only Point here, requiring Proof, I think is this, That the <HI>Supposition</HI> of any true <HI>moral Excellency</HI> and <HI>solid Goodness</HI> in the best possible Doings of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> whilst such, is but a meer <HI>Dream</HI> and <HI>vain Imagination.</HI></P>
<P>And though this appears to me incontestibly evident, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> from Scripture and Reason, yet because I would not anticipate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at will more properly be offer'd in another Place hereafter, I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t pre∣sent only suggest and argue a little with you upon the Impossibility, in the Nature of Things, that this <HI>Supposition</HI> should be <HI>true.</HI> For, since the sole original Standard, by which the moral Goodness or Rectitude of the Creatures Actions can be meaesur'd and deter∣mined, is the moral Perfections of God, and since <HI>Sin</HI> is the pre∣dominant Principle in the <HI>unrenewed.</HI> Man, from whence all his Actions must take their principal Denomination and have their Specification, how is it possible for the best Doings of such a Man, while under the Dominion of <HI>Sin,</HI> to harmonise in any Degree with the moral Nature of God, so as to be approvable in his Sight? It's impossible then, that the <HI>Supposition</HI> before us should have any Foundation in <HI>Truth.</HI>—And I argue upon this; If he best Doings of the Unregenerate have no proper moral Goodness in them, they then have no moral <HI>Fitness</HI> to be the <HI>Condition</HI> in a Divine <HI>Promise</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="006010_0040_1027721E0FC5BC28"/>
of special Grace; and consequently to plead such a morally unfit Condition though perform'd to the highest Degree that an unrege∣nerate State will admit of, as intitling the Doer (in Virtue of a pre∣tended Promise) to saving Grace, is to <HI>rejoice in a Thing of Nought,</HI> and to <HI>bring in</HI> that vain <HI>Boasting,</HI> which the Gospel-Scheme intirely <HI>shuts out.</HI> To suppose therefore any <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, in God's Promise, cloathed with such a <HI>Conditionality,</HI> as hath this <HI>ex∣cluded Boasting</HI> inseparably connected with it, is nothing less than to <HI>pervert the Gospel of Christ,</HI> and thwart its true Design, in this Par∣ticular.</P>
<P>It appears to me a clear Scripture-Truth, that with a View to the <HI>Exclusion</HI> of <HI>Boasting,</HI> all <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate are, in the Scheme of the Gospel excluded from being <HI>conditional</HI> of the Bestowment of <HI>special Grace.</HI>—And this Truth, I think, is demonstrable from many plain Texts in sacred Writ. To instance in a few. We read, Tit. 3. 5. <HI>Not by Works of Righteousness, which we have done, but according to his Mercy, be saved us.</HI> 2. Tim. 1. 9. <HI>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works, but according to his own Purpose and Grace.</HI>—The Apostle speaks not of a meer Salvability, but at <HI>actual Salvation</HI>; asserts a then-existing State; and points out the Method of Introduction into it, both negatively and positively.—<HI>Hath saved us.</HI> i. e. not only given us the external Means of Salvation, and brought us into his visible Kingdom, but into a justify'd and renew'd State; the Apostle speaking this knowingly for himself, and charitably for others: nor can any reasonable Doubt a∣rise here of his using the Word [saved] in this Sense. And as to the Method of bringing them into this saved State, he peremptorily determines it to be, in its negative View, <HI>not by Works of Righteous∣ness which they had done; not according to Works,</HI> any at all whatsoever, previous to and conditional of the Bestowment of saving Grace. He does not meerly say, not <HI>for</HI> Works, but not <HI>by</HI> or through them, yea, even not <HI>according to</HI> them, i, e. not with any Reference to them, as a Condition. But, in a positive View of the Case, 'twas intirely <HI>ac∣cording to God's Mercy, according to his own Purpose and Grace.</HI> His own <HI>Mercy</HI> was all his Motive to <HI>saving</HI> them: and his <HI>own Purpose</HI> his only Rule in Dispensing his Grace.—Again, we read, 1 Cor. 4. 7. <HI>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou, that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory</HI> [or boast] <HI>as though thou hadst not received it</HI>?—So Rom. 4. 2, &amp;c. <HI>If</HI> Abraham <HI>were justified by Works, be hath whereof to glory; but not be∣fore God.—To him that worketh, is the Reward not reckoned of Grace, but of Debt.—To him that worketh not, but believeth on Him who justifieth</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="006010_0041_1027722275473C88"/>
<HI>the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness.—Unto them God im∣puteth Righteousness without Works.</HI>—Again, Rom. 3. 27. <HI>Where is Boasting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of works! Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</HI> And Chap. 11. 6. <HI>If by Grace, then it is no more of Works; otherwise Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works, then is it no more Grace: otherwise Work is no more Work.</HI> Again, Eph. 2. 9. <HI>Not of Works, left any Man should boast.</HI>—And once more 1 Cor. 1. 29. <HI>That no Flesh should glory in his Presence.</HI></P>
<P>It appears to me exceeding evident from these and other parallel Texts, that with a View to the <HI>Exclusion</HI> of all <HI>Glorying</HI> or <HI>Boasting</HI> in and of ourselves, the <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate must be under∣stood, as consider'd under some certain <HI>Notion, Relation,</HI> or <HI>Quality,</HI> to be <HI>excluded</HI> from the Business of their Recovery out of a perishing State of Nature into a State of <HI>Salvation,</HI> i. e. a justify'd and sanctfi∣fy'd State. For, <HI>Boasting</HI> is said to be excluded, <HI>Not by the Law of Works,</HI> but by the Law of <HI>Faith.</HI> However, <HI>do we make void the Law through Faith? God forbid! Yea, we establish the Law.</HI> Certain∣ly therefore <HI>Works</HI> are not excluded as to their general <HI>Being,</HI> or in Respect of our moral <HI>Obligation</HI> to them; but the Law strictly requires them of every Man. And hence it is a clear Consequence, that since the <HI>Law</HI> is not made void through Faith, therefore the Exclusion of Works by the Gospel must be taken in some qualified and limited Sense, and must respect these <HI>Works</HI> as consider'd under some certain special <HI>Notion, Relation,</HI> or imagin'd <HI>Quality.</HI>—And what can these be? I answer, They are all possible mistaken Notions, Relations or supposed Qualities, under which those <HI>Works</HI> being considered, they do contain Grounds of <HI>Boasting.</HI> This is evident from the Scrip∣ture's saying, <HI>Not of Works, last any Man should boast</HI>: which shews, that were it <HI>of Works,</HI> it would threaten this Consequence, and there∣fore that the View in <HI>excluding Works</HI> is for the sake of excluding <HI>Boasting.</HI> But more particularly, the <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate are <HI>excluded</HI> with this View, when consider'd under the Notion (1.)Of their containing in them a proper <HI>Efficiency</HI> or <HI>Power</HI> to renew and purify their Hearts, cure their moral Disorders, and recover them to Happiness, in Concurrence with the external Advantages of the Gospel.—Or (2.) Of their carrying strict and proper <HI>Merit</HI> in them, to intitle them to Divine special Grace.—Or (3) Of their having in them something of <HI>Moral Goodness</HI> or true <HI>Rectitude</HI> in God's Account, to recommend them to his Acceptance, and us to his Favour.—Or (4.) Of their being an appointed <HI>Condition</HI> in the Gospel-Covenant, and having the <HI>Promise</HI> of special Grace made to them.—These are some of the mistaken Notions or Respects, under which the unrege∣nerate
<PB N="44" REF="006010_0042_1027722405659780"/>
striving Sinner may be apt to conceive too highly of his Works; and we may justly suppose, his best <HI>Works</HI> are, under all such Con∣siderations of them, <HI>excluded</HI> by the Law of Faith, for the Sake of ex∣cluding <HI>Boasting.</HI> These imply so many vain Efforts of the fallen Creature in <HI>going about to establish his own Righteousness,</HI> and to restore himself to Happiness, by Virtue of his own Sufficiency, without <HI>sub∣mitting himself to the Righteousness of God,</HI> or being dependant on his sovereign Grace for Salvation.</P>
<P>Now, though it were no difficult Task, to prove, that <HI>Works,</HI> as consider'd under all the above-mentioned Respects, are by the Gos∣pel-Scheme of Salvation <HI>excluded,</HI> for the sake of excluding <HI>Boasting</HI>; yet because 'tis the <HI>last</HI> only I am here concerned with, I shall wholly pass the others; save only so far as either of them may serve for a Me∣dium, applicable to my purpose, in the present Debate.—Two Things are proper to be attempted, for clearing the Point now before us.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That the Works of the Unregenerate are in the Scheme of Man's Salvation <HI>excluded,</HI> for the sake of excluding <HI>Boasting.</HI>—And</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Their being excluded with this View, argues that they must of Necessity be denied the Place of <HI>Conditions</HI> in any Divine Promise of special Grace.</P>
<P N="1">[I.] I am to shew, <HI>that the Works if the Unregenerate, while such, even all their best Duties, Endeavours, and Improvements whatsoever, sup∣posed by themselves or others to have some true Goodness and moral Excel∣lency, whereby they might be acceptable to God, are as considered under that Notion,</HI> excluded <HI>from the Business of a Sinner's being brought into a saved State, for the sake of excluding</HI> Boasting.</P>
<P>The Truth of this may be evine'd from sundry Considerations, As,</P>
<P N="1">1. From Scripture-Representations of the End design'd in the Ex∣clusion of <HI>Works,</HI> viz. that <HI>Boasting</HI> may be <HI>excluded.</HI>—By the Texts before cited, it appears, that <HI>Works</HI> are <HI>excluded</HI> for the sake of ex∣cluding <HI>Boasting</HI>: and if so, it must be concluded, the Design is to exclude them under <HI>every Notion,</HI> which contains the Grounds, of or leaves Room for <HI>Boasting.</HI> By Consequence, it must be the Inten∣tion of the Holy Ghost to exclude them under the Notion of their being <HI>morally good,</HI> in the sight of God; since <HI>Works,</HI> consider'd in this View, do contain evident Grounds of <HI>Boasting,</HI> or at least evi∣dently leave Room for it; Moral Rectitude being the very Image of God, which was the primitive Glory of Man, and the highest Excellency that can be attributed to any Doings of the Creature.—It were absurd, to assert that the Scripture should exclude <HI>Works</HI> for the sake of excluding <HI>Boasting,</HI> and yet at the same time to suppose
<PB N="45" REF="006010_0043_1027722619FC34D8"/>
it allows them to have any true <HI>Moral Goodness</HI> in them; since in this Case the design would be frustated, and <HI>Boasting</HI> would by no means be excluded, though <HI>Works</HI> were under every ether Notion, but this excluded. Accordingly we find, that the Holy Ghost by the Pen of the Apostle, in all that he says on this Subject in the places above cited, shews it plainly to be his Design and Drift, to exclude <HI>Works,</HI> as consider'd under this mistaken Notion of their having in them <HI>Moral Goodness,</HI> or true Holiness, in the sight of God. Thus when the Apostle uses such Expressions as these, <HI>By Grace ye are sav∣ed,—not of Works;—Not by Works of Righteousness which we have done,</HI> &amp;c. his Meaning can't be, to deny that he or others then in a re∣new'd State had before their Conversion done any <HI>Works</HI> whatsoe∣ver, that were <HI>materially</HI> good, such as praying and the like com∣manded Duties; but to disclaim the <HI>formal Goodness</HI> of them, and deny them to have <HI>true Morality</HI> in God's Account, or any such Con∣formity to his righteous Law, as makes them pleasing to Him; which the Pride and Ignorance of the fallen Creature flutter him with vain Imaginations of.—All <HI>Works</HI> therefore of the Unregenerate, as con∣sider'd under this Notion of being <HI>morally good,</HI> must by the Gospel be utterly <HI>excluded,</HI> in Order that hereby all Grounds of <HI>Boasting</HI> might be remov'd, and no Place left for it in the Scheme of Man's Salvation.—Let it be observ'd now,</P>
<P N="2">2. That all Works of the <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> supposed to be of a true <HI>moral</HI> Complexion, as alone described, are the very <HI>Works,</HI> which the Scripture clearly points out as design'd to be <HI>excluded,</HI> for the sake of excluding <HI>Boasting.</HI> Here it may suffice to cite two or three plain Texts. Thus, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 5. <HI>Even when we were dead in Sins, be hath quickned us together with Christ.</HI> (<HI>By Grace ye are saved.</HI>) The Sin∣ner's being brought into a State of Salvation is here, in the strongest Language, intirely resolved into Divine <HI>Grace</HI>: and in like Language the same Apostle declares it to be <HI>not of our selves,—not of Works,</HI> ver. 8, 9. And agreeably in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 6. <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Works are op∣posed</HI> to each other, as incompatible in this Affair. Now that <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, pretended to be of a spiritual and moral Cha∣racter, are comprehended here, and designedly by the Apostle ex∣cluded from the Business of their being brought into a <HI>saved</HI> State, appears evidently, by his fetching an Argument, for the Illustration of Divine Grace, from their <HI>antecedent</HI> State, which he describes as a State of spiritual or moral <HI>Death</HI>: and this carries in it the strongest Implication of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>apacity to do <HI>Works</HI> truly <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> These <HI>Works</HI> then, to preserve the Force of the Apostle's Reasoning, we must understand to be here meant by him, when he
<PB N="46" REF="006010_0044_1027722932FB21D8"/>
tells them, that their Salvation was not <HI>of Works.</HI>—And this Con∣struction may be enforc'd, by considering the <HI>End,</HI> for which (as he observes) <HI>Works</HI> are excluded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 9. <HI>Not of Works, lest any Man should Boast.</HI> Upon which it immediately follows, <HI>For we are God's Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good Works.</HI>—Salvation cannot be <HI>of Works,</HI> any <HI>good Works</HI> whatsoever; because none truly such in God's Account can possibly <HI>precede</HI> Salvation begun, in this being <HI>created in Christ Jesus.</HI>—Though in the first Passage the Apostle speaks of <HI>Works</HI> indefinitely, yet the <HI>End</HI> he assigns for their Exclusion, Discovers a particular Reference to such as are of a <HI>lau∣dable</HI> Aspect, and supposed by the Doers of them to be <HI>morally Good</HI> in the Account of God. Else what Grounds of <HI>Boasting</HI> could be pretended?—However, to intimate the moral specifick Difference there is between the best Duties done <HI>before</HI> Conversion, and the same done <HI>after,</HI> he distinguishes the latter by a peculiar <HI>Epithet,</HI> and in∣titles them <HI>Good Works.</HI> And the Force of the Argument here, to confirm his Point, lies chiefly in this, That <HI>good Works</HI> (truly such) are <HI>subsequent Fruits</HI> of Salvation already begun in the Soul: and therefore they cannot either in the Nature of Things, by their own Efficiency, be the productive Cause of it; nor yet in the Scheme of the Gospel, by Divine Appointment, be the <HI>Covenant-Condition</HI> of it; nor by virtue of any relative or intrinsick Excellency in them, be the <HI>moving</HI> Consideration with God to bestow it; because in either of these Views of them, an <HI>Antecedency</HI> is supposed, that is repug∣nant to the Scripture, which dates their Existence, not before, but <HI>after</HI> Conversion. <HI>For we are his Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good Works.</HI></P>
<P>Now can there be any Shadow of a reasonable Ground to doubt, whether the Apostle, where he rejects the Notion of Salvation's being <HI>of Works</HI> (so far as it respects its Beginning at least) intends such <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, as they are apt fondly to imagine are of the same <HI>moral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd</HI> and <HI>excellent Quality</HI> with those that Believers are said to be <HI>created in Christ Jesus unto,</HI> which the Apostle calls <HI>good Works,</HI> and which are so indeed, being in point of Principle and End and Manner, as well as Matter, truly (though imperfectly) confor∣mable to the Nature and Will of God, the Rule and Pattern of moral <HI>Goodness.</HI>—Surely it were unworthy the Character of an in∣spir'd Apostle, to make him so weak and inconsistent a Reasoner, as to argue, that Salvation is <HI>not of Works,</HI> because otherwise <HI>Boast∣ing</HI> were <HI>not excluded</HI>; and yet all the while to have his Eye here, not to such <HI>Works</HI> as Men flatter themselves with the Supposition of a <HI>Moral Goodness</HI> in, and which only can be imagin'd to carry in them
<PB N="47" REF="006010_0045_1027722C26F6DA80"/>
any Grounds of <HI>Boasting,</HI> but to others of a quite different Kind, that can be supposed to afford no possible Pretext for this <HI>Boasting</HI>; for the sake of <HI>excluding</HI> which, the Apostle declares <HI>Works</HI> exclu∣ded! — We must therefore, were it only in Reverence to the inspir'd Writer, conclude, that when he shuts out <HI>Works</HI> from hav∣ing a Hand in beginning the Salvation of a Sinner, he means to exclude <HI>all Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, whatever <HI>Goodness</HI> or moral Excellence they may conceive to be in them.</P>
<P>I would subjoin here; If I mistake not, there are these two or three Things will clearly follow from the Tenor and Scope of the Apostle's Argumentation.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That all <HI>Boasting</HI> on the Part of the Unregenerate, is so founded on that false Hypothesis of their Capacity to do (in their present State) Works <HI>morally good,</HI> holy or spiritual, in God's Ac∣count, as that the <HI>excluding</HI> of <HI>Works,</HI> under that Notion or Respect will effectually exclude them under every Notion or Respect, that implies any the least Ground for <HI>Boasting</HI>; or, which amounts to the same Thing, will effectually exclude all <HI>Boasting,</HI> in that Case.—And this will appear, if we consider (1.) That it is manifestly the Apostle's Design here, so to exclude <HI>Works,</HI> as by that Means to exclude all <HI>Boasting.</HI> Says he. <HI>Not of Works, lest any Man should Boast</HI>: q. d. Not of <HI>Works,</HI> consider'd under any Notion whatever that contains in it Grounds of <HI>Boasting.</HI>—And (2)That with this View, he sets himself to prove, that <HI>good Works,</HI> truly such, are <HI>consequential</HI> to Regeneration, and so an <HI>impossible</HI> Supposition <HI>before</HI> it. Thus his Reaso∣nings stand in Connection:—<HI>Not of Works, lest any Man should Boast. For we are God's Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good Works.</HI> This proves, that when he uses the exclusive Phrase, <HI>Not of Works,</HI> he must have his Eye to such <HI>Works</HI> only, as being supposed to have in them the true Excellency of <HI>good Works,</HI> do under that Notion contain Grounds of <HI>Boasting.</HI> And now to shew, that in the Gospel-Scheme of <HI>Salvation</HI> there's no Room left for any such <HI>Boasting</HI> he destroys the very <HI>Notion</HI> on which this is founded, by assuring us that Works truly <HI>good</HI> do <HI>follow</HI> Conversion, or the new <HI>Creation in Christ Jesus,</HI> and therefore can never have Place in an <HI>unregenerate</HI> State. This View of his Reasoning makes it close, and effectual to cut off <HI>Boasting</HI>: but to take it in any other View, not consistent with this, will (for ought I can see) leave it loose, incoherent, and utterly in∣conclusive to his Purpose; which it were most unworthy and ab∣surd to suppose in the Case of an Apostle, writing under divine Inspiration.—Besides, this Argument may be strengthen'd by consi∣dering (as before suggested) the <HI>Nature of Things.</HI> For, <HI>seeing mo∣ral

Goodness</HI> is the true Excellency of human Nature and human Ac∣tions, if <HI>that</HI> be deny'd ia the Case of an Unregenerate Man, what Grounds are les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such an one of <HI>glorying</HI> in himself, or <HI>boasting</HI> in any Efforts of his own towards Salvation? So that the Apostle here, methinks, appears as a Master-Workman indeed; at one Blow strik∣ing Death at the Root of all <HI>Boasting,</HI> in this Affair of <HI>obtaining the Salvation which is by Crist Jesus.</HI> For how is it possible, in the Na∣ture of Things, that <HI>Works</HI> destitute of all true moral Excellency, should by any <HI>Efficacy</HI> of theirs be productive of saving Conversion, or ingenerate moral Goodness id Men! Tins were absurdly to sup∣pose them, to <HI>give</HI> what they <HI>have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>; yea, to produce an Effect, not only transcending the Power of the Cause, but even contrary to the Bias of its Nature!—Or how is it possible they should be <HI>me∣ritoriously</HI> (any more than efficiently) the Cause of a Goodness and Excellency, infinitely superior to any Thing in themselves!—Or how can they rationally be supposed to have so much as the Force of a <HI>Condition</HI> in the Divine Promises, <HI>intitling</HI> the Doer of them to infinite Blessings at the Hand of God; when at the same time they have in them <HI>Nothing</HI> at all of the formal Nature of true <HI>Goodness</HI> or <HI>moral Excellency,</HI> to fit them for his Regards as a <HI>moral Governor</HI>!</P>
<P>But I proceed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other Observation, referring to the <HI>Apostle's Reasoning</HI> here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> That from this it must follow,</P>
<P N="2">(2) That to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ppose him excluding <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate under every other possible Notion, save this only of their being morally <HI>Good,</HI> would by no means reach his profess'd <HI>Design,</HI> which is to exclude <HI>Boasting.</HI> For so long as the moral <HI>Goodness</HI> of these Works is maintain'd, the main Spring of <HI>Boasting</HI> still remains. To suppose them excluded under every other Notion whatever, but not under this, would therefore not answer the <HI>End</HI> aim'd at in their Exclusion, which is to shut out all <HI>Boasting.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P>(3.) It will hence clearly follow, that every <HI>Scripture-Instance</HI> of excluding <HI>Works</HI> for the sake of excluding <HI>Boasting,</HI> must design to exclude them under this Notion, as vainly imagin'd to be <HI>morally Good</HI> before God: since (as we have seen before) 'tis impossible, that <HI>Boasting</HI> in that Case should otherwise be excluded.</P>
<P>But to go on to another <HI>Text</HI> of Scripture.—</P>
<P>The Truth I am defending, is clearly held forth, I think, in those other Words above-quoted from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 7. <HI>Who maketh thee to dif∣fer from another? And what hast thou, that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory</HI> (or boast) <HI>as though thou hadst not received it</HI>? The <HI>Design</HI> of the Apostle here appears to me
<PB N="49" REF="006010_0047_1027723102AACCE0"/>
very much the same, as in the former Text; namely, to cut off all Pretences for <HI>Boasting</HI> (whether of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Professors, or their Teachers) in their respective Attainments, under the Advantages of the Gospel, either in point of special Grace, or extraordinary Gifts. And the <HI>Median</HI> he makes Use of here, is for Substance the same too; namely, the shutting out <HI>Works,</HI> supposed to have moral Worthiness it them, from being die procuring Cause of their At∣tainments, and resolving them into the sovereign Pleasure of the <HI>Divine Donor;</HI> to whom they stood Debtors for all their Receipts.—Here are two Questions or Demands. The First is <HI>Who maketh thee to differ</HI>? To which the Answer, here plainly imply'd, is, That Di∣vine Benefactor, who is the sovereign Author of every good and perfect Gift. It's He, that puts the <HI>Distinction</HI> upon Men, when they excell others in valuable Attainments 'Tis the Result of his free Favour, 'Tis not any antecedent moral Excellency in any thus distinguish'd, that <HI>makes the Difference</HI>: Or in Scripture-Language, <HI>Not by Works of Righteousness, which they have done</HI>—The other Question is, <HI>What hast thou, that thou didst not recieve</HI> q. d. These your distinguishing Attainments under the Gospel in which you are. so apt to glory, are you not indebted for them to the <HI>Father of Lights</HI> and <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> who has freely given them to you! Whether as to sanctifying Grace, or extraordinary Gifts, are you not a meer <HI>Receiver!</HI> Had you Power in your self to acquire them; or Me∣rit, to purchase them! Or with regard to <HI>special Grace,</HI> had you even any <HI>antecedent</HI> moral or spiritual Excellency, to intitle you to it! Surely, you must confess, It is <HI>not of Works.</HI> For you could do None <HI>worthy of God,</HI> before you <HI>receiv'd</HI> his special Grace: And here you was a meer <HI>Receiver,</HI> in Opposition to any Right whatever, or active Acquirement, on your part. You are in every respect wholly a <HI>Docter</HI> to the absolute Grace of the Divine Given.—Thus, tak∣ing the Apostle's <HI>Question</HI> in this its natural and unsore'd Meaning, there appears in it a just. Foundation for his Conclusion, which fol∣lows, by way of Query again,—<HI>Now if thou didst receive it why then dost thou glory, as If thou didst not receive it!</HI> A very close Expostula∣tion, and carrying in it Matter of full Conviction to the Reason and Conscience of those he wrote to, that they had no possible Room left for <HI>boasting</HI> on the Account of any their distinguishing Attainments. It's good Argument why Men should not glory in any Gifts of <HI>Nature,</HI> or common <HI>Providence,</HI> because these are what they have <HI>re∣ceived.</HI> But surely these were not the only, nor the principal Things, that the Apostle most probably had in his Eye, or that the <HI>Corinthi∣an</HI> so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oasted in. And though <HI>extraordinary Gifts,</HI> of the superna∣tural
<PB N="50" REF="006010_0048_1027723560C56398"/>
and miraculous kind, are included here; yet certainly <HI>speci∣al Grace</HI> is by no Means to be thought excluded, as some pretend. For how would this comport with the <HI>Apostles</HI> Reasoning and with his main Design here? Would not a proud Elation of Mind in any under the View of a supposed moral Goodness in their Endeavours to get <HI>special Grace,</HI> be as really in the Apostle's Sense <HI>Glorying</HI> or <HI>Boasting,</HI> as an undue Lifting-up themselves under the View of their Endeavours to acquire those extraordinary <HI>Gifts</HI>? And is not the at∣taining of <HI>special Grace</HI> by the Creature's own Doings, rather higher Ground of <HI>Boasting,</HI> than what appears in the other Case; by how much 'tis of a more excellent Nature and superior Importance? If the one's being <HI>received</HI> is a Consideration sufficient to silence all <HI>Boasting,</HI> in that Particular, why should not the same Consideration be allowed equal Force in the Case of the other, which is as much <HI>re∣ceived</HI> also? Surelv, by Parity of Reason, at least, the Apostle's Re∣buke to the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Boaster is applicable to the Case of <HI>glorying</HI> in an imagin'd <HI>moral Goodness</HI> of unregenerate Men's Endeavours to attain <HI>converting Grace.</HI> For any, upon a suppos'd Attainment of this Grace, to ascribe it to an imaginary moral Excellency in his own Efforts, while unregenerate, seems evidently to be a <HI>glorying in it, as though be received it not</HI>; and so brings him under the Correction of the Apostle's <HI>Rod,</HI> as here exercised.</P>
<P>The Truth, as it appears to me, is (1.) That all <HI>Works</HI> morally good and approvable before God, are utterly <HI>impracticable</HI> by the fallen Creature, whilst unrenewed, and under the Dominion of Sin; as, Sir, you concede the Subject of our present Controversy to be.—And (2.) That for a poor Sinner, in this his guilty, impotent, and forlorn State, to be elated or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ffed up with a vain Imagination of its being in his Power (even under the highest: Refinements of Na∣ture, with the Help of meer common Grace) to perform Acts of pro∣per moral Virtue, or true Holiness, pleasing and acceptable to God; I say, for such a one to cherish this Principle, to profess it, and to pursue it in Practice, attempting Duties upon this Presumption, and governing his Hopes of Success in Conformity to it, This is nothing less than that <HI>Boasting</HI> and spiritual <HI>Vain-glory,</HI> which the Gospel-Scheme of Salvation every where <HI>excludes.</HI>—And then (3.)Because this <HI>Boasting</HI> is what arises from the <HI>Pride</HI> of the carnal Mind, toge∣ther with Ignorance of the Depth of that Ruin of a fallen State Man∣kind are born in; and hath no Foundation at all in the Nature of Things, in the Truth of Fact, or in the Scheme of the Gospel; greatly derogates from the Glory of redeeming Mercy, and from the Honour of the blessed Mediator; denies discriminating Grace to∣wards;
<PB N="51" REF="006010_0049_10277238539EF6E8"/>
the saved of the Lord, and lessens their sensible Obligations in point of Gratitude; whilst at the same Time it exalts the fallen Creature, quiets him in his own Sufficiency, tempts him to delay his Concern about Salvation, leads him to trust in himself when essaying Conversion to God, and stands a Bar in the way of his Coming to God by Jesus Christ, for Mercy absolutely free, and unpromised, as to any Duties and Doings of his: I say, Because this <HI>Boasting</HI> is such a moral Evil in it self, and is pregnant with so many other Evils, hence it is undoubtedly, that the Holy Ghost in Scripture so repeatedly and with so much Earnestness insists upon the <HI>Exclusion</HI> of it.—And (4) Because this Sin of <HI>Boasting</HI> is so inseparably connected with the Opinion of true moral Goodness in the <HI>Works</HI> of the Un∣regenerate, as that it is impossible to <HI>exclude</HI> or reject the former, with∣out also <HI>excluding</HI> and disallowing the latter (the Reason whereof is exceeding obvious, viz. because they that entertain that Opinion, do entertain a <HI>false</HI> Notion of their own Excellency; and they that build upon a <HI>false</HI> Notion of their own Excellency, must needs be <HI>puffed up</HI> and <HI>boast in themselves</HI>) therefore the one is excluded for the sake of excluding the other. <HI>Not of Works, lest any Man should boast.—What hast thou,</HI> in point of supposed true Goodness and vi∣tal Religion, <HI>that thou hast not received,</HI> at the hand of Divine sove∣reign <HI>Grace</HI>? <HI>Now if thou didst receive it thus, why dost thou boast, as though thou hadst not thus received it</HI>; Or, as if it were <HI>not of Grace,</HI> but <HI>of Works</HI>?</P>
<P>I shall now shut up the present Argument, with this summary Re∣collection of all the foregoing Reasonings under it. Since 'tis in∣disputably evident from the several Scriptures above recited, that all <HI>Works,</HI> proceeding Salvation actually begun in Conversion, are in the Gospel-Scheme <HI>excluded</HI> for the Sake of excluding all <HI>Boasting</HI>: — And since it thence follows with like Clearness, that they are excluded under every <HI>Notion</HI> of them, that contains Reasons or Grounds of <HI>Boasting</HI>:— And since it is abundantly evident, that consider'd under the Notion of their having true <HI>moral Goodness</HI> in them, they contain the Grounds and Reasons of <HI>Boasting</HI>:—And since it has been evidenced, that the Holy Ghost in Scripture doth actually and on Design <HI>exclude</HI> them under <HI>this</HI> Notion, that thereby all <HI>Boasting</HI> might be excluded :—And lastly, since it hath been made appear, that <HI>Glorying,</HI> or <HI>Boasting,</HI> in the Case before us, is so founded in or inseparably connected with <HI>that Idea</HI> of the Doings of the Unregenerate (their having some moral Excellency or true Holiness in them) as that it is impossible, such <HI>Glorying</HI> should other-wise be totally <HI>excluded,</HI> than by excluding all such <HI>Works,</HI> consi∣der'd
<PB N="52" REF="006010_0050_1027723B9142DA90"/>
under that Idea:—From these several Considerations said to∣gether, I shall take it at present for a Point fully prov'd, <HI>That all Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, supposed to have the said idea an∣nexed to them, are under that Notion certainly <HI>excluded,</HI> for the sake of excluding <HI>Boasting,</HI> from the Business of Sinners being bro't into a State of Salvation.—The other Point proposed was—</P>
<P N="2">[2.] That all <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, done by them whilst such, and respected by them as morally good, being thus <HI>excluded,</HI> it is a necessary Consequence, That they can't possibly be included in the <HI>Covenant-Promise,</HI> as reveal'd <HI>Conditions,</HI> upon the Performance of which, God has engag'd to confer <HI>special Grace</HI> upon Sinners.— This appears to me a genuine and clear Inference from what has been said. For, if all Performances and Endeavours of Men, previ∣ous to a renewed State, are, as respected under the Notion of their being morally Good before God, <HI>excluded</HI> the Business of their Do∣ing brought to Salvation (or, which is the same in Effect, deny'd to have any <HI>Existence,</HI> as consider'd under that formal Notion) in Order that thereby all <HI>Boasting</HI> in and of themselves might be shut∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; it must hence inevitably follow, that they can have no possible Place in the Gospel Covenant, as <HI>Conditions,</HI> to which God has made a Promise of <HI>special Grace.</HI>—If, as consider'd under that Notion of their being <HI>morally good</HI> or holy and spiritual, in God's Account, the Scripture denies them any actual Being, it must necessarily deny them also, as consider'd under the Notion of their being <HI>Conditions,</HI> in a <HI>Promise</HI> of special Grace made to the Doings of the <HI>Unregenerate.</HI> Otherwise, we make the Gospel solemnly to establish that for Con∣dition, which at the same time it has excluded as a meer <HI>Non-Entity</HI>; having no <HI>Existence,</HI> as morally consider'd, but in the vain Imagina∣tion of the haughty Sinner. What is this, but to make the Gospel as it were <HI>destroy it self</HI>? Here were "sad Havock" indeed!</P>
<P>That which remains now before me, is, to obviate some <HI>Objec∣tions,</HI> that may perhaps be brought against me, to invalidate my Rea∣sonings in Answer to you and my Way of arguing from such Texts of Scripture as I have alledg'd against you.—And here it may be suggested in Opposition to me,</P>
<P>OBJECT. 1. <HI>That I have all along <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>'d upon a false</HI> Hypothesis, <HI>founded on a Misconstruction of those</HI> Scriptures, <HI>which speak of Words as</HI> excluded <HI>for the Sake of excluding</HI> Boasting; <HI>since they are only Works of the</HI> Ceremonial <HI>Law not of the</HI> Moral.</P>
<P>To which I answer: The Scriptures, in the Places consider'd, speak of <HI>Works</HI> indefinitely, without any explicit Limitation to a particular
<PB N="53" REF="006010_0051_1027724025B2B220"/>
<HI>Law</HI>; and, as I think, without any suct. Restriction necessarily im∣ply'd. Be it the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> as contradistinguish'd to the Law of Faith, that is in general refer'd to, and in all its Views, whether as <HI>Moral, Ceremonial,</HI> or <HI>Judicial,</HI> still according to the reveal'd Scheme of Salvation it stands a firm and unalterable Truth, <HI>Not of Works lest any Men should Boast,</HI> Why then should the Sense be restrain'd, as in the Objection! But I observe further, That the true Scripture-Idea of <HI>Works</HI> in the Texts refer'd to, is of such Latitude as to ex∣tend to Works of appearing <HI>moral</HI> Goodness, done in an unregene∣rate State, is evident from the Name and Stile, by which the <HI>Works excluded</HI> are sometimes expresly characteriz'd: as in in that Text, <HI>Not by Works if Righteousness, which we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> &amp;c. And in those <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ces, As many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curse— But the Man that doeth them, shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in them.—For</HI> Moses <HI>describeth the Rightheousness which is of the Law, that the Man which doeth these Things, shall live by them.</HI>—Which are Descriptions most properly applicable to Works of the <HI>Moral</HI> Law, and seem more immediately to have them in View.—Yet further, I argue from the profess'd <HI>De∣sign</HI> of Works being <HI>excluded.</HI> How is it possible to exclude all <HI>Boasting,</HI> if only <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Works were excluded? Do such Works only leave Room for <HI>Boasting</HI>? Nay, since Works of the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law are but Matters of Indifference in themselves, how do these contain any Grounds at all of <HI>Boasting,</HI> save on the Account of a supposed <HI>moral Goodness</HI> in them; in virtue of their being reducible to the <HI>moral Law,</HI> as so many Instances of that general Duty here∣in requir'd. Subjection to God's revealed Will? Besides, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the World, <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as well as <HI>Jews,</HI> are equally concern'd in the Gospel-Scheme of Salvation, why should it not in this important Point of <HI>excluding Works</HI> for the sake of excluding <HI>Boasting,</HI> be interpreted so as to reach every one's Case; and comprehend, not only those at∣tached to the <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tical Law,</HI> but even the greatest <HI>Aliens from the Common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>h of Israel, and Strangers from the Covenants of Promise,</HI> knowing nothing further than the <HI>Law written on their Hearts,</HI> and being (as the Scripture speaks) <HI>a Law unto themselves</HI>? And it is to any Purpose, to observe such were the <HI>Ephesians</HI> (not <HI>Jews,</HI> but Sin∣ners of the <HI>Gentiles</HI>) such the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and such the <HI>Romans,</HI> to whom the Apostle is writing in the <HI>Epistles,</HI> whence I have alledged the principal <HI>Texts</HI> from which I have been reasoning against your Opinion, and which account for <HI>their</HI> (as well as the <HI>Jews</HI>) Salva∣tion as <HI>of Grace,</HI> and <HI>not of Works.</HI> A sure Sign (I think) that the seeming Virtues or moral Endeavours of the soberest <HI>Heathen,</HI> and by Consequence the best Works of <HI>Unregenerate</HI> Professor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="54" REF="006010_0052_10277243232E5130"/>
the Gospel; are in the Apostle's Sense <HI>excluded</HI> for the sake of ex∣cluding <HI>Boasting</HI>; and not <HI>Jewish</HI> Observances only, as is by some pre∣tended. However, if still this Objection sticks with any, I refer them to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> on <HI>Justification</HI> (Pag. 29, to 50.) where this Point is distinctly handled, and the Objection answer'd, I think, in the most satisfactory Manner.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, if you are pleas'd to except against the Fairness of my Management in this Debate,</P>
<P>OBJECT. 2. <HI>That I make frequent Use of the Term,</HI> WORKS <HI>which is of a</HI> doubtful <HI>sigification, without a</HI> determinate Idea, <HI>and without any due</HI> Distinction—</P>
<P>I answer. That in general by <HI>Works,</HI> in this Controversy, it seems to me agreed between us, are meant the apparent <HI>good Works</HI> of Persons not yet throughly converted t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, whom we usually call <HI>Unregenerate.</HI> And I use a Variety of Terms, such as <HI>Doings, En∣deavours, Seekings, Strivings,</HI> &amp;c. because I would speak comprehen∣sively, and include all possible <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregenerate, which you may be disposed to call <HI>good Works,</HI> and to which you are apt to conceive a <HI>Promise</HI> of special Grace made in Scripture.—Though I often speak of <HI>Works</HI> that appear to carry <HI>moral</HI> Excellency in them, I don't mean to confine the Idea to what is commonly call'd moral Honesty, Sobriety, social Virtue, or the like, exclusive of what is of the devotional Kind, and a more <HI>Evangelical</HI> Aspect: but I take into the Idea and really intend all those Attainments, Performances, and Qualifications, of whatever Sort, that enter into the Character of any Man <HI>seeming to be religious,</HI> but <HI>deceiving his own Heart.</HI> In short, Sir, I include in the Term, <HI>Works,</HI> every Idea (i.e. every Idea that can in Truth agree to the Case of one not yet thoroughly converted, but still under the Dominion of Sin) which you have been pleas'd to put into your <HI>Description</HI> (Pag. 25.) of the <HI>Man,</HI> whom you hold to be the Object of a <HI>Promise of Divine efficacious Aid, or special Grace.</HI>—This, I think, is plain enough from the Current of my Language every where through the whole of what I have said.</P>
<P>But to proceed—If you object to me again,</P>
<P>OBJECT. 3. <HI>That I seem sometimes to insinuate, as if the Opinion held by</HI> you <HI>in this Matter were too nearly connected with the Doctrine of</HI> Merit; <HI>though you have expresly renounced all Pretence of</HI> Merit <HI>in the present Case, and therefore (as you imagine) are far from teaching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> setting up that</HI> Boasting, <HI>which the Gospel designs to</HI> exclude—</P>
<P>To this I reply, in the following Observations,</P>
<P N="1">I. That this Objection labours of a grand <HI>Mistake</HI> (already suf∣ficiently expos'd) as if the Exclusion of <HI>Merit</HI> in Works were an
<PB N="55" REF="006010_0053_10277244A84F88C8"/>
intire Exclusion of <HI>Boasting.</HI> For, as we have seen, there are <HI>other Notions</HI> of these Works, that contain Grounds of <HI>Boasting</HI> (in the Apostle's Sense) besides that of their being <HI>meritorious</HI>: And it is the evident Design of the Gospel to exclude <HI>Works</HI> under <HI>every</HI> No∣tion of them, that (being admitted) would let in <HI>Boasting.</HI>—How∣ever, in Order to a more full answering the Objection, it seems ne∣cessary to observe,</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Word <HI>Merit</HI> is variously to be understood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner in a <HI>high</HI> and strict, or in a <HI>lower</HI> and more <HI>large</HI> Sense. You know very well, Sir, the usual Distinction between Merit of <HI>Condignity</HI> and Merit; of <HI>Congruity.</HI> And here according to the Sense in which: you would be understood, when you say you exclude <HI>Merit,</HI> so must the Answer be.</P>
<P>If we understand <HI>Merit</HI> in the <HI>absolute</HI> and most <HI>proper</HI> Sense them I say, it must be a great Mistake, to suppose that the excluding or denying of <HI>this</HI> only amounts to the full Sense of the Scripture, when it excludes <HI>Works,</HI> for the Sake of excluding <HI>Boasting.</HI>—But I per∣suade my self, Sir, there's no Need of arguing this Point with you. I think, you must intend the <HI>lower</HI> Kind of Merit, or Merit in the <HI>large</HI> Sense, when you <HI>exclude</HI> it from the Works of the Unregene∣rate. Now by this Kind of <HI>Merit,</HI> I conceive, must be intended at least some moral Excellency, true Worthiness, Goodness, or Virtue in their Works, before God. And is this, Sir, the <HI>Merit,</HI> which you renounce? Is the Exclusion of this Kind of <HI>Merit</HI> the just Import of your Expressions, where you tell us (P. 24.) <HI>In his</HI> (i.e. Christ's <HI>Right we must plead</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> for special Grace) <HI>who has purchased this Benefit for us; and not in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do, which we can only humbly consider as meer Qualifications,</HI> &amp;c. Do you (I say) really mean here to disclaim all Pretence of Merit, in the lowest and largest Sense of the Word, as above explain'd? If so, I answer then, there must be a palpable <HI>Inconsistency</HI> in your Scheme: Since you strenuously insist, throughout your Letter, that God in dispensing his <HI>special Grace</HI> acts not in the Character of an absolute Proprietor or sovereign Benefactor, at perfect Liberty to give or to withhold the Benefit as he pleaseth, but only <HI>in the Capa∣city of a moral Governor and righteous Judge of the Behaviour and Im∣provements of his Creatures,</HI> and dispensing it or not <HI>according to their Conduct in the Use of the Talent they've receiv'd.</HI> Now, if this be so,. I beg to be inform'd what that <HI>Behaviour of the Creature</HI> is, according to you, which is thus the Rule of God's Dispensation in this Matter. Can it be any other than a true <HI>moral</HI> Behaviour, in its formal Na∣ture, pleasing to God? Is it possible that the <HI>Creature's Behaviour</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="006010_0054_10277247BAFC4FB0"/>
should pass the Test with him as a <HI>moral Governor</HI> and <HI>righteous Judge</HI>; and yet ac the same Time not have any true <HI>moral Goodness</HI> in it! Which it cannot have, and so cannot have the lower Kind of Merit, Worthiness, or recommending Excellency, unless it be as well <HI>for∣mally</HI> as <HI>materially</HI> good. How evidently impossible the Case! And how absurd the Supposition! For a Thing to <HI>be,</HI> and <HI>not</HI> to be, at the same Time and in the same Respect, is scarce a greater Con∣tradicition.</P>
<P>Now since there is this notorious Incoherence in your Scheme, and both Parts of a Contradiction can't be true, one of the repugnant Principle your must certainly give up. And give up which you will, for ought I can see, your Scheme must fall with it. For if you part with your Principle, of <HI>God's acting</HI> in this Affair <HI>as a moral Governor and righteous Judge if his Creatures Behaviour and Improvements,</HI> making this the <HI>Rule</HI> according to which he dispenseth his <HI>special Grace</HI> to the fallen Creature; I say, if you give up this Point, it must then una∣voidably follow, that God herein acts only as an <HI>absolute Proprietor</HI> and <HI>sovereign Benefactor:</HI> which being all that Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> or I con∣tend for, there's an End of the Debate. Or, if you give up the other Principle (which you say you allow) of <HI>the fallen Creatures pleading.</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> for special Grace) MEERLY <HI>in the Virtue of what</HI> CHRIST <HI>hath done for us, or in Right of his Purchase, and not at all in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do;</HI> I say, if you relinquish this Point, then it fol∣lows, for ought I can see, that you must assert a sort of <HI>Merit</HI> or <HI>Worthiness,</HI> even in the <HI>Works</HI> of an unregenerate Man, who is in∣terested hereby in a Promise, which passes over to him. <HI>Right</HI> to special Grace, pleadable before God. But what a vain Imagination is this (as shewn before) and how contrary to the whole Tenor of the Scriptures!—In short, when you profess to <HI>allow,</HI> that we are <HI>not</HI> at all to <HI>plead in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do,</HI> your Mean∣ing must be, either to teach us, that although in Fact there is true <HI>Virtue</HI> or <HI>Merit</HI> in our Doings, some moral Goodness or Worthiness which speaks them proper <HI>Qualification</HI> for the Benefit of special Grace, and although the actual Subject of these Qualifications has a <HI>Right</HI> to this Grace passed over to him by God's <HI>Promise,</HI> yet ne∣vertheless that we must not <HI>plead</HI> this Right, when asking, for the promis'd Benefit; in which View of your Words, you renounce, not <HI>the Virtue or Merit of what we do,</HI> but only the making it a <HI>Plea.</HI>— A poor lean Concession! And not half enough, to clear you of setting up that <HI>Boasting,</HI> which the Gospel <HI>excludes.</HI>—Or, if you mean any<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing further it must be her to renounce, either the very <HI>Being</HI> of this; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Merit</HI> is the unregenerate Man's Doings or else [only the
<PB N="57" REF="006010_0055_1027724955C7B6D0"/>
<HI>Right</HI> passed over to him in the <HI>Promise</HI> and made sure to him by Means of such, his <HI>virtuous</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> Doings. Now, if we take your Words in the <HI>latter</HI> Sense, it will be palpably inconsistent with the whole Scope of your <HI>Letter</HI>: And if in the <HI>former</HI> Sense, his too will be inconsistent with the many Expressions, wherein you seem evidently to suppose a Degree of moral Excellency and formal Good∣ness, or acceptable, Obedience to God, in the Doings and Endea∣vours of the <HI>Man solicitous for Salvation, though not yet throughly con∣verted.</HI>—But, Sir, if we would be intirely consistent with the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which utterly <HI>excludes</HI> all <HI>Boasting,</HI> we must teach the Sinner, not meerly to forbear <HI>pleading</HI> in Virtue or Merit of any Thing he does, but likewise to renounce <HI>the Virtue or Merit</HI> it self, even all of the lower kind, and in the large Sense of the Words. Otherwise, as I've already argu'd, that <HI>Boasting,</HI> which the Gospel shuts out can never effectually be <HI>excluded:</HI> but there will always lie in the Sinner's way a very invincible Temptation, to <HI>trust in himself that he is righteous, or to look to be saved by Works of Righteousness, which he hath done, and not according to God's Mercy, by the Washing of Regeneration.</HI>—Ne∣vertheless what faith the Scripture? <HI>Not of Works, lest any Man should boast.</HI></P>
<P>The Inconsistency here urged against your Principles, I acknow∣ledge. Sir, is nothing peculiar to you: but is common to those in the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, They all profess wholly to disclaim the Plea of <HI>Merit,</HI> in the Case before us; and yet they assert, with you, God's dispensing his <HI>efficacious Aid</HI> or <HI>special Grace,</HI> not as an absolute so∣vereign Benefactor, but as a <HI>moral Governor and righteous Judge of the Behaviour and Improvements of his Creatures</HI>: A Principle, I think, ne∣cessarily implying the Supposition of some inherent <HI>true moral Excel∣lency</HI> in the Sinner's Doings; which is <HI>Merit,</HI> of the lower kind. And this <HI>Worthiness</HI> they hold (with you) to be the <HI>Qualification</HI> for re∣ceiving of <HI>special Grace</HI>: to which Grace they also with you assert a <HI>Right,</HI> by God's Promise, passed over to the Man so qualified. Tho' in some Sense they renounce the Doctrine of <HI>Me∣rit,</HI> yet they speak of the <HI>Grace</HI> of God even in the first special Instance, as <HI>stipulat∣ed</HI> Good and of the unrenew'd Man's <HI>Endeavours</HI> (whilst such) as the <HI>Covenant-Condition,</HI> &amp;c. Which, at least, seems to be setting up a Merit of Congruity. Thus, Sir, in common with you, those in the <HI>Ar∣minian</HI> Scheme advance Opinions mutually repugnant, and <HI>build again the Things which they had destroy'd.</HI></P>
<P>In brief, Sir, You and they may soften your Language as you please, and be it as it will in the point of Consistency with <HI>yourselves,</HI> yet so long as you are for a <HI>Method of Grace,</HI> according to the Scheme de∣fended
<PB N="58" REF="006010_0056_1027724F3B4128B0"/>
in your <HI>Letter,</HI> as it appears from what has been said, that you do in Reality, include and abett that <HI>Glorying</HI> or <HI>Boasting,</HI> which the Gospel of Reconciliation forever <HI>excludes,</HI> I must think you so far not consistent with the <HI>Scripture.</HI> The Scripture says, <HI>Not by Works of Righteousness which we have done, but according to his Mercy God saved us.</HI> And again, <HI>He hath saved us, and called us with an holy Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, not according to our Works, but according to his own Purpose and Grace.</HI> Whereas, your Scheme tells us, on the contrary, That although com∣mon Grace be <HI>absolutely</HI> given, yet <HI>special Grace,</HI> by which only we are effectually called and saved, is not given absolutely, in a sove∣reign Manner, but in a federal Way, in Correspondence with certain Divine <HI>Promises</HI> and <HI>Stipulations,</HI> by which God has passed over tons a <HI>Right, as least a conditional Right</HI> to the promised Blessing, and which he executes as a <HI>moral Governor and righteous Judge of his Creatures Behaviour and Improvements,</HI> adjusting his Dispensations of saving Grace by <HI>the Use they have made of the Talent commmitted to them,</HI> &amp;c. Of all which Talk I can make no other Construction, but this; <HI>Not according to his own Purpose and Grace, but according to our Works, He calls us, and saves us,</HI> i. e. initially: Which is the very Reverse of the Scripture-Account of the true Method of Grace.—But it may be, you will be for <HI>compounding</HI> the Matter; and say, that it is ac∣cording to both <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> together; and that when Salvati∣on is ascrib'd to <HI>Grace,</HI> or deny'd to <HI>Works,</HI> such Scripture-Expressi∣ons are not to be understood absolutely, as if it were <HI>of Grace</HI> in an <HI>exclusive</HI> Sense, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as if it were <HI>not of Works</HI> in a <HI>subordinate</HI> Sense: for it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <HI>both</HI> in different Respects, concurring and uniting in this Affair; and so far as it is of the <HI>latter</HI> 'tis only as this has the Place of a <HI>Condition</HI> in the Promise of special <HI>Grace.</HI>—But for Answer, I must own (Sir) for my part, I cou'd never tell how to reconcile this Notion to those express Words of the A∣postle: <HI>If by</HI> GRACE, <HI>then is it no more of</HI> WORKS: <HI>But if it be of</HI> WORKS, <HI>then is it no more</HI> GRACE. According to the Apostle here, it seems. <HI>Works</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> can't be so blended together, as you may apprehend, in this Affair of Sinners being brought into a State of Sal∣vation. Because, for Salvation to be <HI>by Grace,</HI> and to be <HI>of Works</HI>; or (which means the same) to be <HI>according to God's Purpose and Grace,</HI> and to be <HI>according to our Works,</HI> i.e. supposed <HI>Works of Righteousness</HI> antecedent to Regeneration; these are real <HI>Contraries,</HI> mutually ex∣pelling each other, so that if the one takes Place, the other of Con∣sequence is excluded. <HI>Otherwise</HI> GRACE <HI>is no more Grace</HI>: or, <HI>Otherwise</HI> WORK <HI>is no more Work.</HI> Here the Apostle teaches us thus much, at least; That to suppose Salvation to be <HI>of Works,</HI> is to destroy the
<PB N="59" REF="006010_0057_10277250C50D6178"/>
Nature or deny the Being of <HI>Grace</HI>: and on the contrary, to sup∣pose it to be <HI>by Grace,</HI> is to destroy the Nature or deny the Being of <HI>Works.</HI> How then can these unalterable <HI>Opposites</HI> possibly be made to agree in this Affair? The Attempt is vain, and will be found an eternal Impossibility, so long as the Gospel <HI>excludes Works</HI> in the Manner it does, with a View to secure the Honour of God's <HI>Grace,</HI> and intirely remove every Ground of Man's <HI>Boasting.</HI> For some Ground of <HI>Boasting</HI> will remain, so long as Salvation is imagin'd to be <HI>of Works,</HI> whether in Regard of any true moral <HI>Worthiness</HI> in them, or any <HI>conditional Right</HI> annexed to them, which God as a <HI>moral Governor</HI> is supposed to act in Consideration of, when he bestows his <HI>special Grace</HI> on the fallen Creature. If <HI>Works</HI> of an unregenerate Man, whilst such, be allow'd the Power of a suspending <HI>Condition,</HI> or That to which a <HI>Promise</HI> of converting Grace is made, in Virtue where∣of a <HI>Right</HI> to it is passed over to him,—this is such a Scheme as flatters the natural <HI>Pride</HI> of his Heart, leads to a Claim of <HI>Merit</HI> (at least of the lower kind) and opens a wide Door to <HI>Boasting</HI> and Vain-glory.</P>
<P>But, it it be further objected here,</P>
<P>OBJECT. 4. <HI>That, granting</HI> the Works <HI>of Unregenerate Men,</HI> (<HI>suppos'd</HI> morally good) <HI>to be by the Gospel, for the sake of excluding</HI> Boasting, <HI>all of them excluded from being</HI> (under that Notion) <HI>the Condition, to which a Promise of special Grace is made; and granting, that to make Works conditional in this Case</HI> as consider'd under that Notion, <HI>would be to establish that</HI> Boasting, <HI>which the Gospel excludes</HI>: yet <HI>it will by no Means follow upon these Concessions, that the</HI> Hypothesis <HI>of their being made</HI> conditional, <HI>is so essentially connected with and so intirely founded in that Notion of them, as that we cannot rationally suppose them consider'd, in the conditional Promise under some</HI> other <HI>Respect or View, fairly consistent with the perfect</HI> Exclusion <HI>of</HI> Boasting.</P>
<P>For Answer to this plausible Pretence, it may suffice to say in brief;—I know of none that deny God's acting in this Affair as a so∣vereign Proprietor and absolute Benefactor, who do not at the same Time assert his acting in it as a <HI>moral Governor and righteous Judge of the Behaviour of his Creatures.</HI> But how is it possible, He should act in this last Character, without <HI>respecting</HI> at all the <HI>moral Goodness</HI> of their Behaviour? Can he be suppos'd, while acting in this Capacity, and so necessarily having an Eye to his Rule of Govern∣ment, yet to have no Eye to the <HI>Goodness</HI> of that <HI>Behaviour,</HI> in point of its Conformity to his preceptive Will, although it be the esta∣blish'd <HI>Condition,</HI> on which he has suspended his Promise of special Grace? If the <HI>Behaviour</HI> have true <HI>moral Excellency</HI> in it, why should
<PB N="60" REF="006010_0058_1026E533512340B8"/>
not <HI>this</HI> he both respected in the conditional Promise, and ey'd by him in his Execution of it?—Nor am I able to conceive what <HI>other possible Notion</HI> of Men's Behaviour, any can suppose <HI>respected</HI> in mak∣ing this <HI>Conditional</HI> of the promised Blessing, but what, if receiv'd and acted upon, will certainly, be <HI>inconsistent</HI> (as well as that of <HI>moral Goodness</HI>) with the intire and absolute <HI>Exclusion of Boasting</HI> in a Gospel-Account.—To reduce the Controversy here ta an Issue, I wou'd a little further argue the Point, after I have observ'd, That in what∣ever <HI>other</HI> View or Notion <HI>Works</HI> may possibly be consider'd in this Affair, yet if the Notion of their <HI>moral Goodness</HI> be at all taken in, it seems to me impossible perfectly to exclude <HI>Boasting.</HI> I say then, Either this Notion of <HI>moral Goodness,</HI> in the <HI>Works</HI> of Unregenerate Men is quite <HI>excluded</HI> from this Affair of their being made <HI>Conditi∣onal</HI> of the Bestowment of special Grace; Or it is <HI>not</HI> quite exclu∣ded.—Now, if you assume, and say. That this Notion of them is <HI>intirely excluded,</HI> i.e. if you give up the Point of their <HI>moral Goodness,</HI> and allow that there is nothing of <HI>true Rectitude</HI> or <HI>godly Sincerity</HI> in the best <HI>Endeavours</HI> of the Man (according to your Description) in <HI>a middle</HI> State, neither <HI>relentless</HI> nor yet <HI>thoroughly converted</HI>: To this I reply, that upon such a View of the Case it don't appear to me in the least rational, to suppose <HI>Endeavours</HI> of this Kind made <HI>condi∣tional</HI> in a Divine Promise, upon any <HI>other</HI> Notion of them whatever. If God in dispensing special Grace to such a Man, does at all respect his <HI>Endeavours,</HI> as the Consideration upon which he acts, He must (I think) respect them either as <HI>morally good, or not.</HI>—But now to suppose Him acting herein upon the Consideration of Works <HI>not morally good,</HI> is to suppose a Thing that has no Congruity with the Idea of a <HI>moral Governor and righteous Judge.</HI> If you don't maintain the Being of some true moral Rectitude and <HI>godly Sincerity</HI> in these Doings of the striving Sinner, while you plead for their <HI>Conditionality,</HI> methinks you had better divest them of this too, in Honour to God's rectoral Holiness, rather than suppose Him annexing a great and precious Promise to a morally unfit <HI>Condition,</HI> or dispensing a promised Blessing without respecting any <HI>Goodness</HI> in his Creature's Behaviour, tho' made the Rule of his Administration. I cannot but think it infinitely more honorary to God, to suppose with <HI>us,</HI> that in this Affair of dispensing special Grace to the Unregenerate, He acts as a <HI>sovereign Benefactor,</HI> out of absolute, and (meaning in Opposition to your con∣ditional Promise) out of <HI>unpromised,</HI> and irrespective Mercy, <HI>accord∣ing to the meer good Pleasure of his Will.</HI> I think, you must be oblig'd to come to this Conclusion, if you renounce all Pretence of <HI>moral Goodness</HI> in the Condition you plead for; since, without your sup∣posing
<PB N="61" REF="006010_0059_10277252B23C4290"/>
some true <HI>moral Excellency</HI> in the Creatures <HI>Behaviour,</HI> I dont see how you can possibly reconcile its being a Divinely establish'd <HI>Condition</HI> in this Affair with the Idea of God as a <HI>moral Governor</HI> and <HI>righteous Judge.</HI>—But after all, it may be you will on the other hand assume, and say, That you allow of some true <HI>moral Goodness</HI> in these Doings of the seeking striving Sinner, though not yet intirely devoted to God in Christ, and allow their being (at least partly) under <HI>that Notion</HI> made <HI>conditional</HI> in the Case before us. Now if so you assume, then I answer, That <HI>whatever other</HI> Notion you may imagine respected in making the Sinners Endeavours <HI>conditional</HI> of the Bestowment of special Grace, and however consistent you may suppose <HI>that</HI> to be with the <HI>Exclusion</HI> of <HI>Boasting</HI>; Yet if this Notion of <HI>moral Good∣ness</HI> be at all admitted in the Case, some Ground of <HI>Boasting</HI> cer∣tainly remains, which (as we have seen) the Gospel-Scheme Sal∣vation intirely <HI>excludes</HI> and with a View to the Exclusion of this does <HI>exclude</HI> all <HI>Works</HI> that contain any Grounds of <HI>Boasting,</HI> as do these pretended <HI>good Works,</HI> done before converting <HI>Grace,</HI> and made <HI>conditional</HI> of it.— In short, the Gospel (as often observed) <HI>excludes</HI> such <HI>Works,</HI> for the sake of excluding <HI>Boasting.</HI> It <HI>excludes</HI> Works, denies their very Being or Existence, under the Notion of <HI>good Works,</HI> and consequently denies their <HI>Conditionality</HI>: which is, to all Intents and Purposes, sufficiently to exclude <HI>Boasting.</HI>— Whereas now your Scheme, which sets up <HI>Works</HI> of the Unregene∣rate for a <HI>Condition</HI> in the Covenant of Grace, does on the contrary suppose the actual <HI>Existence</HI> of <HI>good Works</HI> before Conversion, and claims a peculiar Honour for them in the Affair of Man's Salva∣tion: which certainly leaves Room for that <HI>Boasting,</HI> the Gospel designs to <HI>exclude.</HI>—If after all I have offer'd from Scripture you still dispute there being any Ground of <HI>Boasting,</HI> in this Case, I will offer this plain Argument from Reason, for your Conviction.—For the fallen Creature, not yet <HI>renewed in the Spirit of his Mind,</HI> but <HI>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin</HI> (as is the Case of the <HI>striving Sinner</HI> according to your own Description) for <HI>this Man</HI> (I say) to entertain an Opinion of <HI>moral Rectitude</HI> and <HI>true Goodness</HI> in any of his Doings of Improvements, is to entertain a <HI>false</HI> Opinion of <HI>his own Excellence</HI>: and so far as he does this, he is undoubtedly <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>high-minded,</HI> in the Account of the Gospel. And now for <HI>this Man,</HI> this poor empty vain Man, thus puffed up with a false Conceit of his own Doings, to stamp them with the dignifying Cha∣racter of <HI>Conditions</HI> in God's Covenant of Grace passing over to him a <HI>Right</HI> to promised Blessings, This is what, I think, includes in its essential Idea that very <HI>Boasting,</HI> which the Gospel excludes;
<PB N="62" REF="006010_0060_102772595DF422F8"/>
or at least, you must allow, this leaves large Room for it, and lay in the Sinner's Way a powerful Temptation to this Soul-ruining moral Evil.—Upon these Grounds, I leave it (Sir) with you to consider seriously whether you are not, so far as you have been setting up and pleading for this <HI>Opinion</HI> and this <HI>Character</HI> of the Un∣regenerate Man's Doings, justly chargeable with setting up and pleading for that same <HI>Boasting,</HI> which the Gospel-Scheme of Salva∣tion has most absolutely <HI>excluded,</HI> or deny'd any Place to in this Affair: as we have seen from a Variety of <HI>Scriptures.</HI> And the Construction I have made of the sacred Text, I doubt not might easily be confirm'd from the <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Homilies</HI> of your own Church, from the concurrent Sense of the <HI>English Reformers,</HI> from the publick Confessions of the <HI>foreign</HI> Protestant Churches, &amp;c. which would all come in as a <HI>Cloud of Witnesses</HI> on my Side of the Question. But I wave human Authorities, in the present Debate.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, while you rise so high in your uncandid Reflections upon Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI> and others with him, as even to tax them of <HI>cor∣rupting the Simplicity of the Gospel,</HI> you see for what Reasons I think the Imputation, (black as it is) rebounds on your own Head. For it must needs be a warping from the true Scheme of Salvation, and so far a <HI>corrupting</HI> the Gospel, to set up that guilty <HI>Boasting,</HI> which is here condemned and <HI>excluded.</HI>—But this Matter must on the whole be submitted to others impartial Judgment. However, In the mean Time, I cannot refrain making here a short Remark on the obvious <HI>Tendency</HI> of your Opinion in the present Point, and of what you have offered in Defence of it, to check the Concern and to stifle the Convictions of <HI>awakened</HI> Sinners which you must confess of <HI>dangerous</HI> Consequence, I readily confess the Scheme you have advanced is what <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> will not be likely to take much Offence at, but it would rather afford a pleasing Entertain∣ment to the fallen Creature, and be likely to bear down and keep under his rising Fears from time to time, to sooth and hush his ac∣cusing Conscience, and while in Heart really pursuing the World as his chief Good, yet to flatter him with the Hopes of his finally obtaining Heaven too; as having the <HI>Grace of God</HI> well secured to him by a <HI>conditional Promise,</HI> and brought hereby as it were within the Command of his own <HI>Endeavours</HI> and <HI>Improvements.</HI>— Allow me, Sir, to observe, 'Tis no Wonder at all therefore, if in a Time when Religion runs <HI>low</HI> among a People (as it ever will upon an awful Suspension of a special Divine Influence) Multitudes of the World go over to a <HI>Self-pleasing</HI> Opinion, and ridicule the Notion of any Danger by it. However, this we are well assured of, that
<PB N="63" REF="006010_0061_1027725C60335CC8"/>
according as the <HI>Work of God</HI> has been <HI>revived,</HI> time after time, so that the <HI>Truth</HI> at the same Time revived and prevailed; and it is remarkable, through all the Vicissitudes that have passed over the Church, this important <HI>Truth</HI> which I am now pleading for, has been preserved alive, at lead in the incontestible Grounds of it, in all the publick <HI>Confessions</HI> of the <HI>Reformed,</HI> from Age to Age; nor has the contrary <HI>Error</HI> ever to this Day, that I can learn, obtained a Place in so much as one <HI>publick</HI> Confession of Faith, avow'd in any Protestant Church. And this is our Consolation, amidst all Dangers threatning the Truth in a Day of Degeneracy, that still the <HI>Spirit of Truth</HI> has the same Power and the same Grace as ever, and will not let the <HI>Word of Truth</HI> in any Iota of it utterly fail and perish, but will secure it in the Mouth and Heart of all that are <HI>Christ</HI>'s, as tot the great Matters of it especially.</P>
<P>And here, Sir, I might well enough conclude; relying on what has already been said, as sufficient to the Purpose of confirming Mr. <HI>Cooke</HI>'s two Arguments, which I undertook to defend. But I must beg your Patience a little longer, whilst I add an Argument or two, that are of a more <HI>general</HI> Extent, and of no small Weight with <HI>me</HI> in this Controversy, and whilst I give you a few further Considera∣tions on some Passages of your <HI>Letter,</HI> which hitherto I've not found a Place for.</P>
<P>One <HI>Argument,</HI> in particular, that I would a while insist on, is this. <HI>If any</HI> Endeavours <HI>of the</HI> Unregenerate, <HI>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, as they are, be the</HI> Condition, <HI>to which</HI> special Grace <HI>is promis∣ed, these must be supposed so, either as Doings</HI> acceptable and pleasing <HI>to God, or else as</HI> displeasing <HI>and</HI> offensive <HI>to him.</HI> (For I know of no <HI>Medium.</HI>) But, <HI>under</HI> neither <HI>of these Views of them, can these En∣deavours be the Condition, to which special Grace is promised.</HI>—</P>
<P N="1">1. Not under the Notion of their being <HI>acceptable</HI> and <HI>pleasing</HI> to God; because there is no Foundation in <HI>Truth</HI> for such a Notion of them.—For the Scripture most expresly assures us, Rom. 8.8. <HI>They that are in the Flesh cannot please God.</HI> By them that are in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> I understand, not meerly the <HI>obstinate relentless Sinner,</HI> but also <HI>the Man</HI> you describe, <HI>who</HI> though <HI>seriously concerned to become</HI> renew∣ed in the Spirit of his Mind, <HI>yet is not throughly converted from Sin to God,</HI> such an one, <HI>not having the Spirit of Christ,</HI> still <HI>in the Flesh</HI> or under the Government of a <HI>fleshly Mind.</HI> Whatever <HI>fair Shew in the Flesh</HI> he make, yet under all his <HI>seemingly Religiousness</HI> is in Truth <HI>carnally minded</HI>: The <HI>Flesh</HI> is his predominant Principle. And indeed, Sir, as you yourself have conceded, <HI>the Man</HI> you describe
<PB N="64" REF="006010_0062_1027725F51474378"/>
is <HI>under the Dominion of Sin.</HI> Now such a one, says the Scripture, <HI>cannot please God.</HI>—Agreeably we are told, Heb. 11. 6. <HI>Without faith, it is impossible to please God.</HI> None, I think, can doubt of its being <HI>Faith unfeigned,</HI> such as is a <HI>believing with the Heart unto Righ∣teousness,</HI> that is here intended: Nor can it be doubted whether all that are <HI>under the Dominion of Sin,</HI> are utterly destitute of this <HI>Faith</HI>; without which 'tis <HI>impossible to please God.</HI>—I might also produce here those Sayings and Reasonings of our Saviour, in Mat. 7. 17, 18. and in <HI>Chap.</HI> 12. 33, 34, 35. and in <HI>Luk.</HI> 16. 12. So <HI>Jam.</HI> 3. 12. with many other Texts might be cited, that clearly hold forth the Truth I am upon.—And I am persuaded, that the <HI>Sense</HI> I take these Scriptures in, agreeable to my Purpose, has the approving Suffrage of all <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> in their publick Confes∣sions of Faith; not excepting even the <HI>Formulas</HI> of your own Church, as before observ'd. And here I could readily turn you to many Passages, full to my Design, in your <HI>Articles,</HI> and <HI>Homilies,</HI> if not your <HI>Liturgy</HI> too. But for Brevity I omit it at present.—And now, Sir, if the Reverend <HI>Compilers</HI> of your own publick Standards, with other eminent <HI>Reformers,</HI> agreed to that Construction of the sacred Text, which our <HI>Author,</HI> whom you oppose, has espoused, I pray, consider WHOM your <HI>Reflections</HI> upon him and those on his Side of the Question, are equally applicable to. Do you indeed, Sir, think that these excellent Divines all built on <HI>empty Cobwebs,</HI>—tortur'd the plainest Texts,—&amp;c; &amp;c. to favour a <HI>preconceiv'd humane</HI> Scheme, <HI>not founded</HI> on the holy Scriptures, wherein it was <HI>peculiar,</HI> i.e <HI>so far</HI> as it agreed not with the Scheme of those on <HI>your</HI> Side in this Controversy!—</P>
<P>But I return from this Digression, and go on with the Argu∣ment.—How is it possible, Sir, that the Unregenerate Man's <HI>Doings</HI> should be <HI>pleasing</HI> to God, so long as his <HI>Person,</HI> as under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, is both odious to the Divine Holi∣ness, after obnoxious to revenging Justice? Or how is it possible, since he is not vitally and savingly <HI>united to Christ,</HI> and so not actually interested in the Merits of the <HI>Mediator,</HI> by whom only we have <HI>Access to the Father,</HI> that any of the Sinner's Doings should te pleasing to God? For, are we not <HI>accepted in the Beloved</HI>? And are not the very Saint's <HI>spiritual Sacrifices</HI> only <HI>acceptable to God by Jesus Christ</HI>? How then can you imagine the <HI>Unregenerate</HI> Man's Doings acceptable, while he does not <HI>come to God by the Mediator,</HI> nor has him an <HI>Advocate</HI> for him with the Father? And if you con∣sider the infinite <HI>Contrariety</HI> there is between the <HI>Purity</HI> of the Di∣vine Nature, and the <HI>polluted Doings</HI> of the most refin'd Creature

<HI>under Sin's Dominion,</HI> how can you conceive it possible, that any the best Endeavours of such a Creature should be pleasing to God? How can he be supposed, in any fair Consistence with his unspotted Holi∣ness, to act in Character of a <HI>moral Governor and Righteous Judge of the Behaviour of his Creature,</HI> even while answering Sinners <HI>Cries for</HI> Mercy, since their very best Devotions, as void of all true <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>godly Sincerity,</HI> must needs appear, at the Bottom, but <HI>selfish, carnal</HI> and <HI>impure</HI> in his Sight?—Whatever Aids of the <HI>Holy Sprit</HI> such may experience, yet while under the <HI>Dominion of Sin</HI> it is impossible in the Nature of Things, that such with all the Help of Divine <HI>com∣mon Grace</HI> should be able to please God in the Manner of their per∣forming any Duty.—Nor can it be pleaded, that however sinful and unworthy the Performances of such are <HI>in themselves,</HI> yet God may accept them <HI>for Christ's sake.</HI> No; for, notwithstanding the Redeem∣er's Merits and Purchase, there is a wife Scheme or Method provided for the <HI>Application</HI> of Redeeming Grace: and according to the Scripture-Account of this, there's such a <HI>Connection</HI> establish'd here between the <HI>Sanctification of the Spirit</HI> and the <HI>Sprinkling if the Blood of Jesus,</HI> as that the Latter never takes Place on any Soul without the Former. So that only <HI>Saints in Christ Jesus</HI> indeed have true Communion with God and Acceptance in his Sight. Nor can any <HI>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin,</HI> (which you grant to be the Case of all the <HI>Unregenerate</HI>) hope to make their Way into the Favour of God by any possible Services of theirs (whilst in that Situation) notwithstanding they may professedly implore Acceptance <HI>for Christ's Sake.</HI> Without a divine <HI>Application</HI> of Redemption in Effectual Calling, the Sinner's meer pleading its Purchase will avail nothing towards gaining the Divine Acceptance and Favour. In vain there∣fore is the meer Purchase suppos'd to be the Ground of a <HI>Promise</HI> to Men's Endeavours antecedent to this equally necessary <HI>Application.</HI> I have the rather (<HI>Sir</HI>) insisted on these Things here, because many in your Scheme appear to me exceedingly confus'd in their Tho'ts upon them, without any consistent Scheme of Principles, and indeed without) any distinct Idea's at all upon these Particulars: and be∣cause of the Importance of the Things in themselves, as well as their Reference to the Point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Debate.</P>
<P>I shall only add here, that the <HI>striving</HI> Sinner, whose <HI>Right</HI> (at least <HI>conditional Right</HI>) to special Grace, passed over to him by God's Promise, you contend for, <HI>this Man</HI> (I say) is either <HI>under the Law,</HI> or <HI>under Grace</HI>; I mean, as to his secret State before God, he is now actually either in the Covenant of the <HI>first Adam,</HI> or in the Covenant of the <HI>second Adam.</HI> He can't be in <HI>Both</HI> at the same

Time: or be <HI>of Works,</HI> and <HI>of Faith</HI> too, Now, if the former be his Case, the Scripture tells us, he is <HI>under the Curse.</HI> (Gal. 3. 10.) And how the Man that is <HI>under the Curse of the Law,</HI> or (as you grant) <HI>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin,</HI> should at the same Time have a <HI>Right</HI> to Salvation, or (which is the same Thing) to God's <HI>special Grace,</HI> by Virtue of a Promise in the <HI>Gospel Covenant,</HI> must to my weak Understanding remain a <HI>Paradox,</HI> till you can favour me with some satisfactory Solution of the Diffi∣culty. And till you have done this, I hope you'l no more upbraid those on our Side with "<HI>corrupting the Plainness and Simplicity of the Gospel</HI> and in Effect making it a meer <HI>unintelligible Riddle</HI>"— How is it possible, Sir, that Sinners actually in a <HI>State,</HI> and under a <HI>Do∣minion,</HI> condemn'd both by <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel,</HI> should be capable of pleasing God with their <HI>dead Formalities</HI>; or be <HI>made accepted in the Beloved,</HI> while they are far from <HI>presenting their Bodies a living Sacri∣fice, holy and acceptable to God, which is our reasonable Service</HI>!</P>
<P>From all those Considerations, I think it incontestible, that there's be Probability, no Possibility of the Unregenerate Man's Endeavours in Religion (whilst his State and his governing Principle are such) Being in any sound Scriptural Sense <HI>pleasing to God.</HI>—And then, to be sure, these his Endeavours cannot consistently be pretended to be the <HI>Condition</HI> of promised <HI>special Grace,</HI> which the Blessed God in Quality of a <HI>moral Governor and righteous Judge of his Creature's Behaviour and Improvements,</HI> stands engaged by his Covenant to bestow in Reward of the Sinner's Endeavours.</P>
<P>But so much for the first Thing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor am I able to conceive how it's possible, that any Doings which are <HI>displeasing</HI> and <HI>offensive</HI> to God, (as for the Principles, the Ends, and Manner of them, are the best Doings of every Unrege∣nerate Man) should, especially under that Notion be the stated <HI>Condition</HI> of his obtaining special Grace, or give him a <HI>Right</HI> to it in Virtue of any <HI>Promise</HI> of God.</P>
<P>Surely this must to every unprejudic'd Thinker appear a deep Absurdity, or in your own Language, <HI>perfect Nonsense.</HI> Doubtless it will be granted me, there is a Divine <HI>Harmony</HI> and moral <HI>Fitness</HI> in the whole Constitution of the Gospel-Covenant, and a perfect Congruity or Suitableness to the <HI>moral Perfections</HI> of God running through his whole Administration of it. But what Shadow of Agreement between the <HI>Behaviour and Improvements</HI> of a fallen Crea∣ture actually <HI>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin,</HI> contrary to the Di∣vine Nature, therefore odious in the Sight of God,—And God's making these a <HI>Condiition</HI> in the Gospel-Covenant, upon which he
<PB N="67" REF="006010_0065_1027726AE4CBCCC0"/>
has suspended his <HI>Promise</HI> of special Grace, and which accordingly as a moral Governor and righteous Judge, he makes the <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Measure</HI> of his Dispensations in the present Case ? Are there not some of the most <HI>Inconsistent</HI> Ideas put together here!—Can the polluted Doings of a Creature, devoid of the Image of God and under the Power of Sin, have any <HI>Virtue</HI> in them to recommend him to God's Favour, and to make him a meet Object of his <HI>spe∣cial Grace,</HI> or in your own Phrase, to <HI>qualify him for God's Help</HI>? And if not, then I pray, what is there in these Doings, to render it at all congruous, or suitable that they should be made the <HI>Con∣dition</HI> in a Divine <HI>Promise,</HI> and so in Virtue of <HI>this</HI> serve to give the fallen Creature a <HI>Right</HI> to special and saving Grace! Can you pos∣sibly conceive, how it should bear any <HI>Agreement</HI> with the rectoral <HI>Holiness</HI> of God, in transacting with his Creatures, to make That a <HI>Condition</HI> of his special Grace, which (though materially <HI>good,</HI> yet otterwise) in its whole moral Complexion, is infinitely <HI>disagreeable,</HI> and therefore <HI>displeasing,</HI> to the Divine Purity? What can be a more glaring Contradiction than this!</P>
<P>Nor will it in the least remove the Difficulty here, to say, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at by a special Act of meer sovereign Grace, purchased by Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ese</HI> Doings, <HI>tho' in themselves truly vile and unworthy, may</HI> for Christ's sake <HI>be appointed the</HI> Condition <HI>of special Grace, consistently enough with the Honour of the Divine Holiness.</HI>—For we are in this Case to form our Judgment of God's <HI>Acts,</HI> not upon meer Conjectures of our own Reason or Fancy, but by the infallible Revelations we find in the Oracles of God himself. Now, if we judge by this Divine Rule, it can never be made appear, that God has <HI>published</HI> any such <HI>Act of Grace,</HI> as is here supposed: This indeed is the very Fact in Question. And if no such Act of Grace be published in the Gospel of Christ, we may be sure that Christ never <HI>purchased</HI> such an one. The whole Tenor of the <HI>Gospel-Covenant,</HI> the Blessings whereof come to us in Virtue of the Redeemer's Purchase, discovers its perfect Har∣mony with God's <HI>moral Perfections</HI>: and shews, that all the pur∣chased Blessings are dispensed in an invariable <HI>Method of Grace,</HI> so contrived by infinite Wisdom, <HI>That God might be Just, and the Justi∣fier of him which believeth in Jesus.</HI> How can it then with a due Reverence to God's <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> as represented to us in the Gospel, be imagined, that a <HI>Conditional Right</HI> to his special Grace should pass <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the fallen Creature, by Virtue of a <HI>Promise</HI> (tho' supposed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sounded on the <HI>Merits of Christ</HI>) made immediately to such <HI>Doings,</HI> as really have no <HI>true Holiness</HI> in them, and are wholly destitute of that <HI>Faith unfeigned, through</HI> which we are <HI>saved</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="006010_0066_1027726F58903540"/>
<HI>by Grace,</HI> according to the Scripture Doctrine of the Evangelical Covenant. 'Tis by Faith we <HI>receive the Atonement</HI>: and only by thus <HI>receiving the Atonement,</HI> can we get a <HI>Right</HI> to the sure Mercies of the everlasting Covenant, or become (as you speak) <Q>qualify'd for God's Help,</Q> in a further <HI>Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will it (as some in your Scheme argue against us) do any Ho∣nour to the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God, to suppose such a <HI>Promise</HI> as you con∣tend for: because his Name is <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>True,</HI> as well as <HI>Merciful</HI> and <HI>Gracious.</HI> And in his Covenant of <HI>Mercy,</HI> and in all the Exer∣cises of <HI>Covenant-Mercy,</HI> He still preserves his <HI>Truth</HI> inviolable and his <HI>Holiness</HI> perfectly unblemished. To deny a Divine Promise to any <HI>Condition,</HI> that is contrary to his <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> and to deny his being <HI>pleased</HI> with any Doings of a Creature <HI>under the Dominion of Sin,</HI> and which have no Degree of true moral Purity in them, is so far from lessening the Honour of Divine <HI>Mercy,</HI> that it is a Vindication of it. God's <HI>Mercy</HI> is ever a <HI>true</HI> and just and <HI>pure</HI> Mercy. His Promises of <HI>Mercy,</HI> and all his Actings upon them, never fail of being intirely consistent with and honorary to all the moral Attributes of his Nature.—And here, Sir, I would join with you (in your <HI>Pag.</HI> 20.) in "Wishing it to be more seriously consider'd, that it was the <HI>Wicked Servant</HI> (<HI>Matth.</HI> 25. 24. com∣par'd with <HI>Luk.</HI> 19. 22.) who represented his <HI>Lord</HI> as an <HI>hard Man, reaping where he had never sown,</HI>" &amp;c. For I desire it may be impar∣tially examined, <HI>On which Side</HI> of the Question before us there is most danger of that <HI>wicked Servant's</HI> unjust Charge against <HI>his Lord</HI> taking Place. Whether on the Side <HI>we</HI> espouse, whose Opinion in this Particular so evidently pays united Honour; to the Divine <HI>Ho∣liness</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> and appears so clearly justifiable from the Word of God, as well as the Nature and Reason of Things?—Or on the Side <HI>you</HI> espouse, whose Opinion is such as represents the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God in a Light so apparently inconsistent with his <HI>Holiness,</HI> and represents that Doctrine which only makes these Divine Attributes appear in their true <HI>Harmony,</HI> as if it eclipsed the Glory of God's <HI>Mercy,</HI> and exhibited Him in the fasfe and odious Character of an <HI>hard</HI> Master, i.e, like <HI>Pharaoh</HI> &amp;c?— For do not those on your Side, and you your self, Sir, by this <HI>Accusation</HI> you have brought against us, virtually and in true Construction openly declare it your Sentiment, that in Case the Doctrine we embrace and you impugn be <HI>true,</HI> then the Glorious God must be looked upon indeed a <HI>hard Master</HI>?—Whereas <HI>we</HI> in our very Hearts abhor and detest this pretended <HI>Consequence</HI> from our Doctrine: and we attribute it, in those that frame such an Inference, to the Want of a <HI>consistent</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="006010_0067_1027727249D8C080"/>
way of thinking in Religion, and more especially to the Want of a full and just Sense of the <HI>Sinfulness</HI> and <HI>Misery</HI> of that Estate, into which the Fall brought Mankind.</P>
<P>But, it may be, after all I have said to enforce the Argument in hand, some may attempt to weaken it by <HI>denying</HI> the <HI>Disjunc∣tion</HI>; and pretending, <HI>That the Endeavours if the</HI> seeking striving <HI>Sinner, to which they suppose</HI> special Grace <HI>promised, are such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are neither</HI> pleasing <HI>nor</HI> displeasing <HI>to God, nor consequently are under</HI> either <HI>of these Notions made</HI> conditional <HI>of its Bestowment.</HI>—</P>
<P>Now the Weakness of such a Pretence will easily appear, if we consider, that it is in the Nature of Things impossible, the Doings of a <HI>moral Agent,</HI> in a <HI>moral Case,</HI> and considered <HI>as such</HI> by <HI>a mo∣ral Governor</HI> and <HI>righteous Judge,</HI> should be neither <HI>good</HI> nor <HI>evil,</HI> and so neither <HI>pleasing</HI> nor <HI>displeasing</HI> to Him.—The Lord <HI>weigheth Actions,</HI> and <HI>loveth Righteousness,</HI> but <HI>hateth Iniquity.</HI> And considering fallen Man as still a Subject of moral Government under a Law to God, and obliged by natural Bonds as a Creature to glorify Him in Body and Spirit, which are His; how is it possible, that any of his voluntary Actions should be totally indifferent, so as not to carry in them <HI>moral Godness,</HI> nor yet <HI>moral Evil.</HI> Such an ab∣solute <HI>Neutrality</HI> is what this Case will never admit of. And now according as they are truly <HI>Works of Righteousness,</HI> or not, so does God as a moral Governor and Judge either <HI>approve,</HI> or else <HI>disap∣prove</HI> them.—The <HI>Disjunction</HI> then in the Case before us must forever stand: and the Pretence of any Doings, prescribbed as <HI>Conditions</HI> to a <HI>moral</HI> Agent, being neither good nor evil, neither pleasing nor displeasing to a moral Governor, must be discarded as a vain and idle Pretence.—Admitting it were a possible Case, that the Doings of a <HI>moral Agent,</HI> acting as such, might be perfectly indifferent <HI>in themselves,</HI> yet if we suppose them by a <HI>moral Governor</HI> made the <HI>Conditions</HI> of a promised Benefit, they must in this View <HI>lose</HI> their Indifferency; and being looked on as <HI>good,</HI> will consequently be <HI>amiable</HI> and <HI>pleasing</HI> in his Sight.—However, if the Doings of the Unregenerate Man be indeed, (according to the Objection) nei∣ther <HI>pleasing</HI> nor yet <HI>displeasing</HI> to God, then surely they must stand for meer <HI>Cyphers,</HI> moral <HI>Nullities,</HI> in God's Account: and it must discover too little Reverence of the only wise God, to suppose Him, as a <HI>moral Governor,</HI> in a Covenant-Transaction with his fallen Creature making a very <HI>Thing of Nought</HI> the <HI>Condition</HI> of his pro∣mised Grace, and the <HI>Rule</HI> of his Administration as a <HI>righteous Judge</HI> of the Behaviour of <HI>moral</HI> Agents.—Can such Doings, as morally are <HI>Nothing,</HI> be suppos'd a <HI>fit Consideration</HI> for the Majesty of Heaven
<PB N="70" REF="006010_0068_10277273CE5B27D8"/>
to act upon, in dispensing his saving Mercies! Such Doings as are upon this Hypothesis indeed but <HI>empty Cobwebs,</HI> can you suppose it consistent with Wisdom, that these should be (what those in your Scheme make the Unregenerate Man's Doings) <HI>the Consideration</HI> which God respects in dispensing his <HI>Grace,</HI> the immediate <HI>Basis</HI> of the Application of Redemption, the <HI>Ground</HI> of Effectual Calling and so of actual Salvation! Has such a pretended Condition any <HI>Meetness</HI> to be, as it is made, the grand Hinge, on which a saving Interest in the Redeemer turns, and on which the Promise of spe∣cial Grace is suspended!—Yet I must needs say, as absurd as the Supposition is, which we are upon, is seems less dishonourable to God, than either of those in the <HI>Disjunction,</HI> which it is brought to confute. For, to suppose the Unregenerate Man's Doings, though not morally good, yet <HI>pleasing</HI> to God, and in this View made the Condition of his Promise in the Case before us; or to suppose them, although displeasing to God, as being morally not good, yet however made <HI>conditional</HI> of the Bestowment of his <HI>spe∣cial Grace</HI>; either of these appears rather <HI>worse,</HI> I think, than to suppose a perfect <HI>Neutrality</HI> here, and that they are under <HI>neither</HI> of these Views made the <HI>Condition,</HI> in a free Promise and sovereign Act of Grace. Nevertheless, all these Suppositions are really absurd, and reflect on the moral Perfections of God, that none of them are to be admitted. And whatever View these <HI>Works</HI> ante∣cedent to Conversion are considered in, they can no ways with any Suitableness to the Nature of Things, or to the revealed Scheme of Salvation, have this <HI>Conditional</HI> Form put upon them: and I believe, an Appeal might safely be made here to the Judg∣ment of the Generality, at least of the most experienced Christi∣ans and Divines.</P>
<P>Here, Sir, I must seriously profess my self intirely at a Loss how to reconcile the Scheme you are upon, either with the <HI>Humility</HI> of saving <HI>Faith,</HI> or indeed with the foregoing <HI>Humiliation,</HI> proper to the Case of an <HI>awakened seeking Sinner,</HI> that is to say, if the Principles of your Letter are thoroughly received, consciously acted upon, and fully pursued in all their practical Consequences. I must ask Leave, Sir, to observe to you, that it can be but of very little Avail for our Conviction, when you tell us in solemn Manner (<HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ser. Pag.</HI> 29.) "<HI>That you aim not at undermining any of the Soul-humbling Doctrines of the Gospel. No,—God forbid. I firmly believe it</HI> (say you) <HI>to be the great Design of the Gospel, to</HI> humble <HI>the Souls of Men</HI>" &amp;c.—But, Sir, what signifies this Profession, so long as you espouse and promote Opinions, that run quite counter to it?
<PB N="71" REF="006010_0069_1027727556310F90"/>
Indeed, Sir, I cannot see how to reconcile your <HI>Postscript</HI> with the Body of your <HI>Letter,</HI> in this Point. You say, You don't <HI>aim at</HI> un∣dermining the <HI>humbling</HI> Doctrines of the Gospel: and yet it is the main Design and Drift of your whole Letter to <HI>undermine</HI> that Doc∣trine touching God's <HI>Sovereignty</HI> in Conversion, which only is cal∣culated for the End of effectually <HI>humbling</HI> the lost Sinner; and you set your self to support that Doctrine of a <HI>Promise</HI> of spe∣cial Grace, to the Unregenerate, on <HI>Condition</HI> of their own Endea∣vours, which so strongly tends to slatter the <HI>Pride</HI> of the fallen Creature, and to countenance that <HI>Boasting</HI> which the Gospel for ever <HI>excludes.</HI> You seem loath to speak out plainly the whole Truth concerning the Guilt, Pollution and Wretchedness of the Sinner's natural State; you appear loath, that fallen Man should be represented in such improve∣rish'd and distress'd Circumstances, as to be oblig'd to come (<HI>Form Pauperis</HI>) in the humble Posture ard Spirit of a <HI>Beggar,</HI> to sue for divine Alms, <HI>without Money and without Price</HI>; but you would bolster him up with the Notion of a <HI>Right,</HI> at least a <HI>conditional Right,</HI> passed over to him by a divine <HI>Premise,</HI> made to his Cries and Endeavours, and securing to him Success; and not leaving the sovereign God at absolute <HI>Liberty,</HI> either to give or to with-hold as he pleaseth. Nay, upon a Supposition that God hath reserv'd such a <HI>Liberty</HI> to himself, and not bound himself by express <HI>Promise,</HI> to dispense his Grace to the Rebel-Creature, upon Condition of his own <HI>Endeavours,</HI> you insinuate as if in that case God would act like a <HI>hard Master,</HI> &amp;c. even notwithstanding all the condescending Invitations and gracious Encouragements which the Gospel abounds with, to the returning Sinner.—Now, surely if this be the Spirit of your Letter, I must needs say, it looks so very much like aim∣ing to undermine <HI>the Soul humbling Doctrines of the Gospel,</HI> that I should have verily thought you had really <HI>aim'd</HI> at this, if you had not professed otherwise. And if others judge your solemn Declara∣tion of sufficient Force to remove that Imputation, I must leave it: Only I will here remind you of Bp. <HI>Hopkins</HI>'s Censure upon your Scheme, <HI>viz.</HI> That to <HI>suppose Grace given according to Works is the Sum and Upshot of</HI> Pelagianism.</P>
<P>And indeed, Sir, whether you saw the full Force and Meaning of your own Language, or not, tell me what <HI>less</HI> than the compleat Ex∣tent of <HI>Pelagianism</HI> in the Point of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> can in any fair Con∣struction be made of those Passages in your <HI>Letter</HI> (Pag. 6, 7, 8) where you say, <Q><HI>Indeed I cannot think it consistent with the Divine Attributes—to give</HI> Being <HI>to any of his Intelligent Creatures</HI></Q> [here you don't so much as except the Race of fallen <HI>Adam</HI>] <Q>without
<PB N="72" REF="006010_0070_1027727876F415B0"/>
<HI>putting them into a</HI> Condition, <HI>that (every thing being considered in the</HI> whole <HI>of their</HI> Nature <HI>and Duration (would render Being</HI> desirable <HI>to them,</HI> &amp;c.—<HI>But every Thing beyond what is just sufficient to ren∣der Being desirable even to a</HI> perfect <HI>Creature, however so obedient, I take to be Matter of meer sovereign Goodness.</HI></Q>—Which Paragraph you shut up with this Observation with reference to <HI>Man,</HI> that "<HI>be shall not be accountable for what he never receiv'd,</HI>" &amp;c. where, I suppose from the Current of your Discourse, you mean <HI>never receivd</HI> personally. Now, Sir, if this be your Opinion, that Mankind are <HI>accountable only for what they</HI> (themselves, personally) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> then it seems, what human Nature once <HI>receiv'd</HI> an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again in <HI>A∣dam,</HI> our first Father and common Head, is totally excluded the <HI>Ac∣count</HI>; and we are no longer to believe with the Apostle, That <HI>the Judgment was by One</HI> (<HI>the Offence of one Man</HI>) <HI>to Condemnation,</HI> or that in Adam <HI>all die.</HI>—If it be your Opinion, with respect to the Offspring of <HI>Adam,</HI> That <HI>God's Perfections</HI> (<HI>as you express it</HI>) <HI>oblige him, in giving them Being, to put them into a Condition, that is in the whole better than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be, or that</HI> (<HI>every thing consider'd in the whole of their Nature,</HI> &amp;c.) <HI>would render Being desirable to them, and by no Means to put them into a worse Condition, but in Case of their own</HI> [i.e. personal] <HI>wilful Disobedi∣ence;</HI> And if it be your Opinion at the same Time, That it is as much is God is oblig'd from his Perfections, to do for <HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>in∣nocent</HI> Creatures, to put them into this <HI>Condition,</HI> which implies No∣thing more than what is <HI>just sufficient</HI> to render Being desirable to them; <HI>every</HI> Thing beyond this, being the Result of <HI>sovereign Good∣ness,</HI> i.e. unoblig'd free Favour: I say, Sir, if these be your real Sentiments, then I think, it must be your Opinion, upon the whole, That God's Perfections <HI>oblige</HI> him to treat innocent <HI>Adam</HI> and his <HI>Posterity</HI> ALIKE, with Respect to the <HI>Condition,</HI> which, in giving them <HI>Being,</HI> his Attributes did and still do <HI>oblige</HI> him to put them into. Nor, according to those your Principles, is he oblig'd, when giving <HI>Being</HI> to my <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>perfect</HI> Creature whatever, to put him into a <HI>Condition</HI> at all more <HI>desirable,</HI> than that which (according to you) he is oblig'd by his Perfections to put <HI>fallen Man</HI> into, when bringing him into Being. For all that exceeds what is <HI>just sufficient</HI> to render Being <HI>desirable,</HI> is more than his Perfections oblige him to, even in that Case, and must spring from meer <HI>arbitrary</HI> Kindness. And sure∣ly you claim as much on the behalf, of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Descendants. Is this, Sir, the Scheme you are upon! If so, then I think, it follows, 'tis your Opinion, That <HI>Adam</HI>'s Offspring are born <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>innocent</HI> Crea∣tures. For a State of <HI>Sin</HI> and spiritual <HI>Death</HI> is, I think, a <HI>worse</HI> Condition, than that of <HI>not-being</HI>: unless a Remedy and Deliverance
<PB N="73" REF="006010_0071_1027727F289B1C70"/>
suppos'd provided in that Case. But did God's Perfections oblige him to make this <HI>Provision</HI> in our Case? Might he not, consistently with the Honour of his Goodness, have glorify'd his <HI>Justice,</HI> without a Remedy in the Case of <HI>fallen</HI> Men, even as in that of <HI>fallen Angels</HI>? Was it not therefore an Act of <HI>sovereign Godness</HI> in Him to provide a Saviour, to raise up a second <HI>Adam</HI> when we were ruin'd in the First? Yet without doing this for us, will you say, that God was <HI>oblig'd,</HI> in giving us Being, to put us in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>Condition</HI> exempt from the Guilt and Pollution of <HI>Original</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Or will you chose now to subscribe to the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> and further (to be consistent with the Principles you have advanced) say, that to be born in a State, of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Misery,</HI> is to have Being given us in a Condition <HI>latter,</HI> than <HI>not to be</HI> at all, even though a Redeemer had act been provided, but especially since God has in Fact rais'd up a Horn of Salvation for us? In short, Sir, be but consistent, and you must either deny toe Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> which will be indeed to <HI>undermine a Soul-humbling Doctrine of the Gospel</HI>: or else, confessing Doctrine, you must d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y and renounce the main Principles defended in your <HI>Letter,</HI> and learn to look on poor fallen Man as having in his native Condition no other Refuge but <HI>sovereign Goodness, free Grace</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> in <HI>Christ,</HI> not in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st secured by any <HI>conditional Promise</HI> made to the Sinner's own impotent and polluted Doings in his unregenerate State.</P>
<P>Sir, to return to the main Point immediately m Debate between us, I would propose to you two Inquiries. (1.) Does not the <HI>Right</HI> to special Grace, which you plead for, as by a Divine <HI>Pro∣mise</HI> passed over to the <HI>striving Sinner,</HI> does not this (I say) neces∣sarily imply an actual <HI>Agreement</HI> or <HI>Reconciliation</HI> between an offend∣ed God and his Rebel-Creature? Does it not evidently suppose, that the Lord is actually become <HI>this Man's</HI> reconciled <HI>Covenant-God,</HI> and oblig'd by his Justice and Veracity to bless him with all spiritual Blessings?—For it would be absurd, to assert a <HI>Right</HI> on the Sinner's part, with an <HI>Obligation</HI> on God's part, both by Virtue of a <HI>Promise</HI> of Grace, and yet at the same time to suppose no Agreement or Peace at all between the Parties?—And then (2.) I ask, whether it be possible, that there should be this <HI>Reconcili∣ation</HI> or <HI>Agreement</HI> between these extream <HI>Opposites</HI> in Nature (i. e. whilst remaining such) a God of infinite <HI>Holiness,</HI> and a Creature <HI>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin</HI>? Please, Sir, to turn to those Divine Declarations to the Purpose, in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6 14, 15. and I <HI>Job.</HI> 1. 6. Compar'd with <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 3. When you have maturely consider'd these two Inquiries please to give me the Result of
<PB N="74" REF="006010_0072_102772821D419020"/>
your Thoughts, and it may contribute to an easy Issue of this Debate.</P>
<P>I beg Leave, Sir, before I finish, to offer some Hints on a <HI>Text,</HI> you have press'd into your Service, which has hitherto escaped my Notice. In the <HI>Advertisement</HI> before your Letter you allude to this Passage, in <HI>Philip.</HI> 2. 12, 13. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling: for it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Pleasure.</HI> It were in effect charging yon with Impertinence, not to suppose that you under∣stood these Words as importing a <HI>Promise</HI> of <HI>special Grace,</HI> made to the Endeavours of Unregenerate Men under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin. Yet indeed there is not the least Colour for such a Construction of the Words, neither from the Text not Con∣text. There is a total Silence here, as to the Case of an <HI>Unrege∣nerate</HI> Man.—So there is with regard to the Sinner's <HI>working</HI> be∣ing, <HI>conditional</HI> of God's <HI>working.</HI> Nay, the Contrary appears, in as much as <HI>God's</HI> working is here considered as <HI>prior</HI> to Man's working, and (as such) urged as a <HI>Motive</HI> to it.—Neither is there any Mention made here of <HI>converting Grace,</HI> nor must we neces∣sarily conceive <HI>first Grace</HI> to be intended here by the <HI>Salvation</HI> spoken of: but it may as properly mean <HI>progressive</HI> Salvation here, and <HI>compleat</HI> Salvation hereafter: in which Views the Word is often used, and is so in this Epistle. (Chap. 1. 19, 28.)—Nor is the <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> here mentioned, such as is common to the Unregenerate, but may as well, and doubtless doth, intend a <HI>filial</HI> Reverence and <HI>godly</HI> Fear, peculiar to true Christians. — And the Exhortation here is expresly directed to those whom the Apostle calls <HI>his Beloved,</HI> and of whom he says they had <HI>always obeyed.</HI> A sure Sign, he did not here address such as he supposed to be <HI>Un∣regenerate.</HI>—And the Argument he uses to enforce it, is, <HI>For it is God that worketh in you,</HI> &amp;c. Which runs not directly in the Form of <HI>a Promise,</HI> but seems only a Declaration of Fact: <HI>q. d.</HI> It is the Design of God's <HI>working in you,</HI> as he has done, and the proper Improve∣ment you should make of <HI>Grace received,</HI> is, to put you upon Endeavours after progressive Sanctification, and taking Pains for the <HI>Furtherance of your Salvation.</HI>—Yet the Words may implicitly couch in them a <HI>Promise,</HI> but it is to <HI>Saints in Christ Jesus.</HI>—Nor would I be un∣derstood here to deny, that this Text may several Ways be adapted and apply'd for Excitation and Encouragement to the <HI>seeking stri∣ving Sinner,</HI> and especially for the promoting his <HI>Humiliation,</HI> by a Conviction of his own spiritual Impotence, and the Sovereignty
<PB N="75" REF="006010_0073_102772851020B920"/>
of God in the Operations of efficacious Grace, &amp;c However, Sir, this is no Help to your Argument.</P>
<P>I shall now take a brief Notice of what you have advanced in your <HI>Letter</HI> (Pag. 3.) where you tell us, <Q><HI>Nothing can so effect∣tually tend to cut the Sinews of all</HI> Endeavours <HI>to repent,—as even the most distant</HI> Surmise, <HI>that possibly all our Labour may be in</HI> vain.</Q>—This, Sir, is to my best Understanding one of the most palpable Mistakes. And if applied to any important Business in humane Life, will be found contrary to plain Fact, in our daily Experience and Observation. Doth not the Husbandman <HI>plow in Hope,</HI> without the least Certainty of Success? Doth not the Mariner sail in dangerous Sea∣sons of the Year, and in Times of War? Doth not the Merchant ad∣venture his Substance across the Sea to foreign Countries, even when <HI>Sailing is dangerous</HI>? And do these Men act without any the most distant <HI>Surmise</HI> of the Possibility of Disappointments in their Affairs? Or in Case of Sickness, won't Men send for the <HI>Physi∣cian</HI> and <HI>use many Medicines,</HI> notwithstanding apparent Hazard of never recovering? How unjustifiabie then must be the Conduct of Sinners, if in a Case of infinitely greater Importance, and of eternal Consequence, they suffer any <HI>distant Surmise of all their La∣bours being in vain,</HI> to <HI>cut the Sinews of their Endeavours</HI>! Ought they not in this most momentous Case, if they would <HI>shew them∣selves Men</HI> and consistent Agents, to act upon like Encouragement, as in Matters of inferior Concernment? It being a Case, in which any the least <HI>Probability,</HI> yea, a bare <HI>Possibility</HI> of Success is infinite∣ly more valuable, than in any other Case imaginable; and a Case, where <HI>Necessity</HI> calls aloud for their most ardent Desires, their most incessant <HI>Strivings to enter in at the strait Gate,</HI> their utmost Pains in <HI>pressing into the Kingdom of God.</HI>— Was the <HI>Man-slayer</HI> under the Law sure of Success, and yet was he not wont to free with all his Might to the City of Refuge? And should not the awak∣ened Sinner, though wuhout a Promise of certain Success, yet upon the Encouragement of a <HI>Probability,</HI> or even a meer <HI>Possi∣bility, flee for Refuge to lay Hold on the Hope set before Him</HI>?—Did not the <HI>Ninevites</HI> act meerly upon the Encouragement of a <HI>Who can tell if God will return</HI>!—And the <HI>Israelites,</HI> were they not Stimulated by an uncertain Hope, saying, <HI>Who knoweth if God will repent, and leave a Blessing behind him</HI>!—Once more, when an inspired Apostle had an hypocritical Professor of the Gospel in Dealing, I mean <HI>Simon,</HI> whom he perceived to be in the Gall of Bitterness and Bond of Iniquity, with what Encour∣agement doth he enforce his Exhortation to him to <HI>repent,</HI> and <HI>pray to God</HI>? Doth he tell him of a <HI>Promise,</HI> and urge his Endeavours
<PB N="76" REF="006010_0074_10277288F6E78EA8"/>
as <HI>conditions,</HI> in the Manner that you do? No, Sir, but he puts all to the Risque; he mentions but a <HI>Per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="8 letters" DISP="〈8 letters〉"/>e.—Pray God, if perhaps He may forgive thee.</HI>— This <HI>Perhaps,</HI> as here used, imports indeed only a Suspicion of the Truth of the Man's Repentance, and not any Doubt of God's Forgiveness in Case his Repentance were sincere.—Note, Sir, We have here a plain Scripture Exam∣ple of a Professor still <HI>Unregenerate,</HI> and under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin; and of the Encouragement, which the Gospel gives to such an one, when awakened, to cry to God for Mercy. The Apostle only mentions a <HI>Perhaps</HI>; and never lisp to him the most distant Surmise of a <HI>Promise</HI> to secure certain Success. Now in this, will you say of in Inspired Apostle, that he took the ready Method <HI>to cut the Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of</HI> Simon's <HI>Endeavours to repent</HI>!—I hope surely, in this Case you will say No — What then is the <HI>Divinity</HI> you teach, in this Particular! Is it not too near akin to that <HI>vain Philosophy,</HI> you so loudly exclaim against? Or, is not the Language of your Objection in this Case, too agreeable to that of the <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ful Man,</HI> who in Excuse of his Aversion to taking any Pains without Certainty of Success, says on every Occasion, <HI>There is e Lion in the Way!</HI></P>
<P>But, Sir, however those on your Side of the Question may un∣dervalue any Gospel-Encouragement, short of a <HI>Promise</HI> ascertain∣ing the Success of a Sinner's Endeavours; Yet we on the other hand are constrained, in the View of the glorious Encourage∣ments of the Gospel (though from meer Sovereign Mercy, un∣promised to any Endeavours of the Unregenerate) to admire the Wisdom of God in the Constitution of the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> so adapted to the Design of exalting his own <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> and securing the Honours of his <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> together, and so adapted to promote at the same Time both the <HI>Humiliation</HI> and the <HI>Encouragement</HI> of the fallen Creature: Equally calculated to awaken the Sinner's Fear of God's Wrath, and to support a Hope in his Mercy, so, to guard him against the Dangers of Security, Presumption, and Delay, on the one hand, and on the other against all Temptations to Despair and Dejection.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have finished what I proposed on this Occasion.—I am conscious of much Infirmity, and ask your Candour. I think, I can say uprightly, I have not committed any wilful Mistakes: but have wrote in the Fear of God, the very Sense of my Heart, according to my best Light.</P>
<P>On the whole, I would just make the one Remark, and be it remember'd: Though I deny any <HI>Pormise,</HI> by virtue of which
<PB N="77" REF="006010_0075_1027728D772848F8"/>
the <HI>special Grace</HI> of God can possibly become <HI>due</HI> to the Prayers and Endeavours of the Unregenerate, whilst such; Yet however, in I am perswaded, that it is the Duty of Sinners to be seeking and striving after it; and that not a single Instance will be found of any Sinner in the Day of Judgment able to stand forth, and plead in Truth, <HI>Lord, I did my best Endeavour to the very last, that I might obtain the Salvation which is by Jesus Christ, and looked diligently lest I should fall of the Grace of God but after all was deny'd</HI>— To be perswa∣ded of this <HI>Fact</HI> on the Score of the Riches of God's Mercy, and yet at the same Time to renounce all Pretence of a <HI>Promise</HI> to the Sinner's Endeavours, appear to me Things very well consistent. Though, guided by the Word, I limit the <HI>Promises</HI> of God to the Believer: Yet far be it from me, to entertain a Thought of limiting Him in his <HI>unpromised Mercy</HI> towards Sinners, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h knows no other Bounds, in this, or any other Case, consistent with his moral Perfections, but the meer <HI>good Pleasure of his Will.</HI></P>
<P>May the Spirit of Truth leads us into all Truth; and may the Spirit of Grace make all Grace to abound towards us and in as!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Tis the sincere Wish of, Rev. Sir, Your Humble Servant, J.M.</SIGNED>
