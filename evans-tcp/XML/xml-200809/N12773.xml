<HEAD>OCTOBER <HI>1</HI>st.</HEAD>
<P>THE President, Members, and Judge Advocate being duly sworn, the Court proceed to the trial of Major General Schuyler, who appears, and the following charge (contained in a report of a Committee of Congress, appointed to examine the evidence collected, and state charges, against the General Officers, who were in the Northern Department when Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were evacuated) is exhibited against him.</P>
<P><HI>Neglect of Duty,</HI> in not being present at Ticonderoga to discharge the functions of his command, from the middle of June, 1777, until it was no longer possible to maintain Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, consistent with the safety of the troops and stores, when he should have caused a retreat to be made for the preservation of both,—under the 5th article of the 18th section of the Rules and Articles of War.</P>
<P>Major General Schuyler, being desired to plead, says, I admit that I was absent from Ticonderoga from the 24th of June to the conclusion of the siege, but I beg leave to insist, and doubt not shall be able to prove, that I was guilty of no neglect of duty in not being there.</P>
<P>The Judge Advocate observes, That Major General Schuyler having been appointed to command the Northern Department (including Albany, Ticonderoga, Fort Stanwix, and their dependencies) he was, by Congress, on the 22d of May, 1777, released from all restraint respecting the establishment of his Head-Quarters.</P>
<P>That, by letters to him from General St. Clair, Commanding Officer at Ticonderoga, dated the 13th, 18th, 24th, 25th, 26th, 28th and 30th of June, and 1st of July, 1777, he was informed of the designs, strength and advance of the enemy against Ticonderoga, and of the great danger in which that post and Mount Independence would be, in case of an attack.</P>
<P>That it appears, in consequence of the letters of the 13th and 18th of June, he went to Ticonderoga; for on the 20th he there held a Council of War. That, although in this Council of War it was determined that the effective rank and file were greatly inadequate to the defence of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, but that nevertheless both posts ought to be maintained as long as possible, consistent with the safety of the troops and stores, and that the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence were very deficient, and that the repairs and additions to them ought to claim immediate attention, yet General Schuyler made no stay at Ticonderoga, to expedite the works on Mount Independence, and to cause a retreat to be made, when it became no longer possible to maintain the posts, consistent with the safety of the troops and stores; for his absence appears from General St. Clair's letter to him on the 24th of June, and those that followed.</P>
<P>That, Ticonderoga and Mount Independence being the posts of greatest defence to the United States against the advance of the British forces from Canada, and the main army of the Northern Department being stationed at those posts, it was General Schuyler's duty to have been at the head of that army, and to have remained there, when he knew the enemy were actually advanced against it. That his forces were greatly inadequate to the defence of the posts, and that they were to be abandoned in the moment when it should become no longer possible to maintain them, consistent with the safety of the troops and stores, a moment, of which it was necessary the first-officer in the department should judge.</P>
<P>That, in the absence of General Schuyler, this critical and important moment passed unobserved or un∣improved; for on the 6th day of July the posts were abandoned, with the loss of the sick, ammunition, cannon, provision and cloathing of the army, and the loss of many lives in the retreat.</P>
<P>The Judge Advocate produces a copy of a resolution of Congress, dated March 6, 1776; a copy of a resolution of Congress, dated May <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, 1777; copies of letters from Major General St Clair to Major Gene∣ral

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HERE follows the substance of the information given by two men from Canada, taken prisoners by one of our parties on Onion River.</P>
<P>That General Burgoyne is arrived in Canada, but has brought no troops with him; that the British army is assembling as fast as possible at St. John's; that the light infantry, which they call the flying army, commanded by General Frazer, is already advanced to Point-au-Fer; that the whole army is said to consist of about ten thousand men, a part of which, with Indians under the command of Sir John Johnson, and Canadians under Captain Mackay, are to penetrate the country by the Mohawk River, whilst the rest of the army under General Burgoyne crosses the Lake to attack this place; that their fleet (a particular account of which is in the inclosed letter to General Sullivan) is all on the Lake, and we may depend on their being here in a fortnight at farthest.</P>
<P>From the nature and circumstance of the pass granted to one of the two, which I here inclose, and his own account of the manner in which he was sent from Montreal, viz. to search plans of the country which he pretended to know were hid at Metcalf's, and his being possessed of a considerable sum of continental money, and some gold and silver, I have the strongest suspicion of his being a spy, and have secured him as such, and sent him down to you, both that you might have an opportunity to examine him yourself, and that, if you should think of him as I do, he might be tried at Albany, where, should he be found guilty, the sentence will probably be more adequate to the crime than here; for I find the officer who lately suffered a spy he had in charge to escape, through the grossest misconduct, has been honourably acquitted by a Court Martial.</P>
<P>You will likewise find a letter from Col. Bailey, containing the intelligence brought by two Frenchmen sent down by General Gates. Though their intelligence differs very materially, they agree in the circumstance of General Burgoyne's arrival; and if these fellows have really been sent by him to see what we were about, there was no method more likely to procure them an easy reception than that of giving an account of the preparations in Canada, and carrying, or pretending to carry, letters from our friends. The letter to General Sullivan may notwithstanding be genuine, and Amsbury says it was written by one Michael Shannon. This name was found upon him on a separate piece of paper, in a fair hand, which he seemed unwilling to part with, and which I suppose to have been a private signal by which he was to be known upon his return.</P>
<P>If the enemy intend to attack us, I assure you, Sir, we are very ill prepared to receive them. The whole amount of the continental troops, fit for duty, is 1576 rank and file, exclusive of Baldwin's artificers 140, and Whitcomb's 52 rangers. Besides these there are three regiment of Hampshire militia, engaged for no par∣ticular time, and who go off whenever they please, 150 are gone since last return; two regiments of Mas∣sachusetts militia of 252 rank and file fit for duty, engaged for two months from their arrival, three weeks of which with some of them is already expired. Amongst the number returned sick there is no doubt but many would be useful in case of necessity, but at any rate we cannot reckon upon more than 2200 men. I am very much concerned to give you this disagreeable detail, but I have something worse to add to it.—We cannot increase our numbers by calling in the militia without ruin; for by the Commissary's return, and the account of his weekly expenditure, there is meat for seven weeks only on the ground, and he has no prospect of any supply of salt-meat, but from some place near Still-Water, nor of fresh, but by sending to New-England for it.—This I have desired him to do, but must own I have little prospect of advantage from it; for be assured that, and indeed every other communication, may and will very easily be cut off.—I have heard of some cattle below Crown-Point, which I shall send for to-morrow.</P>
<P>The bridge goes on tolerably well, but is indeed a very heavy troublesome job.—The cassoons, Colonel Baldwin says, will be sunk by the end of next week; in the mean time I have ordered the floating bridge to be removed to the lower side of them, which will serve as a kind of second boom, and retard at least, if not prevent, the enemy's vessels from passing, should they attempt it.</P>
<P>A magazine of wood should be laid in immediately, but how to effect it I know not, as there are no teams here of any kind, and not a stick upon the Mount.—All the timber for the bridge is hauled out of the woods by hand, and employs a much greater number of men than would otherwise be necessary, and might be employed, and are wanted for other purposes.—What can the Quarter-Master mean by leaving this place, where so many works are to be carried on, without so necessary an article as draught cattle?</P>
<P>The tents here are in general very bad. I must beg you, my dear General, to hasten up the new tents, for I shall get no good of the troops here in any way, whilst they remain in barracks.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="016142_0004_0F9B8E5D69B36A40"/>Our powder magazines are in so wretched a state, that I am told near fifty pounds of powder a week is damaged. In short, every thing is so much out of order, that I will add no more to this list of grievances, than to tell you we have no cartridge paper.</P>
<P>When I write again, I hope to have something more agreeable to entertain you with, and am, with much esteem.</P>

<P>I forgot to mention a paper in which Amsbury's money was wrapped, and is also inclosed; it is blurred and blotted, but you will observe it contains a letter from Eph. Jones to his brother, dated June 2d, about the time Amsbury left Montreal, and is a corroborating circumstance of the fellow's ill design.</P>
<P>I should have called upon the militia but for the state of our magazine—Should they come in fast, which I believe they would, they might eat us out before the arrival of either the enemy or a supply.— Please to give your directions on this head as soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s possible.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLOSED you have the returns of the troops and stores at this place, all except the cloathier's, which is so drained I thought it needless to ask for any from him, as he has almost literally nothing.</P>
<P>Since my last I have had constant scouts out, but have made no discovery of the enemy, save that four of their vessels are lying about a mile on the hither side of the Split Rock; they consist of two ships, and two gondolas; and on Friday last a schooner beat up within four miles of Crown Point, but, without landing any of her people, or coming to anchor, returned down the lake.</P>
<P>Yesterday about noon we had two men, who had strolled out of camp without arms, taken by a party of savages, who had stole down to the road side betwixt M'Intosh's and the bridge, and concealed themselves in the bushes; they were immediately pursued as far as Putnam's Creek, but could not be overtaken; un∣luckily, however, they fell in with a scouting party I had sent down to discover the motions of the enemy, that were upon their return, and fired upon them unexpectedly; the officer is wounded, one man killed and scalped, and one missing, but whether taken or not is as yet uncertain.</P>
<P>Another party that I had ordered to proceed to Point-au-Fer, or wherever the enemy might be, returned last night on discovering a large party of Indians on the east side of the lake about four miles above Crown Point. I think of sending to feel their pulse to-night, as I am sure it would be of consequence to give these fellows a drubbing.</P>
<P>I am at a loss to form a judgment of the designs of the enemy. If they mean to attack us, one would think it indiscreet to put us on our guard by such a trifling affair, and yet I cannot think they could prevail with any number of the savages to come on, unless they had an army not far off to support them. Be that as it will, I shall use every precaution possible against surprize, and will endeavour to penetrate their designs. The same reason, notwithstanding our weakness, still prevails against calling for the militia as when I wrote last, having as yet received no supply of meat either fresh or salt.</P>
<P>Do you know, Sir, any thing about the terms upon which Capt. Whitcomb's corps was raised. He informs me, that by General Gates's orders he promised his people that they should have the same bounty as the troops of the State in which they were raised, notwithstanding they were not part of their quota. This promise has not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een complied with, and they are held by a conditional agreement only, which expires this day. I shall be able to retain them, however, until you favour me with your answer.</P>
<P>I am making some improvement upon the Mount, but that and the Ticonderoga side have such dependence upon, and connection with, each other, that in my opinion it will be very dangerous to give up either, and yet it is certain we cannot with our present numbers hold both. I design, however, to make the appearance of doing it, and, after defending Ticonderoga as long as possible, retreat to Mount Independence.</P>
<P>Our guards are crouded with tories; they are dangerous here, and cannot properly be tried. I have ordered them to Albany. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>SERJEANT HEATH, who I sent down the lake to make discoveries, returned last night, and informs me, that on Tuesday last he saw two birch canoes going down the lake with sixteen Indians and three white men in them, and supposes it was the party that had done the mischief near the lines the day before— that from a place near the mouth of Otter Creek, he saw three vessels under sail beating up, one at anchor about one mile above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plit Rock, and the Thunderer behind it—from this place he likewise descried an encampment of the enemy on both sides of Gilliland's Creek—that from the appearance of it, and the extent, he thinks it must contain a great body of men, and that a number of smoaks arose at a distance back, which he supposes was from the encampment of the Indian—that on Friday last, from Pointon, he saw twenty batteaus come out of Gilliland's Creek, and sail up the lake past the Split Rock towards Ticonderoga—that one of the inhabitants, in whom he could place confidence, informed him the Indians were very numerous— that they frequently cross to the east side of the lake, and that a party of them had been at his house a few minutes before his arrival—that he then returned to Otter Creek, where he proposed to have halted to refresh his party, but, on being informed that a large party of Indians were at one Briton's, he made the best of his way here—one of his party this day fell behind a little, and was either taken or deserted; he suspects the latter, because he both waited for him, and sent back to look for him—that one Webb, another inhabitant, informed him that the enemy had been four or five days at Gilliland's—that they came up with a vast number
<PB N="6" REF="016142_0005_0F9B8E5E83043398"/>
of batteaus and some gondolas—that some of the troops come over frequently, and say their whole army is there, and that they are only waiting the arrival of the rest of their vessels and stores, when they are to attack this place.</P>
<P>I have no doubt that a party of the enemy are at Gilliland's, nor that their design is to come here, but not in my opinion to attack, but to harrass us, and give confidence to their savages, who, it is more than probable, would not have been prevailed upon to undertake it without being joined by some regular troops. Were they in force, it is improbable they would waste their time at such a distance, in a part of the country where they can find nothing to refresh themselves; and I do not find that they have made any depredations on the east side.</P>
<P>It is not easy to judge of the force at a distant view of an encampment, and Heath must have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> miles or more distant from that on Gilliland's Point, a distance too great to determine any thing with pre∣cision, although he had a glass to assist his eye; besides, I think the ground is not capable of encamping a great number (for he insists on it they are not on the high ground, but upon the beach only) but of this you are a much better judge than me, as I never saw it but once: Be the matter as it will, I shall endeavour to guard against surprize, and to discover both them and their designs; and, if opportunity offers, feel their pulses a little.</P>
<P>I had all the ground between this and Crown Point, from the lake some distance over the mountains, well examined yesterday with a heavy scout, but they discovered no enemy, nor appearance of any. Whitcomb says he is certain there has not been an Indiain but three in that quarter since the prisoners were taken, and that it was three or four days since these three had been there; so that the Indians said to have been about us, and fired at, were, I believe, the children of a disturbed imagination.</P>
<P>You had an exceeding bad time to cross the lake, but I hope you got well over, and without any injury to your health, though it must have been exposed, as I doubt if you was not obliged to be out a second night. I shall write again to you by express the moment I make any farther discoveries; and am, with much respect and esteem,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I INFORMED you yesterday that an encampment of the enemy had been discovered at Gilliland's Creek. Last night two of their vessels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are seven lying at that place; the rest of their fleet is probably but a little lower down, as we heard their morning guns distinctly at different places. They have also debarked some troops, and encamped upon Chimney Point. Whether they have landed at Crown Point my scout-boat did not discover, not daring to venture far enough down the Lake for that purpose, on account of their shipping; but I have sent a party on this side the river, which, I doubt not, will bring a just account of their situation.</P>
<P>I cannot help repeating to you the disagreeable situation we are in, nor can I see the least prospect of our being able to defend the posts, unless the militia come in; and should the enemy protract their operations, or invest us, and content themselves with a simple blockade, we are infallibly ruined. I have thoughts of calling for the Berkshire militia, which are nearest to us, and will probably be the most alert to come to our assistance, because they are in some measure covered by this post; but on that I shall consult the other General Officers. This, however, is clear to me, that we shall be obliged to abandon this side, and then they will soon force the other from us; nor do I see a retreat will in any shape be practicable. Every thing, however, shall be done, that is possible, to frustrate the designs of the enemy; but what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked and unaccoutred. I shall write you again as soon as the scout returns,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS moment I have received information from Hoite, of Otter Creek, that a large party of Indians and Tories are gone up that creek, supposed to be five hundred, and are designed to cut off the communi∣cation by Skeensborough. They took a pair of oxen from one of the inhabitants, and drove them about two miles above Middlebury Falls, where they halted the day before yesterday, and killed and dressed the cattle; and it is supposed that to-night they will be at the new road near Castle-Town, which is twenty-eight miles from hence, and twelve or fourteen from Skeensborough. They reported that a very large party had gone on the west side of the Lake, to fall upon Fort George. That is said to consist of 1000 Indians and Canadians.</P>
<P>We have also had just now another attack at the Mills; we have two men killed, two taken, and two wounded, one mortally. The scene thickens fast, and Sunday next, it seems, is fixed for the attack on this place. We must make the best we can of it, and I hope at least to cripple them so as they may not be able to pursue their fortune, should it declare in their favour.</P>
<P>I sent a party down last night to reconnoitre them, who are not yet returned, which gives me some uneasiness. I hope, however, they are safe, and will bring me some intelligence of consequence. I have some thoughts, if they are not numerous, of attacking them. If they get the worst, it will oblige them to recal their parties. If not, there will be too many left to become prisoners.</P>
<P>I have sent to the Grants to inform them of the Otter Creek party, and to desire that all they can possibly spare of the militia may be ready to march at a minute's warning.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY scout, on which I depended much for intelligence, is not yet returned, nor I fear ever will now. It consisted of three men only, the best of Whitcomb's people, and picked out by him for that purpose. The woods are so full of Indians, that it is difficult for parties to get through. I shall send off Whitcomb himself
<PB N="7" REF="016142_0006_0F9B8E60199EAB88"/>
presently, for intelligence I must have, altho' I am very loth to put him upon it, lest he should fall into the hands of the enemy, who have no small desire to have him in their power.</P>
<P>I sent Colonel Warner to the Grants yesterday, to raise a body of men to oppose the incursions of the savages that are gone by Otter Creek, and have ordered him to attack and rout them, and join me again as soon as possible. I am very happy to find the country were apprized of the march of that party before Col. Warner got to Skeensborough, as it will probably prevent their success, and may end in their ruin.</P>
<P>We are going on with the necessary works on the Mount as fast as possible, and have removed the most va∣luable of the stores and provision to that side. The bridge is in very little more forwardness, to appearance, than when you left this place, but they tell me this day will finish the getting timber for it. The boom is likewise placed, but very feebly secured for want of cables.</P>
<P>A party of Bradford's arrived yesterday in very good season, and has had a pleasing effect upon our people, who, never the most lively or gallant, began to show signs of dejection already. How they may hold out, God knows, but this has raised their spirits a little.</P>
<P>I could wish the batteaus were all over soon, or that you would not send them. I am extremely apprehen∣sive that the enemy will possess themselves of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anding, in which case they might fall into their hands. We cannot venture the teams now without a strong guard, and so many parties as we are obliged to make, with the fatigues, will very soon wear down our men.</P>
<P>We can do nothing but form conjectures about the force of the enemy, for I cannot find a single person, on whom I can depend, to venture amongst them for intelligence; but from their manner of beginning the campaign, I conclude that they are either in full force, or very weak, and hope by letting loose the Indian, to intimidate us. I incline to believe the last, but have as yet no certain rule to go by. However, we must know soon, and it is said they have marked to-morrow to attack. I beg leave to refer you for further parti∣culars to Colonel Varrick, who takes the charge of this, and am,</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS morning some of the enemy's gun-boats appeared at the Three Mile Point, when the alarm was given. We could see them disembark a number of men, and the boats increased to eighteen, which are now lying abreast from the hither side of the point to about half way across the Lake. The batteaus in which they transported their troops are not come in sight, lying on the far side of the point, under cover of it.</P>
<P>Soon after their landing, a party, chiefly Indians and Canadians, pushed towards our lines. As we had a scout down the Lake at the time of their arrival, I immediately sent out two parties to support and bring them off. The scout fell in with the enemy, and after a few shot, in which they say some of the Indians were killed, they, being overpowered by numbers, dispersed, and part of them are got in, and I have little doubt but the greatest part of them will yet make their appearance. It is probable, however, that some of them have fallen into their hands. We have had one or two alarms before this, but they were occasioned by their boats coming up near our guard boats, and their firing upon them.</P>
<P>My people are in the best disposition possible, and I have no doubt of giving a good account of the enemy, should they think proper to attack us; and if the person I mentioned to you in my last pursues the opportunity that now presents itself, they will go back faster than they came on. He has above 1000 men.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOT finding a convenient opportunity to send off my letter, I have the pleasure to acknowledge the re∣ceipt of your letter of the 28th. The success of General Washington over General Howe is an event of such importance, as must destroy every prospect of the enemy's carrying their plans into execution, should they succeed here. I have ordered a feu-de-joye upon the occasion, and will find some way to communicate the in∣telligence to the enemy. We have now two ships, eighteen gun-boats, and three sloops, lying off the Three Mile Point, and they are forming a camp upon the Point, and retrenching it. This does not look like their being strong. Other matters I hope to manage to-morrow morning, but cannot be particular for fear of accidents.</P>

<P>GENERAL SCHUYLER requested the Council to take into consideration the state of this post, with respect to the number of troops necessary for its defence, the disposition of the troops, and mode of defence, the state of the fortifications, and the quantity of provision that may be depended upon.</P>
<P>He also laid before the Council the draught of a letter, as from General Sullivan, in answer to an inter∣cepted letter from Peter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ivius, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at Montreal, to that officer, intreating their opinion upon the propriety of sending that or any other, and to advise the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de of conveying one, if it should be the opinion of the Council that a letter ought to be sent. He also begged their opinion upon the proceedings of a Court Martial, held at this post on the 20th day of May last, by which Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b Runnels was sentenced to death; and to know if the Council would advise him to pardon or execute the convict.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016142_0007_0F9B8E6118DDC4B8"/>Captain Whitcomb, commanding two companies of rangers, raised in consequence of a resolution of the Honourable Continental Congress, having represented to General Schuyler, that it was understood by him, and promised by General Gates, that the men were to have the same bounty as was given by the Eastern States for raising the new army, that he engaged the men upon that condition to serve during the war, or, if that was not allowed, for four months, which time is now expired, and that the men refuse to continue in the service until the bounty abovementioned be allowed them. General Schuyler requests the advice of the Council on the premises.</P>
<P>The Council, having taken into their most serious consideration the several matters stated in the first article, are clearly and unanimously of opinion,</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> That the number of troops now at this post and Mount Independence, which are under 2500 effec∣tives, rank and file, are greatly inadequate to the defence of both posts.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> That both posts ought, nevertheless, to be maintained as long as possible, consistent with the safety of the troops and stores.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> That if it should become necessary to evacuate one or other of the posts, and that it remains in our election which, that it ought to be the Ticonderoga side.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth.</HI> That such cannon and stores as are not immediately necessary on the Ticonderoga side be removed, without delay, to Mount Independence.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> That the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence are very deficient; and that the repairing the old, and adding new works, ought to claim immediate attention; and that the engineers be directed to repair and make the necessary fortifications.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> That the obstructions in the Lake to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into our rear, and thereby cutting off all supplies, or preventing a retreat, if such a measure should unhappily become in∣dispensably necessary, ought to be compleated with all imaginable dispatch.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh.</HI> That so much remains to be done effectually to compleat the obstructions, that, with the few troops we have, there is no great probability that it can be done in less than six weeks.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth.</HI> That although our forces may be adequate to maintain our ground on Mount Independence, yet, unless a sufficient stock of provision can be thrown in before the arrival of the enemy, we having now only thirty-nine days provision of meat kind, we think it would be imprudent to expose the army to be made prisoners by the enemy; and that, therefore, it is prudent to provide for a retreat; to effectuate which, that all the batteaus now at this post be immediately repaired, and as many as can be spared out of Lake George be brought hither.</P>
<P><HI>Ninth.</HI> That a quantity of provision of the meat kind should, if possible, be immediately forwarded from Albany or else-where.</P>
<P><HI>Tenth.</HI> That immediate application be made to his Excellency General Washington for a reinforcement to be sent on with all expedition.</P>
<P>The draught of the letter, mentioned in the se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d article of what General Schuyler laid before the Council, being read, and some alterations made, was agreed to by the Council, and resolved should be sent to Mr. Livius.</P>
<P>That the sentence of the Court Martial on Caleb Runnels, a soldier in Captain Miller's company, in the regiment lately commanded by Colonel (now Brigadier General) Patterson, be carried into execution. On the subject of Captain Whitcomb's corps of rangers, the Council recommend that they be informed, that General Schuyler will immediately lay a state of the case before the Honourable Continental Congress, and take their direction; that if Congress should not allow them the bounty given by the Eastern States, they will be discharged, agreeable to their contract.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21<HI>st.</HI> General Schuyler informed the Council, that only four men of Captain Whitcomb's corps were willing to continue in the service, unless the bounty given by the Eastern States was allowed them, and begged the farther opinion of the Council on the matter, who, taking the matter again into consideration, unanimously resolved, that, considering the weak state of the garrison, the great use which experience has evinced the corps is of, especially at this critical juncture, when the enemy have so many parties of Indians in the vicinity of this post, the information given by Captain Marshall and Captain Alredges, which is hereunto annexed, the probability that either the State of New-Hampshire or the Masachussetts-Bay would be willing to stand charged with the extra bounty, provided this corps were considered as part of their quota, it would be adviseable to pay the bounty, and they recommend it should immediately be done.</P>

<P>Major Lansingh says he compared the copy of Mr. Hancock's letter to General Schuyler, dated 30th No∣vember, 1775, with the original, and that it is a true copy.</P>
<P>Major General Schuyler proceeds in his Defence, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Mr. President, and Gentlemen of the Court Martial,</HI></P>
<P>AS Courts Martial may, with propriety, be considered not only as Courts of Justice, but also as Courts of Honour, I am happy that my conduct is to be examined, and its merits ascertained by this. What∣ever consolation conscious rectitude may afford me and others, who have reason to complain of calumny and detraction, I am still too sensible of the value of reputation to myself and family, not to wish for the esteem of those who merit commendation, and, particularly, to possess the good opinion of those great and good men, to whose virtuous exertions, in the Council and the Field, America will be indebted for Liberty, Independence and Security.</P>
<P>The charge against me is simple, and confined to one point, and the evidence adduced to support it is comprized in very little compass. I wish the nature of my defence would admit of equal conciseness. But, gentlemen, it will be necessary to remind you, that, to invalidate a charge of neglect, instances of attention and care must be produced, and, of consequence, that may defence will principally consist of a detail of facts, and necessarily be prolix. Permit me therefore to entreat your patience, and to assure you that I will studi∣ously avoid calling your attention to any matters, either of evidence or argument, but such as shall appear to me essential to the elucidation of the important question you are now to determine.</P>
<P>On the 19th day of June, 1775, Congress did me the honour of appointing me a Major General in the American army, and soon after to the command of the Northern Department, in which I was superseded in the month of February or beginning of March, 1777, and restored to it on the 22d day of May following, and again superseded in it on the 20th day of August, in the same year. Within the last mentioned period Major General St. Clair was, by Congress, appointed to take charge of the sorts at Ticonderoga. Those sorts were invested on or about the first day of July, and evacuated on the sixth day of July, 1777. During the whole time of the siege, I am charged with having been absent, and therein of having neglected my duty. To this charge I am now to answer. But as the readiness or reluctance, of persons accused, to come to trial, natu∣rally creates presumptions for or against them, which become, with great propriety, part of the evidence on which their acquittal or condemnation will rest, I beg leave previously to lay before you certain facts and papers, from which not only my willingness, but solicitude, for a trial will evidently appear.</P>
<P>As the loss of Ticonderoga was sensibly felt by all America, and had occasioned much resentment as well as surprize, I presumed that this enquiry would have been made as soon as the necessary information and evi∣dence could be obtained, and therefore the respect due to Congress restrained me from pressing it until near two months after the date of their order had elapsed. After this I took the liberty of writing to Congress sundry letters on the subject, of which the following are extracts. The receipts of all which, except that of the 4th of November and 26th of January, were either acknowledged by the Honourable President of Con∣gress, or by resolutions founded on the subject matter of the letters, from whence the extracts, were drawn.</P>

situation, will pay such attention to the object of their appointment, as that the enquiry into my conduct may take place as early as possible.

<P>WHEN a man of sentiment, labouring under odious and injurious suspicions, has in prospect a period which promises to afford him relief, and restore quiet to his mind, it is natural that he should anxiously wish for its arrival. The conviction of a good and a clear conscience leaves not a doubt in my mind, that the result of the enquiry into my conduct will have that effect, and restore me to the full confidence of such of my honest countrymen as have been led away by popular clamour, and that I shall stand confessed the sincere and affec∣tionate friend of my country. Congress will therefore pardon me, if I am importunate on this subject. I have suffered so much in public life, that it cannot create surprize if I anxiously wish to retire, and pay that attention to my private affairs, which the losses I have sustained by the enemy, and the derangement occasioned by devoting all my time to the duties of my offices, have occasioned; and yet the impropriety of resigning them, before the enquiry has taken place, or the Committee reported my innocence, is too striking to need dwelling upon.</P>

<P>THE weakness of the Board of Commissioners, and the distance at which two of the members reside from hence, has frequently obliged General Schuyler and Mr. Douw solely to transact the business. General Wool∣cott has little hopes that he will be able to attend the next conference, and General Schuyler thinks it probable that he shall before that be favoured with the orders of Congress, to attend at Head Quarters for the enquiry into his conduct. On these accounts, it is necessary that the Board should be strengthened, especially as the business of the approaching treaty is highly interesting.</P>

<P>I HAVE already trespassed on the patience of Congress, but I feel myself obliged to intreat their attention a moment longer. Eight months have already nearly elapsed since the appointment of the Committee to enquire into the causes of the loss of Ticonderoga, and no report as yet made. What I have suffered in the interim, although supported by an approving conscience, will be more easily conceived by every man of sen∣timent, than described by any. Let it suffice for me to observe that to a man, far from being indifferent as to the manner in which his character may be handed down to posterity, the reflection that he may be called from the stage of life before his superiors have justified him to the world, or before he has had an opportunity given him to do it himself, creates the most disagreeable feelings, and these, if possible, encreased by the reflection that a young family may be deeply injured, and the supposed guilt (however unjust the suspicion) of the father embitter the lives of his children. Let me then most humbly intreat Congress, that the Committee may be ordered to report without delay; and permit me to beg of you, Sir, to advise me, by the return of the express which carries this, of the determination of the Honourable House.</P>

<P>THE Legislature of this State having done me the honour to appoint me one of the Delegates, to repre∣sent it in Congress, I propose attending my duty there the soonest possible, but most earnestly wish for a pre∣vious enquiry into my conduct; the event of which, I trust, will induce the inhabitants of such of the other States, who may have entertained prejudices to my disadvantage, to return to that confidence of which this has given me so honourable a testimony.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I trust these repeated requisitions to the Honourable Congress to expedite the enquiry will evince, that I by no means wished to forego one. Indeed, the delay has been extremely injurious and chagrining to me, and has most effectually operated as a punishment much more severe than I deserved, even if the error in judgment with which I am charged had really existed, which I by no means can avow. I do not, however, wish to have it understood that the delay was intentional. Indeed, I still retain the same opinion, which I have expressed in one of the letters I have quoted, that I was confident it was not the intention of Congress, or of the Com∣mittee, to let me remain in the disgraceable situation I was in longer than absolute necessity required; but I impute that delay to the vast variety of important objects, which claimed the attention of the Representative Body of the United States towards the close of last campaign, during the winter, and subsequent spring, and which might justify them in sacrificing the feelings of an individual to the more weighty concerns of the United States.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to my Defence.</P>
<P>I admit that I was absent from Ticonderoga, from the 24th of June to the conclusion of the siege; but I beg leave to insist, and doubt not shall be able to prove that I was guilty of no neglect of duty in not being there—For this purpose I hope to be indulged,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> In submitting to your examination the general tenor of my conduct, prior to that event; for should it, on enquiry, appear to be strongly marked by incessant attention to every part of my duty, it will afford, at least, presumptive evidence against my having neglected it in this.</P>

<P N="3">3<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly.</HI> In shewing that, from the time of the evacuation of Ticonderoga to the time of my being superseded, every part of my conduct gives full evidence of care and attention: And</P>
<P><HI>Lastly.</HI> That, although superseded and calumniated, I uniformly continued my exertions in the common cause, and received frequent marks of the confidence of Congress. From whence, in my opinion, the infer∣ence will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low, that Congress still retained a favourable opinion of my attention to the public weal, as well as of my inclination to promote it.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> With respect to my conduct, prior to the evacuation of Ticonderoga. It will be necessary to divide it into three periods:</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> From the time I first took the command of the Northern Department, to the surrender of Montreal.</P>
<P>The light in which Congress viewed it will appear from the following letter, which I had the honour of receiving from them on that occasion.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with the utmost satisfaction, that the Congress received your information of the surrender of Montreal, and the general success which has attended the American arms in the province of Canada.</P>
<P>They are sensible of the various obstacles you had to encounter, and have unanimously resolved, that your conduct, attention and perseverance, merit the thanks of the United Colonies, which I have now the pleasure of presenting to you.</P>
<P>The Congress hear, with concern, your request of leave to retire. They regret the injuries your health has sustained in the service, and beg you will not insist on a measure, which would, at once, deprive America of the future benefits she expects from your zeal and abilities, and rob you of the honour of compleating the glorious work you have so happily and successfully begun.</P>
<P>You have hitherto risen superior to a thousand difficulties, in giving freedom to a great and oppressed people. You have already reaped many laurels, but a plentiful harvest still invites you. Proceed therefore, and let the footsteps of victory open a way for blessings of liberty, and the happiness of well ordered govern∣ment, to visit that extensive dominion.</P>
<P>Consider! that the road to glory is seldom strewed with flowers, and that, when the black and bloody standard of tyranny is erected in a land possessed by freemen, patriots cease to remain inactive spectators of their country's fate.</P>
<P>Reflect, Sir, that the happiness or misery of millions yet unborn is now to be determined, and remember that you will receive an honourable compensation for all your fatigues, in being able to leave the memory of illustrious actions, attended by the gratitude of a great and free people, as a fair, a splendid, and a valuable inheritance to your posterity. I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, Sir,</P>

<P>But as the winter previous to the siege of Ticonderoga, included in this period, was the season of preparing for the ensuing campaign, and as the commencement of that campaign proved unfortunate, and many have from thence inferred that due preparations were not made for it, I think it of importance that my conduct relative to it should be made known to you.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remark, that the campaign, on our part, was to be merely defensive. The out∣lines of the plan for the defence are contained in the following extract of a letter to a Committee of Congress, appointed to visit the Northern Department, &amp;c. An idea of the plan is essential to forming a judgment of my conduct, relative to the execution of it.</P>

<SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AGREEABLE to your request, I do myself the honour to communicate to you my opinion of what preparations I conceive necessary to be made the ensuing winter, and what measures to be adopted, effectually to prevent the enemy from penetrating into this country by the Northern or Western communications. If the enemy are not able to dislodge our troops from Ticonderoga, or penetrate to the Mohawk River this fall,
<PB N="12" REF="016142_0011_0F9B8E62ABFD5A40"/>
they will probably attempt an expedition in the winter, Canada being able to furnish them with such a num∣ber of sleds as will suffice to transport all their artillery and provision, if their number should be 10,000; nor will our garrisons of Ticonderoga or Fort George be any obstacles, as they can easily pass by the former in sleds, at such a distance as to be out of the reach of our cannon, and the latter is too insignificant to make any resistance, so as much to retard their progress. It is therefore of the last importance, that as much of the army as can be kept together should be cantoned in the vicinity of this place, of which the enemy will be informed, and it will probably deter them from the attempt. But, should they remain quiet in Canada until next spring, it is reasonable to suppose that they will then make the most vigorous exertions to penetrate either by Ticonderoga, or, what is much more likely, by Fort Stanwix. Both communications, therefore, claim our attention.</P>
<P>The fortifications at Ticonderoga should, in my opinion, be as much contracted as possible, and a fort built on Mount Independence, to cover batteries near the Lake side, and the redoubt on the Ticonderoga side, so as that the pass may be defended with a few men. The navigation should be effectually stopped by sinking cassoons at small distances, and joined together by string pieces, so as, at the same time, to serve for a bridge between the fortifications on the east and west sides. This work should be executed in the winter. But as these fortifications would not prevent the enemy from drawing their small craft over land, from beyond the Three Mile Point, into Lake George, the passage of that lake should also be obstructed, either by cassoons from island to island in the Narrows, if practicable, or by floating batteries.</P>
<P>Whilst a part of the army is employed in this service, another body of troops should be sent to Fort Stan∣wix, to strengthen that fortification, and to make some others, at such places near the Mohawk river as may be deemed best for the purpose of retarding the enemy, should they make themselves masters of Fort Stanwix. And that we may be well prepared, and every department put in order, I conceive it necessary that the com∣manding officer of artillery should be directed to procure every necessary in his department, that we may not have to seek it when the campaign opens.</P>
<P>That the chief Engineer be directed to do the like.</P>
<P>That the Quarter Master General do the same.</P>
<P>That the like order be given to the Commissary General.</P>
<P>That all the battraus now on Lake Champlain and Lake George should be put into the best repair as early as possible, in the months of February or March at farthest.</P>
<P>That one hundred batteaus be built in those months at Schenectady.</P>
<P>That a quantity of boards and plank should be collected at Fort George.</P>
<P>That a sufficiency of pitch, oakum, and whatever may be necessary for building and repairing vessels, floating-batteries or batteaus, be collected, and carried to Fort George, Fort Ann, Skeensborough and Sche∣nectady, in the course of the winter.</P>
<P>That provision for 5000 men, for eight months, be immediately brought to Albany, and carried in the winter to Fort Ann; a like quantity to remain in store at Albany, to be sent to the westward, if there be oc∣casion. This is a matter that ought immediately to be attended to, and therefore a sufficient quantity of salt should directly be sent to Albany.</P>
<P>That a large train of artillery, both heavy and light, should be sent, in the course of the winter; part to remain at Albany, and as much as may be necessary for Ticonderoga and Fort George to be sent there. This must be done in winter, at once to save a vast expence, and that we may not be embarrassed in the spring with the transportation of articles so extremely difficult to move.</P>
<P>That a Laboratory should be established at Albany, to fix all the ammunition necessary for the campaign.</P>
<P>That fifteen companies, to consist of a Captain, or Overseer, and thirty men, be engaged for the batteau service, and to be employed on the highways, and other necessary works in the Quarter-Master General's de∣partment. It not only ruins soldiers to employ them in such business, and is more expensive, but also weak∣ens the army too much.</P>
<P>That four companies of carpenters, to consist of an Overseer and 25 each, be engaged to attend the army. If more are occasionally wanted, they can be procured in Albany or its vicinity. I have taken the liberty to enclose a list of some articles, that may be absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>The duty of the Pay-Masters should be clearly pointed out to them. Who is to appoint Pay-Masters to those regiments who yet have none?</P>
<P>What is to be done with the remainder of Livingston's, Hazen's and Duggen's Canadian corps, and with the Canadian refugees now in Albany?</P>
<P>Are Nicholson's and Elmore's regiments to be compleated? If so, who is to grant warrants for recruiting them?</P>
<P>The bedding for the troops should be sent as soon as possible.</P>
<P>Be so good as to send me a draft of Schuylkill ferry scows, with their dimensions. I wish to have this as soon as possible.</P>
<P>If silled woollen caps could be procured at Philadelphia, a quantity-should be sent up to the army.</P>
<P>Glass for the barracks is much wanted.</P>
<P>Altho' the enemy's fleet on Lake Champlain is formidable, would it not be well to construct very large and strong vessels this winter? If Congress should resolve on doing it, a very large number of carpenters should be sent up immediately, and guns and carriages provided.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE great expence, and almost insuperable difficulty, which attends the transportation of provision for a large army in the spring of the year, point out the propriety of laying in a very considerable stock at
<PB N="13" REF="016142_0012_0F9B8E636CC10FD0"/>
Fort George and Fort Ann in the course of the winter. I can hardly suppose that you are or will be possessed of pork or salted beef sufficient for this purpose, so as to have it here before the river closes. I would therefore advise that a quantity of salt, sufficient for curing 5000 barrels of pork or beef, should be immediately sent to Mr. Avery, with your orders for him to purchase beef and pork, and salt it here.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="orders">
<HEAD>Copy of Orders to Colonel Lewis, D. Q. M. G. of the Northern Department, dated Albany, <DATE>November <HI>9, 1776.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE duties of your office, by much the most difficult to fulfil of any in the army, are so many, and depend so much on circumstances, which no one can possibly foresee, that only general rules can be laid down for your conduct in the execution of it. Great diligence, activity, prudence and foresight, are in∣dispensably necessary, as you will soon experience. A close attention to your duty is the only means of acquir∣ing a perfect knowledge of it. I shall, however, sketch out a few directions.</P>
<P>The supplying the army with provisions, when they are delivered to you by the Commissary General, is a capital part of your business; and as it must be done partly by water, and partly by land, it demands a watch∣ful eye to keep a proper number of boats and carriages at each station. The provision goes from hence in batteaus to Half-Moon, from whence it is conveyed in carriages to Stillwater. There it is again embarked in batteaus, and transported to the Saratoga Falls. Thence by land across a small portage. Thence by water to Fort Miller Falls. Then across a small carrying-place by land, and again by water to Fort Edward. Then by land to Fort George or Fort Ann. From the former by water to the north end of Lake George, and by land to the Saw Mills, whence it is conveyed by water to Ticonderoga. If it goes by the way of Fort Ann, it is there put in batteaus, and conveyed down Wood Creek to Skeen's Falls, and rolled across a small portage to the south end of Lake Champlain, and conveyed by water to Ticonderoga. Between this and Half Moon eleven batteaus are now employed, carrying from 160 to 170 barrels. As the days are now short, the batteau∣men will not be able to make a trip a day, unless they are dispatched by sun-rise every morning. It is there∣fore incumbent on you to see that done, and that it may not be detained at Half Moon, 34 waggons, at least, should be daily employed between that and Stillwater. Seventeen batteaus are now employed in carrying it from Stillwater to Saratoga Falls. These must make two trips in three days. Two waggons are employed at that place and four batteaus, to convey it to Fort Miller, each making three trips.</P>
<P>At Fort Miller two waggons are employed, and from thence twelve batteaus convey it to Fort Edward, where 70 waggons must be constantly employed in transporting it either to Fort Ann or Fort George, from whence the troops are to carry it on, which you must take care to see done. The least reflection will point out, that if at any one station the provision is detained, all above it are idle. To keep all going together is therefore indispensably necessary, and will frequently require your personal inspection.</P>
<P>Providing quarters for the troops is another part of your duty, and furnishing those quarters with every necessary must be done without delay.—2500 men will remain at Ticonderoga,—about 400 at Fort George,— 400 at Fort Edward,—1000 at Saratoga,—500 at Albany,—100 at Skeensborough,—100 at Fort Ann,—500 at Schenectady,—200 at John's-Town,—100 at the German Flats,—and 400 at Fort Schuyler,—making in the whole 6200. For all these bedding, or straw at least, is to be furnished, fire-wood and barrack utensils, such as pails, tongs, shovels, trammels, axe, and kettles. These are to be delivered to the Barrack-Master, who is to be accountable for them.</P>
<P>When troops march, all carriages are to be furnished by you. Indeed, you are to furnish carriages and vessels for whatever belongs to the army, except the carriages for conveying the cannon, although you must find the cattle to draw them.</P>
<P>A stock of fire-wood must be immediately laid in here, for the use of the troops, and the barracks put into the best repair. Directions are given by me for erecting the barracks at the other places.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of Orders to Colonel Wayne, dated Saratoga, <DATE>November <HI>23, 1776.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE care of the fortresses of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence being committed to you, as command∣ing officer, with a garrison composed of your regiment and those of Wood's, Dayton's, Irvine's, Burrel's and Whitcomb's, the artillery under Major Stevens, together with the light infantry companies under Captain Whitcomb, Colonel Baldwin, the Chief Engineer, with sundry artificers, and Major Hay, as A. D. Q. M. G. exceeding in all upwards of 2500 rank and file, I have the fullest confidence in your vigilance, attention and foresight, to guard against a surprize, and to do every thing that may have a tendency to secure your post, and to promote the weal of the service, and that you will not lose the least time in putting yourself in the best posture of defence possible. You will continually keep scouting parties on the Lake, as long as the season will permit it to be navigated, and when that is no longer practicable, parties must be kept out on both sides of the Lake, to give the earliest intelligence of the approach of an enemy. You will pay the strictest attention to your guards and centinels, and punish severely the least remissness in a duty, on which the safety of the sorts and troops so imminently depend.</P>
<P>Provisions are forwarding to you in very considerable quantities, and I have ordered such a stock to be laid in before the navigation stops, as will maintain your garrison for three months, and long before that is ex∣pended a fresh supply will be sent on. A very considerable quantity of vegetables will be forwarded to you, as soon as the troops that are retiring into winter quarters are passed this place. Bedding is also preparing, and will be sent you as soon as possible, together with a number of iron stoves, which I have sent for, to be put up in your barracks, for the greater comfort of the men.</P>
<P>You well know of what importance it is, that the greatest attention should be paid to the health of the men. Cleanliness in their persons and quarters, and having their victuals properly dressed, are capital p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ints, and greatly tend to the preservation of the men. All huts and buildings that may in the least obstruct the defence of your posts must be levelled, reserving all such materials as may hereafter be serviceable to the army.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="016142_0013_0F9B8E643360E4A0"/>As it is of importance that I should be constantly and fully informed of what passes, of the state of your garrison, and its wants, you will do me the pleasure to write me frequently.</P>
<P>You will please, as soon after the receipt of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s you conveniently can, to send me a return of your garrison, and order Major Stevens to make me a minute return of all the ordnance, ammunition and artillery stores, at the post you command, with an estimate of whatever is wanted, not only for the defence of the works already erected, but such others as the chief Engineer shall think necessary to construct. The chief Engineer is likewise to make a return of every article in his department, and his wants for an army of 10,000 men. Major Hay will make a like return, and the Commissary one of what provision he has in store. If soap and candles are wanted, he must immediately apply to Mr. Avery for them.</P>
<P>You will please to order all the batteaus between you and Skeensborough, and from every other part of the lake, to be collected and drawn out of the water. The like to be done at the landing, as soon as all the pro∣visions are gone over Lake George. Major Hay will not forget to mention in his return the number of batteaus, nor omit attention to the barrack chimneys, which should be swept once every fortnight.</P>
<P>Whatever money you may have occasion for, to pay contingent expences, I shall order you to be furnished with, on application to me.</P>

<P>THE Hon. Continental Congress having ordered me to apply to you for such military stores as may be in the public stores with you, and suitable for this department, I must beg the favour of you to take the advan∣tage of the first good sledding, to forward all the heavy cannon you can spare to Albany, that it may be carried from thence to Ticonderoga in the course of the winter, together with the intrenching tools and nails mentioned in a return you made to Congress.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAJOR Stevens, who will deliver you this, commands the corps of artillery in this department. A va∣riety of articles are wanted, and he has directions to purchase whatever he can in the Eastern States. Should he apply to you for money for this service, you will please to order the Pay-Master to furnish him.

<P>HAVING given you orders for supplying the army with every necessary in your department, and as many of the articles must necessarily be procured in the Eastern States, you will therefore, as soon as you have arranged matters at Albany, repair to said States, and forward every thing you purchase there to Albany, as soon as it can be done. You will from time to time let me know how you proceed, and where you are, that I may call upon you at any time when your presence may be necessary. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>AS it is of the utmost consequence that a sufficiency of intrenching tools, and whatever else may be neces∣sary in your department, should be provided for an army of 10,000 men, between this and the opening of next campaign, you are therefore immediately to employ such a number of artificers, as will suffice to com∣pleat whatever may be wanted. I have ordered ten setts of blacksmiths tools, with the necessary appurtenances, to be purchased at Albany, and ten tons of iron to be brought there without delay. Part of your artificers should, therefore, be employed in that place, and the remainder at Ticonderoga, where you have work-shops already erected, furnished with the necessary tools. What money you may want, effectually to carry on this service, you will call on me for. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>AS many of the articles mentioned in the return you have made me, as what were wanted in your depart∣ment, may possibly be procured in the Eastern States, you will immediately repair thither, and purchase whatever you can, and cause them to be sent to Albany the soonest possible. I have entreated General Ward to furnish you with money, to pay for what articles you may purchase. Should there be none at Boston, you will send to me for what may be wanted. I have also requested the General to permit you to examine the continental stores in that quarter, and to take out such articles as may be needed in this department, of which you will make me a return the soonest possible, as also of what articles you may have a prospect of speedily procuring.</P>
<P>As you have represented the necessity of having a Commissary of Ordnance, a Master of Laboratory, and two Conductors, you will try to engage proper persons for each of those offices, who will be allowed the same pay as those serving under the immediate command of his Excellency General Washington. I wish them to be sent to Albany the earliest possible.</P>
<P>You will advise me of the success your recruiting officers have, and send as many men to Ticonderoga by the nearest rout, under the command of a proper officer, as they can get by the first of January.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE various business of your department, in making the necessary preparations for the next campaign, will require your closest and immediate attention. I shall therefore point out part of what is to be done, and which you are to execute without the least delay.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="016142_0014_0F9B8E6589D3B770"/>Four thousand iron spades, as many iron shovels, five hundred pick-a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and one thousand bill-hooks, are to be made, so as to be ready by the first of March. You will call on Colonel Pallefier, for directions in what manner the blacksmiths are to execute their work. Three thousand felling-axes must also be procured, and care taken that none are received but such as are really good. Also two hundred stone hammers, two hundred masons trowels, fifty crow bars. Besides the bar iron I have ordered, ten tons more must be pro∣vided, and three tons of nails sorted.</P>
<P>The batteaus in Lake George and Lake Champlain, and those employed in Hudson's and the Mohawk river, must also be repaired in the month of February, or March at farthest. Fifty batteaus must be built here, as many at Schenectady, and a like number at Saratoga, to be carried into Lake George. Timber, plank, boards, nails, pitch, oakum and cordage, must be provided in time, and such a number of oars, setting-poles, paddles and scoops, as you shall find, upon enquiry, are wanted.</P>
<P>Timber must be drawn this winter to the mills at Ticonderoga, Skeensborough, and that near Cheshire's, in sufficient quantities, at the two latter places, to keep the mills at work all next season. Not a moment's time must be lost in procuring this timber.</P>
<P>All the boards that can be procured at any of the mills in the vicinity of Fort Edward must be sent to Fort George or Cheshire's. Those from Wyng's or Park's mill to the former. All the others to the latter.</P>
<P>I wish you continually to reflect on the difficulties attending a long land transportation, especially in the spring of the year, when the roads are almost impassable, working cattle weak, and forage extremely scarce. Whatever therefore can be transported whilst the earth is covered with snow, must not by any means be neglected. All the provisions which the Commissary can furnish must be sent on in the course of the winter to Fort George and Cheshire's, except what may be wanted for the garrison of Ticonderoga, which you are to take care to <HI>have well</HI> supplied.</P>
<P>I have ordered sleds to be constructed at Saratoga, for transporting what cannon may be procured this winter. You will immediately send two blacksmiths, with bellows and every other necessary, to that place, to do the iron-work, and such other as may be wanted.</P>
<P>The carriages for the carrying-place between Lake George and the saw-mills must be put into the best order for transporting the provisions and batteaus in the spring, and sixty of the best working cattle, in high working order, must be got ready, so as to be at Lake George about the time that Lake George becomes passable in batteaus. Hay for five weeks must be provided, and lodged at the north end of Lake George, and some at the south end, with a sufficient quantity of corn to keep them in good order.</P>
<P>Steel must be immediately sent to Ticonderoga, to repair the broken axes, also ten setts of horse harness compleat. Iron pots, brass kettles, or sheet-iron kettles, must be provided in number sufficient for an army of ten thousand men. About two thousand five hundred may do.</P>
<P>Thirty sett of drag ropes, and twenty sett of mens harness, with two good gins, with blocks and falls, must be immediately got.</P>
<P>Purchase five hundred dressed sheep-skins, the wool on.</P>
<P>All the artillery stores, of what kind soever, that can be procured, must be sent up this winter; so must the several articles above mentioned.</P>
<P>The grape shot that is in town must be put into boxes without delay.</P>
<P>A number of grindstones must be procured and sent up.</P>
<P>All intrenching tools, and other articles, that can be put in boxes, should be so, marked and numbered.</P>
<P>Fifty log chains, and as many draught chains, will be wanted.</P>
<P>Six saws for English Mills, and four dozen for Dutch Mills. The latter may possibly be procured at Esopus, Catts-Kill or Kinderhook.</P>
<P>I foresee that the barracks and hospital will very soon be destitute of fire-wood. You will therefore take timely care to procure a supply, not only for daily use, but for the spring, as then it is not to be had, unless at an immoderate price, and with great difficulty. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have not been honoured with a line from Congress, on the subject of the preparations necessary for the next campaign in the Northern Quarter, altho' I transmitted my opinion on the subject in the beginning of November, I conclude that the enemy's manoeuvres in Jersey have so entirely engrossed their attention, that they have not been able to attend to what I suggested. I have therefore resolved, without waiting any longer for their directions, as the winter is slipping away, to carry into execution whatever I deem essential to the service, and which does not admit of further delay, of which, amongst other things, that of procuring a suf∣ficiency of cannon for the defence of Ticonderega, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is a capital article. I should therefore be glad to know what cannon you can furnish me with, and where I may send for them, as I wish that an article, so ex∣tremely difficult to move in the spring of the year, should be carried to the places for which they are designed whilst we are favoured with good sledding. A very considerable quantity of shot is also wanted; and as Mr. Livingston's furnace is out of blast, I cannot procure them there. Can these be got at Salisbury, and when? Besides the cannon for the forts, a number will be wanted for five or six stout gallies which I propose to build in Lake George, to prevent the enemy's penetrating by that Lake, if they should be able to dislodge us from the Ticonderoga side of Lake Champlain, and draw their boats by land into Lake George, which it would be possible for them to do, altho' we keep possession of Mount Independence. By the way of Skeensborough, I am morally sure they will not be able to penetrate; as I hope, in the course of the winter, so effectually to obstruct the Lake, between Ticonderoga and the Mount, as that no kind of vessels will be able to pass, unless they first make themselves masters of Mount Independence, which I think will be impossible, if we can pro∣cure men, cannon and ammunition. A stock of provision I shall take care to lay in this winter.</P>
<P>Colonel Simmonds, with part of his regiment, from the Massachusetts-Bay, is on his way from hence to Ticonderoga. I shall be extremely happy to see a succession of troops coming on, for I very much fear that the garrison will not be detained after the term of their enlistment expires.</P>
<P>I shall want two companies of carpenters, to construct the vessels intended for Lake George. Captain Lester and Captain Winslow gave good satisfaction last campaign, and I wish them to be employed in that business. Permit me to beg the favour of you to enquire of them, if they will each raise a company, so as to leave Connecticut about the first day of April. As Fort George is an extremely healthy place, they will, in all probability, not suffer so much by sickness as they did at Skeensborough.</P>
<P>I have the pleasure to inform you that I have received friendly messages from the Indians, who seem deter∣mined to observe a strict neutrality.</P>

<P>SHOULD the enemy leave us unmolested this winter, I shall hope that they will not be able to pene∣trate from the northward in spring or summer, provided troops, cannon and ammunition, are furnished me.</P>
<P>By a letter from the Honourable General Ward, of the 16th instant, which I also received last night, I find that I am to expect no cannon from your State. There are none in this, nor can I procure any from Pennsyl∣vania or Jersey. I am not yet advised what Connecticut can afford me, but I am confident it will be greatly short of our wants. I therefore wish the Legislature of your State would reconsider the matter, and supply me with all the cannon you possibly can.

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> The Indians appear to continue friendly to us, and I have reason to believe they will adhere to the promises of neutrality which they have made. I soon expect a visit from them. They are in great want of cloathing; blankets especially. If 4 or 500 can be procured, I wish them to be sent the very soonest possible.</P>
<P>I have been disappointed in procuring two tons of steel from New-Jersey, and it is an article so essentially necessary that it cannot be dispensed with. Pray be so good as to send me that quantity, or rather three tons, if it is to be had.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a letter to Congress, dated Albany, <DATE>December <HI>30, 1776.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>THAT I have not been honoured with the commands of Congress, on the various matters mentioned in my former letters, and in a paper which I delivered Messrs. Stockton and Clymer on the 11th ult. is most probably to be imputed to the necessity it has been under, of giving the closest attention to the manoeuvres of the enemy in Jersey. This consideration, and that of the winter's being considerably advanced, has induced me to proceed in making such preparations for the next campaign as I deem essentially necessary, without waiting the determination of Congress, trusting that Congress will readily pardon any <HI>saux pas</HI> I may commit from erring in judgment.</P>
<P>On the 3d instant I addressed myself to General Ward, on the subject of cannon and military stores. From the copy of his letter, which is inclosed, Congress will perceive that I am not likely to receive any aid from the Massachusetts-Bay. I have, however, since the receipt of his letter, which was received on the 29th inst. written by express to the Honourable Thomas Cushing, entreating that the Legislature of that State would re∣consider the matter, and furnish what cannon, &amp;c. they can, and urged the necessity of their being sent whilst the earth is covered with snow, as a great expence in the transportation will be saved by these articles being carried to Ticonderoga in winter. I have made similar applications to Governor Trumbull, and the President of New-Hampshire, and I propose in a few days to visit the Convention of this State on the same subject; for indeed, unless a sufficient number of cannon and ammunition can be procured, we must inevitably lose Ticonderoga, and what the consequences of such a disaster will be are too evident to dwell upon.</P>
<P>I have caused ten blacksmiths shops to be erected in this city, and have engaged workmen to be em∣ployed in making intrenching tools, axes, nails, &amp;c. and hope, with the assistance of the smiths in the vici∣nity, to get a sufficient stock of those necessary articles, provided I can any how procure a quantity of steel, for which I have applied to the Massachusetts-Bay; but left none should be sent from thence, I must again entreat Congress to order three tons from Pennsylvania or Jersey, with all the dispatch possible.</P>
<P>I have ordered all the provisions that can be procured to be sent to Fort George, Cheshire's and Ticon∣deroga. I fear a deficiency of salted meat, of which a sufficient stock should be laid in, as it would be risk∣ing too much to depend on the precarious supply of fresh beef, at a time when the fortresses may be invested by the enemy.</P>
<P>Forage is laying in for the cattle, which it will be necessary to employ in the spring, both at Ticonderoga and on the communication to it.</P>
<P>Directions are given for repairing the batteaus on Lake Champlain and Lake George, and for building one hundred and fifty, adapted to the navigation of Hudson's and the Mohawk rivers and Wood creek. Should the enemy be able to force us from Ticonderoga, it will be possible for them, although we keep possession of Mount Independence, to get into Lake George, by drawing their batteaus over land from below Ticonderoga; for although the task would be arduous, yet it is feasable, and ought to be guarded against. I therefore propose to build five or six flat bottomed vessels, of considerable force, on Lake George, and shall begin to prepare the necessary articles in the beginning of February, unless Congress should please to direct other∣wise; and about the same time I propose to begin the necessary work of obstructing the navigation of Lake Champlain, between Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, which I hope to execute so effectually, as not to leave a possibility for any kind of craft to pass whilst we keep possession of the latter place, and which <HI>I think we can do against any force whatever, provided we have a sufficient garrison, properly supplied with cannon, ammu∣nition and provision.</HI></P>
<P>A considerable quantity of cordage and oakum is wanted. If it cannot be supplied in this State, I shall send to Eastern ones, and so indeed I must for many articles that will be wanted. I wish therefore a resolution of Congress, directing every State to comply with my applications in whatever they can.</P>
<P>The Indians have sent me a friendly message, and I have great hopes that they will abide by the neutrality they have promised to observe. A report prevails that the enemy have requested the Mohawks to remove into the country, beyond our settlements, but I have reason to believe that it is void of foundation. I soon expect a visit from a considerable number of Chiefs and Warriors. They are in great distress for blankets. Unfor∣tunately we have none here. I have applied for some to the Massachusetts-Bay and New-Hampshire, and may probably receive some from thence.</P>
<P>The Legislature of the Massachusetts-Bay have ordered one-fourth of the militia of the country of Berkshire, and one-eighth of that of Hampshire, to Ticonderoga, to continue three months in service. Part of one regiment is marched from the former. What the whole number will be, from both, I cannot make a guess at. No troops are yet arrived here from Connecticut, nor can I learn that any are got to Ticonderoga from Hampshire, neither was any part of Colonel Warner's regiment there on the 26th; and Colonel Wayne advises me that he has no hopes of any troops remaining after the term of their enlistment expires, unless it be the Pennsylvanians, who, he believes, will not quit the post until regularly relieved. For three weeks, or perhaps a month to come, we have little to fear from an enemy, but as after that Lake Champlain will be passable, it is probable they will make an attempt, as I am well informed that they have two regiments at St. John's, three at Isle-aux-Noix, and a small body, as an advanced post, at Isle-la-Motte; and I conjecture that they would hardly keep so many troops at those places, if they did not meditate a winter expedition. It is there∣fore of importance that the garrison should be strengthened, and have therefore repeated my former applications for assistance to the Eastern States Those of Van Schaick's and Gans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>voort's regiments, that are raised, are under orders to march to Fort Edward, Fort George, Cheshire's and Skeensborough; but I fear the garrisons of those places will have left them before the relief gets there, which is detained through want of blankets, which I am trying to collect from the inhabitants in this city and county.</P>
<P>The non-commissioned officers and privates of Colonel Nicholson's regiment are all engaged in other corps, to serve during the war, or for three years, and the officers mentioned in the inclosed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are unprovided for. I beg the direction of Congress with respect to them.</P>
<P>Colonel Livingston has given me a list of some officers, copy of which I inclose for the approbation of Con∣gress. Perhaps some of Nicholson's officers might be provided for in Livingston's.</P>
<P>Most of the men in Colonel Elmore's regiment would re-engage for the war, some have already done it; but I have inhibited the recruiting officers of other corps to enlist any more of the men, as they are still to
<PB N="18" REF="016142_0017_0F9B8E672F4F6B70"/>
serve to the middle of April, and that Congress may perhaps order that regiment to be kept up, that there may not be so many officers unprovided for.</P>
<P>I wish to know the pleasure of Congress on the subject the soonest possible.</P>
<P>We are greatly at a loss for iron rods, to make nails out of. If I knew where to procure them, I should not trouble Congress.</P>
<P>If any cannon are to come from Pennsylvania, as I believe there must, for I have very little prospect of getting a supply elsewhere, I wish them to be sent whilst the snow continues on the ground.</P>
<P>The Pay Master General informs me that he has very little cash left. A speedy supply will be necessary, as such a variety of articles are to be purchased, and so much transportation to be paid for.</P>
<P>The Regimental Pay Masters will stand in need of very explicit instructions for the rule of their conduct. I take the liberty again to mention the necessity of sending them very soon, lest the accounts of the new army should get involved into that variety of confusion which has attended the old. If they do not arrive soon, I shall take the liberty to do it for those in this department.</P>
<P>Much as I wish to do myself the honour to pay my respects to Congress, yet so much is to be done here, and no other general officer in the department, that it would not be prudent for me to quit it at this conjuncture.</P>
<P>Colonel Pallefier was so bent on going to Congress, and importuned me so much on the occasion, that I consented, on his promise to return before the expiration of January. I hope he will not be permitted to tarry beyond that time.</P>
<P>I have ordered the director of the hospital to lay in a sufficient quantity of medicine and necessary stores for the hospital. He will find it extremely difficult to procure them; I therefore wish, if possible, that some may be sent from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Be pleased to accept the compliments of the season, and may every succeeding one bring with it an increase of happiness to America is my first wish.</P>
<P>As I do not chuse to risk this letter by the common expresses, I have thought it necessary to send an officer, and Captain Bloomfield, a very deserving one, of Colonel Dayton's regiment, is the bearer of this.</P>

<P>I AM well convinced that the reasoning of the owners of carriages is just, and although I am extremely loth to advance the price of transportation, yet, as necessity knows no law, we must give way to it.

<P>YOU will immediately proceed to Connecticut, or any of the Eastern States, and use your best endea∣vours to recruit a company of seamen, whereof you are to be the commander. Your pay will be ten pounds; two lieutenants, who will each be allowed six pounds; one master, six pounds; one boatswain, one carpenter, one gunner, and one clerk, four pounds ten shillings each; one gunner's mate three pounds four, one cook three pounds twelve, and forty sailors, each two pounds eight shillings per month, and all in lawful money of Connecticut.</P>
<P>If Lieutenant Thatcher and Lieutenant Little incline to re-engage in the service, you will offer them the lieutenancies; if not, you will appoint such others as you shall think proper, having a regard to their abili∣ties, integrity and zeal for the cause of America. You are also empowered to appoint all the other officers. The wages of the men to commence from the time of enlistment, and one penny lawful per mile for their subsistence until they arrive at Albany, to which place you will march the company as soon as it is com∣pleated. You and the two lieutenants will be allowed the like rations as captains and lieutenants in the army. You will take care to engage none but good sailors. I have furnished you with eight hundred dollars to pay the bounty, for which you are accountable. Two waggons, or one ox cart, will be allowed you, to trans∣port your baggage, and that of the company, to Albany.

<P>I AM under the necessity of detaining at Albany the continental troops raised in this State, for want of cloathing and blankets, although they are so greatly wanted at Ticonderoga. Your father informed me that you are employed by Congress, together with another gentleman, whose name had slipped his memory, to purchase cloathing, &amp;c. and advised me to dispatch an express to you, requesting an immediate supply. You and your colleague will therefore please to forward to Albany 1500 suits of cloathing, and, if possible, double that number of blankets, as a very considerable quantity of the latter are wanted for our Indian allies. Should any Indian goods come to your hands, or you be able to purchase them, you will also please to send to Albany 5000 l. worth.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your dispatches of the 30th ult. which were delivered me yesterday, on my arrival at this place. Congress will please to rest assured, that my best endeavours shall be exerted to carry into execution their intentions, conveyed in the several resolutions transmitted me, part of which I have already anticipated, as you will observe in a letter which I had the honour to address you on the last ult. or first of this month, and forwarded by Captain Bloomfield.</P>
<P>It is with great pain that I see no prospect of procuring the necessary artillery for the defence of Ticonderoga, and for arming the vessels to be constructed on Lake George. By the inclosed copy of a letter from Governor Trumbull, you will perceive that I cannot flatter myself with the hopes of receiving all the cannon Congress has ordered in the resolution of the 28th ult. but, should they even be sent, we shall still want a very consi∣derable number in addition; nor should we be destitute of a competent number of field pieces, left the enemy should change their route, and attempt an invasion by the way of Oswego.</P>
<P>Apprehensive that applications to the different States, for the many articles which are wanted, would be attended with t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o much delay, I some days since dispatched Mr. M'Carty to the Eastern States, to procure a number of articles which I enumerated, and amongst which were cordage and oakum. He gave me great hopes that he should be able speedily to accomplish his commission. Colonel Baldwin and Major Stevens, who left me early in December, had orders to procure whatever they could in their respective departments.</P>
<P>The resolution, investing General Washington with such ample powers, will certainly be attended with very salutary effects to our common cause, and seemed indispensibly necessary at this critical conjuncture. It will therefore doubtless meet with the approbation of every good American.</P>
<P>The Continental money is sinking with an alarming rapidity in this State; but as I doubt not but the Con∣vention thereof will enter spiritedly into measures conducive to prevent so alarming an evil, I hope soon to find its credit re-established.</P>
<P>As it is of great importance to be well informed of the enemy's intentions, I have made separate applica∣tions to two persons in Canada, in whose friendly sentiments to the cause of America I have the fullest confidence, and have promised them a generous recompence, to furnish me from time to time with the best intelligence. I have also directed Colonel Bedel, whose influence with the Caghnawaga and St. Francois In∣dians is very considerable, to attempt to gain information by their means. By receiving of it in three different channels, we shall be better enabled to judge of the truth or fallacy of what is given us by any of them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CONGRESS have resolved that eight months provision for 5000 men should be immediately lodged at the upper posts, for the use of the army in the ensuing campaign. This is to be understood as exclusive of what may be expended, between this day and the first of May next, by 3000 men. One thousand barrels of beef or pork, and a like quantity of flour, and the smaller species in proportion, should be lodged at Fort George, exclusive of what may be necessary for a garrison of 200 men to the first of May. The r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inder must be stored at Cheshire's or Skeensborough, except a sufficiency at Ticonderoga for 5000 men to the first of May next. All this provision must be procured in such time, as that it may be sent up to the places above∣mentioned whilst it can be carried in sleds, as it will be impossible to transport it in the spring. You are therefore not to lose a moment's time in procuring it, and give constantly notice to the Deputy Quarter Master General, that he may convey it away as fast as you can procure it.</P>
<P>A farther stock for 5000 men for eight months is, by the resolutions of Congress, to be laid in at this place, and you will also provide eight months provision for 500 men, to be sent to Fort Schuyler, and cause it to be stored at Schenectady.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="016142_0020_0F9B8E68A94500A0"/>You will, without delay, make me a return of what provision is now at Ticonderoga, Fort Schuyler, and at every post and place on the Northern and Western communications, and what you have in this city and elsewhere, ready to be transported.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY I received sundry papers from Colonel Elmore and Mr. Kirkland, copies whereof I do myself the honour to enclose.</P>
<P>The salt springs, mentioned in Mr. Kirkland's letter, No. 1, I conceive might be improved to advantage, if persons acquainted with the process of making salt were sent up, and furnished with proper boilers. It is an article so extremely scarce here, that I fear a deficiency of salt provision for the army in this Depart∣ment. The specimen which Mr. Kirkland mentioned to have sent me is not come to hand.</P>
<P>The information contained in No. 2 is alarming, but by a close attention to it, and pursuing proper mea∣sures, the intention of the enemy, I perceive, may be frustrated. I shall immediately send up what Mr. Kirkland recommends, as necessary to rekindle the council fire at Onondago.</P>
<P>I have Indians, more or less, every day with me, complaining of the want of cloathing, blankets especially, of which we have not one. I clearly perceive that our cause will be most essentially prejudiced, unless a large stock of Indian goods be immediately sent here. To transact business with Indians at any time is a most dis∣agreeable task, to do it with empty hands greatly encreases the difficulty.</P>

<P>A sett of monopoliners in this county have engaged such quantities of wheat, pease, corn, boards, &amp;c. that a sufficiency to support the army next campaign cannot be procured. To remedy this evil, permit me to recommend to Convention to pass a law, empowering the Deputy Quarter-Master General and his depu∣ties, and the Deputy Commissary General and his deputies, to take such articles as they may want in their several Departments, paying the usual price, or, what would be better, such a price as Convention may please to order. If Convention should think proper to invest the officers I have mentioned with such a power, I wish it to be done the soonest possible, as the season in which the articles wanted can be most easily conveyed will soon be past.</P>

<P>YOUR Excellency's favour of the 18th instant I had the honour to receive on the 28th. I cannot plead that business, altho' I am closely employed, has been the only motive that I have not latterly done myself the pleasure to write you. I well know that every moment of your time must necessarily be engrossed in those affairs, which, from your immediate situation, must claim the earliest attention. I therefore contented myself with writing to Mr. Harrison; but I fear either his or mine have miscarried, as I have not been favoured with an answer to mine of the 3d and 21st ult. I hope your Excellency has received mine of the 15th and 25th, each inclosing one to Congress.</P>
<P>Your success in the Jerseys has greatly inspirited the people in this quarter, and the situation to which you have driven the enemy, affords us the pleasing hope that we shall soon hear you have reaped fresh laurels.</P>
<P>I have not the least doubt, should General Carleton leave us unmolested this winter, which I really do not believe he will, that he will push very early in the spring, and he may come in the latter end of April. Be∣fore that time, therefore, the army ought to be at Ticonderoga. <HI>I do not think it should consist of less than</HI>
10,000 <HI>men, besides</HI> 1000 <HI>for the several pasts on the communication, and as many for Fort Schuyler and the other posts on the Mohawk river.</HI> With these I think we shall have nothing to fear, provided we are suffi∣ciently supplied with cannon, ammunition and provision.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a letter to Congress, dated Albany, <DATE>February <HI>4, 1777.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>THE distress I labour under, from the want of a supply of Indian goods, is inconceivably great. I can, with great truth, say, that not above one day in ten passes but that I have more or less of the Indians with me. At this moment I have twenty-five Mohawks, Oneidas and Onondagoes in my house, destitute of cloath∣ing, and pressing me to be relieved, and to continue the trade I opened last fall. It will be absolutely necessary that a treaty should be held with them, previous to the opening of the campaign. The enemy will, early in the spring, hold one with them at Oswego, and we must guard against, and try to counteract the ideas they will try to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them with.</P>
<P>Mr. McCarty, who was se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the Eastern States to purchase sundry articles greatly needed in this depart∣ment, has in part succeeded. Amongst other articles, he has procured between four and five tons of steel, which may suf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce. He could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any camp kettles, or tin to make them of, but inform me that
<PB N="22" REF="016142_0021_0F9B8E69B6809748"/>
forty or fifty tons of tin is in the continental stores at Boston, together with a number of blankets, cloathing, &amp;c. but that the store-keepers advised him that none could be issued without the immediate order of Congress. I wish therefore to have such order expedited. I shall, however, that we may not suffer by the delay that must necessarily take place before such order can reach Boston, immediately apply to General Ward, entreat∣ing him to prevail on the store-keepers to send part of the tin, cloathing and blankets, of which we stand in immediate need.</P>
<P>I have borrowed fifty thousand dollars from this State, and considerable sums from individuals, for the public service, all of which is already expended, and still every department is deeply indebted. I wish, therefore, that measures may be taken to hasten a supply to the military chest here.</P>
<P>Neither Colonel Baldwin, the Chief Engineer in this department, nor any of the artificers raising in the Eastern States, are as yet arrived, so that I cannot begin the necessary works at Ticonderoga, Fort George, &amp;c. as early as I intended, and as they ought to be begun.</P>
<P>As the garrison of Ticonderoga is daily weakening, and that I have no prospect of a speedy reinforcement, I shall not dare to send the cannon to that place, which are expected from Salisbury with the first sledding, but order them to be left at Fort George and Cheshire's.</P>
<P>No ammunition of any kind is yet arrived here, nor do I know where to procure it. His Excellency General Washington cannot furnish me with any from Jersey. Perhaps it might be well if I was informed where the continental magazines are, and to which of them to apply.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE bearers of this carry a belt from the Commissioners of Indian Affairs, which is to go by them to the Caghnawagas of Canada. I have written to Colonel Elmore to furnish you with-snow shoes, provisions and such other articles as you may need, to equip the party for Canada.</P>
<P>I have also ordered Colonel Elmore to furnish Mr. Spencer with one ration and a half of provisions until his wife comes up, and thence forward with three. Please to advise Mr. Spencer of this.</P>
<P>Besides what the Indians have in charge from the Commissioners, you will press them warmly to try to discover the enemy's force in Canada, distinguishing what British and what foreign troops may be there, and what number of Canadians may be engaged to serve with them. Also what Indians, and the numbers they may expect will join them. How they are supplied with provisions. Whether they mean to attack Ticonderoga in the course of the winter. If a treaty with the Six Nations is to be held, and when and where. At what place the British troops are quartered. Whether an attack by the way of the Mohawk river is intended. Whether great quantities of provisions are sent to Otswegatchie. If Quebec, or any other places in Canada, are fortifying. If any troops left Canada last fall, and how many, and at what time. Whether any forage is collecting at St. John's, or any batteaus building there or elsewhere. What price flour is now sold at in Canada. You will also request the Indians to try to prevail on some of the Caghnawagas to give intelligence of the movements of the enemy, and to assure them that every important piece of intelligence which they convey to me will be rewarded.</P>

<P>I WROTE you yesterday, but forgot to mention to you to give the Indians intended for Canada an account of the success of our arms; for altho' I have done it here, yet I wish you to repeat to them, that after the enemy had obliged our people to leave Long-Island and New-York, they attempted to get us between them and the sea, in order to cut off our supplies, but although they tried all summer to do this, they were not able to effect it. They then took a fort of ours, situate upon York Island, where we could not come to its relief, because their ships of war prevented us. As soon as they had taken this fort they marched into New-Jersey, and as most of General Washington's army was gone home, the soldiers term of enlistment being expired, he was obliged to retreat before them to Trenton; but, having collected some troops there, he fought them on the 26th of December, as is already related. On the 3d of January he pursued them, and fought them at Princeton, twelve miles on this side of Trenton. There he killed near three hundred, and took up∣wards of two hundred prisoners. He has since that taken ninety-five loaded waggons, and five empty ones, also eighty-four war horses, and upwards of two hundred prisoners. The enemy are now at Brunswick, and they cannot get away, except by flying to their vessels, because General Washington and Monsieur Fermoy, a General from Old France, and General Putnam, each with a body of troops, surround them.</P>
<P>That France has sent us 200,000 l. worth of artillery and warlike stores. Many French officers and Engi∣neers, amongst others, Monsieur Laboniere, the Engineer who built Ticonderoga last war. Write upon a bit of paper <HI>Laboniere Engineer,</HI> and let them take it with them, as he is well known by the Caghnawagas.</P>
<P>Request of Colonel Elmore as much powder and ball as the party may want.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A SNOW has happily fallen, which will greatly facilitate the transportation of the various articles that ought to be sent to Fort George and Cheshire's, for the reasons mentioned in my former orders; but as the winter season is so far advanced, that we have no reason to expect the sledding will last much longer, I must again entreat you to lose no time. The cannon from Salisbury must claim your first attention. All the en∣trenching tools already made should be forwarded without delay. Whatever provisions the Deputy Commissary General may have in store here, or elsewhere, should be immediately sent on, as also the oars, scoops, and other utensils for the batteaus on the Lakes. The forage which will be wanted should be stored as I have directed. Carpenters must, without delay, be sent up to repair the batteaus on both Lakes and at Skeensbo∣rough, together with pitch, oakum, and every necessary for the purpose. The cordage for the vessels to be built at Fort George should also be there. In short, every article in your department, that can be procured, should be sent up without the least delay; for besides the extra expence of transporting these articles in spring, when the roads are bad, you will, I fear, not be able to accomplish it with all the wheel carriages you will then be able to procure, and the probable consequences will be, that our army at Ticonderoga will be obliged to leave it, for want of the necessary supplies. You are therefore bound, by every consideration, to leave nothing undone a moment, which it is possible for you to do, that we may not experience all the evils which would consequently ensue from an evacuation of Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>Vast quantities of boards and timber will, in all probability, be wanted, as well for the army in this quar∣ter, as for that which may be stationed in the southern parts of this State. Provision should therefore be made to procure them. And as the proprietors of mills find it impossible to procure workmen to cut and draw logs, such of the fifteen companies of batteaumen and labourers now raising, and that can be first got ready, should be employed in cutting timber, and sleds procured to draw it to the mills.</P>
<P>The roads between this and Fort Edward, and from thence to Fort George and Cheshire's, also claim your early and serious attention, and timber should be drawn for causewaying where it is necessary, and for erect∣ing bridges where they may be wanted. To depend upon crossing Hudson's river at the two ferries, McNeal's and Jones's, with what scows are now there, is too precarious. At each place two good scows must therefore be immediately constructed.</P>
<P>In short, all that I have at any time ordered that you should send up, purchase or cause to be made, ought to be done with the utmost dispatch; for, if it is not, the business that will croud upon you so vastly when the campaign opens will involve you in inextricable difficulties.</P>
<P>A quantity of rum should be purchased by you for the artificers employed in your department, that you may not labour under difficulties on that account.</P>
<P>I entreat you to pay the closest attention to every part of your department, that the public may reap the advantage of your exertions, and you the honour thereof.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Honourable Continental Congress, by a resolution of the 28th December last, have ordered,
<Q>That a fort be constructed on Mount Independence; that the navigation of the Lake, near that place, be ob∣structed by cassoons, to be sunk in the water at small distances from one another, and joined together by string pieces, so as at the same time to serve for a bridge between the fortifications on the east and west
<PB N="24" REF="016142_0023_0F9B8E6CD2F2BD10"/>
sides; that to prevent the enemy from drawing their small craft over land beyond Three Mile Point into Lake George, the passage of that Lake be also obstructed in like manner by cassoons, from island to island, in the Narrows, if practicable, or by floating batteries; that Fort Stanwix be strengthened, and other fortifications be made, at proper places, near the Mohawk River; and that General Schuyler, the com∣manding officer of the Northern Department, execute these works this winter, and that the commanding officer of artillery, Chief Engineer, Quarter Master General and Commissary General, provide and per∣form whatever things in their respective departments are necessary, or may contribute to the accomplish∣ment thereof; that there be a general hospital erected at Mount Independence.</Q></P>
<P>In order, therefore, to fulfil the intentions of Congress, you are immediately to proceed to Lake George, to examine if it is practicable to sunk cassoons in the Narrows in the manner directed; and if you find it so, to report the same to me, and immediately to order one or more of your Sub-Engineers to execute the work. If it is not practicable, you will report to me, by letter, the reasons why, together with the depth of the water, and the distance from shore to shore, and from island to island. The report to be accompanied with a sketch of the islands.</P>
<P>You are then to proceed to Ticonderoga, and, as I conceive the obstructions of the Lake will be much ea∣sier and cheaper executed while the Lake continues frozen than at any other time, you will first execute that work. The cassoons should be so far above water, as that the bridge may not be under water when the Lake is at the highest, and to prevent batteaus from passing underneath, when the Lake is at the lowest, a boom ought to be laid on the water on each side of the bridge.</P>
<P>It will be necessary, the soonest you possibly can, to prepare what timber and other materials may be want∣ing for the construction of the fort on Mount Independence, and to furnish me with an actual and accurate survey of Mount Independence, and a plan of the fort you may judge should be built on it.</P>
<P>You are also to lose no time in preparing and collecting the materials for a hospital, sufficiently large to contain six hundred sick, besides the necessary apartments for the Director, and the other officers of the hospital.</P>
<P>You will also immediately send an engineer to examine and report the state of Fort Stanwix, and what works ought to be constructed there, and on his return to six on one or more proper places on this side Fort Stanwix, to erect fortifications, to prevent the enemy from coming down the river in batteaus, in case they should be able to possess themselves of Fort Stanwix, or leave it in their rear.</P>
<P>Whatever carriages you may want for drawing timber for the works on Lake George, and at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, you are to apply to Colonel Lewis, Deputy Quarter-Master General, for, who will have my orders to furnish you therewith.</P>
<P>The armourers tools, that are now at Ticonderoga, you will immediately send to Colonel Lewis, to be delivered to such person as you may direct to superintend the armoury here, and leave orders for the ar∣mourers to repair all the arms in this place, before they proceed to Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>Early provision is to be made, to have a sufficiency of battery carriages for the cannon that may be sent up, and for such as may be wanted on board any vessels to be constructed. In short, you will use your best endea∣vours to have every thing put in the best order, and what is to be executed done with the utmost expedition.</P>
<P>Carpenters always require close attention, and to be pushed to their duty; you will therefore give strict orders to all your officers to keep them closely to work.</P>
<P>You will probably be able to procure soldiers, who can work with the whip-saw. You should therefore procure as many as you possibly can, and immediately on your arrival at Ticonderoga apply for all the sawyers in any of the corps there, and set them to work. It will be best to agree by the foot, because it will be cheapest, and that you will get more work done.</P>
<P>A house to boil soap and make candles in is much wanted at Mount Independence. You will therefore construct one, and also a bake-house, as soon as you can, and repair the provision stores, that the public may not sustain so great a loss as formerly by damaged provisions.</P>

<P>THE blocks for the vessels to be constructed on Lake Champlain you will give immediate orders for mak∣ing. They may probably be procured here; if not, write to the superintendants for building the frigates at Poukeepsie to get them ready against the river opens.</P>
<P>Pray do not fail to furnish me with the return I have so long ago requested, of whatever articles, vessels, carriages, &amp;c. are now in your department, and the condition they are in, that we may know what is to be done. If your Deputies neglect giving you the necessary information, dismiss them, and appoint others that will do their duty.</P>
<P>Colonel Baldwin, the Chief Engineer, is directed to carry on very considerable works on Lake George and at Ticonderoga. You are to furnish him with as many carriages as he may want, which I believe will be considerable. Each carriage should carry twenty days provisions. Amongst the carriages should be ten sleds, drawn by oxen.</P>
<P>The Deputy Commissary General has returned three hundred barrels of flour at Skeensborough; these must be immediately forwarded to Ticonderoga; also one hundred and eighty barrels of beef, which are at Fort George, as soon as Lake George is passable, if it is not so already.</P>
<P>He also informs me that there are about one thousand barrels of beef and pork at Bennington and Lanesbo∣rough. This must also be immediately forwarded to either Cheshire's or Skeensborough, which ever may be most convenient.</P>

<P>I HAVE ordered such of the batteaumen as are already raised and mustered to cut timber for the different public works. Some thousands of logs are already brought to the public's mills at Cheshire's. Parties are gone and going to bring timber to the mill at Skeensborough, and to the other mills in the vicinity of Fort George, to mine and others on Hudson's river.

<P>Major Hoisington's corps was raised by the orders of the Convention of this State, and are not therefore at my disposition. It appears, however, necessary, that some measures should be adopted to render them useful to the public, and I shall take the earliest opportunity to write on the subject to Convention.</P>
<P>I would advise you to keep scouts towards the head of St. Francois, to watch the motions of the enemy in that quarter.</P>
<P>I shall direct the militia that have marched, in consequence of my orders of the 14th ult. to be paid their pay, billeting and marching money.</P>

<P>CARRIAGES are very much wanted at Ticonderoga. You will please to procure a number to go to that place, furnished with sodder for twenty days, or as much as you can prevail on the sleighmen to carry up.

<P>MAJOR Stevens delivered me, in the beginning of December, an estimate of what would be wanted in the artillery department. Part of the articles he has procured, and I have now sent him to wait on you for what is still deficient, his Excellency General Washington having directed that my application for ordnance and ordnance stores should be made to you. I shall, besides the articles the Major may mentions, stand in need of forty ship-guns, ten of which to carry nine pound ball, fifteen carrying six pound ball, and as many car∣rying four pound ball, with carriages, cartridges, shot, and every necessary belonging to them. These to be sent to this place or Fort George, where I wish to have them by the last of April at farthest.</P>

<P>AS the ice has now left Hudson's river, you will forward the cannon, and whatever military stores are now here, as fast as possible to Fort George, to be conveyed to Ticonderoga as soon as Lake George shall be navi∣gable.

If the batteaus at that place are not already repaired, no time should be lost in doing it. The schooner there should also be overhauled, and put into repair, without delay.</P>
<P>The ship carpenters now moving up to Fort George will require a number of carriages, to draw in the timber for the vessels they are to build. These carriages you will furnish immediately, and send one of your assistants to superintend the works at that place. The hospital there will also require repairs, and should be done immediately. Two blacksmiths must be kept at work there, and a quantity of iron sent up. If the ship nails are not already forwarded, send them on without loss of time. A company of carpenters, to con∣sist of an overseer and twenty men, must be engaged, and sent without delay to Fort Stanwix. Captain Mar∣quisie, the Engineer, who is at Schenectady, will take charge of them.</P>
<P>Fort George will probably be navigable by the first week in April. About that time therefore the work∣ing cattle, designed for Ticonderoga and the Carrying-place, should be at Fort George, to be transported without delay.</P>
<P>All the working cattle for the communication between this and Fort George and Fort Ann should also be there about the first of April.</P>
<P>Nails, pitch or tar, and oakum for the batteaus building at Saratoga, must be sent on immediately.</P>
<P>Three ploughs, and as many harrows, with the necessary apparel, must be sent to Ticonderoga, under the care of a trusty person, who understands farming and gardening, in order to prepare the earth for raising turnips and other vegetables for the use of the army. You will give orders to supply them with working cattle and men, and direct your assistants to procure a piece of land for the purpose. As soon as the ice has left Wood Creek, you are to cause it to be cleared from the old timber which obstructs its navigation.</P>
<P>The saw-mills at Wyng's and Cheshire's, Skeensborough and Ticonderoga, must be immediately set to work.</P>
<P>Thirty of the batteaus building at Saratoga must be sent to Wood Creek, to be employed between Fort Ann and Skeensborough.</P>
<P>Do not forget the ferry scows I formerly ordered to be constructed, nor the repairs to the roads.</P>
<P>At Half-Moon, Stillwater, M'Larin's, Fort Miller, Fort Edward and Cheshire's, turning cranes should be erected, to load and unload the batteaus with.

<P>YOU will call on the Assistant Deputy Quarter Master General at Schenectady, and supply yourself with what intrenching tools and other necessaries you will need for altering and strengthening Fort Schuyler. He will also furnish you with a company of carpenters, and provide batteaus to carry you, them, and such articles as you may want, to that fortress. On your arrival there, you will apply to the commanding officer for such assistance as you may need, who will have my orders to afford you all in his power. You will make the alterations agreeable to the plan you have laid before me, and to guard as much as possible against any misfortunes that might be occasioned by an attack before the alterations are compleat, you will leave as much of the present work standing, whilst the other is going on, as possible, that the garrison may be co∣vered. Perhaps it will be best to begin with one bastion and the adjacent curtains, and to compleat as much of them as possible before another is begun.</P>

<P>Fortifications are at all times expensive; they become more so, when the artificers are suffered to while away their time.

No sitting down to smoak and drink at eleven o'clock, or at any other time, except that at meals. In very hot weather, two hours may be allowed at dinner.</P>
<P>Appoint some trusty non-commissioned officer as master of the checque, and instruct him particularly in his duty. Soldiers or women must be got, to cook for the carpenters, and allowed moderate wages.</P>
<P>Inform me repeatedly how your work advances, and of what difficulties, if any, you meet with, that I may take measures to obviate them.</P>

<P>YOU will repair to Fort George without delay, and there, in conjunction with Captain Douw, Assistant Deputy Quarter Master General, employ the carpenters in constructing two strong schooners, of sixty feet keel and twenty feet beam. They should be so constructed as not to draw above six feet water, when they have all their cannon and stores on board; and as I conceive that they will be more serviceable in proportion as their guns lay near the water, I would have you give them the least height possible. Besides, three other vessels are to be built without decks. These should be so contrived, as to row fast, and to carry a cannon of twelve pound shot in the bow, and as many on each side as possible. Whatever articles you may want, and that are not to be had at Fort George, you will make timely application for to Colonel Lewis, Deputy Quarter Master General, that no time may be lost in procuring what may be wanted. You will examine the stores at that place, and see what is there, and write to Ticonderoga to know what rigging and anchors can be spared from thence, and cause them to be brought to Fort George as soon as the Lake opens.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Colonel,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I PROPOSE early to-morrow to set out on a journey to Philadelphia. You, as eldest officer, will con∣sequently command until my return, or the arrival of an officer of elder or superior rank. It is impossible to particularize the variety of affairs that will claim your attention. I shall therefore only mention such as occur to me at present.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="016142_0026_0F9B8E6F6A3E6C30"/>Colonel Wayne, and Lieutenant Colonel Van Dyck, are informed that the command devolves on you, and they have my orders to address you on whatever subject they may have occasion to write. It is impossible to foresee what demands they may make, as they must arise from exigencies that may happen. No instructions can therefore be given on that head, other than the general one, to do in every case what you shall judge most conducive to promote the service.</P>
<P>As the late hostilities committed by the enemy and their savages has already greatly alarmed the country, and prevents people from giving that assistance with their carriages which the public stands so much in need of, I have ordered reinforcements to Saratoga, Fort Edward and Fort George, that all carriages may have convoys, and the workmen at Fort George be covered by strong parties, and the magazines at those places pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected and secured. You will therefore give your orders accordingly. The reinforcements are of the troops from the Eastern States; and the disposition of your regiment and those troops I wish to be as follows: One hundred rank and file, and a sufficient number of officers, at Saratoga, who are to mount, besides the guards at the barracks, a serjeant's guard at my house, with centinels at the mills and store-house, both of which contain great quantities of valuable public stores; fifty, with like officers, at Fort Edward, and one hundred at this place; those at Fort Edward will be joined by two companies of the troops from the eastward; the remain∣der of your regiment at Fort George, to which I have also ordered three companies of the Eastern corps.</P>
<P>You will order Livingston's to march to John's-Town and Fort Dayton, and Gansevoort's to Fort Schuyler, to relieve those garrisons, the present commanding officers whereof are to deliver copies of their instructions to the officers commanding the respective reliefs. You will particularly charge the officers to be very attentive and vigilant. Those at Fort Edward and Saratoga to keep small scouting parties constantly out to the west∣ward. Colonel Wayne, and Lieutenant Colonel Van Dyck, have my orders on this head with respect to their commands.</P>
<P>A quantity of powder is arrived at Kingston, and is daily expected here, one ton whereof is to be left here, and the remainder to be forwarded to Fort George, where it is to remain until occasion shall require it to be sent on to Ticonderoga. A strong escort must attend this powder in all its route. The cannon that are still here are to be forwarded to Ticonderoga, except those carrying six pound ball and under, which are to be left at Fort George.</P>
<P>Every other kind of store that may be here, or may arrive, is to be sent on, except such cloathing as may be necessary for the troops coming in here.</P>
<P>You will please to give orders for furnishing Mr. Douw with such articles out of the public stores, as he may apply to you for, for the use of the Indians.</P>
<P>You will order a court to appraise all the uninvoiced articles in the Commissary of Cloathing's store; a copy of such appraisement, signed by the President, to be kept by you, and another to be delivered to the Com∣missary.</P>
<P>Such of Colonel Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on's regiment as may be in this department are to be sent down to General Wash∣ington, as soon as relieved from the posts they now garrison.</P>

<P>—SUCH were the preparations for this campaign, made by me prior to the 26th day of March, 1777, when I left Albany, soon after which General Gates took the command, and I trust they were such as, at least, exclude any imputation of want of vigilance or care. The Court will be pleased to observe, that in my several orders I descended to minutiae, in a manner not usual for general officers, and which nothing but the most ardent zeal for the service could have prompted.</P>
<P>The third period extends from the time I resumed the command to the evacuation of Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>On the fourth day of June, 1777, I again resumed the command of the department, and I offer the following letters and orders as evidence of the manner in which I continued to provide for the exigencies of the ensuing campaign, and for the general defence of the whole department.</P>
<P>I arrived at Albany on the third day of June, and the next day wrote the following letter to Major General Gates.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will please to repair to Ticonderoga with all convenient speed, and take the command of the troops at that place.</P>
<P>As the whole of our force in the Northern Department, if collected at Ticonderoga, would not be capa∣ble of properly meaning the extensive works on both sides of the Lake, and as Mount Independence is by much the most defensible, and may be made a post capable of sustaining a long and vigorous siege, it is my intention that your first care should be to bestow the utmost attention to fortifying the Mount. You will therefore please, immediately on your arrival, to give directions for erecting the necessary fortifications, and employ all the troops that can be spared from other duty and necessary works in that business. If the obstruc∣tion between the French redoubt and Mount Independence is not compleated, that work will also claim your immediate attention, and I wish that strong piles should be drove in the intervals between every cassoon, and others in the front of each cassoon, and if possible a line of pickets drove across the channel, so far below Mount Independence, as that the cannon from thence may render it impossible for the enemy's vessels to lay there, or be employed in removing the obstructions. This seems to be work in the execution of which no time should be lost, as it may, by preventing the enemy's ships from passing, enable us to keep up the commu∣nication with our vessels, if the Mount should be invested.</P>
<P>I wish you to keep scouting parties constantly out on both sides of the Lake. That on the west should go as far as the road by which the Tories last fall marched to Crown-Point.</P>
<P>Be so good as to order returns to be made immediately by the Chief Engineer, Commanding Officer of Ar∣tillery, Commissary of Provisions, and Clothier, of every article in their respective departments, and of what is wanting in each, that the deficiency may be procured without delay.</P>
<P>Inclose you a credit on the military chest for Ten Thousand Dollars, to pay any contingent expences that may arise, and not payable by any of the civil departments.</P>
<P>I am confident that no officer is more deeply impressed with the necessity of preserving the health of the men than you, and I doubt not but you will bestow much of your attention on so capital a matter. Tents are arrived here, and orders are given to send up five hundred. If more are wanted, you will please to signify it to me.</P>
<P>You will please to send me a return of the troops at Ticonderoga, as soon after your arrival as you possibly can.</P>
<P>You will lay in a magazine of fire wood on Mount Independence, to be preserved in case of a siege, and to be as sparing of the salt meat as you possibly can, consistent with the health of the men.</P>
<P>As an arrangement of the troops into brigades cannot so properly be made here as at Ticonderoga, and it being probable that I shall not be able to repair to that place until towards the end of the month, you will please, consulting with the other general officers, to brigade them, putting the militia into one by themselves.</P>
<P>You will give directions that no considerable quantity of provision, or other military stores, are at any time left on the carrying place at the north end of Lake George.</P>
<P>As the health of the troops is very much injured by an improper mode of dressing their victuals, I wish you to order an officer of every company daily to superintend that business; and as I conceive it would be for the benefit of the troops to be furnished with kettles sufficiently large to cook for a whole company, I have or∣dered the Deputy Quarter Master General to send twenty to Ticonderoga for that purpose.</P>
<P>Please to cause a survey to be made of the salted meat. I apprehend much of it will require to be repacked and well brined.</P>
<P>I shall be extremely happy frequently to be favoured with a line from you.</P>

<P>BY the Deputy Commissary General's return, I find there is a considerable quantity of flour, 213 barrels of pork, 582 barrels of beef, and near 600 bushels of pease, at Fort George. You will immediately cause the same to be conveyed to Ticonderoga, except 100 barrels of flour, 50 barrels of pork, 50 barrels of beef, and 50 bushels of pease. You will send 32 of the small batteaus into Lake George, 30 of which to be con∣veyed into Lake Champlain, from thence into Wood Creek. The large batteaus now in Wood Creek to be carried below the Falls, and well secured. The quantity of provision at Fort Schuyler is very inadequate. You will therefore take measures, without delay, to convey to that garrison whatever supply the Deputy Commissary General can furnish, and you will call upon him to know what that is.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="016142_0028_0F9B8E70F5ADAB30"/>If you have not already you will immediately procure four fishing nets, one to be sent to Fort George, and three to Ticonderoga. Five hundred of the tents which arrived yesterday to be immediately sent to Ticon∣deroga. You will also purchase twenty pot-ash kettles, to be sent to Ticonderoga. A number of bricks will be wanted at Ticonderoga, Fort George and Saratoga; you will therefore take measures, the soonest possible, to get them made. Fort Edward may be supplied with this article from Fort George in returning carriages. Skeensborough and Fort Ann may be supplied in returning batteaus from Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>You will also give directions for burning lime at Ticonderoga, Fort George and Saratoga, for the use of the works there, and the places mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</P>
<P>If no bricks are to be purchased in this place, you will also cause fifty thousand to be made here, and lay in a quantity of lime, which may be procured in the vicinity of Poukeep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e.</P>
<P>The immoderate expence, arising from the high price of fire wood in the fall of the year, renders it indis∣pensibly necessary that a large stock should be laid up in the course of the summer. You will therefore take immediate measures to procure a sufficient supply. Continue to employ the blacksmiths in making entrench∣ing tools, when they are not employed in any business that requires immediate dispatch.</P>

<P>I PERCEIVE by your return, that the quantity of provisions at Fort Schuyler is very inadequate; you will therefore immediately take measures for procuring such a quantity of salted meat, and every other species wanted, that two months provision may be always in store at that garrison. You will also take care that the troops at that and every other post in this department be well supplied with soap, vinegar, and such vegetables as you may be able to procure. As I wish that as little of the salted meat should be expended as possible, you will take immediate measures to supply the troops with fresh beef, and you will order all the salted beef and pork at Bennington, or elsewhere to the eastward, to be immediately brought to Hudson's River, and from time to time to advise the Deputy Quarter Master General of its arrival.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour to advise you that I arrived here on Tuesday, the third instant, and found an account, which I received on my way up, that the enemy were approaching Ticonderoga, to be without foundation.</P>
<P>Inclose you, Sir, a return of the troops at Ticonderoga and this place. As soon as I procure those from the other posts I shall make out a general return, and do myself the honour to transmit copies to you and his Excellency General Washington.</P>
<P>You will perceive by the return of the Commissary of Provisions, which I also inclose, that only 337 bar∣rels of the meat kind have been forwarded to Ticonderoga since the 26th of March, and no fresh beef, so that the stock of salted provisions since that time is considerably diminished, nor is there any considerable quantity provided in the country. I have therefore directed the Commissary to forward an immediate supply of fresh beef, that as much of the salted beef and pork may be saved as possible, in order to have a stock on hand, in case the enemy should be able so to interrupt the communication as to prevent cattle being sent on.</P>
<P>Inclose you copy of the instructions I have given General St. Clair. I have directed that Mount Inde∣pendence should be the primary object of attention. 1<HI>st.</HI> Because, if even the lines on the west side should be perfectly compleated, it will not be in our power to man them properly with the whole force destined for this department, if it could be all collected at Ticonderoga, which it cannot, for the several posts on the Mohawk river, and those on the communication between this and Ticonderoga, will take at least two thousand men. I have in view the drawing part of the army to this side of the Lake.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Because I think it rather imprudent that the greater part of our army should occupy a post, which if the enemy should be able so to invest as to cut off the communication with the country on this side, we might possibly experience a disaster similar to that at Fort Washington.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> Because I am fully convinced that between two and three thousand men can effectually maintain Mount Independence, and secure the pass.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> If the whole army was at Mount Independence, it is possible that a want of provision might oblige us to abandon that important post.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly.</HI> If the enemy should attempt to draw their boats over land into Lake George, from beyond the Three Mile Point, our naval strength on Lake George will prevent their progress; and if it did not, we should have a body of troops to oppose them with.</P>

also to induce to this disposition of the army, if it can be done without danger, which I am fully of opinion it may, and will certainly be so, if General Carleton sent part of his troops from Canada to New-York or elsewhere.</P>

<P>YOU will please, without delay, minutely to inform me what advances are made in fortifying Fort Schuy∣ler, and also how that work is conducted. I am advised that all the oeconomy is not made use of that ought to be, and that the Engineer employs a greater number of carriages than are necessary. Pray be very par∣ticular in your report on this head. You will make me an exact return of the troops that compose your garri∣son, and of the artificers and others employed about the works, and to do this monthly. You will keep up a friendly intercourse with the Indians, and suffer no speeches to be made to them by Captain Marquisie, or any other person not employed in the Indian Department; and when you have occasion to speak to them, let your speech be written, and a copy transmitted to me, that the Commissioners may be informed of every transaction with those people. You will be very careful and attentive to preserving the health of your garrison, and to their discipline. Let an officer daily inspect into the cooking, and see that the utensils be kept clean. Another to see that their quarters are kept sweet and clean, and their bedding frequently aired. Suffer no officer, non-commissioned officer or private, to use any bedding or blankets when on guard, and oblige the officers always to remain with their guards; not must your Adjutant bring any person to the parade for guard, whose hair is not powdered, his person perfectly clean, his clothes in good order, his arms bright, and accoutrements in compleat order. I wish your closest attention to those particulars, and doubt not but you will give it, as it will redound to your credit to introduce good order and discipline into the corps you have the honour to command.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SENT you an account of the situation of the people at Unadilla the 10th of this instant, and have now an opportunity fully to acquaint you of the matter, as Mr. Johnson of Unadilla has given me a full detail of it, which is as follows: That Joseph Brandt came to Oui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quago, hoisted the British flag, and then proceeded to Unadilla with his party, which consisted of more than one hundred men. Before he made his appearance in Unadilla himself, he sent one William Johnson, half brother to Sir John Johnson, with several other Indians, to acquaint the people that he was coming with his party, and that they should not be afraid, as he said he would be peaceable as vet. When Brandt arrived with his men, he marched to one McGinnis, who is a noted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and sent for Mr. Johnson, the Minister, and Captain Johnson, his son, who went immediately to him. He asked the old gentleman several questions concerning using his friends ill, as they were a free people, who answered that his friends had been used with all the civility of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> people. Brandt replied that he and his party were for the King, and that he did not think proper to fall out for every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but as he had a large party, and wanted provision for them, if the people would let him have it, he would pay for it, letting them know at the same time that he would have it at any rate; and after getting cattle, sheep and swine, and other provisions, he told the people that Butler would be along soon, and pay for what he had taken from them; that he then appeared there in a warlike manner, and intended to bring off his people in spite of every opposition; and further said, there would be great trouble there soon. When Brandt and his party were about returning to Onioquago, be desired McGinnis to let the boards he had furnished them with for c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mps remain as they were until he returned, which would be in a few days, in order to bring his friends from the Mohawk river. It is uncertain when he will return, but he is expected every hour. The tories, who have joined him, say they are not afraid of the American troops now. They have made a road from the Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quehanna to the De∣laware, in order, as we suppose, that the tories from Kattskill and elsewhere may join them. Thus, Gentlemen of the Committee, and Commanders of the militia, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid the matter before you, and assure myself you will do every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce of the frontiers.

</LETTER></NOTE>

Having had some intimation before I left Albany, that Joseph Brandt had drove off some cattle from the western frontiers of this State, and threatened the inhabitants, I dispatched a message to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neidas on that subject. I have this day sent them a second message, couched in such firm, but, I hope, prudent terms, that I expect it will have the desired effect, and that we shall have no farther trouble from that fellow and his associates. Lest, however, I should be mistaken in my con∣jectures, I have ordered Colonel Van Schaick into that quarter with 150 men, to protect the inhabitants, and have directed him in the line of conduct he is to hold, which is to be such as not to give umbrage to our Indian allies.</P>
<P>At twelve I received an express from General St. Clair, copies of his letters No. 3 and 4, with copy of the letter to General Sullivan No. 5, and of the pass to Amsbury No. 6, I herewith transmit.</P>
<P>Considering the extensiveness of our works at Ticonderoga, the smallness of the garrison is alarming; but I hope that, by confining our whole attention to Mount Independence, we shall be able to hold that pass against any effort of the enemy.</P>
<P>Though chagrined, I am not discouraged by the variety of difficulties that present themselves; because I am confident that by steady exertions and perseverance we shall surmount them, and hope that the enemy will find that we shall be able to prevent them from penetrating the country, should they attempt it, which I believe they will not do, even if they should (contrary to my expectations) be able to possess themselves of Ticonderoga, unless General Howe should penetrate up Hudson's river. I have already dispatched an express to the States of Massachusetts, and New-Hampshire, to hasten on the remainder of their troops, and have given the most pointed orders to the Deputy Commissary and Quarter Master General to furnish what is ne∣cessary in their respective departments, and as soon as I have brought matters in some train at Ticonderoga, and the communication above this, I shall hasten back to push on the necessaries, and regulate affairs on the Western Communication, where also much disorder prevails.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to enclose this under flying seal to his Excellency the Commander in Chief, as I cannot find time to do myself the honour to give Congress and him a separate detail of what I have written.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour to inclose your Excellency a letter to Congress under flying seal. The variety of affairs which claim my attention, do not permit me time to communicate to your Excellency and Congress, separately, such information as it may be necessary both should know. You will therefore please to excuse the mode I take.</P>
<P>Our numbers are so few to the northward, and we have so little prospect of their encreasing, that, should a disaster befal us at Ticonderoga, we should have very few troops indeed to oppose, if the enemy should make an attempt to penetrate the country. I shall probably be under the necessity of calling for assistance from Peek's-Kill. Perhaps your Excellency may think proper to lodge an order with the commanding officer to comply with my requisition (if I should make one) ascertaining the number you may think proper to spare. Be assured that I shall not ask any aid as long as there is a possibility of doing without.</P>
<P>Your letter of the 11th of May to General Gates was this day delivered me by Brigadier General Learned. The cloathing for Colonel Shepherd's regiment, if at Ticonderoga, will be immediately sent down.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment received dispatches from General St. Clair, who is at Ticonderoga, advising me that by intelligence from Canada a body of the enemy may be expected in a very little while, and another on the Mohawk river; that the militia from New-Hampshire are gone home; that the troops at Ticonderoga do not amount to more than two thousand two hundred men, sick included; that all the regiments are greatly deficient in numbers. Let me entreat you, Sir, to spare no exertions to hasten on the troops from your State. Such as can conveniently come by the way of Albany to do it. Every moment's delay is attended with dan∣ger, and may perhaps prove fatal to us.</P>

<P>I BELIEVE the absurdity, as well as impossibility, of attempting to maintain the extensive lines at Ti∣conderoga, will appear in a striking point of view (if attention is paid to General St. Clair's letter) as well as the propriety of drawing so much of our force to this side of the Lake, as to leave only a sufficient garrison for Mount Independence. If Sir John Johnson attempts to fall on the Mohawk river, and takes his route from Crown-Point, and we have troops on this side of the lake, I propose to let him pass, and fall in his rear, while he is opposed in front by what force we may be able to collect on the Mohawk River, and by thus getting him between two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>res we shall probably give a good account of him.</P>

<P>I HAVE ordered a detachment of about one hundred men, under the command of Captain Wiley, now at Stillwater, immediately to march to Albany, there to obey such orders as you shall give. On your arrival at Albany, you will apply to Colonel Tupper for such a detachment of his and Colonel Wesson's regiment as to make up one hundred and fifty, exclusive of commissioned officers. Major Badlam to be one of the officers.</P>
<P>With these, taking twenty days provisions, and a sufficiency of ammunition, you will immediately march <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cherry Valley, desiring the Committee of Tryon county to meet you on the way to that place, of whom you will enquire what place will be most eligible to post the troops in, so as best to defend the inhabitants from any insults which may be offered by Joseph Brandt and his party, or any others. You will give strict orders that no insult is offered to any Indian whatever, unless the troops are absolutely attacked, in which case force is to be repelled by force; nor are any of the troops to go beyond the line of patented lands, unless it be in pursuit of Brandt and his party, should he kill or captivate any of the inhabitants. Whatever Indians come to any of your posts are to be treated kindly, and some provisions given them.</P>
<P>You will apply to the Commissary for a barrel of rum, that you may be enabled to treat the Indians occa∣sionally.</P>
<P>I have sent one message to Oneida, and inclose another, which you will send from Albany by express. Should you not meet any of the Ochquagues on your way to Cherry Valley, I wish you to send off a trusty person, inviting some of their Chiefs to an interview. When they arrive, urge the necessity of preserving the covenant they have made with us. Conjure them not to suffer Brandt, or any other, to disturb the path of peace. Inform them that you have orders not to cross the line, unless it be in pursuit of Brandt, or others that may kill or captivate our people. Remark, that I have sent two messages to them by the way of Fort Schuyler; that all the Six Nations are to meet the Commissioners on the 15th of next month; that I hope we shall meet, as at every former meeting, in love and friendship, and that we shall part perfectly satisfied with each other. Dwell on the little prospect there is of the English maintaining so much as one foot of pos∣session on the continent of America; that we are daily gaining strength, they weakening; and whatever else your prudence, on which I greatly rely, may suggest.

<P>BY letters this moment received from General St. Clair, I am advised that there is only seven weeks pro∣visions at Ticonderoga. I am also informed that there is no more at Fort George, than what is barely neces∣sary for the daily consumption of the garrison. If the orders I gave you early last winter had been complied with, we should not have laboured under the present distress. If my memory serves me (for I have not my books with me) I directed you to lay in provisions at Ticonderoga, to support a garrison of three thousand men to the first of April, besides eight months provisions for five thousand men at Fort George, Fort Ann and Skeensborough, and a like quantity at Albany.</P>
<P>I charge you in the most positive manner to hasten what salted beef and pork you may have to Albany, or to any of the posts on Hudson's river, between Albany and Fort Edward, and to procure as many fat cattle as possible, and to cause them to be drove to Ticonderoga without delay. If we are obliged to abandon Ticonderoga for want of provisions, I leave you to judge of the consequences to yourself. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>I DID myself the honour to address you from Saratoga on the 14th instant. On the next day Amsbury and Adams (mentioned in General St. Clair's letter, copy whereof I transmitted Congress by letter under cover to your Excellency) arrived at Saratoga. What passed between us, and what information he gave, is noted in the paper, No. 1. No. 2 is the letter which was inclosed between the two bottoms of the canteen.</P>
<P>If the information which Amsbury gives is to be relied upon, as I think it is, we shall soon be attacked at Ticonderoga; and, although I think the forces now there may be sufficient to hold that important post, I have no troops to oppose either Sir John Johnson, if he should penetrate to the Mohawk river, or any to prevent the communication between this and Fort George from being cut off, nor have I force, if these should not be attempted by the enemy, to march to the relief of Ticonderoga. In this situation, I am under the necessity of applying to your Excellency for a reinforcement.</P>

And that you may not be obstructed in the execution of this order, an officer and a party of men will attend you, to aid you in the same; in doing of which, you are to pay strict attention that no unnecessary violence or insult be offered to any person whatever, and cautiously avoid all partiality.</P>

<P>I ARRIVED here yesterday afternoon, and am now busied in arranging matters a little, that stores may be forwarded with more regularity than heretofore.</P>
<P>In a day or two you will receive all the pork and salted beef now at this post, fifty barrels only excepted. Eighteen barrels are only come from Albany since March last.</P>
<P>When the pork and other articles are sent on, the flour will come in the large schooner only, until you can have more time and spare cattle to transport it from the landing to the saw-mills.</P>
<P>Seven barrels of tar go over to-day, and two tons of iron, with all the tents that are arrived here, together with four boxes of axes, and about three hundred bushels of pease, and about twenty new batteaus. These should be carried across the soonest possible, and not suffered to be used. The remainder will come on from day to day.</P>
<P>Pray oblige me with your commands for whatever you may need for a public or private use.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 17th instant I arrived at Ticonderoga, where I found General St. Clair, and the other General Officers, assidno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly employed in the necessary works. I soon found that much was to be done, and, after having informed myself of the state of the fortifications, stores, &amp;c. I thought it necessary to convene a Coun∣cil of the General Officers, and laid before them the propositions contained in the paper No. 1, which being taken into their consideration, we came to the resolutions noted in the same paper.</P>
<P>I was in hopes to have found the post in a better state of defence than it is, and the works for obstructing the passage to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into the rear of our fortifications compleated, or, at the very least, considerably more advanced than it unhappily is. That matters have not been carried on with more dispatch is in a great measure to be imputed to the late arrival of any troops, who could be brought to work with spirit, that the artificers did not come by the time they were ordered, and to a want of working cattle. The latter I have already supplied, and I have sent on an additional number of carpenters, so that the business will now go on in better train, and I hope with much more spirit, and trust we shall still be able to put every thing in such order as to give the enemy a good reception, and, I hope, a repulse, should they attempt a real attack, which I conjecture will not be soon, if at all, although <HI>I expect they</HI> will approach with their fleet, to keep us in alarm, and to draw our attention from other quarters where they may meditate a real attack.</P>
<P>I left Ticonderoga on Sunday evening, and arrived at Fort George on Monday afternoon; and having, previous to my crossing the lake, taken measures to bring on a supply of provisions, I had the happiness to send on from Fort George between three and four hundred barrels of beef and pork, so that we have now near sixty days provisions of the meat kind at Ticonderoga, and flour for near double that time, also at least fifteen hundred barrels now at Fort Edward and Fort George, which will all be at the latter place by the end of this month. A small quantity of beef and pork is besides on the way up; but, lest this should still be an insufficient quantity in case of a siege, and that the salted meat may be husbanded as much as possible, I have sent Commissary Yancey with a small party into the interior part of the country to bring up fat cattle; of which, I am informed, there is a considerable number, chiefly in the hands of persons who have purchased them to get our paper currency out of their hands. The orders I have given to procure them (copy whereof, No. 2, I do myself the honour to transmit) will, if carried into execution, certainly infringe on the civil rights of the inhabitants; but, considering the necessity of the case, and what kind of people will be most affected by them, I hope I shall stand excused for this stretch of power. I expect the supply will be speedy; if so, it will eradicate every anxiety on the score of provisions, at least until our numbers considerably encrease.</P>
<P>I was very disagreeably disappointed to find the troops of Ticonderoga so miserably clad and armed, and nothing in store for them. Many are literally barefooted, and most of them ragged. It is not possible to procure some cloathing, arms and blankets? Many are also destitute of the latter.</P>
<P>The tents I sent from Philadelphia came in good time, as there was hardly shelter for what troops we have, and that very indifferent.</P>
<P>I have ordered all such sick as are not likely to recover soon to be conveyed to Fort George in covered boats, which are made for the purpose. If it had been equally proper to have suffered them to remain, and that they could have been as well provided with vegetables, yet necessity would have justified it, as not one single room in the hospital is yet finished, nor will it soon be in a condition to receive a considerable number of sick.</P>
<P>The corps of artillery not affording even one man to a gun, I have drafted two hundred from the different regiments, but was under the necessity to promise such additional pay as to make it equal to that of the artillery corps, which I hope will meet the approbation of Congress.</P>
<P>One of the schooners at Lake George is launched: She is to carry fourteen guns. Another will be in the lake by the first of next month, and the timber for the gallies is hauled to the spot where they are to be built. But the rigging which I ordered up in the winter is not all arrived, nor have we a sufficient number of guns for these vessels. I trust, however, I shall still be able to procure both in time.</P>

<P>The inclosed letter and papers to Congress will advise your Excellency of the state of affairs in this de∣partment. Since writing my letter to Congress, I have received one from General St. Clair, copy whereof I do myself the honour to enclose. If the enemy's object is not to attack Ticonderoga, I suspect their move∣ment is intended to cover an attempt on New-Hampshire, the Mohawk river, or to cut off the communication between Fort George and Fort Edward, or perhaps all three, the more to distract us and divide our force, by drawing our attention to so many different quarters. I wish the reinforcement the General Officers at Ticonderoga advised me to apply to your Excellency for may be sent the soonest possible. The garrison, of Fort George is much too weak, and I have not a man to send there, or to make any opposition in Tryon county.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear General,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of the 24th was delivered me last evening. If the enemy should not mean a serious attack on your post, their movement is probably calculated to cover an attempt on New Hampshire, the Mohawk river, or to cut off the communication between Fort George and Fort Edward, or perhaps all three. I wish you therefore to keep a small scout on the east side of the lake, near the road leading from St. John's to New Hampshire, and others as far west as the road leading to the north branch of Hudson's river.</P>
<P>I have dispatched an express to Congress and General Washington, and have entreated the latter to afford as a reinforcement. Pray let nothing be left at the landing, and the batteaus be brought over as soon as possible, that your retreat may not be cut off, should you be unable to maintain your post. I cannot learn that any troops are arrived at Albany. I shall hasten to that place to forward on whatever I can, and to be in the way to bring up the militia, if necessary. God bless you, and believe me, &amp;c.</P>

<P>YOUR Excellency's favour of the 20th instant I had the honour to receive, at Saratoga, in the evening of the 26th.</P>
<P>I am this moment favoured with a letter of the 25th instant from General St. Clair, copy whereof I here∣with transmit. Should an accident happen to the garrison of Ticonderoga, and General Burgoyne make a push to gain the south part of the lake, I know of no obstacle to prevent him, as, comparatively speaking, I have not a man to oppose him. The whole number at the different posts at and on this side of the lake, including the garrison of Fort George and Skeensborough, not exceeding seven hundred men, and these I can∣not draw away from their several stations, in every one of which they are already much too weak. It is there∣fore highly necessary that a strong reinforcement should without delay be sent me. If the sloops are not yet sent to bring the troops your Excellency has ordered to be kept in readiness at Peeks-kill, I shall push them off without delay.</P>
<P>As it is not probable that we shall in time be supplied with field pieces from the eastward, I must entreat that the reinforcement may bring some up with them.</P>
<P>I have this moment also received a letter from Mr. Deane, the Indian Interpreter, extract whereof I inclose you.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Copy of a letter from James Deane, Interpreter, to Major General Schuyler, dated Albany, June <HI>25, 1777.</HI></NOTE> As the information tallies exactly with what I had before, it leads me to conclude that an irruption will be made from the westward.</P>
<P>I shall apply for the aid of the militia of this and the neighbouring States, but I fear it will not be very powerful, as many must necessarily be left at home.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I have received another letter from General St. Clair, copy whereof is inclosed. I am in pain about Fort George, but have no troops to throw in, and some time will necessarily elapse before the militia can be got to march.</P>

<P>YOUR favours of the 12th and 14th instant found me at Fort Schuyler the 17th, busy in sitting out Thomas and his party to Kaghnawaga. On the morning of the 18th he sat out, with a party of five others, and expected to re∣turn in thirty days. He will come in at Fort Schuyler, as he thinks it rather unsafe to come directly to Ticonderoga from Canada, lest our scouts should mistake him for a party of the enemy. I thought it best that Thomas should take five or six in company, that, should be make any important discovery upon his way to Kaghnawaga, he might imme∣diately detach one or two of his party to give your Honour the speed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st intelligence. Directly after having dispatch∣ed Thomas and his party, I repaired to Oneida, called a meeting, and delivered your speeches as directed. The Oneidas were of opinion that it would be to no purpose for them to send a message to Brandt, as he has long since publicly declared that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would never regard any thing they should say to him. They have, however, in consequence of your Honour's message, dispatched a party to Omoquago, to prevent their people at that place from joining Brandt's party. Also at the same time sent an express to the Onondagoes, Cayugas and Senecas, conjuring them in the strongest terms immediately to recal their people from Oni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quago. Mr. Spencer, with a guard of the One<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣das, is gone forward through the Six Nations. I apprehend they will not be able to meet the Commissioners by the time appointed, by reason of a Congress they are soon to hold among themselves at Onondago, where they expect a deputation of ten men from the Cherokee Nations. I have ventured to direct the Onondagoes to invite them down to the treaty of this place. By an Indian, some time since from Canada, it is reported that just before he left that country the warriors of Aghg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sane, who took a party of our people at Sabbath Day Point, fell in with a considera∣ble number of Scots in the woods, on their way to Canada, whom they attacked and entirely cut off, supposing them to have been a party from the American Army; that Sir John Johnson threatened to be revenged upon them, but that the Indians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him to do his utmost: that Montreal is full of regular troops, &amp;c. And by two others very lately from Canada, it is reported that Sir John Johnson would be at Oswego with a large body of Indians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the first of July, where he would be joined by Butler and his party from Niagara, from whence they were to attack Fort Schuyler; and that the regular troops were at the same time to make an attack upon Ticonderoga.</P>

<P>BY the inclosed, which I left under flying seal for the perusal of the Council of Safety, you will perceive that the enemy are arrived at Crown Point. Whether their intentions are only to make a feint to draw our attention, or a real attack, is still doubtful; but as General St. Clair wishes to have the militia up, I shall apply to General Ten Broeck for half of the militia under his command. They may be insufficient, even with what may come from the neighbouring States, to make effectual opposition, if a disaster should befal us at Ticonderoga. I wish therefore, if possible, to have some from the northern parts of Dutchess and Ulster counties, and desire General Herkimer to keep that of Tryon county in readiness to march at a moment's warning.</P>

<P>You will perceive our situation to the northward.

<P>SINCE the letter which I shewed you this morning, I have received another from General St. Clair, advising me that a large party of the enemy had gone up Otter Creek, in order to cut off the communication by Skeensborough, and that another strong body had marched on the west side of the lake to cut off Fort George. It is therefore necessary that one half of the militia under your command should immediately march, with orders to rendezvous at Fort Edward, where I shall be with what continental troops I can collect. Pray urge those nearest Fort Edward to repair thither, without waiting for others to come up, as a considerable quantity of provisions lie at that post, and which may be in danger of being lost, should the enemy make an attempt on that post.</P>

<P>BY two letters this day received, and within two hours of each other, from General St. Clair, one of the 25th instant, and another of the 26th, I am advised that the enemy's fleet and army are advanced as far as Crown Point; that a very strong party is gone by the way of Otter Creek, to fall in between Ticonderoga and Skeensborough, and that another detachment is marched on the west side of Lake George, in order, if possible, to cut off Fort George.</P>
<P>As all the continental troops on this side of the lakes occupy the several posts, and as they do not exceed seven hundred men, a number too weak even for the posts they occupy, I cannot make any opposition until the militia come up.

<P>YOU have doubtless been informed by General St. Clair that a body of the enemy is marched on the west side of Lake George, with an intention to attack your post. You will therefore put yourself in the best posture of defence you possibly can. Let a quantity of provision be immediately put into the Fort, and as much water as you can possibly collect. Employ all hands to throw up lines from the Fort towards the spot where the Regimental Hospital was to be built, and continue them from thence on the brow of the hill to the Guardhouse. Also threw up a breastwork from the east side of the fort to the precipice by the low land. This, with the assistance of the guns from the vessels, will render you perfectly secure. I have the fullest confidence that the post will be defended to the last. I shall hasten up to your relief as soon as I can collect any body of troops. Send a trusty officer with my letter to General St. Clair, and if, on his arrival near the north end of the lake, he apprehends danger on the carrying place, direct him to land about four miles on this side, on the east side of the lake, and cross the mountains, so as to strike the lake opposite Ticonderoga.

Please to let me know if any of the beef or pork, which is lately come directly to this place, was damaged or not. You will also let me know what fat cattle have been sent to the different posts since the first of April.</P>

<Q>I have supplied the main army, and the command at Peek's-Kill, with one hundred and fifty head of fat cattle <HI>per</HI> week, for three weeks past from New-England, and not gone into the limits allotted for the supply of the North∣ern Department with that article.

<P>As no such supply has been sent on, nor any that I know of since my return from Philadelphia, you will please to inform me of the reasons, if you have any other than that which you gave me before I went to Ti∣conderoga, that they could not be procured, as there were no grass fed cattle in the country fit for the knife.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received your letter, in answer to mine of yesterday. I believe the difficulty of procuring cattle at present, is very great, but a sufficient stock of provisions might have been laid in, if the orders I gave on
<PB N="38" REF="016142_0037_0F9B8E76E63FDAD8"/>
the 6th of November last had been complied with; for it was on that day that I wrote the Commissary General on the subject, the receipt of which letter he acknowledged.</P>
<P>You labour under a mistake, when you assert that there was not sufficient sledding to carry up the provisions. If there had been ten times the quantity, it might have been sent to Fort George and Cheshire's; for you can∣not but remember that crouds of sleds offered daily; that many returned from hence home without a loading; that no provision was left in the stores here. Indeed, many of the sledmen complained personally to me, that they had come to ride, and could get no loading. It is true, that the military chest was not sufficiently sup∣plied to answer every demand; but, if my memory fails not, you had a sufficiency to have laid in a stock considerably beyond what is. I confess that it would be mortifying to any person to have the frowns and censures of his superior officer, when he is sensible he has done his duty. But I should be glad to know in what instances you have had my frowns. All my letters to you point out to you the reverse. They give you wholesome advice, and direct you what might be proper to do. That the army is so well supplied with flour you know is, in a great measure, owing to the hints I gave you. That you procured barrels for that flour was in consequence of a plan I struck out for you. I wish you therefore, nay, I insist upon your pointing out in what instance you have not been supported by me, whenever you required my support. I believe you will not be able to adduce one. I promised you my countenance when you came into the office, and you have had it. If I had wished that another should have enjoyed it, I might probably have had it in my power to have obtained it; but, suspicious as you are, I will still be candid. I declare that I believe you took such measures as you thought best to procure a sufficient stock of provision. I believe your Agents have greatly deceived you. I believe they made returns of larger quantities than they were possessed of. I do not believe that you would have returned so large a quantity to me as you did on the 13th of March, if you had not been deceived; but you ought not to have been deceived. It was faulty in you to be so, and of that I have great reason to complain. The militia are ordered up, and a body of continental troops are expected from Peek's-Kill. I suppose we shall have six or seven thousand additional men to feed. You must therefore strain every nerve to procure a supply of provisions. If you want money, send to me for a warrant. Coopers are greatly wanted, both of Fort George and Fort Edward, you should send one to each post.</P>

<P>YOUR favour of the 28th instant I received last night. The militia are moving up with the continental troops, and this day I expect another body from Peek's-Kill, with which I propose to move without a mo∣ment's delay.</P>
<P>By all accounts, the enemy have had a most severe drubbing. They did not retreat, but fled from Bruns∣wick to Amboy, where they took shelter in their lines. I am not yet truly informed of the number of pri∣soners and killed. Report makes their loss greater than I can credit, nearly equal to their whole force; but that cannot be, if they were able to maintain their lines at Amboy for an hour.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received further information that a body of the enemy are on their march to Tryon county, by the way of Oswego, and have desired General Herkimer to hold the militia in readiness to march to the sup∣port of Fort Schuyler.</P>
<P>I am very apprehensive that, should a disaster befal the garrison of Ticonderoga, the enemy might possess themselves of Fort George before we can be in force to make opposition. I wish therefore, most heartily, for the assistance of the Council of Safety in forwarding on the militia. A Committee from that respectable body might afford us very material assistance. Perhaps it would tend much to inspirit the people, if all the State prisoners, except such as were under sentence of death, were removed from this city.</P>
<P>Inclose you copy of a letter which I received last night from General St. Clair. I have sent a greater num∣ber of sloops down, than I believe will be necessary to transport what troops will be afforded me from Peek's-Kill. Some of the sloops will probably be near Esopus to-day. If the militia from Ulster are to come up, six of the sloops may be taken for their use.</P>

<P>I AM just now informed by a person from Tryon county, that the enemy are actually got to Oswego with a considerable body, to make an attack on Fort Schuyler; that I shall have authentic information this day. The garrison is weak, and but poorly supplied with cannon. I have requested General Herkimer to keep his militia in readiness to march to their support. I have as yet only been able to march Colonel Bailey's regi∣ment, consisting of two hundred and fifty-five rank and file, half of it to reinforce Fort George, and the other half Fort Edward. None of the militia are yet moved.</P>
<P>Should our troops at Ticonderoga fall into the enemy's hands, I fear they will be able to march where they please, unless a greater force is sent me than what your Excellency at first intended.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM favoured with your letter of the 20th June, which came to hand on my arrival at this place from Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>The enemy have opened the campaign in every quarter in this department. By a letter from General St. Clair, of the 28th ult. their main body and fleet were still at Crown Point, where they had been some days, and from whence they have sent strong parties to interrupt the communication. If we had a sufficient number of troops at that post, I should not be in pain for the event if they made a serious attack; but our numbers are considerably below half what they ought to be. I am waiting with impatience for the mi∣litia, and for a reinforcement from Peek's-Kill, which is expected in a day or two to move up, either to give assistance to the garrison, or to cover its retreat, should such an event unhappily take place. An incursion on the Mohawk river is also momently expected. Some scalping parties have already made their appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="016142_0038_0F9B8E77A70F7F18"/>As the distress this part of the country labours under for want of salt is inexpressible, it gave me great plea∣sure to be informed that pans for the purpose of manufacturing salt are to be procured. You will please to order four of the pans mentioned in your letter to be expedited to this place.</P>
<P>I am doubly distressed for blankets. Many are wanted for the troops, and a considerable number for the Indians, who are to meet me in great numbers at this place on the 15th instant, and who will be greatly disappointed if they do not meet with a supply. Permit me therefore to entreat your best exertions to assist me in procuring a supply, and be so good as to observe to the Representative Bodies of the State, that it is of the first importance that we should be able to support the good opinion the Indians have entertained of us.</P>
<P>His Excellency General Washington advises me that light artillery are daily expected at Boston from France, and that I may be furnished with a supply. You will be so good as to give me the earliest intimation of its arrival, that I may send horses to bring it on. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE necessity of inducing the Six Nations to abide by the neutrality they have promised to observe is a matter of capital moment. The troops it would require to awe these people, if they were unfriendly, would create a very considerable expence, whilst a sum, equal to the tenth part of it, properly laid out in presents, would have all the desired effect. A conference is to be held with them at this place on the 15th instant, and as they inform me that they will generally attend, it is necessary that the articles necessary to give them should be procured without delay. The importance of the business will apologize for the liberty I take, by entreating your aid to Major Rensselaer, who is expresly sent to procure such articles as are indispensibly re∣quisite. I have also addressed myself to General Heath on the subject, and hope, by your joint exertions, that Major Rensselaer will be able to return here in good time, with most, if not all, the articles I have given him a memorandum of, which he will lay before you.</P>
<P>The enemy, from some late manoeuvres, do not appear to be in great force. They have entrenched them∣selves, and thrown a boom across the lake, at a point of land about three miles north of Ticonderoga. The militia are moving up, and I hope to follow to-morrow or next day with the troops from Peek's-Kill, who are momently expected.</P>

<P>I DID myself the pleasure to write you on the first instant, but not having been able to forward any letters, it will be delivered you, with this, by Major Rensselaer.</P>
<P>The Six Nations of Indians, who were invited to a conference to be held at this place on the 15th instant, have sent me word that they would generally attend. The importance of keeping these people to observe that neutrality which they have promised is so evident, that it needs not to be particularly dwelt upon. Permit me only to observe, that one tenth part of the money, necessary to maintain a force equal to keep them in awe, expended in presents, will have the desired effect. The difficulty is, to procure the articles that are wanted; and as they are not to be got any where but with you, I have sent Major Rensselaer for the purpose, and must earnestly entreat you that you will be pleased to afford him every assistance in your power, and to order Major Chase, the Deputy Quarter Master General, to provide him with carriages, for which he will pay. I have written to the President of the State, entreating his assistance also. Should any of the articles, or any thing as a substitute, be found in any of the continental stores, you will please to order such to be delivered.</P>
<P>The enemy have approached to within three miles of Ticonderoga, where they are retrenching themselves, and also are throwing a boom across the lake. This does not carry with it an idea that they have any great force. The militia are marching up, and part of the continental troops from Peek's-Kill are momently expected. I shall make all the haste possible with them, and hope we shall be able, at least, to prevent the enemy from doing any thing capital.</P>
<P>I have sent General Learned to collect the militia at Fort Edward and Fort Ann.</P>

<P>I have sent a trusty officer to march a strong body to the quarter you mention. I dare not be more explicit, lest this should be intercepted, and the enemy derive an advantage from the information. The troops can march and fall in on enemy as you wished.</P>
<P>The militia are moving up in great numbers, both from this and the New-England States. I shall set out to-morrow with the reinforcements from Peek's-Kills, which are very considerable. I shall have great hopes, if General Burgoyne continues in the vicinity of your post until we get up, and dares risk an engagement, that we shall give a good account of him.</P>

<P>YOUR letter of the 2d instant was delivered me last night. I am apprehensive that the agreement you have made with Brandt will not turn out much to our advantage, for although it was prudent not to refuse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out the Mohawks of the Lower Castle go to the Canajoharie Castle, yet permitting Mr. Stewart and Mrs. Butler to reside there, is putting these people in a way to do more mischief than they could have done had they been obliged to remain where they were; and as Brandt informed you that he was going to Butler, and proposed to join in the expedition which he says is to be carried on against Fort Schuyler, this ought to have prevented every kind of treaty with him; however, as it is done, we must abide by it.</P>
<P>If we act with vigour and spirit, we have nothing to fear, but if once despondency takes place, the worst of consequences are to be apprehended. It is therefore incumbent on you to keep up the spirits of the people.</P>

<P>YOUR letter of the 2d instant was delivered me last night by Mr. Moore.</P>
<P>As General Herkimer has made an agreement with Brandt, and that the latter is gone or going to Onendoga, I do not apprehend that the inhabitants of Cherry Valley will be in any danger from the Indians, more especially as the treaty is to be held here on the 15th instant, to which the Indians have generally promised to come. I shall, however, order Colonel Van Schaick to remain in Tryon county. I cannot but think that he will be more advantageously posted for the protection of the inhabitants at Cana∣joharie, on the north side of the river. I have, however, directed him, on this head, to consult you and General Herkimer.</P>
<P>I am very sorry that such a despondency should have taken place, as to induce you to say,
<Q>;If not suc∣coured, the well affected people of these frontiers will be left in such a dilemma, that will render them obliged either to abandon their habitations, or submit to the terms of the friends of Great-Britain, <HI>seeing themselves out of the protection of the States of America.</HI></Q></P>
<P>You seem to entertain an idea that the enemy are capable of doing what they please; whereas, in fact, there is great reason to believe that they will not be able to do much. I entreat you to keep up the spirits of the people. Encourage them to step forth with alacrity, whenever they may be called upon, and our enemies will be hassled in their attempts, and do not suppose that the United States of America will not afford you protection. I am sure I have been always ready and willing to afford every assistance in my power, and hitherto it has been effectual; for no mischief worth mentioning has as yet been perpetrated in any part of your country, and you may depend upon it, that upon no necessary occasion will you be left without pro∣per support.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I do myself the honour to transmit you copy of sundry letters and papers received from General St. Clair.</P>
<P>The troops from Peek's-Kill have not yet appeared. I wait their arrival with impatience and anxiety, and shall push with them the moment they do; but if they do not arrive by to-morrow, I shall go without them, and do the best I can with the militia.</P>
<P>The enemy have had a party at Fort Schuyler, who have scalped a Captain and Corporal of Gansevoort's regiment. This, with the threatnings of Joseph Brandt and his party, and the prospect of the enemy's ap∣proach by Oswego, greatly dispirits the people of Tryon county, who have called upon me for support, in such a manner that I am obliged to leave Colonel Van Schaick's in that quarter, and apprehend that a rein∣forcement will soon be required there. If so, I shall be greatly distressed, as we are, and with the reinforce∣ments coming up will still be, but weak to the northward, a great part of which must be employed as convoys to escort the provisions from Fort George and Fort Edward to Fort Ann, and thence to Skeensborough and Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>I mentioned in a former letter from Saratoga, that I supposed such an additional quantity of provisions had arrived by that time, as that the garrison was supplied with near sixty days; but as great part, if not all of what was at the landing is sent back to Fort George, they are much short of it. I have ordered it to be car∣ried
<PB N="41" REF="016142_0040_0F9B8E79A4A224B0"/>
to Fort Ann. I with it had been conveyed to Ticonderoga in the months of April and May. I assure you I am far from being at ease on the score of provisions, for if we should not be able to throw in a supply of fat cattle, I fear that we shall not have a sufficient quantity of salt meat in this part of the country. At Fort Schuyler only, twenty-nine thousand odd hundred weight has been condemned.</P>
<P>Mr. Spencer is returned from the Six Nations. He advises that the meeting at this place will be numerous. The enemy's agents have industriously propagated that we have nothing to give them; that if we get any thing, it must come from Heaven; that all our ports are shut up, and that we can neither get in or out. A good use might be made of this assertion, if we could give them a tolerable good supply; but the goods I sent for to the eastward in March last have come so extravagantly high, that the cargoe is small indeed, and not one blanket, and very little strouds, two articles, without which every thing else is considered as almost nothing. In this situation, Mr. Douw and I thought it advisable that another attempt should be made to procure a sup∣ply, and I have dispatched Major Rensselaer express to Boston, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,000 dollars, and letters to the Presi∣dent of the State and General Heath. As this is an expenditure far beyond the intention of Congress (but merely the result of necessity) I must entreat the scuse of Congress upon it, that, if it should be disapproved, I make take measures that neither the public or I may sustain a loss.</P>

<P>I DO myself the honour to transmit you copies of General St. Clair's letters to me of the 30th of June, continued to the 1st of July, together with copies of those of the 2d and 3d instant, and two papers inclosed in the last, all of which are numbered in the order of time I received them.</P>
<P>The troops from Peek's-Kill have not yet appeared. I wait their arrival with anxiety, and the moment they do I shall move with them. If they do not arrive by to-morrow, I go without them, and will do the best I can with the militia.</P>
<P>The enemy have had a party at Fort Schuyler, who scalped a Captain and Corporal of Gansevoort's regi∣ment. This, with the threatnings of Joseph Brandt, a natural son of Sir William Johnson, who commands a party of about two hundred Indians, and the prospect of being attacked by the way of Oswego, has so di∣spirited the inhabitants of Tryon county, that I have been obliged to leave Colonel Van Schaick, who has about one hundred and fifty continental troops with him, in that part of the country, and apprehend that I shall soon be under the necessity of reinforcing him. If so, I propose to send him some of the militia destined for the northward, that we may keep the continental troops as much together as possible.</P>
<P>Inclose your Excellency a return of the army at Ticonderoga. Should any accident befal us in that quar∣ter, and the troops be lost, we shall be in a disagreeable situation, with little else besides militia, with not a single piece of heavy or light artillery, and not one artillery-man.</P>
<P>If it be possible, I wish your Excellency to order as many artillery-men and field-pieces to this quarter as can be spared, with a competent quantity of fixed ammunition, as we have no cannon cartridge paper, and very little of any other.</P>
<P>As part of the provisions I sent by the way of Lake George is returned to that post, I shall now be under the necessity of drawing it from thence to Fort Ann, that we may attempt to supply the garrison of Ticonde∣roga by the way of Wood Creek and Skeensborough; but should we be incapable of getting a supply of fresh provisions into that fortress, I dread the consequences, as the hopes I have of obtaining any considerable quantity of salted meat are next to none, unless it can be sent from below, a good deal of what was in this department being spoiled.</P>

<P>BESIDES the provisions which I desired you to forward to Fort Ann and Skeensborough, you will send all the pork and beef from Fort Edward and Fort George to those places, except fifty barrels to be left at Fort George, and twenty-five at Fort Edward. It is of much importance that this should be done with great ex∣pedition; you will therefore employ as many carriages as you can procure. The waggons that carry the baggage of the militia will be of considerable aid to you on this occasion. Strong escorts must attend those that are employed between Fort George and Fort Ann, for which you will apply to General Learned. I shall be up with you in a day or two.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>From the aforegoing facts and papers I humbly conceive the Court will clearly perceive, that during the whole time of my command, prior to the evacuation, I was guilty of no neglect of duty, either in not trans∣mitting information to Congress, preparing for the campaign of 1777, obtaining intelligence of the enemy's designs, or pursuing every measure in my power for rendering them abortive. Should you, Gentlemen, be of this opinion, I presume a supposition of my having neglected my duty in the instance charged against me will not be so easily admitted, as if my prior attention had been less extensive and unremitted.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to the second thing proposed, viz. To lay before the Court the reasons of my absence from Ticonderoga at the time of the siege.—They are as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> I did not then, nor can I now, think it the duty of a Commander in Chief of an extensive Depart∣ment ever to suffer himself to be blesieged in a sort.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> I did not apprehend it to have been the desire, or even wish of Congress, that I should have remained in the garrison of Ticonderoga at the time of the siege.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.</HI> The particular and various circumstances and exigencies of the department did at that time call for my care and attention, and consequences capitally injurious to the public good would have ensued, had I been at Ticonderoga during the siege.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> That Commanders in Chief should not permit themselves to be besieged in a fort appears so striking and evident, that I am at a loss to adduce reasons for rendering it more clear.</P>
<P>When it is considered that there may be and generally are in every department various posts and passes, all of which demand his care; that occasional aid is to be afforded, in proportion to their respective necessi∣ties; that the operations of the enemy may frequently render new dispositions necessary, and that applications from every quarter of the department must be made to him; I think he would merit censure were he to con∣fine his care to a single garrison, lock himself up in it, and, during the course of perhaps a long siege, de∣prive the remainder of the department of his superintendence.</P>
<P>The propriety of this reasoning receives additional force from general practice. I am ignorant of any in∣stances of Commanders in Chief having acted this part. The present war affords numerous instances to the contrary.</P>
<P>His Excellency General Washington never suffered himself to be besieged. What would have been the consequence had be taken the command of Fort Washington? His abilities perhaps might have saved it, but it might even then have been lost, and surely it was not his duty to have run the risque. His personal valour, as well as good conduct, stands confessed, and yet he never thought himself justifiable to take such a step. I would not here be supposed to compare myself, in point of importance, to that great and good man. I mean nothing further by this, than to represent the impropriety of such conduct in a Commander in Chief in a stronger light.</P>
<P>It is well known that the command of sorts is generally given to subordinate officers; and as the object of the appointment of a Commander in Chief is the good of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole department, it would, in my opinion, be repugnant to the design of his appointment, to put himself in such a situation as to be able to extend his care no further than the walls of one single fort in it. On the contrary, should be not leave himself at large, to concert and execute measures for the relief of such posts as may be in danger, to afford them succours, to annoy the enemy, to cut off their retreat, to intercept their supplies, and generally to do every thing, which, in his opinion, may be calculated to frustrate their designs?</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Had I received the least intimation that it was the desire of Congress that I should take the command of Ticonderoga, I should, without the least hesitation, have done it, but such intimation was never given me. On the contrary besides the reasons above mentioned, I had particular ones, which induced me to believe that they neither expected or desired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</P>
<P>Ticonderoga has been deemed an important post ever since the war, and when it became most so, Congress was pleased to name the officer who they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should command at it.</P>
<P>On the 7th of March, 1776. Congress resolved that I should for the present, or until I should receive farther orders, six my Head-Quarters at Albany.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="016142_0042_0F9B8E7DC2498A70"/>And although in the fall following the enemy appeared in force in the vicinity of Ticonderoga under General Carleton, and apparently with design to invest it, yet the above order remained unrepealed, and the immediate command of that post was committed to another officer.</P>
<P>Nor were these orders annulled till the 22d of May, 1777, in consequence of my representing to Congress the impracticability of my paying proper attention to the department, during the continuance of that restriction.</P>
<P>On the 29th of April, 1777, the Congress passed the following resolution:</P>
<P>"<HI>Ordered,</HI> That General St. Clair be informed by express of the approach of the enemy to Ticonderoga, "and that he repair without loss of time to that place.</P>
<P>As General St. Clair was at that time one of the officers designed for the Northern Department, and of course under my command, the above order receives all its propriety and use, from a supposition that I should not remain with the garrison in case of a siege.</P>
<P>At no time, during my command in that department, did I ever intimate a design of taking the particular command of that post. Indeed, I had informed Congress, as the Court will perceive by my letter of the 14th of June, already quoted, that
<Q>as soon as matters were brought into some train at Ticonderoga, and on the communication above, that I should hasten back to push on the necessary supplies, and regulate affairs on the Western Communication, where also much disorder prevailed.</Q>
As this letter was dispatched by express, and as it inclosed General St. Clair's letter of the 13th of June, if Congress had intended that I should have remained at Ticonderoga, it is reasonable to conclude that they would have given me orders for the purpose. Nor do any letters or resolves I have been honoured with from Congress hint such an expectation. Shortly before, and at the time of the siege, I transmitted several letters from General St. Clair to Congress, by which they were informed of the enemy's progress; and I also informed Congress of my in∣tention (not to command the garrison) but to put myself at the head of all the troops and militia I could collect, and do my utmost to raise the siege. From the above circumstances therefore, and from the silence of Congress respecting a desire that I should confine myself to the fort, I had not the least reason to infer that they wished it, or that they were displeased with my absence. About this time a treaty with the Indians was to be held, the security of Fort Schuyler to be provided for, the incursions of the Indians on the western fron∣tiers to be opposed, a long chain of communication to be kept open, the militia to be collected, supplies to the different posts to be forwarded, and my utmost exertions throughout the whole department required. I must therefore submit it to you, Gentlemen, whether I had any reason to conjecture that Congress expected I would confine myself at Ticonderoga, and thereby subject myself to the necessity of neglecting those other very important objects, especially too as an officer of reputation, nominated by them to command at Ticon∣deroga, was then at that post.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> The particular and various circumstances and exigencies of the department did at that time call for my care and attention, and that consequences very injurious to the public good would have ensued, had I been at Ticonderoga during the siege.</P>
<P>Permit me to remind you, Gentlemen, that Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Fort George, Fort Schuyler, Al∣bany, and various other posts, are included in the Northern Department, and then under my command; that an expedition was then carrying on against Ticonderoga by General Burgoyne; another against Fort Schuyler by General St. Leger; and a third by a party of savages against the western settlements of this State; that, to establish a communication for the passage of supplies from Albany and the interior country to Ticonderoga, a chain of posts was to be maintained, which chain consisted of the following posts, Half Moon, Stillwater, Saratoga, Fort Miller, Fort Edward, Fort George, Fort Ann and Skeensborough; that a like chain of posts was necessary to be maintained to the westward, to secure a communication with Fort Schuyler, viz. Schenec∣tady, Fort Johnson and Fort Dayton. At all these posts troops were stationed, and care to be taken to prevent any of them from being surprized; it being evident that the loss of one of these posts would have broken the whole communication, and have stopped the progress of supplies too important to be risqued in that critical season.</P>
<P>It will be unnecessary here to mention the frequent applications made to me for succour from the western country, I mean from Cherry Valley, Umadilla, Schohary, Canajoharie, German Flatts, and Fort Schuyler, which was afterwards relieved by a detachment I sent under General Arnold for that purpose, some of which places were in danger, others had suffered, and all in the greatest con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ernation, as will appear by sundry papers which I shall have the honour to lay before the Court.</P>
<P>The fate of sort Schuyler, as well as Ticonderoga, was precarious. In case of the reduction of either, measures were to be taken for opposing the victorious army, and the system of that opposition was to depend on events and circumstances, then only to be conjectured.</P>
<P>Pacific, as well as hostile measures, to avoid the depredations of the savages, were then in agitation, a treaty was to be held, messages were to be sent and received, agents to be employed and instructed, speeches to be made and answered, presents to be collected and distributed. Add to this, that there was not a general officer in the department, who had a competent knowledge of that extensive country, immediately to direct the military operations in it. With what propriety could I throw myself into Ticonderoga, and, as it were, abandon those numerous and essential objects?</P>
<P>Had I remained with the garrison of Ticonderoga, the valuable stores at Fort George would have been lost, a competent supply of provisions for Fort Schuyler would not have been afforded, for although I had given or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers for it immediately on my resuming the command, it was not done till after the 20th of July, as ap∣pears by Colonel Gansevoort's letter of that date, and then by my express orders. The militia of this State would not have been so soon collected or the cattle and carriages in the reach of the enemy removed. The obstructions in the navigation of Wood Creek, and of the roads into the country (which was done before General St. Clair and the garrison came up) whereby the progress of the enemy was greatly retarded, might not have been effected, nor would the country so spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> have been put into a posture of defence.</P>
<P>The papers which I have last quoted, I trust, wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evince such a constant attention to the duties of my office, and such a degree of anxiety for the public weal, as could only flow from a heart deeply impressed with the love of its country; and may I be permitted to observe, that, notwithstanding the Committee ap∣pointed
<PB N="44" REF="016142_0043_0F9B8DD2B0AAE490"/>
by the resolution of Congress of the 29th of July, 1777, were charged to make the most critical enquiry, in order to investigate the causes of the misfortunes in the Northern Department, and that in obedi∣ence to the orders of Congress, and in conformity to their duty, they published the resolutions in the news∣papers, and in the same public manner called upon every person capable of giving information to do so, wrote to the several officers in the Northern Department, and to the several Executive Powers of this and the Eastern States, to afford their aid in procuring information, and as the charge of my not being at Ticonderoga is founded on a fact which was notorious, which Congress were fully informed of, previous to that resolution, it affords strong presumptive proof that the Committee received no information on which they could ground any charge, and authorizes the conclusion, that if I erred in judgment, in not being at Ticonderoga during the siege, it was by no means an intentional neglect of duty. Indeed, I have every reason to believe, from the confidence which Congress have been pleased to place in me after I was last superceded in the command of the Northern Department, instances of which I shall beg leave to produce, that that Honourable Body does not consider me either as a criminal, or even unworthy servant of the public. I hope also to evince to the Court, that, although extremely wounded in my feelings to be deprived of the command in the moment when there was a prospect of acquiring great reputation, I continued in that line of conduct which I conceived it to be the duty of every good man to hold to his country, however highly that country may have injured him; and for that purpose I shall beg leave to read some letters and papers, for the information of the Court, after having laid before them sundry applications that were made me from different quarters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Papers read were:</P>

<P>THE carpenters, who have been employed at Ticonderoga and Skeensborough, are totally destitute of tools, having lost them all in their retreat. Some of them are on their way down, and will apply to you to be furnished with what tools you can procure. The General desires you will take the most effectual measures to procure them a supply. Inclosed you have a list of necessaries wanted at Fort Schuyler. Such as have not been sent by Mr. Renssclaer, and in your power to furnish, you will please to send on with all the expedition possible to Col. Gansevoort, except musket ball, which must be delayed till we have a supply here. <HI>I am, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><LABEL>P. S.</LABEL> Three hundred carriages are wanted at this place, which it will be necessary to detain only a few days Your best exertions will be required to send up that number. Let none be neglected. Apply to the Committee of Albany and General Ten Broeck, and request their aid to induce the people from every quarter to come up with waggons. Let the militia bring with them as many as they think proper, and assure them that their detention will be only for a few days. We are in great distress for want of lead, an article so essentially requisite, that we cannot even hope to do any thing here to prevent the enemy's ad∣vancing without it. The citizens of Albany only can supply our present exigencies immediately. Recourse must therefore be had to the Committee, begging their interposition to collect such lead as is in the city. The lead from windows and weights may perhaps afford a supply for the present. As soon as it can be collected, Mr. Rensselaer will have it made into ball, and send it up without a moment's delay.</P>

If you are obliged to come away, try by all means to bring off the cannon and tents. Keep the contents a pro∣found secret, for fear of dispiriting the troops.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment received a letter from General Learned, copy whereof I do myself the honour to inclose.</P>
<P>I am extremely apprehensive that the greatest part of the garrisons of Ticonderoga and Mount Independ∣ence are in the enemy's power, and if they make a push they may do what they please, as I have not above 700 continental troops to oppose them with, and I fear not above twice that number of militia. I cannot doubt but that we have lost every piece of cannon we had there, so that I am now left with a few small pieces, not a sufficient number even for the two small schooners on Lake George. I evidently foresee that all this part of the country will soon be in their power, unless we are speedily and largely reinforced.</P>
<P>I am in the utmost distress for want of provisions of the meat kind, much of the beef now forwarding be∣ing spoiled.</P>
<P>I shall do every thing that is left in my power to do, and the best.</P>

<P>I AM this moment informed, by an express from Fort Ann, that Ticonderoga and Mount Independence are evacuated, and that our troops are landing at Skeensborough. If so, you will please to send out strong parties, to bring away the inhabitants to the north and north-east of Skeensborough. Should that be imprac∣ticable, you are to give the most positive orders to bring away all their cattle, of what kind soever they may be, and also all such wheel carriages as cannot be brought away to be destroyed.</P>

<P>BOTH Ticonderoga and Mount Independence are in the enemy's possession. Part of our troops are at Skeensborough, to which place the enemy have pursued. It is therefore now become necessary that every man of the militia should turn out, and that without a moment's delay. You will therefore issue your orders accordingly, and I hope to see you with them. Such a variety of affairs will engross my atten∣tion, that I shall not have time to attend to the applications of the militia, and the service will consequently suffer, unless you are present.</P>

<P>I WROTE you last night from Saratoga, wishing you to direct your march with the utmost expedition to Fort Ann or this place. I now most earnestly renew the request. I had forgot to give directions about the security of the people on the Grants. I think it will be right to leave Colonel Warner, with his regiment and the militia belonging to the Grants. If you are of the same opinion, you will give the orders accord∣ingly. I wish Colonel Warner to drive the cattle in that part of the country into his rear, and to send off every carriage that may be serviceable to the enemy, and such as cannot be sent off to be destroyed. What∣ever cattle are sufficiently in flesh to be killed for the troops, he must send on here by a safe route.</P>
<P>Some of the enemy are harrassing us above Fort Ann; I wish you may fall in with them.</P>
<P>The reinforcement from below is marching up, and so are the militia, and I think, when you join us, we shall not have occasion to fear that the enemy will make any further progress.</P>

<P>YOU will march with the detachment ordered to parade by the orders of this morning as far as Fort Ann. You are to take with you as many selling axes as can be found in store.

away whatever carriages may be found. Provided nevertheless, that if any of the inhabitants chuse to come away, that parties are to assist them in loading their goods upon their carriages, and escort them to this post. These parties being sent out, you will begin, as near Fort Ann as possible, to fell trees across the road; and when you come where the roads divide, one half of your force is to be employed on the road which leads to Huffnagel's, and the other half on that to Jones's. You will make the obstructions as effectual as possible. Take up every bridge, and burn the covering and timber. Let me know from time to time how you proceed. It will be necessary that you keep two or three scouts constantly out towards the enemy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM this moment favoured with your Excellency's letter of the 6th instant. You will before this have received my several letters, advising your Excellency of the evacuation of Ticonderoga, and the distressed situation we are in. We are by no means now in a better, rather worse, as desertion is frequent. General Nixon's brigade is not yet come up, nor do I get a reinforcement of the militia. General St. Clair, from whom I have heard for the first time about ten this morning (copy of his letter I inclose) is about fifty miles east of me. If he should go to Bennington, as I fear he will be obliged to do, he will be still farther off, and the more he gets into the inhabited part of the country, the greater will the desertion from the army be, which is already much, very much diminished, by numbers going off. I am very apprehensive General St. Clair will not join me with more than one thousand men. General Nixon's corps, I am informed, is under that. Thus, with less than three thousand continental and not quite one thousand militia, I am to face a powerful enemy from the north, flushed with success, and pressed at the same time from the west by a body, which, from repeated information (copies whereof I have not time to send), is respectable, and already at Oswego.</P>
<P>We have still stores of such importance left at Fort George, that I am very anxious to bring them off be∣fore I order that post to be abandoned, which I must do, or suffer the garrison to fall into the enemy's hands, which it inevitably will, if the enemy, who are approaching by Wood Creek, throw themselves between this and Lake George.</P>
<P>I have brought away about twenty pieces of artillery from Lake George, together with nearly all the powder, amounting to about thirteen tons.</P>
<P>General Fellows, with a small body of militia, but all I could get, are breaking up the road between this and Fort Ann, and felling trees into it. I will throw every obstacle in their route I possibly can, and retard their progress as much as possible. For this purpose, I shall disengage myself of every thing cumbersome, the artillery especially, as I can make no use of it.</P>
<P>Permit me to assure your Excellency, that I shall make every resistance I possibly can, and that nothing shall be left undone to prevent the enemy from penetrating farther in the country.</P>

A few days after General St. Clair arrives, I hope to discharge part of the militia that were up first.</P>
<P>The enemy are retired from Fort Ann, and I am making all the obstruction in my power, and if they give me three or four days time after General St. Clair joins. I believe they will not see Albany this campaign.</P>
<P>I have saved about forty pieces of cannon, and fifteen tons of powder. The cannon I shall send to Saratoga, to get carriages made for them at that place. I am greatly distressed for waggons. Pray afford your assist∣ance in procuring them. The troops are recovering their spirits, and begin to look up: Mine were never better. Adieu.</P>

<P>YOUR letter of the 7th instant is before me. I doubt not but that you will have parties of Indians about you. Those you mention seem to have been very quiet ones, for they not only shewed themselves, but stood and talked with a Negroe. You must expect that some mischief will be done, but that ought not to discourage the people. If only a small portion of your militia turn out, you will drive them off. The garri∣son of Fort Schuyler will be sufficiently strong when your detachment arrives, but as soon as I can afford troops to go into that quarter, I shall send them. We must oppose the enemy where they shew themselves, that is here, at present; and although Ticonderoga is abandoned, I am nevertheless not afraid that they will be able to get much lower into the country. Keep up the spirits of the people, and all will be well.</P>

You will direct the officers commanding these scouts to be as exact as possible in ascertaining the numbers of any of the enemy they may see, and to give you the earliest intelligence of it, that I may be advised thereof by you as soon as possible. Having dispatched the scouts, you will proceed to burn the saw-mills which are near Fort Ann, and then fall the trees growing on the banks of Wood Creek into the same; and if such a superior body of the enemy should move towards you, that it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> probable that you can keep your ground, you are then to retire, advising me thereof, that your retreat may be covered.

<P>YOUR letter of the 10th instant I have received. The information that four or five hundred Indians were on their way to New-Perth is totally groundless. There are not even any so high up Wood Creek as Fort Ann, where we have a large body of troops. If it was necessary to send troops to White Creek, I would most readily do it. My care shall be extended to every quarter, and if my countrymen will support me with vigour and activity, we shall be able to prevent the enemy from penetrating much farther into the country; but if they suffer their spirits to sink, and meanly despond, the word of consequences are to be apprehended.</P>
<P>I am informed that several people, forgetting the duty they owe their country, discourage the good inhabi∣tants, and are ready to take protection from the enemy. Any that have made such declarations, I would advise to have immediately secured and sent prisoners to Albany.</P>
<P>The enemy's view, in offering protection, is only to prevent the inhabitants from acting spiritedly; to get into the country, and, when once there, to plunder indiscriminately, as well those that may have relied on their promises, as those that have gloriously stepped forth for the defence of their country, and those bles∣sings which they can only enjoy by having that country free.

<P>YOUR letter of the 11th instant I received last night. I should be extremely happy if I had it in my power to afford you the assistance you request, but in fact I have not that number of militia in this quarter.

<P>I would, by all means, advise that the cattle of every kind, and carriages, should be moved from every township exposed to the incursions of the enemy's parties, and which cannot be covered by the troops or militia, to some more interior places of safety.</P>
<P>I have already ordered a considerable quantity of powder and ball to be sent on to Colonel Warner. If more of the former should be wanted, it will be sent on application. As to fire-arms, I have not one, and many of the troops are without, consequently cannot give any.</P>

<P>WE are collecting our army; its spirits are recovering. Pray send us whatever you can think of for an army that has nothing, except provision. Our whole train of artillery consists of two iron field pieces. The whole of our lead less than three tons, only about fifteen reams of cartridge paper.

<P>Many of our troops have deserted. I wish you to apply to the Legislature of the State, and request them to adopt such measures as will bring them back. The enemy are at Skeensborough. Our advanced posts are at Fort George and Fort Ann. We propose to remain here, and at a post about four miles below this.</P>

I have made a temporary appointment of Mr. Lyons to be your Pay Master, and have given him four thousand dollars, which is all I can at present spare. Colonel Simmonds, with four or five hundred of his regiment, will join your's; but let the others come this way. We are informed the enemy are gone to Ticonderoga, to come by the way of Fort George, because they find it rather difficult to penetrate by the way of Skeensborough. Secure all the cattle and carriages you can. Much depends upon preventing them from getting supplies of that kind. Advance as near to the enemy as you possibly can. Secure all tories, and send them to the interior part of the country. Be vigilant; a surprise is inexcusable. Thank the troops, in my name, for behaving so well as you say they did at Hubbarton. Assure them that I will get whatever I can to make them comfortable. All of your regiment that were here are already on the way to join you. If we act vigorously, we save the country.

<P>You will also bring away the scows, and all the iron work from Jones's and Huffnagel's mills, or see they do it themselves, that the enemy may not have the advantage of those mills.</P>

<P>IT gives me great pain that I am not in a capacity directly to answer your letter of the 15th instant. As an officer of the Honourable the Congress, who represent the Thirteen United States of America. I cannot with propriety take notice of a Fourteenth State, unknown in their Confederacy. In order that the public service may not suffer, I shall however answer your letter, which, for the reasons already assigned, I am under the necessity of doing in your private capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="016142_0050_0F9B8E841F787908"/>That the enemy should fortify at Castle-Town is to me exceeding unaccountable. It is certain that a considerable body of their troops with General Burgoyne are at Skeensborough; that, from corroborated in∣formation, a body of them are gone to Ticonderoga, to come by the way of Lake George.</P>
<P>It is, doubtless, extremely difficult to move the inhabitants that lie nearest the enemy, but I should hope that Colonel Warner, supported by the militia under Colonel Simmonds, which I have ordered to join him, and with that of the State of New-Hampshire, and such as can be collected from the more southern parts of what are commonly called the Grants, would be able to effect this business in a very great measure.</P>
<P>The enemy, by the best accounts, are not above six thousand; and, if it be true that they are disposed of as I have mentioned, the body at Castle-Town cannot be considerable.</P>
<P>I have ordered such persons as are going to the enemy for protections to be seized, and sent prisoners to me. Three have been delivered to me, and I have sent them to goal in Albany.

<P>WHEREAS Lieutenant General John Burgoyne, commanding an army of the British troops, did, by a written paper by him subscribed, bearing date at Skeensborough House on the 10th day of July instant, require you to send from your several townships deputations, consisting of ten persons or more from each township, to meet Col.

<P>I AM honoured with your's of yesterday's date. I have delivered the letter from Tryon county to Messrs. Yates and Morris, which they transmit to the Committee of Safety by this conveyance.</P>
<P>Be assured that I would most readily assist them with troops if I had them, and that I have not failed to pay my attention to that quarter, for I have already sent a detachment of the few continental troops I have, and have not called upon one man of their militia. It is surely not harder on them to turn out the militia, than it is for you and every other county, nor so much so, as they need not go much beyond the inhabited part of their county to defend themselves.</P>

<P>I THINK I mentioned to your Excellency in my letter of yesterday, that I had ordered the New-Hamp∣shire and part of the Massachusetts militia to join Colonel Warner; since which I have received a letter from that quarter, copy whereof I inclose, by which it appears that few or none have yet appeared, otherwise he would not be under the necessity of retreating before so small a body. I have now ordered all the Massachu∣setts militia that were not got as far as Albany to march to Colonel Warner, whose retreat to Bennington, if it takes place, will put a vast number of cattle and carriages into the enemy's power.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your letter of the 17th instant, and the papers it inclosed.</P>
<P>The substance of Colonel Harper's and Mr. Johnson's information had been transmitted about a month ago; in consequence whereof I sent Colonel Van Schaick into Tryon county, with as many troops as I could collect. After the improper agreement made by General Herkimer, these troops marched back; but as soon as I was informed of their march, I ordered them to remain in Tryon county, where they are still, and I have seat up Colonel Wesion's continental regiment to reinforce these; but, if I may be allowed to judge of the temper of General Herkimer and the Committee of Tryon county from their letters to me, nothing will satisfy them, unless I march the whole army into that quarter.</P>
<P>With deference to the better judgment of the Council of Safety, I cannot, by any means, think it prudent to bring on an open rupture with the savages at this time. The inhabitants of Tryon county, as you will have perceived by copy of some letters which I have had the honour to transmit you, are already too much inclined to lay down their arms, and <HI>take what terms the enemy may please to afford them.</HI> Half of the mi∣litia from this county, and the neighbouring State of Massachusetts, we have been under the necessity of dis∣missing, lest the whole should go, and I believe what are left will only remain a few days. The continental troops I have in this quarter are under three thousand, and the enemy encreasing with tories, who daily join them in very considerable numbers. Should we, in this situation, precipitate a rupture with the Indians, we should probably involve ourselves in the most inextricable difficulties. If I should ask the Indians for leave to build a fort at Onioquago, I am very certain that they would refuse me, and prejudice us in their minds. I have hopes that they will meet me at Albany in a week or two. If they do, I shall be under no apprehen∣sions that they will join against us.</P>

<P>PART of the enemy continue at Skeensborough, whilst others of them are coming through Lake George. From intelligence I have received, they mean soon to approach us. I was in hopes we should have been in better force to oppose them, but we have not three thousand continental troops, as you will have seen by the last return transmitted, and about one thousand five hundred militia, who are daily going off. If an accident should happen to us, it would probably be said by the people in the country that we had ten or twelve thousand men, and that we are traitors or cowards, as it is with great industry propagated that I and the general officers who were at Ticonderoga are. It is, however, a consolation to me, that Con∣gress will not condemn us unheard. For my part, I wish and entreat for an enquiry into my conduct, when∣ever it shall please Congress, and they think it can be done with the least detriment to the public service.</P>
<P>I could ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> easily have exculpated myself from the many heavy charges that are brought against me, if I had dared to venture a publication, which must necessarily have contained extracts of my letters to Congress, to his Excellency General Washington, and to the General Officers and others under my command; but, as such a step might have prejudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the public.

<P>WE have not now above thirteen hundred militia on the ground. I wish we had the most distant prospect to detain one half of those above five or six days. Our continental force is between twenty-seven and twenty-eight hundred. With this small body we have to encounter a much more numerous body of enemy, well appointed, flushed with success, and daily encreasing by the acquisition of tories. Happy I should still be, in some degree, if I could close the melancholy tale here; but every letter I receive from the county of Tryon advises me that the inhabitants of it will lay down their arms, unless I support them with continental troops. From what I have said, you will see the impossibility of my complying with their request. The district of Schohary has also pointedly intimated, that unless continental troops are sent them they will also submit to the enemy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter of the 26th instant I have this moment received. It was extremely mortifying to me, that we were under the necessity of discharging part of the militia, but I believe it will be confessed that it was much better to keep a part than to have lost the whole, which would certainly have been the case. As I am to have no farther reinforcements of continental troops than General Glover's brigade, every militia-man that can be got should be sent up. I have written to Governor Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll for at least two thousand from Con∣necticut. Application has been made to the State of Massachusetts, and I do now request of the Council of Safety, that they will be pleased to take measures to send as many from this State as can be procured, and to be engaged for a determinate time. Those now with me are diminishing fast, and not one of them will remain more than a for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>night.</P>
<P>It is very true, that, in direct violation of the contract with the carpenters, their tools were taken from them. I must confess too that it was done by my order, and I trust the Council of Safety will think I did what was perfectly right. We had not a carpenter's tool left in this department, our whole stock having been lost at Ticonderoga. I had gun carriages to make, and others to mend, a bridge to throw over Hudson's River, for the security of the country, and all that variety of carpentry to be done, which is ever necessary with an army. In short, Sir, I labour under a thousand difficulties at present for want of a sufficiency of tools. Their complaint that the tools were taken from them is just. They are to be paid for them; but I cannot remove the cause by restoring the tools, without sacrificing the country.</P>

<P>I wish people to consider that we have had a larger body of enemy on this side of Lake George, when Fort William-Henry was taken; that the British troops were on the point of retiring from Fort Edward; and that many concluded the country was lost. A little reflection convinced that the danger was not so great as they at first imagined, and they resumed their spirits. I hope they will do so now. I wish them to consider, that if General Burgoyne should even got as far down as Half-Moon, that he will run himself into the greatest dan∣ger, and that in all probability his whole army will be destroyed. It appears most evident to me, that if we exert ourselves all will go well. The troops under my command are in good spirits, and the militia also.</P>

<P>COLONEL WARNER is on the Grants with a small body of continental troops, some militia, and expects to be reinforced in a day or two by General Stark, with a body of Militia from New-Hampshire. You will please to repair to Manchester, the place where the troops above mentioned are collected and collect∣ing, and take the command of the whole. As General Burgoyne is advancing towards us, and a movement of a body of troops from the Grants towards Skeensborough will doubtless much embarrass him, and will certainly oblige him to leave a considerable force at that place, you will move towards it, if the troops you should find there, or those that may join, are in such numbers as that you can do it without risking too much.</P>
<P>You will please to advise me from time to time of your situation and force, that I may be enabled to direct your future operations according to what information I may get of the enemy's intentions.

<P>THE letter of which the inclosed is copy I received a few moments ago, with a large belt of wampum from the Indians, by express. The troops under my immediate command are already too weak to maintain our ground against Burgoyne, and should I detach any to oppose the enemy expected from the westward, it would involve the army in this quarter in additional difficulties, and God knows we have a large share already.</P>
<P>I have desired Colonel Van Schaick to apply for all the Militia of Schohary, Duanesburgh, Schenectady and Tryon county, that can be collected, but I foresee that nothing will be effected, unless a committee of your body is deputed to repair to Albany. Give me leave, therefore, most earnestly to beg that that measure may be immediately adopted, as the greatest exertions are requisite to ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le the efforts of the enemy, and to prevent them from possessing themselves of this State.</P>

<P>I HAVE this moment received your letter of yesterday's date. The information you gave me made me blush for my countrymen.</P>
<P>Is it becoming rational beings, when a misfortune has happened to them, to despond, and not to counteract the evil? Surely not; and if the militia would do their duty, we should soon make the enemy repent their ever having come into the country, and retreat with infinitely more loss than we have experienced; but if the militia will sit still, folding their hands, and not make use of those exertions which God has put it in their power to make use of for their own defence, they certainly will become the victims of an enemy, whose very mercies are cruelty. How, Sir, can you think that I can spare men, when I have applied to you for men? Exert yourselves! Shew that you are men, and you will find men in numbers, and your enemies will vanish. We are all in good spirits. Be you so too, and do not create enemies by desponding.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RETURNED here last night to meet some Indians, who are deputed to me on business which they are to disclose at twelve to-day. Our army is at Stillwater, twenty-two miles north of this, where we wish to make a stand, and will do it, if supported by militia, none of which are yet arrived, nor any on the march. General Burgoyne's head-quarters were at Fort Edward on the fourth instant, and I am informed that he pro∣poses moving down in a few days. Great sickness begins to prevail in our army, chiefly occasioned, I believe, by living altogether on fresh meat, we not having had any salted meat for about twenty days past, there being next to none, nor any to be procured. The very little we have is kept for scouting parties.</P>
<P>At six this morning an express arrived from Tryon county, advising me
<Q>That General Herkimer march∣ed on the 3d instant to support the garrison at Fort Schuyler; that on Wednesday, between Orisko and the fort, the militia were attacked, and, according to the information received, the militia entirely cut to pieces, the General killed, with most of the field officers. The number of the enemy that ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the attack is no wise ascertained, but are thought to be very numerous. The fort, by all the accounts received, was attacked before the militia marched, but in what manner we know not; whether by Indians firing with small arms at a distance, to confine our people within the fort, or whether their main body was near ad∣vanced or not, I cannot say; therefore hope you will immediately send assistance, or this quarter must of course fall into the enemy's hands, as the whole of the militia was in the engagement, except a few guards that were stationed in different places.</Q>
This from Lieut. Col. Deygert of the militia, and I have not had a line from any one else on the subject. The garrison, as the Deputy Commissary General informs me in a letter of the 4th instant, is provided with 500 barrel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of flour, 60 barrels of salted provisions, a considerable quantity of pease, twenty head of fat cattle that lately arrived there, and the inhabitants round the fort have near fifty head, and that Colonel Gansevoort had them in charge.</P>

<P>A BRIGADE of continental troops, under the command of Brigadier General Learned, is on its march to the relief of Fort Schuyler. Let me beg you to exert yourselves to the utmost speedily to collect the militia of your county, and join General Learned. Upon your exertions the safety of our country greatly depends; and as the force ordered to your assistance is respectable, I confidently hope that you will act with spirit, and manfully join in repulsing the enemy, which I have not the least doubt but you will be able to effect, if your exertions are equal to your abilities.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me great satisfaction that you have offered to go and conduct the military operations in Tryon county. You will please to repair thither with all convenient speed, and take upon you the command of all the continental troops, and such of the militia as you can prevail upon to join your troops. Fort Schuyler being besieged, you will hasten to its relief, and I hope that the continental troops now in the county of Tryon, if joined by some of the militia, will be adequate to the business. Lieutenant Colonel Van Dyck is very well acquainted, not only with the country, but with many of the Indians, and will be capable of doing you good service. Permit me therefore to recommend him to your attention.</P>
<P>Henry Glen, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> is Assistant Deputy Quarter Master General at Schenectady, to whom you will apply for assistance in waggons and batteaus. If you could procure such a number of waggons as to convey the mens packs, it would greatly expedite your march. Orders are given to send on a supply of provisions. You will, however, not be retarded on that account, as the country is capable of affording a sufficiency for your troops.</P>
<P>Colonel Van Dyck will inform you of the names of the Colonels of militia in Tryon county, and although I have already written to General Herkimer and the General Committee of the county to draw forth their militia, yet it will be proper for you, as soon as you join the troops marched under the command of General Learned, to expedite expresses, entreating that the militia may be collected at the German Flats by the time you may arrive there.</P>
<P>A small regiment, commanded by Colonel Livingston, is at John's-Town. The inhabitants of Caghna∣waga have offered to hold that post, if Colonel Livingston should be ordered up. You will be better enabled to judge of the propriety of moving him when you arrive there, and will do what you judge best.</P>
<P>Although the Mohawk Indians are far from being friendly to us, yet it would greatly prejudice our cause if they were insulted. You will therefore take every precaution to prevent it. The Oneidas have friendly sen∣timents towards us, and must be cherished. They may perhaps be induced to take an active part in our sa∣vour. Inclose you a warrant for one thousand dollars in specie, which you will please to make use of in order to conciliate the Oneidas, and to induce them to assist you. Be pleased to assure them that I wish to see them as soon as they can come down, and that I have provided a genteel present for them.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Tryon county are cheifly Germans, especially those at the German Flats. I think it would serve a good purpose to extol the action under General Herkimer, to praise their bravery, and give assurances that you wish to be joined by men, who have so bravely defended themselves. Compliment General Herkimer, and please to make mine to him.</P>
<P>It is not only impossible, but needless, to be more particular. I shall therefore only add that if Fort Schuy∣ler should unhappily have fallen into the enemy's hands, that you will then so dispose of the troops as best to cover the country.</P>
<P>I have ordered on a quantity of ammunition from Albany. If it is not yet gone, pray take it with you. I very much question whether more lead can be spared, as none of that from Peek's Kill which was designed for this department is come up. If you should think the quantity of powder I have ordered to be insufficient, you can take more. It is best you should carry it on with you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU having informed us that forty-five families of the St. Francois Indians are removed from thence, and are now near the Lake Umframagog, and incline to settle on some part of Connecticut river above Caboos. As it is of importance to secure as many of the Indians to the interest of the American cause as possible, espe∣cially such as reside in Canada, you will therefore please to take measures to remove the abovementioned Indians to some part of Connecticut river, as near the inhabitants as possible; and, to induce them more rea∣dily to come, you will afford them some assistance in provision and ammunition, for which purpose we furnish you with eight hundred dollars. You will please to advise me of your proceedings in this affair.</P>
<P>We are of opinion with you, that it is too late in the campaign to expect any service from them in the course of it; but it is of importance to impress them early with an idea that we expect that they hold them∣selves in readiness to give us their aid, should it be wanted in the next.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received a letter of yesterday's date without signature, but from the contents perceive it came from you.</P>
<P>Some of the Oneidas, Tuscaroras and Onondagos, arrived yesterday afternoon; the remainder are ex∣pected in a day or two. This day will be spent in the usual ceremony of mutual congratulations, which they will not dispense with, although they seem very anxious to return, as they expect Fort Schuyler will soon be again attacked. We shall, however, strive to procure some of them to join you, but cannot advise you to depend upon them for <HI>guides,</HI> as they are unacquainted with the part of the country you are in.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 14th instant about three hundred Indians (including men, women and children) of the Oneidas, Tuscaroras, and a few Onondagos and Mohawks, arrived here. The 15th was spent in the usual ceremony of congratulation, during which we took occasion to found their inclinations, and finding them inclinable to engage in the war, we prepared a speech, and on the next day offered them the war belt, which was imme∣diately accepted by warriors of each nation. On the 17th the war feast was prepared, at which the belt was solemnly accepted by the whole. The 18th and 19th passed in equipping them, and being informed about ten at night of the 19th that our army was engaged, and having then three of the chief warriors to sup with me, Mr. Edwards and myself requested them to march without delay, which they and many others did with great alacrity, and with such dispatch as to reach General Gates before noon next day, and by night the remainder arrived at the camp, making in all near one hundred and fifty. They have already taken about thirty prisoners, and intercepted some dispatches from General Burgoyne to General Powel, commanding at Ticonderoga. These Indians have requested that the southern ones should be advised by us that they have taken the hatchet, and a bolt will also be sent by them. We have taken measures to induce the whole con∣federacy to join us, and have reason to believe that they will do it. If so, we shall soon be informed of it, and I think in that case it would be prudent to call them into action the soonest possible, into whatever quarter their services may be most wanted.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a letter to Congress, dated Saratoga, <DATE>November <HI>4, 1777.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of the 12th ult. I had the honour to receive on the second instant. I feel myself much af∣fected by your friendly wishes for my happiness. The sentiments I have been happy enough to entertain of your humanity and sensibility have encreased with my misfortunes, nor shall ought ever be able to efface them.</P>
<P>On the second instant, two British officers, on their return to Canada, took shelter in a violent storm of rain in my little hut, the only remains of all my buildings in this quarter. In the course of conversation, I found that the one was attached to General Carleton, the other to General Burgoyne. Carleton was faulted by the one for keeping more troops in Canada than what were necessary. An alternation ensued, and, from what passed, I had every reason to conclude that the number now in Canada, including the garrison of Ticonderoga, does not exceed two thousand. I speak of those in Canada proper, exclusive of the garrison of Oswegatchie, Niagara, and the upper posts, which, from the conversation of these officers, I concluded to be between 1500 and 2000.</P>
<P>Whether it was possible to have sent a body of troops immediately after the Convention of this place to Ti∣conderoga I will not venture n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w to say, but if they had been sent I believe that we should have regained that post; for I learn from a tolerable intelligent countryman just arrived from thence, that the hurry which prevails in embarking their stores in such, that it strongly indicates they are apprehensive of a visit, and will probably abandon it. If so, it argues that they are too weak in Canada to support that garrison in case of an attack.</P>
<P>Impelled, Sir, by that affection for my country, which not all the injuries I have sustained have been able to shake, I venture to suggest to Congress, that I can conceive an irruption into Canada in the ensuing win∣ter would be attended with a variety of happy consequences, which will readily occur to Congress, provided that the force employed be so respectable as to create such a confidence in the Canadians, as would induce them to join our arms for the preservation of the country after we should have entered it. Perhaps five thou∣sand men would be sufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="016142_0056_0F9B8DCF41F772D0"/>I am well aware that a winter's expedition is attended with more difficulties than will offer to a superficial observer; but I am very far from thinking them insurmountable, provided that measures are pursued without delay, and the proper officers exert themselves in the execution of the orders they receive. Congress may, perhaps, determine on such an expedition. I shall therefore take the liberty to say, if they do, that the men who go on this service should, besides their ordinary under-cloaths, be provided each with a good woollen cap, a short, but good, blanket coat, with a cape to turn over the cap, to prevent the snow falling on the neck, each two chequered woollen shirts, a woollen pair of breeches, two pair of good woollen stockings, a pair of Indian legings, so long as to come up to the crotch, a pair of good Indian shoes, and a pair of English shoes, with a pair of good warm socks, and a pair of stout mittens, and not to be suffered to carry any other cloath∣ing. Each man should also have a pair of creepers, a tinder-box or horn, steel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lints, and a bundle of matches to every ten men. One thousand pair of snow shoes should also be provided, 100 pair of skates, 100 hand machines for firing vessels or buildings, 2000 musket wooden cartridges, canes with spikes, to be filled with a combustible composition, to be shot into vessels or buildings. Each man to be also furnished with a powder horn and bullet pouch. Two thousand spare stand of arms should also be carried on, to furnish such Canadians as might be willing to engage with us. All these articles should be collected at Albany, to be delivered to the troops immediately before they are to march. One thousand men should also be sent without delay to Skeensborough, by the way of Fort Ann, from whence they should take down in rafts the boards that remain at the saw-mill near that place, none of which have been destroyed by the enemy, and 16000 are left there, a number sufficient not only to cover the men comfortably, but also the provisions, of which a quantity, suf¦ficient for 5000 men for three months, should be carried to Skeensborough in the course of the winter, and biscuit sent instead of flour. Before the march of the troops from thence, the Commissary should pick of the best pork sufficient for the army for fifteen days, and have it well boiled, then laid out to freeze, and packed up again, that the men may not be under the necessity of cooking on their march.</P>
<P>As it will require 1500 carriages to move such a body of troops, and two of the three months provisions, with all the other stores, a great quantity of hay should be purchased, packed, and disposed of in such place<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as that it might be conveniently taken up by the sleds, whether they come from the Massachusetts or thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> State. Corn, oats and pease should be collected in like manner, and directions given to each driver to bring with him three or four bags. But as I apprehend that a sufficient number of hired sleds could not be conve∣niently procured, I would advise that 500 common co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse sleds, of which a carpenter will easily compleat one in two days, should be made, and 1000 stall fed oxen with yokes be purchased, to draw these sleds, and the oxen killed as soon as the army has penetrated Canada, that the salt provision may be saved as much as possi∣ble, that none may be taken from the Canadians, as I suppose no specie can be procured to pay them. As it is in vain to attempt to carry on such an enterprize in a secret manner, application should be made to the Le∣gislature of Massachusetts and this State to aid in procuring the sleds, that every farmer who is to furnish one may prepare himself in time, and the Committee of each district should be obliged to deliver the sleds they are to furnish at such rendezvous as the officer commanding the expedition should direct.</P>
<P>The whole should be in readiness to move as soon as the Lakes have taken, which will probably be by the middle of February; and if Ticonderoga should be abandoned, the army might move that way, if not, by the way of Castle-Town and Otter-Creek, so as to fall in with the Lake between Crown-Point and the Mouth of Otter-Creek, or, if the Lakes should not be strong enough from thence, then not to approach the Lake until the army reaches Onion River.</P>
<P>If it should be asked what military operations I have in idea to carry on, I would answer, whether Ti∣conderoga is or will be abandoned or not, I would advise in the first place to secure Isle-aux-Noix, and the army to halt there for three or four days, and all the sleds employed to bring timber on it for erecting a fortification; and before the army left it, five or six rows of strong and heavy pickets should be drove in the ship channel, which is there very narrow, and not deep, to prevent the enemy's shipping from getting into the Lake. If St. John's should not be reduced before the spring of the year, as I suspect it would not, at Isle-aux-Noix three hundred men, under the command of a judicious officer, should be left, with directions to fortify himself in the best manner he could. The rest of the army should then proceed towards St. John's, which I suppose the enemy would not abandon; and if it was found impracticable to form the siege, because of the frost and snow, one thousand men should be left to blockade it. The remainder of the army should then proceed to reduce Chamble, which would be the work of a day or two, and then go on to Montreal, and secure what stores might be left there by the enemy, and take all the merchandize that would be useful for the army, and send it to Albany, paying the French merchants a generous price by bills on France, if Congress has a fund there to draw on, as I have been informed they have, nothing to such of the English as have been our enemies, when we were in Canada in 1775 and 1776. When at Montreal, the Com∣manding Officer will be able to judge with certainty what force the enemy can gather in Canada to oppose him, and, if he finds that he can spare a detachment, he should lend it to Oswegatchie, to secure or destroy the enemy's shipping, which are always laid up at that place. This business appears to me of the first im∣portance, as it would not only be a great step towards the reduction of Niagara, if Congress should attempt in the next campaign to get possession of that very important pass, and which, if in our hands, would have a variety of such obvious good consequences that I need not mention them; but it would also be necessary, in order to secure a retreat that way, which, if a retreat is necessary, I would rather wish than by the way of Champlain, if St. John's should hold out so long as that the enemy might send forces into Canada from New-York or elsewhere. It may be asked, why I should with a retreat by Ontario, and how it could be effected? To the first I answer, because measures may be taken to reinforce the army at their arrival at Oswego by troops from Albany, thence to proceed to the reduction of Niagara, if Congress thought proper; if not, they might return by the way of Fort Schuyler. To the second, that all the batteaus in the St. Lawrence, in the vicinity of Montreal, might be collected, and those would probably be sufficient to convey all the troops, if not, an additional number might soon be constructed; and for that and other business one hundred carpenters should be sent with the army into Canada. Nor should the Commanding Officer ne∣glect, when at Montreal, to take hostages from the Cagnawaga and Canaswago Indians, who will be in his power, for their peaceable behaviour, and those should be sent to these parts without delay. If St. John's
<PB N="58" REF="016142_0057_0F9B8E8B2F8F5E88"/>
should be reduced, I think it is pretty certain that a body of troops appearing before Ticonderoga the gar∣rison would surrender, should they not abandon it this fall, or on seeing our preparations for going into Canada. It would therefore be necessary to collect a body of troops, not only for that purpose, if necessary, but, if Ticonderoga should be abandoned, to be sent into Canada, to reinforce the army there in such a manner as that the country might be kept, and, if possible, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge of Quebec undertaken. For the con∣veyance of these troops, batteaus should be built at Fort George, and begun upon as soon as advice is received that the army is got into Canada. But if the army should be obliged to retreat, this expence may be thought needless. Not at all; for, if they retreat by Champlain, they may want boats; if by Ontario, the boats may be easily conveyed into Hudson's river, and from thence into the Mohawk river, to carry on provisions for the troops to go to Niagara, should an expedition be determined on; but whether it is or not, it would be imprudent not to prepare in such a manner as that troops might be sent to Canada, if it should be found necessary.</P>
<P>Congress will perceive that great exertions are necessary for such an enterprize, and that the officer who commands it, let him be who he will, will require assistance. And although I firmly resolve to quit the army as soon as the examination into my conduct shall be made, and not again venture on the boisterous ocean of public life, in which I have been so miserably buffetted by storms, yet, as a private gentleman, and without fee or reward, I will give every aid in my power to procure every necessary, and make use of every exertion for the success of the enterprize, if Congress should think fit to order the attempt to be made.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 12th of January last we did ourselves the honour to inform Congress of the result of our delibera∣tions respecting Indian affairs in this department. They will be pleased to observe, from the inclosed copy of a letter from Mr. Deane, the Interpreter, that our opinion of the temper of the Senecas and Cayugas was but too well founded. Those haughty nations cannot brook the disgrace which they sustained from the militia of Tryon county, under the late brave and worthy General Herkimer, near the German Flats, and from the Garrison of Fort Schuyler, under the command of the gallant Colonel Gansevoort. Their resentment has undoubtedly been highly irritated by the infidious arts and bribes of our enemies, who, at a treaty held at Niagara, and which is just concluded, have had an opportunity to give an edge to their animosity. The On∣ondagoes we are apprehensive will also be drawn in to manifest the same hostile spirit. From these unfavourable circumstances, there is too much reason to believe that an expedition will be formed against the western frontiers of this State, Virginia and Pennsylvania, in concert with the British troops, Ottowas, Chippewas, Wio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dots, Mingoes and other tribes. It is therefore, with the utmost anxiety, that we wait for the direction of Congress in answer to our last dispatches, without which we shall be at an utter loss how to proceed. It is our opinion that vigorous preparations ought to be made, not only to defend the frontiers, but to chastise those nations, by carrying the war, if possible, into their country. Till they feel the power and the just resentment of the United States, there can be no safety for the defenceless inhabitants. The militia, who lost their leaders and many of their bravest men at the German Flats, suffered the additional misfortune of being deprived of their crops. If they should again be called upon in planting or harvest time, their families must be deprived of all subsistence. Indeed, they are very sore from what they have already suffered, and want time to repair their past calamities. Little therefore can be expected from their exertions, willing as they may be to give their aid. The Oneidas and Tuscaroras are still very friendly; but, so far from being capable of an active part, are under well grounded apprehensions of falling victims to the rage of their savage neighbours. They call upon the United States, in whose cause they took up the hatchet, and are in danger, to protect them, and it is become indispensably necessary to erect some fortress, and station a small garrison in their country, for the security of their women and children. We flatter ourselves that the Commanding Officer of this department will have instructions to receive our information, and to make immediate preparations for the defence of the frontiers and protection of our allies. The garrison of Fort Schuyler, which consists only of one regiment, may be able to defend that fortress, but cannot repel the incursions and ravages of the enemy; and, if it should so happen that Tryon county and the western districts of Albany should be deserted, to say nothing of the distress of individuals, the difficulties of supplying the army with flour would be insermount∣able. The treaty will be held about the middle of the month. We cannot defer it long, and shall be reliev∣ed from the utmost anxiety by the instructions from the Honourable Congress, which we hope are on the way, or will be handed to us by the return of this express without loss of time. We must, if left to ourselves, do the best in our power, making use of the liberty given Mr. Duane to alter the speech, so that it may be adapted to circumstances.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO myself the honour to inclose the proceedings of the Commissioners of Indian affairs at the last treaty, held at John's-Town. The Board of Commissioners intended to have addressed the Honourable Congress in an official letter, which was prevented by the departure of Mr. Duane and Mr. Edwards, who were obliged by a sudden thaw to hasten from John's-Town before the business of the Indians was compleated, left the swell∣ing of the rivers should have prevented them from reaching their families.</P>
<P>Mr. Duane, the gentlemen mentioned in the minutes, as well as the Commissioners, were unanimously of opinion that it was absolutely necessary to threaten the savages with chastisement, as the only means left, short of actual chastisement, to induce them to observe a strict neutrality.</P>
<P>Whether it will have the wished for effect, the result of the Council to be held at Onondago, of which we expect to be informed in about forty days, must determine. But, from the accounts received of their hitherto inimical disposition and revengeful resolutions, the gentlemen, I think, unanimously believed that such of the Mohawks as have fled from their country, a majority of the Onondagoes, and the Cayugas and Senecas in ge∣neral, will commence hostilities against us as soon as they conveniently can, and that it would therefore be prudent early to take measures to carry the war into their country, as it would not require a greater body of troops to destroy their towns than what would be necessary to protect the frontier inhabitants, who already labour under the greatest apprehensions that they will soon experience the ravages and cruelty of those barba∣rians. Since my return to this place, I have been honoured with a letter from the Legislature of this State, covering petitions from the inhabitants of Schohary, Cherry-Valley, Charlotte River, Delaware and Harper's Field, praying the Legislature for assistance. As it is not in the power of the Commissioners to afford any aid to these exposed settlements, I have communicated the contents of the letter and petitions to the Marquis de la Fayette, that he may take measures to enable the inhabitants to remain on their plantations.</P>
<P>Before I left John's-Town, an account which we had received that the enemy meant to take post at Os∣wego was confirmed by the information of a trusty Indian, whom I had reason to believe had good autho∣rity for what he asserted. Should this really be the case, there will be little hope left that the Indians will remain neuter. I cannot avoid suggesting, that I suspect the enemy intend to prosecute the plan which the French began in 1753, and to approach our frontiers with a line of sorts, from whence the Indians may be supplied with every necessary, sent out to harrass us, and to which they may retire after an excursion on our frontiers. As such a man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>euvre would not only prove extremely distressing to us, but also oblige us to keep a large body of troops on the interior frontiers, Congress will pardon me if I express a wish that early and most vigorous measures may be taken to counteract it. Perhaps the most, if not the only, effectual means to defeat such an intention of the enemy would be, by sending a respectable army, not only to re∣gain possession of Oswego, but to attempt the reduction of Niagara. The honourable House is too well aware of the various advantages that would result to the States from having that pass in our hands, for me to presume to point out even a single one. I confess that such an expedition would be attended with many difficulties, that many requisites are to be procured, but if men and salted provisions can be procured, I should imagine every thing else might be got in r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adiness by the last of May, provided that orders are given im∣mediately. The enemy's shipping on Ontario might indeed prove troublesome, but not so as to prevent the troops from crossing. It is certain they were not able to do it in 1758, when Colonel Bradstreet took Fort Fron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tenac. If Congress should enter on such a measure, perhaps it might be well to cover the real design by building the boats on Hudson's River, and give out that they are intended for the more speedy convey∣ance of troops up and down that river.</P>
<P>Reflecting that Congress might perhaps have in contemplation the reduction of Niagara, or an expedition into Canada through Ontario, I have engaged Louis (commonly called Colonel Lewis, a friendly Caghna∣waga, and a man of enterprize, who is going into Canada by the way of Oswegatchie, with three or four trusty Oneidas) to burn, if possible, the enemy's vessels on Ontario; if not, to attempt the destruction of those at St. John's; and have promised a thousand dollars in specie as a reward, if the one or the other is ac∣complished. I hope for the approbation of Congress.</P>
<P>Louis, who expects to return in less than forty days, is also charged to bring me the most exact account he can procure of the enemy's force in Canada, the posts occupied by them, and the numbers at each post; to inform himself, if possible, what military operations the enemy mean to prosecute from Canada in the ensuing campaign, and to engage some of our Caghnawaga friends to give the earliest intelligence of the movements of the enemy, and of what provisions and military stores may be sent either to St. John's or up the St. Lawrence.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 7th instant I received a packet, which I believe was dispatched from your office, inclosing several York-Town papers of the 24th ult. which contained copies of Lord North's supposed motion of the 17th of February, of the two hills in consequence thereof, and the resolutions of Congress thereon. I am peculiarly happy that the latter coincides so perfectly with the ideas I had entertained, declared and propagated of the former. I have the further satisfaction to advise Congress that the sentiments of all those of my immediate country, with whom I have conversed on the subject, are similar to mine, and I have not a doubt but that the people in general will think alike on this important subject, notwithstanding the industry of the enemy's agents in spreading the bills through the country, and their insinuations that Great-Britain will yield to every thing except the Independency of the States, and that therefore the sense of the people ought to be taken on that subject. A session of the Superior Court, which is at present held in this city, affords an opportunity of giving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extensive alarm, to guard against the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arious designs of the enemy. I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one of the papers to Chief Justice Jay, who proposed to have it read in Court which I believe has been done. May I be permitted to mention to Congress, that I conceive extensive good consequences would arise if some of the papers were translated into French, and sent into Canada, with so much of the treaty entered into with the

<P>If the business at Onondago terminates according to our wishes, and that the Senecas are willing to enter into an alliance with us, I think no time should be lost to bring them into the field; and therefore wish you to take measures accordingly, by having it hinted to them, that if a body of their warriors would join Gene∣ral Washington it would be an evidence of their sincerity, and an attonement for past misconduct.</P>

<P>I AM just honoured with your favour of the 8th instant, covering the hand-bill and paper referred to. Please to accept of my best congratulatory compliments on events, which promise happiness to America and confusion to her enemies, and my thanks for your polite attention.</P>
<P>I have thought it necessary to advise the Six Nations of Indians of the Alliance with France, and of the rejection of the treaty proposed by Britain. I hope I have not gone beyond the line of my duty, though I have done it without consulting my colleagues, as I apprehended that in waiting their arrival we should lose the opportunity of communicating the intelligence whilst they were convened at Onondago. Copy of what I have said on the occasion I have the honour to inclose.</P>
<P>Your letter to the Commissioners accompanied the other, together with that to Mr. Deane, which will be forwarded to him without delay.</P>

<P>On the 25th instant I received a letter from Mr. Deane, on the 27th one from Mr. Kirkland, and yesterday a second from Mr. Deane, copies of which I have the honour to transmit you. The conduct of the savages is mysterious and embarrassing. The twenty Senecas mentioned in Mr. Deane's last letter as coming down with a prisoner are expected in a few days. I propose detaining them here until the prisoner I wrote for some time ago arrives from the southward. Whilst these people are with us, I do not apprehend that any hostilities will be committed by the others on the frontiers of this State, and perhaps Congress may think it expedient to order troops to be sent up before they return. I think one thousand men, with half the garrison of Fort Schuyler, such militia as may be procured in Tryon county, and some of the Oneidas and Tuscaroras, would be quite sufficient to burn the Cayuga Town and some of the Seneca Villages. Unless those people are made to feel our power, they will, I fear, continue hostile as long as the enemy keep pos∣session of Canada, and afford them such ample supplies as they have hitherto done.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE many thanks to render you for your obliging favour of the 28th ult. which I have just now had the pleasure to receive.</P>
<P>After I had dispatched the letter in which I expressed a wish to have the papers I mentioned translated and sent into Canada, I communicated the matter to Chief Justice Jay. He thought I might with propriety send them into Canada, as they were published, without waiting the direction of Congress. I accordingly col∣lected as many as I could, and sent them to Caghnawaga, with directions how to distribute them in Montreal.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter of the 16th instant, covering resolutions of Congress of the 11th, I had the honour to receive on the 25th at night. I was determined to have commenced my journey to York-Town on this day, but conceive it my duty to delay my departure until the business directed to the attention of the Com∣missioners of Indian affairs is adjusted.</P>
<P>Congress will be pleased to pardon me, if I presume to observe that the object of the expedition, being con∣fined to the chastisement of the Senecas only, does not seem to be broad enough, as the Cayugas are equally inso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent and hostile, and that some of the Onondagoes are also proper objects of punishment. Both of these lie directly in the route to the Seneca country.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty to inclose General Gates copy of a letter last night received from Mr. Deane (copy of which I have also the honour herewith to transmit to Congress) and observed that, from the in∣formation it contained, the prosecuting of the expedition with all possible dispatch seems to have become now more indispensibly necessary.</P>
<P>I have also hinted that the real object of the enterprize ought to be carefully concealed. I do not adduce the reasons, as they will occur, or probably have already occurred.</P>
<P>I do not know if General Gates will consider himself at liberty to order Colonel Gansevoort's regiment as part of the troops for this service. As it is numerous, and I believe well appointed, may I be permitted to wish that they were employed on this occasion, and that orders be given for the purpose. There can be no danger of Fort Schuyler, whilst the troops for the expedition are in that part of the country, and I humbly apprehend it might be safely trusted to a corps of militia, especially if two or three of Colonel Gansevoort's officers were left, with about twenty-five of his privates.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="016142_0060_0F9B8E8E8B2CCB48"/>As the batteaus which were ordered to be built in this quarter are not all finished, I have taken the liberty to advise the Quarter Master to construct the remainder in such manner as to adapt them to the navigation of the Mohawk river, where they will be wanted to convey the provisions, &amp;c. to Fort Schuyler, which appears to me without comparison to be the best, if not the only proper place to rendezvous the troops, both on account of its vicinity to the road leading to the Seneca country, and as it offers a fine opportunity effectually to con∣ceal the object of the expedition until the troops are in march.</P>
<P>If the Senecas, who went from hence to Head-Quarters, are not yet advertised of the death of the Chief they are in search of, I wish them to be detained as long as possible. Perhaps a pretence of sending an ex∣press to Fort Pitt to enquire for the Indian may answer the end.</P>

<P>Major General Schuyler requests that Major General St. Clair may be sworn.</P>
<P>Major General St. Clair being sworn,</P>
<P>Q. by General Schuyler. During the time I had the honour of having you under my command, did you ever observe any neglect of duty in my conduct?</P>
<P>A. None. As far as it fell within my observation, I have seen the direct contrary.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's question. If I had been in Ticonderoga during the siege, what would have been the probable consequences?</P>
<P>A. The immediate consequences, it appears to me, must have been, that the rest of the department must have been neglected; because your post ought to have been at or near Albany, to have collected the necessa∣ries, and to have urged on the militia for the aid of the whole. Ticonderoga was at a corner of the depart∣ment, in an uninhabited part of the country, and the communication to it from any part of the country (ex∣cept New-England) across a Lake.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's question. Upon any alarm, did I turn out myself and the troops with any degree of alacrity?</P>
<P>A. Whenever there was an alarm, and I was present, I have always seen you do it with great alacrity, and you were always present yourself.</P>
<P>Q. Court. What did you understand the intention of the order of Congress was, in appointing you to the command of Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. I understood it was that I should take the command of that post, subject to the orders of General Schuyler, or the Commanding Officer in the Northern Department; but I did not expect that he, or the Com∣manding Officer, was personally to have taken the command of that post from me.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's question to Major Lansing. Were you at Fort Edward with me immediately after the evacuation of Ticonderoga?</P>
<P>A. I was.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's question. Did you at that time, or at any time before or since, observe any negligence in my conduct with respect to public matters?</P>
<P>A. I did not; but at that time, and at every other time before and since, I observed in you the greatest attention to public matters, as far as came within my observation.</P>
<P>General Schuyler's question. Did I not, immediately after I returned from Ticonderoga, on being inform∣ed of the approach of the enemy, make application to the State of New-York, and to the other States, to endeavour to get out the militia?</P>
<P>A. You did to the State of New-York and to the Eastern States, except Rhode-Island, immediately on your return to Saratoga, on being informed of the enemy's approach.</P>
<P>After the examination of the above witnesses, the General closes his Defence as follows:</P>
<P>It is incumbent on me to remark that the observation made by the Judge Advocate, that I went to Ti∣conderoga in consequence of General St. Clair's letters of the 13th or 18th June, is founded in error, which will appear by a retrospect of my letter to Congress of the 14th from Saratoga, in which I expresly in∣formed them that I arrived at that place on the evening of the 13th, on my way to Ticonderoga, and that at twelve I received an express from General St. Clair, with his letters of the 13th.</P>
<P>Permit me, Mr. President, and Gentlemen of the Court Martial, briefly to observe, that from the beginning of November, 1776, to the latter end of March following, which was a month after I was superceded, my exertions to prepare for the campaign of 1777 were without intermission. That immediately on my re∣appointment I returned to Albany, and adopted every possible measure to provide the necessaries for the cam∣paign, to procure intelligence of the enemy's intentions, and to conciliate the affections, or guard against the hostile intentions, of the Indians; that within eight days after my arrival at Albany I went to visit Ticonderoga and the northern communication, that I might be personally informed of what was necessary to be provided or done; that I was on the point of doing the like to Fort Schuyler and the western commu∣nication, when General St. Clair's letter arrived, advising me of the approach of the enemy; that I lost not a moment's time in applying for reinforcements both of continental troops and militia; that I was on the way to put myself at the head of the small body of militia which had moved, when I received the account of the evacuation of Ticonderoga; that after that my exertions to prevent or retard the enemy's progress were without intermission, and not without success, until I was, unhappily for me, no longer permitted to di∣rect the military operations in the Northern Department; that from that time until this day I have never ceased affording every aid in my power to give success to the glorious cause America is engaged in.</P>
<P>Here, Gentlemen, I shall rest my defence. It has indeed been prolix, but important. Facts and plain narrative, not declamation, have made it so. My whole conduct has been, with the utmost candour, submit∣ted to your examination, and I hope the result of this enquiry will restore me to that full confidence, which, at least, the rectitude of my intentions gives me reason to expect. I forbear dwelling on the causes to which its diminution is to be ascribed, lest I should be suspected of a design rather to reproach than explain. What∣ever may be time event, permit me to assure you that my affection for my country will continue unimpaired,
<PB N="62" REF="016142_0061_0F9B8E8EE92D0400"/>
and that among the latest actions of my life will be found the most sincere endeavours to promote her prosperity.</P>
<P>I cannot dismiss this subject, without acknowledging my obligations for the candour and patience with which I have been heard, or without expressing the high sense I entertain of the attention of his Excellency the Commander in Chief, in instituting so respectable a Court on my trial.</P>
<P>THE Court, having considered the charge against Major General Schuyler, the evidence, and his de∣fence, are unanimously of opinion that he is NOT GUILTY of any Neglect of Duty in not being at Ticonderoga, as charged, and the Court therefore do acquit him with the highest honour.</P>
