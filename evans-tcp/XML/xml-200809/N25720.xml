<L>Our ship we moor, our sails we hand,</L>
<L>Whilst out the boat is hoisting;</L>
<L>With cheerful hearts the shore we reach,</L>
<L>Our friends delighted greet us;</L>
<L>And tripping lightly o'er the beach,</L>
<L>The pretty lasses meet us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When the full-flowing bowl enlivens the soul,</L>

<HEAD>SOUNDING THE BOWL.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IF a sailor would not like a lubber appear,</L>
<L>He must very well know how to hand, reef, and steer</L>
<L>But a better manoeuvre 'mongst seamen are found,</L>
<L>'Tis the tight little maxim to know how to sound;</L>
<L>Which a sailor should learn, from a bay to a shoal,</L>
<L>But the best kind of sounding is sounding the bowl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I've sounded ashore, and I've sounded at sea,</L>
<L>I've sounded a-weather, I've sounded a-lee;</L>
<L>I've sounded my quine at the rendezvous house,</L>
<L>And I've sounded my purse, without finding a souse;</L>
<L>What then, we've a brother in each honest soul,</L>
<L>And sailors can ne'er want for sounding the bowl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All men try for sounding, wherever they steer,</L>
<L>Your Nabobs for soundings try hard in Cape Clear;</L>
<L>And there is not a soul, from the Devil to the Pope,</L>
<L>That could live but for sounding the Cape of Good-Hope;</L>
<L>Nor fear then, nor danger, our hearts shall controul,</L>
<L>Tho' at sea we're in soundings, while sounding the bowl.</L>
