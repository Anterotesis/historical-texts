<BIBL><HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. 17.</BIBL>
<Q>And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come. And let him that hear∣eth, say, Come. And let him that is athirst, come: And whosoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOLOMON observeth, that <HI>as cold Waters are to a thirsty Soul; so is good News from a far Country.</HI> We have here good News indeed from the high∣est Heaven, for the sinful Children of Men who have forsaken GOD the Fountain of living Wa∣ters, for broken Cisterns that can hold no Water; and are now in Danger of perishing in the Flames of Hell without a Drop of Water, without the least Mitigation of their Torment. Behold! the Son of GOD hath ta∣ken our Nature, and purchas'd the HOLY SPIRIT in his Graces and Comforts; and inviteth us to come, and take these Waters freely. This Chapter is the last in the Bi∣ble, and closeth the whole Canon of sacred Scripture. Worthy Expositors apprehend that we have here a further Description of the glorious Joy and consummate Happi∣ness of the heavenly <HI>Paradise,</HI> which is abundantly re∣freshed with a pure River of Water of Life proceeding
<PB N="6" REF="005057_0004_101692FC1D407EB0"/>
out of the Throne of GOD, and of the LAMB! All our Springs are in GOD, the Fountain of Grace and Glory. <HI>In his Presence is Fulness of Joy, and at his right Hand are Pleasures forevermore.</HI> Psalm 16. 11. There is also the <HI>Tree of Life;</HI> GOD's People eat freely of the Fruits of it, and live forever. And there shall be <HI>no more Curse.</HI> No Tempter shall ever approach that high and holy Place, no Sin shall ever defile it; and therefore it must be forever free from all the Fruits of the Curse. There shall be <HI>no Night</HI> there, and therefore no Need of a Candle. Nor is there any Need of the Light of the Sun to make and rule the Day. No! No! that GOD who <HI>is Light,</HI> and in whom is <HI>no Darkness</HI> at all, forever shineth in his meridian Brightness. The Father of Lights with whom is no Shadow of turning makes one perma∣nent and eternal Day in which not the least Cloud inter∣poseth to hide the Light of his Countenance from his People. But is it possible that any of us the Children of Apostate <HI>Adam,</HI> who was thrust out of the earthly Para∣dise for his first Transgression, in which we were all in∣volved; I say is it possible, that we should ever inhabit the heavenly Paradise? Yes! Yes! the Son of GOD came down from Heaven, and in our Nature was obedi∣ent to Death, yea was laid in the Grave; that he might raise us up to sit with him in those heavenly Places. And now the Spirit and the Bride say, <HI>Come.</HI> Descend, O blessed Spirit of GOD! and raise us above the dead∣ning Influence of earthly Things; refresh our Souls with these living Waters, and we will run the Race set before us, till we enter in through the Gates into that City, of which such glorious Things are spoken in the Word of GOD. But to return, In the Words, we have a most gracious Invitation given us to come, and take the Wa∣ters of Life freely. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride say, Come,</HI> —The HOLY SPIRIT of GOD who indited the Scrip∣tures, speaks in them; <HI>The Holy Ghost faith, To Day if ye will hear his Voice, Harden not your Hearts.</HI> Heb. 3, 7, 8. And the Spirit exciteth holy Desires in the Church who is the Bride, the Lamb's Wife; and accordingly the Church and every true Believer, say, Come. They look and long for CHRIST'S Appearing, and for the further

Manifestations of his Favour unto them. And when GOD's People have tasted that the LORD is gracious, they are desirous that others should come, and see how good the LORD is. When JESUS had revealed himself to the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> and given her the Water of Life; she went her Way into the City, and said to the Men, <HI>Come</HI>—John 4. 28, 9. <HI>And let him that is athirst, Come.</HI>—All such as feel their Want of CHRIST and his saving Benefits, and have earnest Desires after them, are here invited to come; which we do by Faith, when we go out of ourselves as to any carnal Dependance upon our own Righteousness and Strength, and go to GOD by JESUS CHRIST as to the Fountain of all saving Good. We have then a general Invitation, <HI>And who soever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</HI> GOD will not im∣pose and force the Blessings of the Gospel upon any, whe∣ther they will or no; but then all such as thirst after them, and are willing to receive them upon Gospel Terms, may come and welcome: And none need be discouraged because they have no Money or valuable Price to lay down to purchase them. No, these are all purchased by JESUS CHRIST at the Price of his most precious Blood; and they are offered to us as a free Gift, which we must heartily accept as it is offered. And if by the Grace of GOD we do this, they became our's. If CHRIST and his Benefits were set to Sale, we poor perishing Sinners might well despair, and say our Hope is perished; but now that our LORD offereth himself and all saving Good freely, even the chief of Sinners should be encouraged to hearken to this most gracious Invitation. By the <HI>Water of Life</HI> we may understand the spiritual Blessings purchased by CHRIST, and commu∣nicated by his SPIRIT. John 4. 10. <HI>If thou knewest the Gift of GOD, and who it is that faith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living Water. 7. 38, 39. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Water. But this spake be of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005057_0006_1016930272422E30"/>DOCT. <HI>All such as thirst after CHRIST, and his saving Benefits; are invited to come, and take the Wa∣ters of Life freely.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. What are we to understand by the Waters of Life? II. In what Respects may CHRIST and his Benefits be compared to Waters of Life? III. Who are they that thirst? IV. Shew that such are invited to come, and take these Waters of Life freely.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What we are to understand by the Waters of Life?</HI> A. <HI>The saving Benefits which JESUS CHRIST hath purchased for his People, which he reveals and offers in the Gospel, and communicateth by his Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The saving Benefits which JESUS CHRIST hath purchased for his People.</HI></P>
<P>The blessed GOD is in Scripture represented to us un∣der this Similitude, the <HI>Fountain of living Waters;</HI> and he is in CHRIST JESUS a <HI>Fountain open'd</HI> for the full Supply of such sinful miserable Creatures as we are. The Son of GOD having taken our Nature, and been obedi∣ent unto Death, hath purchased Grace and Glory, and every good Thing for his People. And accordingly <HI>as Mediator</HI> he hath a Fulness of all spiritual Blessings to be∣stow on his People. Col. 1. 19. <HI>For it pleased the Father, that in him should all Fulness dwell.</HI> And he received that he mignt give. John 1. 16. <HI>And of his Fulness have all we received and Grace for Grace.</HI> GOD blesseth his People with all spiritual Blessings in him. And we have accordingly the Blessings of the <HI>Messiah's</HI> Kingdom shadowed forth to us under those Similitudes. Isa. 32. 2. <HI>A Man shall be as Rivers of Water in a dry Place.</HI> Zech. 13. 1. <HI>In that Day there shall be a Fountain opened to the House of David, and to the Inhabitants of Jerusalem, for Sin, and for Uncleanness.</HI> This prophetical Promise looks forward to the Gospel-Day. And by the Fountain o∣pened we may un lerstand JESUS CHRIST, in the Merits of his Death, and Communications of his Spirit and Grace, revealed under the Gospel-Dispensation. The Son of GOD came by Water and by Blood that he might wash his People from the Guilt and Pollution of Sin, and pu∣rify to himself, a peculiar People, and zealous of good
<PB N="9" REF="005057_0007_101693051B735418"/>
Works. Eph. 5. 25—27. <HI>CHRIST also loved the Church, and gave himself for it: that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word, that he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any such Thing; but that it should be holy and without Blemish.</HI> Whatever are our spiritual Wants, in CHRIST there is a full Supply for us. Are you sensible of your Ignorance and Folly? CHRIST is of GOD made to his People <HI>wisdom.</HI> Are you sensible of your Guilt, and need of a perfect Righteousness for your Justification before GOD? CHRIST is of GOD made to his People <HI>Righteousness.</HI> Are you sensible of the dreadful Pollution of Sin, and do you feel your need of that Holiness without which none shall see the Lord? CHRIST is of GOD, made to his People <HI>sanctification.</HI> Are you sensible that you were sold under Sin, and do you groan after Deliverance from this worse than Egyptian Bondage? CHRIST is of GOD made to his People <HI>Redemption.</HI> I Cor. 1. 30.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It intends those Blessings which are revealed, and offer∣ed in the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>The Gospel of CHRIST, and the Ordinances therein appointed, are as the Conduit-Pipes thro' which GOD is pleas'd to convey the Blessings purchas'd by CHRIST, unto his chosen People. The <HI>Word, Sacraments</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> are the ordinary Means of Grace: And it is in the diligent Use of these that GOD's People must wait upon him for spiritual Blessings. Agreably, when it is said, <HI>Come to the Waters.</HI> Isai. 55. 1. One sense given of the Place is, "Come to the holy Ordinances." And when GOD is graciously present in and with his Ordinances, his People are satisfied with the Fatness of his House, and made <HI>to drink of the River of his Pleasures.</HI> Ps. 36. 8. They draw Water out of the Wells of Salva∣tion with Joy. But if GOD deny his gracious presence and Blessing, these outward Means are as <HI>Wells without Water,</HI> and as Clouds without Rain, which can afford no spiritual Refreshment to our Souls.</P>
<P N="3">3. By these Waters we may understand <HI>the communi∣cations of the Spirit of Christ to his People.</HI></P>
<P>By the Spirit, who is also a divine Person, our Lord
<PB N="10" REF="005057_0008_1016930800EC7728"/>
JESUS communicateth to his People the saving Bene∣fits which he hath purchased for them. Tit. 3. 5, 6. <HI>Not by Works of Righteousness, which we have done, but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of Rege∣neration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly, thro'</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>our Saviour.</HI> And we accordingly find that the Gift of the Holy Ghost was the great and comprehensive Blessing which our Lord JESUS promised to his Disciples, when he was about to leave this World, and go to the Father. John 16.7. <HI>Nevertheless, I tell you the Truth; it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</HI> And this glori∣ous Person who is one with the Father and the Son in the essential Perfections of the divine Nature, is said to be sent and given with Respect to the free Communicati∣on of his Gifts and Graces and Comforts. And in this Respect, is he fitly compared to Water in the sacred Writings. Isa. 44. 3. <HI>I will pour Water upon him that is thirsty, and Floods upon the dry Ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Blessing upon thine Offspring.</HI> John 7. 37—39. <HI>In the last Day, that great Day of the Feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any Man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Water. But this spake he of the Spirit.</HI> And very fitly may these gracious Influences be compared to Water, living Water; For by the Holy Spirit GOD cleanseth the Souls of his People from the moral Defile∣ments of Sin, refresheth and reviveth the thirsty, and maketh his People fruitful in spiritual Knowledge, Righ∣teousaess and Holiness. When the Spirit is poured on GOD's People from on High, the Wilderness becometh a fruitful Field. But this brings me to the second Thing.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>In what Respects may the saving Benefits of</HI> CHRIST <HI>communicated by the Spirit, be compared to Water of Life?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Upon the Account of the absolute Need we stand in of them, for our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>Our outward Man can't subsist and hold together in vital Union, without Water; no more can our inward
<PB N="11" REF="005057_0009_101693098AC602C8"/>
Man, our Souls live in a spiritual Sense, without these Waters of Life. The beginning, Increase and Perfect on of the spiritual Life entirely depend on these divine In∣fluences. Unless it pleased GOD to visit the Earth, and water it; we could not have Food for Man, or Beast; but must perish with Famine. And without an Interest in CHRIST, and his saving Benefits, we must pine away, and perish forever in our Sins. This is the one Thing needful.</P>
<P N="2">2. These Blessings may be compar'd to Water <HI>for the great Value, and extensive Usefulness of them.</HI></P>
<P>This Particular is nearly related to the former; how∣ever, I shall labour to consider it with some Variety.</P>
<P>It is worthy our thankful Observation, that our bounti∣ful GOD hath given us those Things which are most useful to Mankind in the greatest Abundance, and so made them cheap to us, tho' most valuable in themselves; as the Light and Heat of the Sun, the Rain of Heaven, and living Springs of Water from the Earth. Water is of great Use, and extensive Benefit to us. Our Drink is Water either pure from the Spring, or differently prepared by Nature, or Art. And of how great Use to keep us clean and sweet in this dirty World? And if I might be allow'd something further to enlarge the Metaphor beyond what is especially pointed to in the Text, of how great Use is Water for Trade and Commerce? Surely we depend much upon it under GOD, for the Supports and Comforts of Life. But if we consider the Usefulness of this <HI>Element</HI> after the most extensive Manner, it affords us but a defective Representation of the great Usefulness of CHRIST, and his saving Benefits, which comprehend in them a full Supply for all our Spiritual Wants; every Thing we need for the Healing, the Nourishing &amp; Refresh∣ment of our precious Souls; And all of inestimable Va∣lue, notwithstanding ignorant and profane Sinners make so small Account of these Things, I need not declare to you how pleasant cool Waters are to the thirsty. Such as have been parched under the painful Sense of GOD's fiery Indignation due for Sin, and then enabled to take the Waters of Life freely, will acknowledge the great Delight and Satisfaction they have received from them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="005057_0010_1016930D761352A0"/>3. These Blessings may be compared to Water of Life, <HI>for their healing, cleansing Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>There are medicinal Waters, <HI>Baths</HI> that have an heal∣ing Virtue. And such are the Waters of the Fountain of Life which is open'd in CHRIST JESUS, and flow down to his People in the gracious Influences of his Spi∣rit. The Faculties of our Souls are weakned and depra∣ved by Sin. We are in a spiritual Sense <HI>full of Wounds, and Bruises, and putrisying Sores.</HI> See Isa. 1. 5, 6. The Eyes are blinded, the Ears are dull of hearing, the Heart is hard, the Passions are distempered with a feverish Heat of carnal Concupiscence, and the Head is seized as with a deadly Lethargy, which renders us stupid and sense∣less with Respect to spiritual Things. In a Word, The Disease is mortal, and unless a Remedy be provided and applied, the second Death will follow. But now these Waters of Life are of sovereign Virtue to heal these Ma∣ladies, and all that receive them shall be made whole. There was a <HI>Pool</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> call'd <HI>Bethesda,</HI> in the Use of which GOD was pleased miraculously to heal the Diseases of his People. <HI>John</HI> 5. JESUS whose divine Power seem'd to be represented by the Waters of this Pool, saw the impotent Man lying by it, and said to him, <HI>Rise, take up thy Bed and walk.</HI> ver. 8. We are here a Number of impotent diseased Creatures, as it were lying at the Pool, while we are attending the Ordinances of God's House. May the Power of CHRIST be present to heal us! May these Waters of Life which flow from this Al∣mighty Saviour be applied to us to recover us from our spiritual Blindness of Mind, and Hardness of Heart! you that complain of your spiritual Maladies; come to these Waters; wash in this <HI>Jordan,</HI> and your Souls shall be cleansed and healed. Thus in <HI>Ezekiel's Visiion</HI> of the holy Waters, it is said, that <HI>where these Waters shall come, they shall be healed.</HI> Ezek. 47. 9.</P>
<P N="4">4. These spiritual Blessings may be compared to Wa∣ter of Life, <HI>as they restore spiritual Life to such as were dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Sinners are in Scripture compar'd to <HI>sick Men,</HI> as the Strength and Beauty of their Souls are impair'd by their spiritual Maladies, and yet there is Hope of Recovery by
<PB N="13" REF="005057_0011_101693102FBBC1D0"/>
CHRIST, the Lord our Healer; And they are compar'd to <HI>dead Men</HI> as they are <HI>wholly depriv'd of spiritual Life,</HI> have no true holy Love to GOD or other Graces in them; and are under the Curse of the Law. And accordingly the Virtue of these living and Life-giving Waters exceeds all the Powers of Nature. There are Waters in the Kingdom of Nature which have a Virtue to heal some bodily Maladies by the Blessing of GOD's common Pro∣vidence upholding and drawing forth the Virtues in them; but none that can restore Life when the vital Union be∣tween Soul and Body is dissolved. This Work is wholly supernatural; and so is the spiritual Resurrection of Souls, when GOD quickens them that are dead in Sin. Well then may these divine Influences be called Waters of Life, as they communicate Life to Souis spiritually dead. Thus it is said of those holy Waters which rose and in∣creased till they became a River which could not be passed over. Ezek. 47. 9. <HI>Every Thing shall live whither the River cometh.</HI> When our Lord JESUS poureth out his Spirit, Men are <HI>born of Water, and of the Spirit.</HI> John 3. 5. When the Spirit is thus given like Water, there's a new Life communicated by which true Converts re∣semble the blessed GOD, and live to him; They now receive a Power of spiritual Perceptions Operations and Enjoyments, which they had not before. Now they may say in some Measure with the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Gal. 2. 20. <HI>I live, yet not I, but CHRIST liveth in me; and the Life which I now live in the Flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of GOD, who loved me and gave himself for me..</HI> O GOD, thou GOD of Salvation, to whom belong the Issues from Death! Pour out thy Spirit and Blessing upon us, and we shall live to shew forth thy Praise.</P>
<P N="5">5. These spiritual Blessings may be compar'd to Water of Life, <HI>as they continue, and spring up into everlasting Life.</HI></P>
<P>Waters sed by living Springs continue, and flow from Age to Age; while Waters from a sudden Rain are soon dried up, and fail. Agreeably <HI>Job</HI> complains of his Friends, chap. 6. 15—17. <HI>My Brethren have dealt de∣ceitfully as a Brook, and as the Stream of Brooks they pass away; Which are blackish by Reason of the Ice, and wherein the Snow is bid; What Time they wax warm, they vanish;</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="005057_0012_10169311BA459A40"/>
<HI>when it is hot, they are consumed out of their Place.</HI> Such are our Creature-Comforts, they soon become as broken Cisterns which can hold no Water. But now with GOD is the Spring of Life, and the living Waters which flow from him are pure, and they never wholly fail. John 4. 14. <HI>But whosoever drinketh of the Water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the Water that I shall give him, shall be in him a Well of Water springing up into everlasting Life.</HI> When our Lord says, that such shall never thirst, it can't intend that such shall have no further Desires after the Graces and Comforts of the Spirit. No, it is a Pro∣perty of Grace to desire to grow and increase in spiritual Blessings; But then it may intend that such as receive this Gift of GOD, shall never more be wholly deprived of it. He may thirst for GOD more and more, and GOD will give the Desires of his Heart. He may com∣plain that GOD is withdrawn, but shall never have just Reason to say that GOD hath wholly forsaken him. No, GOD will never leave him 'till he hath raised him to his glorious Presence in Heaven, where is <HI>Fulness of Joys, and Pleasures evermore.</HI> He shall never thirst after the Things of this World, as he did before. Such as have tasted how good and gracious the Lord is, will rather say as Jer. 18. 14. <HI>Will a Man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the Rock of the Field? or shall the cold flowing Waters that come from another Place, be for saken?</HI> No surely, GOD's Children prefer these pure and living Waters to all the Delights of this Earth which are foul and muddy, and soon pass away. When the Spirit of GOD is given to dwell in the Hearts of his People, he is in them as a Well of Water, or living Spring that can never be drawn dry. The Spirit of GOD abides in his People forever to maintain and increase the Life of Grace until it shall be perfected in Glory.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>What is implied in thirsting? Who are they that thirst?</HI></P>
<P>Before I answer particularly to this Enquiry, I would say; we all know something of what natural Thirst means, when we feel a Desire of Drink, of some natu∣ral Moisture, by Reason of Drought. Now this hath been
<PB N="15" REF="005057_0013_10169315D593AE80"/>
accounted one of the most peremptory Demands of Na∣ture, and such as soon becometh intolerable if wholly de∣nied. Accordingly, We may be said to thirst in a spiri∣tual Sense, when under a painful Sense of our spiritual Wants and Miseries, we earnestly desire and long after JESUS CHRIST and his saving Benefits; his Righteous∣ness, and the Graces and Comforts of his Spirit.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>It supposeth a painful Sense and Feeling of our spiri∣tual Wants and Miseries.</HI></P>
<P>When we have been a considerable Time without Drink, especially when hot and weary, we feel the pain∣ful Sense of it. And thus such as thirst in a spiritual Sense have an afflicting Sense of their great Wants, in being without CHRIST, destitute of the Graces and Comforts of the Spirit, and expos'd to the Wrath and Curse of GOD. Indeed the Souls of Men since the Fall are so blinded and depraved by Sin, that they do not feel their Need of an Interest in CHRIST, and his saving Benefits; altho' they are pining away in their Iniquities. Give them sensual Satisfactions and earthly Pleasures, and they are ready to imagine that all is well, and that they have need of nothing. As the rich Fool was ready to bless himself. Luke 12. 19. <HI>Soul thou hast much Goods laid up for many Years; take thine Ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</HI> Thus the secure Sinner feedeth of Ashes, while a de∣ceived Heart turns him aside, that he cant deliver his Soul, nor say, is there not a Lie in my right Hand? But when the Spirit of GOD convinced Men of their Sin and Misery, and shews them their imminent Danger of perishing for ever; when he binds their Sins upon their Consciences, and makes them feel something of the Heat of GOD's Anger; then they find that this World with all its Enjoyments, is a dry and thirsty Land wherein is no Water, no true Satisfaction for their Souls. Now they complain with the Psalmist, Psal. 32.4. <HI>Day and Night thy Hand was heavy upon me; My Moisture is turned into the Drought of summer.</HI> Now they labour, and are heavy laden under the Burden of their Sins; and are convinced that they must languish and die forever, unless it please GOD to give them CHRIST, and his saving Benefits.
<PB N="16" REF="005057_0014_1016931872A28A28"/>
They find that in departing from GOD, they have for∣saken their own Mercies for lying Vanities, the Fountain of living Waters for broken Cisterns that can hold no Water. The Description given of them that were pain∣ed with Thirst in a proper Sense, agreeth well with the Condition of these Sinners. Psalm 107. 5. <HI>Thirsty, their Soul fainted in them.</HI> They find that the Threatnings of GOD's fiery Law are pointed at them, while out of CHRIST, and their Conferences are set on Fire as it were with ter∣rible Apprehensions of GOD's Wrath which burns to the lowest Hell. Their own Righteousnesses appear as filthy Rags, altogether insufficient to cover and defend them. And their outward Performance of religious Du∣ties can't give them Relief. They are ready to cry out with the Psalmist 38. 3, 4. <HI>There is no Soundness in my Flesh, because of thine Anger, neither is there any Rest in my Bones, because of my Sin. For mine Iniquities are gone over my Head: as an heavy Burden they are too heavy for me.</HI> They are perplexed finding themselves in a miserable Case, in a Wilderness where there is no Water. Their sorrowful Case is well described Isai. 41. 17. <HI>The Poor and Needy seek Water, and there is none, and their Tongue faileth for Thirst.</HI> Now they are made sensible that unless the Almighty GOD open a Fountain to them, and sup∣ply their Wants, they must perish under them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This Thirst implieth, that we earnestly desire and long after</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and his saving Benefits.</HI></P>
<P>We have King <HI>David</HI>'s Thirst expressed in longing Desires. 2 Sam. 23. 15. <HI>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me Drink of the Water of the Well of Beth-lehem, which is by the Gate.</HI> Agreeably, when Men thirst after CHRIST, his Righteousness and Grace, they have longing Desires after these spiritual Blessings; yea such as can not be satisfied with any Thing short of CHRIST, and the Gift of the Holy Ghost. Thirst is such a Demand of Nature as nothing can satisfy but that which is suited to quench it. If you should offer to one tormented with it, Thousands of Silver and Gold, this could not make him easy; He must perish with intolle∣rable Pain, unless you give him Drink. And what Good then could the whole World do him? And thus such as
<PB N="17" REF="005057_0015_1016931C35B37F60"/>
thirst after CHRIST, are so sensible of their Need of him that nothing can give Rest to their weary Souls but an Interest in him, and his saving Benefits. Now they are ready to say, What shall it profit us to gain the World, and lose our Souls? And what shall we give in Exchange for our Soul? Now they long after CHRIST as the only and All-sufficient Saviour, and are ready to say, Give us CHRIST, or we die, we are lost and undone forever. Now the Favour of GOD in CHRIST is in their Esteem better than Life, and they say, <HI>Whom have we in Heaven but thee? There's none upon Earth we desire besides thee.</HI> Our Flesh and Heart are ready to fail. O save us, or we perish! We have the strong Desires of one pursued by threatning Evils express'd in this Manner. Psalm 42. 1, 2. <HI>As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, so panteth my Soul after thee, O GOD. My Soul thirsteth for GOD, for the living GOD; when shall I come and appear before GOD?</HI> The Hart or Deer is naturally hot and thirsty, es∣pecially when pursued. In like Manner, when GOD's People find themselves pursued by deadly Enemies, and have been wearied in seeking Relief from Creatures, and then are convinced that there's Rest for their weary Souls in CHRIST alone; they long after him, and the Influ∣ences of his <HI>Spirit.</HI> Now the Lord JESUS is precious to them as he saveth from Sin, and the Wrath to come; as he gives Pardon and Peace, Grace and Comfort. And they pant after the living Waters he bestows; yea, these Desires are active, and powerfully incline the Thirsty to seek JESUS early, and the Favour of GOD in him. Thus when <HI>David</HI> thirsted for GOD, he says, <HI>Early will I seek thee.</HI> Nor can such be satisfied till they obtain an Inter∣est in CHRIST, and his saving Benefits.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Thirsty are satisfied when</HI> CHRIST <HI>draweth nigh to them, and communicates the Graces and Comforts of his Spirit to their Souls.</HI></P>
<P>Cool Waters are not so pleasant to the Thirsty, as CHRIST and his Grace are to such as labour and are heavy laden under the Sense of Sin. When the Son of GOD reveals himself to such as their only Saviour, they find Rest and Refreshment in him, as in one every Way able to supply their spiritual Wants, and fill their empty Souls with Good.
<PB N="18" REF="005057_0016_101692F119760160"/>
Now they begin to feel the Truth and strong Consolation of those Words, John 6. 34. <HI>And he said unto them, I am the Bread of Life; be that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, shall never thirst.</HI> Indeed they desire the Favour of GOD in CHRIST more and more; but then they resolve they will go no whither else for the Waters of Life; In him they happily find a Fountain opened that can never be drawn dry. And the Lan∣guage of their Souls is, ever give us this Water, give thy Spirit more abundantly. When the royal Psalmist had said to GOD, <HI>my Flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty Land, where no Water is;</HI> He well expresseth the Satisfaction he should take in the Communications of GOD's Favour, Psalm 63. 3. <HI>Because thy loving Kindness is better than Life; my Lips shall praise thee.</HI> And V. 5. <HI>My Soul shall be satisfied as with Marrow and Fatness; and my Mouth shall praise thee with joyful Lips.</HI> How re∣freshing are Pardon and Grace to such as were ready to sink under the heavy Burden of Sin! O how chearfully do they submit to CHRIST's Yoke finding it easy, and his Burden light, compared with that intollerable Load which before lay upon them. I trust I may appeal to the Experience of Numbers here present, and inquire whether you have not found more true Satisfaction in looking to JESUS CHRIST in the Exercise of Faith and godly Sorrow for Sin, than ever you did in gratifying your foolish and hurtful Lusts, Mat. 5. 6. <HI>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after Righteousness; for they shall be filled.</HI> CHRIST, his Righteousness and Grace fill and satisfy the Soul. When Men pant after the Things of this World as their chosen Portion and Happiness, they are deluded as with Dreams and Shadows. That Description agreeth well to their Case, Isa. 29.8. <HI>It shall be even as when a hun∣gry Man dreameth, and behold he eateth; but he awaketh, and behold his Soul is empty; Or as when a thirsty Man dreameth, and behold he drinketh; but he awaketh, and be∣hold he is faint, and his Soul hath Appetite.</HI> But when thirsty Souls drink of the Water of Life, they obtain some fore-tastes of the Joys of Heaven, Psalm 36. 8. <HI>They shall be abundantly satisfied with the Fatness of thy House; and thou shall make them drink of the River of thy Pleasure;.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="19" REF="005057_0017_1016665BC9FF43E0"/>IV. <HI>We proceed in the last Place to shew that such as thirst are invited to come and take the Water of Life freely.</HI></P>
<P>How full and general is the Invitation! Here is <HI>Come</HI> three Times over. The Spirit and the Bride say, <HI>Come.</HI> And such as hear and believe the Word of GOD, are exhor∣ted to say, <HI>Come.</HI> To every one that thirsteth, it is said, <HI>Come.</HI> And then all that are willing, are invited to take the Water of Life freely. And altho' some Expo∣sitors understand the first <HI>Come,</HI> of CHRIST's coming; yet I can't see why all may not unite to encourage thirsty Souls to go to CHRIST for the Water of Life. When the Son of GOD was upon Earth in his human Nature, <HI>He stood and cried, saying If any Man thirst let him come unto me, and drink.</HI> Joh. 7.37. And now that he is ascended into Heaven, he continueth to invite Sinners in the most Condescending Manner, to come to him; and promiseth Rev. 21. 6. <HI>I will give unto him that is athirst of the Foun∣tain of the Water of Life freely.</HI> When the thirsty are invited to come, it may then intend that they are invited to go to CHRIST, and so to receive the Water of Life. Accordingly we may under this Head of Discourse inquire 1. What is implied in coming or going to CHRIST? 2. Shew that all who are athirst, are invited to go to him, and take the Water of Life freely.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What is implied in coming, or going to</HI> CHRIST? <HI>Or what is the coming to Christ here pressed upon us?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>It is a spiritual Motion of the Soul by which the Be∣liever, for saking other Things, repairs unto</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>to trust in him alone for Salvation, upon the Command and Promise of GOD's Word.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is a spiritual Motion of the Soul.</HI></P>
<P>It is in the Exercise of Faith that we go to JESUS CHRIST. Thus our Saviour himself explains the Meta∣phor. John 6. 35. <HI>He that cometh to me shall never bur∣ger; and he that believeth on me, sball never thirst.</HI></P>
<P>Again, <HI>In going to</HI> CHRIST, <HI>must for sake other Thing; as vain and unable to save us.</HI></P>
<P>Men are very prone to place carnal Confidence in their earthly Enjoyments, in themselves, in their outward reli∣gious Privileges, Duties, and Reformations. But in order to our going to CHRIST, we must be convinced that a
<PB N="20" REF="005057_0018_10169321CE011928"/>
vain shall we hope for Salvation from these Things; and accordingly we must be sensible that these are but Refuges of Lies, if placed in the Room of CHRIST; And therefore while we wait upon GOD in the Use of the Means of Grace, we must take heed we do not <HI>stop here;</HI> but must fly to CHRIST as the only City of Refuge, when the Law, and our own Consciences condemn us, We must go to JESUS, sensible that there is <HI>none other Name under Heaven among Men whereby we must be saved.</HI> Acts 4.12.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>We must trust in</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>alone, and have our whole Dependance on him for Salvation</HI></P>
<P>We must say as <HI>Peter</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Twelve,</HI> Joh. 6. 68. <HI>Lord, to whom shall we go? thou bast the Words of eternal Life.</HI> Convinced of our Guilt, and ut∣ter Impotency to every Thing spiritually good, we must go out to CHRIST, to trust in him for <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Strength.</HI> Such as obey this Gospel-Call, trust in the Name of the LORD, and stay upon him as the LORD their <HI>Righ∣teousness.</HI> Gal. 2.16. <HI>Knowing that a Man is not justified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ; that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law; for by the Works of the Law shall no Flesh be justified.</HI> And they also depend on JESUS as their Head of Influence, from whom they must receive Grace to work out their own Salvation. While at this Work, they look to their Saviour, to work in them to will and to do.</P>
<P>And lastly, <HI>We must go to</HI> CHRIST <HI>upon the Command and promise of GOD's Word.</HI></P>
<P>Sensible of our spiritual Poverty and Wretchedness, we must take our Encouragement, not from any pretended Worthiness of our own; but from GOD, his infinite Perfections, his most gracious Call and Invitation, his Command and Promise. 1 John 3. 23. <HI>This is his Com∣mandment, that we should believe on the Name of his Son Je∣sus Christ.</HI> He that cometh to CHRIST, goeth in Obe∣dience to GOD's Authority; He says, tho' I am un∣worthy to obtain Salvation by JESUS CHRIST, yet surely GOD is worthy to be obeyed; and it is he that com∣mands Men to arise, and go to CHRIST. He also takes Encouragement from the Promises of that GOD who
<PB N="21" REF="005057_0019_101693246E2BFA10"/>
cannot lie. He receiveth the Record which GOD hath given of his Son, that in him there is eternal Life, and that who soever believeth in him shall be saved. And as he realiseth CHRIST's Ability to save, so he relieth upon his Word as faithful and true, John 6. 37. <HI>Him that com∣eth to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> And thus he that Com∣eth to CHRIST, receiveth him as offered in the Gospel.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such as thirst are invited thus to come, and take the Water of Life freely.</HI></P>
<P>The Invitation extends to all that do not wilfully ex∣cept themselves. All that live within the Sound of the Gospel, and who are sensible of their spiritual Wants, are invited. <HI>He every one that thirsteth, come to the Waters.</HI> All such as are under legal Convictions and Terrors, are invited to go weary and heavy laden to CHRIST. Surely then when Men are beaten off from all their carnal Con∣fidences, and made willing to go out to CHRIST as wretch∣ed and miserable in themselves, to receive these living Wa∣ters as the free Gift of GOD. I say, surely these shall not be sent empty away. No, GOD will rather work Miracles of Grace, than these should perish with Thirst, Is a 41. 17, 18. <HI>When the Poor and Needy seek Water, and there is none, and their Tongue faileth for Thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the GOD of Israel will not for sake them. I will open Rivers in high Places, and Fountains in the midst of the Valleys; I will make the Wilderness a Pool of Water, and the dry Land Springs of Water.</HI> All such as are heartily willing to receive CHRIST, whole CHRIST, will be made welcome, <HI>Who soever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</HI> My Hearers! GOD is in earnest, be you so too. I declare to you in the Name of the Lord, that you shall all have your own Choice. One hearty Consent of Soul secureth a Title to CHRIST, and his sav∣ing Benefits, John 3. 36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting Life.</HI> If any of you perish in your Sin, it must be <HI>because you will not come to Christ, that you may have Life,</HI> John 5. 40. Thousands and ten Thousands have obey'd GOD's Voice, and not an Instance can be given of so much as one single Person that has been rejec∣ted. Let us then with one Heart and Voice lift up a Cry to the GOD of all Grace, <HI>Lord, make us willing in the Day of thy Power!</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>Use 1. <HI>Behold, and admire the Fulness and Riches of the Grace of GOD in Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The Father of Glory hath given his only begotten Son to die for us. The Son of GOD hath in our Nature been obedient to Death, that he might open the Fountain of Grace and Mercy for the full Supply of all our Wants. And now the Spirit and the Bride say, <HI>Come</HI> — O the Riches of the Grace of GOD in CHRIST! All the spiri∣tual and eternal Blessings of the Gospel are freely offered, freely given. Let us not then despise the Riches of GOD's Goodness, nor turn his Grace into Wantonness; but let us be drawn by this Grace, as with the Cords of a Man, and the Bands of Love.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us inquire whether we thirst after Christ, and his saving Benefits?</HI></P>
<P>Such, we have heard, are invited to come, and assured they shall be welcome. Let us then examine whether we have had a painful Sense of our spiritual Wants and Miseries? Have we felt the Burden of our Sins, and been convinced, that we must perish forever unless GOD re∣lieve us? Have we accordingly longed after CHRIST, and his Righteousness and Grace, as the Blessings which alone can satisfy our thirsty Souls? Are we bro't off from trusting to our own Duties and Privileges? And can we now say that nothing short of an Interest in CHRIST shall satisfy us? Do we thus continue following the Lord, resolving by his Grace that we will never go from him to seek our Happiness in Creatures? But that if he casts us off, we will go mourning all our Days. If this be the Case, GOD will sooner or later satisfy the longing Soul. Our Saviour pronounceth such blessed, and they shall be blessed. <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let what hath been said encourage such as have a pain∣ful Sense of their spiritual Wants, to go to Christ that they may be filled.</HI> Do not sit down discouraged; but arise, and go to CHRIST. Behold! he calls, and most graci∣ously invites you to come. <HI>If any Man thrist, let him come to me, and drink.</HI> It is true, you can't go in your own Strength, Joh. 6. 44. <HI>No Man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him.</HI> But GOD can
<PB N="23" REF="005057_0021_10169328ABE5E270"/>
by his Spirit persuade and enable you, more easily than you can speak a Word. Look up to the Lord then in earnest Prayer, and say as Cant. 1. 4. <HI>Draw me, we will run after thee; the King hath brought me into his Chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy Love more than Wine; the Upright love thee.</HI> You may depend upon it, GOD your Saviour is sincere in this Invi∣tation. The Son of GOD in our Nature, fulfilled all Righteousness, and endured the Curse, that he might bless his People with all spiritual Blessings. When our Lord suffered upon the Cross, he said, <HI>I thirst.</HI> And surely he will not refuse to satisfy the longing Desires of his People that go to him. Let not then the Sense of your Wants and Unworthiness hinder you; for CHRIST hath purchased these Blessings for such as you, and inviteth you to come and take them freely. Did he die to purchase them for needy perishing Sinners, and will he reject such when they come to him for them? Far be such a Tho't from us. What you have to do is in a believing humble Manner to receive what is freely offered you. And here I may further say, that the more pressing and urgent your Necessities are, the more Haste you should make to CHRIST; and the deeper Sense you have of these Wants, the greater Encou∣ragement have you that you shall be made welcome; for thus runs the Promise, Psalm 81. 10. <HI>Open thy Mouth wide, and I will fill it.</HI> The Fountain is still open, and full as ever. The Merits and Righteousness of CHRIST have lost nothing of their Virtue, by being communicated to such vast Numbers; and the Influences of the blessed Spirit of GOD are as powerful to cleanse and refresh your Souls, as ever they were. And I may add, that the present <HI>remarkable Day of Grace,</HI> in which GOD is giving spiri∣tual Blessings with a liberal Hand, may well encourage you to go to GOD as to a Fountain opened in CHRIST for the Supply of all your Wants. O be persuaded then to hearken and consider, to hear and obey the Calls of the Gospel, that your Souls may live! O let it not be said that while many others thankfully accept the Invitations of the Gospel, that you reject them. <HI>How shall you escape, if you neglect so great Salvation?</HI> Certainly you will not be able to escape the Damnation of Hell; yea, you must
<PB N="24" REF="005057_0022_1016932A47C7E9B0"/>
receive a double Damnation, as you are under the Curse of the Law, and will then be found Despisers of the Grace of the Gospel.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let those of us who are invited to sit down at the Lord's Table the next Sabbath, look to it that we go to that holy Feast with earnest Desires after Christ, and the Blessings which flow from his Death.</HI></P>
<P>In this Ordinance we have a Feast on that Sacrifice which CHRIST offered once for all, and are invited to eat and drink his Flesh and Blood after a spiritual Manner, which are Meat and Drink indeed. But then, we must open our Hearts to the Lord Jesus, then he will come in to us, and will sup with us, and we with him. <HI>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting Doors, and the King of Glory shall come in.</HI> Psal. 24. 7. Let every Heart be consecrated as a living Temple unto him, then this King of Glory will be both our Companion, and our Feast. He will say to us, as Cant. 5. 1. <HI>Eat, O Friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly, O Beloved.</HI> And by Com∣munion with the Father and the Son in this holy Ordi∣nance, we shall be prepared for that glorious Place and State of which we read, Rev. 7. 15—17. <HI>Therefore are they before the Throne of GOD, and serve him Day and Night in his Temple; and he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto Fountains of living Waters; and GOD shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</HI></P>
