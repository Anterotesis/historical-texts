<HEAD>THE TREATY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Deputies of the Six Nations having, at their last Visit, agreed to release their Claim to all the Land on both Sides of the River <HI>Sasquehanab,</HI> as far South as this Province extends, and to the Northward to those called the <HI>Endless Mountains</HI> or <HI>Kittochtinny Hills</HI>; in Consideration whereof, they then received a large Quantity of valuable Indian Goods for the Lands situate on the Eastern Side of the said River, but declined at that Time to receive any for those on the Western Side of the said River, chusing to defer the same till another Visit; A large Number arrived from these Nations at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 30<HI>th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> with Depu∣ties duly impowered to receive the said Goods; and acquainted the Gover∣nor, that being weary from the Fatigue of their long Journey, they should crave three or four Days to rest themselves before they proceeded to their Bu∣siness: In the mean time they would wait on the Governor to discourse, ac∣cording to their usual Method, about News and other Occurrences; which the Governor readily agreed to, and ask'd them when they would chuse to pay their first Visit; which they desiring might be on <HI>Friday:</HI> the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>July</HI> in the Afternoon, the Council was accordingly summon'd, and met at Mr. <HI>Logan's</HI> House, where were</P>

<P>The Governor opened the Conference as follows.</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietor having purchased certain Lands from your Nations about Six Years ago, a Moiety of what was agreed to be given in Consideration <PB N="4" REF="005216_0004_101714408A40B5C8"/>of that Purchase was at that Time delivered to them, and the other being at their own Desire left in the Proprietor's Hands, He pressed you by <HI>Shi∣kalamy</HI> to send last Year for it, and would have been glad to have seen you and taken you by the Hand before his Departure. But as the Design of this Meeting is to hear your News and converse together in a free and friend∣ly Manner, I shall say no more about the Goods than that they lye ready at the Proprietor's House, and will be delivered when you shall have suffici∣ently rested from the Fatigue of your Journey.</P></Q>
<P>The Chief of the <HI>Onondagoes</HI> spoke</P>
<P><Q><HI>BRETHREN,</HI> We propose to rest four Days, and then come to the main Business. At present we are at a private Conference about News, and have something of this Sort to mention to our Brother <HI>Onas.</HI></Q> And on the Governor's signify∣ing they would be glad to know what it was, the Chief proceeded.</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>It is our Way when we come to our Brethren, or any other Persons, whom we live in strict Friendship with, to remove all Obstructions to a good Un∣derstanding; with this View we are to inform you of a Piece of disa reta∣ble News that happen'd in our Journey.—Some White People living at a Place called <HI>Conegocheegoe,</HI> whose Names we cannot tell, nor whether they belong to this or the neighbouring Government, but one of them, as we heard, had his House burnt over his Head some Years ago, and he was brought down a Prisoner and committed to the Goal of this City: These People lighting of our young Warriours, as they were hunting, made some Proposals about the Purchasing of Land from them, and our young Men being indiscreet, and unacquainted with Publick Business, were foolish enough to hearken to them, and to receive five Duffil Strowds for two Plantations on the River <HI>Cohongoronto.</HI> A <HI>Conestogoe</HI> Indian, and a <HI>French</HI> Indian, and some others that were in Company had three Duffil Strowds, and went a∣way with them; and our young Men carried off the other two. As soon as this came to our Knowledge, we sent for our Warriours, and after examin∣ing and rebuking them severely, we took away their two Strowds, and publickly censured them for exposing us to our Brethren of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> in doing a Thing so inconsistent with our Engagements to them; <Q>You are, said we aloud, that all our People might hear and take Notice, to know and remember, that the Six Nations have obliged themselves to sell none of the Land that falls within the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to any other but our Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> and that to sell Lands to any other is an high Breach of the League of Friendship.</Q> Brethren, this rash Proceeding of our young Men makes us ashamed. We always mean well, and shall perform faith∣fully what we have promised: And we assure you, this Affair was transac∣ted in the Manner we have related, without our Privity or Consent. And that you may be fully convinced of this, and of the Sincerity of our Intenti∣ons, we have brought you these Two Strowds [<HI>here be presented two Red Strowds to the Governor</HI>] they are the very Strowds our foolish young Men received; we took them from them, and we give them to you to return to those white People who made the Bargain, and desire when the Strowds
<PB N="5" REF="005216_0005_101714426DFC7600"/>
are returned to them, they may be told what we now say, and that we shall not confirm such Bargains nor any other that may interfere with our En∣gagements to our Brother <HI>Onas.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Governor then spoke:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for this Piece of News; you have taken this Matter perfect∣ly right. All Bargaining for Land within this Province, is, to be sure, a manifest Breach of your Contract with the Proprietors, and what we know you will not countenance. We have hitherto found the <HI>Six Nations</HI> faith∣ful to their Engagements, and this is a fresh Instance of their Punctuality. You could not help these Mistakes of your young Men; they were not done in your Presence: But as several Inconveniences may arise from these kind of clandestine Sales, or from any such loose Sales of Land by your People, we desire you will, on your Return home, give publick Notice to all your Warriours not to bargain for any Land; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if they do, that you will not confirm su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Bargains; and that this very Affair, together with what you have done therein, may be particularly reported to all your Nation as∣sembled in Council.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Onondago</HI> Chief promised to give such publick Notice; and de∣siring Liberty to mend his former Speech, he proceeded:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>I forgot one Circumstance: Our People who pretended to sell the Land, demanded a Belt of Wampum of the Buyers to carry to their Chiefs; and on their declaring they had no Wampum, our Warriours said, they would not answer that their Chiefs would confirm this Bargain, since they never did any thing of this Nature without Wampum.</P></Q>
<P>The Governor, after a short Pause, spoke:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN of the Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>I shall take this Opportunity to relate to you a Piece of disagreeable News I re∣ceived some Days ago in a Letter from <HI>Le Tort</HI> the Indian Trader, at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> who says, <Q>That in <HI>May</HI> last some Indians of the <HI>Taway</HI> Nation, suppos∣ed by us to be the <HI>Twightwees,</HI> in their Return from War, called and stay∣ed some Time with the <HI>Shawanese</HI>; who being asked, and denying they had brought either Scalps or Prisoners, the <HI>Shawanese</HI> suspecting them, had the Curiosity to search their Bags, and finding two Scalps in them that by the Softness of the Hair did not feel like Indian Scalps, they wash'd them clean and found them to be the Scalps of some Christians. On this Disco∣very, the <HI>Twightwees</HI> were so much ashamed, that they stole away from their Town in the Night-time; and coming, as they afterwards un∣derstood, to a little Village belonging to the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> they told our Peo∣ple that their Hearts were full of Grief; for, as they came along the Road, they found it all bloody; and having good Cause to believe it was made bloody with the Blood of some of the White Brethren, they had very sorrowfully swept the Road; and desired them to inform the Governor of <HI>Pensilvania</HI> of their (the <HI>Twightwees</HI>) Grief; and how they had swept 
<PB N="6" REF="005216_0006_10171443F9F3C8F0"/>
the Road clean.</Q> <HI>Le Tort</HI> adds, on Behalf of the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> <Q>That they were much troubled and grieved at this unfortunate Accident; and prayed, as they had no Concern in it, more than by being Instruments to discover it, their Brethren would not blame them, nor suffer a Misunder∣standing to arise between them on this Account: They would sweep the Road clean, and wipe all the Blood away; and desired their Brethren would be satisfied with this, and not weep too much for a Misfortune that might not happen again as long as the Sun and Moon shone.</Q></P>
<P>The Person who delivered me <HI>Le Tort</HI>'s Letter, brought this Bundle of Skins as a Present to me; but I told the Messenger, I would not meddle with it; he might leave it if he pleased: The Affair appear'd to me in a bad Light, and I would represent it to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> who were expec∣ted in Town every Day. This is the Fact as I have it from <HI>Le Tort:</HI> I desire to be inform'd if you know any thing of this Matter; and if you do not, that you will make diligent Enquiry who committed the Murder, and who are the unhappy Sufferers, and assist us to obtain Satisfaction, if it shall appear to be any of our Fellow-Subjects that have been treated in this Manner.</P></Q>
<P><HI>To inforce this Request, I present you with this String of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Onondago</HI> Chief, in Reply, said:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>We take this Information kindly at your Hands; we will take this String of Wampum Home with us to our Lodgings, and there consult about the most regular and proper Steps to be taken by us to answer your Expectations; and when we have duly considered the Matter, we will return you an Answer.</P></Q>
<P>Upon this the Governor put an End to the Conference; and calling for Wine and other Liquors, according to the <HI>Indian</HI> Custom, after a decent and chearful Entertainment, the <HI>Indians</HI> withdrew.</P>

<P>It being judg'd proper, at this critical Time, when we are in daily Expec∣tation of a <HI>French</HI> War, to sound the <HI>Indians,</HI> and discover what Depen∣dance we might have on them, in case their Aid should be wanted; an hand∣some

Dinner was provided for their Chiefs; and after they had made an hearty Meal, and drank his Majesty's Health, the Proprietors, and the Health of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> the Chiefs gave the solemn Cry, in Testimony of their Thanks, for the Honour done them. And soon after the Governor began, in a free Way, to enquire for what Reason the <HI>Senecas</HI> were not come down, since they had an equal Right to a Share of the Goods with the other Nations.—<HI>Canassateego,</HI> their Speaker, said, <Q>The <HI>Senecas</HI> were in great Distress, on Account of a Famine that raged in their Country, which had reduced them to such Want, that a Father had been obliged to kill two of his Children to preserve his own and the rest of his Family's Lives; and they could not now come down, but had given Directions about their Share of the Goods.</Q>—The Governor express'd his Concern for the un∣happy Circumstances of their Brethren of the <HI>Seneca</HI> Nation; and, after a short Respite, enquired if any of their Deputies were then at <HI>Canada,</HI> and whether the <HI>French</HI> Governor was making any warlike Preparations. And on their answering, <HI>Yes</HI>; the Governor said, with a smiling, pleasant Counte∣nance, <Q>I suppose if the <HI>French</HI> should go to War with us, you will join them.</Q> The <HI>Indians</HI> conferr'd together for some Time, and then <HI>Canassa∣teego,</HI> in a chearful lively Manner, made Answer.—<Q>We assure you, the Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> pays our Nations great Court at this Time, well knowing of what Consequence we are to the <HI>French</HI> Interest: He has al∣ready told us, he was uncovering the Hatchet and sharpening it, and hoped, if he should be obliged to lift it up against the <HI>English,</HI> their Nations would remain neuter and assist neither Side.—But we will now speak plainly to our Brethren: Why should we, who are one Flesh with you, refuse to help you, whenever you want our Assistance?— We have continued a long Time in the strictest League of Amity and Friendship with you, and we shall always be faithful and true to you our old and good Allies.—The Governor of <HI>Canada</HI> talks a great deal, but ten of his Words do not go so far as one of yours.—We do not look towards them; We look towards you; and you may depend on our Assistance.</Q> Whilst the <HI>Onondago</HI> Chief made this open and hearty Declaration, all the other <HI>Indians</HI> made frequently that particular Kind of Noise which is known to be a Mark of Approbation.—The Governor bid the Interpreter tell <HI>Ca∣nassateego,</HI> <Q>He did not set on foot this Enquiry from any Suspicion he had of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> wanting a due Regard for the <HI>English.</HI>—Our Experi∣ence of their Honour and Faith would not permit us to think any other of them than that they would esteem our Friends their Friends, and our Enemies their Enemies, agreeable to the strict Union which had ever sub∣sisted between us.—As to the Governor of <HI>Canada,</HI> they need not mind what he said.—The <HI>English,</HI> on equal Terms, had beat the <HI>French,</HI> and could beat them again: And were they but to consider the Advantages which the <HI>English</HI> have, by possessing so many large and populous Countries and so many good Ports on the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> they would soon see who had most Reason to fear a War, the <HI>French</HI> or the <HI>English.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here the Conversation drop'd; and, after another Glass of Wine, the <HI>In∣dians</HI> resumed the Discourse, by asking whether their Brethren had not been for some time engaged in a War with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and what Successes they had met with.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005216_0008_10171451A49C8B18"/>
The Governor told them, the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> lived in an Island, and being surrounded with the Sea, his chief Strength lay in his Ships; in which he was so much superior to his Enemies, that they were seldom to be met with on the broad Ocean, but sculk'd and hid themselves, only venturing out now and then; and whenever they did they were almost sure to be ta∣ken; and that the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> had, with his Ships, beat down or taken several of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Great Forts in <HI>America.</HI>—The <HI>Indians</HI> said, they were pleased to hear their Brethren were an Over-match for their Ene∣mies, and wish'd them good Success.</P>
<P>The Governor then inquired into the State and Condition of the Nations to the Westward of the Great Lakes, and whether they had any Warriours then in those Countries? Whether they had concluded Peace with the Southern <HI>Indians?</HI> And whether they had heard what their Deputies had done at <HI>Albany?</HI></P>
<P>They made Answer: That they had always Abundance of their Men out amongst the Nations situate to the West of their Lakes.—That they had kindled a Fire with a vast many Nations, some whereof were Tributaries, and they had a good Understanding with all.—They set out from their own Country in Company with two Sets of Deputies, one going to hold a Treaty with the Southern <HI>Indians,</HI> and they believed a Peace would be concluded: The other going to meet the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> at <HI>Albany</HI>; but they could not tell what had been done at either Place.—On their Return, they were to hold a General Council, and would inform their Brethren of these Particulars.</P>
<P>Then the Governor put an End to the Conference, by telling the <HI>Indians</HI> the Goods would be delivered to them at a Council to be held to morrow Afternoon at the Meeting-House.</P>

The Governor, having commanded Silence, spoke as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>Friends and Brethren of the Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>Six Years ago a Number of your Chiefs obliged us with a Visit, when they agreed, on Behalf of your Nations, to the Release of certain Lands on both Sides the River <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> to the Southward of the <HI>Endless∣Mountains,</HI> and within the Limits and Bounds of the King's Grant of this Province. In Consideration of which, a certain Quantity of Goods was agreed on and delivered as a full Satisfaction for the said Lands lying on the Eastern Side of the said River: And for the Lands on the Western Side of the said River, you desired the Payment should be deferr'd sill another Op∣portunity. These Goods, which are exactly the same in Quantity as those you received the last Time the Chiefs of your Nations were here, have been ready a considerable Time, and kept in Expectation of your Coming for them: And now you are come down fully impowered by your respective Councils to receive them, we are well pleased to deliver them: Leaving it to you to make a fair and equal Division of them amongst yourselves. We are sorry for the Absence of our Brethren the <HI>Senecas,</HI> and much more so that it should be owing to their Distress at Home by a Famine that rages in their Country:—A Famine so great that you tell us a Father has been obliged to sacrifice one Part of his Family, even his own Children, for the Support and Preservation of himself, and the other Part.—We heartily commiserate their Condition, and do not doubt but you will do them fair and ample Justice in the Disposal of their Part of the Goods in such Manner as they have instructed you. You shall now hear the List of the Goods read to you.</P></Q>
<P>Here, by the Governor's Order, the List of the Goods was read over, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>500 <HI>Pounds of Powder.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>600 <HI>Pounds of Lead.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>Then the Governor told them that the Goods, of which the Particulars had been just read to them, were in the Meeting-House, and would be sent to whatever Place they would direct.</P>
<P>The Governor then proceeded:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>You have often heard of the Care that your great and good Friend and Brother <HI>William Penn</HI> took at all Times to cultivate a perfect good Har∣mony with all the <HI>Indians:</HI> Of this your Nations have ever been fully sen∣sible; but more especially a Number of your Chiefs, about ten Years ago,
<PB N="11" REF="005216_0011_101714584AEDAB20"/>
when, on the Arrival of a Son of your said great Friend <HI>William Penn,</HI> large and valuable Presents were exchanged by us with you; a new Road was made and clear'd; a new Fire kindled; and the Chain of Friendship made stronger so as to last while the Sun and Moon endure.</P>
<P>And now we cannot but congratulate ourselves that your Coming should happen at a Time when we are in daily Expectation of a War being de∣clared between the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, well knowing that should such a War happen, it must very sensibly affect you, considering your Situation in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Canada.</HI> Your Coming at this Juncture is particularly fortunate, since it gives us an Opportunity of mentioning several Things that may be necessary to be settled between People so strictly and closely united as we are.—An Union not to be ex∣press'd by any thing less than the affectionate Regards which Children of the same Parents bear for each other, as conceiving ourselves to be one Flesh and one People.</P>
<P>The utmost Care therefore ought mutually to be taken by us on both Sides, that the Road between us be kept perfectly clear and open, and no Lets nor the least Obstruction be suffered to lie in the Way; or if any should by Accident be found, that may hinder our free Intercourse and Correspondence, it must forthwith be removed.</P></Q>
<P>To inforce this, We lay down a String of Wampum.</P>
<Q><P>In next Place, We, on our Part, shall inlarge our Fire that burns be∣tween us. We shall provide more Fewel to increase it and make it burn brighter and clearer, and give a stronger and more lasting Light and Warmth.</P></Q>
<P>In Evidence of our sincere Intentions, We lay down this Belt of Wampum.</P>
<Q><P>In the last Place, considering the Obligations we are mutually under by our several Treaties, "That we should hear with our Ears for you, and you hear with your Ears for us." We shall at all Times very willingly give you the earliest and best Intelligence of any Designs that may be form'd to your Disadvantage.—And if you discover any Preparations that can hurt us, we desire you will immediately dispatch some suitable Person in whom we can place a Confidence, to give us a proper Information.</P></Q>
<P>To inforce this Request, as well as to brighten the Chain, we lay down this other Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P>On the Governor's concluding the Speech, the solemn Cry by way of Approbation was repeated by the <HI>Indians</HI> as many Times as there were Na∣tions present; and then <HI>Canassateego</HI> rose up and spoke.</P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>We thank you for your kind Speech: What you have said is very agree∣able to us; and to-morrow when we have deliberated on the several Mat∣ters recommended to us, we will give you our Answer. We desire, as our Time will be wholly taken up in Council, you will order the Goods to be carried back to the Proprietaries to prevent their being lost, and that they may continue there till we call for them.</P></Q>

<P><HI>CANASSATEEGO</HI>'s Speech on Behalf of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN, the Governor and Council, and all present,</P>
<P>According to our Promise we now propose to return you an Answer to the several Things mentioned to us Yesterday, and shall beg Leave to speak to Publick Affairs first, tho' they were what you spoke to last. On this Head you Yesterday put us in Mind, first, <Q>Of <HI>William Penn</HI>'s early and constant Care to cultivate Friendship with all the <HI>Indians</HI>; of the Treaty we held with one of his Sons, about ten Years ago; and of the Necessity there is at this Time of keeping the Roads between us clear and free from all Obstructions.</Q> We are all very sensible of the kind Regard that good Man <HI>William Penn</HI> had for all the <HI>Indians,</HI> and cannot but be pleased to find that his Children have the same. We well remember the Treaty you mention held with his Son on his Arrival here, by which we confirmed our League of Friendship that is to last as long as the Sun and Moon endure: In Consequence of this, We, on our Part, shall preserve the Road free from all Incumbrances; in Confirmation whereof we lay down this String of Wampum.</P>
<P>You in the next Place said you would inlarge the Fire and make it burn brighter, which we are pleased to hear you mention; and assure you, we shall do the same, by adding to it more Fewel, that it may still flame out more strongly than ever: In the last Place, you were pleased to say that we are bound, by the strictest Leagues, to watch for each others Preserva∣tion; that we should hear with our Ears for you, and you hear with your Ears for us: This is equally agreeable to us; and we shall not fail to give you early Intelligence whenever any thing of Consequence comes to our Knowledge: And to encourage you to do the same, and to nourish in your Hearts what you have spoke to us with your Tongues, about the Renewal of our Amity and the Brightening of the Chain of Friendship; we confirm what we have said with another Belt of Wampum.</P>
<P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>We received from the Proprietors, yesterday, some Goods in Considera∣tion of our Release of the Lands on the West-Side of <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> It is true we have the full Quantity according to Agreement; but if the Pro∣prietor had been here himself, we think, in Regard of our Numbers and Poverty, he would have made an Addition to them.—If the Goods were only to be divided amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> present, a single Person would have but a small Portion; but if you consider what Numbers are left behind, equally entitled with us to a Share, there will be extremely little. We therefore desire, if you have the Keys of the Proprietor's Chest, you will open it, and take out a little more for us.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005216_0013_1017145C344C5610"/>
We know our Lands are now become more valuable: The white People think we do not know their Value; but we are sensible that the Land is everlasting, and the few Goods we receive for it are soon worn out and gone. For the Future we will sell no Lands but when Brother <HI>Onas</HI> is in the Country; and we will know beforehand the Quantity of the Goods we are to receive. Besides, we are not well used with respect to the Lands still unsold by us. Your People daily settle on these Lands, and spoil our Hunting.—We must insist on your Removing them, as you know they have no Right to settle to the Northward of <HI>Kittochtinny-Hills.</HI>—In particular, we renew our Complaints against some People who are settled at <HI>Juniata,</HI> a Branch of <HI>Sasquahannah,</HI> and all along the Banks of that River, as far as <HI>Mahaniay</HI>; and desire they may be forthwith made to go off the Land; for they do great Damage to our Cousins the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>We have further to observe, with respect to the Lands lying on the West Side of <HI>Sasquahannah,</HI> that tho' Brother <HI>Onas</HI> (meaning the Proprietor) has paid us for what his People possess, yet some Parts of that Country have been taken up by Persons whose Place of Residence is to the South of this Province, from whom we have never received any Consideration. This Affair was recommended to you by our Chiefs at our last Treaty; and you then, at our earnest Desire, promised to write a Letter to that Person who has the Authority over those People, and to procure us his Answer: As we have never heard from you on this Head, we want to know what you have done in it. If you have not done any thing, we now renew our Request, and desire you will inform the Person whose People are seated on our Lands, that that Country belongs to us, in Right of Conquest; we having bought it with our Blood, and taken it from our Enemies in fair War; and we expect, as Owners of that Land, to receive such a Consideration for it as the Land is worth. We desire you will press him to send us a positive Answer: Let him say <HI>Yes</HI> or <HI>No</HI>: If he says Yes, we we will treat with him; if No, we are able to do ourselves Justice; and we will do it, by going to take Payment ourselves.</P>
<P>It is customary with us to make a Present of Skins whenever we renew our Treaties. We are ashamed to offer our Brethren so few; but your Horses and Cows have eat the Grass our Deer used to feed on. This has made them scarce, and will, we hope, plead in Excuse for our not bringing a larger Quantity: If we could have spared more we would have given more; but we are really poor; and desire you'll not consider the Quantity, but, few as they are, accept them in Testimony of our Regard.</P></Q>
<P>Here they gave the Governor a Bundle of Skins.</P>
<P>The Governor immediately replied:</P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>We thank you for the many Declarations of Respect you have given us in this solemn Renewal of our Treaties: We receive, and shall keep your String and Belts of Wampum, as Pledges of your Sincerity, and desire those we gave you may be carefully preserved, as Testimonies of ours.</P>
<P>In Answer to what you say about the Proprietaries.—They are all ab∣sent, and have taken the Keys of their Chest with them; so that we can∣not,
<PB N="14" REF="005216_0014_101714638CB40788"/>
on their Behalf, enlarge the Quantity of Goods: Were they here, they might, perhaps, be more generous; but we cannot be liberal for them.—The Government will, however, take your Request into Consider∣ation, and, in Regard to your Poverty, may perhaps make you a Present. I but just mention this now, intending to refer this Part of your Speech to be answered at our next Meeting.</P>
<P>The Number of Guns, as well as every thing else, answers exactly with the Particulars specified in your Deed of Conveyance, which is more than was agreed to be given you. It was your own Sentiments, that the Lands on the West Side of <HI>Sasquahannah</HI> were not so valuable as those on the East; and an Abatement was to be made, proportionable to the Difference in Value: But the Proprietor overlooked this, and ordered the sull Quantity to be delivered, which you will look on as a Favour.</P>
<P>It is very true, that Lands are of late become more valuable; but what raises their Value? Is it not entirely owing to the Industry and La∣bour used by the white People in their Cultivation and Improvement? Had not they come amongst you, these Lands would have been of no Use to you, any further than to maintain you. And is there not, now you have sold so much, enough left for all the Purposes of Living?—What you say of the Goods, that they are soon worn out, is applicable to every thing; but you know very well, that they cost a great deal Money, and the Value of Land is no more than it is worth in Money.</P>
<P>On your former Complaints against People's Setling the Lands on <HI>Ju∣niata,</HI> and from thence all along on the River <HI>Sasquahannah</HI> as far as <HI>Ma∣hania<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> some Magistrates were sent expressly to remove them; and we thought no Persons would presume to stay after that.</P></Q>
<P>Here they interrupted the Governor, and said:—<Q>These Persons who were sent did not do their Duty: So far from removing the People, they made Surveys for themselves, and they are in League with the Trespassers. We desire more effectual Methods may be used, and honester Persons imploy'd.</Q></P>
<P>Which the Governor promised, and then proceeded:</P>
<Q><P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>According to the Promise made at our last Treaty with you, Mr. <HI>Logan,</HI> who was at that Time President, did write to the Governor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> that he might make you Satisfaction for such of your Lands as his People had taken up; but did not receive one Word from him upon that Head. I will write to him again, and endeavour to procure you a satisfactory Answer. We do not doubt but he will do you Justice: But we exhort you to be careful not to exercise any Acts of Violence towards his People, as they likewise are our Brethren, and Subjects of the same Great King; and therefore Violence towards them must be productive of very evil Consequences.</P>
<P>I shall conclude what I have to say at this Time with Acknowledgments for your Present; which is very agreeable to us, from the Expressions of Regard used by you in presenting it: Gifts of this Nature receiving their
<PB N="15" REF="005216_0015_10171468DF426548"/>
Value from the Affection of the Giver, and not from the Quantity or Price of the Thing given.</P></Q>

<P>The Board taking into Consideration, whether it be proper or not at this Time to make a Present to the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Six Nations now in Town, in Return for their Present to this Government at Yesterday's Treaty:</P>
<P><HI>Resolved,</HI></P>
<P>That it is highly fit and proper that a Present be made to the said <HI>Indians</HI> at this Time.</P>
<P>And it is the Opinion of this Board, that the said Present should be of the Value of £. 500, or at least £. 300.</P>
<P>And it is recommended to Mr. <HI>Logan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Preston,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> to acquaint Mr. <HI>Kinsey,</HI> the Speaker of the Assembly, with the Opinion of this Board; and that they request him to confer with such other Member of Assembly as are in Town, and report their Sentiments thereupon.</P>
<P>The Board taking into Consideration the Threats express'd by the <HI>Indians,</HI> at the Treaty yesterday, against the Inhabitants of <HI>Maryland,</HI> settled on cer∣tain Lands on the West Side of <HI>Sasquahannah,</HI> which the <HI>Indians</HI> claim, and for which they require Satisfaction; and considering, that should those Threats, in any sort, be put in Execution, not only the Inhabitants of <HI>Mary∣land,</HI> but of this Government, and all His Majesty's Subjects on the Northern Continent of <HI>America,</HI> may thereby be involved in much Trouble: It is the Opinion of this Board, that the Governor write to the Governor of <HI>Maryland</HI> without Delay, to inform him of the <HI>Indians</HI> Complaints and Threats, and to request a satisfactory Answer; and that his Letter be sent by a special Messenger, at the Publick Expence.</P>

<P>The Governor informed the Board, that the <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs dining with him Yesterday, after Dinner delivered their Answer to two Affairs of Consequence;</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="005216_0016_1017146A6A04A720"/>
The first related to the violent Battery committed on <HI>William Webb,</HI> in the Forks of <HI>Delaware,</HI> whereby his Jaw-Bone was broke, and his Life greatly endangered, by an unknown <HI>Indian. Canassatego</HI> repeating the Message de∣livered to the <HI>Six Nations</HI> by <HI>Shickcalamy,</HI> in the Year 1740, with a String of Wampum, said in Answer: <Q>The <HI>Six Nations</HI> had made diligent Enquiry into the Affair, and had found out the <HI>Indian</HI> who had committed the Fact; he lived near <HI>Asopus,</HI> and had been examined and severely reprov'd: And they hoped, as <HI>William Webb</HI> was recovered, the Governor would not expect any further Punishment; and therefore they returned the String of Wampum received from their Brethren, by the Hand of <HI>Shickcalamy,</HI> in Token that they had fully comply'd with their Request.</Q></P>
<P>I thank'd them for their Care; but reminded them, that tho' the Man did not die, yet he lay a long Time in extreme Misery, and would never re∣cover the free Use of his Speech, and was rendered less able to get his Live∣lihood, and in such Cases the <HI>English</HI> Laws obliged the Assailant to make good all Damages, besides paying for the Pain endured. — But as the <HI>Indian</HI> was, in all Probability, poor and unable to make Satisfaction, I told them, that for their Sake I would forgive him; adding, had <HI>Webb</HI> died I make no Doubt but you would have put the <HI>Indian</HI> to Death, just as we did two of our People who had killed an <HI>Indian</HI>; we caused them to be hung on a Gal∣lows, in the Presence of many Hundreds of our People, to deter all others from doing the like. <HI>Canassatego</HI> made me this Reply: <Q>The <HI>Indians</HI> know no Punishment but Death; they have no such Thing as pecuniary Mulcts; if a Man be guilty of a Crime, he is either put to Death, or the Fault is overlook'd. We have often heard of your Hanging-up those two Persons; but as none of our <HI>Indians</HI> saw the Men die, many believe they were not hanged, but transported to some other Colony: And it would be satisfactory to the <HI>Indians,</HI> if, for the Future, some of them be sent for, to be Wit∣nesses of such Executions.</Q> I assured them, that whoever gave them that Information, abused them; for the Persons certainly suffered Death, and in the Presence of all the People.</P>
<P><HI>Canassatego</HI> then proceeded to give an Answer to what was said to them the 2d Instant relating to <HI>Le Tort</HI>'s Letter: <Q>That they had, in Council, consi∣dered in what Manner the Matter recommended to them ought to be con∣ducted; and they were of Opinion, that as the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> not the <HI>Twightwys</HI> (for they knew so much of it that the People were of the <HI>Twightwy</HI> Na∣tion in whose Bags the Scalps were found) had sent me a Present of Skins, I should, in return, send them a Blanket or a Kettle, and with it a very sharp Message, that tho' they had done well in sweeping the Road from Blood, yet that was but a small Part of their Duty; they ought not to have suffered the <HI>Twightwys,</HI> after their Lie and the Discovery of the Scalps, to have left them, 'til they had given a full and true Account how they came by them, whose Scalps they were, and in what Place, and for what Rea∣son the Men were kill'd; and when they had been fully satisfied of all these Particulars, then it was their Duty to have given Information to the Go∣vernment where the white People lived, that the Murderers might be complained against, and punished by the Nation they belong'd to: And as the <HI>Shawanese</HI> had omitted to perform the Part of Brethren, that I should reprove them for it, and charge them to make Amends for their Neglect, by using all possible Expedition to come at the Knowledge of these Things, and to aid their Brethren the white People in obtaining Justice.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005216_0017_1017146D61985F50"/>
The Minutes of the preceding Council being read, Mr. <HI>Logan,</HI> in Pursu∣ance of the Board's Direction of Yesterday, reported, on Behalf of himself and the other Gentlemen to whom it was recommended, that they had con∣fer'd with Mr. <HI>Kinsey,</HI> and requested him to consult the other Members of the Assembly concerning the making a Present to the <HI>Indians</HI>; and that Mr. <HI>Kinsey</HI> having collected the Sentiments of several Members of the Assembly in Town, whom he had confer'd with on that Subject, found them generally of Opinion, that a Present should at this Time be made; but that they had declined nominating any Sum: However, that Mr. <HI>Kinsey</HI> had given it as his own Opinion, that the Governor and Council might go as far as <HI>Three Hundred Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>And accordingly it is refer'd to Mr. <HI>Logan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Preston</HI> and Mr. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> to consider of and prepare a proper List of the Goods whereof the Present should be composed, to the Value of <HI>Three Hundred Pounds</HI> as aforesaid; ad∣vising with the Interpreter as to the Quantity and Quality.</P>

<P>The Governor spoke to the Chiefs of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>The last Time the Chiefs of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> were here, they were informed, that your Cousins, a Branch of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> gave this Province some Disturbance about the Lands the Proprietor purcha∣sed from them, and for which their Ancestors had received a valuable Consideration above <HI>Fifty-five</HI> Years ago, as appears by a Deed now lying on the Table.—Sometime after this, <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> delivered to your Bro∣ther <HI>Thomas Penn</HI> your Letter, wherein you request of him and <HI>James Logan</HI> that they would not buy Land, &amp;c.—This has been shewn to them and interpreted; notwithstanding which they have continued their former Disturbances, and have had the Insolence to write Letters to some of the Magistrates of this Government, wherein they have abused your good Brethren our worthy Proprietaries, and treated them with the utmost Rudeness and Ill-Manners. Being loth, from our Regard to you, to punish them as they deserve, I sent two Messengers to inform them that you were expected here, and should be acquainted with their Behaviour.—As you,
<PB N="18" REF="005216_0018_1017146F1F4DEE68"/>
on all Occasions, apply to us to remove all white People that are settled on Lands before they are purchased from you, and we do our our Endeavours to turn such People off; we now expect from you, that you will cause these <HI>Indians</HI> to remove from the Lands in the Forks of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and not give any further Disturbance to the Persons who are now in Possession.</P></Q>
<P><HI>To inforce This we lay down a String of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P>Then were read the several Conveyances, the Paragraph of the Lettes wrote by the Chiefs of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> relating to the <HI>Delawares</HI>; the Let∣ters of the <HI>Fork-Indians</HI> to the Governor and Mr. <HI>Langborne,</HI> and a Draught of the Land; and then delivered to <HI>Conrad Weiser,</HI> who was desired to in∣terpret them to the Chiefs when they should take this Affair into their Consideration.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 10. 1742.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclosed Extract of the Speech made by the Chiefs of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> before a very numerous Audience, in this Place, with my Answer to it, is of so great Importance to all his Majesty's Colonies in this Part of his Domin∣ions, and to your Government in particular, that I have imploy'd a special Messenger to deliver it you. I hope you will enable me to send them a satisfactory Answer. It would be impertinent in me to say more to one so well informed as you are of these Nations, and of their absolute Authority over all the <HI>Indians</HI> bordering upon us, or of the Advantages of maintaining a strict Friendship with them at all Times, but more especially at this critical Juncture.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Yours, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>An Account exhibited by <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> of his Expences upon the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, from <HI>February</HI> last to <HI>July</HI> 1. 1742, amounting to £. 36 18 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> was laid before the Board, and examined, and allow'd to be a just and very moderate Account.</P>

And the Board taking into Consideration the many signal Services per∣formed by the said <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> to this Government, his Diligence and Labour in the Service thereof, and his Skill in the <HI>Indian</HI> Languages and Methods of Business, are of Opinion that the said <HI>Conrad</HI> should be allowed, as a Reward from the Province at this Time, the Sum of <HI>Thirty Pounds,</HI> at least, besides Payment of his said Account.</P>

<P>The Governor spoke to the <HI>Indians</HI> as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>This Meeting will be short: It is in order to make you a Present from the Governor, the Council, the Assembly, and all our People. <HI>William Penn</HI> was known to you to be a good and faithful Friend to all the <HI>In∣dians:</HI> He made a League of Friendship with you, by which we became one People. This League has often since been renew'd by friendly Trea∣ties; and as you have declared that the Friendship shall always last on your Parts, so we would have you believe that it shall remain inviolable on ours while Sun and Moon endure.</P>
<P>I gave you some Expectation of a Present, and we have it now ready to deliver to you. This Present is made you by the Governor, Council, As∣sembly, and all our People, in Consideration of the great Miseries and Dis∣tresses which you our good Friends have lately suffered. This will be some Relief to you for the present, and it's to be hoped your own Industry will soon retrieve your Circumstances.</P>
<P>It has sometimes happened, and may happen again, that idle and untrue Stories are carried to you concerning us your Brethren; but our Desire is, and we expect it from you, that you will give no Credit to them; for we are, and always will be, your steady and sincere Friends.</P>
<P>It is a Custom when we renew our Treaties with our good Friends the <HI>Indians,</HI> to clear the Road and make our Fire burn bright: We have done so upon this Occasion; and, in Token of our Sincerity, we deliver you, as

<P><HI>CANASSATEGO</HI> said:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN the Governor and Council,</HI></P>
<P>The other Day you informed us of the Misbehaviour of our Cousins the <HI>Delawares,</HI> with respect to their continuing to claim, and refusing to remove from some Land on the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> notwithstanding their Ancestors had sold it by a Deed under their Hands and Seals to the Pro∣prietaries,
<PB N="21" REF="005216_0021_1017147AF1652828"/>
for a valuable Consideration, upwards of <HI>Fifty</HI> Years ago; and notwithstanding that they themselves had about <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Years ago, after a a long and full Examination, ratified that Deed of their Ancestors, and given a fresh one under their Hands and Seals; and then you requested us to remove them, inforcing your Request with a String of Wampum.—Af∣terwards you laid on the Table our own Letters by <HI>Conrad Weiser,</HI> some of our Cousins Letters, and the several Writings, to prove the Charge against our Cousins, with a Draught of the Land in Dispute.—We now tell you, we have perused all these several Papers: We see with our own Eyes, that they have been a very unruly People, and are altogether in the Wrong in their Dealings with you.—We have concluded to remove them, and oblige them to go over the River <HI>Delaware,</HI> and quit all Claim to any Lands on this Side for the Future, since they have received Pay for them, and it is gone thro' their Guts long ago.—To confirm to you that we will see your Request executed, we lay down this String of Wampum in return for yours.</P></Q>
<P>Then turning to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> holding a Belt of Wampum in his Hand, he spoke to them as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>COUSINS,</HI></P>
<P>Let this Belt of Wampum serve to chastise you. You ought to be taken by the Hair of the Head and shaked severely, till you recover your Senses and become sober. You don't know what Ground you stand on, nor what you are doing. Our Brother <HI>Onas</HI>'s Cause is very just and plain, and his Intentions to preserve Friendship. On the other Hand, Your Cause is bad; your Heart far from being upright; and you are maliciously bent to break the Chain of Friendship with our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> and his People. We have seen with our Eyes a Deed sign'd by nine of your Ancestors above <HI>Fifty</HI> Years ago for this very Land, and a Release sign'd, not many Years since, by some of yourselves and Chiefs now living, to the Number of fifteen or upwards.—But how came you to take upon you to sell Land at all: We conquered you; we made Women of you; you know you are Women, and can no more sell Land than Women; nor is it fit you should have the Power of selling Lands, since you would abuse it. This Land that you claim is gone through your Guts; you have been furnish'd with Cloaths, Meat and Drink, by the Goods paid you for it, and now you want it again, like Children as you are.—But what makes you sell Land in the Dark. Did you ever tell us that you had sold this Land. Did we ever receive any Part, even the Value of a Pipe-Shank, from you for it. You have told us a blind Story, that you sent a Messenger to us to inform us of the Sale, but he never came amongst us, nor we never heard any thing about it.—This is acting in the Dark, and very different from the Conduct our <HI>Six</HI> Nations observe in their Sales of Land; on such Oc∣casions they give publick Notice, and invite all the <HI>Indians</HI> of their united Nations, and give them all a Share of the Present they receive for their Lands.—This is the Behaviour of the wise united Nations.—But we find you are none of our Blood: You act a dishonest Part, not only in this but in other Matters: Your Ears are ever open to slanderous Reports about
<PB N="22" REF="005216_0022_1017147F5BEF8128"/>
our Brethren; you receive them with as much Greediness as lewd Women receive the Embraces of bad Men. And for all these Reasons we charge you to remove instantly; we don't give you the Liberty to think about it. You are Women. Take the Advice of a wife Man, and remove immedi∣ately. You may return to the other Side of <HI>Delaware</HI> where you came from: But we do not know whether, considering how you have demean'd yourselves, you will be permitted to live there; or whether you have not swallowed that Land down your Throats as well as the Land on this Side. We therefore assign you two Places to go, either to <HI>Wyomen or Shamokin.</HI> You may go to either of these Places, and then we shall have you more under our Eye, and shall see how you behave. Don't deliberate; but re∣move away, and take this Belt of Wampum.</P></Q>
<P>This being interpreted by <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> into <HI>English,</HI> and by <HI>Cornelius Spring</HI> into the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, <HI>Canassatego</HI> taking a String of Wampum, added further.</P>
<Q><P>After our just Reproof, and absolute Order to depart from the Land, you are now to take Notice of what we have further to say to you. This String of Wampum serves to forbid you, your Children and Grand-Chil∣dren, to the latest Posterity forever, medling in Land-Affairs; neither you nor any who shall descend from you, are ever hereafter to presume to sell any Land: For which P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rpose, you are to preserve this String, in Memory of what your Uncles have this Day given you in Charge.—We have some other Business to transact with our Brethren, and therefore depart the Council, and consider what has been said to you.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Canassatego</HI> then spoke to the Governor and Council:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>We called at our old Friend <HI>James Logan</HI>'s, in our Way to this City, and to our Grief we found him hid in the Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, and retired, thro' Infir∣mities, from Publick Business. We press'd him to leave his Retirement and prevailed with him to assist once more on our Account at your Councils. We hope, notwithstanding his Age, and the Effects of a Fit of Sickness, which we understand has hurt his Constitution, that he may yet continue a long Time to assist this Province with his Counsels. He is a wife Man, and a fast Friend to the <HI>Indians.</HI> And we desire, when his Soul goes to GOD, you may chuse in his Room just such another Person, of the same Prudence and Ability in Counselling, and of the same tender Disposition and Affection for the <HI>Indians.</HI> In Testimony of our Gratitude for all his Services, and because he was so good as to leave his Country-House, and follow us to Town, and be at the Trouble, in this his advanced Age, to attend the Council; we present him with this Bundle of Skins.</P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>It is always our Way, at the Conclusion of a Treaty, to desire you will use your Endeavours with the Traders, that they may sell their Goods cheaper
<PB N="23" REF="005216_0023_10171482ACC0B210"/>
and give us a better Price for our Deer-Skins. Whenever any particular Sort of <HI>Indian</HI> Goods is scarce, they constantly make us pay the dearer on that Account. We must now use the same Argument with them: Our Deer are killed in such Quantities, and our Hunting-Countries grown less every Day, by the Settlement of white People, that Game is now difficult to find, and we must go a great Way in Quest of it; they therefore ought to give us a better Price for our Skins; and we desire you would speak to them to do so. We have been stinted in the Article of Rum in Town. We desire you will open the Rum-Bottle, and give it to us in greater Abundance on the Road.</P></Q>
<P><HI>To inforce our Request, about the</HI> Indian <HI>Traders, we present you with this Bundle of Skins.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>When we first came to your Houses, we found them clean and in Order: But we have staid so long as to dirty them; which is to be imputed to our different Way of Living from the white People: And therefore, as we cannot but have been disagreeable to you on this Account, we present you with some Skins to make your Houses clean, and put them into the same Condition they were in when we came amongst you.</P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>The Business the <HI>Five</HI> Nations transact with you is of great Consequence, and requires a skilful and honest Person to go between us; one in whom both you and we can place a Confidence.—We esteem our present Inter∣preter to be such a Person, equally faithful in the Interpretation of what∣ever is said to him by either of us, equally allied to both; he is of our Nation, and a Member of our Council as well as of yours. When we adopted him, we divided him into Two equal Parts: One we kept for our selves, and one we left for you. He has had a great deal of Trouble with us, wore out his Shoes in our Messages, and dirty'd his Cloaths by being amongst us, so that he is become as nasty as an <HI>Indian.</HI></P>
<P>In Return for these Services, we recommend him to your Generosity; and on our own Behalf, we give him <HI>Five Skins</HI> to buy him Clothes and Shoes with.</P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P>We have still one more Favour to ask. Our Treaty, and all we have to say about Publick Business, is now over, and to morrow we design to leave you. We hope, as you have given us plenty of good Provision whilst in Town, that you will continue your Goodness so far as to supply us with a little more to serve us on the Road. And we likewise desire you will provide us with Waggons, to carry our Goods to the Place where they are to be conveyed by Water.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="24" REF="005216_0024_1017148434E7BB50"/>
To these several Points the Governor made the following Reply.</P>
<Q><P><HI>BRETHREN of the Six Nations,</HI></P>
<P>The Judgment you have just now pass'd on your Cousins the <HI>Dela∣wares,</HI> confirms the high Opinion we have ever entertained of the Justice of the <HI>Six Nations.</HI> This Part of your Character, for which you are deservedly famed, made us waive doing our selves Justice, in order to give you another Opportunity of convincing the World of your inviolable Attachment to your Engagements. These unhappy People might have always liv'd easy, having never receiv'd the least Injury from us; but we believe some of our own People were bad enough to impose on their Credulity, and engage them in these wrong Measures, which we with, for their Sakes, they had avoi∣ded.</P>
<P>We hoped, from what we have constantly given in Charge to the Indian Traders, that they would have administred no just Cause of Complaint: If they do you Wrong, it is against our Inclinations, and contrary to our express Directions. As you have exhibited no particular Charge against them, we shall use our best Endeavours to persuade them to give you as much for your Skins as they can possibly afford; and to take Care that their Goods which they give in Exchange for Skins, be of the best Sort. We will likewise or∣der you some Rum to serve you on your Journey home, since you desire it.</P>
<P>We wish there had been more Room and better Houses pro∣vided for your Entertainment; but not expecting so many of you, we did the best we could. 'Tis true there are a great many Hou∣ses in Town, but as they are the Property of other People, who have their own Families to take Care of, it is difficult to procure Lodgings for a large Number of People, especially if they come un∣expectedly.</P>
<P>We entertain the same Sentiments of the Abilities and Probity of the Interpreter as you have express'd. We were induc'd at first to make use of him in this important Trust, from his being known to be agreeable to you, and one who had lived amongst you for some Years, in good Credit and Esteem with all your Nations; and have ever found him equally faithful to both. We are pleas'd with the Notice you have taken of him, and think he richly deserves it at your Hands. We shall not be wanting to make him a suitable Gra∣tification, for the many good and faithful Services he hath done this Government.</P>
<P>We have already given Orders for Waggons to carry your Goods, and for a Supply of Provisions to serve you on the Road in your Return home, where we heartily wish you may arrive in good Health.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="25" REF="005216_0025_10171485C2D09C90"/>
After the Governor had concluded, Mr. <HI>Logan</HI> return'd an Answer to that Part of <HI>Canassateego</HI>'s Speech which related to him, and said, <Q>That not only upon the Account of his Lameness, of which the Indians themselves were Witnesses; but on Account of another Indisposition which about three Years since had laid him under an Incapacity of expressing himself with his former usual Freedom, he had been obliged to live retired in the Country. But that our first Proprietor, the Honourable <HI>William Penn,</HI> who had ever been a Father and true Friend to all the Indians, having above Forty Years since recommended them to his particular Care, he had always, from his own Inclination as well as from that strict Charge, en∣deavoured to convince all the Indians, that He was their true Friend; and was now well pleased, that after a Tract of so many Years, they were not insensible of it. He thanked them kindly for their Present, and heartily joined with them in their Desires, that this Government may always be furnished with Persons of equally good Inclinations, and not only with such, but also with better Abilities to serve them.</Q></P>
<P>And then <HI>Canassatego</HI> said, he had forgot to mention, that <HI>Shickcalamy</HI> and <HI>Caxbayn</HI> had been employ'd on several Messages to this Government, and desir'd they might be consider'd on that Account.</P>

<P>And the <HI>Indians</HI> having requested that they might have a small Quantity of Rum, to be added to their Provisions, to comfort them on the Road: The Board is of Opinion, that there be added to the said Estimate for Twenty Gallons of Rum for the aforesaid Use.

And that <HI>Five Pounds</HI> be given to <HI>Caxhayn</HI> on the Account of the Province, for his Services; and to <HI>Shickalamy</HI> the like Sum.</P>
