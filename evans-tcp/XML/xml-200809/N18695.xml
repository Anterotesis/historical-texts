</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was the unhappy case of Agrippa, that though <HI>almost,</HI> he was only <HI>almost, persuaded to be a Christian</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi. 28.</NOTE>; and I fear, it is now the case of many, and particularly of many <HI>young persons,</HI> who have enjoyed the advantages of a religious education. I believe it is difficult to find any amongst them, who have not been brought under some serious impressions betimes. With regard to the internal operations of the blessed Spirit, as well as external means, <HI>the morn∣ing of life</HI> is generally to them, in a peculiar sense, <HI>the day of their visitation</HI>; and they often seem to know it, and in some measure to improve it: but in too many instances we find their <HI>good∣ness as a morning cloud, and as the early dew, which soon passeth away</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Hos. vi. 4.</NOTE>. The blossoms open fair and beautiful, and give a very agreeable prospect of the plentiful fruits of holiness in life: but too often, when storms of temptation and corruption arise, the goodly appearance is laid in ruins; the blossoms do as it were fall to the ground, and leave the tree blasted and naked; or at best co∣vered only with leaves of an external profession,
<PB N="4" REF="024272_0003_0FC5F7EA63760890"/>
which, however green and flourishing they may for the present be, will not at last secure it from being <HI>cut down and cast into the burning.</HI> Though <HI>they</HI> for a while <HI>had escaped the pollutions of the world</HI> through lust, <HI>they are</HI> afterwards <HI>entangled</HI> and subdued; and the consequence is, they prove a scandal to religion, and a discouragement to others, till, in the end, they bring aggravated destruction on themselves; so that on the whole, as the <HI>apostle</HI> most justly observes, <HI>It had been better for them not to have known the way of righ∣teousness, than</HI> thus, <HI>after they have known it, to turn aside from the holy commandment</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. ii. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS may be in a great measure owing to the mutability of human nature in general, and particularly to the levity and inconstancy of youth, in conjunction with the force of those temptations of life, which continually surround and press upon them. Yet I apprehend this is not all, but that it is, in part, to be charged on something defective, even in their best days, on their resting in something short of real religion, and a true saving change. Solomon had seen reason to say, <HI>There is a way that seemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 12.</NOTE>: and I believe every considerate person will be ready to own, that in order to prevent so fatal a delusion, and all the train of mischiefs which may follow upon it, great care should be taken in stating this important question;
<Q>What is the true and solid <HI>basis,</HI> on which we may securely ground our eternal hopes?</Q>
It is a question of the highest importance, and the most univer∣sal concern, both to the <HI>aged</HI> and the <HI>young</HI>; so that I trust I need not offer any apology for
<PB N="5" REF="024272_0004_0FC5F7EE54E4F408"/>
complying with the request of a pious and ju∣dicious friend, who recommended this subject to our consideration, at this time, and on this occa∣sion.</P>
<P>IN prosecution of this design, I have made choice of these words of the <HI>apostle,</HI> which I have now been reading, and which may, without offer∣ing any violence to them, be very fairly and naturally accommodated to the present purpose.</P>
<P>IT is plain from many passages in this epistle, that the great apostle, who had planted the Chris∣tian church among the Galatians, had reason to fear, that many, who were by profession its mem∣bers, were not sufficiently established in their holy faith. It is probable; that he himself had an opportunity of making but a short stay amongst them; and, partly through their own negligence and prejudices, and partly through the artful attempts of false teachers, in the absence of St. Paul, they appear to have fallen into a set of no∣tions, and a conduct, which tended not only to impair the glory, but to subvert the very foun∣dation of the <HI>gospel,</HI> and with it the foundation of their own eternal hopes. Of this the apostle does, in a very awful manner, admonish them. He tells them, in the very beginning of his epis∣tle, that <HI>he marvelled, that they were so soon remov∣ed from him that called them</HI> (and from the prin∣ciples he had taught them) <HI>into another gospel</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 6.</NOTE>. And afterwards he useth these very free and em∣phatical words: <HI>O foolish Galatians, who hath be∣witched,</HI> or enchanted <HI>you, that you should not obey the truth? Are you so foolish? Having begun in the spirit</HI> (having professed to embrace the gospel, and shewn the appearances of some common zeal
<PB N="6" REF="024272_0005_0FC5F7EFA4D8EC20"/>
for it) can <HI>you now</HI> hope to be <HI>made perfect by the flesh,</HI> or by the ritual and carnal observances of the Mosaic institution? Is it thus that you disgrace all you have done, and all you have borne for Christ? <HI>Have you</HI> then <HI>suffered so many things in vain</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 1—4.</NOTE>? On the whole, he tells them, he was ready to apprehend, that all the agreeable hopes he had once entertained concerning them, would be buried in everlasting disappointment, and that it would appear, <HI>he had bestowed upon them labour in vain</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Chap. iv. 11.</NOTE>. Thus did he <HI>stand in doubt of them</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Chap. iv. 29.</NOTE>; and that doubt pierced his heart with the most tender concern, and brought upon him, as it were a second time, those pangs of soul which he had felt on their account, when he saw them in all the ignorance and wickedness of their Gentile state. He was hardly more solicitous then, that they might be <HI>turned from dumb idols to the living GOD,</HI> than he was now, that they might give convincing evidences that CHRIST was <HI>formed in them,</HI> i. e. that they had cordially received and digested the gospel, and that their hearts were <HI>delivered into the mould of it</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Rom vi. 17.</NOTE>: which it did not appear they were, while they were thus making void the grace of GOD, and the righteousness of faith, by adhering to the foolish and pernicious doctrine of the neces∣sity of seeking their <HI>justification,</HI> in part at least, by the observation of the Mosaic law.</P>
<P>THIS seems to be the most natural sense of the words of the text, where such a latitude of expression is used, as the apostle elsewhere seems to study, on purpose to render his writings uni∣versally edifying, and useful to <HI>them,</HI> whose par∣ticular
<PB N="7" REF="024272_0006_0FC5F7F6C44CF3C0"/>
circumstances in life are widely different from those of the persons to whom they were originally addressed.</P>
<P>AS to the introductory words, <HI>My little chil∣dren,</HI> we cannot imagine they refer to the <HI>age</HI> of those to whom the apostle wrote. The evident design of them is, to express that kind of parental tenderness which he entertained for them, like that which a mother hath for an infant with which she travails in birth. <HI>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, till Christ be formed in you.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be easy to multiply observations from the words. I might especially take occa∣sion to shew,—that it is possible, those that once seemed very hopeful, and still maintain an exter∣nal profession, may appear, after all, in such dan∣gerous circumstances, that judicious <HI>ministers,</HI> and other <HI>Christian friends,</HI> may be thrown into a great deal of perplexity and agony on their account;—and that the great thing necessary to establish their safety, and the comfort of those concerned for them, is, that the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ be formed in them.</HI></P>
<P>THAT I may more particularly illustrate and improve the text, and take in what is most im∣portant in these remarks, I will
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. CONSIDER several things, on which men are ready to build <HI>a false confidence,</HI> which will bring them into danger, and their ju∣dicious friends into perplexity upon their account.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. I WILL endeavour to shew you, what is the <HI>only solid foundation</HI> of their own hopes, and the joys of others with regard to them;
<PB N="8" REF="024272_0007_0FC5F7FD1901AC20"/>
which is here expressed by <HI>Christ formed in them.</HI> And then,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. I SHALL conclude with some more par∣ticular <HI>improvement,</HI> in proper inferences from the whole.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THESE are plainly matters of <HI>universal impor∣tance</HI>; but as I am now peculiarly addressing myself to <HI>young persons,</HI> I shall endeavour to fix on those thoughts, which may be most remark∣ably suitable to them: for I am much more con∣cerned that my discourse may be useful, than that it may be critically regular and exact. I hope there are many amongst you, who are experi∣mentally acquainted with the vitals of Christian∣ity, and have received from above an <HI>incorrup∣tible seed</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 23.</NOTE>. There are others, to whom I must say with the apostle to these Galatians, <HI>I stand in doubt of you</HI> <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 20.</NOTE>; and to such, I hope, I can apply myself in the language of the text, <HI>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, till Christ be formed in you.</HI> Pardon me, if in this instance <HI>I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy,</HI> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xi. 2.</NOTE>. I would endeavour, with the sincerest and tenderest affection, and with such freedom as the importance of the case requires, to guard you against those <HI>sandy foundations,</HI> which will bury you and your hopes deep in eternal ruins; and to direct you to <HI>the Rock of Ages,</HI> on which they who build shall <HI>never be ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>I THEREFORE intreat your serious attention, and would humbly ask, both for myself and you, the teachings of that blessed <HI>Spirit,</HI> whose pecu∣liar office it is, in the most efficacious manner, to shew us our danger and our remedy; to aid the labouring minds of <HI>ministers,</HI> and to cause
<PB N="9" REF="024272_0008_0FC5F801BB632FA0"/>
them to see with satisfaction <HI>the travail of their souls</HI> <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Isa. liii. 11.</NOTE> while he gives to their hearers a new birth, and immortal life, by <HI>forming Christ</HI> in them.</P>
<P N="1">I. I AM to caution you against several things, on which <HI>young persons</HI> are peculiarly prone to build <HI>a false</HI> and precarious <HI>confidence.</HI></P>
<P>AND here let me particularly intreat you, as you love your souls, and value your eternal hopes,—that you <HI>trust not</HI> to the privileges of your birth,—or the rectitude of your specula∣tions in matters of religion,—or the purity and frequency of your forms of worship,—or the warmth of your passions,—or the morality of your conduct: for none of these apart, nor even all of them united, can, according to the tenor of the gospel, be sufficient for your security and happiness.</P>
<P>1. TRUST not to the privileges of your <HI>birth</HI> and <HI>education,</HI> as the foundation of your eternal hopes.</P>
<P>YOU are, many of you, <HI>the seed</HI> of GOD's servants, perhaps for several succeeding genera∣tions. You may be ready to plead, that you were <HI>born in his house,</HI> that you were early devot∣ed to him in <HI>baptism,</HI> and have been <HI>brought up</HI> in the most regular and conscientious manner: you have been surrounded with holy instructions and correspondent examples from your infancy; and repeated fervent prayers, both in the family and in secret, have been sent up to heaven upon your account. These are indeed signal advan∣tages, and you may justly rejoice in them; for, in these respects, you are <HI>the children of the king∣dom:</HI> but <HI>rejoice with trembling</HI>; for our Lord
<PB N="10" REF="024272_0009_0FC5F80B66477BF8"/>
hath told us, that it is more than a possible case, <HI>that the children of the kingdom may be cast out,</HI> and have their portion <HI>in utter darkness</HI> <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Mat. viii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>. The peculiar regard shewn to <HI>the seed</HI> of Abraham, may perhaps be abused by some of you, as an encouragement to those presumptuous hopes. But remember, that Ishmael was the <HI>son</HI> of Abra∣ham, and Esau of Isaac; and yet neither the one, nor the other, <HI>inherited the blessing</HI> of his father. Remember that beautiful, but dreadful <HI>parable,</HI> which represents a wretched creature <HI>in hell,</HI> that could cry, <HI>Father</HI> Abraham, and yet in vain added, <HI>Have mercy upon me, and send me but a drop of water to cool my tongue</HI> <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi. 24.</NOTE>. Once more, remember those emphatical words of the Baptist, so expressly levelled against this arro∣gant presumption: <HI>Think not</HI> (says he) <HI>to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our fa∣ther; for I say unto you, that GOD is able, of these stones, to raise up children unto Abraham</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 9.</NOTE>: As if he should have said,
<Q>The promises made to those who are the <HI>children of</HI> Abraham, re∣spect not merely them who are lineally descend∣ed from him; but those who are the heirs of his piety and his faith; for if GOD were to turn these stones into men, and to form them by his grace to a holy character and temper, such, though descended from no human pa∣rents at all, would, in the sense of the promise, be <HI>children of</HI> Abraham.</Q>
And it were more reasonable to expect such a transmutation, than that GOD should acknowledge <HI>a generation of vipers</HI> as his people, because they were derived from <HI>holy ancestors.</HI> On the contrary, GOD directly assures us, that if <HI>the son</HI> of the most
<PB N="11" REF="024272_0010_0FC5F80CE3FB49D8"/>
<HI>religious father</HI> forsake the way of virtue and ho∣liness, and prove as <HI>the degenerate plant of a strange vine</HI> <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii. 21.</NOTE>, <HI>in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die</HI> <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xviii. 10—13, 24.</NOTE>. And <HI>surely</HI> herein <HI>the ways of the Lord are</HI> apparently <HI>equal</HI>; for it is most evident, that a long descent from GOD's people is a reproach and condemnation, rather than an honour, to those who abandon that good old way in which their ancestors have trod, and, as it were, cut off that intail of piety, which has been the care and the glory of preceding generations.</P>
<P>2. TRUST not to the <HI>regularity of your senti∣ments,</HI> in matters of religion, as the founda∣tion of your eternal hopes.</P>
<P>SO various are the workings of men's hearts, and the devices of Satan, that, if I mistake not, there are some that place their confidence in the <HI>strictness,</HI> and others in the <HI>latitude</HI> of their reli∣gious opinions; but the one, and the other, will appear <HI>equally vain,</HI> when considered in the view now before us.</P>
<P>SOME may possibly persuade themselves, that their condition is secure, because their <HI>sentiments</HI> are <HI>orthodox.</HI> They live perhaps in the midst of the unbelieving and profane, and see daily contempt and derision thrown upon the blessed gospel, or its most glorious peculiarities; but through the influence of a good education, or from some other principle, short of true piety, they may nevertheless not only <HI>hold fast the faith once deli∣vered to the saints,</HI> but even <HI>contend earnestly for it,</HI> <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Jude, <HI>ver.</HI> 3.</NOTE>: nay, they are, perhaps, learned in the con∣troversies of the time; and can indeed pronounce
<PB N="12" REF="024272_0011_0FC5F80EF982EA68"/>
concerning them in a very rational and accurate manner.</P>
<P>IF this, my friends, be the case with any of you, I congratulate you on the happiness of a well-informed judgment, but must caution you against mistaking it for a sanctified heart. <HI>The mystery of faith,</HI> as the apostle himself assures us, is <HI>to be held with a good conscience</HI> <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 19.</NOTE>: and in vain do you profess to retain the one, while you <HI>make shipwreck</HI> of the other. As precious a trea∣sure as the knowledge of the truth is, if we go no farther than mere speculation, it will be to you
<Q>but as a talent of gold to a man sinking in the sea, which only serves to plunge him so much the deeper in ruin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Bates' Works, <HI>page</HI> 938.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THERE are others who err in the contrary ex∣treme. <HI>Orthodox notions</HI> are <HI>their banter,</HI> rather than <HI>their confidence.</HI> They pride themselves in having broke the shackles in which others are confined, and in seeing through the mist in which multitudes have been perplexed. They are sen∣sible, that many things which divide the world are merely <HI>controversies about words</HI>; and are not much concerned about others in which there is a real difference, because they are well aware, that the <HI>fundamentals of religion</HI> lie in a very little room. They are confident of the innocency of error, and the safety of an <HI>honest mind</HI> under those mistakes which have been branded by the severest names. A wicked life is, in their es∣teem, the only dangerous heresy; and <HI>morality</HI> the only thing that is worth contending about. Charmed with their own wisdom and happiness in this freedom of thought, they look down with
<PB N="13" REF="024272_0012_0FC5F8149E7E03D8"/>
<HI>pity</HI> on persons under the influence of a contract∣ed education and narrow sentiments, and possi∣bly mingle their pity with a great deal of <HI>scorn,</HI> not to say <HI>indignation.</HI> But they are indeed themselves the objects of much juster pity, if, whilst they glory in their <HI>freedom,</HI> they are the <HI>servants of corruption</HI> <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. ii. 19.</NOTE>. It is certain, that the most generous speculations will no more save men of unregenerate hearts, and unholy lives, than the most rigid and severe set of notions. For <HI>notions</HI> and <HI>speculations</HI> are in their nature so far short of real goodness, that if there be no∣thing more than these, it matters but little what they are. Yet one cannot forbear observing a peculiar and most absurd inconsistency in the conduct of those, who think so highly of them∣selves, because they are possessed of this one spe∣culation, that <HI>speculation in general is a trifle, and morality is all</HI>; as if the whole of morality con∣sisted in bearing this testimony in its favour. I wish such a character were not almost as com∣mon, as it is for men to be bigots in defence of catholicism, and uncharitable in pleading the cause of charity. If this be the case with any of you, <HI>out of your own mouth must you be condemned,</HI> <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Luke xix. 22.</NOTE> and we may justly apply to you, in the midst of your self applauses, those awful words of our Lord; <HI>if ye were,</HI> in this respect, <HI>blind, ye would</HI> comparatively <HI>have no sin</HI>; whereas <HI>now you have no cloak,</HI> or excuse, <HI>for your sin</HI> <NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">John ix. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>3. TRUST not in the external <HI>forms of devo∣tion,</HI> as the foundation of your great hopes for eternity.</P>
<P>YOU are, it may be, joined to a society, which
<PB N="14" REF="024272_0013_0FC5F81E4E9788E0"/>
not only wears the <HI>christian name,</HI> but separates it∣self from many other professors, under the appre∣hension at least of a <HI>more pure</HI> and <HI>scriptural wor∣ship.</HI> You, perhaps, so much approve and es∣teem this worship, as to be diligent and constant in attending on the public exercises of it, not on∣ly in its stated returns, but on occasional oppor∣tunities. You fill your places here from time to time, not merely in obedience to the commands of your parents and Governors, but by your own voluntary choice. And, it may be, to these you add the forms of <HI>family devotion</HI> morning and evening, and, possibly, a few moments of daily retirement for reading and prayer. What can such religious persons have <HI>to fear?</HI> Nay, rather, my brethren, what can you have <HI>to hope,</HI> if, while you <HI>draw near to GOD with your mouths and your lips,</HI> you <HI>remove your hearts far from him</HI> <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxix. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>? If while you <HI>come before him, as his people come,</HI> and present yourselves in the posture of humble worshippers, <HI>your heart be going after your covetous∣ness</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 31.</NOTE>? <HI>GOD</HI> hath forever confounded such vain presumption, by declaring, that the <HI>prayer of the wicked is an abomination to him</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Prov. xv. 8.</NOTE>; and that <HI>his</HI> shall certainly be so, <HI>that turns away his ear from hearing the law</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxviii. 9.</NOTE> i. e. that refuses obe∣dience to it. The <HI>servant that knew his Lord's will, and did it not,</HI> became justly liable to <HI>be beaten with many stripes</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 47.</NOTE>; and it is not to be wondered, if, in this sense, <HI>judgment begin at the house of GOD</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 17.</NOTE>, and seize first on those who affront and profane his ordinances, by making them to supercede the very things which they were ori∣ginally appointed on purpose to promote.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="15" REF="024272_0014_0FC5F81FAD025E90"/>4. TRUST not to the <HI>warmth of your passions</HI> in matters of religion, as the foundation of your most important hopes.</P>
<P>SOME of you, to whom I now speak, have perhaps experienced very bitter <HI>agonies of con∣science.</HI> You have been rouzed from the sleep of carnal security, as by an <HI>earthquake,</HI> which has shook the very centre of your soul; the <HI>flames of hell</HI> have seemed, as it were, to flash in your faces; and all these mingled horrors have com∣pelled you to cry out,
<Q>woe is me, for I am un∣done! <HI>Oh</HI> what shall I do to be saved <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Isa. vi. 5. Acts xvi. 30.</NOTE>?</Q>
And yet, to allude to the story of Elijah, the <HI>Lord hath not been in the earthquake, or in the fire</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, xix. 11, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Consider to what purpose the enquiry af∣ter salvation hath been made, and with what resolution it hath been pursued; otherwise you may be fatally deceived. The murtherers of <HI>Stephen were cut to the heart</HI> by his preaching <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Acts vii. 54.</NOTE> and we are sure that, if the most deep and ter∣rifying convictions could have secured a man's salvation, the traitor Judas would have been safe, who undoubtedly felt the most violent convulsions of soul, before he proceeded to that dreadful extremity, which sealed him up under everlasting despair.</P>
<P>BUT you may have been impressed with the <HI>sweeter</HI> and the <HI>nobler passions</HI>; you have not on∣ly <HI>trembled</HI> at the thunder of the law, but <HI>rejoiced</HI> in the message of gospel grace: The news of a <HI>Redeemer</HI> has been <HI>welcome</HI> to your souls, and <HI>the feet of those</HI> messengers <HI>beautiful,</HI> that have come to <HI>publish peace</HI> in his name <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Isa. lii. 7.</NOTE>. You have, perhaps, been melted into tears of plea∣sure
<PB N="16" REF="024272_0015_0FC5F8211E354AA8"/>
and tenderness, when you have heard the representation of his dying love; and when the precious promises, established by it, have been unfolded, and the prospects of eternal glory displayed, your minds have been elevated and transported; so that you have hung, almost with a trembling eagerness, on the lips of the speaker.—I readily acknowledge, that such as <HI>these</HI> are frequently the workings of the blessed <HI>spirit</HI> of GOD, upon the souls of his chosen people; and when found in a due connection with the great effects they are designed to pro∣duce, are highly to be esteemed and rejoiced in. But remember, I entreat you, that every <HI>tear</HI> of tenderness, and every sally of <HI>joy,</HI> doth not arise from so divine a spring. You might <HI>weep</HI> at a mournful scene in a well wrought tragedy, as you have done at the story of a Redeemer's suf∣ferings; you might find yourselves <HI>transported</HI> with a fine poetical description of a <HI>Pagan elysium,</HI> or a <HI>Mahometan paradise,</HI> just as you have been with the views of a <HI>heavenly Canaan,</HI> which gos∣pel ordinances have presented. Mere <HI>self-love</HI> might be the foundation of such a <HI>joy</HI> in the tidings of pardon and happiness, without the least degree of renewing and sanctifying grace; as it probably was in those <HI>hearers,</HI> represented by the <HI>story ground,</HI> who <HI>immediately received the word with joy, but had no root, and so endured but for a while</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiii. 20, 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT, perhaps, you will say, you are confi∣dent it is not merely <HI>self-love</HI> in you, for you have often found your mind impressed with a <HI>grateful sense</HI> of the divine goodness; so that, when you own it before GOD in prayer, or
<PB N="17" REF="024272_0016_0FC5F8229FA1F238"/>
converse with his saints on the copious and de∣lightful subject, your souls flow forth <HI>in love</HI> to your great benefactor, and you look up to him in the most thankful acknowledgments of his favours.—If it be <HI>gratitude,</HI> that captivates the soul into a <HI>willing obedience,</HI> and engages you to yield yourselves as <HI>living sacrifices</HI> to GOD, then is <HI>Christ formed in your souls,</HI> and you are not the persons to whom I would give the alarm: on the contrary, I would rather confirm your hopes, and rejoice with you in them.—But if your <HI>gra∣titude</HI> does not rise to this; if it rest only in some <HI>tender emotion</HI> of mind, or some transient <HI>external expression</HI> of that emotion, I must faithfully tell you, that I fear it is only a nobler degree of that natural instinct, which causeth <HI>the ox to know his owner, and the ass his master's crib</HI> <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Isa. i. 3.</NOTE>. To find your spirit in this manner impressed, does indeed plainly prove that <HI>the day of your vi∣sitation</HI> is not entirely past; it proves you have not sinned yourselves into utter insensibility of soul; nay, it may possibly at length, through the communications of sanctifying grace, lead you on to real religion, and to eminent attainments in it: but at present it falls far short. I have often told you (and one can hardly repeat it too often, or insist too earnestly upon it) that there is a very wide difference between a <HI>good state,</HI> and a <HI>good frame</HI>; and that religion is not seated either in the understanding, or in the passions, but principally in the <HI>will</HI>; which, in this dis∣jointed state of human nature, is far from being always in a due harmony with either. So that, on the whole, those illuminations, or those af∣fections, on which you are apt to lay so great a
<PB N="18" REF="024272_0017_0FC5F8306DE08990"/>
stress, are, perhaps, at best, but the <HI>preparatory workings</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> upon your minds, which, if they are improved aright, may leave you more hard and more miserable than they found you.</P>
<P>5. TRUST not to the <HI>morality of your behaviour,</HI> as the foundation of your eternal hopes.</P>
<P>MORALITY is certainly a very excellent thing, and it were scandalous indeed for any professing <HI>Christian</HI> to pour contempt upon it. Wherever <HI>this</HI> is wanting, pretences to <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>Christian ex∣perience</HI> are not only vain, but insolent and detest∣able. <HI>He that committeth sin is of the devil</HI>; and only <HI>he that doth righteousness, is righteous</HI> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">1 John, iii. 7, 8.</NOTE>: nor hath <HI>the grace of GOD</HI> ever savingly <HI>ap∣peared</HI> to that man, through whatever uncommon scenes of thought he may have passed, who is not effectually <HI>taught</HI> by it <HI>to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly</HI> <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE>. But it will by no means follow from thence, that wherever there is a sober and virtu∣ous conduct such a soul <HI>is passed from death to life.</HI> If the whole of the gospel be wrapt up in the rules of morality, <HI>then is Christ dead in vain</HI>; or, at least, it is in vain that the notices of his death are published to us. Beware, I intreat you, of so pernicious an error. I think myself obliged more earnestly to caution you against it, because, while the devil is attempting, on the one hand, to engage some, under the specious pretences of an evangelical spirit, <HI>to turn the grace of GOD into wantonness</HI> <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Jude <HI>ver.</HI> 4.</NOTE>; he seems to be insnaring others, by extolling the <HI>virtue</HI> which he hates, in order to lead them into a <HI>neglect of Christ,</HI> and <HI>his righteousness,</HI> and all the peculiarities of the gos∣pel scheme of salvation; so that it is difficult on

the whole to say, which of these devices is most destructive to the souls of men.</P>
<P>FROM my heart I rejoice to think, there are so many amongst you, <HI>my young friends,</HI> whose cha∣racter in life is fair and unblemished. You <HI>es∣cape the</HI> grosser <HI>pollutions of the world</HI>; you abhor brutal <HI>intemperance</HI>; you scorn the mean artifices of <HI>deceit,</HI> and <HI>renounce the hidden things of disho∣nesty</HI> <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 2.</NOTE> you honour your <HI>parents</HI> and subordi∣nate governors; you treat the <HI>ministers of Christ</HI> with respect and esteem; you are affable and courteous in your behaviour to all: and on this account, we <HI>behold</HI> you <HI>and love</HI> you; we hope and conclude you are <HI>not far from the kingdom of hea∣ven</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Mark xi. 34.</NOTE>. But, alas! if things rest here, you will never enter into it. <HI>All these things</HI> had <HI>the young man</HI> in the gospel <HI>observed from his youth</HI> <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Mark x. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>; and many of you have seen, in a very large and beautiful representation, how <HI>lovely a youth</HI> was then <HI>perishing in sin</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Watts</HI>'s Serm. <HI>Vol.</HI> I. <HI>Ser.</HI> V.VI.</NOTE>.

<P>I KNOW, that <HI>they</HI> are especially in danger of being deceived here, who converse frequently with persons of an abandoned character; or who are themselves reformed from some gross irregula∣rities, to which they were once addicted. <HI>Com∣paring themselves</HI> with others, or <HI>with themselves</HI> in a more licentious and corrupt state, they pro∣nounce a favourable sentence, and conclude they are safe and happy: but let me intreat you, my friends, that you would rather compare your hearts and lives with that perfect law of GOD, which cannot be repealed; weigh yourselves in that balance, and see whether you are not <HI>found

You will soon acknowledge, on an impartial examination, that <HI>the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself upon, and the covering narrower than he can wrap himself in</HI> <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxviii. 20.</NOTE>; that neither you, nor <HI>any living,</HI> can <HI>be justified by the works of the law</HI> <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I WILL conclude this head with observing, that the instance of the blessed apostle St. Paul serves well to illustrate and confirm our discourse in each of the particulars I have now mentioned. Had the privileges of <HI>birth</HI> and <HI>education</HI> been a sufficient security, Paul had been secure before his conversion to <HI>Christianity</HI>; for he was <HI>circum∣cised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin</HI> (which had not, like the rest, revolt∣ed from the house of David) and by his mother's side, as well as his father's, <HI>a Hebrew of the He∣brews</HI> <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.—If the exactest regularity in <HI>religious notions,</HI> or the strictest formality in the <HI>externals of worship,</HI> could have secured a man, Paul had been secure; for he was, <HI>as touching the law, a Phari∣see</HI>; he lived according to the rigour of that sect, and, both with respect to doctrines and ce∣remonies, <HI>was exceedingly zealous of the traditions of the fathers</HI> <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 14.</NOTE>.—If a transport of <HI>passion</HI> in the cause of GOD could have secured a man, Paul had been secure; for, <HI>concerning zeal,</HI> or with regard to that, <HI>he persecuted the church, and wasted it beyond measure</HI> <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Ver. 13.</NOTE>.—And, lastly, if
<PB N="21" REF="024272_0020_0FC5F8355E2BF020"/>
<HI>morality</HI> of behaviour could have done it, Paul had been secure; for, <HI>touching the righteousness which is by the law,</HI> he was <HI>blameless</HI> <NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE>. In these things, he was once so weak and so wretch∣ed as to place a great deal of confidence; but when he was illuminated, and called by divine grace, he assures us, that <HI>what things were gain unto him</HI> before, <HI>those he counted loss for Christ,</HI> i. e. he most entirely renounced all dependence upon them: <HI>yea doubtless,</HI> says he, <HI>and I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Je∣sus my Lord:</HI> which naturally leads me to the second general, where</P>
<P N="2">II. I AM to consider, what will be a <HI>solid foundation</HI> for hope and joy, when all these pre∣carious dependences fail.</P>
<P>THIS is, with the utmost propriety, expressed in the text by <HI>Christ formed in the soul,</HI> which is exactly parallel to that phrase in Colossians, <HI>Christ in you, the hope of glory</HI> <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Col. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> which is there men∣tioned as an epitome of the gospel, the <HI>riches of the glory of the mystery</HI> preached <HI>among the Gentiles.</HI>— When Paul could see that the Galatians were brought to this, the pangs of his labouring mind would be ended, and joy and confidence would succeed; which is plainly intimated in the words of the text: and when you, my dear charge, are brought to it, <HI>parents</HI> and <HI>ministers</HI> may rejoice over you, and <HI>you</HI> will have an ever∣lasting spring of hope and joy, <HI>a solid foundation,</HI> on which to build for eternity.</P>
<P>PERMIT me, therefore, a little more particu∣larly to explain it to you; and let me intreat you to turn your thoughts inward, that you may judge, whether you have been experiment∣ally
<PB N="22" REF="024272_0021_0FC5F841C14159A0"/>
acquainted with the temper and change which I shall now describe, as signified by this remarkable expression in the text, <HI>Christ formed in you.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, I think, it implies these three things:— that some <HI>apprehensions of Christ</HI> have taken hold of the heart;—that the man is brought to <HI>an ex∣plicit choice of him,</HI> and deliberately enters into covenant with him;—and that in consequence of both these, something of <HI>the temper and spirit of Christ</HI> is by divine grace wrought in his soul. I will touch on each of these, but my time will not allow me to manage them in so copious and particular a manner as they well deserve.</P>
<P>1. TO have <HI>Christ formed in the soul</HI> supposes, that some <HI>serious apprehensions of Christ</HI> have taken hold of the heart.</P>
<P>IT evidently implies, that the external revela∣tion of him hath not only been admitted as a spe∣culative truth, but attended to as a matter of the highest concern. Previous to the <HI>forming of Christ</HI> in the soul, there must be a <HI>conviction,</HI> that we are naturally <HI>without Christ,</HI> and that, in con∣sequence of this, we are in a most unhappy condition. And <HI>this conviction</HI> must strike deep upon the heart; for till the evil of sin be felt, what can make the <HI>news of a Saviour</HI> welcome? Since, as he himself has declared, <HI>the whole need not a physician, but they that are sick</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Matt. ix. 12.</NOTE>. The man in whose heart <HI>Christ is formed,</HI> has seen himself <HI>condemned</HI> by GOD's righteous law; has seen himself equally <HI>unable</HI> to answer its de∣mands, or to bear up under the execution of its penalties. And feeling this to be <HI>no light matter,</HI> but the very <HI>life of his soul,</HI> he has then been en∣gaged,
<PB N="23" REF="024272_0022_0FC5F8462B8EC1C0"/>
with the greatest seriousness and earnest∣ness, to cry out, <HI>Woe is me, for I am undone</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Isa. vi. 5.</NOTE>! Oh, <HI>what shall I do to be saved</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 30.</NOTE>? I before told you, there may be these <HI>convictions</HI> and awaken∣ings, where <HI>Christ</HI> is never <HI>formed in the soul</HI>; and I now add, that the degree of them may be vari∣ous, according to the various tempers and circum∣stances of different persons: but it is most evident that something of this kind must make way for the Redeemer's entrance, who <HI>comes to seek and to save that which was lost</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Luke xix. 10.</NOTE>; <HI>to bind up the broken-hearted</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxi. 1.</NOTE>; and to <HI>give rest to the weary and heavy-laden</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Mat. xi. 28, 29.</NOTE>. And I the rather insist on this, because I am fully persuaded, that slight thoughts of sin, and of the misery of our natural estate by it, have been the principal cause of all the infidelity of the present age, and are daily ruining a multitude of souls.</P>
<P>2. THE formation of <HI>Christ</HI> in the soul doth farther imply <HI>an explicit choice of him,</HI> and a deliberate <HI>entering into covenant with him.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN such a soul hears of a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and of the <HI>way of salvation</HI> by him, exhibited in scripture, it cordially <HI>approves</HI> the scheme, as entirely wor∣thy of its divine author; and though corrupt na∣ture raises up a thousand <HI>proud thoughts,</HI> in a vain and ungrateful rebellion against it, yet they are, by almighty grace, subdued and <HI>brought into cap∣tivity</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. The man really sees such a suitable∣ness, and such an amiableness, in the blessed Jesus, under the character in which the gospel reveals him, that he judges him to be <HI>the pearl of great price</HI>; and as GOD has laid him as <HI>the foundation-stone,</HI> he is, in that view, inconceivably <HI>precious to him</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 6.</NOTE>.
<PB N="24" REF="024272_0023_0FC5F8479BF82FD0"/>
Far from contenting himself with applauding this plan, as regular, beautiful, and magnificent in ge∣neral, the true believer is solicitous, that he may have his own share in this edifice of mercy; and that <HI>coming to Christ as a living stone,</HI> he may himself be one of those, who shall <HI>on him be built up for an habitation of GOD through the Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 22.</NOTE>. When he considers the Lord Jesus represented as <HI>standing at the door and knocking</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 20.</NOTE> it is with pleasure that he <HI>hears his voice, and opens to him,</HI> and, as Zac∣cheus did, <HI>receives him joyfully</HI> <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Luke xix. 6.</NOTE>. He regards him <HI>as a nail fastened in a sure place</HI> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxii. 23.</NOTE>; on which he can joyfully fix all his eternal hopes, infinitely important as he sees them to be. And while he thus <HI>anchors his soul</HI> on the <HI>righteousness,</HI> the <HI>atone∣ment,</HI> and the <HI>intercession</HI> of a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> he humbly bows to his <HI>authority,</HI> as <HI>his Lord and his GOD</HI> <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">John xx. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. It is his desire to seat him on the throne in his heart, and, as it were, to put into his hand the <HI>sceptre</HI> and the <HI>sword,</HI> that all the powers of nature may be governed, and all the corruptions of it de∣stroyed by him. In a word, as he knows that Christ was <HI>given for a covenant to the people</HI> <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Isa. xlix. 8.</NOTE> he deliberately <HI>sets his seal</HI> to that <HI>covenant,</HI> thereby devoting himself to <HI>Christ,</HI> and, through him, to the <HI>Father.</HI> Such are his views, his purposes, and his engagements; and by divine grace he is ena∣bled to be faithful to them. Which leads me to add,</P>
<P>3. WHEN <HI>Christ</HI> is formed in any soul, some∣thing of the <HI>temper and character of the blessed Jesus</HI> is by divine grace <HI>wrought there.</HI></P>
<P>I MIGHT with ease multiply <HI>scriptures</HI> in proof of the absolute necessity of this; but it is so obvi∣ous,
<PB N="25" REF="024272_0024_0FC5F84918FB10B8"/>
that you must yourselves know how ex∣pressly it is required. You know how plainly St. Paul has told us, that <HI>if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his</HI> <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 9.</NOTE>: and where this <HI>spirit</HI> resides, <HI>Christ dwells in the heart</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Eph. iii. 17.</NOTE>.

On which account the true <HI>Christian</HI> is said <HI>to have put on Christ</HI> <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 27.</NOTE> in allusion to the Hebrew phrase, of <HI>being cloathed with</HI> any temper or affection, that greatly prevails, or go∣verns in the soul <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus we read of being <HI>cloathed with righteousness,</HI> Job xxix. 14, Psal. cxxxii. 9; <HI>with humility,</HI> 1 Pet. v. 5; <HI>with zeal,</HI> Isa. lix. 17; <HI>with cursing,</HI> Psal. cix. 18; <HI>with shame,</HI> Psal. cxxxii. 18. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is a very pleasing as well as useful em∣ployment, to trace the lineaments of the <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>conduct of Christ</HI> in his people. Our Lord is in a peculiar sense <HI>the Son of GOD</HI>; but his peo∣ple are, through him, taken into the same rela∣tion: for they <HI>have not received the spirit of bondage again unto fear,</HI> though perhaps they were once subjected to it, <HI>but</HI> they <HI>have received the spirit of adoption</HI> <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 15.</NOTE>; and <HI>because</HI> they <HI>are sons, GOD hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into</HI> their <HI>hearts, crying Abba, Father</HI> <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 6.</NOTE>. By this <HI>spirit</HI> a <HI>filial temper</HI> is wrought in their souls, by which their obedience to their heavenly Father is so animat∣ed, as to be most honourable and grateful to him, as well as most easy and delightful to themselves.

<P>THE language of the text, which speaks of <HI>Christ formed in us,</HI> naturally leads our thoughts to some <HI>agent,</HI> by whom the work is done; and when you consider what kind of a work it is, I appeal to your own consciences, whether it is to be thought merely a <HI>human production.</HI> Were it only a name, a ceremony, a speculation, or a passion, it would not be worth a moment's dis∣pute, whether <HI>you</HI> or <HI>we</HI> should have the glory of it. But as it is nothing less than the a <HI>transformation</HI> of a corrupt and degenerate creature, into the holy image of the Son of GOD, it were impiety for <HI>either</HI> to arrogate it to <HI>ourselves.</HI></P>
<P>LET us therefore, on the whole, learn our duty and our wisdom. Let the matter be brought to a serious and immediate review, and let us <HI>judge ourselves</HI> by the character described, as those that

expect very shortly to be <HI>judged of the Lord.</HI>—If, on the examination, any of you have reason to conclude that you are <HI>strangers to it,</HI> remember that the invincible battery of the word of GOD demolishes all the towering hopes you may have raised on any <HI>other foundation.</HI> Let conscience then say, whether any amusement, or any business in life, be so <HI>important,</HI> as to be attended to, even for one single day, in neglect of this <HI>great concern,</HI> on which all the happiness of an immortal soul is suspended. If nothing be indeed found of great∣er moment, apply yourselves seriously to this, and omit no proper and rational methods of se∣curing it. Consider the ways by which <HI>Christ</HI> uses to enter into a soul, and wait upon him in those ways. Reflect seriously on your present condition; constantly attend the instructions of his word, and the other solemnities of his worship; and chuse to converse intimately with those, in whom you have reason to think <HI>he is already formed.</HI> But in all remember, that the success depends upon a <HI>divine co-operation,</HI> and therefore go frequently into the presence of GOD by <HI>prayer</HI>; go into it this day, or if possible this hour, and importunately intreat the regene∣rating and sanctifying influences of his <HI>Spirit,</HI> which, when you earnestly desire them, the <HI>gospel</HI> gives you such ample encouragement to expect. —But if you have reason to hope that you have <HI>already received them,</HI> learn to what the <HI>praise</HI> should be ascribed; and let it animate you to <HI>pray,</HI> that, through farther communications from the throne of grace, you may be made continual∣ly more and more <HI>like</HI> to your <HI>Redeemer,</HI> till you are prepared for that world, where you shall <HI>shine forth</HI> in his complete resemblance, and shall find it your complete and eternal felicity. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>The DIGNITY of the SOUL, arising from its IMMORTALITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE eternal Salvation of one Soul is of greater Importance, and big with greater Events, than the temporal Salvation of an whole Kingdom, though it were for the Space of Ten Thousand Ages; be∣cause there will come up a Point, an Instant in Eternity, when that one Soul shall have existed as many Ages, as all the Individuals of an whole Kingdom, ranged in close Succession, will in the whole have existed in the Space of Ten Thou∣sand Ages: Therefore one Soul is capable of a larger Share of Hap∣piness or Misery, throughout an endless Eternity, for that will still be before it, more than an whole Kingdom is capable of in Ten Thousand Ages.</P>
