<HEAD>ARTICLE II.</HEAD>
<P>To prevent all disputes on the subject of the boundaries which separate the territories of the two high contracting parties, it is hereby declar∣ed and agreed as follows, to wit. The southern boundary of the United States which divides their territory from the Spanish colonies of East and West Florida, shall be designated by a line beginning on the river Missisipi at the northern∣most part of the thirty first degree of latitude north of the equator which from thence shall be drawn due east to the middle of the river Apala∣chicola or Catahsuche thence along the middle thereof to its junction with the Flint: thence straight to the head of St. Marys river, and thence down the middle thereof to the Atlantic ocean. And it is agreed that if there should be any troops garrisons or settlements of either party in the territory of the other according to the
<PB N="5" REF="031419_0004_0FEC5340415E1518"/>
abovementioned boundaries, they shall be with∣drawn from the said territory within the term of six months after the ratification of this treaty, or sooner if it be possible; and that they shall be permitted to take with them all the goods and effects which they possess.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE III.</HEAD>
<P>In order to carry the preceeding article into effect, one commissioner and one surveyor shall be appointed by each of the contracting parties, who shall meet at the Natchez on the left side of the river Missisipi before the expiration of six months from the ratification of this convention, and they shall proceed to run and mark this boundary according to the stipulations of the said article. They shall make plats and keep journals of their proceedings, which shall be considered as part of this convention, and shall have the same force as if they were inserted therein. And if on any account it should be found necessary that the said commissioners and surveyors should be accompanied by guards, they shall be furnished in equal proportions by the commanding officer of his majesty's troops in the two Floridas, and the commanding officer of the troops of the United States in their south western territory, who shall act by common consent and amicably as well with respect to this point, as to the furnishing of provisions and in∣struments, and making every other arrangement which may be necessary or useful for the exe∣cution of this article.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<P>It is likewise agreed that the western boundary of the United States which separate them from the Spanish colony of Louissiana, is in the middle of the channel or bed of the river Missisipi from the northern boundary of the said States to the completion of the thirty first degree of latitude north of the equator. And his Catholic Ma∣jesty has likewise agreed that the navigation of the said river in its whole breadth from its source to the ocean shall be free only to his subjects and the Citizens of the United States, unless he should extend this privilege to the subjects of other powers by special convention.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE V.</HEAD>
<P>The two high contracting parties shall by all the means in their power maintain peace and harmony among the several Indian nations who inhabit the country adjacent to the lines and ri∣vers which by the preceding articles form the boundaries of the two Floridas. And the better to attain this effect, both parties oblige themselves expressly to restrain by force all hostilities on the part of the Indian nations living within their boundary: so that Spain will not suffer her Indians to attack the citizens of the United States nor the Indians inhabiting their territory; nor will the United States permit their last mentioned Indians to commence hostilities against the sub∣jects of his Catholic majesty or his Indians in any manner whatever.</P>
<P>And whereas several treaties of friendship ex∣ist between the two contracting parties and the
<PB N="7" REF="031419_0006_0FEC534944C8F5D8"/>
said nations of Indians, it is hereby agreed that in future no treaty of alliance or other whatev∣er (except treaties of peace) shall be made by ei∣ther party with the Indians living within the boundary of the other, but both parties will en∣deavour to make the advantages of the Indian trade common and mutually beneficial to their re∣spective subjects and citizens, observing in all things the most complete reciprocity, so that both parties may obtain the advantages arising from a good understanding with the said nations without being subject to the expense which they have hi∣therto occasioned.</P>
