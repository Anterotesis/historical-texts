<Q><BIBL>1 SAMUEL, ix. 6.</BIBL> AN HONOURABLE MAN.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are chosen in honour of General FISKE, whose elogium I am this day to pronounce. The Scriptures every where pay a tribute to character, in order to pay a just tribute to truth. His∣tory lives in great men, as well as in great events, and it cannot do justice to the one, without the other. The most simple chro∣nology is that of lives; and laws take not plainer dates from the reign of princes, than great actions do from the times of great men. Surely then the silence will not be required of religion, which truth
<PB N="6" REF="031800_0005_0FEE72E08CC91DF8"/>has denied to history. We may pay the debt of friendship, and form the love of vir∣tue, in the memory of the dead. The good man will ask no apology, and no other man can deserve one. It is the privilege of virtue to be dear in the recollection, and to have glory from past actions.</P>
<P>A peculiar obligation arises on the pre∣sent occasion, from the distinguished ser∣vices which our departed friend perfor∣med for this religious society. The spirit of our times had required a change from a parish, to that of an incorporation of the proprietors in this house of worship. Other parts of the town enjoyed such pri∣vileges, and many inhabitants were bound by local residence to support a minister in the parish, who had other engagements. To obtain a law to dissolve the parish was easy, but to change the proprietors of the house so as to provide such as were com∣petent to the settlement and support of a
<PB N="7" REF="031800_0006_0FEF2819D9EB77B0"/>minister, was difficult. The work must be accomplished by slow degrees, and in this time, the support of a minister must be very precarious. It must depend upon generous exertion, and require some ac∣tive friend to persevere in firm, but mild measures, till the end was attained. Such was our deceased friend, and his liberality on the occasion was unbounded. He was constant, consistent, and competent in such services, and attained his wishes without division, or contention. His en∣deavours to establish, what he had so lau∣dably assisted to create, were uniform, till an apoplectic shock disenabled him from any important services in our interest. We may then, with the greatest justice, unite with his fellow citizens in comme∣morating the event of the past week, in the death of an HONOURABLE MAN.</P>
<P>Major General JOHN FISKE was born in this town, on the 10th day of April,
<PB N="8" REF="031800_0007_0FEE72E359A70FF8"/>1744. His father was minister of the first church, which was, at his ordination, the only church within the limits of the town. He was a man of eminent talents in the pulpit, of a firm and persevering mind, and of great ambition. He mar∣ried into one of the most flourishing fa∣milies of the town, and was in very high esteem, till dissensions in the society, from the ill defined discipline of our churches, interrupted the harmony, and prevented his usefulness. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Samuel Fiske, ordained October 8, 1718, died in Salem, April 7, 1770, Aet. 81.</NOTE> Among his children, was the gentleman we lament. John was baptized on the 6th of May, by his uncle Nathan Bucknam, of Medway, in the first church in Salem. This venerable man, lately deceased, nearly finished a century of years. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He died, in his charge at Medway, in February, 1795. Aet. 92.</NOTE> Debarred from the hopes of living in the ministry, the Father was obliged to provide for his children in the usual business of life, and his son, with a
<PB N="9" REF="031800_0008_0FEE72E62746D710"/>common education, early engaged in the business of the sea, and having great suc∣cess and happy talents for this employ∣ment, he soon became able to obtain pro∣motion. He married for the first time in June 1766 to a daughter of a Deacon in this church, in whom he found a worthy wife, and the mother of his children. She deceased in 1782, and he afterwards mar∣ried a daughter of Col. Lee of Manches∣ter, with whom he lived only two years. He then married his present wife, with whom he lived happily, and from whom he experienced all the kind offices which were so necessary in the last years of his life. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He married Lydia Phippen, June 12, 1766, who died October 13, 1782. He married the widow Martha Hibbert, daughter of Col. John Lee, of Manchester, February 11, 1783, who died No∣vember 30, 1785. He then married the widow Sarah Oerry, of Marblehead, daughter of Major John Wendell, of Boston, June 18, 1786. His surviving children are Anna, Elizabeth, and John, Elizabeth married Ebenezer Putnam, M. A. son of Ebenezer Put∣nam, physician, of Salem, lately deceased. They have one child.</NOTE></P>
<P>Soon after he became easy in his cir∣cumstances,
<PB N="10" REF="031800_0009_0FEE72E8EC3692B0"/>the American Civil War com∣menced. His intrepidity and ambition soon marked him out, as capable of useful services to his country, and he was ap∣pointed a commander in the service of the State, in one of the vessels then fitted for sea, and held the first commission. The natural warmth of his temper could never controul the generous sentiments of his heart. Even in times of war, he felt the great difference between the liberty of the law, which public exigencies might give to private vessels on the high seas, and the authority it could have in the name of the State to capture vessels of the enemy. Of a commission he thought most highly, and the most generous conduct resulted from the pride, which this opinion inspired. Our feeble marine force could atchieve nothing greater than to interrupt the trade of the enemy, and this might be done without insult, and inhumanity. At the close of the war, he established himself as
<PB N="11" REF="031800_0010_0FEE72EBAE8A7978"/>a merchant. As he rose in life, from the employments of navigation, he connected his character as a merchant, immediately with ships in commerce, and extended his voyages, as the enterprising spirit of the times, and his own ambition led him, and had he not possessed from early life an un∣common generosity, he must have risen to as splendid wealth, as has ever been en∣joyed in our country. In his business, he soon became distinguished by his generous encouragement to all whom he employed. He never appeared more sincerely happy, than when the masters of his vessels grew rich, and never discovered more earnest de∣sires, than to promote such as had been faithful in his employment. Punctuality with the tradesmen, he most highly valued, and his contracts were generous, never op∣pressive, and seldom of less than equal ad∣vantage, to all who formed them. He carefully observed an annual settlement and arrangement of all his affairs, and no
<PB N="12" REF="031800_0011_0FEE72EE703C34A0"/>merchant could provide more amply for the accuracy of his papers, or the order and just series of his books of account. And he suffered no persons to be engaged in this service, who had not adequate hopes of advantage from their fidelity. No man therefore could be more loved by his clerks and masters. All are ready to attest the warmth of affection, which they have dis∣covered.</P>
<P>His business kept him from any thoughts of civil offices in the state, but no man ever paid greater veneration to the servants of the people. He always spake of places of trust, as offices of the highest honour, and he religiously guarded against the li∣berty to extend the censure of a bad man, to any office he might hold in the state. Our chief magistrates, our judges, and men of every office found him respectful to all the honours, which the state could confer, and discovered that such honours
<PB N="13" REF="031800_0012_0FEE72F2750F9288"/>were sure claims of the highest attention from his enlightened patriotism.</P>
<P>But though confined by his attention to business, in his wishes of civil promotion, no man was more attentive to the police, and the prosperity of the town, in which he lived. As an officer of the town he was always useful; always ready; and always employed. In the administration of the public charities, no man contributed more to the most happy arrangements, to the kindest attentions, and to the general satis∣faction of the poor. No part of the eco∣nomy was forgotten by him. Every thing passed before his own eyes. He entered into the condition and claims of the lowest, and was as punctual and faithful, as in his own highest concerns. Upon the occa∣sional contributions in the Congregation, he has been known to assist liberally in the collection; to have added repeatedly in the arrangements; and then again in the
<PB N="14" REF="031800_0013_0FEE72F4038C9990"/>distribution, and has then said, "It is in∣deed more than usual, but while one want is unsupplied, it is not enough."</P>
<P>For the Schools he always expressed the most sacred regard, and he was very active in obtaining that late establishment, from which the town derives so much honour, and so general satisfaction. He inspected the building of the new Schools, and encouraged with great zeal the public Schools for the instruction of Females. He always had an high opinion of the im∣portant trust of a Schoolmaster, and there∣fore always was zealous for the most am∣ple compensation of their labours. The Schoolmasters have lost a distinguished be∣nefactor. The exemplary industry, and just economy of this town, had subjected it to false charges respecting its hospitality. The silent and reserved manners so natural to its employments, and to a town, which has so very little inland trade, had given
<PB N="15" REF="031800_0014_0FEE72F6BB7730B8"/>occasion to such reports. It was the duty of men, who could unite with application to business, happy opportunities for leisure, to remove ungenerous prejudices. For this duty, our friend was eminently quali∣fied. The habits of business were easy to him, and his affairs were well arranged, while his love of society had never been impaired by his great industry and activity. He therefore opened his house to the wor∣thy of all nations. He received visits freely from all strangers, recommended to him, and searched out the wants of all, who entered the town. In his extensive ser∣vices to men of every rank and description, he remains unequalled.</P>
<P>He had been always taught to associate the influence of good morals with religious institutions of public instruction, and therefore at public worship he was con∣stant. No excuses sufficed for him. But with religious opinions he had formed no
<PB N="16" REF="031800_0015_0FEE72F976B109A0"/>enmities. He never thought men, who differed from him, were fools or knaves. He had a persuasion that religious opinions depend not on names, but upon sincere inquiry, for their best influence, and that an honest mind might be so circumstanced, as to admit the most absurd doctrines, and be uncharitable in the defence of them, while there might be great benevolence in the native purposes of the heart. He therefore loved all men, who acted in sin∣cerity, and never found his own heart less sensible, nor his hand less ready, from the opinions, condition, or prejudices of any men. Few men can preserve this genero∣sity of mind, with greater freedom from caprice. No hasty expression was hard to recall, and no fudden purpose was suffi∣cient to check his bounty; and when he acted, he was sure to do what was honour∣able. He felt the claims of humanity ris∣ing above all the distinctions of civil life, and he had one law for all mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="031800_0016_0FEE72FC414F8A70"/>
The kind opinion of his fellow citizens marked him out for all the honours they could confer. His promotion was una∣voidable. They knew his ambition to give the highest success to all his under∣takings, and could not refuse to urge him to many important services. The state of the militia, the boast, as it ought to be the defence of Republics, then under many discouragements, required a man of perse∣verance, and bold exertion. The laws of the militia were examined with great pre∣judices, and the contrary opinions all tended to insubordination. A man of a disinterested spirit was necessary to quiet the public mind, and to overrule prejudices in regard to a subject upon which the pub∣lic sense is not yet determined. After his public appearance he soon rose to the highest preserment. He became Colonel of the Regiment in 1788. In July 1789 he was elected, and commissioned Briga∣dier General, and in 1792 became Major
<PB N="18" REF="031800_0017_0FEE72FEF9957C50"/>General. Under his patronage began an association of the Military Officers, which has been very favourable to private friend∣ship, as well as conducive to the ambition of a military command, while it much increased the disposition for the necessary subordination.</P>
<P>While employed in organising and en∣couraging the militia, he was not forgot∣ten by the merchants, and the members of the Marine Society. This institution, de∣signed for the charitable assistance of dis∣tressed mariners and their families, embra∣ced also the liberal design of promoting every thing useful to navigation, and of preserving and communicating all disco∣veries and occurrences on the voyages of the members, as well as of receiving all plans to facilitate the navigation of this port. The Marine Society was formed in 1766, revised its laws in 1784, and again corrected them in 1790. After the death
<PB N="19" REF="031800_0018_0FEE7301C0779548"/>of that worthy man, Captain Jonathan Gardner, in 1791, our friend was appoint∣ed his successour, as President, or Master of the Society. Under so active an officer, its spirit revived. It was not long after the appointment, convenient piers were raised to guard against the dangers and the delays of a narrow and shallow channel to our wharves, and the stately beacon soon appeared at the entrance of the harbour, which promoted from its known utility, the petition for the new light house al∣ready erected. The funds have increased, and this Society is now one of the most flourishing and reputable in the State.</P>
<P>But to teach us the uncertain prospects of life, while he was projecting the boldest designs for the prosperity of Salem, he had a stroke of apoplexy, which put an end to his usefulness. The evil had so affected the brain in June 1795, that the hopes of recovery were lost. It was attended with
<PB N="20" REF="031800_0019_0FEE73047A0A8D10"/>great loss of memory, and with great ab∣sence of mind, when he first awoke from sleep, and increased into an entire derange∣ment. But in his most deranged state, he was full of great designs for mankind, and never betrayed a narrow thought, or one ungenerous purpose on any occasion. The aid of physicians in town and country was sought in vain, and the shocks were repeated, till an entire debility ensued, and at last the powers of speech failed, and in a violent fit of apoplexy, he expired at two o'clock on Thursday last, the 28th day of September.</P>
<P>Various causes have been assigned, of a calamity, which arrested a man, of so ap∣parently firm constitution, in the midst of his hopes and usefulness. But the effects do not so well correspond with the events, which occurred in his domestic circumstan∣ces, and his secular concerns, as to per∣suade us, that they were the remote, or
<PB N="21" REF="031800_0020_0FEE7307401DD8A0"/>immediate causes of his sufferings. The repeated breaches in his family, and the depredations on his property at sea, un∣doubtedly distressed him, but his natural cheerfulness, and the property he still pos∣sessed, relieved him from the worst appre∣hensions. From an intimate acquaintance, and an impartial inquiry, and from daily observation, it may be presumed, and from the history of his family and constitution, that what he suffered arose from no moral cause, and from no anxiety of mind, but from the nature of that disorder, which has so often arrested the best and most active men, and which did arrest on the past week a worthy gentleman of the same rank at the head of his division, and in the public discharge of his duty. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. Hull at the review in Concord. He has since recovered of this shock.</NOTE></P>
<P>High as may be our esteem of him in his public offices, we shall not value him
<PB N="22" REF="031800_0021_0FEE730B286965E0"/>less, when we observe his disposition in domestic life. In his first years, he was called to repay the cares of his aged pa∣rents, when he might have hoped to pro∣vide for his own advancement. The joy as well as fidelity with which he discharged this duty, is well known, and has been the subject of many a prophecy among the aged, respecting God's blessings upon him Such an ingenuous affection displays his worth in an unequivocal manner.</P>
<P>As an Husband, he passed in quick suc∣cession through various scenes, all of which were adapted to explain the firm habits of his mind. In the wife of his youth, he had sweet endearment. The short scene of gay, and fond life, which succeeded, served to fix his love of social joy, and the amiable virtues of his last companion were rich blessings upon the last scene of his useful∣ness, and in the hours which called for sympathy, fidelity, and the severest duty.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="031800_0022_0FEE730CAFC42640"/>
Of sympathy he felt all the cruelty, and yet he commanded all the virtue. His children were dear to him. They rose into life, but perished at the hour they ripened. An accomplished daughter of his hopes completed her education, and returned to her parents, to embrace them, and to die. He saw the fond mother in one of his chil∣dren, and found another home, but this expectation was soon lost. The mother and the babes soon passed to the silence of the grave. Yet another smiled on the world, and bid a speedy farewell in youth and innocence. In these scenes, he was tender, yet resigned. He with increased affection united to those who remained with him, and as the circle became small, he filled it more with his presence and his love. His manners were kind, and fami∣liar, and commanded respect. He was fond, easily excited to pity, but had a dig∣nity in his tears. Superiour to complaint, he listened to the complaints of other men,
<PB N="24" REF="031800_0023_0FEE30A7959FCC10"/>and engaged their confidence. Without fraud, his language seldom required an ex∣planation, and did not admit concealed purposes of evil. He never valued his friendship, till he had proved it, and never believed his own sincerity, till he had dis∣charged every obligation. Justice with him was all the good in his power. He was fond of favour, but he endeavoured to deserve it. He loved men, rather than opinions, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He professed the Unitarian doctrine.</NOTE> and he desired to know more of their actions, than of ther professions. As a just tribute, it may be said, that in his friendships, he was constant. Few men, so much in the world, knew so little of being in and out of favour. No resent∣ment made him deny any man's merit, and no enmity made him refuse to serve him. He blamed errour only when per∣sisted in. He made it the interest of his friends to forsake it, and judged of their sincerity by their actions. No explana∣tions
<PB N="25" REF="031800_0024_0FEE730E37ED2768"/>debarred them from a return. He lived and died, as truly as any man ever did, the friend of all mankind.</P>
<P>We freely inquire respecting the person of a man, whom we are taught to love. General Fiske, in his person, was of fine proportions; handsome; in his manners easy; had a dignity in his motions, and could command respect. He had a benevo∣lence in his countenance, while his eye was lofty, quick, and expressive. In his con∣versation, he was often impetuous; but soon calmed. Always sure of his motives, he was able to correct his natural fire from the heart. He never concealed his faults, confessed them, but rose above them by great virtues. When most zealous, he was most benevolent, and he could never be sudden, but when he had purposes of in∣stant good in his actions. His steps, his soul instantly partook of all his emotions, and he was all in every thing. His ambi∣tion
<PB N="26" REF="031800_0025_0FEE731252A67D88"/>was never dangerous, for it had no guilt. His fondness for praise, made him deserve it, and his pleasures were purely social. In his constitution he was firm, in his natural strength great, in his mus∣cles athletic. The conformation of his face had strong lines, but he could not long preserve any angry emotion. He dis∣covered his soul in his person, as much as in his actions.</P>
<P>When we consider the benefits, which mankind have derived from the benevo∣lent, we are convinced, that it is in the or∣der of divine providence, to accomplish the best designs for men, by the generous, and enlightened few, who appear in the succes∣sive ages of the world. No man has been able to exhibit that equality of talents, which qualifies all men to be equally use∣ful, enterprising and successful in any state of society. Such circumstances must com∣bine, such habits be formed, and such ge∣nerous
<PB N="27" REF="031800_0026_0FEE731657F5E170"/>zeal must exist, as can command the passions of mankind. In every coun∣try, in every pursuit, in every thing excel∣lent, this has been the privilege of few men, and therefore it may be considered as a peculiar blessing to any society, when such men are allied to its interest. Such indisputably was the friend whom we have this day in grateful remembrance, and whom we in the past week, followed, with the highest honours, to the tomb. To commemorate real worth, is to create it. Great examples develope character, and inspire virtue. The prophet celebrated in the text, was thus honourable. He knew the people were ignorant and corrupt; that a disposition for change was not to be resisted; that he was in danger from envy, competition, and interest. That the safe path to present ease was by flattery, consent, and conformity. Had he yielded, he could not have uttered that generous appeal by which he has been rendered im∣mortal.
<PB N="28" REF="031800_0027_0FEE7317E6922D10"/>History could not have reported any thing great or honourable of such a man. He therefore yielded to the generous purposes of his own heart. He did every good thing in his power. He was crown∣ed with the love, and rewarded with the prosperity of an whole nation. May we never forget the richness of the reward, or the glory of the service.</P>
<P>In such recitals, the scriptures are true to history. In all enlightened nations, such names are recorded at every eventful period. Consult even the history of the church. FATHERS have been reverenced in the primitive ages. We give this name to eminent men. If superstition has at∣tached itself to great names, it is not be∣cause men have been ungrateful, but be∣cause they were not philosophers. If men have reverenced great, though perverted talents, it was because they knew more of great talents, than of truth. The most
<PB N="29" REF="031800_0028_0FEE73196FDA7918"/>memorable superstition is ignorance grate∣ful to reward great zeal in the service of mankind. In the reformation, we cele∣brate the successful labours of men, indig∣nant at oppression. There have been as great men since, and more enlightened. When men are determined to do good, God always says, it shall prosper.</P>
<P>But why should we search antient re∣cords? Why should we explore distant re∣gions? The world is but one volume, and our own country has instructive pages open to our view. Our fathers boldly en∣terprised. We respect their names with gratitude. They have left no monuments, but in the memory of their labours. Their sons have arisen, have enlightened and in∣structed their country. Every where, there has been virtue, and glory. A father has begun a settlement, and has given his name, his character, and his hopes to all around him. In the state, the city, and
<PB N="30" REF="031800_0029_0FEE731D67D9FB08"/>the field, men arise to ensure the rewards of public gratitude. We are not without ex∣amples in all our various communities. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The funeral discourses lately printed in this county, upon the death of the Hon. Azor Orne, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>. of Marblehead, and of Col. John Low, of Gloucester, express the public sentiment.</NOTE> The obligations are universally known. A display of genius, is the developement of the human powers, by the force of circum∣stances in which they are placed. We see not the full strength of every man's capa∣city, nor do we suppose, that the man dis∣tinguished in some circumstances, would have been eminent in all. A great man aris∣es, and he diffuses light around him. He kindles up new suns to shine with native splendour, and genius has its glory. So a man of generous goodness gives his fairest character to the regions in which he has his habitation. This is confirmed in the history of the human mind. One mind <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Locke.</NOTE> employed on the human understanding,
<PB N="31" REF="031800_0030_0FEE73215B9AECD0"/>has given exalted wisdom to this divine philosophy. The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newton.</NOTE> principles of a philo∣sopher have disclosed the laws of nature. The pulpit <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Age of Louis XIV.</NOTE> was instructed in the last age, and humanity <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Howard.</NOTE> in the present. We all know the date of these events, when we commence our studies. Common minds follow up these eminent men to their last discoveries, and if they cannot pass be∣yond, they make familiar the path, which has been opened. So when a good exam∣ple of life has been fairly exhibited, with∣out any stretch of the human powers, men advance freely, and possess the best attain∣ments. Not half the labour is required to render men wise, which was necessary to confirm them in errour and ignorance.</P>
<P>And may we not confirm the same his∣tory of the virtues? One man teaches an whole nation to be brave. One man diffu∣ses a spirit of industry around him. One
<PB N="32" REF="031800_0031_0FEE7322E682CF78"/>man forms a love of order, and of peace. There is no virtue, which cannot dispossess the most inveterate errours, when it is esta∣blished in some great example. Men be∣come proud of the imitation. Cruel is the attempt to confine them to the measure of scanty virtue. When they copy in strength of desire, they produce with sure success, the highest virtues of our nature. It is enough to know where men live, under what influence they are directed, to know what is the measure of their hopes and of their virtues.</P>
<P>And must not then the progress of socie∣ty depend upon generous minds? The half taught parent must err in the most simple lessons of truth. The mind of the child cannot be happily expanded. The unqualified instructor delays the visits of knowledge till some future generation. The darkness of his own mind prevents truth from shining upon the world. But
<PB N="33" REF="031800_0032_0FEE732879DD7230"/>when his understanding is clear, he raises men to his own attainments, and grand elevation. They rise then with greater ease, than they could have grovelled below. This truth is not only clear, but momen∣tous. It is too much forgotten in the foolish satisfaction with past ignorance.</P>
<P>And shall not we take a lesson from this truth, as illustrated in the example of our friend? We have seen a generous man. We knew his services, and we confess his influence. Should we ever descend to things which are mean, we shall act unwor∣thy of the most just expectations. It is an happy reflection that our friend found ample support in some men, who possess the same virtues. We trust that they will continue to recommend the laudable prin∣ciples they have adopted. May they act upon their enlightened understandings, and while they remember the good things in their power, may they be in love with their highest duty.</P>

Consider the worth of our departed friend, and then can you wonder at our tears? Can you expect that we should have the last sight of our dearest friend, and not weep? that after an intimate ac∣quaintance, constant services, and uniform affection, we should forget the man, who has done so much to make us happy, and should separate without anguish? We are not so taught by our purest affections. Nor do we expect to be forsaken in our tears. Many will crowd around us, to partake in our sorrows. They will know our loss, and mourn with us the death of an HONOURABLE MAN. They who have been assisted, while entering into life, and have experienced the care of a benefactor, they will lament the man who so heartily rejoiced in their prosperity. The poor will remember that they are no longer to be∣hold him, who has so often administered relief to their wants. The mariner will think of him, who has so often sent charity
<PB N="35" REF="031800_0034_0FEE732E0D3F8A60"/>to the house, from which the husband was absent, or to which he could never return. While the soldier will pass in thought, over the joy, which his general and his friend could inspire. Every good man will mourn, when the friends of public happi∣ness forsake the world. But whatever re∣flections good men may indulge upon the melancholy changes of human life, they who have lived in the intimate affections must discharge the duties of the severest sympathy. We condole, in sincerity, with the bereaved widow, who is separated from the man, she loved. Her piety, her exem∣plary patience, and her sublime hopes will carry her to her God. The more rich our gifts, the greater the duty of resignation. Religion exalts the duty, while the greatest blessings form the severest obligation. We compassionate an aged relative, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Madam King, sister of his mother, and living in his family.</NOTE> who has shared his love, and found in his house, a quiet habitation. We pity an infirm bro∣ther,
<PB N="36" REF="031800_0035_0FEE7330D1F79818"/>who has lost the best of friends. We look with anxious concern to his sisters, who have received bountifully from his unceasing goodness. We behold a mourn∣ing family. May that sweet virtue, which in a daughter's heart, has lived to support a father in his infirmities, and to reward his affections, in his own bosom, find am∣ple reward from the purest blessings of Heaven. May the son see the father's vir∣tues, and emulate them. May this tender scene confirm the young daughter in all the duties of her domestic affections, and the renewed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. P. married two daughters of the general, successively.</NOTE> obligations of her husband urge his heart to the lovely cares which devolve upon him. May all the friends take the best lessons of life, and be wise unto salva∣vation. The calls of such a season of mourning are loud. We see where the proudest hopes of the present life do end, and the glory of the Christian. We learn the best recommendation of mutual love,
<PB N="37" REF="031800_0036_0FEE733391F899E8"/>and the only pure consolations of our dy∣ing moments. We soften our hearts by the tribute of sympathy, and understand the true honour of our character. May we imitate what is lovely in our friends, and receive with them an everlasting re∣ward. May virtue inspire our hope of heaven, and our purest joys be more perfect pleasures of benevolence, which on earth we have learned to enjoy with delight.</P>
