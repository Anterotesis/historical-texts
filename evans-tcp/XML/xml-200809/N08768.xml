</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is no way in which what is amiable can be better recom∣mended, than by holding up to view some eminent and unexcep∣tionable example in it's kind. We are formed for imitation, and find within ourselves an aptitude to resemble those we live among, and are conversant with. While our propensities are on the side of vice, as they will be until they are rectified by divine grace, we shall be more inclined to copy after a vicious, than a virtuous character; but this notwithstanding, few are corrupt to so great a degree as to be incapable of perceiving the beauty of virtue, or of being put upon endeavours to become possessed of it; espe∣cially when set in an agreable light by the lustre of some excelling example.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011206_0004_0F862C30C0A033B8"/>Hence it is that the sacred penmen have taken care to exhibit to public view the character of one and another, under the several dispensations of the kingdom of God's grace, who were eminently holy in their day; strongly recommending to universal observation these patterns of virtue, that such as are acquainted with them may be influenced to copy after them, to the honor of God, and the security of their own eternal well-being.</P>
<P>My text presents to the christian Jews such ex∣amples of faith and patience, as they had been fa∣voured with; and exhorts to an imitation of them: Especially, as it was through these graces, that they went to the enjoyment of the promised heavenly inheritance. "Be ye followers of them, who, through faith and patience, inherit the pro∣mises". In which words three particulars are con∣tained, which it may not be unprofitable, or unsea∣sonable, to spend a few thoughts upon.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. An intimation of the happiness of departed saints.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The described and specified way, through which they came to this happiness. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. A recommendation of their example to our special notice.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. The first thing observable in the text is, an intimation of the blessedness of departed saints. It is said of them, they "inherit the promises"; that is, the happiness "promised" to be enjoyed in the future world. And what deserves a particular remark, they are spoken of as NOW in the enjoy∣ment
<PB N="7" REF="011206_0005_0F862C3172CAE630"/>
of this happiness. "Who inherit the pro∣mises". The words are a periphrasis, expressive of the blessedness they are actually the subjects of in their <HI>unbodied</HI> state. Not that the spirits of just men are in a state of compleat happiness. This will not commence, until the great day of judg∣ment is over, when they shall ascend, in body as well as soul, with their Redeemer, to the heavenly world, and be fixed in those "mansions" of blessed∣ness he is "gone before to prepare for them". But previous to this, and instantly upon their death, they will enter upon a state of happiness; a state suted to them as naked spirits; a state wherein they shall be perfectly freed from all sin, tempta∣tion, and sorrow; and in which they shall enjoy the blessed God, far beyond what they ever did, or could do, while here on earth.</P>
<P>This truth, however uncertain from the deducti∣ons of meer reason, seems plainly evident from what is said upon it in the revealed word of God. It does not indeed, in a formal manner, speak of the spirits of good christians in their separate state, particularly describing their happiness there; but it says that concerning them, in so many places, and in language so positively clear and express, as to leave it beyond all reasonable doubt, that they still live, and that they live happy.</P>
<P>In the parable, recorded in the 16th chapter of Luke, Lazarus is spoken of as received, immedi∣ately at his death, to joy in the invisible world. So the account is, ver. 22. "And it came o pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom". And, in the 25th ver. it is
<PB N="8" REF="011206_0006_0F862C31AB92B578"/>
said, though he had here received "evil things", yet that he was "now comforted". What can these words intend, if his spirit was not in the en∣joyment of happiness? This seems to be one of the main thoughts, our Lord had in view to convey to us.</P>
<P>Very pertinent also to our purpose are those words of our Savior, Luke 23.43. "Verily, I say unto thee, TO DAY shalt thou be with me in paradise". They contain a promise to a poor dy∣ing malefactor, which would have no meaning, if it did not assure him, that, instantly upon his death, he should be admitted to a place of happiness; for that is the scripture idea of the word, "paradise". And what our Lord here promised to this thief, he promises also to all, who like him, are sincerely penitent. They also shall "be with him in para∣dise", upon their leaving this world. The day of their death will be to them a day of blessedness.</P>
<P>I may also bring to view those words of the Apostle, Philip. 1.21. "For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain". But how could death have been "gain" to him, if he did not thereupon enter into a world in which he should be happy? He adds, in the 23d ver. "for I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better". He here speaks of his "departure by death", as his "going to be with Christ", and so as that it would be "far bet∣ter" for him, than to "abide in the flesh". But could there be a possibility of this, unless it be sup∣posed, that there is a happy state, in which his soul would exist, after it's separation from his body?
<PB N="9" REF="011206_0007_0F862C328DBC1530"/>
And why should he be "in a strait", not knowing whether it was his "desire to depart, or abide" here, if his departure would not have placed him, as to his spirit, in a better state than that he was in at present?</P>
<P>I shall only add one text more, which deserves a more than ordinary notice; as it is introduced with all imaginable solemnity, as it were on pur∣pose, to engage our attention. It is thus recorded, Rev. 14.13. "And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me; write, blessed are the dead, which die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, faith the spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them". It is observable, they are dead saints that are the subjects of this blessedness; they are "from henceforth", from the day of their death, made thus blessed; and the special reason why they are thus blessed, is signified by no less a person than the Spirit of God. "Yea, saith the spirit", for that "they rest from their la∣bors, and their works do follow them", that is, the reward of their works; which would be impossible, unless, at death, they went into a state, in which they were favored with the enjoyment of the blessed God, the supreme good?</P>
<P>How should this truth, we have been illustrating, support and comfort such as have been bereaved of relatives, friends, or acquaintance, who were, in the eye of hope, the true disciples of Jesus Christ. You have no reason to mourn on their account. For, though their bodies may be laid in the dark and silent grave, they are still alive in regard of their souls, and incomparably more happy than
<PB N="10" REF="011206_0008_0F862C3328C3E5D8"/>
they could have been, had they still continued here. Should not the tho't of this, compose your minds to silence, however desirable those taken from you may have been, however bright their virtues, how∣ever amiable their conversation in the world? The higher they had attained in grace here, the greater is their reward in the state beyond the grave.—</P>
<P>I shall only add, such as are the faithful servants of God, have abundant reason to be perfectly re∣conciled to the thought of dying themselves. If, at death, the soul as well as body lay down sense∣less and inactive, it would be no wonder, if, when they turned their view to the grave, shuddering horror was excited in their breasts; though they knew, that, at the general resurrection, they should be again brought to life to be made happy forever. Death would appear, to the good man, in a me∣lancholy gloomy form, if it stripped him of all sense and life in soul, as well as body; and he might well be averse to pass through so dull an e∣vent. But the truth is, his better and superior part, the spirit God has formed within him, liveth, and abideth forever. His soul does not, like his body, lie down stupid; but is "carried, by the angels of God, to Abraham's bosom", where it ex∣ists happy in the enjoyment of that good, which is laid up in the divine promises. And, as this is the result of death to the true believer in Jesus, why should he be afraid to die? He should rather "de∣sire to depart, that he may be with Christ", where he will sin no more, nor be any more subjected to the tryals, and sorrows, that are inseperable from this present, frail, mortal state. —But I must pro∣ceed to the</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="011206_0009_0F862C33E3E3AEE0"/>II. Second thing contained in my next, which is, the way through which the saints come to "in∣herit the promises"; namely, that of "faith and patience". This is the way marked out in the "Gospel of the blessed God".</P>
<P>Without "faith", no christian was ever yet saved; nor will any one, in future time, be ad∣mitted to the joy of his Lord. Our Savior, who surely knew the way to heaven, has plainly de∣clared, that it is through "faith" in him. You are all acquainted with the texts to this purpose. Only, it should ever be remembered, this faith is not an empty speculation. It is not an inactive, dead faith; but a faith that "works by love", that "purifies the heart", and argues the subject of it to be one "born of God", and an "over∣comer of the world". It is that faith, by which "the just do live", and that is an abiding, habi∣tual, powerful principle of all holy conformity to the will of God, both in heart and life, in a way of suffering as well as doing.</P>
<P>And as it is "through faith", so is it likewise "through patience", that the saints "inherit the promises". Hence that exhortation of the Apostle, Heb. 12.1. "Let us run with patience the race set before us". The way to the heavenly inheri∣tance is rough. It is strawed with difficulties of one kind, and another. And those who would walk in this way, had need be armed with "pati∣ence". They will often have occasion for the ex∣ercise of this grace; nor can they, unless they are, in a measure, the subjects of it, ever make progress towards the heavenly state. None have ever gone
<PB N="12" REF="011206_0010_0F862C35CB513398"/>
to "inherit the promises", but through tryals, and so many of them, as that, if they had not been en∣dowed with "patience", they would have given out. This grace in them has been often called forth to exercise; and, in this way, they have at∣tained to happiness in the future state.</P>
<P>But it may more emphatically be said, with re∣ference to some of the saints, that, "through faith and patience", they are gone to "inherit the pro∣mises".</P>
<P>It was in this way that many of the first chri∣stians glorified God, and went to the enjoyment of him. The tryals and sufferings they were called to endure for the name of Christ, were many, and grievously heavy. They had "the tryal of cruel mockings and scourgings; yea, of bonds and im∣prisonment". They were "sawn asunder; and slain with the sword". They were "destitute, afflicted, and tormented". And, under these cir∣cumstances of distress, how did they rely on God! What full credit did they give to his word and promises! How chearfully did they resign up, even their very lives into his hands! And how exem∣plary was their "patience"? They made no com∣plaints against the conduct of heaven: They did not murmur, or repine; but bore all that was laid upon them, with composedness of mind. They were willing to suffer in the cause of Christ; and "counted not their lives dear to them, so that they might finish their course with joy".</P>
<P>And as it was with the first christians, so it has been with many since, and with some even in these
<PB N="13" REF="011206_0011_0F862C371ACD09C8"/>
days; they went to the "inheritance" eminently "through faith and patience". God's hand was laid heavy upon them. Many, various, and sadly grievous were the tryals it pleased the alwise, and righteous Governor of the world to exercise them with. And, when distressed on every side, how bright did the graces of "faith and patience" ap∣pear in them! They "set their hope in God".— They rested their souls on his promises.—And the more sharp and cutting their sorrows, the more firm was their faith in the revelations of God, the more vigorous the actings of it. And, in stead of "re∣sisting the will", or "disputing the pleasure" of the almighty, they justified the wisdom of his deal∣ings with them, and "patiently" received correcti∣on from the hand of their heavenly father. Their greatest concern was, lest they should reflect dis∣honor on the name and religion of Christ, by a temper and behavior, unbecoming their character as his disciples; and, by the aids of divine grace, they were enabled to bear their tryals, however se∣vere, with meekness of wisdom, a calm, patient, and submissive frame of mind. And in this way it was, that they went to "inherit the promises".</P>
<P>We should herefrom learn to entertain just sen∣timents of the tryals good men are often called, in the providence of God, to conflict with. It is by these occasion is given, and opportunity offered, for those discoveries of faith, patience, and other chri∣stian graces, whereby God is, in a signal manner, glorified, and his tried servants prepared for more distinguished mansions in the place of future bless∣edness. Perhaps, there is no such school to train up, and perfect the christian, as that of affliction.
<PB N="14" REF="011206_0012_0F862C37ABCCB908"/>
Those who have been called to pass through the heaviest, and most numerous tryals, have, by their improvements under them, being assisted herein by the divine Spirit, been enabled to shine with a peculiar lustre, to the honor of Christ; and their reward here∣upon has been "great in heaven". Let not any esteem good men unhappy, though they should be sorely afflicted: Neither should they think thus of themselves. "If they suffer with Christ", in the exercise of faith and patience, in imitation of him, they shall be "glorified with him". And "what are the sufferings of this present life", when "compared with the glory", which shall, in the next state, be "revealed in those who are the sons of God"? They are not worthy to be mention∣ed.—They are lighter than nothing. But I may not enlarge.</P>
<P N="3">III. The next thing observable in my next is, an exhortation to follow those, who, "through faith and patience, inherit the promises".</P>
<P>We should be imitators of them in every thing, wherein they appeared amiable and lovely. Have we beheld, in departed saints, any thing worthy of God, and of their character as the disciples of his son Jesus Christ? We should not rest satisfied in having seen these things; but should carefully place their example before our view, and copy after it, wherein it was praise-worthy. It is a favor of God, to have had such patterns of virtue, and his expectation that we make a wise and good use of such an advantage: Nor can we, without sin, suf∣fer such examples to pass our notice; expressing little or no care to be imitators of them. We should
<PB N="15" REF="011206_0013_0F862C387272B7F8"/>
employ our thoughts on the virtues and graces, saints departed exhibited, in their lives, learn therefrom our own duty, and encourage ourselves heartily to engage in the practice of it. We should make use of their good examples, both as a <HI>copy,</HI> and a <HI>motive:</HI> Only keeping in mind this needful thought, that the best of men are but men, and to be imitated with subserviency to the great rule of duty contained in the sacred books of scripture. Their virtues, and not their frailties and imperfecti∣ons, are to be remembered and followed by us. We should be "followers of them, wherein they followed Christ"; and no farther.</P>
<P>And we should endeavour an imitation of de∣parted saints, especially in their "faith and pati∣ence". These are amiable, as well as important graces; beautifying to the subjects of them, and nearly connected with their highest interest in the coming world. It will therefore conduce to our own honor, and best good, to become possessed of them; and that we may so do, we cannot be too careful to copy after the pattern set us by those, who, as occasions were offered therefor in the con∣duct of providence, have signalised themselves for the exercise of these graces.</P>
<P>Have any, within the reach of our notice, been, in an uncommon degree, exemplary for the firm∣ness, constancy, and vigor of their "faith" in the perfections, and revelations of God; ever repair∣ing to him as the supreme object of their trust, the ultimate refuge of their souls, in those lively act∣ings of "faith", which we could not but admire? We should not be forgetful observers of such distin∣guishing
<PB N="16" REF="011206_0014_0F862C39508C57E8"/>
faith in God, and in his son Jesus Christ; but should keep it steadily in our view, that we also, under the influence of heaven, may become eminent instances of "like precious faith".</P>
<P>So likewise, if we have had opportunity to be∣hold the "patience" of those, whose lot it has been to pass through numerous difficulties, and sore tryals; if we have seen them, under the heaviest pressures, calm, quiet, resigned to God, and in a temper of mind, not to murmur and complain, but to acknowledge, and say, "I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that in faithful∣ness thou hast afflicted me";—we should look up∣on ourselves as instructed by God, and laid under obligations, should there be opportunity for it, to be like examples ourselves of this grace, which has been thus gloriously displayed in the conduct of others.</P>
<P>One design of God, in placing before our view these instances of "faith and patience" is, that we might learn our duty, and be animated with zeal and resolution to put it in practice. It should be our earnest endeavour to answer this intention of heaven; taking all due care, that such examples of God's grace may not, by our own non-improve∣ment, or mis-improvement, of them, rise up in judgment to our shame and condemnation.</P>
<P>The reflections, upon what has been discoursed, are as follow.</P>
<P>We should, while we admire and imitate what we have seen, that is amiable in departed good christians, give God the glory of his grace bestow∣ed
<PB N="17" REF="011206_0015_0F862C3AD24B51B0"/>
on them. Whatever we may have seen in them, that was lovely and beautiful, they were be∣holden to God for it. He it was that made them to differ. While therefore we take notice of what was virtuous and praise-worthy in them, we should remember to acknowledge God. We should look through them to him, and be disposed to give him the honor of that grace which appeared in them.</P>
<P>We should also take occasion, from the good example of other, to humble ourselves wherein we have been unexemplary, and endeavour a reforma∣tion. We cannot make a wiser and better im∣provement of the piety, the humility, the meek∣ness, the faith, the patience, and other christian graces, we may have seen manifested in the lives of those we have been acquainted with, than by turning our view to ourselves, and enquiring, with a becoming seriousness, how we have had our con∣versation in the world. And wherein we are desti∣tute of that, which we could not but approve as exemplarily excellent in those that are gone before us, we should be abased in a sense of our own neg∣ligent carelessness; condemning ourselves, and re∣solving, in the strength of God, that we will take better heed to our ways for the time to come. If we have been greatly deficient in any of those vir∣tues and graces, in which they shined with peculiar brightness, we should look upon ourselves as ad∣monished and warned of God; and be instant, and arduous, in our endeavours to cause our light to shine with the like lustre.—And if, in stead of be∣ing only defective in their graces, we are defiled with the contrary vices, we should see ourselves re∣proached, and solemnly called upon to repent and
<PB N="18" REF="011206_0016_0F862C3B8B327868"/>
reform. Can we think of that grace of God, which eminently appeared in this, or the other relative, or friend, or neighbour, or minister, that is gone to "inherit the promises", and not feel the resent∣ments of an accusing conscience? We have cer∣tainly awful reason to judge, and condemn our∣selves. May we receive reproof, learn our folly, be struck with the beauties of holiness in these pat∣terns of it, and copy after them, so as to exceed them in glory!</P>
<P>In fine, we are obviously taught, from what has been discoursed, our duty with respect to departed saints. We should not pray for them, neither should we pray to them. Such prayers, however common in the Roman church, are both needless and senseless. But we should remember the grace of God, which appeared in their faith, and pati∣ence, their holy, heavenly, and christian behavior in life; and be excited herefrom to the grea∣test diligence, in the use of all proper means, that we also may attain to a noble eminency in very thing that is virtuous.</P>
<P>This leads me to take some special notice of the occasion which put me upon bringing you such a discourse at this time, the death of the Reverend Dr. SEWALL; who was justly held in high reputation, throughout the town, and land, for those excellent qualities, in which he shone with exemplary brightness, both as a christian, and a minister, from a youth to protracted old age.</P>
<P>The father of Spirits was pleased to furnish him with valuable intellectual powers. These, by the
<PB N="19" REF="011206_0017_0F862C3CDB482950"/>
advantage of a good education, were happily cul∣tivated and improved; and, being sanctified by divine grace, were faithfully employed in promo∣ting the interest of "pure and undefiled religion".</P>
<P>He was early devoted to the service of the sanctu∣ary by his father, that upright CHIEF JUSTICE, the honorable Judge SEWALL, who, for a long course of years, was a member of this Church, and one of it's greatest ornaments. And to this ser∣vice, from inclination, he freely devoted himself.</P>
<P>He was called by you of this Church to the work of the Gospel-ministry, the 25th of April, 1712; but he returned no answer to your call, until he had often asked direction of God; setting apart some special seasons for this purpose by himself a∣lone, and once at least in union with his venerable, pious father, who was ever ready to the business of prayer, and took great delight in it.</P>
<P>He was publicly and solemnly seperated to the work, to which you had called him, "by fasting, and prayer, and laying on of the hands of the presby∣tery", the 16th of September, 1713; from which time, he labored in the Gospel-ministry, among you, with as little intermission, by reason of those infirmities to which we are all subject, as has been ordinarily known. Few ministers ever enjoyed a more uninterrupted state of health, going on with more steady constancy in his public labors for the Lord.</P>
<P>His discourses from the pulpit were chiefly upon the distinguishing, and most important points of christianity, relative both to faith &amp; practice. They
<PB N="20" REF="011206_0018_0F862C3CE749C510"/>
were the effect of study; composures discovering judgment, and an intimate acquaintance with the holy scriptures. His manner in delivering them was serious, grave, solemn; and sometimes he ut∣tered himself with a voice so elevated with zeal, and so modulated under the influence of a deeply affected heart, as that he arrested the attention of his hearers; putting them under advantage to be impressed with a just sense of the importance of what he was saying to them. The blessed Jesus, in fulfillment of his promise, made to the Apostles, and succeeding gospel-ministers, was graciously present with him, to enliven his faith, to comfort his heart, and to strengthen his hands in going on with resolute, diligent, and persevering fidelity in discharging the great trust it had pleased God to commit to him; and his labors, thro' the blessing of heaven, were not in vain: Some, we trust, were by him, as the instrument in the hands of Christ, "turned from darkness to light, and from the power of sin and satan unto God"; while others, who had been walking "in the path of the just", were enabled to walk on "shining more and more" until they arrived at "perfect day". It is not to be doubted, but that, upon his entrance into the invisible world, he became associated with those, among other "spirits of just men made perfect", who were formed by his ministry, under the influ∣ence of the holy Ghost, for their admission to such blessed company, beyond the grave.</P>
<P>He was in conversation agreably pleasant; and the more so, as his affability was ever mixed with a becoming gravity. He seldom failed of intro∣ducing discourse that tended to spiritual edification.
<PB N="21" REF="011206_0019_0F862C3DA44195F0"/>
This was more especially his manner in the latter part of his life. I question, whether he allowed himself to go out of company without dropping something of the religious kind; and he did it so naturally, without any appearance of affectation, that he left a testimony in the hearts of all, to the greatness of his piety.</P>
<P>This indeed was eminently his glory. He was "a dovout man, one that feared God, and prayed alway". I find, in his private papers, the record of numerous days set apart for solemn prayer, often with fasting, mostly by himself alone, and some∣times in union with others; at which times, you, the people of his charge, were particularly remem∣bered before the throne of mercy. He had upon his mind an habitually prevailing sense of the su∣perintending government of God, both in the king∣dom of providence, and of grace; and he accord∣ingly ever repaired to him as the alone all-sufficient help. And this was especially his practice under the various tryals he was called to pass through, some of which were grievously heavy, and gave opportunity, as well as occasion, for the signal ex∣ercise of that "faith and patience through which" he is gone to "inherit the promises". His whole conduct indeed was a bright pattern of those chri∣stian graces, which, being so often thrown out into act, became in him the governing principles of life. You of this Society are "witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and unblamably he behav∣ed" among you. "Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, (decent, comely) whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
<PB N="22" REF="011206_0020_0F862C3F538B0188"/>
things are of good report":—These were the things in which he was an example to you, and to the whole town; who are all ready to rise up, and speak of him as one they venerated for his conspi∣cuous piety, uprightness, and universal goodness.</P>
<P>His conscience, from his youthful days, was re∣markably tender. This made him, all along in life, watchful over his heart, and ways; and en∣gaged his care to "abstain from even the appear∣ance of evil". The life of no one was more freed from the defilements of sin. He was, in an un∣common degree, "blameless and harmless; a son of God without rebuke in the midst of a perverse generation, among whom he shined". Possibly, he might be scrupulous to an excess. And if he was herefrom restrained, at any time, from those exertions which would have tended to good, it ought to be ascribed to that "awe of God", which was habitually and powerfully present in his mind. Whenever duty lay clearly open to his view, he acted with vigor and boldness; as being influenced from that love of God, which overpowered the fear of man.</P>
<P>He was distinguished among the Clergy for his wisdom, not "the wisdom of this world", to which he was an utter stranger; but "the wisdom that is from above, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, easie to be intreated, full of mercy and good <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, without partiality, and without hypocrisie". I know of no man that discovered more prudent caution, through his whole behavior in life. He ever acted, especially in affairs of importance, with deliberation, and upon having viewed them in their
<PB N="23" REF="011206_0021_0F862C3FEE1F01C0"/>
circumstances, and probable consequences. No one, I believe, can mention an instance wherein he conducted with precipitant rashness.</P>
<P>In consideration of the many good qualities in which he excelled, he was, so long ago as the year 1724, upon the death of President Leverett, cho∣sen, in his room, to take the head ship of Harvard-College, in Cambridge. Upon the news of this, which, as his own words are, was "surprising to him", I find him making that pious reflection, "O Lord! what am I, a sinful worm, that there should be any tho't of me for so considerable a trust"! This choice of him to so important a service, lay with great weight upon his mind, partly from his own modest diffidence, but principally from the ardor of his affection towards you of this Church and congregation. He often carried the case to God in humble earnest prayer, and more than once set apart a day for solemn application to him who dwelleth on high for direction in an affair of such consequence. On one of these days, he writes thus; "I besought the Lord to give all needed direction to the overseers, the flock I stand related to, and to my self. I also endeavoured to examine myself;—and, if I know my own heart, my in∣clination is to abide with my dear people, and to spend and be spent in the work of the ministry here, if this be the will of God, and most for his glory. I think I can truly say, that no prospect of greater worldly honor, or gain, would prevail with me to leave this people; and that I do not account my life too dear to be spent in the service of Christ among them". You, the people of his charge, expressed a like affection towards him, in
<PB N="24" REF="011206_0022_0F862C40AC81D450" MS="y"/>
your voted unwillingness to part with him. Upon which, your beloved Pastor, having again asked the direction of heaven, thus writes; "I suppose that now God makes my way plain to give an answer in the negative, which I accordingly did"; adding that wish of piety, "Lord! provide a more sutable and sufficient person for that important trust".</P>
<P>About four years after this, he was elected a member of the College-corporation; which trust he accepted, and executed with consciencious fidelity, and a becoming zeal to promote, among the sons of HARVARD, not only learning in the liberal arts and sciences, but religion also both in it's <HI>doctrinal</HI> and <HI>practical</HI> purity. He sustained this office, approving himself a steady faithful friend to the truest interest of the College, until it became inconvenient, by reason of his age, to attend the necessary services of it any longer. He was more than once generously handsome in his donations to this Society.</P>
<P>When Mr. Belcher returned from England, Go∣vernor of this Province, he brought for him the honor of a Diaploma from the famous university at Edinburgh, in Scotland, constituting him a Doctor in Divinity. This honor was conferred on him without his seeking it, or indeed so much as knowing any thing relative to it, until it was be∣stowed on him.</P>
<P>He was, for many years, one of the commissi∣oners from the London-Corporation for propagat∣ing the gospel in New-England, and parts adja∣cent;
<PB N="25" REF="011206_0023_0F862C4168989400"/>
as also a correspondent-member of the So∣ciety in Scotland, for promoting christian know∣ledge. And as his duty, in these trusts, respected the interest of Christ among the INDIAN natives, a more sutable person could not have been selected, and commissioned. His heart was strongly touch∣ed with pity towards these perishing barbarous people; and, from a deep sense of their unhappi∣ness, through ignorance of the true God, and the only Savior, Jesus Christ, he was ever disposed to do whatever lay in his power, in execution of the trust that had been committed to him, to serve the interest of their souls, according to the Gospel-plan of salvation.</P>
<P>It would be a great omission, if I did not make mention of him as one of those "good men, for whom one would even dare to die". He was, in his temper, pitiful, tender-hearted, courteous, kind∣ly affectioned; and, from principle as a christian, he "forgat not to do good, and communicate", as he had opportunity, and according to his ability. It was his practice to lay by one full tenth of his income for the uses of piety and charity. And sometimes, as occasions in providence called for it, he went even beyond this. Many are gone to heaven, and many still live on the earth, who were often relieved, under straits and necessities, by the distributions of his bounty. I doubt not, our Lord Jesus Christ will say to him, in the great day of judgment, "I was, in my mystical body, an hun∣gred, and thou gavest me meat; I was thirsty, and thou gavest me drink; naked, and thou clothedst me: I was sick, and thou visitedst me; I was in prison, and thou camest unto me:" In conse∣quence
<PB N="26" REF="011206_0024_0F862C422D7373C8"/>
of which, we may hope, he will bespeak him in those words of abounding grace, "come thou blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom pre∣pared for thee from the foundation of the world."</P>
<P>He was a strenuous asserter of our civil and ec∣clesiastical CHARTER-RIGHTS and PRIVILEDGES. He knew the value of them.—He knew they were the purchase of our fore-fathers at the expence of much labor, blood, and treasure.—He could not bear the thought of their being wrested out of our hands.—He esteemed it our duty, in all wise, rea∣sonable, and legal ways, to endeavour the preser∣vation of them.—And it was the earnest wish of his heart, that they might be fully enjoyed by us, and transmitted from us, in the fullest extent, to the latest generations.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 26th of last August, the day on which he compleated FOURSCORE YEARS, he spake to you from this desk, with affectionate gratitude to God upon such an extraordinary oc∣casion, and so as to endeavour your spiritual edifi∣cation. He was not permitted, after this, to preach to you more than three or four times. It seemed good to the wisdom of God to confine him several months to his chamber; in which time he had op∣portunity to dispense, to the many who went to visit him, those counsels and instructions of piety, which, if it be not their own fault, may be of lasting spiritual advantage to them. And occasion also was now offered him, in the providence of God, by the repeated attacks that were made upon his naturally firm, but now breaking, constitution, for the ex∣emplary exercise of faith, patience, and those other
<PB N="27" REF="011206_0025_0F862C42EC83D408"/>
virtues, which adorned his character as a christian, and gospel-minister, and reflected honor on his master and Lord, whose grace, bestowed on him, now shone with conspicuous lustre. It was plea∣sant to behold the peaceful, placid, resigned, pray∣ing frame he was in. He could, while life remain∣ed in any considerable degree of strength, speak of dying with a cheerful countenance, and as one that "had a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better than to abide in the flesh". I have sometimes heard him, with a solemnly en∣gaging pathos, express himself in these words, "Come Lord Jesus! come quickly"! His fear was, lest he should not wait with due christian sub∣mission, until his change should come. For some hours before his decease, he was unable to speak; though he appeared to have the exercise of his un∣derstanding: And, doubtless, he breathed out his soul, "calling upon God", and saying, in some such language as that, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit"! Which, we trust, he graciously did; send∣ing the holy angels, those "ministring spirits, who minister to them who are heirs of salvation", to convoy it safe to that apartment of the invisible world, which is the assigned place of residence for "the spirits of just men made perfect".</P>
<P>I shall make no apology for having said so much to do honor to the memory of Dr SEWALL: Had I said less, it would have needed one. Such ex∣amples of shining virtue, and eminent usefulness, are highly instructive, and should be held up to the view of the world; especially in this day of grow∣ing degeneracy. It would be unsutably to with∣hold that, which would happily tend to promote
<PB N="28" REF="011206_0026_0F862C43CE5F1B90"/>
the honor of God, and the good of mankind, if no just notice should be taken of those, who have so worthily served God, and their generation ac∣cording to his will.</P>
<P>It may have moved the passions of those nearly related to the deceased, while attending to the cha∣racter that has been given of him; but if they weep, it should be for themselves, not for him; as they have such abundant reason to believe, that he has "entered into the joy of his Lord". May they be enabled to make a wise and holy use of this dis∣pensation in the alwise providence of God!</P>
<P>We unite in our prayers for the only son, and immediate descendant from him whose death we are solemnising. Be thankful to God for the signal ad∣vantage you enjoyed in having so good a father, and in having him continued a blessing to you for so protracted a space of time. His prayers for you, especially for your spiritual welfare, were frequent and earnest. He scarce ever set apart a day for prayer, which was a common thing with him, but you are mentioned by name, in his records, as hav∣ing had a special share in his supplications before the throne of grace. May they be answered in the bestowment of all needed favors on you, especially of spiritual and eternal blessings thro' Jesus Christ! Your children are, some of them, in childhood, others in their youthful days. It would be an oc∣casion of joy to their grand-parent, even in para∣dise, could he know that they are "found walking in the truth, as they have received a commandment from the father". And could he speak to them from the excellent glory, as he often did while here on
<PB N="29" REF="011206_0027_0F862C44655294A8"/>
earth, it would be in some such language as that, "remember now your Creator in the days of your childhood and youth;—know ye the God of your fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind: If ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will cast you off forever". Let me, who was your grand∣father's friend, and relative, be permitted, in his stead, now he is gone, to exhort you, my children, in your earliest days, to devote yourselves to the honor of your maker, through Jesus Christ the redeemer; taking him to be your instructor, guide, God, and everlasting portion. This will be your best guard against the temptations of an evil world; this will yield you most satisfaction all along in life; this will be your support and comfort in the day of death; and this, of the rich mercy of God, through Jesus Christ, will secure your eternal wel∣fare in the state that is beyond the grave. The good Lord impress your young and tender minds with a deep sense of these things, which are infi∣nitely important!</P>
<P>It may be esteemed a frown in providence, that the ELISHA of this christian Society should not be present to see their ELIJAH taken away, and to assist them in making a sanctified improvement of such a visitation. Had he been here, he might with propriety have "cried, my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof"! Nor could he have made a better adapted prayer for himself than that, "let a double portion of thy spirit rest upon me"! May it please the Savior of his people to help him under his infirmities, to prosper his long journey for the removal of them,
<PB N="30" REF="011206_0028_0F862C45CF808180"/>
and to return him to his flock with a restored, con∣firmed state of health, and to continue him for many years yet to come an eminently pious, dili∣gent, faithful, and useful servant of Jesus Christ, after the example of his departed father, and asso∣ciate in the Gospel-ministry! We cannot wish for him a greater blessing.</P>
<P>The death we are taking a religious notice of, is a loud call to the town in general, and to it's ministers in particular; and the louder, as it was preceeded, the week before, with the death of a∣nother of it's most ancient and valuable laborers in the work of the Gospel. The like was never known, from the first settlement of the town, until now. Such reiterated dispensations, in the righte∣ous and holy government of heaven, deserve a more than ordinary attention. The voice of God, especially to the ministers here, is that, "be ye also ready";—"work the work of him that sent you, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work". May they "to day hear his voice, and not harden their hearts"! This voice from God more especially speaks to those among us who are advanced in years. We are told by it, that we shall "shortly put off these our tabernacles". The Lord impress our hearts with a just sense of this serious and important truth! And may we here∣from be powerfully guarded against being "neg∣ligent to put" the people of our respective charges "in remembrance" of the great truths of God and religion; and equally excited, "as long as we are in these tabernacles, to stir them up" by calling their attention to these things, which are infinitely interesting and important! And may we so "take
<PB N="31" REF="011206_0029_0F862C46348B3F88"/>
need to ourselves, and to our doctrine as to save both ourselves, and them that hear us"!</P>
<P>Permit me now to leave a few seasonable words with the flock of Christ in this place; which, if received in love, and duly deliberated on, may, by the blessing of God, be profitable to you.</P>
<P>Be thankful to the great "head over all things to the church, which is his body", for the rich gift you received from him, when he gave you your now deceased pastor.—Take a becoming notice of the uncommon kindness of heaven in continuing him to you, with so little interruption in his work, for so long a period as nearly fifty six years.— Consider his death as brought about, as to it's manner, and in all it's circumstances, under the super-intending agency of that glorious Sovereign, "whose throne is in the heavens, and whose king∣dom ruleth over all"; and give him the honor of a profound submission to his alwise and righte∣ous pleasure.</P>
<P>Enquire each one of you, what effect the messa∣ges, God was pleased to send you by this his ser∣vant, have had upon you. Some of you, it may be, have been awakened to attend to the concerns of your souls.—Do not rest satisfied, until you have so gone to Christ, as to be in a state of safety, respecting the eternal world! Some of you, it may be, have been savingly converted to God;—while you ascribe to him the glory of his rich grace, re∣tain in your minds a becoming affection for the instrument used in the conveyance of it. Some of you, it may be, have been supported and comfort∣ed under spiritual fears and temptations, or out∣ward
<PB N="32" REF="011206_0030_0F862C4789F42438"/>
distressing difficulties, while others have been encouraged, and strengthened to go on with chear∣fulness, speed, resolution and vigor, in the way to∣wards the heavenly kingdom;—you will never forget him, who, under God, has been so great a blessing to you. His name, with you, will be as "precious ointment". Some of you, it may be, have turned a deaf ear to die many warnings he has solemnly given you, from this desk, in the name of the Lord; "setting at nought all his counsels", and practically throwing contempt upon his reproofs: You have abundant reason for deep humiliation before God. Let me urge you to arise out of your sleep in sin, and to call on God, if perhaps he may grant you repentantce and for∣giveness. This only will save you from the wrath to come.</P>
<P>In a word, you should all frequently call to mind the great truths pertaining to the kingdom of God, and of Jesus Christ, which you have had so pres∣singly delivered to you. "I beseech you, bre∣thren, and exhort you, by the Lord Jesus Christ, that, as ye have received" of your deceased pastor "how ye ought to walk, so ye would abound more and more". Be not "led away with the error of the wicked"—"fall not from your sted∣fastness; but "give all diligence to add to your faith every other christian grace". For "if these things be in you, and abound, ye shall never fall; but entrance shall be ministred to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord, and Sa∣vior Jesus Christ".</P>
<P>You are, by reason of the present distance of your surviving pastor, as sheep without a shepherd.
<PB N="33" REF="011206_0031_0F862C4823B15440"/>
May it please "the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls" to keep you from "going astray", to pre∣serve your union in love, to direct your steps, and govern your whole conduct, in your present cir∣cumstances, so as that your spiritual advantage may thereby be promoted in the end!</P>
<P>I shall not think it impertinent, because not un∣seasonable, to say here, though out of place, that Dr. SEWALL, after he had been excused, at his own repeated desire, on account of the infirmities of age, from taking his turn at the THURSDAY-LECTURE, was prevailed on to preach it once more, when he thought it his duty to bear his last, and, as it were, dying testimony against the shameful neglect with which this religious opportunity was treated; at the same time, offering that which was powerfully adapted to awaken a concern in all serious minds to improve this special season for their spiritual good, as they might easily do it, in much greater numbers, without damage to their secular business. The pious and well-judged ad∣dress he was enabled to make, upon this occasion, had a temporary good effect. The lecture was observably better attended;—but there soon came on a relapse into that same carelessness, which he had reproved, and endeavoured to guard against. Surely, our churches here have lost their first love to God's worship, and zeal to improve sutable op∣portunities for their edification in faith and holi∣ness! And they should "remember from whence they are fallen, and repent, and do their first works". That prayer was never more pertinent, than at this day; "revive thy work, O Lord", in these de∣clining churches! And should it please God to do
<PB N="34" REF="011206_0032_0F862C4BF9865950"/>
this, I may venture to say, without pretending to the spirit of prophecy, that there will not then be so thin, and scandalous an appearance at our FIFTH-DAY-LECTURE.</P>
<P>I shall only add, as occasion is given us, in the government of providence, to adopt the language of scripture, and say, "our fathers where are they? and the prophets do they live for ever"? We should be in the exercise of faith in the only living God, with whom is "the residue of the Spirit"; trusting that he will raise up, qualifie, and send forth, a succession of those, who shall support his cause, and shine more conspicuously in his Church, than any who have gone before.</P>
<P>Now "to him who only hath immortality"; who is "the same yesterday, to day, and forever"; who is "God over all from everlasting to ever∣lasting":—To him be given all glory and honor, dominion and blessing, by all creatures in heaven and earth, throughout the endless ages of Eternity. AMEN AND AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. From the Boston <HI>Evening-Post,</HI> of July 3d. 1769.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>BOSTON</HI>
<DATE><HI>June</HI> 29. 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ON Tuesday Evening last died the Reverend JOSEPH SEWALL, D. D. senior Pastor of the South Church in this Town, in the 81st Year of his Age.</P>
<P>Dr. SEWALL's descent was honourable—His Father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hon. SAMUEL SEWALL, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></NOTE> was elected a Magistrate of the Massachusetts Colony 1684, was afterwards appointed one of the first Council under the present Charter, and was annually elected until 1725, when he resigned his Seat at the Council-Board— He was also many years Chief Justice of the Province and Judge of Probates for the County of Suffolk, and was one of the most eminent Persons of his day for piety, learning, wisdom, integrity and universal charity.</P>
<P>The Son was every way worthy of such an excellent Father. Scarce any one ever passed through life with a more unblemished character, or performed its various duties with more universal esteem.</P>
<P>He who formeth the spirit of man within him, was pleased to favour him with valuable intellectual endow∣ments; these were rendered more bright and useful by his literary acomplishments—He particuarly excelled as a classic scholar; and retained his classical learning to an uncommon degree in his advanced years— But the gifts of nature and all his acquired learning were eclipsed by his exalted piety and exemplary virtue.</P>
<P>He was under the influence of religion from his early days. While but a youth, there was such an uncommon seriousness and strict regularity in his whole walk, as at∣tracted the notice of all his acquaintance, and command∣ed respect even from those who were superior to him in age.—Tho' his family was among the first in the coun∣try, both for dignity and estate, he aimed at nothing
<PB N="36" REF="011206_0034_0F862C4D8E5E5C28"/>
higher than to serve God in the ministry of his Son.— Divinity was always his favourite study, not so much from duty as inclination. The subject suted his taste, as it led him to a more intimate acquaintance with God, and tended to improve his mind in piety and holiness.</P>
<P>The South Church no sooner had a taste of his gifts, than they invited him to take part of the ministry with that great and good man the late Rev. Mr. PEMBERTON. He was ordained over them Sept. 16, 1713, and con∣tinued almost constantly to carry on the work of the ministry till the last year of his life.</P>
<P>From his childhood he knew the holy scriptures, his acquaintance with them encreased as he grew in years— He could recite them with an exactness to which few have attained, and knew how to explain and apply them with readiness and propriety, both in public and in private. "From these he extracted his Divinity; from these, the maxims of his conduct; and by these, was made wise to salvation"</P>
<P>His preaching was solid, scriptural, instructive and pathetic—He had a clear and distinct apprehension of the truths of religion, and well understood the analogy of faith—He did not entertain his hearers with the subtleties of the schools, or with curious and unprofitable speculati∣ons—His chief care was to explain and enforce the great articles of the christian faith and evangelical rules of life; to teach what we must believe, and how we must live, in order to be eternally happy— He was in principle a Calvinist, and made the doctrines, which are usually call∣ed the doctrines of Grace, the foundation, and the chief subjects of his preaching; but he was far from the dan∣gerous extremes to which some have carried these doct∣rines. While he was solicitous to secure the honor of divine grace, he was equally careful to show the neces∣sity of holy obedience, and earnestly pressed on unrenew∣ed sinners the importance of their improving the means of grace, if they had any desire to obtain an interest in Christ, and to become his sincere disciples. He convey∣ed his sentiments in easy, chaste language; and delivered himself with that becoming gravity, and seriousness, that commanding elocution and decent affection, as almost
<PB N="37" REF="011206_0035_0F862C4E27A2DDA8"/>
necessarily engaged the attention of the assembly, and greatly tended to impress their minds and reach their hearts. He had an inward vital sense of religion, that animated his discourses with the same divine passions he felt in himself.</P>
<P>He discharged the other parts of his sacred trust with prudence and fidelity, diligence and impartiality, warn∣ing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, not only publicly but from house to house, that he might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>Having obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, he did not run in vain nor labour in vain. There is reason to believe, that no small number, now among the spirits of just men made perfect, are blessing and praising God for him, as the instrument of that happiness they now enjoy; and that there are many yet living, who are the seals of his ministry, and will be his crown and joy in the day of the Lord. His whole deportment was a proof of the truth of religion. It is hard to say what virtues were most eminent in him, he sat such a shining example of all. He always seemed to have a sense of God upon his mind, and earnestly press'd after a nearer con∣formity to his Divine Master. He kept at a great dist∣ance from that useless and trifling Manner of conver∣sing, which visibly disgraces the character of too many Christans. He scarce ever enter'd into company but something serious and good dropt from his lips. His very presence banished every thing of levity, and solem∣nized the minds of all who were with him—and yet there was such a mixture of decent chearfulness that every one was fond of his Society.</P>
<P>Prayer was the delight of his soul. He was frequent in his retired devotions, and was ever ready to join with others in this sacred exercise. He seemed to breathe his native air when he drew near to the throne of grace— and was not willing to engage in any affair of importance, without having first made his religious acknowledgments to the God of heaven. His public prayers were serious, pertinent and pathetic—and he prayed always with all prayer almost in a literal sense, as his mind was always heaven ward, and there was something in his attitude and
<PB N="38" REF="011206_0036_0F862C4EEB2ACFD0"/>
appearance that led us to think he was continually sending up pious ejaculations; and yet his religion was so easy, so natural, and so graceful, that none ever charged him with affectation, or imagined that he aimed at the praise of men. His prayers were accompanied with alms—He constantly devoted a tenth part of his income to pious and charitable uses.—He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness endureth forever.</P>
<P>His heart was exceeding tender, and he sacredly ad∣heared to the dictates of conscience—scrupulously afraid in all his transactions of doing wrong, no arguments or persuasions could prevail with him to act at all, until he was satisfied he should act right. A solidity and exact∣ness of judgment, even in cases of great difficulty; and a distinguishing prudence both in public and private life, made him justly esteemed one of the wisest men of his day. His natural caution, improved by religion unto holy watchfulness, render'd him to the last degree careful not to give any just occasion of offence; but when the cause of God required it, he was zealous, resolved and coura∣gious. He bore a faithful testimony against prevailing errors and fashionable vices, how great soever the character of those who patronized them. "No pretence could make him transgress his own line, and from the duties of his post nothing could move him. His spirit was truly pacifie, and could sacrifice every thing but duty for peace; and accounted nothing too dear but truth and holiness, for the purchase of it".</P>
<P>He had a great veneration for our excellent Fathers, and could not calmly hear them reproached or vilified. He thought their magnanimity in encountering so many dan∣gers for the sake of preserving the rights of conscience, and their wisdom and piety in laying such happy foun∣dations, both civil and religious, ought to cover any lit∣tle mistakes they might have fallen into. He was greatly alarmed with every motion to introduce the Hierarchy into these Colonies, whose predecessors had, at the peril of every earthly comfort, fled from the face of ecclesiasti∣cal tyranny. Nor was he less jealous of the attempts made to deprive us of our civil liberties. Though he warmly press'd submission to the powers that be, while
<PB N="39" REF="011206_0037_0F862C4FB5D8CE28"/>
they are the ministers of God for good to their subjects, yet he was greatly affected with the encroachments lately made upon us, and could not think a people were to be blamed for adhering to their rights and privileges, that had been purchased at so dear a rate. These things lay with weight on his mind as long as he lived, he spake with freedom, and some degree of warmth, on this inte∣resting topic, and often addressed heaven to interpose for our relief. His prayers, we trust, have been heard and will be graciously answered.</P>
<P>With such an assemblage of virtues, and such an uni∣form course of life, it is no wonder Dr. SEWALL lived in the highest reputation; venerated by all, loved and e∣steemed by the wise and good; he received the highest honors which were consistent with his station of life.— On the decease of the Hon. and Rev. President LEVER∣ETT, in the year 1724, he was chosen to preside over Harvard-College, but his Church not consenting to resign him at the call of the public, he respectfully declined the honorable trust to which he had been invited. In 1728, on the resignation of Dr. COLMAN, he was elected a Fel∣low of the Corporation, and faithfully attended the duties of that station until 1765, when his age and infirmities obliged him to resign. He had a great and sincere con∣cern for the interest of religion and learning in that So∣ciety, and expressed his regard by many important services. A few years since he made a generous donation to the College in money, the income to be for the help of indi∣gent scholars. When Harvard Hall was consumed by fire, he was one of the first to repair the loss, by a present of many chosen and valuable Authors out of his own library.</P>
<P>In the year 1731, he was created Doctor of Divinity, by the University of Glasgow —He was appointed one of their Commissioners by the Honourable Corporation in London for the propagation of the Gospel in New-Eng∣land and parts adjacent; and once and again a correspon∣dent member by the Society in Scotland for promoting Christian Knowledge. Indeed, there was no public in∣stitution suted to his station and character, in which the undertakers did not think it an honor to have Dr. SEW∣ALL an associate; none calculated to promote the interest
<PB N="40" REF="011206_0038_0F862C506D1AEBB8"/>
of Christ's kingdom, in which he did not willingly en∣gage; and when engaged, he punctually attended their respective meetings; being as willing to do the duty, as to have the honor, of a public trust.</P>
<P>The Lord of life was pleased to continue his useful∣ness to a good old age; the evening after he had com∣pleated his 80th year, he preached to a serious and affect∣ed audience, when he took a humble and thankful notice of the sparing mercy of God to him. The Lord's day following he was seized with a paralytic disorder, which soon put an end to his public labors, and confined him to his house. But though incapable of public service, he was still employed in his Master's business. As he was visited by great numbers, desirous of hearing the last words of the ascending Prophet, so he was incessant in his counsels, directions and prayers. Here you might see the humble gracious saint. Others were ready to applaud the rectitude and uniformity of his life, his diligence and fidelity in his Lord's work. He, on the other hand, ex∣press'd his sense of his own defects, acknowledged himself an unprofitable servant, bewailed the remains of sin, and looked to the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ for pardon and acceptance. In his long and tedious sickness, he was a pattern of patience and submission, as in his health he had been an example of holy living. He encountered the apprehensions of death, like one who believed and hoped for immortality. He enjoy'd to the last a steady peace and serenity of mind, and spake of unseen and eter∣nal things with a sensible gust and relish, as if his soul had been upon the wing, and he had some foretaste of the joy, which we have almost a sure and certain hope he now possesses.—</P>
<P>His Remains were this day attended to the Grave with every mark of respect due to so excellent a Person.—</P>
