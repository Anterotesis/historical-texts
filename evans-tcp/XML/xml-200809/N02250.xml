<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>T<HI>HE following</HI> Sermon <HI>met with no lit∣tle Approbation from the judicious Auditory, to which it was deliver'd: And I hope will be as acceptable, from the Press, as from the Pulpit; and more extensively profitable. To which end I wish a Divine</HI> Blessing <HI>may accompany it into the World! It appears abroad, at the Request of</HI> Many. <HI>'Twas preach'd at my desire, and in my Desk, I mean, where I was to have stood. For which Reason, the Reverend</HI> Author <HI>demands of me this in Return, That I usher it upon the Stage with some</HI> Prefatory <HI>Lines: And it seems but a just piece of</HI> Gratitude <HI>in me to comply; however they that know</HI> his Age <HI>and</HI> Worth, <HI>may vote it a Trespass on Modesty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I'm sensible 'twould be an unbecoming Attempt in me, to enter here into an</HI> Encomium <HI>on the Author and his Performance, as is the manner of those that do the like office of Respect for Others: Nor cou'd any Character from me illustrate his Personal Merits, or be of any Advantage to his Discourse; which will commend</HI> it self <HI>to every serious judicious Reader. I shall therefore only beg Leave to express</HI> my Thanks, <HI>to</HI> Him, <HI>for affording me his so seasonable and kind Assistence: And to the Divine</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>who led him to bring us such a Sermon, so calculated for general use; as to the</HI> Subject, <HI>of common con∣cern; and as to the</HI> Manner, <HI>Scriptural, rational, and pertinent; perspicuous, and moving.—I must be allow'd also to express my Joy in the</HI> signal use <HI>God is making of this his Servant, to spread</HI> Re∣ligion <HI>among the Aboriginal Natives, or</HI> Indians; <HI>to which Service he has for these many years devoted himself▪</HI> We are bound to thank God always on
<PB N="ii" REF="002677_0003_0FE6070BF0B1F528"/>
their behalf, for the Grace of God which is given them by Jesus Christ. <HI>Hereby</HI> of a truth we per∣ceive that God is no Respecter of Persons. But all in all nations <HI>stand on one common Level before God, both in the Duty and the Privilege of Sanctifica∣tion:</HI> Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, Bar∣barian, Scythian, Bond nor Free.—<HI>It must yield a very sensible Pleasure to every Christian Soul, to hear of the</HI> Grace <HI>of God bestow'd on the</HI> Indians, <HI>those (once) forlorn and wretched Heathen, the very</HI> Ruins <HI>of humane Nature! It is a refreshing</HI> Testi∣mony, <HI>that this Servant of God bears unto</HI> IT, <HI>in the ensuing Sermon: And we hope it will be abundantly confirm'd in that</HI> Narrative <HI>of the Lives and Deaths of some scores of our Christianized</HI> Indians, <HI>which he designs ere long to give the Public.—In the mean time, they who want Satisfaction, are refer'd to the accounts that have already seen the Light. For the State of Religi∣on among them, as it was</HI> formerly <HI>you have it in the Life of Memorable Mr.</HI> ELIOT, <HI>the Apostle of the American Indians. And for later times, you may see the account given by the Rev. Messieurs</HI> Rawson <HI>and</HI> Danforth; <HI>annexed to Mr.</HI> Noyes's <HI>Election Sermon. Also the appendix to Dr.</HI> Mather's <HI>Funeral Sermon for Mr.</HI> Rawson, <HI>and others, entitl'd</HI> Just Commemorations. <HI>Also our Author Mr.</HI> Mayhew's <HI>appendix to his Sermon</HI> on Isa. 1. 18. <HI>published in the year 1720. Consult these Prints, and you'l find that one of</HI> our Forefathers <HI>pious Errands into this Wil∣derness, has not been altogether neglected, nor un∣succeeded. The Lord revive his work both among</HI> English <HI>and</HI> Indians! AMEN!</P>

<HEAD>Mankind, by Nature, Equally under Sin.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ROMANS, III. 9.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>What then? are we better then they! No in no wise: for we have before proved both</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Gentiles, <HI>that they are all under Sin.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE <HI>Pride,</HI> which Mankind have by Nature in their Hearts, does very much dispose them to think too highly of them∣selves, and too meanly of o∣thers. It is a case wherein People comparing themselves with others, are not equal Jud∣ges; but are too apt to pass Sentence in their own Favour.</P>
<P>IT would doubtless be well, if we were herein more Cautious than we are, considering how sub∣ject to be mistaken we be, and what inconvenien∣ces do or may attend our being so. Hence that caution given by our Apostle, <HI>Rom. 12. 3. For I say through the Grace given unto me, to every Man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly
<PB N="2" REF="002677_0005_0FE6070E19E7CE30"/>
than he ought to think; but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every Man the measure of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>IT is therefore very Necessary that People Labour after <HI>Humility,</HI> and take care that their Hearts be not lifted up with Pride and Vain-glory, but that they be kept in a humble frame con∣tinually. And we ought at all times to <HI>Meditate</HI> on such things as have a Tendency to <HI>hide Pride</HI> from us, and cause us to see that we have nothing to boast of; Nothing on the account whereof we have any reason to exalt our selves.</P>
<P>AND here one thing, the consideration whereof may be very Serviceable to us is, <HI>That we are no better by Nature, than</HI> those of our Neighbours are, whom we Prefer our selves before; for tho' it will not from hence follow, that we have not <HI>now</HI> the Advantage of them; yet we may hence infer, that if we are any better then they, we may not thank our selves for it, <HI>not having made our selves to differ from them,</HI> and <HI>having nothing which we have not Received.</HI></P>
<P>THE Proposition from whence this Conclusion is drawn, is very evidently contained in the words now before us, as will appear when we have con∣sidered their Connection with those in the con∣text, and the true sense and meaning of them.</P>
<P>HERE then we may briefly observe, that the Apostle having in the Beginning of this <HI>Third</HI> Chapter of his Epistle, <HI>ver.</HI> 1, 2. Declared, what great Advantages the <HI>Jews</HI> above others did in∣joy, and Vindicated the kindness of God therein Manifested unto them; as also His Justice in Pu∣nishing their Disobedience, in what follows unto the end of the <HI>Eighth verse,</HI> He in my <HI>Text,</HI> Answer∣eth
<PB N="3" REF="002677_0006_0FE5F205EB803330"/>
a Question, which he proposeth on this Oc∣casion, and this, as I Suppose, that he might pre∣vent the <HI>Jews,</HI> from drawing such a Consequence from what he had been saying, as was neither in∣tended, nor implied therein; Namely, that they were better than other People, unto whom God had not granted such Privileges as he had done unto them. <HI>What then?</HI> saith he, <HI>i. e.</HI> What con∣sequence may their be drawn from what I have said? <HI>Are we better than they? i e.</HI> Are we <HI>Jews,</HI> who are so highly privileg'd, as I have declared, any better than others, who enjoy not such Advantages as we do, and whose Wicked Lives expose them to God's just Displeasure? Does it follow that because we have better Privileges, we must needs be a better People! <HI>No, in no wise. i. e.</HI> Such a Consequence will by no means follow from what I have delivered: I intend no such thing, nor can such a Conclusion be fairly drawn from what I have said. And that such a Conclu∣sion is neither true, nor according to his mind, he further manifests in what follows unto the end of the <HI>verse. For we have,</HI> saith he, <HI>before Proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under Sin. i. e.</HI> If both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are such Sinners as I have before proved they are, or charged them with being, in my foregoing Discourse about them, it is neither true, nor can you suppose me to intend, that we who are <HI>Jews,</HI> are any better than the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> but on the contrary, we are all equally Sinfull.</P>
<P>NOT that the Apostle here intends, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were Generally as bad in their Lives as the <HI>Gentile</HI> Nations were; and that all People and
<PB N="4" REF="002677_0007_0FE6071650803E40"/>
Nations are actually alike Wicked; for as bad as the <HI>Jews</HI> were, they were not Universally so bad as the Nations that <HI>knew not GOD,</HI> and did not call upon his Name. And <HI>we know</HI> well, that all Mankind are not equally Wicked; for there are some Righteous Persons, who are <HI>more Excellent than their Neighbours,</HI> Prov. 12. 26. and there are some Nations, whom <HI>Righteousness</HI> doth exalt, while <HI>Sin</HI> is a Reproach unto others.—</P>
<P>BUT what the Apostle here intends, is that <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and all Mankind are, <HI>by Nature,</HI> equally under Sin. They are <HI>so</HI> considered as in their <HI>Natural Estate;</HI> tho' otherwise, Grace may have made some difference betwixt them.</P>
<P>THE Words then will afford us this <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<Q>DOCT. THAT, Mankind are all by Nature Equally under Sin; none better than others.</Q>
<P>FOR the Clearing up of this Truth, there are three things to be Considered; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> (1) What is here intended and implyed in Mens being <HI>under Sin.</HI> (2) What is me'nt by Mens being <HI>by Nature E∣qually</HI> so. (3) How it appears that this is the Condition of <HI>all Mankind.</HI></P>
<P>I. LET us Consider what is intended and im∣plyed in Mens being <HI>under Sin.</HI></P>
<P>NOW this implies Several things, As,</P>
<P N="1">1. MENS <HI>committing Sin,</HI> or being Guilty of it. By their being <HI>Guilty,</HI> I here intend their being <HI>Sinners,</HI> or that Relation, which those that have Sinned, do stand in unto the Sins that have been Commit∣ted by them, on the Account whereof they are said to be <HI>theirs,</HI> and by which the charge of Sin∣ing
<PB N="5" REF="002677_0008_0FE607197B12DD20"/>
is justly fastened on them. Mens being thus <HI>under Sin</HI> does imply that they have Sinned, either by <HI>omitting</HI> something which they should have done, or <HI>doing</HI> somthing which they should not. Without this, Persons cannot be truly said to be <HI>under Sin.</HI> In this sense Persons may be said to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> or <HI>Guilty</HI> of it, whether the De∣served Punishment of their Offences be inflicted on them or not. Thus those unto whom the Lord does <HI>not impute Sin,</HI> may be said to be un∣der it, when they have done that which they should not. Again.</P>
<P N="2">2. MEN are said to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> as it <HI>dwells</HI> or abides in them, after they have Committed it. Those Actions wherein Men Sin against God, are transient and pass away as soon as they are done; as <HI>Adam</HI> did not continue Eat∣ing the Forbidden Fruit; but having so done, his Act therein was gone and past: But Mens Actions being thus finished, <HI>Sin</HI> remains in the Persons performing them. There is <HI>after them</HI> a vicious <HI>Habit</HI> or <HI>Inclination</HI> left in the Souls of the Persons Sinning, which is in it self truly and properly Sin; being the want of a Conformity unto the Holy Law of God, in Mens Minds or Hearts, and so a Transgression of it.</P>
<P>WHEN Sin is committed, the Soul is as it were Poisoned with it, so as to Remain disposed to Vice and Wickedness, being depraved and Sinful. So it was with <HI>Adam,</HI> when he had Sinned against God; and all his <HI>Posterity</HI> have been Natu∣rally full of Sin <HI>ever since;</HI> as will by and by more fully appear. Hence that in Rom. 7. 20. <HI>Sin that dwelleth in me.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="6" REF="002677_0009_0FE5F206B01F4278"/>
3. PERSONS may be also said to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> on the account of that <HI>Stain</HI> and <HI>Blot</HI> which it leaves on the Persons committing it, I mean the <HI>shame</HI> and <HI>reproach</HI> which it brings upon them. For tho' this be properly rather an <HI>Effect</HI> of Sin than Sin it self; yet the effects of Sin, or Punish∣ment of it, being sometimes in Scripture called Sin, Persons may not unfitly be said to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> when under them. Hence it is said of a Per∣son committing Sin, <HI>Prov. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 33. A wound and dishonour shall he get, and his reproch shall not be wiped away.</HI> Agreeable hereunto is that in Prov. 14. 34. <HI>Sin is a Reproach unto any People.</HI> Such as bear the Reproach, which Sin has brought up∣on them, may on that account be said to be <HI>under Sin;</HI> and this seems evidently included in <HI>that Ex∣pression,</HI> as used in the Text.</P>
<P N="4">4. MENS being <HI>under Sin</HI> evidently intends their being under the <HI>Guilt</HI> of it. By Guilt here I intend that <HI>Obligation</HI> unto <HI>Punishment,</HI> under which Men are brought, when they Sin against God, by the Sentence denounced in that Holy Law of His, which is trangressed by them; and <HI>not</HI> the <HI>Relation</HI> only, in which they stand unto the Sins which they have Committed; of which be∣fore. And Guilt is very frequently taken in the Sense, in which I here understand it. So in our Con∣text, verse the 19<HI>th. Now we know that what things soever the Law saith, it saith to them who are under the Law: that every Mouth may be stopped, and all the World may become Guilty before God.</HI> Or▪ as it is in the Margin, Subject to the Judgment of God. In this Sense, the word <HI>Guilt</HI> is to be understood, <HI>Psal. 51. 14. Deliver me from bloud-guiltiness, O
<PB N="7" REF="002677_0010_0FE6071C5860AD48"/>
God.</HI> In this Sense, Persons <HI>Iniquity</HI> is said to be <HI>upon them,</HI> when they are bound over to Punish∣ment for it.</P>
<P N="5">5. MEN are said to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> on the ac∣count of the <HI>Reigning Power</HI> of it in and over them. This is something more than Simply their having Sin <HI>in them,</HI> of which I have before spoken, for thus God's own <HI>Children</HI> may be the Subjects of Sin, but Sin does not <HI>Reign</HI> in them, it has no <HI>Do∣minion</HI> over them, nor are they the <HI>Servants</HI> of it, as the Apostle shews, <HI>Rom.</HI> Chap 6. But on the Contrary, such as are in a State of <HI>Nature,</HI> are un∣der the Reigning Power and Dominion of Sin. <HI>Sin reigns in their mortal bodies,</HI> and they do <HI>obey</HI> it in the Lusts thereof, having their Conversation in the Lusts of the Flesh, and fulfilling the desires of the Flesh, and of the Mind, being Foolish and Disobedient, and serving divers Lusts &amp; Pleasures, as is declared in <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 3. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 3. <HI>For we our selves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, de∣ceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</HI> Of Persons who are in this Sense under Sin, that is to be understood <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 20. <HI>When ye were the Servants of Sin, ye were free from Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>We may consider,</P>
<P>II. WHAT is here intended by Mens being <HI>Equally</HI> under Sin (none better then others) <HI>by Nature.</HI> Now that this does not intend that all Mankind are equally bad in their <HI>Lives,</HI> has been already declared. And when it is said that Men are <HI>by Nature</HI> alike it seems plainly implyed, that <HI>by Grace</HI> they are or may be far otherwise.</P>
<P>AND very true it is that since Life and Immor∣tality
<PB N="8" REF="002677_0011_0FE6069D4283C4B0"/>
have been brought to Light by the Gospel, God has put a very great Difference betwixt one and another of the Children of the first <HI>Adam,</HI> making some of them much better than others. Nor has He only made a difference betwixt those that are <HI>Born again,</HI> and such as are not, but also betwixt one and another of these; for as all the <HI>Godly</HI> are not equally <HI>Holy,</HI> so neither are all un∣regenerate Persons suffered to run into the <HI>same excess of Riot,</HI> or equally and alike to give up themselves unto a Course of Sinning against God; but many of them are by common Grace restrain∣ed from Committing Sin, with such Greediness as others do; and also inabled to do many things that are Materially Good, and Beneficial both un∣to themselves and others; tho' not such as are said to <HI>accompany Salvation.</HI> Heb. 6. 9.</P>
<P>IT is readily granted, that there is such a Dif∣ference betwixt the Children of Men as that now declared; but then it must be affirmed that <HI>Grace</HI> and not <HI>Nature</HI> has made it. By <HI>Nature</HI> they are all alike, in Respect of their Moral Estate or con∣dition, none either better or worse than others: Nor do I by <HI>Nature</HI> here understand that of Man, in the <HI>State wherein he was Created,</HI> but the Na∣ture of Man considered as in that <HI>Estate</HI> which his <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> brought him into, and as a Subject of those Sinful <HI>Inclinations</HI> which by his Apostacy from God he has Contracted, and of which he Remains a Miserable Subject till the Grace of God makes some change in him, or work some good Effects on him.</P>
<P>I may now Proceed to Consider,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002677_0012_0FE6069E62951E70"/>
III. <HI>HOW it appears</HI> that this is the Conditi∣on of <HI>all Mankind.</HI> Or, that by Nature all Man∣kind are equally under Sin; none better than others.</P>
<P>AND this will be evident, if we seriously weigh a few things now to be proposed unto Considera∣tion. Here then I say,</P>
<P>I. <HI>THAT the Sin and Fall of the first</HI> Adam <HI>involved</HI> all <HI>Mankind in it.</HI> There was no diffe∣rence made here; one as well as another of <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity Sinned in him, and fell with him in his first Transgression. <HI>Eve</HI> sinned Personally as <HI>Adam</HI> did, and was also a <HI>Partaker</HI> with him in <HI>His</HI> Sin, as Accessary to it, by enticeing him to commit it and so at least equally Guilty with him.</P>
<P>BUT all <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity, being in him, as Branches in the Root, or Stock, out of which they proceed, or as Fruit is first in the Tree that bears it, before it is brought forth, they most certainly Sinned in him when he sinned. They may on this account be as well said to have done what <HI>he</HI> did when he eat the forbidden fruit, as the Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> are said to have paid tithes in <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> Heb. 7. 9. But if their being <HI>Naturally</HI> in him, in the manner now expressed, did not <HI>Ne∣cessarily</HI> intitle them to the Guilt and Defilement of his <HI>Sin</HI> (as I do not affirm that it did) <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that rendered it most <HI>just</HI> and equal that he should be made a <HI>Publick Person,</HI> and moral <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them, in whom (as such) they should <HI>be</HI> and do and so stand or fall as he should do. Nor could their being thus <HI>in,</HI> and <HI>represented</HI> by him, be any disadvantage unto them; for <HI>as</HI> they acted
<PB N="10" REF="002677_0013_0FE606A5DC4749D0"/>
<HI>in him,</HI> so they would have acted <HI>out of him.</HI> Their <HI>Nature</HI> being the very <HI>same</HI> with his, they would have done just as he did, if put upon the <HI>same trial</HI> as he was; and therefore could receive no <HI>wrong</HI> by his representing of them, and acting for them as their Publick Head. It was al∣together as well for them in this way, as it could have been if they had Personally acted for them∣selves, and made their own choice.</P>
<P>NAY, it seems that they were in <HI>less</HI> danger of a Miscarriage in the <HI>way</HI> fixed on, than they would have been in the <HI>other:</HI> for <HI>Adam</HI> had a far <HI>greater charge</HI> lying on him, than any Person in a single capacity could have had: it is certain that <HI>his own</HI> happiness was as much concerned in the affair as any Persons could have been, who might have been left to a Personal Trial in a case where∣in their eternal safety did depend upon their do∣ing as they ought. And besides this, the welfare or Happiness of all his <HI>Posterity</HI> depended on his o∣bedience unto God, in the Instance wherein he was tryed; which we cannot suppose him to have been Ignorant of; for it is not <HI>reasonable</HI> to think that he could be such a <HI>Publick Person,</HI> and yet not be acquainted with it.</P>
<P>NOW the consideration of this laid a moral obligation on him, to take great heed what he did, and not at once to destroy all his Posterity, together with himself.</P>
<P>THAT the first <HI>Adam</HI> did as a Publick Person thus represent, and act for all those who in the way of ordinary Generation do proceed from him, and that they fell with him in his first Trans∣gression, the Scriptures do abundantly testifie.
<PB N="11" REF="002677_0014_0FE606A6EA6A5278"/>
The <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> fully asserts and clears up <HI>this</HI> in the <HI>fifth</HI> chapter of his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Romans.</HI> In the 12 <HI>verse,</HI> he tells us, That <HI>by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death passed on all Men, for that all have sinned</HI> in him. And in the following context, he declares that <HI>through the offence of one, many are dead;</HI> and that <HI>Judgment was by one, unto condemnation.</HI> And he further tells that <HI>by one Man's offence, death reigned by one.</HI> (verse 15, 16, 17.) That <HI>Adam</HI> was the <HI>one Man</HI> here spoken of, is declared in <HI>verse</HI> the 14<HI>th.</HI> where we are also told that he <HI>was the figure</HI> of him that <HI>was to come,</HI> even JESUS CHRIST, who is the head and representative of his Seed, as the <HI>first Adam</HI> was of his. The A∣postle accordingly tells us, that as in one of <HI>these</HI> many were made <HI>Sinners;</HI> so in the <HI>other</HI> also many are made <HI>Righteous,</HI> in verse the 18, 19, and 21: Agreeable unto this is that also of the same <HI>Apostle</HI> in 1 Cor. 15, 21, 22. <HI>As by man came Death, so by man came the Resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</HI></P>
<P>II. AS all Mankind fell in and with <HI>Adam,</HI> so they were <HI>all Equally</HI> involved in the Guilt and Defilement of his Sin. As they <HI>all fell</HI> in him, so they all fell <HI>Equally</HI> in him. This must needs be granted; for all <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity were <HI>equally related</HI> to him both as their <HI>natural and ap∣pointed head.</HI> the covenant of works was <HI>one and the same,</HI> to which they <HI>all</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consented, and according to their <HI>obedience</HI> or <HI>disobedience</HI> unto which they were either to <HI>live</HI> or <HI>die;</HI> and they were all <HI>Equally</HI> capable of the Reward promised,
<PB N="12" REF="002677_0015_0FE606A7FB195560"/>
and of the Punishment threatned in that covenant, and so of all the <HI>Effects</HI> or consequents of <HI>Adams</HI> obedience or disobedience unto God, of what na∣ture or kind soever they were. And hence they were all <HI>equally</HI> involved in Sin and Misery.</P>
<P>Here I may more particularly affirm.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT all the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> did by the fall partake <HI>equally</HI> in the Guilt of his Sin. I mean now that <HI>his Sin</HI> was equally <HI>imputed</HI> unto or charged on all of them. Whatever Interest <HI>any</HI> of them had in it, they <HI>all</HI> had. They being all in one condition, all Shipped on one and the same bottom, having all one and the same <HI>Surety,</HI> or Publick Person to represent them, and all fall∣ing by one <HI>Offence</HI> of the same Man, at the very same time, and under the very same circumstan∣ces; How can it be but that they must be <HI>equally Guilty?</HI> The Sin committed must needs equally belong to them all. There is no room to suppose that there could be any difference as to this, nor is there the least intimation in Scripture, that there was any: but the contrary is therein fully declared, as shall be presently made manifest.</P>
<P>And from hence it follows,</P>
<P>2<HI>ly.</HI> THAT all Mankind are by Nature <HI>equally</HI> liable unto the Judgments, threatned in case of disobedience. If <HI>all</HI> had the charge of Sin <HI>Equally</HI> lying on them, were equally chargeable with such Crimes as do expose Men unto punish∣ment, then all must needs be equally liable to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Punishments due on the account of them.</P>
<P>THE Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> did accordingly expose all that were Guilty of it unto Death. Gen. 2. 17.
<PB N="13" REF="002677_0016_0FE606A90E19D530"/>
<HI>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.</HI> And Death is agreeably hereunto said to have <HI>reigned from</HI> Adam <HI>unto</HI> Moses, <HI>even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of</HI> Adams <HI>Transgression, i. e.</HI> not actually in their own Per∣sons as he did, Rom. 5. 13. Hence we are assured that even God's own People <HI>were by nature Children of wrath even as others,</HI> Eph. 2. 3.</P>
<P>I go on and say,</P>
<P>3<HI>ly.</HI> THAT Mankind are <HI>all equally</HI> Defiled <HI>by original sin.</HI> Or that the Depravation of the Na∣ture of Man by the fall, has equally affected all the Children of <HI>Adam;</HI> the Holy child Jesus only excepted. The rest of <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity are equal∣ly infected with it. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1) IF we consider the Depravation of the Humane Nature, which followed on the fall of Man, as a <HI>Penal</HI> Effect of his first and great Trans∣gression, this was certainly a Punishment <HI>equally due</HI> unto all his offspring.</P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, but that the moral distempers of Mens Souls, unto which they have ever since the fall been subject, are a just <HI>Punish∣ment</HI> of Man's Sin in <HI>Eating the Forbidden Fruit.</HI> They are included in the <HI>Death</HI> threatned, when God said unto Man, that <HI>in the day he eat thereof, he should surely die:</HI> The Children of <HI>Adam</HI> have therefore been <HI>dead in sin,</HI> ever since <HI>his</HI> Sin and fall: And that Children are disposed unto Sin from their very Infancy, <HI>going astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies,</HI> as in Psal 58. 3. is an invincible argument of their being Guilty of Ori∣ginal Sin; their own actual Sin, not going before, but following after, this Propensity in their Na∣ture to Sin against God.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="002677_0017_0FE606B182314B68"/>
BUT now all the Posterity of the <HI>first Adam,</HI> be∣ing <HI>equally</HI> Guilty of that Sin, which they com∣mitted in him, as has been shewed, it plainly follows that so far as the corruption of Man's Nature is to be looked upon as a punishment of that Sin, it was equally due unto all those, who <HI>equally</HI> Partook in the Guilt of <HI>Adams</HI> first <HI>Offence.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">(2) IF we consider the corruption of Mans Nature, as <HI>Naturally</HI> Propagated (in the way of <HI>ordinary generation</HI>) from Parents unto Children, all the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> must needs in this way partake equally of it. The depravation of our Nature as a natural result, or effect of our Apos∣tasy from God, must needs equally affect all those who were in and with <HI>Adam,</HI> plunged into the same mire and dirt of Sin into which he fell. Those who were alike dipt in the same corrupt Fountain, must needs be equally defiled by it.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Original Sin</HI> is <HI>naturally</HI> propagated from Parents unto their Children, is a truth whereof we have no reason to doubt. When <HI>Adam</HI> did eat of the forbidden fruit, he took a dose of <HI>Poison,</HI> if I may so speak: Not that I assert that the <HI>Fruit</HI> of which he partook was properly and naturally so; but the <HI>Sin</HI> which he then commit∣ed was poison unto his <HI>Soul,</HI> and did most wofully infect it, producing many grievous Distempers in it: Yea his very Body was also affected with it. The Poison which he thus took, did immediatly infect his whole <HI>Spirit, Soul and Body:</HI> So that his nature was presently most grievously depraved, his understanding darkned, his heart hardned, his affections disordered, and all the members of his Body became the ready Instruments of unrigh∣teousness:
<PB N="15" REF="002677_0018_0FE606B43974ADE0"/>
And all his Posterity partook equally of the Diseases which he thus contracted: For he being infected and defiled, they could not be clean, but as proceeding from him were <HI>altogether Filthy:</HI> For the Distempers by Man thus contract∣ed became <HI>hereditary,</HI> and were necessarily propa∣gated to his off spring. His Children were ac∣cordingly begotten in his own Sinful Likeness. <HI>Cain</HI> was evidently so, and <HI>Abel</HI> was a <HI>Sinner,</HI> and needed a <HI>Sacrifice.</HI> And of <HI>Seth</HI> it is expresly said, that <HI>Adam begat him in his own likeness, after his Image;</HI> and this, after he had lost <HI>God's Image,</HI> wherein he was created, <HI>Gen.</HI> 5. 3.</P>
<P>NOR where they only <HI>Adam's</HI> immediate Chil∣dren, who were thus infected, but the Distemper has kept spreading in the world, thro' all the Generations of the Sons and Daughters of <HI>Adam,</HI> no one of them being free from it. Hence that in Job 14. 4. <HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</HI> And Chap. 25 4. <HI>How can he be clean that is born of a woman?</HI> There is not therefore a Man, Woman or Child upon the Earth, but what may truly say with <HI>David,</HI> in Psal. 51. 5. <HI>Behold I was shapen in Iniquity; and in Sin did my mother conceive me.</HI></P>
<P>AS the Sin is the same, by which all Mankind are defiled; so the <HI>way</HI> of its conveyance to them all, is but one. It passeth to them in one and the same Channel of natural Generation: And so e∣qually infects all unto whom it does descend, even all that come into the World in that way.</P>
<P>III. AS Mankind do appear, from what has been already said, to be equally under Sin; so <HI>God in his word speaks of all men, as</HI> equally Sinful
<PB N="16" REF="002677_0019_0FE606B5D864B870"/>
by nature. The <HI>Apostle</HI> having in our <HI>Text</HI> in∣formed us, that none of Mankind are by nature any better than others, but all equally under Sin; does in the following context (from <HI>verse</HI> the 10<HI>th.</HI> to the 18<HI>th.</HI>) prove the Truth of what he saies; <HI>As it is written,</HI> (saith he,) <HI>There is none Right∣eous, no not one: There is none that under standeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unpro∣fitable, there is none that doeth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asp, is under their lips: Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitter∣ness. Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes.</HI> These words the <HI>Apostle</HI> quotes out of the <HI>Psalms, Proverbs</HI> and <HI>Isaiah,</HI> to prove that all Men are by nature <HI>equally</HI> Sinful, and so <HI>very</HI> Sinful as is expressed in them: and then adds in verse the 19<HI>th. Now what things soever the Law saith, it saith unto them, who are under the Law: that every mouth may be stopt, and all the world may become Guilty before God.</HI> The same truth is con∣firmed by many other <HI>Testimonies</HI> of <HI>Scripture.</HI> As <HI>Gen.</HI> 6. 5. <HI>And God said that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</HI> Jer. 17. 9. <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?</HI> Psal. 58. 3, 4, 5. <HI>The wicked are estranged from the womb, they goe astray, as soon as they are born speaking lies. Their Poison is like the Poison of a Serpent, they are like the deaf Adder that stoppeth her ear, which will
<PB N="17" REF="002677_0020_0FE606B6E74D0130"/>
not hearken to the voice of Charmers, charming never so wisely.</HI></P>
<P>THESE and many other such like Texts of Scripture must needs be understood as spoken of Mankind consider'd as in their <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>uncon∣verted</HI> estate, and as left unto themselves, (for unto any others the description given will not agree) and consequently what is unto this effect said of them, will hold respecting <HI>all</HI> such as they are.</P>
<P>BUT thus much for the Doctrinal Handling of the Point.</P>
<P>THE APPLICATION or <HI>Improvement</HI> of the Truth insisted on, shall be briefly offered in a few Inferences. And,</P>
<P>USE, 1. IF, as we have now heard, none of Mankind are, by Nature, any better than others, but all equally under Sin; we may from hence very naturally infer, That they are all <HI>exceeding wicked,</HI> and their <HI>condition very miserable.</HI> If we consider what the very <HI>worst</HI> of Men on Earth <HI>actually</HI> be, we may in them see what all Men, and so even the best, <HI>by nature</HI> are. When we see or hear of any Persons that are extreamly wicked, we are apt to cry out against them as very <HI>Ministers</HI> of Impiety, and such as are hated of God, and justly to be abhorred of Men; (and indeed so they are) but do we duly consider, that <HI>we our selves,</HI> and even the <HI>best</HI> Men in the world, are as had by <HI>nature</HI> as <HI>they.</HI> Our <HI>hearts</HI> are by nature as <HI>des∣perately wicked</HI> as theirs; and we should have run into the <HI>same excesses</HI> in our Lives, as they have done, had not the Grace of God restrained us from
<PB N="18" REF="002677_0021_0FE6071D670FB5C8"/>
it. If we see, hear or read of, Covetous Persons, Liars, Thieves, Adulteres, Murderers, or Blasphe∣mers of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and thereupon ask this question, <HI>Are we better then they?</HI> The answer must be, <HI>No, in no wise;</HI> for it plainly appears, that we are all by nature, equally <HI>under Sin.</HI> If one of the black∣est Catalogues of Sinners that could possibly be thought of (suppose that <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 21,—32.) were set before us, we must own that we are by nature altogether as bad <HI>as they:</HI> Nay, we are naturally as bad as the very <HI>Devils</HI> are: Even worse than we are able to Imagin. (<HI>Jer.</HI> 17. 9.) And our <HI>Misery,</HI> while we are in our natural Estate, is proportionable to our Wickedness. While unconverted, we are in estate of <HI>condemnation,</HI> and the <HI>wrath of God abideth on us.</HI> We are, by nature <HI>children of wrath even as others;</HI> are under God's wrath and curse, and so liable to all the Miseries of this Life, to death it self, and the pains of Hell for ever. We may see how this our forlorn and wretched Estate by Nature is set forth in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 2,—4.</P>
<P>USE 2. WE may from the Truth before us in∣fer, <HI>That Sinners cannot be Justified, and saved by any</HI> Legal <HI>Righteousness of their own,</HI> but must be made Righteous, by the Righteousness of another, even <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the Righteous, if ever they obtain Life Eternal. This conclusion the <HI>Apostle</HI> himself has already drawn to our hands from the Proposi∣tion, which we have had under our consideration. His inference from it we have in our context, (<HI>v.</HI> 20, to the 28.) which I chuse to express in his own words. <HI>Therefore</HI> (saith he,) <HI>by the deeds of the Law, there shall no flesh be justified in God's
<PB N="19" REF="002677_0022_0FE607272EB6C550"/>
sight: for by the Law is the knowlege of Sin. But now the righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Pro∣phets. Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference: For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through saith in his blood, to de∣clare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare I say, his righteousness: that he might be just, and the Justifier of him that believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>THE sum of the matter is, that Mankind be∣ing fallen into such a Sinful and Miserable Estate, as their Apostacy from God has brought them in∣to, they can never be justified by any Righteous∣ness of their own, nor by any other than that of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> provided by God, and revealed in the Gospel. And this truth is also confirmed by o∣ther places of Scripture, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 2, to 8, and 11. 6. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 11. 12. and <HI>phil.</HI> 3. 9.</P>
<P>IT is evident from <HI>Scripture,</HI> (1.) That unto Man's Justification before God, it is required, That he have a <HI>Perfect Righteousness;</HI> such a Righteousness as the perfect Law of God requi∣reth: And consequently that such as wou'd be Justified by a Righteousness of their own perfor∣ming, must perfectly fulfill the <HI>whole</HI> Law, with∣out
<PB N="20" REF="002677_0023_0FE606BC36E1E570"/>
out being guilty of any failure. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 10, 12. (2.) That Mankind having once <HI>broken</HI> God's holy Law, they can never in their <HI>own Persons</HI> fulfill it; for however exact they might be sup∣posed to be in their obedience, after their Repen∣tance yet they must needs still remain Sinners, in respect of their <HI>past offences:</HI> And therefore such a Righteousness cannot Justifie them in God's sight, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 10, 11. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 20. (3.) That therefore the <HI>only</HI> Righteousness, by which Sin∣ners may be Justified, is that wrought out by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and revealed in the Gospel. As the Apostle plainly and fully shews, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 21, to the 26. and <HI>chap.</HI> 5. 18, 19. And hence it followeth (4) That that <HI>Faith,</HI> by which we are said to be Justified, (whatever it may be supposed to compre∣hend or include in it) cannot be our <HI>justifying Righteousness;</HI> nor is it's being so, intended, when it is said to be <HI>accounted for righteousness unto such as have it,</HI> Rom. 4, 5.</P>
<P>FOR it is certain, <HI>that faith,</HI> by which we are said to be justified, is in Scripture plainly distin∣guished from <HI>that Righteousness,</HI> which is received by it, and said to be <HI>unto</HI> and <HI>upon</HI> them that be∣lieve; and which is said to be <HI>without works</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> works of Men's own doing) <HI>imputed to them,</HI> Rom 3. 22. and 4. 5. 6.</P>
<P>USE 3. WE may from the <HI>Doctrine</HI> justly infer, That if there be <HI>now any difference</HI> betwixt one and another of the sinful race of Mankind, <HI>So∣veraign Divine Grace has made it,</HI> and <HI>not they themselves.</HI> It is not denied, but that there is now a great difference betwixt people, in respect of their Qualifications and Actions: and it is well if
<PB N="21" REF="002677_0024_0FE6072A86B4B878"/>
the difference that is betwixt them, be duly ob∣served and acknowledged. There are some <HI>Righteous Persons</HI> that are <HI>more excellent than their Neighbours;</HI> Those <HI>Saints</HI> in the Earth, and Excel∣lent ones, in whom all our <HI>delight</HI> should be. (<HI>Psal.</HI> 16. 3.) There should certainly be a <HI>respect</HI> shown unto such, proportionable to the virtue and good∣ness appearing in them. It is said concerning a <HI>Godly Man,</HI> That <HI>in his eyes a vile person is contem∣ned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>BUT now from <HI>whence ariseth</HI> this difference, which we see betwixt one Person, or People, and another? If some are <HI>now</HI> better than others, is it owing to <HI>themselves,</HI> that they are so? No surely, this cannot be: For <HI>being by nature no better</HI> than others, they can by nature <HI>do</HI> no better than o∣thers do. If Persons Hearts be just alike, their Tempers or Inclinations the very same, and have none of them any means and helps from <HI>without them,</HI> more than the other have, they will <HI>still</HI> be and act both alike. But if <HI>some</HI> of those, who are alike by nature, do become better than others, we may conclude that some Influence upon them from <HI>without,</HI> has made that odds: and this can be ascribed unto no other cause than the Soveraign and Distinguishing Grace of the Blessed God. Hence that in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 7. <HI>What maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive?</HI> And that in <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 16. So then it is not of <HI>him that willeth,</HI> nor of <HI>him that runneth,</HI> but <HI>of God</HI> that sheweth <HI>Mercy.</HI> If then there be any that are better than others, <HI>that</HI> God has made them so, who hath told us, <HI>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and will have compassion on
<PB N="22" REF="002677_0025_0FE6072C19F86830"/>
whom he will have compassion:</HI> And it becomes us to say as in <HI>Matt.</HI> 11. 26. <HI>Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in thy sight.</HI></P>
<P>USE 4. WE may learn from the Truth insisted on, <HI>That Humility and Self Abasement does very well become all the Children of the first Adam:</HI> and that even the <HI>best</HI> had need to take heed of Spiritual <HI>Pride,</HI> and be careful lest in comparing themselves with others, they be puffed up with Vain-Glory, while they reckon themselves better than they.</P>
<P>IT is certain that Mankind have generally a great <HI>propensity</HI> this way. Such as enjoy extra∣ordinary <HI>advantages,</HI> are apt to value themselves too highly on the account of them, and to think that they have good <HI>qualifications</HI> answerable to the Privileges, with which they are favoured; when perhaps it is far otherwise. And then be∣ing puffed up in their own mind, they are apt to <HI>contemn</HI> and disdain <HI>others,</HI> as tho' they were <HI>vile,</HI> compared with <HI>them.</HI> This was too much the temper and guise of the <HI>Jews,</HI> while they were lifted up to Heaven in Privileges. They reckoned themselves a most <HI>holy</HI> People, and Esteemed o∣thers as <HI>unclean.</HI> In our <HI>Saviour's</HI> time and after it, they seemed to think they had gotten the <HI>Monopo∣ly</HI> of Religion, so that others had scarce any the least Share of it. Nay, they could scarce endure that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> should have the <HI>means</HI> of Salva∣tion offered unto them. It is certain that such a temper as this is very offensive unto God: He observed it with displeasure in some of his own visible People of Old, who said unto others. <HI>Stand by thy self, come not near me; for I am holier than thou.</HI> (<HI>Isa.</HI> 6<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.) And of such he there saies,
<PB N="23" REF="002677_0026_0FE606BF13E97150"/>
<HI>These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.</HI> There be some that live very Vicious Lives, and by their Sins expose themselves unto God's Judgments; But <HI>what then,</HI> saies the Apostle, <HI>are we,</HI> who are now reformed, <HI>any better than they? i.e.</HI> are we by nature so? <HI>No, in no wise: We are all</HI> equally <HI>under Sin.</HI> Those who would keep Spiritual Pride out of their Hearts, should seriously <HI>consider this:</HI> and not forget, that if they do now at all <HI>differ</HI> from those with whom they compare themselves, it is GOD that has made them so to do. Such thoughts have a natural tendency to keep Men humble and low in their own Eyes; which it's our duty and interest to be. We should <HI>not be High minded but fear,</HI> (Rom. 11. 20.) and take heed that we do not <HI>think ourselves something, when we are nothing, deceiving our own Souls.</HI> (Gal. 6 3.) But if we are indeed in any respect become better than others, let us not be proud of it, but say unto GOD, as in (<HI>Psal.</HI> 115. 1.) <HI>Not unto us</HI> O <HI>Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory.</HI> And we should take the caution given us in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 7. partly before recited, <HI>what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if thou didst receive it, why doest thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?</HI></P>
<P>USE 5. WE may from the Doctrine discoursed on, draw this conclusion, <HI>That the Sinfulness of any People ought not to be looked upon, as a sufficient ground of discouragment unto the People of God, from setting upon, and diligently prosecuting proper me∣thods, for their Conversion and Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>CHRISTIANS should consider, That being themselves by nature as bad as the worst, if this
<PB N="24" REF="002677_0027_0FE606C024B19DA0"/>
had been sufficient to discourage others from at∣tempting their Conversion, they might have per∣haps still remained such as by nature they were, and not have been made such as through the Grace of God, they are now become. But we bless God, we have not been thus dealt withal.</P>
<P>WHY then should we be discouraged from en∣deavouring the Salvation of others; tho' they at present appear to us to be as bad, as all Men by nature are, according to the account in the Word of God given of them.</P>
<P>MANY such have been Converted and Saved. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 1. <HI>Such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.</HI> The Sovereign Grace of an Omnipotent God can cure the Blindness, and overcome the obstinacy of any People, and make them willing in the day of his Power. If he has done this for us, why should we be discouraged from using the proper means with others; that so we may see what free and rich Grace will in this way do for them? And tho' we should not presently discern such good effects of our Endeavours as we desire, we should not presently give over our Essays to save our perishing Neighbours from Eternal ruin.</P>
<P>HERE I cannot but think it proper to make a more <HI>particular Application</HI> of what I am saying under this Head unto the case of a miserable People dwelling among us, and bordering upon us: I mean the Aboriginal <HI>Natives</HI> of this Land.</P>
<P>THE Preaching of the <HI>Gospel</HI> unto many of these, and the Success which it has had among
<PB N="25" REF="002677_0028_0FE6072F235F05F0"/>
them, has been formerly looked upon as none of the least of the <HI>Glories</HI> of this Country, and GOD Himself has been Glorified on the account of it.</P>
<P>NOW, tho' this work was formerly carried on with much of Life and Vigour, yet it must be confes∣sed that there seems not of Later Years such a Spirit among us to promote the good of the Indians: But on the Contrary, the work now goes on <HI>heavily,</HI> and many seem to labour under discouragements with respect to it; yea some will speak as if there was scarce <HI>any good</HI> to be hoped for concern∣ing the People here intended.</P>
<P>BUT why should we be so discouraged about them! They are no worse <HI>by nature</HI> than others, or than we our selves. They are as <HI>capable Sub∣jects</HI> of good impressions, as the People of any o∣ther Nation; And when it pleaseth God to bless means for their good, there are the <HI>same effects</HI> produced thereby, as the same means do produce on others.</P>
<P>I do not deny but that the number of such as are <HI>vicious</HI> among them is very great; but then I should not give God the Glory of his <HI>Grace</HI> ma∣nifested in, and towards many of them, if I did not on this occasion say, That there are (to the Eye of Christian Charity,) a <HI>considerable number</HI> of <HI>Godly</HI> People among them, And I do now de∣clare, that I do not doubt but that there have been <HI>many hundreds</HI> (if I may not say some thou∣sands) of them saved, since the first Preaching of the Gospel to them in this Land. There is scarce a Year passeth, wherein there are not some, more or less, who as far as can be Judged, <HI>die</HI> in the Lord. I am confident it is so with those, with whom I am concerned; and I hope many are Saved in other Places also.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002677_0029_0FE606C1B27DC418"/>
I bear witness for God, that I do not perceive but that he as readily concurreth, by the operati∣ons of his Spirit, with the means used for the good of the <HI>Indians,</HI> as with those enjoyed by any other People. Tho' it be true, that as he delights to work by means, so the more <HI>sutable</HI> the means are, the more grounds we have to expect his blessing to accompany them.</P>
<P>IN a word, I think we have no reason to be dis∣couraged from prosecuting with utmost diligence, the good design of Propagating the Gospel among the <HI>Natives</HI> of this Land: And I take this oppor∣tunity (which is a more <HI>Public</HI> one than I could justly have expected,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Being a the Audience of the <HI>General Court.</HI></NOTE>) to intreat all such as are in any capacity for it, to endeavour a <HI>revival</HI> of this work, and a removal of the things that do impede the successful carrying of it on; yea and diligently to consider what further way and means may be used for the most successful management of it.</P>
<P>THE Honourable COMMISSIONERS for the Propagation of the Gospel among the <HI>Indians,</HI> will doubtless think themselves very deeply con∣cerned herein. And I here crave leave humbly, and with the greatest Submission to say, That I believe this to be an Affair worthy of the serious consideration of the <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>General COURT, or Assembly</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> and I am perswaded that some things might yet be done by the <HI>Government</HI> here, which would have a very favourable aspect on this work.</P>

I conclude this head, with asking the <HI>Prayers</HI> of my Hearers, That the Blessing of God may accompany all the means that are used for the good of the <HI>Indians;</HI> and that <HI>He</HI> would please to direct all those that are more immediately con∣cerned with and for them, unto such measures as may be most conducive to that end. I have frequently heard our Christian <HI>Indians</HI> praying fervently for the <HI>English</HI> Churches and Ministers here, and else where: And I hope we shall not neglect to pray for them also. Let us intreat the Lord on their behalf, that his Spirit may be poured upon them from on high whereby of a <HI>Wil∣derness</HI> they may be made a <HI>Fruitful Field;</HI> and that they may yet be a People formed for him to shew forth his praise, and that he would please to say concerning them, that he will <HI>set his Sanctu∣ary in the midst of them,</HI>—and that his <HI>Taber∣nacle shall be with them,</HI> yea that he will be <HI>their God,</HI> and that they shall be <HI>his People!</HI></P>
<P>USE 6 <HI>and last.</HI> IF Mankind be all in such a Sinful and Miserable Estate, as has been declared, <HI>should we not all of us be greatly concerned, that we may not fail of getting out of it!</HI> It is a most dread∣ful thing to be <HI>under Sin,</HI> under the Guilt and reigning power of it. We have all of us reason to cry out, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 24. <HI>O wretched men that we are! Who shall deliver us from the body of this Death.</HI> And we should give our selves no rest, till we have attained unto some comfortable assurance, that we are delivered from the Guilt and Dominion of Sin, and are able to rejoyce as <HI>not being under the Law but under Grace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="002677_0031_0FE6073B27309F90"/>
WE should look upon <HI>Sin,</HI> unto which we are naturally subject, as the <HI>worst</HI> of all <HI>Evils;</HI> that <HI>abominable thing which God hateth;</HI> and the pro∣curing cause of all the penal or afflictive evils that do or can befall us: And we should bless God for sending his SON, the Lord from Heaven, to redeem us from our Sins; and bless <HI>Him</HI> for <HI>un∣dertaking</HI> the admirable work of our Redemption. We should also be very thankful that the way of Salvation by a Redeemer is <HI>revealed</HI> unto us in the Gospel, and should all of us be deeply concerned, that we <HI>receive not the Grace of God in vain.</HI> As all Mankind are by nature equally under Sin, so they should be all equally concerned to get deli∣verance from it. This is a concern which none may think themselves <HI>too high for;</HI> and which the <HI>meanest</HI> persons are invited to attend.</P>
<P>LET us then every one of us look to our selves, <HI>giving all diligence to make our calling and election sure.</HI> Let us be <HI>sensible</HI> in how bad an estate we by nature are: And let us abhor our selves for all our Sins, and repent in dust and ashes. And let us prize Jesus Christ, who saveth his People from their Sins, and let us repair unto him for Salva∣tion: Flying for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope set before us.</P>
<P>I Conclude with that good and comfortable word, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 56, 57. <HI>The sting of Death is Sin, and the strength of Sin is the Law: but thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
