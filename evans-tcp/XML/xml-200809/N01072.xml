<Q><BIBL><HI>I. Kings VIII. 57, 58.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his Com∣mandments, and his Statutes, and his Judg∣ments, which he Commanded our Fathers.</P></Q>

<P>THESE Words now read in your Christian Audience, [<HI>Much Ho∣noured, Reverend, and Beloved,</HI>] are a part of that Royal Blessing wherewith King <HI>Solomon</HI> blessed the Congregation of <HI>Israel,</HI> after an Elaborate
<PB N="2" REF="001279_0004_0FB204269D0C4780"/>
and Affectionate Prayer for them, at the Solemn Dedication of the Temple, which he had build and finished for Gods Honour and Worship: Supplicating the Divine Presence and Favour as the Fountain of all blessings, with the Sig∣nal Manifestation thereof in some special Acts of Grace and Mercy: that the God of their Fa∣thers would own them, and be with them still; not leave or forsake them: and that He would manifest this, not only by giving them outward Prosperity, but blessing them with Spiritual Bles∣sings. Particularly, that as he had given them his Word and Statutes to teach and direct them in the way that they should walk; so he would by his Holy Spirit Effectually incline and en∣gage their hearts to Keep and Obey them.</P>
<P>It is justly to be esteemed the Highest Honour and Happiness of a People, to have the <HI>Lord JEHOVAH</HI> for their God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 144.15. <HI>David</HI> pronounces the <HI>People happy that were in such a case,</HI> as is before described, when their Sons [which be the Strength, Safety and Hopes of a Nation] are as Flourishing <HI>Plants grown up in their Youth:</HI> Their Daughters [on whom the Hope of Poste∣rity depends] <HI>as Corner-Stones polisht after the si∣militude of a Palace;</HI> Strong and Beautiful, A∣dorned with all the Ornaments proper to their Sex: <HI>When their Garners are full, affording all man∣ner of Stones, their Sheep bringing forth Thousands and ten Thousands, their Oxen strong to Labour, no break∣ing
<PB N="3" REF="001279_0005_0FB2042AA3CE8100"/>
in of the Enemy,</HI> nor going out against them, nor with them into Captivity, no Complaining in their Streets, no Out-Cry or Howling for a∣ny sad Tidings, Publick grievances or Calamities. Happy is the People enjoying such Plenty and Peace, saith the Psalmist: Yet immediately there∣upon, not in way of Comparison herewith, but Correction of himself, He cryes out, <HI>Yea Happy is the People whose God is the LORD.</HI> The former was a very Desirable Estate in it self, but com∣paratively it is nothing. The true and chief Happiness of <HI>Israel</HI> does not consist in these things, which are common to others with us, but in this Peculiar Priviledge, That the true &amp; Blessed God is our God by Covenant, and spe∣cial Relation.</P>
<P><HI>Nextly,</HI> In having his Laws, Statutes and Judg∣ments for the Rule of our Life and Walk, with an Heart inclined to <HI>Observe</HI> and <HI>Keep</HI> them. This also was <HI>Israels</HI> peculiar Priviledge at first, To have the Revelation of Gods Mind and Will in his Word, <HI>Psal.</HI> 147.19, 20. With which Argu∣ments <HI>Moses</HI> the Servant of the Lord, by whom the Law was first given, urges the People to O∣bedience, <HI>Deut.</HI> 4.6, 7, 8. Hereupon the People generally Promise Obedience; <HI>All that the Lord our God shall speak unto us by thee, We will hear &amp; do it.</HI> Which Protestation of theirs God himself takes notice of and accepts as to the Matter of it: commanding them for it so far, Saying to <HI>Moses,
<PB N="4" REF="001279_0006_0FB2042D0F9303C8"/>
I have heard the Voice of the Words of this People, which they have spoken unto thee, and they have well said all that they have spoken.</HI> But then, (after the manner of men) expresses an holy jealousy or suspicion of the Truth and Sincerity of their Profession, <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.28, 29. <HI>Oh that there were such an Heart in them, thus to Fear me always, and Keep all my Commandments,</HI> &amp;c. It was questionable as to Man, tho' not as to God, whether there were such a Principle of Obedience in them as was like to be lasting, or without which they would surely fail as to the performance.</P>
<P>The Thing it self was greatly to be wished by them, and for them, from the great Advantages that would accrue unto them and their Posteri∣ty therefrom: But who shall give them such an Heart? (as the Hebrew Words may be rendred) Who but God himself can confer this Grace and Blessing on any People? If these Words were spoken by <HI>Moses</HI> (as some think) they are his Option or Prayer to God for Israel: that as he had newly delivered to them the great things of his Law, and they had engaged to Observe and Do all, their Hearts might be rightly framed to such an Obedience, as was required of them, and now promised by them. Who will give them such an Heart, or who will give their Heart to be such in them? Tis certain that God alone can do this; therefore it implies an Address to Him for it. Now from the same sence <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spirit
<PB N="5" REF="001279_0007_0FB2042E2C31D7C0"/>
it is, that <HI>Solomon</HI> makes this Request, or Pro∣nounces this Blessing in our Text. <HI>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers, let him not leave us, nor forsake us: That He may incline our Hearts unto Him, to keep his Commandments,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINAL Conclusion hence is this.</P>
<P><HI>That the most Desirable Blessing which can be asked or wished for, and pronounced upon any People under Heaven [as a Fruit and Evidence of the Divine Presence with, and Favour towards them] is, That the God of Heaven would incline their Hearts to Himself, to Walk in all his Ways, to Keep his Commandments, his Statutes and his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>Or more briefly thus,</P>
<P><HI>That the Choicest Mercy which any People have to desire for Themselves and Posterity, or that God has to bestow upon them in this Life, is to make them a Religious, and an Obedient People.</HI></P>
<P>This is the summ of <HI>Solomons</HI> comprehensive Blessing here, and it is indeed the comprehense of all Blessings. Thus blest was <HI>Israel</HI> in the pi∣ous Reign of his immediate Predecessor: The Heart of his Royal Father was fully inclined to the Lord, and to his Testimonies, <HI>Act.</HI> 13.22. concerning whom the Lord himself thus restify∣ed
<PB N="6" REF="001279_0008_0FB2141214040DD0"/>
and said; <HI>I have found</HI> David <HI>the Son of</HI> Jesse, <HI>a man after mine own heart, who shall fulfil all my will,</HI> [that is in Governing his People.] This was the chief Qualification which God respect∣ed in his Choice of him to be King over <HI>Israel,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.7. Looking, not as man, to the out∣ward Appearance, but judging by the Heart; Calling him from a mean Employment, to the highest Seat in the Government; <HI>from following the Ewes great with young, he brought him to feed</HI> Jacob <HI>his People, and</HI> Israel <HI>his Inheritance: So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulness of his Hands.</HI> This is the Testimonial which God has left upon Re∣cord for him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.72. Wherein are commen∣ded two necessary Qualifications of a good Prince or Chief Ruler in <HI>David. Integrity,</HI> whereby he sincerely sought the Good and Wel∣fare of his People, avoiding and abhorring those; Counsels and Courses which were contrary thereunto. <HI>Skilfulness,</HI> whereby he managed all Affairs of the Publick with singular Prudence: which is here ascribed to his Hands, not as if sea∣ted in them, but because acted and discovered by them, as appeared in all his Actions and Ad∣ministrations. It is sad with a People when their Chief Ruler wants either of these, <HI>Skilful∣ness</HI> or <HI>Faithfulness;</HI> and 'tis hard to say which of these can be worst spared. King <HI>David</HI> was eminently accomplished with both, and the
<PB N="7" REF="001279_0009_0FB214165FE75FA8"/>
People extraordinarily Happy under a Person of such a Spirit and Accomplishment. The Holy Spirit of God improving his Prudent Counsel, and Pious Example to be influential, as a means to make them in love with the ways of Holi∣ness, Obedience, and Instituted Religion.</P>
<P>Now this Devout Prince being about to De∣mise his Crown and Government, gave with it this solemn Charge to <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son, that he should <HI>Know and Serve the God of his Father, with a perfect heart and a willing mind,</HI> 1 Chron. 28.9 Keep close to his Laws &amp; Ordinances, assuring him of Gods Presence and Blessing, in case he did so: Otherwise, if he forsook God, that he might expect to be forsaken of him: to all which, <HI>Solomon</HI> says <HI>Amen;</HI> imploring the Di∣vine Help for himself and People, sues for a double Portion of <HI>Davids</HI> Spirit, Wisdom and Piety, with an Entailment of all Happiness to Posterity in the Causes of it: <HI>The Lord God of our Fathers be with us as he was with them, let him not leave us, nor forsake us, but incline our Hearts to Himself and Ways, that so it may go well with us, and with our Children for ever.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to a more distinct Consideration of what is contained in the Doctrine, I shall lay down these three Propositions.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="8" REF="001279_0010_0FB214181514C250"/>
<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That Gods Presence and Favour, or His Favourable Presence? is the supream Cause, Original, Author, Spring and Fountain of all Blessings</HI> (to a Person or People) <HI>Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal.</HI></P>
<P>There is a threefold Presence of God menti∣oned in the Scripture. As,</P>
<P N="1">I. God is Naturally and <HI>Essentially Present</HI> with all his Creatures. He is an Immense Be∣ing, and no Creature possibly could Act, Subsist or Be without him. Thus <HI>Paul</HI> argued in the Court of <HI>Athens,</HI> Act. 17.27, 28. <HI>God is not far from every one of us, for in him we live, move and have our being.</HI> He is near us all, he is with us all. Thus the Gentiles owned, and one of their Poets said, <HI>Jovis omnia plena.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God is <HI>Gloriously Present</HI> with the Inha∣bitants of the Third Heavens. The Heaven of Heavens has in it most marvellous manifestati∣ons of God. There the Blessed Ones have God so with them, as always to behold his Face: As Hell is set forth by a separation from the Pre∣sence of the Lord, <HI>&amp; from the Glory of his Power,</HI> 2 Thes. 1.9 So Heaven, <HI>by a Dwelling with him,</HI> 1 Thes. 4 17. For as there the Saints are ever with the Lord, so the Lord is with them for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. God is <HI>Graciously Present</HI> with his People
<PB N="9" REF="001279_0011_0FB2141994046B90"/>
here, by being favourable, kind and good unto them; <HI>Externally,</HI> in the ways of his Special Providence: <HI>Internally,</HI> by special Influences, Gifts, Motions and Operations of Grace. In∣deed, there is a common Providence of God, which Coextends it self as far as the Creation; whereby he Upholds the things which he has made, and Governs them all to their designed end: In respect whereof, God is equally pre∣sent with all persons and people, good &amp; bad. But this special Presence of God, he affords on∣ly to his Redeemed, Chosen and Called, who are not only under the Government of his Pro∣vidence, but the Dominion of Grace, and influ∣ence of the Spirit. This is that Gracious Pre∣sence of God which we ought to be solicitous for, and concerned to get and keep the abiding sence and tokens thereof.</P>
<P>It consists, (I say) <HI>First,</HI> In the Engagement of Divine Providence for our Welfare: Or, God is with us, when he is for us. To particu∣larize, Gods favourable Presence with any Peo∣ple, is manifest in these Effects.</P>
<P N="1">(I.) In giving them Conduct and Direction in the way that they should walk. Every man has a Way to walk in, either Private or Pub∣lick; In both which he needs a Counsellor and Guide, <HI>Jer.</HI> 10.23. <HI>The way of man is not in him∣self, neither is it in men that walketh, to direct his own steps.</HI> Thro' the darkness of the Way, and
<PB N="10" REF="001279_0012_0FB2141E10E5F550"/>
short-sightedness of the Understanding, man is ever in danger of being bewildered &amp; lost if left to himself. He cannot rightly enter upon, much less proceed and prosper in his way, that wants a true light. Now this light flows from the Presence of the Lord: as <HI>David</HI> acknowledges upon experience, <HI>Psal.</HI> 118.27. <HI>It is the Lord that sheweth me light.</HI> Hence <HI>Solomon</HI> gave this cau∣tion and counsel to man in general, <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.5, 6. <HI>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own understanding; in all thy ways acknow∣ledge him, and he will direct thy paths.</HI> Those that make their own bosome their Oracle, God is disengaged from being their Guide; they need him not: but the snares they run into will soon shew them how much they need him. Yea, not only our own reason, but the counsel and example of others will easily misguide us; whereas the more men depend on God, the more he will undertake to teach and lead them. This is especially necessary for a man in publick Place; more especially if he Sit as Chief in the Land, Country or Province, and be to Choose out the Peoples Way for them, as well as his own. From an high sence hereof, <HI>Moses</HI> the Servant of the Lord being called to take the Conduct of his People <HI>Israel,</HI> &amp; lead them from <HI>Egypt</HI> into <HI>Canaan,</HI> makes his Address to God for this instance of his Grace and Favour, <HI>Exod.</HI> 33.13. <HI>If I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now
<PB N="11" REF="001279_0013_0FB2141F3922C520"/>
thy Way: For wherein shall it be known that I and thy People have found grace in thy sight, Is it not in this, that thou goest with us?</HI> Gods Servants and People are often brought into a Wilderness of Difficulties and Emergencies; but if God him∣self be with them, he guides them to a good issue of them all. And thus his Gracious Pre∣sence appears in directing and inclining them to such a course of actions, and method of ma∣naging Affairs, as makes for his Honour, and their own Safety.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) In affording them Protection against all threatning Evils or Dangers. As he guides them with his Eye, so he guards them with his Arm. Such as have the Almighty Jehovah with them, need not fear who is or can be against them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.31. Gods Presence is a <HI>Defence</HI> to his Servants, and an <HI>Offence</HI> to their Enemies, <HI>Gen.</HI> 28.15. <HI>Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest,</HI> saith the Lord to <HI>Jacob;</HI> and so to <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 7.9. <HI>I was with thee, and have cut off all thine Enemies.</HI> The Secrecy of his Presence is the Saints Pavilion, <HI>Psal.</HI> 4, <HI>last.</HI> Herein they may lye down in peace, and rest securely, because the Keeper of <HI>Israel</HI> watch∣es over them day and night, that nothing hurt them. Yea if God be with them, <HI>they may pass through the Fire, and not be burned, through the Wa∣ter, and not be drowned,</HI> Isa. 43.2.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) In granting Assistance and success in
<PB N="12" REF="001279_0014_0FB214205663FAB8"/>
their Affairs. To prosper in our Way requires Strength as well as Light. Not only do our Understandings want illumination, but our Ex∣ecutive Powers help or assistance from God, to perform what is incumbent on their part: with∣out this the Wisest of men wont be able to ac∣complish what they undertake. But if God be present, he girdeth his Servants with Strength to perform their Work, so maketh their Way per∣fect. Yea do we not Read, <HI>That out of the Mouth of Babes &amp; Sucklings God has Ordained Strength and Praise,</HI> Psal. 8.2. That is, Has setled a firm Foun∣dation for his own Honour in Accomplishing great things by weak and foolish instruments. As in Spiritual Matters, or in Working out our Souls Salvation, We have an entire Dependance on Him, <HI>Who worketh in us both to Will and to Do of his good pleasure, Phil.</HI> 2.12, 13. So in all Secu∣lar Affairs, we depend on the same Power and Goodness. What thro' Weakness or Wilfulness, the impotence of Mans Mind, or Disorder of his Passions, and what thro' the difficult circum∣stances that attend his Affairs in this World of Mu∣tability, Nothing can be done to purpose, unless God be his Present Help. In a word, There is no part of the Work &amp; Business that Providence calls us to, either in our General or Particular Callings, but what is above, or beyond our single Strength: But if God be with us, his Grace shall be sufficient to carry thro' the most Arduous and
<PB N="13" REF="001279_0015_0FB21421D1F70F60"/>
Hazardous Enterprizes in the World, and that with good Success. The Almighty God thinks it enough to say to any Servant of his whom he calls to the most difficult Adventures, <HI>Certainly, I will be with thee.</HI> As when <HI>Moses</HI> was sent to De∣liver <HI>Israel</HI> from their <HI>Egyptian</HI> Servitude, <HI>Exod.</HI> 3.11, 12. <HI>Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the Children of Israel out of Egypt? And God said, Certainly, I will be with thee.</HI> The like was promised to <HI>Joshua,</HI> whom the Lord appointed to Succeed <HI>Moses</HI> as Captain General to lead the Host into <HI>Canaan, Josh.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Be strong and of a good Courage, for as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee, I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> All their Victories and Successes were owing to this Supreme Cause, <HI>viz.</HI> The Favourable Presence of God with them, As is acknowledged, <HI>Psal.</HI> 44.3. <HI>For they got not the Land into Possession by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm save them; but thy Right Hand and thine Arm, and the light of thy Countenance, because thou hadst a Favour unto them.</HI> True and Real Prosperity in every Undertaking, Business and Affair depends on this Presence and Favour of God. The Best Humane Policy and Industry will fail without it. Holy <HI>David</HI> retiring off the Stage of this World left this Blessing with his Advice to <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 Chron. 22.11. <HI>And now my Son, The Lord be with thee, and Prosper thou.</HI></P>
<P>These are some of the more ordinary Benefits
<PB N="14" REF="001279_0016_0FB2142734BFD090"/>
of Gods Providential Presence with a Person or People in way of Favour to them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There are yet more special Fruits of his Spiritual Presence in his Word and Ordinan∣ces, Making them Effectual means of Enlight∣ning, Converting, Sanctifying and Comforting the Souls of men. But not to insist on these here: I would only say, That all Spiritual Bles∣sings depend more absolutely upon, and flow more immediately from the Presence of the Lord. Having it helps men to Live Holily, and Know∣ing it to Dy Comfortably. If God be with us His Goodness shall lead us to Repentance, His Cor∣rection be for our Profit, in bringing us to partake of His Holiness: and All his Dispensations work Spiritual Good in us and for us, as a pledge of and Preparatory to that which is Eternal. Yea, His Rod and His Staff Comfort the Saints both Living &amp; Dying. Whom the <HI>Shepherd</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> takes the Care of, he not only shews to them the Path of Life, but will certainly bring them thro' Death to Life. <HI>He leads by Counsil, till he receives to Glory, Psal.</HI> 73.24. Making them full of Joy from his Countenance, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.28. Darting One Beam of light on their Way, Another of Joy on their Hearts, Both together rendring their walk thro' the darkest Valley of the Shadow of Death to be Safe, and Comfortable to them that have this Presence of God with them, and the sensible Apprehension, or Experimental Feelings
<PB N="15" REF="001279_0017_0FB21428A1B8B4A8"/>
thereof, as <HI>David</HI> had, <HI>Psal.</HI> 23.4. This is the Life of our Life, yea, 'tis Life in Death, and Life after Death, even Eternal Life. Moreover, The Presence of God makes Heaven: To have God with us is a Heaven upon Earth: and our Being with him is the Heaven of Heaven. To Dwell for ever with that Blessed God <HI>in whose Presence is Fulness of Joy, and at whose right hand are pleasures evermore,</HI> Psal. 16.11.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>It is a Signal Manifestation, or Token of the Abiding Presence of God with any People,</HI> [and gracious Answer of Prayer,] <HI>when He does incline their Hearts, and the Hearts of their Children to Himself, and to the Observance of his Laws.</HI> That is, in a Word, To be <HI>Religious,</HI></P>
<P>The Sum of all Religion Natural and Institu∣ted, may be lookt upon as Comprehended under these Expressions in our Text; and when the Heart of Man, (whereby the whole Soul is meant) Understanding, Will and Affections are so directed and inclined, as to make choice of God himself for their last End and chief Good, the Object of their Faith and Love, Reverence and Obedience; and his Word as the Rule of All, then may they be said to be <HI>Religious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="001279_0018_0FB2142C59FEB190"/>There are many Religions so called, as there are God's many, and Lord's many: but there being but One true God, there is and can be but One true Religion, which is his Revealed Will concerning our Service to him, and Communion with him. There is a Religion if there be a God, and but One Religion, if but One God, whose Will is Uniform. For our Help and Guidance herein, God has not only left us the Book of the Creature, wherein much of Himself and his Per∣fections may be read: But also has given us the Book of Scripture, inspired by his own Spirit, wherein is the Revelation of his Mind &amp; Will; teaching us more perfectly what he would have us to Know and Believe of him, and how we should live in Obedience to him. Here are the Decrees, the Statutes and Ordinances of the King of Heaven: Rules to guide us in our whole Course to our last End.</P>
<P>God has put a certain Law into the Creatures, which we call the Law of Nature, in the due ob∣servance of which they attain their End, &amp; glo∣rify God. As the <HI>Sun</HI> runs his Race like a Gy∣ant, yet keeps his Track to an hairs breadth. But to <HI>Man</HI> who is a Voluntary Agent, God gives his Commands by his Word, and expects a Volunta∣ry Obedience thereunto, as the Way to his own Honour, and our Good. Now our plenary and full Conformity or Subjection unto these in our whole Man, This is to be <HI>Religious,</HI> to be Godly,
<PB N="17" REF="001279_0019_0FB2142DD8276D08"/>
to live unto God: &amp; when it is so, God is with us of a Truth. This is a special Fruit and Evi∣dence of it. The Truth in this Proposition may be illustrated by a few Particulars. Briefly,</P>
<P N="1">I. That it was Necessary, for God to prescribe a Law unto us, Or, to give us his Command∣ments, his Statutes and his Judgments. Whether we are considered <HI>Apart,</HI> or with Respect to <HI>Community.</HI> Considered <HI>Apart,</HI> As a Creature, Man is subject to the Direction of Gods Provi∣dence; but as a Reasonable Creature, he is capa∣ble of Moral Government: This Law was at first Written on Man's Nature, and that was suf∣ficient while he stood in his Integrity to guide him, and enable him to Serve and Please God in all things propounded to him. The Law Writ∣ten on the Heart of Man was both his Principle and his Rule: but that being obliterated by the Fall, it becomes needful that God should give a New Law to guide Man to his own Blessedness, and to keep him from Erring. Especially if Con∣sidered in a <HI>Community.</HI> All Societies of men from the beginning of the World have found the Establishing of Laws the only Means to preserve themselves from Ruin; there is no other way to prevent Confusion: and would God leave that Society which is of his own Institution, and of which He is the Head, without Laws and Ordi∣nances?

of them, and give unto them such Statutes and Judgments, as may preserve his own Authority &amp; Interest among them, according to which he will reckon with them hereafter: <HI>Isa.</HI> 33.22. <HI>The Lord is our Law giver and our Judge.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In those Statutes and Commandments of the Law which God has given us, we have not only a Direction set before us, but an Obligation laid upon us. The Word of God is not only a Rule (for Information) but a Law (for Injun∣ction.) 'Tis not only the Result of God's Wis∣dom, but the Effect of his Legislative Will; He would not only instruct us in our Duty, but oblige us to perform it, by the One shewing the Equity, by the Other the Necessity of our Obe∣dience. He has not left us at liberty to comply with his Counsels; but has left the Charge of his Commandments upon us.</P>
<P>The Moral Obligation of the Law still lies on those that are taken under the Covenant of Grace. [There is an Eternal Obligation on the Creature to Love and Serve the Creator, which cannot be dissolved:] We are not Redeemed from the <HI>Service</HI> of the Law by Christ, but the <HI>Curse</HI> of the Law, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.74, 75. The End of our Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tion was not to destroy our Service accor∣ding to the Law; but to fit and inable us to per∣form it according to the Image of God renewed in us, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.24. And because our Law is broader, and takes in the Gospel too (which is the Law
<PB N="19" REF="001279_0021_0FB21434E9B640D0"/>
of Faith) We are bound to take care of all that God has given us in Charge, even all that is A∣dopted into our Rule of Faith &amp; Repentance, as well as Moral Duties. <HI>Again,</HI> The Statutes and Commandments of the Law are immutably, and indispensibly binding to All Men without Distin∣ction. No Man beggeth Exemption here, be∣cause of his Condition, High or Low, Rich or Poor, Prince or Peasant. God does not exempt any Creature from Duty to Him, but speaks im∣partially to All. <HI>Hear O Kings, Give ear O Princes, Potentates and Rulers of the World, as well as Subjects and mean People.</HI> Yea, the higher men's Station the greater their Obligation in many Respects. God's Law is a Royal Law, His Statutes and His Judgments so Noble and Excellent in themselves, that we need not be ashamed to speak of them before Kings, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.46. Or to Commend the Wayes of the Lord to the greatest Personages in the World. <HI>But yet,</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Hearts of All Men are naturally Un∣inclined to <HI>Obedience.</HI> Since the first man proved a Rebel against his Maker, All his Posterity (by ordinary Generation) are become Children of Disobedience: Are become naked and destitute of the Image of God, not only indisposed but a∣verse to that which is good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7. <HI>The carnal mind is Enmity against God, for it is not Subject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be:</HI> it cannot be∣cause it will not. Fallen man has neither Power
<PB N="20" REF="001279_0022_0FB2143615F5F6A8"/>
nor Will to Obey God. There is both Weakness and Wilfulness in Humane Nature, that it is not subject to the Divine Will: I mean not Created but Corrupted Nature, <HI>qua talis,</HI> as such it can∣not be reconciled to God, or perfectly subject to his Law. It may be as to the outward mate∣rial part, but not as to the Spiritual and true in∣tendment of it, till it be renewed. There must be a change of Nature to bring Sinful Man into a State of Reconciliation and Friendship with God, and to Walk in Ways of Obedience unto him, and his Commandments, not only because injoined, but inclined, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.3.</P>
<P N="4">4. This is God's Work: or tis He alone can change the Hearts of Men, turn them from their natural Bent and Byass to the World &amp; Sin, and incline them to Himself and his Ways, Remove the Aversion and Prejudice of the Old Corrupt Mind &amp; Will, Create new light and likeing in the Soul, new Principles, Dispositions, and Af∣fections. This is an Effect of Almighty Power and Soveraign Grace: of Enemies &amp; Rebels to make Willing Obedient Subjects to the Lord. Its called, <HI>A Day of his Glorious and Gracious Power, Psal.</HI> 110.3. When the Heart of Man does Surrender, <HI>and the Everlasting Doors are set open to the King of Glory,</HI> and All the Powers within offer themselves as Voluntiers, or Voluntarinesses in his Service.</P>
<P>This is not brought about by Moral perswasi∣ons meerly, much less by Coaction or Violence;
<PB N="21" REF="001279_0023_0FB21437923ECAA8"/>
but Efficacious Working of the Spirit of Grace, in a manner suitable to the Nature and Disposi∣tion of the Will, which is not destroyed, but per∣fected by Grace. <HI>Now,</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. This is a Signal Manifestation of the special Presence of God with any Person or People, when he does thus incline their Hearts unto Himself, and his Ways. Or, A general Disposi∣tion to an Obediential Walking with God in the way of his Commandments is a good Argument that God is and will be graciously Present with such a People, and walk in Ways of Mercy and Loving kindness towards them: or in a word, to Bless &amp; Prosper them. <HI>Conversion</HI> &amp; <HI>Reformation</HI> are Effects and so Real Evidences of the Divine Pre∣sence and Grace, (as the Cause is argued by the Effect:) Indeed <HI>Repentance</HI> &amp; <HI>New-Obedience</HI> are put into the Precept as Conditions of God's Fa∣vour and Blessing: and tis certain, that God will be with us, but as we are with him, and walk in his Ways. What more evident then this from the Promise and Threatning Conjunct, declared by a Prophet of the Lord before the chief Ruler and People together, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.2. <HI>Hear ye me</HI> Asa <HI>and all</HI> Judah <HI>and</HI> Benjamin, <HI>The Lord is with you while ye be with him, and if ye seek him he will be found of you,</HI> — Yet not as if our seeking God were first, or our walking in Ways of Obedience must necessarily precede as a procuring cause of his Blessing. Alas, so Foolish &amp; Wicked is Fallen
<PB N="22" REF="001279_0024_0FB21439D1D6FC70"/>
Man, that if God should not begin with him, he would never begin with God. Men are so Dead in Trespasses &amp; Sins they cannot, so habituated and inclined to Evil, that they will not return to God &amp; his Ways, till he is afore-hand with them. If therefore <HI>Religion</HI> be Propagated, or <HI>Reformation</HI> brought on in the World, or any part thereof lying in Wickedness, <HI>God is found of those that seek him not:</HI> our seeking him is a Fruit of his first seeking us: and when the Hearts of a People are set to Serve and Obey him by keeping his Command∣ments <HI>&amp;c.</HI> its an evidence that He both is and will be with them. When the Body of a People, especially a considerable Part of the Rising Ge∣neration in any Place, are disposed to be Obedi∣ent and Religious, its a manifest Token of Gods abiding Presence there. If a Peoples walking with God, Keeping close to his Word and Ordi∣nances, be a means to retain his Favourable Pre∣sence among them, then the inclining of their Childrens Hearts thereunto, is the most encou∣raging Token that he intends to take up his Abode in such a Place; It speaks well concerning them for a long time to come. <HI>That the God of their Fa∣thers will not leave or forsake them.</HI> On the other Hand, There is not a more Awful Token of Gods Departure from a Land, or leaving a People quite, then when their Children are Corrupt, and a Degenerate Offspring, that regard not their Fa∣thers God, nor have any Heart to his Covenant
<PB N="23" REF="001279_0025_0FB2143E518BD240"/>
and Ways. Pass we now to the Third Proposi∣tion which follows as an Inference from the two former. <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<P><HI>That the most Desirable Blessing which can be asked or wished for, and pronounced upon any People under Heaven (as a Fruit and Evidence of the Divine Presence with, and Favour towards them) is, that the God of Heaven would incline their Hearts, and the Hearts of their Children to Himself, to Walk in his Ways, to Keep his Commandments, his Statutes, and his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>As it is the clearest and surest Evidence of Gods Presence, so it is the choicest and best in∣stance of his Favour. Tis an eminent Fruit of Election, and actual Fulfilling of the Covenant of Grace: <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26. They that find the Law written in their Hearts, may conclude their Names are written in Heaven, and that they are some of Gods peculiar Favourites. Outward Prosperity is no sign of special Favour. Indeed, tis no certain sign at all that God is with a Peo∣ple in Way of Favour, meerly because he makes them Prosperous in Outward things, giveth them Power to get Wealth, and heap up Riches or Earthly Treasure in Abundance, Suffereth to live at Ease &amp; Enjoy temporal Felicity; There may
<PB N="24" REF="001279_0026_0FB2143F345385E8"/>
be a Woe belonging to them, and coming upon them for all this. But when he inclines them to be <HI>Religious,</HI> directs them in his ways, gives Power and Will to Obey him in all things. This argues not only a Providential, but Spiritual Presence of God with such a People. Tis an infallible Evi∣dence of his special love and good will towards them. For, As the inclination of the Heart is necessary to Obedience, so is Hearty Obedience unto Happiness, Temporal &amp; Eternal. Not only the Heart, but an inclined Heart is necessary to true and acceptable Obedience to God. The Heart must be framed and set Godward, or it will be impossible to yield a cheerful, uniform &amp; constant Obedience to him: But that being once well inclined twill influence and draw the whole Man after it; For the Heart is the Spring of mo∣tion that sets all the wheels a working: If God has that, he will have all. Thus the New Heart proves the greatest Blessing of the New Covenant, as a Fruit of Grace and Fountain of Obedience.</P>
<P><HI>Moreover,</HI> Thus to Obey God from the Heart, is the only way to please him, and what surer way to prosper in every thing, since that wholly depends on his good will and pleasure. The ob∣servance of Gods Laws, Counsels &amp; Commands as the Rules of our living, is undoubtedly the way to live well and fare well in this World and the next. Hence, All the Remaining Proof of the Doctrine, may be had from Consideration of the
<PB N="25" REF="001279_0027_0FB214409C804B90"/>
manifold great Advantages and Benefits of walk∣ing with God, in a Religious Observance of his holy Laws and Commands, with the manifold great Mischiefs &amp; Miseries of the contrary course considered as we go along.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> If we consider Man singly and in a Pri∣vate Capacity, The Religious Observance of Gods Laws and Commandments, conduces much to the Happiness of every One, even in this Life, &amp; that both as to the Inward and Outward Man: In the light and enlargment of their Understand∣ing, Peace of their Minds and Consciences, Bo∣dily Health, Honour, and Estate. The contrary tends as much to their Hurt in all these. How much it concerns Private Persons to be Religi∣ous and Obedient, The Wise Preacher has told us in a Word; when he says, <HI>Tis the whole of Man, Eccl.</HI> 12.13. This is as much a Truth now as it was then, that to fear God and keep his Com∣mandments is the All, the whole of Man; The whole of his Duty and the whole of his Felicity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Laws, Statutes and Judgments of God are wonderfully fitted for the benefit of Humane Society: And the observance of them every way necessary and advantagious to the Publick Happiness and Prosperity of Nations, as well as of private Persons.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Matter of these Commandments respects either Law or Gospel. That which is strictly
<PB N="26" REF="001279_0028_0FB21445D82BB6B0"/>
called the Moral Law or Decalogue is a fit Rule for a wise God to give, and a Rational Creature to receive: A just Admeasurement of our Duty to God and man. The World cannot be without it. To God, that we should love Him, serve Him, depend upon Him, and delight in Him, worshiping of Him at the Time, in the ways and manner appointed by Himself. To Man, <HI>Justice and Charity, or Mercy,</HI> Mic. 6.8. In the Gospel, we have likewise, this excellent A∣bridgment of our duty by the <HI>Apostle,</HI> Tit. 2.12. Which teaches, <HI>That denying Ungodliness &amp; World∣ly Lusts, we should live Soberly, Righteously and Godly in this present World.</HI> Now, both the moral and Evangelical Precepts of Gods Word are suited to promote the Publick interest of Nations as well as the Private interest of single Persons. This would most evidently appear by a Suppo∣sition of the contrary. Suppose a Reverse of all that God has commanded concerning the imbra∣cing of Virtue &amp; Shunning of Vice: if he should free men from those Laws which himself has most Solemnly Enacted, leave them to their own choice: or suppose Establish the contrary, For∣bid us all Respect to himself, Commanding us to Worship false Gods, Transform, and misrepresent his Glory by Images, Fall down before Stocks &amp; Stones, Blaspheme his Name continually, and Despise all those glorious Attributes which do so clearly shine forth in the Creation; If he had
<PB N="27" REF="001279_0029_0FB2144761417168"/>
Commanded us to be impious to our Parents, to fill the World with Murders, Adulteries, Robbe∣ries, to pursue others with Slanders and false Wit∣nesses, to court and take away what is another mans, Wife, Ox, or Ass, House or Land, Ser∣vant or Child, surely the Heart of Man cannot allow such a Conceit. Nay the fiercest Beasts would abhor it if capable of such an impression; If Lusts and Intemperance, Fraud, Rapine, and Violence were enjoyned or but Tolerated, what a World would it soon be? Humane Societies would presently fly in pieces, and all Mankind necessarily fall into a state of War and Confu∣sion; But now our Wise and Good God has taken care to prevent these mischievous evils to Men, by interdicting all manner of Sin and Vice on the severest Penalty, Establishing the con∣trary practice of Piety &amp; Virtue by a Law. Yea all things required herein, are at least, materially fitted for the good of Humane Societies.</P>
<P N="2">II. The actual Observance of these good Laws, Statutes &amp; Commands, is both necessary &amp; effectual to the Publick Welfare of Mankind. Tis not enough to have them and know them; but tis the doing of Gods will therein which makes blessed. Bles∣sed Nations or Societies of People, as well as Happy Souls of particular Persons. The Decrees and Ordinances of Heaven were made and Published for this end to be observed; not only
<PB N="28" REF="001279_0030_0FB214490B952238"/>
to be heard and contemplated but reduced unto Practice. And tis practical Obedience which makes way for the Blessing of Heaven to any persons or people upon Earth.</P>
<P N="1">I. This is Necessary. And that both <HI>Ex Ne∣cessitate Praecepti, &amp; Medji.</HI> (I) <HI>Praecepti,</HI> God has strictly charged the people whom he has favoured with his word, that they diligently ob∣serve and do all things which he has Command∣ed, and abstain from whatsoever he has forbid∣den, <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.1. (2) <HI>Medij,</HI> as a means to Hap∣piness. National as well as Personal, Prov. 14.34. <HI>Righteousness Exalteth a Nation: But sin is the Reproach of any People.</HI> Righteousness taken in the Latitude of it, for the whole of Religion (as sometimes in <HI>Scripture</HI> it is) comprehending all Divine Humane &amp; Social Virtues, has a natural tendency to promote Publick Happiness. On the contrary, Sin and Wickedness does in its own Nature produce many Publick mischiefs &amp; miseries. But this will be further shown under the other branch of the particular.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a certain Efficacy as well as Necessity of walking in ways of Obedience to Gods holy Laws &amp; Commands. These are propounded in form of a Covenant, to which promises and threatnings are annexed: That it shall go well or ill with a peo∣ple according as they Observe or Neglect these. It is a Doctrine not long since commended to us from this <HI>Desk</HI> on like Occasion. <HI>That such Peo∣ple
<PB N="29" REF="001279_0031_0FB2144B120845A0"/>
and Places as profess Christian Religion, may expect to be Happy or Miserable according as it goes with them as to Holiness and Righteousness.</HI> That is, As to the observance of the Duties be∣longing to the First or Second Table of Gods Law, or their Neglect of them. Thus it fared with the Nation and Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> whilst they were with God in the ways of Duty, God was wont to be with them in the ways of Mer∣cy, to bless and prosper them. But when they forsook God, and walkt contrary to him, his way was to forsake and walk contrary to them: when it was their Way to grieve him with their impieties and iniquities, it was his Way to vex them with Various adversities. This the Scrip∣ture declares to be the settled course of Gods Providence, that a Righteous Nation shall be happy, &amp; that a Wicked People shall be punish∣ed even in this Life. The experience of all Ages has made it good. All along the History of the Old Testament, we find the interchangeable Pro∣vidences of God towards the People of <HI>Israel</HI> al∣ways suited to their manners. <HI>which things hapned to them for ensamples, and are recorded for our instructi∣on on whom the Ends of the World are come,</HI> 1. Cor. 10.11. And tho' God in the Administrations of his justice be not tied up to Precedents, nor can we argue from Scripture examples that the Pro∣vidences of God towards other Nations, shall in all Circumstances be conformable to his dealings
<PB N="30" REF="001279_0032_0FB2144EEEECD528"/>
with the <HI>Jews:</HI> yet thus much may with great Probability be collected from them, that as He always blessed that People while they were obedi∣ent to him, &amp; followed them with Judgments when they rebelled against him, so he will also deal with other Nations, Because the reason of those Dispensations as to the main and substance of them seems to be Perpetual and founded in that which can never change. <HI>viz.</HI> The invariable justice of the Divine Providence. Indeed as to particular Persons, the Providences of God are Promiscuously administred in this World. So that no man can certainly conclude His love or hatred by any thing that befals him in this life. But God does not deal thus with Nations, because (as a late Learned <HI>PRIMATE</HI> of our Nation observes) <Q>Publick Bodies &amp; Communities of men as such can only be rewarded &amp; punished in this World; for in the Next, all those Societies &amp; combina∣tions wherein Men are now linkt together un∣der their several Governments shall be dissolved.</Q> God will not reward or Punish Nations then as Nations, but every Man shall give an Account of himself to God, and receive his own Reward, or bear his own Burden: But this being the only Season for National Rewards and Punishments, it seemeth Reasonable and necessary in some de∣gree, for a present Vindication of the Honour and Majesty of the Divine Laws, that a People should be prosperous or afflicted, according as
<PB N="31" REF="001279_0033_0FB21450891009B0"/>
their general Obedience or Disobedience there∣to appears.</P>
<P N="3">III. A Cordial respect; to God &amp; his Ways; that is, <HI>Godliness</HI> or true <HI>Religion</HI> in the Heart not only Obliges but Disposes all sorts of Persons to an actual Observance of all such things, as tend to the Publick Interest and Happiness of the Com∣munities which they belong unto, or to a Con∣scientious discharge of the Duties belonging to them in their several Places &amp; Relations. Where∣ever <HI>the Fear of God (which is the beginning of Wis∣dom,</HI> the Principle of all Religion) is truly Plan∣ted, that certainly lays the greatest Obligation on Conscience to all Civil Offices and Moral Duties: and likewise will have the greatest in∣fluence on the whole Behaviour of Men one to∣wards another, as well as towards GOD himself</P>
<P><HI>Particularly,</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Tis of great use in the Government of Hu∣mane Societies, by its influence both on Go∣vernours and Governed; Causing the One to Rule well, and the other to Obey for Conscience sake. This Distinction of Men is of Divine Or∣dination, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.1. <HI>The Powers that be are Ordained of God.</HI> The Testimonies of the Lord prescribe the Duty of both. (I.) Of Governours or Ru∣lers, 2 <HI>Sam. 23.3. He that Ruleth over men must be just, Ruling in the fear God,</HI> Where is a Word belonging to either Table, <HI>Fear</HI> of God in the first; and <HI>Justice</HI> in the second. The one influen∣tial
<PB N="32" REF="001279_0034_0FB21455D69858F8"/>
to the other. Hence <HI>Joseph</HI> assured his Bre∣thren, he should be just to them on this Argu∣ment, <HI>For I Fear God, Gen.</HI> 42.18. <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did not imbeazle or convert the Publick Treasures to his private use (as some other Governours had done before,) <HI>Neh.</HI> 5.15 <HI>But so did not I, because of the Fear of God.</HI> Yea this Principle setled in the Heart not only preserves from any Wicked∣ness against God, and Unrighteousness against Men; but promotes all acts of Love &amp; Charity towards Men, as well as Piety and Devotion to∣wards God. (2.) For the Governed. The Word of God interposeth express Rules for their Obedience, and true respect to God not only <HI>Obliges</HI> but <HI>Disposeth</HI> to observe them. And also to <HI>Submit to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords sake; whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Governours as those that are sent by him: For so is the Will of God,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.15. There are many Arguments why we should Reverence &amp; Obey Magistrates, but the Supreme reason is, <HI>The Will of God.</HI> The chief Ruler was then an Enemy to Religion when this Commandment was given forth, even then when that part of the World, in which the Church was Seated, was under the Command of <HI>Nero,</HI> whose universal Wickedness and particular cruelty against the Christians might provoke them to disobedience; yet then, God said, <HI>Obey</HI> and that not for <HI>Wrath,</HI> or fear of the Rulers Power only, which is but a loose
<PB N="33" REF="001279_0035_0FB21457141CC208"/>
Principle of Obedience, and will cease when e∣ver men can Rebel with safety and to advantage; But out of <HI>Conscience,</HI> which is a firm, constant &amp; lasting Principle, that will hold man fast, when all other obligations will break. A true Christi∣an is not to be tempted from his Obedience and Subjection by any Worldly considerations, be∣cause he believes, <HI>That whosoever resisteth Authori∣ty resisteth the Ordinance of God, and that they who resist shall receive to themselves Damnation,</HI> Rom. 13.2.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Religion</HI> or <HI>Godliness</HI> is the best Friend to Government, and when Governours &amp; Govern∣ed are Faithful in observing and discharging their respective Duties, it is a considerable Evi∣dence that God is with such a People in a Way of Favour: <HI>That they shall live long in the Land which he has given them, &amp; be prosperous,</HI> Exod. 20.12.</P>
<P N="2">2. It tends to promote the Publick Happiness and Welfare, as it obliges and disposes Men care∣fully &amp; conscienciously to observe all the Rules of Civil Conversation, Society and Commerce together. To keep Truth inviolably in all their Words, Promises, and Contracts; To be just &amp; honest in all their Dealings one with another; Peaceable &amp; Loving one towards another: A∣voiding all Strife &amp; Contention, Seeking to Ad∣vance each others interest as their own, and pre∣ferring the Publick to a Private. Were Men once inclined to live as Religion does require the whole World would soon become a quiet
<PB N="34" REF="001279_0036_0FB21458971BFC30"/>
Habitation, yea a most lovely and desirable place to what now it is. <HI>Solomon</HI> having a true Com∣prehension of the vast benefit of a Religious Dis∣position, Summed up all his Wishes for himself and People in this one: <HI>The Lord be with us, and incline our Hearts to Himself and His Ways.</HI> He knew full well, This was the surest way for him∣self to be Happy in the Government of such a People, whose Loyalty and Good Obedience to him was Secured by Principles of Conscience, &amp; for them to be Happy under the Reign of such a Prince, in whose Heart the Fear of God bare the chiefest Sway.</P>

<P N="1">I. LEt us see what cause of <HI>Thankfulness</HI> for what of this Blessing is enjoyed by our Nation and our Selves, or the People in this Land. God has blest the Nation with a Gracious QUEEN, whose Heart has not only been incli∣ned to Favour Religion, but engaged to Defend and Promote the interest of it. Her Royal <HI>PRO∣CLAMATION</HI> for <HI>Preventing</HI> and <HI>Punishing all Vice, Immorality</HI> and <HI>Prophaness,</HI> put forth soon af∣ter Her Accession to the Throne, was a Publick Expression of it: Wherein all sorts of Persons are Excited to the due Observance of all Divine (as well as Humane) Laws, Statutes, and Com∣mands, as they tender God's Honour, the Queen's
<PB N="35" REF="001279_0037_0FB2145D359C4610"/>
Favour, and their own Welfare: Besides other gracious Acts of late. Likewise the <HI>Reforming Societies</HI> in our Nation, or the Combination of Christians of every Rank, Quality, and Order, to Advance Piety and Virtue, and bear Testimony against all that is contrary thereunto in them∣selves and others; the continuance of their Pi∣ous Resolution, Success of their Endeavours, and Progress in the Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> are hopeful signs (at least) that God is not about to leave the Nation yet, wherein, notwithstanding the Atheism, and Irreligion of some, the Apostacy and Declension of others, May it not (without Prejudice to Truth, and then why not without Offence to the World) be said, <HI>That there is yet more of true Religion and Godliness</HI> [in that Land of our Fore-Fathers] <HI>than in any such spot of Earth on the Globe besides!</HI> And has not the God of Glo∣ry appeared Wonderfully with them and for them, in his Favourable Providences, tho' not without some sore Rebukes thereof!</P>
<P>Indeed <HI>New-England</HI> has great Reason of <HI>Thanks∣giving</HI> to God also: tho' none at all of Boasting in her self, for what of <HI>Religion</HI> is to be found here. It was a strong inclination to God and his Ways in the Heart of our Fathers, and Predecessors that first drew them into this Wilderness: They were generally Men Eminent in Piety &amp; Virtue, that Setled this Country, and Served their Generati∣on here according to the Will of God, with much
<PB N="36" REF="001279_0038_0FB2145E92E09C70"/>
Faithfulness and Zeal for the Glory of God and good of Posterity. God was wonderfully with them, in his Ordinances and in his Providences, Wrought wonderfully for them and by them, in laying of Foundations here: and with their im∣mediate Successors in carrying on the Work so happily begun in their Days. We are now for the greatest Part of the Third and Fourth Gene∣ration of them that Loved God, and followed him into a Land that was not Sown: and tho' we have too generally left that <HI>First Love,</HI> yet God has not left the Land, (Blessed be his Name,) But we still see His goings among us, in ways of Mer∣cy as well as Judgment: and cannot without Impiety and Ingratitude omit to mention in way of Thankfulness &amp; Praise to God, what we now behold and enjoy of his Divine Presence and Fa∣vour, both in <HI>Foro</HI> and in <HI>Templo,</HI> yea may I not add also in <HI>Campo.</HI></P>
<P>This Land is yet blest with a <HI>Religious Ma∣gistracy</HI> and <HI>Zealous Ministry,</HI> and the body of the People may in the judgment of Charity be reckoned <HI>True Christians,</HI> or such in Reality as well as in Profession. The Glory of all which as it is only owing, so ought to be ascribed to the Riches of Divine Grace and Goodness; that notwithstanding the great Decay of Piety, and Defect of good Manners among us, to be Con∣fessed, Bewailed, and Mourned over: God has not left <HI>New-England</HI> (as in just judgment he

might) to a general Violation of his Covenant, or Apostacy from his Ways. And tho' he has visited our Transgression of his Laws with a Rod, and our Iniquity with Stripes, yet we trust he has not taken away his Loving kindness from us, nor will suffer his Faithfulness to fail towards us. There is yet much of his Spiritual Presence and influences of Grace afforded to some in every Order, Rank and Quality, both in Church and State. And likewise the Favourable Providence of God in many Publick instances thereof has been, and is yet extended to the Country in ge∣neral; which calls for Publick and general Ac∣knowledgments. As the Health, Plenty &amp; Quiet of this last year in the Land; Freedom from E∣pidemical Diseases, Pinching Necessities, &amp; Out∣rage of barbarous Eenemies. The continuance of our Civil and Ecclesiastical Liberties, with a∣bundance of other Mercies and Blessings. It is true our Civil Liberties and Priviledges are not just the same that sometimes they have been; yet it is better with us on that Account than we de∣serve, and than others no worse deserving than our selves Enjoy. Our Church State is the same as at first. We have never been interrupted, not imposed upon as to Doctrine, Worship, or Dis∣cipline. Indeed our Uneasiness and Discontent under the best Civil Government is the likeliest means to procure a Change for the worse. Our Unthankfulness for, and Unfruitfulness under
<PB N="38" REF="001279_0049_0FB2147BD1E1FCD8"/>
Gospel Priviledges (so highly valued in our Fa∣thers days,) do threaten us more than anything with the loss thereof, or with a <HI>Curse</HI> instead of a <HI>Blessing:</HI> Which calls to see and consider,</P>
<P N="2">II. What cause of <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Mourning</HI> on this Account, or for Want of this most desireable and comfortable Fruit &amp; Evidence of Gods Presence &amp; Favour. Is it not to be Confessed &amp; Lamented that God is not so with us, as he was with our Fa∣thers? And are there not too many fearful Symp∣toms of his further withdrawing, if not utterly leaving us? Among which <HI>this</HI> is none of the least, That He seems to loosen the Reins of Go∣vernment, and leave men to themselves, their own Counsels and Ways: when instead of Con∣verting Grace to incline them to all manner of Obedience, they have not so much as Restraining Grace to prevent any Sin and Wickedness, they have a mind to. Nay does not the Bent &amp; Byas of this Generation seem to be much Set, not un∣to God, his Statutes, Ordinances and Ways, but some to one Vanity or way of Wickedness, and some to another, according to their different Constitutions, or Inclinations of corrupted Na∣ture, Customs, Companions, and Temptations; so that there is scarce any sort of impiety and i∣niquity but may be seen to Be and Abound in the midst of us. Now what greater cause of <HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Lamentation!</HI> If meer Unregeneracy, or want of an Hearty inclination to God &amp; God∣liness
<PB N="39" REF="001279_0048_0FB214779A0623D0"/>
be so Lamentable a State, how much worse is it, when the Hearts of the Children of men are fully let in them to do Wickedly! The more common this is in any Place, the more cause of Mourning.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Doctrine calls upon us to do all we can in our several Stations and Capacities, to Retain what of this Blessing is Enjoyed, and to Obtain what is wanting.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It earnestly calls on those that are now the Fathers of the Country, <HI>Political</HI> and <HI>Spiri∣tual</HI> Fathers, to engage their Hearts in this Work. Both the Temporal and Spiritual Wel∣fare and Prosperity of these their Children and People must needs lie very near the Hearts of all such: Both Nature and Grace obliges such to the utmost expression of an affectionate con∣cern for them, and exercise of their Paternal Care for their good on every account.</P>
<P N="1">I. Our <HI>Political Fathers</HI> in the Commonwealth are hereby called upon, to do their utmost to engage the Presence of God with themselves &amp; us, to maintain the honour of Religion, and promote the Observance of all his Laws, Sta∣tutes and Judgments among us, by their Exam∣ple and Authority; as knowing how much their own and the Publick Happiness depends there∣on. <HI>Magistrates</HI> as men, are equally concerned with others to have respect to all Gods Com∣mandments; for they stand on the same level
<PB N="40" REF="001279_0047_0FB21475F09DA9D8"/>
before him who has no respect of Persons in Commanding, Judging or Rewarding, <HI>Job</HI> 34.19. As men, they are as much concerned to un∣derstand the way of Pleasing, Glorifying &amp; En∣joying God, as their meanest Subjects: Yea, the higher their Station, the greater their obli∣gation, even as men, 2 <HI>San.</HI> 12.7, 8, 9. As Ma∣gistrates and Rulers, they have great need to be acquainted with Gods Testimonies, that they may understand their Place and Duty, that they may be caried thro' their cares, fears &amp; snares; that they may have success, &amp; find acceptance. The way for such to Rule wisely and prospe∣rously, is in all their Government and Admini∣strations, to have respect to Gods Word, and keep close to that. This counsel and encou∣ragement the Lord himself gives to <HI>Joshua,</HI> Josh. 1.8. <HI>The Book of the Law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein; For then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and thou shalt then have good success.</HI> So <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 King. 2.3. Thus self interest obliges Rulers as well as others to be Religious, and Observant of Gods Commands themselves; But Duty obliges further, <HI>viz.</HI> to consult the good of the People under them.</P>
<P N="1">(I.) By being thus good Examples to them, both of Piety and Morality, or of all holy and vertuous carriages; this will have a mighty in∣fluence to draw others to the like practice.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="41" REF="001279_0046_0FB214746E5FF2C0"/>(2.) By exercising their Authority; who are first Gods Subjects, then his Officers, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4. <HI>Ministers of God for good to the people.</HI> Much good may a Godly Magistracy do to promote the re∣ligious interest of a people, as well as those of a civil and secular nature and concern. By de∣fending and maintaining their Spiritual Privi∣ledges, speaking comfortably to those that teach the good Knowledge of the Lord (as good <HI>He∣zekiah</HI> did) and providing suitable encourage∣ment for those that attend the Service of Gods House. Also by Restraining, Suppressing and Punishing the Transgressors of his Law. Tho' the hearts of men are not in the hands of these Earthly Gods (as the Scripture styles Magistrates) nor can they change their natural inclinations and wills; yet may do a great service by cor∣recting their manners and ways. And External Obedience or Conformity to Gods Law, is much better than none, especially as to the Publick. Tho' Hypocrisy is a great wickedness; and in some sense it is a truth, That <HI>Simulata sanctites est duplex iniquitas:</HI> Dissembled Holiness is a double wickedness: Be sure, it is very odious to God, yet not of so pernicious example to the World, as open Prophaness and Disobedience. Hypo∣crisy (as one says) shows some Reverence to Religion and the Ways of God, does so far ac∣knowledge the excellency hereof, as to own it deserves to be counterfeited; whereas Propha∣ness
<PB N="42" REF="001279_0045_0FB2147018F822B8"/>
and Immorality declare openly against it, and endeavour to make a Party to drive it out of the Land and World. Indeed, 'tis a matter of great difficulty to Reduce a Degenerate Peo∣ple, to bring them generally to outward Refor∣mation; yet that is the least which is necessary to save them from Publick Ruine, and the least that Pious Rulers will design and endeavour to accomplish. If such would heartily join to do all they can, by their Laws &amp; Examples, doubt∣less they would prevail much; and if they can∣not effect all they would, God will take it well, that it was in their hearts, and likewise Reward their Endeavours.</P>
<P><HI>May it therefore Please Your <HI>Excellency!</HI></HI></P>
<P>The God of <HI>New-England,</HI> [Our Fathers God and Ours] We trust had a Kindness and Fa∣vour for us, as well as Delight in You, SIR, When by His Providence he called Home, and Exalted a Person of such singular Worth, Wis∣dom and Goodness to the Place of Chief Rule and Government over us. Our Observation &amp; Experience of the Good Hand of the Lord which has been with You hitherto, Protecting, Direct∣ing, Assisting and Succeeding in the managing of our Publick Affairs, confirms that belief; calls for a most grateful Acknowledgment there∣of; and encourages us to Hope as well as Pray, that God will be with you still, that your Bow
<PB N="43" REF="001279_0044_0FB2146E639B3C00"/>
shall abide in strength, against all opposition; and the Arms of Your Hands be made stronger and stronger, by the Hands of the mighty God of <HI>Jacob,</HI> who shall bless Your Person and Go∣vernment, continue You as a Publick Blessing to these Provinces.</P>
<P>And will Your <HI>Excellency</HI> give us leave to expect, as from a Person so admirably accomplish∣ed for the exercise of Government in general, so familiarly acquainted with the circumstances of our particular State, Humour and Interest, Duties, Dangers and Dependancies, so many ways Related to, and interested with us, a pro∣portionable Zeal for the Honour of God and Religion; a greater forwardness to lay out such excellent Talents, &amp; improve such singular Ad∣vantages for the Good of the Lords People, Temporal &amp; Spiritual, than in reason we could expect from any other, not so qualified or ob∣liged.</P>
<P>As for those <HI>Honourable Persons</HI> that are, or may be Chosen this Day, and called to Assist His Excellency in Council, or any other parts of Government; it is the just expectation of those by whom ye are Chosen nextly or more remotely, that in all things you will sincerely design and endeavour to promote their Safety and Welfare. And whereas the interest of this People is chiefly a Religious Interest; and it is likely to fare with us on other accounts as it goes
<PB N="44" REF="001279_0043_0FB2146CC1D14178"/>
with Religion among us. Our great depen∣dance under God is upon your <HI>Honours</HI> Religi∣ous Care to see such things as are provoking to him in the Land reformed; &amp; that such things as he requires in order to a being pleased with us; and prospering of us, be observed. And if any thing further can be done to encourage &amp; pro∣mote the liberal Education of the Youth in the Country, whereby Learning and good Manners may be upheld; it will be a very great Service to the Interest of Church and State, both in the Present and Succeeding Generation. We there∣fore beseech your <HI>Honours</HI> in your Wisdom to meditate it, and by your Authority to establish a method for it.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Worthy Gentlemen</HI> that <HI>Represent</HI> the People of this Province in a <HI>General Assembly,</HI> &amp; who have called me (the unworthiest and unfit∣test of all the Lords Servants in the Ministry) to speak on such an Occasion as <HI>this,</HI> must bear with me, if now I take the freedom to say, you are indeed betrusted with a very great Power of Liberty and Priviledge from the People you re∣present, (as well as from GOD &amp; the QUEEN) to have a Hand in Chusing so many of their principal Rulers for them: To consent &amp; con∣cur in the making of those Laws by which they shall be Ruled; and to the laying of all Publick Taxes upon them. What you do in these mat∣ters, (which are all of very great concernment)
<PB N="45" REF="001279_0042_0FB214686E14FB58"/>
the People are obliged to stand to. Are not you therefore obliged to use utmost Prudence and Conscience in all? Your Wisdom and Fidelity, both are consided in, with reference to these things; That you Elect such only into the <HI>Coun∣cil,</HI> as upon good grounds you may judge to be Men that <HI>Fear GOD, and Honour the QUEEN,</HI> &amp; will be true to the best interest of this People, both in Spirituals and in Temporals. That then you concur with them in any further Acts of Le∣gislation necessary to promote the Interests of Holiness, Justice and Peace in our Land. That you lay not unnecessary Burdens of Charge on the People, considering their deep Poverty; Nor yet be unwilling to expend and lay out what is necessary to Defend the Country, <HI>this Principal Town,</HI> the Life, Liberties and Estates of the People in it: And likewise to support the Go∣vernment Honourably; I mean with the double Honour and due Respect, &amp; Maintainance or Reward.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our <HI>Spiritual Fathers</HI> in the Churches can∣not chuse but be Desirous above all other things to see their <HI>Children Walking in the Truth,</HI> and <HI>Wayes of God,</HI> from a Hearty inclination thereunto. They greatly long for this Fruit of their Ministerial Labours, and Prayers: and to leave this Pledge of the Lords Abiding Presence with their Suc∣cessors. I presume not to <HI>Direct</HI> or <HI>Counsel</HI> our <HI>Reverend Elders</HI> in any Case, but rather <HI>In∣treat</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="001279_0041_0FB21466D7EC15A0"/>
them as Fathers, and ask their Prayers and Blessings for my self and Brethren of the Young∣er Generation: Particularly, This Blessing in our Text, <HI>That the God of our Fathers, even your God may be our God, and that he would be with us, as he has been and is with you,</HI> according to the Gospel Charter, or special Promise of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Matt.</HI> 28.20. And help us to abide Faithful with Him both as <HI>Christians</HI> &amp; as <HI>Ministers,</HI> Endeavouring to Keep the Truths of God invi∣olate, which we have received, and to hand them down along to Posterity. To Keep the Worship of God and his Ordinances Pure and Incorrupt, and to promote the Sincere Conversion of Men as well as their outward Reformation. Restrain∣ing Grace is not sufficient, but <HI>Regeneration</HI> is ne∣nessary to Salvation. This is Gods Work, but we may haply be instrumental to it: By Teaching the Nature and Necessity of CON∣VERSION, Making that the Principal Subject of our Ministry or Doctrine. By Being or Set∣ting Examples of Holy and Righteous, Peacea∣ble and Charitable Walking: By incessant Pray∣ers to God for his Victorious Grace, to Change the Hearts of Men, and cause them to Walk in his Statutes. This is Gods Covenant with his People, and Ministers as Advocates must put the Promise in suit for them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> This Doctrine speaks to the Body of the People. Several things,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="47" REF="001279_0049_0FB2147BD1E1FCD8"/>I. It calls to the Hearty Exercise of the Fore∣mentioned Affections, <HI>Joy</HI> &amp; <HI>Grief,</HI> or to <HI>Thanks∣giving</HI> and <HI>Mourning,</HI> according to the different occassions for them.</P>
<P N="1">(I.) <HI>New-England</HI> may yet <HI>Rejoyce in the Lord, and Joy in the God of her Salvation: He that is the God of Salvation is our God, and is in the midst of us.</HI> Let us Admire &amp; Adore his Goodness in not leav∣ing of us after so many Days &amp; Years of Provo∣cation. Be exceeding <HI>Thankful</HI> for what of his Gracious Presence and the Fruits of it is seen and enjoyed. Thankfulness for a <HI>Little,</HI> is the way to have <HI>More,</HI> at least, to have that continued and Blest unto us. Were the People of the Country generally more sensible of and affected with the Goodness of God in respect of that Go∣vernment we are under, and the Gracious Ap∣pearances of God with our <HI>Honourable</HI> GOVER∣NOUR &amp; COUNCIL, in the good Conduct &amp; Succesful Management of our Publick Affairs, Particularly, respecting the <HI>War;</HI> I say, were the Favour of Heaven in this regard more thankfully acknowledged, it would be a probable Means to have the Tranquility of our State Prolonged, and other Blessings added: <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.2. <HI>When as for the Transgressions of a Land, many are the Princes &amp; Rulers thereof,</HI> (either together contending for Supre∣macy, or successively by frequent Changes,) <HI>But by a man of Understanding &amp; Knowledge, the State thereof shall be prolonged. Moreover,</HI> If the Churches
<PB N="48" REF="001279_0050_0FB2147CE9247498"/>
and People of <HI>New-England</HI> were more <HI>Thankful</HI> for the <HI>Gospel,</HI> &amp; Kingdom of our Glorious LORD, that is yet Visible therein, for the Liberty of their Religion and free Exercise of it, without Subscrib∣ing to New Articles of Faith, Worship or Disci∣pline, and had Wisdom &amp; Grace rightly to im∣prove it, they would certainly see more of the blessed Fruits thereof. Blessed be God for what appearance there is of the <HI>Power of Godliness,</HI> for such a Number of those whose Hearts are towards Him, &amp; whose endeavour is to <HI>Walk in his ways,</HI> to <HI>Keep his Commandments, his Statutes &amp; his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) But <HI>New-England</HI> ought also to <HI>Mourn</HI> for what is wanting of this Blessing. Does iniquity abound in the Country, and the Love of many (in the Churches) <HI>wax Cold,</HI> and Professors of Christianity allow themselves in many great Im∣moralities? This argues Gods withdrawing, and may provoke to a leaving of us, unless it be generally lamented by us. This Duty indeed does chiefly concern Publick Persons, tho' it lies upon all Christians, <HI>Magistrates, Ministers,</HI> &amp; other Officers of Church, and State. Publick Persons must have Publick Affections as well as Relations. They are more Responsible to God than others, and more concerned in the Sins of the Land and Places where they have a Charge than others. Among Private Persons, a <HI>Housholder</HI> is more Re∣sponsible than a Private Member of the Family for any Disorders, and so proportionably in greater
<PB N="49" REF="001279_0051_0FB2147E16FE8538"/>
and more Publick Societies. Now this is the Dis∣position as well as Duty of such as are truly God∣ly, to grieve and mourn for the Sins of the Age, and Place they live in, and for the number of <HI>Transgressors: Psal.</HI> 119.136. <HI>David</HI> says, <HI>I beheld the Transgressors, and was grieved, because they kept not thy Word.</HI> So <HI>Jeremiah</HI> Weeps in Secret for the Pride and obstinacy of that Generation. Fit instances for the Christian Magistrate &amp; Minister. But this is not enough: Except the Body of the People do lay to heart the Sins of the Times, there is little ground to expect better Times, or that they will continue as they are, but grow worse and worse, more Sinful, and more Miserable still.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the Doctrine thus applied to our present mixt Condition, calls for the Exercise of these diffe∣rent Affections; So to stir up <HI>Our Selves</HI> to <HI>Take hold on God,</HI> that we may retain his Presence, and receive his Blessings. The Prophet complains of an Universal Neglect hereof in his time, <HI>Isa.</HI> 64.7. <HI>There is none that stirreth up himself to take hold on thee:</HI> The People were Pining away in their Sins and Misery, by reason of the Lords Absence, or Departure from them; the ground of his leaving them was <HI>their not laying hold of him,</HI> and want of stirring up themselves the Cause of that Neglect. Is not this too much our Case? Indeed the A∣bounding of Sin is that which first provokes the Lord to take up thoughts of Departing; but tis for want of our Taking Hold of Him, that He
<PB N="50" REF="001279_0052_0FB2147F92326E98"/>
actually leaves and goes away: Not that He is over-forward to take Occasion for it. Tis said, <HI>He does not willingly afflict or grieve the Children of men, Lam.</HI> 3.33. Much less leave and forsake his own Children &amp; People. Nay, instead of this, There is great Backwardness, &amp; Lothness in God, (speaking after the manner of Men:) <HI>Hos.</HI> 11.8. He says, <HI>How shall I give thee up</HI> Ephraim? <HI>How shall I deliver thee</HI> O Israel? Yet the Lord expects to be invited and urged to carry, or return if go∣ing: that the Faithful among his People lay hold of Him, and not let him go quite. As the Spouse did, <HI>Gant.</HI> 3.4. <HI>I held him, and would not let him go, till I brought him into my Mothers House.</HI> God seem∣ed to shake off <HI>Jacob</HI> as willing to be rid of him; but when he would not let him go, He stays to <HI>Bless him, Gen.</HI> 32.26. Afterwards the Lord was taking his final leave of <HI>Israel,</HI> if <HI>Moses</HI> had not laid strong Hands upon him, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.10, 11. But that Prevented. Does the Lord threaten to leave <HI>New-England,</HI> to give over his Work here? and cannot She find her Hands at such a time, or has She no Heart to lay hold on Him? This were a more fearful Symptom of being forsaken than any other. Oh! Let us stir up our selves and one another to take hold of the Lord our God! And what other Hold of God have we but his Covenant? what have we to do with him in any other way? or what Expectation from him? Is this <HI>Immanuels</HI> Land? Are we the People of the
<PB N="51" REF="001279_0053_0FB214844A2B7848"/>
Lord? Has he any special right and interest in us? This is the ground of his Care for our Safe∣ty &amp; Welfare, &amp; chief Argument for us to plead with Him. Thus <HI>David</HI> Personally, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.94. <HI>I am thine, Save me.</HI> This the People of <HI>Israel</HI> in∣sisted on, <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.9. <HI>Behold, see we beseech thee, We are all thy People.</HI> More Expressly still, <HI>Jer.</HI> 14. <HI>O Lord, Though our iniquities Testify against us, and our Backslidings are many: We have Sinned against thee, O thou Hope of Israel and Saviour thereof in times of Trouble, why shouldest thou be as a Stranger in our Land. Yet thou art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy Name, leave us not, Remember &amp; break not thy Covenant with us.</HI> Especially when we ask for this peculiar Blessing thereof, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18. <HI>Turn us and we shall be turned, Convert us, and we shall be Converted; for thou art the Lord our God.</HI> But we must Repent of our Covenant breaking with him, Acknowledge our Unfaithfulness to the Lord, Renew Covenant again, and Return to our Duty and Fidelity. In order where-unto we must let goe our <HI>Idols.</HI> God never departs till there be another taken in with Him, or set up by him to croud him out: and God will not continue or ever return, unless these <HI>Idols</HI> be cast away, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14.3, 5. One of the chief of them is the <HI>World,</HI> or our great <HI>Heart Idolatry,</HI> is <HI>Coveteousness, Isa.</HI> 57.17. <HI>God.</HI> 3.5. But be it <HI>Pride, Sensuality, Intemperance,</HI> or whatever else, it must be put away, or tis in vain to Confess we have Sinned against God in
<PB N="52" REF="001279_0054_0FB2148595A1F2D8"/>
vain to Cry, <HI>Lord Leave us not: Jacob</HI> took Ef∣fectual care to Purge his Family of their <HI>Idols,</HI> and buried them under an Oak which was by <HI>She∣chem,</HI> when going up to <HI>Bethel</HI> to pay his former Vows to the Lord that appeared to him, answer∣ed him in his Distress, and was with him in the Way whither he went, <HI>Gen.</HI> 35. <HI>beginning.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This Doctrine calls us to <HI>Prayer,</HI> to be much in <HI>Prayer,</HI> (in our Courts &amp; Church Assembles, in our Families and Closets;) and in our Prayers to make this our chief Request, <HI>That God would incline our Hearts to Himself and his Ways.</HI> Is this the most Desirable Blessing in it self? Let us make it the chief Object of our Desires, for our selves &amp; ours. We should not be content without this E∣vidence of Gods Presence, and instance of his Favour, whatever external Symbols &amp; Tokens of it we may enjoy, thro' his Merciful good Provi∣dence: But be urgent &amp; instant in Asking for the <HI>Spirit of Grace,</HI> and influences thereof, to make us an humble and Obedient People: our Land <HI>an Habitation of Justice, and Mountain of Holiness;</HI> that so our God may take Delight to dwell in the midst of us. And would we have the Benefits of this Abiding Presence of God Entailed to Posterity, &amp; our <HI>Children</HI> also to <HI>Keep his Commandments, his Sta∣tutes &amp; his Judgments,</HI> We must Cry mightily to that God who performeth all things for us &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and has Promised this in Answer to Prayer, as in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26, 27, 37. Prayer indeed is the most
<PB N="53" REF="001279_0055_0FB2148711A08ED8"/>
approved <HI>Medium</HI> to obtain any Blessing from the Lord, and especially in the Case before us. For, Except God make bare his Arm, and Exert the Power of Soveraign Grace, all means will be in∣effectual here. LAWS of <HI>Magistrates, Counsel</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> of <HI>Ministers, Parents, Masters, Tutors,</HI> all to no purpose without this. Nor will the Provi∣dences of God effect this change: Neither Mer∣cies nor Judgments will bring an Unconverted People to Reformation. They will not so much as Frame their Doings to turn unto the Lord, much less will the Hearts of any be inclined and ingaged to his Service, without the effectual Working of his mighty Spirit, which alone subdueth all things to Himself.</P>
<P N="4">4. Do we all or generally concur with this Pi∣ous <HI>Wish</HI> or <HI>Prayer</HI> of <HI>Solomon, That the God of our Fa∣thers would be with us as he was with them,</HI> to the same End &amp; Effect; Then let us concur in an Endea∣vourous Resolution to <HI>Be with God,</HI> and Walk with him as our <HI>Fathers</HI> were &amp; did. We must enclined our Ears to his Voice, that he may encline our Hearts unto his ways. Yea this also is our Duty, tho' it be Gods work. Hence <HI>Joshua</HI> Exhorts the People thereto, <HI>Josh.</HI> 24 23. <HI>Incline your Hearts to the Lord God of Israel.</HI> And <HI>David</HI> professes thus of himself, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.112. <HI>I have inclined my Heart to perform thy Statutes always.</HI> This dont imply any Coordinate operation in us with God, in the Work of Grace; but only our Subservient Endeavours in
<PB N="54" REF="001279_0056_0FB2148B44630048"/>
the pursuing of it. God begins with his preventing Grace, &amp; the Soul follows the impressions left upon it. <HI>Turn me &amp; I shall be turned,</HI> was the Prophet <HI>Jere∣miahs</HI> Prayer; and agreeable hereto was the A∣postle <HI>Paul</HI>'s Exhortation, <HI>Work, for it is God that worketh in you,</HI> both the <HI>Will</HI> &amp; the <HI>Deed,</HI> the first in∣clination, and the Actual Accomplishment. Tis Certain that we <HI>Do</HI> what we <HI>Do,</HI> tho' God causeth us to <HI>Do</HI> it, according to that of <HI>Austin: Certum est nos facere quod facimus, sed Deus facit ut faciamus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> Here is a Call to the <HI>Uprising Generation.</HI> Whom I refer to those Excellent Elaborate Trea∣tises on that particular Subject Extant among you. Beseeching you carefully to Observe the Rules &amp; Motives commonly given in them: Only thus much in general. Be Exceeding careful to avoid every thing that may provoke God to Deny you his <HI>Presence:</HI> and as careful to Do all that has any tendency to engage it with you. Trusting in the Mercy of God, <HI>Which is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that Fear him; and His Righ∣teousness which is unto Childrens Children, to such as keep his Covenant, and Remember his Commandments to Do them,</HI> Psal. 103.17, 18.</P>
