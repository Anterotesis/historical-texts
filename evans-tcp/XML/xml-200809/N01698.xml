<HEAD>A Brief Apology,</HEAD>
<P>IT is not that we love Contenti∣on or desire Controversie, or are Impatient in bearing Reproach∣es, that we appear thus Publick; but such have been the repeated high Charges and smart Lashes that our Adversaries (more especially some of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Assembly) have of late taken a Liberty, liberal∣ly and lavishly to bestow upon us; that we find our selves concerned to Clear and Vindicate the Truth and Innocency of our Christian Pro∣fession from those black Aspersions, that have rendered it so frightful and formidable, as tho' 'twere only a meer Complication of Pestilent Errors, as well to saisfy the Minds of such of our Piously-in∣clined Neighbours as may be de∣sirous

to hear us speak for our selves as also for the Information of those, who may have been Imposed upon, by that Dress wherein our Oppo∣sers have represented us. And al∣tho' these can object nothing mate∣rial against us now, that hath not been long since over and over offer∣ed by some of the same Perswasion, and have as often received Answers from some or other of our Friends; (some of which have never yet been by them Replyed unto) yet for∣asmuch as those may not have come to the View of many of our Neigh∣bours, for whom this is chiefly in∣tended, we thought it fit briefly to say so much as we think may be accommodate to the present Occasi∣on; and which perhaps with un∣prejudic'd Minds may bespeak our Creed not so Unsound and Errone∣ous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Est. 3.5.</NOTE> as our somewhat different De∣portment hath rendred us Obnoxi∣ous and Contemptible, as well as Distastful to those who either am∣bitiously

<P>We therefore desire our well-dis∣posed Neighbours candidly to weigh what we have to alledge a∣gainst the Clamours of those, who to be sure will not set us out to our best Advantage; and to receive an Account from our selves what we are, and what we believe and hold for Christian Truths; who certain∣ly must needs know better our own Belief, than those who perhaps ne∣ver examined it, to any other End than to find fault, if ever they did it; and also that you will not think it strange, that we express not our Be∣lief in some Particulars, in the af∣fected Terms of other Professors of Christianity, but think it more rea∣sonable

<P>Thus have we candidly, tho' briefly, exprest our real Opinion and Belief in those Points in which we apprehend our
<PB N="98" REF="002016_0097_0FBA75EB3ABA58F8"/>
Adversaries have endeavoured most to expose us; which we hope may <HI>prove Satisfactory</HI> to those who are not resolv∣ed to think ill of us: But to speak fully to every Critical, Trifling Objection, were a tedious Task, as well as vastly beyond the Extent of our Design. We request out <HI>Serious Neighbours</HI> to <HI>Hear</HI> and <HI>See</HI> for <HI>themselves,</HI> and not take things upon <HI>Trust</HI> from <HI>Others,</HI> and judging the things they know not, condemn us by hear say. Don't be imposed upon by those whose peevish Humours would have all do like themselves; who either look not at all, or but very coyly, into the Books of those they have taken a Pet against, whose Perswasion in some things differs from what they have pronounced Orthodox; as tho' Truth were their peculiar Inclo∣sure; which yet argues either a great deal of Prejudice, or a feeble and fleeting Judg∣ment, that dares not trust it self. Were our Books stuft with such palpable <HI>Er∣rors</HI> as is suggested, surely twere not so dangerous reading them: Who fears to read the <HI>Alcoran?</HI> But on the contrary, 'tis a strong Indication that they contain much Truth; for as 'tis the proper Ob∣ject of the Understanding, so where it ap∣pears with a clear Evidence, answering to
<PB N="99" REF="002016_0098_0FBA75F0EEE6CA48"/>
Peoples own Experience, 'tis very forcible and prevalent upon the minds of those, who diligently seek it for Love of it, and willingly deposit all pre-engagements of Mind in its disquisition. Be then so just to us and kind to your selves, as to relin∣quish all Prejudice and Prepossessions, and impartially examine the Truth of these things; search the Sacred Scriptures diligently, with an Inclination rather to find and embrace Truth than to support a received Opinion; try whether it is so or not; comparing it with your own Experiences, and the Witness of God in your own Hearts. Tho' our Belief in some of these Particulars don't exactly quadrate to that of our Opposers, it don't therefore necessarily follow 'tis not agree∣able to Truth and Scripture: nor can they give us any infallible assurance, that their Conceptions are a true Standard of Truth notwithstanding they vend their Appre∣hensions as the only Orthodox; yes and are displeased too with those that can't be determined by them.</P>
<P>We have no design carrying on be∣hind the Curtain, howsoever our Sober Demeanour may be uncharitably (not to say maliciously) insinuated as only a co∣ver of Sheeps Cloathing upon the Wolves

Nature; and our most Solemn Declaration of our Belief in several Religious Points (being undeniable <HI>Truths</HI>) construed and suggested by some Men as only a fair Cover wherewith we gild over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r Poyson that it may pass the less suspected, and be the more glibly swallowed. What think you? Is not this the heighth of Prejudice, and Envy in the abstract? Would they themselves be content to be thus Inter∣preted? We have no intent to decoy and trap an Peo∣ple that we should walk under a Disguise; which Intreagues usually have Interest at one end of them, which can't be our Case, who neither give nor take Money for Preaching; so that the Increase of our Numbers won't fill our Coffers. We have no other Interest to promote but the Advancement of True Piety and Christianity: and having Love and good Will to all People, more especially to those whose Minds are awakned, and Hearts warmed, having true fervent Desires, and living Breathings towards God, thirsting after a nearer and more satisfactory Knowledge of, and Acquaintance with him, than barely a profession and hear say of him; and there∣fore what we have found advantageous, assistant and satisfactory to us, in our unwearied Pursuit af∣ter Peace with him, that we recommend to others. We call People home to the Gift of God in them∣selves, which only can do them good; that every one may know the good Shepherd and Bishop of Souls for themselves, and hear and know his Voice in them, from that of a Stranger, and learn of him and follow him, who is pure, and ever leads to Pu∣rity and Holiness; that so his offering up of himself for them may be of Benefit to them, and they ex∣perience the great Salvation of God. For impress this upon your Minds, and take it along with you, <HI>That notwithstanding our Saviour hath paid a Ransom for us and made an atonement through the precious Blood of his Cross; yet if we experience not the End of his
<PB N="101" REF="002016_0100_0FBA86CE35B89FE0"/>
Coming and Death, effected and answered in our selves, it shall avail us nothing:</HI> Except we know him a Saviour and Supporter near; except we know a Principle of Divine Light and Life, to illuminate our Minds, to revive and warm our langishing Hearts, to beget and increase true Love to God, and the living Faith that gives Victory, to convert us, and govern our Thoughts, to renew and regulate our Wills, and limit our Desires, and bridle our Tongues, to excite holy Inclinations, and keep up a due Heat in our Christianity, and strengthen our Minds in that which is good and well-pleasing to God: Except we know these things in and for our selves, all our out-side shew of Religion is but vain, and our Profession of Christ shall profit us nothing;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom.</HI> 8 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 14.</NOTE> but we shall lye down in Sorrow at last. For none are Christ's but those that have his Spirit, and are influenced by it; nor are any Children of God but those that are led by the Spirit of God; which begets in the Mind a de∣testation of Sin and Evil, and a love to Purity, Goodness and Virtue. Wherefore laying aside all Strife and Animosites, all Envying and Evil-speak∣ing, let us abhor that which is Evil,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rom</HI> 12.9</NOTE> and cleave to that which is Good, and address our selves with a due and Humble Application to the Accomplish∣ment of that most Concerning and Important Affair of our Lives, the working out our Salvation And let every one follow the Lord faitfully, according to what is made known to them; knowing that we shall be judged according to our Knowledge, and that 'twill be happy for those whose Wills and Per∣formances correspond with their Understandings, in that Day when all must stand before the Judg∣ment-Seat of Christ, and give an Account of their Deeds done in the Body, and receive a Sentence thereafter, either, <HI>Come ye Blessed,</HI> or <HI>Depart from me, ye Workers of Iniquity.</HI> It won't be then of what Congregation or Confession of Faith, or of
<PB N="102" REF="002016_0101_0FBA86CFACCDECC8"/>
what Perswasion amongst the many wast thou▪ A∣mong all which there will then be but two Sorts, the Sheep and the Goats; those that heard the Shep∣herds Voice, and followed him, who were guided and governed by the good Spirit of God in their Hearts; and those who wrapping their Talent in a Napkin, stifled Convictions, and neglecting the Day of their Visitation, continued under the dark Power of the Evil One. One may go a great way, and make a fair shew of Religion and Piety, and yet be turned to the left Hand; 'tis not having our Heads filled with curious sublime Notions, tho' of never so fine and elevated a Speculation; let's trim and gar∣nish our Lamps never so finely, 'twil not administer an entrance without the Heavenly Oil, without that holy Divine Unction fills our Hearts, enlightens our Minds, and inflames our Affections to a due Watch∣fulness and Obedience to its Teachings; which are the most assured Marks of our being really in Christ, in whom only our acceptance is.</P>
<P>That you with us, and we with you, may so cir∣cumspectly live up to our Light and Knowledge given by Christ, as that our Consciences may not condemn us; but that having finished our Days here with Comfort, we may lay down our Heads in Peace, with a well-grounded Hope of a Joyful Resurrecti∣on, and have boldness in the Day of Judgment, is our Hearty Desire.</P>
<P>For howsoever People may have been possest with the contrary, by those who probably have left no∣thing unattempted, which their Invention could supply, to fix an Odium, and scare People from us, we believe the Resurrection as delievered to us in the Holy Scriptures, and our Adversaries can't rea∣sonable pretend to know more; in which we will∣ingly acquiesce; content that Faith supply the de∣fect of Demonstration; esteeming it con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entaneous to Reason, to forbear even the most abstracted Rea∣soning
<PB N="103" REF="002016_0102_0FBA86D1E68CB2B8"/>
about that which is above Reason. We doubt not in the least either the Reality or Excellency of it; but our great Care, and necessary Concern is <HI>That if by any Means we may attain to the Resurrec∣tion of the Just; and then 'tis sufficient that when our Lord appears we shall be like him: Which Hope and Expectation ought to incite in all most fervent Desires,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>and vigorous Pursuits after Purity and Holiness.</HI></P>
<P>If what we have writen for your Information, may find some place with Those, who being Impartial and Inquiring, have Room to receive it and that it contributes to their Benefit and Satisfaction, we have our End: But for those who are Full, or are Critical, and ready to Carp at every Word or Sen∣tence that is not plac'd to their Mind, if not also pre-judge it, as tis not intended for them; so we don't suppose 'twill prove to their good Liking, nor meet with a Reception amongst them. For we don't purpose to reconcile our whole Belief and Perswasion in Religious Matters to that of our Opposers, who notwithstanding what we have writ, we expect will yet accuse us of Error.</P>
<P>However, having thus far declar'd our selves in the most necessary Points of the Christian Religion, we don't think our selves further obliged to answer the Cavils and Critiscisms of such who may appear Contentious, and will never want something to-object against those that come not up in all things exactly to their Level. Whom yet we advise ra∣ther to be quiet, and study to know and govern themselves according to that Religion that is pure and undefiled before God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jam</HI> 1.27</NOTE> and leads to Visit and Assist the Fatherless and Widdows in their Afflic∣tion, and to keep themselves from the Spots and Defilements of this World. Were this (as it ought) our Principal Care and Concern in our Conduct, we should have little Mind or Lesure to differ about Matters of less Moment: And while
<PB N="104" REF="002016_0103_0FBA86D3934DDD30"/>
we seem zealously to contend about Religion, frustrare its End. We should not be taken up in Disputing what that Principle is, which <HI>God</HI> hath plac'd in us, <HI>to do us Good,</HI> and in the mean time neglect its Assistance, and obstruct its Operation upon the Mind, but be given up to be Leavened and Changed by it, that we may partake of the Blessings thereof; and with it build on the Foun∣dation which God hath laid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3.11, 12, 13 14.</NOTE> that which may a∣bide the Fiery Tryal. To which we recommend you, and remain your Peaceable and Loving Neigh∣bours.</P>
