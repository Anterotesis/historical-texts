<HEAD>An ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Christianity was designed to be productive of the most happy effects on mankind, even to restore them to the divine Favour, and to qualify them for the enjoy∣ments of the divine Presence,—how few are there of its professors, who appear, by their practice, to advert to the nature and end of this dispensation of mercy.</P>
<P>How many who are openly regardless of its precepts of virtue, and pride themselves in their unrighteousness.</P>
<P>Of those whose external demeanor is not so reprehensible, and who pay some attention to the outward duties of religion, is it not to be feared there are vast numbers who are strangers to its spirit; who entertain unjust ideas con∣cerning it; who flatter themselves they are the heirs of redemption, when their sins are unab∣solved;
<PB N="4" REF="019154_0003_0FAA5DE386A48020"/>
their hearts unrenewed, and, conse∣quently, they are the objects of divine dis∣pleasure?</P>
<P>And, it is presumed, you are now sensible, that until very lately, even yourselves were of the number of those who are nominal pro∣fessors only of the gospel, and, therefore, in that "broad way of iniquity that leadeth to destruction!"</P>
<P>But, happily, through divine goodness, it is hoped, that you now have more perfect conceptions of Christianity and of your state through sin!—That you are now convinced of its nature and demerits!—That you now, from principle, detest it; wish to be delivered from its penalty; to be liberated from its power; to possess holiness of heart, and the favour of heaven!</P>
<P>YOU are, however, involved in distress. You weep for sin, without comfort! You seek the divine favour; but do not obtain it! You are athirst for the waters of life; but cannot ap∣proach them! And, perhaps, some of you are tempted to conclude, that never was any sorrow equal to that with which you are afflicted!</P>
<P>BUT suffer not yourselves to despair of de∣liverance from your state of woe! And permit me to endeavour to minister consolation to
<PB N="5" REF="019154_0004_0FAA5DE440C97250"/>
you, and to offer some advice suitable to your situation.</P>
<P>STRANGE, indeed, would it be, if, on per∣ceiving the perfidy, vileness and ingratitude of sin; and the miseries to which it exposes you,—even to eternal death, you should not be most sensibly moved!</P>
<P>Is it reasonable to imagine that the HEART <HI>itself</HI> can be <HI>broken</HI> by <HI>contrition</HI> and <HI>not</HI> be <HI>pained?</HI>—Does not our Lord assure us, we <HI>must "mourn"</HI> for our offences, before we shall be "<HI>comforted</HI>" with a sense of the Almighty's affection? And that we <HI>must feel</HI> the burthen of iniquity, previous to our being <HI>delivered</HI> from its <HI>pressure?</HI></P>
<P>But have you not every reason to hope you may be freed from the guilt of sin and its effects?</P>
<P>On account of your transgressions you are exposed to the curse of the divine law: and of yourselves you are unable to appease heavenly justice. You perceive the "wages of sin is death:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 23.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> and that, therefore, should "God be extreme to mark what you have done amiss,"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxx. 3.</NOTE> you must sink beneath the weight of divine vengeance!</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="019154_0005_0FAA5DE508E7A5D8"/>But hath not the Father of mercies evinced, he "delighteth not in your death; but would rather you should turn from your wickedness and live?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>Did he not "so love the world as to give his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlast∣ing life?"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John iii. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>As Christ, for you, hath answered the de∣mands of the divine law;—as for you, "he was despised and rejected of men; became a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief; was stricken, smitten of God and afflicted;" as he was "wounded for your transgressions, bruised for your iniquities," that "by his stripes you may be healed;"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. liii.</NOTE> the Almighty, therefore, without any impeachment of his justice can pardon your disobedience, and indulge you with his favour.</P>
<P>And, in divine compassion, are you not in∣vited to repair to God for the enjoyment of his love?</P>
<P>Is it not written, that "he who covereth his sins shall not prosper; but that he who confesseth and forsaketh them, through faith in the merits of Christ, "shall find mercy?"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxviii. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019154_0006_0FAA5DE626F027A8"/>Are you not thus addressed by the Prophet Isaiah?</P>
<P>"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. lv. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon!"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. lv. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Return," saith the Almighty, by the Pro∣phet Jeremiah, "ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jer. iii. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>Doth not the son of God himself, with arms of mercy, wide extended, thus deign to solicit your attention?</P>
<P>"Come unto me, all ye who labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest!"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Matt. xi. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P>"He that cometh to me," he also says, for the blessings of the gospel, "I will in no wise cast out!"<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">John vi. 37.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man heareth my voice, and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me!"<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="019154_0007_0FAA5DE672E95340"/>"And the Spirit and the Bride say come! And let him that heareth say come! And let him that is athirst come! And whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT you are convinced that the scepter of divine mercy is extended to you; that "Christ hath become a propitiation, not only for your sins, but also for those of the whole world;"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 2.</NOTE> you, however, perceive yourselves unable pro∣perly to regard that "faithful saying▪ so wor∣thy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>You feel the anguish of guilt; but can ob∣tain no tranquility of mind!</P>
<P>You believe the gospel to be a dispensation from heaven, but cannot so believe in Christ, as, with humble confidence, to rely on the efficacy of his blood, to cleanse you from sin!</P>
<P>Your souls are agitated, too, by discordant passions; you cannot reduce your breasts to se∣riousness, nor obtain that holy disposition of spirit, required by christianity!</P>
<P>Could you in rea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> expect it should be otherwise, than that you should be thus af∣fected?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="019154_0008_0FAA5DE745D145E8"/>Can it be supposed the Prince of darkness should relinquish possession of you, without a contest?</P>
<P>To be "turned from darkness to light; from the power of Satan unto God!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>How great must be this change in the hu∣man heart?</P>
<P>And how many have there been who, while this change was in its accomplishment, have for days, weeks, months, or, perhaps, even years, endure great perturbation of mind, and depression of spirit?</P>
<P>But there have been great numbers who have not been thus distressed, before they en∣joyed the consolations of the gospel; and many have no sooner sorrowed for sin, but they have rejoiced in the manifestations of the divine love towards them.</P>
<P>There is a great diversity in penitents with respect to their apprehensions of the nature of evil; the distress they experience by reason of their sins, and the degrees of satisfaction, peace and joy they are favoured with.</P>
<P>No one person's experience, therefore, in these particulars, can justly be regarded as a standard to which others must be equal, be∣fore they can be esteemed Christians, indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="019154_0009_0FAA5DE81A83A8A0"/>And as it cannot rationally be doubted but some, through unhappiness of conduct, unne∣cessarily endure anguish of heart, before they obtain consolation, through Christ; to such, the ensuing counsel is offered as not being, it is conceived, unworthy of their serious at∣tention.</P>
<P>FIRST: Do not, in any sort, indulge the idea, that you will not be blest with a sense of the divine favour.</P>
<P>How many consoling expressions are there in the sacred writings adapted to your state; and particularly, these which follow?</P>
<P>"A broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. li. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>"They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy! He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing pre∣cious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him!"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. cxxvi. 5, 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God! Speak ye comfortably to Jeru∣salem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquities are par∣doned!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isai. xl. 1, 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>"O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain! O Jerusa∣lem,

that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength: Lift it up, be not afraid! Say unto the cities of Judah, behold your God! Behold the Lord God will come with a strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him! Behold his reward is with him, and his work before him! He shall feed his flock like a shepherd! He shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xxxix. 9, 10, 11.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>"Fear thou not, for I am with thee! Be not dismayed, for I am thy God! I will strengthen thee; yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness! Behold, all they that were incensed against thee, shall be ashamed and confounded! they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish!"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. xli. 10, 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>"For I the Lord God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, fear not, I will keep thee! Fear not thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel! I will help thee, saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer, the holy one of Israel!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ib. xli. 13, 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>"A bruised reed shall he," that is Christ, "not break; and the smoaking flax shall he not quench, until he send forth judgment unto victory!"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="019154_0011_0FAA5DEBE769DFD0"/>"And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known!

<P>"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee! When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt▪ neither shall the flame kindle upon thee! For I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of Israel thy Saviour!"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. xliii. 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>"I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins! Put me in remembrance! Let us plead together! Declare thou, that thou mayest be justified!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ib xliii. 25, 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>"O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me! I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions! Return unto me, for I have redeemed thee!"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ib. xliv. 21, 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth!"<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ib. xlv. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength! Even to him shall

men come, and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xlv. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Sing, O heavens, and be joyful O earth, and break forth into singing, O mountains! For the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy on the afflicted! But Zion said, the Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me! Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have com∣passion on the son of her womb? Yea, she may forget, yet I will not forget thee!"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. xlix. 13, 14, 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Who is among you that feareth the Lord; that obeyeth the voice of his servant; that walketh in darkness and hath no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ib. l. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place; and with him also, that is of a contrite and humble spirit; to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones!"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ib. lvii. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>"The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the

<P>"And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear!"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. lxv. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jer. viii. 22.</NOTE></P>

<P>"Submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you! Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you!"<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Jam. iv. 7, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="019154_0014_0FAA5DEED6BD51D0"/>"God will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able to bear; but with the temptation will make a way to escape!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Jesus, by the grace of God, tasted death, for every man."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>"This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ, who gave himself a ransom for all."<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>To name no other passages of sacred writ, which afford consolation to penitents, permit it to be asked, if persons guilty of crimes of the first magnitude, upon their repentance and faith in Christ, have not been received into the arms of divine compassion?</P>
<P>Wherefore then should you despair of ob∣taining divine mercy; seeing "Christ is able to save to the uttermost, even ALL who come to God through him?"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>SECONDLY: Read frequently, with seriousness and attention, the "holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">11 Tim. iii. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="019154_0015_0FAA5DEFB04B6740"/>Would you not esteem it a great priviledge, could you have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the Prophets; Christ and his Apostles personally, to admi∣nister to you instruction, and exhortation; counsel and consolation?</P>
<P>But, in the sacred writings, do they not ad∣dress you, and on every necessary subject?</P>
<P>Duly prize the favour of thus conversing with them▪ and daily commit to memory, some of their expressions, adapted to your situation.</P>
<P>Such conduct will cause your minds to be enriched with divine truths, which may be your "meditation all the day▪"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 27.</NOTE> and enable you successfully to repel the assaults of the foes to your redemption.</P>
<P>Our Lord opposed the temptations of Satan, by quotations from the inspired writings:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. iv.</NOTE> And "the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God," is esteemed by Saint Paul, a principal part of the Christian's armour, in his conflict with the powers of darkness.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>It may be of utility to read the scriptures, in order, and to note with a pen, such texts as are suited to your state; which, at any time, you may turn to with ease, to make the subjects of your reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="019154_0016_0FAA5DF0CF6F4B40"/>THIRDLY: Frequently approach the Al∣mighty by devotion, through the merits and mediation of the Son of his affection; who hath obtained for you this privilege, and in mercy promised, that "whatsoever you shall ask in his name, believing, you shall receive."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John. xiv. 13, 14. Matt. 21.22.</NOTE></P>
<P>How often and explicitly, is the duty of prayer enjoined on you by divine authority?</P>
<P>Are you not exhorted to "watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation;"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ib. xxvi. 41.</NOTE>—to "pray always and not to faint;"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 1.</NOTE>—to "pray without ceasing?"<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. v. 17.</NOTE>—And is it not declared that "God will be enquired of by you for all spiritual blessings?"<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxvi. 37.</NOTE></P>
<P>The advantages of prayer are many and great; particularly, by the due performance of this duty, your penitence for sin, faith in Christ, and love to God, will be increased; you will have clearer apprehensions of divine truths; your affections will be spiritualized, and you will be enabled to rise superior to those temptations by which you may be assaulted.</P>
<P>It hath been remarked, that those persons who have been distinguished for piety, have also been distinguished for their attention to devotion; the practice of which is absolutely necessary to your proficiency in grace.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="019154_0017_0FAA5DF0F828D0D8"/>With the pious Daniel, therefore, three times each day, in humble posture, address the throne of divine mercy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. vi. 10.</NOTE> And most frequently, by ejaculatory petitions, wherever you may be, or in what employment soever engaged▪ make known your requests to God, or express your gratitude for the divine favours you have re∣ceived. Such conduct will have a happy ten∣dency to preserve in you the spirit of devotion, and to cause you to "pray without ceasing."</P>
<P>Let your prayers be offered up to the divine Majesty with becoming faith, humility and sincerity; and also with an humble confi∣dence, that he "will not upbraid" you, for involuntary imperfections in the discharge of this service; but that he will "liberally give"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">James i. 5.</NOTE> such things as shall be for your advantage, and "regard the prayer of the destitute!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. cii. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>FOURTHLY: When you shall obtain conso∣lation, through Christ, commemorate his death and passion, in the manner he hath prescribed.</P>
<P>The Jewish passover was instituted to be a memorial of the divine goodness, in preserv∣ing the people of Israel from destruction, when
<PB N="19" REF="019154_0018_0FAA5DF1C7F4F108"/>
the angel of the Lord, smote, with death, "all the first born in the land of Egypt."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xii.</NOTE></P>
<P>This ordinance was typical of our delive∣rance from eternal death, "through the sprink∣ling of the blood of Christ,"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 2.</NOTE> and was ho∣noured by him until he ordained, in its place, a new Paschal Supper, on the evening imme∣diately preceding his passion.</P>
<P>At that period, "he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto his A∣postles, saying, This is my body which is given for you! This do in remembrance of me! Likewise also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood, which I shed for you!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 19, 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was intended, by our celebration of this sacrament, that with sensations of gratitude, we should "shew forth our Lord's death, until his coming again."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>As this service is explicitly enjoined on us,— "This do in remembrance of me;"—as it is in itself most reasonable, and is attended with great advantages to ourselves; to neglect it therefore, is to sin, not only against God, but also against our own souls!</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="019154_0019_0FAA5DF280382AE8"/>FIFTHLY: Embrace each opportunity of hearing the divine word preached.</P>
<P>Should the preacher, at any time, happen to be of a denomination different from that by which you are distinguished, hear him without prejudice, and with a desire to receive edifica∣tion from what he may deliver.</P>
<P>Remember that truth is truth, by whomso∣ever it is spoken; and that the preaching of <HI>no person whatever</HI> should be regarded by you, <HI>any farther</HI> than it is <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>sacred oracles.</HI></P>
<P>Some persons, that they may receive the greatest advantage from the sermons they hear, make a practice of reducing their texts, and also the substance of the discourses, to writing; and it must be granted that such conduct may be particularly beneficial, and render sermons more permanently useful.</P>
<P>SIXTHLY: Avoid bigotry and a spirit of re∣ligious disputation The former is reproachful to Christianity, and is often productive of bad consequences: and the latter, it is conceived, is attended with many more evil, than good effects. It is frequently subversive of the spirit of the gospel, and occasions, in men, wrath, hatred, pride, and other sinful passions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the first age of the gospel, when its professors were seriously concerned to obtain salvation, they possessed the greatest affection for each other; they being, we are in∣formed, "of one heart, and of one mind."</P>
<P>But when the professors of Christianity began to be desti∣tute of its spirit, they divided into sects and parties; en∣tertained hatred and prejudice against one another, merely by reason they disagreed in religious sentiments; and often for a particular so immaterial as this, deprived each other of many earthly blessings, and even of life itself! And, perhaps, with much greater zeal, than they executed justice on persons guilty of the most flagrant acts of wickedness!</P>
<P>The sacred writings give no countenance to religious prejudice, enmity, animosity and contention, but the re∣verse. "Judge not," says our Lord, "that ye be not judged." Matt. vii. 1.</P>
<P>Before the Apostles had received the gift of the Holy Ghost, and, consequently, while unacquainted with the spirit of the gospel, they "saw one casting out devils in the name of Christ," and took upon them to "forbid him; because he followed not with them." But their conduct, in this instance, was disapproved of by their divine Master. Mark ix. 38.</P>
<P>"Him that is weak in the saith," saith Saint Paul, "receive ye," (in affection) "but not to doubtful dis∣putation."</P>
<P>He adds: "Who art thou that judgest another man's ser∣vant? To his own master he standeth or falleth."—"Why dost thou judge thy brother? Or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judg∣ment seat of Christ." "Every one of us shall give an ac∣count of himself to God. Let us not, therefore, judge one another any more." Rom. xiv.</P>
<P>Happy would it be, if Christians in general, were as soli∣citous to excel in piety, as apparently they are, in ortho∣doxy of faith!—Is it not to be feared, there are many that are <HI>heretical</HI> in their <HI>practice,</HI> who <HI>pride themselves</HI> in the <HI>truth</HI> of their <HI>principles?</HI></P>
<P>Uncharitable it would be, not to admit there are <HI>some,</HI> of every denomination of Christians, who obtain salvation. And if CHRIST <HI>himself</HI> receives into his kingdom, <HI>those</HI> who differ from us in religious opinion and mode of wor∣ship, why should not WE receive <HI>such</HI> into the arms of affection?</P>
<P>If, in a short period, <HI>one heaven,</HI> will receive all the saints on earth, wherefore should they not endeavour to be as affectionate to each other <HI>here,</HI> as they will be <HI>hereafter?</HI></P>
<P>And can Christians, with equal modesty and certainty, so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> regard any thing to be the <HI>test</HI> of <HI>error,</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> as a <HI>life</HI> of <HI>impiety?</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<P>By such proceedings you may obtain a knowledge of the truth, and without being offended, or giving offence to any.</P>

namely, whether you are reconciled to God, through Christ, and qualified for celestial en∣joyments?</P>
<P>SEVENTHLY: Frequently assemble together, as many of you at a place as shall be conve∣nient, for the purpose of social worship, and spiritual edification: this practice hath been of utility to many, and cannot, with reason, be objected against.</P>
<P>And avail yourselves, as much as possible, of the holy instruction and discourse of such professors of Christianity, as are experienced in grace. Disclose your troubles to them; they will, it is imagined, rejoice to do you every good office in their power, and, through divine favour, they may render you very es∣sential service.</P>
<P>EIGHTHLY: Be extremely careful that you do not suppress the motions of the divine spirit;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. v. 19.</NOTE> but, with servency, pray for its sa∣cred influences: and to this you are excited by our Saviour himself. "If ye;" says he, "being evil know how to give good gifts un∣to your children; how much more shall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 13.</NOTE></P>

<P>NINTHLY: Should you be reproached for your laudable efforts to "turn from the wickedness which you have committed," and to become Christians, indeed, this is no more than what many others, in every age of the church, have experienced.</P>
<P>Let not the ill language, nor opprobious epithets, of the unrighteous, render you un∣happy; but rather occasion you to "rejoice and be exceeding glad;" because "great will be your reward in heaven," if "men

<P>When you reflect how many there have been who have suffered the loss of every worldly good, and even life itself, for their christian virtue, how grateful should you be, if you shall endure only the language of reproach for doing your duty?</P>
<P>Let it be considered, that the unjust revil∣ings of persons of vice, is your honour and not disgrace! That such should be regarded by you as objects of pity, rather than of your displeasure! And that, very probably, they would be far from censuring you for acts of impiety!</P>
<P>TENTHLY: Should you meet with opposi∣tion in the path of virtue, from those who should be the most forward to countenance and assist you therein, bear this cross of afflic∣tion with patience and fortitude. Let mildness of deportment be yours; but suffer not your∣selves to be irreligious, and to disregard the offers of salvation, through complaisance or respect to men, nor for any earthly conside∣rations!

<P>And avoid every practice, that shall tend to banish thoughts of piety from your breast, es∣pecially conversation of folly or levity. This hath often been injurious to the spirit of religion.</P>

<P>As you profess to be enquiring, "What you shall do to be saved?" You are regarded with attention by angels and men, who wait to ob∣serve the issue of your conduct, whether salva∣tion, or the reverse, shall be your portion?</P>

<P>Remember, that your repentance for sin, must be unfeigned;—that your faith in Christ must be active; must "work by love;" occa∣sion you, sincerely and universally, from af∣fection, to revere all the divine commands;— and that you must be accepted of God through Christ; "not having your own righteous∣ness, which is of the law, but that which is through faith in him!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>Remember, that "unless you are born again you cannot see the kingdom of God;"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John iii. 3.</NOTE> that "you must put off, concerning your former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; that you must be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and put on the new man, which after God is cre∣ated in righteousness and true holiness!"<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 22, 23, 24.</NOTE></P>

<P>ABOUT three years since, the Author of the preceding Address, preached a Sermon, in Kingwood, in the State of New-Jersey, on the subject of Regeneration, which discourse was then printed.</P>
<P>Several persons, on whom, through divine goodness, it made serious and happy impres∣sions, requested the Author to compose a prayer, adapted to their situation, and to an∣nex it to the sermon.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>O THOU that art my Creator, preserver and benefactor! Against thee, O God! against thee have I sinned! With shame and sorrow, I acknowledge and deplore my manifold trans∣gressions, which render me most unworthy of thy favour, and justly expose me to thy indig∣nation and wrath!</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="019154_0039_0FAA5CCCA4BDBF18"/>But O thou who art a God of pity; that delightest not in the death of a sinner, but wouldest rather he should turn from his wick∣edness and live, look down, I humbly beseech thee; in condescensive goodness look down from thy throne of mercy, and behold me in compassion! Pardon, I intreat thee, my ini∣quities, through the merits of thy beloved Son! Through the purity of his blood, may I be cleansed from sinful defilement! Give peace to my troubled mind, and let me be∣come an object of thy affection!</P>
<P>Deliver me, O Lord! I pray thee, not only from the punishment due to sin, but also from its power and dominion! Let it no longer reign in my mortal body! No longer may I be in bondage to the Prince of Darkness! No longer may I even incline transgress thy holy law! Through the power of thy grace, may all evil be mortified and subdued in me! Through the efficacy of thy spirit, may my soul be regenerated; be renewed, and trans∣formed into thy likeness! May my mind be duly illuminated with the light of divine truth! May my affections be supremely fixed on thee, O God! who art most worthy of all love! And henceforth, may my life be intirely conformable to thy righteous will!</P>
<P>Though numerous foes may assault me in the path of salvation, yet, O Lord God of strength! through thy aid, may they be van∣quished!

May I be enabled to triumph over all opposition in the practice of religion; to go on from one degree of holiness to another, and, at length, arrive to the fulness of chris∣tian perfection!</P>
<P>Ever be pleased to indulge me, O Lord, I beseech thee! with the light of thy counten∣ance! At all times may I be favoured with the consolations and joys of thy holy spirit! And may I be preserved from every thing that shall be either offensive to thee; reproachful to christianity, or injurious to myself! Particu∣larly, from spiritual pride; from an uncharitable disposition, and a presumptuous confidence in my own ability to conflict with sin and Satan! As without thy assistance, O God! I cannot do any thing that is good, wilt thou, in mercy, incline and enable me successfully to approach thee in all thy holy ways, that from thee I may receive a supply of grace for all my spiritual wants! And prepare, O Lord! with ardour I implore thee; prepare my heart, in due season, to draw near, in an acceptable manner, to that holy sacrament, appointed by the merciful and divine Jesus, to be expressive of his death, un∣til he shall come again! In mercy grant, that the emblems of his holy passion, may be re∣ceived by me with the profoundest reverence; and with the most fervent gratitude, love and praise! That at this sacred banquet, each grace and virtue in me may be nourished, established,
<PB N="42" REF="019154_0041_0FAA5CD04666FA20"/>
and confirmed! And that a proper sense of the sufferings of thy beloved Son, for the atone∣ment of human guilt, may occasion me pro∣perly to perceive the demerits of sin, and cause me to flee it with the utmost detestation and abhorrence!</P>
<P>O Father of mercies, the God of love and of grace! What shall be rendered unto thee for thy inconceivably rich and unmerited cle∣mency, manifested to sinful men, through the Son of thy affection! How shall I sufficiently admire, adore, and praise thee, that I enjoy the glorious light of the gospel! That not∣withstanding all my sins, thou hast so long waited to be gracious to me! And that thou hast now inclined my soul to make my peace with thee, and to weep for my offences! O that my repentance may be such as shall need not to be repented of! That my faith in Christ may increase in strength! And that I may be thine, for ever thine!</P>
<P>Lord, humbly do I commit myself unto thee! To thee do I offer myself a sacrifice, both soul and body, which is my reasonable service! O that thou wouldest deign to accept of the unworthy offering! That thy arm of omnipotence may ever be extended for my safety! That, through thy goodness, I may escape the temptations of the world, the flesh and the devil, and at last enter into thy hea∣venly kingdom!</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="019154_0042_0FAA5CD21FB5F738"/>Grant it, O Lord! thou who hearest the petitions of humble suppliants; grant it with humility and fervency I pray, for the sake of the merits and mediation of the divine, com∣passionate Jesus; to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost, three Persons, but one God, be ascribed all honour and glory, adoration and praise, now, henceforth, and for ever!
