<HEAD>THE MODERN QUAKER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A comparative view of the</HI> PRIMITIVE <HI>and</HI> PRESENT <HI>state of the Society of</HI> FRIENDS, <HI>particularly addressed to the Youth. Written in</HI> ENGLAND <HI>by an Observer, and presented to</HI> FRIENDS' <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<L>THY daughters, Fox, in former days</L>
<L>When they deserv'd, contemn'd all praise,</L>
<L>But, with a self-approving mind,</L>
<L>No charms in human praise they find;</L>
<L>Yet let my muse their virtues trace,</L>
<L>And dwell with joy on ev'ry grace:</L>
<L>The lovely portrait hung on high,</L>
<L>Perhap's may strike some fair one's eye;</L>
<L>Its charms shall touch the <HI>modern</HI> dame,</L>
<L>And flush her cheek with conscious shame.</L>
<L>No costly robes, no broider'd hair,</L>
<L>No silks adorn'd the modest fair:</L>
<L>Distended hoops would shock the eye—</L>
<L>A naked breast would terrify!</L>
<L>They held that wanton, gay attire,</L>
<L>Was fuel for lascivious fire,</L>
<L>And valu'd more St. Paul's advice,</L>
<L>Which bade them seek the <HI>pearl of price.</HI></L>
<L>And why should dress, our parent's shame,</L>
<L>Their daughters breasts with pride inflame?</L>
<L>But tho' in simple robes array'd,</L>
<L>Behold what beauties grace the maid.</L>
<L>Upon her lip sits sacred truth,</L>
<L>Temp'rance gives the bloom of youth;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="046509_0002_10217A3FB4399930"/>
Within her breast dwells tranquil peace,</L>
<L>With modest blushes in her face;</L>
<L>Love sparkles in her dove-like eyes,</L>
<L>For innocence needs no disguise,</L>
<L>But prudence, on her brow enthron'd,</L>
<L>Commands respect from all around.</L>
<L>Fair Chastity her soul inspires,</L>
<L>And Charity's immortal fires;</L>
<L>Virtue within her spotless mind</L>
<L>Sits like a DEITY enshrin'd.</L>
<L>No vain romance, or wanton play,</L>
<L>Could waste a moment of the day,</L>
<L>But oft with deep, attentive thought,</L>
<L>They read the book with wisdom fraught.</L>
<L>They could employ their vacant hours,</L>
<L>Extracting health from herbs and flowers,</L>
<L>Which freely on the waters cast,</L>
<L>They doubt not will return at last.</L>
<L>But see them now in crowds repair,</L>
<L>To dwell within the house of pray'r.</L>
<L>Here no cold forms, no slavish rules,</L>
<L>(So oft the sacrifice of fools)</L>
<L>Confine the spark of heavenly flame,</L>
<L>That would ascend from whence it came.</L>
<L>Now every human care resign'd,</L>
<L>Deep silence fills th' adoring mind;</L>
<L>Patient they wait th' inspiring breath,</L>
<L>Which bade them rise from life to death;</L>
<L>That flame celestial, which inspires</L>
<L>The ardent soul with strong desires.</L>
<L>But vain my efforts to describe</L>
<L>The virtues of this chosen tribe:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="046509_0003_10217A42B4D25E90"/>
In their descendants can we trace</L>
<L>Such virtues, sanctity and grace?</L>
<L>Ye fair apostates! who so long</L>
<L>Have learn'd the Babylonish song,</L>
<L>When e'er you turn the sacred page,</L>
<L>Let Dinah's fate your thoughts engage;</L>
<L>None did assault the spotless maid,</L>
<L>Whilst in the Patriarch's tent she staid,</L>
<L>But when she quits the sacred fence,</L>
<L>She loses fame and innocence:</L>
<L>So you, while by sage rules confin'd,</L>
<L>Rules which by wisdom were design'd,</L>
<L>You shine as stars, with heavenly fire,</L>
<L>E'en I, a Gentile, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author did not belong to the profession of Friends.</NOTE>must admire;</L>
<L>But when beyond these bounds you stray,</L>
<L>Temptations thick lie in the way:</L>
<L>Beware, fair Nymphs! on glass you stand,</L>
<L>And Hamor's sons are near at hand.</L>
<L>Why is the bosom open laid—</L>
<L>Or veil'd beneath a cob-web shade?</L>
<L>Why doth the wanton eye impart</L>
<L>Its fire into another's heart?</L>
<L>Are hoops, ye fair backsliders! say,</L>
<L>Fit for the <HI>broad</HI> or <HI>narrow</HI> way?</L>
<L>Will a fair face, or graceful mien</L>
<L>Keep sickness off, or banish pain?</L>
<L>Will time's relentless weapon spare</L>
<L>The faultless shape, or braided hair?</L>
<L>In vain, my sisters, you conceal</L>
<L>What every motion must reveal;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="046509_0004_10217A45CDACFDE8"/>
Oh pardon then the friendly care,</L>
<L>That says you are not what you were.</L>
<L>Six days I pass, nor will I ask</L>
<L>How you in them perform'd your task;</L>
<L>But let your friend a tale relate,</L>
<L>Instruction may in trifles wait.</L>
<L>Chance lately led my wandering feet</L>
<L>Where all the friendly circle meet;</L>
<L>There no proud columns lifted high,</L>
<L>Nor sculptur'd dome attract the eye;</L>
<L>Fair decency, with solemn grace,</L>
<L>And frugal plainness marks the place.</L>
<L>"Here," said your friend, "is virtue's seat,</L>
<L>"And here the just assembly meet;</L>
<L>"Fair piety breathes all around,</L>
<L>"I tread, methinks, on holy ground!</L>
<L>"Here solemn prayer ascends the skies—</L>
<L>"A thousand wing'd petitions rise.</L>
<L>"Shall I presume to mix with these,</L>
<L>"Or dare to offer human praise?"</L>
<L>At Ramah Saul forgets his pride,</L>
<L>And lays his savage rage aside.</L>
<L>I enter'd—and with great surprize</L>
<L>Around I cast my wond'ring eyes!</L>
<L>"What can this mean!—each blooming maid</L>
<L>"In rich and gaudy robes array'd?</L>
<L>"What rainbow dies! what changing hue!</L>
<L>"What forms deck'd out in public view!"</L>
<L>The hair in graceful arches rose,</L>
<L>The sweeping train as graceful flows;</L>
<L>No lavish ornament's deny'd,</L>
<L>Can Sion's daughter's stoop to pride?</L>
<L>Where is the sweetly timmid air,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="046509_0005_10217A484D3B67C8"/>
The gentle movements of the fair?</L>
<L>The chaste reserve, the modest grace,</L>
<L>Charms which outshine the finest face?—</L>
<L>I find them not; but in their stead</L>
<L>Bold confidence erects her head.</L>
<L>Is this the solemn house of pray'r?</L>
<L>Is nought but solemn silence here?</L>
<L>I hear indeed a vocal sound,</L>
<L>Uneasy silence reigns around;</L>
<L>"Uneasy silence?"—yes I find</L>
<L>No signs of a collected mind;</L>
<L>And Charity herself might say,</L>
<L>Your thoughts are wand'ring far astray:</L>
<L>The seats of honor vacant lie,</L>
<L>Alas! will none assume so high!</L>
<L>Oh Pennington, bright son of fame!</L>
<L>And Fox, thou great unrival'd name!</L>
<L>Thou Barclay! whose well-guarded page</L>
<L>Defies the critic's force and rage;</L>
<L>Unnumber'd worthies! sons of light,</L>
<L>Who stem'd the superstitious night</L>
<L>With rage divine—where are you fled?</L>
<L>Ah! number'd with the silent dead!</L>
<L>If earth's low cares can now engage,</L>
<L>Oh look to this luxurious age;</L>
<L>What prisons, racks, and death obtain'd,</L>
<L>By your degenerate race disdain'd.</L>
<L>Yet such there are, and but a few,</L>
<L>Who tread the paths prescrib'd by you.</L>
<L>Many have fall'n, but yet not all,</L>
<L>Some have not bow'd the knee to Baal;</L>
<L>Some like fix'd stars, divinely bright,</L>
<L>Shine through this intellectual night;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="046509_0006_10217A49D1F35A28"/>
And chief of these MARIA thou—</L>
<L>Ye giddy fair in homage bow</L>
<L>To that chaste name, or let it fire</L>
<L>Your frozen breasts with strong desire;</L>
<L>Your thoughts and hearts let it enflame,</L>
<L>To imitate the matchless dame;</L>
<L>But thou, MARIA, shalt engage</L>
<L>The labors of a loftier page:</L>
<L>Ill would keen satire's muse agree</L>
<L>With meek-ey'd Charity and thee.</L>
<L>But you, ye modern dames, attend,</L>
<L>Regard the counsels of a friend,</L>
<L>And all religion's claim apart,</L>
<L>If man's esteem can touch your heart:</L>
<L>If from the Gentiles you expect</L>
<L>The tribute of sincere respect,</L>
<L>Would you from Esau's lineage prove</L>
<L>Sincere and undissembled love;</L>
<L>If this you seek, alike renounce</L>
<L>The hoop, the ruffle, and the flounce;</L>
<L>A little lower set the hair,</L>
<L>Forbid the practic'd eye to stare,</L>
<L>And lay the sweeping train aside,</L>
<L>With all the gaudy plumes of pride,</L>
<L>Which but too much would tire the muse,</L>
<L>Should she the copious subject choose.</L>
<L>Your native dignity resume,</L>
<L>Shun the rich labors of the loom;</L>
<L>Condemn the unavailing art</L>
<L>Which strikes the eye, but not the heart.</L>
<L>Do this my friends, but stop not here,</L>
<L>Something remains well worth your care.</L>
<L>The gems enclos'd in cells of clay</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="046509_0007_10217A4B54C17230"/>
Methinks beam but a feeble ray;</L>
<L>Its native lustre is obscur'd</L>
<L>In the dark cells of sin immur'd;</L>
<L>I see the clouds around it spread,</L>
<L>Dark ignorance here rears her head:</L>
<L>Unblushing confidence is here,</L>
<L>Presumption, pride, and foolish fear.</L>
<L>Here folly's bolt at random flies;</L>
<L>Pride, eagle-wing'd, attempts the skies;</L>
<L>And love I see, but not that love</L>
<L>Which boasts a sanction from above.</L>
<L>Say, is your monitor too bold,</L>
<L>Who deems it is the love of gold?</L>
<L>I see—But hold, presumptuous muse!</L>
<L>A subject less offensive choose;</L>
<L>No more unveil the female breast,</L>
<L>Let thy fair pupils find the rest;</L>
<L>But rather, if thou canst, display</L>
<L>A light to guide them on their way:</L>
<L>It's own'd by all the friendly band</L>
<L>A guide, unerring, is at hand;</L>
<L>A ray divine, whose sov'reign light</L>
<L>Can pierce the thickest shades of night;</L>
<L>A potent friend, forever near,</L>
<L>A "still small voice," which all can hear.</L>
<L>And oh! ye fair, in vain would I</L>
<L>The great, the solemn truth deny.</L>
<L>There is indeed a pow'r within,</L>
<L>That can both show, and shield from sin;</L>
<L>Its gentle dictates, if obey'd,</L>
<L>Will to the paths of safety lead:</L>
<L>And sure its aid is wanting here,</L>
<L>Oh! learn in time, prudential fair;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="046509_0008_10217A4CE1E11498"/>
Let folly at a distance play;</L>
<L>To shun temptation is the way.</L>
<L>Trust not too far in human strength,</L>
<L>The strongest may be foil'd at length.</L>
<L>The moth around the candle plays,</L>
<L>'Till drawn by its attracting blaze</L>
<L>Still near and nearer to the beam,</L>
<L>It sinks in the devouring flame.</L>
<L>An empty name no longer boast—</L>
<L>For ah! you bear that name at most:</L>
<L>Up to your high profession stand,</L>
<L>Or join the "daughters of the land."</L>
<L>If as you are, you will remain,</L>
<L>If satire is employ'd in vain,</L>
<L>At least forgive the friendly care</L>
<L>That tells you truly what you are.</L>
<L>A cake unturn'd is Ephraim now,</L>
<L>You in the house of Rimmon bow;</L>
<L>And some—I speak with grief and shame,</L>
<L>Some that were wash'd in Jordan's stream.</L>
<L>To Idol Gods shall Israel bow?</L>
<L>Like Laodicea, lukewarm grow?</L>
<L>And maids of Judah sacrifice,</L>
<L>With hearts impure, and wanton eyes?</L>
<L>To things forbidden, Saul aspire?</L>
<L>And Korah light unhallowed fire?</L>
<L>The Ark is taken!—Palestine</L>
<L>Exulting cries, "the day is mine!"</L>
