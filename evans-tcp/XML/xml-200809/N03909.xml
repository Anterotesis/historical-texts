<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I accidentally heard, the <HI>Sunday</HI> Even∣ing that they were at my House, that a Person who had the Appearance of a Gentleman, was hurried in a violent Man∣ner over <HI>College Green,</HI> and that a Gentleman who was con∣cerned in hurrying the Person away, answered the Disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip∣tion of Capt. <HI>Goodere</HI>; and knowing his Ship was to sail the first fair Wind, and remembring that they went out of my House near together, it came directly into my Head, that the Captain had taken him on board, to distress him to concede to his Terms, and perhaps might destroy him, when they came on the high Seas. And this Suspicion being strengthned by other Circumstances, it made such a deep Impression on my Mind, that I was not easy all Night; but considering how long it would be before I could obtain his Majesty's Writ, <HI>De homine replegiando,</HI> I went the next Morn∣ing to Mr Mayor, for a Warrant, and an Officer to go on board the <HI>Ruby</HI> Man of War, to search her before she was sail'd out of the Liberty of the City; and accordingly his Worship sent the Water-Bailiff, with proper Assistance, and full Power and Instructions to search the Ship for Sir <HI>John Dinely.</HI></P>

<P>My Lord, I was passing along <HI>College Green,</HI> and I saw six Men hurrying the Deceased along towards the Hot Well, when the Deceased, as he was carried along, cried out, <HI>Murder! Murder! I am Sir</HI> John Dinely Goodere, and the Prisoner stopp'd his Mouth with his Cloak; upon which some People, who did not know his Name, asked what was the Matter, when Mr. <HI>Goodere,</HI> the Prisoner at the Bar, said, it was only a Thief and a Deserter, and that they were
<PB REF="004809_0004_100DF41D4CB29C40"/>
going to carry him on board the King's Ship to try him. And, my Lord, not knowing what might be the Consequence of interposing in Matters of this Nature, having lately seen the sad Effects of opposing the Authority of a Press-Gang, I went home and thought no more of the Matter, till the <HI>Monday</HI> Night, when there was a Report of the Murder; and therefore next Day, I went before the Worshipful Mayor, and Aldermen, and discovered what I knew of this Transaction, in the same Manner as I have to your Lordship.</P>

<P>My Lord.

mad, and that he was brought on board on Purpose to prevent his making himself away;</HI> and after Sir <HI>John</HI> came on board, he was conducted into the Cabin; and as it was my Duty to obey the Command of my Superiors, so I thought it would be imprudent in me to interpose in any D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fference between the Captain and his Brother; otherwise I would have exerted myself, to have prevented the sad Effects, which afterwards happend.</P>

<P>I was one of the six Men, hired by Capt. <HI>Goodere,</HI> the Prisoner at the Bar, to seize the Deceased, and forcibly to run him aboard the <HI>Ruby</HI> Man of War, then lying in <HI>King Road.</HI> We met, by the Prisoner's Directions, at the <HI>White-Hart</HI> on <HI>College Green,</HI> where we had a hand∣some Dinner, and we were plac'd in the Balcony that we might be ready to receive the Signal and obey the Word of Command, without giving the least Suspicion to the People of the House.

When he was in, the Captain call'd for his Steward, and told him to bring a Bottle of Rum and a Glass: The Captain ask'd Sir <HI>John, How he did?</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI> complain'd of Pains, especially in his Thigh: The Captain ask'd him, <HI>If he would drink a Dram?</HI> Sir <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hn</HI> said, <HI>He had drank nothing but Water these two Years,</HI> The Cap∣tain

then ask'd him, <HI>If he would have any Rum to bathe his Thigh?</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI> answer'd <HI>No:</HI> Then the Captain order'd a Dram for <HI>Mohony</HI> and <HI>Elisha Cole</HI> (who was the Person at first design'd to have done the Murder, but that he was drunk:) After they had a Dram, they all came out of the Cabin. Then <HI>Cole</HI> desir'd Leave to speak to the Gentleman (Sir <HI>John</HI>) thinking he was the Captain of the Ship he was pressed out of: <HI>Cole</HI> went in, and told Sir <HI>John, he did his Duty on board the</HI> Charles <HI>as well as another Man,</HI> and swore he would have his Wages: Sir John told him, <HI>He did not know him, nor any thing of the</HI> Charles: On which he again swore, he would have his Wages before he went out of the Ship; for that if he was not the <HI>Captain,</HI> he was the <HI>Owner.</HI> Shortly after <HI>Cole</HI> went out; when the Captain call'd one of the Carpenter's to put <HI>two strong Bolts on the Purser's Cabin Door</HI>; which was accordingly done. About this Time Sir John ask'd, If he could speak with any one of the Officers on board: The Carpenter made Answer, <HI>I am the Carpenter</HI>: Sir <HI>John</HI> ask'd if he could speak a Word with him? He reply'd, <HI>a Hundred if he pleased.</HI> Then the Carpenter ope∣ning the Door, in order to clench the Staples, Sir <HI>John</HI> ask'd him, <HI>What his Brother</HI> Sam. <HI>was going to do with him? What, is he going to murder me?</HI> The Carpenter reply'd <HI>No, He is willing to have your Company, Sir; he does it for your Good:</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI> said, <HI>But what will become of all my Servants and Estate all this Time?</HI> On this the Carpenter retir'd: And presently after the Captain came down again, and order'd the Doctor's first Mate to go to <HI>feel his Pulse,</HI> saying, <HI>We must patch him up as well as we can, he is a crazy old Man: Go, in,</HI> says he, <HI>and feel his Pulse</HI>: Accordingly the Docter went in, and when he came to Sir <HI>John,</HI> he asked him, Where his Pains were? He answer'd, <HI>He lately came from</HI> Bath, <HI>and had a Pain in his Head;</HI> and complain'd of many other Pains, occasion'd by the rough Usage in bringing him on board. Says the Captain, <HI>Doctor, feel his Pulse, and com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out:</HI> So accordingly the Doctor came out, and the Cabi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Door was shut. After this, I heard him <HI>begging and prayi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for God to be comfortable to him in his Affliction, for that he be∣lieved

he was going to he murder'd; and hop'd it would be brought to Light, for that it was impossible it could be done without some∣body hearing or seeing it.</HI> About Nine at Night I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> him knocking and calling out <HI>Ho! Ho! Brother Sailors I have almost forgot my Sea Terms, let me have a Bucket to Piss in, and ease myself, for it will be a Shame to do it in the Cabin.</HI> Upon this I look'd out at the Cabin Door, and call'd out to the Centry to get something for the Gentleman to ease himself in: And presently afterwards <HI>Mahony</HI> came with a Bucket; when Sir <HI>John</HI> told him of his Exploits, and that he had been Captain of an <HI>India Man,</HI> &amp;c. About Two or Three in the Morning my Wife waked me: And I heard a vast Struggling at first, and the old Gentleman to cry, <HI>Twenty Guineas! Take it! Take it! Must I die! Must I die!</HI> And very soon after, all was quiet. Then a Candle was handed into the Cabin: And I saw, thro' the Crevace of the Partition, <HI>Mahony</HI> holding the Candle in his Hand, and <HI>White</HI> plunder'd his Pockets, turning his Body in order to come at it, and took out of his Pocket his Watch and Money. But <HI>White</HI> not getting the Watch out of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Pocket easily, <HI>Mahony</HI> said to him, <HI>D—n it, lay hold of the Chain:</HI> It was some Time before they could get the Watch out of his Pocket, being forced at last to unbutton his Breeches. <HI>White</HI> put his Hand into one Pocket, and found nothing but Silver, &amp; putting his Hand into the other, said, <HI>Here it is:</HI> Then he put his Hand in another Pocket, and found a Piece of Paper, which he was going to read; but <HI>Mahony</HI> damn'd him, and bid him put it in his Pocket, and not stand to read it now. In about a Minute after, I saw a <HI>white Hand</HI> on the Throat of the Deceased, which I took to be the Captain's Presently they all went out of the Cabin, and left the Deceased alone Then I went to the Doctor's Mate and the Centry; and, by their Opinion, they took: the Gentleman to be dead: Then I went to the Lieu∣tenant and told him what I had <HI>heard</HI> and <HI>seen,</HI> and that <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White</HI> had murdered the Gentleman, and that I believed the Captain was concern'd. The Lieutenant was very dubious of the Truth at first, telling me, he did not
<PB N="12" REF="004809_0012_100DF42EF6268898"/>
think the Captain would be guilty of any such Thing; but, on my giving him such plain Demonstrations of the Thing, he began to think there was something in it. While they were talking, the Midshipman came to acquaint the Lieu∣tenant, that the Captain had order'd <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Mahony</HI> ashore: He swore they should not go ashore, for that they were the two Persons that had kill'd the Gentleman; but the Midshipman returning to the Captain, he order'd they should be put ashore immediately; and accordingly they were. About Nine or Ten in the Morning, the Lieutenant and Gunner contrived a Method, that I should go in and complain I had lost six Guineas out of my Chest: Accord∣ingly going with this Complaint, I seiz'd the Captain as he was walking with his Hands behind him: And the rest who were at Hand rush'd in after me. Upon the Captain's being thus seiz'd, he cry'd out, <HI>Hay! Hay! what have I done! what have I done!</HI> I reply'd, <HI>Sir, you are my Prisoner▪ you was the Cause of your Brother's Death last Night.</HI> The C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ain said, <HI>If there is Murder done in the Ship, I know nothing of it:</HI> Accordingly he was secured, and the Barge order'd out for Four of the Crew to pursue <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Maho∣ny.</HI> They took <HI>White</HI> at the <HI>Bell</HI> in <HI>Marsh-street,</HI> swearing and damning his Mother for sending him so much Money; he was very much in Liquor, but was soon conquer'd &amp; bro't before a Magistrate; when he was so drunk, that his Con∣fession was not taken till next Morning. About Twelve at Night they took <HI>Mahony</HI> at a private House opposite the <HI>Ship</HI> on St <HI>Michael's-Hill-Steps,</HI> and convey'd him before a Magistrate, and when he was sober he also made his Con∣fession of the Murder.</P>

Replies <HI>Mahony, No, Sir:</HI> Then, says Sir <HI>John, I desire to speak with the Carpenter:</HI> On this <HI>Ma∣hony</HI> went out of the Cabin, but neglected to acquaint the Carpenter of it; so that Sir <HI>John</HI> call'd the Carpenter him∣self, and ask'd him, if he pleas'd to hear him speak one Word?

I suppose my Brother tells you I am a Madman; but I am not, tho' he is enough to drive me mad:</HI> On which the Carpenter went out: About Ten o'Clock the Captain came down again with a Pair of Stockings in his Hand, and ask'd his Brother if he would put them on? Sir <HI>John</HI> told him, No; he would bid as he was: At this Time Sir <HI>John</HI> did not talk much, but told his Brother, <HI>He would rot in a Jail</HI>: On this the Captain bid <HI>Mahony</HI> see if he had any Knife about him; When Sir <HI>John</HI> took a little Knife out of his Pocket, and gave it to <HI>Mahony,</HI> and went and laid himself upon the Bed directly: Then the Captain went out, saying to his Brother, He would go and see for some Sheets for him; and as the Cap∣tain went out, he spoke aloud, and charg'd (I suppose the Centry) that no one should come near him; <HI>for that by and- by he'd kick and tear, and make a Noise, as tho' he would tear the Cabin down; for that he was a Madman:</HI> Then the Cap∣tain went out and sat in the Doctor's Birth, saying to Mr. <HI>Marsh</HI> the Midshipman, <HI>You must go ashore in the Morning between three and four o'Clock,</HI> and also order'd him to go to the Post-Office for the Letters: That if any Body made Enquiry about the <HI>Old mad Fellow,</HI> he should tell them, <HI>That he had brought him on board to prevent his rotting in Jail: In short,</HI> (continued he) <HI>the World has blamed me, that I have not done it before:</HI> About Twelve, Sir <HI>John</HI> asked <HI>Mahony</HI> for the Knife; <HI>for what does my Brother think I am going to make away with my self? God forbid, the World is wicked enough to do that</HI>: Telling <HI>Mahony</HI> it was his Son's Knife that was dead; and that he would have it again. And after he had talked to him some Time, he bid him go out, for that he could bide by himself: <HI>Mahony</HI> said to him; <HI>Sir, I must bide and take Care of you,</HI> and immediately put the Candle out: Sir <HI>John</HI> still kept talking with <HI>Mahony,</HI> praying to God to give him Patience; and <HI>Mahony</HI> told him, he must have Patience; Sir <HI>John</HI> reply'd, sighing, <HI>I had as good.</HI> Still Sir <HI>John</HI> kept on talking to <HI>Mahony▪</HI> telling him▪ If a great many Gentlemen of <HI>Bristol</HI> did but know how he was used, they would fetch him from thence: Then <HI>Mahony</HI> told him, that

<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 13. 1740, the Captain ordered the Barge and Yawl up, (in each of which was a Midship∣man) and ordered a Midshipman and six of the Bargemen to go to the Sign of the <HI>White-Hart,</HI> the Foot of the <HI>College-Green:</HI> When we came there I saw the Captain, <HI>Mahony,</HI> and five of the Privateer's Men, who were drinking hot Flip by themselves, while myself &amp; the five Bargemen were sitting in the publick Kitchen drinking of Ale: Shortly after, I saw Sir <HI>John</HI> come from Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s opposite the <HI>White-Hart,</HI> where his Man was waiting for him, with Pistols to each of their Horses: Then the five Privateer's Men seeing him, they rush'd out together, and were for seizing Sir <HI>John</HI> then; but the Capt. ordered them not to touch him at that Time, but to follow him, and see which Way he went: Then they followed him round the Corner, and the Captain after them: But the Captain return'd to the <HI>White Hart</HI> again in about an Hour, and ordered the Boat down.—</P>
<P>The <HI>Sunday</HI> following, the 18th of <HI>January,</HI> the same Gen∣tleman I saw on the Green, was brought on board the <HI>Ruby</HI>; and as he was bringing on board, the Captain bid the Peo∣ple <HI>mind not what he said, for that he was a Madman, and he
<PB N="16" REF="004809_0016_100DF438CDA0CCD0"/>
would bring him to his Senses by and by.</HI> I saw no more of him for this Time. But at 12 o'Clock I was call'd to go Centry over Sir <HI>John</HI> in the Cock-Pit at the Purser's Cabin-door; a little after 12, the Captain sent his Man for me: I gave the Centry at the Gun-Room Charge, that no Body should come down the Ladder till I had spoke with the Captain: When I went into the Captain's Cabin, I saw the Captain and <HI>Mahony</HI> with a Bottle of Rum and Glass before them, out of which I had a Dram. Then the Captain ask'd me, <HI>If his Brother made any Noise?</HI> On which I told him, that he made a little Moan for the Time that I was there. The Captain reply'd, <HI>I know the Reason of that, he is wet, he wants to be shifted; I will come down and shift him with dry Stockings presently:</HI> When I went out, the Captain told me to let no body into the Purser's Cabin to Sir <HI>John,</HI> but <HI>Mahony.</HI>—Says <HI>Mahony, You may let another go in because</HI>— here he went no further. About Two the Captain came down to the Cock Pit, and ask'd me, if his Brother made any Noise? and listned himself at the Cabin Door, to hear if he made any Noise.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John</HI> made a little Moan: And the Captain said to me, <HI>Centry, give me the Sword, and you go upon Deck, because I want to talk to my Brother privately by himself:</HI> Accordingly I gave him the Sword, and went up into the Gun Room, and there walk'd: A little after, down came <HI>Mahony,</HI> and the Centry ask'd where he was going? He said, <HI>D—n you, you Dog, what is that to you? D — n you, how busy you make yourself!</HI> Then <HI>Mahony</HI> went down (where the Captain wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> standing with a drawn Sword in his Hand) into the Cock-Pit, and so into the Purser's Cabin, where Sir <HI>John</HI> was lying: A little after I heard Sir <HI>John</HI> mutter out, <HI>Mur∣der:</HI> And then every Thing was quiet for a little while; and the Captain took the Lanthorn that was hanging up, and gave it into the Cabin himself: Then seeing the Candle given it into the Cabin, I thought it not proper for the Cap∣tain to stand without a Light; and therefore I lighted a Candle at the Gun Room, and was going down into the Cock-Pit, where the Captain was standing with a Sword in
<PB N="17" REF="004809_0017_100DF43BD3E27440"/>
his Hand; at my Approach the Captain held his Sword to my Breast, and told me to keep back, saying, <HI>Stay where you are:</HI> Accordingly I went back, and walk'd for a small Space of Time in the Gun Room: The Captain came to the Foot of the Ladder with the Candle out and gave it to me, tel∣ling me to light it and come down: Accordingly I lighted the Candle and went down, when he gave me the Sword, and bid me take his Post, locking and bolting the Purser's Cabin-Door, putting the Key in his Pocket, (which before the Murder, was left in the Cabin-Door) telling me, <HI>If I heard his Brother make any more Noise, to send to him, and let him know of it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P><HI>William Mac. Gennis</HI> swore, That he saw the Captain stand at the Purser's Cabin Door at the Time of the Murder, with a drawn Sword in his Hand; and that when he offer'd to draw near him, the Captain held up his Sword, and bid him keep back.</P>
<P>The Captain in his Defence pleaded the utmost Innocence; alledging, That could it be thought he could be guilty of the Murder of his Brother Sir <HI>John,</HI> whereas, by his Death, he lost at least 40,000 l? That the Sickness and Disorder in the House, debarr'd him of his Lawyers and Friends con∣versing with him: That he apply'd to the Captain of the <HI>Ruby</HI> as soon as he was allow'd Pen, Ink, and Paper, for Evidences on Ship-board (which were Lieutenant <HI>Perry,</HI> the Doctor, Mr. <HI>Robert Haythorn,</HI> Mr. <HI>Richard Wilson,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hugh Driscal:</HI>) That he had applied to the Lords of the Admiralty, who sent him an Order, but the said Ship sail'd the Day before it arriv'd; which debarr'd him of justifying himself, they being material Evidences: — In Vindication of his causing Sir <HI>John</HI> to be seized in the Manner he was, he urg'd, That he was a Lunatick, and therefore, he did it to take care of him: That his being taken in the Day-time on board, was plain, there was no secret Design, or that he was to have any Harm come to him: And that even when he parted with him at Mr <HI>Smith's,</HI> he behav'd in a very mad Manner and took no Leave.—That the People on board knew of his coming a Week before he came; there∣fore
<PB N="18" REF="004809_0018_100DF43D5DF7E000"/>
he intimated that he must be very silly to bring a Per∣son to 300 Evidences to commit a vile Act, where nothing can be a secret above 4 Hours. The Persons Mr. <HI>Goodere</HI> brought to prove Sir <HI>John</HI> a Lunatick were two young Wo∣men, one of whom believed him to be a Lunatick, or mad, because he would get up in the Middle of the Night, and disturb all the Servants; that sometimes he would busy himself in <HI>hanging on the Pot,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Another Person was called to prove Sir <HI>John</HI> had made his Will several Months before, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And being ask'd con∣cerning the Disposition of Sir <HI>John,</HI> he reply'd, That he was a good Friend, a loving Neighbour, and a kind Land∣lord; that he was so far from being a Lunatick, as to be capable to negociate his own Affairs with his Tenants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Another Gentleman was call'd by Mr. <HI>Goodere,</HI> to his Character; but being ask'd whether he knew Sir <HI>John</HI> to be any Ways mad, or the like? He declar'd, That he was so far from being a Lunatick, that he had more Sense than all the whole Family. Sir John was also prov'd by Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to be in his perfect Senses when he left his House.</P>
<P>The Evidence for the King, being clear and full, after a Trial of nine Hours, the Jury brought in their Verdict, Guilty, against the Captain and <HI>Mahony,</HI> in less than 15 Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Charles White</HI> was tried the next Day for the said Mur∣der, and for robbing Sir <HI>John</HI> of 8 Guineas and a Gold Watch, and was found Guilty on both Indictments; and the Day after, they all three receiv'd Sentence of Death.</P>

And this Examinant answered him, That <HI>he never did;</HI> upon which the Captain told him, he had got a Job for him to do, if he would undertake it; and this Exami∣nant asked him, What Job it was? And the Capt. told him, 'twas <HI>to make away with his Brother,</HI> whose Name (as this Examinant is inform'd) was Sir <HI>John Dinely Goodere,</HI> Bart. who was in the Purser's Cabin on board the said Ship: And the said <HI>Matthew Mahony</HI> told this Examinant, that he must go with him to help do it; whereupon the said Captain went out of the Cabin first, <HI>Mahony</HI> followed him, and this Examinant went next; and when he came to the Purser's Cabin Door, where Sir <HI>John Dinely</HI> was, the Cap∣tain was standing Centinel himself at the Door with a Cut∣lass in his Hand, and <HI>Mahony</HI> had enter'd the Cabin, and this Examinant enter'd likewise, where <HI>Mahony</HI> was talking with the said Sir <HI>John,</HI> and had a Piece of Rope, called three Quarter of an Inch Rope, in his Hand, about six Foot in Length; and Sir <HI>John,</HI> was lying on the Bed: and particularly <HI>Mahony</HI> ask'd Sir <HI>John,</HI> how his Head was, and what he had got about it? and at last told him, it did not signify talking about it any longer; and then fell on him on the Bed, took hold of his Throat with his Hand (his Stock being on) and so strangled him with his Stock, and afterwards put the said Rope about his Neck (which was prepared for the Purpose, with a Noose in it, before it was brought out of the Captain's Cabin) And then <HI>Mahony</HI> hawl'd the Rope tight about his Neck And upon this Exami∣nant asking him, what he did that for? He said, <HI>for fear he should not be dead enough:</HI> And this Examinant took a Knife out of his Pocket and cut it off his Neck, and threw if over∣board;

during all which Time the Captain stood Centinel at the Door, as aforesaid; and as soon as this Examinant had so cut the Rope off, the Captain handed a Candle to <HI>Mahony,</HI> who gave it to him, and <HI>Mahony</HI> took the Watch and Money out of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Pockets; and then the Cap∣tain asked them, <HI>Have ye done?</HI> Meaning (as this Informant apprehended) murdered the said Sir <HI>John,</HI> and then came in himself; and this Examinant went thro' the Hold, and came upon Deck, where he walk'd for about the Space of half a Quarter of an Hour, and the Captain and <HI>Mahony</HI> went into the Captain's Cabin together, and then this Ex∣aminant went into the Steerage, and <HI>Mahony</HI> called this Ex∣aminant into the Cabin, where the Captain had undress'd himself in order to go to Bed, and there the Captain gave him <HI>five Guineas;</HI> and this Examinant had receiv'd of the said Captain a six and thirty Shilling Piece of Gold before the said Sir <HI>John</HI> was murdered: And further this Exami∣nant saith, That <HI>Mahony</HI> shew'd the Captain the Watch he had taken out of Sir <HI>John's</HI> Pocket, and the Captain gave <HI>Mahony</HI> his own Watch, and kept Sir <HI>John's</HI> himself; and <HI>Mahony</HI> likewise shew'd the Captain the Money he had taken out of Sir <HI>John's</HI> Pocket, who bid him keep it, and <HI>Mahony</HI> gave it to this Examinant, who put it into his Pocket; and he and <HI>Mahony</HI> shared the Money on the Fore∣castle, and this Examinant had two Pieces to one, in Con∣sideration that <HI>Mahony</HI> had the Watch; and this Examinant believes they shared about 30 Pounds between them; and further this Examinant saith, That the said Captain told him and <HI>Mahony,</HI> that they might go any where for three Weeks, and he would send them their Tickets; and lastly, this Examinant sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, That between four and five o'Clock the same Morning the Man of War's Yawl was going to this City, and he and <HI>Mahony</HI> landed at the Gibb here.</P>

<P>THIS Day, between 11 and 12 in the Forenoon, Capt. <HI>Samuel Goodere, Matthew Mahony,</HI> and <HI>Charles White,</HI> were executed here, on St. <HI>Michael's Hill</HI> Gallows. The Captain did not deny his being concern'd with <HI>Mahony</HI> and <HI>White,</HI> but said he never design'd to murder his Brother till about 2 a Clock in the Morning that it was perpetrated. His Wife and Child took Leave of him on <HI>Monday,</HI> under the greatest Affliction imaginable. He was convey'd to the Place of Execution in a Mourning Coach, attended by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Penrose</HI>; and the 2 others in a Carr, with Halters about their Necks. The Captain could not shed a Tear, to the last; neither did <HI>Mahony</HI> or <HI>White;</HI> but look'd seemingly not under that Concern as, could be expected. Only <HI>White</HI> spoke to the People, and desired 'em to take Warning by him, not to be drawn into a Snare as he had been; for that he was insnar'd out of his Life thro' the Intrigues of the Captain; and when the Executioner was about to fasten the Halters to the Gallows, <HI>White</HI> fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the End of his over himself. They all kiss'd each other, and the Captain dropping his Handkerchief as a Signal, the Cart drew away. Their Bodies were all brought back to <HI>New∣gate</HI>; the Captain's was carry'd away the next Day, to be bury'd among his Relations in <HI>Worcestershire; Mahony</HI> was hang'd in Chains at the River's Mouth; <HI>White</HI> was got into the Surgeon's Clutches, but after demanded by the Sheriffs, and buried.</P>
<P>Three of the Ruffians who seiz'd Sir <HI>John Dinely,</HI> were each of them sentenced to pay a Fine of 40 <HI>s.</HI> to suffer 12 Months Imprisonment, and to find Securities for their good Behaviour for 12 Months more.</P>
