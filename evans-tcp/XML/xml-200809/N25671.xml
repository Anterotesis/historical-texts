<HEAD>THE WAY TO MAKE MONEY PLENTY IN EVERY MAN's POCKET.</HEAD>
<P>AT this time, when the general complaint is that—"Money is scarce," it will be an act of kindness to inform the moneyless how they may reinforce their pockets. I will acquaint them with the true secret
<PB N="5" REF="034092_0004_0FFA58C16B35A158"/>
of money-catching—the certain way to fill empty pur∣ses—and how to keep them always full. Two simple rules-well observed, will do the business.</P>
<P>First, let honesty and industry be thy constant com∣panions; and,</P>
<P>Secondly, spend one penny less than thy clear gains.</P>
<P>Then shall thy hide bound pocket soon begin to thrive, and will never again cry with the empty belly∣ache: neither will creditors insult thee, nor want op∣press, nor hunger bite, nor nakedness freeze thee.</P>
<P>The whole hemisphere will shine brighter, and plea∣sure spring up in every corner of thy heart. Now therefore, embrace these rules and be happy. Banish the bleak winds of sorrow from thy mind, and live in∣dependant. Then shalt thou be a man, and not hide thy face at the approach of the rich, nor suffer the pain of feeling little when the sons of fortune walk at thy right hand: for indepednency, whether with little or much, is good fortune, and placeth thee on even ground with the proudest of the golden fleece. Oh then, be wise, and let industry walk with thee in the morning, and attend thee untill thou reachest the eve∣ning hour for rest. Let honesty be as the breath of thy soul, and never forget to have a penny when all thy expenses are enumerated and paid: then shalt thou
<PB N="6" REF="034092_0005_0FFA57B3A28641C0"/>
reach the point of happiness, and independance shall be thy shield and buckler, thy helmet and crown; then shall thy soul walk upright, nor stooop to the silken wretch because he hath riches, nor pocket an abuse because the hand which offers it wears a ring set with diamonds.</P>

<HEAD>THE WHISTLE. A TRUE STORY.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I was a child, at seven years old, my friends on a holiday filled my pockets with coppers, I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children; and being charmed with the sound of a whistle, that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I vol∣luntarily offered him all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family, my brothers and sisters, and cousins, under∣standing the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth. This put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of my money; and they laughed at me so much for my folly that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034092_0006_0FFA58CE4DB36688"/>
This however was afterwards of use to me, the im∣pressions continuing on my mind; so that often when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself don't give too much for the whistle; and so I saved my money.</P>
<P>As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whistle.</P>
<P>When I saw any one too ambitious of court favours, sacrifice his time in attendance on levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends to attain it, I have said to myself, this man gives too much for his whistle.</P>
<P>When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in political bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect: he pays indeed, says I, too much for his whistle.</P>
<P>If I knew a miser, who gave up every kind of com∣fortable living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of be∣nevolent friendship, for the sake of accumulating wealth: poor man says I, you do indeed pay too much for your whistle.</P>
<P>If I fee one fond of fine clothing, fine furniture, fine equipage, and above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in prison, alas, say I, he pays dear, very dear, for his whistle.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="034092_0007_0FFA57C529089F98"/>
When I see a beautiful, sweet tempered, girl married to an ill-natured brute of a husband: what a pity it is, says I, that she has paid so much for a whistle.</P>
<P>In short, I concieve, that great part of the miseries of mankind were brought upon them by the false esti∣mates they had made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whistle.</P>

<HEAD>LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>AUGUSTUS, a few moments before his death, asked his friends who stood about him, if they thought he had acted his part well; and upon reciev∣ing such answer as was due to his extraordinary mer∣it—Let me then, says he, go off the stage with your applause, using the expression with which the Roman actors made their exit at the conclusion of a dramatic piece.</P>
<P>I could wish that men, while they are in the health, would consider well the nature of the part they are en∣gaged in, and what figure it will make in the minds of those they leave behind them: whether it was worth coming into the world for; whether it be suitable to a reasonable being; in short, whether it appears grace∣ful in this life, or will turn to advantage in the next. Let the sycophant, or buffoon, the satirist,
<PB N="9" REF="034092_0008_0FFA5573A047F250"/>
or the good companion, consider with himself, when his body shall be laid in the grave: and his soul pass in∣to another state of existence, how much it would re∣dound to his praise to have it said of him, that no man in England eat better, that he had an admirable talent at turning his friends into ridicule, that no body out▪ did him at an-ill-natured jest, or that he never went to bed before he had dispatched his third bottle.</P>
<P>These are, however, very common funeral orations, and elogiums on deceased persons who have acted a∣mong mankind with some figure and reputation. But if we look into the bulk of our species, there are such as are not likely to be remembered a moment after their disappearance. They leave behind them no tra∣ces of their existence, but are forgotten as though they had never been. They are neither wanted by the poor, regretted by the rich, nor celebrated by the learned. They are neither missed in the common-wealth, nor la∣mented by private persons.</P>
<P>Their actions are of no significancy to mankind, and might have been performed by creatures of much less dignity than those who are distinguished by the fa∣culty of reason. An eminent French author speaks somewhere to the following purpose; I have often seen from my chamber-window two noble creatures, both of them of an erect countenance, and endowed with
<PB N="10" REF="034092_0009_0FFA57CE279A65B0"/>
reason.—These two intellectual beings are employed from morning to night, in rubbing two smooth stones one upon another; that is, as the vulgar phrase is, in polishing marble.</P>
<P>My friend, Sir Andrew Freeport, as we were sit∣ting in the club last night, gave us an account of a so∣ber citizen, who died a few days since. This honest man being of greater consequence in his own thoughts than in the eye of the world, had for some years past kept a journal of his life. Sir Andrew, showed us one week of it. Since the occurrences set down in it mark out such a road of action as that I have been speaking of, I shall present my readers with a faithful copy of it; after having first informed him, that the deceased person had in his youth been bred to trade, but finding himself not so well turned for business, he had for several years past lived altogether upon a mod∣erate annuity.</P>

I question not but the readers will be surprised to find the above-mentioned journalist taking so much care of a life that was filled with such inconsiderable actions, and received so very small improvements; and yet, if we look into the behavior of many whom we daily converse with, we shall find most of our hours are taken up in those three important articles of eating, drinking and sleeping.</P>
<P>I do not suppose that a man loses his time, who is not engaged in public affairs, or in an illustrious course of action. On the contrary, I believe our hours may very often be more profitably laid out in such transac∣tions as make no figure in the world, than in such as are apt to draw upon them the attention of mankind. One may become wiser and better by several methods of employing ones-self in secrecy and silence, and do what is laudable without noise or ostentation. I would, however, recommend to every one of my read∣ers, the keeping a journal of their lives for one week, and setting down punctually their whole series of em∣ployments during that space of time.</P>
<P>This kind of Self examination would give them a true state of themselves, and incline them to consider seriously what they are about.

<HEAD>SEVERAL RELATIONS touching the nature of those perpetual La<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps which have continued burning for many centuries together, &amp;c. (From the British Magazine.)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you have entertained your readers with several curious pieces, which refer to nature and art, I doubt not, but the subsequent passages of those perpetual lamps which have continued burning (in the sepulchres of the Ancients) for many centuries to∣gether, without any fresh supply, will prove acceptable.</P>
<P>All fire, but especially flame, says philosophers is of an active and stirring nature, and cannot possibly subsist without motion: Now there are several au∣thors who have treated of this subject by the by, tho' none, says the learned and judicious Bishop Wilkins, that have writ any thing to the purpose, (except the ingenious Fortunius Licetus) from whom we shall beg leave to borrow some undeniable proofs, which we hope will be suitable to our present enquiry.</P>
<P>First then that there hath been such lamps, St. Aus∣tin mentions one of them in a temple dedicated to Ve∣nus which was alway exposed to the open weather, and could never be extinguished; Pamyrollus mentions a lamp found in his time, in the sepulchre of Tulli<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Cicero's daughter, which had continued there for 1550 years, but was presently extinguished by the admis∣sion
<PB N="16" REF="034092_0015_0FFA57F7C4B95DA8"/>
of new air. And 'tis commonly reported of Ced∣renus, that in Justinian's time there was another burning lamp found in an old wall at Antioch; which had remained for above 500 years, there being a cru∣cifix placed by it; hence it appears, that they were in use with the primitive Christians.</P>
<P>But more especially remarkable is that of Olybius, which had continued burning for 1500 years: the re∣lation is this: "As a rustic was digging the ground by Padua, he found an urn, in which there was another urn, and in this a lesser, with a lamp clearly burning; on each side of it there were two other vessels, both of them full of a pure liquor the one of gold, the other of silver". Hence we may probably conjecture, that it was some chemical secret by which it was contrived. Baptista Porta, tells us of another lamp, burning in an old marble sepulchre belonging to some of the An∣cient Romans, enclosed in a glass vial, found in his time, about the year 1550, in the Isb Nisis which had been buried there before our Savior's incarnation.</P>
<P>In the tomb of Pallas the Areadian, who was slain by Turnus in the Trojan war, there was found another burning lamp.</P>
<P>In the year of our Lord 1401, whence it would seem that it had continued there for above 2600 years; and being taken out, it continued burning, not∣withstanding either wind or water, with which some
<PB N="17" REF="034092_0016_0FFA58FFC8D72730"/>
strove to quench it, nor could it be extinguished till they had spilt the liquor in it. Ludouicus Vives tells us of another lamp that continued burning for 1050 years, which was found a little before his time. There is another relation of a certain man, who, upon dig∣ing somewhat deep in the ground, met with some∣thing like a door, having a wall on each hand of it, from which he cleared the earth; he farved open the door, and there discovered a fair vault, toward the farther side of which was the statue of a man in armour, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iting by a table, leaning upon his left arm, and holding a sceptre in his right hand, with a lamp burning be∣fore him; the floor of this vault being so contrived, that upon the first step into it, the statute erected it∣self from its leaning posture, upon the second step, it lifted up the sceptre to strike, and before the man could approach near the lamp, to take hold of it, the statute struck and broke it to pieces; such care was had that it might not be taken away, nor discovered; and the learned and judicious Mr. Cambden, in his de∣scription of Yorkshire, page, 572, speaking of the tomb of Constantius Clorus, broken up in those times, mentions such a lamp to be found within it.</P>
<P>It is evident that there are several other relations to this purpose, besides these above mentioned, notwith∣standing the opposite opinions of our adversaries, by which it clearly appears that there have been such
<PB N="18" REF="034092_0017_0FFA1B5CD706AF10"/>
lamps which have remained burning for several cen∣turies together, &amp;c, and there are several opinions why the Ancients were so careful in preserving them, some of which we shall here exhibit.</P>
<P>1st. Some think it to be an expression of their be∣lief, concerning the soul's immortality after its de∣parture out of the body; a lamp among the Egyp∣tians being the hyerogliphick of life: and therefore that they that could not procure such lamps, were yet careful to have the image and representation of them engraved upon their tombs. Others conceive them by way of gratitude to those infernal deities, who took the charge and custody of their body's when dead, remaining always with them in their tombs, and were therefore called Dii Manes.</P>
<P>Others, that these lamps were only intended to make their sepulchres more pleasant, that they may not seem to be imprisoned in a dismal and uncomforta∣ble place. True indeed! a dead body cannot be sen∣sible of the light, no more could it of it's want of bu∣rial; yet the same instinct which did excite it to the desire of one, did also occasion the other.</P>
<P>Licetus concludes this ancient custom to have a double end; 1st. politick, for the distinction of such as were noble-born; hence it was usual for the nobles amongst the romans, to take special care in their last wills, that they might have a lamp in their own monu∣ments,
<PB N="19" REF="034092_0018_0FFA1BE2699416B8"/>
and for that purpose gave liberty to their slaves on this condition, that they should be watchful in maintaining and preserving it. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d. Natural, to pre∣serve the body from darkness;—of which tho' there have been so many sundry kinds; and several ways to make them, (some being able to resist any violence of weathers, others being easily extinguished by any little alteration of the air, some being enclosed round about with glass, others being open,) yet they are all of them utterly perished amongst the ruins of Time, and those who are versed in the search after them, have only recovered such dark conjectures, as are generally rejected and disbelieved by the litterati of a brighter age; So I shall say no more on this head, but conclude with that of the poet, <ABBR>viz,</ABBR>

<P><HI>The following curious anecdote was found indorsed on paper signed Alg.</HI> Sidney.</P>
<P>The Protector's advice to me, when I went from him to the King of Sweden in Poland; which I write from his own detailing, and the alteration in the second particular is his own hand.</P>
<P>I. IF you would not miscarry in this business, know first, that all publique businesses▪ and private too, pros∣per and succeed only as God is pleased to determine them.</P>
<P>II. And that therefore the greatest wisdom in them that are employed about businesse lies in this, that they seek to be accepted with God, which no man is, but by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>III. That there be a denial of mans own abilities, and that work be undertaken with humility and meek∣ness of spirit, and that one be swift to hear, and slow to speak, well understanding before he answer.</P>
<P>IV. That a man in his own conversations, as he would have a blessing, abstaine from all manner of e∣vil, and constantly, with all earnestness and truth of heart, crye to God for a blessing▪ seeing he disposes the issue of things all businesses as he pleases.</P>

my absolute retreat from all the polite and modish part of society, when you request from me a detail of my solitary amusements; no one should exact a more severe satisfaction: but, as I have no reason to question your former friendship, I shall, with my usual undisguised openness, lay before you my manner of life, and how it is agreeable to one of my years, worn out with the fatigues of the state, and cloy'd with the ways of the world.</P>
<P>I never was so sensible of my own dignity; abstract from business or diversion, my mind retires within it∣self, where it finds treasures, till now, undiscovered; capacities formed for infinite objects, desires that stretch themselves beyond the limits of this wide crea∣tion, in search of the great Original of life and pleas∣ure. I must tell you my Lord, that I find new pow∣ers exerting their energy, and employed in such exer∣cise, to which, till now, I have been a stranger.—How oft have You and I rallied the remembrance of our religious duties, and put his sacred truths on a level with the poet's rosy bowers, myrtle shades and elyssian fields? But now I am convinced, that the soil is immortal and capable of celestial joys, and triumph in the privi∣leges of my own being;—I rejoice to think, that the moment I began to exist, I entered on an eternal state, and commenced a duration, that shall run paralel to that of the supreme and self-existent mind.—This prospect ani∣mates

me with a divine ambition, and casts a reproach on all created glory, which we have been so long and so anxiously looking after. The world vanisheth; it's charms and soft allurements are no more; a vail is cast on mortal beauty; the spell is broken, the enchantment dissolved, and though I am every where surrounded with causeless enemies, nothing gives me so great trouble as the loss of so much time spent in the pur∣suit of perishable objects. Perchance you may smile, and take this for an imaginary triumph, or sort of cowardly insult, in the absence of an enemy: and may think my contempt of grandeur appears with an ill grace, in one that enjoys a considerable estate, a grand equipage, and many other tokens of his sovreign favour, for the services done to his king and country.</P>
<P>But this, my lord, is what has given me a just opin∣ion of the world, and of myself: a constant series of success and prosperity, has convinced me, that the whole creation cannot make me blessed. My ambitious designs have never been disappointed: I have been so vain to apply to my own power that awful sentence By me kings reign.—In love I have always been fortu∣nate. But whatever pleasure I pursued, the enjoy∣ment always undecieved me, or disgusted me.—Some∣times I was too wise, sometimes too capricious to be pleased▪—I have tried all the vanities below the sun; and there is lest no novelty to flatter me. I know the
<PB N="24" REF="034092_0023_0FFA582741D1ED58"/>
utmost that beauty and greatness can give, and am cu∣red of love and ambition by experimental evidence.</P>
<P>Your Lordship has been witness to many of those truths which I recollect in this seat of retirement. You cannot forget Eustatia; the admired Eustatia, in whose possessions my youthful days promised them∣selves lasting joys.—How did I adore her! You can tell with what eagerness and anxiety I pursued her virtue. But her yielding beauty, by granting my de∣sires, lost my esteem; her charms vanished, her wit was impertinance, and her artifice disgusted me: and this, in a great measure, put a period to my gallantries.—</P>
<P>I could thence forward look upon women, without any temptation to idolatry.—Balls and assemblies, dancing and dress, were no longer the subject of my se∣rious application: and I yielded an implicit assent to those petit maitres, whose talents lie in discussing the important controversies, who sings best at the opera' performs best at the play-houses, entertains us more a∣greeably at Vauxhall and Ranelagh▪ or who supplies the town best with Masquerade dresses, when they are ashamed to turn fools in their usual habit.</P>
<P>But these soft follies were only discarded for more spacious vanities.—Distinction and power.—Titles and equipage now fill my thoughts—Ambition now took full possession of my soul—I clothed myself with pat∣riotism▪ and as the circumstances of the times con∣cerned with my scheme, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> presently harrangued myself into esteem▪ and▪—You must remember that remark∣able

debate, by a well-timed opposition and constan∣cy. Made my adversaries think it worth their while to gain me over at any rate.—From such beginnings, I reached the envied height, and made myself glorious∣ly miserable.—I jumped into the saddle where I ex∣pected the consummation of all my wishes, but this very period, from whence I hoped to date my happiness, began with distrust and anxiety.</P>
<P>Forsaken by my patriot friends, I found myself sur∣rounded with flatterers and mercenary dependants; and my sleep, as well as my daily attendance on the state, disturbed with courtiers, dispatches, intrigues of the cab∣inet, and outcries of a discontented people loading me with the blame of those evils, which you are sensible would never have fallen upon them, had my moderate and more wholesome opinion been approved—My dis∣discontent under these vexations, was grown almost in∣supportable; and indeed, I must very soon have been borne down under such a weight, had not kind prov∣idence released me; and made my enemies the instru∣ments of doing me that good, which I was not able to do for myself. It was a happy coalition▪ my Lord, that set me free, and took the burthen upon their own shoulders.—What advantage they have got by it. I know not:—For my own part, I have gained a joyous retreat▪ surrounded with a charming variety of woods o∣pen lawns▪ and slow'ry vales in their uncultivated beau∣ty.

<HEAD>REMARKABLE LONGING AFTER DEATH</HEAD>
<P>YOU have heard, to be sure that S. Ashworth is dead I went to see her almost every day whilst I was at M—d; and, I hope, recieved daily improvement by the sight of her. Her behavior, as it was beyond any thing I ever knew, I think, deserves the highest enco∣miums, many people after so long an illness as hers, was, can bring themselves to be resigned, and easy with the thought of approaching death; but hers was much more than resignation, she express'd the great∣est joy imaginable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the thoughts of dying; and her greatest fear was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she should live. She was one day
<PB N="29" REF="034092_0028_0FFA1BEE563E32D8"/>
telling her Aunt, what great mercies she had received; that she had no more pain than what she could bear; and added, 'I could bear ten times as much with plea∣sure if I was sure death would come at last.' Mrs. Ashworth asked her, whether, if it were possible for her to recover▪ she would desire it. O! no, she said the fear of being snatched into the world again was her greatest dread, and (says she) if you could have any i∣dea of the transport I feel in the hope of being happy, you could not be so barbarous to wish me to live▪ How charming was this from so young a person! She was even, (I think) instead of being pitied, to be en∣vied in her most painful moments,</P>
<P>She was always asking, (when people had been to see her) what they said of her? and the most pleas∣ing thing you could have told her was, they thought she could not live; sometimes when she had been a long while without sleep, Mrs▪ Ashworth has been forced to tell her, she did not believe she could survive an hour; with this pleasing hope she would compose herself.—Who would not give up all the external charms of wealth or beauty. (which if we happen <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to possess, we are so apt to be proud of) for such a reso∣lution as this▪ at a time when our best earthly enjoy∣ments can be of no advantage to us? I own her behav∣ior made a much greater impression on me, than the fi∣nest admonition I ever heard from the pulpit; as ex∣ample is beyond precept.</P>
<P>When I was with her there appeared something
<PB N="30" REF="034092_0029_0FFA585403734918"/>
more pleasing in death than I had ever before imagined▪</P>
<P>Every human creature is naturally shocked at the thought of a dissolution, but it seemed to give her so much pleasure that it made me reflect on that fine say∣ing of St. Paul, O Death! where is thy sting! O Grave! where is thy victory? The sting of Death is sin: How true is it! for when combatted by virtue and re∣ligion, it loses all its venom, and we recieve it not as an enemy, nor barely as a release from trouble, but as a kind summons to happiness. I am very willing to believe this was Mrs Ashworth's case, and that her be∣havior was not owing to presumption, or stupidity; but wholly to conscious innocence.</P>

<HEAD>MAXIMS FOR THE CONDUCT OF LIFE. TEMPERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE richest endowments of the mind, are tem∣perence, prudence, and fortitude; Self-denial is the most exalted pleasure; and the conquest of evil habits, the most glorious triumph.</P>
<P>The meanest approach thou canst make to happi∣ness on this side the grave, is to enjoy understanding and health.</P>
<P>These blessings if thou possessest, and wouldst pre∣serve to old age, avoid the allurements of voluptuous∣ness, and fly from her temptations.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="034092_0030_0FFA59378B88E180"/>
When she spreadeth her delicacies on the table, when her wine sparkles in the cup, when she smileth upon thee, and persuadeth thee to be joyful and happy: then is the hour of danger, and let reason stand firm∣ly on her guard: for if thou hearkenest unto the words of her adversary, thou art decieved and betrayed.</P>
<P>The joy which she promiseth changeth to madness; and her enjoyments lead on to diseases and death.</P>
<P>Cast thine eyes upon her guests, who have listened to her temptations; are they not meagre, are they not sickly, are they not spiritless?</P>
<P>Their short hours of jollity are followed by tedious days of pain and dejection: her votaries are become her victims, the just and natural consequence which God hath ordained in the constitution of things, for the punishment of those who abuse his gifts.

<HEAD>PRUDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>JUDGMENT is the throne of prudence, and silence is its sanctury. It is a maxim of prudence to leave things before they leave us. The true way to advance another's virtue, is to follow it; and the best way to decry down another's vice, is to decline it. A warm heart requires a cool head. Courage without conduct,
<PB N="32" REF="034092_0031_0FFA585D0FED7420"/>
is, like fancy without judgment; all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail, and no ballast. Put a bridle on thy tongue; set a guard before thy lips, lest the words of thine own mouth destroy thy peace.</P>
<P>Boast not of thyself, for it shall bring contempt up∣on thee, neither deride another for it is dangerous.</P>
<P>A bitter jest is the poison of friendship, and he that cannot restrain his tonge; shall have trouble.</P>
<P>Furnish thyself with the proper accommodations be∣longing to thy condition but spend not the utmost of what thou canst afford, that the providence of thy youth may be a comfort to thy old age. Let not prosperity put out the eyes of circumspection, nor a∣bundance cut off the hands of frugality, he that too much indulges in the superfluities of life, shall live to lament the want of it's necessaries. From the expe∣rience of others do thou learn wisdom, and from their failings correct thine own faults. Charity obliges not to mistrust a man, prudence not to trust him before we know him.</P>
<P>When thou hast proved a man to be honest, look him up in thine heart as a treasure, regard him as a jewel of inestimable value.</P>
<P>Refuse the favours of a mercenary man, they will be a snare unto thee, thou shalt never be quit of the obligation. Use not to day what to-morrow may
<PB N="33" REF="034092_0032_0FFA594020F64738"/>
want; neither leave that to hazard which foresight may provide for, or can prevent.</P>
<P>Yet expect not even from prudence infallible suc∣cess; for the day knoweth not what the night may bring forth.</P>
<P>The fool is not always unfortunate, nor the wise man always successful.</P>

<HEAD>FORTITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>PERILS, misfortunes, pain, and injury, are more or less the lot of every man that cometh into the world.</P>
<P>In human life there is a constant change of fortune, and it is unreasonable to expect from the common fate. Life itself decays, and all things are daily on the change.</P>
<P>Imprint this maxim deeply in your mind, that there is nothing certain in this human and mortal state; by which means you will avoid being transported with prosperity and being dejected in adversity.</P>
<P>A wise man stands firm in all extremities, and bears the lot of his humanity with a divine temper.</P>
<P>He suffers not his happiness to depend on her smiles, and with her frowns he will not be dismayed.</P>
<P>Under the pressure of his misfortunes, his calmness alleviates their weight, and his constancy shall surmount them.</P>
<P>A peaceful conscience honest thoughts, virtuous ac∣tions, and an indifference for casual events, are bles∣sings
<PB N="34" REF="034092_0033_0FFA58702A79E2D8"/>
without end or measure; this consummate state of felicity is a submission to the dictates of right nature; the foundation of its wisdom and virtue; the know∣ledge of what we ought do, and the conformity of the will to that knowledge. Every virtue gives a man a de∣gree of felicity in some kind: honesty gives a man a good report; justice, estimation; prudence, respect▪ courtesy and liberallity, affection; temperence, gives health; fortitude, a quiet mind, not to be moved by any adversity.</P>
<P>Virtue is a blessing, which man alone possesses, and no other creature has any title to but himself. All is nothing without her, and she alone is all. The other blessings of this life, are often times imaginary: She is always real—She is the life and crown of all perfections.</P>
