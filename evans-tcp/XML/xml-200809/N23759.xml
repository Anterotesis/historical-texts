<P>HIS Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, being desirous by a Trea∣ty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, to terminate their differences in such a man∣ner, as without reference to the merits of their respective complaints and pretentions, may be the best calculated to produce mutual satisfac∣tion and good understanding; And also to re∣gulate the commerce and navigation between their respective countries, territories and peo∣ple, in such a manner as to render the same reciprocally beneficial and satisfactory; they have, respectively, named their plenipotentia∣ries, and given them full powers to treat of, and conclude, the said treaty, that is to say;

<P>HIS Majesty will withdraw all his troops and garrisons, from all posts and places within the boundary lines assigned by the treaty of peace to the United States. This evacuation shall take place on or before the first day of June one thousand seven hundred and ninety six, and all the proper theasures shall in the interval be taken by concert between the go∣vernment

All settlers and traders, within the precincts or jurisdiction of the said Posts, shall continue to enjoy, unmo∣lested, all their property of every kind, and shall be protected therein.

But it is understood, that this article does not extend to the admission of vessels of the United States into the sea ports, harbours, bays, or creeks of his Majesty's said territo∣ries; nor into such parts of the rivers in his Majesty's said territories as are between the mouth thereof, and the highest Port of entry from the sea, except in small vessels trading <HI>bona fide</HI> between Montreal and Quebec, un∣der such regulations as shall be established to prevent the possibility of any frauds in this respect. Nor to the admission of British vessels from the sea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highest ports of entry for foreign vessels from the sea. The river Missisippi, shall, however, according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its eastern side, to whichsoever of the parties belonging, may freely be resorted to and used by both par∣ties, in as ample a manner as any of the At∣lantic

And in like man∣ner, all goods and merchandize whose im∣portation into the United States shall not be wholly prohibited, may freely, for the pur∣poses of commerce, be carried into the same, in the manner aforesaid, by his Majesty's subjects, and such goods and merchandize shall be subject to no higher or other duties than would be payable by the citizens of the United States on the importation of the same in American vessels into the Atlantic ports of the said States. And all goods not prohibited to be exported from the said terri∣tories respectively, may in like manner be carried out of the same by the two parties re∣spectively, paying duty as aforesaid.</P>
<P>No duty of entry shall ever be levied by either party an peltries brought by land, or inland navigation into the said territories re∣spectively, nor shall the Indians passing or re∣passing

<P>No higher or other tolls or rates of ferri∣age than what are or shall be payable by na∣tives, shall be demanded on either side; and no duties shall be payable on any goods which shall merely be carried over any of the porta∣ges or carrying places on either side; for the purpose of being immediately reimbarked and carried to some other place or places.

<P>As this article is intended to render in a great degree the local advantages of each par∣ty common to both, and thereby to promote a disposition favorable to friendship and good neighborhood, it is agreed, that the respective governments will mutually pro∣mote this amicable intercourse, by causing speedy and impartial justice to be done, and

<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS it is uncertain whether the river Missisippi extends so far to the northward as to be intersected by a line to be drawn due west from the Lake of the Woods, in the manner mentioned in the treaty of peace be∣tween his majesty and the United States; it is agreed, that measures shall be taken in con∣cert between his majesty's government in America and the government of the United States, for making a joint survey of the said river from one degree of latitude below the Falls of St. Anthony, to the principal scource or scources of the said river and also of the parts adjacent thereto; and that if on the re∣sult of such survey, it should appear that the said river, would not be intersected by such a line as is above mentioned, the two parties will thereupon proceed by amicable negoci∣ation, to regulate the boundary line in that quarter, as well as all other points to be ad∣justed between the said parties, according to justice and mutual convenience, and in con∣formity to the intent of the said treaty.</P>

The said commissioners shall meet at Halifax, and shall have power to adjourn to such other place or places as they shall think fit. They shall have power to appoint a secretary, and to employ such surveyors or other persons as they shall judge necessary. The said com∣missioners shall by a declaration under their hands and seals decide what river is the river St. Croix intended by the treaty.—The said declaration shall contain a description of the said river, and shall particularize the latitude and longitude of its mouth and of its source.

<HEAD>ARTICLE VI.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS it is alledged by divers British merchants, and others his Majesty's subjects, that debts to a considerable amount, which were <HI>bona fide</HI> contracted before the peace, still remain owing to them by citizens or inha∣bitants of the United States, and that by the ope∣ration of various lawful impediments since the peace, not only the full recovery of the said debts has been delayed, but also the value and security thereof have been, in several in∣stances, impaired and lessened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the British creditors cannot now obtain, and ac∣tually have and receive full and adequate compensation for the losses and damages which they have thereby sustained: It is agreed, that in all such cases where full com∣pensation for such losses and damages can∣not for whatever reason be actually obtained,
<PB N="13" REF="031414_0013_0FEC51CC8CD54B28"/>
had and received by the said creditors in the ordinary course <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> justice, the United States will make full and complete compensation for the same to the said creditors: But it is dis∣tinctly understood, that this provision is to extend to such losses only as have been occa∣sioned by the lawful impediments aforesaid, and is not to extend to losses occasioned by such insolvency of the debtors, or other causes as would equally have operated to pro∣duce such loss, if the said impediments had not existed, nor to such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the manifest delay or negligence, or wilful omission of the claimant.</P>
<P>For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of any such losses and damages, five com∣missioners shall be appointed, and authorised to meet and act in manner following, viz. Two of them shall be appointed by his Ma∣jesty, two of them by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and the fifth by the unanimous voice of the other four; and if they should not agree in such choice, then the commissioners named by the two parties shall respectively propose one person, and of the two names so proposed, one shall be drawn by lot in the presence of the four original commissioners.—When the five com∣missioners thus appointed shall first meet, they shall, before they proceed to act, respec∣tively
<PB N="14" REF="031414_0014_0FEC522C846BE5A0"/>
take the following oath or affirmation, in the presence of each other, which oath or affirmation being so taken and duly at∣tested, shall be entered on the record of their proceedings, viz. I <HI>A. B,</HI> one of the com∣missioners appointed in pursuance of the sixth article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, between his Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, do so∣lemnly swear, '<HI>or affirm</HI>' that I will ho∣nestly, diligently, impartially, and carefully examine, and to the best of my judgment, according to justice and equity, decide all such complaints, as under the said article shall be preferred to the said commissioners; and that I will forbear to act as a commis∣sioner, in any case in which I may be per∣sonally interested.</P>
<P>Three of the said commissioners shall con∣stitute a board, and shall have power to do any act appertaining to the said commission, provided that one of the commissioners named on each side, and the fifth commissioner shall be present, and all decisions shall be made by the majority of the voices of the commissioners then present; eigh∣teen months from the day on which the said commissioners shall form a board, and be ready to proceed to business, are assigned for receiving complaints and applications; but they are nevertheless authorized in any parti∣cular cases in which it shall appear to them to
<PB N="15" REF="031414_0015_0FEC528B6089ECF0"/>
be reasonable and just, to extend the said term of eighteen months, for any term not exceed∣ing six months, after the expiration thereof. The said commissioners shall first meet at Phi∣ladelphia, but they shall have power to adjourn from place to place is they shall see cause.</P>
<P>The said commissioners in examining the complaints and applications so preferred to them, are empowered and required, in pursu∣ance of the true intent and meaning of this article, to take into their consideration all claims, whether of principal or interest, or balances of principal and interest, and to de∣termine the same respectively, according to the merits of the several cases, due regard being had to all the circumstances thereof, and as equity and justice shall appear to them to re∣quire. And the said commissioners shall have power to examine all such persons as shall come before them, on oath or affirmation touching the premises; and also to receive in evidence according as they may think most consistent with equity and justice, all written depositions, or books, or papers, or copies, or extracts thereof, every such deposition, book, or paper, or copy, or extract, being duly authen∣ticated, either according to the legal forms now respectively existing in the two countries, or in such other manner as the said commissi∣oners shall see cause to require or allow.</P>
<P>The award of the said commissioners or of any three of them as aforesaid, shall in all
<PB N="16" REF="031414_0016_0FEC442C60FBEC88"/>
cases be final and conclusive, both as to the justice of the claim, and to the amount of the sum to be paid to the creditor or claimant: And the United States undertake to cause the sum so awarded to be paid in specie to such creditor or claimant without deduction; and at such time or times, and at such place or places as shall be awarded by the said commis∣sioners; and on condition of such releases or assignments to be given by the creditor or claimant, as by the said commissioners may be directed: Provided always, that no such pay∣ment shall be fixed by the said commissioners to take place sooner than twelve months from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE VII.</HEAD>

<PB N="17" REF="031414_0017_0FEC516323816E88"/>
cases, where adequate compensation cannot, for whatever reason, be now actually obtain∣ed, had and received by the said merchants and others in the ordinary course of justice, full and complete compensation for the same will be made by the British Government to the said complainants. But it is distinctly un∣derstood that this provision is not to extend to such losses or damages as have been occasion∣ed by the manifest delay or negligence, or wil∣ful omission of the claimant.</P>
<P>That for the purpose of ascetaining the a∣mount of any such losses and damages, five commissioners shall be appointed and authoriz∣ed to act in London, exactly in the manner directed with respect to those mentioned in the preceding article, and after having taken the same oath or affirmation <HI>(mu∣tatis mutandis)</HI> the same term of eighteen months is also assigned for the reception of claims, and they are in like mannner autho∣rised to extend the same in particular cases. They shall receive testimony, books, papers and evidence in the same latitude, and exer∣cise the like discretion and powers respect∣ing that subject, and shall decide the claims in question according to the merits of the several cases, and to justice, equity, and the laws of nations. The award of the said com∣missioners, or any such three of them as afore∣said, shall, in all cases, be final and conclu∣sive, both as to the justice of the claim, and

the amount of the sum to be paid to the clai∣mant; and his Britannic Majesty undertakes to cause the same to be paid to such claimant in specie, without any deduction, at such place or places, and at such time or times as shall be awarded by the said commissioners and on condition of such releases or assign∣ments: to be given by the claimant, as by the said commissioners may be directed.</P>
<P>And whereas certain merchants and others his Majesty's subjects complain that in the course of the war they have sustained loss and damage, by reason of the capture of their vessels and merchandize, taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the states and brought into ports of the same, or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of the said states.</P>
<P>It is agreed that in all such cases where restitution shall not have been made agreea∣bly to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jef∣ferson to Mr. Hammond, dated at Philadel∣phia, Sep. 5, 1793, a copy of which is an∣nexed to this Treaty; the complaints of the parties shall be and hereby are referred to the commissioners to be appointed by virtue of this article, who are hereby authorised and required to proceed in the like manner relative to these as to the other cases committed to them; and the United States undertake to pay to the complainants or claimants in specie, without deduction,

Provided only, that it shall not be lawful for them in any time of war between the British government and any other power or state whatever, to export from the said territories, without the special permission of the British government there, any military stores, or naval stores, or rice. The citizens of the United States shall pay for their vessels when admitted into the said ports no other or high∣er tonnage duty than shall be payable on Bri∣tish vessels when admitted into the ports of the United States. And they shall pay no o∣ther or higher duties or charges, on the im∣portation or exportation of the cargoes of the said vessels, than shall be payable on the same articles when imported or exported in Bri∣tish vessels.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with yours of August 30. Mine of the 7th of that month assured you that measures were taken for excluding from all further asylum in our ports, vessels armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace, and for the restoration of the prizes the Lovely Lass, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; and that should the measures for restitution fail in their effect, the President considered it as in∣cumbent on the United States to make com∣pensation for the vessels.</P>
<P>WE are bound by our treaties with three of the belligerent nations, by all the means in our power to protect and defend their vessels and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the seas near our shores, and to recover and restore the same to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are used, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with those nations to make compensation.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="031414_0042_0FEC51AE190E71A8"/>THOUGH we have no similar treaty with Great Britain, it was the opinion of the President, that we should use towards that nation the same rule, which under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high seas, and brought into our ports, if done by vessels which had been armed within them.</P>
<P>HAVING, for particular reasons, forbore to use all the means in our power for the resti∣tution of the three vessels mentioned in my letter of August 7th, the President thought it incumbent on the United States to make compensation for them: And though nothing was said in that letter of other vessels taken under like circumstances, and brought in after the 5th of June, and before the date of that letter, yet when the same forbearance had taken place, it was and is his opinion, that compensation would be equally due.</P>
<P>AS to prizes made under the same cir∣cumstances, and brought in after the date of that letter, the President determined, that all the means in our power should be used for their restitution. If these fail, as we should not be bound by our treaties to make compensation to the other powers in the analogous case, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great Britain. But still if any cases shall arise sub∣sequent to that date, the circumstances of
<PB N="43" REF="031414_0043_0FEC51B24D89DDB8"/>
which shall place them on similar ground with those before it, the President would think compensation equally incumbent on the United States.</P>
<P>Instructions are given to the governors of the different states, to use all the means in their power for restoring prizes of this last description found within their ports. Though they will of course take measures to be in∣formed of them, and the general government has given them the aid of the custom-house officers for this purpose, yet you will be sen∣sible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as shall depend on yourself, or any person under your direction, in order that the governors may use the means in their power for making restitution.</P>
<P>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot restore it. It will always be best to give the notice to them directly; but any information which you shall be pleased to send to me also at any time shall be for∣warded to them as quickly as distance will permit.</P>
<P>Hence you will perceive, Sir, that the President contemplates restitution or com∣pensation in the case before the 7th of Au¦gust; and after that date, restitution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you should substantiate the fact, that such prizes are in our ports or waters.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="031414_0044_0FEC51BB1A273C78"/>Your list of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports is, I believe, correct.</P>
<P>With respect to losses by detention, waste, spoliation sustained by vessels taken as be∣fore mentioned, between the dates of June 5th and August 7th, it is proposed as a pro∣visional measure, that the collector of the cus∣toms of the district, and the British consul, or any other person you please, shall appoint persons to establish the value of the vessel and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which she is brought, according to their value in that port. If this shall be agreeable to you, and, you will be pleased to signify it to me, with the names of the prizes understood to be of this description, instructions will be given accordingly, to the collector of the customs where the respective vessels are.</P>
