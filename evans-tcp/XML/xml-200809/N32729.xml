<P>"He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of GOD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of our blessed LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, which he spake to NICODEMUS, a ruler of the Jews. We have an account in the first part of this chapter, of his coming to Christ by night, and he seemed to be convinc'd by the miracles which Christ wrought of his being a teacher come from God for he said unto him "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do these miracles that thou dost, except God be with him"; Jesus immediately goes to preaching to him the necessity of the NEW BIRTH, which Nicodemus seemed to be altogather ignorant about? Jesus answered and said unto him, verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. This was strange doctrine to Nicodemus, he did not distinguish between a being born of the flesh, and of the spirit; and therefore saith, how can these things be &amp;c. Jesus goes on to demonstrate the matter till he comes to speak of the Son of man's being lifted up, as MOSES lifted up the serpent in the wilderness. A clear type of Christ's being lifthd up: For as those that were stung with the firery Serpents were healed by beholding the brazon Serpent, so sinners by looking or believing in Christ the great antitype, should receive spiritual healing. Therefore Christ saith, as MOSES lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; that
<PB N="5" REF="043017_0004_101CC574E4384EF0"/>
whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have etrnal life, for God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have ever∣lasting life. Great love indeed; great gift indeed, That when man had broke the law of God and turned rebel, and took up arms against his Maker, that God should have such pity and compassion on him as to send his Son into the world, to take our law place and die in our stead, for God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved? And then follows the words of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: "He that believeth on him is not condemned" That is by faith he receives the righteousness of Jesus by which he is set free from the condemning power of the divine law, and so shall be eternally saved, "But he that believes not is condemn'd already" That is, sentance of death contained in the law is already past upon him and the reason here for, is given in express terms, because he hath no believed on the name of the only begotton Son of God</P>

<HEAD>FIRST,</HEAD>
<P>I Am to shew how man came to be in this miserable condition, GOD at first made man holy and upright, and gave him his holy and righteous law, and as long as man kept the law, he remained a happy man. But man being seduced and tempted by satan, and giving more credit to what the devil said, then to what GOD said, he took up with the devil's counsel, and so broke the law of God. Man was threaten'd with death in ease of disobedience, and so death took place. man became spiritually dead, and under a state of condemnation. Here infidelity first took place in man, by disbelieveing the severity of God, mani∣fest in the law, hence he is in a state of condemna∣tion by the law; and as there could be no way for his recovery, but by the gospel in which Christ is set forth to be the only Saviour of sinners, his condemnation is argmented by his disbelieving the gospel which is plainly demonstrated in our Text, viz. "because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of GOD."</P>
<P>And so we come to the second Head, which is,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SESOND.</HEAD>
<P>The misery of man in this condition, whilst in this state he is a stranger to God: And being a stranger to him, he is a stranger to true happiness, he is a stranger to peace? "There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked" Isaiah. vlviii. 22. He is under a broken law and is no ways able to keep it so, being under a broken law, he is under all the curses of the law, he is at enmity with God. We read the carnal mind, is enmity against God, not subject to his law, neither indeed can be, he is under the displeasure of the great God, that God, that in able to sink him to Hell in a moment, is angry with him, we read God is angry with the
<PB N="7" REF="043017_0006_101CC5790E4DB670"/>
wicked every day, a wicked man is spiritually a dead man, we read of his being dead in trespasses and sins: He is distitude of true love to God, which is that charity we read of, that a man is nothing without; he is a slave and captive to satan, we read of his being led captive by him, at his will, he stands at the devils beck, when he says go, he goeth, and when he says come, he cometh, he is bent upon doing evil, he hath no mind nor will to do any thing that is good; he is spiritually blind and ignorant, he always puts evil for good, and good for evil, light for darkness, and darkness for light.</P>
<P>He is always taking a wrong course, till enlight∣ned by the blessed spirit of God, he is always seeking after happiness, but in a wrong way, all the powers of his mind are corrupted, his love is always set upon wrong objects, he loves the creature more than the Creator. He always makes a God of something, besides the liveing and true God, his will chooses the evil, and re∣fuses the good.</P>
<P>Christ said, ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life. His memory forgets what it should remem∣ber, &amp; remember vvhat it should not: he hath a very wicked heart, we read, that the heart is deceitful and desperately wicked, above all things, whilst man remains out of Christ. He is always a sinning in every thing he does, let men pretend to what duty they will, we read that whatsoever is not of faith is sin. Men may please themselves with abundance of fine Stories, about their good doings, and Ministers may encourage them on, but every thing they do is sin, well says some we know that wicked men coimmit a great deal of sin but don't they do a great deal of good too, and do a great many duties. I tell you they sin in every thing they do, for we read in the word of God, that
<PB N="8" REF="043017_0007_101CC57AC639A890"/>
whatsoever is not of faith is sin, and without faith. it is impossible to please God.</P>
<P>The duties may be good of themselves; they may be good as to the matter of them, but bad as to the manner of them, being done out of a wrong end; being not done to the glory of God. Natural men. hath alvvays self at the bottom; they have some self ends in all that they do, they hope to passify God, they hope to please God, they hope to face the better in this world, or it may be they hope to get to Heaven by their do∣ings but this is all wrong. I don't mean to dis∣courage men from any duty, but what I am after is to drive men off from self dependence, and not have them flatter themselves up with hopes of getting to heaven, in the way that leads to Hell; not to take pains to build on a sandy foundation, and think that they are keeping the commands of God when at the same time they continue break∣ing them.</P>
<P>For God in his word says, "Wheather you eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God, but wicked men don't do all to his Glory, nor nothing at all as they should do, and in this case suppose they could do duties without commiting sin, what would they do with their sins that's past, if they could live a hundred years without one Sin. Still they are under a broken law, and having offended the justice of God, and being under a broken law and not able to make any satisfaction, and altogather unable to keep the lavv.</P>
<P>Man I say being in this condition is exposed to all miseries in this life, to death itself and to the pains of hell forever, if he dies in this condition. And hovv many in this dreadful case are altoga∣ther unconcern'd about themselves, sleeping as it vvere upon the top of a mast, and hanging in a manner by a twine thread over everlasting burn∣ings;

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THIRD,</HEAD>
<P>The great God knew before he made man, what a dreadful condition man would plunge him∣self into, by falling from him and out of infinite love, entered into a covenant with his own dear Son, to give him a number of the poor fallen race to come and redeem and save by taking their low place, and dying in their room and stead. The Son foresaw the wretched case that man would be in, had a like good will to the work he saw, that their was no other way that poor men could be saved and all Gods at∣tributes be glorified, so he undertook the great work to come and take the low place of man, to satisfy di∣vine justice, to fulfil the law and make it honorable: to slept in as a surety, a bondsmen he undertook in mans behalf, he became the end of the law for righteousness to every one that beliveth, he satisfied the justice of God for all the elect, and wrought out a perfect righteousness sufficient to cloth them with, and the only way any one ever can be saved is by what Christ hath done and suffered, for there is no other name given under Heaven whereby we must be saved, their is no other way nor name Christ saith I am the way, and the truth, and the life: "No man cometh unto the Father but by me," John xiv. 6.</P>
<P>Christ righteousness imputed to sinners, is what justifies them before God, Isaiah xl 21. "The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake, he will magnifie the law, and make it honorable." Isaiah

So that it appears plainly that what Christ hath done and suffered is the only cause of any ever being saved, which brings me to the fourth head, which is to show something of the happiness of those that are freed from this condition of condemnation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST,</HEAD>
<P>They are happy being brought into the favor of God, again David said, "in thy favour is life, and thy loving kindness is better than life," they enjoy the love of God, they are passed from death to life, John iii. 36. "He that beliveth on the Son, hath everlasting life," they are in a safe state, they are upon a sure foundation, safer then Adam was in the garden. Christ saith that none shall pluck them out of his hand, Christ ever loves them, and they love Christ; read in Solomon Songs of their love to each other, they are safe living and dying: God saith that all things small work together for good to them that love God. Mark the perfect man and be∣hold the upright, for the end of that man is peace, they will go to be even with the Lord, Christ saith, "Father, I will that those which thou hast given me, be with me, that they may behold my glory," John xvii. 24. tho' they may suffer many temptations in this life, and be sometimes over come, yet blessed be God, Christ never was overcome, and there is there safety, and they will get by and by, where there will be no trouble, no sorrow, no temptation, no∣thing to disturb them in all that holy mountain.</P>

<P>Now what remains is the improvement of the whole, and first, is it as we have heard; "that he that beliveth not it condemned already:" then learn

What do you think will become of you, if you live and die in this dreadful condition, you great enmity against the great God, and under his wrath and curse, and so liable to all misery, and seem to be altogether unconcerned, seem to walk up and down as if no∣thing ailed you. You would think it strange to see a poor murderer shut up in prison, and condemned to be hanged, and nothing concerned about it, why sinner, this is nothing to your case; you are con∣demned by the law of God, and hang as it were by a slender thread of life, over everlasting misery, and don't know but every breath may be your last, and if death finds you in this condition, you are gone to all eternity, and how do you think you can meet your great Judge and have him against you. Then may you call to the rocks and mountains, and all to no purpose, but come forth you must, and there hear the sentence, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his an∣gels," and away you must go into everlasting fire there to be to all eternity; now sinner you seem to be airry and jolly as if nothing ailed you, but when you come to die, then you will be of another mind if you could see the dreadful condition you are in, it would strike a damp upon all your merriment, but you seem to be altogether senseless about your case, but it may be if ever you come to lie on a death bed, then you may be of another mind, but if not before when death closes your bodily eyes, then it will open your spiritual eyes, you will be of a different mind with a witness, then you will be of another mind, and that to all eternity, and there will be an end of all comfort, all pleasure, never no more case, no more peace forever, nothing but weeping and wait∣ing and gnashing of teeth forever and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; think how you can bear to lye under the scalding drop,

(Everlasting) O that word, never to be an end: when any one is in great pain, such as the tooth ake or the like, O how un∣easy be they when it is night, they wish for morning, thinking the time long, but then they hope by and by it will be over, and that is some comfort to them; but if a person was in small pain, and knew that he never should be no better as long as he lived, this would seem to add to his trouble.</P>
<P>"O who can dwell with devouring fire, who can inhabit everlasting burnings;" it may be you think and flatter yourselves that you shall do as well as others, but others won't be no comfort to you there in hell, your companions now in sin will aggravate and increase your misery when you come to hell, and the devil that now tempts and intices you to sin, then will be your tormentor, and it may be, you flatter yourselves that it is not so bad as I set it forth; but if you won't believe it, it is but only waiting a little while longer, if you go on in the way you are now in, and you will find all true to your eternal sorrow, and a great deal more, so that it is likely you may have to say as the Queen of Sheabe did in another case, that the one half vvas not told you: it may be you never intended to come to this place of tor∣ment, and I suppose you don't, I suppose their don't one of you all intend to go to hell, vvell hovv do you intend to escape, you are already condemned, and there is but one vvay of escape, and if you miss that
<PB N="13" REF="043017_0012_101CC589B1CA5E50"/>
way, you are gone forever, and that is a strait and narrow way: Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there is that find it: Because wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there be that go in thereat. It may be you intend to grow better, and betake yourselves to good duties, and so get to Heaven that way; it may be you intend to repent, and lead a new life some time hence, when you get over such or such a piece of business; but it may be that you may not live to see that time that you have set, death may come suddenly and snatch you a∣way, and where be you then; you have none of you a lease of your lives, and if you should live till that time, it may be you may have something greater to hinder, at least you may be more hardened in sin, and you cant turn off yourselves then neither, nor your good doings won't save you that you lot upon. Well some may say if our good doings won't save us, we may do as bad as we please, if that is the case, we may live as we list: But hold man, if your good works won't save you, yet your bad works will damn you, they will be the means of sinking you the deeper into hell. "How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much sorrow and torment give her:" Reve xviii. 7. Sinners it may be you think it strange to see ministers so earnest, to hear them speak loud, but if you could see the dreadful condi∣tion you are in, you would wonder they wan't more earnest; you may wonder to see people cry and take on under conviction, but if you was to see hell, naked before you, and destruction without a covering you would take on too: You may wonder to see christians cry and weep, when they hear Christ's sufferings preached; but if you could behold by an eye of faith, what Christ hath done and suffered for poor sinners, you would not wonder to see any cry as the hearing of it. And</P>

other way of escape, but by the Lord Jesus Christ, by his righteous life and bitter death: Then learn the folly of those who are trying some other way to get to Heaven; is not there many think ye, that are a put∣ing something <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the room of Christ, are a trust∣ing to something of their own doings, are a building a righteousness of their own; any that are upon that scheme, are a building on a sandy foundation, that won't stand the trial. I don't say but that good works are good in their place but what I say is, that good works are not the way to Heaven: Christ is the way. Good works are signs of a good man, but they are not means nor conditions of making a good man, and here it is that people make the grand mistake: We read that a good man guideth his affairs with discretion, and sheweth mercy and lendeth; but that don't make them good, there being good maketh them do the good works: But what I say is, there good works don't make them good.</P>
<P>What are signs of a good man, they put for con∣ditions to make good men, what makes men good, is being engrafted into Christ, by a true and living faith, that faith that works by love, and purifies the heart, and overcomes the world, and is productive of good fruit, and where this faith is, it will bear good fruit: This faith will produce good works, but the doings of good works, won't beget this faith. A good tree bringeth forth good fruit but take a bad tree, and put on eversomuch good fruit, and that won't make it a good tree; well but some may say, we don't expect that our good works will save us alone but we must do our part, and Christ will do his, if we do what we can, what we can't do, Christ will make up but that is all wrong. Christ will be a whole Saviour or else none at all; his coat was without seam, and his righteousness won't bear piece∣ing. It men will but depend upon their doings the devil don't care how much they do, he is not afraid of losing them that way: Let them build never so stately a house, it will fall about their ears, when the storm comes, being built upon a sandy founda∣tion:
<PB N="15" REF="043017_0014_101CC5912C08EF18"/>
If you fast twice a week, and pay ties of all that you posess, and give all your goods to feed the poor, and your body to be burnt, and depend upon that to justify you, you may go to hell when you have done all, and lest any should say, that I have said more then I can prove: Let us see what the word of God saith upon this head. Christ saith, "except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no ease enter into the kingdom of heaven:" Matt. v. 20. "Therefore by the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justi∣fied in his sight: For by the law is the knowledge of sin:" Rom. iii. 20. "Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:" Rom. iii. 24. For as by one mans disobe∣dience many were made sinners: So by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous:" Rom. v. 19. "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified." Gal. ii. 16. "For if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain." Gal. ii. 21. And many places of scripture more, might be named to the same purpose; indeed the scriptures are so plain, that it seems as if every one that reads, might see it But may be some may say, what need is there of telling us about this: We don't think that our works will save us, now under the second covenant: The first covenant was of works; but now the conditions are, faith and repentance; but this is all wrong: Faith and repentance won't save you, no more then good works will; no, nor they are not conditions neither. Christ hath suffered all the conditions, for all that ever will be saved: It is true, there never will none be saved without true faith, and it is likely where there is true faith, there will be true repentance▪ but then what I say is, faith and repentance don't save none; they be not conditions, their is nothing that we can do as causes means or conditions of even our being saved.</P>
<P>As I said before, there will none be saved without
<PB N="16" REF="043017_0015_101CC592C1903520"/>
faith, God will qualify every one that he saves, with that qualification: For we read, "he that be∣liveth shall be saved, and he that beliveth not, shall be damned:" For by grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves: It is the gift of God. Eph. ii. 8. It is through faith, not for faith, it is altogether for what Christ hath done and suffer∣ed, that any are saved. "Christ is the author and finisher of faith:" How can a person be chose for the having any thing, when they are chose before they have it. We read of the elect, being chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world: It won't do to put faith and repentance in the room of Christ, no more then it will good works; if you make a God of that, you had as good make a God of any thing else. It seems as if people vvill alvvays be a build∣ing upon something vvrong, 'till they understand the doctrine of election, either upon vvorks, or faith, or repentance, or it may be upon their undependance, or something else vvrong. I am afraid that people, a great many, encourages themselves on in sin, de∣pending upon after repentance, but that is a poor vvay: But I shall speak of another sort of people, vvho seem to flatter themselves, that they depend upon Christ to save them, and that they are a going in a right vvay to Heaven, and all the time as great sin∣ners as any: They seem to be convinced, that they can't do any thing to save themselves, they don't de∣pend upon nothing but Christ they say, to save them; and at the same time, are sound as bad as any body: This here is vvhat vve call an Antinomean scheme, and vvhen a person comes to be beat off from a self-righteous Pharese scheme, or a norminon scheme, vvhich is one and the same. There is great danger I believe of runing into this scheme, for the de∣vil alvvays stands ready, vvhen people come out of one vvrong vvay, to push them into another. The devil is always going about like a roaring lion, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom he may devour, he will keep people <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possible, in carnal security. But if they begin to be somewhat concerned, and think that way <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="17" REF="043017_0016_101CC59639FC9AC0"/>
he sets them then to depending upon some thing they can do themselves, and if they are brought to see that they can't do nothing to justify or help themselves, then the devil tells them that they had no need do any thing, so if one suit won't do any longer, he puts that off and claps on another: And so he comes in a thousand shapes as it were to deceive poor man, but don't let us hear any longer to the devils lies.</P>
<P>But let us hear what the word of God saith, Christ saith, "Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit: But a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit: Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit:" Matt. vii. 17, 18. Now Christ saith, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; and will any one, think to be a good tree, and not bring forth good fruit, but bad. "But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we our selves also are found sin∣ners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid:" Gal. ii. 17. "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: Neither fornicators, nor idola∣ters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covet∣ous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingd in of God:" 1 Cor. vi. 9.10. "Follow place with all men, and holiness, with∣out which no man shall see the Lord." Heb. xii. 14. All that are ever saved will be made holy; they want to be made happy for being made holy: But justification and sanctification always go toge∣ther, they are two links which always go together in one chain, they never are separated. Christ saves his people from their sins, and not in their sins; "and thou shalt call his name Jesus: For he shall save his people from their sins" Matt. i. 21. I don't say, nor would not be understood that I think their is any one lives without <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the best many a christian <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, hath sin <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it to damn him, if it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> way <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

But sin has not the dominion over them; they don't go on in wilful known sins: Sin is their burden and sorrow, I don't say but that a good man may be left to fall: Peter fell, but then he wept bitterly. And so I believe if any true christian is left to fall, it will cost them sorrow. Sin is their grief and hatred: It is folly for any to pretend to have faith, and at the same time, go on in a course of wicked∣ness. James saith, "that faith without words is dead:" James ii. 17. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. A few words to all sorts of hypocrites and false professors: Wo to the hypocrites; read how many woes their is to hypocrites in the 23 Chap. of St. Matthews Gospel. What a dreadful disapoint∣ment it will be for people that look for light, and flatter themselves with hopes of going to Heaven, and at last find themselves mistaken, when their feet come to stumble upon the dark mountains. Where will the hope of the hypocrite be, when God taketh away his soul. What a dreadful dis∣appointment will it be to those who die in great hopes of going to Heaven, and sink down to hell.</P>
<P>As one observes,
<Q><L>"How great will be the sad surprize,</L>
<L>"Of those that die in sin asleep;</L>
<L>"When in hell they ope their eyes,</L>
<L>"Alas! how will they weep."</L></Q></P>
<P>If a man that calls himself owner of a great estate, should by and by find out, that his little want good, and have it all taken away from him, we would be ready to think the man was undone: But what a small matter would that be in comparison of being deceived about going to Heaven: Then the man is undone with a witness. O be exalted in time, to examine yourselves, the Apostle saith, examine your selves, whether ye be in the faith, prove your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates, but it seems as if a great many pro∣fessors might know without much examination, that Jesus Christ is not in them. Jesus Christ was of a meek, lowly, humble forgiving temper and dispo∣sition:
<PB N="19" REF="043017_0018_101CC59CA46598B0"/>
Christ saith, "Father forgive them for they no not what they do." But how many is there that profess to be christians that can't overlook an injury, they are as ready to revenge as any body, they are as proud, lofty, and as worldly as other peo∣ple, nay, is not there some that will steal and swear, whore and get drunk: Is not there some that will lie, cheat, and take advantage of their neighbours. But "wo unto him that buildeth his house by unright∣eousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbours service without wages, and giveth him not for his work:" Jer. xxii. 23. Is there not many think ye, that will go the rounds of duty, they will be very constant to meeting, come up to the or∣dinances, pray in their families, pass for moral ho∣nest folks, they will pretend to a great deal of re∣ligion, and perhaps of love to the brethren, but at the same time, are so covetous and selfish, that they would not give five shillings to save a poor brother from suffering: But true religion don't consist al∣together in these duties that I mentioned, yet I am not a pleading against any of these duties. See what the apostle James calls pure religion: James i. 27. "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself un∣spotted from the world." "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? To loose the bands of wick∣edness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out, to thy house? When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy self from thine own flesh?" Isa. lviii. 6, 7. Read the whole of that chapter: But I would speak a few words to ano∣ther sort of people, is not there some that seem to be enquiring after the truth, they seem to be de∣sirous to know the right way, they seem to stand at the head of two ways, not knowing which way to go. Dear souls their is but one right way, and

that is Christ: Ventur<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon him, there is safety no where else, the whole world is divided into two kingdoms, Christ kingdom, and satans, and you must either be upon one side or the other. Christ saith, he that is not against us, is on our part, there is no standing nuter, and it is a dread∣ful thing to fight under the devils banner: He is a hard master, and there is no way of escape from him, but by being redeemed by Jesus Christ; but may be some may say, I am such a great sinner, I dare not come to Christ before I grow better. Why, that is just as if a man that is very sick should say, I am so sick that I dare not send for a doctor, be∣fore I grow better? Why, as long as you are out of Christ, you never grow no better, but are always growing worse, there is nothing you can do that ever make you any better, if you are a sinner, you are just such a one as Christ came to save. Christ said that he came not to call the righteous, but sin∣ners to repentance: But don't understand that I think that you can come to Christ in your own strength, or of yourself, for Christ saith: "No man can come to me, except the father which hath sent me, draw him:" John vi. 44. It must be by the Almighty power of God, if you are brought home savingly to Jesus Christ. We read, that Gods people shall be willing in the day of thy pow∣er," Psa. cx. 3. "Christ is the author and fini∣sher of our faith," Heb. xii. 2. "For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure," Phil. ii. 13. Well but some may say one thing and some another, some say by works we must be saved, and some say by faith and repentance, and some say by Christ alone: Some say one denomination is right, and some say ano∣ther; some ministers hold one way, and some ano∣ther; well, let the word of God deside all disputes of this sort, leave it out to that, and what that says will stand good forever: What God says is always right. Let God be true and every man a liar, and let his word be your only rule; Christ said, "search

the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which testifie of me," John v. 39. But in the next place, I shall speak a few words to another sort of people, and it is to those who are redeemed out of this estate of condemnati∣on; to those who were made willing in the day of God's power; to those who have had a true faith wrought in them, by the Almighty power of God, that have been ingrafted into Christ, by a true and living faith: And what shall I say to you: O that I knew what words to use, that might be any means of stiring any up to a greater resolution in serving and glorifing God. And Oh! Christian be ex∣horted to consider what a dreadful condition you are delivered out of, and what a happy condition you are brought into; and consider how it was that you was freed, and who it was that redeemed you out of that dreadful condition, and be exhorted to be humble, be not high minded, don't be lifted up in your own conceit; you know that it was no goodness of your own, none of your own doings, but by the free grace of God that ever you was freed; the apostle Paul saith, "for who maketh thee to differ from another? And what hast thou that thou did't not receive?" Cor. iv. 5. And it is by the grace of God, that I am what I am <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a consideration of what Christ hath done and suffer∣ed, quicken you to obedience of all God's com∣mands, and let his glory be your chief aim, strive to copy after your blessed Lord and Master, strive always to follow him, to keep close to him: Come take up your cross daily and follow him; let reli∣gion be your main business, it is to be lamented, that christians in our day, seem to be so cold, so dull and stuped, and so much like the rest of the world, so little concerned for the cause and interest of Christ. The world is divided into two kingdoms, Christ's kingdom, and satans; and how active and diligent does the devils army seem to be: O! it seems as if christians in this day, had need to be ashamed, to see those that have such a hard master, so busy
<PB N="22" REF="043017_0021_101CC5A633D41CB8"/>
and lively, and themselves that have so good a mas∣ter so idle and dull: Let all that are on the Lord's side, be exhorted to rouse up and come forth, and fight the Lords battles.</P>
<P>Contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints; don't be cowards in so good a cause, tho' the flesh, the world and the devil are pow∣erful enemies, yet you have a Captain that can over∣come them all, but then you must mind and keep close to him, keep close to your Captain and you need not be afraid of the devil and all his forces: Follow your Captain, obey all his commands, rely on his strength, don't think to engage alone, for Christ said, without me ye can do nothing, if you rely upon your own strength, as Peter did, it is a wonder if you don't fall as he did, if the free grace of God don't uphold you, you won't stand one mi∣nute. It is all of free grace: It was free grace in God, to contrive the plan of man's redemption: And it was free grace in Christ, to come and un∣dertake in man's room and stead; and it is the free grace of God, to enable any by his blessed spirit, to believe in Christ, with a true and liveing faith: And it is the same free grace to enable any to per∣severe in the way of well doing; and it is the same free grace, to receive any home to glory. So that it is free grace from the foundation to the topstone.</P>
<P>Christian be persuaded to take Christ always for your Prophet, Priest and King: Let him be your Prophet, to teach and instruct you by his word and spirit; and what he teaches you by his word to do, that do and observe; let the traditions and fashions, and customs of the world be what they will. Christ is worthy to be Prophet Priest and King; to be Pro∣phet to teach and instruct: Priest to atone in, that he hath offered up the great sacrifice to atone for all the elect. And he is worthy to be King, to rule in, and rain over every one, and when he teaches and enlightens any by his word and spirit, that such a thing is their duty, and they don't comply with it: Then they rebel; and we read, "to obey
<PB N="23" REF="043017_0022_101CC5A7C3D09000"/>
is better than sacrifice: For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft," <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sam. xv. 22.23. And now, O Christian, that your bad practices serve to harden sinners in their sins. When sinners see those that professes religion, do that, that is not right, they are apt to conclude, that there is nothing in reli∣gion, the world is always a watching for your halt∣ing, their eyes are always upon you. Christ saith, "Ye are the light of the world, a city that is set on an hill, cannot be hid: Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel: But on a can∣dlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven:" Matt. v. 14, 15, 16. Some people say, they don't care what folks say about them; but that is wrong, for we are com∣manded to cut off accasion from those that seek accasion, and to abstain from all appearence of evil: Indeed if we don't give people no just accasion to talk, let them talk, and indeed christians can't ex∣pect no other, but to be talked about, and persecu∣ted, for we read, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution," 2 Tim. iii. 12. And Christ said, marvel not if the world hate you. for you know it hated me, before it hated you if ye were of the world, the world would love it's own, but because I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</P>
<P>But what I say is, christians should be very care∣ful how they give people any cause to talk about them, they should take care how they become stum∣bling blocks to others: A professor by his bad con∣duct, may become a stumbling block, both to saints and sinners, a sinner is apt to say, see their is such a one pretends to be a christian, but I don't see but he is as bad as any body, and so they are apt to con∣clude, that religion is nothing but a name, and christians I believe are many times kept off from their duty, by the bad practices of some that professes such or such a way, they are apt to say I can't think
<PB N="24" REF="043017_0023_101CC5AAB5690110"/>
that such a way is right, there is such a one that professes that way, that will do so and so: But let me causion all, both saints and sinners, not to judge no more after this sort, for this is a wrong way, the bad practices of those that profess religion, never makes that religion, is wrong; religion is the same, let who will profess it. It never makes no right way to be wrong, by bad peoples professing of it: Nor it never made nor never will make any wrong way to be right. By good people's professing of it, and calling of it right, it did not make that Christ was wrong, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his followers when he was upon earth, because that Judas followed him. It would not have done for the rest of the disciples to have said, if this Judas follows Christ, we won't: If they could have known just what a man Judas was, and just how bad he would do: Nor it did not make that Christ was wrong. Peter's denying of him, tho' I don't scruple, but what the rest of the disciples was twited many a time, by their brother Judas, if not by their brother Peter too, tho' Peter was a good man, and had repentance given him, tho' I don't assert it that they ever were twited by them, because I don't know as we have any account of it in the scripture: And since I have spoke of one stumbling block there seems to be some more come in my mind, which people seem to stumble over in this day, partly much as the Jews did, tho' it seems to be off of the business that I undertook, yet per∣haps it may not be altogether a miss, and one thing is, if any one that is dispised by people in general, and called a poor ignorant person: If any such one is brought to understand any thing about religion, and to speak of the things of God; people think it strange, they can't suppose that such a one knows much, they can't think but that such a great man, or learnt man, or good minister should know better then these poor ignorant ones: Strange say they, if such a good man, and such a good minister don't know what way is right, just like the old Jews, they said, "have any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees
<PB N="25" REF="043017_0024_101CC5AC57177BD8"/>
believed on him? But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed:" John vii. 48.49. "Christ thanked his Father, that he had hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes:" Matt. xi, 25. And we read, that not many wise, not many mighty, not many noble are chosen, but the poor mean and dispised, and things that are not to bring to nought, things that are, it seems as if the Rulers and the Pharisees, the great men of the nation had believed on Christ, that the common people would not a scrupled it's being the Christ, they might say if this is the Christ that was provified of by the Prophets: Strange, that the Priest. Scribes and Pharisees that read so much, have not found it out, we poor people have to work for our living, we have not so much time to read and study the scriptures, but we must trust to their say, that know better then we: And so it seems as if a great many people in this day seem to trust too much to what others say and do, and not search for themselves as they ought to do: They say, there is good Mr. such a one, and such a good Minister, that saith, such a way is right, and such a Minister is a learnt man, and he knows better then we: But let whoever hears or reads these lines, be persuaded to search the scrip∣tures, and see for yourselves. Don't pin your faith upon no man's sleave. The Scribes and the Pharisees were mistaken, and why is not great and learnt men in our days, as liable to mistakes as they. It seems if Christ had a come in great worldly grandour, and chosen the Scribes and Pha∣risees, for his discipels and followers and conform∣ed to the customs and traditions of the people. Then the people would fall in with him fast enough; but Christ chose poor fishermen▪ and unlearn't, men to be his disciples: So the Jews said, this people who know not the law, are acursed; and so people in this day, a great many seem to think, that no man has any right to preach
<PB N="26" REF="043017_0025_101CC5B18CA32F08"/>
without he his college learnt, and will conform to all the traditions of the times; but such people are very much mistaken, for Christ will send by whom he pleases, and the word of God is a sufficient rule, for every one of his ministers to go by, as well as for other men, let the fashions, and the traditions of men, be what they will.</P>
<P>But I must return and speak a few words to true believers, and so conclude. And O! Christian be∣liver, consider what a great price, Christ paid for your redemption, to redeem you out of the dreadful estate of condemnation, which we have been a speeking of, which all mankind were plunged into by their sins: And let a consideration of this, quick∣en you to love, fear and obey, and honor him as long as you live, and strive to keep all his command∣ments. The chief Captain told Paul in another case, with great sum he obtained this freedom, but it was with a great sum indeed, that Christ ob∣tained freedom for all his; and let us consider something of what he went through, he left his Fa∣ther's bosom, came down into this lower world, con∣descended to be born of a Virgin, and when he was first born, his best lodging was a manger; and when he grew up, and came upon his public ministry, be∣hold what a treatment he met with from man, when going about up and down in the world, taking ma∣ny a wearrisome step, always a doing some good to the soul or bodies of men. We never read of his doing any hurt to any one: When his disciples spoke of calling for five from Heaven, he rebuked them, and said, ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of, for says he, the son of man did not come to des∣troy mens lives, but to save them: But see what treatment he met with from a wicked world; he was received, contridicted and falsly accused, he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich. He said, "the Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not were to lay his head." He was dis∣pised and rejected of men, a man of sorrow, and
<PB N="27" REF="043017_0026_101CC5B4599898D8"/>
acquainted with grief. Isaiah. liii. 3. And now, let us follow him to the garden, and there, being in agony, he sweats, as it were great drops of blood, falling down to the ground: And then he was taken, led away to the high priest, and there he was mocked at, and spit upon, blind folded and beaten: He was betrayed by one disciple, denyed by another, and forsaken by all? And now, behold him brought before PILATE, false accused and then scourged, crowned with thorns and beaten▪ and after all nailed to the CROSS, there to spill his precious blood.</P>
<P>And how hard hearted and cruel was his mur∣derers, when he was thirsty, they gave him vinegar, to drink, and besides all this that he underwent in his body; Oh! who can think or tell what he under went in his soul; he being in the low place of man, and bearing the punishment that was due to poor sinners to satisfy the justice of GOD. He must bear punishment both in his soul and body. He tells his disciples in the garden, that his soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; and on the CROSS he cry'd out, my God my God, why hast thou forsaken me, it seems as if what he underwent in his soul, hastened him to his death, it seems by what we read, that he died before those that were crucified with him: For when the soldiers came and broke the legs of those that were crucified with him. When they came to him and saw that he was already dead, they broke not his legs. And now, can you find in your heart to sin against such a good and kind God, that hath done so much for you. Be exhorted O believer, to meditate much upon what Christ hath done and suffered to redeem and save you, and when tempted to any sin, say as Joseph did, "How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God," and strive to do your duty in all things, and have regard to all God's commands and not think that there is any of them so small as to be overlook't. Some may say, you tell us about
<PB N="28" REF="043017_0027_101CC5B5E5960A30"/>
keeping the commands, and doing our duty, but you don't tell us what our duty is, some say one thing is duty, and some say another, so we are at a lose, to know what duty is; we should be glad to keep the commands of God, if we knew what they were; well, the best advice that I can give you is. to study the word of God, and pray to him to teach you your duty, by his word and spirit, and enable you to do it, and what God saith in his word, that observe, let men say what they will: Whenever their is a contridiction amongst people, about what is duty, let your enquiry be what saith the scripture, and let that decide all matters of that sort, and let Christ be all in all unto you, and pray God to teach you his will, and enable you to do it, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, for of him and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory forever, AMEN.</P>
