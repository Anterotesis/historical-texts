accounted it no small part of their Re∣ligion, to do suitable Honour to the Me∣mory of their Deceased Saints, especially Martyrs and Faithful Pastors: Now God has said, <HI>Them that honour me, I will honour, 1</HI> Sam. <HI>2.30.</HI> Indeed it is agreeable to the light of Reason &amp; Reve∣lation to perpetuate the Memory of our Worthies, and to mention their Names with due respect. The Wise Man tells us, Prov. <HI>10.7. That the Memory of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust shall be blessed;</HI> And it is a com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and given, Heb. <HI>13.7.

the Living. Here then I shall insert the Just Character of your Reverend Pastor, put in Print by a much better Hand than mine. Viz.</P>
<P><Q>The 22d of <HI>May</HI> last, Dyed the Reverend &amp; Excellent Mr. SAMUEL MAN, Minister of the Gospel at <HI>Wrentham,</HI> in the 72d. Year of his Age; He served in the Ministry there for <HI>Forty Eight</HI> Years, with great Diligence, Prudence, Fidelity, Pains and Chearfulness; tho' under long and great Bodily weakness and In∣firmities, to that degree, that he had not been out of his own Town for 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Years before his Death: He was Born at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and bred at the <HI>College</HI> there; and tho' his Education was attended with some disadvantages, yet by the Blessing of GOD on his hard Studies he attained to very considerable Learning, Divine &amp; Humane, &amp; was very well qualify'd for a more E∣minent Station in the Church of GOD, than where he was placed, and yet from thence his Fame went thro' out
<PB N="iv" REF="002076_0005_0FBB7C70EE794B08"/>
the whole Country. That which made his Face to shine, was his Emi∣nent Holiness before GOD, his Wis∣dom, Prudence, Humility, Meekness and Charity before Men; Modest even to Excess. His Divinity was Solid, Well-grounded &amp; Orthodox, of the Old Puritan Stamp; His Preaching as it was the effect of hard Study, Prayer &amp; Reading: so it proved very Grave, Learned, Methodical and Accurate. His ordinary Sermons were fit for the Press; and yet such his humility, that he thought no∣thing of his worth Publishing. He Lived and Dyed with the Interest of GOD, the Church in General, His Country, and his own Charge in special, much upon his Heart. The Last Sermon he Preached, which was on the First Day of <HI>March</HI> last (being Lord's-Day,) was from those words, Eccl. 1.14. <HI>I have seen all the works that are done under the Sun, &amp; behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="002076_0006_0FBB7C72400DEA80"/>Now this your Dear Pastor being Dead, yet speaketh (as it is said of <HI>Abel, Heb. 11.4,</HI>) And he saith to you as <HI>John</HI> the Elder said to the Elect Lady &amp; her Chil∣dren, <HI>2</HI> Epistle of John, <HI>8</HI> ver. <HI>Look to your selves, that we loose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</HI> The Sum of the Epistle is an Exhortation to Faith &amp; Obedience, the reason is, because there are many deceivers entred into the World, who deny the Lord Christ, and therefore there is great reason th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christians should look to themselves, and that every one that hath attained unto the Faith of God's Elect should look unto him∣self, that he be not deceived of his Faith.</P>
<P>It signifyeth to look at, to see, to look into your selves, <HI>That we loose not the labour that we have wrought,</HI> it might seem rather, <HI>that you have wrought; 1.</HI> Know that divers render it thus, <HI>Loose not the things that you have wrought, but that you may receive your reward;</HI> it being a matter that concerneth every Christian to look unto that, to keep that which he hath wrought.
<PB N="vi" REF="002076_0007_0FBB7C74839678E8"/>
<HI>2.</HI> Take it as it is rendred in our Tran∣slation, and it is to be conceived as an Exhortation of <HI>John</HI> the Elder, as if he were now speaking his last words, &amp; giv∣ing his last Exhortation he was to give, &amp; he speaks as a Minister of the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spel u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to them, that he had taken much pains amongst; as if he had said, We have taken much pains amongst you, and spent our strength among you, but take heed that all be not lost; Thus Christians should look to themselves when they have enjoyed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch means as may be profitable to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alvation, that they loose not the Pains &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abour of their Faithful Teachers that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been amongst them. Both of those senses may be comprehended in the wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds, That Christians must look to themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth that they loose not their own pains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd cost they have taken; And they must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke heed they loose not the pains of God's Ministers amongst them. And so it con∣tains a faithful Admonition unto the People of God, to go on and be constant, keep Faith and a good Conscience, go on and persevere as you have been taught. O know that it is the duty of
<PB N="vii" REF="002076_0008_0FBB7C7539A57240"/>
those of you that have profess'd the Name of God, and have practised Godli∣ness along time, to be exceeding careful that you neither loose your own pains that you have taken in the practice of Piety; nor the pains and labour of your faithful Pastor who liv'd and labour'd with you so many Years: Therefore look that you be soundly rooted &amp; built up in the Lord Jesus, &amp; established in the Faith. Abide in Christ, &amp; let Christ abide in you; As the Branch cannot bear fruit of it self except it abide in the Vine, no more can you except you abide in Christ: You must therefore see that you have a sound and perfect Union with the Lord Christ, that your Souls be truly United to Him, not only that you cleave unto Him, as the Ivy to the Oak, by an outward pro∣fession, or covered with an outward bark and leaves of outward services, but see that y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have a Sound, Evangelical, Myst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Lasting, Everlasting Union to Him; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se you will never endure to the end and be saved; you will never bring forth fruit unto perfection: Where there is a sound root, all is fetched from the
<PB N="viii" REF="002076_0009_0FBB7C7B9A159CC0"/>
root, the branch hath no sap, but what it hath from the root, you must receive all from Christ, <HI>Gal. 2.20. Col. 3.3, 4.</HI></P>
<P>Yea if you would look to your selves that you lose not those things which you have wrought; you must endeavour to maintain your first Light: for as the Light of the New Man is, such is the Life. <HI>Col. 3.10. Eph. 5.8.</HI> Labour to keep your Light clear and distinct, able to discern between things that differ, <HI>Heb. 5.14.</HI> And see that your practice be equal to your light. <HI>Rom. 8.13.</HI> Living after the flesh brings Death. Now your practice doth equal your knowledge, when you constantly and diligently indeavour impartially to observe and do all thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made known, as they are made known unto you. <HI>Jam, 1.25.</HI> Yea your practice doth equal your knowledge, when you most watchfully and accurately observe and charge upon your selves, your own defects, humble your selves for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before God, confess your Sins in them, beg more Grace, justify the rule what∣ever becomes of your faults. Your practice doth equal your knowledge, when you
<PB N="ix" REF="002076_0010_0FBB7C7D00965460"/>
look out to Christ for daily covering with His Righteousness, and for pardon thro' His Blood: And when you daily look to the Spirit of Grace for more strength to mortify the deeds of the Body. <HI>Rom. 8.13.</HI> And to work all your works in you and for you, and to bring to your remembrance the things which you have heard from your Dear deceased Pastor. In a word, Look out heedfully to espy the first beginnings of the decay of God∣liness in its first light and practice: as David did, <HI>Psal. 119.59, 60. I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy com∣mandements.</HI> Oh! Be sure you m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Trade with Heaven in person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> private, secret Communion, in the con∣stant performance of secret duties. What made <HI>David</HI> Eminent with God? was it not constant secret duties? <HI>Psal. 55.17. Evening and morning, and at noon will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</HI> O Trade with Heaven, in Reading, Meditation and Prayer; Take your time to visit so dear
<PB N="x" REF="002076_0011_0FBB7C7E73BD5C80"/>
a Friend, so sweet a Saviour, so Glorious a God that expects and requires it.</P>
<P>In a Word, and so I close, O Look unto God in Christ for supply of his Spirit: All is from the same Spirit, He quickens, when you are dead, He enlightens, when you are dark, He upholds, when you are ready to fall, He restores, when you are faint or decay. He effectually leadeth into all Truth. Be Earnest with God to put his Spirit into you and yours, and cause you &amp; yours to Live; Now that you and yours my be filled with the Spirit, and may receive Spiritual profit and Soul advantage by the following Discourses, is the Fervent Prayer of,</P>

<P>IN the Words of our Text we have the <HI>Disciples</HI> of <HI>John</HI> in their tears and sorrow, at the sad news of <HI>He∣rod</HI>'s beheading of their <HI>Master</HI>; Whereupon, (1) They took up <HI>his Body</HI>; and this they did in testimony of respect to their <HI>Master,</HI> and in testi∣mony of their owning his Doctrine, &amp; grateful Remembrance of <HI>him.</HI> (2) They Buried <HI>it.</HI> The Bodies of the Saints should have an honourable Burial.

all to bring themselves nearer to JESUS; So they pass out of the School of <HI>John,</HI> into the School of <HI>CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>From the Words of the Text take this Doctrine.</P>
<P>DOC, <HI>WHEN a Burning Shining Light is Extinguished or Removed, then the Bereaved should go and tell our Dear JESUS of their sad and sorrowful Cir∣cumstances.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the Method the Disciples of <HI>John</HI> took when they were so sur∣prizingly Bereaved. And this is your Case this Day. Your Eminent &amp; Excel∣lent <HI>Pastor</HI> is called home by Death, and you have (as the Disciples of <HI>John</HI> did) honourably laid up his Remains in the silent Grave; &amp; now your Duty is to tell your Dear JESUS of your desolate state: You are as Sheep without your Under-Shepherd.</P>
<P>TO clear up this Doctrine take Four Propositions.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>SOME of CHRIST's Faith∣ful Ministers are Bright Burning and Shining Lights. John</HI> is styled so, <HI>Joh.</HI>

5.35. They are Stars in the Right Hand of CHRIST, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.20. <HI>They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever,</HI> Dan. 12.3. This Glory is the same for kind, but not the same for degree; Some shine as the brightness of the Firmament, some as the Stars; the Stars shine more brightly than the Firmament; and amongst the Stars also there is great variety. 1 Cor. 15.41. <HI>There is one glory of the sun, &amp; another glory of the moon, &amp; another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.</HI> They have interest in all the Grace and good Fruits of those that are Converted and Edifyed by them; they beget them, they nurse them, they comfort them; therefore their Reward shall be exceeding glo∣rious, 1 Thes. 2.19. <HI>For what is our hope or joy, or crown of rejoycing? are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming: for ye are our glory &amp; joy,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.14. Indeed E∣minent, Pious Gospel-Ministers are
<PB N="6" REF="002076_0017_0FBB7C8A5820FC98"/>
Spiritual Ecclesiastical Fathers in res∣pect of the Dignity of their Office; They are CHRlST's Embassadors, that have the Word of Reconciliation com∣mitted unto them. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.18, 19, 20. They are Stewards of the Mysteries of CHRIST, &amp; are so to be accounted of by the People. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.1, 2. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.7. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.10. Yea, they manage them∣selves as good Stewards of the mani∣fold Grace of GOD. Yea, Saints in all Ages and Generations have loved, honoured, &amp; esteemed Pious &amp; Eminent <HI>Ministers</HI> as bright <HI>Lights</HI>; they con∣sider what CHRIST Himself saith to Gospel Ministers; <HI>He that receiveth you, receiveth Me, and he that receiveth Me, receiveth Him that sent Me,</HI> Mar. 9.36, 37. Luk. 9.48. Saints receive them gladly. <HI>Act.</HI> 21.17. They count them worthy of double Honour, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. <HI>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tydings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tydings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith to Zion, thy God reigneth,</HI> Isai. 52.7.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002076_0018_0FBB7C8C8B548B10"/>PROP. II. <HI>HOW Bright &amp; Burning soever the Choicest Servants of CHRIST in the Ministry may be, yet they are but for a Season here.</HI> Joh. 5.35. <HI>John</HI> was a burning and a shining Light; and ye were willing for <HI>a season</HI> to rejoyce in his Light. As bright a Light as <HI>John</HI> was, yet he gave Light but for a Season; for he was soon Beheaded by <HI>Herod,</HI> as in our context, &amp; so this Light was Extinguished. <HI>Aaron</HI> must go up into Mount <HI>Hor</HI> in the sight of all the Congregation, and there be disrobed of his Priestly Garments and Die, <HI>Num.</HI> 20.25, 26, 27, 28. <HI>Your Fathers where are they? And the Prophets do they live for ever?</HI> Zech. 1.5. The most Eminent and Excellent of Ministers must put off their clay Tabernacles, that they may be cloathed upon with their House from Heaven, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.1, 2. Hence saith the Apostle Paul, <HI>For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,</HI> Phil. 1.21. The number of their Months (in the Ministry as well as in the World) is with God, &amp; He sets bounds to their Ministry. The same Apostle
<PB N="8" REF="002076_0019_0FBB7C8E06648920"/>
saith, <HI>I am note ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand, I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Hence∣forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day: &amp; not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing,</HI> 2 Tim. 4.6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>WHEN this Bright Shin∣ing Light is Extinguished, the Bereaved should bitterly lament their Loss, &amp; be deeply humbled under the mighty Hand of GOD Bereaving them.</HI> Thus it was with <HI>John's</HI> Disciples in our Text &amp; context. Thus <HI>Elisha</HI> laments the Translation of <HI>Elijah,</HI> 2 Kin. 2.12. <HI>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My Father, my Father, the Chariot of Israel, &amp; the Horsemen thereof.</HI> Ingeminations, or doubling of words are frequent in Scripture, importing much vehemency &amp; intenseness of spirit in him that speaketh. <HI>My Fa∣ther, My Father!</HI> This appropriating possessive <HI>pronoun</HI> [<HI>My</HI>] has a kind of deliciousness in it, &amp; breaths abun∣dance of affection, &amp; carries an accent
<PB N="9" REF="002076_0020_0FBB7C8F89D30B90"/>
of profound veneration. <HI>Luther</HI> said, the sweetness of the Gospel lies in <HI>pronouns:</HI> as when a Believer can say (with believing <HI>Thomas) My LORD</HI> &amp; <HI>my GOD!</HI> Those things or Persons which we love most we call <HI>ours</HI>: to say such an one is <HI>mine,</HI> is as much as to say, he is much <HI>beloved,</HI> much <HI>prized</HI> or <HI>esteemed</HI> by me, he, as it were, lies next my heart. Propriety raiseth esteem. <HI>Elisha</HI> calls him Father, for his Fatherly affection to him, and for his Fatherly authority, which by his Office he had over him. <HI>Joash</HI> the King of Israel acknowledgeth this concern∣ing <HI>Elisha</HI> when fallen-Sick of his Sickness whereof he dyed, and weeps over his face, and says, <HI>O my Father, my Father, the Chariot of Israel, &amp; the Horse∣men thereof,</HI> 2 Kin. 13.14. This Church and Congregation may thus bitterly lament over their Dear Deceased Pastor, and say, <HI>My Father, my Father, the Chariot of Israel, &amp; the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsemen thereof</HI>: He was the <HI>Chariot</HI> of <HI>Wren∣tham</HI> and the <HI>Horsemen</HI> thereof, in a peculiar manner, who by his holy Ex∣ample,
<PB N="10" REF="002076_0021_0FBB7C91F0B3DD70"/>
and Counsels, and Prayers, and Power with God, did more for the defence &amp; preservation of <HI>Wrentham,</HI> than all their other Warlike Provi∣sions.

Hence said CHRIST, <HI>Great is thy faith; be it to thee, as thou wilt,</HI> Mat. 8.2. The efficient cause of their Prayer it is the <HI>Spirit of Christ.</HI> He teaches them to Pray and assists them in Prayer. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26, 27.

He leadeth them by the Hand, and therefore they will not be put off. There is a <HI>Spirit</HI> above the Spirit of Man, and not below the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> that acts them in such Prayers; He gives them to repent, believe, submit,

and to be importunate, &amp; they cannot let GOD alone, &amp; therefore it is no wonder tho' GOD hear them. The Sub∣ject-matter of their prevalent Prayers, it is neither less nor more then what CHRIST hath determined to bestow upon them; and He is more willing to give than any Mans heart can be willing to receive. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.27. And the <HI>Spirit</HI> in them maketh intercession according to the will of GOD, for Grace &amp; Mercy to help them in time of need. They are not only Men of Faith, but also Men of Prayers.

The true Christian must cast up the account, what he may loose by his consent to be CHRIST's; that so his choice of CHRIST may be a deliberate and full choice, and he may never repent afterwards of the choice that he hath made. It is a rule in the Civil Law, <HI>non consentit, qui non sentit</HI>; He cannot consent that doth not think, understanding and

Our <HI>Lord Redeemer</HI> deals candidly and openly with us, &amp; tells us before hand, what are the worst things that may befall us for His sake. Joh. 16.1, 2. <HI>The time cometh that whosoever killeth you, will think he doth God service.</HI> Now there are some things that the true Christian <HI>must</HI> part with for CHRIST; and those are his Sins and Lusts and all the vicious Pleasures he hath had in them: the true Christian must shake hands for e∣ver with all his sinful Courses &amp; Com∣panions. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.16. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.29, 50. <HI>Ps.</HI> 18.25. And there are other things which the true Christian <HI>may be called</HI> to part with, and give up for CHRIST: It is uncertain whether GOD may actually call the Christian to part with his Liberty, Estate, Relations, &amp; Life for CHRIST: Many are never actually called forth to such Loss &amp; Sufferings; but because many are, and the true Christian may be so called, he must

<P N="1">1. <HI>CHRIST takes notice of the Means of Grace and the Success of those Means because both come from Himself.</HI> The Means of Grace spring from the Me∣diatorial Covenant between His Father and Himself. <HI>Isai</HI> 42.6. &amp; 49.6.

Isai. 49.7, 8. which is God's Speech to Christ about giv∣ing the Day &amp; Means of Grace in ans∣wer to His intercession.

<P>I now proceed to the Second DOCTRINE.</P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>WHEN CHRIST Endea∣vours to gather Persons, especially Young Persons, under the special Wing of His saving Covenant by the Ministry of His Word, and they will not be be gathered, He will severely punish them for their neglect and refusal.</HI> This is plain in the Text.</P>
<P>This Doctrine contains in it these Three following Propositions.</P>
<P>PROP. I <HI>CHRIST Endeavours to ga∣ther Persons, especially Young Pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, under the Wing of His Covenant by the Ministry of His Word.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="002076_0069_0FBB7CEE0425EF78"/>PROP. II. <HI>MANY of those whom CHRIST so endeavours to gather, They will not be gathered.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>THOSE who finally refuse to be gathered under the special Wing of CHRIST's Covenant by the Ministry of the Word, shall be severely punished for their neglect and refusal.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>CHRIST Endeavours to ga∣ther Persons, especially Young Persons, under the Wing of His Covenant by the Ministry of His Word.</HI></P>
<P>Now this Proposition contains Two Conclusions in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Conclusion. <HI>THAT the Ministry of the Word is the Great, Instituted and All-sufficient Means of gatherings Souls under the Wing of Christ's Covenant.</HI> When I say it is the Means of ga∣thering Souls under the Wing of Christ's Covenant; I look on it as an Instrument in the Hand of the Spirit of Christ, whereby He works Faith in the Hearts of Men, &amp; so brings them near to Christ, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der the Wing of Christ. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.15, 16. The Word Preach∣ed is the power of God unto Salvation
<PB N="15" REF="002076_0070_0FBB7CEFA7D5CCB8"/>
to every one that believeth. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14, 17. <HI>How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? So then, faith cometh by hearing, &amp; hearing by the word of God,</HI> that is, by the Word Preached, as you may see in the former verse. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.2, 5. When I say it is a sufficient Means, I mean sufficient without those extra∣ordinary helps of Miracles that for a time were granted to the World, 'till the Doctrine was sufficiently declared &amp; published: sufficient without those extraordinary helps that deluded Souls are looking for, as Visions, Reve∣lations, Inspirations, &amp; Enthysiastick suggestions, &amp;c. <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.30. <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.39. What the Word discovers, I oppose it, to any other discovery of any other thing. No other discovery is a Means of Faith in Christ, &amp; bringing the Soul under the Wing of Christ. As for the Preaching of the Law; the Law indeed may convince of Sin, &amp; so of Soul sick∣ness, and of death, &amp; condemnation.
<PB N="16" REF="002076_0071_0FBB7CF3582FC9A8"/>
2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.7, 8, 9. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.7, 8, 9. &amp; so by the Law we become dead to the Law. <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.19. and so may have its work upon the Heart, to make known Sin, but yet not sufficient to finish conviction; much less to reach conversion. Joh. 16.9. <HI>Of Sin because they believe not.</HI> Gal. 3.22. <HI>But the Scripture hath concluded all un∣der Sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that be∣lieve.</HI> But the Preaching of the Law cannot bring you unto Christ. Here the Gospel &amp; the Ministry of it, is the only sufficient Means to bring the Soul under the Wing of Christ. Gal. 3.1, 2. <HI>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucify'd among you? This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</HI> Isai. 11.10.11, 12. Mar. 16.15, 16. <HI>Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth &amp; is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</HI> The Gospel was committed
<PB N="17" REF="002076_0072_0FBB7CF5E6DE9F60"/>
to Paul to be Preached for the obedi∣ence of Faith among all Nations for His Name. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.5. To prove that the Gospel, specially as Preached has the sufficiency of a Means,</P>
<P>Argu. 1. THAT the Ministry of the Word is the All-sufficient Means of gathering Souls under the Wing of CHRIST's Covenant appears <HI>from the Universallity and Antiquity of these Means.</HI> Thus Adam and Eve were brought under the Wing of Christ. <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. Joh. 8.56. <HI>Your father Abra∣ham rejoyced to see my day: and be saw it and was glad.</HI> Luk. 24.25, 26, 44, 45. Therefore the Gospel is the Everlast∣ing Gospel. <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.6. only Preached with this distinction, From the begin∣ning Christ's coming, it was to them in promise; but to us, in performance. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.2, 3, 4.</P>
<P>Argu. 2. <HI>NO other Means were ever effectual without this discovery of CHRIST, and this discovery of CHRIST has been effectual without other Means.</HI> What did the Creation of the World, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20.) but declare GOD's Eternal
<PB N="18" REF="002076_0073_0FBB7CF70D5DFB58"/>
Power and <HI>God-Head</HI>? not the way of Salvation by CHRIST. What did the terrible giving of the Law? What did all the Miracles of Moses, &amp; the Prophets? But the discovery of CHRIST by the Ministry of the Gos∣pel without Miracles, have brought many, yea multitudes under the Wings of CHRIST. Now the discovery of Christ, of His Name, and Truths, and Ways, comprehends all that a Mini∣ster needs to know or preach amongst a People. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.2. It contains the whole mystery of Godliness; both the object of Faith, and whatsoever else is necessary morally as a means, to a gracious change. 1 Tim. 3.16. <HI>With∣out controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justifyed in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory.</HI> This is excellently set forth by the Apostle, in 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all with open face be∣holding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of
<PB N="19" REF="002076_0074_0FBB7CF8956128E8"/>
the Lord.</HI> 2 Cor. 4.1.8. <HI>Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have receiv∣ed mercy we faint not; for we preach not our selves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and our selves your servants for Jesus sake.</HI> 6, 7, <HI>v. For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.</HI> CHRIST in the Gospel is the end of the law for righteousness. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.3.</P>
<P>Argu. 3. <HI>THE discovery of CHRIST in the Gospel, &amp; the Ministry of the Word, is the wisdom &amp; power of GOD to Salvation.</HI> 1 Cor. 18.22, 24. <HI>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness: but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God. It pleased God by the foo∣lishness of preaching to save them that believe. Unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God,</HI> Rom. 1.16. Never look to meet with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Wisdom and Power to save you but in the Gos∣pel.
<PB N="20" REF="002076_0075_0FBB7CFA019F38E0"/>
The Ministry of the Word is the Instrument to convey the Spirit. Gal. 3.2. <HI>This only would I learn of you, Re∣ceived ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</HI> Act. 10.44. While Peter yet spake these words, the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> fell on all them which heard the word. <HI>Act.</HI> 13.52.</P>
<P>Conclu. 2. <HI>CHRIST Endeavours to gather Persons, (especially Young Per∣sons) under the Wing of His Covenant by these Means.</HI> Psal. 34.11. <HI>Come ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear the Lord.</HI> Hence in the dis∣pensation of the Gospel He gives direc∣tion to Young Persons wherewith to cleanse their way. Psa. 119.9. Eccl. 12.1. Act. 3.25, 26. <HI>Ye are the children of the Prophets, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers, saying unto A∣braham, and in thy seed shall all the kin∣dreds of the earth be blessed; Unto you first, God having raised up his Son Jesus, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</HI> Hence He takes care that His Ministers do not discourage but incourage Young
<PB N="21" REF="002076_0076_0FBB7CFB80F91D70"/>
Persons to come under Christ's Wing. <HI>Suffer</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>Little Children to come unto Me, &amp; forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Yea our Lord Redeemer saith to Peter, <HI>Lovest thou me more than these? feed my Lambs,</HI> Joh. 21.15.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>MANY of those whom CHRIST so Endeavours to gather under His Wing, They will not be gathered.</HI> They will not come unto CHRIST that they may have life. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.40.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BECAUSE all the sight they have, is but a carnal sight; therefore cannot produce a spiritual effect, such as coming unto CHRIST and being gathered under CHRIST's Wing.</HI> And this appears both in the Person seeing; even a na∣tural man, not born of the Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.14. <HI>The natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, for they are spiritually dis∣cerned.</HI> And it appears in the imper∣fection of the sight, or act of seeing, upon which all their knowledge is grounded, which is full of errors and
<PB N="22" REF="002076_0077_0FBB7CFD048BD950"/>
mistakes. <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.18. They could not deny but the Feast was good, and the Invitation free and full, but it was not so fit for them at that time. So Felix would hear Paul at a more con∣venient season.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THEY will not be gathered under CHRIST's Wing, because the Arm of the Lord is not revealed to them.</HI> (Isa. 53.1) <HI>or in them, to draw them, &amp; teach them effec∣tually.</HI> Joh. 6.44, 45, 65. <HI>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him.</HI> So that they have no more then flesh &amp; blood (inlightened by a common work) can see. Mat. 16.17. <HI>Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</HI> GOD's not destroying and not mor∣tifying their rebellion is no proper cause of their rebellious unwilling∣ness. GOD owes it not to them, and they fight against the strivings of His Spirit with them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THEY will not be gathered under CHRIST's Wing, because they are under voluntary, &amp; satanical, &amp; penal blindness.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="002076_0078_0FBB7CFECD257E68"/>
They are under <HI>voluntary</HI> blindness; they <HI>will not</HI> believe, they <HI>will not</HI> come under the Wing of CHRIST, they close their eyes, &amp; rebel against the Light, being <HI>willingly ignorant.</HI> Yea Satan the god of this World, blinds the eyes of their minds. 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <HI>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine upon them.</HI> Yea GOD in righteous Judgment pe∣nally gives them up to it; it's a pu∣nishment of their voluntary blind∣ness that they <HI>shall not</HI> believe. Joh. 12.39, 40. <HI>Therefore they could not be∣lieve, because that Esaias <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, &amp; I should heal them.</HI></P>

What then can you expect but wrath, if not saved from it? And how can you be saved from it but by coming under the Wing of CHRIST's Covenant?

your rightful Lord and Lawgiver; and His Commands have an obedi∣ence due to them from you His Crea∣tures, and you cannot with-hold it, without the guilt of Rebellion. Be∣sides, the Gospel takes off all excuse here; because it looks upon you as being without strength in your selves, and has accordingly provided and offered all help to you in CHRIST, whose Spirit is ready and able to do all that is wanting. Your <HI>impotency</HI> lies in your <HI>enmity</HI>; your <HI>weakness</HI> in your <HI>wilfulness</HI>; you <HI>cannot</HI> because you <HI>will not.</HI> Joh. 5.40.

<P>Second Branch of the Exhortation. Oh take heed of counting your selves under the special Wing of CHRIST, when you are not.

Goodness, and only worthy to be de∣sired as a portion for your Self, your Children &amp; Posterity? Do you look upon CHRIST as a most attractive Goodness, drawing the heart, &amp; whole Man, after Him? So that now your Soul gives up it self, and its all to CHRIST and to the power of Christ, desiring to be drawn into and kept in His Arms and Bosom? <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.4.

Indeed the manner of seeing differs in those that are gathered un∣der CHRIST's Wing, from those that
<PB N="32" REF="002076_0087_0FBB7D12AFFEC9F8"/>
are not. The Soul that is gathered under CHRIST's Wing, his sight of Christ is from God's teaching by His Spirit dwelling in him, and enabling him to behold the things themselves; called therefore the evidences and demonstration of the Spirit &amp; power. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.4.10. It is written in the Pro∣phets, <HI>And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard &amp; learned of the Father cometh unto Me,</HI> saith Christ. The Spirit doth hold forth Christ's Glorious Person. His Offices and Benefits before his Eyes; and then the Spirit gives the Man a clear and spiritual sight, to discern Christ that speaks, His Autho∣rity, Truth and Faithfulness. Thus it was with <HI>Sarah, Heb.</HI> 11.11. Through Faith also <HI>Sarah</HI> herself received strength to conceive Seed, and was de∣livered of a Child when she was past Age, because she judged Him faith∣ful who has promised.

hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true: and we are in him that is true; even in his Son Jesus Christ.</HI> Yea the Spirit causeth the Soul wisely to look upon Him, and seriously to consider Him and behold Him intensely. Isai. 65.1. <HI>I am sought of them that asked not for me: I am found of them that sought me not: I said, behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.</HI> So that He beholds the Realities themselves. See Pauls Prayer, Eph. 1.17, 18, 19. <HI>That the God of our Lord Je∣sus Christ, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowlege of him: the eyes of your understanding being enligh∣tened: that ye may know what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints, And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe; according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.</HI> Moreover the Fruit

of this Illumination upon the Soul, that is gathered under the Wing of CHRIST, is, that it works effectually, and transforms the Soul. 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.</HI> It renews the whole Man, &amp; brings forth fruit in the whole Man in new obedience.</P>
<P>THE Soul that is gathered under the Wing of CHRIST has en∣deared Affection to Christ; He is most precious to him; That Soul is taken up with Christ as his Saviour from Sin; from the guilt of Sin, &amp; from the filth of Sin; as a Saviour from the do∣minion of Sin, as well as from the con∣demnation of Sin; He desires to have Christ made of God unto him, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and re∣demption.</P>
<P>HE that is gathered under the Wing of CHRIST, has in him a prin∣ciple of spiritual life; he has the Son, therefore also he has life. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.11,

12. He is mystically one with Christ, he has an inbeing in Christ &amp; Christ in him: but the formal Professor is without Christ: therefore without life; he is a still-born Christian, dead still; whatever else he has attained unto: but he that is gathered under <HI>CHRIST's</HI> Wing, has <HI>in himself</HI> a Well of Water, springing up to Everlasting Life. Joh. 4.14. <HI>Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall ne¦ver thirst: but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of wa∣ter springing up into everlasting life.</HI> This is called <HI>oyl in the vessel.</HI> Mat. 25.3, 4. <HI>They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oyl with them: but the wise took oyl in their vessels with their lamps.</HI> They have the Law written in their heart, as Christ saith of Himself, Psal. 40.8. <HI>I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea thy law is within my heart.</HI> Those that are gathered under the Wing of Christ, they have the Image of Christ. Rom. 8.29. <HI>For whom he did fore know, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the

Gal. 4.19. <HI>My little Children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.</HI> They have an inward bent of heart to know, and do, and to walk with GOD in all His Com∣mandments and Ordinances.</P>
<P>YEA He that is gathered under the Wing of <HI>CHRIST</HI> has the Spirit of Christ to inliven, inlighten, quic∣ken, comfort, sanctify &amp; save him. And he that is gathered under the Wing of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> labours to be, and to abide with <HI>CHRIST</HI> in every state, in every condition and season, and under every relation. Psal. 139.18. <HI>When I awake I am still with thee.</HI> He that is gathered under the Wing of

<HI>CHRIST,</HI> has Communion with Christ in His Righteousness, Sonship, Image, and Glory. He has no expectation of Justification by his own inherent righteousness, but covers himself under the Wing of <HI>CHRIST</HI>'s Righ∣teousness, and is cloathed with that white Robe, Isai. 45.24. <HI>Surely shall one say, in Jehovah have I righteousness and strength.</HI> He has Communion with CHRIST in his Sonship, he is an heir of GOD, and co-heir with CHRIST: He has the Spirit of Adoption which teacheth him to cry <HI>Abba Father,</HI> and this Holy Spirit bears witness with his Spirit that he is a Child of GOD, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.7. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.29. Yea he that is gathered under the Wing of CHRIST, has communion with CHRIST in His Image, he is changed into CHRIST's Image from Glory to Glory. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18.</P>
<P>IN a Word, and so I close, He has Communion with CHRIST (inchoa∣tively) in this World, and (con∣summatively) in the coming

World, in His Glory: He is con∣stantly preparing for his dissolution and translation in order to his full fruition of CHRIST in Glory. He desires that for him to live may be <HI>Christ,</HI> and for Him to dye may be Gain. He saith as in, Phil. 1.21, 22, 23. <HI>For me to live is Christ, and to dye is gain: but if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose, I wot not: for I am in a strait betwixt two; having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.</HI></P>
<P>THUS Examine and prove your selves, whether you are Gathered under the saving Wings of CHRIST, or not.
