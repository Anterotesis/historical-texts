<P>O Master! My dear Master! Can I believe my Old Eyes? Speak, say, Whence comest thou? And by what Magick or supernatural Power do we see one another in this strange new Place? for all the World knows you have been Dead and Rotten in your Grave this Twenty years, and the Unsavoury Relish of that Esteminate Reign which stopt your Breath, has left me without Sence or Memory. Bless me, Sirs! Where am I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observator.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honest <HI>Roger,</HI> My very Heart leaps for Joy to see thee again, once more happy and for∣tunate Event; not less Welcome to me than the Resurrection will be to a Righteous Spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Resurrection Spirit! Mercy on me! What's all this? I cannot for my blood call to mind when I dyed, or the time when these old Bones were cram'd into a wooden
<PB N="4" REF="002794_0002_0FE63A1BDA583F58" MS="y"/>
Coffin. I have often heard, indeed, our Curate tell mighty fine stories of a Resurrection, do you call it, and a very pretty New World flowing with Milk and Honey, where he, poor good natur'd Man, undertook to introduce all the Parish; and who knows but this same Curate of ours, who (I'll say for him) in a Cann of <HI>Old October</HI> made his way as good as he look'd, may (as he then promis'd) have given me a lift into this same New World of his; would to God I could but see his bright face here to solve all my Doubts, as he us'd to do; for he was a clever man in his way, and was always telling such pleasant Stories, it did ones heart good to hear to him.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Roger! Roger!</HI> I see its thy own self indeed, for thou wast always a Wag, and canst not give over thy old Itch of perverting the true Sense and Meaning of thy Friend's plain Words. But upon this surprizing Ren∣counter, let us post-pone all Wit, for a little, until we first understand where we are, and what has brought us unto this New World, as you call it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, faith, Master, as for my part, I pretend to no Wit, and as little Judgment at these years; but I have a wounded mind to know how (the Devil) you are come to Life again, and whether We are both risen from the Dead, as our Curate us'd to tell us, or not.</P>

<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Roger,</HI> Thy impertinent Curiosity
<PB N="5" REF="002794_0003_0FE63A2160DC9CE8"/>
was always invincible, and therefore to ease thee of thy Pain, as well as to put an end to thy Jargon, You must know, I am not Dead, as thou wouldst seem to believe; but for certain Political Reasons, it was only given out, that I actually dyed about the same time you heard it in the Country; and after Nine∣teen years close Retirement, and Application to the study of human Nature, I was charmed with some Accounts of that Ease and Freedom both in Religion and Government, which People here enjoy; and so puting a small Purse of Gold, which I had penuriously saved into my Pocket, I went on board the first Ship that presented for this Place, in order to pass the little Remainder of my Days in greater Peace, and in doing more good than I could propose to my Self at home.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rog.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ods Budkins, <HI>My dear Master,</HI> You Revive my old heart, and I perfectly feel my strength Return, at the sight of you: I came over here meerly to humor a young Booby of a Son of mine, call'd <HI>Humphry,</HI> who like a Changeling, as he is, could not be content with my little Cottage in <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> where it is well known his poor Mother <HI>Joan</HI> and I earn'd our Bread honestly by hard Labour, and liv'd lovingly together above Forty years; but, alas! she is dead and gone, and I am, for want of strength, or any thing else, left to help
<PB N="6" REF="002794_0004_0FE63A21637CDAA8"/>
my Self, Reduced to the Necessity of gadding abroad, the Lord knows where, after a young Fellow in his pursuit of foolish Projects; for, <HI>Master,</HI> you are a Man of Experience, and very well know, that altho' the young Folk take Us to be Fools, yet We certainly know Them to be such; and it is an old and true say∣ing, <HI>Fools are fond of Changes.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Friend <HI>Roger,</HI> you seem to be too hard upon the young Man, for I have formerly heard you say, he was a hopeful Boy, and very inclineable to be industrous, and to follow your Example in every thing. Now you must know, <HI>Roger,</HI> that tho' these Countries are scarce known to the People of <HI>England,</HI> when you was a Youth, yet by the Inginuity and Labour of <HI>English Men,</HI> they are of late years brought to such Perfection as to be Serviceable to their Mother Country in many Things, for which Reason the People and Parliament of <HI>England</HI> have admitted them to enjoy the same <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> with themselves, whereby they are in fact <HI>Free Sub∣jects of England,</HI> the very same as you and I can pretend to be, at this Day. Now your Son <HI>Humphry</HI> inheriting, as I suppose, the same Sense of Interest which you had at his Age, and being well inform'd that his Labour here is worth three Times as much as it is in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> he very judiciously proposes to Support both himself and you Three times better than he could have done at home.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="002794_0005_0FE63A234328EA08"/>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be all very true, <HI>Master,</HI> for ought I know, and I wish it may prove so; But I have been now here in this Town two Weeks, and altho' I have not wanted for Meat, Drink nor Lodging, yet, methinks, the Peoples Manners and way of Dealing is quite different from the <HI>Old English</HI> Fashion of plain down∣right Honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not been, as yet, on shoar two hours, and pleased at this Lucky Oppor∣tunity of meeting such a trusty Friend, before I could deliver any of my Recommendatory Letters, prethy, therefore, <HI>My dear Roger,</HI> in thy wonted free manner go on and tell me the Adventures you have met with since you land∣ed, and what you think of the Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, faith, <HI>Master,</HI> to be free with you, for what I have seen, it does not answer the Character I had of it; for instead of a Plain Sincere Well-meaning People, free of all Pride and Luxury, I do not see but they Pamper, Strut, Back-bite and Sharp upon one another, even far beyond the <HI>Londoners</HI> them∣selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be so <HI>Roger,</HI> Things have been strangely Represented to me; for I was told, that the late <HI>William Penn,</HI> or <HI>Sir William Penn,</HI> as some call him, who was known to be a very Wise and Generous Hearted Man, had so Projected and Contrived the Foundation and Government of this Colony, that every thing,
<PB N="8" REF="002794_0006_0FE63A586427CC60"/>
both with respect to Publick and Private Bus∣ness, did gradually and equally move in the Moderate Prudent Way of the <HI>Quaker Oeconomy,</HI> and that, you know, in <HI>England,</HI> has been al∣ways agreeable to our antient <HI>Whig Principles,</HI> which (I am sorry to say it) are but little minded now-a-days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Master, <HI>William Penn,</HI> or <HI>Sir William Penn,</HI> let him be what you please, he has been hugiously Mistaken in his Notion of Government; for altho' I agree with you, that our <HI>English Quakers,</HI> in a general way, are a very plain, honest good People in all their Dealings, and have ever shew'd a strict Re∣gard to the Settlement of the Crown in the <HI>Protestant Line,</HI> which God long preserve, yet they are Folks, as our Curate us'd to say, are <HI>Well Skill'd in the Wisdom of this World,</HI> and know <HI>How to Ʋse the Mammon of Ʋnrighteousness,</HI> under a Great and Wise Government that keeps a tight Reign; but here, where some of them think they have got into the Saddle, Nature seems to work, and they forget from whence they came, or to whom they belong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I am not altogether mis-informed, <HI>Roger,</HI> there are men of Sobriety, good Learn∣ing and Sense amongst the <HI>Quakers</HI> here, and I am Surprized, that such men as these do not take Due Care of the Manners of their People, or at least that publick Affairs be Decently managed, and a good Decorum kept.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="002794_0007_0FE63A619AFCCC58"/>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wounds, <HI>Master,</HI> why there's the thing now! for according to the best of my Infor∣mation, since I have been here, it is these very same men of Learning, but not of Right <HI>English Sense,</HI> that has bred lately a deal of Mischief amongst the People of this Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be, <HI>Roger</HI>? for it must be Universally acknowledged, That good Learning is the truest Foundation of all Im∣provements whatsoever; nor indeed can any be made to Purpose without a Competent share of Letters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in truth, so I have often heard our Curate say. But then, how do you make this agree with the old Proverb, <HI>That too much Learning makes a Man Mad</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, perhaps, is not so very dif∣ficult as you may Imagine; for if we say, that such a One is a man of great Sense and Learn∣ing, it is meant, that he has acquired a sufficient Knowledge in Letters, to make the most of that share of good Natural Understanding God has given him, and such Men generally are fittest to exercise the first Offices in Society &amp; Government, because their minds are com∣monly bent rather upon a Necessary and Use∣ful Knowledge in Life, than upon that which is meerly Speculative &amp; Scientifical. But when we say, such a One is a very studious Man, and a great Schollar; That he is a great Mathe∣matician or Philosopher, and a Compleat Ma∣ster
<PB N="10" REF="002794_0008_0FE63A619DA3F788"/>
of <HI>Crit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scism</HI> in all the Languages, then we Conceive the Idea of One fit to be at the head of a University, but by no means Qualified to govern Mankind in a Civil Society; for if ever such a One as this was to be put on a Throne, or attempt to Officiate in the Post of Secretary of State, or the Governour of a Colony, he would Instantly be for Acting the part of a <HI>Roman Emperor</HI> or a <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and would so much despise Constitution of Laws made by Men les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Learn'd than himself, that the generality of my People now, would most certainly con∣clude, he was Mad. And it is from Excesses of this kind, that the Proverb you mention has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully taken place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger,</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then <HI>Master,</HI> as sure as you are Alive, that must be the very Case here; for an honest Trades-man told me over a Tankard of good Punch, the other Day, that there was a Certain <HI>Quaker</HI> in this place, who had a huge Reputation for being a mighty Schollard; But withal, had an Unruly Itch to be a continually Dabling in Politicks, and medling with other Folks Affairs; Nay, he Assured me, that the same learn'd <HI>Politician,</HI> had l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly publish'd a <HI>Manifesto,</HI> declaring, That the Governour of this Place had no right to Speak to the Assembly, which Represents the People here, just as our House of Commons does in <HI>England,</HI> nor to pass any Bills sent up to the Governour from that House, into Laws,
<PB N="11" REF="002794_0009_0FE63A62A20657A8"/>
without his Consent; for, that as he had, with∣out all Doubt, more Learning then any body Else, he was therefore the most Proper Person to make Speeches, Frame Laws, and to Inter∣pret them after they were made. And further, as my Friend told me, he Claimed by the said <HI>Manifesto</HI> an Indefeazible Right to be <HI>Hereditary</HI> keeper of the Seal of this Government, and treated a worthy honest Gentleman, the pre∣sent Governour, with most <HI>Scurrilous Language,</HI> because he would not deliver up the Seal into his hands, and go Blindfold into whatsoever he Proposed. who can Imagine then, but as you say, Master, The honest well meaning People must think such an Extravagant Fellow to be horn-mad; for my part I never heard of the like, except at <HI>Bedlam Hospital</HI> many Years ago, where <HI>Oliver's Porter</HI> used to Rant upon Kings and Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Roger,</HI> You tell me strange things indeed; but surely that Trades-man or Friend of yours, be he who he will, must have had some Personal Pique or Partial Disgust to the Person you mean; for I can guess who you mean, by the Character I received of him in <HI>London;</HI> and, if I am not mistaken, I have a Letter in my Pocket directed to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, <HI>Master,</HI> I neither know, nor care to know who he is; for I have been bred a poor Labouring Man all my Days, and have no fancy to be acquainted with great Folks,
<PB N="12" REF="002794_0010_0FE63A575EF89AA8"/>
or to keep Company above the pitch of a plain Country understanding; but if my Friend spoke any thing out of a grudge, then your great Schollard has disobliged many more than him in this Town; for I think I have been almost every Night, since I came here, in a different Company, that at no time consisted of less than Seven, and for the most part of double that Number; but I never yet heard one good word spoke of that same Great Man; on the other hand, they all agree, that he carries about him, in his very <HI>Gate</HI> and <HI>Phiz,</HI> such a a <HI>wounded Conceit of his Own Person,</HI> that he can∣not condescend to be <HI>commonly Civil</HI> to his Bet∣ters or Equals, and disdains to be at the trouble of shewing the least <HI>Humanity</HI> to those below him: In short, if I be rightly informed, he seems to think that Mankind in all stations of Life cannot be imploy'd to so good Purpose, any other way, as in executing the Projects of his Brain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyda, <HI>Roger!</HI> Where art going? To describe a <HI>Compleat Tyrant</HI> over Human Na∣ture? I thought there had been none such in these parts of the World, else we might have better staid at Home, than come hither in quest of Liberty. But knowing thee to be a very honest Man, &amp; an entire Lover of the Country's Freedom, I must take time to enquire a little concerning this odd Account of Matters which you have related to me. Besides, it draws near to
<PB N="13" REF="002794_0011_0FE63A62A4527A28"/>
Bed-time, and I am not a little Fatigued with having been above eight Weeks coop'd up in a small Cabbin on Ship-board; but if thou will favour me with thy Company to Morrow Night, at the usual time of meeting over a Pot of good Liquor, I shall have deliver'd all my Letters, and, perhaps, may be better prepar'd to proceed further in our Inquiries.</P>
</SP>

<P>With all my heart, good Master, so be it, and I wish you a good kindly Repose.</P>

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>WEll, <HI>Master,</HI> you are a Punctual Man, for I had but just lighted my Pipe as you came to the Door, and my very Guts yarn'd to tell you a piece of News which I have just heard, and for which every Soul I met with in the Streets seem'd to be heartily sorry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observator.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely it must be some-what of Moment, that gives such a general Concern. Pray, what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Master,</HI> it is certainly true, that there is either a New Governor for this Place actually arrived at <HI>New-York,</HI> or, which is the same thing, he will be here in the next Ship from <HI>London.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="002794_0012_0FE63A2346CCC8A0"/>
<SPEAKER>Observa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell how to believe it, for its but 24 hours since I arrived here directly from <HI>London,</HI> and there was no such Report there when I came away, nor any grounds for it, I remember, indeed, to have heard one or two little Fellows, who had lately com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over from these Parts, Prate in the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>-House as if they did not like the present Go∣vernor, and hoping he would soon be Remo∣ved; but they talk't after such a silly manner that no body minded them; and I am sure of it, that amongst People of the best Judgment, the Governour's whole Conduct here, and especially his Extraordinary good Mannage∣ment with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and his great Regard to <HI>Liberty of Conscience,</HI> as well as to every part of <HI>Natural Justice</HI> and <HI>Equity,</HI> was much Commended; and I really took a great deal of Pleasure to hear some particular Conversation on that head, altho' I was altogether a stranger to the Gentlemans Person &amp; Character before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, <HI>Master,</HI> it does not fall into my way to be acquainted with such Things in <HI>England,</HI> but this I know, that if, as you say, the present Governour had such a good Name at Home, he has a much greater, and more general One here; for I have not met with either Man, Woman or Child, that does not speak Affectionately of him, as if he was a <HI>Father</HI> to the whole Country, and, Methinks, 'tis pity that such a Man should be Removed without very good Cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="002794_0013_0FE63A1422568ED0"/>
<SPEAKER>Observa.</SPEAKER>
<P>These things will frequently hap∣pen, <HI>Roger,</HI> so long as there is such a Trade of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishing for Publick Posts of Trust and Profit, which are generally obtain'd now-a-days with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntent to save Money to some, and to get it for others; but I can't help being sorry when any honest Gentleman, much more a whole Country happens to suffer by such means. It is a bad Omen, <HI>Roger,</HI> and portends no good to the State, when a less skillful Cook comes to have the mannagement of the Kitchin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is all true, Master; but if I be rightly informed, this same Government here is not an Office of that Nature which you speak of, being the Nomination of the Gover∣nour is in the hands of a Subject, and his Pro∣fits or Sallary entirely depends upon the People themselves, from year to year, according to his Behaviour; so that what can a Courtier get by putting any Creature into this Office, who will not do their Duty to the Peoples Satisfa∣ction, as, undoubtedly, he ought to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly. <HI>Roger,</HI> I must own I did not know so much of this Constitution be∣fore, as you now tell me; and I think it very happy for the People, if it be so, because it in∣seperably unites the Interest of every Governor unto that of the Country, as in all free States it truly ought to be; however, such is the Vi∣cissitude of human Affairs, and the force of Ambition, or something else, that men are
<PB N="16" REF="002794_0014_0FE63A2AE64DB1D0"/>
not always distingiush'd according to their Personal Worth and Merit, but oftner as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tools to be made Use of, in order to serve certain Ends; And it may, from many Exam∣ples, be observed, that Appointments of that kind, in Affairs of Civil Government amongst a free People, seldom or never Succeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but <HI>Master,</HI> Let us suppose then, that one of those same Tools you mention was to come over Governour here, in the room of a Gentleman who is generally beloved, and to whom even his Enemies, for what I hear, can assign no Fault which they dare own to his Conduct, what would be the Consequence, do you think?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if the Constitution really is such as you have told me, the Consequence, in all Probability, would be, that in a Short time the Tool, as you call him, would find himself under some Necessity of Returning Home as great a Fool as he came out; and let High-flyers talk as they please, it is a cer∣tain Truth, That there can be no better Test of a good King or a good Governour, than to possess the Hearts and Affections of the People they Rule over; for that can proceed only from a natural and grateful Sense of the Bene∣fits which from his Impartial Conduct has been equally shared amongst them. And you may depend upon it, <HI>Roger,</HI> that all Men of any Sense &amp; Knowledge, who Despise or Ridicule
<PB N="17" REF="002794_0015_0FE63A6A2AD2BCF0"/>
this very plain Maxim, let them pretend <HI>Con∣science, Religion,</HI> or what else they please, to gull and cheat the Ignorant and Weaker sort of People, it is only a Mask to cover some secret Vice, or to introduce one or more par∣ticular Favourites, who cannot be supported but by an Arbitrary and Partial Power in the Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master, you know it was always my Mind that Kings and Rulers were appoint∣ed for the good of the People; and can any Man tell me who is or can be a better Judge of the Peoples good, than they are themselves? As for your Learned Schollards, tho' perhaps they will not allow Us poor Country Folks to put Our Thinking Faculty in the Ballance with theirs, on many Subjects, which, in truth, We do not pretend to, yet surely they must own, We are made of the same Flesh and Bones, and after the same manner with them∣selves, to that our Sense and Feeling of Hap∣piness and Misery, Justice and Injustice, good Fortune and ill Fortune, are much the same in Us all. And I appeal to you, Master, if a quiet Enjoyment of, and an equal Support under these opposite States in Life, respective∣ly, be not the chief End, if not the whole Business of all Civil Government?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art, <HI>Roger,</HI> intirely in the Right, and I do not think that the Case can
<PB N="18" REF="002794_0016_0FE63A6A2DDBD670"/>
be more fairly stated, or a better Judgment given upon it, than what you have done in a very few Words; Wherefore, I think, at present, we will leave that Subject as it stands, and after a good nights Rest, think of some New Entertainment for to Morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master, I agree, and hope, that by that Time the growth of your Acquaintance in Town will help to enlarge the Conversa∣tion, as you in some measure promis'd last Night at parting.</P>

<P>GOod Morrow, <HI>Master;</HI> I came to enquire how you slept, and if you are perfectly recovered of your Fatigue on Ship-board; for methought, you was walking upon <HI>Society Hill</HI> this morning, as if you was much Cast down and Pensive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am pretty well in health, <HI>Roger,</HI> thank God, but having been to deliver my Letters of Recommendation, I did not very much like the Reception I met with in some places, And therefore took a walk to the Hill, ruminating upon what part I should Act with some folks.</P>

<P>Good now, dear Master, Oblige me with some account of your Visits, and how
<PB N="19" REF="002794_0017_0FE63A6DA0F944D8"/>
you was received; for, to my fancy, they are a mighty Generous, Kind, Hospitable People in this place, and entertain their Friends hearti∣ly. I do Assure you, Master, I have not been suffered to draw my Purse-strings but once since I Landed, and that was only to treat a poor honest Labourer, my fellow Passenger, with a four penny Mug of Beer.</P>

<P>As to Victuals and Drink, perhaps it may be as you say; for that is often lavished away, more out of Vanity than good will; but I met with so much haughty stiff and awkard Pride in those from whom I could least expect it, that I am at a loss what to think of it.</P>

<P>Why then, <HI>Roger,</HI> since you must have it, you must know, that in the first place I went this Morning, about seven a Clock, to deliver a small Pacquet, that I had charge of, to the Governor, and not intending to wait upon so great a Man at that early hour, nor
<PB N="20" REF="002794_0018_0FE5F58038F0EB68"/>
to give him any manner of Trouble, I only deliver'd the Pacquet to a Jolly Ruddy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well look'd Servant at the Door, without leaving my Name, or any Message whatso∣ever; but the Servant at once desired me to walk into the Hall and sit down, told me his Master had been up in his Study above an hour, and would wait upon me presently; and accordingly, in less than three Minutes the Governor came down in his Night Gown, took me by the hand, and sate down close by me; after a few general Questions, of what Passage we had? and if I had heard about what time the King might be expected home from <HI>Hannover?</HI> he call'd for a Dram of very fine Cor∣dial, and drank my Wellcome to the Place: Then he asked me, If I intended to make any stay in Town? To which I answered, That I was come over with design to reside here for some considerable time, if the Air agreed with my Health. He said, he believ'd I needed not doubt but that it would, and assured me, That if it lay in his way to do me any Service, or to encourage my stay in the Place, he would do it with all his heart. I return'd his Honour my very humble Thanks for his Civilities, and went off much pleased with the Gentleman's unexpected, but great Humanity.</P>

<P>Do you see now, <HI>Master,</HI> Was not I in the right of it, about the Governours Cha∣racter?
<PB N="21" REF="002794_0019_0FE63A6D6B5BD698"/>
for this is exactly the manner wherein I was told he generally receives all strangers, that wait upon him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Just share of Affability and Com∣plaisance in a great Man, is a sure sign of a Noble Spirit; and it not only gives lusture to his other good Qualities, but attones for and often decently covers many small Failings. But to proceed, from hence I went in course to wait upon the next Greatest Man of the place, Unto whom, I know, that I was very par∣ticularly and warmly Recommended by Let∣ters from Persons of some Figure and great Substance in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and being Charged to deliver them with my own hand, I desired the servant Maid to acquaint her <HI>Master,</HI> that a Gentleman come over from <HI>London,</HI> in the last Ship, waited to speak with him, and had some Letters for him; but the Maid was imploy'd in celaning the Parlour, and very briskly replyed, That it was not yet the hour of her Masters coming down from his Study, and that if I wanted to speak with him, I might wait in the Porch until he came down; I said, I would, and so sate down upon the Bench at the Door, pleasing my self with Observing the Air and Dress of the People, as they went along. When I had waited about an hour, a Poor Shabby-like fellow called to speak with the Gentleman of the house, but the Maid in a rude Tone bid him be gone, for a sorry follow,
<PB N="22" REF="002794_0020_0FE5F576F850B3C8"/>
as he was, did let think that her Master must be disturbed at this time of Day for such a one as him: The Country Man being thus pro∣voked, made a good dear of Noise in the street, and Complain'd much of the Injustice and Hardship that in many particulars had been put upon him. This disturbance, however, brought the Gentleman down from his study, in his Disabila, being wrap'd in an old rusty dark colour'd Calaminco Night-Gown, which forced my Imagination to represent to my thoughts One of our <HI>London</HI> Conjurers or Fortune-Tellers, only he did not carry so much Temper and Gravity about him, as they usual∣ly do; for he immediately fell open Mouth'd upon the Poor Fellow in the street, and bid him instantly be gone, or he would send him to the Correction-house to beat Hemp, until he should learn more Manners; at which the Country-man scratch'd his Head, and walk'd off. Then the Senator turning himself very Solemnly about towards me, said, <HI>Friend, hast thee any business with me this Morning</HI>? Very little, <HI>Sir,</HI> said I, only a few Letters here from <HI>London,</HI> which I was Charged to deliver with my own hand. He took the Letters, told me, it was very well, and so walk'd up Stairs to his study again, without saying One word more or less. Now, <HI>Roger,</HI> What do you think of this En∣tertainment from One, who, I do assure you, amongst some of the best People in the City of
<PB N="23" REF="002794_0021_0FE63A2AE9633700"/>
<HI>London,</HI> has the Reputation of a man of good Sense, and every body allows him to be Master of a great share of Learning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wounds, Master! I'll be Content to be hang'd, if this be not that very Learned Pragmatical Schollard, that is become a Plague to the whole People here, as I told you at our first meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, <HI>Roger,</HI> you are not mis∣taken; it certainly is the same Man, you meant; and if we may suppose he treats his Neighbours and Acquaintance with an exact Mathematical Proportion of the Civility and Manners which it seems he allows to strangers, I do not much wonder he has obtained such a Character as you then gave of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Pox take those learn'd Schollards, say I, who have so little Knowledge of Them∣selves, as to pretend to things which their very studies, and the pievishness of their own Nature renders them Incapable of. Is it not a fine thing now, that such a Flourishing Country, and a Quiet Industrious People, as this seems to be, should be put all in Confusion for the sake of a <HI>Looby,</HI> who really can act no part in Life, with any Discretion, except it be to dictate unto and Instruct Boys in <HI>Greek &amp; Latine</HI> out of a Pulpit, with such a singular habit, as a Long sleev'd Gownd and four Corner'd Cap.</P>

perform that part, you very Justly have assigned him; and in <HI>America,</HI> where a tolerable E∣ducation for Youth, is so hard to be got, it is great pitty but that the publick should provide a very handsome Encouragement for Imploy∣ing men of his Genius in their Proper way.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Roger, I must own it is a sort of a Bite; for although I have read it, I can find nothing in it, but a dull Recipe for a Poor Devil just got out of Servitude, how to keep himself out of Debt, and a scurri∣lous senseless Pun upon the present Mayor of this City, as they say, who, being of the Tanners Company, it seems, Disobliged the Author two years ago, by not giving him his Vote to be an Assembly man. If there be any thing more meant, it is so wrapt up in the pri∣vate history and Politicks of the Place, that it is altogether Unintelligable to me; besides, it is plain, the Author cannot write <HI>English;</HI> and since he owns, he does not understand <HI>Latine,</HI> I wonder his Friends do not advise him to take up another Trade more suitable to his Capacity.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's True, <HI>Roger,</HI> but we may expect, in vain, to see it; for our Heads will be laid long enough before that happens; Ne∣vertheless, we must remember, it is Our Wis∣dom, as well as our Duty, to be Thankful for the Good, and to bear with Patience the Evil, of our present Lot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, Master, I approve your Counsel, which, tho' I say it, is as good Doctrine as ever was preach'd out of a Pulpit. But, now I think on't, Master, and to divert us from dull and melancholly Reflections, I met with a Skipper this Morning upon the Wharff, Tearing, and Runing about like a Mad-man, because the C—or had seized his Sloop for the Value of half a piece of course Holland that was found in one of the Mens Chests, which the poor Devil had brought home to make his Wife some Aprons. The Mob gathering about the Man, they hearken'd attentively to his story, and at last their Spleen got vent, by ripping up the C—r's Character, at such a Rate, you'd have been amaz'd to hear it; for there was so many particular down∣right Villanies, with the Times, Places and Circumstances mentioned, that one could not
<PB N="28" REF="002794_0026_0FE63A320F11E518"/>
help believing it all to be True. And, me∣thinks, its strange that the Crown shou'd have been so deceiv'd, and the Subject Oppressed for Twenty years together, in such a Port as this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Roger,</HI> if it be so that the Crown is Deceived, I know none but the Mi∣nistry at home that can help it; and therefore, if you please, to them we'll leave it, since it is a plain case, every Master will be served in his own way, and by such as he thinks fit to make use of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Master Observat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,</HI> allowing all that to be Right, as you say, is it not, for all, Hard upon the poor Subject to be Oppressed by Villians, under the pretence of Authority?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Roger,</HI> You must understand, that the Laws of the Land are the only Rule whereby to judge of Oppression, and what is Right or Wrong between Man and Man; now these are, or ought to be, Open unto all alike; and when any Case happens which the Common Law does not fully reach, then Equity and a good Conscience will provide a suitable Remedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks I understand all that very well, <HI>Master;</HI> but what shall a Poor Man do, that has not where-withal to go either to Law or Equity? for you know there is no doing of any Business now-a-days without the ready Penny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the very best Provision for
<PB N="29" REF="002794_0027_0FE63A3A18FA35F8"/>
the Necessity of such Poor Men' is a set of good wholsom Laws well executed, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour or any Partiality whatsoever; for in that Case, no Affluence of Money or other thing will have the least Effect upon the Equal Distribution of Justice; and that is all that an Honest Man, in any Condition of Life, can demand; and which, at this time, renders the Common Law &amp; Constitution of <HI>England</HI> so vastly Preferable to all others in the known World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure it is a Choice Rare Thing, <HI>Master,</HI> to be born with the Liberties and Priviledges of an <HI>English Man;</HI> and yet, for all, if I remember right, I have heard our Curate say, <HI>That in Old Times the Common People in</HI> England <HI>were all born Slaves to the Clergy, Barons, and Great Men of those Times.</HI> Now, how could that be, Master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know, Roger, that be∣fore <HI>Christianity</HI> had taken any deep root in <HI>England,</HI> the Errors of Idolatry, Superstition and Craft, had so crept into the Government of the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> That all Civil Authority, Nay, even Morality it self was intirely Swal∣low'd up by it, insomuch that the Clergy not only got Possession, and a formal Title to half of all the Lands in <HI>England,</HI> but also contriv'd to give the Barons, or great Men of that time, the like Title to the other half, by which means they kept what they had taken to them∣selves
<PB N="36" REF="002794_0028_0FE63A3A1B369938"/>
securely, and Govern'd the whole with an absolute Incomptroulable Sway. So, that as your Curate rightly Observed, the Common People were then born in Vassalage or Slavery, which is much the same thing, without any manner of pretence to a Freehold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger,</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Bless me <HI>Master!</HI> those surely were Dismal Times, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must have be∣come of you or me, do you think, if we had lived in such Days?</P>

<P>If such had been the Will of God, Roger, we must have patiently submitted to his Providence, as many good men, doubtless, then did; but as it is, we Ought to be thank∣ful, and make such use of the History of those Times, and the knowledge wo may learn there∣from, as never to act or consent unto any thing which may in the least contribute to bring the whole, or any part, of such Misery upon our selves or Our Posterity after Us.

<P>Ay, that's true indeed, <HI>Master,</HI> you have Cheer'd me many a time, when my Heart was in my Hose; but if what my Land∣lord told me be true, we are got on the wrong side of the Hedge, and I am afraid this Cli∣mate will soon become too hot for such free-heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Body's as you and I.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alack-a-day, Master! That is not what I mean, it is that same Vassalage or Slavery that sticks in my Gizzard; for my Land∣lord assures me, that a great and a Wise Man, not far from this Town, has been Plodding above these three years upon a Scheme to In∣troduce the <HI>Old English Vassalage,</HI> you was speaking of, into this New Country, which he Affirms, cannot thrive until that be done; and, for my part, I had as lief be a Slave in <HI>Algiers,</HI> as to submit to such a form of Govern∣ment.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be hard indeed, <HI>Roger,</HI> if it was so; yet surely None but a Mad-Man, or a Vagabond, would dare to broach such a thought in a free Country; besides, the thing it self is such a Contradiction to Law, Nature and Common Sense, that it is altogether Im∣practicable, and the very Proposal a meer Jest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so I said, Master, but my Landlord, who is a very honest Civil Man, assured me, that he heard the Gentleman speak of it himself, and he talk'd so big as if he was sure to bring it about speedily; for, they say, he is a very Rich Cunning Man, and sees a great way off, so that he seldom or never

<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>A <HI>Gentleman,</HI> do you say? and a Rich Man?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Master, it is to be hoped that such a mad Attempt will Probably termi∣nate in the Overthrow of the Contrivers; but in the the mean time, both publick and private Interest must suffer considerably, while such mischievous Designs are hatcht and flyly car∣rie'd On by Men of any Credit; wherefore, methinks, it is pitty but such Hellish Schemes should be exposed as soon as they can be dis∣cover'd, and intirely blown Up.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of your Opinion, honest <HI>Roger,</HI> and I do not doubt but the general As∣sembly, or Legislature of this Providence, which, it is said, is to meet very soon, will, for their own sakes, take effectual Care tb discourage all Oppression, and to preserve entire the Just Rights and Liberties of a <HI>Free-born People,</HI> for

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Do with it, say you, Master! why there's no living without it; I buy Bread, Beef, Cloathing, and now and then a Cann of good Beer or a Noggen of right Nants, to Chear up my Spirits after a hard Days work; for it is a clear Case

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, for my part, Master, as to that point I know of none; for I chang'd a Guinea the other day, and Instead of Twenty One Shillings in <HI>English Silver Coin,</HI> the good man of the house gave me Thirty five Shillings in Paper Money, Out of which I bought me a pair of good Buck-Skin winter Breeches, as Cheap as I could have done in <HI>London</HI> for sterling Money; and for what I could Observe at the Club, Meat and Drink of the same kind and goodness may be had for less Value here in <HI>Paper Money,</HI> than can be got for Silver Mill'd Coin in <HI>England,</HI> and if so, let the World wag, I say, and every Man Praise that Bridge over which he Passes Securely.</P>

<P>I must own your Observations

are very good so far; but those who have a publick Care upon them, must look a little farther, and see that there be no fallacy at the bottom in matters of that kind; for you may remember not long ago, when <HI>South-Sea Stock</HI> was sold for Ten Times its Value in ready Cash, altho' the Nation and Government of <HI>Britain</HI> was at the same time within an ace of being ruined by that Bubble.</P>
</SP>

<P>Ah, <HI>Master,</HI> well do I remem∣ber it, and we Poor Folk then thought we were all directly going to be made Lord Mayors and Aldermen; but, say I, a Pox take the State Contrivers of that Gin to catch Woodcocks, and Thanks be to the honest Parliament that pluck'd our feet out of that Snare, else, as you say, Master, we had been Ruin'd as sure as a Gun.</P>

<P>If so, then <HI>Roger,</HI> Why should not we enquire a little into the Nature and Credit of this same Paper Money here? for, altho', as you Observe, it very well serves for present use, yet there may be a Snake in the Grass, and it is the part of every

<P><HI>Roger,</HI> you speak like an honest quiet Fellow, and a good Subject, as you have always been; I, for my part, have not yet had time to be sufficiently Perpraed for such a Work as you now assign to me; But at more leisure I do intend to bestow a few serious Hours upon it, and shall not be wanting in any thing within the small Compass of my Capacity to do the Country real and good Service.</P>

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>MAster <HI>Observator,</HI> I want very much to speak with you; pray step into this next House, and let us drink one Mug together this Morning; for I have a grievous Complaint to make con∣cerning my poor Boy <HI>Humphry,</HI> who, I think, has been very ill used by some of your great Leading Men here, and their Under-strappers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter, <HI>Roger?</HI> I am sorry to hear that poor <HI>Humphry</HI> should meet with any Discouragement; I thought he had got his Ax on his shoulder and been at work in the Woods; for I know he's a sober Lad, and eats no idle Bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, so he is, <HI>Master,</HI> and I thought I had done very well for him, upon our arrival, the very first week
<PB N="40" REF="002794_0038_0FE63A7EF0E96490"/>
here, when I Purchased three Hundred Acres of good Rich Land, from an honest Country-man in <HI>Bucks County,</HI> about Twenty Miles from Town; I am sure it cost me Fifty good Guineas in Gold, be∣sides two to the Scrivener for drawing the Deeds, and a good Supper at the close of the Bargain; and yet, for all, we are like to be Trick'd out of it, for what I can see, by an Old half hanged ill looking Dog, who keeps the Books of what they call a Land-Office in thir Town. Now, <HI>Master,</HI> you know, in <HI>England</HI> every Free-holder keeps his Writings or Deeds for his Land himself, in a good Iron Box or strong Chest; but this Gallimafry will have it, that our Deeds are good for no∣thing because the Return of the Survey was not in due time (as he says) Record∣ed in his Office upon the Books; and the Old Rogue pretends it is too late now, because, forsooth, (the Land being very good) he has taken care to have it Re∣surveyed, and a Return duly entred upon his Books, in another Mans Name. And now, <HI>Master,</HI> is not this, do you think, a very hand Case upon the poor Boy
<PB N="41" REF="002794_0039_0FE63A7EF518F8C8"/>
<HI>Humphry,</HI> who has almost Cry'd his very Eyes out of his Head about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems to me to be a very hard Case indeed, <HI>Roger,</HI> and according to my slight Notions of such Things, I cannot see how the superficial Neglect of a Surveyor for not Returning the Perform∣ance of his Duty into a certain Office, at a certain time, should invalidate a Prior and give a legal Preference to a Posterior Right to Lands, which in <HI>England</HI> we hold to be the most Sacred and Valuable of all Property whatsoever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Master, in <HI>England,</HI> you say Right, no such thing could be suffer'd or born with; for it is to be seen very lately, how our just and good Parliament at Home can Trounce even a Lord High Chancellor for Defrauding the Subject, and Invading their Rights. But, Alas! <HI>Master,</HI> if I be rightly informed, it is not so here, where we are told, the Soil originally belongs to a Proprietary, and this same Proprietary keeps an Agent or Secretary, as some call him, to Sell these Lands for ready Money; and this
<PB N="24" REF="002794_0040_0FE63A46CB7F40A8"/>
same Secretary keeps Two Under-strap∣pers at one Table in his Office, the one to make out and Return Surveys, while the other is striking or Recording of Patents, or Original Deeds, all which you may see them Toss from one to ano∣ther, as if they were shuffling a Pack of Cards at Put; so that an honest Country-Man has but a poor Chance for his Money amongst such a parcel of Rooks, who are Absolute in their Mannagement, with∣out any manner of Check or Controul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou givest a very odd Ac∣count of this Land-Office, <HI>Roger;</HI> surely the Proprietor must have a careful Audit upon these Officers Accounts, if he puts any Value upon his Property here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Master,</HI> the Proprietor, they say, is a very Worthy Honest young Gentleman, of Spirit enough, but having a good Estate at home, he likes <HI>Old England,</HI> and does not much Trouble himself about the state of his Private Affairs here, which this same Cuning Agent has Artfully involved, by raising
<PB N="43" REF="002794_0041_0FE63A4CCA67BA10"/>
a Claim upon it from some younger Bran∣ches of the Family, who are at Law with the Heir, which is a fair opportunity for cer∣tain Folks to make something, not as the Old Saying is, <HI>While the Sun shines,</HI> but rather <HI>While he is under a Cloud.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard, indeed, before I left <HI>London,</HI> That there was a Powerful Tribe of Land-Jobbers, who had erected them∣selves into a sort of a Company here, in order to Demolish <HI>Paper Money,</HI> which by the Prodigious Encouragement it gave to all manner of Trade and Commerce, did greatly Obstruct their Design of En∣grossing the Lands, and making them∣selves a kind of second hand Proprietors of the whole Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>We had a great deal of Talk, <HI>Master,</HI> of that same Company, at our Club t'other Night, where it was said, That Two of them had been in <HI>England</HI> this Ten Months purchasing all the Old Rights, Claims or Titles, of any sort, they could possibly meet with or trump up; for they value no Opposition what∣soever,
<PB N="44" REF="002794_0042_0FE63A4CCCFC3FD0"/>
being furnished with a Powerful Commissioner, an Obstinate Senator, a very Eloquent Lawyer, and the most finish'd Merchant, all exactly fitted for their Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but <HI>Roger,</HI> it is strange to conceive how these Men can Propose to carry on Projects and Monopolies over the Belly of Laws, Constitutions and just Rights, which they will most cer∣tainly find are very hard to be Overcome after that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, <HI>Master!</HI> is it a plain Case, if they can once get in to be Proprietors of the Lands, they will soon be the Law-Makers themselves; for you must know, that the Assembly or Legislature here, is chiefly composed of a Landed Interest, as indeed it is with Us in the House of Commons in <HI>England;</HI> but God be prais∣ed, our Rights are better secured There; and until something be done to render Property more certain Here, I cannot but pity the poor People whose Children, in all Probability must depend on this
<PB N="45" REF="002794_0043_0FE63A831A29FF80"/>
same Land-Jobbing Company for a Con∣firmation of Rights to their Possessions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Observ.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, honest <HI>Roger,</HI> I see thee art Piqu'd at the Case of thy Son <HI>Humphry;</HI> but I shall have frequent Opportunities to know more of this Matter, in a short time; and till then let Us Adjourn this Subject, and every other Thing that relates to Publick Business.</P>
