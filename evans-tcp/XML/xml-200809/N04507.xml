<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will not tax me with <HI>proclaiming my own Goodness,</HI> if I de∣clare to you that I think, in this Day of Controversy and Heat among us, I have both in my publick and private Conduct (for the general Tenor of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>study'd to do my own Business,</HI> and made it my Care to <HI>follow th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Things that make for Peace,</HI> with <HI>Edification.</HI> As saith the Scripture, <HI>Therefore the Prudent shall keep Silence in that Time; for it is an evil Time.</HI> Yet saith the true Proverb, <HI>To every Thing there is a Season, and a Time to every Purpose under the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>:</HI>—<HI>a Time to keep Silence, and a Time to speak.</HI> And in the latter Season, I think, none can justly be blamed for <HI>speaking,</HI> tho' with Openness and Freedom, provided they <HI>speak the Words of Truth and Soberness;</HI> neither <HI>turning aside to vain Jangling</HI> and <HI>perverse Disputing,</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>bringing a railing Accusation,</HI> as the manner of some is, when two warmly engag'd, and over-eagerly pursuing their Point.—I am deeply affected, to see the Spirit of <HI>Envying</HI> and <HI>Strife</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>which brings <HI>Confu∣sion and every evil Work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> risen to such a dreadful Height, as at this Junc∣ture: Nor would I willingly be the Instrument or Occasion of adding Fewel to this unhappy Fire of Contention, which has done us such unspeakable Mischief already, has so retarded the successful Progress of the <HI>glorious Gos∣pel of the blessed God,</HI> and given so much <HI>Occasion to the Adversary to speak reproachfully.</HI> Behold, <HI>The Tongue of Man is a Fire, a World of Iniquity: a little Member,</HI> yet <HI>an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Evil: The Tongue can no Man tame.</HI> But <HI>with GOD all Things are possible;</HI> yea, <HI>He is able to subdue all Things to</HI> HIMSELF. And 'tis my Heart's Desire and Prayer,—that the enthroned JESUS, the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> and the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> the <HI>only wise</HI> God <HI>our Saviour,</HI> will be pleased to interpose by his almighty Spirit and Providence, to <HI>command Peace,</HI> and to <HI>revive his Work</HI> in the midst of these declining Years!—O that the Children and Servants of God, who love <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and pray for her <HI>Peace,</HI> may at such a Time as this is more earnestly <HI>watch and pray that they enter not into Temptation;</HI> and <HI>if any Brother is over taken with a Fault,</HI> be disposed to <HI>restore such an one with the Spirit of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kness, considering Them∣selves,

How natural is the Reflection, "If Men suffer themselves to be carry'd away at this Rate <HI>by their Passions,</HI> then Farewel to all the <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> of <HI>Christians!</HI>"</P>
<P>I must freely acknowledge, <HI>Sir,</HI> they were such Considerations as these, which have restrain'd me from bearing any Part in the <HI>Paper-War</HI> among us, of so long Continuance. <HI>Nor am I for War,</HI> in my present Undertak∣ing; but acted (as I trust) by the Principles of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>brotherly Love,</HI> with a View in particular to the satisfying and settling your Mind in the <HI>Truth,</HI> as well as to the vindicating Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Name, in Relation to some Things suggested to his Prejudice, in the late <HI>anonymous</HI> LETTER to him; which, I perceiv'd by you, in our last Conversation, had made some Impressions on you to his Disadvantage, and I suspect, to your own Hurt.—You may remember, in what Manner you expressed your free Thoughts to me, concerning that Performance; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That the Author's <HI>Arguments</HI> are conclusive and unanswerable, if his <HI>Facts</HI> might be depended on, and the <HI>Grounds</HI> of his Reasoning have no Fallacy attending them.—This (<HI>Sir</HI>) has put me upon a fresh reading this <HI>Letter.</HI>—And I must confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, when I realise the <HI>high Nature</HI> of the Accusations here insinuated against Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d,</HI> and when I reflect on the <HI>popular</HI> Dress the Author appears in, together with the <HI>Effect</HI> his plausible Piece has already had on you, and the repeated <HI>Challenges</HI> I've heard made upon it, since I saw you, as if it were the most nervous Performance quite decisive, and not admitting of an Answer; I incline to think an Answer <HI>due</HI> to it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>more perhaps than to any other in the like Kind, that I have seen) especially to those <HI>Parts</HI> of it, that contain Matters not so commonly objected, and which seem to be the prin∣cipal Difficulties, that have given Rise to your present Uneasiness, with re∣gard to Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>For I observe, that all the more obvious Topicks of Objection and In∣vective against him, in former Use, being grown quite vulgar and trite, by such frequent Repetition, the <HI>Author</HI> of the LETTER has struck up cer∣tain New-Lights, and invented some singular Themes of Declamation, of a specious Appearance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dwelling chiefly and first upon these, but more cursorily touching on the others in the Close. For which Reason, and be∣cause they are the <HI>former,</HI> that appear of the greatest Weight to me, as well
<PB N="5" REF="005594_0004_1026A7DAEDD1F330"/>
as what <HI>you</HI> want an Answer to, I propose therefore at present to confine my Reflections to <HI>these;</HI> waving all Remarks on the concluding Pages, and passing over what may be exceptionable in the Author's Introduction.</P>
<P>The main Scope of his <HI>Letter</HI> is the Trial of Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Spirit, in Point of <HI>Christian Simplicity</HI> and <HI>moral Honesty;</HI> which our Author seems to think not discoverable in some Parts of his publick Conduct.—If I know myself, Sir, I would not be a blind Bigot to any Man, the wisest and best upon Earth; or <HI>have his Person in Admiration, because of Advantage,</HI> in any Respect: And as for Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d,</HI> I think I feel in me a proper Temper to see Mistakes and Failings in <HI>him</HI> as soon as in another.—Nor can I but highly approve every due Testimony against all <HI>Dissimulation,</HI> especially in sacred Affairs; and justify the contending for <HI>Simplicity and godly Sincerity,</HI> as an Essential in the Character of a <HI>Christian,</HI> and eminent∣ly of a <HI>Minister,</HI> who ought to be an <HI>Example to the Flock.</HI> And I must acknowledge, if our <HI>Author</HI> carries this Point against Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d,</HI> he will give the most thorow Stab to his Name; and must shake, if not demo∣lish, his Interest with the unbias'd Part of Mankind.—But then the Use we should make of this Reflection, is to treat a Point so delicate, and of such Importance, with the utmost Caution to avoid <HI>evil Surmisings,</HI> and to exemplify that <HI>Charity</HI> which <HI>thinketh no Evil,</HI> which <HI>believeth all Things, hopeth all Things,</HI> for the best.—The <HI>Consequence</HI> being so vast, we should well consider what <HI>Premisses</HI> we draw it from, that they be good and sound and clear, a sufficient Foundation to support the heavy Conclusion. And surely in a Case, of this critical Nature and of so much Moment, nothing short of undoubted <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Evidence,</HI> nothing short of incontestible <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Fact,</HI> view'd in the fairest comparative Light, <HI>without Partiality, and without Hypocrisy,</HI> can be valid and just Grounds to form our Judgment upon. How our <HI>Author</HI> has acquitted himself in his Trial of Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Case, you will know my Opinion by the Sequel of this Review.</P>
<P>The main Thing to be examin'd into, is the Business of the <HI>Clergy-Sub∣scriptions</HI> and <HI>Promises</HI> (made at entring into holy Orders) compar'd with some late Instances of Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Conduct; wherein our <HI>Author</HI> sus∣pects him guilty of the most culpable <HI>Inconsistence,</HI> such as bewrays <Q><HI>a wicked Insincerity,</HI> and <HI>aggravated Prevarication,</HI> to say no worse,</Q>—These were high Charges indeed, if brought in Form, and need very full and positive Evidence to gain them Credit with reasonable and impartial Judges. <HI>Against an Elder receive not an Accusation, but before two or three Witnesses.</HI>—Aware of this, our <HI>Author</HI> therefore deals little in formal and direct <HI>Accusations,</HI> but proceeds generally by Way of <HI>Inquiry</HI> and <HI>Insinua∣tion:</HI> exhibiting his Grounds of <HI>Jealousy,</HI> and calling upon Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> to <HI>clear up his Innocence,</HI> or else <HI>confess his Guilt;</HI> though, it appears plain up∣on the Face of his Performance, he thinks it's the <HI>latter</HI> only, that he has any Reason to expect. Whereas, I am perswaded, the Gentleman would
<PB N="6" REF="005594_0005_1026A7DEE84E1D80"/>
rather have seen Room for the <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmer,</HI> had he on this Occasion been suffi∣ciently dispos'd to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> which always studies a favourable Construction of Things, and had be with a little closer Attention look'd into the <HI>Consti∣tution</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> the Nature of her Clerical <HI>Subscriptions</HI> and <HI>Declarations,</HI> and the true <HI>Extent</HI> of the Obligations, in Consequence hereof, to <HI>Ministerial Conformity.</HI> I have had some Occasions formerly, as well as at this Time, to examine into these Matters, and after the best Inqui∣ries I have been able to make, Things don't appear to <HI>me,</HI> in the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight as to our <HI>Author.</HI> It seems, either he or I must labour of some strange Confusion of Thought upon these Things; or we must have a different Idea of <HI>Contradiction</HI> and <HI>Inconsistency;</HI> or else we must, one or other, be under an unhappy Bias of Partiality▪—<HI>Judi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Lecter.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> first singles out the 26<HI>th</HI> of the 39 <HI>Articles</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shrewdly suspects Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> guilty of having <HI>contra∣dicted,</HI> by some Passages in one of his printed <HI>Journals,</HI> as recited in the <HI>Letter</HI> before us. And the Gentleman, "to give a <HI>clear View</HI> of the <HI>Difficulty</HI> which he wants to have solv'd," contrives two distinct <HI>Columns,</HI> for the <HI>Ar∣ticle</HI> and the <HI>Extract,</HI> setting the one over against the other. And fancying (I suppose) that he now had Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> fast, to be unavoidably ground as between <HI>two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> tho' without any Attempt to put them in <HI>Mot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI>) he leaves him in this critical Situation, presently passing over to a new Case. But indeed I much wonder how he should dream, that meerly these <HI>collate∣ral Transcripts</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nothing <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in themselves, and profoundly at <HI>rest</HI>) as he has left 'em, should do any great Execution; or that, even with the help of distinguish'd <HI>Types,</HI> they should so much as give a <HI>clear View of the Dif∣ficulty,</HI> without the further Assistance of some superadded <HI>Glosses,</HI> Comments, or proper Notes of Illustration.—I must own, I can't see at present any other than a mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Contradistinction</HI> between our Author's <HI>two Columns,</HI> without any <HI>inward</HI> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>trariety, or <HI>contradictory Opposition.</HI> For I imagine, I see a good intrinsick Harmony subsisting between the <HI>Article</HI> and the <HI>printed Words;</HI> and likely to subsist still, if no stronger Efforts be made, to give it an Interruption.</P>
<P>I truly wish, that our <HI>Author</HI> would revise his <HI>two Columns,</HI> compare and scan them with his best Powers of Criticism, and try if he can fairly make out the least real <HI>Contradiction</HI> between them, in any Part, Paragraph, Sen∣tence, Lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or Word. For my self, I have try'd all my Skill upon 'em, and am quite at a Loss where the <HI>Inconsistency</HI> lies.—Among which of the various <HI>Types</HI> in the <HI>Extract</HI> (or <HI>printed Words</HI> of Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI>) we must look to find a <HI>Contradiction</HI> to the <HI>Article,</HI> set in Opposition to it, the Author has not been so kind as particularly to direct us. And as for what is in the Ro∣man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tter, I am sensible of no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Discord there. We must look for it then in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> it must be here, or no where. But I believe, it will
<PB N="7" REF="005594_0006_1026A7E15CE15368"/>
puzzle a good Genius, to trace out any real <HI>Contradiction</HI> here. Our <HI>Author</HI> indeed seems to draw our Eyes to this Part of the <HI>Extract,</HI> and to indigitate a single Passage, as the <HI>Capital</HI> one, by putting it in great Letters. 'Tis that noted Interrogatory,—FOR HOW CAN DEAD MEN <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>EG<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>T LIVING CHILDREN?—But at present I think this capable of an innocent Meaning, and well consistent with Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Subscription to the <HI>Article.</HI></P>
<P>You are sensible, Sir, that <HI>Rhetorical</HI> Figures and Flourishes are allow'd a candid Construction in all Authors, sacred or prophane. And why should this be made an <HI>Exception,</HI> and meet with such hard Measures? Why should this be so amplify'd upon in a Variety of Censure and unfavourable De∣scant? Some objecting, that it carries an <HI>absurd</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Allusion,</HI> and im∣plies a <HI>false Hypothesis</HI> in Divinity, as if for (spiritually) <HI>dead Ministers</HI> to be instrumental of begetting Souls unto <HI>Newness of Life, through the Gos∣pel,</HI> were absolutely a moral Impossibility, equal to the natural Impossibili∣ty there is of a (naturally) <HI>dead Man's begetting living Children;</HI> so making all Success of the Gospel, in the Nature of Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, essentially dependant on some inherent <HI>Principle</HI> or <HI>Virtue</HI> in the <HI>Administrator,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the the Holy One of Israel,</HI> as if it were not in his Power and Prerogative to bless his own appointed Means by whomsoever dispensed.—But surely such a Construction of Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Word's must appear altogether <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>captions,</HI> if we consider how it directly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the whole Tenor of his Preaching and Praying, so full in the Acknowledgment of human Im∣potence, the Sovereignty of divine Grace, and irresistible Energy of the Spirit of Holiness. Nay, even in the very <HI>Extract</HI> it self that our <HI>Author</HI> presents us with, Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> to make the largest Concession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could, says, That <HI>GOD may convert People by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Devil, if He pleases, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> He may by unconverted Ministers. But</HI> then it follows, <HI>I believe He seldom makes Use of either of them for this Purpose.</HI>—And here indeed we have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the true Meaning of the figurative <HI>Query</HI> above; which, in a candid View o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, can only import, It's exceeding <HI>unlikely,</HI> that GOD should otherwise than <HI>seldom</HI> make <HI>unconverted</HI> Ministers the Instruments of <HI>converting</HI> Sinners. This, Sir, I do and must insist on as a natural and unforc'd Gloss upon the con∣troverted Passage, and conveys (I believe) the very Idea of the Writer. And why should his Words be put upon the Rack and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to make them confess a different Sense, inconsistent too with the Scope of the Con∣text, and with his avow'd Principles, only to fix an <HI>Odium</HI> upon him, as either erroneous, or absurd, or inconsistent!—I can't help observing here, it would be the most abusive wresting of his Words, to insinuate, that he asserts the total <HI>Uselesness</HI> of unconverted Ministers, and puts them on a <HI>Par</HI> with the <HI>Devil</HI> himself in Respect of <HI>Service</HI> to the Church of God. For his <HI>printed Words</HI> speak of the Success of such Ministers with Regard only to the <HI>converting</HI> People; and he may consistently enough with deny∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="005594_0007_1026A7E3B16C1980"/>
<HI>that,</HI> own their <HI>Usefulness</HI> in other Respects. Nevertheless, he has not deny'd even <HI>that</HI> universally and absolutely. And although he speaks of God's <HI>seldom</HI> making Use of <HI>unconverted</HI> Ministers to the End of <HI>convert∣ing</HI> People, and at the same Time speaks also of the <HI>Devil'</HI>s being seldom made Use o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to that End, yet he may be far from designing to set them on a <HI>Level,</HI> in Regard of Usefulness to that Purpose. The blessed God may overrule the <HI>Devil'</HI>s Temptations sometimes, tho' but seldom, to sub∣serve the Ends of <HI>Conviction</HI> and <HI>Conversion;</HI> and He may succeed the Mi∣nistrations of <HI>dead Preachers</HI> sometimes, tho' also but <HI>seldom,</HI> to promote the same Ends; there may be indeed no great <HI>Frequency,</HI> or <HI>Commonness,</HI> in one Case, or t'other: And yet there may be a vast <HI>Disproportion</HI> between them, as to the Degree of <HI>Rareness,</HI> in Favour of the latter. It must be acknowledg'd therefore a disingenuous Turn given Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Expressi∣ons, to represent them either as comparing unconverted Ministers to the <HI>Devil</HI> in Point of general Usefulness, or as equalling the <HI>Devil</HI> to them in Point of Successfulness to the great End of <HI>converting People,</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>Nor can I look on our <HI>Author</HI> as acting the generous Part in pretending a <HI>Contradiction</HI> between Mr▪ <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Words and an <HI>Article</HI> of the Church, with a View to fasten upon him the odious Imputation of <HI>falsifying</HI> his so∣lemn <HI>Subscription,</HI>—without so much as letting us know in <HI>what Light</HI> he took Things, and <HI>where</HI> he saw the <HI>Contradiction.</HI> For this, I confess, does not shew it self to <HI>me,</HI> after all my Searches and Researches, to find it. An <HI>Appearance</HI> indeed there may be, to an unwary and superficial, or prejudiced Reader, of an <HI>Inconsistence</HI> between the <HI>Article,</HI> and Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d's printed Words;</HI> but yet taking both in their real Scope, and allowing them a fair Comparison, I'm of Opinion, even this Appearance of a <HI>Contradiction</HI> must immediately vanish.</P>
<P>But not contenting my self to imitate our <HI>Author'</HI>s Example, I am will∣ing, in the most explicit Manner, to shew the Grounds of my Opinion, by descending to Particulars, and entring into the very Bowels of each <HI>Column</HI> with my Examination. For Instance, the <HI>Article</HI> speaking of <HI>evil Men,</HI> as∣serts, <HI>"We</HI> MAY <HI>use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word, and in receiv∣ing the Sacraments."</HI> Nor does the <HI>Extract</HI> from Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> contradict this.—Again, The <HI>Article</HI> says, <HI>"Neither is the</HI> EFFECT OF CHRIST's ORDINANCE TAKEN AWAY BY THEIR WICKEDNESS."—And, looking on the Words in their original View and genuine Intendment, neither does the <HI>Extract</HI> advance any Thing, either explicitly or implicitly, contrary to this. Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> indeed has said, he <HI>believes that</HI> GOD SELDOM <HI>makes Use of unconverted Ministers</HI> for the Purpose of <HI>converting People.</HI> However, this includes an implicit Concession, that <HI>that</HI> is <HI>sometimes</HI> the Case in Fact. But, supposing he had shewed his Opinion in the most universal Terms, say∣ing, that he believ'd GOD <HI>never</HI> makes Use of such for the mentioned Purpose; yet in what Shape will our <HI>Author</HI> make this to contradict the <HI>Article?</HI> For you

well know, Sir, that <HI>Contradictions</HI> are always <HI>ad idem,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> refer to <HI>one Thing,</HI> and this in the <HI>same Respect.</HI> Whereas, the <HI>Article</HI> and the <HI>printed Words</HI> are not speaking <HI>ad idem,</HI> but in their direct Reference are concerning different Matters: which if the Gentleman had observ'd, I think he cou'd not have suspected a <HI>Repugnancy</HI> in the Case. Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d,</HI> it's plain, has his Eye in the Words quoted from him, to Ministers only under the No∣tion of <HI>Preachers,</HI> and speaks of <HI>dead Men's Preaching</HI> being <HI>seldom</HI> (and exceeding unlikely to be commonly) made Use of to the End of <HI>convert∣ing People:</HI> nor is he in the Opinion of a Real <HI>baptismal Regeneration</HI> or <HI>sacramental Conversion.</HI> Whereas now the <HI>Article,</HI> tho' it occasionally mentions the <HI>Word,</HI> has in the whole of it its primary View to the <HI>Sacra∣ments:</HI> and in that Part of it where the Emphasis lies, and on which our <HI>Author</HI> seems to lay his chief Stress, by placing his <HI>Capitals</HI> here, does evidently point to the <HI>Sacraments</HI> only; which the Church of <HI>England</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'m persuaded) does not declare were instituted for <HI>converting</HI> Ordinances, but design'd for the <HI>perfecting of the Saints,</HI> the <HI>Heirs of Promise.</HI> To <HI>such</HI> (says the Article) the Unworthiness of the Administrator does not evacuate the <HI>Sacraments▪</HI> or hinder their profiting. The Words run thus, <HI>"Neither is the Effect of Christ's Ordinance taken away by their Wickedness, or the Grace of God's Gift diminished,</HI> FROM SUCH AS BY FAITH AND RIGHTLY DO RECEIVE THE <HI>SACRAMENTS ministred unto them,</HI> WHICH <HI>be effectual be∣cause of CHRIST's Institution and Promise, although they be ministred by evil Men."</HI>—You see, Sir, WHO they be, that the <HI>Article</HI> says, <HI>Christ's Or∣dinances</HI> do not become ineffectual to, <HI>thro' the Wickedness of evil Ministers,</HI> namely, <HI>Such as by Faith and rightly do receive</HI> the same: and to <HI>such</HI> they are <HI>effectual,</HI> not by any Virtue in him that doth administer, but only <HI>be∣cause of Christ's Institution and Promise.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ will own his <HI>Institutions,</HI> and fulfil his <HI>Promise</HI> to his faithful People. The Mini∣ster's Sins shall not hinder Christ's Graces, nor lessen them, to his People. "For (as Bp. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge</HI> says upon it, in his Exposition of this <HI>Article</HI>) be the Minister worthy or unworthy, if I come with <HI>Faith</HI> to an Ordinance, I am sure to go with Grace from it." Now if you extend this to the <HI>Word preached,</HI> the <HI>Article</HI> must suppose it preached orthodoxly; and Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> has ne∣ver deny'd, that the <HI>Word,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oundly and orthodoxly <HI>preached,</HI> will <HI>profit,</HI> where it is <HI>mixed with Faith in them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear it,</HI> tho' it be an <HI>evil Man</HI> that preaches it.—However, you can't but perceive, <HI>Sir,</HI> that it is only the <HI>Sacraments</HI> are respected in this Part of the <HI>Article,</HI> which our Author has di∣stinguish'd by Capitals, as what perhaps he lays the Weight of the Argument upon: And the true Scope of the <HI>Article</HI> here is plainly this, and nothing else, that <HI>the Sacraments</HI> are not invalidated to the worthy Partakers, by any personal Demerits or sinful Defects and Faults in the Administrator; that the spiritual Benefit and internal <HI>Effect of the Sacraments,</HI> as no de∣pending on the spiritual State, internal Disposition or moral Character of the Administrator, <HI>is not</HI> by Means of his personal Faultiness <HI>taken away,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="005594_0009_1026A7E851A72A40"/>
or at all <HI>diminished▪ from such as by Faith and Rightly do receive</HI> the same.</P>
<P>'Tis a known Maxim, <HI>Occasio Legis indicat</HI> &amp; <HI>mentem Legislatoris</HI> &amp; <HI>sensum Legis.</HI> The <HI>Occasion</HI> interpre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Article, which (as Bp. <HI>Burnet</HI> observes) was the Heat of some in the Beginning of the Reformation; that being offended at the Vices of the <HI>Roman</HI> Clergy, revived the Conceit of the <HI>Donatists;</HI> who considered the <HI>Sacraments</HI> as the Answer of Prayers, and so since the Prayers of a wicked Man are an Abomination to God, they tho't the Virtue of these Actions depended wholly on him that officiated.</P>
<P>Further more, This is confirmed by the TITLE of this <HI>Article;</HI> which stands thus, <HI>Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinder not the Effects of the SACRAMENTS.</HI> The Title is wont to be appeal'd to in such Cases, for the true Purport and Design of what follows in the Body of any Law, Canon, Chapter, or Article. And I must observe, had our Author not left out the <HI>Title</HI> of this 26th <HI>Article,</HI> I'm prone to think, every common Reader must have been aware of the Fallacy of the <HI>two Columns,</HI> and would easily have seen thro' the thin Appearance.—I must add, Nor can I look upon our <HI>Author</HI> as acting so fair a Part, in secreting from our People (little acquainted with the Book of <HI>Articles</HI>) one whole Para∣graph, when he speaks of "setting down <HI>the Article,</HI>" by which one would suppose he had done it at full Length. For by thus mutilating it, he has left out what is added in the last Paragraph very fitly and seasonably, to pre∣ventany Abuse of the former; and what, I must acknowledge, seems to countenance Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Zeal against evil and unworthy Ministers. The Words therefore I think proper to have restored, and will insert here. The <HI>Article</HI> concludes thus; <HI>"Nevertheless it appertaineth to the Discipline of the Church, that Enquiry be made of Evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that have Knowledge of their Offences, and finally being found guilty by Judg∣ment, be deposed."</HI>—Upon which Bishop <HI>Beveridge</HI> has the following Remark. <Q>It being determined in the former Part of the <HI>Article,</HI> that the Unwor∣thiness of the Minister doth not hinder the Effect of the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> it is very opportunely added in this, that such unworthy Ministers ought to be enquired out, yea, and proceeded against according to the Discipline of the Church.</Q>—And Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> (in his Exposition of the 39 Arti∣cles, remarks upon it) that <Q><HI>Timothy</HI> was required to receive <HI>an Accusation of an Elder,</HI> when regularly tender'd to him, and to <HI>rebuke before all, those that sinned;</HI> and he was charged to withdraw himself from those <HI>Teach∣ers who consented not to wholesome Words,</HI> and that made <HI>a Gain of Godliness.</HI>—Certainly (he adds) there is nothing more incumbent on the whole Body of the Church, than that all possible Care be taken to discover the bad Practices that may be among the Clergy.—But after all, our Zeal must go along with Justice and Discretion: Fame may be a just Ground to enquire upon, but a Sentence cannot be founded on it.</Q>—According∣ly Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> is for having all prudent Steps taken in Pursuance of this last Paragraph of the <HI>Article,</HI> that <HI>evil Ministers</HI> may be <HI>inquired out,</HI> detected
<PB N="11" REF="005594_0010_1026A7EB618CF958"/>
and convicted, if possible, and then silenc'd.—I hope, our Author won't object, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s <HI>unconverted Ministers</HI> and the <HI>Article'</HI>s <HI>Evil Mi∣nisters</HI> are not the same, and that there may be a <HI>Clash</HI> here. No▪ for as to the <HI>Article,</HI> this must be interpreted in a Consistence with the Rest, which every where use, as equivalent, these Terms in Description of <HI>evil Men,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "<HI>Carnal Persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ,</HI>—<HI>"The Wicked and such as be void of a lively Faith,</HI> and the like. Now these Characters apply'd to <HI>Ministers,</HI> do constitute Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s <HI>dead Men,</HI> do describe his <HI>unconverted Ministers.</HI> I suppose, none will think him so void of Reason, as not to allow that some <HI>unconverted Ministers</HI> may be such very refin'd, consummate Hypocrites, and make such a <HI>fair Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w</HI> in the Flesh, by Means of an ortho∣dox Head and regular Practice, as to render a judicial Conviction of them impracticable; and where this is in Reality the Case with any, that such must be resign'd to the Judgment of God, who only trieth the Heart, and know∣eth the Secrets of Men. However, whereas he declares himself <HI>verily per∣swaded, that the Generality of Preachers talk of an unknown unfelt Christ,</HI> he has therefore on some Occasions <HI>opened his Mouth boldly against unconverted Ministers:</HI> giving it as his Opinion, that <HI>the Reason why Congregations have been so dead, is because they have had dead Men preaching to them.</HI>—Now, As to the Grounds of his <HI>Conduct,</HI> or how far his <HI>Sentiment</HI> may be just and well-founded, I am not oblig'd in this Place to inquire: for the Argument we are upon, calls me only to consider, whether the <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other</HI> be <HI>incon∣sistent</HI> with his <HI>Subscription,</HI> and contrary to the <HI>Article,</HI> which our Author has confronted him with. And for my Part, on a sedate View of the Mat∣ter, according to all the Lights I have been capable of placing it in, I can't discern the pretended <HI>Inconsistence,</HI> nor believe Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and his <HI>Sub∣scription</HI> to be at opposite Angles. For, as to his <HI>Conduct,</HI> in <HI>preaching</HI> after a general Manner <HI>against unconverted Ministers,</HI> this surely is rather a Proof of his <HI>Adherence</HI> to his Subscription, as it manifests his being in Earnest to have the genuine Drift of the <HI>Article,</HI> in its last Paragraph, faithfully pro∣secuted, by all due <HI>Inquiry,</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> in Relation to <HI>evil Ministers.</HI></P>
<P>And as for his <HI>Sentiment</HI> touching the immediate natural or moral <HI>Reason</HI> of <HI>Congregations having been so dead</HI> in Times past, <HI>namely, their having had dead Men to preach to them,</HI> neither do I at present see any Variance between this and the <HI>Article.</HI> If Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Opinion in the Case implies any Contra∣diction to the <HI>Article,</HI> I think it must be to one or other of the following <HI>Clauses</HI> in it: where yet, for my own Part, I must confess, I am sensible of <HI>no Clash.</HI> For Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s assigning such a <HI>Reason,</HI> as above said, does by no Means imply but that in some Cases, agreeable to the <HI>Article, "We</HI> MAY <HI>use the Ministry of evil Men:"</HI> And indeed consonant to this is his own Practice, as well as avow'd Principle.—Nor yet do's his said <HI>Reason</HI> imply, in Opposition to the <HI>Article,</HI> that "<HI>the Effect of Christ's Ordinances is taken away by their Wickedness, or the Grace of God's Gifts diminished,</HI> FROM SUCH <HI>as by</HI> FAITH <HI>and</HI> RIGHTLY <HI>do receive the</HI> SACRAMENTS." So stands the <HI>Arti∣cle:</HI>

But yet, Sir, if you please, you have my Leave to subjoin also <HI>the Word preached;</HI> and Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Consent too, I doubt not,—with this <HI>Provis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (which you must necessarily suppose imply'd in the <HI>Article</HI>) that the <HI>Preach∣ing</HI> be adjusted to the Standard of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and conformable to the Doc∣trine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> particularly in her <HI>Articles.</HI> For as the Case of <HI>heterodox</HI> or <HI>false Teachers</HI> is justly to be supposed an <HI>Exception,</HI> under that general Clause in the Article, <HI>We may use the Ministry of evil Men:</HI> So when the Preachers <HI>Wickedness</HI> lies in their <HI>bringing in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heresies,</HI> be sure it can't rationally be suppos'd but this must stand an <HI>excepted Case,</HI> when the <HI>Article</HI> says of <HI>evil Men,—Neither is the Effect of Christ's Ordinance ta∣ken away by their Wickedness.</HI>—Nevertheless, where the Word is <HI>rightly</HI> preached, tho' by <HI>evil Men.</HI> Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> has never, that I can find, asserted <HI>the Effect of Christ's Ordinance</HI> to be <HI>taken away by their Wickedness,</HI> totally and absolutely, with Reference even to the <HI>Conversion of Sinners.</HI> His <HI>prin∣ted Words</HI> evidently point to a <HI>partial Success</HI> of the Word, and suppose it actually existent in the present Case. <HI>The Reason why Congregations have been</HI> SO <HI>dead,</HI> says he, <HI>is because they have had dead Men preaching to them.</HI> You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he speaks but of a <HI>partial Deadness</HI> in Congregations, which implies a Concession of some Instances of <HI>Life</HI> among them, and consequently bespeaks some Degree of <HI>Success</HI> attending even <HI>dead Men's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> them.</HI>—But still, supposing he had asserted the <HI>universal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of such Men's Preaching, in Regard of the Conversion of <HI>Sinners,</HI> what is that to the <HI>Ar∣ticle,</HI> which (as I observ'd before) refers only to the Edification of <HI>Saints?</HI>—Does Mr.<HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> any where say, that <HI>the Effect of Christ's Ordinances is ta∣ken away by their Wickedness, or the Grace of God's Gifts diminished,</HI> FROM SUCH <HI>as by</HI> FAITH <HI>and</HI> RIGHTLY <HI>do receive them!</HI> No; I believe, I may assert it in the strongest Manner, that where the God of all Grace gives to any <HI>the hear∣ing Ear</HI> and <HI>understanding Heart,</HI> working in them sincere <HI>Faith,</HI> RIGHTLY TO RECEIVE the Word (rightly dispensed) Mr.<HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> never has deny'd the Possibility of <HI>such</HI> People's getting the full Effect of <HI>Christ's Ordinance,</HI> even under the <HI>deadest Preacher</HI> in the World</P>
<P>Upon the whole, <HI>Sir,</HI> it appears to me, and I hope does by this Time to you, in a very convincing Light, that our <HI>Author'</HI>s two <HI>Columns</HI> don't in the least <HI>contravene</HI> one another, but rest together at full Agreement, in a State of intire Inaction, though put by him in a militant Posture.—You must al∣low me to observe to you, It is therefore a va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Imagination in our <HI>Author,</HI> to suppose that Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d,</HI> while bearing a faithful Testimony against some of the <HI>Church-Clergy</HI> for contradicting the <HI>Articles</HI> they have subscrib'd to, is at the same Time but lashing <HI>himself</HI> for violating his own Subscription.—And I may now seasonably express my Resentmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it as a gross <HI>Incon∣sistence</HI> in our <HI>Author,</HI> that when he had open'd his <HI>Letter</HI> with the Profession only to "propose a few Things in the <HI>Spirit of</HI> LOVE <HI>and</HI> MEEKNESS," he should presently in the same Page breathe a <HI>different Spirit,</HI> and fall upon Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> with hasty and harsh Censures, applying to him with that View

Texts of holy <HI>Scripture;</HI> and this too before he would "at the Trouble" to point out the <HI>Facts,</HI> and lay Matter of <HI>Conviction</HI> before him. Nay, in this Instance which we have been considering, he has not (tho' he had pro∣fessed to do it) so much as "taken the Trouble to shew him wherein" par∣ticularly he suspects him not "clear of Blame," that he "might have a fair Occasion to justify himself, and remove all Ground of Clamour against him upon this Head." You must acknowledge it, Sir, not so fair Manage∣ment in our Author to insinuate a <HI>Contradiction</HI> between the <HI>Article</HI> and the <HI>Extract</HI> he has made from Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d,</HI> and yet at the same Time to neglect doing his proper Office as an <HI>Opponent,</HI> i. e. first a <HI>Specification</HI> of the parti∣cular Expressions, in which he thinks the <HI>Contradiction</HI> lies, and then <HI>arguing</HI> it out in the best Manner he could. This would have been <HI>Scholar-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike.</HI> But whether from an Affection not to verbalise, or whether from a Pre∣sumption that the Case was too plain to make many Words about, or whatever was the Cause, so it has happen'd, there's a profound <HI>Silence</HI> here; the Gentleman having totally omitted both the proper <HI>stating</HI> of "the <HI>Difficulty</HI> he wanted to have solv'd," and of Consequence all <HI>debating</HI> or <HI>descanting</HI> upon it. By which unaccountable Management he has im∣pos'd an unreasonable Task upon his <HI>Respondent:</HI> putting him to this com∣plicated Labour; first to <HI>search</HI> critically thro' the whole for the <HI>Place</HI> where it was possible any fanciful Brain might imagine something <HI>adversa∣tive</HI> between the <HI>two columns;</HI> then accurately to <HI>examine</HI> and <HI>compare</HI> every <HI>suspectable</HI> Passage, Line, or Word; and finally to <HI>reason</HI> distinctly on the whole.—It's not unlikely, <HI>Sir,</HI> this has given Occasion for the draw∣ing out the present Vindication of Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> to a Length exceeding what might have been needful, had our <HI>Author</HI> (if I may be allow'd to bor∣row some of his own Words here) "dealt fairly and openly, letting the World know his real Sentiments upon this Matter," with the particular Grounds of them; which "I can't but think became him as and honest Man," in an Affair of so great Nicety, and equal Importance, whereon his <HI>Brother's Reputation,</HI> as a Minister and a Christian, has even by his own Acknowledgement such a Dependance.</P>
<P>You'l therefore excuse me, Sir, that I have detained you thus long on our <HI>Author'</HI>s first Head of Accusation, or Suspicion: and allow me to say, I think I have given all reasonable Satisfaction to every Doubt on that Head.—After the <HI>two Columns</HI> have been thus scrutinis'd in their various Parts, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consider'd in a comparative View, it seems to me impossible but that you should see, all Pretences of Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s having <HI>violated his Subscriptions,</HI> in our <HI>Author'</HI>s first Instance, are utterly superseded.—Nay, I hope, this Gentleman himself is ready now, upon cool Reflec∣tion, to confess Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d</HI> "clear of Blame," and to acknowledge his own Mistake, in suggesting that there was any just "Ground of Cla∣mour against him on this Head."—But I am more confident, that eve∣ry indifferent Judge, free from Pre-engagements, will be ready to ac∣quit

Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d,</HI> as "<HI>an honest Man,</HI> and <HI>acting a consistent Part,</HI>" thus far.—May he never be found acting a less consistent Part!—And may it be the common Care of us all, whether Ministers or People, to approve our selves equally <HI>"consistent upright Christians"!

<HEAD>The Second LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 8. 1744, 5.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS waits on you with some further Observations, on the late printed LETTER to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> objecting to some of his Measures, and calling upon him to <HI>vindicate his Conduct, or confess his Faults.</HI> I have spoken sufficiently to the first Fact there alledged against him: And as there is nothing of Connection between that and the others, I have no Need of repeating any Thing already said, to introduce my Remarks on our <HI>Author'</HI>s second Objection.</P>
<P>In the next Place then, you observe, Sir, he excepts against Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Conduct in <HI>publickly praying, and administring the Sacrament, without any Re∣gard to the Form prescribed in the Book of Common-Prayer.</HI> Our Author sus∣pects him to be <HI>herein acting, not a consistent,</HI> but <HI>a wicked insincere Part;</HI> and fears, this <HI>his Practice</HI> is <HI>an open Violation of what he subscrib'd and promis'd at his Ordination,</HI> and afterwards <HI>solemnly, and repeatedly sealed his Approbation of at the blessed Sacrament.</HI></P>
<P>But, my Friend, as you are not wont to be easily impos'd upon with po∣pular Insinuations, with meer Sophisms, or with Arguments more <HI>ad Pom∣pam,</HI> than <HI>ad Pugnam:</HI> so I shall much wonder, if the Declamation upon this Head appears to you to have any real Weight in it, after it has pass'd a pro∣per Examination. For as pathetick and peremptory as our Author is here, I very much doubt whether he has not miss'd the true Meaning of the <HI>Church-Clergy's Subscription</HI> and <HI>Declaration</HI> he talks so much of,—as expounded e∣ven by Themselves; and whether he has sufficiently consider'd the true Force and Extent of the <HI>Obligation</HI> resulting therefrom, in Relation to their <HI>approving the Common-Prayer-Book,</HI> and <HI>using the Form in the said Book
<PB N="15" REF="005594_0014_1026A7F5B38D6EF8"/>
prescribed, in publick Prayer and Administration of Sacraments,</HI> AND NONE OTHER.</P>
<P>The first Step necessary to deciding any <HI>Question,</HI> is to adjust and settle the Meaning of the <HI>Terms.</HI> And possibly, in the <HI>Subscription</HI> or <HI>Declaration</HI> abovesaid, it may admit of some Debate, what is the genuine Import and In∣tent of the concluding Words, NONE OTHER. I am confident, upon the surest Grounds, this limiting Clause is not to be taken literally, in the Strictness of the Expression, as if the Clergy meant to oblige themselves to the <HI>sole</HI> Use of that <HI>individual</HI> Form in the Prayer-Book, <HI>exclusive</HI> of all other Forms in every Case. For this Construction is utterly forbidden by these two Con∣siderations. (1.) It is contrary to the common Practice of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who in their <HI>Prayer before Sermon</HI> pay no Regard to the <HI>Form</HI> in that Case pre∣scribed in the <HI>Canon;</HI> as I shall have Occasion more particularly to remark hereafter.—And then (2.) It is contrary to the known Custom of the <HI>Bi∣shops,</HI> in composing <HI>new</HI> Offices and Forms of Devotion, on some special Occasions. It has been a Thing frequent, on Occasion of a special <HI>Thanks∣giving</HI> or <HI>Fast,</HI> to have special <HI>Forms</HI> or <HI>Offices</HI> printed before-hand and dis∣tributed to every Parish, for publick Use in the Church on such Days. I well remember, particularly in the late Queen <HI>ANNE'</HI>s Reign, as by Means of the <HI>then-War</HI> there were frequent Occasions of this Nature, I had the Sight of some of the <HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> specially provided in that Case. And in them, I must observe by the Way, there were usually one or two Collects for <HI>the Reformed Churches abroad:</HI>—which you'll please to bear in Mind for a future Occasion, in the Sequel of this Dispute.—Now these Reflections make it evident, to a Demonstration, that when the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the Church subscribe to use the <HI>Common-Prayer-Form,</HI> AND NONE OTHER, this is not to be taken in the <HI>rigid</HI> Sense, as our Author understands it, absolutely ex∣cluding all other Forms on every Occasion whatsoever. No, but the Sense must be <HI>temper'd</HI> some how, to reconcile it to the <HI>Customs</HI> in the Church, as abovemention'd. I can readily think of but two Con∣structions, to put upon the Words, that are <HI>consistent. Ex. gr.</HI> Must the Words, NONE OTHER, intend—none other <HI>statedly?</HI> This Con∣struction reconciles the Sense to the Use of other <HI>occasional</HI> Forms, enjoin'd by lawful Authority, such as the <HI>new</HI> Composures made by the Bishops, as above. But then I must observe, this Construction does not so well suit with the Practice of the Clergy in <HI>statedly</HI> praying <HI>before Sermon</HI> without <HI>using the Form prescribed</HI> for the Pulpit-Prayer.—Shall we then say, the Words, NONE OTHER, must intend NONE DIVERS <HI>in kind, None else essentially varying from it.</HI> The Word, <HI>Other,</HI> is used either to denote a <HI>numerical</HI> Difference, or a <HI>specifical</HI> Difference. But if we construe it here in the former Sense (i. e.

Chuse but a <HI>consistent Sens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and I doubt not you will justify Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s occasionally using <HI>other</HI> Prayers than those in the <HI>Book.</HI></P>
<P>But further, let me observe to you, <HI>Sir,</HI> if we should go into a critical Consideration of what must be understood, by fair Construction, as inclu∣ded in the Idea of PUBLICK PRAYER, according to the Idiom of <HI>Episcopal</HI> Lan∣guage, it would perhaps be no impossible Attempt, to reconcile Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s <HI>Conduct</HI> abroad with his <HI>subscription</HI> and <HI>Declaration</HI> at home. Its well known, the PUBLICK MINISTERS (so; called) in <HI>England</HI> are Ministers Epis∣copally ordered, in Conformity to the Book of Ordination: Such only are held <HI>Ministers in the Church of England.</HI>—So, the PUBLICK CHURCHES there, are the Cathedral and other Collegiate Churches, the Parish-Churches, and Chappels, consecrated to perform Divine Service in according to the Or∣ders of the Church establish'd by Law.—And thus, in the Sense of the Sub∣scription before us, PUBLICK PRAYER is "common and open Prayer" in the <HI>publick Churches,</HI> the Houses dedicated to the <HI>Use</HI> of "ministring in the Congregation, by the prescript Form of Divine Service in the Church of <HI>England.</HI>" At least this is the <HI>Canonical</HI> Sense of the Expression. For the <HI>Constitutions</HI> and <HI>Canons</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> know no such Think as PUBLICK Prayer done in <HI>"private Conventicles";</HI> or in "PRETENDED CHURCHES, which is the <HI>Canonical</HI> Denomination for all "<HI>Meetings Assemblies, or Con∣gregations (of the king's born Subjects) within this Realm,</HI>" OTHER than the Epis∣copal Congregations or Assemblies, By <HI>Law</HI> established.—Nor in Truth are any deem'd PUBLICK OFFICES in Religion, <HI>other</HI> than those performed in these <HI>true</HI> and <HI>lawful</HI> Assemblies, the only PUBLICK ASSEMBLIES in the Sense of the <HI>Canons.</HI>—Now, according to this View of the Case, tho' some (ob∣solete) <HI>Canons</HI> of the Church may possibly be alledg'd against Mr. <HI>W</HI>—<HI>d'</HI>s Conduct, in Point of frequenting <HI>Conventicles,</HI> or <HI>pretended Churches,</HI> and ad∣ministring in <HI>private Meetings,</HI> as if the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were <HI>true</HI> and <HI>lawful Churches;</HI> yet with Regard to not <HI>using the Church-Liturgy in</HI> PUBLICK <HI>Prayer,</HI> I don't see he was either broken any Canon, or infring'd upon his Subscription. I question indeed whether the Clergy of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> hold them∣selves
<PB N="17" REF="005594_0016_1026A7FCC9F02C98"/>
obliged by their <HI>Subscription</HI> to the like invariable Use of the Com∣mon-Prayer-Book in the <HI>private Offices</HI> of Devotion, as in <HI>Publick Prayer.</HI> And if the <HI>Nonconformable</HI> Assemblies are reputed but <HI>private</HI> Meetings, a Church-Clergyman occasionally officiating in <HI>such</HI> Meetings may esteem himself at Liberty to suspend the Use of the Forms prescribed for <HI>Publick Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Sir,</HI> if you judge this Argument turns upon too critical Distinctions, and are dispos'd to allow, that the religious Assemblies in <HI>New-England</HI> are properly, what our <HI>Author</HI> calls'em, <HI>Publick Assemblies,</HI> not what the <HI>Church-Canons</HI> censure by the Name of <HI>pretended Churches,</HI> or private Conventicles, and that therefore <HI>Prayer</HI> performed in such Assemblies is in just Construc∣tion <HI>Publick Prayer,</HI>—I need not stand to debate this Point with you at present.</P>
<P>Other Reasons I have still, <HI>Sir,</HI> why I can by no Means concur with our <HI>Author,</HI> in thinking that Mr. W—d'<HI>s Subscription</HI> to the special <HI>Article,</HI> re∣fer'd to, obliges him so indispensably to use the <HI>Common-Prayer-Forms,</HI> but that he may <HI>occasionally</HI> omit using them, where he judges <HI>Free-praying</HI> most expedient and eligible (all Circumstances consider'd) as here in the <HI>New-England</HI> Congregations. For undoubtedly this particular <HI>Subscription</HI> to that special <HI>Article</HI> about the Use of the <HI>Common-Prayer,</HI> is not justly to be suppos'd of more <HI>extensive</HI> Obligation in Point of <HI>Place,</HI> than his general <HI>Subscription</HI> to the 39 <HI>Articles of Religion.</HI> And if we consult the <HI>Ratification</HI> at the End of the Book of <HI>Articles,</HI> this expresly tells us <HI>how f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> they extend by Force of the <HI>Subscription,</HI> being only "<HI>approved and allowed to be holden and executed</HI> WITHIN THE REALM" of <HI>England;</HI> and here it stops, with∣out the Addition of <HI>"other Dominions,"</HI> as elsewhere sometimes. Now this <HI>Ratification</HI> is one Thing expresly included within the <HI>three parti∣cular Articles,</HI> our Author refers to, as what the Church esteems of great Importance; and I think, Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> has subscrib'd to the <HI>Ratification</HI> in the 3d <HI>Article,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Use of the common Prayer</HI> in the <HI>second.</HI> By a fair Consequence then, laying these Things together, and interpreting the 2d <HI>Article</HI> by the 3d, his <HI>Subscription</HI> to the <HI>Use of the Form</HI> in <HI>the Common-Prayer-Book prescribed,</HI> AND NONE OTHER, must in Reason be construed, at the most; but only an Engagement to <HI>use</HI> that WITHIN THE REALM, where it is by publick Authority establish'd; and not be suppos'd to extend its Obligation indifferently <HI>all over the World,</HI> or even so far as <HI>New England,</HI> which tho' belonging to the <HI>King's Dominions,</HI> yet is not WITHIN HIS REALM, but is included under the Name of FOREIGN PARTS, constantly so apply'd even by the incorporated <HI>Society</HI> at home for <HI>propagating the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>And that the above Remark is not without very just Foundation, it may further help to convince you, if you'll inspect the <HI>Canon</HI> next to that our <HI>Author</HI> has alledg'd on this Occasion. The 37th <HI>Canon</HI> requir∣ing the very same <HI>Subscription,</HI> in Case of a <HI>licensed Minister's coming to</HI> RESIDE IN ANY DIOCESS, says, <HI>He shall not be permitted,</HI> THERE <HI>to preach,—
<PB N="18" REF="005594_0017_1026A7FF80ADFB10"/>
unless he first consent and subscribe to the</HI> three Articles <HI>before mentioned, in the Presence of the</HI> BISHOP <HI>of the</HI> DIOCESS <HI>wherein he is to preach</HI>—Now from the Tenor of this <HI>Canon</HI> it's evident, that the <HI>Article</HI> engaging a Clergyman to <HI>use</HI> in publick Worship the <HI>Church of England Form, and none other</HI> (whatever Sense you put upon the Words) is only <HI>then</HI> obliga∣tory to him, by Virtue of his <HI>Subscription,</HI> while he is RESIDING <HI>in</HI> some DIOCESS, and offering himself THERE <HI>to preach.</HI>—Consequently the <HI>Sub∣scriber,</HI> tho' here in <HI>New-England</HI> (or other <HI>foreign</HI> Parts) he intermits the Use of the <HI>Forms of Prayer, and Orders and Ceremonies prescribed in the Communion Book, or the Book of Common-Prayer,</HI> yet he is not liable for this to the Penalties of the following (38th) <HI>Canon,</HI> under this Title,—<HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olters after Subscription, censured.</HI> Nor yet of the 54th <HI>Canon,</HI> doom in such as <HI>refuse Conformity,</HI> to have their <HI>Licence</HI> taken from them.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> These are the <HI>Canons,</HI> which in a <HI>second</HI> Letter to Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> by <HI>Ca∣nonicus,</HI> are trump'd up and improved against him: And what I am saying in these Pages is applicable in Confutation of that trifling Piece, nor needs a∣ny further Notice to be taken of it.</NOTE>—For if <HI>New-England</HI> be no DIOCESS, nor Part of a DIOCESS; if <HI>New-England</HI> have no <HI>Prelate</HI> appointed over it by publick Authority, and residing in it, nor belongs to any <HI>Prelate'</HI>s Jurisdiction, to whom it is by Law sub∣ject and accountable; I pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> who is there in this Case to call Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> to a Reckoning, and execute the <HI>Censure</HI> upon him as a <HI>Revolter after Subscription,</HI> or a <HI>Refuser of Conformity,</HI> because of his omitting here in <HI>foreign Parts</HI> to use the <HI>Church of England</HI> Forms and Orders! If he is obnoxious to <HI>Censure,</HI> he is according to the Run of the <HI>Canons</HI> only <HI>pun∣ishable by the Bishop of the Diocess, or Ordinary of the Place having Episcopal Jurisdiction.</HI> But if here be no <HI>Diocess,</HI> if here be no <HI>Bishop.</HI> or <HI>Ordinary of the Place having Episcopal Jurisdiction,</HI> if here be no <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> Ecclesias∣tical under any <HI>Bishop</HI> or <HI>Arch-bishop,</HI> to which Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> is by Law sub∣jected; the Consequence is clear to me, that in vain do any pretend his <HI>omitting the Church-Forms,</HI> in his Ministrations here in our publick Assem∣blies, to be a punishable Breach of the <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>Constitutions</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> or an Infringement upon his own <HI>Subscription.</HI></P>
<P>You are sensible, Sir, it's of the very Nature of <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> that they refer to <HI>Place,</HI> and be circumscrib'd within <HI>Boundaries</HI> fix'd and cer∣tain.—The <HI>Orders</HI> of the <HI>Church of England</HI> being limited to be <HI>held and executed</HI> WITHIN THE REALM, the Clergy's <HI>Subscription</HI> to them must of Consequence have but a <HI>local</HI> and <HI>limited</HI> Obligation upon them to Con∣formity; reaching at furthest only to an equal Extent with the Autho∣rity and binding Force of the said <HI>Orders</HI> themselves.—Our <HI>Author</HI> then can never expect to carry his Argument against Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> unless he is able to prove, That no possible Change of <HI>Situation,</HI> no possible Altera∣tion of <HI>Place</HI> in point of Residence, will infer any the least <HI>Variation</HI> as to the <HI>obliging</HI> Nature and Force of his <HI>Subscription;</HI> but that the <HI>Case</HI> is
<PB N="19" REF="005594_0018_1026A801EB5EE7C0"/>
the same, wherever he is, and the <HI>Reason</HI> of the Thing the same, under all possible Variety of Circumstances. Let him prove this, and he shall be <HI>mihi magnus Apollo.</HI></P>
<P>But our <HI>Author</HI> might be ask'd if he thinks Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> is justly charge∣able with <HI>violating his Subscription,</HI> by ministring in SCOTLAND in <HI>like Man∣ner</HI> as he has done in these Parts, without using the <HI>Episcopal Form</HI> of Religion?—For if Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> as thus managing <HI>there,</HI> is tho't justly to be <HI>acquitted,</HI> I should think by Parity of Reason, his Conduct <HI>here</HI> ought not to be <HI>condemned</HI> in this Point; Because the two Cases, as they appear in my View of Things, are at least very nigh <HI>parallel:</HI> and if here (Sir) <HI>you</HI> differ from me in Opinion, I pray the Grounds or your Judgment.—But if our <HI>Author,</HI> to be consistent with himself, should accuse and censure his Conduct in SCOTLAND, as well as here, I think it's worthy of Consideration, how egregiously he will thereby redect upon the <HI>Church of England</HI> as de∣fective in her <HI>Charity,</HI> and violating the <HI>Communion of Saints.</HI> For Mr. <HI>W—d's</HI>s Conduct <HI>there</HI> can't be condemn'd on the Foot of his <HI>Subscription,</HI> without supposing that the <HI>Church of England</HI> intended, by imposing upon her Clergy the <HI>Subscription</HI> aforesaid, to tie them up from occasional Acts of <HI>Ministerial Communion</HI> with all other <HI>National Churches;</HI> not excepting even her Sister-Church of SCOTLAND, bordering so near upon her, and whose Prosperity stands so closely connected with her own. It must cer∣tainly be a scandalous Imputation on the <HI>Church of England,</HI> to suppose her so unconscionably <HI>bigotted</HI> to her own establish'd Form of Religion as to <HI>forbid</HI> her <HI>Clergy</HI> all <HI>occasional Conformity</HI> to the different Mode of Worship in a <HI>Sister-Church,</HI> when Providence gives them an Opportunity, and their own Conscience puts no Bar in the Way. That were in Effect to renounce the <HI>Communion of Churches;</HI> this being very much supported and carry'd on by <HI>Clerical</HI> Communion, or the Interchange of mutual Offices of Love and Assistance between their respective <HI>Ministers.</HI></P>
<P>If you'll be pleas'd, <HI>Sir,</HI> to consult the <HI>Articles, Canons,</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Writings of her ancient Divines, you will see no Colour of Reason, for so dishonourable a Thought of the <HI>English Refor∣mers,</HI> as if they were for laying an absolute <HI>Prohibition</HI> upon the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in Regard of <HI>Occasional Communion</HI> with foreign Churches, in the Administration of any Branch of their ministerial Office. I am perswaded, those pious <HI>Reformers</HI> never meant to exclude the <HI>Protes∣tant Churches</HI> abroad from their Charity, tho' differently constituted in Point of Ecclesiastical Government and external Modalities in Religion. They never meant to set up the <HI>Church of England</HI> for the <HI>Head &amp; Centre</HI> of <HI>Christian Unity,</HI> expecting all other Churches to reduce themselves to her Standard, upon Pain of being shut out from her Charity and Fellowship in the Gospel.—No; so far from this, that whoever converses with their Re∣mains in Print, or with the Histories of those Times, will see abundant E∣vidence, that the <HI>Church of England,</HI> in that Day professed a <HI>Catholick Com∣munion</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="005594_0019_1026A80601AF6968"/>
with the <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> and were firmly <HI>united</HI> with them all in Charity and Affection, as <HI>Members</HI> of <HI>one Body</HI> with herself. Nor can it reasonably be suppos'd, they condemn'd the <HI>Ministry</HI> of all other Protestant Churches, while they did not renounce the Communion of the <HI>Churches</HI> themselves. And I believe, none but such as have their <HI>Brain heated</HI> with the strange Fire of <HI>Bigotry</HI> to the English Episcopacy and Liturgy, and have got little narrow <HI>Party-Notions,</HI> the very Reverse to those of the <HI>first Refor∣mers,</HI> can ever have it enter into their Head to imagine, that the <HI>Church of England</HI> has sat up herself for the <HI>only</HI> true Church upon Earth.</P>
<P>Her 19th <HI>Article</HI> expresses no such Schismatick Spirit; but frames the Defi∣nition of a <HI>Church</HI> lawfully constituted, in such large and general Terms, as to comprehend all the <HI>Foreign</HI> Protestant Churches, as well as herself. Thus says the <HI>Article,—"A visible Church of Christ is a Congregation of faithful Men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly administred ac∣cording to Christ's Ordinance, in all those Things that of Necessity are requisite to the same."</HI> Bp. BURNET has this Remark upon it among others—<Q>We ought to <HI>search</HI> the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and then according as we find the <HI>Doc∣trine</HI> of any <HI>Church</HI> to be <HI>true</HI> in the Fundamentals, we ought to believe her to be a <HI>true Church:</HI> And if besides this, the whole Extent of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> together not only with the essential Parts of the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> but the whole Administration of them and the other Rituals of any Church are <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>true,</HI> then we ought to account such a Church <HI>true</HI> in the largest Sense of the Word <HI>True;</HI> and by Consequence we ought to hold <HI>Communion</HI> with it.</Q>—Surely then the <HI>Church of England</HI> could not intend to confine her <HI>Clergy</HI> to her own Communion alone: and the <HI>Article</HI> leaves every one to the Exercise of his <HI>own</HI> private Judg∣ment. The <HI>Bishop'</HI>s Exposition of this Article might be confirm'd, I doubt not, from the <HI>Homilies</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and from the Writings of the English Bishops and Divines in the beginning of the Reformation, which are the best Commentaries on the <HI>Articles.</HI> Re∣markable is that Passage of the famous HOOKER, in his <HI>Ecclesiastical Polity</HI> (Lib. 3. Sec. 11.)—<Q>For my own Part, altho' I see that certain <HI>Re∣formed Churches,</HI> the SCOTTISH especially and the FRENCH, have not that which <HI>best</HI> agreeth with the sacred Scripture, I mean the Government that is by <HI>Bishops,</HI> inasmuch as both those Churches are fallen under a different Kind of Regiment, which for the one it is altogether too <HI>late,</HI> and too <HI>soon</HI> for the other, during their present Affliction and Trouble, this their Defect and Imperfection I had rather lament in such Case than exagitate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>—After this, <HI>Sir,</HI> I presume, none can reasonably imagine, the great HOOKER condemn'd and disclaim'd the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the SCOTTISH, or other <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Churches abroad. And <HI>he</HI> doubtless spake what was the general Sense of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in his Day.—But further, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is worthy of Remark, that sometimes Ministers having only <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Orders have been admitted (without Re-ordination) to officiate in the
<PB N="21" REF="005594_0020_1026A8080AACC9C0"/>
Church of <HI>England.</HI> For Instance, as Mr. <HI>Strype,</HI> in his Life of GRINDAL A. Bp. of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> informs us, the said <HI>Arch bishop</HI> licensed Mr. <HI>John Morrison,</HI> a Scotch Divine, to preach and administer the Sacraments any where within his Province, by Virtue of his <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ordination. In his Licence 'tis expresly noticed of him, <Q>He had been admitted to <HI>holy Orders</HI> about five years before, by the Synod (or Presbytery) of <HI>Lothian,</HI> according to the LAUDABLE <HI>Form and Rite of the Reformed Church of</HI> SCOTLAND.</Q>—Again, 'tis observable, the Church of <HI>England</HI> has not scrupled to do publick Honour to the Church of SCOTLAND, even at a Time when the said <HI>Scottish</HI> Church was <HI>presbyterian</HI> in her Constitution. For so it was, when the <HI>Canons</HI> were compiled: and yet in the 55th, which is the <HI>Canon</HI> prescribing the Preacher's <HI>Form of Prayer before Sermon,</HI> it is there enjoined on the Clergy to pray for the <HI>Church of</HI> SCOTLAND by Name.—I hope, this has not been any Occasion of the modern Clergy's customary Omission of the <HI>Canonical Form.</HI>—However, I shall rest it with your Judgment, whether it be likely, that the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> which by a solemn <HI>Canon</HI> and <HI>Constitution</HI> appoints the Church of SCOTLAND to be expresly pray'd for by all the Clergy, should ever design to brand the <HI>Ministry</HI> of that Church as false or invalid, by Precluding her Sons from all occasional <HI>Commerce</HI> therewith in sacred Administrations: which must be the Effect, if she has set such Limits to them in Relation to <HI>the Use of the Common-Prayer,</HI> as that without this, they must on no Occasion presume publickly to officiate in the Church of SCOTLAND.—Again, <HI>Sir,</HI> it must needs be granted, the Church of SCOTLAND stands at least on equal Terms with the <HI>English Church,</HI> as the Church of GENEVA. And yet, if you have seen a certain <HI>Letter</HI> from the University of OXFORD (dated Feb. 5. 1706.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) and approv'd by her Masters and Doctors in a general Convo∣cation, which they sent to the <HI>Genevan</HI> Ministers, you may observe, 'tis directed <HI>To the Rev. Pastors of the Church of</HI> GENEVA: and in the Body of the Epistle you find their Testimony in these Words, <Q><HI>The most ce∣lebrated of our Divines</HI> have ALWAYS been FAR from pronouncing such a Sentence on your Church, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> it's being destitute of LAWFUL PASTORS, and <HI>Sacraments</HI> rightly administred.</Q>—Now it's well known, the Church of GENEVA is <HI>Calvinian</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian;</HI> and yet by the solemn Act of this famous <HI>English University,</HI> 'tis expresly own'd to have LAWFUL PASTORS and RIGHT <HI>Administration of Sacraments.</HI> In this, we may rati∣onally conceive, they speak but the real Sense of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> And after this, can it with any Shadow of Reason be surmis'd, that <HI>this University,</HI> or <HI>this Church,</HI> wou'd refuse Communion with the Church of GENEVA, by prohibiting her SONS <HI>occasional Conformity</HI> there, or Com∣munion with her <HI>lawful Pasters,</HI> by assisting them in the Word or <HI>Sacra∣ments rightly administred!</HI> Why then should we imagine Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> one of the Sons of <HI>Oxford,</HI> restrain'd by his Subscription from commu∣nicating with the Church of SCOTLAND, as <HI>laudable</HI> a reformed Church as
<PB N="22" REF="005594_0021_1026A80B25D7B2C8"/>
that of <HI>Geneva?</HI> It were a Reproach upon the <HI>Church of England,</HI> to suppose she meant this.</P>
<P>I'm sure, there's no Colour of Reason for this dishonourable Tho't, from the <HI>Church-Article</HI> (23<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) <HI>Of ministring in the Congregation:</HI> where we have a <HI>Definition</HI> of those that are <HI>lawfully ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed and sent</HI> to dispense the Things of God.

The <HI>Article</HI> (says he) does not resolve this into any <HI>particular</HI> Constitution: but leaves the Matter open and at large, for such Accidents as had happened, and such as might still happen. Those who drew it, had the State of the <HI>several Churches</HI> before their Eyes, that had been <HI>differently reform∣ed,</HI></Q> &amp;c.—The <HI>Bishop</HI> afterwards observes, <Q>We are very sure, that not only Those who penned the <HI>Articles,</HI> but the <HI>Body of this Church</HI> for a∣bove half an Age after, did—acknowledge the <HI>foreign Churches</HI>—to be <HI>true</HI> Churches, as to all the Essentials of a Church, though they had been at first irregularly formed, and continued still in that imperfect State. And therefore the <HI>general</HI> Words, in which this Part of the <HI>Article</HI> is framed, seem designed on Purpose <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to exclude them.</HI></Q>—He closes his Exposition with this Observation,—<Q>And thus what Thoughts soever <HI>pri∣vate Men,</HI> as they are Divines, may have of those irregular Steps, the <HI>Article of the Church</HI> is conceived in such large and general Words, that no Man by <HI>subscribing</HI> it is bound up from <HI>freer and more comprehensive Thoughts.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Article</HI> (view'd in this Light the Bp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sets it in) Mr.<HI>W—d</HI> has sub∣scrib'd to, and that <HI>willingly</HI> and <HI>ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>animo,</HI> believing it <HI>agreeable to the Word of God:</HI> And finding the <HI>other Churches </HI> abroad, tho' <HI>reform'd differently</HI> from the <HI>Church of England,</HI> yet by the <HI>Articles</HI> were not deny'd, but implicitly own∣ed to be true <HI>Churches,</HI> and that "neither our Reformers, nor their Suc∣cessors for near 80 Years after the <HI>Articles</HI> were published, did ever questi∣on the Constitution of such Churches;" and finding himself, <Q><HI>not bound up from</HI> those <HI>freer and more comprehensive Thoughts,</HI></Q> to which he was dispos'd, but rather <HI>bound to</HI> them, by <HI>subscribing</HI> to the <HI>Articles</HI> of the Church; he did therefore justly conclude himself but in the Exercise of his lawful Liberty, if not Duty, while practising <HI>Occasional Conformity</HI> in the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and holding Communion with the <HI>Clergy</HI> there, whom, according to the Article, he <HI>ought to judge lawfully called and sent into the

Lord's Fineyard,</HI> and so to judge himself by his Subscription obliged to receive and own as his Brethren in the Fellowship of the Gospel.</P>
<P>I may further observe, that since the <HI>Union</HI> of the two Kingdoms, when the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> (tho' differently reformed) was put on the same Foot with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in Point of Legal Establishment, it can∣not (I think) be reasonably call'd in Question, whether the two <HI>National Churches,</HI> are not to be reputed in <HI>full Charity</HI> with one another, as <HI>Sister-Churches,</HI> notwithstanding their varying Constitutions, and Orders, Rites and Customs, in Point of Worthy and Discipline.—And in this State of the Case surely <HI>occasional Communion</HI> of these two established Churches with one another, particularly by their <HI>Clergy</HI> in publick Acts of mutual Assistance and <HI>Pulpit-Help</HI> in special, as they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air Opportunity, and so far as may well consist with the Conservation of their respective <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orms, Or∣ders and Constitutions Ecclesiastical, appears one very significant Expres∣sion of their mutual <HI>Charity</HI> and christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>Union.</HI>—Where there's a Con∣cord between two Churches in the Essentials of Christianity, a known <HI>Unity of Faith,</HI> in Things necessary and fundamental, and besides this an <HI>Unity of Worship,</HI> by an Agreement in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general Things necessary and essential to christian Worship, here's (as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should seem) a loud Call to mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual <HI>Forbearance,</HI> and <HI>Compliance</HI> in the les<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Modalities of Religion as far as will stand with an upright Conscience: and methinks, if it looks like a criminal <HI>Frowardness</HI> and <HI>schismatical</HI> Humour in <HI>one of these Churches</HI> to obtrude her peculiar Opinion and Practice upon <HI>the other</HI> in those <HI>ex∣tra-essential</HI> Points, wherein they differ, as indispensable Terms of Com∣munion of Members, it is certainly worse still in that Church to interdict her <HI>Clergy</HI> from all occasional Communion with the other, where they see Light for a <HI>Compliance.</HI> To suppose the <HI>Church of England</HI> hath done this, is to cast a black Reproach upon her, as a <HI>Separatist</HI> from the whole christian World: Nor indeed can I discover any just Foundation for so unworthy a Tho't of her. At least I can see nothing at all in her Book of <HI>Articles,</HI> which the Clergy subscribe to, that carries the Face of this: Nor am I appris'd of any authentick or valuable <HI>Exposition,</HI> that carries the Sense of them this Way. Forward <HI>Imposers</HI> of Episcopal Forms and Orders may perhaps interpret the <HI>Articles</HI> into this Sense▪ But I know of no <HI>Authority</HI> they have to interpret them for <HI>others.</HI> The <HI>Clergy,</HI> le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the free Exercise of their private Judgment, will doubt∣less <HI>interpret differently</HI> the common Rules, they have <HI>subscrib'd</HI> to: and as every one has a Right to enjoy his own <HI>private Thoughts</HI> in disputable Matters, so likewise has he a Right to <HI>act</HI> upon 'em, where he does not see such Exercise of his Liberty will interfere with the <HI>publick Good,</HI> the avowed Design of all Law and Rule.</P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> esteeming himself at Liberty to conduct in the Case of <HI>occasional Communion</HI> as should (all Circumstances weighed) appear best and most eligible in his own private Judgment, has been
<PB N="24" REF="005594_0023_1026A81187D14820"/>
pleas'd to use his lawful Liberty when in SCOTLAND, by practising <HI>occa∣sional Fellowship</HI> with that allowedly true and reformed Church, and e∣qually established by Law as the <HI>Church of England,</HI> which he belong'd to. Nor, after this View of the Case, can I imagine e'er a <HI>Bishop in England</HI> would presume to call Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> to an Account, and censure him for his Occasional Conformity and Communion with the <HI>Church of</HI> SCOTLAND. I think, this would be a flying in the Face of their own <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Canons▪</HI> as well as of <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason.</HI> As for the <HI>Word of God,</HI> the great Charter of our holy Religion, this not only teaches us, that there is <HI>one Lord,</HI> and <HI>one Body,</HI> but requires Christians to <HI>keep the Unity of the Spirit;</HI> and therefore, when Providence gives an Opportuni∣ty, forbids them to <HI>refuse Communion</HI> with a true Church, <HI>holding the Head,</HI> and in point of religious Rituals (as well as Opinions) imposing nothing repugnant to Scripture-Rule.—As for the Voice of <HI>Reason,</HI> this con∣firms the Dictates of Revelation in the Case. Every one's own Reason must inform him, that <HI>Duty</HI> admits of <HI>Alteration</HI> according to the Varie∣ty of <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Situations</HI> a Man may be in: so that what may be of <HI>Obligation</HI> in one Season, or Circumstance, is <HI>not</HI> so in another. For In∣stance, the Interposition of <HI>publick Authority</HI> may, in Things <HI>indifferent,</HI> very much alter a Case, and make that a <HI>Duty,</HI> or <HI>expedient,</HI> which otherwise we might think to be not so. At least this is the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in her 30th <HI>Canon,</HI> which says, <Q><HI>Things of themselves</HI> indifferent <HI>do in some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort</HI> alter their Natures, <HI>when they are either</HI> commanded <HI>or</HI> forbidden <HI>by a lawful Magistrate, and may not be</HI> omitted <HI>at every Man's Pleasure, contrary to the Law, when they be</HI> com∣manded, <HI>nor</HI> used <HI>when they are</HI> prohibited.</Q>—I may justly add upon it, That where they are neither <HI>commanded</HI> nor <HI>prohibited</HI> by Law, and so are left in their native State of <HI>Indifference,</HI> here certainly it is at <HI>every Man's Pleasure,</HI> either to <HI>use</HI> or to <HI>omit</HI> them, as he judges (upon Consideration of all Circumstances) wisest and most expedient, both in Re∣gard to his own private Benefit and the publick Good.—The Alteration of <HI>Place,</HI> in point of settled Abode, or occasional Residence, very often produces an Alteration in point of <HI>Duty.</HI> It's a Maxim founded in Rea∣son, that <HI>where</HI> the <HI>Grounds</HI> of any Duty no longer subsist, <HI>there</HI> the <HI>Ob∣ligation</HI> is discontinu'd. Thus the special Oath of a <HI>Justice</HI> obliges him while in his own proper County or Circuit: but ceases to bind him, in point of Action, when <HI>out</HI> of his Civil Boundaries▪ And, to reduce this to the Case before us, why should it be tho't, the special Promise and Subscription of a <HI>Clergyman</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> in Relation to the <HI>Use</HI> of her Forms and Orders, is any more binding to him when not per∣sonally <HI>within the Church or Realm?</HI> The main End of the said <HI>Subscrip∣tion</HI> is doubtless to keep up <HI>Uniformity</HI> of publick Worship WITHIN THE CHURCH, and maintain <HI>the common Order of the Church</HI> within his Majes∣ty's <HI>Realm of</HI> ENGLAND. And how that is infring'd by Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI>s

<HI>occasional Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormity,</HI> which he practises when <HI>abroad,</HI> out of the Bounds of the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Realm,</HI> is a Difficulty, that I want to have solv'd.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> I conclude, is of Opinion with the Church of <HI>England</HI> in her 34th <HI>Article,</HI> which he has subscrib'd with the rest, and where we read, <Q>It is not necessary, that <HI>Traditions and Ceremonies be</HI> in all Places <HI>one, or ut∣terly alike: for at all Times they have been divers, and may be changed ac∣cording to the Diversity of</HI> Countries, Times, <HI>and</HI> Men's Manners, <HI>so that nothing be ordain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</HI> against God's Word.—<HI>Every Particular or National Church hath Authority to ordain, change, and abolish Ceremonies or Rites of the Church, ordained only by Man's Authority,</HI> so that <HI>all Things be done to Edifying.</HI></Q>—Well, pursuant to his <HI>Subscription</HI> to this <HI>Article,</HI> and in full Accord with the Principles there advanced, was Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI>s Practice when in SCOTLAND; where he might justly hold himself, by this <HI>Article,</HI> at least permitted and authoriz'd occasionally to <HI>conform</HI> to the Mode of Worship in <HI>that Country,</HI> as not apprehending the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame <HI>repugnant to the Word of God;</HI> and in Consequence of this his Apprehension, might rea∣sonably look upon himself, by his <HI>Subscription,</HI> oblig'd <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to offend against the common Order of the Church by Law establish'd</HI> THERE, as well as not to offend, when in ENGLAND, against the common Order of the Church <HI>there</HI> establish'd by Law.</P>
<P>Now the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, in Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI>s View of it, as well as in mine, is much the same here in <HI>New England;</HI> which is a Country of <HI>Nonconformists,</HI> a Peo∣ple though subject to the KING of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> yet not included <HI>within his Realm of</HI> ENGLAND, any more than his Majesty's Subjects in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and who not only enjoy full Liberty of Conscience by Royal <HI>Charter,</HI> but have our Ecclesiastical Immunities, Privileges and Usages in Religion, rati∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y'd and confirm'd, and fully secured to us by express <HI>Law,</HI> under the ROY∣AL Sanction; as good a Tenure, for ought I know, if not as that by which the <HI>Church of England</HI> herself holds the Rights of her <HI>National Hierarchy</HI> in general, yet at least as that by which the <HI>Bishops</HI> hold their Right to govern by her <HI>Canons</HI> and <HI>Constitutions Ecclesiastical.</HI> If therefore Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> tho' by Profession and Character an Episcopal Clergyman, finds a Freedom in his Conscience to associate himself to the Communion of our <HI>Congregational</HI> Churches, and to minister in our <HI>Pulpits,</HI> he may justly repute himself vir∣tually <HI>licensed</HI> by the 34th <HI>Article</HI> of his own Church to do it, and by his very <HI>Subscription</HI> inhibited and restrained from <HI>offending against the common Order of the</HI> Worship of God in this Land. So far is Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> as a Mi∣nister of the <HI>Church of England</HI> from being legally forbidden, that he is ra∣ther legally required, and by Virtue of his own <HI>Subscription</HI> solemnly en∣gaged and bound to practise <HI>Occasional Conformity</HI> to the receiv'd Customs and Usages of the Country, in Religious Worship, tho' <HI>varying</HI> from the Episcopal Rites and Modes; while he sees no <HI>Repugnancy</HI> in them to the <HI>Word of God,</HI> nor indeed (in Strictness of Speech) any <HI>Repugnancy</HI> to the
<PB N="26" REF="005594_0025_1026A8171B36A8D8"/>
Requirements of <HI>his own Church.</HI> For you are sensible, Sir, that then is one <HI>Law</HI> properly said to be <HI>repugnant</HI> to another, when these Laws are not only of a <HI>contrary Tenor,</HI> but made by lawful Authority obliging to People of the <HI>same Place.</HI> This is plain, I think, in the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <HI>Acts of Parlia∣ment</HI> touching Civil Matters: which, unless they expresly name the <HI>Planta∣tions,</HI> or his Majesty's Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> or the like, these are taken to be <HI>not included</HI> within the said <HI>National Laws;</HI> or at least the <HI>Charter-Go∣vernments</HI> here are not understood to be precluded from their Privilege of making Acts and Laws touching the same Matters, of a <HI>contrary</HI> or <HI>differ∣ent Tenor,</HI> which, nevertheless, are not deem'd <HI>repugnant</HI> to the Laws of the Nation.—Now, Sir, I believe, you are also sensible, that the <HI>Canons</HI> &amp; <HI>Consti∣tutions Ecclesiastical,</HI> in whatever Force at Home, don't at all affect us in <HI>foreign Parts,</HI> by dint of their own Authority, but only in the Case of vo∣luntary Submission: Nor can these <HI>Church-Canons</HI> be suppos'd to affect us, in the present State of our Civil Policy, unless by some <HI>Law of our own</HI> they were adopted and enforc'd, or else by some <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> they had their Authority and binding Force extended to the King's <HI>foreign</HI> Co∣lonies, Provinces and Plantations in <HI>America.</HI> You may observe, <HI>Sir,</HI> that even King JAMES, in his <HI>Letters Patent</HI> ratifying and establishing the said <HI>Constitutions</HI> and <HI>Canons,</HI> does not carry his Injunction of observing and ex∣ecuting the same beyond the Limits of "the Province of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>York</HI>", in his Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI> Neither indeed does the <HI>Act of Uni∣formity</HI> itself touch the <HI>Plantations,</HI> but is confin'd expresly to the Bounds of ENGLAND and WALES, and the Town of <HI>Berwick.</HI>—It is impossible therefore, I think, for Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> in the present Case, to be <HI>Convinced of the Law as a Transgressor:</HI> for, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith the Scripture, <HI>Where no Law is, there is no Transgression. For Sin is the Transgression of the Law.</HI> Therefore, <HI>Sin is not imputed, when there is no Law.</HI>—And in Truth, as for such in <HI>foreign Parts</HI> that have gone over to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and volunta∣rily oblig'd themselves by the <HI>Clergy-Subscription,</HI> and <HI>Oath of Canonical O∣bedience,</HI> I am at a Loss, among those that <HI>exercise any Ecclesiastical Juris∣diction</HI> within the <HI>Realm,</HI> WHO it is that is their proper <HI>Bishop,</HI> or <HI>Ordinary,</HI> to whom they are duly subjected, either by <HI>Royal</HI> Order, or by <HI>Parliamentary</HI> Decision; one or other of which, for ought I can see, in the present State of Things, is the only Foot, on which any Prelate of <HI>England</HI> can pretend a lawful Right and Authority to <HI>exercise Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</HI> in these his Majesty's remote Dominions, or have Power to enjoin the <HI>Church-Ca∣nons, Constitutions</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> upon the Episcopal Clergy here, and in Con∣sequence thereof to punish Delinquents. And in my humble Opinion, if any <HI>Bishop</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> takes upon him to exercise such <HI>Jurisdic∣tion</HI> here without lawful Right, he makes an unjustifiable Excursion beyond his proper Line; and his <HI>extra-diocesan</HI> Censures in the Case of any Clergy-Man's

being tax'd with Misconduct in <HI>New-England,</HI> might be easily war∣ded off by a <HI>foreign Plea</HI> produced in Court against him, or an Appeal <HI>à Judice non compe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e.</HI></P>
<P>Now, tho' Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> did in <HI>England</HI> submit to the usual <HI>Subscription</HI> and <HI>Oath,</HI> yet the Obligation upon him to <HI>Canonical Obedience</HI> cannot, in any just Construction, be judg'd more than <HI>co-extensive</HI> with the binding Force of the <HI>Canons</HI> &amp; <HI>Constitutions</HI> themselves, or more than commensurate with the lawful Authority and Power of <HI>his Ordinary and other chief Ministers of the Church, unto whom has been committed the Charge and Government over him.</HI>—It is worthy of Notice, <HI>Sir,</HI> that when the <HI>Governours of the Church</HI> do not enforce any particular <HI>Canon</HI> by their express <HI>Injunction</HI> thereof, and Demand of <HI>Con∣formity</HI> to it in their proper Ecclesiastical Districts, then the <HI>Clergy</HI> (as some of their most judicious Writers inform us, is their common Sense upon the Case) do not hold themselves bound by their <HI>Oath,</HI> to conform and obey in such Instance: Nor indeed, if an actual <HI>Demand</HI> be made, do they look upon themselves oblig'd to <HI>absolute</HI> Obedience to the <HI>Canon,</HI> exclusive of their own Right of <HI>private Judgment,</HI> which (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame Writers observe) is always suppos'd reserved to them inviolate. And surely then, <HI>Where</HI> the Governours of the <HI>Church of England</HI> have <HI>no Power</HI> to execute the Canons, <HI>no lawful Authority</HI> to enjoin them, so consequently <HI>no Right</HI> to demand O∣bedience, it's self-evident, that <HI>There</HI> the Clergy's <HI>Oath</HI> of Canonical Obe∣dience is of <HI>no Force</HI> to bind their Conscience.—This Argument I think a full Vindication of Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI>s Conduct (equally in <HI>New-England,</HI> as in <HI>Scotland</HI>) with Regard to his <HI>disusing</HI> the <HI>Church-Form</HI> in publick Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments, notwithstanding what our <HI>Author</HI> has pleaded against him from the <HI>Articles</HI> and <HI>Cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI>—And I must profess, upon the whole, I can see no <HI>Obligation</HI> on him, nor just <HI>Reason</HI> as yet for him, either to "renounce his <HI>Subscription,</HI> or to alter his <HI>Conduct</HI>". He's re∣duc'd to no such <HI>Dilemma</HI> at present: but without gratifying our <HI>Author</HI> in either Part of his Admonition, may still "approve himself a <HI>Consistent upright Man.</HI>"</P>
<P>But so much for this Time. You'll excuse the delaying my further Remarks, for the Contents of my next. In the mean Time, let us pray for Light, and Grace, and Peace, thro' our Lord Jesus Christ, to be multiply'd to us, and to all his Ministers and People.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I'M now a little at Leasure to attend the LETTER in its next Paragraph, where our <HI>Author</HI> essays to <HI>obviate</HI> an excusatory Plea, that he thought
<PB N="28" REF="005594_0027_1026A81C980B1338"/>
probably Mr.<HI>W—d</HI> might alledge in Favour of his Conduct, from the Ex∣ample of "<HI>other the Church-Clergy, who may act as little consistently, in other Respect But this,</HI> says he, <HI>is nothing to the Point in hand.</HI>"—However, I think it not so generous a part in him, to refuse Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> the Advan∣tage of a Plea in Apology for himself, which if his Conduct be really cul∣pable, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure will not justify, yet may extenuate it.—And if it be Fact, that Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> does <HI>herein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct as consistently as others of the</HI> Church-Clergy <HI>do in other respects,</HI> I can't<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> think with our <HI>Author,</HI> that his pleading <HI>this</HI> would be <HI>nothing to the Point in hand.</HI> For there may be Cases, wherein approv'd general <HI>Example,</HI> or allow'd prevalent <HI>Custom,</HI> which very much gives the publick or common Sense of a receiv'd <HI>Rule,</HI> is justly im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovable by a particular Person in Vindication of his Conduct, either directly with relation to <HI>that,</HI> or with relation to any other <HI>like Rule,</HI> by proportion, and parity of Reason. Thus, in the present Case of <HI>Subscription</HI> to the stated <HI>Use of the Form of Prayer in the Common prayer-book prescribed, in publick Prayer, and none other,</HI>—if the Meaning be screw'd up to the Height, if the Expression be understood in its Rigour, and taken absolutely, without any Reserve, without Exception of any possible Case, or any the least Abate∣ment of the Sense, I say, then the <HI>whole Body</HI> of the Episcopal <HI>Clergy</HI> thro' the Nation, at home and abroad, are liable to fall into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame Condem∣nation with Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> as <HI>Violators</HI> of their <HI>Subscription.</HI> For (as already observ'd) it's their common Practice, in their <HI>Pulpit▪Prayer</HI> (or Prayer <HI>be∣fore Sermon</HI>) to vary from the prescript Form; either instead thereof using some <HI>Collect</HI> in the Book, not appointed specially for that Occasion, or using a Form of <HI>their own composing,</HI> or else praying in the <HI>extempore-way,</HI> just as their several Inclinations lead them. The universal <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> of the Church, in thus taking Liberty to order their <HI>Pulpit-Prayer,</HI> every Man as he pleaseth, notwithstanding they have <HI>subscrib'd</HI> to use the <HI>appointed Form,</HI> AND NONE OTHER, manifests it to be the <HI>common Sense</HI> of the whole Body of the Clergy, that they are not under an absolute total <HI>Restraint</HI> from <HI>free-praying,</HI> in the publick Assembly, as our <HI>Author</HI> seems to represent their Case; and therefore that their <HI>Subscription</HI> is not to be understood in the Strict∣ness of the <HI>Letter,</HI> but admits of a <HI>qualify'd</HI> Sense.—And it is a Considerati∣on, which serves to strengthen my Argument, that notwithstanding the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI> have often <HI>alledg'd</HI> this in Controversy, as a Vindication of <HI>their</HI> Manner of praying, against the Reproaches cast upon it by certain Bigots to the <HI>Li∣turgy,</HI> yet it has occasion'd no <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>Clergy'</HI>s Practice: And tho' some over-heated Zealots among the <HI>Church▪Clergy</HI> have often complain'd of this <HI>free-praying</HI> before Sermon, as an unwarrantable Innovation and Ir∣regularity, which <HI>Dissenters</HI> make an ill Handle of, to serve their Cause, yet it has never produc'd any public <HI>Censure</HI> on the Practice. Nay, I presume, even the <HI>Bishops</HI> conform to the prevailing Usage, and do themselves neg∣lect the establish'd Rule in this Instance, nor make any Scruple of <HI>using</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="005594_0028_1026A81E39338248"/>
OTHER <HI>Form or Manner of praying before Sermon,</HI> than is by public Autho∣rity <HI>prescribed</HI> in that Case.—It's well known, the <HI>Bidding Form</HI> (so called) is long since antiquated, and grown out of Date; no longer used I suppose, by a single Man of the <HI>Clergy.</HI>—There is such a Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct, as <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Canons</HI> being antiquated, or generally and practically dispensed with, tho' never formally and authoritatively repeal'd. And in such Case the Go∣vernment does not interpose, to exact the Observance of those obsolete Rules, or punish the Violation of them.—Therefore, Sir, You must not strain the Point of <HI>Subscription,</HI> as our <HI>Author</HI> has done in Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI>s Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t you should <HI>condemn the Body of the Clergy of this Generation,</HI> yea, and of past Generations too, as <HI>"acting a wicked insincere Part,"</HI> while varying from the <HI>Common Order of the Church,</HI> in the Instance above-mention'd. Surely we should make all possible Allowances, to avoid breaking <HI>Charity:</HI> and the Case now before us has an equal Claim to our Candour, I think, as the other.</P>
<P>Do (Sir) but consider Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> as standing in an EPISCOPAL <HI>Pulpit,</HI> in any one such thro' all <HI>England, Ireland,</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> and you'll find he is allow'd by <HI>Custom,</HI> which they say is <HI>Common Law,</HI> to depart from the prescrib'd <HI>Form,</HI> and to practise <HI>praying freely,</HI> just in the Manner he does at this Time in <HI>New England;</HI>—the same which, I suppose, he was wont to do in <HI>England,</HI> while he had the Use of the <HI>Publick Churches,</HI>—NO MAN FORBIDDING HIM. The only Difference is, that in that Case, besides the <HI>Pulpit-free-prayer,</HI> there must be the proper <HI>Forms</HI> for the <HI>Reading-Desk</HI> previously us'd, by himself or another.—While then you suspect him of <HI>violating his Subscription,</HI> you will do well <HI>(Sir)</HI> to take Care that you be not <HI>Partial in the Law.</HI></P>
<P>Please, Sir, to consider, as Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> is Providentially here in these Parts, and dispos'd (so he solemnly professes) upon the Principles of Brotherly Kindness and Charity, and the Communion of Saints, to cultivate a Corre∣spondence with the Churches and Ministers of <HI>New England,</HI> hoping to sub∣serve the best Interest of this People, and willing for that Purpose to <HI>mini∣ster in the Congregations</HI> here, who are also willing (many of them at least) to attend his Ministrations, but still perhaps generally scrupulous of joining with him in the Use of the <HI>Liturgy;</HI> is there not a visible Necessi∣ty, in the Case, if he officiates in <HI>Preaching,</HI> that upon the Gospel-Rule of <HI>pleasing others for their Good to Edification,</HI> and <HI>giving none Offence,</HI> he o∣mit the Use of the <HI>Prayer▪Book</HI> on such Occasions, and pray <HI>memoriter,</HI> or pray <HI>extempore,</HI> or else not pray at all!—And if in such Case he chuses the <HI>unstinted</HI> Way, <HI>Can any Man forbid</HI> the Use of a natural Right and a spiritual Gift, that <HI>he</HI> should not pray in this free Manner, <HI>as well as we?</HI>—Nor indeed, Sir, is Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> the <HI>only</HI> Example in this kind, that has been known in <HI>New-England.</HI> An Instance, within my

own Memory, I think it not amiss to mention. A <HI>Clergyman</HI> of the Church, whom I was well acquainted with, and a Gentleman of stanch Conformist-Principles, both as to Episcopacy and Liturgy, as well as of a good Beha∣viour, I mean the late Rev. Mr. <HI>Christopher Bridge,</HI> formerly QUEEN's Chap∣lain at the Chappel in <HI>Boston,</HI> but afterwards of <HI>Rye,</HI> happning (I think it was the Case more than once) occasionally in his Travels thro' <HI>Connecticut</HI> to be on the Lord's-day at <HI>Stonington</HI> (as I remember) where the <HI>aged</HI> and <HI>venerable</HI> Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI> was then Minister, and being kindly invited by him in∣to his <HI>Pulpit,</HI> he readily comply'd to give him his Help, and in his <HI>Prayers</HI> before and after Sermon, conform'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>like Mr. <HI>W—d</HI>▪ to the Custom of the Place, making no Use of his <HI>Book;</HI> nor indeed making any Use of Notes in his Preaching.—I had the Account from his own Mouth.—And tho' the Bond of <HI>Subscription</HI> was the same in his Case, as in Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI>s, yet I cou'd never perceive that <HI>he</HI> himself in the least suspected his having <HI>violated</HI> it in that Article of his Conduct, but us'd to speak of it as an Example of <HI>Candour</HI> on both Sides: nor can I learn that the Reproach was ever cast upon <HI>him</HI> from any Quarter, of <HI>acting a wicked insincere Part,</HI> in what he did on that Occasion. I think, <HI>this is to the Point in Hand;</HI> nor can our <HI>Author</HI> turn it off with saying, it was an acting inconsistently <HI>"in other Respects▪"</HI> for Mr. <HI>Bridge</HI> and Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> appear to be in the same Predicament.</P>
<P>But to go on with our <HI>Author</HI>—</P>
<P>He next mentions a PROMISE the Clergy of the Church make at their entring into <HI>Orders,</HI> in Answer to a Question put to them by the <HI>Bishop;</HI> and which Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> "hath solemnly and repeatedly <HI>sealed his Approbation of at the blessed Sacrament:</HI>" importing, that he resolv'd "<HI>by the Help of the Lord, to give his faithful Diligence</HI> ALWAYS <HI>to minister the Doctrine, and</HI> SACRAMENTS, <HI>and Discipline of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>as the</HI> LORD <HI>hath commanded, and</HI> AS THIS CHURCH AND REALM HATH RECEIVED THE SAME ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF GOD, <HI>so that he may teach the People com∣mitted to his Care and Charge with all Diligence to keep and observe the same.</HI>" Now our <HI>Author</HI> suspects Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI>s Practice in <HI>New-England</HI> by <HI>conforming</HI> to the Manner of these Churches, and not keeping to the Rules and Forms of his own <HI>Communion-Book,</HI> in <HI>ministring the Sacrament</HI> among us▪ is an "open <HI>Violation</HI> of his <HI>Promise</HI>" aforesaid; and seems to think him justly accusable of "<HI>aggravated Prevarication,</HI> to say nothing worse."</P>
<P>But I think, <HI>Sir,</HI> the <HI>Difficulty</HI> here (take it at the worst) is not <HI>indissolu∣ble:</HI> but admits of much the same easy Solution, as that before on the head of <HI>Subscription.</HI> This <HI>Declaration</HI> or <HI>Promise</HI> at entring into holy Orders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>I mean so far as it relates to the PARTICULAR MODE of <HI>Ministration</HI> used in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> carries with it, not an absolute and unbounded, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> only a <HI>local</HI> and <HI>limited</HI> Obligation.—Its binding Force upon the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r, even at the very largest Extent in Reason supposable, is only while he is personally residing WITHIN THE CHURCH AND REALM, where the
<PB N="31" REF="005594_0030_1026A8238E73D440"/>
<HI>Episcopal</HI> Ordinances, Canons and Constitutions are receiv'd and held in Force.—Nor does the Particle (ALWAYS) which our Author puts an Em∣phasis upon, alter the Case, or stretch the Sense beyond the Bounds menti∣oned. You can't be insensible, <HI>Sir,</HI> that such Terms of <HI>Universality,</HI> tho' deliver'd absolutely, are often to be constru'd in a more lax and qualify'd Sense: in many Cases, the very Nature and Reason of Things obliges us to <HI>not</HI> take them in the most extensive Sense, but to put some Restriction upon their Meaning. Nor is it acting an ingenuous Part, to urge so migh∣ty a <HI>Consequence,</HI> as is depending in the present Case, upon the meer Force of a <HI>Word,</HI> taken by our Author in an <HI>unrestrain'd,</HI> when it fairly admits of a <HI>limited</HI> Signification. And as it is here apply'd, it must be understood with some Abatements from the strong <HI>universal</HI> Sense. For Instance, un∣derstanding the <HI>Promise</HI> here of a direct Promise ALWAYS <HI>to minister,</HI> &amp;c. may it not admit of such limited Constructions as the following? ALWAYS so long as I am <HI>where</HI> I MAY <HI>minister</HI> in this Form and Manner.—(For what a learned Defender of the Church of England has said about the <HI>Burial-Office</HI> in particular, I think is applicable as to all the Offices and Forms in general, "<HI>We</HI> [the Clergy]<HI>give our Assent to the Use of it,</HI> where <HI>it may be used, and that is all.</HI>") Or, ALWAYS, so long as I am <HI>residing in any Dio∣cess:</HI>—Or, ALWAYS, so long as I am <HI>within the Church and Realm of</HI> Eng∣land, where this Form of <HI>Ministration</HI> is <HI>received</HI> as <HI>according to the Com∣mandments of God.</HI>—And it's observable, the Manner of Expression in the <HI>Promise</HI> itself [<HI>as this</HI> CHURCH <HI>and</HI> REALM <HI>hath received the same</HI>] points us very plainly to the last Restriction. And I conclude, Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> when ministring in the publick Churches, has never been wanting to his Pro∣mise, but ALWAYS careful to practise full <HI>Conformity</HI> to the <HI>Church of Eng∣land,</HI> in his Sacramental Ministrations, during his Stay <HI>within the Realm.</HI></P>
<P>But still, upon a Review of this <HI>Promise,</HI> I find by the Tenor of it Room for another <HI>Restriction,</HI> which reduces the Obligation of it within the narrow∣est Limits, not exceeding the Bounds of even that single <HI>Congregation,</HI> where he has <HI>Charge.</HI> Surely, His <HI>Promise</HI> in Answer to the <HI>Question</HI> put to him at Ordination, ought in all Reason to be interpreted as carrying an <HI>Analo∣gy</HI> or <HI>Proportion</HI> with the <HI>Bishop'</HI>s Demand. Now the Words of the Ques∣tion run in this Connection, "<HI>Will you give your faithful Diligence</HI> ALWAYS <HI>to minister the Doctrine, and Sacraments, and Discipline of</HI> CHRIST, [<HI>as the Lord hath commanded, and as</HI> THIS CHURCH and REALM <HI>hath received the same, according to the Commandments of God</HI>] SO THAT YOU MAY TEACH THE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO YOUR CARE AND CHARGE <HI>with all Dili∣gence to keep and observe the same?</HI> To which the Answer made, is this, <HI>"I will do so by the Help of the Lord."</HI>—Interpreting then the Answer by the Question, it must be allow'd, the direct View of this Engagement is to a <HI>particular Charge;</HI> and the End expre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly aimed at, is, <HI>Teaching the People committed to his Care,</HI> &amp;c. This last Clause (in my Opinion) governs the
<PB N="32" REF="005594_0031_1026A825F6D75E20"/>
Sense of the whole Period: and plainly manifests the just <HI>Extent</HI> of the Promise here made. Hence then, according to the express <HI>Letter</HI> of the <HI>Question and Answer,</HI> if the Promise be understood of <HI>ministring</HI> by the pub∣lickly receiv'd <HI>Forms,</HI> and <HI>Rules</HI> prescrib'd in the <HI>Prayer-Book,</HI> a <HI>Clergy∣man</HI> is not bound by his said Promise, to observe the same in a Variety of Cases that may happen; as, if he at present has not <HI>a People committed to his Care,</HI> or is occasionally ministring <HI>out</HI> of his particular Charge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—However, certainly it does not oblige him to <HI>impose</HI> the Episcopal <HI>Forms</HI> upon another Congregation, scrupling the Use of them, and yet where he may be both invited and inclined to <HI>minister.</HI>—I shall make no other Apo∣logy for this Way of arguing, but that if our <HI>Author</HI> is for taking the Ad∣vantage of a <HI>Literal</HI> Meaning in the Word—ALWAYS, used in the first Clause of the Passage before us, I think, he cannot consistently refuse <HI>me</HI> the Li∣berty of taking an equal Advantage from the Use of the Words—PEOPLE and CHARGE, in the last Clause of the same Passage.</P>
<P>However, Sir, I must confess, I have said all this only by way of <HI>Argu∣mentum ad b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> or in Accommodation to the wrong Notion of this <HI>Promise,</HI> suggested by our <HI>Author,</HI> I suppose, inadvertently. For if you'll please to review the <HI>Bishop's</HI> Question, 'tis obvious, that Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> in his Answer, did not <HI>directly</HI> promise (whether ALWAYS, or otherwise,) in fact to <HI>minister—as this Church and Realm hath received,</HI> &amp;c. but only that he would GIVE HIS FAITHFUL DILIGENCE <HI>always to minister</HI>—as aforesaid.—Neither, did he, in this Place, promise so much as that <HI>u∣niversally</HI> and <HI>indefinitely,</HI> but with an express <HI>Limitation</HI> to THE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO HIS CARE AND CHARGE. A Restriction evidently cou∣ched in his <HI>Promise,</HI> by the strongest Implication. So that when in Provi∣dence he is <HI>excentrical</HI> to his stated <HI>Charge</HI> at any Time, he has a tempora∣ry <HI>Release</HI> from his <HI>Promise,</HI> so far as relates to his <HI>ministring,</HI> or even to his <HI>giving Diligence</HI> to minister, according to the <HI>Church Forms.</HI> Notwith∣standing, for Argument's Sake, I will wave the Advantage of those restrain∣ing Words, and grant that by Parity of Reason his Promise may oblige him beyond the Limits of his own particular <HI>Charge:</HI> Yet it is possible, in some Cases, he may be punctual to his <HI>promise</HI> aforesaid, tho' he actually <HI>minister</HI> in the Congregation <HI>without</HI> using the Episcopal Forms. For is it not a possible Case, that he may GIVE HIS FAITHFUL DILIGENCE <HI>al∣ways to minister,</HI> in the Way and Manner of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and yet it be <HI>out of his Power</HI> sometimes to <HI>minister</HI> thus in Fact? For Instance, when in his occasional Travels he comes into a Place peopled wholly with <HI>Dissenters</HI> from the <HI>Church of England,</HI> who being disaffected to <HI>Book-pray∣ing,</HI> would take Offence at his using the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> but will gladly receive him <HI>without</HI> it, I don't see that his <HI>Promise</HI> binds him in this Case, to forbear ministring <HI>at all,</HI> meerly because the People so prejudic'd won't suffer him to minister in the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Way.—Or, again, supposing there be <HI>Episcopal</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="005594_0032_1026A828A3B6CE98"/>
(as well as Dissenting) Congregations in the Place, to whom, were Ac∣cess allow'd him, he would freely minister in the Use of the <HI>Church Forms,</HI> if in this Case he properly applies for the Liberty of <HI>Episcopal Churches,</HI> and seeks Opportunity to <HI>minister</HI> there, but meets with Repulse, and Disappointment in his Measures, I think, when he has thus GIVEN HIS FAITHFUL DILIGENCE TO MINISTER,—he has truly answer'd the Design of his <HI>Promise,</HI> so far as 'tis rationally supposable it can oblige him in such a Case. Therefore in <HI>New-England,</HI> where the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Pulpits have been refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>im, if <HI>other</HI> Pulpits be open'd to him, and here (to avoid Offence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for other good Reasons) he thinks himself oblig'd to <HI>minister</HI> without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Church-Liturgy,</HI> I can't discern any solid Grounds, upon which the Charge of <HI>breaking his Promise</HI> can possibly in this Case be brought against him.—But in such Case, he has in Providence a fair and clear DISPENSA∣TION from his <HI>Promise</HI> (Consider it in what Light you will) so far as it re∣spects <HI>Liturgical Ministration;</HI> And if he <HI>gives his faithful Diligence always to minster</HI>—AS THE LORD HATH COMMANDED, in some good <HI>Protestant</HI> Form or Manner, agreable to the Word of God, and agreeing (for Substance) with the <HI>Communion-Book</HI> and <HI>Book of Common-Prayer,</HI> he fulfils his Pro∣mise as far as under such Circumstances it can be thought to oblige him in Point of Conscience.—I believe, this is the Light in which the Case is consider'd at <HI>Home.</HI> Else what Account can be given of the publick SLIGHT, there put upon Commissary <HI>Garden'</HI>s Consistorial Process against Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> at <HI>South-Carolina</HI> "for omitting to use the Form of Prayers pre∣scrib'd in the Communion-Book", when officiating in a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Con∣gregation? For Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> having interposed an <HI>Appeal</HI> in the Cause, from Mr. Commissary's spiritual Court to his MAJESTY in the <HI>high Court of Chancery,</HI> tho' when return'd to <HI>England</HI> he attempted <HI>bona fide</HI> to pro∣secute his said Appeal, yet could not prevail with the <HI>Lords</HI> appointed by his Majesty's Commission, so much as to meet once on the Affair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;—they thinking, no Doubt, with sufficient Contempt of Mr. <HI>Garden's</HI> invidious Proceedings not to say usurped Power.—The Conduct of the <HI>Bishops,</HI> and in particular of the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> the reputed <HI>Plantation-Diocesan,</HI> to∣wards Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> in not exerting themselves on this Occasion, either to promote a Hearing upon his <HI>Appeal,</HI> or to censure him in some ecclesiasti∣cal Court according to <HI>Canon,</HI> as a <HI>Revolter after Subscription,</HI> this their Con∣duct (I say) is to me <HI>unaccountable,</HI> unless we resolve the Reason of it into this, that they were conscious of his <HI>Innocence,</HI> as the <HI>Fact</HI> charg'd upon him was done in a <HI>Place</HI> not contained within the Limits originally intended in the <HI>Clergy-Subscription</HI> and <HI>Promise</HI> to use the <HI>Church-Forms, and none other.</HI>—Our <HI>Author,</HI> I suppose, has that Charity for the PRELATES of <HI>England,</HI> to think "'tis with <HI>them,</HI> as well as with himself, no light matter for a Man to <HI>violate his Promise,</HI>" especially in so sacred an Affair: but their <HI>Lordships</HI> not taking
<PB N="34" REF="005594_0033_1026A82B5A5CBBC8"/>
hold of the Occasion given 'em by the <HI>Appeal,</HI> nor of any other Occasion, to deal with Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> according to their Rules of Discipline, but letting him go FREE OF PUBLICK CENSURE, is a loud Intimation, that they despair of being able to prove the Crime upon him, of <HI>violating his Promise,</HI> and that therefore the <HI>Penalties,</HI> denounced in that Case, are not legally <HI>due</HI> to him. And as "certainly as it stands him in stead, to <HI>clear up his Cha∣racter</HI> in this Matter," so certainly I think, this Conduct of <HI>Publick Autho∣rity</HI> at home (whatever Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> or our <HI>Author</HI> may judge of it) is sufficient for that purpose; and I believe, will be tho't, by the reasona∣ble and unprejudic'd part of the World, at least sufficient "to excuse him [in their Eyes] from aggravated <HI>Prevarication,</HI>" which our <HI>Author</HI> says "there are Many who know not how to excuse him from, to say <HI>nothing worse.</HI>"—What <HI>worse,</HI> he might think could be said of Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> I know not: however, this I'm well persuaded of, that notwithstanding all the Noise about his <HI>violating his Promise,</HI> there's <HI>Nothing</HI> in it, but I believe it will be found only groundless Jealousy. And I wish, we may well consider, that <HI>'tis no light Matter for a Man</HI> to accuse another of <HI>violating his Promise,</HI> especially an <HI>Elder,</HI> and in such a Case of <HI>more than ordinary Importance.</HI>—Nor can I devise <HI>how to excuse</HI> People's treating Mr. <HI>W—d's</HI> Character in this strange Manner, unless it be that they do it for want of due Consideration, or Acquaintance with these Things.</P>
<P>Our Author, in his next Paragraph (Page 4, &amp; 5.) deals with Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> about his ITINERATION, which he thinks incongruous to the Cha∣racter of a <HI>professed Minister of the Church of</HI> England, a Breach of his <HI>Or∣dination-Commission</HI> from the Bishop, &amp;c. and therefore <HI>not consistent with Honesty.</HI></P>
<P>I have nothing at all to do here, but to consider this Instance of Mr. <HI>W—d'</HI>s Conduct in point of <HI>Consistency,</HI> which is the View under which our <HI>Author</HI> objects to it. The Scope (I think) of the Argument here against his <HI>Itinerancy</HI> is, that "<HI>the Authority,</HI> which Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> as a Minister of the <HI>Church of England</HI> had given him by the <HI>Bishop,</HI>" was limited in the Exercise of it, to "the <HI>Congregation</HI> where he shall be <HI>lawfully appointed</HI> thereto."—To which I say, if his <HI>Ordination Commis∣sion</HI> did <HI>not</HI> give him <HI>Authority,</HI> as well to minister <HI>out</HI> of his particular Charge, as <HI>in</HI> it, then we may rationally conclude, his <HI>Ordination-Promise</HI> with Relation to the <HI>Exercise</HI> of that Authority, in using the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> respected him also only <HI>within</HI> his appointed Charge: and in this View of the Case, not his <HI>Subscription,</HI> not the <HI>Articles,</HI> or <HI>Orders,</HI> or <HI>Canons</HI> of the Church, but his <HI>Commission</HI> ought to have been objected to him before, at least to shorten the Dispute: Methinks, this Argument singly might have stood <HI>instar ominum.</HI>—Or, if his <HI>Commission</HI> (in its true Mean∣ing)
<PB N="35" REF="005594_0034_10269163FAD130A0"/>
<HI>did</HI> empower him to minister <HI>out</HI> of his particular <HI>Cure</HI> and <HI>Charge,</HI> then I think our <HI>Author's</HI> Argument from this <HI>Commission</HI> carries no Force with it to condemn his <HI>Itineration.</HI> An Argument which proves <HI>too much,</HI> proves <HI>too little.</HI> But if the Words of the <HI>Commission</HI> be taken exactly in the <HI>Letter,</HI> without allowing a Latitude of Sense, this would disempower the Clergy so much as to <HI>exchange Pulpits,</HI> or <HI>assist</HI> one a∣nother occasionally; for <HI>this,</HI> by the foresaid Rule of Interpretation, wou'd <HI>violate</HI> their <HI>Commission,</HI> as well as <HI>Itinerancy.</HI> Here's a <HI>Reductio ad absurdum,</HI> which I believe can't easily be surmounted: But our <HI>Author</HI> must relinquish his Plea from the general <HI>Commission,</HI> and fly to a parti∣cular <HI>Licence.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis Fact, by the Concession of Episcopal Writers, that the <HI>Bishops</HI> (as also the two Universities in <HI>England.</HI>) have the Power to grant <HI>Licences,</HI> of a wider Extent than the narrow District of a single Congre∣gation or Parish, even through the largest City, or through a whole Diocess, and the <HI>Archbishops</HI> through a whole Province, if they please, to any ordain'd Ministers they think fit; "who in Virtue of such Li∣cence, may travel, if they will, from Place to Place, as <HI>Itinerants.</HI>" The sending forth <HI>itinerant</HI> Preachers was a Practice in the <HI>Church of England</HI> at the Beginning of the Reformation; probably in some De∣gree has been kept up all along; or if obsolete for any Time, has re∣markably been reviv'd of late Years, particularly with Relation to <HI>foreign Parts.</HI> Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> is not the only Episcopal <HI>Itinerant</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> It's well known, that <HI>Itinerant</HI> Ministers (under this express Denomination) are avow'd by the <HI>Society</HI> at home <HI>for propagating the Gospel,</HI> who have at this very Time a Number on their Mission. Thus "Mr. <HI>Morris</HI> in the Abstract of their Proceedings, for 1743. is nam'd expresly ITINERANT Missionary in <HI>Connecticut;</HI> Mr. <HI>Punderson,</HI> ITINERANT Missionary in <HI>New-England;</HI> Mr. <HI>Lindsay,</HI> ITINERANT Missionary in <HI>Penn∣sylvania</HI> and <HI>New-Jersey,</HI>" with others.—In the general Notion then, Ministers of this <HI>Character</HI> be judg'd agreeable to the <HI>Constitution of the Church of England,</HI> which our <HI>Author</HI> refers us to. We may well think, it's no <HI>Violation</HI> therefore of this original COMMISSION from the Bishop, to act beyond the Limits of a particular <HI>Cure</HI> or <HI>Charge,</HI> or even in the Character of an <HI>Itinerant.</HI> And with Regard to a special LI∣CENCE, I question whether the <HI>Itinerant Missionaries</HI> above-mentioned have had this, any more than Mr. <HI>W—d.</HI> I suppose they all have the common <HI>Letters of Orders</HI> from the Bishop: and why <HI>ordain'd</HI> Mini∣sters mayn't be thought sufficiently authoriz'd to exercise their Office, without special <HI>Letters of Licence</HI> supervening, I cannot well understand. Nor does it appear to me a Breach of <HI>Canon,</HI> at least no Infraction upon the <HI>Oath</HI> of Canonical Obedience, to act <HI>without</HI> such a Licence. For
<PB N="36" REF="005594_0035_1026A833CDC98E68"/>
the <HI>Oath</HI> is of Obedience to the <HI>Bishop;</HI> not directly to the <HI>Canons.</HI> The <HI>Bishop</HI> must interpose his Injunction, or Imposition, before the <HI>Canon</HI> becomes binding: and even in this Case (as I have already re∣mark'd) the <HI>Clergy</HI> apprehend themselves still in Possession of a <HI>discre∣tionary</HI> Power with Relation to their own Act of Submission and Obe∣dience; the Tenor of the <HI>Oath</HI> being, to obey the Bishop only in <HI>omni∣bus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>citis &amp; honestis.</HI>—I don't see then but that Mr. <HI>W—d,</HI> though acting in Character of an <HI>Itinerant,</HI> may still be acting a <HI>consistent Part as a Minister of the Church of England;</HI> which is all our <HI>Author</HI> calls us to consider.</P>
<P>There's one Thing more suggested in his LETTER (<HI>pag.</HI> 5,) on this Head of <HI>Consistency,</HI> which brings us back again to the <HI>Article</HI> about <HI>using the Book of Common Prayer,</HI> which Mr. <HI>W—d subscrib'd</HI> to, and yet has since in a <HI>Journal</HI> made that Remark, "When the <HI>Spirit of Prayer</HI> began to be lost, then <HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> were invented;" and seems by the Connection of what he says there, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hink "the <HI>Inventi∣on</HI> of them <HI>"a sad Symptom of the Decay of vital Religion,</HI> as much as even <HI>"Preaching by Notes.</HI>—Now, Sir, whether he was of this Senti∣ment when he subscrib'd, or has since chang'd his Mind, I don't see that the <HI>Consequences</HI> our <HI>Author</HI> infers, will in either View of the Case, necessarily follow.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> in fact has <HI>changed</HI> his Mind about <HI>Forms</HI> in Devo∣tion, I think he may nevertheless be <HI>consistent</HI> in <HI>blaming</HI> the Church-Clergy for <HI>violating their Subscription</HI> to the 39 <HI>Articles:</HI> for these were design'd to secure <HI>Unity</HI> or <HI>Consent of Faith;</HI> and the Clergy's <HI>Subscrip∣tion</HI> to these leaves them no Liberty to speak or write contrary to what they've subscrib'd; and hence, if in Points of <HI>Faith</HI> they <HI>"change their Minds"</HI> and teach contrary to their <HI>Subscription,</HI> they are not <HI>"capable of being vindicated in the same Way,"</HI> as Mr. <HI>W—d is;</HI> unless it is not possible for a Man with a safe Conscience so much as occasionally to <HI>use</HI> any Forms of Prayer, while yet he has an unfavourable Opinion of the <HI>Rise</HI> of Forms. For it was only the <HI>Use</HI> of the Forms, that is respected in the Subscripti∣on, according to the Opinion of some of the best Defenders of the Church. According to their Sense of the Matter, Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> did not <HI>"subscribe to the Book of Common Prayer",</HI> properly speaking, i. e. did not (as our <HI>Author</HI> represents it) "subscribe to <HI>all Things con∣tained in it."</HI> If you will read (Sir) the Controversy between Dr.<HI>Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣my</HI> and his Adversaries about Conformity, you'll find they declare, the true Meaning of the <HI>Subscription is,</HI> not to <HI>give unfeigned Assent and Con∣sent</HI> to every Thing in the Common-prayer-book, but only to the <HI>Use</HI> of the Forms therein prescribed: And that this implies in its Nature an Approbation even of the Forms themselves (at the most) in Relation
<PB N="37" REF="005594_0036_1026A83558A17F08"/>
only to the <HI>Use,</HI> not the <HI>Imposition</HI> of them. Mr. <HI>W—d</HI> therefore hav∣ing subscrib'd only to the <HI>Use</HI> of the Liturgy, might without <HI>violating</HI> his Subscription alter his Mind about the <HI>Rise</HI> of Forms, so long as this Change of Sentiment does not affect the <HI>Article</HI> he subscrib'd to, and is not such in its Nature as to be inconsistent with all <HI>Use</HI> of them, while he thinks the <HI>Matter</HI> of the Prayers <HI>agreeable to the Word of God,</HI> and the Case such as makes Submission to the <HI>Use</HI> of them expedient.—Whereas the Clergy's preaching contrary to, and condemning any of the 39 <HI>Articles,</HI> destroys <HI>Consent of Faith,</HI> subverts the very End of their <HI>Subscription,</HI> is a di∣rect Violation of their <HI>Subscription,</HI> and does not well consist with their not renouncing it.</P>
<P>But indeed I see no Necessity of supposing a <HI>Change</HI> of Sentiment in Mr. <HI>W—d.</HI> For notwithstanding an unfavourable Opinion about the <HI>Rise</HI> of Forms of Prayer, yet so long as that Opinion was only such as might consist with the lawful <HI>using</HI> them, in some Circumstances, he might look on himself at <HI>Liberty</HI> notwithstanding, to <HI>subscribe</HI> to the <HI>Use</HI> of the Liturgy WITHIN THE CHURCH AND REALM, and might judge it <HI>expedient</HI> in his Case. For, as he might possibly be acted with a View to some peculiar <HI>Advantages</HI> (as he thought) to serve the Ends of the Ministry, within the Pale of the <HI>Establishment,</HI> Particularly in regard <HI>Episcopal Orders</HI> might "render his Ministry more currant &amp; indisputable and accepta∣ble among the Generality of the People of <HI>England:</HI>" So perhaps he was partly inclined to seek Admission into <HI>publick Ministry,</HI> upon Principle in Relation to <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> which he might be strongly attach'd to, more than to the <HI>Liturgy,</HI> and might at the same Time think his Sentiment about the <HI>Rise</HI> of Forms of Prayer not a sufficient Ground of <HI>Separa∣tion</HI> from the <HI>Church of England.</HI> These and other Considerations, of Weight with him to persuade to his Continuance in the Communion of the <HI>Church,</HI> might more than counter balance his Opinion about the Occasion of <HI>Forms</HI> being <HI>invented:</HI> especially when by his <HI>Subscription</HI> to the <HI>Use</HI> of them in Publick Prayer, he would obtain the valuable Liberty (as he thought) of ministring in the <HI>Publick Churches,</HI> which he could not enjoy without complying with the Terms of the Legal Esta∣blishment; and especially too when his <HI>Subscription</HI> intended nothing more than a Declaration of <HI>Assent</HI> and <HI>Consent</HI> to the <HI>Use</HI> of the impos'd Forms, with an <HI>Approbation</HI> of them only in Relation to their <HI>Matter,</HI> and to their <HI>Use</HI> in this Case of their <HI>imposition.</HI> For thus says the learned Mr. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, in his Defence of Ministerial Conformity. <Q><HI>Forms of Prayer</HI> have both their Commodities, and Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>commodities.—We don't de∣clare for the <HI>imposing</HI> them, nor approve of it, or assent and consent to it.—We are not at all concern'd in the <HI>imposing,</HI> nor are we bound to declare, that <HI>That</HI> was well done, either <HI>in it self,</HI> or <HI>in its Circumstances.</HI>—
<PB N="38" REF="005594_0037_1026A836E4989760"/>
The Act of <HI>Imposition</HI> is the Governours Act: The Act of <HI>Submissi∣on</HI> is ours.</Q>—The <HI>Declaration</HI> respects only what belongs to the Act of the <HI>Subscribers,</HI> who may approve the <HI>Use</HI> of Forms, in various <HI>De∣grees,</HI> and upon various <HI>Grounds;</HI> some meerly judging them <HI>lawful,</HI> and Submission to the <HI>Use</HI> of them <HI>expedient,</HI> in their Case, upon weighing of all Circumstances,—notwithstanding their unfavour∣able Opinion of the original <HI>Occasion</HI> of Forms being introduc'd.—I believe, a great Part of the <HI>godly Reformers</HI> submitted to the <HI>English Liturgy,</HI> upon such Considerations as those: and such Views kept many of the ancient <HI>Puritans</HI> from breaking off from the establish'd Church, they were generally against <HI>Separation,</HI> nor did they separate till they were <HI>persecuted</HI> and <HI>thrust out.</HI> This was very much the Case of our <HI>Forefathers,</HI> the first Planters of <HI>New-England:</HI> they stay'd within the Pale of the establish'd Church as long as they might enjoy the Liberty of their Conscience, in dispensing with some Ceremonies which they scrupled, and until the rigorous Imposition of Ministerial Conformity (in the highest Strain of it) at last <HI>drove them out,</HI> and oblig'd them to seek a Retreat in these <HI>Foreign Parts</HI> of the World.—I shall only add upon it, that when any <HI>Bishop</HI> shall see fit to cite Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> as a De∣linquent, into his spiritual Court at home, I believe, he stands ready to make his Defence: and Persecution may compel him to the <HI>Separati∣on,</HI> which in the present posture of Things mayn't appear to him either a Point of Duty or Expediency.</P>
<P>Alluding now to our <HI>Author'</HI>s Conclusion upon this last Head, I finish with expressing my fervent Wishes for us all, both Ministers and People, that we may have more of the <HI>wisdom which is from above,</HI> and may have <HI>this for our Rejoycing,</HI> even <HI>the Testimony of our Conscience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the Grace of God, we have our Conversation in the World:</HI> then, I believe, however we may differ in Sentiment, in some Cases of lesser Importance, we shall not divide in Af∣fection. Yet if <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> contend too sharply, God can over∣rule even this for the Furtherance of the Gospel.</P>
<P>Bear me (Sir) upon your Heart at the Throne of Grace; and assure yourself,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am Dear Sir, Your's very affectionately. ******</SIGNED></CLOSER>
