<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO see the Diversity of Men's Opinions and the many Censures that some cast upon Truth, brought me to a serious Concern to appear in this manner, that, if possible, I might be in∣strumental to remove the Clouds of Prejudice from some Minds; and by speaking intelligibly to Men of moderate Tempers and common Capa∣citys, as much as in me lieth, to demonstrate what I have clearly seen, to wit, <HI>CHRIST the Hope of Glory, the only means of Man's Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Christ</HI> is the Rock I have built on, who am in Unity with the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> whose Testimony I know to be sound, and yet I have not endeavoured to perswade any to come to them as Men, but to that Foundation they as well as I direct Men to.</P>
<P>I have used as much Brevity as I could, with Clearness, in this little Piece, knowing there are many Books of the same Tendency wrote by Men of larger Gifts; yet as smaller Tracts are some∣times of Service, when bigger Volumes cannot easily be got: And as I have writ with Charity and Plainness, I hope it will be acceptable &amp; ad∣vantageous to my Readers; which with great Sincerity and Affection is the real Desire of (Courteous Reader) Thy Souls Friend.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH many Books have been wrote on this Subject; yet I conceived the writing of this small Tract to be my Duty: And have therefore cast my Mite into the Treasury.</P>
<P>I shall begin with that heavenly Testi∣mony the Evangelist <HI>John</HI> bears of Christ: <HI>In the Beginning was the Word,</HI> (here he plain∣ly declares where the Word was) <HI>and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</HI> Here (he affirms what it is,) he further goes on to confirm the foregoing Words, <HI>The same,</HI> saith he, <HI>was in the Beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made: In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</HI> John i. 1, 2, 3, 4.</P>
<P>It was the Eternal Word which made all things, that upholds all things by his eter∣nal Power, who was with the Father before the World was made: For we find he was in the Beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not a∣ny thing made that was made; in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.
<PB N="4" REF="004327_0004_100454FAB12C3608"/>
Hence it is plain, that CHRIST was and is the WORD of GOD, and the only Means of Man's Salvation. The holy Scriptures are a divine Declaration of him, his Work and Power, whose Work was with the Fa∣ther both to make Man and save him. For although Man by his Disobedience had in∣curred the Wrath of God; yet he was pleased to provide a divine Mediator, who wrought with the Father for the Salvation of Men; and this was Christ the Eternal Word.</P>
<P>This the holy Scriptures abundantly prove; for it was impossible for Man of himself to make an Attonement to God for the Sin he had committed in breaking his Command. Now, God in his great Mercy shewed his Love to Men thro' <HI>Christ, reconciling the World unto himself, not imputing their Trespas∣ses unto them, but,</HI> as saith the Apostle, <HI>hath committed unto us the Word of Reconciliation,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.19. Now, this Word of Reconci∣liation, was Christ, was that Word that was the Mediator for Man, and it is that Word that is the Saviour of Man; 'tis this Word nigh in the Heart, that Man is to hear: <HI>For the invisible things of him from the Crea∣tion of the World are clearly seen, being under∣stood by the things that are made, even his e∣ternal Power and Godhead,</HI> Rom. 1.20. Thus we may see the heavenly Harmony of the
<PB N="5" REF="004327_0005_10045508163443E0"/>
holy Scriptures how they concur; and that Spirit and Power that gave them forth, brings Man to a right Understanding of them.</P>
<P>Now, after Man had fallen by Transgres∣sion, he was received into Mercy by the Means and Mediation of Christ; Life and Death was set before him, with this annexed to it, <HI>Choose Life, that both thou and thy Seed may live,</HI> Deut. 30.19. Man was created after the Image of God in Holiness, but for his Transgression incurred the Wrath of God; then he was made sensible he had sinned; then he was afraid of that Divine Presence he had before injoyed; and in that State it seemed meet to divine Wisdom, to provide a Mediator, which was Christ the Eternal Word of God. Now, we find, that <HI>Adam</HI> after he sell, sought to hide himself from God; and had not God in infinite Mercy called unto him, he had been utterly lost: But willing to bring Man to Repentance he called unto Adam, <HI>Adam where art thou</HI>? Now, <HI>Adam</HI> of himself could not come to a State of Repentance, neither could he fly from the Voice of the Lord, no; <HI>I heard thy Voice and was afraid, because I was naked, there∣fore I hid my self. And he said, Who told thee thou was naked? hast thou eaten of the Tree, whereof I commanded thee, Thou shouldest not eat</HI>? This was great Condescention thus to ex∣postulate
<PB N="6" REF="004327_0006_1004550B32CF4360"/>
the Case with <HI>Adam,</HI> thereby to open his Understanding and bring him to Repentance.</P>
<P>The great Love of God to Mankind is also plainly shewn, in providing a Mediator to make Attonement for their Sins; for altho' Man's Disobedience occasioned his being tur∣ned out of Paradise, a Means of Restauration was provided for him; the Serpent who tempted him was cursed above every Beast of the Field, and the <HI>Seed of the Woman</HI> it was promised should bruise the Serpent's Head. This promised <HI>Seed</HI> was <HI>CHRIST</HI>; and for this End did he make his Appearance unto Mankind through divers Dispensations. His Appearance to the holy Patriarchs, <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> was in the similitude of An∣gels, and he gave to faithful <HI>Abraham</HI> a Sign and Seal of his Mercy, to wit, Circumcision in the Flesh, as a Type and Figure of what was to follow: Then followed the Dispen∣sation of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> added because of Transgression, in order to bring Man near to the Lord; the Ceremonial Part of which stood in outward Observations, and were fi∣gurative of what was to follow, as the Paschal-Lamb, which was to be slain and the Blood to be sprinkled on the People, signified, that it seemed meet to Divine Wisdom, that no Attonement should be made without Blood,
<PB N="7" REF="004327_0007_10045517E5BA7E38"/>
and the Burnt-Offerings made by Fire, typi∣fied the one Offering made by Christ for the Sins of the World. And Christ being come, the Substance of that Law, all Types and Figures in the Law were fulfilled in him; for <HI>Christ is the End of the Law, for Righ∣teousness to every one that believeth,</HI> Rom. 10.4.</P>
<P>Now, true Believers in Christ they see through the Law, that Christ came not to destroy it, but to fulfill it; and as it is ful∣filled, the Service of the Law is at an End: <HI>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful Flesh, and for Sin con∣demned Sin in the Flesh; that the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit,</HI> Rom. 8.3, 4. This is enough, one would think, to satisfy all sorts of Men professing Christiani∣ty, to forsake all outward Shadows, and come to Christ the Substance of all.</P>
<P>For even under the Law, in Performance of the Service required in that Dispensation, the Upright in Heart with an Eye of Faith saw through the End of the Law, to wit, the <HI>Messiah</HI> which was to follow; in this Faith they stood who were faithful in that Day, and it is the same in this: For that Spirit then that rested in the bare Observa∣tion of outward Performances, even that Spi∣rit
<PB N="8" REF="004327_0008_1004551EBB144098"/>
denied him, when the Fulness of Time was come for his blessed Appearance to do his Father's Will in him. They would not receive, but preferred <HI>Barrabas</HI> a Robber be∣fore <HI>Christ</HI> the Saviour of the World; yet they were many of them learned knowing Men as to worldly Wisdom, but the World by Wisdom knows not God. This is the Case of many in this very Age, they will not receive him in his spiritual Appearance, no, no, that's too mean for them, they are too learned to come there: But, hear what Christ saith to the unbelieving Jews? <HI>He that believ∣eth on the Son, hath everlasting Life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see Life but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> Joh.3.36</P>
<P>Now, the Jews who rested in the outward Observation of the Law, not coming to the Substance of the Law, crucified him in the Flesh; and the professing Christians that rest in outward Observations and will not come to him, they crucify him in Spirit. Hear what Christ saith to the unbelieving Jews <HI>Ye sent unto John,</HI> saith he, <HI>and he bore Wit¦ness unto the Truth; but,</HI> saith he, <HI>I have greater Witness than that of John: For the Works which the Father hath given me to fi¦nish, the same Works that I do, bear Witness <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, that the Father hath sent me: And the Father himself which hath sent me, hath bor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="9" REF="004327_0009_1004552C60BFE558"/>
Witness of me: Ye have neither heard his Voice at any time, nor seen his Shape; and ye have not his Word abiding in you: For whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. Ye search the Scriptures,</HI> saith he; <HI>for in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which testify of me: And ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</HI> Further adding, <HI>I am come in my Fa∣ther's Name, and ye receive me not.</HI> Joh. 5. v. 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43. I have made this large Citation to open my Reader's Un∣derstanding: These Texts are so clear and full to the subject Matter I am upon, I think no Man can with Reason be dissatisfied. Here Christ plainly and fully shews his Work▪ and Power, which was to bring Man to him∣self; in short, He that comes not to him, will never be saved by him; no, no: For his Invitation is, <HI>Come unto me all you that are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest.</HI> Now, there is nothing can lead to him but the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from him: For if the Performance of outward Things could have made Men perfect in Christ Jesus, there had been no need of his being crucified for the Sins of the World; but in that they were imperfect in themselves, he came and offered himself as a Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, that, as he was lifted up upon the Cross, he should draw all Men after
<PB N="10" REF="004327_0010_100455389084D220"/>
him. <HI>Wherefore remember,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>that ye being in time past Gentiles in the Flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the Flesh made by Hands; that at that time ye were without Christ, being Aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel, and Strangers from the Covenants of Promise, having no Hope, and without God in the World: But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the Blood of Christ. For he is our Peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the Middle-wall of Par∣tition between us; having abolished in his Flesh the Enmity, even the Law of Commandments, contained in Ordinances, for to make in him∣self, of twain, one new Man, so making Peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one Body by the Cross, having slain the Enmity thereby: And came and preached Peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh: For through him we both have an Ac∣cess by one Spirit unto the Father.</HI> Ephes. 2. v. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</P>
<P>I think these Texts clearly demonstrate the great Work he has done for Man, even from the Beginning down to this very Day: For he it was that made Peace, and he it is that makes Peace between God and Man; He it was that led <HI>Israel</HI> through the Red Sea and through the Wilderness; he it was that
<PB N="11" REF="004327_0011_1004553EF82C5348"/>
stood between <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and his chosen <HI>Israel</HI>; he it was that led them through the Wilder∣ness to prove them and to try them; and fi∣nally he it was that brought them to the good Land, which, was a Figure of the hea∣venly <HI>Canaan,</HI> or Place of Rest. And as the great Work of travelling from <HI>Egypt</HI> to the Land of Promise outwardly was compleated in time through Faith and Patience in them that continued faithful to the End, and as those were saved by that divine Power they trusted in; so undoubtedly shall every one be in this Day, that retain their Integrity to God in the same Faith and Spirit that they did. But we find there were but few of that great Number which came out of <HI>Egypt</HI> entred into the good Land: For tho' they saw the mighty Works which were done for their Preservation, such was the Hardness of their Hearts, they daily provoked God to Wrath, in so much that he threatned to destroy them, and said to his Servant <HI>Moses,</HI> Now therefore, let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot against them; for I will consume them; but I will make of thee a mighty People. But <HI>Moses</HI> prayed unto the Lord his God to turn away his Wrath from his People; and the Lord heard his Prayer and spared them. Thus we see <HI>Moses</HI> under the Law became a Mediator for the <HI>Israelites,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="004327_0012_10045549D6311B48"/>
a lively Type and Figure of <HI>Christ</HI> under the Gospel, who ever lives to make Intercession for the Sins of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> made Intercession for the People under his Conduct; but <HI>Christ</HI> makes Inter∣cession for the whole World, that all Men through him might be saved. And it is certain, that, as he shed his precious Blood for the Sins of the whole World, so all that will come and abide with him, shall be saved by him; as the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> plainly de∣clares, <HI>Look unto me, and be ye saved all the Ends of the Earth; for I am GOD, and there is none other,</HI> [or as some Translations render it, <HI>none else,</HI> which is of the same Effect,] Isai. XLV. 22. Here the Prophet directs Man to look unto him, and not to outward Observations: No, no; for his Message was of another Tendency; these were as Sha∣dows that passed away, they all directed to him, and centred in him. This I lay down for Christian Doctrine, not to be confuted by the wise and learned in worldly Wisdom: For it is not all the learned Men in the World by their Learning in Tongues and Books, can bring Men to the saving Knowledge of Christ; for <HI>Paul</HI> whilst he followed human Learning, and fed upon the Leaves of the Tree of Knowledge, persecuted the Church of Christ which were gathered by the Spi∣rit
<PB N="13" REF="004327_0013_1004554F3A3A8650"/>
of which; but when by that Spirit he was enlightned, not consulting with Flesh and Blood, he soon learned another Lesson; it was then no more Book-Learning, but Sav∣ing Knowledge he exhorted Men to, and that was Christ in them the Hope of Glory; here <HI>Paul</HI> centred, he was at his Journy's End, his Travel was to bring Men to Christ, this was the End of his Message, he was not sent to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, which Gospel is Christ the Power of God unto Salvation; this Gospel teaches Men perfect Faith in Christ, there is no waveing, there is no running from one Place to an∣other, no; Christ is come the Hope of their Salvation, he it is they believe in, he it is they look unto, and by him they are saved. To multiply Words upon this Head is need∣less; for all Men professing Christianity will in Words own Christ Jesus to be their Sa∣viour: This is a general Confession Men make; but they will not come to him in that way he requires that they may be saved by him. He saith, <HI>God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in Spirit and in Truth:</HI> This is the Way he directs Men to; then certainly if it be in Spirit &amp; Truth, Men must worship God; they must have a Measure of that Divine Spirit to wor∣ship withal, which leads from the Teaching
<PB N="14" REF="004327_0014_1004555E1A378470"/>
that is meerly of Men, and out of the World from the Noise of Lo! here and Lo! there.</P>
<P>Oh! how full is the World of Forms and Opinions! One admires one Form, and an∣other another Form: But the Spirit of Truth leads out of empty Forms to Life and Sub∣stance; yea, into all Truth, as those that are led by it do certainly know. It therefore behoves all to beware of a Spirit of Unbe∣lief; for that blessed immaculate Lamb of God, when he was upon the Earth in that prepared Body his Father gave him to do his Will in, and who did the Works that no Man could do; yet such was the Hardheart∣edness and Unbelief of the Jews, they believed not in him, but said, He hath a Devil, why hear ye he him? Others more moderate said, Which of the Rulers hath believed on him? Bring this home to the Age we live in, and it runs too like a Parallel with many: For now, to speak of the Light of Christ within Man for a Teacher, gives great Of∣fence; his divine Revelations to Mankind are disbelieved by many Wise and Learned in worldly Wisdom; many of them say, Revelation is ceased, Men must look to the Word of God and his Ministers to be direc∣ted in the Way in which they are to go: And the holy Bible is what they call the Word of God, &amp; the learned Men in Tongues
<PB N="15" REF="004327_0015_1004556448E05E90"/>
they call the Ministers of Christ; although they never were sent by Christ to preach the Gospel. Now, this is the very Rock the Jews split upon, when Christ came in the Flesh; they had the Law and the Prophets, by which they had a Historical Belief of <HI>Moses,</HI> reading of him in those holy Writings, which directed them to believe in the blessed <HI>Messiah,</HI> who was to come, and of whom <HI>Moses</HI> was a lively Type and Figure: Yet, when the ful∣ness of Time was come, they rejected <HI>Christ,</HI> resting in the formal Part of those figurative Things, which pointed to him the Substance, and through the Hardness of their Hearts they crucified him, and said, <HI>His Blood be on us and our Children.</HI> A dreadful thing indeed! that Man which was created a noble Crea∣ture, and bore the heavenly Image in his State of Innocency, should fall so far below his Station!</P>
<P>Now, what do they do better, that deny him in his spiritual Appearance, and cry, Revelation is ceased, our Ministers tell us so; and sure, they who are learned Men know better than we, therefore let us hear them; often making use of that Text, <HI>The Priest's Lips shall preserve Knowledge.</HI> Under the Law it was so; but under the Gospel-Dispensa∣tion <HI>Christ</HI> is the high <HI>Priest</HI> and Bishop of our Souls, and to him we must adhere.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004327_0016_1004556D5C0CA230"/>Now, from the foregoing Observations I hope it is plain, That Revelation is not cea∣sed: For if that be ceased, by what Spirit must Man learn to know his Duty? God gave Man in the Beginning his good Spirit to be a Leader, and there was no other way whereby he was led to God but that. But Man's rebelling against it incurred his Wrath to the disobedient; this was the Case of <HI>Adam</HI> in the Fall: Yet God through the Son of his Love extended his Mercy to Mankind, that by Repentance and Faith in him they might be saved.</P>
<P>Now, through all Ages of the World the Upright in Heart saw the Day of their Re∣demption, and rejoyed therein. Time would sail to enumerate what might be writ in Defence of the Truth I contend for. Should I trace the holy Scriptures throughout, it would swell to a large Volume; and I see no great Necessity for it: They are plain and clear in themselves, and those who are led by the Spirit of Truth may read them with Comfort; but those that reject that Spirit, they are a Mystery unto, and so will remain till they come to be led by it: For it is the Spirit of Truth that gave forth the Scriptures, which can only unseal them and no other; and without this, neither learned nor unlearned can ever lead them to Edifi∣cation.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004327_0017_1004557AC47E5848"/>Yet to confirm the foregoing, I shall add what the Wise Man says concerning Christ: <HI>The Lord possessed me in the Beginning of his way before his Works of old: I was set up from everlasting, from the Beginning, or ever the Earth was. When there were no Depths, I was brought forth; when there were no Fountains abounding with Water: Before the Mountains were settled, before the Hills was I brought forth; while as yet he had not made the Earth, nor the Fields, nor the highest part of the Dust of the World: When he prepared the Heavens, I was there; when he set a Compass upon the Face of the Deep; when he established the Clouds above; when he strengthned the Fountains of the Deep; when he gave to the Sea his Decree, that the Waters should not pass his Commandment; when he appointed the Foundations of the Earth; then I was by him, as one brought up with him; and I was daily his Delight, rejoycing always be∣fore him; rejoycing in the habitable part of his Earth, and my Delights were with the Sons of Men.</HI> Prov. VIII. 22, to 31. Now, the Com∣pass of his Earth which he took Delight in, was Man, that he had made for a Purpose of his own Glory; he made him of the Dust of the Earth, and breathed into him the Spirit of Life, and Man became a living Soul. This was the habitable Part of his Earth he took Delight to solace in; and a
<PB N="18" REF="004327_0018_1004558268363C38"/>
heavenly Solace it was to Man, whilst he stood in the State he was created in: But falling through Transgression, he lost that heavenly Enjoyment, which is only renew∣ed again in Christ the Lamb of God, who never fell; and is the only Means of Man's Salvation. And seeing then he is the Means, let us come to him for the Effect. And the Way to come to him, is through the divine Influence of the Spirit of Grace, which pro∣ceeds from the Father and the Son, who are one. To confirm this my Assertion, I shall quote divers Texts of Scripture, sufficient to prove it to Men of common Capacities.</P>
<P>I shall begin with Christ's own Words: <HI>Verily, verily I say unto you, He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting Life, and shall not come into Condemnation, but is passed from Death unto Life,</HI> John V. 24. Here the Doctrine I ad∣vance is so plain and intelligibly laid down by the Lip of Truth, that it needs no Com∣ment.</P>
<P>I shall next add the Testimony of some of his Followers: The Evangelist <HI>John</HI> says, <HI>God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting Life: For God sent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him
<PB N="19" REF="004327_0019_1004558D81E513B0"/>
might be saved,</HI> John III. 16, 17. Oh! the Harmony there is betwixt the Lamb of God and his Followers! 'Tis sweetly Refreshing to read those holy Lines, by such as are gathered unto Christ by his Spirit.</P>
<P>My next Instance parallel to the Subject I am upon, to wit, <HI>CHRIST the Eternal WORD the only Means of Man's Salvation,</HI> is that of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who saith, <HI>Moses describeth the Righteousness which is of the Law, That the Man which doth those things, shall live by them. But the Righteousness which is of Faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine Heart, who shall ascend into Heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above) or who shall descend into the Deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the Dead) But what saith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, (that is, the Word of Faith which we preach) That if thou shalt con∣fess with thy Mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine Heart, that God hath raised him from the Dead, thou shalt be saved.</HI> Rom. X. 5, to 9.</P>
<P>Now, this is the Word which the faithful Ministers of Christ preach, and exhort Men to; and this they do by the divine Influence of the Spirit of Grace, revealed unto them: For no Man can truly speak or write of the Things of God but by the Inspiration of the
<PB N="20" REF="004327_0020_100455925CE216B8"/>
Spirit of Truth; for God is inaccessible in his own pure Essence and Being, and cannot be approach'd to by Man, without the Di∣vine Influence of a blessed Mediator, which is Christ the Hope of Glory to all them that believe. Such the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> prea∣ched; but how did he preach? by human Learning only? no; for in that state he persecuted the Church of Christ: But he plainly tells us, how he came to be a Mi∣nister of Christ; hear what he says: <HI>But I certify you, Brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me, is not after Man: For I neither received it of Man, neither was I taught it but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ.</HI> Galat. I. 11, 12. My Reader may, if he pleaseth, read the whole Chapter for further Information, where he treats of this Matter at large, as well as in many other Places in his Writings; of which for Brevity-sake I shall instance but few; every one may read them with Profit, if they will follow the Spirit of Truth; and without that, their reading will do them no good: For if they reject the Fountain from whence good comes, how can they drink of the Streams of it? But to return to <HI>Paul's</HI> Account, how he came to be a Minister of Christ, hear his own Words: <HI>For this Cause I Paul the Pri∣soner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles; if ye
<PB N="21" REF="004327_0021_1004559EDB1BDD78"/>
have heard of the Dispensation of the Grace of God, which is given me to you-ward: How that by Revelation he made known unto me the Mystery, that I wrote afore in few Words</HI>; he yet goes on, <HI>whereby,</HI> saith he, <HI>when ye read ye may understand my Knowledge in the Mystery of Christ,</HI> Ephes. III. 1, 2, 3, 4. Here <HI>Paul</HI> declares how he came to be a Minister of Christ, and tells the Causes to the Gentiles: Now, if Revelation be ceased, as many Scho∣lars and learned Men have affirmed, how shall Men come to the Knowledge of God, since our blessed Lord says, <HI>All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no Man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any Man the Father save the Son, and he to whom∣soever the Son will reveal him</HI>? Matth. XI. 27. Such evident Proof from the holy Writ, one would think were enough to convince all who gainsay it.</P>
<P>Seeing then there is no other way to come to the Knowledge of God, but by Divine Revelation, it is a great Error in Men to deny that which is Essential to Salvation. This Error crept into the World since the Apostles Days, by going from the Spirit of Truth, and setting up Idols in its Place, like the Jews of old, who set up a Calf in the Wilderness, through which they were pas∣sing towards the good Land, and cryed,
<PB N="22" REF="004327_0022_100455D29CA27D78"/>
<HI>These be thy Gods, O Israel, that brought thee out of Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>Now, when Men's Hearts are gone from the Lord, they run into Idolatry, and set up something in their own Will, to please their own Minds; and whilst they continue in this impenitent State, to such Revelation may cease: For the Lord hath said, <HI>My Spi∣rit shall not always strive with Man</HI>; although God in his Mercy to Man (whom he created for a Purpose of his own Glory) gave him a Measure of his good Spirit to lead him, and invites all in the Son of his Love, saying, <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest.</HI> Now, it is certain, there is no greater Burthen than Sin, and no greater need of Rest than to cease from it; which is altogether impossible to be done, if Revelation be ceased: For <HI>no Man knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any Man the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him</HI>: This is confirmed by the Lip of Truth, and the whole World can never reverse it. Now, how the Wise and Learned Men can stem the Current of this Testimony, I cannot see. If they deny Revelation, what Spirit must they learn of, to teach Men to come to Christ? For there is the Center of all Christian Doc∣trine; and if Men deny the Way that leads

<P><PB N="25" REF="004327_0025_1004129C32347678"/>The Way to come to a State of Conver∣sion, is to learn of Christ through the divine Influence of his holy Spirit; none ever was converted to Christ but by it, nor ever will without it. And if People would come to sit down under their own Vine and under their own Figg-Tree, they would not want an outward Priesthood to teach them. The Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> tells us, <HI>It shall be in the last Days, that the Mountain of the House of the Lord shall be established on the Top of the Mountains, and shall be exalted above the Hills, and all Nations shall flow unto it,</HI> Isai. II. 2. The Prophet speaks in general Terms, <HI>All Nations</HI>; then surely all Nations must have a Measure of the Spirit of Grace, to lead them to this Mountain; and who shall dispense this Spi∣rit, but the Fountain from whence it flods? Great and Learned Men by their Skill in Tongues cannot do it, no; they (many of them) direct Men to their learned Ministers, Men who are skilled in Tongues and Books; but the Grace of God directs Men to Christ, who is the Giver of Divine Knowledge; for there is a saving Knowledge, and a Historical Knowledge, a Knowledge which saves the Soul, and a Knowledge which puffs up the Mind; and that Mind that is led by a wrong Spirit, is too apt to think it self safe, and guards it self with Natural Reason; but
<PB N="26" REF="004327_0026_100455ECA9F14248"/>
saving Knowledge looks to its Center, from whence it came. Now, learned Men from Human Learning can never bring Men to saving Knowledge; no: We find <HI>Paul</HI> was a learned Man, and zealous in the way he was learned in; and in that learned Zeal persecuted the Church of Christ: But when the Light shone round about him, as he journied to <HI>Damascus,</HI> the Vision brought him to saving Knowledge; it was then no more outward Learning which he depended on, but <HI>Christ the Power of God unto Salvation.</HI> Oh! then he became a true Minister of Christ, and then he saw the Effect of the Ministry of Christ; he then saw, it was not limited to Time, nor Place, nor School-Learning, nor to preach for Hire by the Year, no; it was a free Ministry, freely received, and freely dispensed to Mankind.</P>
<P>But some will say, By this Man's writing we must have no Ministers to teach us, nor have any Meetings of Worship to go to, but every Man is left to the Light of Nature to do as he pleases? This is the Way that some will argue; but there's nothing further from my Thoughts. For the Tendency of my Labour is, <HI>To bring Man to the Knowledge of God through Jesus Christ</HI>; for <HI>that is Life e∣ternal.</HI> I am not against Meetings of Wor∣ship, to worship the true God in Spirit and
<PB N="27" REF="004327_0027_100455AD3997A700"/>
in Truth, nor am I against Ministers, to preach or teach the People; but I would have them be taught by the Spirit of Christ so to do. Were this observed, we should all be in Unity one with another; and 'tis the Want of this keeps us so wide apart, the more is the Pity. But the Satisfaction which would result from such an Union, we are not yet come to, although much desired by the honest-hearted. In all gatherings, where an uncharitable Opinion is let in, in any So∣ciety, they lose Ground from the Christian Principle; for as Truth leads Men to Christ, so Contest and Debate in a wrong Spirit scatters from him. Men may toyl all Night about their Forms, and catch nothing till Daylight come, that they see Christ. Oh! he that told his Disciples to cast the Net on the right Side, must direct Men still, or they may toyl all Night in vain: Forms and Shadows are but Night-work without the Life and Power. The one stands in Man's Will, the other in the Power of an endless Life. They that rest in Forms, are like a troubled Sea; but those who are in Christ, they are in Peace. Now, Christ has dispen∣sed his Grace to all Mankind, that thereby all the Ends of the Earth may look unto him, and be saved; this is the Effect of his great Love; it is expressed in general Terms
<PB N="28" REF="004327_0028_100455F74F07EE50"/>
to all; none are exempted from him that will come to him. And blessed be the Lord, he has raised up a Ministry and People to bear a Testimony to his Name, which the World can neither refute nor confound, who have been like Trumpets to the Nations, by whom many have been awakened out of that drowsy Ease they were in, been con∣vinced and converted. And if Men would come to hear Truth, and not sit down at Ease with slumbering Eyes, half awake and half asleep, there would not be such Blind∣ness amongst Men as there is, nor such Con∣test as there is, running after Lo! here, and Lo! there. These being abroad, lose the Blessing, for want of being at home: But my Counsel is to such, Retire and repair home, before your Sands of Time be run, before the Midnight-cry be come upon you. Oh! remember, at that Time there is none can enter in, but those who have Oyl in their Lamps: It was so in the Parable, and so it will undoubtedly be. Oh! then where will all your empty Forms be? For want of Oyl your Lamps will go out; 'twill be too late then to buy or borrow, and the Wise will not have to spare. Be perswaded then to take hold of Mercy in the Day of Mercy, and here improve your Time whilst 'tis to Day; close with the Offers of his Love,
<PB N="29" REF="004327_0029_100455FDB8958CC8"/>
whilst Mercy is extended to you, before the Sun be set upon you, and the Curtains of the Night be drawn. Oh! remember, in the Grave there is no Repentance; 'tis here in Time ye must return, or else ye are lost for ever. Oh! trifle not with Eternity, nor slight the Day of your Visitation: Despise not the Reproofs of Instruction, but hear them, lest Darkness overtake you. Remem∣ber what a woful State that is; for he that walketh in Darkness knoweth not whither he goes. Oh! then prize the blessed Light and walk in it; it will lead you in the Way to Peace: Despise it not to your own De∣struction; for that will comprehend your Darkness, and your wonted scoffs against it, will vanish away. Oh! remember these Things, whilst here you have Time to re∣member them in.</P>
<P>Oh! what was it that strengthned <HI>Daniel,</HI> and gave him Power to stand so valiantly for his God, but the Influence of that divine Spirit I have been speaking of? He feared not the evil Counsellors, nor the King's Rage; he matter'd not their Images, nor all their threatning Tortures; he would not bow down to any but the true God, no, neither the I∣mage nor the Beast could deceive him; he saw the little Stone cut out of the Moun∣tain without Hands, which broke the Image
<PB N="30" REF="004327_0030_100454D5812C4EE8"/>
and all his Compounds. And that Stone which <HI>Daniel</HI> saw, is able to break all the Images in our Days; and those that are led by the Spirit of Truth, see the Image when it is set up, and by that Spirit they fear it not, nor bow down to it; but those that are not led by that Spirit that <HI>Daniel</HI> was, will sooner bow than go to the Lion's Den: But I would have all to trust in that God that <HI>Daniel</HI> did, and they shall be preserved as he was.</P>
<P>Divers Instances might be brought out of the Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> to corroborate this Doc∣trine, and to shew how zealous and faithful they were to their Testimony in their Days; Fire and Faggot were trying Things surely, and they must have had something more than Human Learnings or Notional Forms to support them, or they could not have stood the Tryal of that Day; they were led by that Spirit that <HI>Daniel</HI> was, no doubt, and that supported them as it did him, and enabled them to refuse the worship of Images in their Day, and to offer their Bodies living Sacrifices to God. Now, bring this home to this Age we live in, and see how remiss too too many are in their Duty to God, that have known a Day of good Things: Oh! how does Pride abound in this Land in too too many! Well, let such know that Dust and Worms will be their Portion, and their
<PB N="31" REF="004327_0031_100455AEE69F8AF0"/>
haughty Spirit will some Time be brought low.</P>
<P>But to return the holy <HI>Martyrs,</HI> History informs us, That <HI>Richard Woodman,</HI> a valiant Martyr, his first Examination before one of the dark <HI>Romish</HI> Bishops in those Days, was as followeth:</P>

<P>I am sorry for you, you have been a Man of good Report and Esteem in your Country till now of late; therefore look to your self, your Wife, and Children, and Friends, and be ruled; and think not your self wiser than all the Realm, but be informed; and you shall have their Favour as much as ever you had.</P>

<P>My Life, my Wife and my Children, I love them, but they are in God's Hands, and I have them as if I had them not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Sheriff told me you were desirous to speak with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought meet to appeal to you; because you have taken upon you to be the Physician of our Country: For many unjust Things are laid to my Charge, and they seek my Blood; and I have appealed unto you, that if my Blood be shed unrigh∣teously, it might be required at your Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Dr. Story.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not this a perverse Fellow? Dost thou think thou shalt be put to Death unjustly, and that thy Blood shall be requi∣red? No, said he; and further added, That he could condemn an Hundred such Here∣ticks, and threatned he would help to rid them.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Woodman</HI> would have answer'd, but the <HI>Bishop</HI> desired them both to give him Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Neighbour <HI>Woodman,</HI> I call you Neighbour, because you are of my Dio∣cess, and you are sent to me, that I should give you spiritual Counsel; for I am your spiritual Pastor: Hear what I say unto you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodman.</SPEAKER>
<P>First I desire you to hear me a few Words. You have said, you will give me spiritual Counsel; are you sure you have the Spirit of God? [here the Martyr tried him, and shook his Copyhold Religion]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am not sure, I dare not be so bold to say so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are like the Waves of the Sea, tossed about with every Wind, and unstable in all your Ways, and can look for no good thing at the Lord's Hand. [How firm the Martyr takes the Spirit of Truth for his Guide] He further goes on, Yea, saith he, you are neither hot nor cold, and therefore God will spue you out of his Mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="004327_0033_10045610ACE09A08"/>Then in a Fury <HI>Story</HI> said, What a per∣verse Fellow is this? He hath a Devil in him, and is mad. And the <HI>Bishop</HI> said, He was sent to me to learn, and he taketh upon him to teach me.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Richard Woodman</HI> seeing their Blind∣ness and Blasphemy, it made such an Im∣pression upon him, that his Heart was most melted, and his Eyes gusht out with Tears, and he spoke to them after this Manner: The <HI>Jews</HI> said to <HI>Christ,</HI> He had a Devil, and was mad, as you have here said to me; but I know, the Servant is not above his Master: And God forbid I should learn of him that confesseth he hath not the Spirit of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you think you have the Spirit of God? You boast more than ever <HI>Paul</HI> did, or any of the Apostles, the which is great Presumption.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I boast not in my self, but in the Gift of God, as <HI>Paul</HI> did, who said, <HI>He verily believed that he had the Spirit of God,</HI> making no Question thereof, 1 Cor. VII.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chichester.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not so, you belye the Text.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodman.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be not so, let me be burnt to Morrow.</P>
<P>Here we may see, how valiant the Martyr was for the Truth, which he had learned through the Grace of God in Christ Jesus,
<PB N="34" REF="004327_0034_100412C1AB0D5108"/>
which Grace led him into all Truth; and that Grace and Spirit supported him tri∣umphingly through all those fiery Trials. But hear yet further this holy Man, what a Godly Zeal he had for God in his Day: <HI>No Man,</HI> saith he, <HI>can believe that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghost: For he that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his.</HI> And again, <HI>We have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba Father; the same Spirit certifieth us that we are the Sons of God.</HI> Also <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>He that believeth not, that Christ is come in the Flesh, is an Antichrist, and de∣nyeth both the Father and the Son:</HI> Further adding, <HI>And he that believeth in God, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Julius Palmer</HI> at <HI>Newberry,</HI> before Doctor <HI>Jeffries,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Sarum,</HI> and others, gives this Account of his Faith and Hope in the Lord, being enabled by the Spirit of Truth so to do. After many needless Questions put to him, he answered very boldy in the Lord:</P>
<P>I know, that of my self I am able to do nothing; yet if you and all mine Enemies should do your worst, you shall not be able to bring that to pass, [meaning to bring him to their Superstition] neither shall you pre∣vail against God's mighty Spirit, by which we understand the Truth, and speak it so boldly.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! are you full of the Spirit? Are you inspired with the Holy Ghost?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul. Palmer.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Man can believe but by the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost; there∣fore, if I were not a spiritual Man and in∣spired with God's Holy Spirit, I were not a true Christian; he that hath not the Spi∣rit of Christ, is none of his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive you lack no Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Palmer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Christ hath promised not only to give us Store of Words necessary, but with them such Force of Matter, as the Gates of Hell shall not be able to confound or pre∣vail against it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Christ made such a Promise to his Apostles; you will not compare with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Palmer.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the Apostles I may not compare; but this I am certain pertaineth to all such as are appointed to defend God's Truth against his Enemies, in the time of their Persecution for the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it pertaineth not unto thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Palmer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am right well assured that it pertaineth unto me; as it shall appear, if you will give me Leave to dispute with you before this Audience, in the Defence of all that I have there written.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art but a beardless Boy, start up Yesterday out of the Schools; and darest

thou presume to offer Disputation, or to encounter with a Doctor?</P>

<SPEAKER>Palmer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember Mr. Doctor, <HI>The Spirit breatheth where it pleases,</HI> &amp;c. And, <HI>Out of the Mouth of Babes</HI> &amp;c. And, <HI>Thou hast hid these Things from the Wise,</HI> &amp;c. God is not tied to Time, Wit, Learning, Place, nor Person. Thus far that worthy Martyr <HI>Palmer.</HI> And had the Envy of that Age thought on it, might have branded him for a <HI>Quaker,</HI> with many more of those who were faithful in their Day; divers of whom, according to the Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> preached against <HI>Tythes</HI> and <HI>Swearing upon a Book,</HI> and that some worthy <HI>Women preached,</HI> who were joyned to Christ's little Flock.</P>
<P><HI>Agnes Ashford,</HI> being one of the said People, for preaching these Words following, was articled against, viz. <HI>We be the Salt of the Earth; if it be putrified and vanished away, it is nothing worth: A City upon a Hill may not be hid: Ye light not a Candle and put it under a Bushel, but set it on a Candlestick, that it may give a Light to all in the House: So shine your Light before Men, that they may see your Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI> And further she did teach, saying, <HI>Jesus seeing his People, as he went up a Hill, was set, and his Disciples came to him, he o∣pened his Mouth and taught them, saying, Blessed

be the poor Men in Spirit; for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs: Blessed be the mild Men; for they shall rule the Earth.</HI> For teaching this Doctrine, the Bishop strictly enjoyned and commanded her to teach no more Lessons to any Men, especially to her Children.</P>
<P>Many more might be instanced out of the Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> which I omit for Brevi∣ty's sake, which shewed their Christian Zeal, and what Spirit they were led by, how the the Doctrine they taught agrees with the Doctrine of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> in this Day. For let Men draw up what Forms they will, and make what Shew of Worship they will; till they come to know Christ to be their Teacher through the divine Influ∣ence of the Holy Spirit of Grace which pro∣ceeds from the Father and the Son, they worship but an Image, a Shadow in stead of a Substance.</P>
</SP>
<P>So this I do affirm and lay down for Chri∣stian Doctrine, <HI>CHRIST JESUS which was with the Father before the World was, by whom all Things were made, this is the WORD we must hear, this is the Teacher we must learn of.</HI> 'Tis not the Forms Men can make will bring the Soul true Peace, no, 'tis nothing but that WORD that gave it a Being can give it Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="004327_0038_1004562F313B3DB0"/>Now, if Men would come to be led by the Spirit of Truth, they would soon leave off Contention, and be of the <HI>Woman of Sa∣maria's</HI> Mind, <HI>Come see a Man that told me all that ever I did:</HI> Is not this the <HI>Christ</HI>? Here she was touch'd with a lively Sense by the divine Influence of the Holy Spirit; and her Fellow-Citizens when they heard the same Christ, they came to be of the same Mind she was of; their Eyes were then no more to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> no more to the Mount; no, a Saviour was come, and him they believed in. Oh! then the Angel of his Presence was come; Oh! then the Fountain was open; <HI>Drink, and thirst no more:</HI> Oh! blessed En∣joyment, O! heavenly Solace! what would Man have more? O! that Men would prize the Mercy offered to them in this the Day of his Love, and come to drink of this Foun∣tain that springs up to Eternal Life; and not break their own Peace by chusing Dark∣ness rather than Light, which leads to the Chambers of Death.</P>
<P>So <HI>Friendly Reader,</HI> thou hast a Soul to save, or to lose, and Life and Death is set before thee; a Saviour is nigh unto all, that all may be saved by him; there's none ex∣empted that will come to him: And in Or∣der that thou mayst come to him, he has given thee a Measure of his good Spirit to

lead thee: This it is thy Duty to hear, to follow, and to obey: It proceeded from him, and it will lead to him. Time would fail to say all that might be said or writ on this Subject, to wit, <HI>CHRIST the Teacher of his People.</HI> And there are many Volumes ex∣tant wrote by worthy Men, who are gone to their Rest, and whose Works follow them, whose Memory is dear to Posterity. There∣fore I shall draw to a Conclusion, greatly desiring all the Inhabitants of this Land may prize the Day of Mercy while it is cal∣led <HI>To Day.</HI> You have enjoyed great Bles∣sings beyond many Nations: You have had the Angel of his Presence to surround you, when many have been involved in Blood: Have a Care you don't incur his Wrath upon you by your Disobedience; for he is a God of Justice as well as of Mercy. My honest Caution can do no Harm, if it finds no Room in the Crowd of worldly Minds.</P>
<P>So to CHRIST the WORD nigh in the Heart I recommend my <HI>Reader</HI>; there's no other Way will bring the Soul to Peace: And shall conclude this little Piece with the <HI>Supplication</HI> following:</P>
<P><HI>AND now, O LORD, if it stands good with thy Divine Will, cause thou the Light of thy Countenance to shine upon the Children of
<PB N="40" REF="004327_0040_100455CF4C264A60"/>
Men, whom thou hast created for a Purpose of thy Glory: Let the Sun of thy Love arise and shine more and more upon them, that they may see the Day of their Redemption, and thereby livingly come to praise thee. And those that are in Darkness and Hardness of Heart, O LORD enlighten their Understandings, and tender their hard Hearts, in Order to their Salvation. Keep those that are in thy Way to the End of their Pilgrimage: And those who are wandring from thy Pold, do thou be pleased to bring Home, that they may come to worship thee the true GOD in thy own Way. Grant this, O LORD, to the Children of Men, in and through thy dearly beloved Son, our blessed LORD and dear Redeemer JESUS CHRIST. To whom with thee be all Glory and Honour ascribed now and for evermore.</HI> Amen.</P>
