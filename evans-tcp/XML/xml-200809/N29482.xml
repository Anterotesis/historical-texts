<HEAD><HI>Boston</HI> 3<HI>d</HI> December 1689. AT THE CONVENTION Of the <HI>Governour,</HI> and Council, and <HI>Representatives</HI> of the Colony of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bay.</HEAD>
<P>IT having pleased the God of Heaven to mitigate His many Frowns upon us in the Summer past, with a mixture of some very signal Favours, and in the <HI>midst of Wrath</HI> so far <HI>to remember Mercy; That</HI> our Indian Enemies have had a Check put upon their Designs of Blood and Spoil: that others have not seen their Desires accomplished upon us: And <HI>that</HI> we have such hopes of our God's adding yet more perfection to our Deliverances; Inasmuch also, as the great God hath of late raised up such a Defence to the <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> and <HI>Interest</HI> abroad in the World, especially in the happy accession of Their Majesties our Sovereigns, KING <HI>William</HI> and QƲEEN <HI>Mary</HI> to the Throne:</P>
<P><HI>It is therefore Ordered, that</HI> Thursday <HI>the nineteenth of</HI> De∣cember <HI>instant, be kept as a Day of <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> throughout this Colony; And all Servile Labour on said Day is hereby inhibited. And the several</HI> Ministers <HI>and</HI> Assemblies <HI>are Exhorted to Observe the same by Celebrating the just Praises of Almighty God,</HI> of whose tender Mercies it is that we are not consumed.</P>
