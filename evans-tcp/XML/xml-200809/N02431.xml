<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE REASONS OF THE Conduct of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Face of Affairs in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> is, within the space of the last Year, so much altered, that it is al∣most impossible for the most uncon∣cerned Spectator to prevent his Thoughts from running out into Questions and Suppositions about it. Curiosity it self, the lowest Principle of all our Enquiries, will force its Way into such a Scene: And will expect, or invent, some Account of so surprizing a <HI>Change;</HI> from a Calm hardly paralleled by any past <HI>Prosperity,</HI> to a sud∣den Gathering of Clouds; which, if not soon dissipated, must burst, and discharge themselves some where or other.</P>
<P>But when Self-Interest is joined to this na∣tural Curiosity, and it becomes a <HI>personal</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="002880_0003_0FE685B2651B86E8"/><HI>National</HI> Concern, to know the main Causes and Springs of such Events, as All are interested in; there seems then to be a Right, strictly so cal∣led, to demand and receive all the Satisfaction the Nature of such Affairs can permit to be gi∣ven. In a free Nation especially, where no Re∣solutions can be effectual without the Consent and support of the Community, every Man, who can think at all, will think it an injurious Treat∣ment, if, at a proper Time, and in a proper Manner, some Light be not held forth to him; and some satisfactory Solution given of such Appearances, as must otherwise very much perplex and disturb him. And one Thing <HI>Go∣vernours</HI> themselves are sure to find, That un∣less they shew such a Regard to Those who just∣ly think they have a Claim to it, this Evil will come to pass, that Mankind (always disposed enough towards Dissatisfaction, either through a sort of natural Ill-will to Those above them, or through a Weariness under the Continuance of the same <HI>Administration,</HI> or through an af∣fected <HI>Popularity,</HI> or real <HI>Patriotism</HI> not suffi∣ciently instructed) will take that Side of the Prospect to dwell upon, which will af<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d them most Matter for Satyr at Home; and lay all the Load upon the Conduct of Those, in whose Time of Power such a <HI>Crisis</HI> of Political Affairs appears in the World.</P>
<P>All this was never more true, than in this Nation, and at this Time. Every <HI>Briton</HI> who, either by his Treasure or his Blood, by his Vote or his Interest, by his Person or his Re∣presentative, has in Time past bor'n any part
<PB N="5" REF="002880_0004_0FE6858466EC2068"/>in procuring the common Peace, and establishing the several Interests of <HI>Europe:</HI> Every such Member of the <HI>British</HI> Nation, who, by this Time flatter'd himself with Hopes of enjoying the Result of all our Toil, and Taxes, and Blood, in an Universal Peace, and an extended undisturbed Commerce, has a Right to ask,— How comes this Face of Things to be again over∣clouded?—All <HI>Europe</HI> once more in Agitation— Three Fleets from <HI>Britain</HI> fitted out at a Great Expence, and with the utmost Expedition sent to several parts of the World:—And, what is most unaccountable, the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Powers that could hardly be kept within the Bounds of common Decency, towards one ano∣ther, by all the Address of two powerful Medi∣ators in a publick Treaty, abandoning that Mediation; and, in the middle of it, privately running into one another's Arms, and uniting, in Designs destructive to the <HI>Commerce</HI> and <HI>Rights</HI> of other Nations, with all the Marks of Cordial Affection, and a Resolute Friend∣ship.</P>
<P>Is not This, the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>—of that Coun∣try, which has always felt the Want of the Friendship of <HI>Britain,</HI> more than of That of all other Nations besides; to such a Degree, that it has passed into a <HI>Proverb</HI> throughout the King∣dom, <HI>Paz con</HI> Inglatérra, <HI>con todos otros la Guerra: Peace with</HI> England, <HI>and War with all the World besides?</HI> — of that <HI>Country,</HI> which reaps more Advantage from the Trade with <HI>England,</HI> than from that of all its other Neighbours put together?—And, Is not this
<PB N="6" REF="002880_0005_0FE68625EBD0E370"/>the same King, whose Engagements to the <HI>Inte∣rests</HI> and <HI>Possessions</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> in <HI>his</HI> Country, are as solemn and strong, as the most express Trea∣ties can make them?—The same, who just before the Opening the Congress at <HI>Cambray,</HI> owned and ratified them all, by acceding in Form to the <HI>Quadruple Alliance;</HI> and accepting, by That, the Mediation of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>And above all, if we turn our Eyes to the <HI>Emperor;</HI> Is not This the <HI>Prince,</HI> whom we once bore upon <HI>our</HI> Shoulders, out of the Reach of all his Enemies, and supported by <HI>our</HI> Strength, in the Time of his own greatest Weakness?— The <HI>Prince,</HI> whom <HI>our</HI> Zeal, and <HI>our</HI> Fleets, and <HI>our</HI> Treasure, laboured to six upon the Throne of <HI>Spain,</HI> at a Time when Difficulties and Dangers surrounded the whole Imperial House at <HI>Vienna?</HI>—And now, Vested, as we always wished Him to be, with the High and August Dignity He enjoys; Is not this the <HI>Emperor,</HI> who may justly be said to owe the Pre∣servation even of all his Hereditary Countries, and of his Imperial Crown it self, (if we may have liberty to say so,) to that hazardous and unequalled March of the Confederate Army in∣to <HI>Germany,</HI> and to the happy Consequences of it? To that <HI>Victory,</HI> in which the <HI>British, Dutch, Hanoverian, Prussian,</HI> and <HI>Hessian</HI> Troops bore so great a part; and, in a particular Manner, to that <HI>British</HI> General, who projected and condu∣cted the <HI>Whole?</HI>— And the same <HI>Emperor,</HI> who, as He was throughout the last War, the chief Object of the Love and good Wishes of this Nation, so, at the End of it, was established
<PB N="7" REF="002880_0006_0FE685A51C6C0040"/>in the Possession of <HI>Flanders;</HI> and owes <HI>Ostend</HI> it self to those victorious Arms, which had be∣fore supported his Person, and preserved the <HI>Em∣pire</HI> for him? And all this long Scene of Ser∣vice and Toil, entred into and prosecuted by us, We must own, against the repeatad Remon∣strances of <HI>many,</HI> that We were hastening apace to make Him a Power too great and too for∣midable; and that we should find in <HI>Him</HI> at last, the Enemy we then dreaded only in <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>It is natural for every <HI>Briton</HI> to look back, and to ask these and the like Questions. And the next Thought which succeeds, is almost as natural; That it is hardly to be supposed, that these Powers should take such Steps, without something to justify them. We can hardly im∣agine it possible, That, without some real and high Provocation, the <HI>Emperor</HI> could throw any the least Indignity upon the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great Bri∣tain;</HI> or act any injurious or even hard Part towards a Nation who had sacrificed so much Treasure and so much Blood to his Service. And therefore we are apt enough to conclude, (and have Reason to do so, till we find it otherwise) That some great Mismanagement on the Part of <HI>Britain;</HI> some unjustifiable Partiality towards Others; some Breach of Faith; some Outrage or other in Politicks, has been committed against his <HI>Imperial Majesty:</HI> Or, that some unpardona∣ble Behaviour on our Part, with Regard to his just Interests, must have been the Occasion of a Con∣duct that so far exceeds the Common Maxims
<PB N="8" REF="002880_0007_0FE6460F8C00FB98"/>of Princes and States towards one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>And indeed, I shall be very free to own, If this be the Case; if either solemn <HI>Treaties,</HI> or any Engagements, with the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> have been broke through; if either Affronts, or even Neg∣lects, inconsistent with the Duty of a faithful Ally, have been Part of the Conduct of the <HI>pre∣sent</HI> Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> towards his <HI>Imperial Majesty;</HI> former Appearances ought not be spoken of; all past Obligations ought to be as nothing in the present Account: The <HI>Emperor</HI> has a Right to guard and strengthen himself by Treaties <HI>contrary</HI> to his former Treaties, and to act the Part He judges best for his own Honour and Security: And we of this Nation have no Right to tax <HI>Him,</HI> either with Ingratitude un∣provoked, or with Breach of Faith without the Appearance of a Justification; but ought to turn all our Zeal against Those, whose Counsels, and whose Behaviour, upon this Supposition, have made such a Conduct on his part, wise, just and necessary. And the same must be acknowledged with Regard to <HI>Spain</HI> also; if any such <HI>Excuse</HI> can justly be alledged on that Side.</P>
<P>We will now, therefore, enquire What has been the Behaviour of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Nation</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> since his present <HI>Majesty</HI> came to the Throne, towards the <HI>Emperor</HI> particular∣ly: And, as we pass, towards <HI>Spain</HI> also. And I will put the Account of this into <HI>two Periods.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> shall be, from his Majesty's Accession to the Crown, to the Opening the <HI>Congress</HI> at <HI>Cambray:</HI> The <HI>Second,</HI> from the Opening of
<PB N="9" REF="002880_0008_0FE6857DC2EDA240"/>that <HI>Congress</HI> to the Signing of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> at <HI>Vienna</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>At the Time when his <HI>Majesty</HI> came to the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> several Points of great Importance remain'd to be adjusted, before the <HI>Peace</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI> could be esteem'd as a Thing fix'd upon any lasting and solid Founda∣tion; in particular, some Things very uneasy to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and others very much desired by <HI>Spain.</HI> In consideration of this, his Majesty, after other previous Treaties and Conventions, enter'd directly upon these necessary Points, which were fix'd in the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>London, July</HI> 22. 1718. entirely to the Enperor's Satisfaction: who was himself a <HI>Party</HI> in that Treaty, and confirm'd with his own Hand what his <HI>Minis∣ters</HI> had before sign'd in his Name. His <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> Dominions, always dear to him, He justly thought not very secure, without the Possession of <HI>Sicily;</HI> upon which the Preservation of <HI>Na∣ples</HI> very much depends. This great and im∣portant Point, the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> fix'd, as a main Article of this <HI>Treaty:</HI> and engaged, in Concert with <HI>France,</HI> that, <HI>Sardinia</HI> being deliver'd up to the <HI>Emperor</HI> by <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Sicily</HI> should accept of that Island in lieu of <HI>Sicily,</HI> which He should yield to the <HI>Emperor.</HI></P>
<P>On the Part of <HI>Spain,</HI> a Favourite Point was likewise settled. Don <HI>Carlos,</HI> Son to the pre∣sent <HI>Queen,</HI> was establish'd in the Succession of <HI>Tuscany, Parma,</HI> and <HI>Placentia:</HI> And This con∣sented to, by the <HI>Emperor,</HI> who alone was ca∣pable of disturbing it; and effectually guaran∣teed by the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> I
<PB N="10" REF="002880_0009_0FE685CAF1781FA0"/>will at present name no other Particulars, but these <HI>two</HI> principal ones. Some other Points, Circumstances, and Incidents, in order to perfect the Peace between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> re∣main'd to be settled in a Congress, under the Mediation of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> And this <HI>Mediation</HI> made a Part and an express Article of this <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> to which the <HI>Empe∣ror</HI> long ago, and <HI>Spain</HI> afterwards, set their Hands, and gave their solemn Consent. The former of the two Articles now mentioned, <HI>viz. That</HI> relating to <HI>Sicily,</HI> did not long subsist in Words only; but was soon actually put in Exe∣cution; and the <HI>Emperor</HI> put in Possession of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>Hitherto, Nothing but <HI>Friendship</HI> appears: And perhaps Friendship to Excess. What the <HI>Emperor</HI> exceedingly desired, is granted to Him: And nothing granted to <HI>Others,</HI> but what the <HI>Emperor</HI> himself had previously con∣sented to, as a reasonable and fitting <HI>Equi∣valent.</HI> Neither had the King of <HI>Spain</HI> any Reason to complain, when the Succession of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> was put in so sure a Way of taking place at the Time appointed. So far indeed, was <HI>He</HI> from it; That, before the Open∣ing of the <HI>Congress,</HI> He himself acceded to the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and consented to all the Allotments made in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Congress</HI> was at length open'd at <HI>Cambray, Jan.</HI> 26. N. S. 1723-4. in order to settle all re∣maining Uncertainties, under the Care of the two mediating Powers, <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> This will be a <HI>Second Period;</HI> from this Opening at
<PB N="11" REF="002880_0010_0FE685DF76C34598"/><HI>Cambray,</HI> to the opening of another Scene at <HI>Vienna.</HI> And through the whole Management of this <HI>Congress,</HI> the Part the <HI>Mediators</HI> acted, was so impartial, so equitable, so agreeable to the Treaty of <HI>London,</HI> which was the Basis of this Congress; that the most solemn Ap∣peal may be made to Both the <HI>contesting Powers,</HI> Whether any one Step was taken, which could give any the least just Ground of Complaint. No Appeal is, indeed, necessary. The <HI>Imperial Court</HI> would loudly have complain'd of any Conduct; if there had been any towards that Court which could have deserv'd it. But there never was any Complaint of that Sort from thence: Nor indeed could there have been any made, without discovering at the same Time that there was nothing to complain of, but the too great Equity and Justice observ'd by the <HI>Me∣diators</HI> between the two contending Powers; and their resolute Adherence to all <HI>Treaties;</HI> and particularly to <HI>that</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> to which this Court itself had consented. Nor did <HI>Spain</HI> make the least Complaint against the Behaviour of the <HI>mediating Powers,</HI> through the whole Progress of the Mediation; but what arose from the con∣stant Justice of the Mediators, in keeping with∣in the Bounds of their Duty and Honour, and their not giving into any new and exorbitant Demands of that Court.</P>
<P>Thus, therefore, stands the Case. Whilst a <HI>Mediation</HI> was happily going on, under the Sanction of a solemn Treaty, appointing this <HI>Mediation;</HI> and this <HI>Appointment</HI> sign'd, and consented to, by these contending Crowns; with∣out
<PB N="12" REF="002880_0011_0FE685D574E88A58"/>any apparent Dissatisfaction, or even the least Pretence for it, a <HI>private Treaty</HI> is enter'd into, carried on, and finish'd at <HI>Vienna;</HI> in plain Contradiction to that <HI>Article</HI> relating to the <HI>Me∣diation,</HI> by which They had solemnly obliged themselves to settle the Points in Difference, under the Eye and Influence of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> And the whole conducted with the highest Disrespect to the mediating Powers, and without the least seeming Desire of keeping the common Measures of Decency with them. Con∣sidering, therefore, only the Manner and Cir∣cumstances attending this Transaction between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> at <HI>Vienna;</HI> as it was a Violation of an <HI>express Article</HI> of a former Treaty sign'd by Themselves, and an high and unprovoked Indignity offered to the <HI>Mediators;</HI> these were alone enough to justify the <HI>Mediators,</HI> in any publick act of due Resentment of such Usage.</P>
<P>But so far were They from shewing any such Resentment; so far from making this open Af∣front, the Occasion of an open Rupture; that, when the <HI>Signing of this Treaty was</HI> first, in Form, notified to the two Courts of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> and it was declared to be no other than a <HI>Defensive</HI> one, with Regard only to the mutual Satisfaction of the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> and not contradictory, but perfectly agreeable, to the Treaty of <HI>London:</HI> So far were They from improving such Usage into a publick Quarrel, that both at Home, and by their Mini∣sters every where Abroad, They express'd a great Pleasure that the <HI>Two Powers,</HI> whom the <HI>Me∣diators</HI> at <HI>Cambray</HI> could not bring even to
<PB N="13" REF="002880_0012_0FE6858C8C3DAEA8"/>Terms of common Civility towards one ano∣ther, had found the happy Means, without the Ceremony and Assistance of any <HI>Mediator,</HI> to get over Difficulties that had been declared al∣most insuperable; and to link themselves in the Bands of Friendship, upon Terms, not incon∣sistent (as it was affirm'd) with the <HI>Repose</HI> of <HI>Europe.</HI> This was the great End of the Con∣gress itself: And, if this End were answer'd; the Mediating Powers were not sollicitous about the Means used in compassing it; but could pass over the great Disregard shewn towards Them∣selves, in Consideration of the solid and com∣mon Good obtain'd by this Agreement.</P>
<P>But in how decent a Manner soever, the Courts of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> treated this Af∣fair: Those of the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> saw very well that such a Step could not but be very shock∣ing to the <HI>Mediators;</HI> and stood in need of the best Apology They could make. And very luckily (as They or their <HI>Agents</HI> thought) for Themselves, the Behaviour of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> in sending back the <HI>Infanta</HI> to <HI>Spain;</HI> joined with his <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty's not accept∣ing the <HI>sole Mediation</HI> at <HI>Cambray;</HI> furnished them with One as good as they could have wish'd. And therefore, the <HI>Imperial Ministers</HI> at <HI>Cambray,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> and at <HI>Paris,</HI> were very ready at first to put it all upon this; and to declare that, the Reason of this extraordinary Step was, that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France</HI> having affronted his <HI>Catholick Majesty</HI> in so high and so unpardonable a Man∣ner, that <HI>Spain</HI> could not in Honour any longer act with the <HI>Most Christian King,</HI> as a <HI>Media∣tor;</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="002880_0013_0FE685D596C46A38"/>and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> having de∣clined to act as <HI>sole</HI> Mediator, when it was pro∣pos'd to Him to do so by the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Spain:</HI> This broke off all Hopes of any Effect from the Congress at <HI>Cambray;</HI> and left his <HI>Catholick Ma∣jesty</HI> nothing to do, but to fly to <HI>Vienna;</HI> and, out of a due Resentment of so great an Injury, and the Necessity of his Affairs, to throw him∣self entirely upon the Honour and Equity of that Court: And, more particularly, that his <HI>Imperial Majesty,</HI> upon <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s first Applications, shewed a great Unwillingness to move the <HI>Ne∣gociations</HI> out of their Course at <HI>Cambray;</HI> but at last prevailed upon himself, out of Love to the <HI>Publick Tranquility,</HI> to consent to the car∣rying them on at <HI>Vienna,</HI> after he found it more and more plain, that the Resentment of <HI>Spain</HI> against <HI>France,</HI> and his <HI>Britannick Ma∣jesty</HI>'s Refusal of the <HI>Sole Mediation,</HI> made it impossible to proceed at <HI>Cambray.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the Language of the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> upon the first Notification of the <HI>Vienna Treaty,</HI> when they thought it needful to make an Apo∣logy for it. And tho' it cannot be affirmed that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> did itself expresly of∣fer this, as the first moving Reason of that Piece of Conduct; yet (accorning to the best Accounts from <HI>Spain</HI>) upon the first publick News of the <HI>Vienna</HI> Treaty at <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Discourses of many were taught to run that Way, and to dwell upon that same popular To∣pick. And without Doubt it was thought a very cunning Part, thus to attribute such a Conduct to sudden <HI>Rage</HI> and Passion; that <HI>this</HI> might
<PB N="15" REF="002880_0014_0FE685E6F6E86D50"/>afford some Colour for a <HI>Treaty</HI> in Appearance so detrimental to <HI>Spain,</HI> and a little palliate the <HI>low Terms</HI> accepted by that Crown; and by this means, as they flattered themselves, remove all Suspicion of any pernicious and unjustifiable Se∣cret behind the Curtain, till the due Time came for revealing it.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Dates</HI> are stubborn Things, not to be shaken by the Sound of Words and plau∣sible Speeches; this itself proved the most unluc∣ky Pretence possible: and only opened a Door to the best-grounded Suspicions, that something very bad, too bad to be owned, was at the Bottom of such a Behaviour.</P>
<P>The Courts of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were not so idle Spectators of the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> but that they had long before this the most evi∣dent Proofs in their Possession, that this Account of that Transaction was impossible to be true. The Resolution of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> rela∣ting to the <HI>Infanta,</HI> did not come (no, not in Suspicion) to <HI>Madrid,</HI> till <HI>March</HI> 8. N. S. 1724-5. <HI>Ripperda,</HI> who conducted the <HI>new Treaty,</HI> had been sent to <HI>Vienna</HI> above <HI>three Month</HI> before that: and even his <HI>full Powers</HI> for making this <HI>clandestine Treaty</HI> were sign'd <HI>Novem.</HI> 22. 1724. And soon after the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> was sign'd in form at <HI>Vienna,</HI> the publick Language at the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> was, That they had looked upon the <HI>Peace</HI> with the <HI>Emperor,</HI> as a Thing sure ever since the preceding <HI>March</HI> 29. on which Day a <HI>Cou∣rier</HI> was known to come from <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> with the Nows of all the <HI>principal Articles</HI> being adjusted, <HI>i. e. twenty one Days only,</HI> from the Day
<PB N="16" REF="002880_0015_0FE685E8957122C0"/>of the first News at <HI>Madrid,</HI> of the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Resolution of annulling his Marriage with the <HI>Infanta.</HI></P>
<P>This is so evident a kind of Demonstration, that Persons of the lowest Understanding can∣not but conclude from it, how absurd it is, to make this <HI>Resolution</HI> of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the first Step towards an excuse for what was re∣solved on, and set on foot, with full Powers signed for the Purpose, above three Months be∣fore it. For who is there, that cannot imme∣diately see, That a proceeding authorized, <HI>No∣vember</HI> 22. could not be owing to an Affront which was not heard of, till <HI>March</HI> 8. follow∣ing? And that a <HI>Treaty</HI> thoroughly adjusted, in its main Articles, at <HI>Vienna,</HI> so early in <HI>March,</HI> as to be known at <HI>Madrid,</HI> the <HI>Twenty ninth</HI> of that Month, could not be so much as facilitated, or modelled by what was not known at <HI>Madrid</HI> till the <HI>Eighth</HI> of the same <HI>March:</HI> And which therefore, could not in so few Days be sent to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to operate <HI>there;</HI> and the <HI>News</HI> of that <HI>Operation</HI> be return'd to <HI>Madrid?</HI></P>
<P>But, if possible, it was still more unaccountable to draw an Excuse from his <HI>Britannick Majesty</HI>'s not taking upon himself the <HI>sole Mediation</HI> at <HI>Cambray:</HI> which it was well known he could not have done without an open Affront to <HI>France;</HI> and a manifest Violation of the <HI>Quadruple Al∣liance;</HI> besides other Inconveniencies. For it was not till <HI>March</HI> 9. 1724-5. that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> mo∣ved this.—The <HI>Motion</HI> was then to be trans∣mitted to <HI>London;</HI> and the Answer to it, to be sent back to <HI>Madrid.</HI> This Answer did not arrive
<PB N="17" REF="002880_0016_0FE6859C1386D720"/>till about <HI>April</HI> 24. following: and therefore I need not say, could not have the least Part in a <HI>Trea∣ty</HI> set on Foot above <HI>four Months</HI> before, and <HI>sign'd</HI> in Form <HI>April</HI> 30. 1725. at <HI>Vienna, i. e.</HI> about a Week after his Majesty's declining the <HI>sole Me∣diation</HI> was known at <HI>Madrid;</HI> and when it was impossible to be known at <HI>Vienna.</HI> These there∣fore, were Pretences entirely foreign from the true Reasons of that Conduct. The <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Vienna</HI> was authoritatively begun, and going for∣ward, long before the <HI>Provocation</HI> from <HI>France</HI> could possibly palliate that clandestine and dis∣honourable Proceeding. And it must have been brought to perfect Maturity, <HI>before</HI> the Mo∣tion was so much as made to his <HI>Majesty</HI> to take on him the <HI>sole Mediation;</HI> because it was even sign'd in Form before the Intelligence of the King's Resolution against the <HI>sole Media∣tion</HI> could, with any Certainty, arrive at <HI>Vien∣na.</HI> And from such an Apology at the first Ap∣pearance of the <HI>new Alliance,</HI> the Courts of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> had a Right to be jealous; and to suspect some Secrets of a very pernicious Nature still behind.</P>
<P>But we have not yet done with this first Scene. It is proper to observe, that during this whole Proceeding, and for the Space of above three Months after the News of sending back the <HI>Infanta</HI> was come from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Expressions of <HI>Friendship</HI> towards the <HI>British Court,</HI> ran as high as possible at the Court of <HI>Spain, viz.</HI> to this Purpose: <Q><HI>That his</HI> Catho∣lick Majesty <HI>was resolv'd to seperate himself for ever from</HI> France, <HI>and place his entire Friend∣ship
<PB N="18" REF="002880_0017_0FE68605756E5458"/>and Confidence solely in the</HI> King <HI>of</HI> Great∣Britain: — <HI>That to this End he now desired to enter into the most strict Engagements for the rendering that Friendship perpetual. — That it was hoped,</HI> his Majesty <HI>would suffer</HI> the Nego∣tiations at Cambray <HI>to go on under</HI> his Me∣diation <HI>only,</HI> INTO WHOSE HANDS HE WAS DESIROUS TO PUT ALL HIS IN∣TERESTS,<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> whilst all this Time <HI>Rip∣perda</HI> was acting with <HI>full Powers</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in contradiction not only to this <HI>Mediation,</HI> and the Measures by which it must have been con∣ducted, had his Majesty accepted it; but, as we shall soon see, to all subsisting Engagements, and in Violation of the <HI>Laws</HI> of Friendship and Amity between Nations. Nay, whenever that <HI>Negotiation</HI> of <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s at <HI>Vienna</HI> happened to be touch'd upon, as a Piece of common Talk only, the Language of the Court <HI>of Spain</HI> was,
<Q><HI>That he was an enterprising Man, and loved to make a Noise in the World:</HI></Q> insinuating by this, that That <HI>Court</HI> had no Part in what <HI>Rip∣perda</HI> was doing at <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>his Majesty</HI>'s Reasons for not taking upon himself the <HI>sole Mediation</HI> were represent∣ed at <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Force of them was acknow∣ledged by that <HI>Court:</HI> and at the same Time a great Willingness was expressed to <HI>accept even of a Reparation from</HI> France, <HI>for the</HI> Indignity <HI>of∣fer'd to</HI> Spain, <HI>so it might come thro' the Hands of the</HI> King <HI>of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>and the Pleasure that</HI> Court <HI>would have, upon such a</HI> Reparation,
<Q><HI>in the Prosecution of the</HI> Negotiations <HI>at</HI> Cambray IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY
<PB N="19" REF="002880_0018_0FE685DF9983E7F8"/>WERE BEGUN; His Majesty <HI>being a common Friend to both Parties, and One of whose Af∣fection</HI> Spain <HI>had so often, and particularly</HI> up∣on this last Occasion, received the most es∣sential Proofs.</Q> I hardly need to observe, that at this very Time Things were so ripe at <HI>Vienna,</HI> that the <HI>Treaty</HI> of Peace was sign'd in Form, <HI>April</HI> 30. about seven or eight Days after this Language of <HI>Friendship</HI> at the Court of <HI>Madrid;</HI> and after these earnest Desires expressed, of the Continuation of the Negotiations at <HI>Cam∣bray in the Manner in which they were begun</HI></P>
<P>But this Way of Speaking did not cease yet: For after <HI>May</HI> 21. on which Day a Courier ar∣rived at <HI>Madrid,</HI> with the News that the <HI>Trea∣ty</HI> of Peace between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> was sign'd on <HI>April</HI> 30. After this publick In∣telligence of a <HI>Treaty</HI> sign'd at <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Lan∣guage of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> was full of <HI>Excu∣ses for not having communicated the Steps of this</HI> Negotiation <HI>at</HI> Vienna <HI>to</HI> his Britannick Ma∣jesty; and full of the usual Professions of
<Q>a <HI>particular Regard for his Friendship, and a sin∣cere Desire of cultivating the strictest Union with him;</HI></Q> together with all Assurances, <Q><HI>That no∣thing had been stipulated in this Treaty, in any wise prejudicial to the</HI> King, <HI>or to the Interests of his Subjects, or in the least contrary to any of the Engagements enter'd into with him, either se∣parately or jointly with</HI> France; and Expressions of a <HI>deep Sense of the great Obligation that</HI> Court <HI>had to his Majesty for the Proofs he had so of∣ten given of his Friendship and regard for the Interest of</HI> Spain; always accompanied with
<PB N="20" REF="002880_0019_0FE685E8B4839A80"/>the <HI>Hope, that what had happened would in no wise lessen</HI> his Majesty<HI>'s Friendship, which</HI> this Court <HI>entirely depended upon, and desired to cul∣tivate by all the Ways possible.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There were indeed Tokens and Symptoms of Evil continually, during this whole Scene of <HI>Civi∣lity,</HI> shewing themselves; fully sufficient to guard against all Trust in any such Professions, either of the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> or that of <HI>Vienna:</HI> and these, succeeded by <HI>worse</HI> and <HI>worse</HI> Ap∣pearances; and at last, by such certain Proofs as can leave no doubt of a <HI>Secret Treaty</HI> of the most dangerous Consequence between the two <HI>new Allies.</HI> And I will now mention some, in the Order of their Time.</P>
<P N="1">1. On <HI>May</HI> 1. <HI>O. S.</HI> 1725. the <HI>Emperor's Mi∣nister</HI> at <HI>London</HI> notified in Form to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the Signing of a <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> at <HI>Vienna</HI> between his <HI>Master</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain:</HI> and communicated a <HI>Copy</HI> of that <HI>Treaty</HI> at the same Time. After Assurances that this <HI>Treaty</HI> was made upon the Foot of the <HI>Quad∣ruple Alliance,</HI> with strict Regard to all former Engagements, and the like; He expressed his Imperial Majesty's Hope, that his <HI>Britannick Majesty</HI> would <HI>accede</HI> to this <HI>Treaty;</HI> and by virtue of that <HI>Accession</HI> be <HI>Cuarantee</HI> to the <HI>Succession</HI> to the Territories of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> as settled in his Family by a late Constitution: and before he concluded, said,
<Q>That, after the signing of the <HI>Vienna Treaty, Ripperda</HI> acquainted the <HI>Emperor</HI> that there remain'd still some Things to regulate between the <HI>King</HI> his Master, and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that the <HI>King</HI> of
<PB N="21" REF="002880_0020_0FE685B28E06BE78"/><HI>Spain</HI> requested the <HI>Emperor</HI> to make use of his <HI>Mediation,</HI> for the settling them: That the <HI>Emperor</HI> had answer'd, that if these Affairs had any Relation to the Treaty of <HI>London,</HI> or arose in consequence of that Treaty; and if it should prove agreeable to his <HI>Britan∣nick Majesty,</HI> he would employ his <HI>Mediation;</HI> but otherwise, He would not concern himself with them.</Q></P>
<P>To all this it was answer'd,
<Q>That, as for the <HI>Signing</HI> of the <HI>Treaty</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> it was no News here; his Majesty having Iready by a Courier received Advice of it: That, with Regard to the <HI>Guaranty</HI> mentioned, his <HI>Majesty</HI> could not consent to burthen him∣self with new Obligations, by being <HI>Guaran∣tee</HI> of the <HI>Succession</HI> lately established by the <HI>Emperor;</HI> but was resolved to leave his Hands at Liberty, in order to have it in his Power to regard, and assist, his true Friends upon all Occasions that may arise; and that, as for what he had related as represented by <HI>Ripperda</HI> to his <HI>Imperial Majesty,</HI> this Court knew of nothing <HI>Britain</HI> had to settle with <HI>Spain,</HI> but some Points of <HI>Commerce,</HI> for which there could be no need of a <HI>Mediator.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And certainly, no one can think but that it was wisely and happily judged, to refuse a <HI>Guaranty,</HI> which might have been attended with so fatal Consequences. For, as the <HI>Em∣peror</HI>'s Children are now <HI>Females</HI> only; and the Influence of that <HI>Succession</HI> upon <HI>Europe</HI> must depend upon the <HI>Marriages</HI> of these <HI>Fe∣males;</HI> and as no one <HI>then</HI> knew, to what <HI>Prin∣ces</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="002880_0021_0FE685C41BC48D10"/>they might be hereafter married: It was wise in his <HI>Majesty</HI> not to oblige <HI>himself</HI> to <HI>support</HI> a <HI>Succession</HI> which might possibly, by some fu∣ture <HI>Marriages,</HI> become formidable to the rest of <HI>Europe;</HI> and fatal in the End to <HI>Britain</HI> it self. And as it was wise, so it is already pro∣ved to be <HI>happy,</HI> that such an Engagement was refused: For (as it will by and by appear) the <HI>Succession</HI> is <HI>already</HI> in Prospect <HI>formidable;</HI> the <HI>Archdutchesses</HI> are destin'd to the <HI>Infants</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and such a <HI>Power</HI> arising from this Con∣junction, as in all humane Probability may make the rest of <HI>Europe</HI> tremble.</P>
<P>Nor can the Argument taken from the <HI>Em∣peror</HI>'s <HI>Guaranty</HI> of the <HI>Succession</HI> here, in his Majesty's Family, (which has been since urged,) be of any Force in this Case. For, in the <HI>first Treaty</HI> between his <HI>Majesty</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI> this <HI>Prince</HI> absolutely refused to be <HI>Guarantee</HI> to our <HI>Succession;</HI> and never would hear of it, 'till by the <HI>Quadruple Alliance</HI> his <HI>Majesty</HI> had obtained for Him the great Advantage of the Possession of <HI>Sicily.</HI> As therefore, his Impe∣rial Majesty refus'd the <HI>Guaranty</HI> of the <HI>Suc∣cession</HI> here, in his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Royal Family, in one Treaty, tho' a Treaty entered into and pro∣secuted with perfect Amity on both Sides; and as He would not <HI>afterwards</HI> come into it, but upon a very signal and beneficial Acquisition to himself first settled: <HI>This</HI> cannot be judged a good <HI>Argument</HI> for his <HI>Majesty,</HI> to <HI>accede</HI> to a <HI>Treaty</HI> enter'd into and finish'd, not only without his Privity; not only without any Regard to his Friendship, or any one Mark
<PB N="23" REF="002880_0022_0FE6864939527810"/>of Respect towards him; but in open Disre∣spect to <HI>him,</HI> as <HI>Mediator</HI> at a Congress then subsisting; and, under these very different Cir∣cumstances, to become a <HI>Guarantee</HI> of a <HI>Succes∣sion,</HI> of the Consequences of which, to his own Kingdoms, and the rest of <HI>Europe,</HI> no Judgment could be made, till the <HI>Marriages</HI> of the <HI>two Archdutchesses</HI> should come to be settled and known. But, to return to our present Subject.</P>
<P>This <HI>Proposal</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>'s being a Gua∣rantee for the <HI>new establish'd</HI> Succession in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> [to which the <HI>Emperor</HI> could not in Rea∣son expect a Compliance] consider'd alone, gave Ground for a Suspicion, that some latent Mat∣ter for Quarrel was now treasuring up. And this Suspicion justly increased, upon the Offer of the <HI>Emperor's Mediation,</HI> coming at the same Time with this <HI>Treaty</HI> itself. For this <HI>Offer</HI> supposed <HI>Differences</HI> between <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain:</HI> And as these must be <HI>Differences</HI> without any real Ground, (every material Thing being set∣tled by <HI>Treaties</HI> between those two Nations,) this look'd like a Design to blow up a Fire where there was none; and to presume an Un∣easiness between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> which might be improved hereafter into an open Rupture.</P>
<P>It is impossible, as we pass, not to observe how very artful the <HI>Manner</HI> of this <HI>first</HI> Pro∣position must now appear, since Things have opened more to the Eyes of the World. The <HI>Offer,</HI> we see, is made for accomodating <HI>Dif∣ferences,</HI> withont naming, or hinting at, any particular one. There would be no doubt but that the <HI>Offer</HI> was really made with Relation to
<PB N="24" REF="002880_0023_0FE685C80D1814D0"/><HI>Gibraltar.</HI> The Emperor's Minister was not to name this: But some time after, the Court of <HI>Madrid</HI> openly ovowed, that the Mediation <HI>of the Emperor which Spain had accepted,</HI> was a <HI>Mediation for the Restitution of Gibraltar:</HI> Nay, and some time after that, the <HI>Emperor</HI> himself, (as we shall soon see) orders his <HI>Resident</HI> here, to shew the <HI>Words</HI> in which he had obliged him∣self to this <HI>Mediation for Gibraltar.</HI> Again, this <HI>Offer</HI> is made, merely as arising from a Dis∣course of <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s; without the least Hint of any <HI>Obligation</HI> upon the <HI>Emperor</HI> to make it, or to prosecute it. And afterwards, this Offer of <HI>Mediation</HI> appears, by Order of the Impe∣rial Court, as an express <HI>Article</HI> of a <HI>Treaty</HI> be∣tween <HI>Him</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> But, what is still more, his Imperial Majesty by his Minister represents his Answer to <HI>Ripperda</HI> to have been, that he would not concern himself in any Affair that did not arise in consequence of the Treaty of <HI>London,</HI> not even so far as to use his <HI>Mediation:</HI> and after∣wards (as it will presently appear) by his <HI>Resident</HI> here, produces the Article itself, by which he had <HI>engaged</HI> himself to use his good Offices, that is, his <HI>Mediation,</HI> for the Restitution of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> of that Place, the Possession of which was known to be ascertained to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> by that very <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> confirming the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht;</HI> and about which therefore, it was as well known, that there could be no just Ground for a Difference.</P>
<P>All this sufficiently confirms, in Event, the Justice of that <HI>Suspicion</HI> of some <HI>Secret Agree∣ments</HI> between the <HI>Emperer</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> which
<PB N="25" REF="002880_0024_0FE685BBB5F1B528"/>the Offer of this <HI>Mediation</HI> immediately raised in the Court of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> And this, before the Treaty of <HI>Peace</HI> now delivered could be read and considered. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. When the <HI>Treaty</HI> itself was read and exa∣mined; and such <HI>Friendship</HI> was seen to be es∣tablished between <HI>such Powers,</HI> upon <HI>such Terms;</HI> the Consideration of this might justly raise yet stronger Suspicions. For thus the Case appeared. Nothing was found in this <HI>Treaty of Peace,</HI> of Importance, or, so much as in Appearance, Honourable to <HI>Spain:</HI> Nothing of the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> which had been so much insisted on at the Congress: Nothing of the <HI>Titles</HI> to be used by these <HI>Two Powers,</HI> but what might easily have been settled <HI>there,</HI> much more to the Honour of <HI>Spain.</HI> And, if we come to Points of much more Importance; the <HI>Neutral Garrison<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> which, by the <HI>Quadruple Alliance,</HI> were to be the great Bulwarks of the Succession of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> to <HI>Tuscany;</HI> and every Thing the <HI>Mediators</HI> had propos'd for <HI>his</HI> Security, and that of the Duke of <HI>Parma,</HI> were all lost to <HI>Spain</HI> by this Pro∣ceeding: Whilst the <HI>Emperor</HI> gains every Thing, and particularly the <HI>Guaranty</HI> of his own <HI>Suc∣cession</HI> by <HI>Spain,</HI> which the <HI>Imperial</HI> Ambassa∣dors had sollicited in vain at the <HI>Congress.</HI></P>
<P>To see, therefore, <HI>Two Powers,</HI> full of such a Rancour against one another as had resisted the Influence of a powerful Mediation for <HI>seve∣ral</HI> Years, now in so short a Space of Time run∣ning into one another's Embraces, with so much Eagerness and Precipitations:—To find (upon com∣paring
<PB N="26" REF="002880_0025_0FE685C29ADB3E80"/>this <HI>new Treaty</HI> with <HI>former</HI> Pretensions,) the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> at <HI>Cambray,</HI> so exceeding∣ly uneasy with the good Terms it was sure of obtaining by the <HI>Congress</HI> there; at <HI>Vienna,</HI> so <HI>readily</HI> submitting to <HI>much worse:</HI> —at <HI>Cambray,</HI> not to be satisfied with the Emperor's Faith, even with the <HI>Guaranty</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> together; at <HI>Vienna,</HI> entirely depending upon the Faith of the same <HI>Emperor,</HI> without <HI>any Guaranty</HI> present or to come: — What could be collected from such an Appearance, even upon the first Reading, but that this <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> now communicated at <HI>London,</HI> was not the sole Treaty made at <HI>Vienna;</HI> but that there must be a <HI>secret</HI> one still behind, too unjustifiable to be yet revealed? And of this more <HI>Suspicions</HI> fol∣lowed thick upon one another. For,</P>
<P N="3">3. Soon after the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> was signed at <HI>Vienna,</HI> which was <HI>April</HI> 30. 1725. <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s Insolences towards his <HI>Majesty,</HI> and even <HI>Threat∣nings</HI> began; and from that Time continued, till it was thought more <HI>politick</HI> to be more <HI>silent.</HI> Of these, the Advices from <HI>Vienna</HI> were now perpetually full. Such, for Instance, as these that follow, were his common Discourses.</P>
<P><Q><HI>If King</HI> George <HI>supports</HI> France, we know <HI>very well how to place the Pretender upon the Throne.</HI> — Alberoni <HI>was a Great Man, but committed many Blunders: One great one was, That he sent the</HI> Spanish <HI>Fleet to</HI> Sicily, <HI>instead of Sending it to</HI> England, <HI>to dethrone the</HI> King; <HI>which might easily then have been done: and this once done, the Way had been made plain for every Thing else.—King</HI> George <HI>had best con∣sider
<PB N="27" REF="002880_0026_0FE685E0DA690C20"/>how to come to Terms with us; for we have it in our Power to push the</HI> Pretender's <HI>Interest with</HI> Efficacy.</Q> And in all his Dis∣courses of this Sort, he always took it for grant∣ed, that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vienna</HI> would never make the least Hesitation to enter into all the Mea∣sures of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>His Conversations of this peculiar Melignan∣cy towards his <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, were with∣out Number, and without Measure. And so far was he from seeming to desire, they might be kept secret, that <HI>one</HI> of his Speeches to his Company was this: <HI>I know all that I say, is told again. I am very glad of it. I say what I say, on Purpose that</HI> it may be <HI>told.</HI> Nor did he speak with much greater Respect of his <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI>'s Allies. Particularly, upon the Mention of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Hanover,</HI> between the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Great Britain, France</HI> and <HI>Prussia,</HI> he said aloud, <HI>Yes, yes, We shall teach these little Gen∣tlemen (Petits Messieurs) to make Treaties.</HI> And I will add here that, about this same Time, a very considerable Man in the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> was not much behind <HI>Ripperda</HI> himself in his Regards towards his <HI>Majesty;</HI> when, in a <HI>Con∣versation,</HI> upon a Person's expressing his <HI>Doubt</HI> about his <HI>Britannick Majesty's undertaking</HI> to be Guarantee of the <HI>Austrian Succession,</HI> he answered with a great deal of Emotion. <HI>Then let him look to himself; for we are well inform'd they be∣gin to be weary of him in</HI> England.</P>
<P>We may well think these and many more <HI>In∣sults</HI> and <HI>Threatnings,</HI> from Persons of such Fi∣gure at that Time, sufficient to create new <HI>Su∣spicions,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="002880_0027_0FE6859BF1799A88"/>as well as to strengthen Those already created. Such Usage, and such Freedom of Language, could not arise out of <HI>nothing;</HI> but must be the <HI>Effect</HI> of some <HI>Agreements</HI> and <HI>Re∣solutions,</HI> not yet appearing to the World.</P>
<P>4. These <HI>Suspicions</HI> were greatly confirm'd by the Accounts from <HI>Vienna</HI> of <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s Ex∣pressions of another sort, immediately after the signing the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace: Expressions,</HI> I mean, dropt sometimes, as it were accidentally, upon several very important Points. He did not scru∣ple, in proper Places, and upon proper Occa∣sions, to declare in Conversation, <HI>that</HI> Spain was <HI>engaged to support the Ostend Company;</HI> and when that led the Discourse to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> he said, <HI>We know</HI> Gibraltar <HI>to be impragnable; but by the Measures we have now taken here, we assure Our selves we shall oblige</HI> England <HI>to give it up.</HI> At the same Time, he spake of the <HI>Marriage of</HI> Don Carlos <HI>with the eldest</HI> Archdutchess, <HI>as a Thing</HI> agreed upon; and added, <HI>the</HI> Prince <HI>of</HI> Asturias, <HI>for whom this Match was first de∣signed, is consumptive, and can't live.</HI> And sure∣ly, such <HI>Expressions</HI> must amount to the <HI>strong∣est Suspicions</HI> of a <HI>Treaty,</HI> as yet <HI>Secret,</HI> of which these <HI>Three</HI> important Points must make a Part. This is the <HI>least</HI> we can say of such Discourse, coming from a Principal <HI>Agent</HI> in this <HI>New Al∣liance;</HI> though at this Time only in the way of accidental Conversation.</P>
<P>5. These Suspicions grew stonger, upon the Appearance of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Commerce:</HI> which, tho' signed at <HI>Vienna</HI> on the Day after the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> yet, was not <HI>communicated</HI> to the
<PB N="29" REF="002880_0028_0FE685E0FB0D4770"/>Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> by the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Order: nor any <HI>Notification</HI> to this Hour, made, of such a Treaty, either <HI>before</HI> or <HI>since</HI> the Sign∣ing it. The King's Minister at <HI>Vienna</HI> procured a <HI>Copy</HI> of it, as soon as it was printed there, and transmitted it to <HI>London.</HI> When this came to be read; and when it appeared in the plainest Light, that, by the Express Words of it, such <HI>Altera∣tions</HI> were made in the <HI>Commerce</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> at must begin in the Ruine of our <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-India</HI> Trade, and end in that of all the other valuable Branches of our Commerce: What could the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> con∣clude from such a <HI>Treaty,</HI> but that even This, bad as it is, is not all; that there must be some∣thing yet unknown to put in the <HI>Balance,</HI> on the Side of <HI>Spain,</HI> for all these unparalleled Ad∣vantages given, against the express Words of <HI>for∣mer Treaties,</HI> to the <HI>Emperor</HI> and his <HI>Subjects;</HI> and that <HI>They,</HI> who were capable of entering into such <HI>Articles</HI> as these, which now appear'd, could not hope to succeed in them, without <HI>other Articles,</HI> and <HI>another Treaty,</HI> still kept in Darkness, till the proper Time of producing it should come?</P>
<P>6. About the End of <HI>July,</HI> or the Beginning of <HI>August,</HI> the D— of <HI>Wh—n</HI> arrived at <HI>Vienna.</HI> The Court of <HI>London</HI> was not ignorant of his real Errand: nor of the Sum of Money he received, in his Journey, towards his Expen∣ces, from the Pretender's Friends. And tho' he disguis'd his Design a little, when he first appear'd at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and pretended to his <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI>'s Friends there, that his View was only to
<PB N="30" REF="002880_0029_0FE6860EAF9B35C8"/>travel for a few Years, till the Memory of his Extravagancies at home might be a little effac'd, and his private Affairs in better order: yet, he quickly acted another Part in all his Con∣versation and Conduct. He soon grew <HI>intimate</HI> with <HI>Ripperda,</HI> with whom he had frequent Conferences, and from whom he was known to receive Money. He was admitted to the <HI>Con∣versation</HI> of the <HI>principal Persons</HI> of the Court of <HI>Vienna.</HI> And during his whole Stay, both <HI>He</HI> and <HI>Graham,</HI> the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Agent at <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI> had a very particular Intimacy with the <HI>Russian Minister</HI> at that Court. At first the Project was, that He was to return to <HI>England,</HI> and do great Exploits there. But when he him∣self began not to think <HI>England</HI> a very safe Place for one who had laid himself open; the Design of his Return thither was laid aside; and another Plan was then concerted, of sending him to <HI>Rome</HI> to the Pretender, and from thence to <HI>Spain.</HI> And before he parted from <HI>Vienna,</HI> his <HI>intimate</HI> and Fellow Labourer <HI>Graham,</HI> had long Conferences with a Person of great Importance at that <HI>Court:</HI> as he had <HI>afterwards</HI> several others. This <HI>Conduct</HI> of <HI>Wh—n</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> and of so many considerable Persons whilst he was there, still increased the Opinion, that the new <HI>Alliance</HI> could not be so innocent a Thing as the <HI>publick Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P>7. The smooth Language at <HI>Madrid</HI> was by this Time gradually abated, and at length quite changed. At the End of <HI>June</HI> 1725. the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> openly avowed the Acceptance of the <HI>Emperor's Mediation</HI> for the Restitution of <HI>Gi∣braltar;</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="002880_0030_0FE685941834B378"/>but at the same Time made the usual Professions of Friendship for the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and hoped that this <HI>Acceptance</HI> of that <HI>Mediation,</HI> would not offend him. Nor did this Court make any Scruple frankly now to own that the <HI>Affair</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> had been from the Begin∣ning a principal Point, concerted between the <HI>Em∣peror</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> In Consequence of this, about the Middle of <HI>July</HI> following, M. <HI>Grimaldo,</HI> by order of his Catholick Majesty, wrote a Let∣ter to his <HI>Britannick Majesty</HI>'s Minister at <HI>Ma∣drid;</HI> the Conclusion of which was very Pe∣remptory: <Q>That the Continuance of the Alli∣ance and Commerce of <HI>Great Britain</HI> with <HI>Spain,</HI> depended upon his Majesty's restoring <HI>Gibraltar</HI> forthwith.</Q> And the Language of this Court, from this Time, was of an insul∣ting Strain, with Regard even to the <HI>King</HI> him∣self, who was then at <HI>Hanover;</HI> and in Words, not very civil, to this Effect, <Q><HI>Let him make haste home, and call his Parliament, and propose the</HI> Restitution <HI>immediately.</HI></Q> This <HI>Alteration</HI> in the <HI>Language</HI> of the <HI>Court of Madrid;</HI> this de∣manding <HI>Gibraltar</HI> in so peremptory a <HI>Man∣ner,</HI> which <HI>Britain</HI> possesses by <HI>Treaties</HI> sign'd by this <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> himself, gave another just Ground of Suspicion of a <HI>Secret Offensive Trea∣ty,</HI> of a very pernicious Nature.</P>
<P>8. What confirm'd all these Suspicions very much, was, the <HI>Reception</HI> of <HI>Ripperda</HI> at <HI>Ma∣drid;</HI> of the <HI>Man</HI> who had been the Maker of the <HI>Vienna Treaties,</HI> and who had used <HI>his Majesty</HI> in so insolent and outragious a Man∣ner. For, as <HI>before</HI> his coming thither, no Satis∣faction
<PB N="32" REF="002880_0031_0FE685F42B25B338"/>was ever given at <HI>Madrid,</HI> upon Com∣plaint made of these <HI>Affronts</HI> and <HI>Threatnings:</HI> so, <HI>after</HI> it, all <HI>Honours, Profits,</HI> and <HI>Trusts,</HI> were heap'd upon him, in a Degree hardly ever known.</P>
<P>And it was but reasonable to conclude from hence, That, as the <HI>Court of Spain</HI> had veri∣fied one Part of his Publick Discourses at <HI>Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣na,</HI> by demanding <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> so the aggrandi∣zing and honouring him in so extravagant a Manner, without so much as the least Disa∣vowal of his Behaviour, at <HI>Vienna,</HI> towards the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> was a sort of Declaration, in Effect, that his whole Conduct, of which this was so remarkable a Part, was not only not displea∣sing at <HI>Madrid;</HI> but perfectly agreeable to the <HI>main Design,</HI> and Tendency of the <HI>new Alliance,</HI> begun, conducted, and finish'd by this very Man at <HI>Vienna.</HI> And indeed, daring as <HI>Ripperda</HI> was, yet, it is hardly conceivable that he would have dared to have treated his <HI>Britannick Majesty,</HI> in that insolent Manner; had he not known it to be agreeable to the <HI>Tenor</HI> of the <HI>New Al∣liance;</HI> and been well assured he should be sup∣ported in it.</P>
<P>There were all <HI>Suspicions,</HI> or something stron∣ger than <HI>Suspicions,</HI> built upon <HI>Appearances</HI> that could have no Interpretation put upon them; and could have no <HI>Meaning,</HI> nor <HI>Consistency</HI> in them; unless upon the <HI>Supposition</HI> of <HI>another Treaty</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> besides <HI>that</HI> made publick to the World. But we can still carry this Matter from <HI>Suspicion</HI> to <HI>Certain∣ty;</HI> For,</P>

9. As there are Times and Seasons, when the Discovery of Secrets may be thought to be of such singular Use, as to countervail all the In∣conveniencies of doing it: so it happened in this Case. <HI>Ripperda,</HI> now His <HI>Catholick Majesty</HI>'s Prime Minister at <HI>Madrid,</HI> thought it of the highest Importance to use all Means to prevent the Accession of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Hanover.</HI> And when he saw that other Methods failed of this Effect upon the <HI>Dutch Ambassador</HI> there; he had recourse to those which he thought would terrify the <HI>States,</HI> in their present Situation, from all Thoughts of doing it. At the beginning there∣fore of <HI>February,</HI> 1725-6. With the utmost Seri∣ousness and Positiveness, he assured both the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Minister at that Court, that there was a <HI>secret offensive Treaty</HI> between <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI> in which They had ob∣liged themselves mutually to support one another in their several Demands: And of this <HI>Treaty</HI> he told them <HI>three</HI> particular <HI>Articles.</HI> I. That the Emperor was to assist <HI>Spain,</HI> in the obtain∣ing <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> II. That <HI>Spain</HI> was to support the Emperor in his new <HI>Establishment</HI> of the <HI>Ostend Company.</HI> III. And the <HI>Third</HI> was an <HI>Article,</HI> to settle the <HI>Quotas</HI> of <HI>Money</HI> on one Side, and <HI>Soldiers</HI> on the other, for the Purposes of this <HI>secret Treaty.</HI> This was to Influence the <HI>Dutch</HI> to judge that it would be in vain to en∣deavour to alter or unsettle that <HI>Ostend Trade,</HI> which was so resolved upon, and so grounded.</P>
<P><HI>M. de Ripperda</HI> might have added another secret Engagement, into which the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Madrid</HI> had entered; <HI>viz.</HI> to under∣take
<PB N="34" REF="002880_0033_0FE6859623EA03F8"/>the placing the Pretender on the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and to begin with that Enter∣prize, before they proceeded to the Execution of their further Projects for involving all <HI>Europe</HI> in War and Confusion. Of this Engagement the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> received such certain Intelligence from several Quarters; that it is no more to be doubted, than These Particulars of the secret Offensive Alliance, avowed and de∣clared by <HI>M. de Ripperda.</HI></P>
<P><HI>M. de Ripperda</HI>'s profess'd Discovery of a secret <HI>Treaty,</HI> was soon farther confirmed by what fol∣lowed. An Account of this frank and open Discovery was immediately sent to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And, at the opening of the last Session of <HI>Parliament,</HI> A Noble Person in an high Station, agreeably to that Regard he owed to his Country, and to the Satisfaction due to that <HI>August Assembly,</HI> of which He was a Member, publickly declared it, in the House of <HI>Lords,</HI> as an undoubted Truth, and what <HI>Rip∣perda</HI> had own'd, That there was a secret <HI>Of∣fensive</HI> Alliance between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> which contained <HI>Articles</HI> in it destructive of the Rights of <HI>Britain,</HI> both with Regard to its <HI>Pos∣sessions</HI> and its <HI>Commerce</HI> abroad. This positive and undisguised Declaration in <HI>Parliament,</HI> made a great Noise without Doors. And, upon the Signification of this, to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> The <HI>Imperial Resident</HI> here was ordered to give Satisfaction to the <HI>British</HI> Court, upon this Subject. Accordingly, he came to some of His Majesty's Ministers, and read out of a Paper the Words which he said were the Con∣tents
<PB N="35" REF="002880_0034_0FE685A692AADAB8"/>of the Article which His Master had en∣ter'd into, relating to <HI>Gibraltar:</HI> The which implied, that his Master had engaged to use his Good Offices for the Restitution of <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> And this was ordered to be produced, as a full and satisfactory Proof that there was no such Thing as a secret <HI>Offensive Alliance</HI> be∣tween the two <HI>New Allies.</HI> One would think indeed, that no such <HI>Effect</HI> could possibly have been intended by this Proceeding, or expected from it. For, as upon this Occasion, it might have been naturally and justly expected, as a Thing absolutely necessary to the Vindication of the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> that the <HI>Imperial Resi∣dent</HI> here, should have been order'd to have shewn likewise what followed immediately this Article; and indeed the Treaty it self, of which it was a part: And as neither of these was ordered or suffered to be done; the Whole of this taken together, will prove the Truth of that very imputation, which the Court of <HI>Vi∣enna</HI> designed by this Step to vindicate itself from, as from something unjustifiable and dis∣honourable.</P>
<P>If from <HI>Vienna,</HI> we go back once again to <HI>Madrid,</HI> we shall find still more <HI>Evidences</HI> of a <HI>secret Treaty.</HI> For just about the same time that <HI>Ripperda</HI> spake so openly to the two <HI>Am∣bassadors,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> himself wrote a Letter to the <HI>States General</HI> for the same Pur∣pose of keeping them from acceeding to the Treaty of <HI>Hanover:</HI> which was read in the <HI>As∣sembly</HI> of the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland. Feb.</HI> 8. <HI>N. S.</HI> 1725-6. In <HI>this</HI> He acquaints Them, That
<Q>He
<PB N="36" REF="002880_0035_0FE685FDCEAB0CF8"/>stands obliged to assist his Imperial Majesty, in case of a War, or Insult — which He will per∣form — making it a common Cause — hold∣ing for Enemies Those who shall be Enemies of his <HI>Imperial Majesty.</HI></Q> All which, as de∣nounced to the States, who had no uneasiness with the <HI>Emperor,</HI> but on account of the <HI>Ostend Company,</HI> must regard only That; and can have no Meaning but this, that, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> should act, merely in their own Defence, and in sup∣port of their own Rights, against that Company; His <HI>Catholick Majesty</HI> had entered into an En∣gagement to assist the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and support the <HI>Ostend</HI> Company by Force, if needful: as it was explained by that King's <HI>Minister</HI> himself at the <HI>Hague,</HI> in a Declaration made by Him,
<Q>That His Catholick Majesty would look upon what∣ever should be undertaken against the <HI>Ostend Company,</HI> as done against himself.</Q> This is an open owning of a Treaty, besides That already <HI>Publick;</HI> and of an <HI>Engagement</HI> in it to support the <HI>Ostend</HI> Company by Force.</P>
<P>To proceed; When about two Months after the first Declaration made by <HI>Ripperda,</HI> it was represented at <HI>Madrid</HI> how much the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was surprized at this open Dis∣covery, made to the <HI>Two Ambassadors, of a secret Offensive Treaty:</HI> No other Reply could be obtained, but, in general Words, That the <HI>Court of Spain</HI> still desired the Friendship of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that the Engagements en∣ter'd into at <HI>Vienna,</HI> would not hinder this. Nor could any thing that was urged, move <HI>that Court,</HI> either to <HI>own</HI> this <HI>secret Treaty;</HI> or at all
<PB N="37" REF="002880_0036_0FE6859649739610"/>to <HI>deny</HI> it. Very soon after this, the two <HI>Ambassa∣dors</HI> thought it proper to have a Conference with <HI>Ripperda;</HI> in which He began a little to shuffle, and to <HI>interpret away</HI> what he had said of an <HI>Of∣fensive Treaty,</HI> by endeavouring to persuade them, That it was little more than a <HI>Defensive One.</HI> But being press'd by <HI>Both,</HI> who agreed in what He had before told them; and required peremp∣torily to answer, whether he had not declared to Them expresly that there was a <HI>secret</HI> Offen∣sive Alliance between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> He answered, <HI>That he had told them so;</HI> and ad∣ded, <HI>that all he had told them was true.</HI> And how indeed could he possibly deny it, since there was not a <HI>Foreigner</HI> of any Distinction at <HI>Madrid,</HI> who had not heard him, without Reserve, de∣clare the same about this <HI>secret Offensive Alliance?</HI> And whom can we believe in such a Case; if not a Prime Minister so often affirming a matter of Fact to so many; whilst neither the <HI>King</HI> his <HI>Master,</HI> nor any of His other <HI>Ministers</HI> at that time denied it; or at all look'd as if they had any Thoughts then of denying it?</P>
<P>And once more, when an Application was made at <HI>Madrid,</HI> from the <HI>British Court,</HI> with Re∣lation particularly to the Part which <HI>Spain</HI> appear∣ed now to take in the Affair of the <HI>Ostend Trade;</HI> at first nothing was avowed, but an Obligation to use <HI>Good Offices</HI> for accomodating that Affair. But, when a <HI>Proposal</HI> was offer'd, which the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> acknowledg'd to be a very <HI>rea∣sonable</HI> one; and when upon this it was urg'd, That, since This Proposal was thought a <HI>reasona∣ble</HI> One; if the Imperial Court should refuse to
<PB N="38" REF="002880_0037_0FE685F17A170860"/>listen to it; This could be a <HI>just Reason</HI> why <HI>Spain</HI> should not support the <HI>Emperor</HI> any farther in what <HI>Spain</HI> it self judg'd to be unreasonable; It was answered, <Q>This could not be allowed: For <HI>Spain</HI> must stand by its <HI>Engagements</HI> with the Emperor.</Q> This was a plain Acknow∣ledgment of farther <HI>Engagements,</HI> and of <HI>another</HI> Sort, than those of a <HI>Friendly Accommodation;</HI> and by just Consequence, of a <HI>secret Offensive Trea∣ty.</HI> For such Engagements must be enter'd into by <HI>Treaty;</HI> and this <HI>Treaty</HI> must be distinct from <HI>That</HI> already <HI>published,</HI> which does not contain them; and it must be an <HI>Offensive</HI> Treaty, be∣cause it is in support of an Invasion made upon the <HI>Rights</HI> of others; and in opposition to Those who act only in <HI>defense</HI> of those Rights found∣ed upon the most solemn Treaties.</P>
<P>After all this, it is too late for the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> to sink the Credit of this <HI>Discovery</HI> made by <HI>Ripperda</HI> to the two Ambassadors; or to think of destroying the Credibility of what this Court it self has given Testimony to. All the <HI>Circumstances</HI> of this Affair, as I have related them, make it too plain to be <HI>now</HI> evaded: And all who know any thing of <HI>Publick Affairs,</HI> will look upon what I have now produced, as a po∣sitive and convincing <HI>Evidence</HI> of what before was only a strong <HI>Suspicion.</HI></P>
<P>This therefore, we are too sure of; That the now publick <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> made at <HI>Vienna,</HI> was it self enter'd into without the least Provo∣cation from the <HI>Mediators;</HI> in contradiction to an <HI>Express Article</HI> of the <HI>Quadruple Alliance,</HI> appointing this <HI>Mediation</HI> alone for the adjust∣ing
<PB N="39" REF="002880_0038_0FE68605989ECBA0"/>remaining Differences; cover'd all the time at <HI>Madrid</HI> with the smoothest Language, and the pretended earnest Desire of proceeding still at <HI>Cambray;</HI> and made up of Articles so disho∣nourable to <HI>Spain,</HI> that nothing can account for them, but the <HI>Supposition</HI> of another, and this an <HI>Offensive Treaty,</HI> yet private: That this is not only <HI>Supposition</HI> upon <HI>Conjecture;</HI> but is pro∣ved to. Us, by Arguments too strong to be deni∣ed; the repeated Affirmation of <HI>Him</HI> who was made Prime <HI>Minister of Spain</HI> after he had made this <HI>Treaty;</HI> the Acknowledgments in Effect of the Two Courts themselves of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Mad∣rid,</HI> with regard to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and the <HI>Ostend Trade;</HI> and the Order from <HI>Vienna</HI> for producing at <HI>London</HI> an Article of a <HI>Treaty,</HI> in such Words and in such a manner, as makes it impossible to doubt of the Reality of it.</P>
<P>We will now see what Light we can get in∣to the Nature of This so certain <HI>Offensive Alli∣ance;</HI> and the other <HI>Treaties</HI> between the <HI>Em∣peror</HI> and <HI>Spain:</HI> and in what manner <HI>We</HI> Our selves are likely to be affected by <HI>Them;</HI> with regard to, the great and only Security of all our other good Things, the present <HI>Protestant Royal Family;</HI> with regard to the Possessions of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in <HI>Spain;</HI> with regard to the settled Rights and Privileges of the Nation in <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Commerce;</HI> and indeed, in consequence of these, with regard to our being, or not being at all, a Nation worth existing. If after this, we extend our View farther, We shall see what is likely to be the Fate of Europe; and what will become
<PB N="40" REF="002880_0039_0FE6861A0B455488"/>of the Ballance of Power, if the main Designs projected in this late Alliance at <HI>Vienna,</HI> should be permitted to take effect. This Enquiry is the only way to our making a true Judgment of the Steps taken by <HI>Britain,</HI> and the Powers in Alliance with it. And when we have done this, — <HI>Let them that are Blind, be blind still.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>first</HI> Enquiry which will offer it self, upon this Occasion, to the Mind of every True <HI>Briton,</HI> will arise from the Interest We all have, in the preservation of our present <HI>Protestant Esta∣blishment;</HI> and our <HI>concern</HI> to find out how <HI>This</HI> is already, or <HI>will</HI> probably be, affected by this <HI>New Alliance.</HI></P>
<P>I know very well how easy and how common it is, to laugh at the Name of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> when∣ever it is mentioned upon such Occasions; as a Political <HI>Bugbear,</HI> or <HI>Scare-crow,;</HI> a mere Word of Alarm; or a Puppet to be play'd by <HI>Statesmen</HI> at their pleasure, ond whenever their Designs re∣quire it. But it would be very unfortunate for <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and end in the total Ruine of <HI>Us</HI> and our <HI>Posterity;</HI> if Those who are at the Helm, should suffer themselves, at the Pleasure of such as wish them no good, to be laugh'd out of that Care and Wakefulness which their <HI>King</HI> and their <HI>Country</HI> require of them. There is not a Day, nor an Hour, in which the necessity of Attention to this great Point, does not appear: Nor is there, I fear, any <HI>Crisis</HI> of Affairs in <HI>Europe</HI> possi∣ble, at this time, without <HI>This</HI> bearing a great part in it. And therefore, when a Breach with a <HI>Protestant</HI> King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who loves his <HI>Subjects</HI> too honestly to give up their greatest
<PB N="41" REF="002880_0040_0FE685A4FA9285A8"/>Concerns to the Demands of any Power upon Earth, is thought convenient and useful; no one can help concluding, from the known Princi∣ples of the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Madrid,</HI> that the Moment They resolved upon entring into an <HI>Alliance</HI> so injurious to his <HI>Britannick Majesty,</HI> and so destructive to the Interists of <HI>Britain:</HI> The same Moment another Resolution must also be taken: The Resolution of giving his <HI>Majesty</HI> all the uneasiness they could, even in his highest Rights; and either forcing Him by this Means to <HI>Their</HI> Terms; or prepairing the way for a <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> after their own Hearts, from whom they may expect all Submission and Com∣pliance. But this is only a probable Argument. Let us come now to <HI>Facts.</HI></P>
<P>I have already mentioned some Preliminaries; the Journey of <HI>Wh—n</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and his Con∣duct and Intrigues and Encouragements there; as well as <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s <HI>threatning King George</HI> with the <HI>Pretender,</HI> before he left <HI>Vienna.</HI> But afterwards the <HI>Appearances</HI> of a <HI>settled Design</HI> against His <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI> and His <HI>Royal Family,</HI> soon began to thicken apace; and the <HI>Intelligences</HI> about it to be very positive, from all the Friends of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at almost every Court of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, according to what had been before concerted at <HI>Vienna,</HI> the D— of <HI>Wh—n,</HI> with Letters Recommendatory from young <HI>Rip∣perda,</HI> went for <HI>Rome,</HI> directly to the <HI>Spanish Minister</HI> residing there. By this Minister, he was introduced to the <HI>Pretender.</HI> In the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s House, he was kept close shut up for <HI>Six Days;</HI> to hide, if possible, his being there: And, after
<PB N="42" REF="002880_0041_0FE6859EC89B3388"/>very close Conference, was posted away to <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI> where old <HI>Ripperda,</HI> his great and intimate Friend, was now in high Credit and Honour.</P>
<P>Thither he came with <HI>Credentials</HI> from the <HI>Pre∣tender;</HI> and, as a publick Mark of Confidence in him, adorn'd with a Garter, and a new Title; and was very kindly entertain'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> with these open Distinctions of Treason and Perjury upon him. And tho' it was often said, and pro∣mised and sworn to, by <HI>Ripperda,</HI> that this <HI>New Agent</HI> should be sent away in <HI>twenty four Hours time;</HI> and as strongly sworn to, that he never admitted him, nor ever would, into his Compa∣ny; yet he still remain'd at <HI>Madrid,</HI> without any Mark of displeasure, and was known to be fre∣quently with <HI>Rpperda</HI> himself in close Conference. His intimacy with Count <HI>Konigsec,</HI> the <HI>Imperial</HI> Minister at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and the freedom of his Vi∣sits to him, were very remarkable, at a Time when he profess'd himself to come into <HI>Spain</HI> on no other Errand but the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Service; and this, without reserve to the <HI>English</HI> themselves at <HI>Madrid,</HI> who were in the Friendship, and even in the Service of the Crown of <HI>Britain.</HI> This made it certain, that the Business of these fre∣quent Meetings with Persons of Character, both in the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Imperial</HI> Service, could be no other, than that which brought him to <HI>Madrid.</HI> At the same Time the late Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was admitted to frequent <HI>Audiences</HI> at <HI>Court:</HI> In which no one could think that the Interests of his Ma∣ster were forgot. On the contrary, Now it was that several Projects for the Execution of what was the sole End of <HI>Wh—n</HI>'s Journey to <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="002880_0042_0FE68606C80AA3B8"/>were laid before the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> to be weighed and considered in their several Probabi∣lities.</P>
<P>What can the greatest Well-wisher to this <HI>New Alliance</HI> say, in Apology for this Conduct of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> as well these Audiences given now to the late Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> as the Recepti∣on of the D— of <HI>Wh—n</HI> was favour'd with, at a Time when he came directly commission'd by the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and never attempted to hide the full intent of his Journey? What can any one say, who will but read the <HI>sixth</HI> Article of the Peace of <HI>Utretcht?</HI> in which the <HI>Catholick King</HI> doth promise, <HI>as well in his own Name, as in that of his Heirs and Successors, that they will not at any time disturb or molest the</HI> Queen, <HI>her Heirs and Suc∣cessors of the Protestant Line, being in the Possession of the Crown of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>and the Dominions, sub∣ject thereunto; neither will the aforesaid</HI> Catholick King, <HI>or any of his Successors, give at any time</HI> any Aid, Succour, Favour <HI>or</HI> Counsel, <HI>directly or indi∣rectly, to any Person or Persons, who on any Cause or Pretence should hereafter endeavour to oppose the said Succession by open War, or by any Conspiracies against such Prince and Princes, possessing the Throne of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>by virtue of the Acts of Parliaments made there.</HI> And since his <HI>present Majesty</HI> came to the Throne, in <HI>Article</HI> 5. of the <HI>Quadruple Alliance,</HI> (to which <HI>Quadruple Alliance</HI> the present King of <HI>Spain</HI> acceded, before the opening of the Con∣gress at <HI>Cambray</HI>) his Catholick Majesty (as the Emperor had done before) <HI>binds himself, his Heirs and Successors, to maintain and guaranty the Succession in the Kingdom of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>as established in
<PB N="44" REF="002880_0043_0FE68582777A0AA8"/>the House of his</HI> Britannick Majesty <HI>now reigning; as likewise to defend all the Dominions and Provinces possessed by his Majesty; and not to give and grant any Protection or Refuge, to the</HI> Pretender (there described) <HI>or his Descendents, nor any</HI> Succour, Counsel, <HI>or</HI> Assistance <HI>whatsoever, directly or indi∣rectly.</HI> And to <HI>observe the same,</HI> [<HI>i. e.</HI> not to give <HI>Reception, Succour,</HI> &amp;c.] <HI>with regard to those who may be order'd or Commission'd by the said Person [the</HI> Pre∣tender] <HI>to disturb the Government of his</HI> Britannick Majesty, <HI>or the Tranquility of his Kingdoms,</HI> &amp;c. Let but the late and present Conduct of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> be compar'd with these express Stipulations; and every Reader may be left to make his own Inferences from such a Compari∣son. To return,</P>
<P>The Evil I was speaking of, was not to rest in Words and Schemes; nor were the Projects I have mentioned, only proposed in <HI>Theory.</HI> Prepa∣rations were actually made in <HI>Spain,</HI> to put the determin'd Purpose in Execution: Of which Preparations I will enumerate certain Particulars that could not be concealed.</P>
<P>In <HI>February</HI> 1725-6, a Resolution was taken to send a Body of Troops consisting of 12000 Men, to the Coasts of <HI>Galicia</HI> and <HI>Biscay.</HI> There were at that Time at <HI>Cadiz</HI> several <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships that were plainly designed for an Imbarkation: Two of them were of 70 Guns, one of 64, one of 56, one of 26, and one of 24; and all victuall'd for a hundred Days. And at <HI>Cadiz</HI> it <HI>now</HI> was, that 4800 Arms were known to have been bought, and destin'd to the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Service. His <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI>'s Minister at <HI>Madrid,</HI> did indeed, upon the
<PB N="45" REF="002880_0044_0FE68610B3915310"/>Discovery made to him of the Place where they lay in Pawn for a certain Sum, take effectual Care, by first laying down that Sum, and after∣wards paying their whole Price, to keep them out of the Hands of the first Purchasers, who earnestly sollicited to have them, and frequently offer'd the Money which had been lent on them. For he knew from undoubted Intelligence, the Purpose They were intended for. Besides these Ships at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> there were likewise then in <HI>Spain,</HI> three <HI>Russian</HI> Men of War, one of 64 Guns, and the other two of about 40 Guns each, equipp'd some time before from <HI>Petersbourg,</HI> which came to <HI>Cadiz</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Winter</HI> 1725, to carry on the Pretence of Merchandize; but in <HI>Decem∣ber</HI> went from thence to St. <HI>Andero,</HI> and lay there the three following Months.</P>
<P>As to these three Ships, the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> some time after they sailed from <HI>Peters∣bourg,</HI> made a full Discovery, by Letters from the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Agent there, and others concerned in this Transaction, which fell into their Hands; that they had been fitted out at the Expence of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Friends, with the Privity of the Court of <HI>Petersbourg,</HI> and sent to <HI>Spain,</HI> to be em∣ployed in an Expedition for the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Ser∣vice; and that five more had been contracted for, and were design'd to follow. And according∣ly, at the Time of their passing the <HI>Sound,</HI> so very particular a Joy was express'd at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> by a certain <HI>Party</HI> there, that it could not but be re∣mark'd by the Friends of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> at that place. And in their Passage, when they lay in the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and afterwards were driven
<PB N="46" REF="002880_0045_0FE685A6B39DF188"/>by Stress of Weather into <HI>Ireland;</HI> his Majesty's Officers belonging to the Customs, who, accor∣ding to their Duty went on Board, found all the Symptoms of Enmity to his Majesty; all possible Tokens of a warlike Design; and all the Fears of a Discovery that could shew themselves. And <HI>after</HI> these Ships were safe in <HI>Spain,</HI> it was given out by one of the greatest Men in the Court of <HI>Russia,</HI> and written by another great Man, from his Mouth, to <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in order to influence the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
<Q>That the Alliance of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> would be of the less Moment; since the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court, and the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Measures in <HI>Spain,</HI> would now find those two Powers full Employ∣ment.</Q> And it was likewise <HI>after</HI> the safe ar∣rival of these <HI>Russian</HI> Ships at St. <HI>Andero,</HI> and du∣ring their stay there, that the Motions and Pro∣jects of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Friends grew more and more vigorous in <HI>Spain</HI> Not only the late Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> admitted to frequent Audiences at this Juncture, but one <HI>Connock,</HI> the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s constant Minister at <HI>Madrid,</HI> hardly ever out of <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s House; and one <HI>Pomphilly,</HI> lately come from <HI>England,</HI> offering Money to all the <HI>Broken Officers</HI> he could meet with at <HI>Madrid;</HI> (as several of them freely affirm'd, and particularly a <HI>Swiss Pro∣testant,</HI> One of those to whom the Offer was made) and this professedly upon a Design then on foot in favour of the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>From the mention of these particular Prepa∣rations, I pass on to shew what Use was intend∣ed to be made of the whole. So early as in <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI> 1725-6, 12000 Men (as has been said a∣bove) were design'd to be sent to the Coasts of
<PB N="47" REF="002880_0046_0FE685F44E561AE0"/><HI>Galicia</HI> and <HI>Biscay,</HI> the first Project of the Court of <HI>Madrid</HI> being to make an Attempt on his Ma∣jesty's Dominions from those Parts. But as such a Body of Troops could not at that Juncture march thither, without giving an Alarm; the Pretence for it, made use of by the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> was, that they had certain Intelligence of a Re∣solution taken by the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to land a Number of Troops in that part of the Country; who were to burn and destroy all be∣fore them, and even the Shipping in all the Harbours. Under the Cover of this pretended Intelligence, which no one in <HI>England</HI> could pos∣sibly give, and which no one at <HI>Madrid</HI> could re∣ally believe, the March of these Forces was or∣dered. But his Majesty's Minister at <HI>Madrid,</HI> representing to the Duke of <HI>Ripperda</HI> (who was then Prime Minister, and in the highest Degree of Trust and Confidence with the King his Ma∣ster) that such Intelligence could have no Foun∣dation; and even that such a Design from <HI>England</HI> was impossible; <HI>Ripperda</HI> promised the March of those Troops should be forborn, till a Declarati∣on from the <HI>British</HI> Court, to the Purpose of what Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI> had said, could be obtained. But the true Reason of delaying this March, was, that some of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Friends had represen∣ted to the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> that the sending of 12000 Men to <HI>Galicia</HI> and <HI>Biscay,</HI> without any Colour of Necessity for them, in a Country where there never used to be above two or three Battal∣lions, would give such an Alarm to <HI>England,</HI> as would inevitably put us upon our Guard; and therefore it would be more eligible to order that
<PB N="48" REF="002880_0047_0FE685848C5A4310"/>Body of Troops to <HI>Navarre,</HI> on a very natural Pretext of securing that Frontier against <HI>France;</HI> but when there, they would be so near <HI>Gupius∣coa,</HI> that they might be ready to imbark on a very short Notice, in Transports to be provided at a Port of that Province; and be convoyed from thence by a Number of Men of War, of which those three <HI>Muscovite</HI> Ships were to be part. They proposed at the same time, that some few Ships should be sent with Arms from <HI>Cadiz</HI> directly to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and a Body of 6000 Men kept ready by the Emperor at <HI>Ostend.</HI></P>
<P>But the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> being soon after per∣fectly informed, that such vigorous Resolutions were taken, and such Preparations and Disposi∣tions made, by <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that it was in vain for them to hope for any Success at that Time from such an Attempt; they suspended for the present the putting this Design in Execution; the rather, finding themselves obliged to send part of their Ships from <HI>Cadiz</HI> and St. <HI>Andero</HI> to the <HI>West∣Indies:</HI> And the <HI>Muscovite</HI> Ships returned home.</P>
<P>Thus in Fact stood the <HI>Case,</HI> in favour of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> at the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> before the <HI>vigorous Measures</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> alter'd it. And, who that considers the whole of this, will be mo∣ved by any the strongest <HI>Verbal Asseverations</HI> of that Court, against such Facts; when it is re∣member'd, That this whole Scene of the <HI>New Al∣liance,</HI> which is acknowledged to be framed a∣gainst our <HI>Trade,</HI> and our Right to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> was begun and carried on to perfection, under the Colour of the highest Regards to his Majesty; and accompanied all along with the strongest and most pathetick Assurances of <HI>Friendship?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="002880_0048_0FE6859EA1E1D400"/>
Especially, if we add here, what ought to al∣larm the <HI>British</HI> Court, and was sufficient it self to justify all their <HI>earliest Precautions</HI> and <HI>Preparations; viz.</HI> That soon after the publishing the <HI>Vienna Treaties</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Commerce,</HI> They had positive Intelligence, and Intelligence from more than one Person; and such as could be entirely de∣pended on; That one express Article of this <HI>Al∣liance</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> contain'd an Obligation in Favour of the <HI>Pretender;</HI> and a Stipulation to make the Attempt for him in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> before opening the War in any other parts. And by as undoubted Intelligence it was added, That the <HI>Pretender,</HI> in return, had since obliged himself to restore <HI>Gibraltar</HI> and Port <HI>Mahon</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> to be Guarantee of the Emperor's <HI>Ostend-Trade;</HI> and lay open the Com∣merce, with our <HI>Plantations</HI> abroad, to their Ships, with the fame Privileges as the <HI>English</HI> themselves enjoy. And for this <HI>Article,</HI> enter'd into by the <HI>Emperor</HI> with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> for the Service of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> there is as certain Evidence, as of the Being of a <HI>secret Treaty:</HI> Of which I cannot think it possible to doubt, after what has been, and will be, said upon the <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> and the <HI>Ostend-Trade.</HI></P>
<P>This brings our Thoughts to the Court of <HI>Vi∣enna;</HI> For <HI>This Article</HI> touches the <HI>Imperial Court,</HI> equal with <HI>That</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> and proves the <HI>Preten∣der</HI>'s Cause, to be the Concern of the <HI>Former,</HI> as truly as of the <HI>Latter;</HI> and to be made so by an express <HI>Stipulation</HI> in a <HI>Treaty.</HI> And this alone is <HI>Evidence</HI> enough of the worst <HI>Dispositions</HI> towards a <HI>King,</HI> and a <HI>Nation,</HI> which have not deserved
<PB N="50" REF="002880_0049_0FE6859436743368"/>such a Return from <HI>Vienna.</HI> For, <HI>This</HI> single Point being certain, it will be of <HI>small</HI> Importance to alledge the Conduct of this Court in not giving such publick Tokens of <HI>this</HI> Disposition, in <HI>Fact,</HI> as the <HI>Other</HI> has done: Which will only shew a cautious <HI>Prudence</HI> in the <HI>Execution,</HI> but not at all any <HI>Innocence,</HI> or <HI>Ignorance,</HI> of such <HI>Designs.</HI> The <HI>Article</HI> alone demonstrates the <HI>Design;</HI> and that is sufficient.</P>
<P>But indeed, if, <HI>after</HI> this, We consider the most <HI>publick</HI> Parts of the late Conduct of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court towards this Nation, we cannot conclude less than this, That there is little Thought or De∣sire <HI>there,</HI> of keeping any. Terms with us, in any respect: I mean, that part of Conduct which re∣gards our <HI>Trade,</HI> not only by Consequence, but directly and immediately. At <HI>Ostend,</HI> and in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the present and future fatal <HI>Effects</HI> of the <HI>New</HI> Establishment are too visible: At the same <HI>Ostend,</HI> which was conquered and preserved by <HI>our Arms,</HI> and those of the <HI>Dutch.</HI> In <HI>Sicily,</HI> rescued from the <HI>Spaniard</HI> by our <HI>Fleet,</HI> as well as secured to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> by the good Offices of our King in the Treaty of <HI>London:</HI> In the same <HI>Sicily,</HI> the Kindness was soon returned by a <HI>prohibition</HI> of all our <HI>woollen Manufactures;</HI> and this <HI>prohibition</HI> not yet removed, but only <HI>suspended</HI> for a while, upon the strongest <HI>Representations</HI> and the plainest Evidence, that this proceeding was against the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Treaties,</HI> which made the <HI>British Privileges</HI> there, exactly the same, as in all other Domini∣ons of <HI>Spain,</HI> to which it once belonged: Those same <HI>Treaties,</HI> under which the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> at the Peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> took possession of this <HI>King∣dom</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="002880_0050_0FE685FA20077680"/>of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and under <HI>which</HI> the present <HI>Empe∣ror</HI> took it after him. And lately, in the <HI>Austrian</HI> Dominions in <HI>Germany,</HI> preserved from Ruine by <HI>the Arms</HI> and Money of Us and our Allies, most Species of our <HI>Manufactures</HI> are prohibited. So that in every Inch of Ground his <HI>Imperial Majesty</HI> is possessed of; even in those Countries gained by our Assistance, and where he is as closely bound by particular Treaties, as the most solemn and repeated Engagements can bind him: In all, He has acted the same part towards Us, in one of our tenderest Concerns. And if the <HI>Imperial Court</HI> be resolved to go on in these Paths; This alone must determine them to espouse the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Interest: As They are fully assured of His pre∣sent Majesty's firm Resolution never tamely to give up the Rights and Privileges of this Nation, in so essential a Point as that of Trade.</P>
<P>But I have done: And I am sure, have said enough upon this <HI>first Point,</HI> to put it beyond all Doubt, that this <HI>New Alliance</HI> at <HI>Vienna</HI> contains in it, and will certainly bring after it, if not vi∣gourously opposed, the most unspeakable Evil to <HI>Great Britain;</HI> by engaging, and attempting, to subvert our present happy Establishment.</P>
<P N="2">II. I will now say a Word or two about the Possessions of <HI>Great Britain</HI> within the <HI>Spanish</HI> Do∣minions; and how They must be affected by this <HI>new Alliance.</HI> These are <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and Port <HI>Mahon;</HI> won by our Arms in lawful War; ascer∣tained to us as our Property, by all the Parties concerned in that War; and secured to us by all the Solemnity of Alliances, and Treaties, and particularly by this present King of <HI>Spain</HI> him∣self,
<PB N="52" REF="002880_0051_0FE6858258668560"/>in two express Articles of the Treaty of <HI>Peace</HI> sign'd at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> 1713. For, of the great <HI>Importance</HI> especially of <HI>One of them,</HI> (I mean <HI>Gi∣braltar)</HI> I would not be thought to speak as any the least <HI>Motive</HI> to a just and brave People to va∣lue and preserve it, were not the Possession of it founded upon the strictest Right, and the most undeniable Maxims of Political and National Ju∣stice. But when that <HI>Importance,</HI> to which <HI>Spain</HI> gives Testimony by the eagerness discovered to wrest it out of our Hands, is added to the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Possession;</HI> No one among us, who is a true Lo∣ver of his Country, can be easy under the pros∣pect of an <HI>Alliance,</HI> which opened it self to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with the Civil Complement from <HI>Spain</HI> of demanding <HI>Gibraltar</HI> immediately, as the Con∣dition of the Continuance of a Friendship, which cannot be violated without the Breach of all Faith and Trust in Treaties; and with the <HI>Em∣peror's Obligation,</HI> to use His kind Help to bring <HI>Britain</HI> to a Compliance with that <HI>Demand.</HI> I have already spoken of this <HI>Demand,</HI> and this <HI>Ob∣ligation,</HI> as certain Evidences of a <HI>secret Offensive Alliance</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I now speak of this <HI>mutual Engagement</HI> between these two Powers, for the Recovery of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> as <HI>one</HI> of the unjust and pernicious Conditions of their <HI>new Alliance.</HI> And, after I have before so plainly proved, That this <HI>Engagement</HI> makes one main part of it; not only from <HI>Ripperda</HI>'s repeated Af∣firmation both at <HI>Vienna</HI> and at <HI>Madrid;</HI> but from the perumptory Language used at <HI>Madrid</HI> after this <HI>Alliance</HI> at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and from the Testimony from <HI>Vienna</HI> added to This, that there was an
<PB N="53" REF="002880_0052_0FE685FA43BE38B0"/>express <HI>Article</HI> containing the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Stipulati∣on upon this Head; and this <HI>Testimony</HI> given at <HI>London,</HI> by Order of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court, in a very remarkable manner. After the Proof of this Fact, I need say no more than that, if the Designs of this <HI>Alliance</HI> be not vigorously opposed, and effectually broke, the first unwelcome Evil to <HI>Great Britain</HI> must be, To see a place of the utmost Importance to us, if we will trust the Confession both of <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Enemies,</HI> wrested from us by <HI>Force,</HI> (if it be possible) unless we will basely yield it up to the importunity of Those who ask it; and a place, which is our Honour, and our Strength abroad; a great <HI>Defence</HI> and <HI>Advantage</HI> to our extended <HI>Navigation;</HI> and a <HI>Convenience</HI> to our Ships of all sorts, not to be equalled by any other Place, that can be offer'd by that <HI>Crown,</HI> which would deprive us of it.</P>
<P N="3">III. But indeed this <HI>Place,</HI> could it be pre∣served to us by all our Strength and Prudence, would be of no Importance to us hereafter; if the <HI>other</HI> Schemes of This <HI>new Alliance</HI> stand good. It will be a small Comfort to <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> and little better than a <HI>Ridicule,</HI> to have in possession so great a Convenience to <HI>Shipping</HI> and <HI>Trade,</HI> as <HI>Gibraltar</HI> is; if we are to be stripped of that <HI>Trade</HI> it self, and to be reduced to the Condition of having little or no Occasion for any <HI>Shipping</HI> at all. And yet, This I think must be the Case with us, if the <HI>Projects</HI> of this <HI>new Union</HI> are suffered quietly to succeed. For our <HI>Trade</HI> it self, that Ornament and support of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> must by Degrees be so affected, in almost every Branch of it, that it connot but
<PB N="54" REF="002880_0053_0FE685F19C1266C0"/>naturally lessen, Flag, and Dye, just in Propor∣tion as this <HI>new Alliance</HI> gains Strength and flou∣rishes. There can be little Hope, if this Con∣junction proceeds much farther, of obtaining any Redress for the many injuries in Commerce, already received; or of preventing many more, from the Side of <HI>Spain:</HI> and much less, if pos∣sible, of keeping the Designs at <HI>Ostend</HI> from having Effect; which, taken with all their ex∣tended ill consequences towards almost all the Branches of our Trade, are enough to awaken all <HI>Britons,</HI> who have been used to esteem their <HI>Commerce,</HI> as their darling Good: — a Good, to the support and increase of which, all their <HI>Treaties</HI> and <HI>Alliances</HI> have for many Years past solely tended; and in Comparison of which they have despised, and left to Others the <HI>Ac∣quisition</HI> of <HI>Tracts</HI> of Land, and <HI>Territories</HI> to en∣large Dominion and Power. Hitherto, We have always shewed our selves sensible that <HI>Trade</HI> was our proper Life; and the Encouragement of this, upon an honourable Bottom, the proper Nourishment of that Life. Every Instance of Conduct in any Power at Home, which has but seem'd to shake it a little, or to touch it, at a Distance, in an unkindly Manner, has been found to be so resented, as to disunite the grea∣test Friends; and at once to unite those of dif∣ferent Views amongst us, in a vigorous Opposi∣tion to it. And every Step, in order to defend and promote it, has been received with univer∣sal Applause; and reconciled and enlarg'd the Affections of Men to such Benefactors. And with regard to <HI>Foreign Nations;</HI> every hurt, any
<PB N="55" REF="002880_0054_0FE685C440A9B168"/>of them do to our <HI>Commerce;</HI> every Breach into the Fences and Privileges with which that is guarded and enrich'd; every Shadow of a Ten∣dency this way, has aways been view'd here, as the higest of all Injuries to this Nation, and the natural Subject for the genuine and just Resent∣ment of every true <HI>Briton.</HI> And if we are not dead to all this Sense; if we still retain the pro∣per Life and Vigor of <HI>Britons;</HI> that is, of a Na∣tion adorn'd and supported by the most extended Commerce that can be boasted of by any People: What can we think of an Alliance between two powerful Princes, form'd, against the plain Sti∣pulations of <HI>Treaties,</HI> in order to deprive us of our Glory, our Riches, our Strength, which de∣pend all upon our <HI>Trade;</HI> and afterwards, to de∣send and preserve Themselves in their Acquisitions of our Rights?</P>
<P>These are not Words without a Meaning; nor Fears merely of Imagination set on Work by pre∣sent Resentment: But real, Substantial, and un∣deniable. For, if the Union of these two Pow∣ers proceeds upon the present Foot; and be not thoroughly broken in its terrible Parts; let any one say, what hope can remain of any Bounds to be set to the Injuries our Trade has selt, and must feel? Will those <HI>Depredations</HI> and <HI>Hostilities,</HI> com∣mitted in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> un∣der pretence of their Right to guard against <HI>Clan∣destine</HI> Trade; Those Violences, by which the whole Commerce of <HI>Jamaica</HI> has been well nigh destroyed, and the Trade of that Island redu∣ced to a miserable Condition, be now redress'd? Or, will the Remonstrances of these Grievan∣ces,
<PB N="56" REF="002880_0055_0FE68606E6F15C40"/>which have had no Effect <HI>before</HI> the Treaties of <HI>Vienna;</HI> now, <HI>after</HI> such <HI>Treaties</HI> are made, meet with any better Reception at <HI>Madrid;</HI> and procure Us a more favourable Answer? Will any Complaints, or Representations, in support of the acknowledg'd Rights of the <HI>South-Sea-Compa∣ny,</HI> obtain now so much as a Hearing at the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> when the Strength of such an <HI>Alliance</HI> is added to the former Disinclination to∣wards any Redress; and is suffered by the other Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> to exert itself? Or, will They, who have been hitherto unmoved by <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> at length <HI>voluntarily</HI> listen to their Voices? Or, will the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> which has stood out, <HI>before</HI> this Alliance, against all Sollicitations, relinquish the <HI>Pretensions</HI> at <HI>Ostend,</HI> and act agree∣ably to <HI>former Treaties</HI> in the Affair of <HI>Commerce;</HI> now <HI>after</HI> the Riches of <HI>Spain</HI> are to come in, to the Aid of former Resolutions?</P>
<P>So far from this, that it is an express <HI>Article,</HI> stipulated in this <HI>New Alliance,</HI> that, as the <HI>Em∣peror</HI> is to assist <HI>Spain</HI> in the regaining of <HI>Gibral∣tar;</HI> so is <HI>Spain</HI> obliged to support the <HI>Emperor</HI> in his <HI>Ostend Company,</HI> and his <HI>Commerce.</HI></P>
<P>This Article, relating to the <HI>Ostend Company,</HI> as part of a <HI>Secret Offensive Alliance,</HI> (as I have before shewn) was more than once not only ac∣knowledg'd, but boasted of, to the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ministers at <HI>Madrid,</HI> by <HI>Ripperda,</HI> when he was prime Minister in <HI>Spain.</HI> But we have not only this Evidence. For, as in the Affair of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> the <HI>Emperor</HI> himself, by producing an <HI>Article</HI> of a Treaty, gave Testimony to his having enter'd into <HI>Engagements</HI> relating to that
<PB N="57" REF="002880_0056_0FE685D6E31E0938"/>Place; so, his <HI>Catholick Majesty</HI> has not scrupled to give his own Testimony, that, by this <HI>New Alliance,</HI> He has entered into <HI>Engagements</HI> to sup∣port the <HI>Emperor</HI> in his Establishment of the <HI>Ostend Company;</HI> not only by the Language of his Court at <HI>Madrid;</HI> but by what he wrote him∣self, and ordered his <HI>Minister</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to denounce, by way of Threatning, to the <HI>States General,</HI> upon this Subject. of which I have given an Account before. And besides all this, it is enough to look upon the <HI>Publick Treaty</HI> of Commerce sign'd at <HI>Vienna, May</HI> 1st, 1725. to be satisfied, that such Privileges in <HI>Commerce</HI> are granted, by <HI>Spain,</HI> to the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Subjects, as are contrary to many former <HI>Treaties,</HI> and to the most manifest <HI>Rights</HI> of <HI>other Nations</HI> found∣ed upon those Treaties.</P>
<P>I shall not enter minutely into all the Parti∣culars which are of <HI>Importance,</HI> upon this Head. The <HI>Subject</HI> has been so plainly stated, and even exhausted, before the World aleady, that there can be no need of any Thing farther, than to refer those who have not yet look'd into the Depth of this Affair, to the several <HI>Memorials</HI> of the <HI>States General,</HI> and of those commission'd by Them, upon this Occasion; particularly those which were printed here, in the <HI>Daily Courants</HI> of <HI>Dec.</HI> 16. 1725. <HI>Jan.</HI> 19. 25. <HI>Feb.</HI> 5. 8. 12, and 14. 1725-6. in which all the Pretences of their Enemies are compleatly and plainly answered; and the <HI>Matter</HI> placed in the most evident Light. I will only just state the <HI>Dates</HI> and <HI>Intent</HI> of the Treaties, relating to the <HI>Commerce</HI> most immedi∣acely affected by the new <HI>Ostend Company;</HI> and
<PB N="58" REF="002880_0057_0FE6860E9245DF28"/>add a Word or two about the farther Conse∣quences of it.</P>
<P>So long ago as the Year 1609, the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> by the Truce then made with the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> granted them their first Privileges of <HI>Trade</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> by which the <HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Company has been from that time in Possession of their Commerce in those Parts. But these Privileges wanted <HI>Confirmation:</HI> and this they fully obtain'd from the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> after long and mature deliberation, at the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Munster</HI> in the Year 1648. by which, the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> not only granted the <HI>Hollanders</HI> these Privileges; but engag'd <HI>itself,</HI> to <HI>maintain and protect them, in the Enjoyment of these Privi∣leges.</HI> In this <HI>Treaty</HI> the Bounds were set to the several Pretensions of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Castil∣lans</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> and the <HI>Limits</HI> of their distinct <HI>Navigation</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> there, exactly fix'd: and not only all other Subjects of <HI>Spain</HI> were totally excluded from the <HI>East Indies;</HI> but the <HI>Castillans</HI> themselves were for ever <HI>excluded</HI> from all <HI>Commerce</HI> and <HI>Navigation</HI> within the <HI>Limits</HI> of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> as <HI>These</HI> were like∣wise prohibited from entring into those of the <HI>Castillans.</HI></P>
<P>And, before this, the absolute <HI>exclusion</HI> of all the Inhabitants of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> from all Trade or Commerce in the <HI>East</HI> or <HI>West Indies,</HI> was in the Year 1598 made an express <HI>Article</HI> in the Act of <HI>Cession</HI> of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> by <HI>Philip</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain,</HI> upon the Marriage of his Daugh∣ter <HI>Isabella</HI> to the <HI>Arch-Duke Albert:</HI> The <HI>Eighth</HI> Article of which <HI>Cession</HI> is this, That
<Q>The
<PB N="59" REF="002880_0058_0FE6858C66283FE0"/><HI>Arch-Duke</HI> and <HI>Arch-Dutchess</HI> themselves, and their Successors, shall not exercise any Navi∣gation, and Commerce in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies,</HI> under the Penalty of being deprived of those Provinces; and if any of their <HI>Sub∣jects</HI> shall act contrary to this, they shall be punished with Rigour, in some Cases even with Death itself, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Neither was this at that time at all <HI>complain'd</HI> of by the States of those <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> even when several other <HI>Conditions</HI> of the Reception of those new <HI>Governours</HI> were re∣monstrated against, as so many Grievances upon the People of those Provinces. Neither was there afterwards any <HI>Protest</HI> made by any Persons concerned, against this <HI>Exclusion,</HI> whilst the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was concluding the Treaty of <HI>Munster</HI> with the <HI>United Provinces.</HI> This shews that the present Complaint of the Hardship of such <HI>Ex∣clusion</HI> is <HI>new</HI> and <HI>artificial;</HI> and come many Years too late, as it comes after <HI>solemn Treaties</HI> made, and renewed, in express Confirmation of this <HI>Exclusion.</HI></P>
<P>To proceed; After the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Munster,</HI> an Accident happened, which plainly shewed, how the <HI>Fifth</HI> Article of that <HI>Treaty</HI> was understood, not only by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but by <HI>Spain</HI> also One <HI>Bastien Brower,</HI> a Subject of <HI>Spain,</HI> either of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣bant,</HI> or of <HI>Flanders,</HI> had obtain'd a <HI>Permission</HI> from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to go to the Coasts of <HI>China</HI> where he carried on a very profitable Trade. When this came to the Knowledge of the <HI>High∣Council</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Dutch East-India Company,</HI> they made a solemn <HI>Resolution</HI> immedi∣ately, and sent it as an Order to the Commanders
<PB N="60" REF="002880_0059_0FE685E6D9867C20"/>of all their Ships, and to all their Subjects, <HI>to take this Man Prisoner;</HI> and if he defended himself, to use <HI>force</HI> against him. This had its Effect. The Man never appeared any more to give them far∣ther Trouble. Other Subjects of <HI>Spain</HI> desisted from all such Voyages. The Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> ne∣ver complained of this Conduct; and by this Si∣lence, plainly gave Testimony to the Justice of that <HI>Resolution,</HI> as founded upon the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Mun∣ster.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1667, by a Treaty between <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> all Privileges of <HI>Commerce</HI> and <HI>Naviga∣tion</HI> in both the <HI>Indies,</HI> were granted to his <HI>Britan∣nick</HI> Majesty's Subjects, in as full and ample man∣ner, as they were granted to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Treaty of <HI>Munster.</HI> And in the Year 1713, a Treaty of <HI>Commerce</HI> was concluded at <HI>Utrecht</HI> be∣tween the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and this pre∣sent King of <HI>Spain:</HI> By the <HI>First Article</HI> of which it is declared, That, <Q>the Treaty of Peace, Commerce, and Alliance concluded at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in 1667, is ratified and confirmed by this Trea∣ty;</Q> and it is added, that, for the greater <Q>Strengthening and Confirmation of the same, it has been thought proper to insert it Word for Word in this Place.</Q> Then follows that former Treaty thus ratified and confirmed.</P>
<P>In the Year 1724, but one Year before this <HI>New Alliance</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> this same King of <HI>Spain</HI> was so sensible of his <HI>Obligations,</HI> lying upon him from the Treaty of <HI>Munster</HI> alone, that he pre∣sented, by his Ambassador at <HI>London,</HI> a Memorial against the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Attempts upon <HI>Trade</HI> from <HI>Ostend;</HI> in which he insisted, that the Assair of
<PB N="61" REF="002880_0060_0FE6858AF5636B60"/>the <HI>Ostend Company</HI> should be brought before the <HI>Congress</HI> at <HI>Cambray,</HI> in order to have the said Com∣pany abolished, before he could in Conscience think of confirming the Cession of the <HI>Nether∣lands</HI> to the <HI>Emperor:</HI> And urges, that, if this <HI>Con∣firmation</HI> should be made by <HI>Spain,</HI>
<Q>without re∣serving expresly to it self the exclusive Right on the Navigation to the <HI>Indies,</HI> in general, and without Exception; the <HI>States-General</HI> would be rightly entitled to demand Satisfaction of <HI>Spain,</HI> for having thereby made a great Infra∣ction of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Munster,</HI> and would be disengaged from the reciprocal Obligation to abstain from the Navigation of the <HI>Spanish In∣dies.</HI></Q> That is, in other Words, that if he, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> should not support the <HI>Dutch</HI> (and consequently the <HI>English</HI> also) against the <HI>Empe∣ror</HI>'s new Establishment at <HI>Ostend; that then,</HI> I say, he himself should be justly charged with a most <HI>dishonourable Breach</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> and Violation of solemn Treaties. Thus stands the Engage∣ments of <HI>Spain,</HI> with regard to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> in the Affair of their <HI>Trade</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s new Attempts at <HI>Ostend.</HI> Let us now consider the <HI>Obligations</HI> and Engagements of the <HI>Emperor</HI> himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> 1701, between the <HI>Emperor Leopold,</HI> King <HI>William,</HI> and the <HI>States-General,</HI> is built upon this very Fountation of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade to the <HI>Indies,</HI> as upon a <HI>main Ground</HI> of that Alliance. It opens itself with re∣citing, that upon the <HI>Death</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> II. <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> without Issue, the <HI>Emperor</HI> claimed the Right of Succession to his Countries, as belong∣ing
<PB N="62" REF="002880_0061_0FE6858AD57E6930"/>to the <HI>Austrian Family;</HI> and, after other Par∣ticulars, it follows,
<Q>so that without some Re∣medy applied, the <HI>Emperor</HI> will lose his Pre∣tensions; the Empire lose its <HI>Fiefs</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> and the ENGLISH and UNITED PROVIN∣CES be deprived of the <HI>free Use</HI> of their NA∣VIGATION and COMMERCE in the IN∣DIES, and other Places,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it appears, 1. That the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Fami∣ly claiming by <HI>Hereditary Right</HI> these <HI>Provinces,</HI> could not <HI>rightfully</HI> claim any <HI>Powers,</HI> but what were vested and remained in <HI>Charles</HI> II. the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to whom they were to succeed; nor possess <HI>them,</HI> but upon the <HI>Conditions,</HI> upon which the deceased King himself had possessed them: And that the Emperor neither could, nor did, claim any thing that his Predecessors, Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> had parted with by solemn Treaties; and therefore neither could, nor did, claim those Coun∣tries, but upon the some Terms and Contitions of Trade, on which King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>Spain</HI> had en∣joyed them, agreeably to solemn Treaties with other Powers. 2. That the Preservation of the Trade in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> up∣on the Foot they enjoyed it, and in the Manner it was carried on, to the Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>Spain,</HI> was one ground, and a main one, of the <HI>Grand Alliance;</HI> and that the Emperor's Pretensions to the Low-Countries were support∣ed by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> upon this, amongst other Conditions, that the Emperor should reci∣precally support their Trade to the <HI>Indies,</HI> on the Foot they had constantly enjoyed it. 3. It hav∣ing been already proved, that <HI>Holland</HI> ever since
<PB N="63" REF="002880_0062_0FE685C830F95A80"/>the Treaty of <HI>Munster</HI> in 1648, and <HI>England</HI> ever since the Treaty of <HI>Madrid</HI> in 1667, have carried on their Trade to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> to the Exclusion of the Subjects of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> by Virtue of those Treaties; it follows, That, in consequence of this, and by Virtue of this <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> it self (by which the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Claim to these Countries is allowed, and the <HI>Claim</HI> of the Allies to their <HI>Commerce</HI> also insisted on) the Emperor did in Ef∣fect oblige himself and his <HI>Family,</HI> whenever in Possession of these <HI>Countries,</HI> to take upon them∣selves all the Obligations which the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> to whom they succeeded, were under, to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> by former <HI>Treaties;</HI> and to support this <HI>main End</HI> of the <HI>grand Alliance,</HI> relating to the Commerce of the Allies, (expressly mention∣ed in it,) as well as <HI>their own</HI> Pretensions: and, instead of invading them themselves, to defend them against all <HI>Invaders,</HI> according to the Obli∣gations of those <HI>former Treaties.</HI> Nay, it was like∣wise expressly stipulated, in this <HI>grand Alliance,</HI> supposing it to end successfully; That the <HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI> should be (not the <HI>Property</HI> of the <HI>Em∣peror</HI> absolutely, and without any Conditions; but) a Barrier to the <HI>United Provinces.</HI> So that we see, the <HI>Emperor,</HI> in the <HI>grand Alliance</HI> itself, considered his own Right to the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> with a View to the Trade of his <HI>Allies;</HI> and that the <HI>Spanish Low-Countries</HI> were established in that <HI>Al∣liance,</HI> as a <HI>Defence</HI> and <HI>Guard</HI> to those <HI>Allies,</HI> whose Trade is now going to be ruined from them.</P>
<P>But these <HI>Obligations</HI> are not only the real In∣tent and <HI>Consequence</HI> of the <HI>grand Alliance:</HI> But it is declared in express Words, in the Barrier <HI>Treaty</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="002880_0063_0FE685D706F02F20"/>concluded at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> in 1715, between his pre∣sent <HI>Britannick Majesty,</HI> this present <HI>Emperor,</HI> and the <HI>States-General,</HI> Art. 1. That <Q>the <HI>Emperor</HI> (this present Emperor) should enjoy the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> as they were enjoyed, or ought to have been enjoyed, by the late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. conformably to the Treaty of <HI>Ryswick.</HI></Q> That is, with the <HI>same Privileges,</HI> and the same <HI>Obligations,</HI> neither greater nor less.</P>
<P>After all these solemn Stipulations and Trea∣ties here recited, is it conceivable, what has now been done in the Face of the World? — That <HI>Emperor,</HI> who was under all his Father's Obliga∣tions: who could not succeed, even by his Title of Hereditary Right, to these <HI>Low Countries,</HI> but under the same <HI>Engagements</HI> with those <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> to whom he succeeds: Who himself, in his own Person, has declared, in a solemn Treaty, that He enjoys these Countries no otherwise, than as they were enjoyed by the late King of <HI>Spain;</HI> that is, under the same Restrictions and Obligations to which that <HI>King</HI> was engaged: That same Emperor, instead of protecting the Commerce of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> from the In∣vasions of others, himself openly invades it; in∣stead of punishing any of his Subjects in the <HI>Ne∣therlands</HI> for <HI>Attempts</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> or restraining them, as he is strictly obliged to do, He has himself <HI>erected</HI> a <HI>Company,</HI> and endowed it with great <HI>Privileges,</HI> on purpose to Trade thi∣ther; and, instead of yielding to the just Remon∣strances of injured Neighbours, he has set them at Defiance, and strengthened himself with a <HI>new Accession</HI> of the Power and Riches of <HI>Spain,</HI> to
<PB N="65" REF="002880_0064_0FE685CACC472870"/>back this unjustifiable Seizure of those Rights of <HI>Commerce,</HI> which are the <HI>established</HI> and peculiar Privileges of other Countries. Such has been the Conduct of the <HI>Emperor.</HI></P>
<P>And the part which <HI>Spain</HI> has acted, with re∣gard to <HI>Ostend,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> is, if possible, still more extraordinary; and more out of the <HI>common Road</HI> of dealing with <HI>Treaties</HI> and <HI>Alliances.</HI> For thus it is, — That <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> who enjoys his Kingdom under the <HI>Stipulations</HI> of the <HI>Treaties</HI> made by his <HI>Predecessors:</HI> — who has confirmed them all <HI>himself,</HI> in his own Person:— <HI>He,</HI> who in <HI>one</HI> Year declared it would be a Breach of his Treaties, for Him ever to acquiesce in the Establishment of the <HI>Ostend East-India</HI> Company: That same King, the next Year, does much more than this. He undertakes, by this <HI>new Alliance,</HI> to <HI>support</HI> the <HI>Emperor</HI> in this very Establishment. Not only this; but he grants to these very <HI>Osten∣ders,</HI> and all other Subjects of the <HI>Emperor</HI> in the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> what he had no Right to grant to them, had they remained his own Subjects; nay, he grants them <HI>Privileges</HI> of his <HI>Ports</HI> and Places in the <HI>Indies,</HI> greater than are allowed to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> themselves: And this, not only with respect to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> but the <HI>West-Indies</HI> also. For by the 2d and 3d Articles of the <HI>Vienna Treaty</HI> of <HI>Commerce,</HI> a Liberty is granted to them, to frequent, and Trade in, the Ports of the <HI>Spanish West Indies;</HI> Or, supposing this not directly granted, in express Words, yet they are at least permitted to <HI>enter</HI> into those Ports for victualling or repairing their Ships: which will come to the same Thing. For if they may
<PB N="66" REF="002880_0065_0FE68610D6946158"/>enter into, and remain in those Ports, till they have provided themselves with all Necessaries, the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Bullion</HI> Trade is of that sort, that no Precaution can prevent that Commerce.</P>
<P>I am sensible it may be objected here, that the Liberty granted to the Emperor's Subjects, by the Treaty of <HI>Vienna,</HI> to enter into the Ports of <HI>Spain</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> in case of Distress of Weather, or for refreshing themselves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is no more than what was formerly granted to his Majesty's Sub∣jects by the Treaty of <HI>Madrid,</HI> concluded in 1670. But it is well known, that the Liberty granted by that Treaty, has ceased for many Years; and that, in order to prevent the Abuses that might be committed from such a permission, and that one Nation might not be more favoured than a∣nother on any Pretext whatsoever in the Trade to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> sufficient Care was taken of that Matter in the 8th Article of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> by which it is expressly stipulated, and declared in the following Words: <HI>Whereas among other Conditions of the general Peace, it is by common Consent established, as a chief and fundamental Rule, that the Exercise of Navigation and Commerce to the</HI> Spanish West-Indies, <HI>should remain in the same State it was in the Time of King</HI> Charles II. <HI>of</HI> Spain, <HI>and that therefore this Rule may hereafter be observed with inviolable Faith, and in a Manner never to be broken, and thereby all Causes of Distrust and Suspicion con∣cerning that Matter may be prevented and removed; it is especially agreed and concluded, that no License, or any Permission at all, shall at any Time be given to the</HI> French, <HI>or any other Nation whatever, in any Name, or under any Pretence, directly; or indirectly, to</HI> SAIL,
<PB N="67" REF="002880_0066_0FE68619E8952900"/><HI>Traffick,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>to the Dominions subject to the Crown of</HI> Spain <HI>in</HI> America; <HI>except what may be agreed by the Treaty, or Treaties of Commerce,</HI> (there referred to) <HI>and the Rights and Privileges granted in a certain Convention called,</HI> El Assiento de Negros. And the <HI>same Condition</HI> is likewise stipulated in the 34th Article of the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> between the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the States. And there needs no other Argument to prove, that it was always understood by the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> itself, in the Sense of not suffering any Ship to enter in∣to any Port of <HI>Spain</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> on any Pretext whatever, but to observe, That the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> are never permitted, though under the greatest Distress of Weather, or want of Pro∣visions, to put into any of those Ports; but their Ships if they come in, are constantly confiscated: and upon this very Account, that, if once En∣trance were permitted, the Traffick could not but follow. Yet notwithstanding that this is a fundamental Rule of the Treaties of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and an Article of the general Peace, which is strict∣ly observed with regard to all other Nations; it is notoriously violated, in Favour and Pre∣ference of the Emperor's Subjects.</P>
<P>It is further to be observed, that with regard to the Articles of Commerce between <HI>Spain, Eng∣land,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> the <HI>Liberty</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> of entring into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ports, was al∣ways expresly restrained to the <HI>Ports</HI> of <HI>Europe.</HI> But no such <HI>Restriction</HI> is once mentioned in the late <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Vienna,</HI> with regard to the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Subjects. Nay, <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Privileges</HI> allowed to <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> are in express Words allowed to <HI>these;</HI> with∣out
<PB N="68" REF="002880_0067_0FE685C2B86BF840"/>so much as an Exception to the <HI>South-Sea∣Ship,</HI> and the <HI>Assiento Contract:</HI> Whereas in the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht</HI> with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that Exception was expressly made. Thus has the King of <HI>Spain</HI> granted <HI>all</HI> our Privileges, and greater, to the <HI>Sub∣jects</HI> of the <HI>Emperor;</HI> and instead of <HI>protecting Great Britain,</HI> and the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> in their <HI>Rights</HI> of <HI>Commerce,</HI> according to former Treaties, he has now declared himself to be obliged and determined to protect, by Force, the <HI>Emperor</HI> and his <HI>Subjects,</HI> in their <HI>Invasion</HI> of those Rights. And, from all this put together, it must be as evident, as <HI>Words</HI> and <HI>Facts</HI> compared can make any thing, That the <HI>Two Courts</HI> of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Ma∣drid</HI> have founded their <HI>New Alliance,</HI> as far as it respects <HI>Trade,</HI> on the Destruction of all publick <HI>Faith,</HI> the <HI>Infraction</HI> of Treaties, and the <HI>Violation</HI> of all that can hold together <HI>Nations</HI> in Peace, and mutual Benevolence.</P>
<P>After so plain a Proof of the great <HI>Injustice</HI> of the Attempt of the <HI>Imperial Court</HI> upon <HI>Trade,</HI> from the <HI>Spanish Netherlands;</HI> and of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s determined Encouragement of it: It would not be improper here, to consider at some length, the <HI>Importance</HI> and <HI>Consequence</HI> of this Conduct to <HI>our selves;</HI> were it not that This has been set in so strong a Light already, as to make it much less necessary; and particularly, in a <HI>short Treatise,</HI> In∣titled, <HI>The Importance of the Ostend Company consider∣ed.</HI> Yet, before I pass from this Subject, I must mention some few particular Consequences of this new Establishment at <HI>Ostend,</HI> and of the <HI>new Treaty</HI> of <HI>Commerce</HI> (by which so large Privileges are granted to the Subjects of the <HI>Netherlands</HI>)
<PB N="69" REF="002880_0068_0FE685BB9224ED90"/>with regard to our <HI>Trade;</HI> and in the end to our <HI>Liberties,</HI> and our <HI>Religion,</HI> themselves.</P>
<P>The <HI>United Provinces,</HI> it is plain from their whole Conduct, esteem themselves undone in their main Concern, if this <HI>Company</HI> be supported. And if <HI>They</HI> are undone in <HI>their Trade,</HI> it is well known to all, who are acquainted with the <HI>Track</HI> of <HI>Merchandize,</HI> that the Gain of their Loss in Trade will not accrue to <HI>England,</HI> but fly to those Countries where this Evil began. As to the <HI>East∣India Trade</HI> particularly; the same <HI>Rival,</HI> which ruines That in <HI>Holland,</HI> must by the same Me∣thods inevitably ruine it in <HI>England.</HI> Nay, it must ruine it sooner and more effectually here: Not only because <HI>Holland</HI> has the sole Property of the <HI>Spice</HI> Trade, besides other Advantages; but because the <HI>Dutch Merchandizes</HI> are free from the Burthen of <HI>Customs;</HI> whilst our <HI>Customs</HI> give the greatest Encouragement to the <HI>Ostenders</HI> to run, and put off, a multitude of their Goods in <HI>England.</HI> The Damage and Ruine must be the same, as to our <HI>West-India</HI> Trade, from the <HI>Privi∣leges</HI> granted by the <HI>Vienna Treaty</HI> of <HI>Commerce</HI> to the Emperor's Subjects: The <HI>Privilege</HI> of <HI>en∣tring</HI> into the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ports in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and by unavoidable Consequence, of trading there, where neither <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> are ever permitted to enter upon any <HI>pretence;</HI> and the <HI>comprehensive Privilege</HI> of enjoying all Rights which <HI>Britain</HI> en∣joys, without any <HI>Exception;</HI> and, by Conse∣quence, of interfering with, and hurting, not on∣ly our <HI>Assiento Contract,</HI> but <HI>every Instance</HI> of <HI>Com∣merce</HI> with <HI>Spain,</HI> which we have a Right to by repeated <HI>Treaties.</HI></P>
<PB N="70" REF="002880_0069_0FE686495C54B750"/>
<P>Nor can the Evil stop here, but must of Ne∣cessity insinuate it self into many other of the most important Branches of our <HI>Trade,</HI> which have a mutual and indossolvible Connexion one with another. The convenient Situation of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI> between the <HI>North</HI> and the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> for all the Purposes of an extend∣ed Trade:— The Advantage of the Ports of <HI>Ostend</HI> and <HI>Newport,</HI> which, though none of the <HI>best,</HI> yet may vye with those of <HI>Holland;</HI> and will be as convenient Harbours for <HI>Privateers,</HI> as ever <HI>Dunkirk</HI> it self was, when the time shall come for an avowed and forcible Interruption to <HI>Our</HI> Trade and that of <HI>Holland:</HI> The Goodness of their <HI>Ri∣vers</HI> for communicating all <HI>Merchandizes,</HI> at the most easy Rates, from Town to Town, and the later Addition of several large <HI>Canals</HI> &amp; <HI>Causeways,</HI> where the Rivers are wanting:— The Fruit∣fulness of the Country, and the easy Price of all Provisions, very advantagious to all Manufactu∣rers:— The <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> of the <HI>Towns,</HI> which still subsist; very inviting to the same <HI>Manufacturers:</HI>— The <HI>Genius</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> very well fitted for all the <HI>Improvements</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI> and Manufactures:— And, to animate them, the Experience and History of past Times, which will shew them, that they have formerly, with a little Encouragement from their Governours, flourished in <HI>Manufactures</HI> both <HI>Woollen</HI> and <HI>Linen,</HI> besides those many which they still retain) the <HI>Woollen</HI> now again reviving to a Degree of Good∣ness at <HI>Limbourg,</HI> so as already to under-sell the <HI>Dutch</HI> themselves; and the <HI>Linnen</HI> more easily re∣vived by the Advantage of the great Quantity

These, and many more Parti∣culars shew, that, as one Branch of <HI>Trade</HI> leads to <HI>another,</HI> and one Trial encourages <HI>another;</HI> and as all <HI>Commerce</HI> is of a spreading and commu∣nicative Nature, where it meets with proper <HI>Materials,</HI> and proper <HI>Encouragement;</HI> so this must probably be the Case, if the <HI>Beginnings</HI> of <HI>Evil</HI> be not looked after: That not only our own <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-India</HI> Trade, and that of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> will be ruined by the <HI>Ostend</HI> Company, which will be the immediate <HI>Effect</HI> of it; (or rather is so <HI>already</HI> in a great Degree) but also, that the <HI>Con∣tagion</HI> will spread to many other <HI>Branches</HI> of the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade; and convey along with it the <HI>Riches,</HI> the <HI>Strength,</HI> and the <HI>Naval</HI> Power, to the same <HI>Spanish Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>But were it so, that <HI>Holland</HI> alone would be the Sufferer by the <HI>Ostend</HI> Trade (which is far from being the Case) yet the Ruine of <HI>Holland</HI> must carry along with it, in the end, the Ruine of <HI>Britain.</HI> For, as these two Nations, remaining United, are indeed the <HI>Turn</HI> of the Ballance of
<PB N="72" REF="002880_0071_0FE686731B81DEC0"/><HI>Europe,</HI> whenever they join themselves to any other great Power of <HI>Europe;</HI> and <HI>Both</HI> of them together, but barely sufficient for this Purpose: Whatever ruines the <HI>Trade,</HI> that is, the Riches and Strength of <HI>these,</HI> destroys at the same time the Evenness of that Ballance, which alone can keep <HI>Europe</HI> in any tolerable Order. And what∣ever Ruines any <HI>One</HI> of these <HI>Powers,</HI> does as truly destroy the sufficiency of that <HI>Strength,</HI> by which alone that <HI>Ballance</HI> is preserved. And what then must be the Consequence? <HI>Where</HI> the <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Riches</HI> of these, or either of these, settle, <HI>there</HI> settles the <HI>Power</HI> with them; and that <HI>Power</HI> re∣moved from <HI>them,</HI> must be the <HI>Destruction</HI> of the <HI>Ballance;</HI> and the Destruction of that <HI>Ballance,</HI> must be the <HI>loss</HI> of the <HI>Liberties</HI> of the <HI>rest</HI> of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and particularly, as Occasion shall offer, of the Liberties of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>And I need not add, that the same <HI>Popish Power,</HI> which will gain all this <HI>Strength,</HI> (for it is in a <HI>Po∣pish Power</HI> that all this must Centre,) will have the same <HI>Strength,</HI> and a greater <HI>Will,</HI> to extirpate every Appearance of <HI>Protestantism,</HI> of what Denomination soever, out of <HI>Europe;</HI> without Exception to any one Church above another: Only with the fatal <HI>Exception</HI> of a more sure and quick Blow <HI>to that Church,</HI> a great part of whose Revenues, as well as the Riches of a Multitude of its <HI>Members,</HI> arise from the <HI>Dissolution</HI> of <HI>Monasteries,</HI> and the <HI>Aliena∣tion</HI> of <HI>Abbey-Lands;</HI> and whose unpardonable <HI>Crime</HI> it will be, to have been the great Support of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and the <HI>Bulwark</HI> of the <HI>Prote∣stant</HI> Cause against <HI>Popery.</HI> For where can that <HI>Church,</HI> or where can the <HI>Protestant Religion,</HI> hope,
<PB N="73" REF="002880_0072_0FE68673886A4FE8"/>I will not say, for <HI>Countenance,</HI> but for <HI>Sufferance;</HI> when the whole <HI>Protestant Power</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> which in its present Condition, is little better than a Creature with Pain and Difficulty struggling for Life, shall be broken to Pieces by Acquisitions, made by other Powers, of Riches and Force: Ac∣quisitions, which will be a double Strength a∣gainst it, as they are taken from Those who alone have a Will to protect it, and added to Those who have a Zeal to hurt and oppress it. And that <HI>this</HI> must be the <HI>End</HI> of such <HI>Beginnings,</HI> suffered to proceed with Success, and gathering Strength eve∣ry Step they go, is as plain, and as true, as, That <HI>proper Food</HI> will give <HI>Strength</HI> gradually to the <HI>weakest Man,</HI> capable of receiving it; too great to be resisted at last by the <HI>strongest Man,</HI> who suffers it to be taken from <HI>himself;</HI> and who by that Loss of <HI>Nourishment</HI> grows <HI>weaker</HI> and <HI>weak∣er,</HI> as well as by the Strength added by it to the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>I will now say a Word more peculiarly relating to <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and the <HI>Concern</HI> this Nation has, in its present Circumstances, in the <HI>Fate</HI> of its <HI>Trade,</HI> or of <HI>any</HI> of the Branches of it. The two last <HI>Wars</HI> abroad, upon which not only our own Safety, but that of the <HI>Liberties</HI> of all <HI>Europe,</HI> de∣pended, and by which they were preserved; to∣gether with the continual Attempts of our Ene∣mies, since the general Peace, to load us with the Chains of <HI>Popery</HI> and the <HI>Pretender,</HI> have run <HI>Great Britain</HI> into a vast <HI>Expence:</HI> and this Expence has left behind it an immense <HI>Debt;</HI> and this <HI>Debt,</HI> so justly due to the <HI>Creditors</HI> of the <HI>Publick,</HI> must be paid, both out of strict Duty, if there be any such
<PB N="74" REF="002880_0073_0FE6867C9ADEE030"/>thing as <HI>publick Justice,</HI> and out of <HI>Interest,</HI> if we have a Mind ever again, in any <HI>Extremity,</HI> to be trusted. This lies as a great and heavy Burthen upon the Minds of all true Lovers of their Coun∣try: And, I know, that for the sake of this single Point, and from their earnest desire of seeing so great a Good accomplished, without any Inter∣ruptions, Many of the best Friends to the <HI>Publick</HI> are ready to regret any Opposition made to the Designs of this <HI>New Alliance,</HI> as the first Step to a <HI>War;</HI> and to ask, How much better, to bear the Inconveniencies mentioned; to submit to the Loss of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> to be contented with all the Con∣sequences of the <HI>Ostend Trade;</HI> to connive at all the Designs of such Powers united; than to put any Stop to our Prospect of a gradual Payment of our Debts?—Our main Business, they argue, is to free our selves from that Load. The <HI>sinking</HI> Fund is a good Beginning; and, if not hindred by Quarrels with Powers abroad, must go on to di∣minish our Debt. This Payment of our Debt, we should look after, as our Strength in future Times, and our greatest Force against our <HI>Ene∣mies;</HI> and not shew our selves so concerned about the Points just now mentioned.</P>
<P>On the other Side, I cannot help entirely dif∣fering from all this. Nay, I cannot forbear to urge this very <HI>Opposition</HI> to the <HI>New Alliance,</HI> as the only certain Method of taking any one Step farther towards this great Good; as so absolutely necessary, that <HI>without it,</HI> there is an End of all Hope of it. And I contend for the most <HI>vigorous Opposition</HI> to the Designs of this <HI>New Alliance,</HI> for this very Reason, because we are in Debt; and
<PB N="75" REF="002880_0074_0FE6868E8E9CB130"/>must be for ever in Debt; and shall never pro∣bably have it in our power to pay any <HI>Part</HI> more of that <HI>Debt,</HI> if those Designs go on unopposed and unresisted.</P>
<P>For in the first Place, They who argue against it, from this Consideration, leave out a <HI>main Point;</HI> and a Point which comprehends all other Evils in it and that is, the <HI>continued Attempts</HI> of put∣ting the <HI>Pretender</HI> upon us: Which must succeed, unless we shew our selves determined to oppose any Power engaged in Support of such Designs. And if this <HI>one thing</HI> succeeds, it is of small Im∣portance to our <HI>Debt,</HI> what our Trade will be after this is effected. Every one can see that a Debt, contracted in order to keep out <HI>Him</HI> and his <HI>Family</HI> for ever, will never be paid, but by <HI>one universal Blot</HI> spread over the Face of the whole Accompt; if <HI>He</HI> should ever be settled here, against whom this <HI>Debt</HI> has raised Armies, and mann'd Fleets, and faught many successful Battles. What Good therefore, towards the Pay∣ment of our Debt, will a supine Negligence do? or what Account can the <HI>Creditors</HI> of the <HI>Publick</HI> hope to find, from not opposing an Alliance which may otherwise too probably end in the establishing a <HI>King</HI> here, under whom the least Evil will be this, That the Creditors of the Pub∣lick will be sure of losing at once their whole just <HI>Debt,</HI> and the <HI>Interest</HI> of it?</P>
<P>But, putting the <HI>Pretender</HI> wholly out of the <HI>Question,</HI> as a Person not in Being; Or, supposing our selves secure from every future Attempt in his Favour: yet, the <HI>Case</HI> with Respect to the Pay∣ment of the <HI>Debt,</HI> must very soon be the same;
<PB N="76" REF="002880_0075_0FE6866902298338"/>(however it may happily differ <HI>in many</HI> other Par∣ticulars) if the Conditions of these <HI>New Treaties</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> both <HI>Publick</HI> and <HI>Private,</HI> are, through our supine Negligence, suffer'd to be fulfilled. For, what is the <HI>sinking Fund</HI> from which we hope for Relief? It is the <HI>Surplus</HI> of the <HI>Produce</HI> of the <HI>Customs</HI> and <HI>Excises,</HI> after the Payment of the <HI>Ci∣vil List,</HI> and of the <HI>Interest</HI> of the <HI>National Debt.</HI> These <HI>Customs</HI> are the <HI>Appurtenances</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Commerce.</HI> Take away <HI>any</HI> Part of this <HI>Trade,</HI> or diminish it in any Branch; just so much in Pro∣portion you diminish or take away from these <HI>Customs.</HI> The first thing therefore, that must feel the <HI>Diminution</HI> of our <HI>Trade,</HI> is the Produce of our <HI>Customs;</HI> and the first thing that must feel the Di∣minution of our <HI>Customs,</HI> is the <HI>Sinking Fund:</HI> be∣cause the <HI>Civil List</HI> and the <HI>Interest</HI> of the <HI>Natio∣nal Debt</HI> must first be paid, before <HI>any Surplus</HI> at all can be laid apart for the <HI>Payment</HI> of the <HI>Princi∣pal.</HI> Let therefore your Trade decay; permit the <HI>New Company</HI> at <HI>Ostend,</HI> to make your own <HI>East∣</HI> and <HI>West-India</HI> Trade utterly impracticable; and suffer your own <HI>Commerce</HI> to be by Degrees trans∣planted, and to flourish, in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> un∣der the Advantages and Encouragements in those Parts just now mentioned; besides the <HI>Prohibitions</HI> upon your own <HI>Manufactures</HI> every Day increas∣ing upon you: and this alone will immediately prevent any such <HI>Surplusage</HI> from remaining. For what Need of Words? As <HI>Customs</HI> are the <HI>Appen∣dages</HI> of <HI>Trade,</HI> they must decay with it: As the <HI>Sinking Fund</HI> depends entirely on the Abundance of <HI>Customs,</HI> this must <HI>first</HI> vanish upon their De∣crease. What then must immediately become of
<PB N="77" REF="002880_0076_0FE686718E98FFE0"/>he <HI>principal Debt?</HI> And indeed, very soon after his, what must become even of the <HI>Interest</HI> of it: when the <HI>Customs,</HI> which are the <HI>Fund</HI> for the Yearly Payment of that <HI>Interst,</HI> are themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anish'd away? And I will add, never after <HI>this</HI> to be recalled again.</P>
<P>For here is the real Difference between the <HI>two Methods</HI> of proceeding, now under our Conside∣ration. <HI>First,</HI> as to that of vigorous Opposition <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Measures of the <HI>New Alliance;</HI> if we should allow to Those who thus argue against it, that it may possibly bring on, in its natural Course, an <HI>Interruption</HI> to Trade, and a <HI>Diminution</HI> of Cus∣toms; and consequently a Stop to that Payment of the <HI>National Debt</HI> which depends upon the a∣bundance of these <HI>Customs:</HI> Yet, this is but a <HI>Temporary Stop.</HI> If these vigorous Measures meet with Success, and the Blessing of Providence at∣tend upon them, the Course of Trade opens it∣self again with Vigour; and, the Customs reviv∣ing in Proportion, the <HI>Sinking Fund</HI> must of Ne∣cessity do so too. And if this Method of <HI>Vigorous Opposition</HI> should not be successful; the Case could not be worse than it must be without it. For in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te other <HI>Method;</HI> That of Supine Negligence, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad of yielding to all Demands without the At∣tenpt of any Relief; our Conduct has but <HI>one cetain Event</HI> possible, as to the Point now before us. The <HI>Sinking Fund</HI> must, with the Decrease of the <HI>Customs,</HI> vanish immediately: and so must, soon after it, the Annual Interest of our Debt. And then, the <HI>longer</HI> the <HI>Ostend</HI> Company con∣tinue; its Commerce, the <HI>stronger</HI> and more ex∣tended must it grow; and the more extended that
<PB N="78" REF="002880_0077_0FE68671ABED4CE0"/>is, the more confined must our <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-In∣dia</HI> Commerce be, in all their Branches, till they dwindle into nothing; and the more the <HI>Sweet</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI> are tasted in the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI> and the <HI>Austrian</HI> Countries too, the more improbable or rather impossible it will be, ever to recall it into these Parts, upon any such <HI>Terms</HI> as can make the <HI>Customs,</HI> once ruined, revive in <HI>England.</HI> In a Word, in <HI>one</HI> Way, the Diminution of the National <HI>Debt</HI> may be interrupted by a vigorous <HI>Opposition</HI> to the Measures abroad: but then will revive again, and go on in its proper Channel<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In the <HI>other</HI> Way, the same <HI>Diminution,</HI> and Loss of the Means of paying the <HI>Debt,</HI> and even the <HI>Interest</HI> of it, will be the Fate of this Nation and that, with this <HI>unhappy</HI> Aggravation; that if the Loss comes <HI>this Way,</HI> it is never to be re∣triev'd; nor any Hope left of that Payment so the future.</P>
<P>As others therefore are moved by a Regard to this great Good to the Nation, to be averse to a Methods of <HI>vigorous</HI> Opposition; I cannot help being moved by the same Regard, the very con∣trary Way: and what They <HI>fear,</HI> because we have such a <HI>Debt</HI> upon us, which ought to be paid; that I <HI>wish,</HI> for the same Reason, because we are in Debt; and that <HI>Debt</HI> ought to be paid; and that Debt cannot be paid without such an <HI>Opo∣sition</HI> as may preserve our Commerce upon a <HI>Fan∣dation</HI> granted to it by the most solemn <HI>Treties,</HI> the only <HI>Purchase</HI> of the <HI>Toil</HI> and <HI>Expence</HI> of <HI>Bri∣tain;</HI> and such a <HI>Foundation,</HI> as alone can enable us to go on in a gradual Justice to the <HI>Creditors</HI> of the Publick.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="002880_0078_0FE6867B5804F4D0"/>
And in such a Method of proceeding, This ought to be our great Support and Confidence, that it is not an arbitrary Contention against the Rights of any other Nation in the World; nor a Contest of our Trade, merely as our great Ad∣vantage, or as the Instrument of paying the Na∣tional <HI>Debt,</HI> and securing the National Happiness; but really and truly a Contention for our strict Right and Due, invaded with an high Hand by other Powers, against the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Treaties,</HI> as well as the Force of the highest Obligations. Nor can we conceive a more abject Servility of Conduct, than for a <HI>People</HI> so long fam'd for <HI>Com∣merce</HI> and <HI>Bravery,</HI> to see their <HI>Darling Good,</HI> and peculiar Glory; the Pledge of their <HI>Liberty,</HI> and Life of all their Property, just going to be forci∣bly and unrighteously torn from them; and tame∣ly to look on without <HI>one Struggle</HI> for so great a Blessing, or one hearty Effort against the Inva∣ders of it. What can we become, if we give our Consent to such Ruine by our own supine Indolence and Insensibility; and suffer our selves to be stripp'd of our boasted Strength and Orna∣ment at once; but a Nation, the most despicable of all Nations under Heaven; exposed to the Contempt and Insults of the World about us here <HI>below,</HI> and render'd utterly unworthy, by our own Conduct, of the Care of Providence <HI>above us?</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. After all this said upon the Consequence of this <HI>New Alliance,</HI> with a particular Respect to the <HI>Protestant</HI> Establishment, the <HI>Possessions,</HI> and the <HI>Commerce,</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> it will be very proper now to touch upon another <HI>Article</HI> of the <HI>Secret</HI> Part of it, in which, not only <HI>Britain,</HI> but
<PB N="80" REF="002880_0079_0FE6867B756B6A40"/>all <HI>Europe</HI> in general, is extremely concern'd: I mean the <HI>Marriages</HI> agreed upon, between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> which, added to the <HI>compre∣hensive</HI> and <HI>extended Trade</HI> now likely to be trans∣planted into the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> must constitute a Power in <HI>one Family</HI> beyond all that we have known, Formidable and Irrisistible. The <HI>Mar∣riages</HI> I speak of, are <HI>those</HI> of the two <HI>Arch Dutch∣esses, Daughters</HI> to the present <HI>Emperor,</HI> with the two <HI>Infants</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> Sons to the <HI>King</HI> by his pre∣sent <HI>Queen.</HI> And that these are agreed upon, as a main and essential Point in this <HI>New Alliance,</HI> We have the following Proofs.</P>
<P N="2">1. Immediately after the Signing the <HI>Publick Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> at <HI>Vienna, Ripperda</HI> very freely talk'd of the <HI>Marriage</HI> of <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> the <HI>eldest</HI> Son of the present Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> with the <HI>eldest Arch Dutchess,</HI> as a fixt Matter; and that the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Asturias</HI> was disregarded in this <HI>Alliance,</HI> because of his ill Health, as he pretended at that Time: and a little while after, he spake as open∣ly and positively about the <HI>Marriages,</HI> both of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> and his <HI>Brother.</HI> One of his Conver∣sations was very Remarkable, and full of such <HI>Circumstances</HI> as will not let Us doubt of the <HI>Truth</HI> of the Subject of it.
<Q>The King's <HI>Ministers</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the whole <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation, (<HI>says He</HI>) are bitter against me: but I laugh at all that. The <HI>Queen</HI> will protect me. I have done <HI>her</HI> such Services that <HI>she</HI> can't abandon me: for thus the Matter stands. The <HI>Proposals</HI> of the <HI>Imperial Court</HI> were of a <HI>Marriage</HI> with the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Asturias,</HI> and my first <HI>Instructions</HI> from <HI>Spain</HI> were for the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Asturias;</HI> but it was I,
<PB N="81" REF="002880_0080_0FE6865DCD7F17E8"/>who got that Destination chang'd. I wrote to the <HI>Queen</HI> to engage the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Asturias,</HI> with∣out Delay, to a Daughter of <HI>Portugal,</HI> that he might not stand in the Way of <HI>Don Carlos:</HI> And it was I that found the Way of turning all this Affair to the Advantage of her <HI>two Sons.</HI> And do you think I have much to Fear after such Services?</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. This agrees exactly with the Language of the Court of <HI>Madrid:</HI> Where, after the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> was known to be Sign'd at <HI>Vienna,</HI> this Al∣liance with the <HI>Emperor</HI> was freely spoke of, as the <HI>Queen</HI>'s own <HI>Transaction</HI> entirely; enter'd into, and conducted by <HI>herself;</HI> and the <HI>Marriage</HI> of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> spoke of, at first, without reserve or Appearance of Secrecy, as a Matter agreed upon. Nor did any <HI>one</HI> Person, who frequented the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> make the least Doubt of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. This will help us to Account for other Parts of the <HI>Conduct</HI> of <HI>Spain:</HI> which, without this, will be wholly unaccountable, and out of the Road of all Policy. For instance, Suppose only these <HI>Marriages,</HI> or That alone of <HI>Don Carlos</HI> with the <HI>eldest Arch Dutchess;</HI> and this will shew us, Why that Court could be brought to discard the <HI>Neutral Garrisons,</HI> and all other <HI>Securities</HI> furnish'd by the <HI>Quadruple</HI> Alliance for the <HI>Establishing</HI> her Son, the same <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> and to trust to the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s naked Word in so great a Point: <HI>viz.</HI> Because by this <HI>Marriage</HI> it would come about, that the <HI>Emperor,</HI> by securing those <HI>Dominions</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> for <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> would secure them, at the same Time, for the <HI>Issue</HI> of his own <HI>Daughter;</HI> and so must of Necessity, for the Sake of his
<PB N="82" REF="002880_0081_0FE68668DEA63CB8"/>own Interest, and the aggrandizing his own Fa∣mily, be sincere and zealous in this Affair. On the other Side, the same Supposition of this <HI>Mar∣riage</HI> gives a reasonable Solution, Why the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> has consented to, what the <HI>Spanish Mini∣sters</HI> at the <HI>Congress</HI> would not hear of, the <HI>Guaran∣ty</HI> of the <HI>Succession</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> as lately establish'd in the House of <HI>Austria: viz.</HI> Because it comes about by this Marriage, that being <HI>Guarantee</HI> to the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s <HI>Succession</HI> in his <HI>Austrian Dominions,</HI> is no more than being <HI>Guarantee</HI> for the Queen's own Son <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> the future Husband of the <HI>eldest Arch Dutchess;</HI> and that <HI>Self Interest</HI> must make <HI>Spain,</HI> under its present Administration, sin∣cere in this <HI>Guaranty.</HI> And upon any other Bot∣tom, we may safely defy the World to give a So∣lution of <HI>these</HI> and <HI>several</HI> other Appearances, in this New Alliance.</P>
<P>I need not go farther, and appeal to any Words that may have been dropp'd in Confidence, at the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> itself, upon the Subject of these Marriages; and that, with a particular Pleasure and Satisfaction express'd in them, Since we have so much, and so strong, Evidence of the Reality of it, from the Mouth of <HI>Ripperda,</HI> who made the Treaty; and from the Language of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> itself; as well as from the utter In∣consistency and Unaccountableness of the proceed∣ings of that Court, without this Supposition.</P>
<P>I acknowledge indeed, That at <HI>Vienna,</HI> when it began to appear that what had been said upon this Head had allarm'd <HI>Europe;</HI> and when, in par∣ticular, the great Aim was to keep the <HI>Dutch</HI> from acceding to the Treaty of <HI>Hanover;</HI> which
<PB N="83" REF="002880_0082_0FE6865965B76158"/>might be hasten'd by so terrible an Appearance: Then, the whole Affair of these <HI>Marriages</HI> was utterly disown'd; nay, in Order to deny these <HI>Marriages,</HI> it was absolutely denied that there was any such Thing in Being, as a <HI>secret Treaty</HI> be∣tween the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I am not afraid of relating <HI>this,</HI> after all the Proofs before given of the <HI>Reality</HI> of a <HI>secret Treaty,</HI> and of this <HI>Article</HI> in it; nor at all unwilling that it should work as much as it can, and have all the Weight it ought to have: For I am confident, that, as this Conduct convinced not one Person at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and made not the least <HI>Impression</HI> upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Minister, or his <HI>Masters;</HI> so it will make no Im∣pression upon Any who have read what I have before laid down, unless it be this, That they who can act an unjustifiable part, can, without Scruple, and with the same Ease, bring them∣selves to a peremptory and absolute Denial of it, till the proper Time comes for their open Avowal of it.</P>
<P>But as this <HI>Article</HI> of these <HI>Marriages</HI> must re∣main undoubted; we cannot help spending a few Thoughts upon the <HI>Consequences</HI> of them, or of the first of <HI>them</HI> only. There is but <HI>one</HI> Life, that of the Prince of <HI>Asturias,</HI> between <HI>Don Carlos</HI> and the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> after the Death of the present <HI>King.</HI> There is only the same Life between <HI>Don Carlos</HI> and the Crown of <HI>France;</HI> should the pre∣sent King there dye without <HI>Issue Male;</HI> and the <HI>Renunciations</HI> not take place: both which Events may happen.</P>
<P>And as to the vast Hereditary Dominions of the House of <HI>Austria, Don Carlos</HI> will come to them
<PB N="84" REF="002880_0083_0FE68653584C2760"/>by Right of his Wife. And as Experience has shewn us, for many Ages, that whoever is Master of these Dominions, and the Power that attends them, has been, and must be <HI>Emperor,</HI> notwithstanding its be∣ing an Elective Crown: <HI>Don Carlos,</HI> by marrying the <HI>eldest Arch Dutchess,</HI> cannot sail of being <HI>Empe∣ror.</HI> So that <HI>Don Carlos</HI> may possibly be at once, <HI>Emperor,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and King of <HI>Spain:</HI> and have the vast Strength and Riches of all these Powers united and center'd in him.</P>
<P>I have thus sufficiently shewn the many and complicated <HI>Evils</HI> of this <HI>New Alliance</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> and the just <HI>Apprehensions,</HI> and well-grounded <HI>Fears,</HI> which the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> could not but entertain, from all Ap∣pearances and all Advices, about the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Tendency</HI> of it, with Regard to the present <HI>Estab∣lishment</HI> of the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> to our <HI>Pos∣sessions;</HI> our <HI>Commerce;</HI> our <HI>Religion;</HI> our <HI>Liberties,</HI> and those of all <HI>Europe;</HI> and, in a Word, to every <HI>Thing</HI> that ought to be Dear to Us. And now, Let any Persons amongst us, who know how to prize these <HI>inestimable Goods,</HI> which alone make <HI>Life</HI> itself valuable, survey this <HI>New Alliance</HI> in e∣very Part of it: and judge, <Q>Whether ever hi∣therto <HI>any one Scheme</HI> has appear'd in <HI>Europe,</HI> of a Destruction so universal, and of a Ruine so extended, as <HI>This</HI> (taking the whole together) appears plainly to be.</Q></P>
<P>It is time now for us to enquire, What has been the Conduct of the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> upon the View of all these Evils.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first step they took was to renew, by a Treaty, the Defensive Engagements subsisting
<PB N="85" REF="002880_0084_0FE6866772235B90"/>between <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Prussia.</HI> But this Treaty was not set on foot till some Months after the <HI>New Alliance</HI> between the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> and after the best Intelligences, and most mature Consideration, of the <HI>Tendency</HI> of that <HI>Al∣liance.</HI> And as this <HI>Treaty,</HI> made at <HI>Hanover,</HI> has long been publick in the World; I need not ob∣serve that it is a <HI>Treaty</HI> entirely <HI>Defensive</HI> between <HI>Britain, France</HI> and <HI>Prussia,</HI> for the mutual support of each other, against Injuries; and not at all for the invading, or injuring, any Nation under Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. Particular Regard was shewn to the <HI>States General,</HI> in the framing of the Treaty of <HI>Hanover:</HI> to which they have since acceded. The next care was to invite the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> into this Al∣liance; that Kingdom having so often and so suc∣cessfully appeared in Defence of the Protestant Religion, and of the Liberties of Europe. And the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse-Cassel,</HI> whose Family has done such signal Service to the Protestant Cause, readily offer'd a good Body of Troops, in sup∣port of this Alliance.</P>
<P>These are the Steps which the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> thought fit to take as soon as possible, af∣ter the Danger we were in, appeared evident be∣yond all contradiction.</P>
<P N="3">3. As the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> found their Country immediately threatn'd in its great∣est Concerns from these Treaties of <HI>Vienna;</HI> Both Houses gave his <HI>Majesty</HI> all <HI>Assurance</HI> of support in whatever He should think fit to do in the present critical Conjuncture. And accordingly it was ne∣cessary now to consider in earnest, what was most proper to be done. The Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="002880_0085_0FE68681861D0870"/>had evident Proof that nothing could influence the Two <HI>New Allies</HI> to Terms of Reason, but to shew a <HI>vigorous Spirit</HI> against every pernicious or suspicious part of such an Alliance. And as all Appearances, in all parts, convinced them, That nothing could so effectually guard against ap∣proaching Evils, as the dispatching sufficient <HI>Squadrons</HI> of <HI>Ships</HI> to several Places; and as they were sensible that our <HI>Fleet,</HI> now the best in the World, could never be of any Account, either towards our <HI>Glory</HI> or our <HI>Safety,</HI> but upon such an Occasion; They did, with all possible Diligence, fit out <HI>Three Squadrons</HI> of <HI>Men of War:</HI> One for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> One for the Coasts of <HI>Spain,</HI> and One for the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P>It will now be ask'd, as it has been indeed al∣ready, What beneficial <HI>Effect</HI> has this <HI>Method</HI> had? What Good have we gain'd, or what Evil have we prevented, by these Grand Appearances of our <HI>Fleets</HI> abroad? And if an Answer may be reasonably expected, by Those who ask these and the like <HI>Questions;</HI> so is it also a just Expectation, That, They should be as ready to receive a Rea∣sonable Answer to them, as they are to ask them.</P>
<P>As to the Treaty of <HI>Hanover;</HI> I will suppose, no <HI>Apology</HI> can be expected for <HI>That,</HI> after such a surprizing and formidable Conjunction of the <HI>Two Powers</HI> of the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> the Design, and the <HI>Articles</HI> of which <HI>Conjunction</HI> appear'd every Day more and more terrible to their <HI>Neighbours.</HI> The Contracting Parties in the <HI>Hanover</HI> Treaty must have been taxed with <HI>Infatuation</HI> and <HI>Insensi∣bility,</HI> beyond the common Pitch of <HI>Those Evils,</HI> if They had not enter'd into a <HI>strict</HI> and <HI>hearty</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="002880_0086_0FE6868EACD16768"/>Concert for their own <HI>Self-Defence,</HI> in such Cir∣cumstances, of present Invasion of the <HI>Trade</HI> of <HI>some</HI> of them; and of Forebodings of <HI>future</HI> Evil to them All.</P>
<P>But as the Question here at home, chiefly, if not solely, refers to our Naval <HI>Armaments</HI> from <HI>England;</HI> What have They produced, or, for what Reasons were they sent? The Answer is very plain. As to the Squadron sent to the <HI>West∣Indies;</HI> I believe there is no one who has an Estate in those Parts, or is concern'd in any Trade thi∣ther, who did not think it highly necessary to have a Strong Squadron in those Seas, for secur∣ing our Commerce; which must otherwise have been inevitably ruined, by the Depredations and Violences committed by the Spaniards for several Years past without Redress. And if the sending of the said Squadron has prevented the Return of the Galleons: no Man who is in the least conver∣sant in the Affairs of Europe, can make any doubt but that this Incident has been the only Thing that has hitherto prevented a War in Europe, by depriving the Courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Madrid</HI> of the means of putting in execution the dangerous Schemes they had projected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Squadron</HI> sent to the Coasts of <HI>Spain,</HI> was sent to prevent any Attempt from that Country, to disturb Us at Home: The Court of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> being assured, beyond all doubt, as I have before particularly related, that an <HI>Offensive Treaty</HI> was concluded at <HI>Vienna;</HI> and that an Attempt was design'd from <HI>Spain,</HI> and preparations mak∣ing for it, at that Time, in Favour of the <HI>Pre∣tender.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="002880_0087_0FE646173948E6D8"/>
And the <HI>Squadron</HI> sent to the <HI>Baltick</HI> was sent to prevent very great Evils in those Parts; there be∣ing no room to doubt, that the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s real View was to go with a Fleet directly to <HI>Stockholm,</HI> and under a Pretence of demanding the Use of the Ports, and the Assistance of <HI>Sweden</HI> for the Reco∣very of <HI>Sleswick</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> actually to dethrone the present King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and make that Nation absolutely dependent on <HI>Mus∣covy.</HI> It was therefore judg'd of the utmost Im∣portance to prevent this, by sending a strong Squadron into the <HI>Baltick;</HI> not only as it was the preserving a Friendly <HI>Power,</HI> and a <HI>Power</HI> Ne∣cessary to the <HI>Balance</HI> of the <HI>North:</HI> but particu∣larly, because <HI>Sweden</HI> could not but be consider'd in the Nature of a Frontier and Barrier to <HI>Britain</HI> itself, to such a Degree, that if that <HI>Ringdom</HI> were once either made subject to <HI>Russia,</HI> or De∣pendent upon it, <HI>Britain</HI> itself must be in Ap∣prehension of Attempts from the <HI>Russian Ravagers,</HI> coming with their Fleet from <HI>Gottenburg</HI> to our <HI>Northern</HI> Coasts: an Evil not to be guarded a∣gainst, after the Subjection of <HI>Sweden,</HI> but by the <HI>Expence,</HI> either of a constant <HI>Fleet</HI> upon those <HI>Coasts,</HI> or an <HI>Armed Force</HI> in those Parts of our County, which lie most open to such Attempts.</P>
<P>The Designs and Views in sending out these <HI>Squadrons</HI> being so unexceptionably Good; suppo∣sing that, through the <HI>Dispositions</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> and the Opposition of Winds and Weather, Suc∣cess had not attended upon any <HI>One</HI> of these Squadrons; nay, that <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Extraordinary</HI> Misfortunes had followed them all: yet, <HI>They</HI> who are not so weak as to argue from <HI>Success</HI> a∣lone;
<PB N="89" REF="002880_0088_0FE6868FDAF58128"/>They who know the Uncertainty of <HI>Seas,</HI> and <HI>Winds,</HI> and <HI>Weather,</HI> and have too much Un∣derstanding to think the <HI>Event</HI> only to be the true <HI>Criterion</HI> of Judging about the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of any Project; all Persons, I mean of good Sense, should, methinks, have been ready, even in such a Case, to have applauded what was done upon so good Grounds, and with Views so much for the Honour and Safety of their Country. But, <HI>God</HI> be thank'd, this is not the Case. Every one of the Armaments has had Success equal to the Goodness of the Errand they were all sent upon; and even, beyond Expectation. For, as to the Squadron in the <HI>West Indies;</HI> it has not only pro∣tected the Trade of His Majesty's Subjects in those Parts from the Depredations of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but also the <HI>Galeons</HI> with their Stores of Money, the <HI>Strength</HI> of the <HI>New Alliance,</HI> and the <HI>like</HI> of all the <HI>Projects</HI> concerted in it, are kept back: and those <HI>Attempts</HI> disappointed which would have been made, and perhaps succeeded, had such <HI>Riches</HI> come to their Aid. The Execution of the Schemes laid in <HI>Spain</HI> for an Invasion of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> in Favour of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> was, at that Time, prevented by the Appearance of a <HI>British</HI> Fleet upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Coasts: and all the Evils and Disorders, as well as Expence, avoided, which an Attack of that Sort must have occa∣sion'd, even supposing it repulsed from hence; and the utter Ruin and Destructon, that must have ensued, had it succeeded. And by the Squa∣dron in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> the <HI>Czarina</HI>'s whole Force of Ships and Galleys was kept in, within the Bounds of Safety to <HI>themselves</HI> and their <HI>Neighbours;</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="002880_0089_0FE6864A86D38730"/>Her destructive Designs against <HI>Sweden,</HI> with all their ill Consequences to <HI>Britain</HI> and to other Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> prevented from <HI>Execution</HI> in every Instance: and, after all the boasted Strength of the <HI>Ships</HI> and <HI>Seamen</HI> in the Service of that <HI>Crown, Russia</HI> itself, and all <HI>Europe</HI> convinc'd, that <HI>twenty British</HI> Men of <HI>War</HI> can, upon any Occa∣sion, make them disappear as if they were not, and shelter themselves in their own Ports as if they had no Views but those of Quiet und Security.</P>
<P>But here is the great Advantage to <HI>Those</HI> who make such <HI>Enquiries</HI> as these we have been now considering, without a Disposition to be satisfy'd: That <HI>Evils</HI> prevented, go for no <HI>Evils;</HI> and be∣cause they were not visibly perceiv'd by our Eyes, nor sensibly felt by our Nerves, before we find them at a greater Distance from us, therefore, They who are in the Disposition of <HI>Satyr</HI> (so much easier than <HI>Praise</HI>) will probably think themselves at <HI>Liberty</HI> to deny this <HI>Freedom</HI> from such <HI>Evils</HI> to be at all the Effect of the Measures taken; and to presist in it, that no such Evils would have come, or could have been justly fear'd, if these Methods had not been taken. And in this Manner, I own, They may talk for ever against all possible Light; if the whole <HI>Scene</HI> which I have, in the former Part of these Papers, laid before them, be not of Force enough to work another Perswasion in them. Yet, <HI>one</HI> Thing, I will affirm,
<Q>That we, and other Nations are, at present, actually free from the <HI>Evils</HI> and <HI>Attempts</HI> I have mention'd, <HI>since</HI> these <HI>vigorous Measures</HI> have shew'd them∣selves in the View of <HI>Europe;</HI> and that They them∣selves cannot say it was <HI>certain,</HI> (as others will not say, it was in the least <HI>probable</HI>) that We
<PB N="91" REF="002880_0090_0FE686550D5A55C0"/>should have been free from those Evils and those Attempts, had <HI>not</HI> these <HI>Measures</HI> been taken.</Q></P>
<P>Thus therefore, stands the Affair of these <HI>three Squadrons.</HI> They were sent upon Designs of the last Consequence, and exceedingly Honourable, to <HI>Great Britain:</HI> And they have had the Success of fully answering the Ends proposed.</P>
<P>It was not, we see, to assert the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of the <HI>Seas,</HI> merely by shewing themselves in several Parts of the World in a <HI>Form</HI> superior to that of other Nations, that these <HI>Armaments</HI> were fitted out. The asserting our <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of the <HI>Seas,</HI> as a Point of mere <HI>Speculation,</HI> at a great Expence, and without any other View, may, perhaps, be a Subject fit for Men of Wit to be pleasant with, and to entertain themselves and their Friends up∣on. But to assert the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of the <HI>Seas,</HI> as a <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>Action,</HI> upon a just Occasion: — To shew this <HI>Sovereignty</HI> in the Sight of those Nations, who are making their own Strength at <HI>Sea</HI> the Instrument of Ruine to their Neighbours: — To shew it, in Opposition to those <HI>Nations</HI> who are contriving to convey Mischief to ourselves, and Assistance to our Enemies, by the Sea itself: — If <HI>this</HI> be not the proper Business, and the peculi∣ar Glory of <HI>Britain,</HI> as the <HI>greatest Maritime Power</HI> now in <HI>Europe;</HI> then our <HI>Navy</HI> is itself a <HI>Ridicule</HI> upon ourselves; an Ostentation only, kept up at a vast Expence; and a Piece of <HI>Vanity,</HI> unwor∣thy of a <HI>Grave</HI> and <HI>Wise</HI> Nation. But no more upon this Part of the Subject.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Question</HI> will be ask'd, What has been, and must be, <HI>our Expence</HI> upon this Occasion? And it will be added, Are <HI>we</HI> alone to bear such Bur∣thens,
<PB N="92" REF="002880_0091_0FE686901EF385E0"/>without a Proportion of <HI>Expence</HI> from those who are our <HI>Allies;</HI> whilst <HI>Those</HI> whom we are opposing, seem to be at little, or none at all? To the first Branch of this <HI>Question, What is our Expence?</HI> It is certainly enough to answer in Ge∣neral, Let it be what it will; if it be necessary for <HI>our own</HI> Security, and that of <HI>Europe;</HI> if it be incurred for the Preventing the greatest <HI>Evils,</HI> and as the <HI>only Means</HI> of procuring a better State of Things: it may justly be said, to be not at all comparable to the Necessity for it; not to be put in the <HI>Balance</HI> against the <HI>Mischiefs</HI> which might have arisen from the Want of it; and very much beneath the <HI>Good</HI> which has and will come from it. The whole Point to every <HI>true Briton</HI> is, Whether it was necessary, fitting, and reason∣able: — They that think it <HI>probably</HI> so, must be pleased with it. They that think it a mere Piece of <HI>Gaiety</HI> in Those who preside; or an hasty Blun∣der in the Dark; will have other Resentments a∣bout it: But they must first <HI>think</HI> them <HI>mere Mad∣men,</HI> or <HI>mere Idiots,</HI> before they can come to this. In the mean Time, till something of this Sort ap∣pears, we cannot but think, That, if the attemp∣ting to guard ourselves and our Neighbours from very great and comprehensive <HI>Evils,</HI> be laudable; and if the preventing the Beginnings of those <HI>Evil</HI> can make an <HI>Expence</HI> necessary, fitting, and reasonable; then the <HI>Expence</HI> upon the present Occasion is certainly so.</P>
<P>But as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in general is Satisfaction enough, of whatever Sort or Degree the Expence is; pro∣vided is be a <HI>Lesser Evil</HI> than what it has hitherto kept off: so it will not be disagreeable to re∣mark,
<PB N="93" REF="002880_0092_0FE6865DED7D3BB0"/>That the <HI>Expence</HI> upon these <HI>Naval Arma∣ments</HI> is of such a Nature, and accompanied with such <HI>Circumstances,</HI> as to make it much the more tolerable in the Eyes of every <HI>Briton.</HI> The Ex∣pence is chiefly an Expence amongst ourselves; and such as only circulates Money from one Hand to another. The Victualling so many Ships is the Advantage of our own <HI>Farmers</HI> and <HI>Gra∣ziers.</HI> The Rigging out and equipping them, gives Money to our own Builders and Workmen. The putting them into Motion when they are so repair'd, is known to be of Service to the Ships themselves: which otherwise lie still, and often receive such Damage, as at the End it costs more to rectify. The Employing so many Seamen is still employing <HI>our own</HI> Subjects; and giving our Money to our own Country-Men: besides the great future Benefit arising from this Necessity it∣self; as they are kept in Action by it, and inured to the Service of their <HI>Country,</HI> and the more fit to defend it upon all Occasions to come. So that the <HI>Expence</HI> of our Naval <HI>Defence,</HI> which is the true and natural <HI>Defence</HI> of <HI>Britain;</HI> tho' it, indeed, must be a <HI>Burthen</HI> to <HI>those</HI> who pay towards it, as <HI>all Payments are:</HI> yet it is a Burthen with this Ad∣vantage to the <HI>Publick,</HI> that it sends not <HI>our Mo∣ney</HI> abroad; it loses it not to the <HI>Nation;</HI> it re∣moves it indeed out of <HI>one</HI> Pocket into <HI>another,</HI> but it is still <HI>our</HI> Money, and remains among <HI>ourselves.</HI> The <HI>Community</HI> and <HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Subjects</HI> taken together are not the <HI>Poorer</HI> for it; tho' the <HI>Persons</HI> paying it to others, are so: and if it be for their own <HI>necessary Defence,</HI> and for the Safety of all the Rest of their Possessions, All
<PB N="94" REF="002880_0093_0FE6865376B8F4F8"/>honest Men among them will be glad, They are so.</P>
<P>But then our Expence, tho' great, is not a∣lone. The Dispositions made by <HI>France,</HI> ever since the Signing of the Treaty of <HI>Hanover,</HI> have more than kept pace with us, in the largeness of the <HI>Expence.</HI> The first Step taken by the most <HI>Christian King</HI> was, to augment his regular Troops with <HI>Twenty five Thousand Men;</HI> and this in such a Manner, that they were presently ready for Action upon any Occasion. At the same Time he order'd a Levy of the <HI>Militia,</HI> to the Number of <HI>Sixty Thousand Men:</HI> and ap∣pointed these to be commanded by the <HI>Ancient Officers reform'd</HI> of his old <HI>Troops;</HI> not to mention <HI>Twelve Thousand Invalids,</HI> put into good Or∣der, and <HI>double Officer'd,</HI> for the Defence of such of his <HI>Cittadels</HI> and <HI>Forts</HI> as they are proper for. These, and other Dispositions, which have been made to put <HI>France</HI> into a Condition to sup∣port a War, if it should be necessary, amounted, for this last Year, by a certain Calculation, to <HI>fifteen hundred and sixty thousand Pounds Sterling;</HI> and if the <HI>Militia</HI> should be obliged to march out of their Provinces to the Frontiers, it will amount to a far greater Sum. And by this Method it comes to pass, That these sixty thousand <HI>Militia,</HI> and twelve thousand <HI>Invalids,</HI> remaining in <HI>Garrisons</HI> and fortified Places, as the Service shall require; That <HI>King</HI> can send into the Field, without In∣convenience, 165000 Men of his <HI>Regular Troops.</HI> Such has been for some Time the <HI>Disposition</HI> there, in Order to shew the <HI>New</HI> Allies, that <HI>France</HI> is not only in earnest, but in a well disposed Con∣dition
<PB N="95" REF="002880_0094_0FE6864AA6796550"/>of disputing any <HI>Attempts</HI> against <HI>itself,</HI> or its <HI>Allies.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>United Provinces</HI> indeed, came but late∣ly into the <HI>Alliance,</HI> from the Frame of their <HI>Constitution,</HI> naturally begetting <HI>Delays</HI> and pro∣longing their <HI>Debates;</HI> and not from any Want of the Sense of their Dangers, and the Necessity of their acceding to the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Hanover.</HI> For from the Time of their <HI>Accession</HI> to that <HI>Trea∣ty,</HI> they have shewn a Warmth and Vigour wor∣thy of the Occasion. They have agreed unani∣mously upon such Augmentations of their Land Forces, as by next Spring will make them above 50000 effective Men: And the necessary Mea∣sures are taking for their having a Fleet at Sea of Twenty Men of War. Besides which <HI>Expence,</HI> relating to these <HI>Augmentations,</HI> They have been at a very great Charge in providing their Maga∣zines, and putting their <HI>Barrier</HI> and <HI>Frontier</HI> Places into a good Posture of <HI>Defence.</HI> But whoever reads the late <HI>Resolutions</HI> and <HI>Represen∣tations</HI> of the <HI>States General;</HI> and sees with how deep a Concern, and in how pathetical a Man∣ner, they speak of the <HI>Calamities</HI> now threatning themselves, and the rest of <HI>Europe;</HI> declaring their Ruine must lye at their own Door, if all <HI>the Provinces</HI> do not, in a Case of such Necessity, consent to act the Part of Men in a vigorous Defence of themselves, and readily concur in
<Q><HI>What,</HI> in the Opinion of their <HI>High Mighti∣nesses,</HI> is <HI>indispensably necessary</HI> to the com∣mon Safety and Preservation; and without which the <HI>Well-being, Liberty</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> of the <HI>whole Republick,</HI> will be put to the Ven∣ture.</Q>
<PB N="96" REF="002880_0095_0FE68654E7DC8760"/>Whoever reads this, and much more said and inculcated by Them with a particular Vehe∣mence, will not think, that They are not de∣termin'd to defend themselves by all necessary Measures against the Dangers now hanging over their Heads.</P>
<P>At the same Time, those <HI>Powers,</HI> which have raised this <HI>Allarm,</HI> and occasioned this <HI>defensive Expence</HI> to their <HI>Neighbours,</HI> cannot stir one Step in their own <HI>offensive Designs,</HI> without a very considerable one to themselves. His <HI>Impe∣rial Majesty,</HI> besides the many Promises of another Sort, which He has bestow'd around Him, has entered into <HI>real Obligations</HI> which cannot be performed but at a very great Expence. To the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Cologne</HI> he has engaged to pay 600,000 <HI>German</HI> Florins a Year, for two Years; to the <HI>E∣lector</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the same; to the <HI>Elector Pa∣latin</HI> and of <HI>Treves</HI> the same; and to the Duke of <HI>Wolfenbuttle</HI> 200,000 Florins; besides what is stipulated to others. Add to these his own great <HI>Expences,</HI> in recruiting and in refitting his whole Army, and preparing every thing of all Sorts, necessary for <HI>Action:</HI> An <HI>Expence</HI> in the whole so great! that nothing but the vast Advan∣tages It is to receive from his new Alliance, and the Expectation of <HI>Remittances</HI> from <HI>Spain,</HI> could have induced him to think of it. And what then must the Expence of <HI>Spain</HI> be; which has not only it's own <HI>Army</HI> to put in Order and aug∣ment; not only it's own Towns and Coasts to guard; but the Emperor's Demands to answer? And what a <HI>State</HI> of things must the Necessi∣ties of <HI>Spain</HI> it self, together with the <HI>Demands</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="002880_0096_0FE6865987FB4DF0"/>of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> bring that King, and his <HI>Country</HI> into; even if his <HI>Flota</HI> with it's usual <HI>Cargo</HI> of <HI>Money</HI> should come Home safe: when it is well known, that, <HI>before</HI> these <HI>new Expences,</HI> (the Effect of the <HI>New Alliance</HI>) all the <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Mi∣litary</HI> Officers belonging to that <HI>Crown,</HI> and their whole Army, were in great <HI>Arrears;</HI> and all the <HI>Royal</HI> Revenues anticipated for a Year and a Half; and that the <HI>whole Nation</HI> was in a State of very great Poverty and Distress? And if such im∣mense <HI>Expences</HI> can be run into with <HI>Zeal,</HI> for the the Injury and Oppression of other Coun∣tries: surely, an Expence, much smaller in it∣self; and directed solely to the Defence and <HI>Pre∣servation</HI> of <HI>ourselves</HI> in the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> we are justly in Possession of, cannot be thought unworthy of the <HI>British Nation;</HI> nor unjustifi∣able in Those who have already begun it, only because they thought it absolutely <HI>necessary.</HI> But still <HI>other Questions</HI> arise upon this Subject.</P>
<P>It may be asked, Could not the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> all this while have tryed <HI>other Methods,</HI> than allarming <HI>Europe</HI> with <HI>Fleets?</HI> The Methods of a friendly <HI>Congress,</HI> or Pro∣posals of a more peaceable and amicable Na∣ture? Was there no Way of proceeding, but de∣manding of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> the sole Propriety of <HI>Trade;</HI> and engrossing it to <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Holland:</HI> as if <HI>other Nations</HI> had no Right to the <HI>World,</HI> besides our selves? In which Way of talking there is something very right, and something very wrong. For certainly it must be granted, that we ought to prepare ourselves with Vigour to oppose <HI>Injury;</HI> as well as to be ready to propose, or re∣ceive, any reasonable Methods of Accommoda∣tion.
<PB N="98" REF="002880_0097_0FE68685CBD39E50"/>To do the <HI>first,</HI> without a Dosposition shewn to the <HI>latter,</HI> I acknowledge, would have been unjustifiable. To do the <HI>latter</HI> without the <HI>first,</HI> had been Weakness and Folly: and could have proceeded from <HI>nothing</HI> but a <HI>Total Ignorance</HI> of the plainest <HI>Rules</HI> of political Conduct; which have long ago established It as a certain <HI>Maxim,</HI> that the best Way to <HI>Peace</HI> upon such Occasions, is with the <HI>Sword</HI> prepared for the Day of Neces∣sity; and that those <HI>Powers,</HI> who can suffer them∣selves to invade or demand the <HI>Rights</HI> of <HI>others,</HI> will laugh at all Accommodations offered, when they see them unaccompanied with such <HI>Appear∣ances</HI> as shew the <HI>Resolution</HI> of Those others to de∣fend their <HI>Rights</HI> by <HI>Force,</HI> if Reason cannot prevail.</P>
<P>I answer therefore, to <HI>these</HI> and the like <HI>Questions.</HI> 1. It never could have been justified, in the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to have made <HI>Proposals</HI> of <HI>Ac∣commodation,</HI> without the most <HI>vigorous</HI> Measures taken, which alone could make them effectual. 2. In some of the <HI>Pretences</HI> and <HI>Demands</HI> of this <HI>new Alliance,</HI> no Equivalent, no Accommodation, could be proposed. In the <HI>Case</HI> of the Demand of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> whilst the <HI>Nation</HI> seems universally to concur, that no Sum of Money, nor any o∣ther Place of Strength abroad, can be any <HI>Equi∣valent</HI> to it: what could be proposed, but a <HI>Re∣solution</HI> to defend the <HI>Nation</HI> in its just <HI>Possession</HI> of it; especially, since the whole present Conduct of <HI>Spain</HI> may assure us, by a fresh Evidence, that it is of the utmost Importance; and that, if that Place were once gone out of our Hands, we should have still less Hope of seeing Treaties ob∣serv'd, or of hindering ourselves from being more and more injured, on that side, in our <HI>Commerce?</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="002880_0098_0FE68685A54E04B0"/>3. In the <HI>other</HI> great Case, that of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s new Establishment at <HI>Ostend,</HI> the Court of <HI>Great Britain</HI> never went upon such an arbitrary Maxim as, That <HI>other Nations</HI> ought not to be permitted to begin and extend their <HI>Commerce</HI> wherever they <HI>rightfully</HI> could, as well as <HI>ourselves;</HI> or that <HI>we</HI> had any Right to oppose such Attempts: But upon these undoubted Maxims of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Right,</HI>— That <HI>Treaties</HI> are to be observed; — That, when any Country is excluded by Treaties from any particu∣lar Branch of Commerce, it is not to be authori∣zed and supported in carrying on the said Bran∣ches of Commerce in violation of the said Treaties; and — That <HI>those Powers</HI> which have, by repeated <HI>Engagements,</HI> obliged themselves to defend and support the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade, are justly to be opposed when they themselves come to be the <HI>Invaders</HI> and <HI>Destroyers</HI> of it. Agreeably to all this, 4. As the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has taken such <HI>vi∣gorous Measures</HI> as shew the <HI>Resolution</HI> of <HI>Self-defence:</HI> so, has it never been wanting either to propose, or to receive, any reasonable Method for the Ac∣commodation of this Matter, to the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Satis∣faction; if He could be satisfied with any thing, but a <HI>Trade</HI> in open Contradiction to all Treaties.</P>
<P>In particular, It was sufficiently intimated to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> that the <HI>British Court</HI> pre∣tended to nothing in this Affair, but to defend the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI> belonging to <HI>Britain</HI> by <HI>Trea∣ties;</HI> far from assuming to themselves any Right of controlling the <HI>Emperor,</HI> or his Subjects, in any Attempts, not contrary to those Treaties: That therefore, if the <HI>Emperor</HI> would remove this <HI>Com∣pany,</HI> and the Seat of <HI>Trade,</HI> now at <HI>Ostend,</HI> to <HI>Trieste,</HI> or any other Place in his <HI>Dominions,</HI> which
<PB N="100" REF="002880_0099_0FE686816471F4C0"/>did not heretofore belong to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monar∣chy; <HI>Britain</HI> was ready quietly to acquiesce. And the same was offer'd to the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> in the form of a <HI>Proposal,</HI> when his <HI>Catholick Majesty</HI> had just begun to espouse the <HI>Emperor's Interest,</HI> in this Affair of <HI>Ostend.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> not only acknow∣ledged the Reasonableness of the <HI>Proposal;</HI> but made great Professions of Hope that it would be accepted; yet, at the same Time, it was de∣clared, That <HI>Spain</HI> was under Engagements to stand by the <HI>Emperor,</HI> even supposing his <HI>unrea∣sonable</HI> Refusal of it. And at <HI>Kienna,</HI> the Intima∣tion made no <HI>Impression</HI> at all: The Resolution there, by this appearing plainly to be, The Sup∣port of the <HI>Ostend Company,</HI> and <HI>Trade</HI> from the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> against all <HI>Stipulations.</HI></P>
<P>But however this ended at <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Ma∣drid;</HI> It must have this Effect at <HI>London,</HI> to convince all Persons, that <HI>no one,</HI> either real or pretended, <HI>Provocation</HI> from <HI>Britain,</HI> gave the first <HI>Occasion</HI> for this <HI>new Alliance;</HI> (one End of which was the Establishment of the Emperor's new and unwarrantable Designs in <HI>Trade:</HI>) So the <HI>Court of Great-Britain,</HI> in the midst of all Pre∣parations for the <HI>Defence</HI> of this <HI>Nation</HI>'s Rights, has not neglected to try <HI>other Methods</HI> of a <HI>peaceable</HI> and <HI>amicable</HI> Nature; but shewn a rea∣diness to do any thing, even for present Peace, except to give up the <HI>Advantages, Rights</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> of <HI>Britain,</HI> of more Importance than present Peace: and these <HI>Advantages</HI> founded upon Treaties; which therefore, They who pre∣side are obliged to guard and defend, as a sacred <HI>Depositum,</HI> not only out of Love to their <HI>Coun∣try,</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="002880_0100_0FE6866754C07830"/>common to Them with all others, but out of <HI>peculiar Duty</HI> and Obligation; as they are intrust∣ed with this <HI>Guardianship</HI> and Defence, by the <HI>Publick;</HI> and as an Account of this Trust may justly be demanded of them.</P>
<P>If then, nothing reasonable, in the Way of <HI>Ac∣commodation,</HI> has been wanting on their Part; They will not easily be blamed, (it is to be hoped rather, they will be highly commended) for This, that They have not permitted themselves to be misled by any smooth Words without Meaning; or to be hindred from taking all necessary Precau∣tions, by any <HI>Amusements</HI> of <HI>Congresses,</HI> or <HI>Em∣bassies,</HI> or <HI>Negotiations,</HI> only thrown in their Way to gain <HI>Time</HI> to others, and to lose it to them∣selves: Since it is evident, that <HI>irreparable</HI> and <HI>ir∣retrievable</HI> Evils might have come from the not ta∣king these necessary and timely Precautions. And were it so, that They had spent their whole Time in sending and receiving fruitless Messages back∣wards and forwards, in such a critical Conjunc∣ture; we may venture to say, we know the Per∣sons who would have been the <HI>first</HI> to charge, (and very deservedly too) the Ruine of this <HI>Nation</HI> upon them; and to have demanded Justice against them for such a Conduct, in such a Time of Dan∣ger to their Country.</P>
<P>And indeed, supposing this to have been the Case; supposing the Court of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in such a Situation; with such repeated Advices from all Parts; with such Demonstrations of Danger from abroad, as put out of all Doubt the true Nature and Designs of so formidable an <HI>Alliance</HI> as that of the <HI>Emperor</HI> and <HI>Spain:</HI> I say, supposing this Court, surrounded with all these
<PB N="102" REF="002880_0101_0FE6867CC0180C40"/>Evidences, to have entered into <HI>no</HI> Measures of Defence with any neighbouring <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Prin∣ces;</HI> to have taken <HI>no</HI> Steps towards preventing the Mischief threaten'd; to have sent out <HI>no Na∣val Armaments,</HI> either to preserve any <HI>friendly</HI> Powers, or to quash any Attempts of <HI>others;</HI> Who would not rise up, and demand an Account of such a Conduct from Those who alone are to answer for it? Who would not join in saying,
<Q>Is this the <HI>Usage</HI> fit to be given to a <HI>brave</HI> and considering People? Is this the watchfulness of <HI>Those,</HI> whose Duty it is to attend to every distant View of Danger? Or, do They think so meanly of <HI>us</HI> and the <HI>whole Nation,</HI> that we can <HI>see</HI> nothing but what we <HI>feel;</HI> and that we have a Sense of <HI>no Evil,</HI> but what is <HI>present:</HI> Or, that we are so made, that a <HI>little Expence</HI> would affright us from preserving our <HI>all;</HI> or, reduced to so <HI>low</HI> a Condition of Poverty, that we can't purchase or furnish out even <HI>Self-de∣fence</HI> to our selves? Were not other <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>States</HI> threatned by the same Danger; and ready to unite with us? Must our <HI>Fleet,</HI> the Glory (as it is call'd) of this Land, lie still and decay, rather than be made our Bulwark? Our <HI>Fleet,</HI> falsly call'd our <HI>Glory,</HI> but <HI>indeed</HI> our Shame, whilst it is laid aside as useless, at a Time when That alone might make us look too for∣midable in <HI>Europe,</HI> to be insulted or affronted? Or, does even this <HI>Expence</HI> which circulates chiefly amongst ourselves, appear too formidable to a <HI>Nation</HI> which those around it <HI>envy,</HI> as the <HI>Centre</HI> of <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Plenty?</HI> But why do we speak of <HI>Expence?</HI> It is this Method of
<PB N="103" REF="002880_0102_0FE68698A75A7680"/><HI>Indolence,</HI> and <HI>Inactivity</HI> upon such an Occasi∣on, which must bring after it an <HI>Expence</HI> much <HI>greater</HI> in it self; and much more hazardous in its Effect; as Time shall add <HI>Strength</HI> to the <HI>Danger</HI> threaten'd: an <HI>Expence,</HI> which must <HI>increase</HI> our Debt, and at the same Time <HI>dimi∣nish</HI> the Hope of paying it. What Account can we give of such a <HI>Treatment</HI> of this Nation? As we can find <HI>none</HI> in all the known Measures of <HI>Political Prudence;</HI> we must search for it some∣where else. — There must be <HI>secret Reasons</HI> for such a Conduct; and perhaps <HI>these</HI> may lye in the <HI>Riches</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> suffered to come safely home, to strengthen and consolidate the most dangerous <HI>Conjunction</HI> that ever yet appeared in <HI>Europe</HI></Q>.— This and much more might justly be urged, upon the Supposition of a <HI>negligent</HI> and <HI>unactive</HI> Conduct in this <HI>Crisis</HI> of <HI>Danger.</HI> And what Reply to make to it, I profess I think it utterly impossible to tell.</P>
<P>But this is not the Case. The <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has acted quite another Part; and enter'd into <HI>that</HI> Method of <HI>vigorous Self∣defence,</HI> by which alone, in all human Wis∣dom, there can be the least Hope of preventing or repulsing any dangerous Attempts against all our highest Concerns: And a <HI>Method,</HI> to which No other Principle could possibly have directed Those who have chosen it, but <HI>That</HI> of an <HI>honest Regard</HI> to the <HI>Possessions,</HI> the <HI>Trade,</HI> the <HI>Rights,</HI> the <HI>Well-Being,</HI> and the <HI>Being</HI> itself, of this now happy and envied Nation.</P>
