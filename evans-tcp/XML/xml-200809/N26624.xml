<L>I SAW what seem'd a harmless child,</L>

<L>THERE was a miller's daughter</L>

<L>A true bred daughter of Eve:</L>

<L>Was tempted to evil,</L>
<L>But not by the devil,</L>
<L>But a devi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish handsome young man.</L>

<L>An ensign on half-pay,</L>
<L>Though no colonel, some say,</L>
<L>Had so fierce, and so noble an air:</L>

<L>THE poet says that love's like fire,</L>
<L>Which kindly heat and joy imparts,</L>
<L>For every purpose, and desire,</L>
<L>That warms, and that expands our hearts:</L>
<L>But, trust th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fire, where is the bound,</L>
<L>That shall its devastation stay?</L>
<L>Relentless ruin stalks around,</L>
<L>And horror marks its trackless way:</L>
<L>Thus both we dread, and both admire,</L>
<L>Thus poets say that love's like fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The toper says, that love's like wine,</L>
<L>And that its power, 'bove human ken,</L>
<L>Can lift the soul, and so refine</L>
<L>Our joys, that gods might envy men:</L>
<L>But, from this elevation sunk,</L>
<L>The moment reason leaves the feast,</L>
<L>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s godship finds a god, when drunk,</L>
<L>Is little better than a beast:</L>
<L>Thus both are beastly, both divine,</L>
<L>Thus topers say that love's like wine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your sportsmen say, love's like the chase</L>
<L>That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eads us many a weary mile,</L>
<L>Through many a rude and dangerous place,</L>
<L>O'er mound, and hedge, and ditch, and stile:</L>
<L>But when his pleasures, with his toil,</L>
<L>Are fairly counted, what's the gain?</L>
<L>Fatigued, and tired, he makes a coil,</L>
<L>And puts up game not worth the pain:</L>
<L>Thus love's without a goal, a race,</L>
<L>Thus sportsmen say, love's like the chase.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="283" REF="035407_0284_1004BD3A241E2F70"/>
<L>True lovers say, love's like the devil,</L>
<L>Who turns a hundred devious ways,</L>
<L>With, saint-like face, and heart of evil,</L>
<L>And smiles the most when he betrays:</L>
<L>Does not the devil take every hue,</L>
<L>And in all forms and fashions move!</L>
<L>Is not he black, and white, and blue,</L>
<L>And hot and cold?—and so is love:</L>
<L>And thus to love are lovers civil,</L>
<L>As Indians court from fear the devil.</L>
<L>Let carping idiots still condemn,</L>
<L>Where reason bids them most rejoice,</L>
<L>For if they err the faults in them,</L>
<L>And in the objects of their choice:</L>
<L>The lover that shall all excel,</L>
<L>Let him but choose a faithless fair;</L>
<L>His love shall prove a very hell,</L>
<L>No Lethe to relieve his care:</L>
<L>Let him of reason take advice,</L>
<L>And love shall be a paradise.</L>

<P>This young man, as he came out of his father's bankers, was beconed by a lady in a hackney coach—He drove to a jeweller's where he bought a diamond necklace. He dined with a roaring party at a tavern; and, in the evening, was heard to talk very loud at the opera.

<L>STANDING one summer's day on the Tower Slip,</L>
<L>Careless how I my time should employ,</L>
<L>It popped in my head that I'd take a trip</L>
<L>Aboard of a Margate Hoy:</L>
<L>I took a few slops, such as shirts and a coat,</L>
<L>For of prog I knew well they'd be stored;</L>
<L>Then I hail'd a pair of oars, shoved of my boat,</L>
<L>And away I dashed aboard.</L>
</LG>
<P>'Ah my dear Commodore, who thought of seeing you? "What, Mrs. Garbage! How is the Alderman?"—'There is my husband, Sir;' "Pon my word and dicky I declare." 'Give me leave, Commodore, to introduce you to my friends: Mr. Shadrack, Commodore Kelson, Commodore Kelson, Mr. Shadrack.' "Very much at your sharvice, Sir." 'Miss Minnikin, Commodore Kelson, Commodore Kelson, Miss Minnikin.' "Very happy to have the pleasure of knowing you Sir."

<LG>
<L>So off we went with a flowing jib,</L>
<L>Full of merriment and joy,</L>
<L>The Alderman munching, and pratling his rib,</L>
<L>Sing who so blith as we,</L>
<L>Who take a voyage to sea,</L>
<L>Aboard of a Margate Hoy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then such glee and humour, our joy to prolong,</L>
<L>Pervaded us fore and aft;</L>
<L>Some were telling a story, some whistling a song,</L>
<L>As we turned in and out 'mongst the craft:</L>
<L>Then we'd talk of our danger, and then we were gay,</L>
<L>Then how we'd astonish the folks,</L>
<L>When at Margate arrived; then, cut out of our way,</L>
<L>To laugh at the watermen's jokes.</L>
</LG>
<P>'Ho, the ship ahoy.' "Ay, ay." 'Pray have you one Wiseman aboard?' "No, no," 'Then you are all fools, hey—ha, ha, ha, went Miss Minnikin.'—"Dat is very coot chokes," said the Jew. 'Why, I say, Moses,' said the man that was affronted, 'are you a bull or bear? Damme, I thinks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou look more like a monkey. And you Miss Dolly Drylips, take a reef in your perriwig, and clap a stopper on your muzzle, clue up the plaits in your jaw bags, and give your tongue leave of absence.

<LG>
<L>So we made tother tack and lay gunnel to,</L>
<L>Which soon gave a damp to our joy,</L>
<L>Miss Minnikin squalled—mine cot, cried the Jew,</L>

<L>On board of a Margate Hoy.</L>

<L>Then, stretching too fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the larboard tack,</L>
<L>By and by, we came bump ashore.</L>

'Yes, Sir,' said the Doctor, 'not that I have any quarrel with death, but I am afraid we shall take in too large a dose.' "How do you do, Sir Phe∣lim?" 'Arrah, I should be well enough if I was not so cursedly sick." She rights, she rights!</P>
<LG>
<L>Next a gale coming on we did preciously kick,</L>
<L>Which finished completely our joy,</L>

<L>Sick as death, wet at muck, from the heel to the chin,</L>

<L>Spoilt cloaths, and provisions, now clogged up the way,</L>

"Arrah, stop the ship—Sir, would you be so kind as to be after handing me the candle cup?' Land, land, upon the starboard bow.</P>
<LG>
<L>At last, after turning on two or three tacks,</L>

<L>THERE were Farmer Thrasher, and he had a cow,</L>

<L>Jacky's master a barber and a hair-dresser were,</L>

<L>She moaned, and she moaned, nor knew what she did ail,</L>
