<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOB IX. v, vi.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Which removeth the Mountains, and they know not; which overturneth the Earth in his Anger; which shaketh the Earth out of her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE shaking of the earth, when it arises to any great degree, is one of the most awful events in all nature. It is attended with danger, which none can either withstand, avoid, or make their escape from: And the destruction it threatens is sudden, and dreadful, and equally extends to all the various ranks, conditions, and ages of men; whether high or low, rich or poor, bond or free, old or young. It is therefore an occurrence that is singularly fitted to strike the mind with surprize; and whether we will or no, it alarms our fears, and awakens in us a quick and
<PB N="6" REF="007380_0004_102B8C8278712C48"/>
pungent sense of the power and greatness of God. The most hardened sinners, those who have mock't at fear, and laugh't at destruction, are hereby roused into astonishment. Even the dumb creatures are affected with a kind of horror, and very significantly express it by their dolorous roars, tho' not modulated into articulate sounds.</P>
<P>Of this we had a very lively illustration the last week, when God arose, and suddenly awoke us out of our sleep, by terribly shaking the earth. We were all thrown into a state of trembling. Horror took hold of us, and we were afraid of this tremendous judgment of God; not knowing but we should sink down quick into some deep cavern below, or be buried in the ruins of our own habitations. May we never forget the distress of that awful morning, and our de∣liverance out of it!</P>
<P>It is with a view to assist both you, and myself, in making a wise and religious improvement of so extraor∣dinary a providence, that I have selected this text to em∣ploy our present meditations. It obviously contains two things well worthy of our special notice, namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That 'tis GOD who maketh the <HI>earth to shake,</HI> and <HI>the pillars thereof to tremble.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That he <HI>ordinarily</HI> does this in <HI>testimony</HI> of his <HI>righteous anger.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. 'Tis GOD who maketh the <HI>earth</HI> to <HI>shake</HI> and <HI>tremble.</HI></P>
<P>And this he does, either by an <HI>immediate</HI> exertment of his almighty power, or by concurring with such <HI>second causes</HI> as are fitted, in the natural course of their operation, to produce so wonderful an effect.</P>
<P>There may have been <HI>miraculous</HI> earthquakes, earthquakes that took rise from the <HI>immediate</HI> hand of God. The earthquakes which accompanied <HI>Israel'</HI>s
<PB N="7" REF="007380_0005_102B8459987E9D58"/>
passage thro' the <HI>red sea,</HI> and the river <HI>Jordan,</HI> com∣memorated by the <HI>Psalmist, Psalm.</HI> 114, might be of this sort. The earthquake, which swallow'd up <HI>Co∣rah</HI> and <HI>company,</HI> recorded <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. 30—33, might be another instance of the same kind. So, when the God of <HI>Israel</HI> descended on <HI>Sinai,</HI> and published his law from thence, it might be <HI>miraculously,</HI> that <HI>the whole mount quaked greatly, Exod.</HI> 19. 18. In allusion to this wonderful event the <HI>Psalmist</HI> says, Psal. 68. 7, <HI>The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even</HI> Sinai <HI>itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</HI> And of the same kind still might be the earthquake which happened at the cruci∣fixion of our Lord, spoken of in that language, <HI>Matt.</HI> 29. 51. <HI>And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom; and the Earth did quake, and the rocks rent:</HI> And that also which was felt at his resurrection, recorded in those words, <HI>Matt.</HI> 28. 2, <HI>And behold, there was a great earthquake!</HI> These earthquakes, 'tis observable, were all produced in an <HI>age of miracles,</HI> at a time when the great God, in other instances, exerted his <HI>immediate</HI> almighty power; for which reason it may probably eno' be supposed, that <HI>these</HI> also were effected by a <HI>supernatural</HI> operation.</P>
<P>But more commonly the great God makes use of <HI>second Causes</HI> in the production of earthquakes; ex∣erting his power, not <HI>immediately,</HI> but by <HI>concurring with these Causes.</HI> There are stores of them, no doubt, in the bowels of the earth: But knowest thou, O man, what they are, or how they operate to the production of these amazing events? Much has been said, upon the origin of earthquakes, by men of learning; but, after all that yet has been said, and by the greatest Philosophers too, perhaps, this work of God may justly be ranked among those marvellous ones, which cannot be comprehended; and in contemplation on which
<PB N="8" REF="007380_0006_102B8C8675AC43D0"/>
we may take to ourselves words, and say, <HI>Behold, God is great, and we know him not!</HI> The noise of his voice, in the deep caverns of the earth, who can ex∣plain! That amazing power, which causes the earth, in a circle of hundreds of miles, to quiver and tremble, or undulate in waves like those of the sea, who can understand! But tho' we can't penetrate into the secret springs of an extensive terrible earthquake; yet we have no reason to think, but that it takes rise from suf∣ficient <HI>second Causes,</HI> in common with the other phae∣nomena of nature: Only these causes must always be considered as having the first Cause of all things for their director and Governor. The shaking of the earth, in every instance, is bro't to pass under the super∣intending guidance, and almighty concurrence, of the supreme regent of nature. <HI>Second Causes</HI> may, while working in a natural way, produce this effect; but still God is more a great deal the cause of them than they. 'Twas he who at first establish'd the laws of nature, giving to all second causes their respective powers of operation, and assigning to them their several spheres of acting.—Tis he who upholds them all in being and operation; for by him do all things consist.—Tis he who concurs with them in their influence, so as that without him they could not act at all.—Tis he who directs and governs all their motions and springs of action; and so over-rules them, as that they shall exert their force in this, or that place, to this or that degree, just as he pleases, and as may best serve his designs in the kingdom of providence.</P>
<P>So that tho' earthquakes are <HI>ordinarily</HI> produced, in a natural way, by a concurrence of suitable and sufficient second causes; yet it is God who produces them: He is more properly their <HI>Cause,</HI> than any <HI>secondary</HI> one, or than all secondary ones together: For they are all his; he made them; he upholds
<PB N="9" REF="007380_0007_102B8C889CAAE1E8"/>
them; he commands them; he controuls and over∣rules them: They act by him, and for him; and can do nothing without him.</P>
<P>And tis on such accounts as these, that the scripture so frequently speaks of Earthquakes as the <HI>work of God;</HI> representing him as that glorious being, who <HI>shaketh the earth, and overturneth the mountains.</HI> That is the language, in which the pious <HI>Psalmist</HI> has taught us to speak of an earthquake, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 60. 1, 2, <HI>O God, thou hast made the earth to tremble.</HI> So, when he would describe an earthquake, tis in such words as those, Psalm. 104. 32, <HI>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</HI> In like manner, holy <HI>Job,</HI> speaking in my text, of earth∣quakes, carries our tho'ts beyond all <HI>second Causes</HI> to the glorious <HI>first Cause</HI> of all things: <HI>Which removeth the mountains; which overturneth them in his anger; which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</HI> Agreable whereto is that of the pro∣phet, <HI>Amos</HI> 9. 5, <HI>And the Lord of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt; and it shall rise up wholly like a flood;</HI> that is, it shall appear with a motion like that of the waves in a flood.—But it would be needless to enlarge here. You are all, I believe, convinced not only of the being and perfections, but of the providential government of God; that his throne is prepared in the heavens, and that his kingdom ruleth over all, extending even to the motion of a <HI>spar∣row,</HI> and the falling of a <HI>hair</HI> from off our heads; much more to those violent concussions in the deep caverns of the earth, which make it to tremble.</P>
<P>Only, let me, as the proper improvement of this part of my subject, put you upon attending to this truth, and exercising an affectionate awaken'd faith in it, with respect to the great event of the other morning. Seriously carry your tho'ts beyond all <HI>second Causes,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="007380_0008_102B8C8A99D8BAD0"/>
and fix your eye on <HI>God</HI> as the supreme author of the dreadful earthquake that then fill'd you with distress; and encourage in your minds the most lively appre∣hensions both of his <HI>power</HI> and <HI>goodness,</HI> which were eminently displayed at that time, taking care to pay him those <HI>religious</HI> acknowledgments that are his due.</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, no work in the kingdom of pro∣vidence, that renders the great God more awfully glorious, than this of his terribly shaking the earth under us, and our houses over us. A most marvellous display is hereby made of his <HI>almighty power.</HI> How weak and feeble do all creatures appear in comparison with him! If he does but touch the mountains, they tremble; the hills, and they are moved at his pre∣sence! One of the first tho'ts that arises in the mind, upon the shock of an earthquake, is that, "the Lord is a mighty God; what God is there in the heaven, or in the earth, that can do according to his works, and according to his might"? Let us, from what we saw, and felt, in the late earthquake, entertain in our hearts an awakened apprehension of him as clothed with power; and be in a disposition to fall down before him with such religious acknowledgments in our mouths as those, "Thou art great, O Lord; there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee: Thou hast a mighty arm, and strength is in thy right hand: Thou art the Lord God omnipotent." And let us fear to of∣fend this great and holy Lord God, whose is the pow∣er, and the greatness, and the majesty; who can do whatsoever he pleases in heaven, and earth, and all deep places, and in a moment, at any time, destroy our <HI>Souls</HI> as well as bodies, and this in <HI>hell.</HI>—</P>
<P>The <HI>goodness</HI> of God has likewise been wonder∣fully manifested in this event of providence. To what else can it be ascribed, that, when he so awfully shook our houses, he so proportion'd the force with
<PB N="11" REF="007380_0009_102B8C8C72B8AE20"/>
which he did this, as that they should not be shattered to pieces, and bury us in their ruins? How easy would it have been with him to have increased the <HI>impe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> which caused the earth to shake, which if he had done but a few degrees more, the effect would inevitably have been our sudden and general destruction? And to what can we attribute it, but to his unmerited goodness, that he thus restrained his wrath, and did not suffer it to involve us in common ruin? O how infinitely indebted are we to the mercy of a good God?—How should we call upon our Souls, and all that is within us to bless his holy name!—O let us never be unmindful of this marvellous mercy of God, to which alone it is owing we were not consumed. How should Sinners, such in special who are conscious to themselves that they are heinously so, acknowledge and adore this rich pa∣tience of God towards them, which has lengthened out their lives, and their space for repentance? Had the earth, in its late agitation, instantaneously swallowed you up in some wide chasin, or put an end to your lives by the crush of your falling houses, where had you been now? Whither would your Souls have gone? O most important enquiry!—Oh be thankful to a good God, that you are yet alive, and yet within the reach of mercy! And be instant in your care to make your peace with him, thro' Jesus Christ, and to get into a state of safety, with respect to another world; and it will now be well with you, should God ever so suddenly, or awfully, call you hence to be here no more.—But I must now go on to the other observa∣tion, namely,</P>
<P>II. That when God maketh the earth to shake and tremble, tis <HI>ordinarily</HI> in testimony of his <HI>anger.</HI> I say <HI>ordinarily,</HI> because the <HI>anger</HI> of God has not <HI>al∣ways</HI> been the <HI>more special reason</HI> of his causing an earthquake. He has sometimes designed this to an∣swer
<PB N="12" REF="007380_0010_102B8C8E032AE5D8"/>
other ends besides testifying his displeasure.</P>
<P>Sometimes he may have had it in view to declare his own infinite <HI>greatness</HI> and <HI>majesty.</HI> This seems to have been the <HI>more special reason</HI> of his making the earth terribly to shake, when he publish'd the law from the top of <HI>Sinai.</HI> It was not because he was now an∣gry with the <HI>Jewish</HI> nation; for he was <HI>shewing his word unto</HI> Jacob, <HI>and his statutes and his judgments un∣to</HI> Israel; and dealing with them, in a way of favour, beyond what he had ever before done to any other people. But it became the divine being to appear with the ensigns of <HI>majesty;</HI> and it was, that he might gloriously display his <HI>greatness</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> that he made the <HI>mount to quake so terribly,</HI> when he came down upon it.</P>
<P>Sometimes his <HI>more immediate</HI> intention has been the <HI>Salvation</HI> and <HI>deliverance</HI> of his people, and to give proof of his <HI>signal presence</HI> with them to <HI>protect, de∣fend,</HI> and <HI>bless</HI> them. So, when <HI>Israel</HI> went forth out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Lord appeared marvellously for them, and their <HI>deliverance</HI> was very much owing to the dreadful earthquake, which swallow'd up <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his <HI>host.</HI> For that their destruction was bro't about by an earthquake is very plain from those words, in <HI>Exod.</HI> 15. 12, <HI>Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, and the earth swallowed them.</HI> Tis true, there might be a double inten∣tion in the production of this earthquake. If it was design∣ed as a testimony of God's anger against the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and sent in judgment to destroy them; it was intended also, and this primarily, for the salvation of <HI>Israel:</HI> So, when this same people had entered into <HI>Canaan,</HI> it was by earthquakes that God sometimes display'd his power in favour of them, to defend and protect them. In allusion to this is that acknowledgment to the supreme majesty, <HI>Judg.</HI> 5. 4. 5. <HI>Lord, when thou wentest out of</HI> Seir, <HI>when thou marchedst out of the
<PB N="13" REF="007380_0011_102B8C8FB4C34748"/>
field of</HI> Edom, <HI>the earth trembled, the mount melted be∣fore the Lord.</HI> It was probably by an earthquake, that God threw down the walls of <HI>Jericho,</HI> and delivered that city into the hands of the <HI>Israelites;</HI> the story of which we have at large in the 6th Chapter of <HI>Joshua.</HI> And the earthquake which shook open the door of the prison, were <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were confined, was de∣sign'd in mercy to those <HI>Servants of the most high God;</HI> to vindicate their character, and make way for their re∣lease, and the furtherance of the Gospel thereby. In all these earthquakes, there might be an exhibition of the divine anger against the enemies of religion; but still the <HI>principal</HI> intention seems to have been to give proof of the presence of God with his servants to make way for their salvation.</P>
<P>In fine, sometimes God has tho't fit to accompany an extraordinary <HI>out-pouring of his spirit</HI> with the shock of an earthquake. So, when the Apostles were united in solemn prayer, there was the noise as of a <HI>mighty rushing wind,</HI> which <HI>shook the place where they were assembled together:</HI> Upon which it follows, Acts 4. 31. <HI>they were all filled with the holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>But these things notwithstanding, earthquakes more commonly are sent in judgment, and because <HI>God is angry.</HI> This is very plainly intimated in my text; and there are numerous other scriptures which speak to the same purpose. <HI>Psalm</HI> xvi. 7. <HI>The earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved, and were shaken, because he was wroth.</HI> Ezek. xxxviii. 19, 20, compared with <HI>Nahum</HI> i. 5, 6. <HI>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his presence; yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. Who can stand before his indignation? And who can abide in the fierceness of his wrath? His fury is poured out like fire; and the rocks are thrown down by him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007380_0012_102B8C9257EF3668"/>
But had the scripture been silent upon this head, we might easily have known, that earthquakes are a token of the <HI>divine anger.</HI> They are, in their opera∣tion, the most fearful events, and carry with them the most lively signatures of <HI>displeasure.</HI> How can we do any other than conclude, that the majesty of heaven is <HI>angry,</HI> when we behold him throwing the earth into such a state, as that it struggles and heaves, as though all over convulsed? This indeed is the sentiment of all hearts, at such an awful time. Who is there that is not filled with concern, from an ap∣prehension of the great God as <HI>angry?</HI> How do our sins now fly in our faces? How conscious are we of guilt? How distrest lest God should be about to ex∣ecute upon us the fierceness of his wrath? There is scarce a sinner so profligate and abandoned, but fear∣fulness now takes hold of him; and however thought∣less he was before of God, he now realises his being and providence, has awakened in him a sense of his obligations to him, and cant help trembling at the thought that he is angry, and may now be about to take vengeance on him.</P>
<P>'Tis true, when the shaking of the earth is com∣paratively light, and attended with no bad effects, men may not look upon it, at least not consider it, as an evidence of God's displeasure; but its agitati∣ons are sometimes so violent, and the effects follow∣ing thereupon so dismal, as to convince all, even the most obdurate, that God is, and that he is displeased; yea, filled with indignation. Blessed be God, we, in this land, have not as yet been visited with earth∣quakes that have done any more than solemnly war∣ned us; though they have often been sent upon other places, not only to the filling men's minds with horri∣ble consternation, not only to the throwing down here and there a house, and taking away here and there a
<PB N="15" REF="007380_0013_102B8C95B8EB0F68"/>
life; but to the ingulsing large cities, and numerous villages, in one common desolation. The rocks have been rent, the hills moved, the mountains overturned, and the earth so opened as to take down her inhabi∣tants by hundreds and thousands. No less than an hundred thousand souls have been destroyed, in a few moments, by one dreadful earthquake. And can this be, and God at the same time not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ched with anger? Wherein could the holy righteous God more awfully make it evident, that he is displeased? War, famines, pestilences are spoken of in scripture as the <HI>great judgments</HI> of God; but they are neither of them to be compared with <HI>earthquakes.</HI> These, of all God's judicial dispensations, are the most terrible; and the surest indication of his righteous anger.</P>
<P>But you will ask, it may be, what is the reason of this <HI>anger</HI> of God? From whence is it excited? Why is it stirred up?</P>
<P>To this I would say, when the prophet <HI>Habakkuk</HI> saw the tents of <HI>Cushan in affliction,</HI> and the land of <HI>Midian</HI> in a state of <HI>trembling,</HI> he at once concluded, that God was <HI>angry;</HI> but, at the same time, was far from imagining, that it was at the inanimate <HI>earth.</HI> Says he, <HI>chapter</HI> iii. ver. 8. <HI>Was the Lord displeased against the rivers? Was thine anger against the ri∣vers? Was thy wrath against the sea?</HI> Far be it from the all-wise God to be angry at the <HI>rivers,</HI> or <HI>earth,</HI> or <HI>sea!</HI> He is capable of anger, in the figura∣tive sense it is applied to him, with <HI>man</HI> only on this earth, and with nothing in man but <HI>sin.</HI> Sin is the ground, and the only moral ground, of the anger of God, that anger of his, which causeth the earth to shake and tremble. 'Tis <HI>this</HI> that transgresseth his law, opposes his will, affronts his sovereignty, re∣flects contempt upon his government, and brings con∣fusion into the <HI>moral</HI> world: 'Tis <HI>this</HI> therefore
<PB N="16" REF="007380_0014_102B8C97F2F86E70"/>
that excites his displeasure, and to such a degree some∣times, as that he is provoked to bring on the shock of an earthquake to warn, or punish, the sinful sons of men. To this purpose are those words of the pro∣phet, <HI>Isa.</HI> v. 24, 25. <HI>Because they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of the holy one of Israel,</HI> THEREFORE <HI>is the anger of the Lord kind<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them;—and the</HI> HILLS DID TREMBLE.</P>
<P>But as the scripture takes notice of <HI>some sins in special,</HI> which have excited the <HI>anger</HI> of God, and been the occasion of earthquakes, either in his <HI>threat∣nings,</HI> or the <HI>execution</HI> of them; I shall not think it unseasonable to point them out to you at this time, as particularly worthy of your most serious conside∣ration.</P>
<P>The sins included in the term, <HI>uncleanness,</HI> have so offended God, as that he has testified his <HI>anger</HI> a∣gainst them by an <HI>earthquake.</HI> I mention these sins first, because they are the sins in <HI>special,</HI> which occa∣sioned the first earthquake, we have an account of, in the bible; and a very tremendous one it was. You all know, what the sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI> were; and you know also, what sudden and terrible destruc∣tion was brought on them herefor. Besides the fire and brimstone, which God rained on them from hea∣ven, there <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, a <HI>sinking down of the earth,</HI> whereby these fornicators, and adulterers, and abusers of them∣selves with mankind, were intirely swallowed up. The manner in which the scripture describes the de∣struction of these cities, with their inhabitants, seems to point out an <HI>earthquake,</HI> as well as an horrible <HI>tem∣pest of fire;</HI> for it is said, Gen. 29. 25, <HI>The Lord overthrew these cities, and their inhabitants.</HI> And tis observable, the prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> speaking of this
<PB N="17" REF="007380_0015_102B8C9A36C03088"/>
event, says, <HI>Lament.</HI> 4. 6, <HI>They were overthrown as in a moment;</HI> which perfectly agrees with the opera∣tion of an <HI>earthquake.</HI> And tis certain, that these cities, with the country round about, for many miles in breadth, and more in length, were not only <HI>burnt,</HI> but also <HI>sunk down;</HI> and in the place where they stood, there is now a nauseous lake, called the <HI>dead,</HI> or <HI>salt sea:</HI> And it remains to this day.</P>
<P>I will not presume to determine, that it was for the sins comprehended in <HI>uncleaness,</HI> in distinction from others, that God was provoked the last week terribly to shake the earth; but this I will venture to say, that as these sins are shamefully prevalent all over the land, and emphatically in this town, we might do well to esteem ourselves warned of God against <HI>uncleanness,</HI> in all its various branches, and call'd upon to flee these filthy lusts, lest, after the manner of <HI>Sodom,</HI> we also should be set forth as an example, for giving our selves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh.</P>
<P><HI>Sabbath-breaking</HI> is likewise a sin, God has threat∣ned to testify against by shaking the earth. The pro∣phet brings in the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> expressing them∣selves in that language, <HI>Amos</HI> 8. 5, <HI>When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sab∣bath, that we may set forth wheat?</HI> And then follows an awful denunciation from God, v. 7. 8, <HI>The Lord hath sworn by the excellency of</HI> Jacob, <HI>Surely I will not forget any of their works: shall not the land trem∣ble for this?</HI></P>
<P>And tis no wonder he has been so severe in signifying his displeasure at the violation of his <HI>Sabbath.</HI> For tis one of the laws he publish'd from <HI>Sinai,</HI> and with more awful pomp than he ever before, or since, pub∣lished any of his laws. And tis a law, the due ob∣servation whereof has a near connection with the reli∣gious observation of the other divine precepts. If

men are sacredly careful to sanctify the <HI>Sabbath</HI> in their hearts, closets, and families, as well as in the place of public worship, it will have an happy influence on their general temper and conduct, to render them amiable and lovely: Whereas, if they have upon their minds no serious sense of <HI>Sabbath-sanctification,</HI> and make little or no difference between <HI>Lord's-'Days,</HI> and other days, neglecting religion in themselves and fami∣lies, as well as in the sanctuary; or attending on sab∣bath-duties in a formal superficial manner, the same unhallow'd spirit will be likely to run thro' their whole behaviour in the world. And it seldom happens, but men are loose and prophane in other regards, if they are so with respect to the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> This therefore of remembring the sabbath-day to keep it holy, is a duty of greater importance, than many may be ready to imagine; and the neglecting, or prophaning, the day by idleness, recreation, or unnecessary worldly employ∣ments, is highly displeasing to God: And we may the rather think so, because he has threatned this sin with so awful a judgment.</P>
<P>And suffer me to remind you here, it was on the evening of the sabbath, about eight and twenty years ago, that we were surprized with the most fearful earthquake that was ever before known in the coun∣try; it was on a sabbath-day also, and while in the place of worship, that we were again surprized, about ten years since, with a like, tho' more moderate, shak∣ing of the earth; and the last evening, which we e∣steem a part of the sabbath, we were yet again alarmed with an agitated earth. Ought we not to take occa∣sion from hence to reflect upon our <HI>Sabbath-sins</HI> as particularly provoking to God? May we not learn the meaning of the threatning in providence by the <HI>timeing</HI> of it? Are not our tho'ts naturally pointed to the dishonor we have done God, by disregarding that law of his which binds us to sanctify the sabbath?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="007380_0017_102B8C9DFACEFE20"/>
It cannot be pretended, that the <HI>sabbath</HI> is observed among us with that conscience and care, which might reasonably be expected, considering our high professi∣ons to regard it as a day to the Lord.—Are not many too ready to say with the Jews, in the text we just now mentioned, <HI>when will the sabbath be gone,</HI> that we may go about our worldly business? Are not many as free to take their diversions on this day, as on any other? Do not many neglect the public worship on this day, and take as little care to cultivate religion in their families, or in their own souls? We have cer∣tainly reason, we especially of this town, to call our selves to account for our breaches of the holy sab∣bath, to consider of our past omissions of duty, and commissions of sin, and to humble ourselves herefor before God: Nor would this be a misimprove∣ment of the present dispensation of God.</P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> is another sin God has testified his anger a∣gainst by earthquakes. To this purpose is that of the prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> ii. 12, 17, 21. <HI>For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud, and lofty; and upon every one that is lifted up: And he shall be brought low. And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of man shall be made low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day,</HI>—<HI>when he shall arise to shake terribly the earth.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis no more than might be expected, that God should thus signify his displeasure against the sin of <HI>pride.</HI> For 'tis a sin that God has mentioned by name, and spoken of as an <HI>abomination</HI> to him. And 'tis the source of most other sins. 'Tis this that gives rise to that extravagance of dress, and those trou∣blesome, not to say indecent fashions, which the daugh∣ters of Zion so generally run into: 'Tis this that puts so many upon exceeding their ability, as well as pro∣per
<PB N="20" REF="007380_0018_102B8D8684CDF718"/>
station, in expensive living; the end whereof must be their reduction to poverty in a little time, if they don't grow more humble: 'Tis this that leads men to think more highly of themselves than they deserve, and to treat their neighbours with such insolence and contempt: In a word, 'tis this that dis∣poses men to imagine, that even God himself has as great a regard for them, as they have for themselves, by which means they are discontented and unthankful. We might properly take occasion to consider wherein, we may have been chargeable with this vice, in any of its branches, that we may humble our selves there∣for, repent, and no more, in this way, excite the anger of God.</P>
<P><HI>Unrighteousness</HI> is another sin still, which God has threatened with an earthquake; however it be com∣mitted, whether by downright oppression and violence, or the more secret arts of fraud and knavery. These ways of dishonest dealing are particularly mentioned as the moral ground of God's causing the earth to tremble, by the prophet <HI>Amos.</HI> He speaks, in the third chapter of his prophesy, ver. 4. 6, of those who <HI>swallowed up the needy,</HI> and <HI>bought the poor for sil∣ver:</HI> Here is cruel extortion, downright oppression. In the 6th ver. he speaks of those who <HI>made the e∣phah small, and the shekel great; falsifying the bal∣lance by deceit:</HI> Here is the more sly and artful way of tricking and cheating in commerce. And now follows the threatning, in the 8th verse, <HI>shall not the land tremble for this?</HI></P>
<P>We may possibly think it a matter of no great im∣portance, whether we are honest, or not. We may esteem honesty nothing more than a pagan virtue. But we ought to know, that a real principle of righ∣teousness is a christian grace, and of absolute and indis∣pensible necessity. Our Saviour has said, <HI>Whatsoever
<PB N="21" REF="007380_0019_102B846B681CD068"/>
ye would that men should do to you, do ye the same to them:</HI> Nor unless we are, in some good measure, formed to such a temper as this, are we worthy the name of christians? Righteousness, in all its branches towards our neighbour, as well as towards God, is what we must practise; or we shall certainly expose ourselves to that anger of heaven, which may cause the earth to tremble and sink under us. This may be especially worthy of our consideration, in such a day of awful rebuke as this is; and the rather, because it may be feared, whether unrighteousness, open or se∣cret; in the ways of violence, or under the disguise of art, is not emphatically the sin of <HI>New-England</HI> in general, and of this <HI>Town</HI> in particular. Says the prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> v. 6. <HI>Wo unto them that join house to house, and field to field!</HI> He is speaking of those who do it by unfair means, in the methods of disho∣nesty. The reason of this Woe follows in the 25th verse, <HI>The hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets;</HI> that is, by the falling of scattered pieces of the houses upon them.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Drunkenness</HI> is another sin, it might be expected, God would visit with an earthquake. Reel∣ing too and fro is the characteristic of one that is drunk. And 'tis observable, the prophet, when de∣scribing an earthquake, speaks of it in much the same language. <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiv. 19, 20. <HI>The earth is moved ex∣ceedingly, the earth shall reel to and fro like a Drunk∣ard, and shall be removed like a cottage.</HI> But the man∣ner of motion in an earthquake, the analogy between this judgment and <HI>drunkenness,</HI> is not the only reason we have to think, that <HI>this</HI> is a sin God would testify against. It is mentioned, by name, in scripture, espe∣cially when committed in company, and with noisie vain merriment, as that which will expose to the woe of an earthquake. <HI>Isai.</HI> v. 11, 12. <HI>Wo unto them that
<PB N="22" REF="007380_0020_102B846DD2430898"/>
rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine en∣flame them. And the harp, and the viol; the tabret, and the pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: But they regard not the work of the Lord; neither consider the operation of his hands.</HI> The threatning follows, in the 25th verse, <HI>Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people, and the hills did tremble.</HI></P>
<P>An awakening consideration this to the people of <HI>New-England!</HI> among whom there are so many, of whom it may with truth be said, that <HI>they follow strong drink,</HI> and <HI>continue at it till they are enflamed by it.</HI> How general is the practice of <HI>drinking to</HI> excess? What large quantities of spirituous liquors are there consumed in this land, and in this town! Do not many of our people spend too much of their time, and too much of their substance, in taverns! Are there none of them that walk in rioting and drunkenness, in addition to chambering and wanton∣ness? Have we never seen drunkards reeling to and fro in the streets, as we have passed along? And can it be thought strange, if God, in testimony against this enormous vice, should cause the earth to reel also? And it were well for sinners, in this kind, if this was all they might expect from a provoked God. But 'tis far from being so. They are particularly marked, in the revelations of scripture, as persons that shall be excluded heaven; as we read, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 9. <HI>Drunk∣ards shall not inherit the kingdom of God:</HI> Nor is this the worst of their case; for unless they repent in time, they shall <HI>have their part,</HI> as it is declared, <HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 8, <HI>in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, Enmity to Christ, and ill treatment of him, has been testified against by an earthquake. The next thing recorded after the death of our Saviour, which
<PB N="23" REF="007380_0021_102B846F684ABE38"/>
was bro't about by the hatred and malice of the Jews against his person, and religion, is that, <HI>Matt.</HI> 27. 51, <HI>The earth did quake, and the rocks rent.</HI> It might be to do honour to Christ, as the Son of God and Saviour of men, that the earth groaned, and trembled, when he gave up the ghost; but his design also, in this event, at this particular time, no doubt, was, to signify his high displeasure at the Jews, who, by wicked hands, had crucified and slew the Lord of glory. And if we justify their conduct by our hatred of him; if we neg∣lect his great salvation; if we refuse him who has spoken to us from heaven; if we reject his person and counsel; and if, by obstinately continuing in those sins for the expiation of which he died, we virtually crucify him afresh, and put him to open shame:—shall not we also be justly liable to the resentments of God? and would it be any wonder, if he should testi∣fy his anger, by visiting us with the shocks of an earth∣quake? While we refuse to have this man to reign over us, and express our disregard to him by our un∣belief and disobedience, we are in danger not only of judgments in this world, but of the dam∣nation of hell. O that we had upon our minds a due sense of this! And that we might herefrom be awakened to a speedy flight to Christ, in the Gospel way! We shall then be safe from evil here, and secure from the divine wrath hereafter.</P>
<P>Enough, I believe, has now been said to satisfy us, that the <HI>anger</HI> of God is <HI>that</HI> which excites him to send <HI>earthquakes;</HI> as also to point out those <HI>sins</HI> which may <HI>eminently</HI> be the ground of his displeasure, testi∣fied by these judicial dispensations.</P>
<P>And now, from what has been discoursed, may we not justly fear, that God is <HI>angry</HI> with his people in this <HI>town</HI> and <HI>land?</HI> When he shaketh the earth, tis because he is <HI>angry:</HI> And why is he angry? Surely, not at the
<PB N="24" REF="007380_0022_102B84722EF69D10"/>
earth which trembles: no; but at the <HI>sins</HI> of the people who dwell on it. And as we are a sinful and degenerate people, we have all the reason in the world to con∣clude, tis because God is <HI>angry</HI> with us for our <HI>sins,</HI> that he has thus arose to shake terribly the earth under us, and our houses over us: Nor need we be at any loss to know what the sins are, that have excited his displeasure, and the manifestations of it, in this way, against us. The sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> are to be found, even in this land of Gospel-light and advantages.—We are as weary of the Lord's <HI>sabbaths,</HI> and as remiss and neg∣ligent in our attendance on the duties proper to them, as were the Jews of old.—We are become shamefully defective in the government, instruction and religion of our housholds. Our children and servants are many of them vile, and we restrain them not. God, the founder of our families, is not so generally ac∣knowledged in them, as might reasonably be expected, considering the example of our fathers. There are many houses, it may be feared, especially in this town, in which the worship of God is not upheld; in which, perhaps, scarce ever a prayer was put up to almighty God.—And what sins are there that are not committed in the land? We have risen up, in our fa∣ther's stead, a generation that know not the Lord, that have done evil exceedingly in his sight. We are in∣deed, to an high degree of guilt, addicted to profane∣ness, worldliness, dishonesty, pride, extravagance, luxu∣ry, intemperance, and all other immoralities, which ought not to be so much as named among christians.—And shall not God visit us for these iniquities? It can't be, but he should be angry with us. We may depend, our earth was terribly shook, because he was wroth. We were, in the moral sense, ripe for this awful judg∣ment: And tis a wonder of mercy, the force which caused the late trembling of our houses, was not heigh∣ten'd
<PB N="25" REF="007380_0023_102B848005B3F218"/>
in its degree, so as to bury us in their ruins. This had certainly been the case, had God dealt with us ac∣cording to our deserts. Blessed, forever blessed, be his name, that in wrath he remembred mercy. It was owing to this, and to this only, that we were not involved, as other places have often been, in sudden and gene∣ral destruction.</P>
<P>What therefore remains, but that we immediately endeavour, by <HI>repentance,</HI> to remove away the ground of God's displeasure. That is the voice of the <HI>shaking</HI> we have heard and felt, <HI>Repent, and turn from your transgressions, that so iniquity may not be your ruin.</HI> And this is the voice also of the other threatning aspects of divine providence at this day. To day therefore, while it is called to day, let us hear God's voice, and not hearden our hearts, nor suffer them to be hardened thro' the deceitfulness of sin. The call is universal: It extends to <HI>Churches,</HI> to <HI>Courts,</HI> to <HI>Colleges,</HI> to <HI>Schools,</HI> to <HI>Families,</HI> to the <HI>whole land;</HI> and to all <HI>orders, ages,</HI> and <HI>conditions</HI> of persons in it; to <HI>high</HI> and <HI>low, rich</HI> and <HI>poor, old</HI> and <HI>young;</HI> to all without exception, or discrimination: And it were to be wished, that we would all, in our respective places, pay a due regard to it; that the <HI>reformation</HI> may be <HI>general.</HI> It would be well, should we each one smite upon his own breast, and say, <HI>What have I done?</HI> How far am I charge∣able with the public guilt? And wherein we may, upon serious enquiry, be conscious of having trans∣gressed against the Lord, we should immediately re∣pent, and amend our doings which have not been right, and make it our care, for the time to come, to obey all God's precepts, whether they relate to our duty, to our Maker, our selves, or one another. Nothing short of a <HI>general</HI> thorough change of our manners should satisfy us; for nothing short of this will af∣ford us just ground of hope for a change in the dis∣pensations of God.</P>

Are any of you, my friends, walking in the way of your own hearts, and in the sight of your eyes, thoughtless of God, and of the great concerns of re∣ligion; let me beseech you, as you love your lives, as you love your souls, instantly to come to a stop in your career in sin. How dare you provoke that glo∣rious powerful being, <HI>who removeth the mountains in his anger, and maketh the pillars of the earth to trem∣ble!</HI> How amazing is your boldness! How stupid your folly! Hast thou an arm like God? Canst thou resist that power, <HI>which shaketh the foundations of the earth?</HI> Canst thou bear that indignation, <HI>which over∣turneth the mountains,</HI> and sets universal nature a trembling? Canst thou escape that presence, which dwells in the most secret caverns of the earth, and commands all the materials of destruction that are lodged there? Oh! who can stand before this migh∣ty Lord God? Behold! <HI>he setteth upon the circle of the earth, and none can stay his hand! He maketh the earth to shake and tremble, and moveth the foundati∣ons of the hills, because he is wroth!</HI> And will you be fearless of so great and dreadful a God, in com∣parison with whom <HI>the inhabitants of the world are as grashoppers;</HI> yea, <HI>nothing, and less than nothing!</HI> Will you rise up in rebellion against his sovereign au∣thority, defying his power, and daring his vengeance? Oh! be advised to <HI>agree quickly</HI> with this almighty <HI>adversary.</HI> Be incessant in your prayers, and endea∣vours, in the use of all appointed means, that you may be humbled, reformed, and thoroughly converted. And give yourselves no ease, till you have had that <HI>moral change</HI> accomplished in you, which will make you the friends of God, and secure your safety, <HI>tho' the earth should be removed, and the mountains be car∣ried into the midst of the seas.</HI>—</P>

Were none of you, the other morning, in anxiety and concern of mind, from an apprehension of God as angry with you? When you felt the earth so awfully shaking under you, and your houses over you, threat∣ning you with immediate destruction, did you not perceive also the agitations of an accusing conscience? Were none of your sins then brought to your remem∣brance? Did none of them fly in your faces? Had you in your hearts no fear of the Almighty? I can∣not suppose, but you were most of you struck with an awful dread of the power and majesty of God; and I can't but hope, that some of you tho't within your selves, that, if God should spare you, and give you opportunity therefor, you would, without delay, set about the necessary work of repentance, and serving him. I cannot but hope, that one and another of you came into some such pious resolution as that, <HI>wherein I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</HI> If I now speak the inward sense and feeling of any of your minds, in that awful hour, as I trust I do; think it not unseasonable, if I urge upon you a care to che∣rish such good impressions as these, and to guard against every thing that may have a tendency to erase them out of your minds: Otherwise your goodness will be as <HI>the morning cloud, and the early dew, which soon pass away.</HI> This was too much the case about eight and twenty years ago, when God arose, and shook the earth more terribly than had been known in the land before. The fears of multitudes were then a∣larmed; they called on God; made fair promises of a reformation; and, for a while, were externally very serious and devout: But they soon lost the impressi∣ons of piety, forgot their good resolutions, and retur∣ned to their former folly. Some, I would hope, were thoroughly humbled, and turned from their sins to God: But, for the generality, their goodness was no∣thing
<PB N="28" REF="007380_0026_102B8CA053CBD730"/>
more than a transient business. As the earth grew quiet, their fears went off, and, together with them, all their concern about the one thing needful. And must it not be said of some, notwithstanding the horrible anguish they were then in, that they after∣wards turned out <HI>abandoned sinners!</HI> The latter end was much worse with them than the beginning. Let me therefore beseech you in the bowels of Christ Jesus, and in his name, to make a wise and good im∣provement of the <HI>warning</HI> God is now giving you, and the <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>concern</HI> you may herefrom have ex∣cited in you. Cultivate the serious sense you have of God and religion on your minds.—Be earnest in your prayers to the throne of grace, for those assistances you will need.—Take care you don't grieve the good spirit of God.—With the <HI>Jailor,</HI> who was made to tremble by the earthquake, which shook the prison he had the charge of, enquire with a becoming sollicitude of soul, <HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> And do not rest satisfied, until you have been enabled, under the influence of the divine spirit, to <HI>believe in the Lord Jesus Christ:</HI> And, to your faith, add all other chri∣stian graces, and live in the daily exercise of them; and you need not then be afraid, let what will come: For you are prepared for all events, whether of time, or eternity.</P>
<P>Though I should be thought tedious, I shall, upon this occasion, address a few words to those, who have made God their fear, and are walking in the way of his commandments. Some such, we would hope, there are among us. The good Lord increase their Number! To you I would say▪ your state is happy: The supreme regent of nature, through Jesus Christ, is your friend. His perfections are all engaged on your behalf. When you hear the noise, and feel the shock of an earthquake, you have no reason to be
<PB N="29" REF="007380_0027_102B8CA2C99552C8"/>
dismayed. <HI>Let not your hearts be troubled;</HI> you <HI>be∣lieve in God,</HI> you <HI>believe in Jesus Christ.</HI> You ought indeed to be possessed of an holy awe and reverence of the power and majesty of God: But you ought not to have upon your minds a slavish fear and dread. It is below your character, and hope; and will argue a low degree of faith; at least, that you have not faith in exercise. Your chief concern should be, to take occasion, from such an extraordinary providence, to be upon your <HI>watch;</HI> to give all diligence to get, and keep yourselves, in a state of actual readiness for the coming of your Lord. <HI>Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing.</HI></P>
<P>I conclude with saying, the shaking of the earth is a lively emblem, and will be one of the amazing fore-runners, of that <HI>awful day of God,</HI> in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the ele∣ments melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein, be burnt up. And since <HI>this day of God</HI> will come, and is hastening upon us, what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conver∣sation and godliness! Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.</P>

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX; Giving a summary Account of the late EARTHQUAKE.</HEAD>
<P>ON the morning, <HI>November</HI> 18th, about 15 minutes after 4, the air calm and the heavens bright, came on the most surprizing shock of an earthquake that was ever felt, so far as we know, in this part of the world. I did not my self perceive any noise distinct from that which was occasion'd by the crackling of the house where I was, and the disturbance of the moveables in it; but many others, and, among these, such as were awake, and had risen from their beds to prosecute their business, say, that it was both preceded, and accompanied, with a considerable noise, like that of distant thunder, or a sudden hard gust of rushing wind. The shock was gradual, increasing in its strength for about a minute. It then very sensibly abated, giving us room to hope it was going off; when, on a sudden, it returned with greater violence than before, so as that our houses heaved, and rocked, as if they would have fallen to pieces. It continued at this height not above half a minute, gradually decreasing till we had no more any perception of it.</P>
<P>There are various opinions concerning the precise <HI>time</HI> of its continuance. Some say, it lasted 4, or 5, or 6 minutes. Others think it was over in one. Those, as I imagine, come nearest to the truth, who fix it at about 3 minutes.</P>
<P>The <HI>effects</HI> were very considerable. Not to mention the fear∣ful clattering that was made by our doors, windows, and walls; nor the damage we received by the breaking of our brittle ware, and the bruising of our pewter, which was thrown from the shelves: I say, passing over these smaller articles, many chimnies, it is tho't several scores, were broken off near the top of our houses, and thrown down. A less number, it may be 20, were cracked thro', all round, a few feet from the top; and some of them strangely dislocat∣ed, and turned from their former position. Perhaps, a 1000 or 1500
<PB N="31" REF="007380_0029_102B8CA66DE1D598"/>
chimnies have been more lightly damaged in various degrees. The roofs of some houses, and the gable ends of a few others as far as the caves, were broken in, either by the violence with which they were shook, or by the falling of the chimnies on them. It is said, that many clocks and watches were stop'd, by the sudden and great agitation that was given them; tho' this was not the case with mine. And some wells have not since yielded any water, the springs that fed them having been, in one way or another, stopped. One more effect worthy of notice, a gentleman has thus published from his personal view of it. "A distiller's cistern, made of plank, almost new, and very strongly put together, was burst to pieces by the agitation of the liquor in it; which was thrown out with such force as to break down one whole side of the shed that defended the cistern from the water, as also to stave off a board or two from a fence, at the distance of 8 or 10 feet from it."</P>
<P>These are the principal effects of this great Earthquake in this town. We now know, that it was of very large extent; reach∣ing from <HI>Casco-Bay</HI> northeastward to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> southwestward, a line, on the sea-coast, of more than 500 miles: And it was felt also <HI>within land</HI> a great way. We have not had accounts as yet from the most distant <HI>English</HI> settlements; but doubtless they had all a very strong perception of it. It does not appear to have been equally violent in all places throughout this extent; tho' it was more so than was ever known before. From <HI>Casco-Bay,</HI> on the northeast, it is said, "the shock was much as we had it in this town." From <HI>Philadelphia</HI> on the southwest, they write, "On Tuesday morning, <HI>Nov.</HI> 18th, we had a smart shock of an earth∣quake, which lasted about two minutes." And in all the interme∣diate places it arose to a surprizing height.</P>
<P>The effects, in many of our towns, were as considerable as in this, if not more so. In <HI>Pembroke,</HI> besides the breaking down of a number of chimnies, there were 4 or 5 chasms, or openings, made in the earth, from whence both water and sand were thrown out. In <HI>Scituate,</HI> near the large dwelling-house of Mr. <HI>Bailey,</HI> there was 7 openings of the ground, which still remain percepti∣ble; one of them within 20 yards of the house, and the whole 7 within a few rods of it. From these have issued large quantities of water, and (at the lowest computation) 10 cart loads of a strange sort of earth, as fine as flower, and of a whiteish com∣plection. The house itself was most awfully shook; the chimney levelled with the roof; most of the ceiling fractured into small parts, and in many places separated from the sides of the rooms; a new case of drawers thr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own, and tho't to be irreparably
<PB N="32" REF="007380_0030_102B8CA7FAC55D48"/>
shatter'd: Besides which, 70 square feet of a firm cellar wall was burst from its former position, and another considerable part of it thrown to the ground. At <HI>Newington,</HI> in <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> there was an eruption, near the house for publick worship, 60 rods long, and 2 feet wide; the most hideous chasm we have yet heard of. In one place and another, the old springs were shut up, and new ones opened; and in all places the stone fences were, more or less, shaken down. The damage, in this article only, is set, moderately computing, at about fifty thousand pounds, in the com∣mon way we reckon money.</P>
<P>The agitation occasioned by this earthquake was not confin'd to the dry-land. The vessels in the harbour of this town, and I sup∣pose in other harbours also, were made fearfully to quiver and shake; and it seemed to those, who were in them, as tho' they were a-ground, and beating upon small ballast. Some that were in the bay, coming in from sea, tho't they had unhappily struck upon the rocks or sands. A gentleman, who came passenger in a vessel from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> says, that, 70 leagues to the east of <HI>Cape-Ann,</HI> they were suddenly surprised, about the time the earthquake came on here, supposing they had run foul of a wreck, or got upon a bar, till, on throwing over the lead, they found they had more than 50 fathom water. As the morning light came on, they saw 3 large whales on the top of the water, and by their continuing perfectly still, they was ready to think, they were dead; tho' they could not reduce this to a certainty, having no bullets to fire at them. They saw also great numbers of other fishes, both great and small; frightened, as it was tho't, from the bottom.</P>
<P>In about an hour and 20 minutes after this great shock, we had another; which, tho' comparatively small, was yet felt by most that were up. And on the 22<SUP>d</SUP> of this same month, at 40 minutes after 8, in the evening, we were alarmed with another still; which, tho' not to be compared with the first, was very affecting to most people. These are all the shocks we have had in this town; tho' elsewhere they have been more numerous. In some places they have felt 5 or 6; in others 10 or 11; &amp; in others still, at least 20.</P>
<P>May we all sing aright both of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>judgment!</HI> And while we <HI>fear</HI> before that God, who maketh the earth to shake and tremble, let us <HI>love</HI> him also for his goodness: And may the <HI>riches</HI> of it, as they have been displayed towards us in our late deliverance from sudden and general destruction, lead us to repentance.</P>
