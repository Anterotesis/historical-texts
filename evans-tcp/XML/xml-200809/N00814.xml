<HEAD>The Tryal of a Saving Interest in CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE there be so many People living under the Ordinances, pre∣tending without ground, to a spe∣cial Interest in Christ, and to His Favour and Salvation, as is clear, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7 22, 23. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.11, 12. <HI>Luk.</HI> 13 24. And since many who have good ground of Claim to Christ, are not e∣stablished in the confidence of His Favour, but remain in the Dark without comfort, hesitating concerning the reality of God∣liness in themselves, and speaking little to the Commendation of Religion to o∣thers, especially in the time of their straits. I shall speak a little to two things of the greatest Concernment.</P>
<P>The one is, <HI>How a person shall know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he hath a true and special interest in Christ;
<PB N="6" REF="000977_0005_0FAE8C88298FBD70"/>
and whether he doth lay lust Claim to Gods Favour and Salvation?</HI></P>
<P>The other is, <HI>In case a person fall short in the aforesaid Tryal, what course he shall take for making sure God; Friendship and Salvation to himself?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>How shall a Man know if he hath a true and special interest in Christ, and whether he hath or may lay claim justly to Gods Favour and Salvation?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. Before we speak directly to the Question, we shall premise some things to make way for the Answer:</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That a mans Interest in Christ, or Gracious State may be known, and that with more certainty than People do con∣jecture; yea, and the knowledge of it may be more easily attained unto, than many do imagine. For, not only hath the Lord commanded men to know their interest in Him, as a thing attainable, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. but many of the Saints have attained unto the clear perswasion of their Interest in Christ▪ and in God, as their own God: How often do they call him their God, and
<PB N="7" REF="000977_0006_0FAE8C88AAC2B760"/>
their Portion? And how perswaded is <HI>Paul</HI> that nothing can separate him from the Love of God? <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.38, 39. Therefore the knowledge of a mans Gra∣cious state is attainable; and this know∣ledge of it, which may be attained, is no fancie and bear conceit, but it is most sure; <HI>Doubtless thou art our Father,</HI> saith the Prophet in name of the Church, <HI>Isa,</HI> 63.16. It is clear thus:</P>
<P N="1">1. That can be no fancy, but a very sure knowledge, which doth yield to a rational man comfort in most real straits: But so doth this. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 30.6. When the People spake of stoning <HI>David,</HI> he encouraged himself in the Lord, <HI>Psal.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 6. He saith there, <HI>he will not be afraid of ten Thousands that rise against him.</HI> Com∣pare these words with <HI>ver.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of that Psalm, <HI>Psal</HI> 27.1.3. <HI>Although as Host en∣camp against him, he is c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That is a sure knowledge of a thing which maketh a wise Merchant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he hath that he may keep it sure; that maketh a man fore go Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tian, Lands, Life, and suffer the spoiling of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyfully▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so doth this, <HI>Mat.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 10.28, 29. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.34. <HI>Rom.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="000977_0007_0FAE8C896BC5A488"/>3. That must be a sure and certain knowledge, and no fancy, whereupon a man voluntarily and freely doth adven∣ture his Soul, when he is stepping in into Eternity with this word in his mouth, <HI>This is all my desire</HI>: But such a know∣ledge is this, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.5. And again, Not only may a Godly man come to the sure knowledge of his Gracious state, but it is more easily attainable than many do apprehend: For (supposing what shall be afterwards proved, that a man may know the gracious work of God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spirit in himself) if he will but argue ra∣tionally from thence, he shall be forced to conclude his interest in Christ, unless he deny clear Scripture truths. I shall only make use of one here, because we are to speak more directly to this after∣wards. A Godly man may argue thus▪ Whosoever receives Christ, are justly reputed the Children of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12. But I have received Christ all the wayes which the Word there can import▪ For, I please the device of Salvation by Christ; I agree to the terms, I welcome the offer of Christ in all His offices, as a King to rule over me; a Priest to offer and interced<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for me; a Prophet to teach
<PB N="9" REF="000977_0008_0FAE8C8D40444490"/>
me; I lay out my heart for Him, and towards Him, resting on Him as I am a∣ble; what else can be meant by the word <HI>Receiving</HI>? Therefore may I say, and conclude plainly and warrantably, I am justly to reckon my self Gods Child, according to the foresaid Scripture which cannot fail.</P>
<P>The Second thing to be premised, is, That a man be savingly in Covenant with God, is matter of highest impor∣tance. It is his Life, <HI>Deut.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.47. And yet very few have or seek after a Saving interest in the Covenant; and many foolishly think, they have such a thing without any solid ground, <HI>Mat.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.14. Few find, or walk in, the narrow way. This should allarum people to be serious about the matter, since it is of so great, Consequence to be in Christ, And since there be but few that may lay just clai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to him, and yet many do foolishly fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y an Interest in him, who are d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by a false confidence, as the <HI>foolish Virgine</HI> do, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.</P>
<P>The Third thing to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Men must resolve to be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined by Scripture in this matter of their interest
<PB N="10" REF="000977_0009_0FAE8C8E2D145438"/>
in Christ. The Spirit speaking in the Scripture, is judge of all Controversies; (<HI>Isa.</HI> 8.20. <HI>To the Law and the Prophets; and if it. speak not according to these, there is no truth in it</HI>) and of this also, whether a man be savingly in Covenant with God or not. Therefore do not mock God while you seem to search after such a thing. If we prove from Scripture (which is the Uncontroverted rule) that you are Gracious, and have stricken Covenant savingly with God, then resolve to grant so much, and to acqueise in it: and if the contray appear, let there be a determination of the Controversie, else you do but mock the Lord, and so your bonds shall be made strong <HI>Isa.</HI> 28.22. For a jot of His Word cannot fail, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.18. Therefore seek Eye-salve from Christ to judge of things according as the Word of God shall discover them to be.</P>
<P>The Fourth thing to be premised, is, Although the matter of a mans Interest in Christ be of so great importance, and the way to attain to the knowledge of it, so plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> held forth in the Scriptures, yet there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but few who reach the distinct knowledge of it.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="000977_0010_0FAE8C8F183A4928"/>And that this may not discourage any Person from attempting it, I shall hint some few Reasons, why so few come to the clear knowledge of it, which will also prepare the way for what is to be spoken afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>The First thing which doth hinder many from the Knowledge of their interest in Christ, is,</HI> Their Ignorance of some special Prin∣ciples of Religion:</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it was free love in Gods bosome, and nothing in Man that moved him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end a Saviour to perfect the work of Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion.</HI> Joh. 3.16. <HI>God so loved the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, that he sent, &amp;c.</HI> Men are still seeking some ground for that business in themselves, which leads away from suit∣able and high apprehensions of the first spring and rise of Gods Covenant-favour to his People, which hath no reason, cause, or motive in us; and so they can∣not come to the Knowledge of their in∣terest.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They are</HI> Ignorant <HI>how that Love d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> effectually discover it self to a mans heart, so as he hath ground to lay Claim to it,</HI> viz. That ordinarily it dot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first discover his
<PB N="12" REF="000977_0011_0FAE8C8FF556EC28"/>
broken state in himself because of Sin and Corruption, defiling the whole man, and any thing in him that may be called a Righteousness: All these things are Loss and Dung <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.6.7.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>It discovereth Christ as the full and satisfying Treasure above all things.</HI> The man finds a treasure for which with joy, he selleth all, <HI>&amp;c. Mat.</HI> 13.44, 46.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>It determineth the heart, and causeth it to approach unto a Living God in the Ordinances, Psal.</HI> 65.4. And causeth the Heart to lay weight upon Him, and Him alone, <HI>Psal.</HI> 62.5. <HI>My Soul wait thou only upon God.</HI> Thus, having drop∣ped in the Seed of God in the heart, and formed Christ there, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.19. the Heart is changed and made new in the foresaid work, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26. And Gods Law is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amped upon the Heart in that change, <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 31.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. that the whole yoke of Christ is commended to the man without exception, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.12, 16. The Law is acknowledged Good, Holy, Just and Spiritual: Upon all which, from that New Principle of Life, there flow out acts of a New Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.6. <HI>Faith works by Love. Rom.</HI> 6.18.22. And the man becometh a Servant of Righteousness
<PB N="13" REF="000977_0012_0FAE8C9067C365C8"/>
and unto God;) which doth especially appear in the Spirituality of Worship, (<HI>Joh.</HI> 4.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.6. — Men then serve God in Spirit and Truth, and in the Newness of the Spirit, and not in the Oldness of the Letter,) and tenderness in all manner of Conversation: The man then exerciseth himself how to keep a Conscience void of offence, <HI>&amp;c. Act.</HI> 24.16. Now, this way doth the love of God discover it self unto man, and acteth on him so as he hath ground of laying some good claim to it; so as he may justly think, that the love which sent a Savi∣our, had respect to such a man as hath found these things made out unto him. Surely, <HI>Ignorance</HI> in this doth hinder man from the knowledge of their interest in Christ: For if a man know not how God worketh with a person, so as he may justly lay claim to His love, which was from Eternity, he will wander in the Dark, &amp; not come to the knowledge of an Interest in Him.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Many are also</HI> Ignorant <HI>of this, that God alone is the Hope of His people.</HI> He is called, <HI>The Hope of Israel, Jer.</HI> 14.8. Although inherent qualifications are evi∣dences of it, yet the staying of the Heart
<PB N="14" REF="000977_0013_0FAE8C90EEE518B0"/>
upon Him, as a full blessing and satis∣fying portion, is FAITH, (1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.21. the Faith and Hope must be in God) and the only proper condition which giveth right to the saving <HI>Blessings</HI> of the Covenant, <HI>Rom,</HI> 4.5. <HI>To him that worketh not, but believeth — Faith is imputed for Righteousness.</HI> Indeed if any person take liberty here, and turn Grace into wantonness, there is without doubt in so far, a Delusion; since there is mercy with Him upon Condition, that it conciliat Fear to him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 130.4. Yea, hardly can any man, who hath the foresaid expressions of Gods Love made out upon him, make a Cloak of the Covenant for sinful Liberty, without some measure of a spiritual Conflict: In this respect, he that is born of God doth not sin; and he who doth so sin, hath not seen God, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.6.9. I say, God is the Hope of His People, and not their own Holiness. If they intend honesty, and long seriously to be like unto Him, many failings should not weaken their Hope and Confidence: For, it is in Him who changeth not, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.6. <HI>And if any man sinneth, he hath an ad∣vocate,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="000977_0014_0FAE8C91B572E838"/>
1 <HI>Joh:</HI> 2.1. Now, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en place their hope in any other thing be∣side the Lord, it is no wonder they be kept in a staggering Condition, accord∣ing to the changes of the thing which they make the ground of their hope, since they give not to God the Glory due to His Name, and which He will not give unto another. Compare, <HI>Psal.</HI> 9.10. (<HI>They who know thy Name, will put their trust in thee,</HI>) with <HI>Isa.</HI> 42.8. <HI>My Glory I will not give unto another: I am the Lord, that is my Name.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Many are ignorant of the different wayes and decrees of Gods working with His People, and it doth much darken their knowledge and reflex acts of their interest in Him.</HI> This ignorance doth run main∣ly on three Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are ignorant of the different de∣grees and wayes of that Law work which ordinarily dealeth with men, and of the different way how the Lord bringeth home people at first to Christ.</HI> They consider not that the Jaylor is not kept an hour in Bondage. <HI>Acts</HI> 16. <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is kept in suspense three dayes, <HI>Act.</HI> 9. <HI>Zacc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> not one moment, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They are ignorant of, or at least do not consider, how indifferent the degrees of San<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fication
<PB REF="000977_0015_0FAE8C9272A2E7E8"/>
are in the Saints, and the honourable appearings thereof before men in some, and the sad blemishing thereof in others.</HI> Some are very blameless, and more free of gross out-breakings, adorning their profession much; as <HI>Job</HI> did, in <HI>Job</HI> 1. and <HI>Zechari∣ah,</HI> in <HI>Luk.</HI> 1. These are said to be per∣fect, walking in all the Commandments of God. Others were subject to very gross and sad Evils, as <HI>Solomon, Asa,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They are ignorant of the different Communications of Gods face, and expressions of His presence.</HI> Some do walk much in the light of Gods Countenance, and are much in sensible Fellowship with Him, as <HI>David</HI> was; others are all their dayes kept in Bondage through fear of Death, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.25. Surely the ignorance of the different wayes of Gods working and dealing with His People, doth very much darken the knowledge of their interest in Him, whilest they usually stint the Lord to one way of working, which he doth not keep, as we have shewed in the for∣mer Examples.</P>
<P>The Second thing which doth darken men about their interest in Christ, is. <HI>There
<PB N="17" REF="000977_0016_0FAE8C9336646870"/>
is one thing or other, wherein their Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in some respect doth Condemn them, as deal∣ing deceitfull and guilefully with God.</HI> It is not to be expected, that these can come to clearness about their interest, whose Heart doth Condemn them for keeping up some known Transgression against the Lord, which they will not let go, nei∣ther are using the means which they know to be appointed by God for deli∣vering them from it; neither can these come to clearness, who know some posi∣tive Duty, Commanded them in their stations, which they deceitfully shift and shun, not closing chearfully with it, or not willing to be led into it. These are also in some respects, Condemned of their own hearts, as the former sort; and in that case it is difficult to come to a distinct knowledge of their State, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.21. It is supposed there, that a Self-condemning Heart maketh void a mans Confidence proportionally beforo God. I do not deny but that men may, on good grounds, plead an Interest in Christ, in the case of prevailing iniqui∣ty, <HI>Psal.</HI> 65.3. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.23, 25. But it is hard to be attained, if at all attainable, when the Heart is dealing deceitfully,
<PB REF="000977_0017_0FAE8C95991EDCC8"/>
and entertaining known guile in a parti∣cular: Therefore l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t people clear them∣selves of the particular which they know too well. It is the thing which doth meet them, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing their confidence and access in all the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> approaches unto God: See <HI>Jud.</HI> 10.10, 13. The idolatries o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the people are cast up to them by the Lord, and their suit rejected there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon.

<PB N="19" REF="000977_0018_0FAE8C9788300608"/>
the Knowledge of an Interest in Christ.</P>
<P>The Third thing which hindereth the knowledge of an Interest in Christ, is, <HI>A Spirit of sloth, and careless negl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gence in ma∣ny.</HI> They complain that they know not whether they be in CHRIST or not: but, as few take pains to be in Him, so few take pains to try if they be in Him. It is a work and business which cannot be done sleeping, 2 <HI>Cor·</HI> 13.5. the seve∣ral words used there, viz. <HI>Examine, Prove, Know</HI> — say, that there is a labour in it; Diligence must be used to make our Calling and Election sure, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. It is a business above Flesh and Blood; The holy Anointing, which teacheth all things, must make us know the things freely given us of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.12. Shall the Lord impart a business of so great concernment, and not so much as be enquired after to do it for men? <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.37. Be ashamed you who spend so much time in reading of Romances, in adorning your Persons, in Hawking and Hunting, in consulting the Law about your outward estate in the world; and it may be in worse things than these: Be ashamed that you spend so little time
<PB REF="000977_0019_0FAE8C98C476D280"/>
in the search of this, <HI>Whether you be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heir of Glory or not; whether you be in the way that leadeth to Heaven, or that which will land you in Darkness forever?</HI> You who judge this be-low you, and unwor∣thy of your pains any part or minute of your time; it is like in Gods account, you have judged your selves unworthy of everlasting Life, so as you have no lot with Gods People in this matter.</P>
<P>The Fourth thing that doth darken the knowledge of an Interest in Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, is, <HI>Men do not condescend upon what would satisfie them.</HI> They complain that God will not shew unto them what He is about to do with them; but cannot yet say, they know what would satisfie about His purpose. This is a sad thing▪ Shall we think those are serious, who have never as yet, pitched on what would satisfie them, nor are making earnest en∣quiry after what should satisfie? If the Lord had left us in the dark in that matter▪ we were less inexcusable: But since the grounds of satisfaction, and the true marks of an interest in Christ, are so clear and frequent in Scripture, and so many things written that our joy may be
<PB N="21" REF="000977_0020_0FAE8C99368D4948"/>
full, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.4. And that those who Be∣lieve may know, that they have Eter∣nal Life, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.13. And since he that Believeth hath a witness of it in him∣self, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.10. None can pretend ex∣cuse here. We may not here insist to shew what may and should satisfie about our Interest, since we are to speak di∣rectly to it afterwards.</P>
<P>The Fifth thing that helpeth much to keep men in the dark about their inte∣rest in Christ, is, <HI>They pitch upon some mutable grounds which are not so opposite proofs of the Truths of an interest in Christ.</HI> As of the comfortable state of a triumph∣ing Soul sailing before the wind, and marks, which I grant are precious in themselves, and do make out an interest clearly where they are. Yet there are such, as without an Interest in Christ may be, and be known also in a good mea∣sure. We shall touch a few of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some think that all who have a true interest in Him, are above the prevailing power of every Sin.</HI> But this is contrary to that of <HI>Psal.</HI> 65.3. where we find that holy Man, laying just claim to Par∣don in the case of prevailing in iniquity: and that of <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.23, 24, 25. where
<PB N="22" REF="000977_0021_0FAE8C99EEA11A70"/>
<HI>Paul</HI> thanketh God through Christ, as freed from the Condemnation of the Law; even whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st a Law in his Mem∣bers leadeth Captive unto Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Some th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk that all the true Saints have constantly access unto God in Prayer, and sensible returns of Prayer at all time.</HI> But this is contrary to the many sad ex∣ercises of His People, complaining often that they are not heard nor regarded of God, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sal.</HI> 13.1. <HI>Psal.</HI> 22.1, 2.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Some think that all who have any true interest in Him, have God witnessing the same unto them, by a high operation of that witnessing Spirit of His,</HI> Rom. 8.16. (where∣of afterwards) <HI>and so they still suspect their own interest in Christ, because of the want of this.</HI> But they do not remember that they must first believe, and give Credit to that record, which God hath given to the Son, That there is Life e∣nough in Him for men, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.10, 11. and then look for the Seal and Witness of the Spirit. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.13. <HI>In whom after ye Believed, ye were Sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise, &amp;c.</HI> As long as people hold fast these Principles, and the like, they can hardly come to the knowledge of their gracious state, which God hath
<PB N="23" REF="000977_0022_0FAE8C9AF7364318"/>
warranted People to prove and clear up to themselves, other wayes than by these foresaid things.</P>
<P>The Fifth thing to be premis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, is, <HI>The removal of some mistakes whereunto people may readily run themselves, when we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e about to prove their inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est in Christ.</HI></P>
<P>As;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is a mistake to think, that every one who is in Christ, doth know that he is in Him.</HI> For many are truly Gracious, and have a good title to Eternal Life, who do not know so much, until it be made out afterwards, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.13. These things are written to Believers, that they may know they have a true title to E∣ternal Life; that is, that they may know they are Believers: and so it is supposed they knew it not before.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is a mistake to think, that all who come to the knowledge of their interest in Christ, do attain an equal certainty about the same.</HI> One may say, he is perswaded, nothing present or to come, can sepa∣rate him from the love of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.38. Another cometh but this length, I believe, help my Unbelief, <HI>Mark</HI> 9.24.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is a mistake to think, that every
<PB N="24" REF="000977_0023_0FAE8C9B8FC21E60"/>
one who attaineth a strong perswasion of his interest, doth alwayes hold there.</HI> For, he who to day may say of the Lord, <HI>He is is his refuge,</HI> Psal. 91.2. and, <HI>his Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> Psal. 119.57. will at another time say, <HI>he is cut off,</HI> Psal. 37.22. and will ask, if the truth of Gods Promise <HI>doth fail for∣evermore?</HI> Psal. 77.7, 8, 9.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>It is also a mistake to think, that every one who doth attain a good knowledge of their Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious state, can formally answer all Ob∣jections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade to the contrary.</HI> But yet they may hold fast the conclusion, and say, I know whom I have believed, 2 <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1.12. There be few grounds of Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Religion, whereof many people are so perswaded, as that they are able to main∣tain them formally against all arguments brought to the contrary, and yet they may and will hold the conclusion sted∣fastly and justly: So it is in this case in hand.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>It is no less a mistake to imagine, that the vain, groundless Confidence which many profane, ignorant Athiests do main∣tain, is this knowledge of an interest in Christ which we plead for.</HI> Many do falsly a∣vow Him to be their Father. <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.41. And many look for Heaven, who will be
<PB N="25" REF="000977_0024_0FAE8C9E23033220"/>
beguiled with those Foolish Virgins, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.12 Yet we must not think because of this, that all knowledge of Interest, is a Delusion and Fancy, although these Fools be Deceived: for whilest thousands are deluded, some can say on good and solid grounds, <HI>We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lieth in wickedness.</HI> 1 Joh. 5.19.</P>
<P>Having premised these things, it now followeth that we give some Marks, by which a man may know if he be Saving∣ly in Covenant with God, and hath a Special Interest in Christ, so as he may warrantably lay claim to Gods Favour and Salvation. We shall only pitch upon two great and principal marks, not wil∣ling to trouble people with many. And before we fall upon these, we will speak of a preparatory work of the Law, where∣of the Lord doth ordinarily make use, to prepare His own way in mens Souls. This may have its own weight, as a mark with some persons. It is called, the work of the Law, or, the work of Humiliation. It hath some proportion to that Spirit of Bondage, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.15. and doth now under the New Testament
<PB N="26" REF="000977_0025_0FAE8C9F06A3C888"/>
answer unto it, and usually leadeth on to the Spirit of Adoption. Only here let it be remembred;</P>
<P N="1">1. That we are not to speak of this preparatory work of the Law, as a N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gative mark of a true interest in Christ. As if none might lay claim to Gods fa∣vour, who hath not had this preparatory work in the several steps of it, as we are to speak of it; for, as we shall hear, the Lord doth not alwayes keep that path with men.</P>
<P N="2">2. The great reason why we speak of it is, <HI>Because the Lord dealeth with many</HI> (<HI>whom He doth effectally Call</HI>) <HI>by some such preparatory work.</HI> And to those, who have been so dealt with, it may prove strengthning; and will confirm them in laying the more weight on the marks which follow.</P>
<P N="3">3. It may help to encourage others, who are under such bondage of spirit, as a good prognostick of a gracious work to follow: for as we shall circumstanciate it, it will be rarely found to miscarry and fail of a gracious issue.</P>
<P N="4">4. Where God useth such a preparatory work, He doth not keep one way or measure in it, as we shall hear.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="000977_0026_0FAE8CA08DC187B8"/>For the more distinct handling of this preparatory work, we shall shortly hint the more ordinary wayes, by which the Lord leadeth people in into the Covenant Savingly, and draweth them unto Christ.</P>
<P>First, <HI>There are some called from the Womb, as</HI> John <HI>the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st was, Luk.</HI> 1.41.44. Or, in their very Young years, be∣fore they can be deeply engaged active∣ly in Satans waves, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15. It can∣not be supposed, that those have such a preparatory work as we are to speak of. And, because some persons may pre∣tend to this way of Effectual Calling, we offer these marks of it, whereby those who have been so called may be con∣firmed.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Such use from their Childhood to be kept free of ordinary Pollutions, where∣with Children usually are defiled; as Swear∣ing, Lying, Mocking of Religion and Reli∣gious persons, &amp;c.</HI> Those whom God Calleth Effectually, He Sanctifieth them from the time of that Effectual Calling. Sin cannot have Dominion over them as over others, because they are under Grace <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Religion is, as it were Natural to
<PB N="28" REF="000977_0027_0FAE8CA0AD78BF40"/>
them.</HI> I mean, they need not be much pressed to Religious Duties, even when they are but Children; They run wil∣lingly that way, because there is an in∣ward principle of Love constraining them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5 14 so as they yield themselves Servants of Righteousness, without outward constraint, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Although such know not when they were first acquainted with God, yet they have afterwards such exercises of spirit befalling, as the Saints in Scripture</HI> (of whose first Conversion we hear not) <HI>do speak of.</HI> They are shut out from God, upon some occasion now and then, and are admitted to come nearer again, (to their appre∣hension.) Their heart is also further broken up, by the Ordinances, as is said of <HI>Lyd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, Act.</HI> 16.14. and ordinarily they do remember, when some special bit of Religion and Duty, or when some Sin, of which they were not taking no∣tice before, was discovered to them. They who can apply these things to them∣selves, have much to say for their effectu∣al Calling from their Youth.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Some are brought in to Christ in a Soveraign Gospel-way.</HI> When the Lord by some few words of love swallow∣ing
<PB N="29" REF="000977_0028_0FAE8CA187660330"/>
up any Law-work, quickly tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a person Prisoner at the first, as He did <HI>Zaccheus, Luk.</HI> 19. and others; who up∣on a word spoken by Christ, did leave all and follow Him: and we hear no noise of a Law-work dealing with them before they closed with Christ Jesus. And because some may pretend to this way of Calling, we shall touch some things most remarkable in that transaction with <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> for their clearing and confirm∣ation.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> He had some desire to see Christ, and such a desire, as made him wave that which some would have judged pru∣dence and discretion, whilest he climbeth up upon a Tree that he might see Him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Christ spake to his Heart, and that word took such hold upon him, that presently with Joy he did accept of Christ<HI>'s</HI> offer, and closeth with Christ as Lord, whilest few of any Note were fol∣lowing Him.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Upon this his Heart doth o∣pen to the poor, although it seems, he was a Covetous man before.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> He hath a due impression of his former wayes, evidencing his respect to <HI>Moses</HI>'s Law, and this he doth signifie
<PB N="30" REF="000977_0029_0FAE8CA23930AFA0"/>
before all the Company then present, not caring to shame himself in such things as (probably) were notour to the world.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Upon all these things, Christ confirmeth and ratifieth the bargain by His Word recommending to him that one∣ness of interest, which behoved to be between him and the Saints, and the thoughts of his own lost Condition, if Christ had not come and sought him and found him: All which are clear, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19 3, — 10. We grant the Lord calleth some so, and if any can lay claim to the special things we have now hinted, they have a good confirmation of Gods dealing with them, from that Scripture: Neither are they to vex themselves be∣cause of the want of a distinct prepara∣tory Law-work, if their Heart have yielded unto Christ. For, a Law-work is not desirable, except for this end. Therefore Christ doth offer Himself di∣rectly in the Scripture, and People are invited to Him: and although many will not come to Him who is the Cauti∣oner, until the Spirit of bondage distress them for their debt; yet if any upon the knowledge of their lost estate, would flee and yield to Christ, none might
<PB N="31" REF="000977_0030_0FAE8CA2F8FE64A0"/>
warrantably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ress a Law-work upon them. As for others, whom Christ per∣swaded by a word to follow Him: what∣soever He did, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>soever He spake to them at His first meeting with them, we must rationally suppose, that then He discovered so much of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own neces∣sity, and His own ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss and excellency to them as made them quit all and run after Him. And if He do so to any, we crave no more, since their is room enough there for the Physician. So that from all this, as some may be confirmed and strengthned, with whom God hath so dealt; So there is no ground nor occa∣sion for deluding Souls to flatter them∣selves in their condition, who remain Ignorant and Senseless of their own Miseries and Christs Alsufficiency, and hold fast deceit.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>There are some brought in to Christ, in a way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more declarative of His F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee Grace, and this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, when He Ef∣fectually calleth men at the hour of Death.</HI> We find somewhat recorded of this way, in that pregnant Example of the Thief on the Cross, <HI>Luke</HI> 23.39, — 45. Al∣though this seems not very pertinent for the purpose in hand; yet we shall speak
<PB N="32" REF="000977_0031_0FAE8CA3A9D44850"/>
a little of it, that on the one hand, men may be sparing to judge &amp; pass Sentence upon either themselves or others, before the last gasp. And we shall so circum∣stantiate it, that, on the other hand, none may dare to delay so great a busi∣ness to the last hour of their Life. We find these things remarkable in that bu∣siness between Christ and the Thief;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The man falleth at odds with his former Companion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He dareth not speak a wrong word of God, whose hand is on him, but Justifieth Him in all that is befallen him.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> He now sees Jesus Christ per∣secuted by the world, without a cause, and most injuriously.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> He discovereth Christ to be a Lord and a King, whilest Enemies seem to have Him at under.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> He believeth a being of Glo∣ry after Death so really, that he prefer∣reth a portion of it to the present safety of his bodily Life, which he knew Christ was able to grant to him at that time, and he might have chosen that with the other Thief.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Although he was much abased in himself, &amp; so humbled, that he pleaded,
<PB N="33" REF="000977_0032_0FAE8CA62D2BA110"/>
but that Christ would remember him; yet he was nobly daring to throw him∣self upon the Covenant, on Life and Death: and he had so much Faith of Christs Al-sufficiency, that he judged a simple remembrance from Christ, would satisfyingly do his business.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> He acquiesed sweetly in the Word which Christ spake to him, for the ground of his Comfort. All which are very clear in the case of that poor dying Man, and do prove a very real work of God upon his Heart. As this example may encourage some to wait for good from God, who cannot as yet lay clear claim to any Gracious work of His Spirit: So we obtest all, as they love their Souls, not to delay their Soul-busi∣ness, hoping for such a cast of Christs hand in end, as too many do: This be∣ing a rare miracle of Mercy, with the Glory whereof Christ did honourably triumph over the ignominy of His cross, a parallel of which we shall hardly find in all the Scripture beside. Yea, as there be but few at all saved, <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.16. and most saved this way: so the Lord hath peremptorily threatned to laugh at the Calamity, and not to hear the Cry
<PB N="34" REF="000977_0033_0FAE8CA85D86BB28"/>
of such as mocked formerly at His re∣proof, and would not hear when He called to them: <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.24, 26. which Scripture, although it doth not shut Mer∣cies door upon any who at the hour of Death do sincerely judge themselves and flee to Christ, as this penitent Thief did: yet it is certain, it implyeth that very few who sit the offer until then, are honoured with Repentance as he was. And so their Cry as not being sincere and of the right stamp, shall not be heard.</P>
<P>The Fourth and most Ordinary way, by which many are brought in to Christ' is, <HI>By a clear and discernable work of the Law and Humiliation, which we ordinarily call,</HI> The Spirit of Bondage, <HI>as was h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted before.</HI> We do not mean, that every one whose Conscience is awakened with Sin and fear of Wrath, doth really close with Christ, the contrary doth appear in <HI>Cain, Saul, Judas &amp;c.</HI> but there is a convicti-of Sin, awakening of Conscience, and work of Humiliation, which, as we shall circumstantiate it, doth rarely miscarry or fail of a gracious issue, but ordina∣rily doth resolve into the Spirit of A∣doption, and a Gracious work of Gods
<PB N="35" REF="000977_0034_0FAE8CA9488CB0B0"/>
Spirit. And because the Lord dealeth with many Sinners this way, and we find that many are much puzled about the giving judgment of this Law-work.</P>
<P>This work is either more violent and suddenly expede, or it is more sober and lent, protracted through a greater length of time, and so as the steps of it are very discernable. It is more violent in some, as in the Jaylor, <HI>Paul,</HI> and some other Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erts in the Book of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> on whom Christ did break in at an instant, and fell on them as with fire and sword and led them Captive terribly. And because some great legal shakings are deceitful and turn to nothing, if not worse, we shall point at some things remarkable in these Converts, spoken of before, which did prove the work of the Law on them to have had a gracious issue and result.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Some word of truth or dispen∣sation, putteth the person to a dreadful stand, with a great stir in the Soul: Some are pricked in heart, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.37. some fell on trembling, <HI>Act.</HI> 16.29. and this is such a stir, that the person is brought to his wits end; <HI>What wilt thou have me to do,</HI> faith <HI>Paul</HI>? Act. 9. <HI>What
<PB N="36" REF="000977_0035_0FAE8CA9AB55EEE0"/>
shall I do,</HI> faith the Jaylor? <HI>Act.</HI> 16.30.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI> The person is content to have Salvation and Gods Friend-ship on any terms; as the Questions do import, <HI>What shall I do?</HI> As if he had said, What would I not do? What would I not forego? What would I not undergo?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The person accepteth the con∣dition offered by Christ and His Servants, as is clear in the fore-cited Scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The person presently be∣cometh of one interest with the Saints, joyning himself with that persecuted so∣ciety, putting respect on those, whom he had formerly persecuted, joyning and continuing with them in the profes∣sion of Christ on all hazards. Those with whom the Lord hath so dealt, have much to say for a gracious work of Gods spirit in them: and it is like, many of them can date their work from such a particular time and word, or dispensation, and can give some account of what, past between God and them, and of a sensible Change following in them from that time forward, as <HI>Paul</HI> giveth a good account of the work and way of God with him afterwards, <HI>Act.</HI> 22.</P>
<P>Again, the Lord sometimes carrieth

Yet for Answer to the Ob∣jection, I shall offer some things, which rarely will be found in the stirrings of Reprobates, and which are ordinarily found in that Law-work, which hath a gracious issue.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Convictions of Hypocrites and Re∣probates, are usually confined to some few very gross Transgressions. Saul</HI> grants no more but the Persecuting of <HI>David,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 26.21. <HI>Judas</HI> grants only the be∣traying of innocent Blood, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.4. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sually those Convictions, by which the Lord prepareth His own way in the Soul, although they may begin at one or more particular Transgressions, yet they sist not, but the man is led on to see many breaches of the Law, and in∣numerable Evils compassing him as <HI>David</HI> speaketh in the sight of his sin, <HI>Psal.</HI> 40.12. And withal, that universal Conviction (if I may call it so) is not general, as usually we hear senseless Men saying, that in all things they Sin: But is particular and condescending, as <HI>Paul</HI> afterwards make of himself; he not only is the chief
<PB N="51" REF="000977_0050_0FAE8D24B9B80810"/>
of Sinners, but particularly, he was a <HI>Blas∣phemer,</HI> a <HI>Persecuter,</HI> 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.13.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The Convictions which Hypocrites have do seldom reach their Corruption, and that Body of Death, which breeds an averseness from what is good, and strongly inclineth to what is evil.</HI> Ordinarily where we find Hypocrites speaking of themselves in Scripture, they speak loftily and with some self-conceit, both as to their free∣dom from Corruption. <HI>Joh.</HI> 9.34. The Pharisees say to the Poor man, <HI>Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us</HI>? (As if they themselves were not as Corrupt by Nature as he.) They speak of great sins <HI>Hazael</HI> did, 2 <HI>King,</HI> 8.13. <HI>Am I a Dog that I should do this great thing?</HI> And also in their undertakings of Duty, as that man spake, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.19. <HI>I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</HI> See how the people do speak, <HI>Jer.</HI> 42.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. They undertake to do all that God will comand them. So that they still go about in any case to establish their own Righteousness, not submitting unto the Righteousness of God. But I may say, That convictions and exercise about Corruption, and that body of Death, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to evil, and disenabling for good
<PB N="52" REF="000977_0051_0FAE8D258316B1F8"/>
is not the least part of the work, where the Lord is preparing his own way. They use to judge themselves very wretched because of a Body of Sin, and are at their wits end how to be delivered, as <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh when he is under the ex∣ercise of it afterwards, <HI>Romans</HI> 17.19.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It will ordinarily be found, that the Convictions which are in Hypocrites, either are not so serious, as that some other business will not put them out of head before any satis∣faction be gotten.</HI> As in <HI>Cain,</HI> who went and built a City, and we hear no more of his Convictions, <HI>Gen.</HI> 4. <HI>Felix</HI> went a∣way until a more convenient time, and we hear no more of his Trembling, <HI>Act.</HI> 24.25. Or, if that work become very serious, then it runneth to the other ex∣tremity and despair of relief, leaving no room for any out-gate. So we find <HI>Ju∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as</HI> very serious in his Convictions, yet he grew desperate and hanged himself, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.4, 5. But where the Lord pre∣pareth His own way, the work is both so serious, as the person cannot be put off it, (until he find some satisfaction) and yet under that very seriousness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h open for relief! both which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lear in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aylors we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<P>I still fear I have not so thorow a sight of my Sin and Misery, as the Lord giveth to many whom He effectually Calleth, especially to great Transgressors such as I am?</P>

<HEAD>Answ.</HEAD>
<P>It is true, the Lord discovereth to some, great sights of their Sin and Mi∣sery, and they are thereby put under great legal Terrors. But as all are not brought in by that sensible prepara∣tory Law-work, (as we shew before) so even those who are dealt with after that way, are very differently and vari∣ously exercised in regard of degrees of Terror, and of continuance of that work; The <HI>Jaylor</HI> hath a violent work of a very short continuance▪ <HI>Paul</HI> hath a work continuing three dayes. Some persons are in bondage through fear of Deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="56" REF="000977_0053_0FAE8D26F9C09F48"/>
all their dayes, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2 So that we must not limit the Lord to one way of working here. The main thing we are to look unto in these legal awakenings and con∣victions of Sin and Misery, is, If the Lord reach those ends in us, for which usually these stirrings and convictions are sent into the Soul; and if those ends be reach∣ed, it is well; we are not to vex our selves about any preparatory work further. Now, those ends which God driveth or∣dinarily with Sinners by these legal ter∣rors and awakenings of Conscience, are Four;</P>
<P>First, <HI>The Lord discovers sights of mens Sin and Miser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, to chase them out of themselves and to put them out of conceit of their own Righteousness.</HI> Men Naturally have great thoughts of themselves, and do incline much to the Covenant of Works. The Lord therefore doth dis∣cover to them so much of their Sin and Corruption, even in their best things, that they are made to loath themselves, and to despair of relief in themselves; and so they are forced to flee out of them∣selves, and from the Covenant of works, to seek refuge elsewhere, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.18. They become Dead to themselves and
<PB N="57" REF="000977_0054_0FAE8D27AB9A46F8"/>
the Law, as to the point of Justification. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.4. Then have they no more con∣fidence in the flesh, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.3. This is supposed in the offers of Christ coming to seek and save that which is lost, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.10. and to be a Physician to those who are Sick, <HI>Mat</HI> 9.12.</P>
<P>The Second great end, is, <HI>To commend CHRIST JESƲS to mens Hearts above all things</HI>: That so they might fall in Love with Him, and betake themselves to that Treasure and Jewel, which only enricheth, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.44. and by so doing may serve the Lords design in the con∣trivement of the Gospel, which was the manifestation of His Free Grace through Christ Jesus, in the Salvation of men. The sight of a mans own misery and Damnable estate by Nature, is a ready way to make him prize Christ highly, who alone can set such a wretch at liber∣ty. Yea, it not only leadeth a man to an high esteem of Christ, but also of all things that relate to that way of Salvati∣on, as Grace, New-Covenant, Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and maketh him carefully to gather and treasure up his <HI>Michtams</HI> or Golden Scrip∣tures, for the confirmation if his interest in these things.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="000977_0055_0FAE8D2BB0516668"/>The Third great end, is, <HI>To deter and scare people from Sin, and to make them cast-out with it, and consent to put their neck under all His yoke.</HI> God kindleth some sparks of Hell in mens bosomes by the discovery of their sin, as a ready means to make them henceforth stand in awe, knowing how bitter a thing it is to depart from the Lord. <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.19. So we find rest offered to the weary, upon condition they will allow no peaceable abode to <HI>Belial,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.17, 18.</P>
<P>The Fourth great end, is, <HI>To work up men to a patient and thankful submission to all the Masters pleasure.</HI> This is a singular piece of work, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.63. then shalt thou not open thy mouth any more. The sight of a mans own vileness and deservings, maketh him silent, and lo lay his hand on his mouth whatever God doth unto him: Psal. 39.9. <HI>I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, because thou did it.</HI> Ezra 9.13. <HI>God hath punished us less then our iniquities.</HI> Mic. 7.9. <HI>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned.</HI> The man careth not what God doth to him, or how He deal with him, if He save him from the Wrath to come. Also, any Mercy is a large mercy to him,
<PB N="59" REF="000977_0056_0FAE8D2CE2494C48"/>
who hath seen such a sight of himself, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.10. he is less than the least of mercies: any crumb falling from the Masters Table is welcome, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. He thinks it rich mercy that he is not consumed, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.22· This is the thing that marvellously maketh His poor crossed People so silent under and satisfyed with their lot; Nay they think he deserveth Hell who openeth his mouth at any thing God doth to him, since He hath Pardoned his Transgressions. So then, for satis∣fying the Objection, I say, If the Lord hath driven thee out of thy self, and commended Christ to thy heart above all things, and made thee resolve on His strength to wage war with every known Transgression, and thou art, in some measure, as a weaned Child, acquiesing in what He doth unto thee, desiring to lay thy hand on thy mouth thankfully: Then thy Convictions of sin and misery, and whatsoever thou dost plead as a pre∣paratory work, is sufficient, and thou art to debate no more about it; only be advised to study new discoveries of the sense of thy lost condition every day, because of thy old and new Sins, and also to see fresh help in Christ, who is a Prie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="60" REF="000977_0057_0FAE8D2E4C256000"/>
forever to make intercession, and to have the work of Sanctification and Patience with Thankfulness renewed &amp; quickened often, for somewhat of that work, which abaseth thee, exalteth Christ, and con∣formeth to His Will, must convey thee throughout all thy Life Time in this world.</P>
<P>We come now to speak of some more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and sure marks, by which men may take up their Gracious state and Interest in Christ.</P>
<P><HI>The First thing whereby men may know it, is, Their cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng with Christ in the Gospel, wherein He is held forth.</HI> This is Believing, or Faith, which is the condition of the Covenant, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.16. It is of Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Act. 16.31. <HI>Believe — and thou shalt be Saved.</HI> Now, although in propriety of Speech, it is hard to prove an Interest by Faith, it being our very Interest in Him; yet the hearts closing with Christ Jesus, is so discernable in it self, that it may well place it amongst the marks of a Gra∣cious state: And if a man can make out this, that he believeth on, &amp; in Christ Je∣sus, he thereby doth prove a very true interest in Him. Many do scare at this,
<PB N="61" REF="000977_0058_0FAE8D2E75D14860"/>
is a mark upon one of these three grounds ordinarily.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Some conceive Faith to be a diffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mysterious thing, hardly attainable.</HI> To these I say, Do not mistake: Faith is not so difficult as many do apprehend it to be. I grant, True Faith in the meanest degree, is the gift of God, and above the power of Flesh and Blood: For, God must draw men to Christ, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.29. <HI>Job.</HI> 6.44. Yet it were a reflection upon Christ, &amp; all He hath done, to say, It were a matter of insuperable difficulty, as is clear, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.6, — 11. It were according to that Scripture, as much upon the matter, as to say, Christ came not from Heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not Risen from the Dead, or Ascended victorious to Heaven. I say, He hath made the way to Heaven most easie; and Faith, which is the condition requi∣red on our part, more easie then men do imagine.</P>
<P>For the better understanding of this, Consider, That justifying Faith, is not to believe that I am Elected, or, to believe that God loveth me, or that Christ dyed for me, or the like. These things are indeed very difficult and almost impos∣sible at the first hand to be wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by
<PB N="62" REF="000977_0059_0FAE8D2F39986280"/>
those who are Serious; whilest Natural Athiests, and deluded Hypocrites, find no difficulty in asserting all those things. I say, True justifying Faith is not any of the foresaid things; neither is it simply the Believing of any sentence that is written, or that can be thought upon. I grant, he that believeth or Christ Je∣sus, believeth what God hath said about mans Sinful Miserable condition by Na∣ture, and he believeth that to be true, that there is Life in the Son, who was Slain, and is Risen again from the Dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But none of these, nor the believing of many such Truths, do speak out justi∣fying Faith, or that Believing on the Son of God spoken of in Scripture: for, then it were simply an act of the Understand∣ing. But true Justifying Faith, which we now seek after, as a good mark of an Interest in Christ, is chiefly and princi∣pally an act or work of the heart and will, having presupposed sundry things about Truth in the understanding, with the Heart it is believed unto Salvation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.10. And although it seem (<HI>ver.</HI> 9. of that Chapter) that a man is Saved upon condition that he believe this truth, <HI>GOD Raised CHRIST from the Dead</HI>;
<PB N="63" REF="000977_0060_0FAE8D2FEDBF7CA0"/>
yet we must understand another thing there, (and <HI>ver.</HI> 10.) than the believing the truth of that Proposition: For, be∣sides that, all Devils have that Faith whereby they believe that God Raised Christ from the Dead. So the Scripture hath clearly resolved Justifying Faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a receiving of Christ, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12. The receiving of Christ is there explain∣ed to be the believing on his Name. It is still called a staying on the Lord, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.3. A trusting in God, often mentioned in the <HI>Psalms</HI>; and the word is a leaning on him. It is a believing on Christ, <HI>Joh</HI> 1.12. and often so exprest in the <HI>New-Testament.</HI> When God maketh men be∣lieve Savingly, He is said to draw them unto Christ; and when the Lord inviteth them to believe, He calleth them to come to Him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6▪ 37, 44. The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man finding a Jewel, wherewith he falleth in Love, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4, —46. Now, I say, this acting of the Heart on Christ Jesus, is not so difficult a thing, as is conceived. Shall that be judged a mysterious difficult thing, which doth consist much in desire? If men have but an appetite, they have it; for, they are blessed that Hunger after Righteou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ness,

<HI>Mat.</HI> 5.6. If you will, you are wel∣come, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.17. It is a matter of such intricacy, and insuperable difficulty, greedily to look to that exalted Saviour. <HI>Isa.</HI> 45.22. and to receive a thing that is offered, held forth and declared to be mine, if I will but accept and take it, and in a manner open my mouth and give way to it: Such a thing is Faith, <HI>Psal.</HI> 81 10. if not less. Oh if I could perswade people what is Justifying Faith, which impropriateth Christ to me! We often scare people from their just rest and quiet, by making them apprehend Faith to be some deep mysterious thing, and by moving unnecessary doubts about it, whereby it is needlesly darkned.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Some make no use of this mark, as Judging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a high presumptuous Crime, to pretend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so excellent a thing as is the very condition of the New-Covenant.</HI> To these, I say, You need not startle so much at it, as if it were high Pride to pretend unto it: For, whatsoever true Faith be, men must resolve to have it, or nothing at all; all other marks are in vain without it; a thousand things besides, will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness: Unless a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believe,

he abideth in the state of Condemnati∣on, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.18.36.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Others do not meddle with this noble mark of Faith, because they judge it a work of greatest difficulty, to find out Faith where it is.</HI> To these, I say, It is not so diffi∣cult to find it out, since he that believeth, hath the witness in himself, 1. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.10 It is a thing which by some serious search may be known. Not only may do much to find it out by the preparatory work going before it in many; as the appre∣hending and believing of a mans lost estate, and that he cannot do his own bu∣siness, and that there is satisfying fulness in Christ, very desirable, if he could o∣vertake it. A serious minding of this, with a Heart laid open for relief: As also, by the ordinary companions and concomitants of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the liking of Christs Dominion, His Kingly and Pro∣phetical Office, a desire to resign my self wholly up to Him, to be at His disposing. As also, by the native Consequences of it, <HI>viz.</HI> the assoyling of the Word, the assoyling of my own Conscience accord∣ing to the Word, a Heart-purifying work, a working by Love, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I say, not only may we know Faith by these
<PB N="66" REF="000977_0063_0FAE8D37A839BEA8"/>
things, but it is discernable by it self, and of its own Nature; although I <HI>deny</HI> not, but there must be some help of Gods Spirit, by which we know what is freely given unto us of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.12. As also, that God hath allowed <HI>many</HI> evidences and marks, as precious helps <HI>whereby men may</HI> clear up Faith more ful∣ly to themselves, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.13. Yet I still say, that Faith, or Believing, which is some acting of the Heart upon Christ in the Gospel, and the transacting with him there, is discernable of it self, and by it self, to a judicious understanding person, with an <HI>ordinary</HI> influence of the Spirit; unless the Lord, for reasons known to Himself, do overcloud a mans reflex light, by which he should take up and perceive what is in him.</P>
<P><HI>This Justifying Faith which we assert to be so discernable, is, in the Lords deep wis∣dom and Gracious condescendency, variously exprest in Scripture, according to the diffe∣rent actings of it upon God, and outgoings after Him; so as every one who hath it, may find and take it up in his own mould.</HI> It sometimes acteth by a desire of Union with him in Christ. This is that <HI>Looking</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 45.22. This seems to be
<PB N="67" REF="000977_0064_0FAE8D398F9A2FB8"/>
a we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct of Faith, and far below other actings of it at other ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, perhaps in that same person. Men will look to what they dare not approach (to their appre∣hension) which they dare not touch or embrace▪ They may look to one, to whom t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y dare not speak. Yet God hath made the Promise to Faith in that acting, as the fore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited Scripture doth shew; and this He hath done mercifully and wisely, for this is the only discern∣able way of the acting of Faith of some persons sometimes: Such are the actings or out-goings of Faith exprest in Scrip∣ture, by <HI>Hungring &amp; Thirsting after Righ∣teousness, Mat.</HI> 5.6. and that exprest by <HI>Willing, Rev.</HI> 22.17.</P>
<P>Again, This Faith goeth out sometimes in the act of recumbenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or leaning on the Lord, the Soul taking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p Christ then as a resting sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and God hath so held HIM out, although HE be a stumbling stone to others, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. This acting of it, is hinted in the expressions of <HI>Trusting</HI> &amp; <HI>Staying</HI> on God, so often mentioned in Scripture; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>racious Promises are made to this acting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Faith: as <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.3, 4. <HI>God will keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> imperfect peace whose minds are stayed
<PB N="68" REF="000977_0065_0FAE8D399559D9D0"/>
on Him</HI>; because such do trust in Him. <HI>Trust in the Lord; for with Him is ever∣lasting strength.</HI> So, <HI>Psal.</HI> 125.1. <HI>They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zi∣on, which abideth forever.</HI> I say, the Lord hath made Promises to this way of Faiths acting, as knowing it will often go out after Him in this way with many persons, and this way of its acting will be most discernable to them. It goeth out after God sometimes by an act of waiting when the Soul hath somewhat depending be∣fore God, and hath not got out his mind satisfyingly about that thing; then Faith doth wait, and so it hath the Pro∣mise, <HI>Isa,</HI> 49.23. Sometimes it acteth in a wilful way upon the Lord, when the Soul apprehendeth God thrusting it away, and threatning its ruine; So <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b</HI> 13.15 <HI>Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.</HI> The Faith of that poor woman, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.22.28. so highly commended by Christ, did go out in this way of wilful acting o∣ver difficulties; and the Lord speaketh much good of it, and to it; because some will be put to it, to exercise Faith that way sometimes, and so they have that for their encouragement. It were tedious to instance all the several wayes of the
<PB N="69" REF="000977_0066_0FAE8D39B2701FE8"/>
acting of Faith upon, and its exercise a∣bout, and outgoings after Christ. I may say, according to the various conditions and pressures of the Soul of man, the Lord hath variously held out Himself, and His Fulness in Christ under divers notions, as might most fitly meet the distress or condition of Man; and accordingly Faith which God hath appointed to traffick and travel between Christ and Man, as the Instrument of conveyance of His ful∣ness unto man, and of maintaining Uni∣on and Communion, with Him, acteth variously and differently upon God in Christ: For, Faith is the very shaping out of a mans Heart according to Gods device of Salvation by Christ Jesus, in whom it <HI>pleased the Father that Fulness should dwell.</HI> So that let Christ turn what way He will, Faith airteth and pointeth that way. Now, He turneth all wayes in which He can be useful to poor man, and therefore Faith acteth ac∣cordingly on Him for drawing out of that fulness, according to a mans case and condition.</P>
<P>As for Example, The Soul is naked, destitute of a covering to keep it from the storm of Gods Wrath; Christ is fine
<PB N="70" REF="000977_0067_0FAE8D3A8C3E0C68"/>
Raiment, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17, 18. Then accord∣ingly, Faith's work here is to put on the Lord Jesus, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.27. The Soul is hun∣gry and thirsty after somewhat that may Everlastingly satisfie; Christ Jesus is Milk, Wine, Water, the Bread of Life, and the true Manna, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1, 2. <HI>Joh.</HI> 6 48, 51. He is the Feast of fat things, and of wine refined, <HI>Isa.</HI> 25.6. Then the work and exercise of Faith, is, to go buy, eat and drink abundantly, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.53, 57. The Soul is pursued for Guilt more or less &amp; is not Law-biding: Christ Jesus is the City of Refuge and the High-Priest there, during whose Life-time (that is forever) the poor man, who wins thither, is safe. Then the work and exercise of Faith is, to flee thither for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope set before us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.18. In a word, what∣soever way He may benefit poor man, so He speaketh of Himself; and as He hold∣eth out Himself in the Scripture, so Faith doth point towards Him. If He be a Bridegroom, Faith will go out in a Mar∣riage Relation▪ If He be a Father, Faith pleadeth the man to be a Child; If He be a Shepherd, Faith pleads the man may be one of His Sheep: If He be a Lord,
<PB N="71" REF="000977_0068_0FAE8D3B38F5CD68"/>
Faith calleth Him so, which none can do but by the Spirit of Jesus: If He be Dead and Risen again for our Justification, Faith believeth God hath raised Him on that account, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.9. Wheresoever <HI>He</HI> be, there would <HI>Faith</HI> be; and what∣soever <HI>He</HI> is, <HI>Faith</HI> would be somewhat proportionally. For, by <HI>Faith</HI> the heart is shapen out in breadth &amp; length for Him: Yea, when the fame and report of Him goeth abroad in His Truth, although <HI>Faith</HI> see not much, yet it believeth on His Name, upon the very fame He hath sent abroad of Himself, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12.</P>
<P>But here for avoiding of mistakes, Con∣sider,</P>
<P><HI>First; <HI>That although Justifying Faith acteth so variously, yet every Reliever, who hath a good Title to Jesus Christ, hath not all these various actings &amp; exercises of Faith; for, his condition craveth them not: and also the Master is pleased not to lead our the Faith of some persons at sometimes in some of these wayes,</HI></HI> (for reasons known to Him∣self) <HI>even when their necessity</HI> (to their apprehension) <HI>calleth for such acting of Faith.</HI> Surely every one dare not say, <HI>Though He kill me, yet will I trust in Him</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="000977_0069_0FAE8D3BF58E05A0"/>
Many would not have gone up with that woman I spoke of, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15. but would have been discouraged and quit the pur∣suit. It is on this account that Christ doth highly commend the faith of some be∣yond the faith of others, <HI>Mat</HI> 8.10. <HI>Mat</HI> 15.28. Many good people are much dis∣quieted about their Faith, because it go∣eth not out in all those wayes we find recorded in Scripture: But there is hard∣ly any man will be found, whose faith acteth all these wayes.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly; <HI>Many of these actings of Faith are much intended and remitted.</HI></HI> They are sometimes Strong and Vigorous, and discernable, and sometimes they fail, and misbelief doth prevail; so as it were an uncertain thing to judge of a mans state by these. We find the Saints very dif∣ferent from themselves in regard of the actings of Faith sometimes, as we shewed before.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly; <HI>Each one of these actings of Faith, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>keth good to the person in whom it is and hath Promises annexed unto it, as we have said.</HI></HI></P>
<P>Yet,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly; <HI>Although these actings of Faith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave Promises annexed unto them, they are
<PB N="73" REF="000977_0070_0FAE8D3CAC0F0998"/>
not for that, the condition of the New-Co∣venant: for then every one behoved to have each one of them, which is not true as we said before.</HI></HI> A Promise is made to him who overcometh, but perseverence is not the condition of the New-Covenant, but doth suppose it. There are Promises made to the exercise of all Graces in Scripture; but only Faith is the con∣dition of the Covenant. I say then, these Promises are made to these actings of Faith, not as such, but as they do suppose Justifying Faith, which is the Covenant. All these are actings of Faith, but not as it is Justifying.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly; <HI>There is somewhat common to all Gracious persons, which may be supposed by all the foresaid actings of Faith, wherein the nature &amp; essense of Justifying Faith stand∣eth; and this is the hearts satisfaction about Gods device of Salvation by Christ; when man pleaseth Gods invention of satisfaction to Justice through Jesus Christ, in whom all fulness doth dwell now by the Fathers plea∣sure; when the Soul and Heart of man ac∣quiese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in that, then it Believeth unto Sal∣vation.</HI></HI> As at first the Lord made man suitable unto the Covenant of Works,
<PB N="74" REF="000977_0071_0FAE8D3DB5EAF698"/>
by Creating him perfect, and so putting him in a capacity to perform His Will in that Covenant. So under the New-Covenant, when God giveth the New Heart to man, He sets the <HI>Idea</HI> and <HI>Stamp</HI> of all His device in the New-Covenant upon the man, so as there is a consonan∣cy to Gods will there: Thus he beareth the Image of the Second <HI>Adam,</HI> CHRIST JESUS on him. This is a great part of the new heart, and is most opposed to works. Since now the man absolutely falleth off works, becoming Dead to the Law (as to the point of Justification) by the Body of Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.4. Many perceiving that God hath devised a way of satisfying Divine justice, and recover∣ing lost man by the Incarnation of Christ, he thinks this so good and sure a way, that he absolutely giveth up with the Law, as I said before, and closeth with this device: and this is Believing or Faith, very opposite to works and all resting thereupon. This cannot fail to be in all Gracious persons, in whom many of the actings of Faith are not to be found.

the alone sufficient relief; this imports a sort of impropriation: for the heart pleasing that device, in so far swayeth towards it. This is a thing clearly sup∣posed in all the actings of faith, spoken of before. He that greedily hungereth, hath this; and he that leaneth, hath this, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is to esteem Christ the Wisdom and the Power of God to Salvation; so is He said to be to all that believe, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1, 24 they esteem that device wise and sure, beseeming God, and that is to believe. On this account, Christ who is the re∣jected stone to many, is <HI>Precious to them who believe</HI>; a fit stone to recover, for∣tifie and beautifie the tottering building and fabrick of lost man, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. The Kingdom of God is like a man finding a treasure, which with joy he selleth all; <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.44. These words hold out the very way of believing, <HI>viz.</HI> Salvation is discovered in the Gospel to be by Christ; the heart valueth that invention as satis∣fying. This is to believe on the Son of God lifted up, which is compared with the looking to the Brasen Serpent, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.14. It was mans approbation of that device which made it effectual for his healing. So it is here; he that believet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="76" REF="000977_0073_0FAE8D42960FD3C0"/>
setteth to his Seal that God is true. True, wherein? In that record He hath born, that God hath provided Life for men, &amp; placed it all in Christ 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.10, 11. <HI>He that believeth not, maketh God a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar.</HI> Wherein? In His saying that Christ is a safe and sure way to Heaven. This is the pleasing and acquiesing in that device, and it is consonant to all, I know spoken of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustifying Faith in Scripture. This is the believing on Christ &amp; on His Name, the receiving of Him and resting on him for Salvation, in our Catechism. The be∣lieving that Jesus is the CHRIST, that is, the <HI>Anointed One,</HI> whom the Fa∣ther hath <HI>Sealed,</HI> &amp; set apart, and qualifi∣ed for the work of Reconciling Man unto God; and, <HI>he that believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God,</HI> 1 Joh 5.1. <HI>This is to believe with the Heart, that God hath raised Christ from the Dead.</HI> The man believeth Christ Died, and is Raised on the account of satisfaction for mans Transgression; Devils may believe that. Nay, but the man I speak of, <HI>believeth it with his Heart,</HI> (which no Natural man doth, until a new heart be given to him) that is, he cordially pleaseth, is satisfyed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith, and acquieseth in this noble inven∣tion.
<PB N="77" REF="000977_0074_0FAE8D441EFCC510"/>
And this Faith laveth out it self now and then in its actings, out-goings and exercises, according to all the Cove∣nant relations, under which Christ is held forth in the Scripture.</P>
<P>Now, I say, this Faith is discernable, not only in these actings many times; a man may know if his heart doth hun∣ger after Christ, and flee for refuge to him when pursued, and if he doth com∣mit himself unto God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But also in its very Nature; as it is justifying it is discernable and may be known. A man may clearly know, if from known distress in himself upon the report and fame of Christs fulness, his heart doth please Gods device in the New-Covenant, if if goeth out after Christ in that invention, and pleaseth Him as Lord of the Life of men, terminating and resting there, and no where else, acquiesing in that contrive∣ment with desire and complacency. This is a discernable thing. Therefore I ob∣test men impartially to examine them∣selves, and if they find that their heart is closed so with that device of Salvation, and is gone out after Him as precious, that thereupon they conclude a sure and true interest in Christ Jesus, and a go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>To say nothing of that thought of your heart, [whereby you wonder that any man should not please the device of Salvation by Christ, &amp; lead out towards him] as a very promising thing, and speaking out justifying Faith to be in your bosome; and to say nothing in contra∣diction to that which you think, that a Natural man, whilest such, and before he get a New Heart, can please that device, and believe with his heart, and affecti∣onately, that which perfectly overthrow∣eth the Covenant of works, and abaseth man in the point of Self-righteousness already attained, or that can be won at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, which is inconsistent with many
<PB N="79" REF="000977_0076_0FAE8D45B06F5290"/>
Scriptural truths. I offer these differen∣ces between the Faith of all Hypocrites or Reprobates, and that true saving justi∣fying Faith, whereof we have spoken.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They never close with Jesus Christ</HI> (in that device) <HI>and Him alone as a suf∣ficient covering of the eyes, as is said of</HI> A∣braham <HI>to</HI> Sarah, <HI>Gen.</HI> 20.16. They still hold fast somewhat of their own, at least to help to procure Gods favour and sal∣vation: Their heart doth still speak, as that Young mans speech, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.18, 21. doth insinuate, what want I that I may inherit Life? Besies that, they do still retain their former Lovers, and will not break their Covenants with Hell and Death, imagining they may have Christ with these things equally sharing in their heart; contrary to that, <HI>A man cannot serve two Masters, Mat.</HI> 6.24. Either Christ must be judged absolute Lord, and worthy to be so, or nothing at all. And so it is clear, their heart is not shapen out for that device of Salvati∣on by Christ, whom God hath alone made Lord here, in whom all fulness shall dwell. But where justifying Faith is, the Soul of a man and his Heart doth close with Christ, and him alone, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="80" REF="000977_0077_0FAE8D46739E5EE8"/>
confidence in the flesh, <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</HI> 3.3 <HI>Psal.</HI> 62.5. he trusteth only in God. As also the man here giveth up with other Lovers, as they compete with Christ, they resolve not to be for another, <HI>Hos.</HI> 3.3. They call him <HI>Lord,</HI> which a man can only do by the Spirit of Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As Hypocrites and Reprobates do never close with Christ Alone; so they do never close with Full Christ, as He is anointed to be a King to rule over man in all things; a Priest, to procure Pardon and to make peace for man upon all occasions; a Prophet to be Wisdom, and a Teacher and Counsellor in all cases to man.</HI> So they do not receive Christ, especially in the first and third Office. But where true justifying faith is, a man closeth with whole Christ in all his Offices, judging all his will, <HI>Good, Ho∣ly, Just and Spiritual, Rom.</HI> 7.12 &amp; right concerning all things, <HI>Psal,</HI> 119.128. making mention of His Righteousness only, <HI>Psal.</HI> 71.16. The man also giveth up himself to be taught of him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.29. So that Christ is made to the true Believer with his own consent, <HI>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and compleat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>demption,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.30 And although
<PB N="81" REF="000977_0078_0FAE8D474E7D4638"/>
he hath not all these things formally in exercise when his heart goeth out after Christ, yet, upon search and tryal, it will be found with him, as I have said.</P>
<P N="3">3, <HI>Hypocrites and Reprobates do never close with Christ, and all the inconvenience; may follow him.</HI> They stick at that with that man, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.19, 20. But where true justifying Faith is, a man doth close with him on all hazards; he resolveth to forego all rather then to forego Christ, <HI>Mark</HI> 10.28. he reckoneth all to be loss and dung for the excellency of Christ Je∣sus, as his Lord, and to be found in him, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.8. We might give other differ∣rences also, As that true faith is opera∣tive, purifying the heart, <HI>Act.</HI> 15.9. working by love, Gal. 5.9· whilest hy∣pocrites do only cleanse the outside of the platter, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.25. and do all to be seen of men, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.5. not seeking the honour of God only, and so cannot believe, <HI>Joh,</HI> 5.44. We might also shew that true Faith is never alone in a man, but attended with other saving Graces: But because these things will co-incide with what followeth, and here we are shewing that a man may take up his gra∣cious <HI>State</HI> by his Faith, and the actin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="82" REF="000977_0079_0FAE8D47EC790280"/>
thereof on Christ. We pass these things.</P>
<P><HI>The Second great mark of a Gracious state and true Saving interest in Jesus Christ is, The New Creature,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.17. <HI>If any man be in Christ, he is a New Creature.</HI> This New Creation or Renovation of that man, is a very sensible change, al∣though not in those who are effectually called from the womb or in their Young∣er years, because those have had this New Creature from that time in them, so as this change in after period of time is not discernable; yet in those who have regenerated and brought into Christ af∣ter they were come to greater age, and so have been more palbably under the power of Darkness before they were translated into the Kingdom of Christ: <HI>Col.</HI> 1.13. But in all who do warrantably pretend to Christ, this New Creature must be, although some do not know ex∣perimentally the contraries of every part of it, so as others do because they have not been equally in regard of practice, under the power of Darkness. This New Creature is called the <HI>New Man, Gal.</HI> 3.10. which doth hold out the ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of it. It is not simply a new Tongue

This renovation of the man who is in Christ, may be reduced in these two great heads.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI>; There is a renovation of the mans person, Soul and Body, in some measure.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>His Ʋnderstanding is renewed, so as he judgeth Christ Preached in the Gospel to be the Wisdom and Power of God, a wise strong device beseeming God.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.23, 24. He knoweth the things of God real∣ly and solidly, not to be <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Nay,</HI> and uncertain fancies, but also to be <HI>Yea</HI> &amp; <HI>Amen</HI> solid, certain substantial things, having a desirable accomplishment in Christ, and resolving much in Him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.15.2 <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 18. Natural men cou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under Gospel-Ordinances, although they have some national knowledge of God, Christ, Promises, the motions of the Holy Spirit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they may Con∣fer, Preach and Dispute of these things;
<PB N="84" REF="000977_0081_0FAE8D4C0D6AE020"/>
yet they look on them as common received maxims of Christianity, from which to re∣cede were a singularity &amp; disgrace; but not as real, solid, substantial truths, so as to adventure their Souls and everlasting be∣ing on them. The Understanding is re∣newed also to take up somewhat of God in the Creatures, as be aring sparks of His Glorious Attributes, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.1. They see the Heavens declaring His glory and Power, and somewhat of God in Provi∣dence and Dispensations that fall out▪ <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wondrous works declare that His Name is near. Psal.</HI> 75.1. The Understanding also taketh up the conditions and cases of the Soul other wayes than it was wont to do; as we find the Saints usually speak∣ing in Scripture, <HI>O my Soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, &amp;c.</HI> Psal. 16.2. <HI>My Soul said, thy face will I seek,</HI> Psal. 27.8. <HI>Why art thou cast down O my Soul?</HI> Psal. 42.5 Psal. 43.5. <HI>Return unto thy rest, O my Soul,</HI> Psal. 167.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The Heart and Affections are renewed.</HI> The heart is made a new heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heart of flesh, capable of impressions, having a copie of His Law stamped on it, and fear of God put into it, whereby the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans Duty becometh in a manner native &amp;

kindly to the man, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.39, 40. <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 36.26. It was before a heart of stone, void of the fear of God. The Affecti∣ons are renewed now. The Love is re∣newed in some good measure. It goeth out after God, <HI>I will love the Lord, Psal.</HI> 18.1. After his Law, <HI>O how I love the Law, Psal.</HI> 119.97. after those who have Gods image in them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.35.1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.14. This love to Gods People is upon a pure account, as they are the Children of God and do keep His Statutes, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.22. It is with a pure heart, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.83. and therefore it goeth towards a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such, whom the man knoweth or appre∣hendeth to be such, Psal. 119.63. <HI>I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Companion to all them, &amp;c.</HI> In all cases and conditions, even where there is no∣thing to beautifie or comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, but the Image of God.

quench Love. Also it is communicative of good according to its measure, and as the case of the poor Godly requireth, <HI>Psal.</HI> 16.2.1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.17.18, 19. The mans Hatred is also renewed, and is now bend∣ed against sin, Psal. 119.113. <HI>I hate van thoughts</HI>: against Gods Enemies, as such, Psal. 139.21. <HI>Do not I hate them that hate thee? &amp;c.</HI> The joy or delight is renewed, for it runneth towards God, Psal. 73.25. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? &amp;c.</HI> Towards his Law and Will, Psal. 1.2. <HI>His delight is in the Law of the Lord.</HI> And towards the Godly and their Fellowship, Psal. 16.3 — <HI>In whom is all my delight.</HI> The sorrow is turned against sin which hath wronged Christ, Zec. 12.10. <HI>Look∣ing to Him whom they have Pierced, they Mourn.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.11 The sorrow is God∣ly there, and against what encroacheth upon Gods honour; they are sorrowful for the — Assemblies, and the reproach of that is their burden, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.18. There is some renovation in all the affections, as in every other part of the Soul, point∣ing now towards God.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The very outward members of the man are renewed.</HI> As the Scripture speaks, <HI>The Tongue, the Eye, the Ear, the Hand, the

<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; A man who is in Christ, is renewed in some measure in all his wayes. <HI>Behold all things are new,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17. The man becometh new;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In the way of his Interest.</HI> He was upon any good before, though but ap∣parent and at best but External. <HI>Psal.</HI> 4.6. But now his interest and business is, <HI>How to be found in Christ in that day? Phil.</HI> 3.9 or, <HI>How to be forth coming to Him, and walk before Him in the land of the Living? Psal.</HI> 56.31. which he would choose among all the mercies that fill this Earth, <HI>Psal</HI> 119.64. The interest of Christ also becometh the Mans interest, as ap∣peareth in the Song of <HI>Hannah,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2 and in the Song of <HI>Mary, Luk.</HI> 1. It is strange to see people newly Converted, and having teached but the beginnings of knowledge, concern and interest them∣selves in the Publick matters of Christs Kingdom, so desirous to have Him riding prosperously &amp; subduing the people un∣der Him.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="88" REF="000977_0085_0FAE8D4F6E8D1570"/>2. <HI>The man that is in Christ, is renewed in the way of his Worship.</HI> He was wont to serve God in the Oldness of the Letter, for the fashion, answering the Letter of the command in the outside of Duty, which one in whom the Old man hath ab∣solute dominion can do: But now he worshippeth God in the newness of the Spirit, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.6. in a new way, where∣in he is helped by the Spirit of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. beyond the reach of flesh and blood. He serveth now the true and living God, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1 in Spirit and in Truth, <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.24. having spiritual appre∣hensions of God, and engaged in his very Soul in that work, doing and saying true∣ly and not feignedly when he worship∣peth, still desiring to approach unto Him as a living God, who heareth and seeth him and can accept his service, <HI>Psal.</HI> 42. I grant, he fails of this many times; yet I may say, such worship he intend∣eth, &amp; sometimes overtaketh, &amp; doth not much reckon worship, which is not so per∣formed unto God; And the iniquity of his holy things is not the least part of his burden and exercise: Such a worship Na∣tural men are strangers unto, whilest the babble out their Vain-glorious boast∣ings,

<HI>Luk.</HI> 18.11. to an unknown God, <HI>Act.</HI> 17.23</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The man that is in Christ, is renewed in the way of his outward calling and employ∣ment in the world, he now resolveth to be a∣bout it, because God hath commanded so: Rom.</HI> 12.11. And to eye God in it as the last end, doing it to His Glory, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31. and studieth to keep some enter∣course with God in the exercise of his out∣ward employments, as <HI>Jacob</HI> doth in his latter Will, <HI>Gen.</HI> 49.18. and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did, <HI>Neb.</HI> 2.4. So as the man resolveth to walk with God, and set Him alwayes before him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 16.8. wherein I deny not he falleth often.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>He becometh new in the way of his Re∣lations</HI>: He becometh a more Dutiful Husband, Father, Brother, Master, Ser∣vant, Neighbour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> herein doth he exercise himself to keep a Conscience void of offence towards Men as well as towards God, <HI>Act.</HI> 24.16.1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.22. becoming all things to all men.</P>

He that is so a New Creature, is undoubtedly in Christ.</P>
<P><HI>This Renovation of a man in all manner of Conversation, and this being under Law to God in all things, is that Holiness,</HI> without which no man shall see God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.14. Men may fancy things to themselves, but unless they study to approve them∣selves unto God in all well-pleasing, and reach some inward testimony of sincerity that way, they shall not assure their hearts before him.

No confidence if the heart condemn.
<PB N="91" REF="000977_0088_0FAE8D5231808028"/>
This is the New Creature, having a prin∣ciple of new spiritual Life infused by God into the heart, whereby it becometh new, and putteth forth acts of new Life throughout the whole man, as we have said, so as he is poluted towards the whole Law, both these Commands which forbid Sin; so he resolveth to set against secret Sins, not to lay a stumbling-block before the blind, <HI>Lev.</HI> 19.14, Little sins, which are judged so by many, the least things of the Law, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.19.

<P>Athiests and Hypocrites may have great changes and renovation wrought upon them, and in them, and I fear mine be such?</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answ.</HEAD>
<P>I grant that Athiests and Hypocrites have many things in them, which do look like the New Creature;</P>
<P>First, <HI>In regard of the parts of the man.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>They may come to much knowledge</HI>; as <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4 they are enlightned.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>There may be a real amongst their af∣fections</HI>; as they receive the Word with joy, <HI>Matth</HI> 13 20.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>They may reach a great deal of outward reformation in the outward man</HI>; both a∣bout
<PB N="97" REF="000977_0094_0FAE8D592EFEA7A8"/>
freedom from sin, and engagement to positive duty, as that Pharisee did, <HI>Luk</HI> 18. — 12 Yea,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>In regard of their practical understand∣ing, they may judge some things of God to be excellent.</HI> The people said, that never man spake as Christ. <HI>Joh.</HI> 7.46</P>
<P>Secondly; <HI>Hypocrites may have a great deal of profession</HI>:</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>They may talk of the Law and Gospel, and of the Covenant, as the Wicked do,</HI> Psal 50.16</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>They may confess sin openly to their own shame, as King</HI> Saul <HI>did,</HI> 1 Sam. 26 21.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>They humble themselves in Sackcloth as</HI> Ahab, 1 King 21.17</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>They may enquire busily after Duty, and come chearfully to receive it,</HI> Isa. 58 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>They may joyn with Gods interest in a hard and difficult time</HI>; as <HI>Demas</HI> and o∣ther Hypocrites, in the Book of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> who afterwards fell off.</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>They may give much of their Goods to God and the Saints,</HI> as <HI>Acts</HI> 5. if not all their Goods, 1 <HI>Cor. &amp;c.</HI> Yea,</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>It is not impossible for some such being stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly engaged in their Credit, to give their Bodies to be Burnt</HI>; as in the forecited place.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="000977_0095_0FAE8D59EDF390A8"/>Thirdly, <HI>Hypocrites may advance far in the common and ordinary steps of a Christian work</HI>; such as the Elect have when God leads them Captive.</P>
<P>As;</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>They may be under great conviction of Sin</HI>; As <HI>Judas</HI> was, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27.4, — so was King <HI>Saul</HI> often.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>They may tremble at the Word of God,</HI> and be under much terror as <HI>Felix</HI> was, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.25.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>They may rejoyce in receiving of the truth,</HI> as Mat. 13 &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>They may be in some peace, and quiet in expectation of Salvation by Christ,</HI> as the Foolish Virgins were, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>All this may be backed and followed with some good measure of Reformation.</HI> The Unclean Spirit may go out of them, <HI>Mat</HI> 12 43</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>This Work may seem to be confirmed by some special experiences and tastings of the good Word of God,</HI> Heb 6.4</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Hypocrites may have some things very like the saving Graces of the Spirit;</P>
<P>As:</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>They may have a sort of Faith,</HI> as <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> Act. 8 13.</P>

<P N="4">4 <HI>They have a sort of Hope,</HI> Job 1.3.13</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>They have some Love</HI>: So had <HI>Herod</HI> to <HI>John, Mark</HI> 6.26. I need not to in∣sist it; it is out of all question they have Counterfeits of all saving Graces.</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>They have somewhat like the special communications of God and the witnessing of His Spirit; as somewhat like the powers of the World to come, powerfully on them, with some flashes of joy arising thence,</HI> as <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4 Notwithstanding of all which they are but almost perswaded with <HI>Agrippa,</HI> to be Christians, <HI>Act.</HI> 26.28.

Elect when they are Converted &amp; brought under the bond of the Covenant, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31 39 <HI>Ezek·</HI> 36.26. Hypocrites did never apprehend Christ as the only satisfying Good in all the world, for which with joy they would quit all, for then the Kingdom of God were entred in them, <HI>Mat,</HI> 13.44. The truly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>newed man dare and can upon good ground say, and hath a testimony of it from an high, that his heart hath been changed in taking up of Christ, and hath been led out after Him, as the only enriching treasure, in whom to be found, he counteth all else loss and dung, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3 8, 9</P>
<P N="2">2, <HI>Whatsoever Reformation or Profession Hypocrites do attain unto, as it cometh not from a new heart, and pure Principle of zeal for God, so it is alwayes for some wicked and by-end</HI>; as to be seen of men, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.5. or to evite and shun some outward strait to be free of Gods wrath and the trouble of their own Conscience, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.3. <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 3.14. In testimony of this, they never have respect to all known Com∣mands, else they should never be ashamed, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.6. nor do they without ap∣proven Guile in their own heart, resolve against every known iniquity, else they

If in never so mean a case, they did from a principle of love unto, and of zeal for Christ, and for a right end, confess and profess Him, Christ were obliged by His own word to con∣fess them before His Father, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.30</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Whatsoever length Hypocrites advance in that work, by which people are led in unto Christ, yet they never seek first the Kingdom of God and the Righteousness thereof,</HI> Mat. 6.33 the One thing that is necessary, <HI>viz.</HI> Christs Fri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d-ship and Fellow-ship, is never their <HI>One Thing</HI> and Heart-satis∣fying Choice, else that better part would never be taken from them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.42.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Whatsoever counterfeits of Grace are in Hypocrites, yet they are all bred there, with∣out any saving work of the Spirit of Christ</HI>: and it is enough to exclude them from the benefit of this mark, that they are never denied to these things, nor empti∣ed of them, but still do rest on them as their Saviour, so that they submit not unto the Righteousness of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10 3. and that is enough to keep them at a distance from Christ, who will never clout that old garment of <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> with His

fine new linnen, nor put His new Wine in these old bottles, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.16, 17.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>We may say, Let</HI> Hypocrites, Re∣probates, <HI>or</HI> Athiests <HI>have what they can, they want the three great Essentials of</HI> Religion <HI>and true</HI> Christianity: <HI>First,</HI> They are not broken in themselves, and emptied even of their righteousness, the length of self-loathing, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lying open for relief. Such lost ones Christ came to seek and save, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19.10 <HI>Secondly,</HI> They never took up Christ Jesus as the only treasure and jewel that can only enrich, &amp; should satisfie, and therefore have never cor∣dially agreed unto Gods device in the Covenant, and so are not worthy of Him; neither hath the Kingdom of God sa∣vingly entered into their heart, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Thirdly,</HI> They never in earnest do close with Christs whole yoke without exception, judging all his Will just and good, holy and spiritual, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 7 12.

<P>It is much te be lamented, that peo∣ple professing His Name, should be so slaited and enslaved by transgression as many are. Yet in answer to the Object∣ion, if it be seriously proposed, we say, the Saints are found in Scripture justly laying claim unto God and His Covenant, when iniquity did prevail over them, as we find, Psal. 65.3. <HI>Iniquities prevail a∣gainst me; as for our transgressions, thou wilt do them away.</HI> Rom. 7.25 <HI>Paul</HI> thanks God through Christ, when a law in his members leads him Captive unto sin: But for the better understanding and safe application of such Truths, we must difference between gross out-breakings and ordinary infirmities or heart ills, or sins that come unawares upon a man, without forethought or deliberation.

We find <HI>David</HI> calling himself Gods servant, quickly after his numbering of Gods People, but he was then under the serious resentment of his sin, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.10, <HI>Jonab</HI> layeth claim to God as his Master under his rebellion, but he is then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ueing it, and in a spirit of revenge a∣gainst himself for his sin, <HI>Jonah</HI> 1.9, — 12 M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, As for these sins of infirmity, and dayly incursion and heart ills, such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those whereof <HI>Paul</HI> doth complain (it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) were.

He can say, he failed of a good which he intended, and did out-shoot himself, and he had often honestly resolved a∣gainst the evil which he fell into, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.15, 18, 19. (3) He saith that the prevailing of sin over him is his exer∣cise, so as he judgeth himself wretched because of such a body of Death, from which he longeth to be delivered, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.24. (4) He saith, that whilest he is under the power and law of Sin, there is somewhat in the bottom of his heart opposing it, although overmastered by it, which would be another way, and when that gets the upper hand, it is a delight∣some thing, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.22, 25.

<P>I shall shortly hint some of these excel∣lent Communications, and I hope upon a right discovery of them there will be but small ground found for the jealous com∣plaints of many Gracious people.</P>
<P>First, (Beside these Convictions of the Spirit of God, which use to usher Christs way unto the Souls of men, and these also which afterwards do ordinarily at∣tend them) <HI>There is a Seal of the Spirit of God spoken of in Scripture</HI>; the principal thing whereof is the Sanctifying work of the holy Ghost, imprinting the draughts and lineaments of Gods Image and Re∣vealed will upon a man, as a seal or sig∣net doth leave an impression and stamp of its likeness upon the thing Sealed, so it is, 2 Tim. 2.19. <HI>The foundation of God — having this Seal; the Lord knoweth them who are His. And let every one that nameth the Name of Christ, depart from iniquity.</HI> And thus I conceive the seal to be called a witness, 1 Joh. 5 10. <HI>He that believeth hath the witness in himself</HI>; that is, the
<PB N="108" REF="000977_0105_0FAE8CB36DDF83D8"/>
grounds upon which an interest in Christ is to be made out, and proved, are in every Believer; for he hath somewhat of the sanctifying work of Gods Spirit in him, which is a sure (although not al∣wayes a clear and manifest) witness.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>There is Communion with God much talked of among Christians, where∣by they understand the sensible presense of God refreshing the Soul exceedingly.</HI> But if we speak properly, Communion with God is a mutual interest between God and a man, who hath closed with him in Christ. It is a common-ness or a common interest between God and a Man; not only is a man interested in God Himself, but in all that is the Lords: so the Lord hath a special interest in the man, and also all that belongs to him. There is a Commu∣nion between Husband and Wife, where∣by they have a special interest in others, persons, goods, gear and concernments, so it is here; there is such a Communi∣on with God. He is our God, and all things are ours, because He is ours: this Communion with God all true Believers have at all times, as we shall shew after∣wards: I grant there is an actual im∣provement
<PB N="109" REF="000977_0106_0FAE8CB42EA54CA8"/>
of that Communion, whereby men do boldly meddle with any thing that belongs unto God, and do meddle with Himself as their own, with much homeliness and familiarity, especially in Worship, when the Soul doth converse with a living God, partaking of the Divine Nature, growing like unto Him, and sweetly travelling through his At∣tributes, and with some confidence of interest, viewing these things as the mans own goods and gear: this we call Com∣munion with God in Ordinances: This indeed is not so ordinarily nor frequent∣ly made out to men, and all Gods Peo∣ple do not equally partake of it; and it is true, that what is in God, goeth not out for the behove of the man, to his ap∣prehension equally at all times, yet cer∣tainly Communion with God, properly so called, <HI>viz.</HI> that common-ness of <HI>Interest</HI> between God and a Man who is savingly in Covenant with Him, doth alwayes stand firm and sure; and so much of Com∣munion with God in Ordinances have all Believers, as that their heart converseth with a living God there now and then, and is in some measure changed into that same image, and there needs be no doubt about any further in it.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="000977_0107_0FAE8CB55D846580"/>Thirdly, <HI>There is a thing which is called Fell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wship with God, often mistaken also amongst Believers.</HI> If by fellowship be meant the walking in our duty as in the sight of a living God, who seeth and heareth us, and is witness to all our carriage. It is a thing common unto all gracious men, they all have it habitually, and in de∣sign, Psal. 16.8. <HI>I have set the Lord al∣wayes before me</HI>; yea, and often they have it actually in exercise, when their spirit is in any good frame; they walk as if they saw God standing by them, and have some thoughts of His favour through Christ; <HI>Truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.3. If we by <HI>Fellowship,</HI> do mean a sweet, refreshing, familiar, sensible conversing with God, which doth delight and refresh the Soul, (beside what the Conscience of Duty doth) it is then a walking in the light of His Countenance, and a good part of sen∣sible presence; and although it seemeth <HI>Enoch</HI> had much of it, whilest it is said, <HI>He walked with God, Gen.</HI> 5.24. yet it is not so ordinary as the former, nor so common to all Christians, for here the Soul is filled as with marrow and fatness,
<PB N="111" REF="000977_0108_0FAE8CB5AA2D41A8"/>
following hard after its guide, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gu∣larly upheld by his right hand, <HI>Psal.</HI> 63.5, 8.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>There is a thing which is cal∣led Access unto God:</HI> and this I take to be the removing of obstructions out of the way between a man and God, so as the man is admitted to come near. We are said to have access to a great person, when doors are cast open, guards re∣moved from about him, and we admit∣ted to close at him; so it is here. Now this Access in Scripture, is sometimes taken for Christs preparing of the way, the re∣moving of enmity between God and sin∣ners; so as men now have a patent way to come unto God through Christ, <HI>Eph,</HI> 2.18. Sometimes it is taken for the actual improvement of that Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess pur∣chased by Christ, when a man finds all <HI>obstructions</HI> and <HI>differences,</HI> which do or∣dinarily fall in between him and God, re∣moved; God is not uncouth to him, nor as a stranger, keeping up himself from him, or frowning on him, but the man is admitted to come even to his seat, as <HI>Job</HI> 23.3. Of the want of this doth <HI>Job</HI> complain, <HI>Job</HI> 23.8, 9 whilst he saith, I go forward, backward, to the right and
<PB N="112" REF="000977_0109_0FAE8CB815CCDB38"/>
left hand, &amp; I find him not. The <HI>first</HI> sort of Access is common to all Believers, they are brought near by the Blood of the Covenant, and are no more far off, as the deadly enmity between God and them is removed. But Access, in the other sense, is dispensed more, according to the Lords absolute soveraignty and plea∣sure, and it is left in the power of Be∣lievers to obstruct it unto themselves, until it please the Lord mercifully and freely to grant unto them again, so it is up and down, and there needs be no question, as to a mans state) about it.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>There is a thing called Liberty before God, and this properly is freedom, or free speaking unto God.</HI> Many do much question their state, because of the want of this now and then, since the Scripture hath said, <HI>Where the Spirit is, there is Li∣berty,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.17. but they do justly con∣fine that liberty spoken of there, unto this free speaking before God. I grant where the spirit of the Lord doth sa∣vingly discover Gods will in the Scrip∣tures to a man, there is liberty from a∣ny obligation to the Ceremonial-Law, and from the Condemning power of the
<PB N="113" REF="000977_0110_0FAE8CB9022A5DF8"/>
Moral-Law, and from much of that gross Darkness and Ignorance, which is on Na∣tural hearts as a vail hiding Christ in the Gospel from them. I grant also, that sometimes, even this liberty which is a free communing with God, and ordering of our cause before him, and filling of our mouths with arguments, <HI>Job</HI> 23.4. is granted to the Godly, but not as liber∣ty taken in the former senses. Although the Lord hath obliged Himself to pour out the Spirit of Prayer upon all the house of <HI>David</HI> in some measure, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. yet this Communication of the Spirit, which we call liberty or free speak∣ing unto God, dependeth much on the Lords absolute pleasure, when, and in what measure to allow it. This liberty which we call freedom, or free speaking with God in Prayer, is sometimes much abstracted from any great confidence in the time of Prayer, (<HI>at least until it draw toward the close of it</HI>) it standeth much in a vivacity of the understanding to take up the case which a man is to speak be∣fore God, so as he can order his cause; and next, there be words, or verbal ex∣pressions, elegant, suitable, and very emphatical or powerful, or pithy; there
<PB N="114" REF="000977_0111_0FAE8CB96C8B1380"/>
is also joyned a fervency of Spirit in Prayer whereof the Scripture speaketh; <HI>The Soul is hot and bended and very intent</HI>: there is also ordinarily in this liberty a spec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al melting of the heart (<HI>often joined with a great measure of the Spirit of Grace &amp; Supplication, Zech.</HI> 11.10) so the Soul is poured out before God as for a <HI>First-born</HI>: such is the liberty which many Saints get before God, whilest in much broken∣ness of Heart and fervency of spirit they are admitted to speak their mind fully to God, as a living God, noticing (<HI>at least</HI>) their Prayer. Sometimes this liberty is joyned with Confidence, and then it is not only a free, but also a bold speak∣ing before God: <HI>It is that Boldness with Confidence, Eph.</HI> 3.12. This is more rarely imparted unto men then the for∣mer, yet it is ordinarily. It hath in it, beside what we spake before, some in∣fluence of the Spirit upon Faith, making it put out some vigorous acting in Prayer; there is a sweet mournful frame of Spirit, by which a man poureth out his heart in Gods bosome, and with some confidence of His favour and good-will, pleadeth his cause before him, as a Living God; and this is all the sensible presence that
<PB N="115" REF="000977_0112_0FAE8CBA7B5EC2D0"/>
many Sains do attain unto: There is no ground of doubt about a mans state in the point of Liberty before God in this last sense, because there is nothing essen∣tial to the making up of a Gracious state here: some have it, some want it, some have it at some times and not at other times, so that it is much up and down; yet I may say, Gracious men may do much (by a very ordinary influence) contributing towards the attaining and retaining, or keeping of such a frame of Spirit.</P>
<P>Sixthly, <HI>There is a thing called, Influence or Breathing of the Spirit.</HI> This gracious influence (for of such only do I now speak) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> either ordinary, and this is the operation of the Holy Spirit on the Soul and the habits of Grace there, whereby they are still kept alive and in some exercise and acting, although not very discernable. This influence (<HI>I con∣ceive)</HI> doth alwayes attend Believers, &amp; is that <HI>Keeping</HI> and <HI>Watering</HI> night and day, and every moment, promised. <HI>Isa.</HI> 27.3. Or, this influence is more singu∣lar and special, and is that same to a gracious (although a withered) Soul, as the wind and breath to the dry Bones,
<PB N="116" REF="000977_0113_0FAE8CBB2D9A4D18"/>
putting them in good case, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.9, 10. and as the dew or rain to the Grass, or newly mowen field &amp; parched ground, <HI>Psal.</HI> 72.6 Such influence is meant, <HI>Cant.</HI> 4.16 By the blowing of the <HI>South</HI> wind, making the spices to flow out. When the Spirit moveth thus, there is an edge put upon the Graces of God in the Soul, and they are made to act more vi∣gorously. This is the enlarging of the heart, by which a man doth run in the wayes of God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.32. This in∣fluence is more discernable than the for∣mer, and not so ordinarily communicated. Also here, sometimes the wind bloweth more upon one Grace, and sometimes more discernable upon another; and often upon many of the Graces together, and according to the lesser or greater measure of this influence, the Soul acteth more or less vigorously towards God: and since faith is a Created Grace in the Soul this <HI>Influence</HI> of the Spirit is upon it, some∣times less, sometimes more, and accord∣ingly is the assurance of Faith small or great.</P>
<P>Seventhly, <HI>There is the hearing of Pray∣er, often spoken of in Scripture; and many vex themselves about it, alleging that they
<PB N="117" REF="000977_0114_0FAE8CBBB1563FC0"/>
know nothing of it experimentally.</HI> I grant there is a favourable hearing of Prayer: But we must remember it is twofold.</P>
<P>Either;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is such as a man is simply to believe by way of Argument on Scriptural grounds.</HI> As if I be fled unto Christ, and do ap∣proach unto God in him, pray accord∣ing to His Will, not regarding iniquity in my heart, exercising Faith about the thing I pray for, absolutely or conditi∣onally, according to the nature of the thing and promises about it. I am ob∣liged to believe that God heareth my Prayer and will give what is good, ac∣cording to these Scriptures, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.13, 14. <HI>Whatsoever you ask in my Name, I will do it,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.14. This is our confidence that whatsoever we ask according to His Will, He heareth us, <HI>Mark,</HI> 11.24. Be∣lieve that you receive and you shall have what you do desire, Psal. 66.18. <HI>If I re∣gard Iniquity, He will not hear.</HI> Then if I regard not Iniquity, I may believe that He doth hear me. Or;</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A man doth sensibly perceive that God hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth his Prayer.</HI> It is made out to his heart, without any Sylogistical deduction. Such a hearing got <HI>Hannah,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.18
<PB N="118" REF="000977_0115_0FAE8CBC6E357BA8"/>
Her countenance was no more sad. Sure∣ly the Lord did breath upon her Faith, and made her believe that she was heard, and she could not make it out by any ar∣gument; for she had not grounds where∣upon to build the premises of the argu∣ment according to Scripture in that par∣ticular. God did stamp in some way up∣on her heart sensibly, and so made her believe it. This is but rarely granted, especially in cases clearly deducible in Scripture. And therefore people are much to be satisfied in exer∣cising their Faith about the other, and let God give of this latter what He plea∣seth. A mans gracious state should not be brought upon debate, upon the ac∣count of such hearing of Prayer.</P>
<P>Eighthly, <HI>There is Assurance of Gods Favour by the witnessing of our own Spirits</HI>: which Assurance, is deduced by way of argument <HI>Sylogistically</HI>; Thus, whosoever Believeth on Christ shall never Perish; <HI>But I do Believe on Christ: Therefore I shall never Perish.</HI> Whoso hath respect unto all Gods Commandments shall never be ashamed; <HI>But I have respect unto all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Commandments: Therefore I shall never be
<PB N="119" REF="000977_0116_0FAE8CBEC8D63CD0"/>
ashamed.</HI> I say, by reasoning thus, and comparing spiritual things with spiritual things, a man may attain unto a good certainty of his gracious sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. It is sup∣posed, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.18, 19. that by loving the Brethren in deed and in truth, we may assure our hearts before God; and that a man may rejoyce upon the testi∣mony of a good Conscience, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12 A man may have confidence if his heart do not Condemn him, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.21 We may then attain unto some Assurance (al∣though not full Assurance) by the wit∣ness of our own spirits. I do not deny, that in this witnessing of our spirits to∣wards Assurance, there is some concur∣rence of the Spirit of God: But I con∣ceive, there needeth but a very ordinary influence, without which we can do no∣thing. Now, this Assurance, such as it is, may be reached by intelligent Believers, who keep a good Conscience in their walk. So, I hope, there needs be no de∣bate about it, as to a mans gracious state <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for if a man will clear himself of Heart-condemnings, he will speedily reach this Assurance.</P>
<P>Ninthly, <HI>There is a witnessing of Gods spirit, mentioned,</HI> Rom. 8.16. <HI>A bearing
<PB N="120" REF="000977_0117_0FAE8CBFAF4929E0"/>
witness with our Spirits, that we are the Chil∣dren of God.</HI> This operation of the Spirit, is best understood,, if we produce any syllogism by which our spirit do witness our Son-ship: As for example, Whoso∣ever loveth the Brethren, is past from Death to Life, and consequently is in Christ; <HI>But I love the Brethren: Therefore I am past from Death to Life.</HI> Here there is a threefold operation of the Spirit, or three operations rather. The <HI>First</HI> is a beam of Divine light upon the first pro∣position, perswading the Divine authori∣ty of it, as the Word of God: The Spirit of the Lord must witness the Divinity of the Scripture; and that is the infalli∣ble Word of God, far beyond all other arguments can be used. The <HI>Second</HI> operation is, a Glorious beam of light from the Spirit, shining upon the second proposition, and so upon his own graces in the Soul, discovering them to be true Graces, and such as the Scripture calleth so. Thus we are said to know by His Spirit the things freely given unto us of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.13. The <HI>Third</HI> operation is in order to the third proposition of the argument, or the conclusion; and this I conceive to be nothing else but
<PB N="121" REF="000977_0118_0FAE8CC0ADCCFDA8"/>
an influence upon Faith, strengthning it to draw a conclusion of full assurance up∣on the foresaid premises. Now (with submission unto others, who have greater light in the Scripture, and more expe∣rience of these communications) I do conceive the witness of the Spirit, or witnessing of it, which is mentioned, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. is not that first operation upon the first proposition; for, that ope∣ration is that testimony of the Spirit, by which He beareth witness to the Divini∣ty of the whole Scripture, and asserteth the Divine authority of it unto the souls of Gracious men, and such an operati∣on may be upon a truth of Scripture, which doth not relate to a mans Son-ship or Interest in Christ at all. The Spirit may so shine upon any truth, relating to Duty, or any other fundamental truth perswading the Divinity of it, upon and unto the soul, and speak nothing relating to a mans interest in Christ. Neither is the third operation of the Spirit, by which He makes Faith boldly draw the conclusion. This witnessing of the Spirit for that operation, is nothing else but <HI>influence</HI> upon Faith, bringing it out to full assurance; but that whereupon this
<PB N="122" REF="000977_0119_0FAE8CC0EFA30D98"/>
full assurance is drawn or put out, is some∣what deposed and witnessed already. Therefore I conceive the second opera∣tion of the Spirit upon the second pro∣position, and so upon the Graces in the man, is that witness of Gods Spirit, that beam of Divine light, shining upon those Graces, whereby they are made very conspicuous to the understanding: That is the witness; the shining so on them is His witnessing: for, only here in this proposition and in this operation, doth the Spirit of God prove a co-witness with our spirit: for, the main thing wherein the witness of our spirit lieth, is in the second proposition, and so the Spirit of God, witnessing with our spi∣rits, is also in that same proposition. So these two witnesses, having deposed and witnessed one and the same thing, <HI>viz.</HI> the truth and reality of such and such Graces in the man, which our own spirit or conscience doth depose, according to its knowledge; and the Spirit of the Lord doth certainly affirm and witness to be so. There is a sentence drawn forth, and a conclusion of the mans Son-ship by the mans Faith, breathed upon by the <HI>Spirit</HI> for that effect, and this conclusion
<PB N="123" REF="000977_0120_0FAE8CC1DC632E70"/>
beareth the full assurance of a mans Son∣ship. It may be presumed, that some true Saints do not partake of this all their dayes, as <HI>Heb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 2.15.</P>
<P>Tenthly, <HI>I speak with the experience of many Saints, and I hope, according to Scrip∣ture, if I say, there is a communication of the Spirit of God which is let out to some of His People; sometimes it is somewhat be∣side, if not beyond, that witnessing of a Son∣ship spoken of before: It is a Glorious Di∣vine manifestation of God unto the Soul, shedding abroad Gods love in the Heart; it is a thing better felt then spoken of; it is no audible voice, but it is a waffe of Glory filling the Soul with God, as He is Life, Light, Love and Liberty, countervasting that audible voice</HI>; O Man, greatly Be∣loved, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.22. <HI>putting a man in a transport with this in his heart,</HI> It is good to be here, as <HI>Mat.</HI> 17, 4 It is that which went out from Christ to <HI>Mary,</HI> when He but mentioned her name, <HI>Joh.</HI> 10.16 He had spoken some words to her before, and she understood not that it was He: But when He uttered this one word <HI>MARY,</HI> there was some ad∣mirable conveyance and manifestation
<PB N="124" REF="000977_0121_0FAE8CC2C7A805A0"/>
made out unto her heart, by which she was so satisfyingly filled, that there was no place for arguing &amp; disputing, whether or not that was Christ, and if she had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> interest in Him. That manifestation made Faith to it self, and did purchase credit and trust to it self, and was equi∣valent with, <HI>Thus saith the Lord.</HI> This is such a glanse of Glory, that it may in the highest sense be called, the earnest or first fruits of the inheritance: for, it is a felt armful of the Holy GOD, almost wholly conforming the man unto His likeness, so swallowing him up, that He forgetteth all things except the present manifestation. Oh, How Glorious is this manifestation of the Spirit! Faith here riseth to so full an assurance, that it re∣solveth wholly into sensible embracements of God. This is the thing which doth best deserve the title of sensible presence. And, it is like, is not given unto all Believers, some whereof, are all their Dayes under bondage, and in fear, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.15 But here love, almost perfect, casteth out fear. This is so absolutely let out upon the Masters pleasure, and so transient and passing or quickly gone when it is, that no man may bring his
<PB N="125" REF="000977_0122_0FAE8CC32A451738"/>
Gracious state upon debate for want of it.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, <HI>There is a thing we call Peace, about which many do vex themselves.</HI> This Peace is either about a mans state, that he is reconciled unto God by Jesus Christ, or it is about his present case and condition, thas he is walking so, as ap∣proven of God, at least so far, as there is no quarrel or controversie between God and him threatning a stroke: both of these are either such in the court of Scripture, and consequently in Gods ac∣count, or in the court of a mans Con∣science. Peace about a mans state, as being in Christ, is sure in the Court of Scripture and of Heaven, when a man doth by Faith close with Christ and New-Covenant, Rom. 5.1. <HI>Being justifyed by Faith, we have Peace with God</HI>; it being sure and solid in the Court of Scripture, it should <HI>hold</HI> sure in the Court of a mans Conscience, it being rightly inform∣ed, for in that case, it still speaks ac∣cording to Scripture: but because often the Conscience is misinformed and in the dark, therefore there is often Peace about a mans state according to Scripture, whilest his Conscience doth threaten the
<PB N="126" REF="000977_0123_0FAE8CC3ECD35F50"/>
contrary, and doth still Condemn, and refuseth to assoil the man, as being re∣conciled unto God through Christ. In this case, the Conscience must be inform∣ed, and the mans Gracious state made out by the marks of Grace, as we shew before; and here the witness of my own spirit, will do much to allay the Cry of the Conscience, and if the Spirit of the Lord joyn His witness and testimony, the Conscience is perfectly satisfied, and proclameth Peace to the man. The o∣ther Peace, about a mans present case or condition, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is approven of God in a Gospel sense, it may be want∣ing, and justly wanting, although the o∣ther Peace about a mans state be sure. This Peace about a mans case and con∣dition, it is either such in the Court of Scripture, and this is when a man is not regarding iniquity, and respecting the Commands of God without exception; then the Scripture saith, he stands in an even place, and he needeth fear no stated quarrel between God and him, in order to a temporary stroak; and when it is thus, his Conscience should also assoil him that same way; and would do so, if it were rightly informed; but because
<PB N="127" REF="000977_0124_0FAE8CC4C5DAC398"/>
the Conscience is often in the dark, there∣fore a man may be alarm'd with evil in the Court of Conscience, as if he were justly to expect a stroak from God be∣cause of his sin, and some quarrel God hath at him, although He intend salvati∣on for him; this is enough to keep a man in disquiet, and to inhibit him the rejoycing allowed upon him, whilest he is walking in his integrity: therefore a man must here also inform his Consci∣ence, and receive no accusations nor con∣demnings from it, unless it make them clear by <HI>Scripture:</HI> at that bar, let every man stand, both about his state and his condition or case; and let him appeal from all other Courts to that, and not receive any indictment but conform to the truth of God, by which the Con∣science is to proceed in all things; and if this were well lookt unto, there would not be so many groundless suspicions a∣mongst the Lords People, either about their state or their condition upon every thought which entertain their mind.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, <HI>There is the joy of the Holy Ghost, and this is when the Spirit doth breath upon our rejoycing in God</HI> (<HI>which is a Grace
<PB N="128" REF="000977_0125_0FAE8CC5C1CA8EA0"/>
very little in exercise with many</HI>) <HI>and maketh it set out sensibly and vigorously; &amp; He exciteth and stirreth the passion of joy and of delight in the Soul, so as there is an unspeakable and glorious joy in the Soul, in the apprehension of Gods friendship and near∣ness unto him.</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.8. This joy followeth upon peace &amp; peace followeth righteous∣ness, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.17. This joy readily will not fail to be according to the measure of the assurance of Faith, as 1 Pet. 1.8 <HI>In whom believing, ye rejoyce, &amp;c.</HI> so that the removal of mistakes about other things, will allay doubts about this.</P>
<P>Now, because some of these excellent communications of the Spirit, after they are gone, are brought in question as de∣lusions of Satan, for vindicating of them we say, that the special operations of Gods Spirit in any high degree, usually are communicated to people after such brokenness of spirit, <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.8. after so singular pains in religious Duty, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.3, 21 or in time of such suffering for Righteousness, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.14. or if they break in as the rain that waiteth not for man, then they do so humble and abase the person, <HI>Isa.</HI> 6.5. and there are found
<PB N="129" REF="000977_0126_0FAE8CC62B8BC808"/>
so many evidences of Grace in the man, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. or these things do so pro∣voke unto Holiness, and to have every thing answerable and conform unto these manifestations of God, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.19. the person under them doth so loath all things beside Gods friendship and fel∣lowship, <HI>Mat.</HI> 17.4. and these things do carry on them and with them so much authority, and Divine superscription, whilst they are in the soul; that after∣wards they may appear sufficiently to be special communications of God, and singular, gracious operations of His <HI>Spirit,</HI> and no delusions of <HI>Satan</HI> transforming himself into an Angel of light, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11 14. nor such common flashes of the <HI>Spirit</HI> as may admit afterwards irrecoverable Apostacy from God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5, 6. Now then to conclude this part of the work that relateth unto tryal; I say to all these who complain of the want of the precious out-lettings of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Bless God if you want nothing essential for making out of a saving interest in Christ.</HI> God hath given unto you Christ Jesus, the greatest gift He had, and since your heart is shapen out for Him, He will
<PB N="130" REF="000977_0127_0FAE8CC828704B80"/>
with Him, give you all things that are good for you in their season.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I do believe, upon a right search and tryal, after you have understood the com∣munications of the Spirit, you are not so great a stranger to many things as you did suspect your self to be.</HI> But;</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Remember the Promises of Life, and of Peace with God, are no where in Scrip∣ture made unto these special things whereof you alledge the want</HI>: The Promises are made unto Faith, followed with Holiness! and it may be presumed, that many Heirs of Glory do not in this life par∣take of some of these things, but are in Bondage all their dayes through fear of Death, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.15. so that there should be no mistake about these things: we may seek after them, but God is free to give or withold them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Many do seek after such manifestati∣ons before they give credit by Faith unto Gods Word.</HI> He hath born <HI>record</HI> that there is Life enough for men in CHRIST JESUS, and if men would by Believing set to their seal that GOD is true, they should partake of more of these excel∣lent things.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>I may say, many have not honourable ap∣prehensions
<PB N="131" REF="000977_0128_0FAE8CC91B3345A8"/>
and thoughts of the Spirit of God, whose proper work it is to put out the fore∣said noble operations:</HI> they do not adore Him as God, but vex, grieve, quench and resist Him, and many people com∣plaining of the want of their things, are not at the pains to seek the Spirit in His out-goings▪ and few do set themselves a∣part for such precious receipts: There∣fore be at more pains in Religion, give more credit to His Word, and esteem more highly of the Spirit of God, and so you may find more of these Excel∣lent things.</P>

<PB N="138" REF="000977_0135_0FAE8CCF561A89F0"/>
the former part of the Treatise; then for securing their state, they are obli∣ged with all diligence, personally and heartily to accept of, and close with Gods device of saving Sinners by Jesus Christ, held out in the Gospel. In handling of this;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We shall shew what it is to accept of and close with that noble invention</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We shall shew, that it is the necessary duty of those who would be in favour with God and secure their Souls.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What is previously required of those who perform this duty.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>What are the qualifications and proper∣ties of this duty, if rightly managed.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>What be the native consequents of it, U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e performed aright.</HI></P>
<P>As for the First, <HI>What is to close with Gods device of saving Sinners by Christ Je∣sus, held out in the Gospel</HI>? Here we must remember (as we shew before) that at first God willed man to abide in His favour, by holding fast his first integrity in which he was Created; but man by his transgression lost Gods favour, made void that Covenant of Works, and put him∣self in an utter incapacity to regain the Lords friendship which he had lost by his
<PB N="139" REF="000977_0136_0FAE8CCFEBCF9768"/>
Sin, and to rescue himself from the Curse and wrath now due to him for the same; or any way to procure his own Salvati∣on: but the Lord freely hath manife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed another way of repairing mans lost estate, <HI>viz.</HI> by sending His Son Christ Jesus in the Flesh to satisfie his Justice for the sins of the Elect, and to restore in them his image now defaced, and to bring them unto Glory▪ and he hath made open Pro∣clamation in the Church that whosoever will lay aside all thoughts of saving them∣selves by the Covenant of Works, or in∣herent Righteousness, and will agree heartily to be saved by Jesus Christ, they shall be restored to a better condition then formerly man was into, and shall be saved: So then, to close with Gods de∣vice of saving sinners by Christ Jesus, is to quitt and forego all thoughts of help or salvation by our own righteous∣ness, and to agree unto this way which God hath found out. It is to no value and highly esteem of Christ Jesus as the treasure sufficient to enrich poor man, and with the heart to believe this record, that there is Life enough in him for men. It is to please this invention, and to ac∣quiese in it as the only way to true hap∣piness.
<PB N="140" REF="000977_0137_0FAE8CD2795F5120"/>
It is to point towards this Me∣diator, as God holdeth Him our in the Gospel, with desire to lay the stress of our whole state on him. This is that which is called faith or believing, the receiving of Christ, or believing on His Name, <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1 12. This is that believing on the Name of the Lord Jesus, com∣manded unto the Jaylor for his safety, <HI>Act.</HI> 16.31 This agreeth to all the de∣scription of justifying Faith in the Scrip∣ture. This doth answer the type of look∣ing to the brazen Serpent lifted up in the Wilderness, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.14. And this is supposed in all these ordinary actings of Faith, to which promises are annexed in the Scripture, and will be found in all who have got the new heart from God, and it will be found in none else.</P>
<P>As to the Second thing, viz. <HI>That this is the necessa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y duty of all such who would be in favour with God and secure their Souls.</HI></P>
<P>It appeareth thus;</P>
<P N="1">1. This closing with Gods device, or believing in Christ, is commanded every where in Scripture by the Lord, as the condition of the New-Covenant, giving title and right unto all the Spiritual bles∣sings of the same; for, it is upon the
<PB N="141" REF="000977_0138_0FAE8CD36A9444C0"/>
matter, the receiving of Christ: this is commanded, whilst God bids men come and buy, that is, impropriate all, by clo∣sing with that device. <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1 The weary are commanded to come unto him thus for their rest, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. <HI>This is His Commandment, that we believe on the Name of His Son,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.23. This is enough to prove it a duty incumbent. But further, it is such a duty as only giveth title and right to a Son-ship; for only they who receive Him, are privi∣ledged to be Sons, Joh. 1.12. <HI>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to such as believed on his Name.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 It appeareth to be the necessary duty of all, thus; No less than this doth give a meeting unto God, offering Himself to be our God in Christ; and no less than this doth answer our profession, as we are in Covenant with Him, as members of his visible Church. The Lord offer∣eth to be our God in Christ; if we do not close with the offer, laying aside all thoughts of otherwayes, by which we may attain to happiness, we give no meet∣ing to him: He saith, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye
<PB N="142" REF="000977_0139_0FAE8CD4E40EF118"/>
Him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at.</HI> 17.5. If we close not with the offer, we give no answer unto God. Moreover, we are all Baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 2.38. Now, un∣less we close with Christ as said is, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion: Therefore, since this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the thing which doth answer Gods offer in the Gospel, and make good o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Profession, as Members of His Church, it is a necessary duty lying upon us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whatsoever a man hath else, if he do not thus close with Gods device a∣bout Christ Jesus, and do not receive Him, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doth not avail, either as to the accepting of his Person or of his Perfor∣mances, or as to the saving of His Soul. Men are accepted only in Christ the Be∣loved, <HI>Eph</HI> 1.6. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> and his offering are accepted by Faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 4. <HI>Without Faith, it is impossible to please God,</HI> ver. 6▪ And he that believeth not, is Condemned already and shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him, <HI>Joh</HI> 3.18. — for want of this, no external ti∣tle doth avail: The Children of the Kingdom are cast out▪ if this be want∣ing, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.10. — the people of <HI>Israel</HI> are like other Heathens, in regard of a
<PB N="143" REF="000977_0140_0FAE8CD5333D14A8"/>
graceless state, lying open to the wrath of God, <HI>Jer.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 25, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If men do not believe that He who was slain at <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> who was called CHRIST JESUS, and witnessed unto by the Prophets, and declared to be the Son of God by many mighty works; I say, if men do not be∣lieve that he is the way, and close not with Him as the only way, they shall die in their sins, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.24.</P>
<P>We say then, it is a most necessary Duty thus to close with Christ Jesus as the blessed relief appointed for sinners: every one who is come to years of un∣derstanding, and heareth this Gospel, is obliged to take to heart his own lost condition, and Gods gracious offer of Peace and Salvation through Christ Jesus, and speedily to flie from the wrath to come, by accepting and closing with this offer, heartily acquiesing therein as a sa∣tisfying way for saving of poor sinners: and, that all may be the more encouraged to set about this duty, when they hear him praying them to be reconciled unto Him, let them remember that peace and salvation is offered to the people in universal terms; to all without excep∣tion: if any man will he shall be welcome,
<PB N="144" REF="000977_0141_0FAE8CD5EBB51258"/>
<HI>Rev.</HI> 22.17. if any thirst (although af∣ter that which will never profit, yet) they shall be welcome here, on the con∣dition foresaid, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.2. all are com∣manded to believe, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.23. The Promises are to all who are externally called by the Gospel; God excludes none, if they do not exclude themselves, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.39 so that if any have a mind for the thing, they may come forward, He will in no wise cast them out, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.37. being able to save to the utmost them who come to God through Him, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25. And these who have long delayed, to take this matter to heart, had now the more need to look to it, lest what be∣longs to their peace, be hid from their eyes▪ But all these words will not take effect with people, until God pour out his Spi∣rit from on high, <HI>Isa.</HI> 32.15. to cause men to approach unto God in Christ; yet we must still press mens duty upon them, and obtest and charge them by the ap∣pearing of the Lord Jesus Christ, and their reckoning to Him in that day, that they give the Lord no rest, until He send out that spirit (which He will give to them who ask it, <HI>Luk.</HI> 11.13.) and cause them to know what belongs unto their
<PB N="145" REF="000977_0142_0FAE8CD6D33753A8"/>
Peace, and bring them up to their Du∣ty.</P>
<P>We come now to speak of the Third thing, viz. <HI>What is previously required of these who are to perform this duty?</HI> Men must not rashly, inconsiderately and ig∣norantly, rush in upon this matter, say∣ing, they please that device of saving Sinners by Christ, and will acquiese and rest on Him for safety: often men do deceive themselves here, and do imagine that they have done the thing. We shall therefore hold out some things pre-re∣quired in a person who is to close with Christ Jesus; which altho' we offer not as positive qualifications, fitting a man for Christ that way, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.1. yet they are such things as without them a man cannot knowingly and cordially perform the duty of believing on Christ Jesus. Beside, the common principles which are t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be supposed in these who live under Gospel-ordinances; As the knowledge that men have immortal Souls, Soul and Body will be united again at the last Day; there is a Heaven and Hell, one of which will be the everlasting lot of all men: the Old and New Testament is the true Word of God, and the rule of
<PB N="146" REF="000977_0143_0FAE8CD777553110"/>
Faith and Manners, every man is by Nature void of the Grace of God, and is an Enemy unto God, and an Heir of Condemnation; Reconciliation is only by the Mediator Christ Jesus; Faith unites unto Him, and is the condition of the New Covenant; Holiness is the fruit of true Faith, and is to be studied as that without which no man shall see God: I say beside these things, the knowledge of which is necessary;</P>
<P N="1">1. It is required of him who would believe on Christ Jesus, That he take to heart his Natural condition. And here he must know somethings, and also be very serious about them: I say, he must know some things; As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That as he was born a Rebel and Out-law unto God, so he hath by many actual Transgressions disobliged God, &amp; ratified the forfeiture of his Favour, yea, a man should know many particular in∣stances of his Rebellion on all hands; As that he is a Liar, Sabbath-breaker, Blasphemer, or the like; as <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh very particularly of himself afterwards, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15.</P>
<P N="2">2. The man must know, that the Wrath of God denounced in Scripture,
<PB N="147" REF="000977_0144_0FAE8CD82B89EB78"/>
is standing in force against these very Sins whereof he is guilty, and so conse∣quently he is the party undoubtedly a∣gainst whom God (who cannot lie) hath denounced War. A man must know, that when the Scripture saith, <HI>Cursed is he that offereth a corrupt thing unto God, Mal.</HI> 1.14. it speaketh against him for his su∣perficial service performed unto God with the outward man, when his heart was far off. When the Word saith, <HI>God will not hold him guiltless, that taketh his Name in vain, Exod.</HI> 20.7 the man must know it speaketh against himself, who hath often carelesly prophaned that dread∣ful Name, before which all knees should bow, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.10. and which his Enemies do take in vain. <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.20. When the Word saith, <HI>Cursed is he that doth the work of the Lord negligently Jer.</HI> 48.10. the man must know that it speaketh against himself, who hath irreverently with much wandering of heart, and drowsiness heard the Word Preached; and without sense, faith or understanding hath often Prayed before Him. When the Word saith, <HI>Wo be unto him who giveth his Neighbour drink; and putteth his bottle to him, to make him drunk also, that he may look upon his naked∣ness,
<PB N="148" REF="000977_0145_0FAE8CD90D16AD70"/>
Hab.</HI> 2 15, 16. the man must know that it is spoken against himself, who hath gloried in making his Neighbour Drunk, and that dreadful Wrath is de∣termined by the Lord against him, accord∣ing to that Scripture. When the Word saith, <HI>God will judge Ʋnclean persons, Heb.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.4. <HI>and will close them out of the New</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.8. the man must know that the Scripture speaketh these very words against him, he being an Unclean person, so that he is the Person against whom the Curses of the Law doth di∣rectly strike.</P>
<P N="3">3. A man must know that he hath nothing of his own to procure his Peace, and to set him free of the hazard under which he lyeth; because all his Righte∣ousness is as an unclean thing, <HI>Isa.</HI> 64.6. his Prayers, his other service done to God, his Almes-deeds, <HI>&amp;c</HI> are not pass-guilt before God, since they came not from a right principle in his heart, and were not performed in a right way, nor upon a right account, nor for a right end; his Sacrifices have been an abomination unto God, <HI>Prov.</HI> 21.27.</P>
<P N="4">4. He must know that as he is void of all the saving Graces of the Spirit, as the
<PB N="149" REF="000977_0146_0FAE8CDA039FD758"/>
true Love of God, the true Fear of His Name, Godly sorrow for Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so par∣ticularly, that he wants F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h in Christ, who taketh burden for all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em who be∣lieve on Him: until a man know this, he will still leave all his debt and burthen, without care or regard at the door of <HI>Christ</HI> the common cautioner.</P>
<P>Now not only must a man know those things, as I said before, but must also very seriously take them to heart, that is to say, he must be affected with these things, and be in sad earnest about them, as he useth to be in other cases, because it is of greater concernment unto him.</P>
<P N="1">1. This seriousness produceth, a taking of Salvation to heart, more than any thing else. Shall men be obliged to see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> the Kingdom? <HI>Mar</HI> 6.33. Is there but one thing necessary? <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.42. Shall <HI>Paul</HI> count all things loss and dung for this matter? <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.8. Is a man a loser, gaining all the World, if he lose his Soul, <HI>Mark</HI> 8.36? Shall this be the only ground of joy, that mens Names are written in the Book of Life? <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.20. And shall not men (who would be reckoned serious) take their Soul and Sal∣vation more to heart, then any thing
<PB N="150" REF="000977_0147_0FAE8CDA8F7F1638"/>
else; Surely it cannot fail. Let none deceive themselves. If the hazard of their Soul and the Salvation thereof, and how to be in favour with God, hath not got nearer to their heart than any thing in the world beside, it cannot be pre∣sumed, upon just grounds, that they ever knew Sin, or God, or the Everlastingness of his wrath aright.</P>
<P N="2">2. This seriousness breaketh the mans heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fainteth the stoutness of it, and leadeth it out to sorrow, as one doth for a <HI>First-born, Zech.</HI> 12.10. I grant, their sorrow will better suit that Scrip∣ture afterwards, when they apprehend Christ pierced by their sins.</P>
<P N="3">3. It leadeth the man to a self-loath∣ing. A man taking up himself so, can∣not but loath himself for his abominati∣ons, whereby he hath destroyed himself. There is somewhat of that Spirit of re∣venge, which is mentioned as a fruit of true repentance, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.11.</P>
<P N="4">4. This seriousness doth make the man peremptory to find relief: since it is not in himself, he dare not put off and delay his business, as before: and this is indeed required, that he find himself so pursued and put to it, that he flee for
<PB N="151" REF="000977_0148_0FAE8CDB6EBBF958"/>
refuge somewhere. I grant some have a higher and some a lesser degree of this seriousness, as we shew in the former part of this Treatise. But if we speak of the Lords ordinary way of working with those who are come to age, we say, they must very seriously take their Souls estate to heart, despairing of help in themselves: since the whole need no Physician, but those who are sick, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.12. As for the measure, we plead only that which doth probably suppose, that a man will be induced thereby to transact cordially with <HI>Christ,</HI> on any terms he doth offer Himself to be closed with.</P>
<P>The second thing pre-required of him who would believe on <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> is, he must know and take to heart the way of escape from Gods wrath: the Spirit must convince him of that righteousness.

<P>The third thing pre-required, is, a man must know that as God hath not ex∣cluded him from the relief appointed, so he is willing to be reconciled unto men through <HI>Christ,</HI> and hath obliged men to close with Him through <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and so to impropriate that Salvation to themselves. He not only invites all to come, <HI>Isa.</HI> 35.1, and welcometh all that come, as we find in the Gospel, and com∣mendeth those who come, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8.10. <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.28. and chideth for not coming and closing with him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.40. and condemneth for not closing so with him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.18. But also he commandeth all to believe on Christ, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.23. So as a man is not to question the Lords willingness to receive men, who go to
<PB N="153" REF="000977_0150_0FAE8CDDD21EF250"/>
Christ honestly; for God hath abundant∣ly cleared that in Scripture: unless that a man know so much, he will scarcely dare to lay his heart open for that noble device of saving sinners, or adventure his own weight and stress upon <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth thing pre-required, is, The man who would close with <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> must resolve to break all Covenants with Hell and Death: <HI>Isa.</HI> 28.15. Whatsoever known evil men are engaged into, they must resolve to forego it: for there is no concord between <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Belial.</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.14, — The Lord requireth that they who would expect Him to be for them, should not be for another, <HI>Hos.</HI> 3.3 This is far from Evangelick repentance, which I grant doth not precede a mans closing with CHRIST by Faith; there is little here beyond a misregard of these things unto which a man was formerly devoted, and a slighting what he was mad upon, because he seeth himself destroyed thereby, and relief now offered, where∣upon his heart beginneth to be more in∣tent than formerly it was. After this, when Christ is lookt upon alone, His worth and beauty doth appear, so as a∣mong

all the gods there is none like un∣to HIM, and he looketh out as a sufficient covering of the Eyes to all who get him. Upon which the heart loveth Gods de∣vice in the New-Covenant, and loveth to lay its weight upon Christ rather than any other way, bending towards him, and so the man becometh a Believer. Now, I will not say that all these things whereof we have spoken, are formally, orderly and distinctly found in every per∣son before he close with God in Christ; for the way of the heart with Christ, may be added to the four wonderful things, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.19. It is hard to trace the heart in its relelation from Darkness to Light; yet we hold out the most or∣dinary and likely way, to him who doth ask the way, debarring thereby ignorant and senseless persons from medling; &amp; discharging them to pretend to any in∣terest in Him whilest they remain such.</P>
<P>The Fourth thing we proposed to speak to, is, <HI>The properties of this Duty when rightly gone about.</HI> I shall only hint a few.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Believing on Christ must be Personal.</HI> A man himself, and in his own proper
<PB N="155" REF="000977_0152_0FAE8CDFAC1DA3E0"/>
person must close with Christ Jesus. <HI>The Just shall live by</HI> His <HI>Faith, Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 2.4. This saith, that it will no suffice for a mans safety and relief, that he is in Co∣venant with God, as a born Member of the visible Church, by vertue of the Pa∣rents subjection to Gods Ordinances. Neither will it suffice that the Person had the initiating S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of baptism added, and that he then virtually engaged to seek Salvation by Christs blood, as all infants do Neither doth it suffice, that men are come of believing Parents; their Faith will not instate their Children into a right to the Spiritual blessings of the Covenant. Neither will it suffice that Parents did in some respect engage for their Children, and give them away unto God: all these things do not avail. The Children of the Kingdom and of Godly Predecessors are cast out; unless a man in his own person put out Faith in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and with his own heart please and acquiese in that device of saving Sinners, he cannot be Saved. I grant this Faith is given unto him by <HI>Christ,</HI> but certain it is, that it must be Personal.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This Duty must be</HI> Cordial <HI>and</HI> Hearty. <HI>With the heart man believeth unto Righte∣ousness.
<PB N="156" REF="000977_0153_0FAE8CE06A470B38"/>
Rom.</HI> 10.10. A man must be sin∣cere and without guile in closing with Christ, judging Him the only covering of the Eyes, not hanckering after another way. The matter must not swim only in the head, or understanding; but it must be in the heart: the man not only must be perswaded that <HI>CHRIST</HI> is the way, but affectionately perswaded of it, loving and liking the thing, having com∣placency in it; so that it is a mans de∣sire, as <HI>David</HI> speaketh of the Covenant, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.5. If a man be cordial and affectionate in any thing, surely he must be so here in this one thing that is ne∣cessary. It must not be simply a fancy in the head, but it must be Heart-business, a Soul-business; yea, not a business in the outer court of affections, but in the flower of affections, and in the innermost cabinet of the soul, where Christ is form∣ed. Shall a man be cordial in any thing, and not in this, which doth comprize all his chief interests, and his everlasting state within it? Shall the Lord be said to rejoyce over a man, as a Bridegroom rejoyceth over his Bride, <HI>Isa.</HI> 62. and to rest in his love with joy, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.17. and shall not the heart of man go out and meet
<PB N="157" REF="000977_0154_0FAE8CE14051C1B0"/>
Him here? The Heart or nothing; Love or nothing; Marriage-love which goeth from heart to heart; Love of Espousals or nothing, <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.26. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.2. I will not say, that there is in all, as soon as they believe, a prevailing sensible love, which maketh sick; but there must be in believing a rational and kindly love, so well grounded, and deeply engaging that many waters cannot quench it: It is strong as Death, and Jealousie in it burneth as fire, <HI>Cant.</HI> 8 6, 7.</P>
<P>The third property or qualification of believing as it goeth out after Christ, <HI>It must be Rational.</HI> Hereby I mean that the man should move towards God in Christ, in knowledge and understanding, taking up Gods device of saving Sinners by <HI>Christ,</HI> as the Scripture doth hold it out, not phansying a CHRIST to him∣self other wayes than the Gospel speaketh of Him, nor any other way of relief by him than the Word of God holdeth out. Therefore we find knowledge joyned to the Covenant between God and Man as a requisite, <HI>Jer.</HI> 24.7. <HI>Jer</HI> 31.34. I mean here also, that a man be in calmness of Spirit, and as it were in his cold blood in closing with <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> not in a sim∣ple
<PB N="158" REF="000977_0155_0FAE8CE327392728"/>
fit of affection which soon vanisheth <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20. Nor in a distemper through some outward distress, as the People were <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.34 and proved not stedfast in the Covenant; nor under a tempta∣tion of some outward temporary interest, as <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mon Magus</HI> was when he believed, <HI>Act.</HI> 8. A man <HI>must</HI> act here rationally, as being Master of himself, in some mea∣sure able to judge of the Good or Evil of the thing as it stands before him.</P>
<P>The fourth is, <HI>Faith as it it goeth out Rationally, so it goeth out Resolutely.</HI> The poor distressed people in the Gospel, did most resolutely cast themselves upon <HI>Christ.</HI> This resoluteness of Spirit, is in order to all difficulties that lie in the way. Violence is offered to these. The man whose heart is a shaping-out for <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> cannot say, <HI>There is a Lyon in the street. Prov.</HI> 26.13. If he cannot have access by the door, he will break through the roof of the house, with that man, <HI>Luk.</HI> 5.19. He often doth not re∣gard that which the world calleth dis∣cretion or prudence, like <HI>Zacheus</HI> climb∣ing upon a Tree to see <HI>Christ,</HI> when Faith was breeding in his bosome, <HI>Luk.</HI> 19
<PB N="159" REF="000977_0156_0FAE8CE3A3C02D08"/>
This resoluteness of Spirit looketh to∣wards what inconveniencies may follow, and waveth all these, at least resolving over all these, like a wise builder who reckoneth the expence beforehand, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.28. This resoluteness is also in or∣der to all a mans Idols, and such weights as would easily beset him, if he did not bend after CHRIST over them all, like that blind man who did cast his Garment from him when <HI>Christ</HI> called him, <HI>Mark</HI> 10.50. This resoluteness in the Soul, proceedeth from desperate self necessity within the man, <HI>Act.</HI> 16.30. and from the soveraign command of God, obliging the man to move towards <HI>Christ,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.23 and from the good report gone abroad of God, that He putteth none away that come unto Him through <HI>Christ, Joh.</HI> 6.37. but doth com∣mend such as do adventure over the greatest difficulties, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.18. But above all, this resoluteness doth proceed from tde Arm of JEHOVAH, secretly and strongly drawing the Sinner towards CHRIST, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6 44. I will not say that every one, closing with <HI>Christ</HI> in the offers of the Gospel, hath all the fore∣said thoughts formally in his mind; yet
<PB N="160" REF="000977_0157_0FAE8CE5E7BC8028"/>
upon search, it will be found, if he be put to it, or put in mind of these things, they are then aloft in the Soul.</P>
<P>By what is said, it doth manifestly ap∣pear that many in the visible Church had need to do somewhat further for securing of their Soul, when they come to years of discretion, then is found to have been done by them before, in the Covenant between God and the Church, sealed to them in Baptism. By what is said also, there is a competent guard upon the free Grace of God in the Gospel, held out through <HI>Christ Jesus</HI>: so as ignorant, senseless, profane men cannot with any shadow of reason pretend to an interest in it. It is true, believing in <HI>Christ</HI> and closing with Him as a perfect Saviour, seemeth easie, and every Godless man saith, that he believeth on Him: But they deceive themselves, since their Soul hath neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cordially, rationally, and resolute∣ly gone out after <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> as we have said. It may be some wicked men have been enlightned, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4 and have found some reel in their fear, <HI>Act.</HI> 24.25. or in their joy, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20. <HI>Mark</HI> 6.20. But not having engaged their heart in approaching to God, <HI>Jer.</HI> 30.20.
<PB N="161" REF="000977_0158_0FAE8CE6E21F90B0"/>
have either sitten down in that common work, as their sanctuary, until the tryal came, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20. or they return back with the Dog to their vomit, from which they had in some measure escaped by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour, 2 <HI>Pet</HI> 2.20. or they utterly fall away to the hatred and malicious despising and persecuting of <HI>Christ</HI> and His <HI>interests</HI>; from whence hardly they can be recover∣ed, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, — <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.26, — which things should provoke men to be serious in this great business.</P>
<P>We come now to speak to the fifth thing proposed, and that is, <HI>What be the native consequents of true believing</HI>? I shall reduce what I will speak of them to these two, viz. <HI>Ʋnion with God,</HI> and <HI>Commu∣nion.</HI></P>
<P>First then, <HI>I say, when a sinner closeth with Christ Jesus,</HI> (as said is) <HI>there is present∣ly an admirable Ʋnion, a strange Oneness be∣tween God and the Man; as the Husband and Wife, Head &amp; Body, Root and Branches are not to be reckoned two but one.</HI> So Christ, or God in Christ, and the sinner closing with him by Faith, are one, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.30, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>He that is so joyned unto the Lord
<PB N="162" REF="000977_0159_0FAE8CE72DD47F88"/>
is one Spirit.</HI> 1 Cor. 6.17. <HI>As the Father is in the Son, and Christ in the Father; so Believers are one in the Father and the Son.</HI> They are one, as the Father and the Son are one: The Father in Christ, and Christ in Believers, that they may be made per∣fect in one. O! what a <HI>strange</HI> inter∣weaving and indissoluble knot there, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.20, —</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Because of this Ʋnion between God and the Believer, they can never hate one ano∣ther.</HI> Henceforth the Lord will never hate the Believer. As no man hateth his own flesh, at any time, but cherish∣eth it and nourisheth it; so doth Christ His People, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.29. He may be angry so as to <HI>correct</HI> and <HI>chastise</HI> the man that is a Believer; but all He doth to him, is for his good and advantage: All the Lords paths <HI>must</HI> be Mercy and Truth to him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 25.10. All things <HI>must</HI> work together for Good to him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.28. On the other side, the Believer can never hate God maliciously; for, <HI>He that is Born of God sinneth not.</HI> So 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3 9. For the Lord hath resolved and ordained things so, that His hand shall undoubted∣ly so be upon all Believers for good, that they shall never get leave to hate
<PB N="163" REF="000977_0160_0FAE8CE7FA4A64D0"/>
Him, and be so plucked out of His hand.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Because of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, there is a strange simpathy and fellow-feeling between God and the Believer.</HI> The Lord is afflicted with the mans affliction, He doth tenderly, carefully and seasonably resent it, as if He were afflicted with it, <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.9. He who toucheth the Believer, toucheth the apple of the Lords Eye, <HI>Zech.</HI> 2.8. He is touched with the feeling of their infirmities, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.15. and precious in His sight is their Blood, <HI>Psal.</HI> 116.15 In a word, what is done to them, is done unto Him; and what is not done to them, is not done unto Him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.45. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.40. — On the other part, the zeal of His house sitteth in the heart of the Believer, <HI>Psal.</HI> 69.9. The Lords reproach lighteth on the Believer: If it go well with his affairs, that is the business of His People. So there is a strange sym∣pathy between God and Believers; all by vertue of the Union between them. Because of which, men should hate every thing which would compete with Him in their Love or Affections, and should disdain to be slaves to the Creatures, since these are the servants of their Lord and Husband, and their servants through

Him. What a hateful thing for a Queen to Whose with the servants of her Prince and Husband? It is also a shame for a Believer to be afraid of Evil tydings, su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Lord, with whom he is one, a∣lone ruleth all things, and doth whatso∣ever pleaseth Him in Heaven and Earth, 1 <HI>Corinthians</HI> 3.21, 23. <HI>Psal.</HI> 112.6, <HI>Psal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.</P>
<P>The other great consequent of Be∣lieving, is, <HI>An unparallel'd Communion.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By vertue whereof, the parties them∣selves do belong each to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her.</HI> The Lord is the God of His People, He Himself, FATHER, SON, and HOLYGHOST, is their God, in all his Glorious Attri∣butes, his Justice as well as his Mercy, his Wisdom, Power, Holiness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For, He becometh the God of his Peole, as he often speaketh in the Covenant. On the other part, The Believers are His People, in their very persons they are his, as the Covenant doth speak: They shall be his People, their head, their heart, then hand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whatsoever they are, they are His.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By vertue of this Communion they have a mutual interest into one anothers whole goods and gear, in as far as can be useful.</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="000977_0162_0FAE8CE9E2AFB320"/>
All the Lords Word doth belong to the Believer▪ Threatnings as well as Promises for their good, all his Wayes, all his Works of all sorts, special Communicati∣ons, Death, Devils even all things, in so far as can be useful, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.21, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> On the other side, all which belongeth to the Believer is the Lords; Heritage, Children, Life, Wife, Credit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all is at his disposing; if any of these can be useful to <HI>Him,</HI> the Believer is to forego them, else he falsyfieth that Communion, and declareth himself in so far, unwor∣thy of Christ, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14.26.</P>

The Believer also may en∣quire into what God doth, in so far as may concern his own duty, or in so far as may ward of mistakes of the Lords way, and reconcile it with his Word; so <HI>Joh.</HI> 13.15.

<P>Although none should charge this Sin on themselves, or on others, unless they can prove and instruct the charge ac∣cording to Christs example, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.5. 26, — 32. yet for satisfying of the doubt;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>I shall shew what is not the Sin against the Holy Ghost, properly so called</HI>; because there be some gross sins which people do unwarrantably judge to be this Un∣pardonable Sin.</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>I shall d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw some conclusions in answer directly to the Objection.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>First,</HI> There be many gross sins, which although (as all other sins) they be sins against the Holy Ghost, who is God equal and one with the Father and the Son, and are done against some of His operations and motions, yet are they not <HI>The Sin against the Holy Ghost,</HI> which is the Unpardonable Sin.</P>
<P>As;</P>
<P N="1">1. Blaspheming of God, under bodily Tortures, is not that Sin for, some Saints fell into this, <HI>Act.</HI> 26.11. much less, Blaspheming of God in a fit of Distraction, or Frenzie; for a man is not a free rational agent at that time, and He that spareth his People, as a Father doth the Son that serveth him, and doth pity, so <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.17. <HI>Psal.</HI> 103.13. doth He spare and pity in these rovings; for, so would our Fathers according to the flesh do, if we Blasphemed them in a fit of Distraction; much less are horrid blas∣phemies against God, darted in upon the Soul, and not allowed there, this Unpar∣donable Sin; for such things were offered
<PB N="177" REF="000977_0174_0FAE8CF6F148BEB8"/>
to Christ, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4. and are often cast in upon the Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. The hating of good in others, whilst I am not convinced that it is good, but in my light do judge it to be evil; yea, the speaking against it, yea, the persecu∣ting of it in that case, is not the Sin a∣gainst the Holy Ghost; for, all these will be found in <HI>Paul</HI> before he was Convert∣ed, and he obtained mercy, because he did these ignorantly·</P>
<P N="3">3. Heart-rising at the thriving of others in the work and way of God, whiles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I love it in my self; yea, the rising of heart against Providence, which often expresseth it self against the Creatures nearest our hand; yea, this rising of heart entertained and maintained, (although they be horrid things leading towards that Unpardonable Sin, yet) are not that Sin; for these may be in the Saints, pro∣ceeding from self love, which cannot en∣dure to be darkned by another, and pro∣ceeding from some cross in their Idol, under a fit of Temptation: the most part of all this was in <HI>Jonah, Jon.</HI> 4.</P>
<P N="4">4. Not only are not decayes in what once was in the man, and falling into gross sins against light, after the receiving of
<PB N="178" REF="000977_0175_0FAE8CF7B4F290C0"/>
the truth, this Unpardonable Sin; (for then many of all the Saints in Scripture were undone) But further, Apostacy from much of the truth, is not that Sin: for that was in <HI>Solomon,</HI> and in the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Galatia</HI>; yea, Denying, yea, Foreswearing of the most fundamen∣tal Truth, under a great temptation, is not this sin; for then <HI>Peter</HI> had been then undone.</P>
<P N="5">5. As resisting, quenching, grieving &amp; vexing of the Spirit of God by many sin∣ful wayes, are not this Unpardonable sin, for they are charged with these, who are called to Repentance in Scripture, and not shut out, as guilty of this sin. So neither reiterating sin against light, is the Sin against the Holy Ghost, although it leadeth towards it; for such was <HI>Pe∣ter</HI>'s sin in denying Christ; so was <HI>Je∣hoshaphat</HI>'s sin in joyning with <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Jehoram.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Purposes and Essayes of Self-murder, and even purposes of murdering Godly men, (the party being under a sad fit of temptation) yea, actual Self-murder, (although probaby it often joyneth in the issue with this Unpardonabe sin, which ought to make every soul look upon the

<P>As for the <HI>Second</HI> thing; Let us see, <HI>that the Sin against the Holy Ghost is?</HI> It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a simple act of transgression, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>complex of many mischievous things,
<PB N="180" REF="000977_0177_0FAE8CFC50AEEF60"/>
involving Soul and Body ordinarily in Guilt. We thus describe it; <HI>It is a Re∣jecting and Opposing of the chief Gospel-truth and way of Salvation, made out sin∣gularly to a man, by the Spirit of God, in the truth and good thereof, and that A∣vowedly, Freely, Wilfully,, Maliciously and Despightfully, breeding hopeless Fear.</HI> There be three places of Scripture, which do speak most of this Sin, and thence we will prove every part of this description, in so far as may be useful to our pre∣sent purpose, by which it will appear that none who have a mind for Christ, need stumble at what is spoken of this sin in Scripture. See <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 24, — 32. <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5, 6. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.25, — 29.</P>
<P><HI>First then,</HI> Let us consider the Object about which this Sin, or sinful acting of the man guilty thereof, is conversant, and that is, <HI>The chief Gospel-truth and way of Salvation</HI>: both which run to one thing. It is the way which God hath contrived for saving of Sinners by Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah and Saviour by whose Death and Righteousness men are to be saved, as he hath held forth in the Ordinances; confirming the same by many mighty works in Scripture tending
<PB N="181" REF="000977_0178_0FAE8CFE0A31C590"/>
there-a-way. This way of Salvation is the Object. The Pharisees oppose this, that Christ was the Messiah, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. 23, 24. The wrong is done against the Son of God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.6. and the Blood of the Covenant, and the Spirit graciously offering to apply these things, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.29.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In the description, consider the qualification of this Object; <HI>It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gularly made out to the party, by the Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of God, both in the truth and good thereof</HI>▪ This saith, (1.) That there must be knowledge of the truth and way of Sal∣vation. The Pharisees knew that Christ was the Heir, <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.38. The party hath knowledge, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.26. (2.) That knowledge of the thing, must not swim only in the head, but there must be some half-heart perswasion of it. Christ knew the Pharisees thoughts, and so did judge them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.25. and that the contra∣ry of what they spake was made out upon their heart. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is a tasting, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5. which is beyond simple enlightning; yea, there is such a perswasion ordina∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s leadeth to a deal of outward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.29. (2.) This per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asion must not only be of the verity
<PB N="182" REF="000977_0179_0FAE8CFF05E500B0"/>
of the thing but of the good of it. The party tasteth the good word of God, and he apprehendeth the thing as eligible, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.5 (4.) This perswasion is not made o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t only by strength of argument, but also by an enlightning work of Gods Spirit, shining on the truth, and making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conspicuous. Therefore is that Sin called, <HI>The Sin against the Holy Ghost, Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Mark</HI> 3. The persons are said to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e received the Holy Ghost, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6 4. and to do despight unto the Spirit of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, who was in the nearest step of a gracious opera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion with them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.29.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> In this description, consider the acting of the party against the Ob∣ject so qualified; <HI>it is a rejecting and op∣posing of it</HI>: which importeth,</P>
<P N="1">1. That men have once some way at least, been in hands with it, or had the offer of it, as is true of the Pharisees.</P>
<P N="2">2. That they do reject, even with con∣tempt what they had of it, or in their offer▪ The Pharisees deny it, and speak disdainfully of Christ, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.24. They fall away, intending to shame Christ, <HI>Heb</HI> 6.5, 6</P>
<P N="3">3. The men set themselves against it
<PB N="183" REF="000977_0180_0FAE8CFF2AB4A5D0"/>
by the spirit of Persecution, as the Pha∣risees did still. They rail against it: therefore it is called, <HI>Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, Mat.</HI> 12.24.31. They would Crucifie CHRIST again, if they could, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6 6. They are adversaries, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.27.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Consider the properties of this acting.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is <HI>Avowed:</HI> that is, not seeking to shelter or hide it self. The Pha∣risees spake against Christ publickly, <HI>Mat</HI> 12.24. They would have Christ brought to an <HI>Open shame, Heb.</HI> 6.6. They for∣sake the Ordinances which savour that way, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.25 and despise the dan∣ger: for, looking for indignation, they trample that blood still, <HI>Heb.</HI> 27, 29.</P>
<P N="2">2. The party acteth <HI>Freely</HI>: It is not from unadvisedness, nor from force or constraint, but an acting of free choice; Nothing doth force the Pharisees to speak against and persecute Christ. They Crucifie to <HI>Themselves,</HI> they re-act the Murder of their own free accord, and in their own bosome, none constraining them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.6. They sin of free choice; as the word is, <HI>Spontaneously, Heb.</HI> 10.27.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="184" REF="000977_0181_0FAE8D000527DAD0"/>3. It is acted <HI>Wilfully.</HI> They are so resolute, they will not be disswaded by any offer, or the most precious means, as is clear in the foresaid Scriptures.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is done <HI>Maliciously</HI>; so as it pro∣ceeds not so much, if at all, from a temptation to pleasure, profit, or honour; It proceedeth not from fear, or force, or from any good end proposed; but out of heart-malice against God and Christ, and the advancement of His Glo∣ry and Kingdom. So that it is of the very nature of Satans sin, who hath an irreconcileable hatred against God, and the remedy of Sin, because his Glory is thereby advanced: This is a special ingredient in this Sin. The Pharisees are found guilty of heart-malice against Christ, since they speak so against Him, and not against their own Children cast∣ing out Devils; and this is the force of Christs argument, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.27. They do their utmost to Crucifie <HI>Christ</HI> again, and to bring Him to an open shame, <HI>Heb</HI> 6.6, They are adversaries like the Devil, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.27.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is done <HI>Despightfully.</HI> The malice must bewray it self. The Pharisees must proclaim that <HI>Christ</HI> hath correspondence
<PB N="185" REF="000977_0182_0FAE8D01ACD91C10"/>
with Devils, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12. He must be put to an open shame, and Crucified again, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. They must tread under foot that Blood, and do despight to the Spirit, <HI>Heb</HI> 10.29. So that the party had rather perish a thousand times, than be in <HI>Christs</HI> debt for Salvation. The last thing in the description, is, the ordinary atten∣dant or consequence of this sin: <HI>It breed∣eth desperate and hopeless Fear.</HI> They fear Him, whom they hate with a slavish hopeless fear, such as Devils have <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.27. They know that God will put out His power against them: they trem∣ble in the rememmbrance of it; And if they could be above Him, and destroy Him, they covet it; and since they can∣not reach that, they hate with the ut∣most of heart-malice, and do persecute Him and all that is His, with despight.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Third</HI> thing proposed, viz. <HI>The Conclusions to be drawn from what is said, whereby we will speak directly to the Objection.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As I hinted before, since the Sin a∣gainst the Holy Ghost is so remarkable, and may be well known where it is, none should charge themselves with it, unless they can prove and instruct the charge</HI>: for it
<PB N="186" REF="000977_0183_0FAE8D022DADD518"/>
it is a great wrong done unto God, to labour to perswade my Soul that He will never Pardon me: it is the very way to make me desperate, and to load me to the Unpardonable Sin.

sometimes God doth offer to be our God without any mention of Christ, and some∣times saith, that He will betroth us unto Him; and in other places of Scripture, we are called to come to Christ, and He is the Bridegroom. Again, God sometimes speaketh of Himself as a Father to men, sometimes as a Husband: Christ is sometimes called the Husband, and sometimes a Brother, which Relations seem inconsistent, and do much put me in the dark how to apprehend God when my heart would agree with him, and close with him.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answ.</HEAD>
<P>It may be very well said, that men do come to God, or close with Him, and yet they come to Christ and close with Him. They may be said to come under a Marriage-relation unto God, and unto Christ also, who is <HI>Husband, Father, Brother, &amp;c.</HI> to them, and there is no such mysterie here, as some do conceive. For the better understanding of it, consider these few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Although God made man perfect at the beginning, and put him in some ca∣pacity of transacting with Him immedi∣ately, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7 29. <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.16, 17 yet man by his Fall, did put himself at a perfect
<PB N="193" REF="000977_0190_0FAE8D0B2B2810B0"/>
distance with God, and in a utter inca∣pacity to bargain or deal any more with Him immediately.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord did, after <HI>Adam</HI>'s fall, make manifest the New Covenant, in which he did signifie that he was content to transact with man again, in &amp; through a Mediator; and so did appoint men to come to Him through <HI>Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Heb</HI> 7.25. and to look for acceptation only in him, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.6. Ordaining men to hear Christ, He being the only party, in whom God was well pleased, <HI>Mat.</HI> 17.5.</P>
<P N="3">3. This matter is so clear, and sup∣posed to be so not our in the Scripture, and so manifest to all who are under the Ordinances, that the Lord doth often speak of transacting with Himself, not making mention of the Mediator; be∣cause it is supposed, that every one in the Church knoweth that now there is no dealing with God, except by and through Christ Jesus the Mediator.</P>
<P N="4">4. Consider that <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> God-man is not only a sit trysting place for God and Men to meet into, and a fit spokes∣man to treat between the parties now at variance, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.10. but we may say also, He is immediate Bridegroom,
<PB N="194" REF="000977_0191_0FAE8D0C35B08990"/>
and so our closing or transacting with God, may be justly called, <HI>The Marriage of the Kings Son</HI>; and the Elect may be called, <HI>The Lambs Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI>: Christ Jesus be∣ing as it were, the hand which God hold∣eth out unto men, and on which they lay hold when they deal with God. And so through and by <HI>Christ,</HI> we close with God as our God, on whom our Soul doth terminate, lastly and ultimately through <HI>Christ,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.21.</P>
<P N="5">5. Consider, that the diverse relations mentioned in Scripture, are set down to signifie the sure and indissoluble Union and Communion between God and His People: whatsoever nearness is between Head and Members, Root and Branches, King and Subjects, Shepherd and Flock, Father and Children, Brother &amp; Brother, Husband and Wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all is here, <HI>Joh.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, 22, 23, 26. So that whatsoever be spoken in Scripture, People may be clear that God calleth them to be recon∣ciled unto Him through <HI>Christ,</HI> and doth offer Himself to be their God and Hus∣band in Him alone; and men are to ac∣cept God to be their God in <HI>Christ,</HI> pleasing that way of relief for poor man, and to give up themselves unto God in
<PB N="195" REF="000977_0192_0FAE8D0CDB328640"/>
<HI>Christ,</HI> in whom alone they can be ac∣cepted. And they who close with Christ, they do close with God in Him, who is in Christ reconciled the world to him∣self, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.8, 9, 10, 11. And we are not to dip further into the diverse relations mentioned in Scripture, between God or Christ, and Men, then as they may point out Union and Com∣munion, or nearness with God through <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and our advantage thereby.</P>
<P>These things being clear, we will not multiply words. But, since to believe on Christ is the great duty, required of all that hear this Gospel, we obtest every one, in the Lords Name, to whom the report of this shall come, that without delay they take to heart their lost con∣dition in themselves, and that they lay to heart the relief which God hath pro∣vided by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> whereof he hath made a free offer unto all who will be content of the same, and to be saved that way.

close with Christ Jesus, and accept Gods offer of Salvation through Him, and so make a Covenant with God.</HI> And this by Gods blessing may contribute not a little for establishing them about their saving Interest in God.</P>
<P>Before I speak directly to this express Covenanting with God, I promise these few things;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>I do not here intend a Covenanting with God, essentially differing from the Cove∣nant between God and the visible Church, as the Lord doth hold it out in His revealed Will.</HI> Neither do I intend a Covenant, differing essentially from that transacting of the heart with God in Christ, for∣merly spoken unto: It is that same Co∣venant, only it differeth by a singular cir∣cumstance, <HI>viz.</HI> the formal expression of the thing which the heart did before practice.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>I grant this express Covenanting and Transacting with God, is not absolutely necessary for a mans Salvation</HI>: For, if any person close heartily and sincerely with God, offering himself in Christ, in the Gospel, his soul and state is thereby secu∣red, according to the Scripture, although <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e utter not words with his mouth. But
<PB N="199" REF="000977_0196_0FAE8D1235D91C48"/>
this express verbal Covenanting with God, is very expedient, for the better being of a mans state, and his more com∣fortable maintaining of an interest in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This express Covenanting with God by word of Mouth, is of no worth, without sincere heart-closing with God in Christ joyned with it</HI>: For without that, it is but a prophaning of the Lords Name, and a mocking of Him to his face, so to draw near unto him with the lips, whilest the heart is far away from him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>I grant, both Cordial and Verbal tran∣sacting with God, will not make out a mans gracious estate unto him, so as to put and keep it above controversie, without the joynt-witness of the Spirit, by which we know what is freely given unto us of God</HI>; yet this explicite way of transacting with God, joyned with the heart closing with Him in Christ, contributes much for clearing up unto a man, that there is a fixed bargain between God and him, and will do much to ward off him many ground∣less jealousies and objections of an un∣stable mind and heart, which useth af∣frontedly to deny this hour, what it did really act and perform the former hour.
<PB N="200" REF="000977_0197_0FAE8D12B1D55AD0"/>
This explicite Covenanting, is as an in∣strument taken of what past between God and the Soul, and so hath its own advantage for strengthening of Faith.</P>
<P>As for this express Covenanting, we shall (1.) Shew that it a very warranta∣table practice. (2.) We shall shew shortly what is preparatorily required of those who do so transact with God. (3.) How men shall go about that duty. (4.) What should follow thereupon.</P>
<P>As to the First, <HI>I say, it is a warranta∣ble practice and an incumbent duty, expresly and by word to Covenant with God.</HI> Which appeareth thus:</P>
<P N="1">1. In many places of Scripture (if we look to what they may bear accord∣ing to their scope and the analogy of Faith) God hath commanded it, and left it on people as a duty, Isa. 44.5. <HI>One shall say, I am the Lords,</HI> Isa, 45 24. <HI>Sure∣ly shall one say in the Lord have I righteous∣ness and strength,</HI> Jer. 3.4. <HI>Wilt thou cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my Youth.</HI> Zec. 13.9. <HI>They shall say, the Lord is my God,</HI> Hos. 2.16. <HI>Thou shalt call me Ishi</HI>; and in many places else∣where. Now since God hath so clearly left i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on men in the Letter of the
<PB N="201" REF="000977_0198_0FAE8D1373686E50"/>
Word, they may be perswaded, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a practice warranted and allowed by Him, and well pleasing unto Him.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2. It is the approven practice of the Saints in Scripture, thus expresly to Covenant with God, and they have found much quiet in that duty afterwards. <HI>David</HI> did often expresly say unto God, that he was his God, his Portion, and that himself was his Servant <HI>Thomas</HI> will put his interest out of question with it, <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.28 Yea, I say, the Saints are much quieted in remembrance of what hath past that way between God and them, <HI>Psal.</HI> 73.25. <HI>Psal.</HI> 142.5. We find it often in the Book of the <HI>Canticles.</HI> Now shall the chief worthies of God be so much in Duty, breeding so much quiet and satisfaction to them in many cases, and shall we be under the New Testa∣ment, unto whom access is ministred a∣bundantly, and who partake of the sap of the Olive; shall we (I say) ly behind in this approven piece of homeliness with God? Since we study to imitate that Cloud of witnesses in other things, (as Faith, Zeal, Patience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) let us also imitate them in this.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="000977_0199_0FAE8FC94D54BC28"/><HI>Arg.</HI> 3. The thing about which we move here, is a matter of the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concernment in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he world: It is the Life of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. 32.47. Oh! shall men study to be Express Explicite, Plain and Peremptory in all their other great businesses, because they are such, and shall they not much more be peremptory and express in this, which doth most concern them? I wonder that many not only do not speak it with their mouth, but that they do not Swear and subscribe it with their hand, and do not every thing for securing of God to themselves in Christ, and themselves unto God, which the Scripture doth warrant, <HI>Isa.</HI> 44.5.</P>
<P>This also may have its own weight, as an argument to press this way of Cove∣nanting with God. The business of in∣terest in Christ, and of real and honest transacting with him, is a thing, which in the experience of Saints, is most fre∣que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly brought upon debate and in question. Therefore men had need, all the wayes they can, even by Thought, Word and Deed, to put it to a point.</P>
<P>This also may have place here for pressing this as a duty, That God is so formal, express, distinct and legal, (to
<PB N="203" REF="000977_0200_0FAE8FCA263952F8"/>

He must be Chosen, Called, Authorized and Sent; Covenants for∣mally drawn between the Father and Him, the Father accepting payment and satis∣faction, giving formal discharges, all done clearly and expresly. Shall the Lord be so express, plain and peremptory in e∣very part of the business, and shall our par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it rest in a confused <HI>Thought,</HI> and we be as dumb Beasts before him? If it were a Marriage between Man and Wife, it would not be j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d enough, although there were con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in heart given by the Woman, and k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Man, if she did never express so much by word, be∣ing in a capacity to do so. Now this Covenant between God and Man, is held out in Scripture, as a Marriage between man and wife, <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.19, 20. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11 2. The whole Song of <HI>Solomon</HI> speaketh it. The Lord useth similitudes, to signi∣fie unto us what he intends; and surely this is a special requisite in Marriage, that the Wife give an express and ex∣plicit consent unto the business: the Man saith so, <HI>I take thee to be my lawful Wife,
<PB N="204" REF="000977_0201_0FAE8FCCAF95CB10"/>
and do oblige my self to be a dutiful Husband</HI>: The Woman is obliged on the other part, to express her consent, and to say, <HI>Even so I take thee to be my lawful Husband and do promise Duty and Subjections.</HI> It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so here; the Lord saith, I do betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and thou s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alt call me <HI>Ishi,</HI> my Husband, <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.

<P N="1">1. <HI>In the time of great backsliding, people were wont to renew the Covenant with God, and we should do so also</HI>: our heart should go out after Christ, in the Promises of reconciliation with God, for He is our Peace upon all occasions, and our Advo∣cate, and we are bound to apprehend him so, when we transgress, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.1 and to express so much by word as the Saints did in their formal renewing of the Covenant.</P>

<P N="3">3 <HI>When men apprehend God to be at a distance from them, and their Soul to be un∣der withering and decay, then it is safest heartily to close with Christ, and embrace him by Faith for securing of the Soul, and it were good to put it out of question, by the expression of the thing:</HI> This is the ready <HI>way</HI> to draw sap from Christ the root, for recovering of the Soul, &amp; for establish∣ing the heart before Him.

and openly, and do r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceive the Seal of it: it is therefore beseeming, at that time, to bring up both heart and tongue to second and answer our pro∣fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, apprehending God to be our God, and resigning over our selves to be his, and at his disposing. We shall not con∣fine the Lords People to times and sea∣sons of this duty: the Lord may bind it upon them at his pleasure; only there is h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zard, that by too frequent express Covenanting with God, men turn too formal in it, therefore, it is not so fit that people should cordially at full length renew that explicite transaction with God, but rather to declare unto God, that they adhere unto the Covenant made with Him, and that they do maintain &amp; never will revoke nor recal the same; and withal, <HI>they may</HI> hint the sum of it, in laying claim unto God in Christ, as their own God; and this <HI>they may</HI> do often, even in all their addresses to God, and probably this is the thing designed by the Saints in their so ordinary practice in Scripture, whilst they assert their in∣terest in God, as their God and Portion; and it is fit that men in all their walk, hold their heart at the business, by heart-cleaving

to God in Christ; <HI>The life w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> live in the Flesh, should be by Faith in the Son of God,</HI> Gal. 2.20.</P>
<P>As to the Second thing, viz. <HI>What is preparatorily required of him who is expresly to transact with God here; besides what we spake before, as previous to a mans closing with Christ Jesus?</HI> We only add;</P>
<P N="1">1. That he who would explicitly bar∣gain with God, must know, that to do so, is warranted and allowed by God, as we shew before if this be wanting, a man cannot do it in Faith, and so it will be sin unto him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.23.</P>
<P N="2">2. The man must labour to bring up his heart to the thing, that it do not be∣lie the tongue; It will be a great mock∣ing of God, so to draw near Him with the lips, whilst the heart is far off from Him, <HI>Isa.</HI> 25.13.</P>
<P>The Third thing to be considered in this express verbal Covenanting with God, is, <HI>The way how it is to be performed and managed.</HI> And beside what was said before in heart-closing with Christ; I add here,</P>
<P N="1">1. The man should do it <HI>Confidently,</HI> not only believing that he is about his duty when he doth it, but also that God
<PB N="209" REF="000977_0206_0FAE8FD11E324920"/>

A <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> is accepted, since it is all the Poor womans substance, <HI>Mark.</HI> 12.44. Yea, if it can be attained, the man should bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that the issue and consequence of this transacting shall prove comfortable, and all shall be well, and that God, who engageth for all in the Covenant, (since he hath determined the man to this hap∣py choice) will in some measure make him forth-coming, and will perfect what concerns him; Faithful is He who hath promised, who will also do it, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. If this confidence be wanting, the matter will be done with much fear and jealousie, if not worse, and will still prove a disquieting business to the man.</P>
<P N="2">2. It should be done <HI>Holily.</HI> It is cal∣led, <HI>The Holy Covenant, Luk.</HI> 1.72. The holy things of <HI>David, Act.</HI> 13.34. Here it were fitting, that what is done in this express transacting with God, should not be done passingly, and on the by, but in some special address unto God; the thing should be spoken unto the Lord, <HI>Psal.</HI> 142.5. It is beseeming in so great a bu∣siness,
<PB N="210" REF="000977_0207_0FAE8FD1AB3D1780"/>
that a piece of time were set apart for Confession and Supplication before God: yea, also the person so transacting with God, should labour to have high ap∣prehensions of Gods greatness and sove∣raignty, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7.22. Although He thus humble Himself to behold things in Hea∣ven and Earth, and these high and holy thoughts of Him, will and should be at∣tended with debasing and humbling thoughts of self, although admitted to this high dignity, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7.18. It is no small thing to be allied unto, and with the Great GOD of Heaven, and His Son CHRIST; as <HI>David</HI> speaketh, when King <HI>Saul</HI> did offer his Daughter unto him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18.22. Yea further, there should be special guarding and watching, that the heart keep Spiritual in tran∣sacting with God; there is great reason for this holy way of performing the duty; for, men are ready to mistake them∣selves, and to shape the Lord according to their own fancy, and to turn carnal in the business; since it is a Marriage transaction held out in all the ordinary <HI>Expressions</HI> of Love, as in the Song of <HI>So∣lomon,</HI> Isa. 62.5. <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.17.</P>
<P>The Fourth thing we shall speak a
<PB N="211" REF="000977_0208_0FAE8FD238153168"/>
word unto, is, <HI>What should f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow upon this express verbal Covenanting with God:</HI> I say, beside that Union and Communion with God in Christ, following upon believing, if a man explicitely by word transact with God;</P>
<P N="1">1. He should thenceforth be singularly careful to abide close by God in all man∣ner of Conversation: For, if a man thence∣forth do any thing unsuitable, he doth falsifie his word before God, which will stick much in his Conscience, and prove a snare: if a man henceforth mistake God, and take on him to dispose of him∣self, since he is not his own, and hath opened his Mouth unto the Lord, he makes enquiry after vowes, and devour∣eth that which is holy, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. He who so transacteth with God, should hold stedfast that determination and conclusion. It is a shame for a man, whose heart hath closed with God, and whose mouth hath ratified and confirmed it solemnly before Him, to contradict himself again, and to admit any thing to the contrary, he ought boldly to main∣tain the thing against all deadly.</P>

<P>It is to be regrated that mens heart doth not, with much bensail of desire and affection, embrace &amp; welcome that bles∣sed offer and portion: Yet for answer to the objection, remember; (1.)

<P N="1">1. You have already entered Covenant with God, as you are a Member of His visible Church, and what is now prest up∣on you, is, but that you more heartily, sin∣cerely,

particularly, and more expresly Covenant and Transact with Him; you are already obliged heartily to close with God in Christ, and if you do it in heart, I hope the hazard is no greater by saying that you do so, or have done so.</P>
<P N="2">2. What will you do if you shift hearty transacting with God in Christ, &amp; do not accept His peace as it is offered?

<P N="3">3. If people may scar at Covenanting with God because they will afterwards transgress; Then not one man should Covenant with God: for surely every one will transgress afterwards, if they live any length of time after the transaction; and we know no way like this to secure men from falling: for if you Covenant honestly with Him, he engageth, beside the new heart, to put His Fear &amp; Law therein, to give his Spirit to cause you to walk in His way: And when you Cove∣nant with God, you deliver up your self unto Him to be sanctified, and made con∣form to His will. It is rather a giving up of your self to be led in his way in all

things, and kept from every evil way, than any formal engagement on your part, to keep His way, and to hold off from evil.

<P N="4">4. As it is hard for any to say confi∣dently they will transgress, if such a temptation did offer, so &amp; so circumstan∣tiate, because men men may think that either God will keep a temptation out of their way, or not suffer them to be tempt∣ed above what they are able to bear, or give to them a way of escape, <HI>Psal</HI> 46.1 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.13.

<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>Answ.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Men are not to expect fruitfulness
<PB N="224" REF="000977_0221_0FAE8FDEF0162670"/>
according to their desire, nor full assurance of Gods favour, immediately after they have fled unto Christ, &amp; expresly transact∣ed with God in Him These things will keep a man on work all his dayes. The Saints had their failings &amp; short comings, yea, and backslidings, with many fits of dangerous mis-belief, after they had <HI>very</HI> seriously and expresly closed with God, as their God in Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. Many do look for fruitfulness in their walk and establishment of Faith, from their own <HI>Sincerity</HI> in transacting with God, rather than from the Spirit of the Lord Jesus. They heft their heart in their own honesty and resolutions, and not in the blessed root Christ Jesus, without whom we can do nothing, and are vanity in our best estate. Men should remem∣ber, that one piece <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Grace cannot pro∣duce any degree of Grace; further, no∣thing can work Grace, but the Arm of Jehovah: and if men would lean unto Christ, and Govenant with Him as their duty absolutely, whatsoever may be the consequence, at least, looking only to Him for the suitable fruit, it should fare better with them: God pleaseth not, that men should betake themselves unto Christ, &amp;
<PB N="225" REF="000977_0222_0FAE8FDFB17D8E40"/>
Covenant with Him for a season, until they see if such &amp; such fruit &amp; establish∣ment shall follow, purposing to disclaim their interest in Him and the Covenant, if such and such fruit doth not appear within such a length of time. This is to put the wayes of God to a tryal, and is very displeasing unto Him: men must absolutely close with CHRIST and Covenant with HIM, resolving to maintain these things as their duty, and a ready way to reach fruit, what∣soever should follow thereupon, they having a <HI>Testimony</HI> within them, that they seriously design conformity to His re∣vealed Will in all things; and that they have closed Covenant with Him for the same end, as well as to be saved <HI>thereby.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Men should be sparing to bring in question their <HI>sincerity</HI> in transacting with God, unless they can instruct the same, or have great presumptions for it. If you can instruct any deceit or guile in your transacting with Him, you are ob∣liged to disclaim and rectisie it, and to transact with God <HI>honestly,</HI> and without <HI>Guile</HI>: But if you know nothing of your deceit, or guile, in the day you did tran∣sact with him; Yea, you can <HI>say,</HI> that
<PB N="226" REF="000977_0223_0FAE8FE0D842EC18"/>
<HI>you</HI> did appeal unto God in that <HI>day,</HI> that <HI>you</HI> dealt <HI>honestly</HI> with him, and intended not to deceive; and did obtest Him ac∣cording to His Faithfulness, to <HI>Search</HI> &amp; <HI>Try</HI> if there was any crookedness in <HI>your way,</HI> and to discover it unto you, and heal it, <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.23, 24. and afterwards <HI>you</HI> came to the light, that <HI>your</HI> deeds might be made manifest, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.20, 21. And <HI>you</HI> can say, that Gods answer from His Word to <HI>you,</HI> in so far as <HI>you</HI> could understand, were answers of Peace, and confirmations of <HI>your</HI> Sincerity. Yea further, You dare say, that if upon Life &amp; Death, <HI>you</HI> were again to transact with Him, <HI>you</HI> can do it no other <HI>way,</HI> nor in∣tending more sincerity and seriousness then before: Then I dare <HI>say</HI> unto thee, in the Lords Name, thou ought not to question <HI>thy Sincerity</HI> in transacting with God, but to have confidence before God, since <HI>thy</HI> heart doth not Condemn thee, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.21. And thou art bound to be∣lieve, that God dealeth <HI>Ʋprightly</HI> with the <HI>Ʋpright</HI> man, and with the <HI>Pure</HI> doth shew himself <HI>Pure,</HI> Psal. 18.25, 26. If a man intend <HI>Honesty,</HI> God will not suffer him to beguile himself, Yea, the Lord suffereth no man to deceive himself, un∣less
<PB N="227" REF="000977_0224_0FAE8FE2385F80D8"/>
the man intend to deceive both God and Men.</P>
<P N="4">4. Therefore, impute your unfruit∣fulness to your unwatchfulness and your misbelief, &amp; impute your want of full assu∣rance, unto an evil heart of unbelief, help∣ed by Satan to act against the glorious free Grace of God, and charge not these things upon want of sincerity in your clo∣sing with Christ. And resolve henceforth to abide close by the root, and you shall bring forth more fruit; and by much fruit you lay your self open to the wit∣ness of Gods Spirit, which will testifie with your spirit, that you have sincere∣ly and honestly closed with God, &amp; that the rest of your works are wrought in God and approven of Him; and so the witness of the Spirit &amp; the Water, joyn∣ing with Blood, whereupon you are to lay the weight of your Soul and Conscience; and where alone you are to sink the Cur∣ses of the Law due unto you for all your sins, and failings in your best things. These three do agree in one, <HI>viz.</HI> that this is the way of Life and Peace, and that you have interest therein, and so you come to quietness and full assurance,

<HEAD>The whole TREATISE resumed in a few <HI>Questions</HI> and <HI>Answers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>WHAT is the great business a man hath to do in the world?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> To make sure a Saving Interest in Christ Jesus, and to walk suitably thereunto.</P>
<P>Quest· 2. <HI>Have not all the Members of the visible Church a Saving Interest in Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> No verily; yea, but a very few of them have it.</P>
<P>Quest 3. <HI>How shall I know if I have a Sa∣ving interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Ordinarily the Lord prepareth His own way in the Soul, by a work of Hu∣miliation, and discovereth a mans sin &amp; misery to him, and exerciseth him so therewith, that he longs for the Physi∣cian Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>Quest. 4. <HI>How shall I know if I have got a competent discovery of my sin and misery?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> A competent sight of it, maketh a man take Salvation to heart above any thing in this world: It maketh him dis∣claim
<PB N="230" REF="000977_0227_0FAE8FE6AA6662A8"/>
all relief in himself, even in his best things: It maketh Christ, who is the Redeemer, very precious to the Soul: It maketh a man stand in awe to sin afterwards, maketh him content to be saved upon any terms God pleaseth.</P>
<P>Quest. 5. <HI>What other way may I discern a Saving interest in Him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> By the going out of my heart se∣riously &amp; affectionately towards Him, as He is held out in the Gospel, and this is Faith or Believing.</P>
<P>Quest. 6. <HI>How shall I know if my heart goeth out after Him aright, and that my Faith is true Saving Faith?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Where the heart goeth out aright after Him, in true and saving Faith, the Soul pleaseth Christ alone above all things, &amp; pleaseth Him in all His three Offices, to rule and instruct as well as to save; and is content to cleave unto Him, whatsoever inconvenience may follow.</P>
<P>Quest. 7. <HI>What other marks of a Saving interest in Christ can you give to me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> He that is in Christ savingly, is a New Creature, he is graciously changed and renewed in some measure in the whole man, &amp; in all his wayes; point∣ing
<PB N="231" REF="000977_0228_0FAE8FE78EBDA6B0"/>
towards all the known Commands of God.</P>
<P>Quest. 8. <HI>What if I find sin now and then prevail over me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Although every Sin deserveth everlasting vengeance, yet if thou be afflicted for your failings, confess them with shame of face unto God, resol∣ving to strive against them honestly henceforth, and flee unto Christ for Pardon, you obtain mercy, and interest stands sure.</P>
<P>Quest. 9. <HI>What shall the man do who can∣not lay claim to Christ Jesus, nor any of those marks spoken of?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Let him not take rest, until he make sure unto himself a Saving interest in Christ.</P>
<P>Quest 10. <HI>What way can a man make sure an interest in Christ, who never had a Saving interest in Him hitherto?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> He must take his Sins to heart, &amp; his great hazard thereby, and he must take to heart Gods offer of Pardon and Peace through Christ Jesus, and hearti∣ly close with Gods offer, by betaking himself unto Christ, the blessed refuge.</P>
<P>Quest. 11. <HI>What if my sins be singularly hei∣nous and great beyond ordinary?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="000977_0229_0FAE8FE7F6497DD0"/><HI>Answ.</HI> Whatsoever thy sins be, if thou wilt close with Christ Jesus by Faith, thou shalt never enter into Condemna∣tion.</P>
<P>Quest. 12. <HI>Is Faith in Christ only required of me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Faith is the only condition, upon which God doth offer Peace and Par∣don unto men: But be assured, Faith, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a true and saving, will not be a∣lone in the Soul, but will be attended wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> true repentance, and a thankful study of conformity to Gods Image.</P>
<P>Quest. 13. <HI>How shall I be sure that my heart doth accept of Gods offer, and doth close with Christ Jesus?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o make a Covenant expresly, &amp; by word speak the thing unto God.</P>
<P>Quest 14. <HI>What may shall I do that?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Set apart same bit of time, and having considered your own lost estate, and the relief offered by Christ Jesus, work up your heart to please and close with that offer, and say unto God expresly, that you do accept of that offer, and of Him to be your God in Christ; and do give up your self to be saved in His way, without reservation or exception in any case; and that you
<PB N="233" REF="000977_0230_0FAE8FE8C91E3E68"/>
henceforth will wait for Salvation in the way He hath appointed.</P>
<P>Quest. 15. <HI>What if I break unto God after∣wards?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> You must resolve on His strength not to break, &amp; watch over your own way, and put your heart in His hand to keep it: And if you break, you must confess it unto God, and judge your self for it, and flee to the Advocate for Pardon, and resolve to do no more so: and this you must do as often as you fail.</P>
<P>Quest. 16. <HI>How shall I come to full assu∣rance of my interest in Christ, so as it may be above controversie?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Learn to lay your weight upon the Blood of Christ, and study Purity and Holiness in all manner of Conversation, and Pray for the witness of Gods Spi∣rit, to joyn with the Bloud and the Water; and His Testimony added un∣to these, will establish you in the Faith of an interest in CHRIST.</P>
<P>Quest. 17. <HI>What is the Consequence of such closing with God in Christ, by Heart and Mouth</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Union and Communion with God, all good here, and His Blessed fellow∣ship
<PB N="234" REF="000977_0231_0FAE8FE9A8035110"/>
in Heaven for ever afterwards.</P>
<P>Quest. 18. <HI>What if I slight all these things, and not lay them to Heart, to put them in Practice?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Lord cometh with His An∣gels in flaming Fire, to render Ven∣geance to them who obey not this Gospel; and thy Judgment shall be greater then the Judgment of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI>; and so much the great∣er that thou hast Read this Treatise: For, it shall be a Witness against thee in that Day.</P>
