<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1756" UNIT="year"/> I HAVE received an Account from Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> sent me by Sir <HI>Charles Hardy,</HI> Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> that, immediately after the Council held at <HI>Fort Johnson,</HI> De∣puties were dispatched by the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to <HI>Atsaningo,</HI> and that they convened the <HI>Delawares, Shawanese,</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> from the several Towns on the <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> to the Number of Three Hundred, to whom they delivered Messages from that Council, blaming them for taking up the Hatchet against their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and command∣ing them to lay it down immediately; and that they had hearkened to this Message, and agreed to strike no more.—What I tell you is in this Letter. [<HI>Here the Governor gave Mr.</HI> Welser <HI>Sir</HI> Charles Hardy's <HI>Letter of the 16th of</HI> April, <HI>to interpret to them. And when he had made them understand what Sir</HI> Charles Hardy <HI>had wrote, the Governor took a Belt in his Hand, and proceeded.</HI>]</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I think it necessary that the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Wioming,</HI> as well Enemies as Friends, should know, that Sir <HI>Charles Hardy</HI> has sent this Account to me from Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI>; and as two of you are of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and one a <HI>Delaware,</HI> I think it proper that you should undertake to notify this to them; and at the same Time to let them know, as from yourselves, that if they are sincerely disposed to Peace, and will deliver up the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and hearken to their Advice in laying down the Hatchet, and abide by such Terms as shall be agreed on, you can venture to assure them, that tho' much Blood has been spilt, and that the <HI>English,</HI> in Resentment of this, are well prepared to avenge themselves, yet they have so great Regard for the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> that it will be in their Power to perswade the <HI>English</HI> not to prosecute the War, but to accept fair, just and honourable Terms; and I provide you with this Belt, to deliver it to them with such a Speech.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I speak my own sincere Inclinations, when I say I am for Peace; and not only my own, but the Sentiments of others, and particularly the earnest Desire of a Number of People, who are the Descendants of those that came over with the first Proprietor; all those are ex∣tremely desirous to interpose with the Government, to receive the Submission of the <HI>Dela∣wares,</HI> and to overlook what is past, and establish for the future a firm and lasting Agree∣ment, Peace and Affection between us, and have repeatedly applied to me for this Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As many Stories have been told to the <HI>Indians</HI> to our Prejudice, I desire you will unde∣ceive them; and particularly I do charge <HI>William Locquies</HI> to acquaint the <HI>Delawares,</HI> that those of their Tribe who live among us, have not had any Mischief done them, but are treated with our usual Kindness, and are at Liberty, and live in Peace and Plenty among us.—I charge you <HI>William Locquies,</HI> to declare the Truth to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to assure <PB N="4" REF="007923_0003_102E0222438AD470"/>them that they have been imposed on; and relate the Care that has been taken, as well by the Government of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> as this, of all the <HI>Indians</HI> who have staid with us, and that they enjoy our Protection, and live as happily as ever.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paxinosa,</HI> and some other <HI>Shawanese,</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> have not broke Faith with us, but endeavoured to dissuade the <HI>Delawares</HI> from striking us.—When they could not succeed, they separated from them, and now live together in some Place near <HI>Wioming</HI>; I would have you go to them, and let them likewise know this Account from Sir <HI>William Johson,</HI> and assure them from me, that if they are inclined to come within the Inhabitants, you have my Orders to conduct them; or if they do not incline to come now, but at any other Time, they will, on sending me a Message, be provided with a safe Conduct, and meet with an hearty Welcome.—Let them know that <HI>Scarroyady</HI> related to me what had pasied between him and them; and that <HI>Aroas</HI> and <HI>David</HI> have likewise made me acquainted with what was said by them when they were last at <HI>Wioming.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then the Governor gave them a String to give to</HI> Paxinosa.</P>
<P>Newcastle, Jagrea, <HI>and</HI> William Locquies, <HI>returned the Governor an Answer,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>That the Messages were very good, and what they approved mightily, and would under∣take the Journey, and deliver them faithfully; but then they must desire the Governor would make their Apology to Colonel <HI>Clapham,</HI> and tell him, that nothing but the Governor's Commands would have induced them to delay their coming to him.</P>
<P>The Governor promised he would; and then told them, that Mr. <HI>Spangenberg</HI> was desired to be present, having some <HI>Delaware Indians</HI> under his Care, that he might hear what was delivered to them.—He desired they would go by Way of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and take with them one or more of the <HI>Indians</HI> there, and that Mr. <HI>Spangenberg</HI> would prepare those <HI>Indians</HI> for their Visit, and perswade some of them to accompany them to <HI>Wioming.</HI></P>
<P>The Messengers returned, and on the 31st of <HI>May,</HI> 1756, made the following Report, <HI>viz. That on their Arrival at</HI> Wioming, <HI>they found the</HI> Indians <HI>had left the Town, and gone up the River; they therefore proceeded to</HI> Teaogon, <HI>where they met with a great Number of</HI> In∣dians, <HI>and informed them they had brought a Message from the Governor of</HI> Pennsylvania, <HI>and desired a Meeting of all their People in that Town and near it; which being obtained in two Days, they then delivered their Message.—After which,</HI> Paxinosa, <HI>as Speaker of their Council, returned the following Answer,</HI> viz.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, The Governor, and People of</HI> Pennsylvania,</P>
<P>THE dark Clouds overspread our Country so suddenly, that we have been all at once se∣parated, and that dark Cloud got in between us; and as it has pleased the most High to dispel it a little, so that we can just see one another again, our Eyes are now running with Tears, because of the melancholy Sight of seeing our Country covered with our own Blood (we mean yours and ours.) Give me Leave to wipe off the Tears from your Eyes, though at the same Time my own Eyes run with Tears in Abundance for what has passed.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you came a great Way, and through dangerous Places, where evil Spirits reign, who might have put several Things in your Way to obstruct your Business, this String serves to clear your Mind, and the Passage from your Heart to your Mouth, that you may speak freely to us.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P>Teedyuscung, <HI>a</HI> Delaware <HI>Chief, spoke next.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas, <HI>and the People of</HI> Pennsylvania,</P>
<P>We rejoice to hear from you, and that you are willing to renew the old good Under∣standing, and that you call to Mind the first Treaties of Friendship made by <HI>Onas,</HI> our great Friend, deceased, with our Fore-Fathers, when himself and his People first came over here. We take hold of these Treaties with both our Hands, and desire you will do the same, that a good Understanding and true Friendship may be re-established. Let us both take hold of these Treaties with all our Strength, we beseech you; we on our Side will certainly do it.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>What you said to us we took to Heart, and it entered into our Heart; and we speak to you from our Heart; and we will deal honestly with you in every Respect.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007923_0004_102E0223EDC3E970"/>
<HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>We desire you will look upon us with Eyes of Mercy. We are a very poor People; our Wives and Children are almost naked. We are void of Understanding, and destitute of the Necessaries of Life. Pity us.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Delawares, Memskies, <HI>and</HI> Mohickons, <HI>to</HI> Onas, <HI>and the People of</HI> Pennsylvania.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>There is a great Number of our People among you, and in a Manner confined; we de∣sire you will set them at Liberty, or rather give them a safe Conduct to <HI>Wioming,</HI> where we intend to settle as on your Fire Side; there we will jointly with you kindle a Council-Fire, which shall always burn, and we will be one People with you.</P>
<P><HI>Gave two Belts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas, <HI>and all the People of</HI> Pennsylvania,</P>
<P>We had the Misfortune that a great and dark Cloud overspread our Country; but by our Prudence, and that of our Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> it is now almost dispelled, and we see the clear Heavens again. We the <HI>Delawares,</HI> the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> the <HI>Mohickons,</HI> and <HI>Memskies,</HI> give you this String Wampum, and desire you, that the Bitterness which might have gather∣ed in this dark and unhappy Time may be removed, and that you may by this Means spit it out; take or accept this as a certain Cure for that Purpose, and pass by all that is past, and think on your poor foolish Brethren with Mercy, and forget all the Evil done to you by them.</P>
<P><HI>Gave several Strings of Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>What our Uncles the <HI>Six Nations</HI> required of us, in your and their Behalf, by their Dele∣gates, at <HI>Otsaningo,</HI> we that live on the River <HI>Sasquehannah</HI> have agreed to. We have laid aside our Hatchet, and will never make use of it any more against you or your Brethren, the <HI>English</HI>: All our young Men have been consulted about this, and all earnestly agree to it, and we now speak in their Presence.</P>
<P>We must give you this Caution, not to charge them with any Thing that may be done by the <HI>Ohio Indians,</HI> who are under the Influence of the <HI>French</HI> against you. We assure you, our young Men will do no more Mischief to your People.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>

<P>I RETURN you the Thanks of this Government for the kind Reception you gave to my Messengers: This I look upon as an Act of Friendship, and a Token of your good Intentions.</P>
<P><HI>A String of four Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to find a good Spirit at last prevailing amongst you, and that you hearkened to my Message, and laid it to Heart; you will ever find us, your Brethren, sincerely disposed to consult and act for your truest Interest, and in the several Matters which were or shall now be particularly promised on our Part, you may rest assured we mean punctually to per∣from them, and expect the same Disposition in you.</P>
<P><HI>A String of four Rows.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007923_0005_102E02258C757BD0"/><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Shawanese, Delawares, Memskies, <HI>and</HI> Mohickons,</P>
<P>As you on your Parts have confirmed the Treaties and Leagues of Amity subsisting between you and this Government, and given a Belt in Confirmation thereof, and desire the same be done on our Part; I do now, by this Belt, ratify and confirm all former Treaties and En∣gagements, and assure, that they shall be most inviolably observed as long as the Sun shines.</P>
<P><HI>Here a large Belt was given.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As Your Confirmation of former Treaties was accompanied with Professions of Sincerity, so I make you the strongest Assurances of Truth in the Confirmation this Government has now made.</P>
<P><HI>A String of four Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>That you and I may have an Opportunity of making these mutual Declarations at a publick Convention, I now kindle a Council-Fire at the House of <HI>Conrad Weiser,</HI> who is one of the Council of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and the publick Interpreter of the Province.</P>
<P><HI>A large Belt of fourteen Rows.</HI></P>
<P>N. B. <HI>Mr.</HI> Weifer <HI>said it was necessary to name a particular Place; but the</HI> Indians <HI>were, not with standing this, always at Liberty to name another; and he believed, from something Captain</HI> Newcastle <HI>had dropped, the</HI> Indians <HI>would chuse the</HI> Forks-of-Delaware.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Having appointed a Place for us to meet in Council, I now clear the Roads to this Place, and remove the Logs and other Obstructions out of it, so that it may be perfectly safe for every one desirous to use it to travel to their Brethren when met in Council.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of eight Rows, and eight Strings tied to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is offensive to see Blood spilt upon the Road used by People who have lived in Friend∣ship together, I therefore remove all Blood out of the Road that leads to the Council-Fire.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Your <HI>Indians</HI> who live among us go where they please; they live as we do; and enjoy their Liberty. We only hinder them from going to the Frontiers, where they might be mistaken for Enemies, and hurt or killed; and that the <HI>Indians</HI> may know the Truth of this, we send some of them along with our Messengers to <HI>Teaogon,</HI> who will declare what Treat∣ment they have had from us. What few we have in Confinement shall be set at Liberty when the Council meets, and be brought there.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This last is a very important Article, and what we absolutely depend upon, That all Pri∣soners taken on both Sides shall be delivered up, as there can be no Sincerity on either Side where this is not done, and that in the most faithful and ample Manner, without keeping back a single Prisoner; this Belt assures you that it shall be punctually performed by us, and we expect the same punctually on your Side.</P>
<P><HI>Two Belts, the one of seven, the other of eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have mentioned to us the Distresses you have been, and are, in, for Want of Necessa∣ries; these are owing to your having given Way to the Influences of an evil Spirit, and struc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us your Brethren without any Cause; and as you have brought it on yourselves, you have the less Reason to complain: But now that a good Spirit begins to shew itself in you, and you desire to meet us in Council, I shall bring with me a Sufficiency of Clothes and Provi∣sions to relieve those Distresses.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As you have laid down the Hatchet, and desire the same may be done by us, our Mes∣senger carries with him our Proclamation for Suspension of Hostilities within the Limits there in specified, of which we have informed the <HI>Six Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Agreeable to the repeated Advice and Request of <HI>Scarroyady,</HI> and other <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> then residing in this Province, I engaged to build a Fort at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> for the Protec∣tion of our Friendly <HI>Indians,</HI> their Wives and Children; and I now acquaint you with the March of the Forces, in order to effect this useful Work, that it may give no Umbrage the Commander having my Orders not to act offensively.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007923_0006_102E022723B19A90"/><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You are to take Notice, that nothing proposed by me is to interfere with any Invitation you may have received from Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> or your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; they have acquainted me, that a great Council is to be held in the Country of the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; and those <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Teaogon</HI> are invited to it: I would have them by all Means give their At∣tendance there. You may go to either Place as you incline, for we are both in the Service of one King, and act by his Direction.</P>

<P>I have now finished what I would have you say in the Name of this Province to the <HI>In∣dians</HI> gathered at <HI>Teaogon.</HI> You will adapt the several Articles to <HI>Indian</HI> Customs, retaining the Spirit and Substance of them.</P>

<P><HI>The Governor acquainted the</HI> Indians <HI>be was going to speak, and desired them to be attentive.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>BY a Belt which I sent by <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the other <HI>Indian</HI> Messengers, to <HI>Diahogo,</HI> I in∣formed the <HI>Indians</HI> there, that I had kindled a Council Fire; by another String I in∣vited them to it; and by a String of Wampum I cleared the Road, that they might come in Safety to us. I assured you of an hearty Welcome as soon as I came here, and of my Protection; and I now, in the Name of this Government, again bid you welcome. As Captain <HI>Newcastle</HI> brought me no Answer to some Part of the Messages I sent last by him, I expect to receive them by you. I hope you come prepared to speak to us freely, sincerely, and openly, and desire you may do so.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> immediately answered.</P>
<P>Last Spring you sent me a String; and as soon as I heard the good Words you sent, I was glad; and as you told us, we believe it came from your Hearts, so we felt it in our Hearts, and received what you said with Joy.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The first Messages you sent me, came in the Spring; they touched my Heart; they gave me Abundance of Joy. I returned an Answer to them, and waited for your second Messages, which came after some Time, and were likewise very agreeable. By the last you acquainted me that you had kindled a Council Fire, and invited me and my People to it. We accepted the Invitation; and I came accordingly, and have staid several Days, smoaking my Pipe with Patience, expecting to meet you here. We are ready to hear what you have to say, and not only we, but five other Nations, in all ten Nations, are now turning their Eyes this Way, and wait what will be said and done at this Meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007923_0007_102E02295C47A790"/><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I solemnly, and with the utmost Sincerity, declare, that tho' you may think I am a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here, yet it will not be long before you will be convinced that I am here by the Appoint∣ment of ten Nations, among which are my Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> authorizing me to treat with you, and what I do they will all confirm. The Truth of this you will soon have made evident to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Hearken to what I am going to say: I declare, in the most solemn Manner, that what I now relate is the Truth. Abundance of Confusion, Disorder and Distraction has arisen among the <HI>Indians,</HI> from People taking upon them to be Kings, and Persons of Authority. In every Tribe of <HI>Indians</HI> there have been such Pretenders, who have held Treaties, some∣times publick, and sometimes in the Bushes; sometimes what these People did came to be known, but frequently it remained in Darkness, or at least no more was imparted to the Publick than they were pleased to publish. To some they held up their Belts, but others never saw them; this bred among the <HI>Indians</HI> great Heart-burnings and Quarrels, and I can assure you, that the present Clouds do, in a great Measure, owe their Rise to this wild and irregular Way of doing Business.—The <HI>Indians,</HI> sensible of this Mistake of our An∣cestors, are now determined to put an End to this Multitude of Kings, and to this dark Way of proceeding; they have agreed to put the Management of their Affairs into the Hands of a very few, and these shall no longer have it in their Power to huddle up and give partial Representations of what is done. I assure you, that there are only two Kings appointed to transact publick Business, of which I am one. For the future, Matters will go better on both Sides; you as well as we will know who we are to deal with. We must beseech the most High to scatter the Clouds which have arisen between us, that we may settle Peace as heretofore.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> English, <HI>and particularly the Governor of</HI> Pennsylvania,</P>
<P>You know you have invited me here; I came therefore; my Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> will confirm what I say. In your Messages to the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Dialago</HI> you signified to us, that you heard we were in Want and Distress, which to be sure we are, and pitied us and our poor Wives and Children. We took it kindly, and as a Word that came from your Heart. Now is the Time for you to look about, and act the Part of a charitable and wise Man.— Be there∣fore strong—be assured that, though I am poor, I will do my Share. Whatever Kindness you do to me, or my People, shall be publicshed to ten <HI>Indian</HI> Nations. We will not hide any Presents you shall give us; every Body shall know that we have heard your good Words. We will not do as others, and some of our Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> have done, sneak away, and hide your Words and Presents in the Bushes, but shall publish far and near, that all may join with us. Exert yourselves now in the best Maner you can, and you will obtain your End.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Conclusion of my Words is no more than this; the Matter in Hand is of too great Moment for one Man. I am but a Messenger from the <HI>United Nations,</HI> though I act as a Chief Man for the <HI>Delawares.</HI> I must now hear what you have to say to my People at this Council-Fire. If it be good, I shall lay hold of it, and carry it to the <HI>United Nations,</HI> who will smile and be pleased to hear good News. If what you will say be disagreeable, I will, notwithstanding, keep it close (<HI>here be closed his Fist</HI>) and deliver it faithfully to the <HI>United Nations,</HI> and let them, as they are my Superiors, do as they see Cause.</P>
<P>Being asked if he had done, he said he had for the present; the main Thing, he added is yet in my Breast, laying his Hand to his Heart, but this will depend on what Words the Governor will speak to us. Then he repeated the <HI>Delaware</HI> Word, <HI>Whish-shicksy,</HI> the same in <HI>Mohock</HI> Language as <HI>Jago,</HI> with great Earnestness, and in a very pathetick Tone. Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> who knew the Word to have a very extensive and forcible Sense, desired the Interpreter t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ask him what he meant by <HI>Whish-shicksy</HI> on this particular Occasion, and explained himself i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the following Manner. Suppose you want to remove a large Log of Wood, that require many Hands, you must take Pains to get as many together as will do the Business; if y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fall short but one, though never so weak an one, all the rest are to no Purpose. Thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this be in itself nothing, yet, if you cannot move the Log without it, you must spare no Pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to get it. <HI>Whish-shicksy</HI>; be strong; look round you; enable us to engage every <HI>Indian</HI> Na∣tion we can; put the Means into our Hands; be sure perform every Promise you have made to us; in particular do not pinch Matters neither with us or other <HI>Indians</HI>; we will help you but we are poor, and you are rich; make us strong, and we will use our Strength for you and, besides this, what you do, do quickly; the Times are dangerous; they will not adm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Delay.—<HI>Whish-shicksy</HI>; do it effectually, and do it with all possible Dispatch.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007923_0008_102E022C9572EBC8"/><HI>The Governor then spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have heard with Attention all you have said. I thank you for the Openness with which you have declared your Sentiments; the Matters mentioned are of Importance; I have laid them to Heart; I will consider them with my Council; when I am prepared to speak, I will let you know; I will use Dispatch, the Times being, as you justly observe, very dangerous.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I AM going to speak to you on the Affair we are met about; my Speech will contain Mat∣ters of great Moment: By this String of Wampum therefore I open your Ears, that you may give a proper Attention.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Province have ever been a peaceable People, and remarkable for their Love and constant Friendship to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and other <HI>Indians</HI> in Alliance with them.</P>
<P>When our Back Inhabitants were attacked last Fall, we at first were at a Loss to know from whence the Blow came; and were much surprized when we were informed that it was given by our old Friends and Neighbours the Cousins of our Brethren the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; we won∣dered at it; and the more so, as we had not, to our Knowledge, given them any just Cause of Offence.—As soon as we knew this, we sent to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and informed them of it, and desired to know, whether this Blow had been struck by their Direction, or with their Pri∣vity or Consent: And on receiving Assurances from them, that it was not done with their Con∣sent, and that they greatly disapproved such Conduct, we made ready to revenge the Injury we had received, and we wanted neither Men or Arms, Ammunition, nor Strength to do it, and to take Vengeance for the Injury done us; yet, when we had the Hatchet in our Hands, and were prepared not only to defend ourselves, but to carry the War into the Country of those who had struck us, we sent again to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> agreeable to the Treaties subsisting between us, to acquaint them of our Intentions. They let us know they had held a Grand Council, at <HI>Fort Johnson,</HI> on this Matter, and that Deputies from thence were sent to summon a Meeting of <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawanese</HI> at <HI>Otsaningo,</HI> who were return∣ed with an Account, That their Nephews had, at their Interposition, laid down the Hatchet, and would strike the <HI>English</HI> no more. The <HI>Six Nations</HI> having received these Assurances from the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawanese,</HI> requested us not to execute our hostile Purposes, but to suspend Hostilities; declaring, that they would fully accommodate this Breach, and bring about a Peace. At this Request of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> we kept our Warriors at Home, for guarding and protecting our Frontiers. I then sent <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and other <HI>Indian</HI> Messengers to you, to notify the Advices of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> with respect to what had been determined at <HI>Otsaningo,</HI> instructing him, in case he found you sincerely disposed for Peace, and inclined to return to your Alliance with us, to assure you, on the Behalf of this Government, that we were willing to it, on just and honourable Terms. <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the other Messengers, re∣turned with your Answers; in which you acknowledged, you had been under the Influence of an Evil Spirit, but were well disposed to return to your old Amity and Friendship; at the same Time letting us know, that you was sorry for what had passed; that you was in Distress, and desired we would pity your Distresses. To shew our Readiness to enter into a Treaty, and our Sincerity in what was said by <HI>Newcastle,</HI> I sent him back again to you, to let you know, on the Behalf of this Government, that I had kindled a Council-Fire, invited all your People to it, cleared the Road, washed off the Blood, and promised, if your People would come to Council, and renew former Leagues, and do what is further necessary on the Occasion, I would bring something with me to relieve your Distresses.—I thought it right to go through this Account in this particular Manner, that you might know from myself what was the Subject of the Messages sent by <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and what was the Substance of the An∣swers I received by him. And now, I suppose (as I do not see the Body of your <HI>Indians</HI> here) your People, in general, did not believe <HI>Newcastle,</HI> but sent you to know if he had my <PB N="10" REF="007923_0009_102FC1B4A6143EC8"/>Authority for the several Matters he delivered to you, and to hear them from my own Mouth. I do not blame you for this Caution, it bespeaks your Care. The Matters he was charged with being of the last Concern, for the Satisfaction of all your People, how wide so∣ever they are dispersed, I do in this publick Assembly, in the Name of the Government, and People of this Province, assure you, that Captain <HI>Newcastle</HI> acted by my Authority; and in Confirmation of what I have said, and that what he delivered, was by Authority from me, I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Being now convinced out of my Mouth, of the Sincerity of my Professions made to you by Captain <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and of the Dispositions of the People of this Province, to renew the antient Friendship that subsisted between <HI>William Penn</HI> and the <HI>Indians.</HI> I desire you will re∣port this to the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Diahogo,</HI> and to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and to all the <HI>Indians</HI> far and near, as my Words, spoken to them in the Name, and on the Behalf of the Government of <HI>Penn∣sylvania.</HI> I invite them all to this Council-Fire; the greater the Number that shall come, the more acceptable it will be to me. I invite, and desire you will bring with you, your whole People; but then you must bring here with you also all the Prisoners you have taken during these Disturbances; I must insist on this, as an Evidence of your Sincerity to make a lasting Peace, for, without it, though Peace may be made from the Teeth outwards, yet while you retain our Flesh and Blood in Slavery, it cannot be expected we can be Friends with you, or that a Peace can come from our Hearts. I repeat this Article of the Prisoners as a necessary Condition of Peace, and desire you will consider it as such: If in this you deal with us sincerely, we shall esteem you sincere in every Thing else, and proceed to re∣new our former Leagues and Covenants, and become again one Flesh as before. And I must remind you (as we are acting in Consort with the <HI>Six Nations</HI>) to bring some of your Uncles along with you, that they may see all that passes, and be Witnesses of the good Effects of their and our Messages to you.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>In Testimony of the Satisfaction you have given all our People by your coming to this Council-Fire, they have put into my Hands a small Present for you and your young Men, which will be given you at any Time you shall think proper. I have likewise given Orders to the Captains of the Forts, on the Frontiers, to furnish you with as much Provisions as you can carry, for the Use of the People you have left behind you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Only a few of you are now come down; this Present of Goods therefore is but small; when the Body of your Nation comes here, which I expect they will, and the Prisoners are delivered up, and a firm Peace made, larger Presents will be given, and your Distresses re∣lieved in a more ample Manner.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Great Works require strong Hands and many; this is a good and a great one, the Work of Peace; it requires strong Heads, and found Hearts; we desire many such may be joined together: I therefore desire your Assistance for <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> in this Matter; having great Influence with many who live far distant from us, you are esteemed, and will be heard; we therefore chuse you as Agent and Counsellor for this Province; engage in it heartily. You ought to do it; you owe it to the Country in which you was born; you owe it to your Brethren the <HI>English</HI>; you owe it to your Uncles the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; you owe it to your own People over which you preside: We desire you will heartily undertake it, and use your ut∣most Endeavours to bring about this great and good Work we have now begun.</P>
<P><HI>A large Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> answered, that he had received the Governor's Words kindly, and would, in a few Words, answer him. Then taking a large Belt in his Hand, he proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>At the very Time <HI>Newcastle</HI> came with your last Messages, I was in Treaty with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and then received this Authority from them. [<HI>Listing up the Belt.</HI>] This Belt de∣notes, that the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> by their Chiefs, have lately renewed their Covenant Chain with us; formerly we were accounted Women, and employed only in Womens Business; but now they have made Men of us, and as such we are now come to this Treaty. Having this Authority as a Man to make Peace, I have it in my Hand, but have not opened it; but will soon declare it to the other Nations. This Belt holds together ten Nations; we are in the Middle, between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI>; look at it. There are but two Chiefs of the ten Nations; they are now looking on, and their Attention is sixed, to see who are disposed <PB N="11" REF="007923_0010_102E02310F94DC70"/>really for Peace.—This Belt further denotes, that whoever will not comply with the Terms of Peace, the ten Nations will join against him and strike him; see the dangerous Circum∣cumstances I am in; strong Men on both Sides; Hatchets on both Sides; whoever does in∣cline to Peace, him will I join.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>This is a good Day; whoever will make Peace, let him lay hold of this Belt, and the Nations around shall see and know it. I desire to conduct myself according to your Words, which I will perform to the utmost of my Power. I wish the same good Spirit that possessed the good old Man <HI>William Penn,</HI> who was a Friend to the <HI>Indians,</HI> may inspire the People of this Province at this Time.</P>
<P><HI>Then delivered the Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor received it, and said, I take hold of the Belt, and am pleased with what has been said; it is all very good.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> then explained the Belt, saying, it was sent him by the <HI>Six Nation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> accepted of it: You see, says he, a Square in the Middle, meaning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>dians,</HI> and at one End the Figure of a Man, indicating the <HI>English</HI>; and at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> another, meaning the <HI>French</HI>; our Uncles told us, that both these coveted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> let us join together to desend our Lands against both, you shall be Partakers with us of our Lands.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and his Son came and dined with the Governor; and after Dinner, some more of the <HI>Indians</HI> coming in, the Governor acquainted <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> that he had something of Importance to communicate to him. The Governor then informed him, That as he was going to Council this Morning, he received a Letter from the Northern Frontiers, with very bad News, that gave him a great deal of Concern: By this Letter he received Advice, that some <HI>Indians</HI> had killed four of our White People at the <HI>Minisinks</HI>; this occasioned our Forces to be upon their Guard, and a Party of them fell in with three <HI>Indians,</HI> and judging them to be Enemy <HI>Indiens,</HI> one of them was killed in endeavouring to make his Escape; and then the Governor entered into the Particulars related in <HI>Van Etten</HI>'s Letter. The Go∣vernor said, he did not know what <HI>Indians</HI> had done this Mischief. If the <HI>Indian</HI> who was killed was our Friend, he was sorry for it; but if our Enemy, he was glad of it.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said, that when he came here to Council, all the <HI>Indians</HI> there abouts knew of it; and therefore he believed it must be the <HI>French Indians</HI> that killed our People; but that if his People were so foolish as to come on our Borders at this Time, and were killed any how, they must take the Reward of their Folly. None of these private Deaths ought to affect a publick Measure; nor would this make any Alterations in his Councils.</P>

<P><HI>The Goods were brought, and placed on the Council Table, and were delivered to the</HI> Indians, <HI>the Governor speaking as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I ACQUAINTED you Yesterday, that the People of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> had put into my Hands a small Present to relieve you, and your Wives and Children, from their present Di∣stresses. I think it further necessary to inform you, That a Part of this Present was given by the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> (who are the Descendants of those who first came over to this Country with your old Friend <HI>William Penn</HI>) as a particular Testimony of their Regard and Affection for the <HI>Indians,</HI> and their earnest Desire to promote the good Work of Peace in which we are now engaged.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="007923_0011_102E0232A85A23A0"/>Brethren,</P>
<P>This is not only their Sentiments but my own, and those of the People of this Province; who will all rejoice to see this good Work of Peace perfected; and therefore, as you have now received from us this substantial Proof of our Disposition to relieve your Distresses, you will be the better enabled to encourage others to return to their former Friendship with us. I say, Brother, by this we give you a clear Testimony of our Readiness and good Dispositions for Peace. Shew you the same Readiness, and comply with the Terms I have proposed to you.</P>
<P>A String.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> returned Thanks; and repeated his Assurances of doing all in his Power to perfect a general Peace with the <HI>Indians.</HI>—From the Council, the Governor proceeded to an Entertainment that was provided for the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Officers, and all the Company then i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Town, accompanying him.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> whilst at Dinner, was so well pleased with his kind Reception and generous Entertainment, that he declared, in the warmest Manner, no Endeavours of his should be wanting to bring over to the Peace, all the <HI>Indians</HI> far and near, that he could speak or send to; and repeatedly desired the Governor would publish what was done, through his and the neighbouring Provinces, and he would do the same at Home.—The <HI>Philadelphia Quakers</HI> going after Dinner to take their Leave of him, he parted with them in a very affectionate Manner; but the other Part of the Company staying, he entered into a free Conversation with the Governor; wherein he related many entertaining Particulars respecting his Journey to <HI>Niagara,</HI> and afterwards made a Council Speech with a String of Wampum, saying:</P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>You are so good, and received us so kindly, I will also give you some of that good To∣bacco that the <HI>Six Nations</HI> have put into my Pipe; you shall smoak of it yourselves; you will find it is good, and I will give of the same Tobacco wherever I go (meaning the Message from the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to them, to be at Peace with the <HI>English</HI>) The same Thing that I have offered to you I will offer to all the <HI>Indians,</HI> and at the same time tell them, that you have smoaked of this Tobacco; but to do this requires me to be rich, and yet I am poor.— It will take up a long Time, as there are many Nations to send the Pipe to; but in two Months I hope to go my Rounds, and be here again with a large Number, of different Na∣tions; I say it may be in two Months, but it may be longer, as the People live at a great Distance from one another. I assure you I will execute every Thing you have desired of me, and let the <HI>Six Nations</HI> know all that has passed between us; and that I am your Agent and Counsellor in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>A String.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>I would not have you mistake me, as if I meant that I could prevail on the <HI>Ohio Indians</HI>: I cannot tell that they will leave off doing Mischief.—I hope you will strengthen yourselves against them; pray make yourselves as strong as possible on that Side. I must warn you likewise of another Thing; perhaps on the East Side of <HI>Sasquehannah</HI> there may be Mischief done by <HI>Indians</HI> in my Absence; but be assured it will not be by any of my People; it will be by the <HI>French Indians</HI> from <HI>Ohio,</HI> who can easily pass over <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> and do what Mischief they please: Against these, you must be sure to arm yourselves in the best Manner you can; remember I give you this Warning.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>WEISER</HI> was ask'd, Whether it was intended the Governor should keep the Belt <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> gave, or return it? Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> answered, That having some Doubts about it, he put the same Question to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> who said the Belt was sent by the <HI>Six Na∣tions</HI> <PB N="13" REF="007923_0012_102E023444631BA0"/>to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and as it was given by them to the Governor, it ought to be preserved among the Council Wampum, being a Belt of great Consequence; and it would be well to return another of a Fathom long, and at the Delivery of it, which must be in Council To∣morrow, to make a proper Address to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that he would be diligent, and carry it to all the Nations within his Influence. <HI>Newcastle</HI> said further, That <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> would want Abundance of Wampum, and if he had it not, the Cause would suffer exceedingly. He hoped the Council Bag was full, and desired it might be emptied into the Lap of <HI>Teedyuscung.</HI> Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> concurring in Opinion, and saying, that the <HI>French</HI> gave great Quantities of Wampum to their <HI>Indians,</HI> and on Matters of Consequence their Belts were several Fathom long, and very wide, the Secretary was ordered to bring what Wampum he had into Coun∣cil, <HI>viz.</HI> Fifteen Strings, and seven Belts, a Parcel of new black Wampum, amounting to seven Thousand; and having no new white Wampum, nor any proper Belts to give in Re∣turn for <HI>Teedyuscung</HI>'s Peace Belt, a Messenger was sent to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and he returned with five Thousand; upon which the <HI>Indian</HI> Women were employed to make a Belt of a Fathom long, and sixteen Beads wide; in the Center of which was to be the Figure of a Man, mean∣ing the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and on each Side five other Figures, meaning the ten Na∣tions mentioned by <HI>Teedyuscung.</HI></P>
<P>The King, who was very irregular in his Visits, as well as in his Discourses, bolted all of a sudden into the Room, and with a high Tone of Voice spoke as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Brother,</P>
<P>I desire all that I have said, and you have said to one another, may be taken down aright; some speak in the Dark; do not let us do so; let all be clear and known. What is the Rea∣son the Governor holds Councils so close in his Hands, and by Candle Light? The <HI>Five Na∣tions</HI> used to make him sit out of Doors like a Woman.—If the <HI>Five Nations</HI> still make him a Woman, they must; but what is the Reason the Governor makes him a Woman, meaning, Why does he confer with <HI>Indians</HI> without sending for him, to be present and hear what was said?</P>
<P>The Governor answered, That he holds Councils on a Hill; has no Secrets; never sits in Swamps, but speaks his Mind openly to the World; what happens here he has a Right to hear: The Women were sent for to make a Belt, not to Council. The <HI>Six Nations</HI> may be wrong, they are not under his Direction; and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not answerable for their Con∣duct, if they have not treated the <HI>Delawares</HI> as Men.</P>
<P>The Chief thanked the Governor, seemed well pleased, and said, To-morrow he would speak more, and what he had to say was from the <HI>Six Nations:</HI>—He that won't make Peace must die.</P>
<P>A String.</P>
<P>It was agreed in the Morning the Governor should deliver the new Belt, then in making, to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> with a proper Speech; that by two Belts tied together, <HI>Newcastle</HI> and <HI>Teedyus∣cung</HI> should be made joint Agents for this Government, and they be desired to consult to∣gether, to love one another, and to act for the best; that the new black Wampum, and all the Belts and Strings, should be given to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and a private Present made to him and his Interpreter, <HI>Ben.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The Names of the <HI>Indians</HI> Present at the Treaty were taken down by Mr. <HI>Edmonds,</HI> and ordered to be entered.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> having enquired of <HI>Newcastle</HI> what Messages had been received by the <HI>Delawares,</HI> at <HI>Diahogo,</HI> from the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> received the following Information, which he took down in Words that are the literal Interpretation of what <HI>Newcastle</HI> said, <HI>viz.</HI> "The large Belt, given by <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> was sent to the <HI>Delawares</HI> by the Council of the <HI>Six United Nations,</HI> with a Message to the following Purport.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cousins, the</HI> Delaware Indians,</P>
<P>YOU will remember that you are our Women; our Fore-Fathers made you so, and put a Petticoat on you, and charged you to be true to us, and lie with no other Man but of late you have suffered the String that tied your Petticoat to be cut loose by the <HI>French,</HI> and you lay with them, and so became a common Bawd, in which you acted very wrong and deserve Chastisement; but notwithstanding this, we have still an Esteem for you, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you have thrown off the Cover of your Modesty, and become stark naked, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Shame for a Woman, you must be made a Man; and we now give you a little Power, but it will be some Time till you shall be a complete Man; we advise you not to act as a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet, but be first instructed by us, and do as we bid you, and you will become a noted Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>Cousins,</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> fight for our Lands; let us be strong, and lay our Hands to it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and defend it; in the mean time turn your Eyes and Ears to us, and the <HI>English,</HI> our Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thren, and you will live as well as we do.</P>
<P>Then the Governor sent to <HI>Newcastle</HI> and <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> the new Belt; not being finished, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> explained the proposed Figure to them, and desired the Women might finish it on rainy Days<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or resting on their Journey, which was promised.</P>
<P>Then the Governor spoke as follows:</P>

<P>I set an high Value upon this Belt; it is the Peace Belt which <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> delivered in Coun∣cil; I very chearfully lay hold of it; I will lay it up with the Council Belts, and declare to you, I am most heartily disposed to effect the Meaning of this Belt, a speedy and honourable Peace, and a Return of the Offices of Love and Friendship between the <HI>Indians</HI> and thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brethren the <HI>English.</HI>—In Return, I give you the Belt now making, which you will conside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as finished; and when done, shew it every where, and make our Dispositions and the Treat∣ment you have met with known to your own People, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and all your Allies.— [<HI>Here the Governor gave the new Belt, so far as it was made, and all the Wampum prepared for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, desiring, if it was not enough to complete it, that they would add more.</HI>] Then taking up th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Belts, joined together, in his Hands, and addressing <HI>Newcastle</HI> and <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> delared them Agents for the Province, and gave them Authority to do the publick Busines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> together. He recommended to them a mutual Confidence, Esteem and Intimacy, and wish∣ed them Success in their Negotiations.</P>
<P>To which they answered, That they would be mutual good Friends, and lay their Head<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> together, and do every Thing in their Power to promote the weighty Matters entrusted to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> added, If his Memory should not serve him in every Thing committed to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Charge, or Things should be crooked, he would return to us, and make them straight. What he says comes from his Heart, and not from his Lips; his Heart and ours should be one, and be true to one another; for if different Liquors are put in a Calk, and thaked, they will mix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and come out one.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007923_0014_102E02381B4AA608"/>The Governor said, that he had written down what <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said on the Belt deli∣vered by him, and will keep it in his Heart. It is very agreeable to him and the People of <HI>Penn∣sylvania.</HI> He will lay up the Belt in the Council-chamber as a Mark of his Friendship. As he is appointed Agent for <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> with Captain <HI>Newcastle,</HI> he puts into his Hands all the Belts and Wampum he has here, to be made use of by him in the Course of his Nego∣tiations, as he may judge most proper, and most for the Interest of the People of this Pro∣vince.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> answered, That he might meet with Difficulties in transacting the important Business committed to his Charge; but as he is now one of the Council of the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> he assures his Brethren, that he will exert himself faithfully, and to the utmost of his Abilities, in the Service; and if he meets with crooked Paths, he will endeavour to make them straight.</P>
<P>The Governor thanked <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and <HI>Newcastle</HI> for their undertaking to be Agents for <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> on this Occasion, desired that they might unite and co-operate one with ano∣ther, and consult together on the proper Measures to be entered into by them, and delivered them two Belts tied together, as a Sign or Symbol of that Harmony and Unanimity that ought to subsist between them.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said, That he was pleased with being joined with <HI>Newcastle</HI> in the publick Busi∣ness; that he hoped Matters would be brought to a happy Issue; that he wished there might be a firm Friendship and lasting Union between the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> the other <HI>Five Nations,</HI> and the People of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and that they might be as one Man. He further said, that he had a large Family, and having a great Way to go, he had no Means of carrying any more Provisions than would serve him on the Road; he therefore desired that he might be furnish∣ed with a Horse, that he might be enabled to carry Necessaries for his Family.—Whereupon the Governor promised to let him have a Horse, and he promised to return him again the next Time he came down.</P>
<P>The Governor then taking into his Hands all the Belts, Strings, and Bundles of new black Wampum, gave them to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and desired he would use them to the best Advantage among the Nations he should apply to.</P>
<P>The private Presents were then given, and the Governor and Council took their Leave, the Council returning to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and the Governor going to <HI>New-York,</HI> on an Express received from General <HI>Shirley.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference at Easton.</NOTE>ON <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning the Governor, whilst at <HI>Samuel Dean</HI>'s, received Intelligence from Mr. <HI>Horsfield,</HI> that a Party of <HI>Indians,</HI> who came with <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> from <HI>Diahogo,</HI> staid'd behind at a little Distance from Fort <HI>Allen,</HI> and had some bad Designs in doing so; where∣upon the <HI>Moravian</HI> Brother who brought the Intelligence, was immediately dispatched to <HI>Easton,</HI> and the next Morning the Governor received a Letter from Colonel <HI>Weiser,</HI> inform∣ing him, that the Matter communicated to him by Mr. <HI>Horsfield,</HI> had been examined into along with <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> and was without Foundation; on which the Governor proceeded on his Journey, and came to Town in the Afternoon, and as soon as he alighted, the <HI>Dela∣ware</HI> King, and two of the <HI>Six Nation Indians,</HI> came to wait on him, by whom he was told, that Colonel <HI>Weiser,</HI> and two other of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> were gone to meet him, but had taken a different Road.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> and the two <HI>Indians</HI> came afterwards, and expressed their Concern at missing the Governor.</P>
<P>This Morning the Governor sent Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> with his Compliments to the <HI>Indian</HI> Chief, and desired to know whether he intended to speak first, and when; and the King saying it was his Duty to speak first, withed it might be this Forenoon; on which the Governor ap∣pointed Eleven a Clock; at which Time the Governor marched from his Lodging to the Place of Conference, guarded by a Party of the <HI>Royal Americans</HI> in the Front, and on the Flanks, and a Detachment of Colonel <HI>Weiser</HI>'s Provincials, in Sub-divisions, in the Rear, with Colours flying, Drums beating, and Musick playing; which Order was always ob∣served in going to the Place of Conference.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> opened the Conferences with the following Speech.</P>
<P>Brother the Governor,</P>
<P>May it please your Excellency to hear a few Words; I will put the Governor and Gen∣tlemen in mind, that Conferences were held here in the Summer, and what passed there is well known.</P>
<P>I have taken all the Pains possible to execute what I then undertook, and have brought with me several of different Tribes, as well <HI>Delawares</HI> as <HI>Six Nation Indians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="007923_0016_102E023D5B434750"/>I held up the Encouragements I received from the <HI>English,</HI> and spread them far and near to all the Tribes I promised to go to, as well among the <HI>Delawares</HI> as <HI>Six Nations</HI>; and I as∣sure you, I have been true and faithful to my Promises, and used all the Diligence in my Power; in Testimony whereof I give these</P>
<P><HI>Four Strings.</HI></P>
<P>In Confirmation that I have faithfully published what was committed to my Care, several <HI>Indians</HI> of different Places, as well <HI>Six Nation Indians</HI> as <HI>Delawares,</HI> are come along with me, and being now present, will put their Hands and Seals to the Truth of what I say; they have acted upon what I delivered in Behalf of this Government, and their Minds are intent on the good Work that is going on; some of them were here before.</P>
<P>In Conformity to an antient and good Custom established among our Ancestors, I now proceed to open your Eyes and Ears, and remove all Obstructions out of your Throats, that nothing may impede the Attention necessary to be used in a Matter of such Importance as is now going on.</P>
<P>Some bad Reports have lately been spread, which deserve to be no more minded than the Whistling of Birds; these I would remove by this Belt, and take away all bad Impressions that may have been made by them.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eight Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have done for the present, and another Time, if God spares Life, I will begin the main Matter I came to do.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor replied.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I return you Thanks for your kind Speech, and likewise for the Regard you shewed me in sending two of the <HI>Six Nation Indians</HI> along with Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> to meet me. I unfortunately took a different Road, and so we missed of one another; but it gave me great Satisfaction to hear by Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> that he and those <HI>Indians</HI> were desirous to meet me, and conduct me to Town.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Many idle Reports are spread by foolish and busy People; I agree with you, that on both Sides they ought to be no more regarded than the Chirping of Birds in the Woods.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt I open your Eyes and Ears, and particularly the Passage from your Heart to your Mouth, that in what you have to say to this Government they may both concur, nor the Mouth utter any Thing but what is first conceived in the Heart: And I promise you Openness and Sincerity in every Thing I shall speak.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor said, he would be ready to hear what <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> had further to say at Eleven o'Clock To-morrow Morning.</P>

<P>The Governor ordered the Interpreter to acquaint <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> that he was ready to bear him, and be delivered himself as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>THIS is to notify to you, that at the Treaty held here in the Summer, I promised to publish what was then delivered to me to all the Nations I could have any Influence on; and that I have performed all I promised, and done my Duty faithfully, with Respect to all these <PB N="18" REF="007923_0017_102E023F93CB8910"/>Nations, I can evidence by some of them who are come with me, and are now here, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Pleasure, ready to hear what you have to say to us, and disposed to do every Thing in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Power, in Confirmation of what has been, or will be, transacted.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This Belt signifies that I took Notice of, and paid a due Regard to, every Thing sent by the Messengers you sent to me at <HI>Diahogo,</HI> whom I received kindly. You may in particular<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remember, that you took hold of my Hand, and thereupon I came to this Place, where the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Council-Fire was appointed to be kindled: When I came here, I found every Thing said by your Messengers true; which, on my Return, I made known, as well as every Thing else that was then delivered to me, to ten different Nations, <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Six Nations</HI>; and as many of them as I have prevailed upon to come with me, can evidence the Truth of this.</P>
<P>We are all put in mind of the ancient Leagues and Covenants made by our Fore-Fathers, and of the former Union and mutual kind Actions of our and their Ancestors; what was pro∣posed here renewed the Remembrance of these former happy Times.</P>
<P>Though we are but Children in Comparison of them, and of little Ability, as you well know, yet we have picked up a few Chips, and will add them to the Fire, and hope it will grow a great Fire, and blaze high, and be seen by all the different <HI>Indian Nations,</HI> Spectators of what we are now doing.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of ten Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I remember what has passed in Discourse and Conversation among our old antient Peo∣ple, especially about Governor <HI>Penn</HI>; what he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the <HI>Indians</HI> is fresh in our Minds and Memory, and I believe it is in yours. The <HI>Indians</HI> and Governor <HI>Penn</HI> agreed well to∣gether; this we all remember, and it was not a small Matter that would then have separated us: And now, as you fill the same Station he did in this Province, it is in your Power to act the same Part.</P>
<P>I am now before you just what you see me; I represent myself only to be a Boy; I am really no more. Now as Misfortunes have happened by the bad Spirit, by our Enemy, and by some of our foolish young People, I declare unto you the Truth, that I have ever been sorry to see it thus, and, as far as I know myself, if it costs me my Life, I would make it otherwise.—As I have already proceeded a great Way, and prevailed on those who have stept out of the Way, and on many of whom I had little or no Expectation, to enter into peaceable Measures, I now call upon you to use your Ability, which is much greater than ours, to assist this good Work, to encourage it, and to confirm it to good Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of seven Rows.</HI></P>
<P>Taking the Belt up again, he added, What you have said I have truly imparted to all, and what you shall now say I shall likewise hold up; I shall not put it into my Bosom, but de∣clare it, and distribute it to all, that it may have a good Effect.</P>

<P><HI>CONRAD WEISER,</HI> from <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> acquainted the Governor, That last Night an <HI>Indian,</HI> named <HI>Zacc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eus,</HI> brought an Account from <HI>Fort Allen,</HI> that about For∣ty <HI>Indian</HI> Warriors were come to <HI>Nishamekatchton,</HI> a Creek about three Miles beyond that Fort, from <HI>Diabogo,</HI> where they were informed by some <HI>Indians,</HI> who first set out with <HI>Teedy∣uscung</HI> to accompany him to the Treaty at <HI>Easton,</HI> that he and all his Company were cut off, and they were come to revenge his Death, in case they should have found it true; but hear∣ing <HI>Teedyuseung</HI> was safe, and kindly received by the <HI>English,</HI> they were glad, and would re∣main there. <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> being asked by Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> if it would not be proper to send an In∣vitation to them to come to the Treaty, he said it would, and desired the Governor might <PB N="19" REF="007923_0018_102E02412B6CDA10"/>join with him in it; which being approved by the Governor, <HI>Moses Tattamy,</HI> and Lieute∣nant <HI>Holler,</HI> were dispatched with the Message.</P>
<P>The Minutes of Yesterday's Conference were read, and the Answer considered and agreed to, but referred till the Return of the Messengers from the <HI>Indians</HI> beyond <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt Allen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> was ordered to inform the <HI>Indians</HI> by <HI>Moses Tattamy,</HI> that Parties of the Ene∣my <HI>Indians</HI> had lately committed Murders on the Borders of this County, even since <HI>Teedy∣useung</HI>'s coming amongst us, but were retreated, and that the Inhabitants were determined to pursue the Murderers, and to desire the <HI>Indians</HI> not to straggle, but keep together, left they should be mistaken for Enemy <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>At a Meeting of the Governor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Commissioners, it was mentioned, that the <HI>Indians</HI> had surmized as if Injustice had been done them in Land Affairs, the Governor therefore added to his Answer a Paragraph, putting the Question in plain Terms.</P>

<P>The Messenger being asked if those <HI>Indians</HI> had impowered <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> to transact Business for them at the Treaty, he answered, that they said, in express Terms, they had given him their Authority, and if any Good should be done (meaning if a firm Peace should be con∣cluded) not only they, but all the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Diabogo,</HI> and many more different Tribes, or Towns, would be exceedingly pleased with it, and would confirm it.</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I AM going to give you an Answer to what was said by you at our last Meeting, and would have done it sooner, if I had not expected to have seen more of our <HI>Indian</HI> Bre∣thren here; I shall use the utmost Sincerity on my Part, and desire you will hearken at∣tentively.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I observe what you have said, in regard to your faithful Performance of all the Matters given you in Charge by this Government when you were last here, and do heartily thank you for the diligent Care you have taken to make known to all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations our good Dis∣positions for Peace, and for inviting them to come to this Council-Fire, and for the further Assurances you make in Behalf of those present, and of many more who are absent, even some of whom you had little Expectations of, that all will be done in their and your Dower to bring the same to a happy Issue.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have done well to consider the antient Leagues subsisiting between you and this Go∣vernment from its very first Beginning. I am pleased to hear you express yourself so affec∣tionately in Favour of the first Proprietor; he very well deserves it at the Hands of all the <HI>Indians</HI>; he was always just and kind to them, and he gave it in Charge to his Governors, and to his Children the present Proprietaries, to treat them, as he did, with the utmost Affection, and to do them all Manner of good Offices, which has always been done by them, as far as is come to my Knowledge.</P>
<P>As to myself, after the present Proprietaries had appointed me to this Government, they re∣commended the Care of the <HI>Indians</HI> to me in a very particular Manner; and I assure you, I shall be ready on all Occasions to do the <HI>Indians</HI> every Service in my Power, and most hear∣tily assist in bringing about a lasting and durable Peace.—I throw a large Log into the Coun∣cil-Fire, that it may blaze up to the Heavens, and spread the Blessings of Peace far and wide; this Belt confirms my Words.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung,</P>
<P>What I am now going to say to you should have been mentioned some Time ago: I now desire your strict Attention to it.</P>
<P>You was pleased to tell me the other Day, that the League of Friendship made by your Fore-fathers was as yet fresh in your Memory; you said that it was made so strong that a small Thing would not easily break it. As we are now met together, at a Council-Fire, kindled by us both, and have promised on both Sides to be free and open to one another, I must ask you, how that League of Friendship came to be broken? Have we, the Governor or People of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> done you any Kind of Injury? If you think we have, you should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and tell us your Hearts: You should have made Complaints before you struck us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so it was agreed, in our antient League: However, now the great Spirit has thus happily brought us once more together, speak your Mind plainly on this Head, and tell us if you have any just Cause of Complaint, what it is; that I may obtain a full Answer to this Point, I give this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> thanked the Governor, and desired Time to consider till To-morrow, and he would give an Answer at such Time as the Governor would be pleased to appoint.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="007923_0020_102E02476ECCFCD0" MS="y"/>The Governor desired he would take full Time to consider it, as it was a Matter of Con∣sequence, and let him know when he was ready; and desired at the same Time he would offer what he had further to say on any other Matter.</P>

<P>Teedyuseung <HI>spoke as follows, laying before him the several Strings and Belts given him Yester∣day by the Governor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I REMEMBER Yesterday by these Strings that you would have had a Conference sooner, had you not expected that the <HI>Indians</HI> who were invited would have come to this Coun∣cil.—I thank you for the kind Things you have spoke, and for reminding me of what pas∣sed in former Times; I will endeavour to tell you the Truth from the Bottom of my Heart, and hope you will have Patience to hear me; all I shall deliver shall be according to the Authority I have received, as those who are now with me will witness.</P>
<P><HI>Gave three Strings of black and white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Times are not now as they were in the Days of our Grandfathers; then it was Peace, but now War and Distress; I am sorry for what has happened, and I now take and wipe the Tears from your Eyes, as there is great Reason for Mourning. This I not only do on my own Part, but on the Part of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> who will put their Seal to it.—I take away the Blood from your Bodies, with which they are sprinkled: I clear the Ground, and the Leaves, that you may fit down with Quietness: I clear your Eyes, that when you see the Day-light you may enjoy it.—I declare this not only for the <HI>Indians</HI> I represent, but for the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> who, with them, make up Ten in all, which have with us put their Hands to these Words.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Now I have done wiping your Eyes and Bodies, and cleaning the Ground where you fit; I will also heal your Wounds, not only at the Top, but at the Bottom; I will apply to them the good Plaister which the Great Creator has made for these Purposes. I say I will heal the Wound, so as it may never break out more, but be compleatly cured; in this the <HI>Six Nations</HI> also join with me.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eight of Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Now as I have healed the Wound, our Case is like that of two Brothers; when one has been sick, and has recovered his Health, it is usual for the other to be glad; just so it is with me now: Your Wound is cured;—I am glad to see you Face to Face, as it has pleased the good Spirit to bring us together. I also remember every thing you have said; and as to what I have said, or still have to say, the other Nations will confirm.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of eleven Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am now going to tell you something in a few Words, in Answer to your Request last Night, that I should give you a true Account how I came to strike you.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of the Confusion and War that happened the Fall before this, I lived in the Middle of the Road leading from the <HI>Six Nations</HI> to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where I was ordered, by my Uncles to sit down; and there I sat in profound Peace, under no Apprehension of Danger; and when I looked towards <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I saw my Brother the Governor, and no∣thing but Peace and Friendship; and when I looked the other Way towards my Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> every thing was also Peace there; so it was with me until all at once a Man, whose Name is called <HI>Charles Broadhead,</HI> an Inhabitant of this Province, came to me at <HI>Wioming,</HI> and told me, as if he had such a Message from the Governor, that I had struck my Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> which I denied over and over; and when I could not prevail with <PB N="22" REF="007923_0021_102E0249153179E0" MS="y"/>him to believe me, I took two Handfuls of Wampum, and desired him to go down with them to the Governor, and assure him that it was not I who struck the <HI>English.</HI> I also de∣sired the Governor to let me know what further Measures I should take, to satisfy him and my Brethren the <HI>English</HI> of the Truth of this.—I also desired, by the same Messenger, that the Governor would take all the prudent Methods he could to relate this to Colonel <HI>Johnson</HI> and to my Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> as I was under a good deal of Concern that this Charge was laid against me.—There were two Kings present besides me, who joined with me in the Message; and I likewise desired the Governor to send me Word what to do, for which I waited till I was out of Patience, and obliged to flee, and leave my Inheritance on that Account.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>According to your other Question or Request last Night, to know of me why I struck you without first giving you a Reason for it; I will tell you the Truth why I have unfortunately struck you. I say, Brother, I will tell you the very Truth, in Answer to your Question. I never knew any of our ancient Kings ever to have this in their Minds, I now tell you that it came from a great King, at least I think so: The King of <HI>England,</HI> and of <HI>France,</HI> have settled or wrought this Land, so as to coop us up as if in a Pen. Our foolish and ignorant young Men, when they saw the Proceeding of this Enemy, and the Things that were told them, believed them, and were perswaded by this false-hearted King to strike our Brethren the <HI>English.</HI>—According to your Desire I will now tell you the Truth with an honest Heart, as far as is in my Power: After this unfortunate Management once prevailed, it is easy for all you <HI>English,</HI> if you look into your Hearts, to find the Cause why this Blow came harden upon you than it would have otherwise done—but this is not the principal Cause; some Things, that have passed in former Times, both in this and other Governments were not well pleasing to the <HI>Indians</HI>; indeed they thought them wrong; but as I said before, they were not the principal Cause. Being asked in what other Governments, he answered, in the Province of <HI>New-Jersey.</HI> Now, Brother, I have told you the Truth, as you desired me, and also the Uneasiness of my Mind, because I verily believe it was our Duty to go to the very Bottom, be it as bad as it will, and that it is necessary we should both open our whole Minds to one ano∣ther, that we may agree to heal the Wound.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a Belt of twelve Rows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>When I was here at the last Treaty, I did according to what I promised. I took the Belt I received from this Government, and held it up to all the Nations I undertook to go to, and I took them all by the Hand (meaning, I invited them all to come to the Council-Fire.) One of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Nations, meaning the <HI>Minisink Indians,</HI> now about <HI>Fort Ailon,</HI> gave me this Belt, saying, he was glad to hear what I said, and laid hold of the same Hand, meaning he accepted the Invitation; but said he would only go Part of the Way, no further than to a certain Place, and there he would stay, but that I might proceed, for he would agree to whatever I did, being led by the same Hand, and giving me Authority to act for him, at this Council.</P>
<P>Then delivered the Belt, of ten Rows, given him by those <HI>Indians,</HI> who be said were <HI>Minisinks</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>By this String I also let you know, that I would not have you think I have finished every Thing at this Meeting, though what I have now done is of great Moment; if we are spared till another Day, that is, until next Spring, I will let you know something further in anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Meeting, for you must be sensible we cannot at one Time finish a Thing of so great M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ment. In the mean time, I will use my faithful Endeavours to accomplish every Thing to the Good of both of us.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P>Then, pausing a while, he said he had forgot something, and taking up the String again, he proceeded.</P>
<P>I will let you know fully and freely my Mind, and what is my Determination to do.— When I return into my Country, I will look about me, I will see and hear for you.—If I hear of any Enemy, going towards you, I will send a suitable Messenger to give you Notice though it thould be at Midnight. I will also take every prudent Measure to prevent any Dan∣ger that may befal you; perhaps, if the Enemy be but few, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay not come to know of it but if the Number be great, I shall be the liklier to know it: However, be they more o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> less, I will let you know it.</P>
<P><HI>Then laid down the String again.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="007923_0022_102E024AAD353248" MS="y"/>Then the Governor desired of <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> as he had mentioned Grievances received by the <HI>Indians</HI> from this and other Governments, to let him know what they were, and to speak his Mind freely and fully without any reserve; upon which <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> spoke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have not so much Knowledge of Things done in this Country as others who have lived longer in it, being but lately come among us.—I have not far to go for an Instance: This very Ground that is under me (striking it with his Foot) was my Land and Inheritance, and is taken from me by Fraud; when I say this Ground, I mean all the Land lying between <HI>Tohiccon Creek</HI> and <HI>Wioming,</HI> on the River <HI>Sasquehannah.</HI> I have not only been served so in this Government, but the same Thing has been done to me as to several Tracts in <HI>New-Jer∣sey,</HI> over the River. When I have sold Lands fairly, I look upon them to be really sold.— A Bargain is a Bargain.—Though I have sometimes had nothing for the Lands I have sold but broken Pipes, or such Trifles, yet when I have sold them, though for such Trifles, I look upon the Bargain to be good: Yet I think I should not be ill used on this Account by those very People who have had such an Advantage in their Purchases, nor be called a Fool for it. <HI>Indians</HI> are not such Fools as to bear this in their Minds.—The Proprietaries, who have pur∣chased their Lands from us cheap, have sold them too dear to poor People, and the <HI>Indians</HI> have suffered for it. It would have been more prudent in the Proprietaries, to have sold the Lands cheaper, and have given it in Charge to those who bought from them, to use the <HI>In∣dians</HI> with Kindness on that Account.</P>
<P>Now, Brother, hear me; supposing you had a Pipe in your Mouth, smoaking, of little Value; I come and take it from you; by and by, when you see me again, you remember it, and take a Revenge: I had forgot, and wonder at the Cause, and ask you, Brother, Why you have done so? This makes me remember the Injury I did you, and more careful for the future. Now, although you have purchased our Lands from our Fore-fathers on so reasonable Terms, yet now at length you will not allow us to cut a little Wood to make a Fire; nay, hinder us from Hunting, the only Means left us of getting our Livelihood.</P>
<P>Now, Brother, I am pleased you asked me this Question, having thereby given me an Op∣portunity of speaking my Mind freely as to any Uneasiness I was under.—You are wise enough to see these Things, and to provide a Remedy for them.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> produced a Receipt, from <HI>William Parsons,</HI> for a Bundle of Deer-skins he had sent from <HI>Fort Allen</HI> as a Present to Governor <HI>Morris,</HI> and desired Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> to let him know if he had received them for the Governor; which he said he had.</P>
<P>He then asked Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> what was done with the Memorandum he gave to Governor <HI>Morris</HI> when he was in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> 1755, containing a Claim to a small Pine Tract in <HI>New-Jersey</HI>; to which Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> said, that Governor <HI>Morris</HI> had promised to enquire into the Matter, and the Memorandum would be returned to him at any Time, with Governor <HI>Morris</HI>'s Report on it.</P>
<P>The Governor then asked him, what he meant by Fraud; having said his Lands were taken from him by Fraud, what it meant?</P>
<P>To which <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> replied.—When one Man had formerly Liberty to purchase Lands, and he took the Deed from the <HI>Indians</HI> for it, and then dies; after his Death the Children forge a Deed like the true One, with the same <HI>Indian</HI> Names to it, and thereby take Lands from the <HI>Indians</HI> which they never sold—this is Fraud. Also, when one King has Land be∣yond the River, and another King has Land on this Side, both bounded by Rivers, Moun∣tains and Springs, which cannot be moved, and the Proprietaries, greedy to purchase Lands, buy of one King what belongs to the other—this likewise is Fraud.</P>
<P>The Governor then asked <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> Whether he had ever been used in that Manner?</P>
<P>He answered, Yes;—I have been served so in this Province: All the Land extending from <HI>Tohiccon,</HI> over the <HI>Great-Mountain,</HI> to <HI>Wioming,</HI> has been taken from me by Fraud; for when I had agreed to sell the Land to the old Proprietary, by the Course of the River, the young Proprietaries came and got it run by a straight Course by the Compass, and by that Means took in double the Quantity intended to be sold.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As you have desired me to be very particular, I have told you the Truth, and have opened my Mind fully. I did not intend to speak thus, but I have done it at this Time, at your Re∣quest; <PB N="24" REF="007923_0023_102E024CEA989A20" MS="y"/>not that I desire you should now purchase these Lands, but that you should look in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your own Hearts, and consider what is right, and that do.</P>
<P>The Governor thanked him for the Freedom and Openness he had used with him, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> told him, when he was ready to speak to him, he would let him know it.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>WEISER,</HI> by the Governor's Order, attended the Council. The Minutes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Yesterday's Conference were read over, and then each Paragraph by itself. Mr. <HI>Wei¦ser</HI> said, he apprehended <HI>Teedyuscung</HI>'s Relation, of what passed between him and <HI>Char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Broadhead,</HI> in a Light something different from what was set down in the Minutes, <HI>viz..</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Charles Broadhead</HI> had, in the Name of the Governor, charged on <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> the Murde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> committed on the Inhabitants of this Province, and demanded Satisfaction for them; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King denied the Charge, and sent a Message by him, with a Bundle of Wampum, to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> to assure him of his not having committed Hostilities. And fur¦ther, desired he might receive Orders from the Governor what to do, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mising to execut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them faithfully; and if it should be judged necessary, he would even go to Colonel <HI>Johnson</HI> and the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Country, with any Message the Governor would please to send there b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, but desired it might be sent in a certain Number of Days, after which, if it did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come, he would take it for granted the Governor believed the Stories told of him.</P>
<P>The Governor enquired of Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> into the Foundation of the Complaint made by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Indians,</HI> as to the Frauds said to be committed in Purchases of Land made of them by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Proprietaries; and he told the Governor, That few or none of the <HI>Delawares</HI> present, as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could recollect, originally owned any of these Lands, or any Land in this Province; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Injury was done, it was done to others, who were either dead or gone, some to the <HI>Ohi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and some to other Places.—That as to the Lands particularly instanced by <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heard that they were sold to, and the Consideration Money paid by, the first Proprietary, <HI>Wil¦liam Penn.</HI>—That when Mr. <HI>John Penn</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Penn</HI> were here, a Meeting wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then had with the principal <HI>Indians</HI> living on these Lands, and the former Agreement renew¦ed, and the Limits again settled between the Proprietaries and those Chiefs of the <HI>Delawares</HI> and accordingly a Line was soon after run by <HI>Indians</HI> and Surveyors. That the <HI>Delaware<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> complaining afterwards, their Complaint was heard in a great Council of the <HI>Six Nations</HI> held at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in the Year 1743, in which several Deeds, executed by the <HI>Delaware</HI> to the Proprietaries, were read, and interpreted, and the Signers Names and Marks examined and, after a long Hearing, the <HI>Six Nations</HI> declared the Complaints of their Cousins, the <HI>De∣lawares,</HI> to be unreasonable, and were very angry with them for complaining without Cause.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> being asked by the Governor, said, he had likewise heard Things to the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Effect, and was present at the Council when the <HI>Delawares</HI> Complaints were heard and set¦tled by the <HI>Six Nations</HI>; that it was a very large Council, consisting of the principal Chiefs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Delawares.</HI>—And added, he believed when the Matter should come to be well examine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into, the Proprietaries would not be found to have done Injustice to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> or to hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any of their Lands, for which those <HI>Indians</HI> had not given Deeds truly interpreted to them and received a Consideration.</P>
<P>But as neither Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> nor he, was concerned in this Transaction, and the Papers t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prove it were at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> this Matter might, on the Governor's Return, be thorougly en¦quired into, and if it should appear that Injustice had been done the <HI>Delawares</HI> in this, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any other of their Sales, they ought to receive Satisfaction.—After which the Governor pro¦posed to let the <HI>Indians</HI> know, that as to the particular Grievances they had mentioned, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be thorougly examined into, well considered, and, if justly founded, amply redresse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as quickly as the Nature of the Business would admit.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="007923_0024_102E024FEC8527E0" MS="y"/>But upon conferring with the Commissioners, he was told by them, that such Promises had been frequently made the <HI>Indians</HI> by Governors of other Provinces, and not performed, and these People might consider them as now made with a Design to evade giving them Redress.</P>
<P>The Commissioners said further, as more Goods were brought than were proper at this Time to be given to the small Number of <HI>Indians</HI> come down, it would be better, whe∣ther the Claim was just or unjust, to offer them immediate Satisfaction, which they, on the Part of the Publick, with the Governor's Approbation, were willing to do, judging this would effectually remove all their Uneasiness. The Governor concurring with them in Sentiments, an Answer to their Complaints was framed accordingly.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P><HI>The Governor spoke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>YOU expressed your Concern for what had happened, wiped the Tears from our Eyes, and the Blood from our Bodies, and having made clean the Council Seat, I heartily thank you for it. I do likewise wipe the Tears from your Eyes; I wash away the Blood from your Bodies, and from the Council Seat, that there may not remain the lest Defilement,</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I make you my Acknowledgments for your having searched our Wounds to the Bottom, and the good Remedies you have applied for their Cure, and I pray the Great Creator may bless our mutual Endeavours, that they may be so effectually healed as not to leave behind them the least Scar, or ever break out again, whilst the Rivers run, or the Sun and Moon give Light to the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As to what you say of the Message delivered to you at <HI>Wioming,</HI> by <HI>Charles Broadhead,</HI> the Governor did send him, and I could have wished you had sent some of your own People to me on so weighty an Occasion; and for the future, I must caution you not to hearken to any Messages as from this Government, unless the Persons charged with them are known to be publick Officers, usually employed for such Purposes, and the Papers they produce are sealed with the Seal of the Government.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for the Openness with which you have expressed yourselves as to the Causes why you struck us. The <HI>French</HI> practise every Artifice they are Masters of to deceive the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> and I am sorry your young Men should have been so foolish as to have hearkened to them. I hope they have sufficiently seen their Errors, and will not hereafter suffer them∣selves to be so deluded by that deceitful People.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Governor taking the Belt given by the <HI>Minisink Indians,</HI> repeated what <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said on it, and then answered it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As I conceive this Belt to be your Authority for acting at this Council-Fire, in Behalf of the <HI>Minisink Indians,</HI> who only came Part of the Way, I will keep it, and put it into the Council Bag, being glad to hear they have put their Hand to the Belt I sent, though I should have been better pleased to have seen them here.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007923_0025_102DC82DF8DCA7E8" MS="y"/>56. <HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You give me Hopes of another Visit. Assure yourself it will always give me Pleasure to receive you, and any other of our <HI>Indian</HI> Friends with you. Your kind Offer of giving me timely Notice of the Approach of an Enemy, is an incontestable Proof of the Warmth of your Heart for me; and as you have so freely offered it, I shall ever have an entire Depend∣ance upon you; and whatever Persons are sent with Intelligence of this Sort, shall be hand∣somely rewarded. I expect and desire you will give the same Intelligence to any other Gover∣nor whose Country you apprehend to be in Danger, as all the <HI>English</HI> are of the same Flesh and Blood, and Subjects of the same King.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a large String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am very glad you have been as good as your Word in coming down to the Council-Fire which was kindled on this particular Occasion. I believe you have used your best Endeavours, with great faithfulness, to effect every Thing you undertook. I heartily agree to the Peace as you have proposed it, provided all the <HI>English</HI> Colonies be included in it. But we cannot agree to make Peace for this Government alone, and leave you at Liberty to continue the War with our Brethren of the neighbouring Colonies; for we, the <HI>English,</HI> are all Subjects of one great King, and must, for the future, be all at Peace, or all at War, with other Nations at the same Time.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember it was stipulated, in the Conferences held last Summer, that all the Prisoners you had taken should be brought to this Council-Fire, and there delivered up; and as you have only delivered up five Prisoners, and I am sure many more have been taken, I desire to know why they have not been brought; they are our own Flesh and Blood, and we cannot be easy whilst they are kept in Captivity.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have opened your Heart, and shewn us the Reasons you thought you had for differin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with us: You have done well in speaking so plainly on that Head; but you should have made your Complaint to us before you lifted your Hand to strike, and that might have pre∣vented the Mischief. When the Great Creator made Man, he gave him a Tongue to com∣plain of Wrongs, two Ears to hear a Brother's Complaints, and two Hands to do him Ju∣stice, by removing the Cause.—All these were made before the Hatchet, and should be first used. Had the Man, in your Comparison, whose Pipe was taken from him, said, Brother, you took my Pipe from me at such a Time, and I must have Satisfaction; his Brother might have answered, I did not think you valued a Pipe so much, do not let us differ about a small Matter, here, Brother, take two of mine. That this Method, agreeable to our antien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Treaties, may be remembered, and Complaints always made by you to us, or by us to you, in a publick Manner, and Justice demanded before we strike, I give you this</P>
<P><HI>String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I am but lately come among you; the Grievances you mention are of old Date. If for∣mer <HI>Indian</HI> Kings have, as you say, sometimes sold more Land than they had a Right to sell, in so doing they injured us, and we, as well as you, have Cause to complain of them.—But sometimes, though they sold no more than their own, they sold it fairly, and it was honestly paid for by the <HI>English</HI>; yet when the <HI>Indian</HI> Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en grow up, they may forget that their Fathers sold the Lands, and divided the Goods; and some evil Spirit, or bad Man, that loves to make Mischief, may tell them, the Land is still yours; your Fathers never sold it; the Writings are false. Morever, many People, both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> concerned in the for∣mer Purchases of Lands, are now dead; and as you do not understand Writings and Re∣cords, it may be hard for me to satisfy you of the Truth, though my Predecessors dealt even so uprightly; therefore, to shew our sincere Desire to heal the present Differences, and live in eternal Peace, with you our Brethren, tell me what will satisfy you for the Injustice you suppose has been done you in the Purchase of Lands in this Province; and if it be in my Power, you shall have immediate Satisfaction, whether it be justly due to you or not. The good People of this Province are ready and willing to open their Hands, and help me, by contributing freely to this good Work.—Or if you are not impowered to receive such Satis∣faction at this Time, or have not Convenience to carry away the Goods that may be given you on that Account, then I will lodge the Goods in such Hands as you shall appoint, till you bring to our next Meeting your old Men of the several Nations, who may have a Right to a Share in the Division of those Goods, where they shall be ready to be delivered to them and you. This may be done at a Council-Fire, to be rekindled at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> for you and us, or here, as you shall chuse, when we expect, and insist, that you bring down all the Captives that still remain in your Country.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="007923_0026_102E0253F244C258" MS="y"/>And as you mention Grievances from the Neighbouring Governments, I make no Doubt, but on proper Application, you will have the utmost Justice done you; and if I can be of any Service to you in making the Application, it will give me great Pleasure; in Testimony whereof, I give you this</P>
<P><HI>Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You told us last Summer, that formerly there were many <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs who made Trea∣ties, some in one Place, and some in another, from whence Misunderstandings had often arose.—It was so formerly with the <HI>English</HI> Governments, each made War or Peace with the <HI>Indians</HI> for itself: They were not united in these great Affairs as Subjects of the same King ought to be, and so were much weaker.—Our wise King has now ordered Things bet∣ter, and put all <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs under one general Direction.—I shall send a full Account of all that has passed between this Government and the <HI>Indians,</HI> on this present Occasion, to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> to whom His Majesty has been pleased to commit the general Manage∣ment of <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs, for his Approbation and Ratification; and as this Gentleman, in Qua∣lity of being the King's general Agent in this Part of <HI>America,</HI> has, in Conjunction with your Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and all the Allies, kindled a general Council-Fire at his House, on the <HI>Mohocks River,</HI> I must insist upon it, that <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and a Deputation of your Chief Men, shall go to this Council-Fire, and there communicate every Thing to obtain Confirma∣tion, and take Advice as to your future Conduct, that there may be a perfect Union both of Council and Measures, as well on the Part of all the <HI>Indians,</HI> as others his Majesty's Subjects, without which this great Work of Peace will never be brought to its just Perfection.</P>

<P>The good People of this Province, affected with the Distresses which their Brethren the <HI>Indians</HI> must needs suffer in this severe Season, for want of Clothes and other Necessaries, have furnished me with a Quantity of Goods, to the Value of <HI>Four Hundred Pounds,</HI> to supply their Wants; a large Part of them is given by the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who are the Descendants of those who came over with <HI>William Penn,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a particular Testimony of their Regard and Affection for the <HI>Indians,</HI> and their earnest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ire to promote this good Work of Peace.</P>

<P><HI>The Governor acquainted</HI> Teedyuscung <HI>that be was ready to hear him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Teedyuscung, <HI>taking a String of Wampum, spoke in these Words.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I DESIRE you will hear me a few a Words with Patience. You may remember I of∣ten desired you to endeavour to apprehend me aright, when I am speaking of Matters of Importance.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Hear me with Patience; I am going to use a Comparison, in order to represent to you the better what we ought to do.</P>
<P>When you chuse a Spot of Ground for Planting, you first prepare the Ground, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you put the Seed into the Earth; but if you don't take Pains afterwards, you will not obtain Fruit.—To Instance, in the <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> which is mine (meaning a native Plant of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Country) I, as is customary, put seven Grains in one Hill, yet, without further Care, it wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come to nothing, tho' the Ground be good; tho' at the Beginning I take prudent Steps, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if I neglect it afterwards, tho' it may grow up to Stalks and Leaves, and there may be the Appearance of Ears, there will only be Leaves and Cobs.—In like Manner, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present Business, tho' we have begun well, yet if we hereafter use not prudent Means, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall not have Success answerable to our Expectations.—God, that is above, hath furnishe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us both with Powers and Abilities.—As for my own Part, I must confess, to my Shame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have not made such Improvements of the Power given me as I ought; but as I look on you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be more highly favoured from above than I am, I would desire you, that we would join ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Endeavours to promote the good Work; and that the Cause of our Uneasiness, begun in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Times of our Forefathers, may be removed; and if you look into your Hearts, and act according to the Abilities given you, you will know the Grounds of our Uneasiness i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some Measure from what I said before, in the Comparison of the Fire, that tho' I was but a Boy, yet I would according to my Abilities bring a few Chips; so with Regard to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Corn, I can do but little, you may a great deal; therefore let all of us, Men, Women and Children, assist in pulling up the Weeds, that nothing may hinder the Corn from growing to Perfection. When this is done, tho' we may not live to enjoy the Fruit ourselves, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we should remember, our Children may live and enjoy the Blessings of this good Fruit, and it is our Duty to act for their Good.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I desire you will attend to these few Words, and I will, with all Diligence, endeavour t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tell you the Truth; the great Log you mentioned, when kindled, will make a great Flame but it will not kindle of itself, nor continue flaming, unless there be Air and Leaves, as wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as Coals to make it kindle. I desire we may use our utmost Endeavours to make it kindle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> though what I have told you may relate to Matters disagreeable to you, yet if we exert our∣selves, and act according to the Abilities given from above, the Event will be agreeable, and pleasing to ourselves, and of Service to our Children.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Take Pains therefore, and though you are a Governor, do not put off these Things from Time to Time, as our Forefathers did.</P>
<P>The Interpreter was desired to tell, in other Words, what was the Meaning of what wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said in the two last Articles; and having requested Leave of <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> he said, he alluded to the Beginning of the War; the Quarrels between the King of <HI>France,</HI> and the King o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>England,</HI> and their People on both Sides, and that their young Men were deluded by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>French</HI>; this was the first and principal Cause, tho' other Things helped to make the Blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sall quicker and heavier.</P>
<P><HI>A. String.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="007923_0028_102E0259E007EF98" MS="y"/><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I will now in a few Words, according to my Abilities, give you an Answer. You desired me to acquaint you what the Grounds of my Uneasiness were, and I complied, tho' it was not the main Thing which I came about. But when you put me in mind, I was pleased, for before I thought it not proper to mention it in these difficult Times; it was not the Cause of the Stroke, tho' it was the Foundation of our Uneasiness. Now, Brother, in An∣swer to your Question, What will satisfy us? It is not usual, nor reasonable, nor can I tell you what the Damage is, and adjust, as in a Ballance, the true Value at that Time and these Times; formerly it might be lighter, but being delayed, it is now the heavier; the Interest is to be added. Besides, there are many more concerned in this Matter, not now present; and tho' many who have suffered are now in the Grave, yet their Descendants feel the Weight, and the more now for the Time they have waited.</P>
<P>Also, Brother, I require you would throw down the Fence that confines some of my Brethren and Relations in the <HI>Jerseys,</HI> that they may, if they see Cause, come and see their Relations. I do not want to compel any of them to come, or to stay against their Will. If they are inclined to stay and live among the <HI>English,</HI> I am quite willing they should come back again; but I want they should come and see me, that thereby I may convince their Relations, and the other Nations afar off, that I am now treating with, that they are not Servants, but a free People.</P>
<P>I do not request that all Men, Women and Children should come; but some, or as many as may be sufficient to convince other Nations that they are not confined, but have Liberty as well as we: In particular, one called <HI>Philip,</HI> he has a Wife, and Relations among us; to my Grief I heard he was carried to Goal, and there confined with some others, and put to Death; but I understand the Account of his Death was false. I desire he may have Liberty to come and see his Relations. I also request that you would apply to the Governor on the other Side the River (<HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Jerseys</HI>) and to use your utmost En∣deavours with him, that he would give them Leave to come, and that they may come under your Protection, be they more or less, in the great Road to us opened by this Province.</P>
<P>But though you should not do this, yet I will use my utmost Endeavours to bring you down your Prisoners, there are only two in my Power. You may hear otherwise, but I de∣clare I have no more than two in my Power: There are more in the Possession of others, and these, with your Assistance, I may be able to bring down; and I will endeavour to ga∣ther and scoop in as many as I can, but I shall want your Help to do it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have to request you, that you would give Liberty to all Persons and Friends to search into these Matters; as we are all Children of the Most High, we should endeavour to assist and make use of one another, and not only so, but from what I have heard, I believe there is a future State besides this Flesh; now I endeavour to act on both these Principles, and will, according to what I have promised, if the Great Spirit spare my Life, come next Spring, with as great a Force of <HI>Indians</HI> as I can get, to your Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>By this String now delivered, and lying before you, I assure you I have spoken on all Mat∣ters the best I could, according to my mean Capacity and Abilities. I shall depend on my Interpreter, who I believe is an honest Man, but I think it prudent, in order to prevent Mis∣understandings, that I should be furnished with a Copy of what is done, as well in the Con∣ferences held here last Summer as at this Time; for though I am not able to read, yet others may; it will be a great Satisfaction to have it in my Power to shew to others what has passed between this Government and me: What is committed to Writing will not easily be lost, and will be of great Use to all, and better regarded; and I would have the Names and Seals of all that have been concerned in transacting this Business put to it: I do not desire a Copy now, but that it may be ready for me when I come again.—The Interpreter, <HI>Pumpshire,</HI> informed the Governor, that what <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> was going to say was not material, or of much Impor∣tance, as it related to himself; adding, though he might be considered as a simple Man, yet throughout all this Affair he had acted uprightly and honestly.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I will speak in Favour of the Interpreter; he acted as such in Governor <HI>Morris</HI>'s Time as well as yours; and I am pleased with his Conduct on both Occasions.—If we should have any further Business to transact, I desire he may be employed.—You know he lives in another Province, and is on that Account at some Expence; reward him well for his Services; and do it well for my Sake; but I shall leave it to you.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="007923_0029_102E025C33375018" MS="y"/><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I have something, though of no great Consequence, yet to mention. I am in low Cir∣cumstances, and have not Things suitable; I wish I had—however, I have fifteen Deer Skins, which, as I see you love to have your Hands covered, I present you, to make Gloves of, or for any other Use you shall think proper. Eighty fine large Ones were brought at first, but on our Journey from <HI>Diabogo</HI> to <HI>Wioming,</HI> some of the <HI>Indians</HI> with me were so discou∣raged by Alarms, that they returned home, and took with them all but the Fifteen, which, I desire your Acceptance of.</P>
<P>The Governor returned him Thanks, and told him, he accepted of them as a Mark of his Affection, without regard to the Value of the Skins.—He then reminded <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> that it was intended the Goods should have been delivered Yesterday, but as it grew late, and the Room in which they sat at Dinner was so small, it was agreed they should be brought here, and delivered, which was done, the Lists read, and the <HI>Indians</HI> left to divide the Goods.</P>

<P>THE Commissioners advising the Governor to fix at this Meeting the Sum to be given in full Satisfaction of all Injuries done to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to offer it to them now, Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> was sent to consult with <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> if this would be agreeable; and Mr. <HI>Wei∣ser</HI> having done so, reported, That the King declared against it, saying, he had no Power to take any Sum, tho' the Governor should offer him never so much, the People to whom the Land belonged being absent; but he would endeavour to bring as many of them down as he could find to the next Meeting, when it might be further considered.</P>
<P>Several Matters remaining to be mentioned to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Governor sent for <HI>Teedyus∣cung,</HI> the four <HI>Six Nation Indians,</HI> the two <HI>Shawanese,</HI> and one or two <HI>Delawares,</HI> and in the Presence of the Commissioners, and some other Gentlemen, he spoke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Only one Thing of what was said Yesterday requires an Answer, which I am now going to give you.</P>
<P>By this String, you desired me to make Application to the Governor of <HI>Jersey,</HI> that the Fence might be broke down which confined the <HI>Indians,</HI> and that they, or some of them, might have Liberty to go into the <HI>Indian</HI> Country, and correspond with their Relations and Friends as formerly, and particularly to obtain this Liberty for one <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Jersey,</HI> you know, is a different Government from this; I will use my best Endeavours with the Governor to grant your Request, but I apprehend I shall meet with this Difficulty, that as you have some of their People Prisoners with you, before they grant your Request, they will expect these shall be returned, which I think would be adviseable for you to do; particularly you have with you a Boy, whose Name is <HI>Hunt,</HI> taken near <HI>Paulin</HI>'s Kiln, in that Province, whose Mother is now here, and requests he may be sent down among the first.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I consider you as the Counsellor and Agent of this Province, and as such obliged to assist us all you can. By this String, I confirm your Appointment.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>As our Prisoners may suffer for Want of Clothes and other Necessaries in this severe Season, we would wish to have them as soon possible, and to that End propose to send with you <PB N="31" REF="007923_0030_102E025DD42B5C50" MS="y"/>two Messengers, who may collect them together, and bring them down; and I desire you will give them your Assistance, which will be a further Proof of your Sincerity.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B. Two of the</HI> Six Nation Indians <HI>were employed in this Service.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>If any of our <HI>Indians</HI> shall incline to come into the Province, and live among their Bre∣thren, the <HI>English,</HI> I do now assure you, that they shall be kindly received and supported, and live together in one Place, the most convenient that can be got for the Purpose.</P>
<P>Or as there is now a strong Fort at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> built at the Request of your Uncles, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> for the Protection of the Friendly <HI>Indians,</HI> I propose to have a Store of Goods in it, the Direction and Management of which will be given to an honest Man, who shall not be suffered to impose upon the <HI>Indians</HI>; and I shall be glad all our Friendly <HI>Indians,</HI> who are scattered and distressed in these troublesome Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, will come and live near it; there they will be protected from the <HI>French</HI>; there they will have a large uninhabited Country to hunt in; and there they may be furnished with Clothes, and all other Necessaries of Life, at the casiest Rates.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You know that at the last Treaty the Road was opened for us to go to each other; I now give you this Belt to preserve the Communication free and clear of all Obstructions, let there be nothing in it that can hurt the Feet, or wound the Body of either.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Since I set out, I have heard of the Death of several of our <HI>Indian</HI> Friends by the Small∣pox at <HI>l'hiladelphia,</HI> and particularly Captain <HI>Newcastle,</HI> is dead, who was very instrumental, and joined with you as Agent, in carrying on this good Work of Peace. I wipe away your Tears; I take the Grief from your Hearts; I cover the Graves; eternal Rest be with their Spirits.</P>
<P><HI>A String of Wampum, eleven black Strouds with some Handkerchiefs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Peace is now settled between us by the Assistance of the Most High; but the <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Interest still commit Murders on our Frontiers, and our Soldiers are in Pursuit of them. I desire you will order your young Men not to straggle about, but keep in the straight Path to your Towns, so that they may not be mistaken by our Soldiers for <HI>French Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> thanked the Governor for his kind Speeches, and said, he was very glad that the Governor had thought of sending two Messengers with him for the Prisoners, and pro∣mised to assist them.</P>
<P>After the Condolance made on Captain <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s Death, the King made an Address as is usual to the other <HI>Indians</HI> on this mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nful Occasion: They continued silent for some Time, and then one of the oldest of them spoke an Exhortation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Nature of a Funeral Ora∣tion; after which <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> expressed to the Governor the great Satisfaction given to him at his condoling the Death of Captain <HI>Newcastle,</HI> who, he said, was a good Man, and had promoted the good Work of Peace with great Care; his Death would put him in Mind of his Duty, as it should als of us.</P>
<P>He then spoke in a warm and pathetick Manner in Favour of the Peace now settled, and implored the Assistance of the Most High to bring it to Perfection.</P>
<P>The Governor understanding that several of the <HI>Indians</HI> inclined to stay, desired <HI>Teedyus∣cung</HI> to give him the Names of such as would live with their Brethren the <HI>English.—Teedy∣uscung,</HI> mistaking the Governor, as if he had said, they must stay, answered, smiling, he did not understand any <HI>Indians</HI> were to be forced to stay, but left to their Liberty. If the Governor wanted any to stay, and desired it, he would stay himself, and his Wife and Fami∣ly with him. The Governor set the Matter Right, thanked him, and wished him well; took his Leave of him, saying, they had met and parted Friends, and he hoped they would meet again as good Friends as now.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> shewed great Pleasure in his Countenance, and took a kind Leave of the Go∣vernor and all present.</P>

<HEAD><HI>EXTRACT from the Minutes of the House of</HI> REPRESENTATIVES <HI>of the Province <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Pennsylvania, January <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7▪ 1757</HEAD>
<Q>The four Provincial Commissioners Members of this House, who were appointed to attend the Governor at the late Conference with the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Easton,</HI> presented a Pape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the House, which was read, and is as follows, viz.</Q>
<P>WE, the Committee, appointed to attend the Governor at the Conferences with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Easton,</HI> in <HI>November</HI> last, have perused the Copy of those Conferences drawn up and signed by the Secretary, and said before the House;</P>
<P>And as we apprehend it of Importance to the Province, that the Complaints made by the <HI>Indians,</HI> whether justly founded or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be fully represented, and their Sense of them understood, we think it necessary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve to the House, that we conceive the Warmth and Earnestness with which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted on the Wrongs that had been done them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Purchases of Land, are much too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly expressed in this Account of the Conference. Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we were not present at the palliating Hearsay Accounts, of the Walking Purchase, said to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> given the Governor by Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> on the Fourteenth of <HI>November</HI>; tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the concluding Paragraphs und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Date, it may seem as if we were: But we wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remember, that the Transaction of that Walk was at <HI>Easton</HI> universally given up as unfair and not to be defended, even from the Accounts of some of our own People who were present at the Walking; even the Secretary, tho' he did say, that he <HI>believed</HI> Satisfaction was afterwards made the <HI>Indians,</HI> and that this was the only Instance in which any Foun∣dation of Complaint had ever been given them, yet, this he allowed was (in his own Words) <HI>unworthy of any Government.</HI> We would farther observe, that when <HI>Teedyascung</HI> claimed the Lands, even those on which the Conferences were held, no Objection was made that neither he, nor any with him, had any Right to them; nor did we ever understand h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reason, for not accepting Satissaction to be as represented in the second Paragraph under <HI>November</HI> 17, for that "<HI>the People</HI> to whom the Land belonged were absent;"—but fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that many of them were absent, and those who were absent, had not impowered him to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for them in that Matter; but he would endeavour to bring them in the Spring.</P>
<P>The Offer of the Commissioners to furnish the Means of making the <HI>Indians</HI> immediate Satisfaction, not being fully related, we think it necessary to add, That the Reasons we gave the Governor for that Offer, were, 1. The Absence and great Distance of the Proprietaries, who being the sole Purchasers of Land from the <HI>Indians,</HI> in this Province, ought, if the <HI>Indians</HI> were injured in such Purchases, alone to make the Satisfaction; but their Agents here had not the necessary Powers. 2. For that Promises [such being proposed] of enquiring into <HI>Indian</HI> Complaints, and doing them Right hereafter, had been so often made in other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Governments, and so little observed, we imagined they could be of no Weight, and would rather be looked upon as a Denial of Justic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and therefore, we thought it better, as their Demands are seldom very high, to make them immediate Reparation for the Injuries they supposed they had received, and we would furnish the Goods, and risque the Proprietarie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> repaying their Value to the Province. The Secretary then told us, that he thought our Pro∣posal very considerate and well-judged; that he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etaries would think them∣selves obliged to us, and repay the Money with Thanks: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> made, but not accepted for the Reasons above<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entioned. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Governor in a Body, and acquainted his Honour, That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had made the Offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehalf of the Pro∣vince, not from an Opinion that the Province <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght to be at such Expence, but from the apparent immediate Necessity of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and on Account of the Proprietaries Absence a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aforesaid; so now since the sinal Settlement of the <HI>Indians</HI> Claims <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> postponed to the Spring, and there would be sufficient Time to write to the Proprietaries and obtain their Orders to their Agents for the Payment of such Sums as should he found necessary, we looked on ourselves and the Province as totally disengaged from that Offer, and expected that the Proprietaries would be wrote to accordingly.</P>
