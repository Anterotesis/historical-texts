<HEAD>On the <HI>Death</HI> OF THE QUEEN. To His EXCELLENCY <HI>Governour BELCHER</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hile from each soul the sorrows copious flow,</L>
<L>And weeping Nations heave with mighty woe;</L>
<L>Whilst ev'ry lyre to mournful notes is strung,</L>
<L>And CAROLINA flutters on each tongue:</L>
<L>The mourning Muse, to consolation deaf,</L>
<L>Swells the sad consort with melodious grief.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="004229_0004_100422B3CD0081A8"/>
Ten flow'ry springs on golden plumes have flown</L>
<L>Since she, triumphant, hail'd thee on thy throne.</L>
<L>Oh CAROLINE! Oh Princess now no more!</L>
<L>Each heart bleeds inward, and all eyes deplore.</L>
<L>Stretch'd pale in death thy lovely limbs are laid,</L>
<L>Thy beauty, <HI>Albion,</HI> and thy joys are fled!</L>
<L>To thee, our tears their filial torrents bring,</L>
<L>And ev'ry passion opens ev'ry spring:</L>
<L>Lost to despair, in wild laments we moan,</L>
<L>And distant regions echo groan for groan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas she, adorn'd by Virtue's heav'nly charms,</L>
<L>In rosey beauty blest her Prince's arms;</L>
<L>Her lover with a pious eye she view'd,</L>
<L>And CAESAR at her feet successless su'd:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="004229_0005_100401D98AF09D08"/>
Imperial purple her calm eyes disdain,</L>
<L>And <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles wav'd their wings in vain;</L>
<L>Inspir'd, Religion's dictates to discharge,</L>
<L>She gave her self to <HI>Britain</HI> and to GEORGE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, rais'd <HI>Britannia,</HI> how her gentle air,</L>
<L>Adorn'd the palace, and improv'd the fair.</L>
<L>Discord, and party-rage grew tame, to gaze,</L>
<L>And noisy factions clamour'd in her praise.</L>
<L>Domestick life th' illustrious Pattern grac'd;</L>
<L>On Royal milk the Royal infants feast:</L>
<L>Form'd by her hands the Monarch race were seen,</L>
<L>The rip'ning Hero, and the future Queen.</L>
<L>Far fom vain courts her silent footsteps roam,</L>
<L>Where chosen volumes deck'd the sacred dome:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="004229_0006_100422BADDEBA718"/>
Still loud applauses of the joyful age,</L>
<L>Pursu'd her thro' the lonely Hermitage.</L>
<L>Here, in high raptures, her immortal mind,</L>
<L>O'er <HI>Newton</HI>'s Orbs expatiates, unconfin'd;</L>
<L>Familiar guest! she visits all the Skies,</L>
<L>From world to world, from sun to sun she flies;</L>
<L>Thence smiles at Mimick crowns which Sultans wear</L>
<L>In the mock empires of this little star.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such was the Queen! she was — but is no more! —</L>
<L>Wide wounds the woe, and spreads from shore to shore;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="004229_0007_100422BF5EF1AD38"/>
Groans the hoarse Ocean as the tydings fly,</L>
<L>Wave roars to wave, and rocks to rocks reply,</L>
<L><HI>She was, but is no more</HI> — lost all relief!</L>
<L>Now all her graces greaten all our grief.</L>
<L>Ev'n our far land its anguish loud proclaims,</L>
<L>We felt her influence, and we blest her beams.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, <HI>BELCHER,</HI> first in Grief as in Com∣mand;</L>
<L>With early zeal you kist her beauteous hand;</L>
<L>Your honours to the destin'd Queen you paid,</L>
<L>Ere the crown flash'd, far-beaming, on her head</L>
<L>The Muse reluctant, by your Order sings,</L>
<L>Else had she silent wept, and broke her strings.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="004229_0008_100422C2B8B2C540"/>
What fame to <HI>us</HI> reports, by <HI>you</HI> were seen,</L>
<L>The glance attractive, the majestick mien,</L>
<L>The Angel form each milder feature wears,</L>
<L>That look obliging, those descending airs.</L>
<L>Collected in her innocence she stood,</L>
<L>Devout to Heav'n, to men divinely good,</L>
<L>You saw— now see the fated end of all:</L>
<L>How the FAIR fades, and how the MIGHTY fall!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the pale cheek its faded blush resign,</L>
<L>The dying eyes with transient lustre shine;</L>
<L>Hoarse the sunk voice, the breast no longer warm,</L>
<L>And death gains fast o'er ev'ry mortal charm.</L>
<L>O Virtue, now thy joys are all sincere!</L>
<L>Th' exulting Queen demands the final pray'r,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="004229_0009_100422C444EE2560"/>
(Eternal glories op'ning to her view,)</L>
<L>Waves her joy hand, and bids the Globe adieu.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See, in the Regal vaults, the shatter'd lead,</L>
<L>Whose gaping seams disclose the Royal dead.</L>
<L>Were these, O Muse, triumphant Sov'reigns once!</L>
<L>This skin all shrivel'd! and these naked bones!</L>
<L>No more resentful, great ELIZA, rest,</L>
<L>Support in peace the <HI>Scottish Mary's</HI> chest!</L>
<L>Whilst close, by Glorify'd MARIA's shrine,</L>
<L>We place the dust of Heav'nly CAROLINE.</L>
<L>Ye Living, hear what mouldring Monarchs say!</L>
<L><HI>"For endless joys give mortal dreams away.</HI></L>
