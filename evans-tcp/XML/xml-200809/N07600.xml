<P>IN Consequence of the present Debate, every impartial Free∣holder of the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> will be naturally induced to consider which of the Professions in this Country he would ven∣ture to chuse as Guardian of his civil and religious Liberties, in a <HI>Government,</HI> where, according to the Constitution, no one Pro¦fession in particular can be established by Law, withous a manifest breach and Violation of its original Foundation. But as the Contest seems particularly to be between the <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> we ought, as Members of one common Society, seriously to weigh the Merits of both Parties, before we list ourselves under the Banner of ei∣ther,—Neither ought Country, Prejudice of Education, or particular Opinions in Religion, sway us with regard to <HI>Government▪</HI> because even the <HI>Mahometan Jurisdiction</HI> is to be preferred (with respect to Liberty of Conscience) to many Countries in <HI>Europe</HI> govern'd by Christians.</P>
<P>I have never read of any Country in the World, where <HI>Quakers</HI> have had Authority except <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> so that all the Examples of their good or bad Administration, must be drawn from this Place. Now even the most prejudiced cannot but acknowledge, after taking an impartial View of the conduct of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that we have been wisely and judicious∣ly govern'd. For Matters of Fact speak loudly in their Favour. The present amazing Perfection this Province has arrived to in so short a Time, both in Riches, Trade and Commerce, is owing to the wise and prudent Ad∣ministration of this good People. Was not every useful and salutary Plan pursued by them to encourage Emigrents of all Nations to settle here? And when they did settle, did they not enjoy Liberties both civil and religious in the most ample Manner? Has the bloody Spirit of Per∣secution ever prevail'd among them to the Detriment of other Chri∣stians.
<PB N="6" REF="009703_0004_0F7A44F8305BEDB8"/>
And to whom can the distressed go with surer Confidence of Re∣lief than to them. And I dare venture to affirm that these very Consi∣derations mov'd the first Adventurers from <HI>Ireland,</HI> to send for their poor Relations to populate this Province, whose delightful Plains far surpass the barren Mountains of <HI>Carentaugher, Slemish</HI> or <HI>Slevgallion.</HI></P>
<P>Whether any of these new comers settled upon unpurchased Land belonging to <HI>Indians,</HI> or whether they always kept within Bounds, is a Question I will not undertake to determine. But however it appears very unlikely that the <HI>Indians</HI> should maintain an inviolable friendship with us, when they might have crush'd us in a moment, till we were grown a numerous People, and then go to war with us for no reason when we were able to cope with them in the field of battle.</P>
<P>I shall readily allow that according to the strict rules of <HI>Quaker prin∣ciples,</HI> they are not qualified to govern in time of war. And indeed the majority of those worthy people themselves are of the same opinion; for some time ago, when there was an absolute necessity for protecting this province by an armed force, many of the <HI>Friends</HI> who were then in the House of <HI>Assembly</HI> resign'd their seats, and left the management of public affairs in the hands of people of another profession. This part of their conduct certainly argued great prudence and discretion, as well as wisdom and modesty. But had their seats been fill'd with <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> we shou'd innevitably have been in a much worse condition, for it is very evident from undeniable facts, that they are by no means proper men to hold the reigns of government, either in war or peace.</P>
<P>For if a firm attachment to the <HI>King,</HI> and the laws of our country, be necessary qualifications for a Representative of the people, a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> can lay no claim to them; and consequently ought not to be elected. If we are to form any judgment of the present members of that society by either their own conduct, or that of their forefathers, we shall find that in the annals both of ancient and modern History, <HI>Presbyterianism and Rebellion</HI> were twin-sisters, sprung from faction; and their affection for each other has been ever so strong, that a separation of them never cou'd be effected. What <HI>King</HI> has ever reign'd in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> whose Government has not been disturb'd with <HI>Presbyterian Rebellions,</HI> since ever they were a people? Will they not be answerable for all the inno∣cent blood spilt at <HI>Pentland Hills</HI> and <HI>Bothel Bridge?</HI> From whence cou'd they have possibly learn'd but from <HI>Mahomet</HI> to propogate their Religion with the Sword. If we were to credit their Hypocritical declarations, we must believe they are actuated in all their proceedings by the gra∣cious influences of the <HI>Blessed Spirit,</HI> and to be the most loyal subjects in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America.</HI> But do they not belie the <HI>Blessed Spirit</HI> in fathering upon him all the unnatural Rebellions they wickedly raised against their lawful Sovereign <HI>King Charles</HI> the <HI>First?</HI> Did the <HI>Blessed Spirit</HI> teach them to rebel twice, and match to the borders of <HI>England;</HI> and after obtaining every thing they unjustly desir'd, break their public faith the third time, by entering into a most damnable covenant to march an army into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="009703_0005_0F7A44F90FB1B728"/>
with a view to extirpate or butcher all those of the <HI>English Nation,</HI> who wou'd not join them in the worship of their great goddess the <HI>Pres∣bytery,</HI> which they had set up in their own country▪ Did the <HI>Blessed Spirit</HI> teach them to sell their <HI>King,</HI> in imitation of <HI>Judas</HI> who sold out <HI>Savior,</HI> even after he had voluntarily resign'd himself: Did they not murder their <HI>King</HI> in the face of the sun, and put a Tyrant chosen from the very dreggs of the people upon the Throne, who ruled them with a rod of iron, and corrected their harden'd and stubborn dispositions with scor∣pions instead of whips? How did they raise insurrections in various parts of the kingdom against <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Second.</HI> And when they collect¦ed an army of saints to fight <HI>Cromwell</HI> at the battle of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> did not their ministers in the name of the Lord assure the army of success; de∣clar'd that they had been seeking <HI>God;</HI> and had obtained an answer to their prayers? <HI>Cromwell</HI> however soon made it appear that they had be∣lied the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and prophesied falsely.</P>
<P>Was not the <HI>Scotch Rebellion</HI> one principal cause of the insurrection of the <HI>Irish-Papists</HI> in the Year 164<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? The Success that attended the one in behalf of the <HI>Kirk,</HI> encouraged the other to pursue the same steps in favor of the <HI>Mass,</HI> and if so, it may undoubtedly be made a question, whether all the innocent blood that was shed in that horrid <HI>Massacre,</HI> may not be justly laid to their charge? Certain it is the Natives of both king∣doms seem'd to vie with each other in acts of cruelty. For if the <HI>Ca∣tholics</HI> committed many outrages in defending their country against the inroads and depredations of those foreign interlopers who swarm'd like locusts from the barren hills of <HI>Loughaber</HI> in search of a better country, the <HI>Scotch-Presbyterians</HI> were no way behind hand with them, when with∣out the least remorse, they murder'd 4,000 of the native <HI>Irish,</HI> men, women and children in the <HI>Isle Mc-Gee,</HI> much in the same manner their offspring murdered the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Lancaster.</HI></P>
<P>However glorious the <HI>Revolution</HI> might be, it is very certain the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> had no hand in it; for it is well known that when the <HI>Eng∣lish Church</HI> refus'd to comply with <HI>King James</HI>'s dispensing power (for which seven of their Bishops were imprison'd, and one of their Univer∣sities ruin'd) the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> join'd with that weak, bigotted and tyran∣nical Prince, and thank'd his Majesty in many fulsome Addresses from all parts of the kingdom, for his goodness in overturning the constitution in favor of them and their dear Brethren the <HI>Catholics.</HI> Many of this same godly sect took commissions from <HI>James,</HI> and rais'd Regiments in order to oppose the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but when the designs of our <HI>glori∣ous Deliverer</HI> were attended with success, then indeed they turn'd tail up∣on their old master, and set up their pretensions for merit with the new King, who, being bred a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> establish'd their Religion in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> and conferr'd many other acts of favor on them. All this, not∣withstanding, cou'd not preserve his peace, or deter them from plotting against his Government and person; for altho' they valued the Man, yet they hated the King, being desirous of no King, but King <HI>Jesus.</HI> His
<PB N="8" REF="009703_0006_0F7A44FB67E55D18"/>
Majesty, who had been bred up in the principles of moderation in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI> recommended a Bill to be passed for the Toleration of Dissenters in <HI>Scotland;</HI> but the <HI>General Assembly</HI> of that kingdom represented it to the people in such odious and black colors, and petition'd with so much spirit and warmth against it, as having a pernicious and dangerous ten∣dency to destroy the <HI>Kirk,</HI> that it was laid aside. From this period the <HI>King</HI> despis'd and abhorr'd them, as a bigotted, stiff-necked, rebellious, pedantic crew, who had grossly impos'd upon him, in procuring an or∣der to massacre the poor innocent inhabitants of <HI>Glencoe</HI> in cold blood.</P>
<P>I should exceed the bounds I have prescrib'd to myself if I was to give a minute account of the Rebellions, which happened in the Year 1715 and 1745 in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when that kingdom was twice up in arms in favor of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> under two of the wisest and best <HI>Kings</HI> that ever sway'd the <HI>British</HI> Scepter; I mean <HI>George</HI> the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>George</HI> the <HI>Second.</HI> Neither has the Government of our present most gracious <HI>Sovereign</HI> es∣cap'd. It was but the last summer that thousands of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in the North of <HI>Ireland</HI> took up arms under pretence of grievances; but it evidently appear'd that their malice was chiefly bent against the <HI>Church-Clergy,</HI> who stood in the way of their idol, <HI>Presbytery;</HI> for they made all the establish'd Clergy in the North fly to the strong Fortress of <HI>Lon∣donderry,</HI> in order to avoid being massacred. From all these instances it appears that <HI>Presbyterians</HI> have been always enemies to <HI>Kingly-Govern∣ment,</HI> and consequently not fit to be entrusted with any share of the civil power, when a King reigns: And how can it be otherwise, seeing that not only their solemn League and Covenant, to which thousands of them adhere to this day, was founded on Rebellion; but that <HI>Formula</HI> of doc∣trine and discipline, call'd the <HI>Westminster Confession,</HI> which is the pre∣sent infallible standard receiv'd by the whole body of them, was com∣pos'd by a set of men, when they were in open <HI>Rebellion</HI> against their King; destroying the <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and endeavouring to plan, both in Church and State, the Constitution of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> after the model of a <HI>Geneva</HI> Republic.</P>
<P>These few hints may serve as a <HI>Looking-Glass</HI> for <HI>Presbyterians</HI> born within the Dominions of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> (as Foreigners who go under that name in this Province are not concern'd) who wou'd feign think themselves qualified persons to sit as Representatives of a free People. I earnestly hope, every other denomination will take the pains to examine them thro' this perspective, which is no magnifying one; and then judge whether they are fit to be intrusted with our lives, liberties and properties; especially if they keep in mind, that whenever this righteous people have the power in their hands, they will tolerate no other profes∣sion or opinion but their own, and never cease till they establish them¦selves in such a manner as to exclude all other sects. For the proof of this, witness <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>New-England;</HI> countries where their reli∣gion has been propagated by the Sword, instead of that peaceful manner recommended by the <HI>blessed Jesus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009703_0007_0F7A44FD591DC388"/>Let the righteous blood of the <HI>Quakers</HI> unjustly shed in <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> purely for Conscience sake, warn the inhabitants of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> from trusting <HI>Presbyterians</HI> with power, least the same mournful Trage∣dies shou'd be acted over again!</P>
<P>I come now more particularly to consider the Pamphlet intitled the <HI>"Quaker unmask'd"</HI> or <HI>"Plain Truth"</HI> address'd (and that seriously too) to the Freemen of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author sets out with advising us, to find out the "Aggressors" that the saddle at last may be put on the right horse. Here I join Issue with him, and do affirm that the reason of all the present <HI>Party-Rage</HI> was the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> murdering the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Lancaster,</HI> under the Protec∣tion of Government; had this not happen'd we shou'd have had none of all this disturbance among us. But how they came to be spirited on to such an inhuman deed, more than the <HI>Dutch</HI> who are equal sufferers with them on the Frontiers, can be accounted for no otherwise, than because they exceed all other People in acts of brutality. This polite, elegant, witty Pamphleteer condemns the action himself, but wou'd have us consi∣der the alleviating circumstance, "<HI>What are they?</HI>
<Q>Why the Massacre of the back Inhabitants.</Q>
Here one wou'd have expected that the Gentleman wou'd have attempted to prove the <HI>Lancaster Indians</HI> guilty; but not a word against them; not even a presumption. They had liv'd long 'tis true even from their infancy, in the interior parts of the pro∣vince; their characters are well known to be inoffensive; but we lost our relations by <HI>Indian Barbarians;</HI> and therefore we will kill <HI>Indians</HI> where∣ver we can find them. A fine way of reasoning! Old <HI>King Hendric</HI> who died gloriously fighting at the head of his troops for the <HI>English,</HI> wou'd innevitably have been murder'd, had he met with any of the <HI>Paxton-Vo∣luntiers</HI> before that time. Those brave Fellows also under <HI>Sir William Johnson,</HI> wou'd have dyed by the very men, for whom they are going to battle. And not even the <HI>blessed Presbyterian Indian Saints</HI> under the learned, pious and Rev. <HI>Mr. Braynard</HI> would have escap'd the <HI>Paxton-Boys.</HI></P>
<P>Another alleviating Circumstance our Author mentions, page 6th, is, "that they had long before sent several petitions to the Governor and Assembly, which were conceal'd by ill designing persons." I wish this elegant writer had nam'd the men to whom the Petitions were delivered, that the public might be aware of them. Those in Government who act wrong shou'd undoubtedly be brought to the light, that if members of the House, we may mark them at the next election; and if of the Coun∣cil, that his Honor may call them to an account for thus bringing him and the Province into distress. This is a Piece of Justice due to the inno∣cent, who are under this indefinite charge? for why shou'd the prudent and just be censur'd for a fault of which they never were guilty; Besides, why was not copies of the petitions publish'd, that the public might judge whether they contain'd any thing worthy the attention of the <HI>Le∣gislature.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009703_0008_0F7A44FE43669EE8"/>After all, I am induc'd to believe the truth is, these men acted in the same manner the <HI>Catholics</HI> did in <HI>Ireland,</HI> First begin the <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and then appoint the ablest of their Divines to study for arguments to sup∣port it.</P>
<P>We are told in this same sublime pamphlet,
<Q>that some of the <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>Barracks</HI> were well known to have been at the battle against Col. <HI>Bouquet,</HI> and at the Siege of <HI>Fort Pitt</HI> by officers who are in town.</Q>
If so, these military Gentlemens conduct, upon this occasion, ought to have been a pattern of humanity to these brave <HI>Paxton Volunteers▪</HI> Parti∣cularly when we reflect that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Capt. Don.</NOTE> one of these very Officers whom we have the honor to reside among us, in an engagement with these <HI>Savages,</HI> was shot, as I apprehend, through the Lungs, and notwithstanding this took up arms in their defence, when likely to be attack'd at the Barracks.</P>
<P>What was it did honor to the characters of <HI>General Amherst</HI> and <HI>Sir William Johnson</HI> upon the total reduction of <HI>Canada,</HI> but their rest<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain∣ing our <HI>Indians</HI> and Army from any acts of cruelty upon the <HI>Canadians</HI> or their <HI>Savage Allies,</HI> who had been murdering and scalping our Pron∣tiers all this war? To kill an enemy in the heat of battle is honorable, but to put him to death when he is disarm'd, tied and bound at your feet, is a cowardly action, and argues a prodigious depravity of <HI>Human Nature.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author produces the Revolution as an instance to justify the <HI>Pax∣ton-Insurgents.</HI> If he thus misapplies the Bible when he preaches, he shall never be my Teacher. But for curiosity sake, let us see how the comparison will hold. The whole People of <HI>England</HI> headed by two branches of the <HI>Legislature,</HI> opposes the King for perverting the Govern∣ment. Therefore about two hundred <HI>lawless Banditti</HI> of <HI>Paxton</HI> and <HI>Donegall</HI> may attempt to overthrow all the parts of the <HI>Legislature</HI> in <HI>Penn∣sylvania.</HI>—A Province containing about 250,000 Inhabitants. Such is the great force of our Author's Logic when reduced to form; but I am almost tired with his absur'd and inconclusive manner of reasoning.</P>
<P>Our Author further tells us, page 6th,
<Q>the <HI>Indians</HI> were in great danger of receiving their just deserts;</Q>
i. e. the <HI>Paxton Boys</HI> were just at hand with intention to murder them, had not their Friends from the Ci∣ty, who were in League with them, made them acquainted with the regu∣lar force in the Barracks: But he forgets himself page 8th, where he in∣forms us,
<Q>that their design was nothing else, but that their grievances might have a fair hearing.</Q>
Thus he contradicts in one page what he asserts in another, My advice to him is (and I humbly apprehend it is sa∣lutary) that he wou'd get some better information of the subject he un∣dertakes to discuss. when he takes up his pen the next time to write, otherwise he will be perpetually liable to mistakes and blunders.</P>
<P>"The <HI>Paxton Boys</HI> were brave and loyal subjects to his Majesty" says this judicious Pamphleteer. As to their bravery no body will ever dis∣pute it that has heard of their gallant and loyal behaviour at <HI>Lancaster</HI> where only fifty of them compleatly armed were able to vanquish a nu∣merous company of eight men and women, and seven small children, all
<PB N="11" REF="009703_0009_0F7A44FF28FE3B70"/>
coop'd up in a Jail. The same of this noble and gallant exploit ought surely to be recorded in the annals of <HI>America</HI> for the honor of the reli∣gious, christian <HI>Presbyterians.</HI></P>
<P>Their Loyalty was equally conspicuous in bidding defiance to the pro∣clamations of his Honor; trampling upon the just and righteous Laws of their Country; and holding a Treaty with his Majesty's Representative as if they were Foreigners at war with <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> What a Nose of wax the word Loyalty has been made to serve the vile purposes of all the insurrections that have been rais'd against the Sovereign, is well known to those, who are the least acquainted with History? The Rebels in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> in 1641, call'd themselves loyal subjects to <HI>King Charles.</HI> And the <HI>Scotch</HI> Rebels, when they march'd an army to destroy the king, not only warmly profess'd, but swore to be loyal to him and his hens in their infa∣mous covenant.—Oh! but crys the Gentleman, they did no body any harm. No thanks to them for that For had they gone to rob and plun∣der the country, the whole Province wou'd have bravely hunted them down like wolves, Besides it was politic in them to behave discreetly to the Inhabitants. When the Pretender march'd into <HI>England</HI> the last Re∣bellion, his Adherents behav'd as discreetly as the <HI>Paxton Boys,</HI> yet this did not save the Leaders of them from the ax and the halter.</P>
<P>I can't comprehend how our Author shou'd know that <HI>Squaws</HI> have charms, had they not made some deep impressions on his own heart. For Love <HI>Solomon</HI> says, is stronger than Death. Possibly however the jealousy of being rivall'd may have been the cause of the late distaste he and his brethren have conceiv'd for these poor females; it so, I can assure them, they may with all the freedom in the world repair to the Barracks, and brighten their former acquaintance, as all transgressions of this kind are easily wash'd away by standing in the <HI>Kirk.</HI></P>
<P>I would seriously ask this great Writer, or any of his Advocates, what cou'd a sett of men do more in the Assembly for protecting this Province, than the people call'd <HI>Quakers</HI> have done▪ It can be undeniably prov'd that more money has been rais'd in this Province for carrying on the war, than any other in <HI>America.</HI> It can also be prov'd that the necessity of raising money was never disputed, but the mode of taxation: Had our Re∣presentatives given up this inherent right of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> they wou'd have betray'd the trust repos'd in them by their Constituents, and deserv'd the censure of the very <HI>Paxton Boys</HI> themselves. Besides their peculiar tenets in religion as is alledg'd, have no influence on their actions relative to Government. For <HI>Quakers</HI> are no more answerable for the bad con∣sequences charg'd upon their doctrines by the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> when they do not affect their conduct) than <HI>Presbyterians</HI> are chargeable with all the ab∣surdities of <HI>Absolute Decrees.</HI></P>
<P>Shou'd not a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> be as passive as a <HI>Quaker</HI> according to his own principles; for certainly if God fore-ordains whatever comes to pass, he can no more alter the irresistable decree, than he can overturn the world; consequently all resistance against an enemy is vain, because we
<PB N="12" REF="009703_0010_0F7A44FFC4F6EF60"/>
then fight against the will of God, and resist the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> which is an abominable crime.</P>
<P>Our Author makes a tedious Harrangue about the <HI>Quakers</HI> for once taking up arms to defend themselves, when the city appear'd to be in the utmost danger of massacre, Plunder and desolation, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a total overthrow of the very being of our constitution. This is a similar case to that at the Revolution. No one precept in the Gospel is more power∣fully enforc'd than obedience to the King; absolute necessity, however, for once compell'd the <HI>English Nation,</HI> at the Revolution, to dispense with this positive command. Now will our Author be so hardy as to ask,
<Q>if these are the people, who always profess obedience to the King according to a divine command;" and then conclude; "what amazing hypocrisy appears in their profession." "They must either confess that they have hitherto resisted the blessed Gospel, or that the <HI>Holy Spi∣rit</HI> has given them a new Gospel contradictory to the old one; but this is to blaspheme God, and belie the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> yet such is their con∣duct.</Q>
This is the force of his Argument when applied to the Revo∣lution; and any one wou'd certainly conclude that our Author by his manner of reasoning was a <HI>Nonjuror:</HI> And indeed I am apt to believe there is something in it; for I never heard that <HI>Presbyterian Ministers</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> country were oblig'd to take the Oaths to the Government, or give any other test of their fidelity to the King. Whoever heard a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Sermon upon the duty of submission to the present establishment? Are not the Covenanters preaching against his Majesty every day, and all by the direction of the Spirit? Four different sorts of <HI>Presbyterians</HI> have all in the name of the <HI>Blessed Spirit</HI> damn'd each other in <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> Must not each party have belied the <HI>Blessed Spirit,</HI> in anouncing contradic∣tory and blasphemous Anathemas in his name? But to conclude. Beware, my Countrymen, of men who wou'd cram Laws down your throats with muskets, daggers, tomahawks and scalping-knives. Give me leave to recommend to you a spirit of watchfulness and jealousy. The Inhabitants of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> enjoy the most extensive privileges both ci∣vil and religious of any people in the world. Let us then, like true <HI>Britons,</HI> warmly oppose any that wou'd presume to deprive us of them! Let us boldly contend for the cause of Liberty and our Country, and never be pusillanimous or supine▪ when we see men of bad principles at work behind the curtain, to wrest them out of our hands! Let us as we value every thing that is dear and sacred to us, endeavour to suppress the present prevailing faction! And finally, let us exert all our influence and power to keep the Reigns of Government out of the hands of <HI>Presbyterians</HI> (which can be done no other way than by placing ourselves under the protection of our gracious and royal Master, <HI>King George</HI> the third of blessed me∣mory) as we are convinc'd, thoroughly convinc'd, of their unfitness to govern both by experience and undeniable instances from History!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Countrymen and Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE time is now come that we must either submit our necks to the yoke of <HI>Presbyterian</HI> bondage, or exert ourselves with a true <HI>British Spirit</HI> in behalf of our <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country.</HI> For was it ever known in any part of the world, that such as appear'd in defence of a <HI>Government,</HI> shou'd be treated with contempt, and look'd upon as ene∣mies to it; and that others cou'd recommend themselves by boldly flying in its face and trampling upon its authority. But such is the profound, wise policy of some of our <HI>State Physicians,</HI> who have been at work be∣hind the scenes to encourage one part of the inhabitants to rise up in arms, and attempt to draw blood of the rest; tho' happy for us, they are too rampant, and not easily rid out of their liberties.</P>
<P>The veil of hypocrisy was too thin, and is now plainly seen thro' by the good inhabitants of this province, who heartily and sincerely pity the poor despicable wretches that were made <HI>Dupes</HI> of upon this occasion to serve the turn of those shallow pated <HI>Statesmen,</HI> who cun∣ger up storms and tempests to cast away the ship that they may (like
<PB N="14" REF="009703_0012_0F7A450130ECBC08"/>
the moon-cursers of <HI>Cornwal</HI>) murder the crew, and run away with the plunder.</P>
<P>As I am an <HI>American</HI> born, and have neither place nor pension under the G—t, I earnestly hope my dear countrymen will look upon my weak endeavours to serve them, free from prejudice and partiality, and as the overflowings of a heart truly touch'd with a deep sense of their misfortunes, and sympathizing with them under their present unhappy calamity.</P>
<P>Must it not rouse the indignation of every patriot breast in P—a to see so many hireling pens prostituted to support arbitrary measures; when if they were equally employ'd in vindicating the rights and li∣berties of the people; in exposing wicked ministers of state, those sons of corruption, who are preparing the minds of mankind for sla∣very and bondage, they might do honor to themselves, die without a guilty conscience staring them in the face, and their memory (instead of rotting) wou'd be gratefully rever'd by posterity?</P>
<P>As my principal design is to examine the merit of <HI>Presbyterians</HI> for government, without troubling myself much about pamphlets, that have, or may be written in defence of the <HI>P—r</HI> and his <HI>Tools</HI> in Opposition to the <HI>Freemen</HI> of this Province; nevertheless I look upon it as a Duty incumbent on me just to give a <HI>Key</HI> to one of them, call'd the "Conduct of the Paxton Men impartially represented."</P>
<P>This Sixpenny Piece consists of thirty three Pages, twenty of which the Author has borrow'd in Order to swell the Performance, other∣wise I apprehend the thirteen pages of his own dry Reflections wou'd have been sold for two Coppers, by which Means the mercenary Views of both Author and Printer wou'd have been entirely disappointed.— Such are the cunning Schemes projected amidst the Scarcity of Cash that now prevails, by these pamphleteering Gentlemen, in Order to make the Public pay for what they were in Possession of before. The Inju∣ry he has done to the back Inhabitants by misrepresenting their <HI>Mani∣festo,</HI> can scarce ever be forgiven him, for in transcribing this <HI>Remons∣trance</HI> of Grievances, he has artfully substituted the Word, "<HI>Quakers,</HI> for <HI>P—r,</HI> in order I apprehend to throw the blame upon them and their Assembly. If the Reader however in the Perusal of the Pamphlet, will bear this in his Mind, and as he goes along, when he meets with words. <HI>Tyrant, Traytor, Rebel,</HI> &amp;c. Apply the first to a certain Ruler not much esteem'd, and the two last to the <HI>Paxton Men,</HI> and <HI>Presbyterians!</HI> These with a few more of the like Emendations, may make it tolerable Sense and what is more give it some Color of Truth.</P>
<P>Our Author commends the <HI>Representatives</HI> of the Freemen of <HI>Rome,</HI> for murdering <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> in the State House, because he had tyranni∣cally depriv'd them of their Liberty, and reduc'd them to a State of Vassalage and Slavery.—I believe his Employers have more Under∣standing than to thank him for this Instance of his Zeal, as it militates so strongly against the Cause for which it was produc'd, and sets such an Example to the Senators of P—,a as I am confident they wou'd by
<PB N="15" REF="009703_0013_0F7A4502488F8358"/>
no Means imitate. Thus I might run a Parallel thro' all his Instances from Prophane History, to shew that every Example he has adduc'd is in Favor of the People and their Representatives. He has taken a Deal of Pains to shew the Similarity between <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Presbyterians</HI> (but this was a needless Undertaking, as every Body knew it before). He has also endeavor'd to make it appear that all other <HI>Professions</HI> intermix'd among them, are the <HI>Heathens</HI> with whom they have to contend. That if there∣fore <HI>Force</HI> will not do, <HI>Fraud</HI> may be made use of to destroy their Op∣posers, by Craft, Treachery, or Dissimulation.—He wou'd feign make us believe too that as God formerly gave the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> by a Charter from Heaven to the Jews; so he has given <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> by Virtue of the same Commission, <HI>Judith,</HI> cries our Author, tells a Lye to <HI>Holofernus,</HI> makes him drunk, and then severs his Head from his Body with a Scymitar,—so ought all the Sons and Daughters of <HI>Presbyterianism,</HI> serve those of a different Persuasion who do not coincide with them in Religion and Politics, smite them under the fifth Rib as <HI>Joab</HI> did <HI>Abner,</HI> and betray them with a Kiss into the Hands of their Enemies, as <HI>Judas</HI> did our <HI>blessed Savior.</HI> Might I not as well quote this Passage of the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> and apply it with equal Propriety to the late Expedition to <HI>German-town? Holofernus</HI> (i. e. Col—A.-m-s-g) was the chief Captain of the Army of the Paxton Volunteers, who had formerly march'd West and secur'd himself behind a Tree; till his Forces vanquish'd the <HI>Catananites;</HI> after which, in the Name of the Hosts of <HI>Israel,</HI> he fired at a Bundle of Deer-Skins which fell before him; for which gallant and brave Exploit he was crown'd with Laurels: He then ruin'd his Sword against <HI>Judah</HI> to the Eastward, and said I will go forth in my Wrath and devour mine Enemies, and straitly block up the Capitol.—Now had there been a Woman in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as bold as <HI>Judith,</HI> and us'd the same Means to destroy this <HI>Holofernus</HI> in <HI>Ger∣mantown,</HI> wou'd she not be equally entitled to the Blessings pronounc'd by <HI>Ozias,</HI> that Judith was, according to the curious Application our ju∣dicious Author has made to this Text?</P>
<P>What a shocking Opinion must Mankind have of <HI>Presbyterians</HI> who first kill People, and then erect Courts of <HI>Judicature</HI> to try them? Our Author has been at great Pains to take ex Parte Depositions, and pub∣lish them to the World as sufficient Proof of the <HI>Indians</HI> Guilt. There∣fore whether they were innocent or guilty is little to the Purpose now, as their Doom is irreversable. Will the Verdict of the Public restore them to Life, suppose it is given in their Favor. These Allegations were suf∣ficient, if true, to confine them by Virtue of the civil Authority in or∣der to bring them to a legal Tryal, that they might either be acquitted or condemn'd by their Country.—But who, under the Heavens, gave Presbyterians Authority to be their own Carvers, or appointed them Judges, Jurors, Hangmen, and Executioners, to butcher the <HI>Indians,</HI> Man, Woman and Child in cold Blood, without first examining either their Merit, or Demerit, or giving them any Chance to plead for them∣selves?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009703_0014_0F7A4504F305D038"/>The <HI>Presbyterians</HI> want more Members from the back Counties to re∣present them, and have added this to the Catalogue of their Grievances upon the Frontiers. Now suppose it was granted, I believe it wou'd make very little Alteration for the better, as that County has seldom sent a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> to represent them, (one qualified being very rarely to be found,) and but a-few from the others; and even some of those that are sent, appear as warm for the Liberties of their Country as any of their Brother Members. Are not the Gentlemen in general who represent the five back Counties, I wou'd seriously ask this Gentleman, as unani∣mous in their Votes against the P—r as any of the Members who repre∣sent the interior Parts of the <HI>Province?</HI> And are not they the best Judges from what Fountain the Grievances of their Constituents flow? Had they protested against the Resolves of the <HI>House,</HI> publish'd their Reasons, and shewn that they were out number'd by a <HI>Quaker Majority;</HI> there wou'd have been some color of Argument for making such a Clamor about more Members. But no such Thing. These Gentlemen know the odds be∣tween sixpence and a Shilling, as well as other People, and think it no Deed of Charity to pay the P—r's Taxes, whose Estate is said to be worth, at a moderate Computation, ten Millions Sterling.</P>
<P>It is said that all Means are to be us'd between this, and next Election to unite the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> as one Man to chuse such Persons for Assemblymen who (upon certain Conditions) will grant any Thing the P—s demand. This Plot may be conceited by some-time serving Hirelings of that Party, but I cannot suffer myself to believe the Majority of the landed Men among them who, by the bye, love Money as well as their Neighbours, and are no <HI>Creatures</HI> to the <HI>G—t</HI> wou'd ever submit to such a servile Yoke—If any Thing induces them it must be their close Attachment to their peculiar Tenets in Religion; the artful Persuasions of their Teachers; and the com∣fortable hopes of an Establishment in <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> And if these Mo∣tives prevail what may we expect to be the Consequences? Why—</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> a Bill exempting the Proprietaries from all Taxes forever,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> A Bill settling an Annuity upon <HI>Deputy Governors</HI> for the Time being of one Thousand per Annum or more. In lieu of which the <HI>Pres∣byterians</HI> shall have.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> A Bill for establishing <HI>Synods, Presbyteries,</HI> and <HI>Kirk Sessions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> A Bill rating every Taxable of whatever Denomination to∣wards the supporting <HI>Presbyterian Ministers</HI> and their poor Widows.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> A Bill obliging every Body to attend <HI>Presbyterian Mettings,</HI> under Pain of Corporal Punishment for the first Offence, and Hanging for the second.</P>
<P>For the first Offence five Pounds to the <HI>Minister,</HI> and for the second Offence Excommunication from the Conversation of all Man kind, and to be given over to <HI>Satan</HI> to be buffered, till absolv'd by the <HI>Kirk.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Knox's</HI> Leturgy.</NOTE> such, my dear Countrymen, wou'd be the Effects of a <HI>Presbyterian Assembly,</HI> when properly tutor'd by the Government and their Preachers. The <HI>Presbyterian Policy</HI> therefore pursued with indefatigable Zeal, in this,
<PB N="17" REF="009703_0015_0F7A4506401AE6B8"/>
and the Neighboring <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>New-Jersey</HI> ought to awaken the Atten∣tion of every true Lover of his Country, and rouse all other Persuasions, to unite as one Man against them, being the most formidable and dangerous Enemies we have to cope with.</P>
<P>Let us next examine into the Charity of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> so much boast∣ed of, I will not say to other Societies; for that was never heard of; but even to their own distressed Brethren on the Frontiers.</P>
<P>I believe it will be as hard a Task to prove, that ever they, (consider'd as a Society) rais'd a <HI>general Contribution,</HI> of <HI>their own Money,</HI> for the Relief of the <HI>back Inhabitants,</HI> as it is to prove, that <HI>Quakers</HI> did so; and I think the most difficult Work of the two. Here I suppose some of their passionate Teachers will be ready to fly in my Face, and ask me, with an angry Tone,
<Q>if we did not give away Hundreds both at <HI>Lancaster Trea∣ty,</HI> and afterwards, when every Body was raising Men for them, <HI>ex∣cept Quakers.</HI></Q>
I readily own it. But the next Question is, pray Gen∣tlemen, whose money were you so liberal of? Was it your own, or the cha∣ritable contributions of the <HI>Good People of England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> put into your Hands for that Use?—If it was your own, then you have these charitable Donations still in your Pockets, to supply the Sums you have advanced, and pay you for your Disbursments. And if it was not your own, but the Money rais'd in <HI>England,</HI> that you and your Brethren pa∣raded away upon at <HI>Lancaster.</HI> and since made such a Noise about your Cha∣rity to the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> on the Frontiers, as I am apt to believe it was? why in the Name of Sense do you assume the <HI>Merit</HI> of it to yourselves, as if you were the only charitable, humane People in the Province.—Either you must candidly confess that this is the true State of the Case, or you have impos'd upon the generous People of <HI>Europe</HI> with false Notions.</P>
<P>As many of my Readers, (who are not of their Profession) may be un∣acquainted with this Piece of <HI>Presbyterian</HI> craft, I shall unravel the whole Mystery of their iniquitous Scheme, contriv'd in their most sacred As∣semblies, by the best and ablest of their Divines and Lay-Elders.</P>
<P>A few Years ago the Heads of this Society petition'd the <HI>Governor</HI> of this <HI>Province</HI> for a Charter to incorporate a certain Number of themselves, to raise Money for the Use of <HI>poor, distressed Presbyterian Ministers and their Widows;</HI> their Petition being granted with certain Powers and Limitations, the next Consideration was how to procured Fund. One of their own Members who had been a <HI>Pedlar,</HI> and consequently well qualified for such an undertaking, offer'd his Service. Having had his Education under Mr. T—<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who was a Master Workman at begging, ha was universally approv'd of as one of their ablest Disemblers, fitted out with proper Cre∣dentials, and sent abroad. At a secret <HI>Committee</HI> of this Corporation it was agreed on, that, as collecting Money for a <HI>Widows Fund,</HI> might prove but a dry subject to declaim on in <HI>Europe,</HI> their Delegate shou'd have a set of private Instructions directing him, that upon his Arrival, he shou'd make no Mention of the <HI>Widow's Fund,</HI> but get a Brief drawn up, setting forth the Miseries and Distresses of the <HI>back Inhabitants</HI> of <HI>Penn∣sylvania;</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="009703_0016_0F7A45068EDD0208"/>
the vast Numbers of Christian Captives doom'd to perpetual Slave∣ry, together with the absolute Necessity of contributing Money for their Re∣demption. This was undoubtedly a crafty Scheme. For as the <HI>English</HI> had often contributed Money for the Redemption of <HI>Christian Captives in</HI> Africa, large Sums were generously given for these pious Uses; at which liberal Donations we need not be surpriz'd, if we can credit the <HI>Presby∣terians</HI> themselves, who say, "that this very Deputy of theirs carried Home with him a Parcel of Squirrel Scalps▪ and when he had in <HI>Ireland,</HI> work'd up the Passions of his Audience by dismal and melancholly Relations of murder'd <HI>Ministers</HI> in the back Woods to a proper Degree of Fer∣mentation; produc'd these as Proofs, declaring they were the Skins of their Heads that were barbarously and cruelly torn off by the wild <HI>Indians.</HI> In Consequence, I say, of this mournful Detail, the People were extreamly charitable; never once dreaming that three fourths of their Donations wou'd never be applied to the Uses for which they were given.—How∣ever when the Cheat was discover'd innocently in <HI>England</HI> by one who was their very good Friend, but not in the Plot, the Pedlar slipt off, and left the best Part of his Pack behind him, which was detain'd, till proper Assurances were given from this Side the Water, that it shou'd not all be misapplied.—.To save Appearances then, an Address was presented to Governor <HI>H</HI>—<HI>n</HI> from a Deputation of this <HI>Presbyterian Corporation</HI> setting forth their Desire to advance a Sum of Money for the Re∣demption of Captives, a Copy of which, with his Honor's Answer was sent to <HI>England</HI> to justify the Pedlar's Brief, and confute the sup∣posed Aspersions of a certain Gentleman, however notwithstanding all this, as Truth will generally prevail he justify'd himself, by de∣tecting their Falshoods, Malice and Knavery in a written Vindication, Sign'd by one of the P—rs, and <HI>Dr, Chandler,</HI> (the Head of the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>England</HI>) and transmitted it over here, by way of a <HI>Looking-Glass</HI> for them to see themselves in; but they appear'd so ex∣ceedingly ugly and deform'd they were asham'd to shew this <HI>Glass</HI> even to some of their own Brethren.</P>
<P>This <HI>Address</HI> and <HI>Answer</HI> were look'd upon by People of other De∣nominations in this <HI>Province,</HI> as a severe Reflection cast upon them; as if <HI>Presbyterians</HI> were the only People here, who had the Redemp∣tion of these poor Slaves at Heart; whereas it is well known that the large Presents made to the Indians by the Government in order to bring about a Pacification and Return of Prisoners were rais'd by an equal Assesment upon every Denomination.— After all; how fraudulent was it to collect Money for one Use, and then apply it to another. This Crime I apprehend is equal in Guilt to many made Capital in <HI>England:</HI> If so, what then did our Orator deserve who wickedly defrauded the Public, or what did those men deserve, who advis'd him to that base and unrighteous Mea∣sure? How wicked and ungenerous was it for them to deceive their Be∣nefactors by false Representations, and after they had obtain'd the Cash, to pocket three fourths of it for their own Use, and the remainder give a∣way
<PB N="19" REF="009703_0017_0F7A45072F6ACB40"/>
way at a <HI>Public Treaty</HI> for charitable Purposes <HI>as their own?</HI>—They took particular Care never to inform his <HI>Honor,</HI> or the Public, in their Ad∣dress that they had receiv'd a Sum of Money from <HI>England</HI> to redeem their poor Countrymen in Bondage—no; this would be to act out of Character; for it must be all a deceitful, blind Piece of Deception from Begining to End.</P>
<P>When we seriously consider the <HI>Kind</HI> of an <HI>Establishment Presbyterians</HI> have obtain'd in the <HI>Midland Provinces of North America</HI> by Virtue of this <HI>Charter,</HI> and the particular Favors done for them by <HI>Governor Belcher</HI> in the <HI>Jersey;</HI> who procur'd them an exclusive <HI>Charter</HI> from the Crown for the Management of their College to the Detriment of all other Professions (for which Favors they are now gratefully paying his <HI>Majesty</HI> in <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> we ought all to be alarm'd, and try to stem the Torrent of <HI>Presbyterianism,</HI> which is pouring down upon us from the North Pole, and if not timely prevented, will, with more than <HI>vandalic Barbarity,</HI> bury us, our Religion and Liberties, in one general Inundation.</P>
<P><HI>Prince-Town</HI> was chosen for the Seat of their College, because it was situated in such a manner that no Place of <HI>Worship</HI> was within many Miles of it, by which means, the Students wou'd be oblig'd to attend <HI>Presbyterian Preaching.</HI> This was an Artifice to erect <HI>Presbyte∣rianism</HI> on the Ruins of all other Societies, and to instill their Mode of Worship, and Principles of Calvinism into the tender Minds of the Youth, who by the Time, they had taken their Degrees, wou'd either be Converts to <HI>Presbyterianism,</HI> or at least go away with favor∣able Ideas of it.—It is well known that there is little or no Peace at this Seminary for the Students who retain their Integrity, and do not swallow all the wild, indigested Fumes of Enthusiasm taught by the <HI>New-Lights</HI> and their <HI>Followers.</HI> The Severity of their Discip∣line has been carried so far very lately as to prohibit all Conversation between what they call the converted and unconverted (how fair soever their moral Character might be) till this holy Inquisition had set a Seal upon their Foreheads, as a Mark of their being absolutely elected; and by which Means they might be known to all the sancti∣fied Children of true <HI>Presbyterianism.</HI></P>
<P>The College in this City plan'd upon the Principles of Moderation and Liberty, and intended for the Use and Benefit of every Denomi∣nation is now got into the Hands of a <HI>Presbyterian Faction.</HI> The Professors and Tutors being generally chosen of that Persuasion, lord it with such a high Hand over other Professions, that they are not contented with using their Power to keep all others out; but are in∣defatigable in planing to thrust those out who differ from them that are in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> by charitable Contributions has rais'd six thousand Pounds Sterling for the Use of this Seminary, and to buy Bread for those who wou'd not let one of her Sons enjoy a Shilling of it if the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> means prevent it. The Baptists have receiv'd
<PB N="20" REF="009703_0018_0F7A4507EF396AA0"/>
no better Quarters from this College than the Church, and are drove to the Necessity of building one at <HI>Rhode-Island.</HI> The Number of Students greatly decrease, not caring to stay where there is so much Partiality shewn in Favor of a particular Society and generally return Home with their Heads stuff'd full of Vulgar Phrases, instead of that native Purity of their Mother Tongue they brought with them. The Honors of the Institution are so indiscriminately conferr'd in Fa∣vor of <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and with so little Discernment, that Leather-Bri∣tches Makers, and Gentlemen are put upon the same Level. Such is the present Situation of our College, which might have been at this Day an Ornament to the Province, had it been carried on upon the Principles of Moderation, and Catholicism as was originally intended.</P>
<P>The Eligance and Politeness of these <HI>Presbyterian Divines,</HI> who set themselves up for Professors of Colleges will be handed down to Poste∣rity to their immortal Infamy, in the two stupid Addresses they pre∣sented to <HI>Governor F—n</HI> and <HI>Governor P—n.</HI> That they understand a little Latin and Greek I will not dispute, and perhaps may be some∣thing acquainted with the logical, pedantic Rules of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> Anti Arminian, or <HI>Calvinistic Metaphysics,</HI> and some other Mystical Rhap∣sodies; but that they understand Dignity of Style, Propriety and Ele¦gance of Expression, let these two Addresses declare. The <HI>Plain Dealer</HI> tells us his▪
<Q>Majesty will judge of Quaker and Presbyterian Loyalty; ac∣cording to the <HI>substantial</HI> Proofs that each gives of it in Time of Danger.</Q>
Half a Million of Money given to defend the Govern∣ment, is certainly one <HI>substantial</HI> Proof of Quaker Loyalty; and what is a farther and stronger Confirmation of it, is, that they are heartily willing, and extreamly anxious that his Majesty shou'd take them under his immediate Protection and Government. They are not a∣fraid of loosing their Charter; of being saddled with heavier Taxes; or paying Tythes to the Church Clergy, as this whiffling Politician <HI>squints</HI> at in one of his Observations.</P>
<P>Let us next consider what are the <HI>substantial</HI> Proofs of Presbyterian Loyalty. And here I will put the Public in Possession of a <HI>circular Apostolical</HI> Letter wrote by the Presbyterian Pope in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and his two <HI>Cardinals,</HI> to all the inferior Brethren and their Flocks through∣out the Province, in order to deter them from becoming immediate Subjects of <HI>King George.</HI></P>

<P>Our general Assembly having adjourn'd for a short Time to con∣sult their Constituents whether an humble Address shou'd be drawn up and transmitted to his Majesty, praying that he wou'd be pleas'd to take this Province under his immediate Protection and Government; that
<PB N="21" REF="009703_0019_0F7A4508AD2C6078"/>
is; whether the Freemen of this Province shou'd Petition the King, that we may be <HI>reduc'd to the Form of a King's Government.</HI></P>
<P>The Presbyterians here, upon mature Deliberation, are of opinion, that it is is not <HI>safe</HI> to do Things of such Importance rashly; Our Privileges by these means may be greatly <HI>abridged,</HI> but will never be <HI>enlarged.</HI></P>
<P>We are under the Kings Protection and Government now as much as we can be, for he will never govern us in Person, and it is of no great <HI>Consequence</HI> whether his Deputy be recommended by the Proprietaries, or by some other great Men to his Majesty.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Charter</HI> is in <HI>Danger</HI> by such a <HI>Change,</HI> and let no Man per∣suade you to the contrary. There has been a half yearly Meeting of the Quakers in this City, but this Change of Government has not been propos'd in their Meeting, as we can yet understand, nor is it approv'd of by the Heads of that Society.</P>
<P>This Affair is in all Probability, a <HI>Trap</HI> laid to ensnare the unwary, and then to cast an Odium on the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> for ruining or attempt∣ing to ruin the Province. The Frontier Counties are now suing for a Redress of Grievances, and we have the greatest Reason to believe that it is no more than an artful Scheme to <HI>divide</HI> or <HI>divert</HI> the Attention of the injur'd Frontier Inhabitants from prosecuting their Petitions, which very much alarm them. For these Reasons we wou'd earnestly recom∣mend it to you to lose no Time in advising all under your Influence, whether of our Denomination or others, from signing any such Pe∣tition—</P>

<P>By this Letter his <HI>Majesty</HI> and the Public may plainly see what sort of Loyal Subjects <HI>Presbyterians</HI> are to him in this Government, who think it the greatest Curse that can befal them, to be <HI>reduc'd to the Form of a King's Government:</HI> Their Quarrel is not with a bad King, more than a good one; but their Abhorrence is to the very <HI>Form,</HI> which they utterly detest, as inconsistent with their <HI>Westminster platform,</HI> and a perpetual Check to the Rigor of their Discipline. The general Cry of <HI>modern Presbyterians,</HI> is to glory in the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and their firm Attachment to the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Hanover;</HI> to lay all the Blame of former Rebellions at the Door of the <HI>Covenanters,</HI> and the Oppressions of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>STEWART.</HI>—What kind of Affection they have for King <HI>George</HI> is evident in this Letter, by which they are sowing the Seeds of Disloyalty among the good People of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI>—This however is quite agreeable to the Tenor of their Conduct under King <HI>William.</HI></P>

that if it were not for the great Army he had with him he durst not have said so to them," And however, it wou'd have been wiser in him to have held his Peace, for they own'd no Master but <HI>Christ."</HI> One of them in a Sermon "declar'd, that <HI>King William</HI> design'd to dethrone. <HI>King Jesus."</HI> And the Moderator of the General Assembly imme∣diately after it's Dissolution, reflected upon <HI>King William,</HI> as sent in Wrath to be a Curse to <HI>God's Kirk.</HI>—Another of their Preachers tells us that they brought in a Dog, (<HI>i. e.</HI> K. Wm.) for Gods Sake, and that he now began to bite the Bairnes <HI>i. e.</HI> the Children.—One Mr. <HI>Kennedy</HI> in the same Reign, before the General Assembly in which he was Moderator said in his Prayer, "Lord! Moderation is recom∣mended to us by the King, and we all know that it is a Virtue that is sometimes useful, Lord; but I cannot say that which he calls Mode∣ration now, is so convenient at this Time for thy People and Cause; for even to be free with thee, good Lord, I think it is best to make a clear House, by sweeping them out all at the Door, and casting them out to the Midden [Dunghill] <HI>i. e.</HI> other Professions.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Borlands in Gallowshields pray'd thus,
<Q>O God! Thou hast bid∣den us pray for Kings, and yet they have been always very trouble∣some to thy <HI>Kirk;</HI> they say that this new King thou hast sent us, viz. King William takes the Sacrament from the Hands of a Bishop kneel∣ing; ah!</Q>
That's black Work, that's foul Work. Lord deliver him from Popery, and Prelacy; from a <HI>Dutch</HI> Conscience; and the Hard∣heartedness of the <HI>Stewarts.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears that nor only Covenanters, but the whole Body of Presbyterians are actuated by the same rebellious Principles since the <HI>Revo∣lution,</HI> they were before; and that not even the Establishment of their Profession in <HI>Scotland</HI> can make them in Love with <HI>Monarchy.</HI> Is not the Language of these Quotations from their Moderators and principal Divines, exactly of a Piece with this treacherous Jesuitical Presbyte∣rian <HI>Bull</HI> sent forth from the College of Philadelphia? Are these fit Men to have the Tuition of His Majesty's Protestant Subjects? To instill in∣to the Youth an evil Idea of <HI>Royal Government;</HI> to instruct them, that a covetous, mercenary, avaritious, tyrannical hard-hearted land-Lord, who is for laying heavy Burdens on his Tenents, and will not touch them with one of his Fingers is to be preferr'd to our most <HI>gracious So∣vereign;</HI> that his <HI>Majesty</HI> will ABRIDGE us of our Privileges, but we may be assur'd he never will ENLARGE them, or grant us any Favor; and lastly, that the Province may expect nothing but Ruin, Destruction and Desolation, the Moment we put ourselves under <HI>King George the Third.</HI>—Cou'd a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> cou'd a <HI>Spaniard</HI> entertain a worse Opi∣nion of the glorious Constitution of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> Yet these are the Men, who wou'd scarce have a Mouthful of Bread to support themselves or their Families, had it not been for his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Royal Bounty and Favor, in promoting a generous Collection by his own good Example; I say, these are the Men, who maliciously asperse his Crown and Dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="009703_0021_0F7A450A3AF77198"/>However some particular Friends have suffer'd themselves to be distrain'd upon, rather than pay Taxes towards carrying on the War, yet they have been always passive without the least murmuring. The Number that en∣tertain these conscientious Scruples is but small, the Majority of that good People having always contributed their <HI>Quota</HI> as chearfully as any other Society. How therefore <HI>Presbyterians</HI> or those who write in their behalf, can have the Assurance to cast this in their Teeth, above all other People (when they know that they have carried this Point further than any <HI>Quakers</HI> ever did in the World) is a Piece of Effrontery that can only be fitted to their own Foreheads.</P>
<P>In a Book call'd the <HI>Hind let loose</HI> which is almost as sacred among them as the Confession of Faith, Page 701, I find this Declaration.
<Q>The exacting Taxations for maintaining the Army, and the paying of Subsidies, was, and remains to be a consuming crimson wick∣edness, the cry whereof reaches to Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>In the same Author, Page 912, I find Words to this Purport,
<Q>The paying of Subsidies to the present Government, is to furnish that Party of the Dragon's Legions, in their War against Michael with Sup∣plies, which no Body can excuse no more than sheding the Blood of their innocent Children to Molach.</Q>
—Now did ever any Quaker make use of such vile Language against the Government? Did ever a Quaker reckon the granting of Supplies for the King's Use as crying a Sin as the sacrificing innocent Children to the Devil?</P>
<P>I appeal to the impartial Part of the Presbyterians themselves, if they think, that our Representatives can have any Thing else in View but the Good of their Country, in the Struggle they make in Behalf of the Liberties of the Province,—I have often heard that Parliament Men have been blam'd and censur'd for selling themselves and their Country, to wicked Ministers of State, for a Bribe, Place or Pension, but never for opposing illegal Taxes; arbitrary Power; or Ministerial Corruption.—The ever memorable <HI>Hambden</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Charles the</HI> 1st, rather than pay an illegal Tax of 30 S. (a much less Sum than 110 pounds demanded by the <HI>P—r</HI> according to his own Calculation) went to Jail; by which noble stand the Liberties of <HI>England</HI> were in a great Measure preserv'd. Must it not be an everlasting Blot in the Charac∣ter of the Presbyterians, that they are the only People in <HI>P—a,</HI> a∣mong all the Nations, Sects and Professions settled in it, that will as∣sist a <HI>T—l</HI> Landlord to distress and oppress his Tenants;—a Land lord, who cannot be contented wirh his Legal Dues, but wants the Peo∣ple to pay his Taxes for him into the Bargain, and if he cannot persuade them to pay the whole, wou'd rather (like Murtah O Lavery) take the one Third of a farthing, than go away with nothing at all.</P>

<P>MR. J—n E—g being chosen Moderator, the Meeting was open'd by him with a Prayer to the following Effect.</P>
<P>L—d thou knowest the end of our Meeting as well as we can tell thee, that it is to settle the Election; not the Election of Grace, but of Members of Assembly for this Province! O! Do thou confound these cursed Quakers, that are endeavoring to bring us under a Kingly Yoke, which thou knowest that neither we nor our Fathers ever cou'd bear! Do thou turn the Hearts of the ignorant Dutch from <HI>King George</HI> to serve the P—r in such a manner as will enable us to establish our Religion upon the Necks of both! Confound our Enemies the <HI>Assembly</HI> and all their Ad∣herents▪ who are Lovers of <HI>Monarchy</HI> and Abhorrers of <HI>Presbyterianism!</HI> Pour down in a particular manner thy Judgments upon F—n and G—y, and let the thunderbolts of thy Vengeance sink them down to the lower regions! Enable us thy Servants at this Time so to settle Matters that <HI>Pres∣byterianism</HI> may be establish'd among us, and all other Professions crum∣ble before it! Let the King's Name become odious and stink in the Nos∣trils of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and let them join heartily with us thy Servants in turning out the present Members of <HI>Assembly,</HI> and in putting in such Men as shall be subservient to all our present and future Views for the Good of thy <HI>Kirk! Amen!</HI></P>

<HEAD>After which Prayer he opened the Council with the following Speech.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Brethren!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Business we are now met upon demands our most serious Consi¦deration. It is of no less importance than the establishing of our most holy Religion in this Province; for the Accomplishment of which you know all means, whether justifiable or unjustifiable, are to be us'd, seeing the End is so valuable. Our late Behaviour in killing the Savages in in this Place; marching to <HI>Germantown;</HI> and intimidating the <HI>Assembly,</HI> hath so far recommended our Society to the G—t that all the Places of Trust are to be thrown into our Hands, especially the Commissions of the Peace. And as you know the New Lights and old Lights who were formerly Justices, gave Judgment against the Followers of each other, according as the Plaintiff or Defendant was of a Party, and not agreeable to the Merits of the Cause, for which four or five of them were turn'd out, through the interest of a certain eminent and sensible Courtier; so now as we are all one People again, our Elders who will generally be made Jus∣tices, will have it in their Power to be revenged upon all the Enemies of <HI>Presbyterianism.</HI> This is the first Advantage we shall reap from our firm
<PB N="29" REF="009703_0024_0F7A450C6E5C7FF0"/>
Attachment to the P—<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, especially if we can carry our point at the en∣suing Election.</P>
<P>The second Advantage is we shall have an A—y G—l of our own per∣suasion; for it it said the Personage that holds it now, and who has go∣vern'd our G—s this ten Years is to resign for that Purpose.</P>
<P>The third is of greater Consequence still and that is, the passing se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> Laws in Favour of <HI>Presbytertanism;</HI> this, be assured, my Friends, is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>ated in our Favour upon the following Conditions's First, that the P—s Lands be exempted from Taxes forever; and what is Six or Seven Hundred a Year, especially when not above one fourth of it will be taken from us <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> as the Burden will fall equally upon other Societies; and we shall reap all the Profit? Secondly, that an Annuity of 1000 <HI>per Annum</HI> be settled upon all our succeeding G—s; for which Favors we shall have in return.—</P>
<P N="1">1st. A Law establishing our <HI>Kirk</HI> by Sessions, Presbytaries and Synods, with all the Appendages of <HI>Presbyterianism.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. A Law rating every Taxable, of whatever Denomination, to∣wards supporting our Ministers; and you all know how much we ought to have this at Heart, as Numbers of us can scarce afford a Dram of Whisky in the Morning.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. A Law obliging every Body to attend our Worship under Pain of Corporal Punishment for the first Offence, and hanging for the second; this will oblige the Heathenish Quakers; the papistical Church of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> the ignorant and stupid <HI>Dutch</HI> (whom we have now got fast in a Halter, and upon whose Credulity we have artfully imposed, by spread∣ing some seasonable, political Romances about the Country) to attend our places of Worship; and will be the happy means of adding many Souls to our Number.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. A Law prohibiting all carnal Conversation between Men and their Wives on the Sabbath-Day, least the Flesh shou'd be more powerfull than the Spirit. For the first Offence, £. 5 to the Minister; for the second, Excommunication from the Conversation of all Mankind, and to be given over to Satan to be buffetted, till absolv'd by the <HI>Kirk,</HI> according to the Plan laid down by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Knox.</HI> Such my Brethren, are the Advantages we shall assuredly reap, if we are able to carry our point at the ensuing Election; for that End is this Meeting appointed, that we may fall upon such ways and means as will be the most likely to accomplish it. Dr <HI>A—n</HI> and I put <HI>W—n;</HI> (who you know was cast out of our <HI>Presbytaries</HI> for kissing a Girl behind a Bush in Sermon time on the Sab∣bath) upon writing that stupid Epitaph on Mr. F—n; and altho' it is stuff'd with such palpable Falshoods, yet the ignorant <HI>Dutch,</HI> who are no Witches, swallow it down with the greatest Avidity. If they once get a Story by the end, it is hard beating it out of them; however, if it holds them 'till the first of <HI>October</HI> is over, we don't care how soon they are undeceiv'd afterwards.</P>
<P>In order to cajole the <HI>Church of England</HI> we have agreed that several of out Members be chosen from among them; but as their Principles are
<PB N="30" REF="009703_0025_0F7A450DD3168150"/>
all for Monarchy Dr.—S—h has undertaken to make them as good Re∣publicans as ourselves: And altho' we despise the Man from our Hearts, and look upon him in the most contemptible Light, as one who blew up Mr. <HI>B—y</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> discovered the Artifices we made use of in col∣lecting Money for the Widows Fund, and babled out in <HI>London,</HI> that altho we assured the World in our Brief, that the charitable Donations given to us was for the Redemption of thousands of our Countrymen in Captivity by the <HI>Indians,</HI> yet we had no such Intention, as our Charter was purely for our Widows and poor Brethren; nevertheless he may answer our pu∣poses at present, and we may make use of him, as we do of a necessary-House, occasionally in Cases of Necessity. <HI>W—<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>D—a</HI> as good <HI>Presbyterians</HI> as any in the Land have got him in tow, and have cast such amist before his Eyes, that they begin to lead him about, like little Dogs who trot before blind Men in a String.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="motion">
<HEAD>A Motion by <HI>Mr,</HI>—</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Moderator,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have one Question to ask, and that is— how can all these good Laws be obtain'd in favor of our Church, if we choose <HI>Episcopalians</HI> to re∣present us?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Moderator</HI> reply'd, that there were a good many <HI>Presbyterians</HI> who would be return'd: but it was not material who were chosen this Year, if they cou'd but get <HI>F—n G—y</HI> and <HI>R—s</HI> out, with two or three others; the rest wou'd be like a Body without a Head.—And they knew if they cou'd but put in whom they pleas'd this Year, by Virtue of the same Strength, they wou'd be able to put them out the next. For if, says he, we can change them for one Year, we can always do it, so that we may fill the House with <HI>Presbyterians</HI> at pleasure.</P>
<P>The grand points we have to carry is to be unanimous among our∣selves, and to blind the <HI>Dutch</HI> by all the Political Dust we can raise; by encreasing their Prejudices against the King; alarming their Fears; and trying to persuade them that the <HI>Pr—r</HI> is a Prince.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="motion">
<HEAD>A Motion by <HI>Mr.</HI>—</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Moderator,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I believe that will be hard to do. I sounded one of them who is a Neighbour of mine upon that Subject the other Day, and the Fellow very abruptly told me, that the first Thing he did when he came into this Coun∣try, was to swear Allegiance to <HI>King George,</HI> not the P—r; that <HI>King George</HI>'s Father and Mother were both <HI>Dutch</HI> People, and he wou'd spend the last Drop of his Blood for them;—that they might talk of the Assembly as they pleas'd, but <HI>Dutch</HI> Men knew the Worth of Money as well as their Neighbours; that no Body cou'd persuade him that it was right for the Country People to pay the P—r's Taxes; that he lived close by one of the P—s Manors, as fine Land as any in the Province;—
<PB N="31" REF="009703_0026_0F7A450E5FD5CBA8"/>
that it was rated no higher than some barren stony Hills in his Possession, not worth Six-pence an Acre;—that he knew these Manors had serv'd upon the Frontiers, as so many lurking Places for the sculking <HI>Indians</HI> to mur∣der them;—that had they been settled, they cou'd have made a better De∣fence against the Inroads of the Savages; but if they are kept unimprov'd, all the Laws or Treaties in the World will never protect the back Inhabi∣tants, nor give them one Hour's Security from those Barbarians, who have always a safe Retreat in these Wildernesses interspers'd among the People, and kept to all Appearance for that Use. The Man was going on with Abundance of such Reasoning, but I stopp'd him short, and told him he knew nothing of the Matter, upon which he went away in a Pas∣sion. I confess his Arguments thunderstruck me so at that time, that I did not know how to answer him otherwise.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Moderator Speaks,</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your Conversation with the <HI>Dutchman</HI> brings to my Mind some Dis∣course I had the other Day with one of my Elders, a Man of tolerable good Sense and honest, but extreamely opinionative, proud, loquacious, and one who gives me more trouble in the Sessions, when any Matters of Fornication, Adultery, Slander, Drunkenness or Lying is discuss'd among us (which alas! is very frequent] than all the Rest of the Elders put together.</P>
<P>Having called a Sessions about the ensuing Election, I expatiated upon the Advantages we shou'd reap in opposing the K—g, and adhering to the P—r; the many distinguishing Marks of his Favor he hath shour'd upon <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in particular, above any other Denomination in <HI>Pennsylvania▪</HI> and that ever memorable Charter for the Incorporation of <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ministers to raise a Fund for their Widows and poor <HI>Mi∣nisters;</HI>—(you know that is to raise a Fund for all of us, for we can all justly plead Poverty; his own liberal Donation, and the generous En∣couragement he gave to the Collection when our Agent was in <HI>England.</HI> Here I was going on with a Dissertation as long as a Sacrament Sermon, and as much to the Purpose, when I was interrupted by my impertinent Elder, who undertook to be Mouth for the rest of his Brethren, and said.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I never understood that the Clergy had any Commission from Heaven to settle the Affairs of this World; I always imagin'd their Business was to prepare us for the next: Whenever they attempt to regulate King∣doms and Provinces, I am always suspicious thrt they are making fair Weather with Satan in order to enjoy those earthly Kingdoms themselves, which are rejected with the greatest contempt by our <HI>blessed Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>In the Days of Darkness and Superstition, the Clergy had engross'd all the <HI>civil</HI> as well as <HI>religious</HI> Authority in <HI>Europe.</HI> It was the Glory
<PB N="32" REF="009703_0027_0F7A450EB0BF7A18"/>
however of <HI>Presbyterianism</HI> at the Reformation to strip them in a great Measure of both. In every Attempt they have made since to regain their lost Influence they have generally failed; and altho' one would think that the past Experience of our Forefathers might convince the Ministers of this Day, and deter them from such unparallel'd pride, and consum∣mate Folly; yet, such is the Nature of ambitious Priests, that they are ever restless, like the foaming Sea, casting forth Mire and Dirt, till ei∣ther a few of them domineer over the rest, or the whole over us that are Laymen.</P>
<P>The Motive that led me to these Reflections, was the Consideration of that imperious <HI>Jesuitical Bull</HI> sent forth from our Ministers in <HI>Philadel∣phia</HI> to their Brethren in the Country.</P>
<P>Suppose we have no great Affection for <HI>Kingly Government,</HI> yet why our Ministers shou'd be such shallow Politicians as to publish this to the World under the mild Reign of <HI>George the Third,</HI> who has never done us any Injury, is a Piece of Priestcraft that I can't account for? Can it ren∣der us acceptable to the <HI>King</HI> to proclaim to the World, that our Antip∣parhy is to the "Form of his Government," of which he can by no Means divest himself, without renouncing his Crown? Surely by this De∣claration, viz. "as long as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Circular Letter in No. 2 of the <HI>Looking-Glass.</HI></NOTE> <HI>form of his Government subsists</HI> &amp;c. we declare ourselves not only his, but his <HI>Successors</HI> inveterate Foes.</P>
<P>Neither was it prudent in them to insinuate that we shou'd be <HI>"re∣duced,"</HI> by such a Change; surely they did not mean like half-pay Officers, broken Soldiers, or Wealthy Farmers reduced to Want and Beggary through the Calamities of the Times, and who had Nothing to live upon but daily <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I am still more astonish'd when reading their Letter; I find them possess'd of such disrespectful Thoughts of our <HI>most gracious Sovereign,</HI> as to compare him to a Rat-Catcher by indecently saying he wou'd make <HI>"Traps,"</HI> to catch the poor and worthy Inhabitants of <HI>Pennsylvania!</HI> I love our Christian Cause, and therefore blush and shudder at the Consequences of such rash and disloyal Conduct. Men who can make so free with their Sovereign, may well take upon them to lay their peremptory commands upon their Fellow Ministers, who are their Equals in all respects, in this thundering and arbirary Tone,
<Q>And let no Man persuade you to the contrary,</Q>
Did ever the <HI>Pope</HI> exceed this in his Conclave? Whatever Mandates they are pleas'd to send us we must swallow them down implicitly by Wholesale, without Examination, and not even suffer any Man to Reason with us on the Subject: Surely if a few Ministers in Town, who are of a passionate Disposition with such horrid Presumption' diametrically opposite to our Discipline, and the sublime precepts of the Christian Religion lord it with such a high Hand over their Brethren in the Country, what will our Ministers do over us that are Laymen? As for my part I am determin'd to be a free Agent and think for myself; I have read all the Pamphlets and Speeches that have been publish'd on the present Dispute, and am fully of Opinion that Religion has nothing to do with it; I am also persuaded, that if our Ministers spent
<PB N="33" REF="009703_0028_0F7A450F6FD9E0C0"/>
the Time, that they trot about the Country after Politicks in correcting their Sermons and adapting them in a better Manner than they have lat∣terly done to the Use and Benefit of their Hearers it wou'd be much more for our Edification and their Credit. Can it redound to the Honor of our Profession, the Time our Ministers ought to spend in reading and study∣ing the Scriptures, is taken up in Writing Lampoons, Satires and Libels upon the honorable and worthy Speaker of the Assembly in this Province, and his Son the Governor of a Neighbouring one, and who has been no way concern'd in our late Controversies? How can our Brethren in the <HI>Jersey</HI> ever with any Face request that Gentleman to do them any Kindness, when we here have basely insulted him in the most scurrilous and inhu∣man Manner? what is the unpardonable Crime our <HI>Assembly</HI> has com∣mitted? Why that <HI>great one</HI> of contending with the P—r, whether he shall pay his own taxes or we shall pay them for him; I confess the reason of my leaving my native Country was to get clear of oppresive Land lords, and paying of Tithes;—And while the <HI>Assembly</HI> is defending me from the first, I shall always admire their Firmness and Integrity; neither shall I ever willingly contribute to the latter, tho' it were to the establishing of you Sir (speaking to the Moderator) in this Congregation. I love my Profession very well, but I love my Liberty better, and think it much more to the Advantage of the Laity to have the Clergy under their Thumb, than the Clergy to have us under theirs.</P>
<P>Shew me an instance in the Annals of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> where the present Royal Family has attempted to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Circular Letter.</NOTE> "abridge" the religious Li∣berties of the People; or taken any Advantage of their intestine Com∣motions to lay any Hardships upon the Consciences of their Subjects? Can any one believe that the <HI>Assembly</HI> don't love their own Liberties, and the Priviliges of their Constituents better than the P—r and his Tools, who wou'd rather see the Province overflowed in a Deluge of Blood than pay his proportionable Share of the Taxes? It is my humble Opinion that if six and thirty Turks were on the <HI>Assembly</HI> in Place of the present Members, that the same innate love of Freedom wou'd prompt them to struggle for the Liberties of their Country, and pursue the <HI>same measures while the same Bone</HI> of Contention subsisted.—That Bone may now be removed by an Ap∣plication to the <HI>Crown</HI> to take us under it's immediate Protection, and send us Governors to pass such Bills as will lay an <HI>equitable Tax</HI> upon all Lands without any Exceptions?—And were all the <HI>Assembly</HI> to be chosen from among my Countrymen, and Brother Elders to-morrow, were they to give up that single point, of an <HI>equitable Tax</HI> upon all Es∣tates, even tho' they shou'd procure an Establishment in Lieu of it for our Ministers [which by the by, wou'd be no Advantage to us Laymen) I wou'd be one of the first that wou'd hang them up as high as Gilderoy, and send their Quarters into all parts of the Province by way of Memento to their Successors.—Here I interrupted my Elder, for I cou'd not bear his Impudence no longer, and assured him if he was not silent in an instant I wou'd cain him; he acknowledg'd, without making any other Reply,
<PB N="34" REF="009703_0029_0F7A4511570D2F20"/>
that my Argument was much more powerful than his, and hoped I wou'd use it to the whole Congregation.</P>
<P>The Council was adjourn'd till 9 o'clock the next Morning, when they met punctually at the Time appointed, prayed, und unanimously made the following Resolves.</P>
<P N="1">1st. Resolved, n, c, That the P—r shou'd be <HI>King</HI> in the Place of <HI>George,</HI> as <HI>Oliver</HI> had been formerly in the Room of <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. Resolved, n, c, That <HI>Presbyterians</HI> have as good a Right to <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> as the Children of <HI>Ifrael</HI> had formerly to the Land of <HI>Ca∣naan,</HI> and that it is lawful and right for <HI>Presbyterians</HI> to make use of the same Means in extirpating <HI>Quakers,</HI> Indians, or any other of their Foreign or Domestic Enemies, that the <HI>Jsralites</HI> did to expirate the <HI>Cananites.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. Resolved, n, c, That the sole right of civil and ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in this <HI>Province,</HI> belongs to <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ministers; and that they have the same Authority to preach against, and exclude Kingly Go∣vernment at this Day, as the pious and raverend Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> had to write and preach against the Government of Females in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. Resolved, n, c, That there be an annual Meeting of a Com∣mittee from the <HI>Synod</HI> in the Month of <HI>August</HI> in order to settle and re∣gulate all future Elections; and that all Elections shall be null and void, if previous Instructions laid down by the said Committees are not adher'd to.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Resolved, n, c, That whatever member of any of our Congre∣gations shall vote contrary to his Minister, shall be excommunicated from all Privileges in the <HI>Kirk,</HI> especially the Sacraments; and be deem'd as one cut off from the Communion of the Faithful, and given over to Satan to be be buffetted.</P>

<HEAD>A DIALOGUE between a <HI>Churchman</HI> in the Country, and a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> in the City of <HI>Philidelphia.</HI></HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Churchman.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOOD Morning Sir!—Well, how has the Elec∣tion gone with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Presbyterian.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not quite as well as I could wish, we have only got out three of the old Members.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chr.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not as I could wish neither, if any of our old Friends of Liberty are turn'd out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friends of Liberty do you call them? I'll assure you I have a dif∣ferent opinion of them, and think it was quite Time to turn them out; a Man must be mad to trust those with our Liberties, who were going to give them up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of your opinion that we should not trust those with our Liberties, who would not preserve and defend them, which I insist our late <HI>Assembly</HI> did do to the utmost in their Power and I wish that some of you, who have been the promoters of the new Ticket may not be found the Madmen, by endeavouring to throw our Liberties into the Hands of those, whose Attachment to the Proprietary Interest, may in some Measure prevent them from making that glorious Stand against Proprietary oppression, which those you have turn'd out have done heretofore. Who in defence of our Liberties, went so far as to Petition his Majesty to take the Tyranical Yoak of one of his Subjects from off our Necks, that we might enjoy the full Liberties granted to us by his Royal Predecessor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may say what you will of the Proprietors, or of a Pro∣prietary Government but I'll assure you, if we should have a <HI>King</HI>'s Government we shall be out of the Frying-pan into the Fire; for if our <HI>Assembly</HI> should Petition the <HI>King</HI> to take the Government, they can have no Right to Stipulate, or even to propose the Terms on which the <HI>King</HI> is to take it,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chr.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you say? The Representatives of the Freemen of the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> have not a Right to Petition their <HI>King</HI> a∣gainst the Tyranny and Oppression of one of their Fellow Subjects, and pray him to deliver them out of Slavery, by taking the Govern∣ment into his own Hands, reserving to the People their Rights granted by Charter. Pray if the Representatives of a whole Province have no Right to propose or Stipulate with the Crown in Matters of the utmost Consequence to their Constituents. How came <HI>William Penn</HI> to have a Right in behalf of one Man only, and that himself, to propose the Sale of this Government to <HI>Queen Ann,</HI> and Stipulate with her about
<PB N="36" REF="009703_0031_0F7A45126E52D360"/>
the Price; for he at first ask'd several Thousand Pounds more for it, than he afterwards agree'd to take—and at the Crowns rejecting his first offer, he was but in the same Situation which he was in before he made it; we don't understand that the <HI>Queen</HI> thought he had no Right, to make Proposals in regard to his Rights, but left it to two of her Ministers to agree with him as they should think proper; which will undoubtedly be the Case, with regard to the Petition now sent home: Either the <HI>King</HI> will accept the Government on the Terms proposed; or reject it, and leave us as we are until other Terms can be agreed on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make no doubt but that the <HI>King</HI> will accept the Government, upon its being offer'd to him, but the Reservation of our Liberties is expressed in such faint Terms, that the <HI>King</HI> will take little or no notice of them; and on the change will new moddel them over again, where∣by we shall loose our Rights.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Herein you are again mistaken, for there will be no new Mod∣deling, as the Government is already sold, and One Thousand Pounds of the purchase Money paid to <HI>William Penn</HI> at the Time of Sale; and if that was not the Case, all our Priviledges are confirmed, either by the Royal Charter, or by Acts of Assembly transmitted home and con∣firmed by the Crown, so that the <HI>King,</HI> was he inclin'd to Abridge us of any of our Priviledg<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on accepting the Government, which I think no Man can possibly suppose, has not that Power to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pr.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the <HI>King</HI> has not that Power, I suppose you'll grant that the <HI>King, Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> have and as we are look'd on, in no favour∣able light at home, but on the contrary view'd with a very jealous Eye, I am fully assured they will do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to be fill'd either weakly or wickedly with ground∣less Apprehensions to support a bad Cause▪ I would ask you, if the <HI>King, Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons</HI> look upon us in an unfavourable Light, and with a jealous Eye, why they can't make Laws to Abridge us of our Privi∣ledges, as well under a Proprietary Government, as if we were imme∣diately under the <HI>Crown;</HI> or whether their Power is too feeble and weak to reach us under a Proprietors Government▪ if not, pray what are you afraid of: Cannot they make Laws To morrow to govern us under the Proprietor as well as next Day under the <HI>Crown?</HI> To be plain with you, I believe you are against all <HI>Kingly</HI> Government, and that some of the Members of our Church, who have united with you in the present Debates, are afraid of loosing their Offices; which together I take to be the Cause of all the present Clammour against the late Assembly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk like a Fool, to say you think we are against all <HI>Kingly</HI> Government, for we are as Loyal to the <HI>King</HI> as you are, and almost to a Man signed the last Petition to his Majesty against the Change of Government, which Petition was as expressive of Loyalty and Af∣fection as our best Men were capable of wording it; and as much so, as could be expressed by Subjects to a Sovereign.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant the foregoing Part of it expresses a great deal of Loy∣alty
<PB REF="009703_0032_0F7A4513315B77B0"/>
indeed▪ but how does it read towards the winding up, where you tell him, you had rather be under the Government of one of your Fellow Subjects, and one who is represented in no very favourable Light neither, by the Representatives of the Province: Nay some of you have been bold enough to tell us, that his Majesty's little Finger will be heavier then that Subjects Loins; both of which Expressions I take to be no great Marks of Loyalty or Affection, and serves only to convince me more firmly of what I said before, that you are against <HI>Kingly</HI> Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, we are not against <HI>Kingly Government</HI> but we are not for having the present <HI>Government</HI> changed, for if the <HI>King</HI> should take it, it will cost 100,000 £. which Money we shall be obliged to pay, as the Change will be made at our request.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make me smile to see the many shifts and turns you have made use of, to screen the Proprietors, and blame our noble Patriots of.— I should be glad you'd tell me why it will cost 100,000 £. since <HI>William Penn</HI> sold it to <HI>Queen Ann</HI> for 12 000; and received 1000 in Part of pay, is it not then highly probable that on an Application from the Crown, a Decree in Chancery will pass, obliging the present Proprie∣tors to Confirm their Fathers bargain, which will reduce your 100,000 <HI>l.</HI> to a 11000, and pray why must we pay, even that, who had no band in Contracting the Debt? For my Part, I always understood it as a Maxim amongst <HI>Englishmen,</HI> that no Man is to pay a Sum of Money without receiving in Consideration that, for which the Money was paid; if then that Maxim be true, and we pay for the <HI>Government,</HI> must not that <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> be ours, and we have a Right to Elect our Governors as we do our Assemblymen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you may say as you will, but I had rather be under a little Prince then a Powerfull <HI>King.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chr.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is saving by the same rule of Gradation, that you would chuse to be under none at all; but I'll assure you I would rather be un¦der the <HI>King</HI> then under a fellow Subject; for the <HI>King</HI> can have no pri∣vate Ends to serve; it can never be supposed that he would encourage Murder, to obtain a Militia Law, nor raise a Rebellion to the great Ter∣ror of his Subjects, just to see if Quakers wou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight or not, but on the contrary, bring all such Offenders to Justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks you have a great deal of Assurance, to charge the Proprietor's Governor with being the Author, or Instigator of Murder or Rebellion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I will not charge him with being the Author of either, nor can he be charged with calling of any of those offenders to Justice, but they are passing at this Time up and down with Impunity; I wont say they are not apprehended least upon Examination, those whose Duty it is to call Offenders to Justice, should be proved the first Instigators of the Crimes.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN making the tour of <HI>Europe</HI> I had the pleasure of writing to you last from <HI>Belgrade</HI> the Capital of <HI>Hungary;</HI> I have since had the cu∣riosity, (before I enter <HI>Holand</HI>) to visit <HI>Transylvania,</HI> a Province formerly under the Dominion of the <HI>Turk,</HI> but now belonging to the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Germany;</HI> and as its <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Waywode,</HI> the name given to the Prince or Governor.</NOTE> <HI>Waywode</HI> is almost independant of his Sovereign, he has peopled it with Persons of all Nations, and of every profession under Heaven.</P>
<P>Having made a purchase of the soil from the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> who were the original Proprietors; he has also obtain'd a grant from the <HI>Emperor</HI> to him and his Heirs, for being perpetual <HI>Waywode</HI> of the Country: This enables him, together with his great distance from Court, to go∣vern the Inhabitants, who flocked from all Quarters to settle the Coun∣try under the sanction of a Charter of Privileges and immunities, granted for the preservation of their Religion and Liberties, with an absolute sway.</P>
<P>In ancient times the Natives and Foreigners lived in perfect friend∣ship; but within these ten years past, there has been nothing but bloody Wars carried on between them. The original cause of which is said to
<PB N="39" REF="009703_0034_0F7A4514CC049578"/>
be, the <HI>Waywodes</HI> taking the advantage of the simplicity and ignorance of the Natives in purchasing their Lands, with regard to their nature and situation, as well as description; and cheating them out of ten times more than ever they sold. This, (with the trade driven on among them by some Christians, who first made them drunk, and then de∣frauded them, and prostituted their Females,)—a System of religion un∣known to them and their Forefathers disgusted them to such a degree, that they immediately declared War. The <HI>Turks</HI> joining them, there was then a necessity for the <HI>Waywode</HI> and his Subjects to raise money. The Delegates being assembled to consult the welfare of the Country, insisted that a Tax shou'd be laid upon all the Cow-kine in the Province. The <HI>Waywode</HI> agreed, upon condition, that all his own shou'd be ex∣empted, as he had large flocks all over the Country. This, the Dele∣gates refus'd, because his Cows were as liable to be made a prey of by the Enemy, as their own: He then told them his Bulls were free from Taxes, as they could not come under the denomination of Cow-kine, but Bull-kine. This construction however the Delegates wou'd not ad∣mit of. A long dispute then ensued. His Excellency told them that if Bulls shou'd be taxed, which he could not believe was just, yet certainly Heffers and Calves of all kinds were clear. The Delegates reply'd- they saw no reason why his Excellency's Bulls, Heffers and Calves shou'd be exempted, and not their own. The Barbarians in the mean time laid waste the Frontiers with fire and sword. This intestine dispute prov'd more fatal to the Province, than all the depredations of a foreign Enemy. Such was the cruel, unrelenting disposition of the Lord of the soil, that he wou'd rather see a general Massacre of all the Inhabitants of the Land, than suffer one of his calves to be taxed towards protecting them from a foreign force.</P>
<P>A few of the well affected Natives to the Government, threw them∣selves under it's protection, and deliver'd up their Wives and Children as a pledge of their future Fidelity; Lands were assign'd for the maintain∣ance of some, and others were supported at the public-expence near the Metrapolis. Such was the stare of <HI>Transylvania</HI> upon my first arrival at the Capital.</P>
<P>I waited upon his Excellency the <HI>Waywode,</HI> who receiv'd me very politely. He appear'd to be a middle aged Man of small stature; sur∣rounded with half a Dozen of boys who were called Prime Ministers of State; four young Nymphs of Circassian breed, and a Calidonian wry nec∣ed Musician. The Room was filled with instruments of music. A Vio∣lin; a harpsichord; six Bagpipes, and one dozen of Jews Harps. He enquired if I understood Musick; I answered, some few Italian Airs upon the Bagpipe. Joy then appear'd upon his countenance, and he imme∣diately gave me a general invitation to accompany him either to the chase (as he lov'd a bow and arrow) or concert, every day during my stay at <HI>Weissenburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce had two days elapsed when the City was all in arms, at the news of the Piss—Brute—tarians (a bigotted, cruel and revengeful sect, sprung
<PB REF="009703_0035_0F7A4515822B7B20"/>
from the Turks, and Adoters of <HI>Mahomet</HI> as to absolute Fate, but nominal Christians in some other respects, having murder'd the innocent Natives Man Woman and Child, who were settled in the Country, were in full march to butcher those under the protection of the City. In Consequence of this intelligence, eight hundred men were put under arms, and ten pieces of cannon prepar'd. A Truce however ensued, and the <HI>Waywode,</HI> not only put up with the insult, but meanly stoop'd to carress the rebels▪ nay, he promis'd them an act of Indemnity, and engag'd to take them into high favor, if they wou'd turn their resentment upon the Delegates of the Province, instead of himself. This they agreed to. The Dele∣gates had no way to save themselves from destruction, and preserve the Government from Anarchy but by appealing to the <HI>Emperor</HI> to be taken under his own protection, and rescued from the oppressions of the Piss— Brute—tarians, and the Tyranny of the <HI>Waywode,</HI> After this strange re∣volution at Court, all that were Rebels but a few days before, were now the Court Favorites; and those, who had bravely and generously taken up arms to save his Excellency's wind-pipe from being sever'd in a thousand pieces, were look'd upon as Enemies to the Government. Such is the instability of Courts, and the wonderful Wisdom of Ministers of State! It is said his Excellency's Musical Instruments in the fray were all put out of tune, and that he has been disconcerted ever since; be that as it will; a sudden resolution was taken to call a Council, wherein it was decreed, that there shou'd no Magistrates hold Commissions under the Government, who had shewn any Love for the <HI>Emperor;</HI> or was not a Piss— Brute—tarian; or cou'd not play upon the Jew's harp.</P>
<P>As I had the happiness to be acquainted with Counsellor Wiseman, a most accomplish'd Gentleman, who had directed the Board for ten Years, with the greatest integrity through all the political storms, and tempests that had threatened the destruction of the Province, during the whole time by reason of a bloody war that had been carried on with the grand <HI>Turk,</HI> he took the first Opportunity after the Council broke up to com∣municate to me the substance of the rebate upon that important subject.</P>
<P>His Excellency the <HI>Waywode,</HI> inform'd the Board, that he wou'd not have one Assert<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rian in the Commission of the peace, or any other civil office throughout the Government, as they seem'd all tinctur'd with a re∣bellious disposition towards him and his family, and had transferr'd their Loyalty to the Emperor himself. That by their late proceedings, in choosing such men to represent them, who were his bitter Enemies, and in complaining to the <HI>Emperor</HI> against him, by which means he wou'd be look'd upon with an evil Eye at the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and either oblig'd to resign his Government, or throw himself under the Protection of the grand <HI>Turk;</HI> therefore as they had thus shewn their malicious intentions against his Administration, they were no longer to be enrolled among the Number of his Friends. He also added, that those of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Religion had behav'd in such a cold indifferent manner (a few in <HI>Weissen∣burgh</HI> excepted) as plainly made it appear that they were as well affected to the <HI>Emperor</HI> as himself;— that their principles in Religion and the max∣ims
<PB N="41" REF="009703_0036_0F7A4516321019E0"/>
by which they and their Ancestors were govern'd for one Thousand Years, were peculiarly adapted to support the <HI>Emperial Family</HI>— that these things being consider'd, he cou'd not expect their firm attachment to his person, or their general concurrence to his measures; and therefore in good policy they ought not to be trusted at such a critical conjuncture. He therefore desir'd the Council to give their opinions, whether any other Sect were to be trusted as Magistrates in the Government, besides the Piss— Brute—tarians, a Sect whose principles have ever been diametrically opposite to Monarchy; and not only * <HI>sworn</HI> Enemies to the <HI>Emperial</HI> Family, but murder'd one of the <HI>Emperors</HI> before his own palace; and have always been the foremast in all the Rebellions that have been rais'd against his Successors ever since. He also said, that there was a few of his Enemies, who have dared publickly to espouse the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s cause, and whom he "mark'd" out for punishment; he wish'd it cou'd be with the loss of their heads, instead of their Commissions. The Enemies were <HI>Pottonius, Paulinus, Mortonus,</HI> and <HI>Trumponius,</HI> the last he was some what sorry for, as he suppos'd his Ancestors were great Musicians; for they had taken a name, to perpetuate the posterity, by which some Nations call a Jews-Harp.</P>
<P>The Generality of the Council heartily concurr'd with his Excellency the <HI>Waywode;</HI> but when it came to Counsellor <HI>Wiseman</HI> to give his opi∣nion, he begg'd leave to dissent from the rest of the board; and hoped his Excellency wou'd with that attention and deliberation for which he was remarkable, hearken to his reasons.</P>
<P>He told his Excellency, he hoped he wou'd excuse him, if he differ'd with him in some of the Political Observations he had just now made, and unto which Messieurs <HI>Simpleton, Prigg, Beau,</HI> and <HI>Brainless</HI> his Brother Counsellors had signified their approbation. He told him that as he had been but a short time <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> of the province he ought to use every method in his power to cultivate a good understanding with the people;—that that as a spirit of Freedom had drawn them from all Nations to populate such an extensive province, stripping them of their rights and privileges, was not the Way of either gaining the good opinion of those who were wavering, or of bringing them back that were the most seditious; that tho' his Excellency was sensible, how little either him∣self, or the Council troubled themselves about what was called Religion, yet (as he very well knew) there was a necessity of keeping up external ap∣pearances; that it was a useful engine to keep the Vulgar in awe;—that if therefore he abandoned the profession of it, he wou'd be held in univer∣sal disesteem by all its Professors —that if he appeared more Zeal∣ous for one sect than another, a general Jealousy wou'd take place a∣mong the rest, and perhap unite them all against him; that if this shou'd happen, the Piss-Brute—tarians were not the tenth of his Subjects, and consequently could not support him against the other nine;—that if he made an impartial distribution of places of Profit and Honour in the Go∣vernment, and establish'd them in all their equitable demands, the <HI>Em∣peror</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="009703_0037_0F7A451864CA1358"/>
wou'd have no objection towards the continuing of him in his <HI>Vice-royalty;</HI> no complaints cou'd have any weight against him; his Character wou'd appear fair at Court, and perhaps save him the expence und trouble of a long Journey to defend himself.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Assertorians,</HI> the raking them into his favor, in imitation of many of his worthy Predecessors wou'd, perhaps, effectually regain their Friendship; make them drop the prosecution of their Appeal: and as they are above one fifth part of the Inhabitants, they are no contemptable body to disoblige. <HI>Pottonius</HI> (who appears to be particularly singled out) is a Gentleman, who has remarkably distinguish'd himself this twenty Years past, for his Integrity, in faithfully discharging the Office of a Magistrate; his fortune places him above the fear of affection of Mankind, in the de∣stribution of Justice; and therefore he does you Excellency as much ho∣nor in accepting of the Commission, as you can do him in giving it. As to those of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Religion, it is well known that two of their Priests, and a number of their People, who either hold Offices in reality under you, or live in expectation of them, in this Metrapolis, have gone greater lengths to serve you, than any other Sect among us in some par∣ticulars,</P>
<P>Have they not abandoned their former Principles, violated every obli∣ligation that was either civil of sacred, or that bound them by the ties of Conscience or honor to be faithful to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> in order to support your Cause? Have they not prostituted their Temple, (a place solemnly de∣dicated for pious uses) as an Amphitheatre for the Rabble to combat in? Has not their Altar been profaned by the unhallowed hands of Turks, Jews, Infidels and Piss—Brute—tarians? And all this in favor of your Excellency?</P>
<P>As for <HI>Paulinus, Mortonus,</HI> and others of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Profession, whose characters have been irreproachable, and whose Virtues have made them rever'd by their Country, shall they become the objects of your Excellency's disapprobation for no other reason, than that they still con∣tinue to have a regard for the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and cannot easily conquer their old prejudices in favor of the Emperial Court?—Time might bring them over as well as others; but such rash and precipitate measures, will create a Jealousy throughout all all <HI>Transylvania,</HI> as if your opposition to them was purely out of spite to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> for whom they wou'd be made a Sacrifice.</P>
<P>Your Attachment to the Piss—Brute—tarians is somewhat remark∣able, as they have been the cause of all the trouble that has happen'd in the Government. Had there never been a Rebellion amongst them here, your Excellency wou'd never have been brought into such difficulties. Had the Traitors been punish'd according to their Demerit, there never wou'd have been an Appeal to <HI>Vienna.</HI> How then can you place your chief con∣fidence in a sect vvho have been the sole cause of your misfortunes? These invincible arguments stagger'd his Excellency; but being a Man of weak

Intellects, and abandon'd (like <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The last King of the Assyrian Empire, who for his extream Effeminacy was so disdain'd by his own Captains, that they conspired against him.

Thus the Council broke up. But I am afraid, I have trangress'd the bounds of a single Letter, and have only tired your patience with some few hints about the Politicks of a Country, the name of which is scarcely known in <HI>America.</HI> You see by this how I improve my time in my Travels, and I hope to return to <HI>America</HI> equally accom∣plish'd with those of my Countrymen who have made this Tour before me.
