<HEAD>THE CASE Of the People called QUAKERS In the Province of PENNSYLVANIA, With respect to the Forms of Declara∣tion of Fidelity to the King, and of Affirmation, lately granted to their Friends in <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. by Acts of Parliament, briefly stated and humbly offer'd to the Consideration of the Governour and Council of the said Province.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second favouring the good Purpose of our late Proprietary <HI>William Penn,</HI> and ha∣ving Regard to the Memory and Merits of his deceased Father, in
<PB N="2" REF="002533_0002_0FDB5C37A0F944D8"/>
divers Services, was pleased by his <HI>Royal Charter</HI> to grant and confirm this Country, with certain Priviledg∣es and Jurisdictions requisite for the good Government thereof, to him the said Proprietary and his Heirs for ever; Whereupon an ample Co∣lony of honest, industrious and weal∣thy Persons, removed themselves and Families into this Province, and by the great Favour and Blessing of Divine Providence upon their En∣deavours, made this considerable Ad∣dition to the English Empire, with∣out any Charge to the Crown, ho∣ping to enjoy not only the Fran∣chises and Immunities granted them by the said Charter, but such fur∣ther Rights and Priviledges, as may best suit their Circumstances, as dif∣fering in some Points from other Pro∣testants, particularly in the Case of Swearing, which the said Proprieta∣ry and first Purchasers (some of whom were not <HI>Quakers</HI>) on the Fifth Day of the Month called <HI>May,
<PB N="3" REF="002533_0003_0FDB5C39170D5A18"/>
Anno Domini</HI> 1682 in <HI>London,</HI> did conclude should be supply'd by <HI>So∣lemnly Promising</HI> to speak the Truth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And at the first General Assem∣bly, held at <HI>Chester,</HI> for this Pro∣vince and the Counties annexed, on the Seventh of <HI>December</HI> in the said Year 1682, the same passed into a Law; and on the Tenth Day of the Month called <HI>March</HI> 1682-3, it was by the Proprietor, with the Advice and Consent of the Freemen of this Province and Territories, declared to be a Fundamental Law of this Pro∣vince and Territories, not to be al∣ter'd or repeal'd without the Consent of the Governour, and Six Parts in Se∣ven of the Council and Assembly: And afterwards when Col. <HI>Fletcher</HI> was Go∣vernour, under the immediate Direc∣tion of the Crown, the same Form of Affirmation by a Solemn Promise was establish'd here, and confirm'd at Home in the Year 1694, instead of an Oath; and so it was and prac∣tised in all Cases after our Proprie∣tary
<PB N="4" REF="002533_0004_0FDB5C3E6ED97820"/>
was restored to his Government in the Year 1696, which was since the Statute that first enacted the Af∣firmation in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>After the Proprietary's reassuming his Government, the Laws were re∣vised in 1700 and 1701, and this a∣bout the manner of giving Evidence, with divers others, were remitted to the Queen and Council in 1705, and was referr'd to the Consideration of <HI>Northy,</HI> then Attorney General, who did not object to the Form of Words, or legal Effect of Solemnly Promi∣sing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> instead of an Oath, or o∣ther Affirmation, but his Opinion was to repeal the said Act, because the Punishment of Wilfully Falsify∣ing that Solemn Promise, was exten∣ded further than the Law of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> required, which thereupon was repeal'd accordingly.</P>
<P>Our Friends continued in the En∣joyment of this Fundamental Right
<PB N="5" REF="002533_0005_0FDB5C4158B20580"/>
for above Twenty Years with good Success, until the said Repeal; since which we have labour'd under many Difficulties, and divers Essays have been made for reviving the aforesaid Priviledge, which hitherto have pro∣ved ineffectual: And now understan∣ding that our Representatives in As∣sembly, have laid before the Gover∣nour a Bill relating the Forms of Affirmation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> lately granted to our Brethren in <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the said Bill being fra∣med, as we concieve, agreeable to the Governour's own Proposal, and the Circumstances of this Province, We humbly intreat that he will be pleas'd to pass the said Bill, now before him, into a Law, whereby we may all be render'd useful, not only to each other, but to others our Neighbours who may stand in need of our Evidence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>For however it may be objected by some, that they are not sufficient∣ly

secured in submitting the Tryal of their Lives and Estates to a Qua∣lification, wherein the Name of God is not mentioned; we account it a sure Rule that the Chief Motives in a Christian to speak Truth, are, first the Fear of God in his Heart and Love of Truth, or secondly, the Fear of Punishment.</P>
<P>And it is evident, that the King and Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are of the same Opinion concerning us in this Case, otherwise after an Ex∣perience of Twenty-five Years, they would not so generally accept our Solemn Promise in so important a Matter as a Test of our Allegiance and Fidelity to the King, and for abjuring the Pretender, at a Time when new Engagements are required of other Subjects in the same Cases; And therefore, we hope our Fellow-Subjects will Acquiesce in the same Security, and not affect a great Dif∣fidence than our Superiours. And
