<HEAD>A PRAYER Unto Christ the Judge OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<L>O Dearest Dread, most glorious King,</L>

<L>Do thou my head and heart inspire,</L>
<L>To Sing aright, as I desire.</L>
<L><HI>Thee, thee</HI> alone I'le invocate,</L>

<L><PB REF="001030_0011_0FAEEEC039D7ADA0"/>But I have learnt to pray to none,</L>

<L>Nor will I laud, no not in jest,</L>
<L>That which I know God doth detest.</L>
<L>I reckon it a damning evil</L>
<L>To give Gods Praises to the Devil.</L>
<L>Thou, <HI>Christ,</HI> art he to whom I pray,</L>
<L>Thy Glory fain I would display.</L>
<L>Oh! guide me by thy sacred Sprite</L>

<HEAD>A Postscript UNTO THE Reader.</HEAD>
<L>AND now good Reader, I return again</L>
<L>To talk with thee, who hast been at the pain</L>
<L>To read throughout, &amp; heed what went be∣fore;</L>
<L>And unto thee I'le speak a little more.</L>
<L>Give ear, I pray thee, unto what I say,</L>
<L>That God may hear thy voice another day.</L>
<L>Thou hast a Soul, my friend, and so have I,</L>
<L>To save or lose; a Soul that cannot die,</L>
<L>A soul of greater price than Gold and Gems;</L>
<L>A Soul more worth than Crowns and Diadems;</L>
<L>A Soul at first created like its Maker,</L>
<L>And of Gods Image made to be partaker:</L>
<L>Upon the wings of Noblest Faculties,</L>
<L>Taught for to soar above the Starry Skies,</L>
<L>And not to rest, until it understood</L>
<L>It self possessed of the chiefest good.</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="001030_0075_0FAEEF164EC51508"/>And since the Fall, thy Soul retaineth still</L>
<L>Those Faculties of Reason and of Will,</L>
<L>But Oh, how much deprav'd, and out of frame,</L>
<L>As if they were some others, not the same.</L>
<L>Thine Understanding dismally benighted,</L>
<L>And Reason's eye in Sp'ritual things dim-sighted,</L>
<L>Or else stark blind: Thy Will inclin'd to evil,</L>
<L>And nothing else, a Slave unto the Devil;</L>
<L>That loves to live, and liveth to transgress,</L>
<L>But shuns the way of God and Holiness.</L>
<L>All thine Affections are disordered;</L>
<L>And thou by head-strong Passions are misled.</L>
<L>What need I tell thee of thy crooked way,</L>
<L>And many wicked wand'rings every day?</L>
<L>Or that thine own transgressions are more</L>
<L>In number, than the sands upon the Shore:</L>
<L>Thou art a lump of wickedness become,</L>
<L>And may'st with horrour think upon thy Doom.</L>
<L>Until thy Soul be washed in the flood</L>
<L>Of Christ's most dear, soul-cleansing precious blood.</L>
<L>That, that alone can do away thy sin</L>
<L>Which thou wert born, and hast long lived in,</L>
<L>That, only that, can pacifie Gods wrath,</L>
<L>If apprehended by a lively Faith.</L>
<L>Now whilst the day and means of Grace do last,</L>
<L>Before the opportunity be past.</L>
<L>But if, O man, thou liv'st a Christless creature,</L>
<L>And Death surprize thee in a state of nature,</L>
<L>(As who can tell but that may be thy case)</L>
<L>How wilt thou stand before the Judge's face?</L>
<L>When he shall be reveal'd in flaming fire,</L>
<L>And come to pay ungodly men their hire:</L>
<L>To execute due vengeance upon those</L>
<L>That knew him not, or that have been his foes:</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="001030_0076_0FAEEF1718E0ED50"/>What wilt thou answer unto his demands,</L>
<L>When he requires a reason at thy hands</L>
<L>Of all the things that thou hast said, or done,</L>
<L>Or left undone, or set thine heart upon?</L>
<L>When he shall thus with thee expostulate,</L>
<L>What cause hadst thou thy Maker for to hate,</L>
<L>To take up Arms against thy Soveraign,</L>
<L>And Enmity against him to maintain?</L>
<L>What injury hath God Almighty done thee?</L>
<L>What good hath he with-held that might have won thee.</L>
<L>What evil, or injustice, hast thou found</L>
<L>In him, that might unto thine hurt redound?</L>
<L>If neither felt, nor feared injury</L>
<L>Hath moved thee to such hostility;</L>
<L>What made thee then the Fountain to forsake,</L>
<L>And unto broken Pits thy self betake?</L>
<L>What reason hadst thou to dishonour God,</L>
<L>Who thee with Mercies never cease to load?</L>
<L>Because the Lord was good, hast thou been evil,</L>
<L>And taken part against him with the Devil?</L>
<L>For all his cost to pay him with despite,</L>
<L>And all his love with hatred to requite?</L>
<L>Is this the fruit of Gods great patience,</L>
<L>To wax more bold in disobedience?</L>
<L>To kick against the bowels of his Love,</L>
<L>Is this aright his Bounty to improve?</L>
<L>Stand still, ye Heav'ns and be astonished,</L>
<L>That God by man should thus be injured!</L>
<L>Give ear, O Earth, and tremble at the sin</L>
<L>Of those that thine Inhabitants have bin.</L>
<L>But thou, vile wretch, hast added unto all</L>
<L>Thine other faults, and facts so criminal,</L>

<HEAD>A SONG OF EMPTINESS, <HI>To fill up the Empty Pages</HI> following. <HI>Vanity of Vanities.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>VAin, frail, short liv'd, and miserable Man,</L>
<L>Learn what thou art when thine estate is best:</L>
<L>A restless Wave o'th' troubled Ocean,</L>
<L>A Dream, a lifeless Picture finely drest:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Wind, a Flower, a Vapour, and a Bubble,</L>
<L>A Wheel that stands nor still, a trembling Reed,</L>
<L>A rolling Stone, dry Dust, light Chaff, and Stubble,</L>
<L>A Shadow of Something, but nought indeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Learn what deceitful Toyes, and empty things,</L>
<L>This World, and all its best Enjoyments bee:</L>
<L>Out of the Earth no true Contentment springs,</L>
<L>But all things here are vexing Vanitee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For what is <HI>Beauty,</HI> but a fading Flower?</L>
<L>Or what is <HI>Pleasure,</HI> but the Devils bait,</L>
<L>Whereby he catcheth whom he would devour,</L>
<L>And multitudes of Souls doth ruinate?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="77" REF="001030_0088_0FAEEF262D09DC88"/>
<L>And what are <HI>Friends</HI> but mortal men, as we?</L>
<L>Whom Death from us may quickly separate;</L>
<L>Or else their hearts may quite estranged be,</L>
<L>And all their love be turned into hate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And what are <HI>Riches</HI> to be doted on?</L>
<L>Uncertain, sickle, and ensnaring things;</L>
<L>They draw Mens Souls into Perdition,</L>
<L>And when most needed, take them to their wings,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah foolish Man! that sets his heart upon</L>
<L>Such empty Shadows, such wild Fowl as these,</L>
<L>That being gotten will be quickly gone.</L>
<L>And whilst they stay increase but his disease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As in a Dropsie, drinking draughts begets,</L>
<L>The more he drinks, the more he still requires,</L>
<L>So on this World whoso affection sets,</L>
<L>His Wealths encrease encreaseth his desires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O happy Man, whose portion is above,</L>
<L>WhereFloods, where Flames, where Foes cannot bereave him,</L>
<L>Most wretched man, that fixed hath his love</L>
<L>Upon this World, that surely will deceive him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For, what is <HI>Honour?</HI> What is <HI>Sov'raignty,</HI></L>
<L>Whereto mens hearts so restlesly aspire?</L>
<L>Whom have they Crowned with Felicity?</L>
<L>When did they ever satisfie desire?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Ear of Man with hearing is not fill'd;</L>
<L>To see new sights still coveteth the Eye:</L>
<L>The craving Stomack though it may be still'd,</L>
<L>Yet craves again without a new supply.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="78" REF="001030_0089_0FAEEF2A502D3858"/>
<L>All Earthly things, man's Cravings answer not,</L>
<L>Whose little heart would all the World contain,</L>
<L>(If all the World should fall to one man's Lot)</L>
<L>And notwithstanding empty still remain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The <HI>Eastern Conquerour</HI> was said to weep,</L>
<L>When he the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean did view,</L>
<L>To see his Conquest bounded by the Deep,</L>
<L>And no more Worlds remaining to subdue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who would that man in his Enjoyments bless,</L>
<L>Or envy him, or covet his estate,</L>
<L>Whose gettings do augment his greediness,</L>
<L>And make his wishes more intemperate?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such is the wonted and the common guise</L>
<L>Of those on Earth that bear the greatest Sway;</L>
<L>If with a few the case be otherwise</L>
<L>They seek a Kingdom that abides for ay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Moreover they, of all the Sons of men,</L>
<L>That Rule, and are in highest places set,</L>
<L>Are most inclin'd to scorn their Bretheren</L>
<L>And God himself (without great grace) forget.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For as the Sun doth blind the gazer's eyes,</L>
<L>That for a time they nought discern aright:</L>
<L>So Honour doth befool and blind the Wise,</L>
<L>And their own Lustre 'reaves them of their sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great are their Dangers, manifold their Cares;</L>
<L>Thro' which, whilst others Sleep, they scarcely Nap;</L>
<L>And yet are oft surprized unawares,</L>
<L>And fall unweeting into Envies Trap.</L>
