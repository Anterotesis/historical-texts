<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AN attack is made on the credit and institution of the Bank of North-America. Whether this at∣tack is justified by the principles of law and sound policy, is a natural subject of enquiry. The en∣quiry is as necessary and interesting, as it is natural: For, though some people represent the Bank as injurious and dangerous, while others consider it as salutary and beneficial, to the community, all view it as an object of high importance; deserving and demanding the public attention.</P>
<P>IN the investigation of this subject, it will be requisite to discuss some great and leading questions concerning the constitution of the United States, and the relation, which subsists between them and each particular State in the union. Perhaps it is to be wished that this discussion had not been rendered necessary; and that those que∣stions had rested some time longer among the <HI>arcana im∣perii:</HI> But they are now presented to the public; and the public should view them with firmness, with impar∣tiality, and with all the solicitude befitting such a mo∣mentous occasion.</P>
<P>A GENTLEMAN,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide the preface to the Statement of the accounts of the United States.</HI></NOTE> who had the best opportunities of observing, and who possesses the best talents for judging on the subject, informs his fellow-citizens officially, that <Q>it may be not only <HI>asserted,</HI> but <HI>demonstrated,</HI> that, without the establishment of the <HI>National</HI> Bank, the business of the department of finance could not have been performed</Q> in the late war.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Millennium</HI> is not yet come. War, with all the horrors and miseries in his train, may re-visit us. The
<PB N="4" REF="019388_0003_0FAB48122C4659C0"/>
finances may again be deranged: <Q>Public credit may, again, be at an end: No means may be afforded ade∣quate to the public expences.</Q> Is it wise or politic to deprive our country, in such a situation, of a resource, which happy experience has shewn to be of such <HI>essential</HI> importance? Will the citizens of the United States be encouraged to embark their fortunes on a similar bottom in a future war, by seeing the vessel, which carried us so successfully through the last, thrown aside, like an use∣less hulk, upon the return of peace?</P>
<P>IT will not be improper to recall to our remembrance the origin, the establishment, and the proceedings of the Bank of North-America.</P>
<P>IN May, 1781, the Superintendant of Finance laid before Congress a plan of a Bank. On the 26th of that month Congress passed the following resolution concern∣ing it.</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That Congress do approve of the plan for <HI>establishing</HI> a <HI>National Bank</HI> in <HI>these United States,</HI> sub∣mitted to their consideration by Mr. Robert Morris, the 17th May, 1781, and that they will promote and sup∣port the same by such ways and means, from time to time, as may appear necessary for the institution, and consistent with the public good.</P>
<P>"THAT the subscribers to the said Bank SHALL BE INCORPORATED, agreeably to the principles and terms of the plan, under the name of <HI>the President, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America,</HI> so soon as the subscription shall be filled, the Directors and President chosen, <HI>and application made to</HI> CONGRESS <HI>for that pur∣pose,</HI> by the President and Directors elected.</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That it be <HI>recommended</HI> to the several States, by proper laws for that purpose, to provide that no other Bank or Bankers shall be established or permitted within the said States respectively during the war.</P>
<P>"RESOLVED, That the notes hereafter to be issued by the said Bank, payable on demand, <HI>shall be receiva∣ble</HI> in payment of all taxes, duties and debts, due or that may become due or payable to the United States.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019388_0004_0FAB4812EC8AAA08"/>
"RESOLVED, That Congress will <HI>recommend</HI> to the several legislatures to pass laws, making it felony without benefit of clergy, for any person to counterfeit Bank Notes, or to pass such notes, knowing them to be coun∣terfeit; also making it felony without benefit of clergy, for any President, Inspector, Director, Officer or servant of the Bank, to convert any of the property, money or credit of the said Bank to his own use, or in any other way to be guilty of fraud or embezzlement, as officers or servants of the Bank."</P>
<P>UNDER these resolutions a subscription was opened for the <HI>National Bank:</HI> This subscription was not confined to <HI>Pennsylvania:</HI> The citizens of <HI>other</HI> States trusted their property to the public faith; and before the end of De∣cember, 1781, the subscription was filled, "from an expectation of a charter of incorporation from Congress." Application was made to Congress by the President and Directors, then chosen, for an act of incorporation. "The EXIGENCIES <HI>of the United States</HI> rendered it <HI>in∣dispensably necessary</HI> that such an act should be immediately passed."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the act in the appendix.</HI></NOTE> Congress▪ at the same time that they PASSED the <HI>act of incorporation,</HI> RECOMMENDED to the legislature of each State, to pass such laws as they might judge ne∣cessary for giving its <HI>ordinance</HI> its full operation, agree∣ably to the true intent and meaning thereof, and accord∣ing to the <HI>recommendations</HI> contained in the resolution of the 26th day of May preceding.</P>
<P>THE Bank immediately commenced its operations. Its seeds were small, but they were vigorous. The sums paid in by individuals upon their subscriptions did not amount, in the whole, to seventy thousand dollars. The sum invested by the United States, in bank stock, a∣mounted to something more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars: But this sum may be said to have been paid in with one hand and borrowed with the other; and before the end of the first three months farther sums were advanced to the United States, and an advance
<PB N="6" REF="019388_0005_0FAB4813B1B10DD8"/>
was made to this State.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>See in the appendix the different sums advanced to this state.</HI></NOTE> Besides, numerous accommoda∣tions were afforded to individuals. Little was it then imagined that the Bank would ever be represented as un∣friendly to circulation. It was viewed as the source and as the support of credit, both private and public: As such, it was hated and dreaded by the enemies of the United States: As such, it was loved and fostered by their friends.</P>
<P>PENNSYLVANIA, distinguished on numerous occasions by her faithful and affectionate attachment to foederal principles, embraced, in the first session of her legislature after the establishment of the Bank, the opportunity of testifying her approbation of an act, which had been found to be indispensably necessary. Harmonizing with the sentiments and <HI>recommendations</HI> of the United States, the Assembly passed an act,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">18<HI>th March,</HI> 1782.</NOTE> "for preventing and pu∣nishing the counterfeiting of the <HI>common seal,</HI> bank bills and bank notes, of the <HI>President, Directors and Company</HI> of the <HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>North-America."</HI> In the preamble to this act, which, according to the constitution of this state, expresses the reasons and motives for passing it, the "NE∣CESSITY" of taking "EFFECTUAL measures for pre∣venting and punishing frauds and cheats which may be put upon the <HI>President, Directors and Company</HI> of the BANK of NORTH-AMERICA," is <HI>explicitly</HI> DECLARED by the legislature.</P>
<P>THE sentiments and conduct of other states, respect∣ing the establishment of the National Bank by Congress, were similar to those of Pennsylvania. The General As∣sembly of Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>January Sessions,</HI> 1782.</NOTE> made it felony, without benefit of Clergy, "to coun∣terfeit any note or notes issued, or to be issued, from the <HI>Bank of North-America,</HI> as approved and ESTABLISHED <HI>by the United States in Congress assembled."</HI> The state of Connecticut enacted,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">10<HI>th January,</HI> 1782.</NOTE> that a tax should be laid, payable in money, or "notes issued by the Directors of the <HI>Na∣tional
<PB N="7" REF="019388_0006_0FAB48146BFD5658"/>
Bank,</HI> ESTABLISHED <HI>by an ordinance of the United States in Congress assembled."</HI> By a law of Massachusetts, the subscribers to the National Bank, approved of by the United States, were "incorporated, on the behalf of that commonwealth, by the name of the President, Di∣rectors and Company of the Bank of North-America, <HI>according to the terms of the</HI> ORDINANCE TO INCORPO∣RATE THE SAID SUBSCRIBERS, passed by the United States in Congress assembled on the thirty-first day of December, 1781." The same law further enacts, "that all notes or bills, which have been or shall be issued by, for, or in the name of the said President, Directors and Company, and payable on demand, shall be receivable in the payment of all taxes, debts and duties, due or that may become due, or payable to, or for account of, the said United States." In the preamble of this law, the legislature <HI>declares</HI> that "a National Bank is of great service, as well to the public as to individuals."</P>
<P>THE President and Directors of the Bank had a deli∣cate and a difficult part to act. On one hand, they were obliged to guard against the malice and exertions of their enemies: On the other, it was incumbent on them to sooth the timidity of some of their friends. The credit of a Bank, as well as all other credit, depends on opi∣nion. Opinion, whether well or ill founded, produces, in each case, the same effects upon conduct. Some thought that an act of incorporation from the legislature of this state would be <HI>beneficial;</HI> none apprehended that it could ever be <HI>hurtful</HI> to the National Bank. Pru∣dence, therefore, and a disposition, very natural in that season of doubt and diffidence, to gratify the sentiments, and even the prejudices, of such as might become sub∣scribers or customers to the Bank, directed an application to the Assembly for "a charter, similar to that granted by the United States in Congress assembled." But tho' the Directors were willing to avail themselves of encou∣ragement from every quarter, they meant not to relin∣quish any of their rights, or to change the foundation on which they rested. They made their application in their
<PB N="8" REF="019388_0007_0FAB4815D9D9C858"/>
<HI>corporate</HI> character.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Their letter to the President of the Supreme Executive Council, on this occasion, is in the appendix.</HI></NOTE> They expresly mentioned to the As∣sembly, that the United States in Congress assembled had granted to the Bank a charter of incorporation, and that the institution was to be carried on under THEIR IMME∣DIATE AUSPICES. The legislature thought that it was proper and reasonable to grant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1<HI>st April,</HI> 1782.</NOTE> the request of the <HI>Pre∣sident and Directors of the Bank of North-America;</HI> and assigned, as a reason for the act, "that the United States in Congress assembled, from a <HI>conviction</HI> of the support which the <HI>finances of the</HI> UNITED STATES would receive from the <HI>establishment</HI> of a NATIONAL BANK, passed an ordinance to incorporate the subscribers <HI>for this purpose,</HI> by the name and stile of the President, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America."</P>
<P>THE first clause of the law enacts, that "those who are, and those who <HI>shall become</HI> subscribers to <HI>the said Bank,</HI> be, and FOR EVER HEREAFTER SHALL BE, a corporation and body politic, to all intents and purposes."</P>
<P>IT is further enacted, that "the said corporation be, and <HI>shall be for ever hereafter,</HI> able and capable in law to do and execute all and singular matters and things, that to them shall or may appertain to do."</P>
<P>To show, in the most striking light, the kind sentiments of the legislature towards the institution, it is further enacted, that "this act shall be construed and taken most <HI>favourably</HI> and <HI>beneficially</HI> for the said corporation."</P>
<P>ON these facts and proceedings, two questions of much national importance present themselves to our view and examination.</P>
<P>I. IS THE Bank of North America legally and consti∣tutionally instituted and organised, by the charter of in∣corporation granted by the United States in Congress assembled?</P>
<P>II. WOULD it be wise or politic in the legislature of Pennsylvania, to revoke the charter which it has granted to the institution?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="019388_0008_0FAB4815ECDBAC50"/>
THE discussion of these two questions will naturally lead us to the proper conclusions concerning the VALIDI∣TY and the UTILITY of the Bank.</P>
<P>I. HAD the United States in Congress assembled a legal and constitutional power to institute and organise the Bank of North-America, by a charter of incorporation?</P>
<P>THE objection, under this head, will be—that the articles of confederation express all the powers of Con∣gress, that in those articles no power is delegated to that body to grant charters of incorporation, and that, there∣fore, Congress possess no such power.</P>
<P>IT is true, that, by the second article of the confede∣ration, "each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not, by the confederation, <HI>expresly</HI> delegated to the United States in Congress assembled."</P>
<P>IF, then, <HI>any</HI> or <HI>each</HI> of the States possessed, previous to the confederation, a power, jurisdiction or right, to institute and organise, by a charter of incorporation, a Bank for North-America; in other words—commensu∣rate to the United States; such power, jurisdiction and right, unless expresly delegated to Congress, cannot be legally or constitutionally exercised by that body.</P>
<P>BUT, we presume, it will not be contended, that <HI>any</HI> or <HI>each</HI> of the States could exercise any power or act of sovereignty extending <HI>over</HI> all the other States, or <HI>any</HI> of them; or, in other words, incorporate a Bank, com∣mensurate to the United States.</P>
<P>THE consequence is, that this is not an act of sove∣reignty, or a power, jurisdiction or right, which, by the second article of the confederation, must be <HI>expresly</HI> dele∣gated to Congress, in order to be possessed by that body.</P>
<P>IF, however, <HI>any</HI> person shall contend that <HI>any</HI> or each of the States can exercise such an extensive power or act of sovereignty as that above mentioned; to <HI>such</HI> person we give this answer—The State of Massachusetts has ex∣ercised such power and act: It has incorporated the Bank of North-America. But to pursue my argument.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="019388_0009_0FAB4816AC8FF968"/>
THOUGH the United States in Congress assembled de∣rive <HI>from the particular States</HI> no power, jurisdiction or right, which is not <HI>expresly</HI> delegated by the confedera∣tion, it does not <HI>thence</HI> follow, that the United States in Congress have <HI>no other</HI> powers, jurisdiction or rights, than <HI>those</HI> delegated by the <HI>particular States.</HI></P>
<P>THE United States have <HI>general</HI> rights, <HI>general</HI> powers, and <HI>general</HI> obligations, not derived from <HI>any</HI> particular States, nor from <HI>all</HI> the particular States, taken <HI>separate∣ly;</HI> but <HI>resulting from the union of the whole:</HI> And, therefore, it is provided, in the fifth article of the confe∣deration, <Q>that for the more convenient management of the GENERAL INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES, delegates shall be annually appointed to meet in Con∣gress.</Q></P>
<P>To many purposes, the United States are to be consi∣dered as one <HI>undivided, independent</HI> nation; and as pos∣sessed of <HI>all the rights,</HI> and <HI>powers,</HI> and <HI>properties,</HI> by the law of nations <HI>incident</HI> to such.</P>
<P>WHENEVER an object occurs, to the direction of which no particular state is competent, the management of it must, <HI>of necessity,</HI> belong to the United States in Congress assembled. There are many objects of this ex∣tended nature. The purchase, the sale, the defence, and the government of lands and countries, <HI>not</HI> WITHIN ANY <HI>State,</HI> are all included under this description. An institution for <HI>circulating paper,</HI> and <HI>establishing its credit over the whole United States,</HI> is naturally ranged in the same class.</P>
<P>THE act of independence was made before the articles of confederation. This act <HI>declares,</HI> that <HI>"these</HI> UNIT∣ED <HI>Colonies,"</HI> (not enumerating them separately) <HI>"are</HI> free and independent States; and that, as free and inde∣pendent States, THEY have full power to do <HI>all</HI> acts and things which independent States may, of right, do."</P>
<P>THE confederation was not intended to weaken or abridge the <HI>powers</HI> and <HI>rights,</HI> to which the United States were <HI>previously</HI> entitled. It was not intended to transfer any of those powers or rights to the <HI>particular</HI> States, or
<PB N="11" REF="019388_0010_0FAB48176F92ECB0"/>
any of them. If, therefore, the power now in question was vested in the United States before the confederation; it continues vested in them still. The confederation clothed the United States with many (though, perhaps, not with sufficient) powers: But of none did it disrobe them.</P>
<P>IT is no <HI>new</HI> position, that rights may be vested in a political body, which did not previously reside in <HI>any</HI> or in <HI>all</HI> the members of that body. They may be derived solely from <HI>the</HI> UNION <HI>of those members.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Burlamaqui, p.</HI> 42.</NOTE> "THE case," says the celebrated Burlamaqui, <Q>is here very near the same as in that of several voices collected together, which, <HI>by their union,</HI> produce a harmony, that was <HI>not</HI> to be found <HI>separately in each.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A NUMBER of unconnected inhabitants are settled on each side of a navigable river; it belongs to <HI>none</HI> of them; it belongs not to them <HI>all,</HI> for they have nothing in common: Let them unite; the river is the property of the united body.</P>
<P>THE arguments drawn from the political associations of <HI>individuals</HI> into a <HI>state</HI> will apply, with equal force and propriety, to a <HI>number of states</HI> united by a <HI>confede∣racy.</HI></P>
<P>NEW states must be FORMED and established; their extent and boundaries must be regulated and ascertained. How can this be done, unless by the United States in Congress assembled?</P>
<P>STATES are corporations or bodies politic of the most important and dignified kind.</P>
<P>LET us now concenter the foregoing observations, and apply them to the incorporation of the Bank of North-America by Congress.</P>
<P>BY the <HI>civil law,</HI> corporations seem to have been created by the mere and voluntary association of their members, provided such convention was not contrary to law.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackstone,</HI> 472.</NOTE></P>
<P>BY the <HI>common law,</HI> something more is necessary—All the methods whereby corporations exist are, for the
<PB N="12" REF="019388_0011_0FAB481832D3FE50"/>
most part, reducible to that of the king's letters patents, or charter of incorporation.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Blackstone,</HI> 472, 473.</NOTE></P>
<P>FROM this it will appear that the creation of a corpo∣ration is, by the common law, considered as the act of the executive rather than of the legislative powers of government.</P>
<P>BEFORE the revolution charters of incorporation were granted by the proprietaries of Pennsylvania, under a derivative authority from the crown, and those charters have been recognized by the <HI>constitution</HI> and <HI>laws</HI> of the commonwealth since the revolution.</P>
<P>FROM analogy, therefore, we may justly infer, that the United States in Congress assembled, possessing the executive powers of the union, may, in virtue of such powers, grant charters of incorparation for accomplish∣ing objects that comprehend the <HI>general interests</HI> of the United States.</P>
<P>BUT the United States in Congress assembled possess, in many instances, and to many purposes, the legislative as well as the executive powers of the union; and there∣fore, whether we consider the incorporation of the Bank as a <HI>law,</HI> or as a <HI>charter,</HI> it will be equally within the powers of Congress: For the object of this institution could not be reached without the exertion of the <HI>combined sovereignty</HI> of the union.</P>
<P>I HAVE asked—How can new states, which are bodies politic, be formed, unless by the United States in Con∣gress assembled? Fact, as well as argument, justifies my sentiments on this subject. The conduct of Congress has been similar on similar occasions. The same princi∣ples have directed the exercise of the same powers.</P>
<P>IN the month of April, 1784, Congress resolved, that part of the western territory "should be divided into distinct states."</P>
<P>THEY further resolved, that the settlers should, "ei∣ther on their own petition, or on the order of Congress, <HI>receive authority from</HI> THEM to meet together, for the
<PB N="13" REF="019388_0012_0FAB4818ED5BA220"/>
purpose of establishing a temporary government, to adopt the constitution and laws of <HI>any one of the original states."</HI></P>
<P>"WHEN any such state shall have acquired twenty thousand free inhabitants, on giving due proof thereof to Congress, they <HI>shall receive from</HI> THEM <HI>authority</HI> to call a Convention of representatives, to establish a permanent constitution and government for themselves."</P>
<P>"THE preceding articles," among others, "shall be formed into a CHARTER <HI>of compact,</HI> shall be duly exe∣cuted by the President of the United States in Congress assembled, under his hand and the seal of the United States; shall be promulgated, and shall stand as <HI>funda∣mental Constitutions</HI> between the thirteen original states, and each of the <HI>several states</HI> NOW NEWLY DESCRIBED, unalienable from and after the sale of any part of the territory of such state, but by the <HI>joint</HI> consent of the <HI>United States in Congress assembled,</HI> and <HI>of the particular state</HI> within which such alteration is proposed to be made."</P>
<P>IT will be difficult, I believe, to urge against the power of Congress to grant a charter to the Bank of North-America, any argument, which may not, with equal strength and fitness, be urged against the power of that body to form, execute and promulgate a charter of compact for the <HI>New States.</HI></P>
<P>THE sentiments of the representatives of the United States, as to their power of incorporating the Bank, ought to have much weight with us. Their sentiments are strongly marked by their conduct, in their first reso∣lutions respecting the Bank. These resolutions are made at the <HI>same time,</HI> and on the <HI>same subject:</HI> But there is a <HI>striking difference</HI> in their <HI>manner.</HI> It was thought proper "that no other Bank should be permitted within any of the states, during the war." Congress "RECOMMEND∣ED to the several states to make provision, for that pur∣pose, by proper laws." It was thought prudent that the Bank should be protected, by penal laws, from fraud, embezzlement and forgery. Congress RECOMMENDED it to the several Legislatures to pass such laws. It was
<PB N="14" REF="019388_0013_0FAB4819AD1F73E0"/>
deemed expedient that bank notes should be received in payment of sums payable to the United States: Congress RESOLVE, that the notes "SHALL BE RECEIVABLE" in such payments. It was judged necessary that the Bank should have a charter of incorporation: Congress RE∣SOLVE, that the Bank "SHALL BE INCORPORATED," on application made "TO CONGRESS" for that purpose. The line of distinction between those things in which Congress could only <HI>recommend,</HI> and those in which they could <HI>act,</HI> is drawn in the clearest manner. The incor∣poration of the National Bank is ranked among those things, in which they could <HI>act.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>act</HI> of Congress has, either expresly, or by im∣plication, received the approbation of every state in the union. It was <HI>officially</HI> announced to every state by the Superintendant of Finance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See his letter in the appendix.</HI></NOTE> Had any one state consi∣dered it as an exercise of usurped power, would not that state have remonstrated against it? But there is no such remonstrance.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>act</HI> of Congress has been most explicitly recog∣nised by the Legislature of Pennsylvania. The law for preventing and punishing frauds and cheats upon the Bank was passed on the 18th of March, 1782, and <HI>be∣fore</HI> the Bank had obtained a charter from this state. By that law it is made felony without benefit of clergy, to forge the common seal of the President, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America. Who were the President, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America? Those whom Congress had made "a corporation and body politic, <HI>to all intents and purposes,</HI> BY THAT NAME AND STILE." How came that body by a "common seal?" The act of Congress ordained that that body "should have full power and authority to <HI>make, have</HI> and <HI>use</HI> a COMMON SEAL." In the act to incorpo∣rate the subscribers to the Bank of North-America, the Legislature, after reciting that the United States in Con∣gress assembled had "passed an ordinance to incorpo∣rate them," say, "the President and Directors of the
<PB N="15" REF="019388_0014_0FAB481A6C394DE8"/>
said Bank have applied to this House for a <HI>similar act of incorporation,</HI> which request it is <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>reasonable</HI> to grant."</P>
<P>WHEN the foregoing facts and arguments are consi∣dered, compared and weighed, they will, it is hoped, evince and establish, <HI>satisfactorily to all,</HI> and <HI>conclusively</HI> on the legislature of Pennsylvania, the truth of this posi∣tion—That the Bank of North-America was legally and constitutionally instituted and organised, by the charter of incorporation granted by the United States in Congress assembled.</P>
<P>II. WOULD it, then, be wise or politic in the legisla∣ture of Pennsylvania, to revoke the charter which it has granted to this institution? It would not be wise or po∣litic—</P>
<P>1st. BECAUSE the proceeding would be nugatory. The recall of the charter of Pennsylvania would not re∣peal that of the United States, by which we have proved the Bank to be legally and constitutionally instituted and organised.</P>
<P>2d. BECAUSE, though the legislature may destroy the legislative <HI>operation,</HI> yet it cannot undo the legislative <HI>ac∣knowledgment</HI> of <HI>its own act.</HI> Though a statute be re∣pealed, yet it shews the sense and opinion of the legisla∣ture concerning the subject of it, in the same manner as if it continued in force.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foster,</HI> 394.</NOTE> The legislature declared, in the law, that it was <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>reasonable</HI> to grant the re∣quest of the President and Directors of the Bank, for an act of incorporation similar to the ordinance of Con∣gress: No repeal of the law can weaken the force of that declaration.</P>
<P>3d. BECAUSE such a proceeding would wound that confidence in the engagements of government, which it is so much the interest and duty of every state to encou∣rage and reward. The act in question formed a charter of compact between the Legislature of this state, and the President, Directors and Company of the Bank of North-America. The latter <HI>asked</HI> for nothing but what was
<PB N="16" REF="019388_0015_0FAB481B2CC65F30"/>
<HI>proper</HI> and <HI>reasonable:</HI> The former <HI>granted</HI> nothing but what was <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>reasonable:</HI> The terms of the com∣pact were, therefore, fair and honest: While these terms are observed on one side, the compact cannot, consistent∣ly with the rules of good faith, be departed from on the other.</P>
<P>IT may be asked—Has not the state power over her own laws?—May she not alter, amend, extend, restrain and repeal them at her pleasure?</P>
<P>I AM far from opposing the legislative authority of the state: But it must be observed, that, according to the practice of the legislature, public acts of very <HI>different kinds</HI> are drawn and promulgated under the <HI>same form.</HI> A law to vest or confirm an estate in an individual—a law to incorporate a congregation or other society—a law respecting the rights and properties of all the citizens of the state—are all passed in the same manner; are all cloth∣ed in the same dress of legislative formality; and are all equally acts of the Representatives of the Freemen of the commonwealth. But surely it will not be pretended, that, after laws of those different kinds are passed, the legislature possesses over each the same discretionary power of repeal. In a law respecting the rights and properties of all the citizens of the state, this power may be safely exercised by the legislature. Why? Because, in this case, the interest of those who make the law (the members of Assembly and their constituents) and the interest of those who are to be affected by the law (the members of Assembly and their constituents) is the same. It is a common cause, and may, therefore, be safely trusted to the Representatives of the community. None can hurt another, without, at the same time, hurt∣ing himself. Very different is the case with regard to a law, by which the state grants privileges to a congrega∣tion or other society. Here two parties are instituted, and two distinct interests subsist. Rules of justice, of faith, and of honor, must, therefore, be established be∣tween them: For, if <HI>interest</HI> alone is to be viewed, the congregation or society must always lie at the mercy of
<PB N="17" REF="019388_0016_0FAB481BEBE7A790"/>
the community. Still more different is the case with re∣gard to a law, by which an estate is vested or confirmed in an individual: If, in this case, the legislature may at discretion, and without any reason assigned, divest or de∣stroy his estate, then a person seized of an estate in fee-simple, under legislative sanction, is, in truth, nothing more than a solemn tenant at will.</P>
<P>FOR these reasons, whenever the objects and makers of an instrument, passed under the form of a law, are not the same, it is to be considered as a compact, and to be interpreted according to the rules and maxims, by which compacts are governed. A foreigner is natura∣lized by law: Is he a citizen only during pleasure? He is no more, if, without any cause of forfeiture assigned and established, the law, by which he is naturalized, may at pleasure be repealed. To receive the legislative stamp of stability and permanency, acts of incorporation are applied for from the legislature. If these acts may be repealed without notice, without accusation, without hearing, without proof, without forfeiture; where is the stamp of their stability? Their motto should be, "LEVI∣TY." If the act for incorporating the subscribers to the Bank of North-America shall be repealed in this manner, a precedent will be established for repealing, in the same manner, every other legislative charter in Penn∣sylvania. A pretence, as specious as any that can be al∣ledged on this occasion, will never be wanting on any future occasion. Those acts of the state, which have hitherto been considered as the sure anchors of privilege and of property, will become the sport of every varying gust of politics, and will float wildly backwards and forwards on the irregular and impetuous tides of party and faction.</P>
<P>4th. IT would not be wise or politic to repeal the charter granted by this state to the Bank of North Ame∣rica, because such a measure would operate, as far as it would have any operation, against the credit of the United States, on which the interest of this common∣wealth and her citizens so essentially depends. This in∣stitution
<PB N="18" REF="019388_0017_0FAB481CB00F5458"/>
originated under the auspices of the United States: The subscription to the National Bank was open∣ed under the recommendations and the engagements of Congress: Citizens of this state, and of the other states, and foreigners, have become stock-holders, on the public faith: The United States have pledged themselves <Q>to promote and support the institution by such ways and means, from time to time, as may appear necessary for it, and consistent with the public good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">26<HI>th May,</HI> 1781.</NOTE></Q> They have recommended to the legislature of <HI>each</HI> state, <Q>to pass such laws as they might judge necessary for giving the ordinance incorporating the Bank its full operation.</Q> Pennsylvania has entered fully into the views, the recom∣mendations, and the measures of Congress respecting the Bank. She has declared in the strongest manner her sense of their <HI>propriety,</HI> their <HI>reasonableness,</HI> and their <HI>ne∣cessity:</HI> She has passed laws for giving them their full operation. Will it redound to the credit of the United States to adopt and pursue a contrary system of conduct? The acts and recommendations of Congress subsist still in all their original force: Will it not have a tendency to shake all confidence in the councils and proceedings of the United States, if those acts and recommendations are now disregarded, without any reason shewn for dis∣regarding them? What influence will such a proceeding have upon the opinions and sentiments of the citizens of the United States and of foreigners? In one year they see measures respecting an object of confessed public im∣portance adopted and recommended with ardour by Con∣gress; and the views and wishes of that body zealously pursued by Pennsylvania: In another year they see those very measures, without any apparent reason for the change, warmly reprobated by that state: They must con∣clude one of two things:—That Congress adopted and recommended those measures hastily and without consi∣deration; or that Pennsylvania has reprobated them un∣dutifully and disrespectfully. The former conclusion will give rise to very unfavourable reflections concerning the
<PB N="19" REF="019388_0018_0FAB481E19D841B8"/>
discernment both of the state and of the United States: The latter will suggest very inauspicious sentiments con∣cerning the foederal disposition and character of this com∣monwealth. The result of the conclusion will be—that the United States does not deserve, or that they will not receive, support in their system of finance.—These deductions and inferences will have particular weight, as they will be grounded on the conduct of Pennsylvania, hitherto one of the most foederal, active and affectionate states in the union.</P>
<P>5th. IT would not be wise or politic in the legislature to repeal her charter to the Bank; because the tendency of such a step would be to deprive this state and the United States of all the advantages, public and private, which would flow from the institution, in times of war, and in times of peace.</P>
<P>LET us turn our attention to some of the most material advantages resulting from a Bank.</P>
<P>1st. IT increases circulation, and invigorates industry. "It is not, says Dr. Smith, in his Treatise on the Wealth of Nations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1, <HI>p.</HI> 383, 384.</NOTE> by augmenting the capital of the country, but by rendering a greater part of that capital active and productive than would otherwise be so, that the most judicious operations of banking can increase the industry of the country. The part of his capital which a dealer is obliged to keep by him unemployed, and in ready money, for answering occasional demands, is so much dead stock, which, so long as it remains in this situation, produces nothing either to him or to his country. The judicious operations of banking enable him to convert this dead stock into active and productive stock; into materials to work upon, into tools to work with, and into provisions and subsistence to work for; into stock which produces something both to himself and to his country. The gold and silver money which circu∣lates in any country, and by means of which the produce of its land and labour is annually circulated and distri∣buted to the proper consumers, is, in the same manner
<PB N="20" REF="019388_0019_0FAB481E2C6B0860"/>
as the ready money of the dealer, all dead stock. It is a very valuable part of the capital of the country, which produces nothing to the country. The judicious opera∣tions of banking, by substituting paper in the room of a great part of this gold and silver, enables the country to convert a great part of this dead stock into active and productive stock; into stock which produces something to the country. The gold and silver money which cir∣culates in any country may very properly be compared to a highway, which, while it circulates and carries to market all the grass and corn of the country, produces, itself, not a single pile of either. The judicious opera∣tions of banking, by providing, if I may be allowed so violent a metaphor, a sort of waggon-way through the air, enable the country to convert, as it were, a great part of its highways into good pasture and corn-fields, and thereby to increase very considerably the annual pro∣duce of its land and labour."</P>
<P>THE same sensible writer informs us, in another place, that "the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1, <HI>p.</HI> 434, 435.</NOTE> substitution of paper in the room of gold and silver money, replaces a very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly, and sometimes equally convenient. Circulation comes to be carried on by a new wheel, which it costs less both to erect and to maintain than the old one.—There are several sorts of paper money; but the circulating notes of banks and bankers is the species which is best known, and which seems best adapted for this purpose."—<HI>"These notes come to have the same currency as gold and silver money,</HI> FROM THE CONFIDENCE THAT SUCH MONEY CAN AT ANY TIME BE HAD FOR THEM."</P>
<P>SIR James Stewart calls banking "the great engine,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 350.</NOTE> by which domestic circulation is carried on."</P>
<P>TO HAVE a free, easy and equable instrument of cir∣culation is of much importance in all countries: It is of <HI>peculiar</HI> importance in young and flourishing countries, in which the demands for credit, and the rewards of in∣dustry, are greater than in any other. When we view the
<PB N="21" REF="019388_0020_0FAB481EED0A1720"/>
extent and situation of the United States, we shall be satisfied that their inhabitants may, for a long time to come, employ profitably, in the improvement of their lands, a greater stock than they will be able easily to procure. In such a situation, it will always be of great service to them to save as much as possible the expence of so costly an instrument of commerce as gold and silver, to substitute in its place one cheaper, and, for many pur∣poses, not less convenient; and to convert the value of the gold and silver into the labour and the materials ne∣cessary for improving and extending their settlements and plantations.</P>
<P>"To the Banks of Scotland, says Sir James Stewart,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 356.</NOTE> the improvement of that country is entirely owing; and until they are generally established in other countries of Europe, where trade and industry are little known, it will be very difficult to set those great engines to work."</P>
<P>2d. THE influence of a Bank on credit is no less salu∣tary than its influence on circulation. This position is, indeed, little more than a corollary from the former. CREDIT IS CONFIDENCE; and, before we can place confidence in a payment, we must be convinced that he who is to make it will be both able and willing to do so at the time stipulated. However unexceptionable his character and fortune may be, this conviction can never take place, unless in a country where solid property can be, at any time, turned into a circulating medium.</P>
<P>3d. TRADE, as well as circulation and credit, de∣rives great support and assistance from a Bank. Credit and circulation produce punctuality; and punctuality is the soul of commerce. Let us appeal to experience as well as reason.</P>
<P>DR. SMITH says,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1, <HI>p.</HI> 442.</NOTE> he has heard it asserted, that the trade of the city of Glasgow doubled in about fifteen years after the first erection of the Banks there; and that the trade of Scotland has more than quadrupled since the first erection of the two public Banks at Edinburgh, of which one was established in 1695, and the other in
<PB N="22" REF="019388_0021_0FAB481FB0635440"/>
1727. Whether the increase has been in so great a pro∣portion, the author pretends not to know. But that the trade of Scotland has increased very considerably during this period, and that the Banks have contributed a good deal to this increase, cannot, he says, be doubted.</P>
<P>THESE observations, and observations similar to these, have induced Sir James Stewart to conclude.—that "Banking,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 358.</NOTE> in the age we live, is that branch of credit which best deserves the attention of a statesman. Upon the right establishment of Banks depends the prosperity of <HI>trade,</HI> and the equable course of circulation. By them, SOLID PROPERTY MAY BE MELTED DOWN. By the means of Banks, money may be constantly kept at a due proportion to alienation. If alienation increases, more property may be melted down. If it diminishes, the quantity of money stagnating will be absorbed by the Bank, and part of the property formerly melted down in the securities granted to them will be, as it were, consolidated anew. These must pay, for the country, the balance of their trade with foreign nations: These keep the mints at work: And it is BY THESE MEANS, PRINCIPALLY, THAT PRIVATE, MERCANTILE, AND PUBLIC CREDIT IS SUPPORTED."</P>
<P>I MAKE no apology for the number and length of the quotations here used. They are from writers of great information, profound judgment, and unquestioned can∣dour. They appear strictly and strongly applicable to my subject: And being so, should carry with them the greatest weight and influence: For the sentiments, which they contain and inculcate, must be considered as result∣ing from <HI>general</HI> principles and facts, and not as calcu∣lated for any <HI>partial</HI> purpose in this commonwealth.</P>
<P>BUT, here, it will probably be asked—Has your rea∣soning been verified by experience in this country? What advantages have resulted from the Bank to commerce, circulation and credit? Was our trade ever on such an undesirable footing? Is not the country distressed by the
<PB N="23" REF="019388_0022_0FAB48206CBEA6A0"/>
want of a circulating medium? Is not credit almost to∣tally destroyed?</P>
<P>I ANSWER—There is, unfortunately, too much truth in the representation: But if events are properly distin∣guished, and traced to their causes, it will be found—that none of the inconveniences above-mentioned have arisen from the Bank—that some of them have proceed∣ed, at least in part, from the opposition which has been given to it—and that, as to others, its energy has not been sufficient to counteract or controul them.</P>
<P>THE disagreeable state of our commerce has been the effect of extravagant and injudicious importation. Du∣ring the war, our ports were in a great measure blocked up. Imported articles were scarce and dear; and we felt the disadvantages of a stagnation in business. Extremes frequently introduce one another. When hostilities cea∣sed, the flood-gates of commerce were opened; and an inundation of foreign manufactures overflowed the Unit∣ed States: We seemed to have forgot, that to pay was as necessary in trade as to purchase; and we observed no proportion between our imports, and our produce and other natural means of remittance. What was the con∣sequence? Those who made any payments made them chiefly in specie; and in that way diminished our circu∣lation. Others made no remittances at all, and thereby injured our credit. This account of what happened be∣tween the European merchants and our importers, cor∣responds exactly with what happened between our im∣porters and the retailers spread over the different parts of the United States. The retailers, if they paid at all, paid in specie. And thus every operation, foreign and domestic, had an injurious effect on our credit, our cir∣culation, and our commerce. But are any of these dis∣advantages to be ascribed to the Bank? No. Is it to be accounted a fault or defect in the Bank, that it did not prevent or remedy those disadvantages? By no means. Because one is not able to stem a torrent, is he therefore to be charged with augmenting its strength? The Bank has had many difficulties to encounter. The experiment
<PB N="24" REF="019388_0023_0FAB48212CE76C20"/>
was a new one in this country: It was therefore neces∣sary that it should be conducted with caution. While the war continued, the demands of the public were great; and the stock of the Bank was but inconsidera∣ble: It had its active enemies, and its timid friends. Soon after the peace was concluded, its operations were restrained and embarrassed by an attempt to establish a new Bank. A year had not elapsed after this, when the measure, which has occasioned these Considerations, was introduced into the legislature, and caused, for some time▪ a total stagnation in the business of the institu∣tion. When all these circumstances are recollected and attended to, it will be matter of surprize that the Bank has done so much, and not that it has done no more. Let it be deemed, as it ought to be, the object of public confidence, and not of public jealousy: Let it be encou∣raged, instead of being opposed, by the counsels and proceedings of the state: Then will the genuine effects of the institution appear; then will they spread their auspicious influence over Agriculture, Manufactures and Commerce.</P>
<P>4th. ANOTHER advantage to be expected from the Bank of North-America is, the establishment of an un∣depreciating paper currency through the United States. This is an object of great consequence, whether it be considered in a political, or in a commercial view. It will be found to have a happy effect on the collection, the distribution, and the management of the public re∣venue: It will remove the inconveniences and fluctua∣tion attending exchange and remittances between the different states. "It is the interest of every trading state to have a sufficient quantity of paper, well secured, to circulate through it, so as to facilitate payments every where, and to cut off inland exchanges, which are a great clog upon trade, and are attended with the risque of receiving the paper of people, whose credit is but doubtful."—<HI>Political Oeconomy, vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 415.</P>
<P>SUCH are the advantages which may be expected to flow from a <HI>National Bank,</HI> in times of peace. In times
<PB N="25" REF="019388_0024_0FAB4821EC29C170"/>
of war, the institution may be considered as <HI>essential.</HI> We have seen that, without it, the business of the Depart∣ment of Finance could not have been carried on in the late war. It will be of use to recollect the situation of the United States with regard to this subject. The two or three first years of the war were sufficient to convince the British government, and the British armies, that they could not subdue the United States by military force. Their hopes of success rested on the failure of our fi∣nances. This was the source of our fears, as well as of the hopes of our enemies. By this thread our fate was suspended. We watched it with anxiety: We saw it stretched and weakened every hour: The deathful in∣strument was ready to fall upon our heads: On our heads it must have fallen, had not public credit, in the moment when it was about to break asunder, been en∣twined and supported by the credit of the Bank. Con∣gress, to speak without metaphors, had not money or credit to hire an express, or purchase a cord of wood. General Washington, on one occasion, and probably more than one, saw his army <HI>literally unable to march.</HI> Our distress was such, that it would have been destruc∣tion to have divulged it: But it ought to be known <HI>now;</HI> and when known, ought to have its proper influ∣ence on the public mind and the public conduct.</P>
<P>THE expences of a war must be defrayed, either—1st, by treasures previously accumulated—or 2dly, by supplies levied and collected within the year, as they are called for—or 3dly, by the anticipation of the public revenues. No one will venture to refer us to the first mode. To the second the United States, as well as eve∣ry state in Europe, are rendered incompetent by the mo∣dern system of war, which, in the military operations of <HI>one</HI> year, concenters the revenue of <HI>many.</HI> While our enemies adhere to this system, we must adopt it. The anticipation of revenue, then, is the only mode, by which the expences of a future war can be defrayed. How the revenues of the United States can be anticipa∣ted without the operations of a National Bank, I leave
<PB N="26" REF="019388_0025_0FAB4822ACB97298"/>
to those who attack the Bank of North-America to shew. They ought to be well prepared to shew it; for they must know, that to be incapable of supporting a war is but a single step from being involved in one.</P>
<P>THE result of the whole, under this head, is,—that in times of peace, the National Bank will be <HI>highly advantageous;</HI> that in times of war, it will be <HI>essen∣tially necessary,</HI>—to the United States.</P>
<P>I FLATTER myself, that I have evinced the <HI>validity</HI> and the <HI>utility</HI> of the institution.</P>
<P>IT HAS been surmised, that the design of the legisla∣ture is not to destroy, but to modify, the charter of the Bank; and that if the Directors would assent to reason∣able amendments, the charter, modified, might conti∣nue in force. If this is the case, surely to repeal the law incorporating the Bank is not the proper mode of doing the business. The Bank was established and or∣ganised under the authority and auspices of Congress. The Directors have a trust and duty to discharge to the United States, and to all the particular States, each of which has an equal interest in the Bank. They could not have received, from this state, a charter, unless it had been <HI>similar</HI> to that granted by Congress. Without the approbation of Congress, where all the states are re∣presented, the Directors would not be justified in agree∣ing to any alteration of the institution. If alterations are necessary; they should be made through the channel of the United States in Congress assembled.</P>

<HEAD>An ORDINANCE, to incorporate the SUBSCRI∣BERS to the BANK of NORTH-AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS Congress, on the twenty-sixth day of May last, did, from a conviction of the sup∣port which the finances of the United States would re∣ceive from the establishment of a National Bank, approve a plan for such an institution, submitted to their conside∣ration by Robert Morris, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and now lodged among the archives of Congress, and did engage to promote the same by the most effectual means: AND WHERE∣AS the subscription thereto is now filled, from an ex∣pectation of a charter of incorporation from Congress, the Directors and President are chosen, and application hath been made to Congress, by the said President and Directors, for an act of incorporation: AND WHERE∣AS the exigencies of the United States render it indis∣pensably necessary that such an act be immediately passed:</P>

<P><HI>And be it further ordained,</HI> That for the well govern∣ing of the said corporation, and the ordering of their affairs, they shall have such officers as they shall here∣after direct or appoint: <HI>Provided nevertheless,</HI> That twelve Directors, one of whom shall be the President of the corporation, be of the number of their officers.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to transmit herewith an Ordi∣nance, passed by the United States in Congress as∣sembled the 31st day of December, 1781, incorporating the subscribers to the Bank of North-America, together with sundry resolutions, recommending to the several states to pass such laws as they may judge necessary for giving the said Ordinance its full operation. The reso∣lutions of the 26th of May last speak so clearly to the points necessary to be established by those laws, that I need not enlarge on them. Should any thing more be found necessary upon experience, the President and Di∣rectors will no doubt make suitable applications to Con∣gress, or to the states respectively, as the case may require. It affords me great satisfaction to inform your Excellency, that this Bank commenced its operations yesterday; and I am confident, that with proper ma∣nagement it will answer the most sanguine expectations of those who befriend the institution. It will facilitate the management of the finances of the United States: The several States may, when their respective necessities re∣quire, and the abilities of the Bank will permit, derive
<PB N="30" REF="019388_0029_0FAB4825F1DDEE20"/>
occasional advantage and accommodations from it: It will afford to the individuals of all the states, a medium for their intercourse with each other, and for the pay∣ment of taxes, more convenient than the precious me∣tals, and equally safe: It will have a tendency to increase both the internal and external commerce of North-Ame∣rica, and undoubtedly will be infinitely useful to all the traders of every state in the union: Provided, as I have already said, it is conducted on the principles of equity, justice, prudence and oeconomy. The present Directors bear characters that cannot fail to inspire confidence; and as the corporation is amenable to the laws, power can neither sanctify any improper conduct, nor protect the guilty. Under a full conviction of these things, I flatter myself that I shall stand excused for recommend∣ing, in the strongest manner, this well meant plan, to all the encouragement and protection which your state can give, consistently with wisdom and justice. I have the honor to be, with great respect,</P>
