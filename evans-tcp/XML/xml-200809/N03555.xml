<HEAD>THE NATURE OF <HI>Religious Compulsion.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>LUKE xiv. 23.</HI></BIBL>
<P>—Compel them to come in.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was a common Thing with our <HI>Saviour,</HI> to discourse to his Hearers in <HI>parabolical</HI> Language: And his View herein (at least in Part) might be to accommodate himself to their Capacities, and take greater Hold on their Hearts; For there is no Way of Speaking, that more easily and familiarly conveys Truth into the Mind, or more strongly impresses it there.</P>
<P>The Words I have selected to employ our present Meditations, are Part of the <HI>Parable of the Supper:</HI> Concerning which, it may suffice to observe in general,
<PB N="2" REF="004349_0004_10044F8F80F82B40"/>
That the Blessings of the <HI>Gospel-State</HI> are here com∣pared to a <HI>Supper</HI>: The Persons <HI>firstly</HI> invited to it were the <HI>Jews</HI>; but these making light of the In∣vitation, and excusing themselves from an Attendance at it, the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were then called in, the Gentiles of <HI>all Sorts and Kinds</HI>; and this, while the <HI>Jews</HI> were left under that Blindness of Mind and Hardness of Heart, in which they continue to this Day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Text</HI> falls in that Part of the Parable, which concerns the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; and is a Command to <HI>enforce</HI> their Acceptance of the <HI>Gospel Offer of Mercy,</HI> with all the Methods of <HI>Perswasion,</HI> with all the <HI>Motives</HI> and <HI>Arguments,</HI> suited to work upon the <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Understanding</HI> of Men. Says our Lord to the Ser∣vant, <HI>Compel them to come in</HI>: In discoursing to which Words, I shall do two Things.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Explain to you the Meaning of that Compulsion, which our Saviour here recommends.</HI> And then,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Do the Duty enjoin'd the Servant in the Text, by endeavouring to compel you to come in, and partake of the Gospel Supper.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I am to explain to you the Meaning of that Compulsion, which our Saviour here recommends.</HI> Says he to the Servant in my Text, <HI>Compel them to come in.</HI> But what are we to understand by this <HI>Compul∣sion?</HI> Of what <HI>Sort of Compulsion</HI> does our Lord speak?</P>
<P>Now, 'tis plain, he here speaks, not of <HI>physical,</HI> but <HI>moral</HI> Compulsion; not of Compulsion by <HI>outward Vio∣lence,</HI> but <HI>internal Persuasion</HI>; that which is effected, not by <HI>Fines, Imprisonments, Racks</HI> and <HI>Tortures,</HI> but by Application to the <HI>Understandings</HI> of Men. The
<PB N="3" REF="004349_0005_10044FC44CD552F8"/>
<HI>Compulsion,</HI> our Saviour intends, is of that Kind, which the <HI>Mind of</HI> Man is capable of, and is sutable to it as <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>intelligent</HI>: And this is Compulsion by <HI>sound Reasoning, good Argument.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Compel them to come in</HI>; 'Tis is if our Lord had said, Argue with them about coming in to the Gospel Kingdom; apply to their Reason and Conscience; inform their Understanding; convince their Judg∣ment; make Use of those Persuasions, lay before them those Motives and Arguments, which will leave them inexcusable, if they are not wro't upon; if they are not, in the <HI>moral</HI> Sense, <HI>compelled to come in.</HI></P>
<P>This is the plain Meaning of the Phrase; nor is its Sense at all difficult or perplext: And yet, as if Men had a Design to misunderstand our Saviour, they have taken Occasion from this, and such like Texts, to in∣troduce <HI>that Sort</HI> of Compulsion into Religion, which can never be justified, either by <HI>Reason</HI> or <HI>Revelation.</HI></P>
<P>This is particularly true of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> who interpret my Text as a <HI>Divine Warrant</HI> to make Use of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Violence</HI> in the Affairs of <HI>Conscience</HI> and <HI>Salvation.</HI> Instead of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI>; at least, together with it, they suppose our Saviour means <HI>Fire and Faggot</HI>: And if this is what he had in View, they have, it must be acknowledged, most punctually comply'd with his Command; as not having omitted any Kind of <HI>outward Violence,</HI> however barbarous and inhumane. But 'tis impossible our Saviour should have had it in his Thoughts to recommend <HI>this Sort</HI> of Compulsion: To be sure, if we may judge, either from <HI>his Example,</HI> the <HI>Nature of his Gospel,</HI> or indeed from the <HI>Reason of Things,</HI> this was one of the last Methods he would ever have recommended.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004349_0006_1004441DB3B46F58"/>As for the <HI>Example of Christ,</HI> this was ever against the <HI>Use of Force</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Conscience.</HI> He never compelled Men to embrace his Gospel; never made Use of the Art (which has since been found out▪ and so often put in Practice) of enlight∣ning Men's Consciences, by <HI>fining their Estates,</HI> or <HI>imprisoning their Persons,</HI> or <HI>abusing their Bodies</HI>; ty∣ing them to the <HI>Whipping-Post, Gibbet</HI> or <HI>Gallows.</HI> He did not go about, in any of these Methods of Force, to propagate his Religion; but in the <HI>gentle Methods of Persuasion.</HI> That was his Manner in making <HI>Pro∣selytes</HI> to his Religion, <HI>If any Man will, let him be my Disciple. If any Man will, let him follow me. Will ye also go away?</HI> He used Violence with no Man; but applied to all, in a Way suited to their <HI>Make as Men</HI>: Reasoning the Case with them, of∣fering Light to their Understandings, and Conviction to their Consciences; but after all, leaving it to their own <HI>free Choice,</HI> whether they would reject or re∣ceive Him and his Gospel.</P>
<P>And 'tis remarkable, when his Disciples, in a Fit of <HI>religious Zeal,</HI> would have call'd for <HI>Fire from Hea∣ven,</HI> to destroy those who would not receive him, he very seasonably gave a Check to it; informing them, how contrary <HI>such a Spirit and Conduct</HI> was, to the Design of his coming, which was <HI>to save, not to de∣stroy Men's Lives.</HI> Says the <HI>Evangelist Luke,</HI> who gives the Account of this Matter, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> xix. 55, 56.</NOTE> <HI>He turned, and re∣buked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of. For the Son of Man is not come to destroy Men's Lives, but to save them.</HI> Our Lord, you see, with a greater Severity than ordinary, corrected
<PB N="5" REF="004349_0007_10044FC8D6329A18"/>
this <HI>burning Zeal</HI> of his Disciples; and this; though it was a <HI>religious Zeal</HI>; and the <HI>Object</HI> of it, those who rejected and despised, both Him and his Doctrine. And he ever discountenanc'd <HI>religious Fu∣ry and Rage,</HI> in all the Acts and Instances of it: To be sure, he did so by his <HI>Example</HI>; for he ne∣ver once, in his whole Life, did any Thing that lookt like <HI>persecuting</HI> Men for Religion. So far from it, that he was always calm and peaceable, and treated even his greatest Opposers with all Meekness and Mildness. His Concern was to serve the Interest of Men's Souls; and if he could do this in the Methods proper to be used with Men, i. e. by <HI>Persuasion</HI> and <HI>Argument,</HI> he was not wanting in his Endeavours: but he would not make Use of <HI>Force,</HI> nor in a <HI>com∣pulsive</HI> Way have any Thing to do with them.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Gospel of Christ</HI> as little favours the Use of <HI>Violence</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion</HI> as his Example: Yea, the <HI>Use of Force</HI> is absolutely inconsistent with the <HI>Nature of that Kingdom,</HI> the Gospel was intended to set on Foot in the World. So speaks our Saviour in those express Words, John xviii. 36. <HI>My Kingdom is not of this World.</HI> i. e. 'Tis not like <HI>earthly</HI> King∣doms and Monarchies, which are establish'd with a View to Men's <HI>worldly</HI> Happiness, and are accordingly supported and guarded with <HI>worldly</HI> Sanctions: But 'tis a Kingdom of a quite different Kind, a Kingdom that is <HI>spiritual,</HI> having to do with Men's <HI>Souls,</HI> not their <HI>Bodies</HI>; with their <HI>eternal,</HI> not their <HI>temporal</HI> Con∣cerns: And being a Kingdom thus <HI>spiritual</HI> in its Nature and Design, its <HI>Sanctions</HI> are of the <HI>same Kind</HI>; its <HI>Weapons not carnal,</HI> but <HI>spiritual</HI>: It exercises no Dominion over Men's <HI>Estates</HI> or <HI>Bodies</HI>; it makes no Use of <HI>secular Force.</HI> For so it follows in the next Words, <HI>If my Kingdom were of this World, then
<PB N="6" REF="004349_0008_10049D4E4B73CEF8"/>
would my Servants fight.</HI> i. e. they would, in a <HI>Way of Force,</HI> defend my Person and my Doctrine: But, as a sure Evidence of the Truth of what I have said, that <HI>my Kingdom is not like the Kingdoms of this World,</HI> my Subjects and Servants make Use of none of the Methods of <HI>Hostility</HI> and <HI>Violence</HI>: Or if they do, 'tis not with <HI>my Approbation,</HI> they act not by <HI>Com∣mission</HI> from me. And indeed, so far was our Savi∣our from encouraging the Subjects of his Kingdom, to do any Thing in a Way of <HI>external Violence,</HI> tho' it were in <HI>Protection</HI> even of <HI>his very Person,</HI> that when one of them, upon such an Occasion, <HI>drew his Sword,</HI> he instantly gave forth his Command, <HI>Put up again thy Sword into his Place</HI>; and added upon it, in those solemn Words, <HI>All they that take the Sword, shall perish with the Sword</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xxvi. 52.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nor is the <HI>Use of Force</HI> in <HI>religious</HI> Matters less contrary to the <HI>Gospel Precepts,</HI> than it is to the <HI>Na∣ture of the Gospel Kingdom</HI>: Nay, such a Method of dealing with Men is contrary to what runs thro' the whole Gospel, as its peculiar and distinguishing Spirit and Genius. That of <HI>loving one another,</HI> of loving even <HI>all Men, Enemies</HI> as well as <HI>Friends,</HI> those who <HI>embrace Error</HI> as well as those who <HI>believe the Truth</HI>; yea, <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Infidels,</HI> as well as <HI>Christians,</HI> is the <HI>Commandment of the Gospel,</HI> by Way of <HI>Emi∣nence</HI> and <HI>Distinction.</HI> Says our Lord, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xv. 12.</NOTE> <HI>This is</HI> MY COMMANDMENT, <HI>that ye love one another.</HI> And again, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xiii. 34.</NOTE> <HI>A</HI> NEW COMMANDMENT <HI>I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</HI> And again, <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot"><HI>V</HI> 35.</NOTE> <HI>By this shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have Love one to another.</HI> Men of all Professions and Religions are
<PB N="7" REF="004349_0009_10044FCA6A8E7C48"/>
known by some <HI>peculiar Badge</HI> and <HI>Character,</HI> So the <HI>Jews</HI> were distinguish'd by their Adherence to the <HI>Law of Moses</HI>; and the <HI>Pharisees</HI> among the Jews, by their <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Separation</HI> from other Men: But our Saviour would have his Disciples known and distinguish'd by their <HI>Benignity of Temper,</HI> their <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI>; expressing it self in all the Acts of true Kindness and Beneficence. And he requires it of <HI>Christians,</HI> so far to exceed all others in all the In∣stances of <HI>real Love</HI> and <HI>Benevolence,</HI> as that this may be a <HI>Characteristick,</HI> a <HI>Mark</HI> by which to distinguish them from all other Men: So contrary is all <HI>Ha∣tred</HI> and <HI>Strife,</HI> all <HI>uncharitable</HI> and <HI>ill treating</HI> one another, to the <HI>Precepts</HI> of the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>It may perhaps be pretended, 'tis from <HI>true Charity</HI> to Men, a <HI>Love</HI> to their <HI>Souls,</HI> a <HI>real Concern</HI> for their <HI>eternal Interest,</HI> that the <HI>Methods of Violence</HI> are used with them, that they are called to undergo Hard∣ships and Sufferings in their <HI>Bodies</HI> or <HI>Estates.</HI> But the Gospel knows of no such Methods of Love and Charity: Nor is it <HI>Love</HI> to Men's <HI>Souls</HI>; but the <HI>Love of this World,</HI> the <HI>Love of Power,</HI> the Love of <HI>Tyranny over Men's Consciences,</HI> that puts Men upon the <HI>Methods of Force,</HI> to bring others to be of the same Profession and Principles with themselves. What the Scripture says of the <HI>Wisdom,</HI> is as true of <HI>the Love, that is from above,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>James</HI> iii. 17.</NOTE> <HI>It is first pure, then peace∣able, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits.</HI> And that ought always to be the Character of those, who call themselves the Servants of God, <HI>They strive not, but are gentle to all Men, patient; In Meekness instructing those who oppose them∣selves,
<PB N="8" REF="004349_0010_10044F910AF9C8B0"/>
if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii, 24, 25.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This is the Temper and Conduct, which the Gos∣pel requires in Matters of Religion. Its Precepts are directly calculated to encourage and promote Peace and Good-will among Men: Nor can any Thing be more opposite to the <HI>Design</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Christian Religion, than for Men to bite and devour one another, injure and male-treat each other: Nor does it at all alter the Case, tho' they should do this under the Pretext of <HI>Zeal for God,</HI> or the most <HI>passionate Concern for the Salvation of Souls.</HI></P>
<P>We ought, 'tis true, to have near our Heart the <HI>Glory of God,</HI> and the <HI>spiritual and eternal Good</HI> of our friends and Neighbours; yea, of all Men: But we are much mistaken, if we imagine, that we can either do <HI>Honour to God,</HI> or <HI>Service to the Souls of Men,</HI> in the Methods of <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Cla∣mour</HI>: No, our Concern for the <HI>spiritual</HI> Good of others ought principally to express it self, in <HI>instructing those who are out of the Way, and oppose the Truth,</HI> not, as <HI>Gideon</HI> did the Men of <HI>Succoth,</HI> with <HI>Briers and Thorns</HI>; but with <HI>Meekness of Wisdom.</HI> For <HI>An∣ger resteth in the Bosom of Fools,</HI> as the <HI>wise Man</HI> speaks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eccles. <HI>vii. 9.</HI></NOTE>: And, as the <HI>Apostle</HI> observes, <HI>The Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteousness of God</HI><NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">James <HI>i. 20.</HI></NOTE>. If we are fierce and furious, and of a Temper disposing and engaging us, to <HI>convert Men's Souls</HI> by <HI>abusing their Bodies,</HI> we are in an <HI>exceeding bad</HI> Frame of Mind. For <HI>Zeal without Charity,</HI> a Zeal that would put us upon calling for <HI>Fire from Heaven,</HI> or the <HI>Sword from
<PB N="9" REF="004349_0011_10044FCEEC40DB80"/>
the Earth,</HI> to destroy Men's <HI>Bodies,</HI> for the good of their <HI>Souls,</HI> is as opposite to the Gospel, as contradictory to its great and fundamental Precepts, as any Thing we would rectify, that we suppose to be amiss in others.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Use of Force,</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Conscience,</HI> is not only contrary to the <HI>Example of Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Precepts of his Gospel</HI>; but to the <HI>Na∣ture and Reason of Things.</HI> 'Tis in it self a Method altogether unsuted to Work upon the Minds of Men. For whatever Influence it may have upon their <HI>Bo∣dies,</HI> it can have none on their <HI>Souls.</HI> It conveys no Light into the Mind; it brings no Conviction to the Judgment and Conscience; it effects no Alteration in Men's Thoughts and Sentiments: But after all that can be done, in a <HI>Way of Compulsion,</HI> Men's Minds will be the same; they will entertain the same Thot's; the same Notions and Principles; and will, in the <HI>moral</HI> Sense, remain just the same Persons. Nor is there the least Sutableness in <HI>external Force</HI> to move the <HI>Soul,</HI> in any of its rational Operations: Yea, it is as absurd and ridiculous to make Use of <HI>Force</HI> to affect the <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Conscience,</HI> as it would be to make Use of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI> to affect the <HI>bodily Senses. Force</HI> is proper to the <HI>Body, Reason</HI> to the <HI>Mind:</HI> And 'tis plainly an inverting the Order of Nature, to make Use of that with Reference to the <HI>Soul,</HI> which is adapted, in its Use, only to the <HI>Body</HI>: Nor let Men use what <HI>Violence</HI> they please, will it have the least Influence upon Men, to make them <HI>truly religious.</HI> It may put them upon making an <HI>outside Appearance</HI> in Religion, i. e. It may make them <HI>Hy∣pocrites,</HI> it may make them <HI>deal deceitfully</HI> both with <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> and often does so; but it can never make them <HI>good Christians.</HI> It may put them upon
<PB N="10" REF="004349_0012_10044F95DF79BD40"/>
<HI>professing with their Mouths,</HI> or <HI>worshipping with their Bodies,</HI> as those, in whose Power they are, would have them; but there is no Value, <HI>religiously speaking,</HI> in such <HI>Professions</HI> and <HI>Worship:</HI> Nor indeed is there the least <HI>true Religion</HI> in any of those Actions that are the Result, not of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Conscience,</HI> but of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Violence.</HI></P>
<P>Not but that Men may, consistent with Reason, be <HI>restrained</HI> from <HI>these</HI> or <HI>those vicious Practices.</HI> The <HI>civil</HI> Good of Society may make <HI>such Restraints</HI> ne∣cessary: And whenever it does so, they are <HI>reasonable</HI>; Men ought to be laid under them. Bat then it must, at the same Time, be remembred, there is <HI>no Religi∣on</HI> in their abstaining from <HI>these</HI> or <HI>those Vices,</HI> while their abstaining from them is the Effect of <HI>external Force.</HI> As Men are <HI>rational, free Agents,</HI> they can't be <HI>religious</HI> but with the <HI>free Consent of their Wills</HI>; and this can be gain'd in no Way, but that of <HI>Rea∣son</HI> and <HI>Persuasion. Compulsion</HI> is of no Significancy here. It has no Influence to <HI>persuade</HI> the <HI>Will</HI>; but rather the <HI>contrary</HI>: Nor was any Man ever <HI>forc'd</HI> to be <HI>religious.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, even <HI>God</HI> himself does not, in <HI>this Way,</HI> go about to make Men religious. He uses <HI>Violence</HI> with no Man; <HI>forces</HI> no One, contrary to his Will, to betake himself to a religious Course. Whenever he <HI>draws</HI> Men to a Life of Holiness, 'tis with <HI>the Cords of a Man, and with the Bands of Love.</HI> i. e. in a Way suted to their Character as <HI>Men</HI>; in a Way adapted to their Make as <HI>free Agents.</HI> He does not make Use of the <HI>Methods of Force,</HI> turning Men from <HI>Sin</HI> to <HI>himself,</HI> whether they <HI>will,</HI> or no; but so manages the Affair, as to gain the <HI>free</HI> and <HI>full Con∣sent
<PB N="11" REF="004349_0013_10044451D77E9278"/>
of their Wills.</HI> He opens the <HI>Eyes</HI> of their <HI>Mind,</HI> and gives them to see the Ugliness of Sin, the Beauty of Holiness, the Need they stand in of Christ, his Sufficiency and infinite Readiness to be a Saviour to them; and he gives them such a Sight of these Things, such an Apprehension and Persuasion of them, as they never had before: And having thus removed <HI>the Ignorance that was in them, through the Blindness of their Mind,</HI> he persuades and enables them to <HI>chuse</HI> and <HI>act,</HI> according to the Dictates of their <HI>enlightned Understanding.</HI> And so, the whole of what he does, is in a Way suted to their Character, as Creatures endowed with <HI>Reason,</HI> and a Capacity of making a <HI>free Choice.</HI></P>
<P>And this is the <HI>only Way,</HI> in which <HI>Men</HI> ought to be dealt with. 'Tis the Way that is suted to their Nature; 'tis the Way which infinite Wisdom thinks proper to take with them: And to leave this Way, and go into that of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Compulsion,</HI> — there's no Foundation for it in the <HI>Reason of Things;</HI> 'tis altogether <HI>absurd</HI> and <HI>inconsistent.</HI></P>
<P>And thus we have seen, what that <HI>Compulsion</HI> is, which our Saviour recommends in the <HI>Text</HI>; that it is not a <HI>physical,</HI> but <HI>moral</HI> Compulsion: A Compul∣sion not by <HI>outward Force,</HI> but <HI>internal Persuasion</HI>; a Compulsion by <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Argument,</HI> which is the <HI>only Compulsion,</HI> that is proper to be used with <HI>Men,</HI> who are <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>free Agents.</HI></P>
<P>And now, considering what has been said, how con∣trary <HI>external Force</HI> is to the <HI>Example of Christ,</HI> to the <HI>Gospel of Christ,</HI> and to the <HI>Reason of Things,</HI> way we not even wonder, that <HI>this</HI> is a Method that
<PB N="12" REF="004349_0014_10044F9762CAB148"/>
has been so much in Practice, in the Affairs of <HI>Reli∣gion</HI> and <HI>Conscience?</HI> It has all along been the <HI>grand Engine,</HI> in the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> to make Men <HI>Pro∣selytes</HI> to their Way of Worship. And what they have wanted in <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI> to bring this about, they have made up in <HI>wholesome Severities</HI>; and they have gone on in the Use of these, from one Step to another, till they have arriv'd at the Heighth of Barbarity: Insomuch that there is scarce any Kind of Cruelty, however unmerciful, but they have practised it. They have plunder'd Men's Estates; they have imprison'd their Persons; they have banisht them from their Families, their Wives and their Children: Yea, they have destroy'd their Bo∣dies; and this, in all the Ways of Cruelty, that In∣humanity itself has been capable of inventing. And all this they have done, under Pretence of Zeal for the Honour of God and Christ, and to serve the In∣terest of Religion: Yea, they have barbarously mur∣der'd Men's <HI>Bodies,</HI> at the same Time, pretending the greatest Love and Charity to their <HI>Souls.</HI></P>
<P>It could scarce be believed, that Men should act so much in Contradiction to the <HI>most plain</HI> and the <HI>most fundamental</HI> Precepts of the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> and all the while pretend a <HI>zealous Regard</HI> to them, but that it is a Fact, that can neither be disputed nor denied. 'Tis really an astonishing Thing, that the <HI>Christian Institution,</HI> which is so full of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> and is intended and calculated to promote <HI>Peace on Earth,</HI> and <HI>Good-Will towards Men,</HI> should be the Occasion of so much <HI>Hatred</HI> and <HI>Ill-Nature,</HI> of so much unmer∣ciful Barbarity and Cruelty! And yet, this is no more than what our <HI>Lord</HI> both <HI>foresaw</HI> and <HI>foretold.</HI> Says

he to his Disciples, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> x. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Think not that I am come to send Peace on Earth: I am not come to send Peace, but a Sword.</HI> And again, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> xii. 51.</NOTE> <HI>Suppose ye that I am come to give Peace on Earth? I tell you nay; but rather Division.</HI> The Words are not to be interpre∣ted of the <HI>Design,</HI> but <HI>Effect</HI> of <HI>Christ's coming</HI>; what would follow thereupon, not in the Way of <HI>natural Tendency,</HI> but thro' the <HI>Wickedness of Men,</HI> in <HI>Words professing</HI> a <HI>Regard</HI> to <HI>him,</HI> but in <HI>Works denying him.</HI> The <HI>Design</HI> of <HI>Christ's coming</HI> was not <HI>to send a Sword,</HI> but to <HI>give Peace on Earth</HI>: And to this End the Laws of his Gospel are admirably well contriv'd: Insomuch, that if Men did but pay a due Regard to them, there would be no Strife and Contention, no Persecution, nor ill using of Mankind: No, not for the Sake of their <HI>Souls,</HI> any more than on other Ac∣counts. But the <HI>Effect</HI> of <HI>Christ's coming</HI> has been quite different from the <HI>Design</HI> of it: Instead of <HI>Peace,</HI> it has, as our Saviour foretold, unhappily <HI>bro't a Sword</HI>; and this, to the most shameful Degree. Those who have called themselves <HI>Christians,</HI> have taken Occasion, even from the very <HI>Gospel of Peace,</HI> to devour with the Sword; committing all manner of Barbarities, the most horrid Blood-sheds. As was prophesied of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> under the Figure of a <HI>Beast exceeding dreadful, whose Teeth were of Iron, whose Nails were Brass,</HI> she has <HI>made War with the Saints, and prevailed against them, and worn them out;</HI> yea, she <HI>has devoured the whole Earth, has trodden it down, and broken it in Pieces:</HI> Or, as the <HI>Apostle John</HI> prophesies of the same Thing, under the Figure of a <HI>Woman</HI> whose Name is, THE MOTHER OF HAR∣LOTS, AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH, she
<PB N="14" REF="004349_0016_10044F9E5C927400"/>
has been <HI>drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jesus:</HI> Which, when he saw in <HI>Vision,</HI> he said upon it, as he had infinite Rea∣son to do, I WONDRED WITH GREAT ADMIRATION.</P>
<P>Nor are those of the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> the only Ones, who have come into the Use of <HI>Compulsion</HI> and <HI>Force</HI> in the Business of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Men's Salvation.</HI> Even <HI>Protestants</HI> themselves, of whom it could never have been expected, have too nearly resembled them in this <HI>Antichristian</HI> Practice. And indeed, this <HI>Spirit of Popery,</HI> the <HI>tyrannising</HI> over Men's <HI>Consciences,</HI> has been too much in Use, throughout the whole <HI>Chris∣tian</HI> World, in all Ages Nor have any, among <HI>Christians,</HI> been more ready to practice themselves, and recommend to others, the Method of <HI>secular Discipline,</HI> than many among the <HI>Clergy.</HI> They have not only been Enemies to a <HI>Freedom of Inquiry,</HI> and the <HI>Right of private Judgment</HI>; they have not only been zealous to <HI>make Creeds,</HI> and <HI>impose the Belief</HI> of them on others; they have not only <HI>delivered over to Satan</HI> those, who were so unhappy as to dif∣fer from them, tho' in Points of more <HI>Nicety</HI> than <HI>Importance</HI>; I say, they have not only come into such Methods as these, but have also stirred up the <HI>civil Magistrate,</HI> and got those <HI>fin'd,</HI> or <HI>whipt,</HI> or <HI>hang'd,</HI> or <HI>burnt,</HI> who could not bring their Consci∣ences to a Compliance with their Decisions in Mat∣ters of Faith. And for the Proof of this, we may appeal to the whole Series of <HI>Ecclesiastical History,</HI> which contains little else but such Matters as these.</P>
<P>O let it be for a <HI>Lamentation,</HI> that the GRAND CHARACTERISTICK of the GREAT WHORE OF BA∣BYLON, viz. the SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION, the in∣troducing <HI>Compulsion</HI> into the <HI>Affairs</HI> of <HI>Conscience</HI>

and <HI>another World,</HI> has been so generally visible, in a less or greater Degree, upon <HI>all Sorts</HI> of <HI>Christi∣ans!</HI> And the rather, because it has been the Occa∣sion of so much Dishonour to Christ, and Reflection on his Gospel; and is so great a Reproach to the Christian Name.</P>
<P>'Tis worthy our thankful Notice, that the Prin∣ciples of <HI>Liberty</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>Liberty,</HI> I mean not <HI>Licenciousness,</HI> which is the <HI>Excess</HI> in <HI>Liberty</HI>; as <HI>Intemperance</HI> is the <HI>Excess</HI> in <HI>eating</HI> and <HI>drinking.</HI> And as it is no Argument, that Men ought not to <HI>eat</HI> or <HI>drink,</HI> because they may be <HI>intemperate</HI>; so neither is it an Argument, that they mayn't have the <HI>Use of Liberty,</HI> because they may be <HI>licencious.</HI> The <HI>Abuse</HI> of any Thing is no Argument against its <HI>Use</HI>; nor against our <HI>Thankfulness,</HI> that we are favour'd with its <HI>Use.</HI></NOTE> are every Day gaining Ground in our <HI>Nation</HI>; and that <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">I use here the Words of the Rev.

And may this <HI>greatest</HI> of temporal Blessings be continued to them, in its full Extent, as long as the <HI>Sun and the Moon shall endure</HI>!</P>
<P>And as for us, the professed Disciples of Christ, in this Land, <HI>Let us stand fast in the Liberty where∣with Christ has made us free.</HI> And as we have ap∣peared against the <HI>Methods of Force</HI> in Matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> against the <HI>Impositions of Men</HI> in the <HI>Worship of God,</HI> let us go on to do so; esteeming it to be our Glory. And let us always plead for the <HI>Use of Liberty</HI> in the <HI>Affairs of our Souls,</HI> and <HI>another World</HI>: And if any should claim a Power to bind those Things upon the Consciences of Men, which Christ has not commanded, and should enforce their Impositions with the <HI>Sanctions of this World,</HI> let us esteem them, as having upon them, in this Respect, the <HI>Mark of the Beast.</HI> And let that be our Language, <HI>O my Soul, come not thou into their secret; to their Assembly, mine Honour, be not thou united.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. But 'tis time that I come, in the second Place, to do the Duty enjoin'd the <HI>Servant</HI> in the <HI>Text,</HI> by endeavouring <HI>to compel you to come in, and partake of the Gospel Supper.</HI></P>
<P>Only, let me previously observe, that by the <HI>Gospel Supper,</HI> we are here to understand the <HI>Blessings of the Gospel State</HI>; the <HI>Mercies promised and offered</HI> in the <HI>Dispensation, by Jesus Christ.</HI> These Blessings are
<PB N="17" REF="004349_0019_1004445F15D1FBB8"/>
here compared to a <HI>Supper,</HI> and in the parallel Place in <HI>Matthew's Gospel,</HI> to a <HI>Marriage Feast</HI>: By which is denoted the <HI>Plenty</HI> of these Blessings; that there is a full Provision of them in the Gospel; which all may partake of upon <HI>Free-cost,</HI> who will come and accept of them.</P>
<P>Having said this, I shall now make it my Business <HI>to compel you to come, and partake of this Supper.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And I would <HI>compel you,</HI> in the first Place, by minding you of the <HI>Person,</HI> who invites you to it. And this is none other than the <HI>infinite</HI> and <HI>eternal God.</HI> For he is the Person meant by the <HI>certain Man,</HI> in the beginning of this <HI>Parable</HI>; or, by the <HI>certain King,</HI> as 'tis in <HI>Matthew's Gospel.</HI> And shall we not accept an Invitation from the <HI>King of Heaven?</HI> Where is our Ambition? Where our Sense of Ho∣nour? If on of the <HI>Kings of the Earth</HI> should in∣vite us to an Entertainment, how should we esteem our selves honoured? With what Readiness should we embrace the Opportunity of setting down with him at his Table? And shall we make light of an Invitation from him, who is infinitely <HI>higher than the Kings of the Earth?</HI> Shall we excuse our selves, when invited by that glorious Being, before whom all <HI>Nations</HI> of the World are <HI>as nothing</HI>; yea, <HI>less than nothing and Vanity?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis amazing Condescention in the <HI>high and lofty One, who inhabits Eternity,</HI> that he will so much as vouchsafe a Look towards such <HI>Worms of the Dust</HI> as we are: But O how much more amazing is the Con∣descention, for that he is willing to <HI>sup with us,</HI> and that we should <HI>sup with him!</HI> And shall we be un∣willing?
<PB N="18" REF="004349_0020_10044FA1D274EA20"/>
Shall God call upon us to come, <HI>for all Things are ready,</HI> and we turn off the Invitation, making one Excuse and another? O our Senseless∣ness and Stupidity! We ought, most certainly, to accept the Invitation, and come to the <HI>Supper,</HI> which God has provided.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would <HI>compel you</HI> from the Consideration of the <HI>Blessings,</HI> you are invited to receive. And these are many and exceeding great. They extend to even all our Wants; especially, to those that respect our <HI>Souls,</HI> and their <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> Well-being. Nor is there any good Thing, which our <HI>Souls</HI> do stand in Need of, but 'tis provided for them in the <HI>Gospel.</HI> Here is <HI>pardoning Mercy,</HI> and <HI>regenerating Grace</HI>; here is <HI>Peace with God,</HI> and <HI>Peace of Con∣science</HI>; here is <HI>Strength to assist in Duty,</HI> to <HI>help over Difficulties,</HI> to <HI>resist Temptation</HI>; here is <HI>Comfort</HI> and <HI>Support</HI> under <HI>afflictive Tryals</HI>; here is <HI>divine Gui∣dance thro' this World</HI>; and in a Word, <HI>compleat</HI> and <HI>everlasting Blessedness</HI> in the <HI>next.</HI></P>
<P>O the Wonders of Divine Grace in making <HI>such a Provision of Blessings</HI> for the Good of our <HI>Souls</HI>! And shall we cast a Slight upon them? Shall we refuse to accept of them, when they are freely of∣fered to us? O foolish and unwise if we do! For by rejecting the <HI>Gospel Offer of Mercy,</HI> we shall wrong our own Souls, as well as reflect Contempt on God.</P>
<P N="3">3. I would <HI>compel you</HI> by laying before you, the <HI>great Cost</HI> a good God has been at to make this Pro∣vision of Blessings for us. And he has been at a vast Expence. The Blessings, he invites us to receive in the Gospel, were all bought; and this, at the dearest
<PB N="19" REF="004349_0021_10044FAB6A504680"/>
Rate. They were not purchased with <HI>corruptible Things, such as Silver and Gold; but with the pre∣cious Blood of Christ.</HI> Nothing short of this was suf∣ficient to make a Purchase of them: And yet, ra∣ther than we should go without them, the infinitely merciful God has put himself to this vast Expence. He has even parted with <HI>his own dear and only be∣gotten Son. He spared him not, but delivered him up,</HI> to <HI>shed his Blood on the Cross</HI>; and by this Means has got ready for our Acceptance a <HI>Provision of Mercy,</HI> equal to the Needs of our Souls.</P>
<P>And will it not move us to come and accept of the <HI>Blessings</HI> of the <HI>Gospel State,</HI> when we consider what they cost, how much a good God has parted with for the Procurement of them? Where is our Ingenuity? Where our Gratitude to the dearest Lover of our Souls? We shall deserve to be forever stig∣matised as base to the last Degree, if we entertain a low Thought of these Blessings, which have cost so much: Much more if we neglect, or refuse to come and take our Part of them.</P>
<P N="4">4. I may <HI>compel you from the Need, the absolute Need, you stand in of these Blessings.</HI> You are undone, remedilously undone, without a Share in them. These Blessings are provided <HI>no where</HI> but in the <HI>Gospel</HI>: And if you won't come, at the Call of God, and partake of them, as they are here offered, your Souls must perish thro' Want of them. You can be <HI>par∣doned</HI> in <HI>no Way,</HI> but that of the <HI>Gospel</HI>; you can be <HI>regenerated</HI> in <HI>no Way,</HI> but that of the <HI>New Co∣venant</HI>; you can be <HI>saved</HI> in <HI>no Way,</HI> but that of the <HI>Mercy of God,</HI> in <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> And are you willing to go without these Blessings? You can't do without them. Your <HI>Interest,</HI> the Interest of your
<PB N="20" REF="004349_0022_10044FAEB693F450"/>
<HI>Souls</HI>; and this, for <HI>all Eternity,</HI> is concerned in this Matter. Necessity is laid upon you. Your <HI>Salvation</HI> depends upon this very Thing. You must accept of the <HI>Mercy of the Gospel,</HI> or you must perish, and that unavoidably.</P>
<P>I have hitherto considered the <HI>Gospel Supper,</HI> as meaning the <HI>whole Provision of Gospel Mercy</HI> It will not be a Misapplication of the Text, if I take Oc∣casion from it, <HI>to compel you to come in to the Gospel Supper,</HI> meaning hereby the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> the <HI>holy Sacrament,</HI></P>
<P>And alas! That there is so much Need to make Use of <HI>Compulsion</HI> in this Matter; Compulsion, I mean, in the Way of applying to Men's <HI>Understanding</HI> and <HI>Conscience.</HI> One would think, much need not be said to persuade Men to a Duty so reasonable and bene∣neficial: And yet, but few are wrought upon to come in to the Practice of it. The Number of those who go out of the House of God, when the <HI>Ordi∣nance of the Supper</HI> is to be administred, is vastly great in compare of those, who make a tarry! Alas! How few are the Guests who sit down with Christ at his Table! They are but thinly scattered, here and there one to be seen. When the Invitation is given, in the Language of the <HI>Parable,</HI> in which is the Text, <HI>Come, for all Things are now ready</HI>: May it not be said, as follows in the next Words, <HI>And they all, with one Consent, began to make Excuse.</HI></P>
<P>It will not therefore be unseasonable<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Sermon was preach't on a <HI>Communion-Day.</HI></NOTE>, if I take upon me the <HI>Work</HI> assigned the <HI>Servant</HI> in the Text, and endeavour <HI>to compel you to come in</HI>; to come in
<PB N="21" REF="004349_0023_10044FE16F7A1168"/>
to the <HI>Church of Christ,</HI> and to <HI>sit down with him at his Table.</HI></P>
<P>Only, before I proceed, I would just observe, that as the <HI>Sacrament</HI> is an <HI>Institution</HI> of the <HI>Christian</HI> Re∣ligion, <HI>spiritual</HI> Considerations are the only proper ones to be used with Men, to move them to an Obser∣vance of it. <HI>Worldly</HI> Motives have no Place here. Men ought not to come to the <HI>Ordinance of the Sup∣per,</HI> if they have no other Reason for their coming, but that they may be <HI>qualified for some Place of Ho∣nour or Profit.</HI> This would be a base Motive indeed: And 'tis pity Men should ever be tempted with a Motive that is so mean and low: Nor would it be to the Credit of any <HI>religious Establishment,</HI> to make <HI>that</HI> which is a <HI>solemn Test</HI> of Men's Subjection to <HI>Je∣sus Christ,</HI> a <HI>Qualification</HI> without which they can sustain <HI>no Office</HI> in the <HI>State,</HI> not so much as that of a common <HI>Excise-Man.</HI> If any Thing can be, this certainly is, a wicked <HI>perverting the Use</HI> of the <HI>most sacred Rite</HI> of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion; turning it in∣to an <HI>Engine of worldly Policy</HI>: At best, 'tis making Use of a <HI>Motive,</HI> which tends to <HI>compel</HI> Men to re∣gard <HI>this Institution of Christianity,</HI> more with a View to <HI>themselves,</HI> than to <HI>God,</HI> or the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ:</HI> Nor, where the Motive from <HI>this World</HI> is so strong, would it be any Thing strange, if Men shou'd fre∣quently be wrought upon to go to the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> that they might make a <HI>Gain of Godliness.</HI></P>
<P>But 'tis Time that I proceed to the <HI>Work of com∣pelling you</HI> to give your Attendance at the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let me <HI>compel you from the Authority of Jesus Christ.</HI> The <HI>Ordinance of the Supper</HI> is plainly an In∣stitution
<PB N="22" REF="004349_0024_1004443BD8C90FF0"/>
of <HI>his. Do this in Remembrance of me,</HI> are the Words of <HI>Christ himself</HI>; and as express a Com∣mand from him, as any in the whole Gospel And is he not our <HI>Law-giver,</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>Judge,</HI> as well as <HI>Saviour?</HI> Has he not a rightful Authority to give out his Commands? And are we not bound to obey them? And if we are oblig'd to obey his Commands at all, why not in this Instance as well as in any other? Has not this the same Stamp of his Authority on it? And if we may dispense with his Authority in this Article, why not in any other? Why may we not neglect <HI>Prayer,</HI> and the <HI>publick Worship,</HI> as well as the <HI>sacramental Supper?</HI> The Authority of Christ is just the same in these several Instances of Duty; and we may no more neglect to <HI>remember Christ at his Table,</HI> than to <HI>worship</HI> him in <HI>his House.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, there are some Circumstances that do, in a peculiar Manner, recommend to our Observance the <HI>sacramental Institution.</HI> 'Tis the Institution of our <HI>dy∣ing Saviour.</HI> To <HI>remember him,</HI> by <HI>eating Bread,</HI> and <HI>drinking Wine,</HI> in a <HI>religious</HI> Manner, was the Com∣mand he gave us, just as he was going to lay down his Life for us. Says the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. xi. 23. <HI>The Lord Jesus, the same Night in which he was betrayed, took Bread; — and said, Take, eat; — this do in Remembrance of me.</HI> And shall we not remember Christ, when he has desired we would; and expressed this his Desire, when he was about to do the greatest Act of Kindness for us, even offer up himself a Sa∣crifice to make Atonement for our Sins? O let us not put so small a Value on the Love of our Re∣deemer, as to neglect <HI>that Institution</HI> he has set up in his Church, on Purpose to perpetuate the Memory of it. Let us rather joyfully embrace every Oppor∣tunity
<PB N="23" REF="004349_0025_10044FE657F5F110"/>
of remembring this Love of his, which was stronger than Death. 'Tis infinitely reasonable we should do so: Nor otherwise shall we be able to free our selves from the Charge of the blackest Ingrati∣tude, to our best Friend and greatest Benefactor.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let me <HI>compel you</HI> by shewing you, that you have no <HI>just Ground of Excuse,</HI> nothing <HI>sufficient to plead,</HI> why you should not come to <HI>this Supper.</HI></P>
<P>Do any excuse themselves, became they have other Things to mind, which call off their Thoughts and Hearts from this Duty? This is the Excuse in my Context. One had <HI>bought a Piece of Ground,</HI> and he <HI>must needs go and see it.</HI> Another had <HI>bought five Yoke of Oxen,</HI> and he <HI>must go and prove them.</HI> And a third had <HI>married a Wife,</HI> and so <HI>could not come.</HI> And this is the Excuse of Multitudes at present. They are so <HI>encumbred with the World,</HI> that they han't Time to think of their Duty, or to engage in the Practice of it. But this is certainly an <HI>insufficient</HI> Excuse. We ought not to regard this World, or suffer any of the Affairs and Businesses of it, so to engross our Hearts, as to take 'em off from minding the Con∣cerns of our Souls, and an Attendance on our Duty; particularly, this of waiting upon Christ at his Table. And if this is all that we have to say, the <HI>Lord of the Feast</HI> will be <HI>angry</HI> with us: Nor can we ex∣pect, but that he will <HI>bind us Hand and Foot, and cast us into outer Darkness: There will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of Teeth.</HI></P>
<P>Do any excuse themselves for the <HI>present,</HI> resolving that they will attend this Duty <HI>sometime hence?</HI> This, it may be fear'd, is the Case of too many. They are for putting off the Duty, hoping they may, with <HI>more
<PB N="24" REF="004349_0026_10044FB8D5EDC118"/>
Convenience,</HI> engage in it <HI>hereafter.</HI> But this also is an <HI>insufficient</HI> Plea. The Command of Christ, <HI>This do in Remembrance of me,</HI> requires <HI>instant</HI> Obedience. 'Tis a <HI>present</HI> Obligation that lies on us; and we may, by no Means, dispense with it: 'Tis at our Peril, if we do. Besides, we have no Time in <HI>our own Power,</HI> but the <HI>present</HI>: And if we don't attend this Duty <HI>now,</HI> we may never have another Opportunity.</P>
<P>Do any excuse themselves, because 'tis a <HI>solemn</HI> Or∣dinance? Some are too ready to make this Plea; putting too great Difference between <HI>this</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> Duties of Religion. <HI>This,</HI> 'tis true, is a <HI>solemn</HI> Duty: But so is the Duty of <HI>Prayer.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>solemn</HI> Thing to address the supreme Majesty of Heaven and Earth. And perhaps the <HI>Prayers</HI> at the Sacrament, are the <HI>most solemn Part</HI> of the Duty. But let the <HI>Solemnity</HI> of the sacramental Institution be what it will, this is no Reason why we should neglect it. The <HI>more solemn</HI> the Ordinance, the <HI>greater</HI> is its <HI>Impor∣tance</HI>; and the <HI>stronger</HI> therefore the <HI>Reason,</HI> why we should attend it.</P>
<P>Do any excuse themselves, because they an't <HI>pre∣par'd</HI> for so <HI>holy an Ordinance?</HI> This is the most common Plea; but a very insufficient one. If we an't prepar'd for the Sacrament, 'tis our <HI>Sin</HI>: And do we think, that <HI>that</HI> which is <HI>our Sin,</HI> will be a <HI>sufficient Excuse,</HI> for a plain Neglect in Point of Duty? It can never be. If we are really unfit for an Approach to the Table of the Lord; our Duty is plain: We should instantly set about the Work of preparing our selves herefor; and give no Sleep to our Eyes, nor Slumber to our Eye-lids, till we have accomplisht it: And the rather, because if we are unprepar'd, in our <HI>habitual Frame,</HI> for the
<PB N="25" REF="004349_0027_10044FE9D1C9AE30"/>
Sacrament, we are unprepar'd for Death and Judg∣ment; we are unfit to go to Heaven. And this is certainly a State, we ought not to be quiet in.</P>
<P>Do any excuse themselves, imagining there is <HI>less Danger</HI> in a <HI>total Neglect</HI> of the Sacrament, than in coming to it, unless in the <HI>best prepared</HI> and <HI>most worthy</HI> Manner? This seems to be the Apprehension of some. They would willingly come to the Sacra∣ment; but are afraid, they shan't receive in so worthy a Manner, as they would be glad, and so think it <HI>safest</HI> and <HI>best, totally</HI> to abstain. But this is intirely a wrong Way of thinking and arguing. For there is <HI>Danger</HI> in <HI>neglecting</HI> the Sacrament, as well as in <HI>coming to it in an unprepared Manner</HI>; and the Dan∣ger of a <HI>total Neglect</HI> is certainly <HI>much greater,</HI> than a <HI>meer Defect</HI> in the <HI>Measure</HI> of Preparation. 'Tis a Fault to come to the Sacrament, unless we are in some good Measure prepared: 'Tis a Fault like∣wise, and a greater Fault, <HI>totally</HI> to abstain. Our Wisdom therefore in this Case is, neither to abstain from the Sacrament, nor to come to it but in a well prepar'd Manner: And this is what we should take Pains about; nor should we allow our selves to be easy, till we have effected it.</P>
<P>In fine, Do any excuse themselves, because they imagine they shall be under <HI>greater Ties of Duty,</HI> and <HI>more</HI> will be <HI>expected</HI> and <HI>required</HI> of them? Some are afraid of this. They imagine, if they come to the Sacrament, they must lead more holy Lives; be more circumspect, more careful of themselves, and of their whole Walk. But neither is this an Objection of any Weight. 'Tis true indeed, the <HI>more</HI> Men <HI>profess,</HI> the <HI>more holy</HI> they ought to be; and the <HI>stronger</HI> are their Bonds to be circumspect of their
<PB N="26" REF="004349_0028_10044FECDD198DF0"/>
Ways. And is this what we are afraid of? We should be asham'd to make such an Excuse. 'Tis certainly to our Dishonour; as arguing the Want of a just Sense of that Holiness, without which we can never see the Lord. We can't be <HI>too</HI> holy, nor <HI>too strongly</HI> bound to endeavour to be so, to the <HI>highest Degree.</HI></P>
<P>The Time will not permit me to mention any Thing further; nor have I, indeed, any more than hinted at the Things, which have been mention'd, O be persuaded by the Arguments wherewith you have been compelled! And let it be your <HI>speedy</HI> Care to come to the <HI>Sacrament.</HI> You are now solemnly invited in the Name of Christ to give your Attendance at his Table. O excuse not your selves! Let it not be said, you were invited, but rejected the Invitation; least the <HI>Lord</HI> should swear concerning you, that you should not <HI>hereafter taste of his Supper, in his heavenly and eternal Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>And as for us, who have accepted the Invitation of Christ, and are about to <HI>eat Bread</HI> and <HI>drink Wine,</HI> according to his Appointment, let us take Heed to our selves, that we do it in a <HI>religious</HI> Manner. Let us put a Difference between <HI>this</HI> and <HI>common</HI> Bread and Wine. Let us eat of <HI>this Bread</HI> and drink of <HI>this Cup</HI>; employing our Tho'ts on Christ, and re∣membring his Love in giving himself to die for us.</P>
<P>And may the <HI>Love of Christ constrain us</HI> to live unto him! Since <HI>he died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but un∣to him who died for them, and rose again.</HI></P>
