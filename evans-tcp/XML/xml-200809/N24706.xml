<HEAD>TO THE Descendants and proper Successors OF THE First COLONISTS and early SETTLERS OF PENNSYLVANIA, UNDER THE <HI>First Proprietor and Governor</HI> WILLIAM PENN, AND To the rest of its Inhabitants, This HISTORY of that PROVINCE <HI>IS DEDICATED,</HI> BY THE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE following history was written many years ago, as mentioned in the title page;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The design.</NOTE> but the great change in this country, which ensued, and was then forming, prevented the publication. It was not only intended more particularly for the use of the descendants of the first and early settlers of the province, but also for a general information to all others, respecting its former state, &amp;c. that by be∣holding the means, by which small things become great, and what formerly made the country happy, it might excite a similar conduct in posterity, &amp;c.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Non minor est virtus quàm quaerere parta tueri."</L>
<L>That which renders people happy, is necessary to keep them so.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="4" REF="032729_0004_0FF4ED620B5C7280"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">The means, or mate∣rials.</NOTE>Though the materials of this performance, and the regular accounts of the early progressive ad∣vances of this country, left by those who were most capable of giving them, appear, in some things, and more so at particular times, very de∣fective, yet the compilation is made from the best that could be had, as transmitted from the most early settlers, and their successors, of the first re∣putation and character, in the province; as well as from the public records, and such other ac∣counts as may be depended on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Pusey &amp; first collec∣tors of the memorials, &amp;c.</NOTE>Among the first collectors of these materials ap∣pears to have been <HI>Caleb Pusey,</HI> one of the early settlers of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> from about London, in 1682; who, at different times, was both of the provincial and proprietary's, or governor's, coun∣cil, and frequently in the assembly. He lived many years; was well acquainted with the public affairs, and saw great improvements in the pro∣vince. His papers after his decease, in 1725, were delivered to <HI>David Lloyd</HI> and <HI>Isaac Norris;</HI> and afterwards to <HI>James Logan,</HI> about the year 1732. From these persons, who made such additions, as came within their observation, they afterwards passed to <HI>John Kinsey;</HI> who, in conjunction with several others, his friends, revised them; and they remained in his possession till his death, in the year 1750.</P>
<P>The character of these persons, above mentioned, who, at different periods of time, filled some of the most eminent public stations in the province, will further appear in the ensuing history; as be∣ing men who had not only the best opportunity of knowing the variety of incidents, and the true state of its internal affairs, from the beginning, but also were themselves actively concerned in a large share of the public transactions; and some of them, in the different interests both of the proprietary and of his opposers.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="032729_0005_0FF4ED6398ED3DA8"/>But the person who took the most pains to adjust and reduce these materials into such order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Smith, &amp; his M.S. &amp;c.</NOTE> as might be proper for the public view, before that of the present publication, was <HI>Samuel Smith</HI> of <HI>Burling∣ton,</HI> in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> author of the history of that province; whose manuscript (which contained on∣ly the space of about forty years) after his decease, in 1776, being thought by divers sensible and judi∣cious persons, among his friends, to be capable of further improvement, and useful alterations, or ad∣ditions, the present history, therefore, is published, not only in a form, different from that of S. Smith's manuscript, but also divers particulars therein, are here much abbreviated, especially respecting the long and tedious disputes between some of the governors and assemblies; and considerable addi∣tions are made, from other accounts, of such things as were either not at all touched upon, or but slight∣ly mentioned, by him; besides most of the notes, with the <HI>introduction,</HI> and the <HI>description</HI> of the pro∣vince and its <HI>present state,</HI> between the years 1760 and 1770; both which last, not being attempted by him, are, for the most part, entirely new:—So that the whole comprizes, besides what may be found of veracity, in other publications, respect∣ing the province, a true and genuine narrative of the different public transactions, the great and va∣rious improvements, memorable incidents, enter∣taining anecdotes, and things worthy to be known, for above sixty years, besides the said <HI>present state,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The restoration and enjoyment of those natural and civil rights and privileges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Subject of the history.</NOTE> of which men origi∣nally, by their folly and wickedness, are often de∣prived, was the great end, for which the prede∣cessors of the present inhabitants of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> at first, peaceably withdrew into this retirement, from those, who, at that time, appeared either to have lost, or too partially distributed them; and the preservation thereof was the original design of
<PB N="6" REF="032729_0006_0FF4ED6527DE0248"/>
the civil government and constitution of the pro∣vince; an account of which, &amp;c. is the principal subject of the following history.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarka∣ble exam∣ple, &amp;c.</NOTE>Hence, in the first rise, and early progress, of this province, there manifestly appears a remark∣able and extraordinary example of that excellent wisdom, industry and moderation, whose effects are replete with useful instruction to posterity, for having, in reality, rendered a people so very hap∣py and flourishing;—not proved by the boasting of mere theory and anticipation, but by a happy experience for many years.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Possible be∣nefit of his∣tory, &amp;c.</NOTE>It is likewise by means of the same kind of evi∣dence, or proof, so far as history favors us with the experience of former times, in all ages and countries, that men may be taught, not only that the happy state of any country cannot reasonably be expected long to continue, in the same degree of increasing prosperity, as before, without the continued prevalence of principles and means, among the people, in general, similar to those by which it was first obtained; but also how liable such a happy and prosperous condition is again to be lost, by that folly or depravity, which has ever been fatal, where it got the ascendency, though generally under the most plausible appearances.</P>

<L>"Fallit enim vitium specie virtutis &amp; umbrâ."</L>
<L>Evil deceives under the pretence, or appearance of good.</L>
</LG>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Human na∣ture still the same, &amp;c.</NOTE>For the history of all nations abounds with in∣stances of the same nature, operating in all the descendants of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> which we are told, prevailed in these first parents, or representatives, of mankind; and through this medium of history, it may be clearly seen, as in a glass, that too much, or very great, prosperity has been, and conse∣quently may still be, as fatal to the human race, (which is capable of bearing only a certain propor∣tion of it) as the extreme of adversity; and that the effects of plenty, pride and ambition, in the
<PB N="7" REF="032729_0007_0FF4ED7037D13EE0"/>
one, have been, and thence may still be, no less pernicious, than those of want, oppression and dis∣tress, in the other:—But how little have posterity profited from such former examples!—human na∣ture is still the same;—the interdicted tree, with its <HI>forbidden fruit,</HI> is still as tempting as ever it was.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum."</L>
<L>Happy is he whom the harms of others make wary.</L>
</LG>
<P>How often,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men love change, &amp;c.</NOTE> under some plausible pretence or other, are peace and improvement wantonly ex∣changed for war and destruction; whose natural consequence are violence and oppression!—Have we not seen the commencement of this already, even, within our borders, in this young country?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motives for settling Pennsylva∣nia.</NOTE> which the former had rendered so flourishing and happy.—The first and early colonists, or settlers and makers of the province, left the finely culti∣vated plains of <HI>Europe,</HI> with their nearest and dearest connections there, to enjoy and promote the former, in this wilderness, in such degree of perfection, as seemed impossible for them there, and to avoid the latter, with its consequences;— from which, in an eminent degree, it is most manifest, their wisdom, virtue, moderation, and good policy, through much labor, danger and ex∣pence, many ways, and in a very signal, pacific and extraordinary manner, effected the deliverance and preservation of the inhabitants, while they di∣rected the affairs of the colony, and for so many years prolonged the golden days of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P>For, as there appears to be a constant decay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Happy con∣sequences, &amp;c.</NOTE> in human affairs, and all things have their beginning and end, so is it not manifest, in the course of na∣ture, or of all things within the circle of human observation, that a constant recurring to first prin∣ciples, or, that a renovation, or melioration, to balance this decay, is always necessary, both in an individual and collective capacity?—But then do
<PB N="8" REF="032729_0008_0FF4ED71CBCDE578"/>
all the boasted improvement of men, or melio∣ration of the human race, &amp;c. in reality, and in the general, amount to any more, than what is intimated by this similitude? <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn a wise pro∣moter of improve∣ment, &amp;c.</NOTE>The worthy founder and father of the province appears to have been well acquainted with the true means of this melioration, in the state of mankind, by insisting, so much as he did, on the early culti∣vation of piety and virtue, and on a good educa∣tion of youth, in its different branches; with a just and vigorous magistracy, or government, and good order; of which he was ever the firm friend and supporter, not to say, the reformer, or impro∣ver, of it, for the benefit, and further happiness of civil society; as sufficiently appears by his writ∣ings, and in his excellent example of that of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI>—in which, as he exhibited himself a strenuous advocate, and a remarkable extender of justice, mercy, and all rational liberty, so was he also a severe enemy to all licentiousness, injus∣tice, and criminal indulgence of vice and wicked∣ness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extracts form W. Penn's writings.</NOTE>"There can be no pretence (says he) of con∣science, to be drunk, to whore, to be voluptuous, to game, to swear, curse, blaspheme and prophane; no such matter. These are sins against nature; and against the government, as well as against the written laws of God. They lay the ax to the root of human society; and are the common enemies of mankind. It was to prevent these enormities,
<PB N="9" REF="032729_0009_0FF4ED735F121230"/>
that government was instituted;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duty of the magis∣tracy, &amp;c.</NOTE> and shall govern∣ment indulge that, which it is instituted to cor∣rect? This were to render the magistracy useless, and the <HI>bearing</HI> of the <HI>sword</HI> vain; there would be then no such thing, in government, as a <HI>terror to evil∣doers;</HI> but every one would do that, which he thought right in his own eyes; <HI>God almighty deli∣ver us from this sort of tyranny!"</HI></P>
<P>"Nothing (continues he) weakens kingdoms like vice; it does not only displease Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great im∣portance of virtue, &amp;c.</NOTE> but disable them;"—"It is our interest to be good; and it is none of the least arguments for religion, that the piety and practice of it is the peace and prosperity of government; and consequently that vice, the enemy of religion, is, at the same time, the enemy of human society. What, then, should be more concerned for the preservation of virtue, than government? that, in its abstract, and true sense, is not only founded upon virtue, but with∣out the preservation of virtue, it is impossible to maintain the best constitution, that can be made. And, however some particular men may prosper that are wicked, and some private good men mis∣carry, in the things of this world, in which sense, things may be said to happen alike to all, <HI>to the righteous as to the wicked,</HI> yet I dare boldly affirm, and challenge any man to the truth thereof; that, in the many volumes of the history of all ages and kingdoms of the world, there is not one instance to be found, where the hand of God was against a righteous nation, or when the hand of God was not against an unrighteous nation, first or last; nor where a just government perished, nor an unjust government long prospered. Kingdoms are rarely so short lived as men; yet they also have a time to die; but as temperance giveth health to men, so virtue gives time to kingdoms; and as vice brings men betimes to their graves, so nations to their ruin."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="032729_0010_0FF4ED74EF0AD8C0"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Modes of govern∣ment.</NOTE>Respecting modes of government, the memo∣rable founder of that of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> declares,— "There is hardly one frame of government, in the world, so ill designed by its first founder, that, in good hands would not do well enough; and history tells us, the best, in ill ones, can do no∣thing, that is great or good; witness, the <HI>Jewish</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> states. Governments, like clocks, go from the motion, which men give them; and as governments are made and moved by men, so by them are they ruined too: wherefore govern∣ments rather depend upon men, than men upon governments. Let men be good and the govern∣ment cannot be bad; if it be ill they will cure it: but if men be bad, let the government be never so good, they will endeavour to warp and spoil it to their turn."—"That, therefore, which makes a good constitution, must keep it, <HI>viz.</HI> men of wisdom and virtue; qualities, that, because they descend not with worldly inheritances, must be carefully pro∣pagated by a <HI>virtuous education of youth;</HI> for which after ages will owe more to the care and prudence of founders, and the successive <HI>magistracy,</HI> than to their parents, for their private <HI>patrimonies."</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Great im∣portance of good edu∣cation.</NOTE>"I would think (says he in another place) that there are but few people so vicious, as to care to see their children so; and yet to me it seems a plain case, that, as we leave the government, they will find it: if some effectual course be not taken, what with neglect, and what with example, impiety and the miseries that follow it, will be entailed upon our children. Certainly it were better the world ended with us, than that we should transmit our vices, or sow those evil seeds, in our day, that will ripen to their ruin, and fill our country with mise∣ries, after we are gone; thereby exposing it to the curse of God, and violence of our neighbours. But it is an infelicity we ought to bewail, that men are apt to prefer the base pleasures of their present extravagances to all endeavours after a future
<PB N="11" REF="032729_0011_0FF4EDE976362C80"/>
benefit; for, besides the guilt, they draw down upon themselves, our poor posterity must be greatly injured thereby; who will find those debts and in∣cumbrances harder to pay than all the rest, we can leave them under."</P>
<P>"Upon the whole matter (continues he) I take the freedom to say, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good edu∣cation con∣ducive to good go∣vernment.</NOTE> if we would preserve our government, we must endear it to the people. To do this, besides the necessity of present, just and wise things, we must secure the <HI>youth:</HI> this is not to be done, but by the <HI>amendment</HI> of the <HI>way</HI> of their <HI>education;</HI> and that with all convenient speed and diligence. I say, the government is highly obliged: it is a sort of trustee for the youth of the kingdom; who, though now minors, yet will have the government, when we are gone. Therefore <HI>depress vice,</HI> and <HI>cherish virtue;</HI> that through <HI>good education,</HI> they may become good; which will truly render them happy in this world, and a good way fitted for that which is to come. If this be done, they will owe more to your memories for their <HI>education,</HI> than for their estates."</P>
<P>Such maxims and advice are of universal con∣cernment, and interesting to all governments;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men's opi∣nions vary much, &amp;c.</NOTE> but the opinions of different men frequently vary much on the same subjects; and that, even, on impor∣tant as well as trifling affairs; and their conduct is no less contradictory, and sometimes seemingly ir∣rational; they are so liable to embrace opposite ex∣tremes, that they often deviate from the middle way of rectitude: Hence, while the forward, selfish and less qualified, frequently from sinister, or mean views, solicit and succeed into the public offices and magistracy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some cau∣ses of de∣fect in go∣vernment and magi∣stracy, &amp;c.</NOTE> as well as into divers other important departments of life, for which they are unfit and improper, it is to be regretted, that sometimes the more worthy, and better qualified, who are actu∣ated, in what they do, by more generous principles, too often from diffidence of their own abilities,
<PB N="12" REF="032729_0012_0FF4ED809EB50DB0"/>
and an abhorrence of a connection with others, in their improper conduct, entirely decline being con∣cerned in such stations, and thereby refuse that be∣nefit, which they might otherwise, most probably, administer to themselves and their country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some pious men incon∣sistent in their con∣duct, &amp;c.</NOTE>But ought the misuse of a right and necessary thing to be a sufficient reason for rejecting that thing altogether?—shall the abuse and perversion of go∣vernment, and the ill administration of the magis∣tracy, by wicked men, give just occasion for any sober, thinking and rational person, qualified and suitable to be serviceable to his country, in that very important department, to condemn the right use of them? and entirely to refuse his assistance in a thing so necessary as the magistracy?—whether it be from political considerations, or a persuasion, that the execution of it is, in some respects, con∣trary to the nature of Christianity?—like the <HI>Ana∣baptists,</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> formerly, in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd as indicated by the conduct of some in later years?—Certainly, if such reasoning, or conduct, as this, ought to prevail, and be imi∣tated, in the extreme, then, to be consistent with themselves, it is most manifest, such persons as reason and act thus, ought to possess no private property;—religion itself, under pretence of which this notion, or conduct, seems to have been found∣ed, should no longer be professed by them;—nay, they absolutely ought to desist from propagating their own species!—Because these things are most of all abused, or perverted; from which have flowed the greatest evils in the world; and in con∣sequence of the last arise all the wickedness and unhappiness of mankind, &amp;c. for the restraint and correction or remedy, of which, it has pleased divine Providence mercifully to ordain government and magistracy, &amp;c. and to communicate know∣ledge and ability to the industry of men, for that happy purpose:—But who is not able to see the
<PB N="13" REF="032729_0013_0FF4EDEB0A564550"/>
inconsistency of such reasoning?—How strangely liable are mankind to err!—how variously do they go astray, even, under well intended views!—Men may go north till they come south.</P>
<P>But <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> was settled upon very different principles;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pennsylva∣nia an exa∣mple to o∣ther coun∣tries, &amp;c.</NOTE>—for it was impossible for the govern∣ment of it to be founded on such notions; <HI>William Penn</HI> was far from being actuated by the extrava∣gance of this kind of enthusiasm, in giving such an excellent example to mankind, and shewing them how happy it is possible for men to live in the world, if they please: for, while he distinguished between the too general abuse of power, and the exertion of a just authority, he laid a foundation for happy consequences; as manifested in the late glorious example and prosperity of the province, to such a degree of both private and public felicity, as hath exceeded that of most other countries, that we know of, in the world, considering its age, situation, extent, and other circumstances:— This, though defectively exhibited, will, at least, in part, appear in the following history, and in the sketch of the <HI>general state</HI> of the country be∣tween the years 1760 and 1770, at the conclu∣sion. During all which <HI>golden age</HI> of the province, the effects of <HI>William Penn's</HI> government and con∣duct appear to have excelled those of the <HI>wise Solon,</HI> so far as the effects of peace, and prevention of mili∣tary evils and destruction are preferable to those of war:—For by reason of the natural injustice, and the violent operation of the latter, the happy con∣sequences of the former are generally impaired, or destroyed, and never can be long preserved by it; so that the emphatical expressions of the great legis∣lator of <HI>Athens,</HI> as recorded by <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his life of <HI>Solon,</HI> appear more applicable to the lawgiver of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> viz.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="032729_0014_0FF4ED822F1C64F0"/>
<L>"What pow'r was fit I did on all bestow;</L>
<L>Nor rais'd the poor too high, nor press'd too low;</L>
<L>The rich that rul'd, and every office bore,</L>
<L>Confin'd by laws, could not oppress the poor;</L>
<L>Both parties I secur'd from lawless might;</L>
<L>So none prevail'd upon another's right."</L>
</LG>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Various ways of am∣bition, &amp;c.</NOTE>But ambition is rooted in human nature, and demands restraint; it assumes all manner of appear∣ances whatsoever, and is now working wonders, in the world, under the name of <HI>equality</HI> and <HI>the rights of man;</HI>—Hence to mistake innovation for renovation, and a love of change for melioration, connected with such an idea of <HI>self-independency,</HI> as is inconsistent with the enlargement of civilization, or of the social happiness of mankind, in any great or extensive degree, have ever produced those per∣nicious consequences, which have flowed from the revolutionary governments of nations and coun∣tries; whose felicity consists in the unity, harmony, or a just dependency of their parts; and the more extensive those parts are, in such a state, the greater and more durable is most likely to be the happiness of those very constituent and particular parts, as well as of the whole; and <HI>vice versâ.</HI></P>

and increase, or advance, their felicity, so far as human nature is capable of it, both in a particu∣lar and general relation; rather than the contrary, or discord, rebellion and revolt, so often advocated, pursued, and in the end, unhappily experienced, under the plausible name and false appearance, of melioration.</P>
<P>But how muchsoever the recommendation and extension of unity, concord and amity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original causes of happiness and misery still the same.</NOTE> with a due submission, in civil society, may be contrary to the ambition, and selfish views, of an <HI>independent and rebellious spirit,</HI> in any age, or country, yet it is most certain that as the former constituted the state of original, and most complete, felicity, so the latter occasioned the contrary; and cannot, in the na∣ture of things, do otherwise;—and that human happiness may be much further increased, or aug∣mented, both in an individual and collective capa∣city, than either idleness or wickedness will permit many to believe, or think possible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Example of Pennsyl∣vania.</NOTE> the province of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> has afforded a very signal example, and incontestible proof, to the admiration of strangers; and doubtless far beyond the credibility of many, who are not sufficiently acquainted with the early, as well as the later state of the country.</P>
<P>To conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How good things may be reversed and restor∣ed.</NOTE> as the world is said to have been formed out of a chaos, and that order sprung from disorder, by the effect of Omnipotence; so, in the rise of this province, appears a remarkable instance of happy consequences, from apparent unhappy causes;—rational liberty, with an equal participa∣tion of natural and civil rights, and religious pri∣vileges, with the glorious effects, have risen out of oppression, persecution and bigotry:—But, as the abuse of the former has always introduced the latter, sooner or later; and as human nature ever remains to be the same, so the reversing of those en∣joyments continues to be no less incident to the hu∣man race, than it was in former ages of the world;
<PB N="16" REF="032729_0016_0FF4ED83C3C8FA98"/>
and their preservation depends as-much upon the wisdom and conduct of the possessors of them, as their restoration will do, on means similar to those, which raised, and so long preserved, the happy state of the province of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION. PART THE FIRST. CONTAINING, MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF WILLIAM PENN, Prior to his founding the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> AND INCLUDING, <HI>A general and comprehensive view of the rise, princi∣ples, religious system and practice, or manners, of the people called QUAKERS, who first settled the province, under his government.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE wisdom of former ages, when transmitted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Office and use of his∣tory, &amp;c.</NOTE> in writing, to posterity, is an inestimable treasure; but the actions of illustrious and virtuous persons, in the same manner exhibited, is still more benefi∣cial: by the former our judgments are rightly in∣formed, and our minds brought into a proper way of thinking; by the latter we are animated to an imitation; and while the excellency of noble ex∣amples is displayed before our understandings, our minds are inspired with a love of virtue. This ap∣pears to be the office of history; by which every succeeding age may avail itself of the wisdom, and, even, of the folly, of the preceding, and become wiser and happier by a proper application. Through
<PB N="20" REF="032729_0020_0FF4ED93CB0993A8"/>
this medium when we view the conduct of those great men of antiquity, who have benefited man∣kind, in their most essential interests, they ap∣pear frequently to have been actuated by motives, the most disinterested, and attended with a satisfac∣tion more than human!—Adversity, which refines men, and renders them more fit to benefit the hu∣man race, is a frequent concomitant of worthy minds; and apparent success doth not always imme∣diately attend noble and just designs:—When a <HI>So∣crates</HI> is put to death, wisdom and truth seem to suf∣fer; and when an <HI>Aristides</HI> is exiled, justice appears to be in disgrace. But virtue is its own reward, and depends not on the fluctuating opinions of mortals, nor on the breath of popular applause; which is often on the side of error, and entirely opposite to the real interests of its votaries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn an example of wisdom and forti∣tude.</NOTE>An example of true wisdom and fortitude, is no less conspicuous in the venerable founder of the province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> the truly great and wor∣thy <HI>William Penn,</HI> than in many of the celebrated sages and legislators of former ages; who, in opposi∣tion to the vulgar notions of the times in which they lived, have seemingly suffered in their own particu∣lars, in order to benefit mankind: this will appear in the following sketch of his life, both with respect to his religion in joining with the people called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> and likewise in settling the province itself. In both of which his engagement for the happiness of men was not unattended with a large share of that difficulty and opposition, to which the most excel∣lent undertakings are generally exposed: but minds of such exalted virtue are actuated by motives above mortality, and indisputably are influenced by some∣thing <HI>divine;</HI> without which, as <HI>Cicero says, "there never was a really good and great man.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>"Credendum est neminem virorum honorum talem fuisse, nes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> adjuvante Deo; &amp; nemo unquam fuit vir magnus sine afflatu aliquo divino."</P><BIBL>Cic. de natura Deorum</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="032729_0021_0FF4EDFC4D383F30"/>His father, Sir <HI>William Penn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of his fa∣ther admi∣ral Penn.</NOTE> was of eminent character; and served both under the parliament, and king <HI>Charles</HI> the second, in several of the highest maritime offices.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>W. Penn, in his printed works, says further respecting his father, Admiral Penn;—"He was engaged both under the parliament and king; but not as an actor in the domestic troubles; his compass always steering him to eye a national concern, and not intestine wars. His service, therefore, being wholly foreign, he may be truly said to serve his country, rather than either of these interest, so far as they were distinct front each other."—Again, "In the attack on <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> his employ was only as general of the fleet; from which the miscarriage did not arise; it was owing to the land forces, over which he had no command.</P><BIBL>PENN'S Works</BIBL></NOTE> He was born in <HI>Bristol,</HI> anno 1621; and married <HI>Margaret,</HI> daughter of <HI>John Jasper,</HI> of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> merchant;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Biographia Britannica.</NOTE> by whom he had his son <HI>William Penn.</HI> He was him∣self the son of captain <HI>Giles Penn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hisdescent</NOTE> several years consul for the <HI>English,</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> and of the <HI>Penns</HI> of <HI>Penns-lodge,</HI> in the county of <HI>Wilts;</HI> and those <HI>Penns</HI> of <HI>Penn,</HI> in the county of <HI>Bucks;</HI> and by his mother, from the <HI>Gilberts,</HI> in the coun∣ty of <HI>Somerset,</HI> originally from <HI>Yorkshire.</HI></P>
<P>He was addicted from his youth to maritime af∣fairs, and made captain at twenty-one years of age;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His offices.</NOTE> rear admiral of <HI>Ireland,</HI> at twenty-three; vice ad∣miral of <HI>Ireland,</HI> at twenty-five; admiral to the Straits, at twenty-nine; vice admiral of <HI>England,</HI> at thirty-one; and general in the first <HI>Dutch</HI> war, at thirty-two. Whence returning, anno 1655, he was a parliament man for the town of <HI>Weymouth;</HI> in 1660, he was made commissioner of the admiral∣ty and navy, governor of the town and fort of <HI>Kingsail;</HI> vice admiral of <HI>Munster,</HI> and a member of that provincial council; and anno 1664, he was chosen great captain commander under the <HI>Duke of York,</HI> in that signal, and most evidently succes∣ful sight with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P>Thus he took leave of the sea, but continued still in his other employments, till 1669;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His death.</NOTE> at which time, through bodily infirmities, contracted by the
<PB N="22" REF="032729_0022_0FF4ED955BE2D310"/>
care and fatigue of public affairs, he withdrew, prepared and made for his end. He died at <HI>Wan∣stead,</HI> in the county of <HI>Essex,</HI> on the 16th. day of September 1670, in the 49th. year of his age; leaving a plentiful estate, in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> with his paternal blessing to his son <HI>William;</HI> to whom he was perfectly reconciled, after the great displeasure, he had before conceived at his joining in religious society with the <HI>Quakers;</HI>—"Thus (says his son) from a lieutenant he passed through all the eminent offices of sea employment, and arrived to that of general, about the 30th. year of his age; in a time full of the biggest sea action, that any history mentions; and when neither bribes nor alliance, favour nor affection, but ability only, could pro∣mote."—Having acquitted himself with honor and fidelity, in all his public offices, after the restora∣tion he was knighted by king <HI>Charles</HI> the second, and became a peculiar favorite of <HI>James,</HI> duke of <HI>York;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See W. Penn's let∣ter to W. Popple af∣terwards.</NOTE> whose friendship, favor and benevolence were, after his death, continued to his son; which, in a particular manner he requested of the duke, on his death bed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Birth and education of W. Penn born, 1644.</NOTE>The memorable <HI>William Penn,</HI> son and heir of the above mentioned Sir <HI>William,</HI> or admiral <HI>Penn,</HI> and the first proprietor and governor of <HI>Pennsyl∣vania,</HI> was born in <HI>London,</HI> on the fourteenth day of October, 1644. He was endowed with a good genius; and his father, from the promising pro∣spect, which he had, of his advancement was in∣duced to give him a liberal education: He accord∣ingly made such early improvements in literature, that, about the fifteenth year of his age, he was entered a student at <HI>Christ's church college</HI> in <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His behavi∣our at Ox∣ford.</NOTE>At this time more particularly (says the writer of his life) began to appear in him a disposition of mind after true spiritual religion; of which before he had received some sense and taste, through the ministry of <HI>Thomas Loe,</HI> a preacher under the de∣nomination
<PB N="23" REF="032729_0023_0FF4EDFDDDF54BD8"/>
of a <HI>Quaker.</HI> In this place, he, and certain students of that university, withdrawing themselves from the national way of worship, held private meetings, for the exercise of religion; where they both preached and prayed among them∣selves; which gave great offence to the heads of the college. He, being then but sixteen years of age, was fined for non-conformity; and, at last, for his persevering in the like religious practices, was expelled the college.</P>
<P>From thence, after he returned home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His father's conduct to∣wards him.</NOTE> he still retained the same turn of mind, and continued to prefer the society of sober and religious persons. His father, judging this to be a great obstacle in the way of his sons preferment, endeavoured, by divers means to deter and divert him from it. For which purpose, after having used both the force of persuasion upon his mind, and the severity of stripes upon his body, without success, he at length was so far incensed against him, that, in great re∣sentment of rage, he turned him out of his house!</P>
<P>His patience surmounted this difficulty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He sends him to France.</NOTE> till his father's affection had subdued his anger. He then sent him to <HI>France</HI> in company with some persons of quality, who were making a tour thither. He continued there a considerable time, till a quite different, conversation had diverted his mind from the serious thoughts of religion. There he acquir∣ed the knowledge of the <HI>French language,</HI> and a perfectly accomplished, polite and courtly behavi∣our. His father, on his return, thinking the inten∣tion of his travels was fully answered, received him with great satisfaction. His conduct and behavi∣our, for some time after this, being represented to be such as justly entitled him to the character of a complete young gentleman.</P>
<P>About the year 1664 his spiritual conflict,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1664.</NOTE> or religious exercise of mind, is said to have been very great: his natural inclination, his lively and active
<PB N="24" REF="032729_0024_0FF4ED96EB2C5288"/>
disposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His great conflict of mind and resolution.</NOTE> his acquired accomplishments, his fa∣ther's favour, the respect of his friends and ac∣quaintances, did strongly press him to embrace the glory and pleasures of this world, then, as it were, courting and caressing him, in the bloom of youth, to accept them; but, his earnest supplication be∣ing to the Almighty for preservation, he was, in due time, providentially favoured with resolution and ability to overcome all opposition and to pur∣sue his religious prospect, and what he believed was his best interest, through all the reproaches, and persecutions which attended him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is fully convinced of the Qua∣kers princi∣ples in <HI>Ire∣land.</HI></NOTE>In the year 1666, and the 22d. of his age, his father committed to his care and management a considerable estate, in <HI>Ireland;</HI> which occasioned his residence in that country; there, being at <HI>Cork,</HI> at a religious meeting of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> he was thoroughly and effectually convinced of their principles, by means of the preaching of <HI>Thomas Loc,</HI> before mentioned; whose ministry ten years before had made some impressions; upon his under∣standing; so that he afterwards constantly attended the religious meetings of that people, even through the heat of persecution.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1667.</NOTE>Being again at a meeting in <HI>Cork,</HI> in the year 1667,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn committed to prison with the Quakers.</NOTE> he, with many others, was apprehended, and carried before the mayor, who, observing that his dress discovered not the <HI>Quaker,</HI> would have set him at liberty, upon bond for his good beha∣viour; which, refusing to give, he was, with about eighteen others, committed to prison; he had du∣ring his residence in <HI>Ireland,</HI> contracted an intimate acquaintance with many of the nobility and gentry; and, being now a prisoner, he wrote a letter, on the occasion, to the <HI>Earl of Orrery,</HI> lord president of <HI>Munster;</HI> wherein he briefly informed him of his situation, pleaded his innocence, and boldly exhibited the inconsistency with true christianity, as well as the ill policy, of such kind of persecution,
<PB N="25" REF="032729_0025_0FF4EDFF6DE2D768"/>
especially in <HI>Ireland.</HI> The earl immediately ordered his discharge. But his imprisonment was so far from terrifying him, that it strengthened him in his resolution of a closer union with that people, whose religious innocence appeared to be the only crime, for which they suffered.</P>
<P>His more openly joining with the <HI>Quakers</HI> now brought him under that reproachful name;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1667.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">He openly joins the Quakers.</NOTE> and the compliments and caresses of his companions were changed into scoffs and derision; and he be∣came a by-word, and the subject of scorn and con∣tempt both to the professor of religion, and to the profane.</P>
<P>His father by a letter from a nobleman of his acquaintance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great con∣test be∣tween his father and him.</NOTE> being informed of the situation of his son, sent for him home. Upon his return, though there was no great alteration in his dress, yet the manner of his deportment, and the solid concern of mind, which he appeared to be under, were manifest indications of the truth of the information which his father had received; who thereupon at∣tacked him afresh. "And here my pen (says the writer of his life) is diffident of her abilities to de∣scribe that most pathetic and moving contest, be∣tween his father and him. His father, by natural love, principally aiming at his son's temporal ho∣nour; he, guided by a divine impulse, having chiefly in view his own eternal welfare; his father grieved to see the well accomplished son of his hopes, now ripe for worldly promotion, voluntari∣ly turn his back on it; he, no less afflicted, to think that a compliance with his earthly father's pleasure, was inconsistent with an obedience to his heavenly one; his father pressing his conformity to the customs and fashions of the times; he mo∣destly craving leave to refrain from what would hurt his conscience; his father earnestly entreating him, and, almost on his knees, beseeching him to yield to his desire he, of a loving and tender dis∣position
<PB N="26" REF="032729_0026_0FF4ED9879A7C018"/>
in extreme agony of spirit, to behold his father's concern and trouble; his father threatening to disinherit him; he humbly submitting to his fa∣ther's will therein; his father turning his back on him in anger; he lifting up his heart to God, for strength, to support him in that time of trial!"</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A remarka∣ble instance of his sin∣cerity.</NOTE>During this contest, the writer of his life men∣tions one very remarkable instance, among others, of his sincerity:—"His father, finding him too fixed, to be brought to a general compliance with the customary compliments of the times, seemed inclinable to have born with him, in other respects, provided he would be uncovered, in the presence of the <HI>king,</HI> the <HI>duke</HI> and <HI>himself;</HI> this being propos∣ed, he desired time to consider of it; which his father supposing to be with an intention of con∣sulting his friends, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> about it, he assur∣ed him that he would see the face of none of them, but retire to his chamber, till he should return him an answer. Accordingly he withdrew, and, hav∣ing humbled himself before God, with fasting and supplication, to know his heavenly mind and will, he became so strengthened in his resolution, that, returning to his father, he humbly signified, that he could not comply with his desire therein."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His father turns him out of doors a second time.</NOTE>"When all endeavours proved ineffectual to shake his constancy, and his father saw himself ut∣terly disappointed of his hopes, he could no longer endure him in his sight, but turned him out of doors the second time. Thus exposed to the chari∣ty of his friends, having no other subsistence, (ex∣cept what his mother privately sent him) he endur∣ed the <HI>cross</HI> with a <HI>christian</HI> patience and magna∣nimity, comforting himself with the promise of <HI>Christ;—"Verily I say unto you, there is no man, that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wise, or children,</HI> for the <HI>kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive many fold more, in this present time, and in the world to come, life everlasting."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="032729_0027_0FF4EE0AA80E3A08"/>"After a considerable time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His father's wrath some what abat∣ed.</NOTE> his steady perseve∣rance evincing his integrity, his father's wrath be∣came somewhat mollified, so that he winked at his return to, and continuance in his family; and though he did not publicly seem to countenance him, yet, when imprisoned for being at meetings, he privately used his interest to get him released."</P>
<P>"About the year 1668,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1668.</NOTE> being the 24th. of his age, (continues the writer of his life) he first ap∣peared in the work of the ministry, rightly called to, and qualified for, that office; being sent of God to teach others what himself had learned of him; commissioned from on high, to preach to others that holy <HI>self-denial,</HI> which himself had practised; to recommend to all that serenity and peace of con∣science, which himself had felt; walking in the light, to call others out of darkness; having drank of the water of life, to direct others to the same fountain; having tasted of the heavenly bread, to incite all men to partake of the same banquet; being redeemed by the power of <HI>Christ,</HI> he was sent to call others from under the dominion of <HI>Satan,</HI> into the glorious liberty of the sons of <HI>God,</HI> that they might receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified through faith in <HI>Jesus Christ."</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the rise, religious principles and practice, &amp;c. of the people called Quakers.</HEAD>
<P>Before I proceed to be more particular respec∣ting <HI>William Penn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the Qua∣kers, &amp;c.</NOTE> I shall here intermit the further account of his life; and, that the reader might have some just idea of the people, with whom he joined in religious society, and who first settled the province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> under him, I shall next exhibit a short <HI>summary</HI> of the rise, religious prin∣ciples, general system and practice or manners, of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> sufficient for the pur∣pose, principally extracted from their own accounts,
<PB N="28" REF="032729_0028_0FF4EDA4AF8DD7E8"/>
and in their own words, referring the more in∣quisitive enquirer to their particular writings, for further information.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among other writings of this people, the reader is referred to the following:</P>
<P>Their history, by W. Sewel, in folio, and by J. Rutty, in 4to. Their sufferings, in two vols. folio, by Jos. Besse, also to the works, or writings, of R. Barclay, W. Penn, G. Fox, Is. Penington, Samuel Fisher, Ed. Bur∣roughs, Fr. Howgill, Thomas Story, with many others.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Evidences of God's providence, in the rise of the Qua∣kers.</NOTE>Nothing can be a more signal evidence of an over-ruling Providence, superintending the works of the creation, and directing the end of things, than the rise of good out of evil; and the conver∣sion of the wicked machinations of perverse man∣kind to good purposes: that out of persecution and hatred should spring charity, and mutual bene∣volence; that from tyranny and ignorance should flow rational liberty, and true knowledge, is as manifest a demonstration of an all preserving cause, as the creation itself is evident of its own existence: this appears, in part, from the rise of the religious people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and the settling of the flou∣rishing province of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of the rise of the Qua∣kers.</NOTE>Near the middle of the 17th. century, during the civil war, in <HI>England,</HI> when men were tearing each other in pieces, and when confusion and bloodshed had overspread the nation, many sober and thinking persons of the different religious societies, weigh∣ing the uncertainty of human affairs, and behold∣ing the various vicissitudes in the political system, after having examined the many vain and futile opi∣nions, and absurd customs, in religion, which were either imposed, practised or insisted on, by the various professors of <HI>Christianity,</HI> under all deno∣minations, in that country, withdrew themselves from their assemblies for divine worship; and, having their minds turned to what appeared to them more rational, and consistent with a rightly informed understanding, and a life more congru∣ous, or agreeable, to the mind of that Deity which is spiritual, and communicates his goodness and
<PB N="29" REF="032729_0029_0FF4EE0C4A6FE3E8"/>
knowledge more nearly through a medium of his own nature; and places the human mind above the reach of terrestrial influence; they thence fell into that practical belief, and <HI>christian</HI> conduct, which gave rise to this religious society.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may be here noted, that the same unhappy and distracted times likewise originally gave rise to the institution of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> in <HI>Lon∣don:</HI> When men were tired out with wars, contentions, and the changes consequent thereon, divers persons of genius and fortune began to turn their minds from the broils of state affairs, to a philosophic life; and by degrees formed that venerable body, for the promotion of science and natural knowledge; a society, which has done no small honour to the <HI>British</HI> nation, and has been of great benefit to mankind.</P><BIBL>Vide spectator, No. 262, on the rise of the R. Society.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>It was not till the year 1650,<NOTE PLACE="marg">When first called Qua∣kers.</NOTE> that the name of <HI>Quakers</HI> was imposed on them; who before had ge∣nerally gone under the denomination of <HI>professors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1650.</NOTE> or <HI>children,</HI> of <HI>the light;</HI> but the most common ap∣pellation, by which they distinguished themselves from others, and even to this day, is by the name of <HI>Friends.</HI></P>
<P>"Now these people (saith <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause and manner of their first rise and uniting in society.</NOTE> one of their early and principal writers) who hold forth the principles and doctrines hereafter to be menti∣oned, were not gathered together by an unity of opinion, or by a tedious and particular disquisition of notions and opinions, requiring an assent to them, and binding themselves by leagues and covenants thereto; but the manner of their gathering was by a secret want; which many truly tender and serious souls in divers and sundry sects, found in themselves, which put each sect in search of something beyond all opinion; which might satisfy their weary souls, even, the revelation of God's righteous judgment in their hearts, to burn up the unrighteous root and fruits thereof; that, the same being destroyed, and done away, the inward peace and joy of the holy spirit, in the soul, might be felt to abound, and thence power and life to follow him, in all his commandments. And so many came to be joined and united together in heart and spirit, in this one life of righteousness, who had been long wandering

in the several sects; and by the inward unity, came to be gathered in one body; from whence, by de∣grees, they came to find themselves agreed in the plain and simple doctrines of <HI>Christ.</HI> And as this inward power,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Whence the name of Quakers imposed—</P><P>It may be observed, "that through the deep and inward operation of this <HI>power</HI> in them, a dread took hold on them, not only to the be∣getting of God's fear in their hearts, but even to the reaching and in∣structing of their outward man, hence the name of <HI>Quakers,</HI> or <HI>Trem∣blers,</HI> hath been in reproach, by their enemies cast upon them, which serveth to distinguish them from others, <HI>though not assumed by them;</HI> yet as the <HI>Christians</HI> of old, albeit the name of <HI>Christian</HI> was cast upon them by way of reproach, gloried in it, as desiring, above all things, to he accounted the followers of <HI>Christ;</HI> so they also are glad the world reproacheth them as such, who <HI>tremble before the Lord, and who work out their salvation in fear and trembling."</HI></P><BIBL><HI>R.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First and chief prin∣ciple of the Quakers.</NOTE>"That there is somewhat of God, some light, some grace, some power, some measure of the spirit, some divine, spiritual, heavenly, substantial life and virtue, in all men; which is a faithful witness against all unrighteousness, and ungodliness in the heart of man, and leads, draws, moves and inclines the mind of man to righteousness, and seeks to leav∣en him, as he gives way thereunto, into the nature of itself; whereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inward, thorough and real re∣demption may be wrought in the hearts of all men, of whatsoever nation, country or kindred they be, notwithstanding whatsoever outward knowledge, or benefit, they may be, by the providence of God, deprived of: because whatsoever they want of that, yet such a measure of this light, seed, life and word, is communicated to all, as is sufficient truly to convert them from the evil of their ways, puri∣fy and cleanse them, and consequently bring them to salvation. And in the affirming of this, they do
<PB N="31" REF="032729_0031_0FF4EE0DDF803D50"/>
not at all exalt <HI>self,</HI> or <HI>nature;</HI> (as do the Socinians) in that they freely acknowledge that man's nature is defiled and corrupted, and unable to help him one step, in order to salvation; judging nothing more needful than the full and perfect denial and mortification of self, in order thereunto. Nor do they believe this seed, light and grace to be any part of man's nature; or, any thing that properly, or essentially, is of man; but that it is a free grace and gift of God, freely given to <HI>all men,</HI> in order to bring them out of the <HI>fail,</HI> and lead them to life eternal. Neither do they suppose this seed, word and grace, which is sufficient to lead to salvation, to be given to men <HI>without Christ;</HI> for they believe it to be the purchase of <HI>Christ's death, who tasted death for every man:</HI> so that they confess all to be derived to them in and by <HI>Christ,</HI> the mediator; to whom they ascribe all. Yea, they believe this light, grace and seed to be no other, but a measure of that life and spirit, that was in <HI>Christ Jesus;</HI> which, being in <HI>him,</HI> who is the head, in the ful∣ness of it, is from <HI>him,</HI> (in whom it resideth) as he is ascended up unto, and glorified in, the hea∣vens, <HI>extended to all men,</HI> in order to redeem them from sin, and convert them to God."</P>
<P>"Thus, according to this principle, without attributing any thing to <HI>self</HI> or to the nature of man, or, claiming any thing without <HI>Christ, the universal love of God to all men</HI> is exhibited; where∣by the means of salvation by <HI>Christ,</HI> and reconci∣liation unto God, is so asserted, that <HI>no man</HI> is al∣together excluded from it, but each so reached, as puts him into a capacity to be saved."</P>
<P>Hence, as it naturally arises from this <HI>universal principle,</HI> the <HI>church Catholic,</HI> or <HI>universal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Definition of the church Ca∣tholic, or universal, &amp;c.</NOTE> with∣out which there can be no salvation, is by them understood to comprehend all persons, or so many, of every nation and kind of people, without ex∣ception, whether they have the knowledge and be∣nefit

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Particular outward &amp; visible church Ibid.</NOTE>And this they think may not be derogatory from the propriety and necessity of a particular <HI>outward visible church of Christ;</HI> which is absolutely requi∣site, where God affords the opportunity of the knowledge of <HI>christianity;</HI> as it consists of a society, or number of persons, who, through the belief of the true principles and doctrines of the <HI>christi∣an faith;</HI> their hearts being united by the same love of God, and their understandings informed in the same truths, associate and assemble together, for <HI>divine worship;</HI> to bear a joint testimony for the <HI>truth,</HI> against <HI>error;</HI> and for the mutual edifica∣tion and strengthening of one another:—So that a person may be a member of the true <HI>Catholic church,</HI> who, at the same time, may not be a member of any particular <HI>church of Christ:</HI> but, that no man can properly be a real member of a particular <HI>church of Christ,</HI> who is not one of the <HI>Catholic church;</HI> and that the outward testimony and pro∣fession of <HI>christianity</HI> can only be requisite to be believed and held forth, where it is known, or revealed, and not otherwise.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their worship.</NOTE>Consistent with the nature of this <HI>universal prin∣ciple,</HI> and the definition of the church arising there∣from, appears to be their <HI>worship;</HI> which, accord∣ing to the account of it, given by themselves, was more divested of those numerous external and bo∣dily exercises and performances, which either the ignorance or ingenuity of men, had introduced, under the specious pretence of thereby rendering themselves more acceptable to a <HI>spiritual Being,</HI> than that of any other religious societies, known to

them, at that time, under the name of <HI>Christians:</HI>— A worship, which they professed to be <HI>spiritual,</HI> and performed in the mind; not being confined to par∣ticular persons, times, places, nor ceremonies; but more congruous to, or consistent with the nature of a spiritual divinity, the object of all true <HI>worship,</HI> according to the <HI>New Testament;</HI> which expressly declares, <HI>"that the worship of God ought to be per∣formed in spirit and in truth, and not to be confined to any external mode, place or particular person; and for this reason, because God is a spirit; and conse∣quently a spiritual worship is the sole rational, and most agreeable to his nature:"</HI>—This is the only pre∣cept, or declaration, concerning <HI>divine worship;</HI> and the manner of it, which is left us by the au∣thor of <HI>Christianity.</HI></P>
<P>Hence saith R. Barclay, "Albeit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barclay's apology.</NOTE> I say that this worship is neither limited to times, places nor persons; yet I would not be understood, as if I intended the putting away all set times and places to <HI>worship:</HI> God forbid I should be of such an opi∣nion. Nay, we are none of those that <HI>forsake the assembling of themselves together;</HI> but have even, certain times and places, in which we carefully meet together to wait upon God, and worship him. To meet together we think necessary for the peo∣ple of God; because, so long as we are cloathed with this outward tabernacle, there is a necessity to the entertaining of a <HI>joint and visible fellowship,</HI> and bearing of an outward testimony for God, and seeing of the faces of one another; that we may concur with our persons, as well as spirits;"— which meeting together is no part of worship in itself, but only a preparatory accommodation, in order to a public visible worship; which consists,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worship of the Qua∣kers.</NOTE> when met, in a silent watching and waiting upon God in themselves, (or in their minds) and a be∣ing gathered from all visibles thereinto. And as every one is thus stated, they come to find the <HI>good</HI> over the <HI>evil,</HI> and the <HI>pure</HI> over the <HI>impure;</HI> in
<PB N="34" REF="032729_0034_0FF4EDA96586BC38"/>
which God reveals himself, and draweth near to every individual; and so he is in the midst, in the general; whereby each not only partakes of the particular refreshment and strength, which comes from the good in himself, but is a sharer of the whole body, as being a living member of the bo∣dy, having a just fellowship and communion with all. And, as this worship is stedfastly preached, and kept to, it becomes easy; though it be very hard, at first, to the natural man; whose roving imaginations, and running worldly desires, are not easily brought to silence."—"And, as every one is thus gathered, and so met together inwardly, in their spirits, as well as outwardly, in their persons, there the secret power and virtue of <HI>life</HI> is known to refresh the soul, and the pure motions and breathings of God's spirit are felt to arise; from which, as words of declaration, prayers or praises, arise, the acceptable worship is known, which edi∣fies the church, and is well pleasing to God. And no man here limits the spirit of God, nor bringeth forth his own conned and gathered stuff; but every one puts that forth, which the Lord puts into their hearts; and it is utterred forth, not in man's <HI>will and wisdom,</HI> but in the <HI>evidence</HI> and <HI>de∣monstration of the spirit and of power.</HI> Yea, though there be not a word spoken, yet is the true spiritual worship performed, and the body of Christ edified; yea, it may and hath often fallen out among us, that divers meetings have passed without one word; and yet our souls have been greatly edified, and our hearts wonderfully overcome, with the secret sense of God's power and spirit; which, without words, have been ministered from one vessel to another."—"Many are the blessed experiences, which I could relate of this <HI>silence,</HI> and manner of <HI>worship;</HI> yet I do not commend, and speak of <HI>silence,</HI> as if we had a law in it, to shut out praying or preaching, or tied ourselves thereunto; not at all: For, as our worship consists not in the <HI>words,</HI> so
<PB N="35" REF="032729_0035_0FF4EE1D73F27A28"/>
neither in <HI>silence,</HI> as <HI>silence;</HI> but <HI>in an holy depend∣ance of the mind upon God:</HI> from which depend∣ance silence necessarily follows, in the first place, until words can be brought forth, which are from God's spirit. And God is not wanting to move, in his <HI>children,</HI> to bring forth words of exhorta∣tion, or prayer, when it is needful; so that of the many gatherings and meetings of such as are con∣vinced of the truth, there is scarce any, in which God raiseth not up some or other, to minister to his brethren; that there are few meetings, that are altogether <HI>silent."</HI>—"And when any are, through the breaking forth of this power, constrain∣ed to utter a sentence of exhortation or praise, or to breathe to the Lord, in prayer, then all are sensible of it; for the same life in them answers to it, as in <HI>water, face answereth to face."</HI>—"And there being many joined together in the same work, there is an inward travail and wrestling; and also, as the measure of grace is abode in, an overcom∣ing of the power and spirit of darkness (in the mind:) and thus we are often greatly strengthened and renewed in the spirits of our minds, without a word, and we enjoy and possess the <HI>holy fellow∣ship and communion of the body and blood of Christ;</HI> by which our inward man is nourished and fed; which makes us not to dote upon outward <HI>water,</HI> and <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>wine,</HI> in our spiritual <HI>things."</HI>—"This is that <HI>divine and spiritual worship,</HI> which the world neither knoweth nor understandeth, which the vul∣ture's eye seeth not into."—"And its excellency is such, that it can neither be stopped, intercepted nor counterfeited by the malice, or power of men or devils, as all others can."</P>
<P>As that, which is necessary to make a man a <HI>Christian,</HI> so as without it he cannot be truly one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their ministry.</NOTE> must consequently be much more necessary to make a man a minister of <HI>Christianity,</HI> (seeing the one is a degree above the other, and has it included in it) so this people accordingly maintained that, as the

Barclay, and divers others of that society) as well as in the common outward concerns of life, and those things, for which they are adequate and suitable: and therefore, they had schools and seminaries of learning among them, for the acquisition thereof, and other useful sciences, as other people have. But their excluding literature, or school-learning, from being <HI>absolutely</HI> necessary in divinity, according to the <HI>Christian</HI> sys∣tem; and the great harm, which they believed and declared the general perversion, or misuse thereof, had produced in Christendom, occasioned divers of them to be so severe on the subject, that many, from thence, have mistakenly supposed, they entirely disapproved of human learning in every respect.</NOTE> "But, in a true church of

And when they assem∣ble together, to wait upon God, and to worship and adore him; then such as the spirit sets apart for the ministry, by its divine power and influence, opening their mouths and giving them to exhort, reprove and instruct with virtue and power; these are thus of God <HI>ordained and admitted</HI> into the <HI>mi∣nistry;</HI> and their brethren cannot but hear them, and receive them, and also <HI>honour them for their works sake.</HI> And so this is not monopolised to a certain kind of men, as the <HI>Clergy</HI> (who are to that purpose educated and brought up, as other carnal artists) and the rest to be despised as <HI>Laicks;</HI> but it is left to the <HI>free gift of God</HI> to choose any whom he seeth meet thereunto, whether rich or poor, servant or master, young or old, yea, male or female.

<P>"And truly (saith <HI>W.

<P N="2">2. "They went not forth to preach in their own time, or will, but in the <HI>will of God;</HI> and spoke not their own studied matter, but as they were opened and moved of his spirit; with which they were well acquainted, in their own conversion; which cannot be expressed to carnal men, so as to give them any intelligible account; for to such it is as <HI>Christ</HI> said, <HI>like the blowing of the wind, which no man knows whence it cometh, or whither it goeth.</HI>— Yet this proof and zeal went along with their mi∣nistry, that many were turned from their lifeless professions, and the evil of their ways, to an in∣ward and experimental knowledge of God, and an holy life as thousands can witness. And as they freely received, what they had to say, from the Lord, so they freely administered it to others."— (And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barclay's apology, &amp;c.</NOTE> as <HI>R.

And if, at any time, they were called of God, so as the work of the Lord hindered them from the work of their trades, they took what was freely given them by

<P N="3">3. "The bent and stress of their ministry (con∣tinues <HI>W.

<P N="4">4 "They directed people to a <HI>principle in them∣selves,</HI> though not of themselves, by which all, that they asserted, preached and exhorted others to, might be wrought in them, and known to them, through experience, to be true: which is an high and distinguishing mark of the truth of their mi∣nistry, both that they knew what they said, and were not afraid of coming to the test: for, as they were bold from certainty, so they required confor∣mity upon no human authority, but upon convic∣tion of this <HI>principle;</HI> which they asserted was in them, that they preached unto; and unto that they directed them, that they might examine and prove the reality of these things, which they had affirm∣ed of it, as to its manifestation, and work in man. And this is more than the many ministers in the world pretend to."—"Thus this people did not only in words, more than equally with others, press repentance, conversion and holiness, but <HI>over</HI> and <HI>above</HI> did it knowingly and experimentally; and directed those, to whom they preached, to a suffici∣ent principle; and told them where it was, and by what tokens they might know it, and which way they might experience the power and efficacy of it, to their souls' happiness; which is more than <HI>theory</HI> and <HI>speculation;</HI> upon which most other ministers depend: for here is certainty; a bottom upon which man may boldly appear before God, in the great day of account.</P>

Insomuch, as it hath often happened, where people have, under secrecy, revealed their state, or condition, to some choice friends, for ad∣vice, or ease; they have been so particularly direct∣ed, in the ministry of this people, that they have challenged their friends, with discovering their se∣crets, and telling their preachers their cases, to whom a word had not been spoken.

<P><HI>First,</HI> Their <HI>disuse of all gaming,</HI> and <HI>vain sports;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their dis∣use of ga∣ming, sports, plays, &amp;c.</NOTE> as the frequenting of <HI>plays, horse-races, &amp;c.</HI> was a custom strictly and constantly adhered to by them; as being most consistent with a truly christian life; the use of these, and similar things, having, in their estimation, a manifest and infallible tendency to draw away, and alienate the human mind from the most important object of true happiness, as thus expressed by <HI>R. Barclay,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>"It will not be denied but that men ought to be more in love of God, than of any other thing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. Barclay.</NOTE> for we ought to love <HI>God above all things.</HI> Now it is plain, that men, who are taken up with love, whe∣ther it be of women, or of any other thing, if it hath taken a deep place in the heart, and possess the mind, it will be hard for the man so in love, to drive out of his mind the person, or thing so beloved; yea, in his eating, drinking and sleeping, his mind will always have a tendency that way; and in business, or recreations, however intent he be in it, there will be but a very short space of time permitted to pass, but his mind will let some ejaculation forth towards its <HI>beloved.</HI> And albeit such an one must be conversant in those things, that the care of this body, and such like things call for;
<PB N="56" REF="032729_0056_0FF4EDDBA1DFEBB8"/>
yet will he avoid, as death itself, to do those things that may offend the party so beloved, or cross his design in obtaining the thing so earnestly desired: though there may be some small use in them, the great design, which is chiefly in his eye, will so balance him, that he will easily look over, and dis∣pense with such petty necessities, rather than endan∣ger the loss of the greater by them. Now, that men ought to be thus <HI>in love with God,</HI> and <HI>the life to come,</HI> none will deny; and the thing is apparent from these scriptures, Matt. vi. 20. <HI>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.</HI> Col. iii. 2. <HI>set your affections on things above, &amp;c.</HI> and that this hath been the experience and attainment of some the scripture also declares, Psalm lxiii. 1, 8. 2 Cor. v. 2."</P>
<P>"And again, that these games, sports, plays, dancings, comedies, &amp;c. do naturally tend to draw men from <HI>God's fear;</HI> to make them forget <HI>heaven, death</HI> and <HI>judgment;</HI> to foster <HI>lust, vanity</HI> and <HI>wan∣tonness;</HI> and therefore are most <HI>beloved,</HI> as well as <HI>used</HI> by such kind of persons, experience abun∣dantly shews, and the most serious and consci∣entious, among all, will scarcely deny; which if it be so, the application is easy."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They a∣voided su∣perfluity &amp;c.</NOTE>Secondly, They avoided superfluity in the gene∣ral course of their living; observing such a tem∣perate medium in the use of things, as they were sensible conduced most to a good state both of bo∣dy and mind; which distinguished them from others, not only in their <HI>eating and drinking,</HI> in their <HI>conversation and discourse,</HI> being generally of few words, but pertinent; but also in the <HI>furniture of their houses,</HI> their <HI>apparel,</HI> or <HI>dress;</HI> and in their <HI>births, marriages and funerals;</HI> and not only so but they even sometimes, condemned and disused what only had a tendency to excess;—"Thus (says <HI>W. Penn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They did not drink healths, &amp;c.</NOTE> on the custom of drinking healths) they forbore drinking to people, or pledging of them, as the manner of the world is: a practice, that is
<PB N="57" REF="032729_0057_0FF4EE3EB254F2E0"/>
not only unnecessary but they thought, <HI>evil,</HI> in the tendencies of it, being a <HI>provocation</HI> to drink more than did people good, as well as that it was in it∣self <HI>vain and heathenish."</HI></P>
<P>But, in regard to several of such things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are not for le∣velling, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the proper use of temporal enjoyments, <HI>R. Bar∣clay</HI> further observes:—"Let not any one judge, that from our opinion in these things, any neces∣sity of <HI>levelling</HI> will follow; or, that all men must have things in <HI>common;</HI> our principle leaves every man to enjoy that peaceably, which either his own industry, or his parents, have purchased for him; only he is thereby instructed to use it aright, both for his own good and that of his brethren; and all to the glory of God: in which also his acts are to be <HI>voluntary,</HI> and in no ways <HI>constrained.</HI> And further, we say not hereby, that no man may use the creation more or less than another: for we know, that as it hath pleased God to dispense it diversely, giving to some more, and to some less, so they may use it accordingly."—"The safe place then is, for such as have fulness, to watch over themselves, that they use it moderately, and rescind all superfluities, being willing, as far as they can, to help the need of those, to whom Providence hath allotted a smaller allowance. Let the brother of high degree rejoice, in that he is abased; and such as God calls, in a low degree, be content with their condition, not envying those brethren, who have a greater abundance; knowing they have received abundance, as to the inward man; which is chiefly to be regarded. And therefore, beware of such a temptation, as to use their calling as an engine to be <HI>richer,</HI> knowing they have this advan∣tage beyond the <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>noble,</HI> that are called, that the truth doth not any ways abase them, nay, not in the esteem of the world, as it doth, in the others; but that they are rather exalted thereby, in that, as to the inward and spiritual fellowship of the
<PB N="58" REF="032729_0058_0FF4EDDD2FEAF3D8"/>
saints, they become the brethren and companions of the <HI>greatest</HI> and <HI>richest;</HI> and, in this respect, <HI>let him of low degree rejoice that he is exalted."</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their christian charity.</NOTE>As to the <HI>third head,</HI> in what manner they held and practised <HI>christian charity,</HI> in its highest and sublimest sense, appears, in part, from what has been already said of their <HI>first and chief principle;</HI> respecting some particular branches I shall further mention from <HI>W. Penn:</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their lov∣ing one another.</NOTE>First, <HI>"Communion,</HI> and <HI>loving one another.</HI> This is a noted mark, (says W. P.) in the mouth of all sorts of people, concerning them; <HI>they will meet, they will help and stick to one another,</HI> whence it is common to hear some say, <HI>look how the Qua∣kers love</HI> and <HI>take care of one another.</HI> Others less moderate, will say, <HI>the Quakers love none but them∣selves.</HI> And if <HI>loving one another,</HI> and <HI>having an intimate communion,</HI> in religion, and constant care to meet to worship God, and help one another, be any mark of <HI>primitive christianity,</HI> they had it, blessed be the Lord, in an ample manner."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They did not go to law one with ano∣ther.</NOTE>Their entire disuse of <HI>going to law</HI> one with ano∣ther was a singular instance of their high sense, and steady and uniform practice of <HI>christian love and charity:</HI>—"To go to law one with another, (saith one of their writers) as it was among the <HI>primitive Christians,</HI> is deemed an utter fault, and breach of fellowship with them; and commencing, or defending suits at law, in any case, without urgent necessity, is forbidden:"—Their differences, and disputes, one with another, about their tem∣poral affairs, when they happened, which was but seldom, being generally composed and settled by arbitrators, or persons chosen, for that purpose, by the parties, among themselves, without going to law."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See R. Barclay's anarchy of the Ranters, &amp;c. on this head.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their lov∣ing ene∣mies</NOTE>Secondly, <HI>"To love enemies,</HI> (continues <HI>W. Penn</HI>) this they both <HI>taught and practised.</HI> For they did
<PB N="59" REF="032729_0059_0FF4EE49753DE5E8"/>
not only <HI>refuse</HI> to be <HI>revenged</HI> for injuries done them, and condemned it, as of an unchristian spi∣rit, but they did <HI>freely forgive,</HI> yea, <HI>help and re∣lieve</HI> those, that had been cruel to them, when it was in their power to have been even with them: of which many and singular instances might be given: endeavouring through faith and patience, to overcome all injustice and opposition; and preach∣ing this <HI>doctrine,</HI> as <HI>Christians,</HI> for others to follow."</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Not fighting, but suffering,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They did not fight but suffer, &amp;c.</NOTE> is another testimony, peculiar to this people, in the words of <HI>W. Penn, viz.</HI> "They affirm, That <HI>Christianity</HI> teacheth people to <HI>beat their swords into plowshares,</HI> and <HI>their spears into pruning hooks, and to learn war no more; that so the wolf may lie down with the lamb, and the lion with the calf, and nothing that destroys be entertained in the hearts of the people:</HI> exhorting them to employ their zeal against <HI>sin,</HI> and turn their anger against <HI>Satan,</HI> and no longer war one against another; because <HI>all wars and fightings</HI> come of men's own hearts lusts, according to the apostle <HI>James,</HI> and not of the meek spirit of <HI>Christ Jesus;</HI> who is captain of another <HI>warfare;</HI> and which is carried on with other weapons. Thus, as <HI>truth speaking</HI> succeeded <HI>swearing,</HI> so <HI>faith and patience</HI> succeeded fighting, in the doctrine and practice of this people. Nor ought they, for this, to be ob∣noxious to civil government; since if they cannot <HI>fight for it,</HI> neither can they <HI>fight against it;</HI> which is no mean security to any state: nor is it reason∣able that people should be blamed for not doing more for others, than they can do for themselves. And, Christianity set aside, if the costs and fruits of war were well considered, peace, with all its in∣conveniencies, is generally preferable. And though they were not for <HI>fighting,</HI> they were for <HI>submitting</HI> to government; and that not only for <HI>fear,</HI> but for <HI>conscience sake,</HI> where government doth not in∣terfere with conscience; believing it to be an ordi∣nance
<PB N="60" REF="032729_0060_0FF4EFDCF20CDDC0"/>
of God, and where it is justly administered, a great benefit to mankind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is observable, that though they absolutely declined all military ser∣vice, not only in their persons, but also in their refusing to procure sub∣stitutes, or others, in their room, by hiring, or in anywise paying, or contributing for the personal service of such for them, in that capacity, or for any particular military purpose solely; yet in all other respects, they punctually and willingly paid their taxes, though of a mixed nature, that is both military and civil, for the support of government, as before observed. Vide page 51.</NOTE> Though it has been their lot, through blind zeal in some, and interest in others, to have <HI>felt</HI> the <HI>strokes</HI> of it with a greater weight and rigour, than any other <HI>persua∣sion,</HI> in this age; while they, of all others, religion set aside, have given the civil magistrate the least occasion of trouble, in the discharge of his office."</P>
<P>Concerning this point it may be further observed from <HI>R. Barclay, viz.</HI>—"For it is as easy to ob∣scure the sun, at mid-day, as to deny that the pri∣mitive Christians renounced all revenge and fight∣ing, and although this thing be so much known, yet it is as well knows, that almost all the modern sects live in the neglect and contempt of this law of Christ, and likewise oppress others, who in this agree not with them, for conscience sake towards God: even, as we have suffered much in this our own country, because we could neither ourselves bear arms, nor send others in our places, nor give our money for the buying of drums, standards, and other military attire. And lastly, because we could not hold our doors, windows and shops close, for consci∣ence sake, upon such days as fasts and prayers were appointed, to desire a blessing upon, and success for, the arms of the kingdom, or commonwealth, under which we live; neither give thanks for the victories acquired by the effusion of much blood. By which forcing of the conscience they would have constrained our brethren, living in divers kingdoms at war together, to have implored our God for contrary and contradictory things, and consequently impossible; for it is impossible that two
<PB N="61" REF="032729_0061_0FF4EEB13AB92C30"/>
parties fighting should both obtain the victory. And because we cannot concur with them, in this confusion, therefore, we are subject to persecu∣tion."</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The last thing I shall mention under this <HI>head,</HI> is <HI>their maintaining all their own poor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their cha∣rity to the poor, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>at their own expence;</HI> or, without being chargeable to others, besides contributing towards the support of the poor of other societies, equally with them∣selves, in all common <HI>poor rates</HI> or <HI>taxes:</HI> inso∣much that no such thing as a common beggar was permitted, or known, to be among them, of that society. For, as they suffered none of their soci∣ety to be in so necessitous a condition, as others, so they were so careful in the education of their chil∣dren and youth, that there were none among them, brought up without a competency of useful and plain learning; these things being annually and methodically enquired into, and strictly practised through the whole society, in every place. Thus, while, in these important matters, they were no ways burthensome to others, and while they con∣tributed to other societies equally with themselves, in paying all <HI>poor rates</HI> and <HI>taxes</HI> of every kind, they were moreover and besides no less noted for most other acts of beneficence according to their stations in civil society; being ever among the first, <HI>in works and institutions of charity,</HI> where they lived, according to their abilities: so that in contributions of this nature, they were observed mostly either to be among the introducers or pro∣moters of them, or otherwise distinguished for their liberal donations; and if any were in distress, they were generally known to be among the first to re∣lieve them.</P>
<P>As the practice of divers of these particulars, mentioned under the preceding heads, made them appear, at first, very singular to many in all ranks and societies of people; from whom they suffered
<PB N="62" REF="032729_0062_0FF4EE4C992D82C8"/>
much redicule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">These things made the Quakers appear si∣ngular, &amp;c.</NOTE> unmerited abuse, and cruel per∣secution, chiefly on account of divers of these things; and as they still appear to be subject to something of the same nature, though in less de∣gree, in some places, where they are but little known, and labor under false representations; and where ignorance and a blind zeal dispose people to reject and despise moderate enquiry; or where a strong attachment to old customs, however absurd, too frequently slights and refuses sober rea∣soning, on religious subjects, for unprofitable and acrimonious disputes, I shall, therefore, close this part with the following short conclusions, respect∣ing them, from <HI>R. Barclay, viz.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclus∣ions from R. Barclay.</NOTE>"But lastly, to conclude, if to give and receive flattering titles, which are not used because of the virtues inherent in the persons, but are, for most part, bestowed by wicked men upon such as them∣selves; if to bow, scrape and cringe to one another; if, at any time, to call one another <HI>humble servant,</HI> and that most frequently without any design of real service; if this be the honor that comes from God, and not the honor, that is from below, then indeed our adversaries may be said to be believers, and we condemned, as proud and stubborn, in denying all these things.</P>
<P>"But if, with <HI>Mordecai,</HI> to refuse to bow to proud <HI>Hamon,</HI> and with <HI>Elihu, not to give flatter∣ing titles to men, lest we should be reproved by our Maker;</HI> and if, according to <HI>Peter's</HI> example, and the <HI>angel's</HI> advice, to bow only to God, and not to our <HI>fellow servants;</HI> and if, to call no man <HI>lord</HI> nor <HI>master,</HI> except under particular relations, according to <HI>Christ's</HI> command; I say, if these things are not to be reproved, then are we not blame worthy in so doing.</P>
<P>"If to be vain and gaudy in apparel; if to paint the face and plait the hair; if to be cloathed with gold and silver, and precious stones; and, if
<PB N="63" REF="032729_0063_0FF4EEB2CF064C58"/>
to be filled with ribbands and lace, be to be cloathed in modest apparel; and, if these be the ornaments of Christians; and, if that be to be humble, meek and mortified, then are our adver∣saries good Christians indeed, and we, proud, sin∣gular and conceited, in contenting ourselves with what need and convenience calls for, and con∣demning what is more, as superfluous; but not otherwise.</P>
<P>"If to use games, sports, plays; if to card, dice and dance; if to sing, fiddle and pipe; if to use stage plays and comedies, and to lie, counter∣feit and dissemble, be to fear always; and if that be to do all things to the glory of God; and if that be to pass our sojourning here in fear; and if that be to use the world, as if we did not use it; and if that be, not to fashion ourselves acord∣ing to our former lusts; to be not conformable to the spirit and vain conversation of this world; then are our adversaries, notwithstanding they use these things, and plead for them, very good, sober and self-denying Christians, and we justly to be blamed, for judging them, but not otherwise.</P>
<P>"If the prophanation of the holy name of God; if to exact oaths one from another, upon every slight occasion; if to call God to witness, in things of such a nature, in which no earthly king would think himself lawfully and honorably to be a wit∣ness, be the duties of a Christian man, I shall con∣fess that our adversaries are excellent good Chris∣tians, and we wanting in our duty: but if the con∣trary be true, of necessity our obedience to God, in this thing, must be acceptable.</P>
<P>"If to revenge ourselves, or to render injury, evil for evil, wound for wound, to take eye for eye, tooth for tooth; if to fight for outward and perishing things; to go a warring one against ano∣ther, with whom we never saw, and with whom we never had any contest, nor any thing to do;

being moreover altogether ignorant of the cause of the war, but only that the magistrates of the nati∣ons foment quarrels against one another; the cau∣ses whereof are, for the most part, unknown to the soldiers, that fight, as well as upon whose side the right and wrong are; and yet to be so furious, and rage one against another, to destroy all, that this, or the other worship may be received, or be abolished; if to do this, and much more of this kind, be to fulfil the law of Christ, then are our adversaries, indeed, true <HI>Christians,</HI> and we miser∣able <HI>heretics,</HI> that suffer ourselves to be spoiled, ta∣ken, imprisoned, beaten and evilly treated, with∣out any resistance, <HI>placing our trust only in God,</HI> that he may defend us, and lead us, by the way of the <HI>cross,</HI> into his kingdom: but if it be other∣wise, we shall certainly receive the <HI>reward,</HI> which the Lord hath promised to those, <HI>that cleave to him,</HI> and, in denying themselves, <HI>confide in him.</HI></P>
<P>"And, to sum up all, if to use all these things, and many more, that might be instanced, be to <HI>walk in the strait way, that leads to life; be to take up the cross of Christ; be to die with him to the lusts, and perishing vanities of this world, and to arise with him in newness of life, and to sit down with him in the heavenly places,</HI> then our adversaries may be accounted such, and they need not fear, they are in the <HI>broad way which leads to destruction;</HI> and we are greatly mistaken, that have laid aside all these things for Christ's sake, to the crucifying of our own lusts, and to the procuring to ourselves shame, reproach, hatred and ill-will, from the men of this world: not as if, by so doing, we judged to merit heaven, but, as knowing they are contrary to the will of him, who redeems his children from the love of this world, and its lusts, and leads them in the ways of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>holiness,</HI> in which they take delight to walk."</P>

<P>"Their way of marriage is peculiar to them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their marriages, &amp;c.</NOTE> and shews a distinguishing care, above other socie∣ties, professing <HI>christianity.</HI> They say that marri∣age is an <HI>ordinance of God;</HI> and that <HI>God</HI> only can rightly join man and woman in marriage. There∣fore, they use neither <HI>priest</HI> nor <HI>magistrate;</HI> but the man and woman concerned take each other as husband and wife, in the presence of divers credi∣ble witnesses, <HI>promising to each other, with God's assistance, to be loving and faithful in that relation, till death shall separate them.</HI> But antecedent to this they first present themselves to the <HI>monthly meeting,</HI> for the affairs of the church, where they reside; there declaring their intentions to take one another, as <HI>husband and wife,</HI> if the said meeting have nothing material to object against it—they are constantly asked the necessary questions, as, in case of <HI>parents</HI> or <HI>guardians,</HI> if they have acquainted them with their intention, and have their consent, &amp;c.—The method of the meeting is, to take a minute thereof, and to appoint proper persons, to enquire of their conversation and clearness from all others, and whether they have discharged their duty to their parents, or guardians; and to make report thereof to the next <HI>monthly meeting,</HI> where the same parties are desired to give their attendance. In case it appears they have proceeded orderly, the meeting passes their proposal, and so records it in the <HI>meeting book.</HI> And in case the woman be a widow, and hath children, due care is there taken, that provision also be made by her for the <HI>orphans,</HI> before the meeting pass the proposals of marriage; advising the parties concerned, to appoint a conve∣nient time and place, and to give fitting notice to their relations, and such friends and neighbours as they desire should be witnesses of the marriage; where they take one another by the hand, and, by name, promise reciprocally, love and fidelity, after

the manner before expressed. Of all which pro∣ceedings, a narrative, in way of certificate, is made; to which the said parties set their hands, thereby confirming it as their act and deed; and then di∣vers relations, spectators and auditors, set their names, as witnesses of what they said and signed. And this certificate is afterwards registered in the record belonging to the meeting, where the mar∣riage is solemnized, which regular method has been, as it deserves, adjudged in courts of law a <HI>good marriage,</HI> where it has been, by cross and ill people, disputed and contested, for want of the accustomed formalites of <HI>priest</HI> and <HI>ring, &amp;c.</HI> ce∣remonies they have refused; not out of humour, but conscience reasonably grounded, in as much as no scripture example tells us, that the priest had any other part, of old time, than that of a witness, among the rest, before whom the Jews used to take one another: and therefore this people look upon it, as an imposition, to advance the power and profits of the clergy: and for the use of the <HI>ring,</HI> it is enough to say, that it was an <HI>heathenish</HI> and <HI>vain</HI> custom, and never in practice among the peo∣ple of God—Jews, or primitive Christians;—the words of the usual form, as, <HI>with my body I thee worship, &amp;c.</HI> are hardly defensible.

Neither do the kindred of the deceased ever wear <HI>mourning;</HI> they looking upon it, as a worldly ceremony and piece of pomp; and that what mourning is fit for a Chris∣tian to have, at the departure of a beloved rela∣tion, or friend, should be worn in the mind, which is only sensible of the loss: and the love they had to them, and the remembrance of them, to be outwardly expressed by a respect to their advice, and care of those they have left behind them, and their love of that they loved, which conduct of theirs, though unmodish or unfashionable leaves nothing of the substance of things neglected, or

<P>"And though they were not great and learned in the esteem of the world, (for then they had not wanted followers, upon their own credit and authority) yet they were generally of the most <HI>so∣ber</HI> of the several persuasions, they were in, and of the <HI>most repute,</HI> for religion; and many of them of good <HI>capacity, substance</HI> and <HI>account</HI> among men."</P>

<HEAD>Of their church discipline, from the same author, <HI>W. Penn.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their dis∣cipline, &amp;c.</NOTE>In the next place, in order to form some idea of the religious care, discipline, and practice, which they used as a Christian and reformed soci∣ety, also in a collective capacity, that they might live orderly and consistent with their principles and profession, the following extract, from <HI>W. Penn,</HI> exhibits the <HI>church power,</HI> which they owned and exercised, and that which they rejected and con∣demned, with the method of their proceedings against erring and disorderly persons, of their community, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"This people encreasing daily both in town and country, an <HI>holy care</HI> fell upon some of the <HI>elders</HI> among them, for the benefit and service of the church. And the first business, in their view, after the example of the primitive saints, was the exercise of <HI>charity;</HI> to supply the necessities of the poor, and answer the like occasions. Wherefore <HI>collections</HI> were early and liberally made for that, and divers other services, in the church, and in∣trusted with faithful men, fearing <HI>God,</HI> and of good report, who where not weary in <HI>well doing;</HI> adding often of <HI>their own,</HI> in large proportions, which they never brought to account, or desired should be known, much less restored to them, that none might want, nor any service be retarded, or disappointed."</P>
<P>"They were also very careful, that every one, who belonged to them, answered their profession, in their behaviour among men, upon all occasions; that they lived <HI>peaceably,</HI> and were, in all things, <HI>good examples.</HI> They found themselves engaged to record their <HI>sufferings</HI> and <HI>services;</HI> and in the case or <HI>marriage,</HI> which they could not perform in the usual methods of the nation, but among themselves; they took care that all things were <HI>clear</HI> between the parties, and all others, and it
<PB N="71" REF="032729_0071_0FF4EEC1A5CB23F0"/>
was then rare, that any one entertained an inclinati∣on to a person, on that account, till he, or she, had communicated it secretly to some very weighty and eminent friends among them, that they might have a sense of the matter; looking to the counsel and unity of their brethren, as of great moment to them. But because the charge of the poor, the number of orphans, marriages, sufferings and other matters, <HI>multiplied;</HI> and that it was good, that the churches were in some way and method of proceeding in such affairs, among them, to the end they might the better correspond, upon occasion, where a member of one meeting might have to do with one of another; it pleased the <HI>Lord,</HI> in his wisdom and goodness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Fox, the first instru∣ment, &amp;c.</NOTE> to open the understanding of the <HI>first instrument of this dispen∣sation of life, George Fox,</HI> about a good and orderly way of proceeding; who felt a holy concern to visit the churches, in person, throughout this na∣tion, to begin and establish it among them: and by his <HI>epistles,</HI> the like was done in other nations and provinces abroad; which he also afterwards visited and helped in that service."</P>
<P>"Now the care, conduct and discipline I have been speaking of, and which are now<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Written in 1694.</NOTE> practised among this people, are as follow:</P>
<P>"This <HI>godly elder,</HI> in every county where he travelled, exhorted them, that some out of every meeting of worship, should meet together, once in the month, to confer about the wants and oc∣casions of the church. And as the case required, so those <HI>monthly meetings</HI> were fewer, or more in number, in every respective county; four or six meetings of worship usually making one <HI>monthly meeting of business.</HI> And accordingly the brethren met him from place to place, and began the said meetings, <HI>viz.</HI> for the <HI>poor, orphans, orderly walk∣ing, integrity to their profession, births, marriages, burials, sufferings,</HI> &amp;c. And these <HI>monthly meetings</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="032729_0072_0FF4EE5E8DE4EA50"/>
should, in each county make up one <HI>quarterly meeting</HI> (held once every quarter of a year) where the most zealous and eminent friends of the county should <HI>assemble,</HI> to <HI>communicate advice,</HI> and <HI>help one another,</HI> especially when any business seemed difficult, or a <HI>monthly meeting</HI> was tender of deter∣mining a matter."</P>
<P>"Also that these several <HI>quarterly meetings</HI> should digest the reports of their <HI>monthly meetings,</HI> and prepare one for each respective county, once a year, against the <HI>yearly meeting,</HI> in which all <HI>quarterly meetings</HI> resolve; which is held in <HI>London:</HI> where the churches, in this nation, and other na∣tions and provinces, meet, by <HI>chosen members</HI> of their respective counties, both mutually to com∣municate their <HI>church affairs,</HI> and to advise and be advised, in any depending case, to edification. Also to provide a <HI>requisite stock,</HI> for the discharge of general expences, for general services, in the church not needful here to be particularized."</P>
<P>"At these meetings any of the members of the churches may come, if they please, and speak their minds freely, in the fear of <HI>God,</HI> to the mat∣ter; but the mind of each <HI>quarterly meeting</HI> therein represented, is chiefly understood, as to particular cases, in the sense delivered by the persons deputed or chosen, for that service by the said meeting."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their discipline, &amp;c.</NOTE>"During their <HI>yearly meeting,</HI> to which their other meetings refer, in their order, and natu∣rally resolve themselves, care is taken by a <HI>select number</HI> for that service, chosen by the gene∣ral assembly, to draw up the <HI>minutes</HI> of the said meeting, upon the several matters, that have been under consideration therein, to the end that the respective <HI>quarterly</HI> and <HI>monthly meetings</HI> may be in∣formed of all proceedings; together with a gene∣ral exhortation to <HI>holiness, unity</HI> and <HI>charity.</HI> Of all which proceedings, in <HI>yearly, monthly</HI> and <HI>quar∣terly</HI> meetings, due record is kept by some one ap∣pointed
<PB N="73" REF="032729_0073_0FF4EECE0FA8D1D0"/>
pointed for that service, or, that hath voluntarily undertaken it. These meetings are opened, and usually concluded, in their solemn waiting upon <HI>God;</HI> who is sometimes graciously pleased to an∣swer them with as <HI>signal evidences</HI> of his love and presence, as in any of their meetings of worship."</P>
<P>"It is further to be noted, that, in these <HI>solemn assemblies,</HI> for the churches service, there is no one presides among them, after the manner of the assemblies of other people; <HI>Christ</HI> only being their <HI>president,</HI> as <HI>he</HI> is pleased to appear in life and wisdom, in any one, or more of them, to whom, whatever be their capacity, or degree, the rest adhere with a firm unity, not of <HI>authority,</HI> but <HI>conviction;</HI> which is the divine authority and way of Christ's power and spirit in his people; making good his blessed promise, <HI>that he would be in the midst of his, where and whenever they were met to∣gether, in his name, even, to the end of the world.</HI> So be it."</P>
<P>"Now, it may be expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their church power and authority.</NOTE> I should here set down what sort of <HI>authority</HI> is exercised by this peo∣ple, upon such members of their society as corres∣pond not, in their <HI>lives,</HI> with their <HI>profession,</HI> and that are <HI>refractory</HI> to this good and wholesome or∣der, settled among them; and the rather, because they have not wanted their reproach and sufferings from some tongues and pens, upon this occasion, in a plentiful manner.</P>
<P>"The power, they exercise, is such as <HI>Christ</HI> has given to his own people, to the end of the world, in the persons of his disciples, <HI>viz. to over∣see, exhort, reprove, and, after long suffering and waiting upon the disobedient and refractory, to disown them,</HI> as any more of their <HI>communion,</HI> or, that they will any longer stand charged, in the sight and judgment of <HI>God</HI> or <HI>men,</HI> with their conversation, or behaviour, as any of them, until they <HI>repent.</HI> The subject matter about which this authority, in
<PB N="74" REF="032729_0074_0FF4EE6A4A141018"/>
any of the foregoing branches of it, is exercised, is first, in relation to <HI>common</HI> or <HI>general practice.</HI> And, secondly, about those things, that more strictly refer to their own <HI>character</HI> and profession, and which distinguishes them from all other pro∣fessors of <HI>Christianity;</HI> avoiding two extremes, upon which many split, <HI>viz. persecution</HI> and <HI>liber∣tinism;</HI> that is a coercive power, <HI>to whip people in∣to the temple;</HI> that such as will not conform, though against faith and conscience, shall be punished, in their <HI>persons</HI> and <HI>estates:</HI> or, leaving all loose, and at large, as to <HI>practice;</HI> and so unaccountable to all but <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>magistrate.</HI> To which hurtful ex∣treme, nothing has more contributed, than the abuse of <HI>church power,</HI> by such as suffer their pas∣sion, and private interest to prevail with them, to carry it to outward force, and corporal punish∣ment. A practice, they have been taught to dis∣like, by their extreme sufferings, as well as their known principle for an <HI>universal liberty of con∣science."</HI></P>
<P>"On the other hand, they equally dislike an <HI>independency,</HI> in society, an <HI>unaccountableness</HI> in <HI>prac∣tice</HI> and <HI>conversation,</HI> to the <HI>rules</HI> and <HI>terms</HI> of their own communion, and to those, that are the mem∣bers of it. They distinguish between imposing any practice, that immediately regards <HI>faith</HI> or <HI>wor∣ship</HI> (which is never to be done, or suffered, or submitted to) and requiring Christian compliance with those methods, that only respect church busi∣ness, in its more civil part and concern; and that regard the <HI>discreet and orderly maintenance</HI> of the character of the society, as a sober and religious community. In short, what is for the promotion of <HI>holiness</HI> and <HI>charity,</HI> that men may practise what they profess, live up to their <HI>own principles,</HI> and not be at liberty to give the <HI>lye</HI> to their own pro∣fession, without <HI>rebuke,</HI> is their use and limit of church power. They compel none to them; but
<PB N="75" REF="032729_0075_0FF4EECFA0DC52B0"/>
oblige those that are of them, to <HI>walk suitably,</HI> or they are denied by them: that is all the <HI>mark,</HI> they set upon them, and the power they exercise, or judge a Christian society can exercise upon those that are members of it."</P>
<P>"The way of their proceeding against such as have lapsed or transgressed, is this: He is visited by some of them, and the matter of fact laid home to him, be it any evil practice against known and general virtue, or any branch of their parti∣cular testimony, which he, in common, professeth with them. They labour with him in much love and zeal, for the <HI>good of his soul,</HI> the <HI>honor of God,</HI> and <HI>reputation</HI> of their profession, to own his fault, and condemn it, in as ample a manner, as the evil, or scandal was given by him; which, for the most part, is performed by some <HI>written testimony,</HI> under the party's hand; and if it so happen, that the party prove <HI>refractory</HI> and is not willing to clear the <HI>truth,</HI> they profess, from the reproach of his, or her, evil doing, or unfaithfulness, they, after re∣peated entreaties, and due waiting for a token of repentance, give forth a paper to disown such a fact, and the party offending: recording the same, as a testimony of their care for the honor of the truth, they profess."</P>
<P>"And if he, or she, shall clear the <HI>profession,</HI> and <HI>themselves,</HI> by sincere acknowledgment of their fault, and godly sorrow for so doing, they are <HI>received,</HI> and <HI>looked upon again as members of their communion.</HI> For, as <HI>God,</HI> so his true people <HI>upbraid no man</HI> after repentance."</P>
<P>That the general conduct and practice of this people have been, in a remarkable manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their con∣sistency in conduct with their profession, &amp;c.</NOTE> con∣sistent with their profession, we are well assured, not only by the accounts given by themselves, but also by those of others, who appear to have been best acquainted with their manner of life, in early
<PB N="76" REF="032729_0076_0FF4EE6BDADD8870"/>
time; and whose certain knowledge enabled them to speak with that moderation, which is divested of passion and prejudice; besides, it is manifest from the many acrimonious and abusive writings of their enemies themselves against them, yet ex∣tant, that their conformity to the principles and customs before mentioned, was the chief cause of the severe <HI>persecution</HI> and <HI>suffering;</HI> which they so long endured:—for which, if any instances of in∣temperate zeal, in early time, appeared in any individuals among them, (from which, probably, the first rise of no religious society has been en∣tirely free) it seems to have been too much the delight of their adversaries to exaggerate and mis∣represent them.—For, as they professed no theory, but what they chiefly derived from practice or con∣viction; nor speculation, but what they principal∣ly had from experiment, so it has been long ob∣served, particularly in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that, as any of the members of this society failed in the practi∣cal part, they consequently, for the most part, discontinued the profession, in proportion; and either went over to such other religious societies, as place less stress on the practice of <HI>Christianity,</HI> or of true religion; or else they made no formal profession of it at all, with any particular set of people: some apparently from an irreligious, mean and indolent, or depraved turn of mind; and others, probably, from looking upon all forms of religion, as <HI>vain;</HI> and that the knowledge of truth, and the interior of religion, or the intercourse be∣tween the creature and the Creator, depends not upon, nor is necessarily connected with, any fixed form; but is rather obscured, or impeded, by that attention, which such forms, in general require; or which ultimately have so much tendency to en∣gross the minds of many people with that slavish formality, which is observable to terminate in mere, religious superstition.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="032729_0077_0FF4EED1329ABE10"/>Nevertheless it is well known, that in later times, divers among them have been observed, under the covering of a plain garb, and a formal compliance to sundry of these external customs, before men∣tioned, to make this profession an engine to accu∣mulate wealth, and from an apparent zeal for their profession, in divers of those very things, without the possession of the real life, or substance, of it, have notwithstanding continued among them, and used that credit and reputation, which the society, in general, had acquired by a better principle, so as to obtain low, terrestrial enjoyments, and worldly advantages, even, beyond others of the same degree, or rank of people. For it cannot be reasonably supposed that every person who is born and educated, or brought up, merely in the form, is therefore consequently experienced in every practical truth of the profession, so much as those, who have embraced the same from real con∣viction and experience, in their own minds, unless they possess the same experience and enjoyment; which may, or may not be the case; for profes∣sion, or implicit belief, alone, cannot give a lively experience, nor a bare assent, convince the judg∣ment.</P>
<P>But the Christian care of this society, as ap∣pears by their discipline, already mentioned, as well as by the many additions, since made by them, to this part of their religious oeconomy, has not been small, to prevent and redress this evil, as well as to remedy all other deviations from the truth of their profession, and the primitive practice among them; which, in some or other of their members, cannot but sometimes happen, while in this frail and mortal state of existence:— Yet the result of this very care, so far, at least, as it respects the external obligations, upon the members of this society, and the many rules in∣creased from time to time, among them, for that purpose, it is thought by some, has had this cer∣tain
<PB N="78" REF="032729_0078_0FF4EE6D6C757458"/>
and inevitable tendency, to render it, in fact, more <HI>formal,</HI> and to distinguish it more, in reali∣ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See R. Bar∣clay on uni∣versal love, &amp;c.</NOTE> as a <HI>sect,</HI> than some of its first, or early prin∣cipal founders, by their writings, appear to have intended; who would not admit of that name, nor the natural contractedness of such a distinction, particularly R. Barclay, and others among them.</P>
<P>I shall, therefore, after having, in a few words, further expressed respecting them, in early time, from two persons of eminence in their religious society, <HI>W. Penn</HI> and <HI>W. Edmundson,</HI> conclude this account. The former, addressing himself to them, speaks thus, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's account of the religi∣ous lives of the primi∣tive Qua∣kers.</NOTE>"The glory of this day, and foundation of the hope, that has not made us ashamed since we were a people,"—"is that blessed principle of light and life of <HI>Christ,</HI> which we profess, and direct all people to, as the <HI>great and divine instrument</HI> and agent of man's conversion to God. It was by this, that we were first touched, and effectually enlightened, as to our inward state; which put us upon the con∣sideration of our latter end, causing us to set the <HI>Lord</HI> before our eyes, and to number our days, that we might apply our hearts to wisdom. In that day we judged not after the sight of the <HI>eye,</HI> or after the hearing of the <HI>car,</HI> but according to the <HI>light</HI> and <HI>sense</HI> this blessed principle gave us, so we judged and acted, in reference to things and per∣sons, ourselves and others; yea towards <HI>God,</HI> our Maker: for, being quickened by it in our <HI>inward man,</HI> we could easily discern the difference of things, and feel what was right, and what was wrong, and what was fit, and what was not, both in reference to religion and civil concerns. That being the ground of the fellowship of all saints; it was in that our fellowship stood. In this we desired to have a sense of one another, acted towards one another, and all men, <HI>in love, faithfulness and fear."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="032729_0079_0FF4EED2C6D11248"/>"In feeling of the stirrings and motions of this principle in our hearts, we drew near to the <HI>Lord,</HI> and waited to be prepared by it; that we might <HI>feel drawings</HI> and <HI>movings,</HI> before we approached the <HI>Lord</HI> in prayer, or opened our mouths in ministry. And in our beginning and ending with this, stood our <HI>comfort, service</HI> and <HI>edification.</HI> And, as we ran faster, or fell short, in our services, we made burdens for ourselves to bear; finding in ourselves a rebuke, instead of an acceptance; and in lieu of <HI>well done, "Who has required this at your hands?"</HI> In that day we were an exercised people; our very countenances and deportment declared it."</P>
<P>"Care for others was then much upon us, as well as for ourselves; especially of the <HI>young convinced.</HI> Oft had we the burden of the word of the <HI>Lord</HI> to our <HI>neighbours, relations</HI> and <HI>acquaintance;</HI> and sometimes strangers also. We were in travail like∣wise for one another's preservation; not seeking, but shunning occasions of any coldness, or misun∣derstanding; treating one another as those that be∣lieved and felt <HI>God present.</HI> which kept our con∣versation <HI>innocent, serious</HI> and <HI>weighty;</HI> guarding ourselves against the cares and friendships of this world. We held the truth in the spirit of it, and not in our own spirits, or after our own wills and affections, they were bowed and brought into sub∣jection, insomuch that it was visible to them, that knew us. We did not think ourselves at our own <HI>disposal,</HI> to go where we list, or say, or do, what we list, or when we list. Our liberty stood in the liberty of truth; and no <HI>pleasure,</HI> no <HI>profit,</HI> no <HI>fear,</HI> no <HI>favour,</HI> could draw us from this retired, strict and watchful frame. We were as far from seeking occasions of company, that we avoided them what we could, pursuing our own business with moderation, instead of meddling with other people's <HI>unnecessarily."</HI></P>
<P>"Our words were few and savory, our looks composed and weighty, and our whole deportment

very observable. True it is, that this retired and strict sort of life from the liberty of the conversa∣tion of the world, exposed us to the censures of many, as <HI>humorists, conceited,</HI> and <HI>selfrighteous</HI> per∣sons, &amp;c. but it was our preservation from many snares, to which others were continually exposed, by the prevalency of the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life, that wanted no occasions, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> temptations to excite them abroad, in the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rse of the world."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Ed∣mundson's account of the religi∣ous lives of the primi∣tive Qua∣kers.</NOTE>The words of <HI>W. Edmundson,</HI> on this head, are these,—"At the first, when the Lord called and gathered us to be a people, and opened the eyes of our understandings, then we saw the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and the wickedness that was in the world; and a perfect abhorrence was fixed, in our hearts, against all the wicked, unjust, vain, un∣godly, unlawful part of the world, in all respects; and we saw the goodly, and most glorious <HI>lawful things</HI> of this world to be abused; and that many snares and temptations lay in them; and many troubles and dangers of divers kinds; and we felt the load of them, and that we could not carry them, and run the race, the Lord had set before us, so cheerfully as to win the prize of salvation; so that our care was to cast off this great load and burden of our great and gainful way of getting riches, and to lessen our concerns therein, to the compass that we might not be chargeable to any, in our stations and services required of us, and be ready to an∣swer Christ Jesus, our Captain, that called us to follow him, in a spiritual warfare, under the dis∣cipline of his daily cross and self-denial; and then the things of this world were of small value with us, so that we might win Christ; and the goodliest things of the world were not near us, so that we might be near the Lord; and the Lord's truth outbalanced all the world, even the most glorious, part of it. Then great trading was a burden, and
<PB N="81" REF="032729_0081_0FF4EEDE03892E90"/>
great concerns a great trouble; all needless things, fine houses, rich furniture, gaudy apparel, were an eye-sore; our eye being single to the Lord, and the inshining of his light, in our hearts; which gave us the sight of the knowledge of the glory of God; which so affected our minds, that it stained the glory of all earthly things; and they bore no mastry with us, either in dwelling, eating, drinking, buying, selling, marrying, or giving in marriage. The Lord was the object of our eye; and we all humble and low before him, and self of small re∣pute; ministers and elders, in all such cases, walk∣ing as good examples, that the flock might follow their foot-steps, as they followed Christ; in the dairy cross of self-denial, in their dwellings, cal∣lings, eating, drinking, buying, selling, marrying, and giving in marriage; and this answered the <HI>Lord's</HI> witness in all consciences, and gave us great credit among men."</P>
<P>Such appear to have been the people called <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> as to their first rise, principles, doctrines, religious system, and general practice, or manners, in early time; with whom <HI>W. Penn</HI> joined in soci∣ty; such they appear to have been, who principally first settled <HI>West Jersey</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania:</HI>—By a conduct influenced chiefly by the principles above mentioned has this country providentially advanc∣ed to that justly admired and happy state, and im∣portance, for which, it has now long been grow∣ing more and more conspicuous:—Of this people as a religious society, I shall, at present take my leave, till I again revisit them, as transplanted from <HI>Europe,</HI> into these provinces, and observe their pro∣ceedings, in their new and political situation; in the mean time, I return to, and resume, my inter∣mitted account of the life of <HI>W. Penn.</HI></P>
<P>About this time (1668, and the twenty-fourth year of his age) <HI>William Penn</HI> published several of his first pieces, now extant in his printed works;
<PB N="82" REF="032729_0082_0FF4EE7A5B15EA08"/>
one of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1668. W. Penn's first writ∣ings, &amp;c.</NOTE> entitled, <HI>"The sandy foundation shaken,"</HI> was written in consequence of a dispute, which he had in <HI>London</HI> with one <HI>Vincent,</HI> a Pres∣byter. In this he exposed the vulgar notion of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and some other religious tenets; which gave so much offence to those then at the helm of the church, that they immediately took the old method of reforming what they called er∣ror, by their strongest argument, <HI>viz. "An order for imprisoning him in the tower of London;"</HI>—there he was under close confinement, and even denied the visits of his friends:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His impri∣sonment in the tower of London.</NOTE> but yet his enemies attained not their purpose; for when, after some time, his servant brought him word, that the bishop of <HI>London</HI> was resolved he should either publicly re∣cant, or die a prisoner, he made this reply: "All is well: I wish they had told me so before; since the expecting a release put a stop to some business: thou mayst tell my father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His resolu∣tion.</NOTE> who, I know, will ask thee these words; that my prison shall be my grave, before I will budge a jot; for I owe my conscience to no mortal man. I have no need to fear; God will make amends for all. They are mistaken in me; I value not their threats and resolutions: for they shall know I can weary out their malice and peevishness; and in me shall they all behold a re∣solution above fear; conscience above cruelty; and a baffle put upon all their designs, by the spirit of patience, the companion of all the tribulated flock of the blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> who is the author and finisher of the faith, that overcomes the world, yea, death and hell too. Neither great nor good things were ever attained without loss and hard∣ships. He that would reap and not labor must faint with the wind, and perish in disappointments: but an hair of my head shall not fall without the providence of my Father, that is over all."</P>
<P>"A spirit warmed with the love of God" (says the writer of his life) "and devoted to his service,

ever pursues its main purpose: he,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He writes several treatises in the tower.</NOTE> being now re∣strained from preaching, applied himself to writ∣ing; several treatises were the fruits of his solitude, particularly, that excellent one, entitled, <HI>No cross, no crown;</HI> a book, which, tending to promote the general design of religion, was well accepted, and soon past several impressions."</P>
<P>He also, in the year 1669, writ, from the tower, a letter to the lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> then principal secre∣tary of state, by whose warrant he was committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1669. He writes to the Lord Arlington, &amp;c.</NOTE> in vindication of his innocence, and to remove some aspersions cast upon him; in this letter, with christian boldness, and elegance of stile, he pleads the reasonableness of toleration in religion, shews the singular injustice of his imprisonment, and de∣clares his firm resolution to suffer, rather than give up his cause; he likewise requests the secre∣tary to lay his case before the king, and desires he may be ordered a release; but, if that should be denied, he intreats the favour of access to the royal presence, or at least, that the secretary him∣self would please to give him a full hearing, &amp;c. And in order to clear himself from the aspersions, cast on him, in relation to the <HI>doctrines of the Trinity,</HI> the <HI>incarnation,</HI> and <HI>satisfaction of Christ,</HI> he published a little book called, <HI>"Innocency with her open face,"</HI> by way of apology for the aforesaid, <HI>Sandy foundation shaken:</HI> in this apology he so suc∣cessfully vindicated himself, that soon after the publication thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is dis∣charged.</NOTE> he was discharged from his imprisonment; which had been of about seven months continuance.</P>
<P>In the latter part of the summer this year, he went again to <HI>Ireland.</HI> Being arrived at <HI>Cork,</HI> he there visited his friends the <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He goes to Ireland.</NOTE> who were in prison, for their religion, attended the meetings of his society, and afterwards went from thence to <HI>Dublin;</HI> where an account of his friends sufferings
<PB N="84" REF="032729_0084_0FF4EE7C0889F190"/>
being drawn up, by way of address, it was by him presented to the lord lieutenant.</P>
<P>During his stay in <HI>Ireland,</HI> though his business, in the care of his father's estate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His busi∣ness there.</NOTE> took up a consi∣derable part of his time, yet he frequently attend∣ed, and preached in the meetings of his friends, especially at <HI>Dublin</HI> and <HI>Cork;</HI> in one of which places he usually resided. He also wrote, during his residence there, several treatises, and took every opportunity in his power, to sollicit those in autho∣rity, in behalf of his friends in prison: and, in the beginning of the fourth month, 1670, through his repeated applications to the chancellor, the lord <HI>Arran,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> and the lord lieutenant, an order of coun∣cil was obtained for their release. Having settled his father's concerns to satisfaction, and done his friends, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> many signal services, he shortly after returned to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1670 was passed the <HI>conventicle act,</HI> which prohibited the meetings of the dissenters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> under severe penalties. The rigour of this law was immediately executed upon the <HI>Quakers;</HI> who not being used to give way, in the cause of religi∣on, stood most exposed. They being kept out of their meeting house, in <HI>Grace-church</HI> street in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> by force, met in the street itself, as near it as they could: <HI>W. Penn,</HI> preaching here, was ap∣prehended, and by warrant, dated August four∣teenth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is com∣mitted to Newgate.</NOTE> 1670, from Sir <HI>Samuel Starling,</HI> the lord <HI>mayor,</HI> committed to <HI>Newgate;</HI> and, at the next sessions, at the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> was, together with <HI>William Mead,</HI> indicted for being present at, and preaching to, an unlawful, seditious and riotous as∣sembly. At his trial be made such an excellent de∣fence, as discovered at once both the free spirit of an <HI>Englishman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Famous tri∣al of Penn and Mead.</NOTE> and the undaunted magnanimity of a <HI>Christian;</HI> insomuch that notwithstanding the most partial frowns and menaces of the bench, the
<PB N="85" REF="032729_0085_0FF4EEE121DB1570"/>
jury acquitted him. The trial itself was soon af∣ter printed; it exhibits a signal instance of the attempts of the ignorance and tyranny of that time; and may be seen in his printed works.</P>
<P>Not long after this famous trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His father's reconcilia∣tion and death.</NOTE> and his dis∣charge from <HI>Newgate,</HI> his father died, entirely re∣conciled to his son; to whom, as before observed, he left both his paternal blessing, and a plentiful estate. His death-bed expressions, and last advice are very remarkable, instructive, and may be seen in <HI>W. Penn's</HI> treatise, entitled, <HI>No cross, no crown,</HI> among the sayings of other eminent persons.</P>
<P>He was about this time employed in defence of his religious principles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670. He disputes with J. Ives and visits Oxford, &amp;c.</NOTE> in a public dispute with one <HI>Jeremy Ives,</HI> a celebrated <HI>Baptist.</HI> Afterwards in the ninth month this year, being at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and observing the cruel usage and persecution, which his innocent friends suffered there from the junior scholars, too much by the connivance of their su∣periors, he wrote a letter to the vice chancellor, on the subject.</P>
<P>In the winter, this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He publish∣es a book against Po∣pery, &amp;c.</NOTE> having his residence at <HI>Penn,</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> he published a book, entitled, <HI>"A reasonable caveat against Popery;"</HI> wherein he both exposes and confutes many erro∣neous doctrines of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and esta∣blishes the opposite truths, by sound arguments; a work alone sufficient, on the one hand, to wipe off the calumny, cast upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> of being a favourer of the <HI>Romish</HI> religion; and, on the other, to shew, that his principle being for an universal liberty of conscience, he would have had it extended, even to the Papists themselves, under a security of their not persecuting others.</P>
<P>In the last month of this year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is taken and carried to the tow∣er, &amp;c.</NOTE> while he was preaching in a religious meeting of his friends, in <HI>Wheeler-street, London,</HI> he was forceably seized by a party of soldiers, sent thither for that purpose,
<PB N="86" REF="032729_0086_0FF4EE7D98F8BEF8"/>
and brought to the <HI>tower,</HI> by an order from the lieutenant. In his examination, on the occasion, before the lieutenant of the tower, Sir <HI>John Robin∣son, Starling,</HI> the lord mayor, and others, his be∣haviour was very remarkable, spirited and extraor∣dinarily adapted to the nature of the occasion. It may be seen in the printed account of his life, prefixed to his literary works; in which, as the lieutenant's words and conduct appear high, imperious, and towards him manifestly inimical, so his replies were smart, sensible and bold: and, on the lieutenant's charging him with his having been as bad as other people, and that both at home and abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A remarka∣ble answer.</NOTE> he received this remarkable answer from <HI>W. Penn, viz.</HI> "I make this bold challenge to all men, women and children upon earth, justly to ac∣cuse me, with ever having seen me drunk, heard me swear, utter a curse, or speak one obscene word, (much less that I ever made it my practice) I speak this to God's glory, that has preserved me from the power of those pollutions, and that, from a child, begot an hatred in me towards them. But there is nothing more common, than when men are of a more severe life than ordinary, for loose persons to comfort themselves with the conceit, <HI>that they were once as they are,</HI> as if there were no collateral, or oblique line of the compass, or globe, men may be said to come from to the <HI>Arctic pole,</HI> but directly and immediately from the <HI>An∣tarctic.

<HEAD>To the high court of Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>Forasmuch as it hath pleased you to make an <HI>act,</HI> entitled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1671. Applicati∣on to parli∣ament in behalf of his suffer∣ing friends.</NOTE> <HI>"An act for suppressing seditious con∣venticles, the dangerous practices of seditious sectaries, &amp;c."</HI> and that, under pretence of authority from it, many have taken the ungodly liberty of plun∣dering, pillaging and breaking into houses, to the ruin and detriment of whole families, not re∣garding the poor, the widow and the fatherless, beyond all precedent, or excuse; and, that we are informed it is your purpose, instead of relaxing your hand, to supply the defects of that act, by such explanatory clauses as will inevitably expose us to the fury and interest of our several adversa∣ries; that under pretence of answering the in∣tents of the said act, will only gratify their private humours, and doubtless extend it beyond its origi∣nal purpose, to the utter destruction of us, and our suffering friends.</P>
<P>We, therefore, esteem ourselves obliged, in Christian duty, once more to remonstrate:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That we own civil government, or ma∣gistracy, as God's ordinance, for the punishment of evil doers, and the praise of them, that do well; and though we cannot comply with those laws that prohibit us to worship God, according to our con∣sciences, as believing it to be his alone prerogative, to preside in matters of faith and worship, yet we both own and are ready to yield obedience to every ordinance of man, relating to human affairs, and that for conscience sake.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That we deny and renounce, as an horrible impiety, all plots and conspiracies, or to promote our interest, or religion, by the blood and destruction of such us dissent from us, or yet those, that persecute us.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That in all revolutions we have de∣meaned ourselves with much peace and patience
<PB N="88" REF="032729_0088_0FF4EE7F2C69E750"/>
(disowning all contrary actings) notwithstanding the numerous prosecutions of cruel and ungodly men; which is a demonstration of our harmless behaviour, that ought not to be of little moment with you.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That as we have ever lived most peaceably under all the various governments, that have been since our first appearance, (notwithstand∣ing we have been as their anvil, to smite upon) so we do hereby signify, that it is our fixed resolution to continue the same; that where we cannot actu∣ally obey, we patiently shall suffer, (leaving our innocent cause without daring to love ourselves unto the death, for our blessed testimony's sake) there∣by manifesting to the whole world, that we love God above all, and our neighbours as ourselves.</P>
<P>If this prevails not with you to suspend your thoughts of reinforcing your former act, we do desire that we, or some of our friends, may receive a fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearing from you, (as several of us had upon the first act for uniformity) having many great and weighty reasons to offer against all such severe proceedings, to the end all wrong measures of us, and of our principles, may be rectified; and, that you, being better informed of both, may remove our heavy burdens, and let the op∣pressed go free; for such moderation will be well pleasing both to God and good men.</P>

<P>About this time many opposers of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> some of whom being dissenters themselves, who had enough to do in time of persecution, by a <HI>cau∣tious privacy,</HI> which they called <HI>christian prudence,</HI> to secure their heads from the storm, began, under the sun-shine of the king's indulgence, to peep out, and (in the words of the writer of <HI>W.

<HEAD>His first speech to the committee.</HEAD>
<P>"If we ought to believe that it is our duty, according to the doctrine of the apostle, to be always ready to give an account of the hope, that is in us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1678. W. P's. first speech to committee of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and that to every sober and private enquirer; certainly much more ought we to hold ourselves obliged to declare, with all readiness, when called to it by so great authority, what is <HI>not</HI> our <HI>hope,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="032729_0095_0FF4EEF28C98C6F8"/>
especially when our very safety is eminently con∣cerned in so doing, and that we cannot decline this discrimination of ourselves from <HI>Papists,</HI> without being conscious to ourselves of the guilt of our own sufferings; for that must every man needs be, that suffers mutely, under another character than that, which truly and properly belongeth to him, and his belief. That which giveth me a more than ordinary right to speak, at this time, and in this place, is the great abuse, that I have received, above any other of my profession; for, of a long time, I have not only been supposed a Papist, but a <HI>seminary,</HI> a <HI>Jesuit,</HI> an <HI>emissary</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and in pay from the <HI>Pope,</HI> a man dedicating my endea∣vours to the interest and advancement of that party. Nor hath this been the report of the rabble, but the jealousy and insinuation of persons otherwise sober and discreet: Nay, some zealous for the Protestant religion, have been so far gone in this mistake, as not only to think ill of us, and to de∣cline our conversation, but to take courage to them∣selves, to prosecute us for a sort of concealed Pa∣pists; and the truth is, what with one thing, and what with another, we have been as the <HI>wool-sacks,</HI> and common <HI>whipping-stock</HI> of the kingdom; all laws have been let loose upon us, as if the design were not to reform, but to destroy us, and that not for what <HI>we are,</HI> but for what <HI>we are not:</HI> It is hard, that we must thus bear the stripes of another interest, and be their proxy, in punishment; but it is worse, that some men can please themselves in such a sort of administration."</P>
<P>"I would not be mistaken, I am far from think∣ing it fit that <HI>Papists</HI> should be whipped for their consciences, because I exclaim against the injustice of whipping <HI>Quakers</HI> for <HI>Papists:</HI> No, for though the hand, pretended to be lifted up against them, hath (I know not by what direction) lit heavy upon us, and we complain; yet we do not mean, that
<PB N="96" REF="032729_0096_0FF4EE8F1E6C3D10"/>
any should take a fresh aim at them, or that they must come in our room; for we must give the liberty we ask, and cannot be false to our princi∣ples, though it were to relieve ourselves; for we have <HI>good will</HI> to all men, and would have none suffer for a truly sober and conscientious dissent, on any hand: and I humbly take leave to add, that those methods, against persons so qualified, do not seem to me to be convincing, or indeed adequate to the <HI>reason</HI> of mankind; but this I submit to your consideration."</P>
<P>"To conclude, I hope we shall be held excused of the men of that profession, in giving this dis∣tinguishing declaration, since it is not with design to expose them; but, first, to pay that regard, we owe to the enquiry of this <HI>committee;</HI> and, in the next place, to relieve ourselves from the daily spoil and ruin, which now attend and threaten many hundreds of families, by the execution of <HI>laws,</HI> that we humbly conceive were never made against us."</P>

P's. second speech to the com∣mittee of parliament.</NOTE>"The candid hearing, our sufferings have re∣ceived from the <HI>committee,</HI> and the fair and easy en∣tertainment, that you have given us, oblige me to add what ever can increase your satisfaction about us. I hope you do not believe, I would tell you a <HI>lie;</HI> I am sure I should choose an ill time and place to tell it in; but, I thank God it is too late in the day for that. There are some here that have known me formerly; I believe they will say, I ne∣ver was <HI>that man;</HI> and it would be hard, if after a voluntary neglect of the advantages of this world, I should sit down, in my retirement, short of com∣mon truth."</P>
<P>"Excuse the length of my introduction, it is for this I make it. I was bred a <HI>Protestant,</HI> and that strictly too: I lost nothing by time or study; for
<PB N="97" REF="032729_0097_0FF4EEFE2F302F58"/>
years, reading, travel and observations made the religion of my education the religion of my judg∣ment: my alteration hath brought none to that be∣lief; and though the posture I am in may seem odd, or strange to you, yet I am conscientious; and (till you know me better) I hope your charity will ra∣ther call it my unhappiness, than my crime. I do tell you again, and here solemly declare, in the pre∣sence of Almighty God, and before you all, that the profession I now make, and the society I now adhere to, have been so far from altering that <HI>Pro∣testant</HI> judgment I had, that I am not conscious to myself of having receded from an <HI>iota</HI> of any one principle, maintained by those first <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>reformers</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> and our own <HI>martyrs,</HI> at home, against the <HI>Pope, and See of Rome.</HI></P>
<P>"On the contrary, I do, with great truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1678. W. P's. se∣cond speech to the com∣mittee of parliament.</NOTE> assure you, that we are of the same negative faith, with the ancient <HI>Protestant church,</HI> and, upon occasion, shall be ready, by God's assistance, to make it ap∣pear, that we are of the same belief, as to the most fundamental <HI>possitive articles of her creed</HI> too. And, therefore it is, we think it hard, that though we deny, in common with her, those doctrines of <HI>Rome,</HI> so zealously <HI>protested</HI> against, from whence the name <HI>Protestants;</HI> yet that we should be so un∣happy as to suffer, and that with extreme severity, by those very laws on purpose made against the maintainers of those doctrines, we do so deny. We chuse no suffering, for God knows what we have already suffered, and how many sufficient and trading families are reduced to great poverty by it. We think ourselves an useful people: we are sure we are a peaceable people; but, if we still suffer, let us not suffer as <HI>Popish recusants,</HI> but as <HI>Protes∣testant dissenters.</HI></P>
<P>"But I would obviate another objection, and that none of the least, that hath been made against us, <HI>viz. That we are enemies to government, in gene∣ral,
<PB N="98" REF="032729_0098_0FF4EE9BD2A62F68"/>
and particularly disaffected to this we live under:</HI> I think it not amiss, but very seasonable, yea, my duty, now to declare to you, (and that I do with good conscience, in the sight of the Almighty God) first, that we believe <HI>government</HI> to be <HI>God's ordi∣nance;</HI> and next, that this <HI>present government</HI> is established by the <HI>providence of God,</HI> and <HI>law of the land,</HI> and that it is our <HI>christian duty</HI> readily to obey it, in all <HI>just laws;</HI> and wherein we cannot comply, through <HI>tenderness</HI> of <HI>conscience,</HI> in all such cases, not to revile, or conspire against the government, but, with christian humility and patience tire out all mistakes about us; and wait their better informa∣tion; who, we believe, do as undeservedly as severe∣ly treat us; and I know not what greater security can be given by any people, or how any govern∣ment can be easier from the subjects of it.</P>
<P>"I shall conclude with this; that we are so far from esteeming it hard, or ill, that the house hath put us upon this discrimination, that, on the con∣trary, we value it as we ought to do, for an high favour, (and cannot chuse but see, and humbly acknowledge God's providence therein) that you should give us this fair occasion to discharge our∣selves of a burden we have, not with more patience than injustice, suffered but too many years under; and I hope our conversation shall always manifest the grateful resentment of our minds, for the jus∣tice and civility of this opportunity; and so I pray God direct you."</P>

in and through these sufferings: there is food in affliction, and though the instruments of it cannot see it, all shall work together for good to them that fear the Lord: keep your ground in the <HI>truth,</HI> that was, and is the saints victory. They that shrink, go out of it; it is a shield to the righteous: feel it, and see, I charge you by the presence of the Lord, that you turn not aside the Lord's end towards you, in this suffering, by consulting with flesh and blood, in easing your adversaries; for that will load you. Keep out of base bargainings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1681. W.

The Lord God, by his power, keep your hearts living to him; that it may be your delight to <HI>wait</HI> upon him, and receive the bounty of his love; that, being fed with his daily bread and drinking of his cup of blessing, you may be raised above the fear and trouble of earthly things and grow strong in him, who is your crown of rejoicing; that, havi∣ng answered his requirings, and walked faithfully before him, you may receive, in the end of your days, the welcome sentence of gladness. <HI>Eternal

<P>So, my dear friends and brethren, endure, that you may be saved, and you shall reap, if you faint not. What should we be troubled for? our kingdom is not of <HI>this world,</HI> nor can be shaken by the overturning here below. Let all give glory to God on high, live peaceably on earth, and shew good will to all men; and our enemies will at last, see they do they know not what, and repent, and glorify God, our heavenly Father. O! great is God's work on earth. Be <HI>universal</HI> in your spirits, and keep out all straitness and narrowness: look to God's great and glorious kingdom, and its pro∣sperity: our time is not our own, nor are we our own: God hath bought us with a price, not to serve ourselves, but to glorify him, both in body, soul and spirit; and, by bodily sufferings for the truth, he is glorified: look to the accomplishing of the will of God, in these things; that the measure of Christ's sufferings may be filled up in us, who bear about the "dying of the Lord Jesus;" else our suffering is in vain. Wherefore, as the flock of God, and family and house-hold of faith, walk with your loins girded, being sober, hoping to the end, for the grace and kindness, which shall be brought unto you, at the revelation of Jesus Christ, to whom you and your's are committed: his pre∣cious spirit minister unto you, and his own life be shed abroad plenteously among you, that you may be kept blameless to the end. I am your friend and brother in the fellowship of the suffer∣ing for <HI>truth,</HI> as it is in <HI>Jesus,</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Good Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Sir <HI>Edmund,</HI> our noble governor and lord, ear! <HI>Palatine,</HI> persisting still in his noble purpose, to go on with his plantation, on <HI>De∣laware</HI> or <HI>Charles's</HI> river, just midway between <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> where, with my unkle <HI>Young,</HI> I several years resided, hath often informed himself, both of me and master <HI>Stratton,</HI> as I perceive by the hands subscribed, of <HI>Edward Monmouth, Tenis Palec,</HI> and as master <HI>Buck∣ham,</HI> master <HI>White,</HI> and other ship masters and sailors, whose hands I know, and it to be true, that there lived and traded with me, and is sufficiently instructed of the state of the country and people there. And I should very gladly, according to his desire, have waited upon you into <HI>Hampshire,</HI> to have informed your honor, in person, had I not, next week, been passing to <HI>Virginia.</HI> But nevertheless, to satisfy you of the truth, I thought good to write unto you my knowledge, and first, to describe to you, from the north side of <HI>Delaware,</HI> unto <HI>Hudson's</HI> river, in sir <HI>Edmund's</HI> patent, called <HI>New-Albion;</HI> which lyeth just between <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> and that <HI>ocean-sea;</HI> I take it to be about one hundred and sixty miles; I find some broken land, isles and inlets, and many small isles at <HI>Egg-bay.</HI> But, going to <HI>Delaware-bay,</HI> by cape <HI>May;</HI> which is twenty-four miles, at most, and is, as I understand, very well set out, and printed in captain <HI>Powell's</HI> map of <HI>New-England,</HI> done, as is told me, by a draught I gave to <HI>M. Daniel,</HI> the plot maker; which, sir <HI>Edmund</HI> saith, you have at home;—on that north side, about five miles within, a port, or road, for any ships, called the <HI>Nook;</HI> and within lyeth the king of <HI>Kechemeches,</HI> having, as I suppose, about fifty men; and twelve leagues higher, a little above the bay and bar, is the river of <HI>Manteses,</HI> which hath twenty miles on <HI>Charles's</HI> river, and thirty miles running up a fair navigable, deep river, all a flat level of rich and fat black marsh mould; which I think to be three hundred thousand acres. In this sir <HI>Ed∣mund</HI> intends, as he saith, to settle; and there the king of <HI>Manteses</HI> hath about one hundred bowmen. Next above, about six leagues higher, is a fair deep river, twelve miles navigable; where is <HI>Free-stone,</HI> and there, over against it, is the king of <HI>Sikonesses;</HI> and next is <HI>Asomoches</HI> river and king, with an hundred men; and next is <HI>Eriwoneck,</HI> a king of forty men; where we sat down; and five miles above is the king of <HI>Ramcock,</HI> with one hundred men; and four miles higher the king of <HI>Axion,</HI> with two-hundred men; and next to him, ten leagues over land, an inland king <HI>Calcefar,</HI> with one hundred and fifty men; and then there is, in the mid∣dle of <HI>Charle's</HI> river, two fair woody islands, very pleasant and fit for parks, one of one thousand acres, the other of one thousand four hundred, or thereabouts; and six leagues higher, near a creek, called <HI>Mosilian,</HI> the king having two hundred men; and then we come to the <HI>Falls,</HI> made by a rock of limestone; as I suppose, it is about sixty-five leagues from the sea:—near to which is an isle, fit for a city; all materials there to build; and above, the river fair and navigable, as the <HI>Indians</HI> inform me; for I went but ten miles higher. I do account all the <HI>Indians</HI> to be about eight hundred; and are in several factions and war against the <HI>Susquaban∣nocks;</HI> and are all extreme fearful of a gun, naked and unarmed against our shot, swords and pikes. I had some bickering with some of them; and they are of so little esteem, as I durst, with fifteen men, sit down, or trade in despight of them; and since my return eighteen <HI>Swedes</HI> are set∣tled there; and so sometimes sixteen <HI>Dutchmen</HI> do, in a boat, trade with∣out fear of them.</P>
<P>I saw there an infinite quantity of bustards, swans, geese and fowl, covering the shores; as within, the like multitude of pidgeons, and store of turkies; of which I tried one to weigh forty-six pounds. There is much variety and plenty of delicate fresh sea fish, and shell fish, and whales or grampus; elks, deer that bring three young at a time, and the woods bestrewed many months with chesnuts, walnuts and mast of se∣veral sorts, to seed them and hogs, that would increase exceedingly. There the barren grounds have four kinds of grapes, and many mulber∣ries, with ash, elms, and the tallest and greatest pines and pitch trees, that I have seen. There are cedars, cypress and sassafras, with wild fruits, pears, wild-cherries, pine-apples, and the dainty <HI>Parsemenas;</HI> and there is no question but <HI>Almonds,</HI> and other fruits of <HI>Spain,</HI> will prosper, as in <HI>Virginia.</HI> And (which is a good comfort) in four and twenty hours, you may send, or go by sea, to <HI>New-England,</HI> or <HI>Virginia,</HI> with a fair wind; you may have cattle, and from the <HI>Indians</HI> two thousand bushels of corn, at twelve pence a bushel, in truck; so as victuals are there cheaper and better than to be transported; neither do I conceive any great need of a fort, or charge, where there is no enemy.</P>
<P>If my lord <HI>Palatine</HI> will bring with him three hundred men, or more, there is no doubt, but he may do very well, and grow rich; for it is a most pure healthful air, and such pure wholesome springs, rivers and waters, as are delightful of a desert, as can be seen; with so many va∣rieties of several flowers, trees and forests, for swine; so many fair risings and prospects, all green and verdant: and <HI>Maryland,</HI> a good friend and neighbour, in four and twenty hours, ready to comfort and supply.</P>
<P>And truly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> believe, my lord of <HI>Baltimore</HI> will be glad of my lord <HI>Palatine's</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on and assistance, against any enemy, or bad neigh∣bour: and if my lord <HI>Palatine</HI> employ some men to sow slax, hemp and rapes in these rich marshes, or build ships, and make pipe staves, and load some ships with these wares, or fish, from the northward, he may have any money, ware, or company, brought him, by his own ships, or the ships of <HI>Virginia,</HI> or <HI>New-England,</HI> all the year.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transac∣tions on De∣laware re∣specting the Indians, &amp;c.</NOTE>This appears to have been the consequence of <HI>drunkenness;</HI> by reason of the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves <HI>thereupon requesting an absolute prohibition, upon the whole river, of selling strong liquors to the Indians generally.</HI> Such were the early effects of strong liquor among this people; which ever since has been so ruinous and fatal to them; and so frequent∣ly the source of pernicious evils to the <HI>European</HI> settlers, near them. Their ignorance of the nature and effects of drunkenness, to which at first they were absolute strangers, rendered them less prepar∣ed to resist the temptation; and the extreme effects of madness, arising from intoxication, in a savage state, were consequently more unrestrained and brutish; and, when enraged, more shocking and barbarous than among civilized people:—never∣theless, this request of an absolute prohibition of the sale of strong liquors among them, shews their sense of the introduction of the temptation, their weakness to resist it, and the best means, with them, to avoid the pernicious consequences of it; which
<PB N="127" REF="032729_0127_0FF4EFB449BA6AE0"/>
request, afterwards was, from time to time, fre∣quently and earnestly repeated by the different na∣tions, in these parts, before they were much cor∣rupted by this, and other <HI>European</HI> vices.</P>
<P>Human nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1668.</NOTE> when destitute of a good edu∣cation, and those benefits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Indians are so prone to drunken∣ness, &amp;c.</NOTE> which arise from a wise and early institution in the best knowledge and customs, being the more prone to imbibe and in∣dulge low, immediate and sensual gratifications, than when it is aided by these excellent advantages; which teach to aspire after and pursue the more exalted and arduous paths of virtue and self-denial; views, which, as well as the present, also respect a future more high and lasting felicity, so far above the untutored ideas of savages, is a consideration, that may, in part, account for the greater depra∣vity of the <HI>Indians,</HI> respecting this vice of drunken∣ness, than is to be found among other people.</P>
<P>These <HI>Indians,</HI> along the <HI>Delaware,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Since the Europeans came among them.</NOTE> and the ad∣jacent parts of <HI>New-Jersey</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> so far as appears by the best accounts of the early settlement of these provinces, when clear of the effects of the pernicious poison of strong liquor, and before they had much imbibed, and to their own natural depravity added, such <HI>European</HI> vices as before they were strangers to, were naturally, and in general, an inoffensive, faithful and hospi∣table people.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Lovelace</HI> writ to <HI>Carr,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Lovelace gives direc∣tions to Carr, &amp;c.</NOTE> respecting this affair; giving him directions how to proceed in the government both of <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> to consult with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to send the state of the affair to the council at <HI>New-York.</HI> But it appears to have been afterwards neglected till the year 1671, when <HI>William Tomm</HI> and <HI>Peter Alricks</HI> ar∣rived at <HI>New-York</HI> from <HI>Delaware,</HI> with the parti∣culars of the affair; declaring that if special care was not taken, and effectual means used, the worst consequences would ensue.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able act of Justice among the Indians.</NOTE>But the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves were determined, if possible, to bring the murderers to justice; and and accordingly one of them <HI>Tashiowycan,</HI> the chief offender, was shot to death, in the night by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who brought his body to <HI>Wicocoa;</HI> which was afterwards hung in chains at <HI>New-Castle;</HI> the other principal person, concerned in the murder, hearing the report of the gun, ran into the woods, and made his escape, not being heard of afterwards.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians,</HI> on this affair, summoned many of their young men together, and, in the presence of the <HI>English,</HI> told them, that all should in like man∣ner be treated, who should be found in the like practice:—This, at a time, when the <HI>Indians</HI> were numerous and strong, and the <HI>Europeans</HI> few and weak, was a memorable act of justice, and a proof of true friendship to the <HI>English,</HI> greatly alleviating the fear, for which they had so much reason among savages, in this then wilderness country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other dis∣turbances on Dela∣ware, &amp;c.</NOTE>Beside this, there was another disturbance, about the same time; a <HI>Swede,</HI> at <HI>Delaware,</HI> who gave out that he was the son of <HI>Conningsmarke,</HI> the Swedish general, attempted to make an insurrec∣tion, in order to throw off the <HI>English</HI> allegiance.

not appear what became of him. <HI>Conningsmarke,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Long Fin,</HI> was condemned to die; but, in consideration that his death would involve many other deluded people in deep suffer∣ing, his punishment was mitigated to a <HI>whipping,</HI> and branding with the letter <HI>R.</HI> for <HI>Rebellion,</HI> and to be sent abroad. He was accordingly brought fettered from <HI>Delaware,</HI> and kept prisoner in the <HI>Stadt-house,</HI> at <HI>New-York,</HI> for one year, and then transported to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> for sale. It was further ordered, that the chief of his accomplices should forfeit to the King one half of their goods and chat∣tels; and a smaller mulct to be laid on the rest; to be left at the discretion of Commissioners, ap∣pointed to examine the matter.</P>
<P>At this time there is likewise an account of an <HI>Indian</HI> rape, committed on a <HI>Christian</HI> woman. The <HI>Indian</HI> was taken and condemned to death by by the Commissioners at <HI>Delaware;</HI> but he broke jail.—And one <HI>Douglas</HI> at <HI>Hoarkill,</HI> after this, for making a disturbance among the new settlers, by seditious practices, was secured in jail, and after∣wards sent to <HI>New-York,</HI> where he had his trial; and was sent to the eastward, and ordered not to return.</P>
<P>Near the beginning of the year 1669,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1669.</NOTE> a com∣mission and letters of instruction were sent from <HI>New-York,</HI> to the <HI>Hoarkill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further proceed∣ings on De∣laware, &amp;c.</NOTE> authorizing <HI>Hermannus Frederickson</HI> to be <HI>Schout, Slander Matson, Otto Walgast,</HI> and <HI>William Cleason,</HI> to be Commissioners: who were to keep good order there; and to try all matters of difference, under ten pounds, among themselves:—Which seems to have been intended to save them the trouble of going to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> upon every trifling occasion; but for all matters above ten pounds they were to apply themselves to <HI>New-York;</HI> and so for all criminals.

Stand well upon your guard, and do not begin with them; but, if they first break the peace, by firing upon your guards, or any such hostile action, then use all possible means to defend yourselves and the place; and command all his Majesty's good subjects to be aiding and assisting to you; who, I hope, will not be wanting to their abilities. In all matters of concern, you are to take advice of the chief officers there.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear friends and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In the pure love and precious fellowship of our Lord Jesus Christ we very dearly salute you;—Forasmuch as there was a paper printed se∣veral months ago, entitled, <HI>"The description of New-West-Jersey,</HI> in which our names were mentioned, as Trustees for one undivided moiety of the said province, and because it is alledged, that some, partly on this ac∣count, and others apprehending that the paper, by the manner of its expression, came from the body of Friends, as a religious society of people, and not from particulars, have, through these mistakes, weakly concluded, that the said description, in matter and form, might be writ, printed and recommended on purpose to prompt and allure people to dis-settle and transplant themselves, as its also by some alledged; and because we are informed that several have, on that account, taken encouragement and resolution to transplant themselves and families to that province; and left any of them (as is feared by some) should go out of a curious and unsettled mind; and others to shun the testimony of the blessed <HI>Cross</HI> of <HI>Jesus;</HI> of which several weighty friends have a godly jealousy upon their spirits, left an unwarrantable forwardness should act or hurry, any be∣side, or beyond, the wisdom and counsel of the Lord, or the freedom of his light and spirit, in their own hearts, and not upon good and weighty grounds; it truly laid upon us to let Friends know how the matter stands; which we shall endeavour to do with all clearness and fidelity.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is such a place as <HI>New-Jersey</HI> is certain.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is reputed of those, who have lived and travelled in that country to be wholesome of air, and fruitful of soil, and capable of sea trade, is also certain; and it is not right, in any, to despise it, or disswade those, that find freedom from the <HI>Lord,</HI> and necessity put upon them, on going.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Duke of <HI>York</HI> sold it to those called Lord <HI>Berkeley,</HI> Ba∣ron of <HI>Stratton,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Carteret;</HI> equally to be divided between them, is also certain.</P>
<P N="4">4. One moiety, or half part, of the said province, being the right of the Lord <HI>Berkeley,</HI> was sold by him to <HI>John Fenwicke,</HI> in trust for <HI>Edward Byllinge,</HI> and his assigns.</P>
<P N="5">5. Forasmuch as <HI>Edward Billinge</HI> (after <HI>William Penn</HI> had ended the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erence between <HI>E. Byllinge</HI> and <HI>J. Fenwicke</HI>) was willing to present his interest, in the said province, to his creditors, as all that he had left him, towards their satisfaction, he desired <HI>W. Penn</HI> (though every way unconcerned) and <HI>Gawen Lawrie</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Lucas,</HI> two of his credi∣tors, to be trustees, for performance of the same; and because several of his creditors, particularly and very importunately pressed <HI>W. Penn</HI> to accept of the trust, for their sakes and security, we did, all of us, comply with these, and the like requests, and accepted of the trust.</P>
<P N="6">6. Upon this we became trustees for one moiety of the said province, yet undivided; and after do little labour, trouble and cost, a division was obtained between the said Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> and us, as trustees: the country is situated and bounded, as is expressed in the printed description.</P>
<P N="7">7. This now divided moiety is to be cast into one hundred parts, lots or proprieties; ten of which, upon the agreement, made betwixt <HI>E. Billinge</HI> and <HI>J. Fenwicke,</HI> his executors and assigns, with a consider∣able sum of money by way of satisfaction, for what he became concerned in the purchase from the said Lord <HI>Berkeley,</HI> and by him afterwards con∣veyed to <HI>John Edridge</HI> and <HI>Edmond Warner,</HI> their heirs and assigns.</P>
<P N="8">8. The ninety parts remaining are exposed to sale; on behalf of the creditors of the said <HI>Edward Byllinge.</HI> And forasmuch several friends are concerned as creditors, as well as others, and the disposal of so great a part of this country being in our hands; we did in real tenderness and regard to friends, and especially to the poor and necessitous, make friends the first offer; that if any of them, though particularly those, who being low in the world, and under trials about a comfortable livelihood for themselves and families, should be desirous of dealing for any part or parcel thereof, that they might have the refusal.</P>
<P N="9">9. This was the real and honest intent of our hearts, and not to prompt, or allure any out of their places, either by the credit our names might have with our people throughout the nation, or by representing the thing otherwise than it is in itself.</P>
<P>As to the printed paper, some time since set forth by the creditors, as a description of that province, we say, as to two passages in it, they are not so clearly and safely worded as ought to have been; particularly in seeming to hint, the <HI>Winter</HI> season to be so short a time; when, on fur∣ther information, we hear it is sometimes longer, and sometimes shorter, than therein expressed; and the last clause, relating to liberty of conscience, we would not have any to think, that it is promised or intended, to main∣tain the liberty of the exercise of religion by force of arms; though we shall never consent to any the least violence on conscience; yet it was never designed to encourage any to expect by force of arms, to have liberty of conscience fenced against invaders thereof.</P>
<P>And be it known unto you all, in the name and fear of Almighty God, his Glory and Honor, Power and Wisdom, Truth and Kingdom, is dearer to us, than all visible things; and as our eye has been single, and our hearts sincere, in the living God, in this, as in other things, so we desire all, whom it may concern, that all groundless jealousies may be judged down, and watched against; and that all extremes may be avoided, on all hands, by the power of the Lord; that nothing which hurts or grieves the holy life of truth in any that goes or stays, may be adhered to, nor any provocation given to break precious unity.</P>
<P>This am I, <HI>William Penn,</HI> moved of the Lord to write unto you, left any bring a temptation upon themselves, or others; and, in offend∣ing the Lord, slay their own Peace. Blessed are they that can see and behold him their Leader, their Orderer, their Conductor and Preserver in staying and going; whose is the earth and the fulness thereof, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. And, as we formerly writ, we cannot but repeat our request unto you, that, in whomsoever a desire is to be con∣cerned in this intended plantation, such would weigh the thing before the Lord, and not headily, or rashly, conclude on any such remove; and that they do not offer violence to the tender love of their near kindred and relations, but soberly and conscientiously endeavour to obtain their <HI>good wills;</HI> the unity of friends, where they live; that, whether they go, or stay, it may be of good favour before the Lord, and good people; from whom only can all heavenly and earthly blessings come;—This we thought good to write, for the preventing all misunderstandings, and to declare the real truth of the matter; and so we recommend you all to the Lord, who is the watchman of his Israel. We are your real friends and bre∣thren.</P>

<P>Extract from John Crips's letter, dated, <HI>Burlington,</HI> on <HI>Delaware,</HI> 26th. 8th. month, 1677, to his friend Henry Stacy, in England.</P>
<P>"Here is a town (Burlington) laid out for twenty proprieties, and a straight line, drawn from the river side (Delaware) up the land, which is to be the main street, and a market place about the middle. The <HI>York∣shire</HI> ten proprietors are to build on one side, and the <HI>London</HI> ten, on the other side; and they have ordered one street to be made along the river side; which is not divided with the rest, but in small lots by itself, and every one that hath any part in a propriety, is to have his share in it. The town lots for every propriety will be about ten or eleven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which is only for a house, orchard and gardens, &amp;c."</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Budd,</HI> who owned a share of propriety in <HI>West Jersey,</HI> being ancestor to a large family there; and who arrived at <HI>Burlington</HI> in 1678, in a Pamphlet, describing the country about nine or ten years afterwards, says,</P>
<P>"The <HI>Indians</HI> told us, in a conference at <HI>Burlington,</HI> shortly after we came into the country, they were advised to make war on us, and cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off, while we were but few; for that we sold them the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> with the Match coat they had bought of us:—Which caused our peo∣ple to be in fears and jealousies concerning them: therefore we sent for the <HI>Indian Kings,</HI> to speak with them, who with many more <HI>Indians,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>Burlington,</HI> where we had a conference with them, about the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tter. We told them, we came amongst them by their own consent, and had bought the land of them; for which we had honestly paid, as well as for all the commodities which we had, at any time bought of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; that we had been just, kind, and respectful to them, from the time of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first coming; and therefore, know no reason that they had to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on us. To which one of them in, behalf of the rest, made the fol∣lowing speech in answer."</P>
<P>"Our young men may speak such words as we do not like, nor ap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e of; and we cannot help it. And some of your young men may speak such words as you do not like; and you cannot help that:— We are your brothers, and intend to live like brothers with you; we have no mind to have war, for when we have war, we are only skin and bones, the meat that we eat does us no good; we always are in fear, we have not the benefit of the sun to shine on us; we hide us in holes and corners; we are minded to live in peace. If we intend, at any time, to make war upon you, we will let you know of it, and the reasons why we make war with you; and if you make us satisfaction for the injury done us, for which the war was intended, then we will not make war on you; and if you intend at any time, to make war on us, we would have you let us know of it, and the reason; and if we do not make satisfaction for the injury done unto you, then you may make war on us; otherwise you ought not to do it: you are our brothers, and we are wil∣ling to live like brothers with you; we are willing to have a bread path, for you and us to walk in; and if an <HI>Indian</HI> is asleep in this path, the <HI>Englishman</HI> shall pass by and do him no harm. And if an <HI>Englishman</HI> be asleep in this path, the <HI>Indian</HI> shall pass by him and say "he is an <HI>English∣man;</HI> he is asleep, let him alone, he loves sleep." It shall be a <HI>plain path;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here must not be in this path <HI>stump,</HI> to hurt our feet. And as to the <HI>small-pox,</HI> it was once in my grandfather's time; and it could not be the <HI>English,</HI> that could send it to us then; there being no <HI>English,</HI> in the country; and it was once in my father's time, they could not send it us then neither; and now it is in my time; I do not believe they have sent it to us now; I do believe it is the <HI>Man</HI> above that hath sent it us."</P>
<P>"Some are apt to ask, how we can propose safely to live among such a <HI>Harthen</HI> people, as the <HI>Indians,</HI> whose principles and practices lead them to war and bloodshed; and ours on the contrary, to love enemies? I an∣swer, that we settled by the <HI>Indians</HI> consent and goodliking, and bought the land of them, that we settle on; which they conveyed to us by deeds, under their hands and seals; and also submitted to several articles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> agreement with us, <HI>viz. not to do us any injury;</HI> but if it should so happe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that any of their people, any time, should injure, or do harm to any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us, then they were to make us satisfaction, for the injury done. There∣fore if they break these covenants and agreements, then, in consequently thereof, they may be proceeded against, as other offenders, <HI>viz.</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in subjection to the Magistrate's power; into whose hands the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>justice</HI> is committed to be used by him, <HI>for the punishment of evil-doers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the praise of them that do well:</HI> therefore I do believe it to be both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦ful and expedient to bring offenders to justice, by the power of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣gistrate's sword; which is not to be used in vain;—but may be used aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> such as raise <HI>rebellions</HI> and <HI>insurrections</HI> against the government of the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦try, be they <HI>Christians</HI> or <HI>Indians,</HI> (now that these have so far agreed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the laws of civil government) otherwise it is in vain for us to prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to magistracy, or government; it being that, which we own to be lawful both in principle and practice.</P>
<P>—"The <HI>Indians</HI> have been very serviceable to us, by selling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> venison, <HI>Indian</HI> corn, peas and beans, fish and fowl:"—"The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣men plant the corn and carry burdens. There are many of them of a good understanding considering their education;—and in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meetings of business, they have excellent order; one speaking after ano¦ther; and while one is speaking all the rest keep silent, and do not so much as whisper one to the other.</P>
<P>"We had several meetings with them; one was in order to put down the sale of rum, brandy and other strong liquors, to them; they being a people, that have not government of themselves, so as to drink in mode∣ration. At which time there were eight Kings, (one of them was <HI>Oka∣nickon,</HI> a noted friend to the <HI>English</HI>) and many other <HI>Indians.</HI> The Kings sat on a form, and we on another, over against them. They had prepa∣red four belts of <HI>Wampum</HI> (so their current money is called, being black and white beads, made of a fish shell) to give us as seals of the cove∣nant, they made with us. One of the Kings by the consent and appoint∣ment of the rest stood up, and made this following speech:</P>
<P>—"The strong liquor was first sold us by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and they are blind; they had no eyes, they did not see that it was for our hurt. The next people that came among us, were the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who continued the sale of these strong liquors to us; they were also blind; they had no eyes, they did not see it to be hurtful to us to drink it; although we know it to be hurtful to us; but if people will sell it to us, we are so in love with it, that we cannot forbear it. When we drink it, it makes us mad; we do not know what to do: we then abuse one another; we throw each other into the fire. Seven score of our people have been killed by reason of the drinking it, since the time it was first sold us. Those people that sell it are blind; they have no eyes:—But now there is a people come to live amongst us, that have eyes; they see it to be for our hurt, and we know it to be for our hurt; they are willing to deny themselves the pro∣fit of it, for our good: Those people have eyes; we are glad such a peo∣ple are come among us: we must put it down by mutual consent; the cask must be sealed up: it must be made fast; it must not leak by day nor by night, in light nor in the dark; and we give you these four belts of <HI>Wampum;</HI> which we would have you lay up safe, and keep by you, to be witnesses of this agreement, that we make with you; and we would have you tell your children, that these four belts of <HI>Wampum</HI> are given you, to be witnesses betwixt us and you, of this agreement."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS may give you an account of mine, and my family's safe ar∣rival in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> with all the rest that came with us.—I might say something concerning our passage at sea, but I wave it, for want of time; and, in fine, may observe, all was well; for which I bless God; and the Lord keep us all sensible of it, with the rest of his mercies, for ever.</P>
<P>Dear Friends, about six weeks since we arrived in <HI>Delaware</HI> river, where I expected to have met with a combat, in the denial of <HI>Customs.</HI> In our passage, at sea, I had communicated to all that had any conside∣rable cargo on board, the opinion of Council, concerning the illegal demand thereof, with what else I thought might be for their information; which thus far prevailed, that most, if not all, concerned, seemed re∣solved to deny the paying of custom here; having paid all the King's duties in <HI>England.</HI> In good time we came to anchor, in <HI>Delaware;</HI> where one <HI>Peter Alricks</HI> (collector of the customs) came aboard, and brought a handsome present to our Commander, and sent for me into the <HI>Round-house,</HI> where they both were; and Peter told me, he had nothing to say to us, relating to <HI>customs;</HI> he had no commission for it; nor did he know of any body that had; so we had all our goods safely landed after this unexpected easy manner.</P>
<P>In pursuance of the trust committed to me after my arrival, I ac∣quainted those nominated in the commission with me, of it; but in a short time after I received your letters, giving me an account of a new grant obtained, wherein the customs are taken off; a free port confirmed, and the government settled on <HI>Edward Byllinge;</HI> which I doubt not will be very acceptable to every honest man. But, as yet I have not had time to let the people, in general, know it: and now seeing the ports are made legally free, and the government settled, I would not have any thing to remain as a discouragement to planters; here are several good and convenient settlements already, and here is land enough, and good enough, for many more.</P>

I have travelled through most of the places that are settled, and some that are not; and in every place I find the country very apt to answer the expectation of the diligent. I have seen orchards laden with fruit to admiration, their very limbs torn to pieces with the weight, and most delicious to the taste, and lovely to behold. I have seen an apple-tree, from a pippin-kernel, yield a barrel of curious cyder; and peaches in such plenty, that some people took their carts a peach-gathering; I could not but smile at the conceit of it; they are very delicate fruit, and hang almost like our oni∣ons, that are tied on ropes. I have seen and known, this summer, forty bushels of bold wheat of one bushel sown; and many more such instances I could bring, which would be too tedious here to mention. We have, from the time called May until Michaelmas, great store of very good wild fruits; as, strawberries, cranberries and hurtle-berries, which are like our bilberries in <HI>England,</HI> but far sweeter; they are very wholesome fruits. The cranberries, much like cherries, for color and bigness; which may be kept till fruit come again; an excellent sauce is made of them for ve∣nison, turkeys, and other great fowl; and they are better to make tarts than either goosberries or cherries; we have them brought to our houses by the <HI>Indians,</HI> in great plenty. My brother Robert had as many cherries, this year, as would have loaded several carts. It is my judgment, by what I have observed, that fruit trees, in this country, destroy themselves by the very weight of their fruit.</P>
<P>As for venison and fowls, we have great plenty; we have brought home to our houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plenty in New-Jer∣sey, in 1680.</NOTE> by the <HI>Indians,</HI> seven or eight fat bucks in a day; and sometimes put by as many, having no occasion for them, and fish, in their season very plenteous. my cousin <HI>Revell</HI> and I, with some of my men, went last third month into the river to catch her∣rings;
<PB N="154" REF="032729_0154_0FF4EF825A9F2B98"/>
for, at that time, they came in great sholes into the shallows; we had neither rod nor net; but, after the <HI>Indian</HI> fashion, made a round pin∣fold, about two yards over, and a foot high, but left a gap for the fish to go in at, and made a bush to lay in the gap, to keep the fish in; and when that was done, we took two long birches, and tied their tops together, and went about a stones-cast above our said pinfold; then hawling these birch boughs down the stream, where we drove thousands before us; but so many got into our trap as it would hold; and then we began to hawl them on shore, as fast as three or four of us could, by two or three at a time; and, after this manner, in half an hour, we could have filled a three bushel sack of as good large herrings as ever I saw. And as to beef and pork, here is great plenty of it, and cheap; and also good sheep. The common grass of this country feeds beef very fat. I have killed two this year; and there∣fore I have reason to know it: besides, I have seen, this fall, in <HI>Burlington,</HI> killed eight or nine fat oxen and cows on a market day, and all very fat. And though I speak of herrings only, left any should think we have little other sorts, we have great plenty of most sorts of fish, that ever I saw in <HI>England:</HI> besides several other sorts that are not known there; as, rocks, cat-fish, shads, sheeps-heads, sturgeons; and fowls plenty; as, ducks, geese, tur∣keys, pheasants, partridges; and many other sorts, that I cannot remember, and would be too tedi∣ous to mention.</P>
<P>Indeed the country, take it as a wilderness, is a brave country, though no place will please all. But some will be ready to say,—He writes of con∣veniences, but not of inconveniences.—In answer to these, I honestly declare there is some barren land, as, I suppose, there is in most places of the world; and more wood than some would have up∣on their lands; neither will the country produce
<PB N="155" REF="032729_0155_0FF4EFEBEBB3ED60"/>
corn without labour, nor cattle be got without something to buy them, nor bread with idleness; else it would be a brave country indeed; and I ques∣tion not, but all then would give it a good word; For my part, I like it so well, I never had the least thought of returning to <HI>England,</HI> except on account of trade.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>William Penn's chief design in the colonization of Penn∣sylvania—cause and manner of obtaining the grant:—King Charles the second's royal charter to William Penn.—Boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania, with the real extent and content of the latter.—The King's declaration.—Account of the province, terms of sale for land, and conditions of settlement published, with advice to the adventurers. —Free society of traders, &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been mentioned, in the preceding intro∣duction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1676.</NOTE> in what manner <HI>William Penn</HI> became concerned in the province of <HI>West-New-Jersey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's time spent in benefit∣ing man∣kind.</NOTE> and a principal promoter of its colonization, in, or about, the year 1676. After which time, as before, it appears, in the annals of his life, that he was continually, and various ways, employed, in promoting the happiness of mankind, both in
<PB N="168" REF="032729_0168_0FF4F0076AD80868"/>
their religious and civil capacity; insomuch that his name is revered in a double respect, and ren∣dered dear to posterity. The fruits of his labours have placed his conduct above the power of envy and detraction; which would pervert every good and laudable design to the vilest purposes, and represent the most generous actions, as arising from sordid and sinister views: evils, which always indicate their opposite virtues and true merit, and have their residence in base and low minds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His views in the colo∣nization of Pennsylva∣nia.</NOTE>The views of <HI>William Penn,</HI> in the colonization of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> were most manifest, the best and most exalted, that could occupy the human mind;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Governor <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> in his history of <HI>Massachuset's-bay,</HI> says, "Our ancestors valued themselves upon being a colony for <HI>religion. Penn</HI> had no other motive to found his colony, than <HI>human policy."</HI></P><P>First, By <HI>religion</HI> here, it seems not unreasonable to suppose, the author meant, that partial advancement of a particular sect, or of the profes∣sors of one particular form of religion only, both in civil and ecclesiasti∣cal power and advantages, to the exclusion of all others; which appears, by his history, to have been the real case, in that colony:—and that, by <HI>human policy only,</HI> is to be understood, in this place, the conferring of no exclusive favour, nor partial advantages, on the votaries of any one particular form of religion alone, according to the political state or con∣stitution of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> established by <HI>William Penn;</HI>—for as menti∣oned in the beginning, it is most certain, that <HI>William Penn,</HI> both in a religious and civil respect,—"As an universal father, opened his arms to all mankind, without distinction of sect, or party. In his republic, it was not the religious creed, but personal merit, that entitled every mem∣ber of society to the protection and emolument of the state."</P><P>It is not my business here to compare this kind of <HI>religion,</HI> with what is here called <HI>human policy alone,</HI> nor to shew how far the latter excels, or transcends, the unreasonable limitation of the former, both in a re∣ligious and political sense, notwithstanding the names here given them; because the perversion, or misapplication of names and words is easy and common;—but to call the best religion, <HI>human policy only,</HI> cannot alter the nature of it, though it may sometimes have an effect on igno∣rant and inconsiderate minds, &amp;c.</P><P>Second, Besides, I think I have known some others, so differently minded in their conceptions of things, and so strongly swayed by the opinion, though under pretence of religion, or from declared religious views, as to endeavour to make men believe, <HI>"That true Christians ought not to be concerned, as agents, in the affairs of civil government at all:"</HI>— because, say they, <HI>"Christ's kingdom is not of this world,"</HI> &amp;c. I shall not meddle here with such opinions further than, in this history to oppose the invariable sentiments, and uniform conduct of <HI>William Penn</HI> to the extravagancy of all such notions.</P><P>When preparing for his settlement and government of <HI>Pennsylvania William Penn,</HI> in divers of his letters and writings, on the occasion, &amp;c. besides what is published, of that nature, in his printed works, expressed his <HI>religious sense and views,</HI> in a manner sufficiently clear, on this affair; of which the following short extracts may serve, as a specimen, <HI>viz.</HI></P><P>First, To his friends, in a more general capacity:—</P><P>"And now give me leave to say, I have served the Lord, his truth and people, in my day, to my ability, and not sought myself, though much spent my self; so has he firmly made me to believe, that I shall not, even, <HI>outwardly,</HI> go without my reward; I see his blessed hand <HI>therein,</HI> that has blessed my faith and patience, and long attendance with success. And because I have been somewhat exercised, at times, about the nature and end of government, among men, it is reasonable to expect, that I should endeavour to establish a just and righteous one, in <HI>this province; that others may take example by it;</HI>—truly this my heart desires. For the nations want a <HI>precedent:</HI> and till vice, and corrupt manners, be impartially rebuked and punished, and till virtue and sobriety be cherish∣ed, the wrath of God will hang over nations. I do, therefore, desire the Lord's wisdom to guide me, and those that may be concerned with me; that we may do the thing, that is truly wise and just," &amp;c. M.S.</P><P>Secondly, To a particular friend in <HI>England,</HI> who afterwards removed to <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> taken from his own hand writing, dated, in 1681, <HI>viz.</HI>—</P><P>"For my country, I eyed the Lord, in obtaining it; and more was I drawn inward to look to him, and to owe it to his hand and power, <HI>than to any other way; I have so obtained it, and desire to keep it;</HI> that I may not be unworthy of his love; but do that, which may answer his kind Providence, and serve his truth and people: <HI>that an example may be set up to the nations:</HI> there may be room there, though not here, for such an <HI>holy experiment."</HI> &amp;c.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="169" REF="032729_0169_0FF4F075EED48298"/>
to render men as free and happy as the nature of their existence could possibly bear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1680.</NOTE> in their civil capacity, and in their religious state, to restore to them those lost rights and privileges, with which God and nature had originally blessed the human race. This, in part, he effected; and, by those means, which Providence, in the following man∣ner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His success in this his design.</NOTE> put into his hands, he so far brought to pass, as both to excite the admiration of strangers, and to fix in posterity, that love and honor for his memory, which the length of future time will scarcely ever be able to efface.</P>
<P>It has already been observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn petitious the King in 1680.</NOTE> that the eminent public services of <HI>Admiral Penn</HI> had brought him in favor at court; to which favor his son, <HI>William Penn,</HI> succeeded, notwithstanding the singularity of the choice of his mode of life. There was a large sum of money due, from the government, to the Admiral, at the time of his death; much of
<PB N="170" REF="032729_0170_0FF4F008FA89CF30"/>
which he himself had advanced for the sea service; the rest was for arrearages in his pay. In conse∣quence of this debt, <HI>William Penn,</HI> in the summer of the year 1680, petitioned King <HI>Charles</HI> the se∣cond, that <HI>letters patent</HI> might be granted him, for a tract of land, in <HI>America,</HI> lying north of <HI>Mary∣land;</HI> on the east, bounded by <HI>Delaware</HI> river; on the west limited as <HI>Maryland;</HI> and northward to extend as far as plantable.</P>
<P>This was first laid before the <HI>Privy Council,</HI> and afterwards, the Lords of the committee of trade and plantations. After several meetings on the oc∣casion, in which the objections, from the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> by his agent, Sir <HI>John Werden,</HI> as pro∣prietor of that tract of Land, since called, the counties of <HI>New-Castle, Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> on <HI>De∣laware;</HI> and from the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> proprietor of <HI>Maryland,</HI> were fully heard and debated; the Lord Chief Justice <HI>North,</HI> and the Attorney-General, Sir <HI>William Jones,</HI> being consulted both respecting the grant itself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1681.</NOTE> and also the form, or manner, of making it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">W.

Mr. <HI>William Penn,</HI> an eminent <HI>Quaker,</HI> and a gentleman of great knowledge and true philosophy, had it granted to him, at this time;—which he designed for a retreat or <HI>asylum,</HI> for the people of his religious perswasion, then made uneasy at home, through the bigotry of spiritual courts, &amp;c. Mr. Penn, therefore, carried thither with him a large embarkation of those <HI>Quakers;</HI> afterwards, from time to time, joined by many more, from <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> At his first arrival there, he found many <HI>English</HI> families in it, and considerable numbers of <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Swedes</HI> who all readily submitted to his wise and excellent regulations; which highly merit to be known by all persons, who would apply to colonizing. The true wisdom, as well as equity, of his <HI>un∣limited toleration</HI> of all religious perswasions, as well as his kind, just and prudent treatment of the native <HI>Indians,</HI> also his laws, policy and go∣vernment, so endeared him to the planters, and so widely spread the fame of his whole oeconomy, that, although so lately planted, it is thought, at this day (about the year 1760) to have more white people in it, than any other colony, on all the continent of <HI>English America, New-England</HI> alone excepted."</P></NOTE></P>

<P>By the first section of this charter the extent and boundary of the province are expressed in such plain terms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the boundary between Maryland and Penn∣sylvania.</NOTE> that it might reasonably be supposed they could not well, or easily, be misunderstood: three degrees of latitude, included and bounded, between the beginning of the fortieth, and the be∣ginning of the forty-third degree of north latitude, equal to about two hundred and eight <HI>English</HI> sta∣tute miles, north and south, with five degrees of longitude, westward from <HI>Delaware</HI> river, which, in the parrallel of forty-one degree, are equal to
<PB N="188" REF="032729_0188_0FF4F02B7409C700"/>
nearly two hundred and sixty-five miles, east and west, are as clearly and manifestly expressed to be granted to the proprietary of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> as words can do it; and we are otherwise sufficiently certi∣fied that the same space, or quantity of land, was intended by the King to be included in the said grant; yet the dispute between the proprietaries of <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> on this point, was afterwards remarkable, and of many years conti∣nuance; occasioned by each of the respective pro∣prietaries claiming to himself the whole space, or extent, of the land, contained in the fortieth de∣gree of latitude; which was the north boundary of <HI>Maryland,</HI> by patent of that province; and which, though prior to that of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> spe∣cifies, or assigns, no particular part of the said de∣gree, for the boundary, as the <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> grant doth: which space, or degree, containing near se∣venty <HI>English</HI> miles in breadth, north and south, and in length westward, so far as <HI>Maryland</HI> ex∣tends, was no small matter to occasion a dispute.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the clearness of the terms, by which the boundary between the said pro∣vinces, is expressed in their respective charters, as above mentioned, yet this dispute was, at length, in the year 1732, finally settled chiefly in favor of <HI>Maryland;</HI> by fixing the said boundary between the two provinces, only fifteen miles due south of the most southerly part of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> or in the parallel of 39 degrees, 44 minutes nearly, instead of 39 degrees, or at the beginning of the fortieth degree, as mentioned and intended by charter; which renders the real extent of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Real ex∣tent and content of Pennsylva∣nia at pre∣sent.</NOTE> north and south, only about 155 miles, instead of 208, and makes the square miles, in the pro∣vince about 41,000, and the number of acres, 26,288,000 or near twenty-six millions.</P>

He is an in∣stance, among many others that might be given, in the early time of this country, of advancement from low beginning to rank of eminence and esteem, through industry, with a virtuous and prudent conduct.—The diffi∣culties, hardships and trials of many of the well disposed early settlers, how∣ever low in the world, rather visibly tended to their promotion, and, in some respect rendered them more useful and worthy members of so∣ciety, in this new country; while others, even possessed of handsome pa∣trimonies, at first, but more improvident, and less accustomed to encounter with such difficulties, &amp;c. more commonly went to ruin, or were reduced to indigence; besides, a dependance on such inheritances, even with otherwise prudent oeconomy, in the early time of this country, where, and when servants could scarcely be had, or kept, by any means, seve∣ral worthy persons, who had not been used to labor, found, by sorrow∣ful experience, did not answer here, as in <HI>Europe;</HI> so that for a series of years, those who came hither more wealthy, and had before been used to a different manner of life, sometimes lost much of what they had possessed, and were reduced to greater straits and trials, than the more poor and laborious part of the settlers, who were generally more numer∣ous, and got estates;—Hence it became noted for being a good poor man's country, &amp;c.</P><P>This <HI>Joseph Kirkbride,</HI> above mentioned, was afterwards a preacher, among the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and, for many years in the magistracy, and fre∣quently in the Assembly. He is said to have been an exemplary and zealous promoter of the religion of his profession; and a very serviceable person in divers respects and capacities.

<P><PB N="194" REF="032729_0194_0FF4F04036A2A9F0"/>In one of these ships sailed <HI>William Markham,</HI> a relation of the proprietary; whom he had ap∣pointed his Deputy Governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commis∣sioners sent, &amp;c.</NOTE> and joined with him certain commissioners, to confer with the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> or <HI>Aboriginies,</HI> of the country, respecting their lands; and to confirm with them a league of peace.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Import∣ance of treating the Indians well.</NOTE>To cultivate a right understanding with these na∣tives, by a kind, gentle and just treatment and usage, was an affair of great importance to the fu∣ture happiness and prosperity of the province; which good policy alone, even, from views of temporal interest, in such a case, would point out; yet notwithstanding this, the unhappy effects of a contrary conduct, or a neglect in this particular, had been frequently and long experienced, in some other provinces, to their great detriment, and ruin∣ous consequences.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">William Penn's con∣duct respec∣ting the Indians.</NOTE>But <HI>William Penn</HI> appears to have acted from higher, and more disinterested motives, in refer∣ence to these people, than from those of mere temporal advantage only; which, it is manifest, he never received from the province, in any respect whatever, during a life of near thirty-seven years continuance after this time; but lost much by it. His ideas were more exalted, than to be confined within the narrow view of a temporary interest alone, and his conduct respecting these poor, igno∣rant and savage people, declared his regard for universal justice, and the natural rights of mankind; tending to impress on their minds, as was his con∣cern for all others, a proper sense of eternal justice, and the happy effects of friendship, love and peace; than which nothing can have a stronger influence on the rational and considerate mind, to keep it within the due bounds of justice and truth.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1682.</NOTE>In the beginning of the year 1682, <HI>William Penn</HI> published his frame of government, and certain laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">William Penn pub∣lishes a frame of govern∣ment and laws.</NOTE> agreed on, in <HI>England,</HI> by himself and the purchasers under him, entitled, <HI>"The frame of the government of the province of Pennsylvania, in America; together with certain laws, agreed upon, in England, by the Governor, and divers freemen of the aforesaid province. To be further explained and confirmed there, by the first Provincial Council, that shall be held, if they see meet."</HI> Which <HI>frame,</HI> &amp;c. may be seen in the appendix, No. II.</P>
<P>In the preface to this <HI>frame</HI> is exhibited a sketch of the author's sentiments on the nature of go∣vernment, in general, his reflections on the diffe∣rent modes of it, and his inducement for forming his. It may serve to give some idea of the judg∣ment of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in general, on this subject,
<PB N="197" REF="032729_0197_0FF4F0ADA02AD148"/>
respecting which they have frequently been misre∣presented; I shall, therefore, here give the follow∣ing extract from it.—The author, after having quoted several parts of the sacred scriptures, rela∣tive to government, proceeds, in the following words:</P>
<P>—"This settles the divine right of government beyond exception,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of the preface to his frame of Govern∣ment.</NOTE> and that for two ends; first, to terrify evil doers; secondly, to cherish those, that do well; which gives government a life be∣yond corruption; and makes it as durable, in the world, as good men shall be. So that go∣vernment seems to me a part of religion itself; a thing sacred, in its institution and end. For, if it does not directly remove the cause, it crushes the effects of evil; and is, as such, a lower, yet an <HI>emanation of the same divine power,</HI> that is both author and object of pure religion; the dif∣ference lying here; that the one is more free and mental, the other more corporal and compulsive, in its operation: but that is only to evil-doers; govern∣ment itself being otherwise as capable of kindness, goodness and charity, as a more private society.</P>
<P>"They weakly err, that think there is no other use of government, than <HI>correction;</HI> which is the coarsest part of it: daily experience tells us, that the care and regulation of many other affairs, more soft, and daily necessary, make up much the greater part of government; and which must have followed the peopling of the world, had <HI>Adam</HI> never fallen; and will continue among men, on earth, under the highest attainments, they may arrive at, by the coming of the blessed second <HI>Adam,</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> from Heaven."—</P>
<P>As to the modes, he further observes,—"I do not find a model in the world, that time, place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of modes of Govern∣ment in ge∣neral.</NOTE> and some singular emergencies, have not necessa∣rily altered; nor is it easy to frame a civil govern∣ment, that shall serve all places alike;".—"Any

government is free to the people under it (what∣ever be the frame) where the laws rule, and the people are a party to those laws; and more than this is tyranny, olygarchy, or confusion."—</P>
<P>"There is hardly one <HI>frame</HI> of government, in the world, so ill designed by its first founders, that, in good hands, would not do well enough; and history tells us, the best, in ill ones, can do nothing, that is great and good; Witness, the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> states. Governments, like clocks, go from the motion, men give them; and as governments are made and moved by men, so by them are they ruined too. Wherefore, go∣vernments rather depend upon men, than men upon governments. Let men be good, and the government cannot be bad; if it be ill, they will cure it. But, if men be bad, let government be never so good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of the preface to William Penn's frame Govern∣ment.</NOTE> they will endeavour to warp and spoil it to their turn."—"That, therefore, which makes a good government, must keep it, <HI>viz.</HI> Men of wisdom and virtue; qualities, that, be∣cause they descend not with worldy inheritances, must be carefully propagated by a <HI>virtuous educa∣tion of youth;</HI> for which after ages will owe more to the care and prudence of <HI>founders,</HI> and the suc∣cessive <HI>Magistracy,</HI> than to their parents, for their private patrimonies."</P>
<P>"These considerations," (several of which, for brevity, are here omitted) of the weight of go∣vernment, and the nice and various opinions about it, made it uneasy to me to think of publishing the ensuing <HI>frame,</HI> and <HI>conditional laws,</HI> foreseeing both the censures, they will meet with, from men of differing humours and engagements, and the occasion they may give of discourse beyond my design."</P>
<P>"But, next to the power of necessity (which is a sollicitor, that will take no denial) this induced me to a compliance, that we have, (with reve∣rence

to <HI>God,</HI> and good conscience to <HI>men</HI>) to the best of our skill, contrived and composed the <HI>frame</HI> and <HI>laws</HI> of this government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason for publishing his frame and laws.</NOTE> to the great end of government, <HI>viz. To support power in reve∣rence with the people, and to secure the people from the abuse of power;</HI> that they may be free by their just obedience, and the Magistrates honourable, for their just administration; for liberty without obedience is confusion; and obedience without li∣berty is slavery. To carry this evenness, is partly owing to the constitution, and partly to the Ma∣gistracy: where either of these fail, government will be subject to convulsions; but where both are wanting, it must be totally subverted: then, where both meet, the government is like to endure; which I humbly pray, and hope, <HI>God</HI> will please to make the lot of this of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> Amen."</P>
<P>The <HI>frame</HI> itself consisted of twenty-four arti∣cles; and the laws were forty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purport of the frame of govern∣ment.</NOTE> By the former the government was placed in the Governor and Freemen of the province, in the form of a pro∣vincial council, and General Assembly. By them conjunctively all laws were to be made, all officers appointed, and all public affairs transacted. Se∣venty-two was the number of the Council, to be chosen by the freemen; and though the Governor, or his deputy, was to be perpetual President, he had but a treble vote. One-third part of them was, at first, to be chosen for three years, one-third for two years, and one-third for one year; in such manner, that there might be an annual suc∣cession of twenty-four new members, each to conti∣nue three years, and no longer.—The General As∣sembly was, the first year, to consist of all the free∣men, afterwards of two hundred, and never to ex∣ceed five hundred. And this charter, or form of government, was not to be altered, changed, or diminished, in any part, or clause of it, without the consent of the Governor, his heirs, or assigns,
<PB N="200" REF="032729_0200_0FF4F04F7651E628"/>
and six parts of seven of the freemen, in Provin∣cial Council and Assembly. And to the same power only was the alteration of the laws made subject: these laws were of the nature of an ori∣ginal compact between the proprietary and the freemen; and, as such, were reciprocally received and executed: one of them was,</P>

<P>Though it may seem very impertinent and unnecessary to go about to repeat to you the occasions and motives, that inclined you to ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦don the land of your nativity, and those comfortable outward employ∣ments and accommodations, which most of you had there, and to adven∣ture yourselves to the hazzards of a long voyage at sea, to come to the remote part of the world; yet, lest you should forget those inducemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, as often it happens, that men, by a slothful negligence, or ignorance, after some tract of time, fall from their first love, and blindly hurty themselves into the very same mischiefs, which they intended to avoid, and build up again what they justly endeavoured to destroy, not fore∣seeing the future ill consequences of their present (supposed innocent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> actings; I shall take leave briefly to mention some few of those weight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> causes which I am confident, originally swayed your spirits to this trans∣plantation and those good ends, for the obtaining of which, you chie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly removed hither.</P>
<P>The motives of your retreating to these new habitations, I appre∣hend (measuring your sentiments by my own) to have been,</P>
<P N="1">1st. The desires of a <HI>peaceable life,</HI> where we might worship God, and obey his law, with freedom, according to the dictates of the divine principle, unincumbered with the mouldy errors of fierce invasions of tradition, politic craft, covetous, or ambitious cruelty, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That we might here, as on a <HI>virgin elysian shore,</HI> commence, or improve, such an innocent course of life, as might unload us of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se outward cares, vexations and turmoils, which before we were always sub∣ject unto, from the hands of self designing and unreasonable men.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That, as <HI>Lot,</HI> by flying to little <HI>Zoar,</HI> from the ungodly com∣pany of a more populous, magnificent dwelling, we might avoid both being grieved with the sight of infectious, as well as odious examples, of <HI>horrid swearings, cursings, drunkenness, gluttony, uncleanness,</HI> and all kinds of <HI>debauchery,</HI> continually committed with greediness; and also esea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the judgments, threatned to every land, polluted with such abomination<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P N="4">4th. That, as <HI>trees</HI> are transplanted from one soil to another, to render them more thriving, and better bearers, so we here, in peace and secure retirement, under the bountiful protection of God, and in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the least adulterated nature, might every one the better improve his talent, and bring forth more plenteous fruits, to the glory of God, and public welfare of the whole creation.</P>
<P N="5">5th. And lastly, That in order hereunto, by our holy <HI>doctrine,</HI> and the <HI>practical teachings</HI> of our exemplary, abstemious lives, transacted in all humility, sobriety, plainness, self-denial, virtue and honesty, we might gain upon those thousands of poor dark souls, scattered round about us, (and commonly, in way of contempt, and reproach, called <HI>heathens</HI>) and bring them, not only to a state of <HI>civility,</HI> but real <HI>piety;</HI> which effected, would turn to a more satisfactory account, than if, with the proud <HI>Spaniards,</HI> we had gained the mines of Potosi, and might make the ambitious heroes, whom the world admires, blush, for their petty and shameful victories, which only tend to make their follow crea∣tures <HI>slaves</HI> to those, that are already the <HI>Devil's vassals:</HI> whereas hereby we might release millions from the chains of <HI>Satan,</HI> and not only teach them their rights, as <HI>Men,</HI> and their happiness, when <HI>Christians,</HI> but being them from the power of darkness into the marvellous light, and the glorious liberty of the sons of the Most High.</P>
<P>These thoughts, these designs, my friends, were those, that brought you hither; and so far only, as you pursue and accomplish them, you obtain the end of your journey. If these be neglected, though your ports and rivers were full of <HI>trading ships,</HI> your land never so <HI>populous,</HI> and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>den with most vendible commodities, yet I would be bold to say, that your plantations were in a most <HI>unthriving condition;</HI> that like men in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, tumbling from one side of the bed to the other, you have shifted your dwelling, but not recovered your health; nor are one inch nearer your proposed happiness, in <HI>America,</HI> than in <HI>Europe;</HI> and have travelled s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me thousands of miles, to as little purpose, as the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> into <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> or foolish pilgrims, in their tedious, vain, journeys to <HI>Com∣postella, Loretto,</HI> or <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Our business, therefore, here, in this <HI>new land,</HI> is not so much to <HI>build houses,</HI> and <HI>establish factories,</HI> and promote <HI>trade</HI> and <HI>manufactories,</HI> that may enrich ourselves, (though all these things, in their due place, are not to be neglected) as to erect temples of <HI>holiness</HI> and <HI>righteousness,</HI> which <HI>God</HI> may delight in; to lay such lasting frames and foundations of <HI>tem∣perance</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> as may support the superstructures of our future hap∣piness, both in this, and the other world.</P>
<P>In order to these great and glorious ends, it will well become, nay, it is the indispensible duty of all, that are <HI>superiors</HI> amongst us, to make <HI>laws,</HI> and imitate <HI>customs,</HI> that may tend to <HI>innocency,</HI> and an <HI>harmless life;</HI> so as to avoid and prevent all oppression and violence, either to <HI>men</HI> or <HI>beasts;</HI> by which we shall strengthen the principle of <HI>well-doing,</HI> and qualify the fierce, bitter, envious, wrathful spirit; which, (as 'tis said of fire and water, in the extremes) it a good <HI>servant,</HI> but a bad master, &amp;c.</P>
<P>N. B. In the remainder of this performance, divers particulars are proposed, as fundamentals, for future laws and customs, tending princi∣pally to establish a higher degree of temperance, and original simpli∣city of manners;—more particularly against the use of <HI>spiritous liquors,</HI> than had been usual before.—Every thing of a <HI>military</HI> nature, even, the use of the instruments thereof, is not only disapproved and the distruc∣tion of the human species thereby, condemned in this <HI>speech,</HI> but like∣wise all violence, or cruelty, towards, and the <HI>wanton killing</HI> of, the infe∣rior living creatures, with the <HI>eating of animal food,</HI> are also strongly ad∣vised against, in those proposed regulations, customs, or laws, with the reasons given, &amp;c. to the end that a higher degree of love, perfection and happiness might more universally be introduced and preserved, among mankind, &amp;c.</P>

them were blessed both with the necessaries and conveniences of life beyond their expectation; and, after having lived to old age, they are said to have frequently recollected and spoke of the favours of divine Providence, in preserving there through the difficulties, with which they encoun∣tered, in their first and early settling the country: Of which the following extract from the testimony of one of them, being a <HI>Quaker,</HI> a person of an approved character, is an instance, and exhibits a specimen of this nature, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD><NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard Townsends account of his removal to <HI>Pennsyl∣vania,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>The testimony of <HI>Richard Townsend,</HI> shewing the providential hand of God, to him and others, from the first settlement of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> to this day. (About the year <HI>1727.</HI>)</HEAD>
<P>Whereas King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, in the year 1681, was pleased to grant this province to <HI>William Penn,</HI> and his heirs, for ever; which act seemed to be an act of <HI>Providence</HI> to many reli∣gious, good, people; and the Proprietor, <HI>William Penn,</HI> being one of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and in good esteem, among them and others, many were inclined to embark along with him, for the settlement of this place.</P>
<P>To that end, in the year 1682 several ships being provided, I found a concern on my mind to embark with them, with my wife and child; and about the latter end of the Sixth-month, having settled my affairs in <HI>London,</HI> where I dwelt, I went, on board the ship <HI>Welcome, Robert Greenaway,</HI> commander, in company with my worthy friend, <HI>William Penn;</HI> whose good conversation was very advantageous to all the company. His singular care was manifested, in contributing to the necessi∣ties of many, who were sick of the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> then on board; out of which company about thirty died.—After a prosperous passage of about two months, having had, in that time, many good meetings, on board, we arrived here.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="032729_0229_0FF4F16EFA0E1F20"/>At our arrival, we found it a wilderness; the chief inhabitants were <HI>Indians,</HI> and some <HI>Swedes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard Townsends account, &amp;c.</NOTE> who received us in a friendly manner: and though there was a great number of us, the good hand of <HI>Providence</HI> was seen in a particular manner; in that provisions were found for us, by the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> at very reasonable rates, as well as brought from divers other parts, that were inha∣bited before.</P>
<P>Our first concern was to keep up and main∣tain our <HI>religious worship;</HI> and, in order thereunto, we had several <HI>meetings,</HI> in the houses of the inha∣bitants; and one boarded meeting-house was set up, where the city was to be, near <HI>Delaware;</HI> and, as we had nothing but love and good-will, in our hearts, one to another, we had very comfortable meetings, from time to time; and after our meet∣ing was over, we assisted each other, in building little houses, for our shelter.</P>
<P>After some time I set up a <HI>mill,</HI> on <HI>Chester</HI> creek; which I brought ready framed from <HI>London;</HI> which served for grinding of corn, and sawing of boards; and was of great use to us. Besides, I with <HI>Joshua Tittery,</HI> made a net, and caught great quantities of fish; which supplied ourselves and many others; so that, notwithstanding it was thought near three thousand persons came in the first year, we were so providentially provided for, that we could buy a deer for about two shillings, and a large turkey, for about one shilling, and <HI>Indian</HI> corn for about two shillings and six pence per bushel.</P>
<P>And, as our worthy Proprietor treated the <HI>Indians</HI> with extraordinary humanity, they became very civil and loving to us, and brought in abun∣dance of venison. As, in other countries, the <HI>In∣dians</HI> were exasperated by hard treatment, which hath been the foundation of much bloodshed, so the contrary treatment here hath produced their love and affection.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="032729_0230_0FF4F10438FF2BD8"/>About a year after our arrival, there came in about twenty families from high and low <HI>Germany,</HI> of religious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard Townsends account, &amp;c.</NOTE> good people; who settled about six miles from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and called the place <HI>Ger∣mantown.</HI>—The country continually increasing, people began to spread themselves further back.— "Also a place called <HI>North Wales,</HI> was settled by many of the <HI>ancient Britons,</HI> an honest inclined people, although they had not then made a pro∣fession of the truth, as held by us, yet, in a little time, a large convincement was among them; and divers meeting-houses were built.</P>
<P>About the time, in which <HI>Germantown</HI> was laid out, I settled upon my tract of land, which I had purchased of the Proprietor, in <HI>England,</HI> about a mile from thence; where I set up a house and a corn mill;—which was very useful to the country, for several miles round:—But there not being plenty of horses, people generally brought their corn on their backs many miles;—I remember one man had a bull so gentle, that he used to bring his corn on him, instead of a horse.</P>
<P>Being now settled about six or seven miles from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where leaving the principal body of friends, together with the chief place of pro∣visions, as before mentioned, flesh meat was very scarce with me, for some time; of which I found the want. I remember I was once supplied by a particular instance of Providence, in the following manner:—</P>
<P>As I was in my meadow, mowing grass, a young deer came and looked on me; I continued mowing, and the deer in the same attention to me; upon which I laid down my scythe, and went to∣wards him; upon which he ran off a small distance; I went to my work again, and the Deer continued looking on me; so that several times I left my work, to go towards him; but he still kept him∣self at a distance; at last, as I was going towards
<PB N="231" REF="032729_0231_0FF4F170940E52B8"/>
him, and he, looking on me, did not mind his steps, but ran forceably against the trunk of a tree, and stunned himself so much, that he fell;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard Townsends account, &amp;c.</NOTE> upon which I ran forward, and, getting upon him, held by the legs:—After a great strug∣gle, in which I had almost tired him out, and ren∣dered him lifeless, I threw him on my shoulders, holding him fast by the legs, and, with some difficulty, from his fresh struggling, carried him home, about a quarter of a mile, to my house; where, by the assistance of a neighbour, who hap∣pened to be there, and killed him for me; he proved very serviceable to my family. I could relate several other acts of Providence, of this kind, but omit them for brevity.</P>
<P>As people began to spread, and improve their lands, the country became more fruitful; so that those, who came after us, were plentifully supplied; and with what we abounded we began a small trade abroad. And as <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in∣creased, vessels were built, and many employed. Both country and trade have been wonderfully increasing to this day; so that, from a <HI>wilderness,</HI> the Lord, by his good hand of providence, hath made it a fruitful field:—On which to look back, and observe all the steps, would exceed my pre∣sent purpose; yet, being now in the eighty-fourth year of my age, and having been in this country near forty-six years, and my memory pretty clear, concerning the rise and progress of the province, I can do no less than return praises to the <HI>Almighty,</HI> when I look back and consider his bountiful hand, not only in temporals, but in the great increase of our meetings; wherein he hath many times manifested his great loving kindness, in reaching to, and convincing many persons of the principles of truth; and those, that were already convinced and continued faithful, were not only blessed with plenty of the fruits of the earth, but also with the

<P>Beginning of the city of Philadelphia.—John Key, the first born.—Province and territory divided into counties.—First General Assembly at Philadel∣phia in <HI>1683.</HI>—Names of the members, and memo∣rials of some of them.—Proceedings of the Assem∣bly.—Second charter, or frame of government.— A seal for each county; the first Sheriffs.—First grand and petit jury, with their business, &amp;c.— Further account of the situation and plan of Phi∣ladelphia.—William Penn's letter to the free so∣ciety of traders, giving an account of Pennsylvania at that time.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the latter part of this year, 1682,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1682.</NOTE> the Propri∣etary, having finished his business with the <HI>Indians,</HI> undertook, with the assistance of his Surveyor General, <HI>Thomas Holme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A place chosen and laid out, for the city of <HI>Philadel∣phia, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> to lay out a place for the city. The ground, which was chosen for that purpose, was claimed by some <HI>Swedes;</HI> to whom he gave, in exchange for it, a larger quantity of land, at a small distance.</P>
<P>The situation of this place, being where <HI>Phila∣delphia</HI> now stands, along the western side of the river <HI>Delaware,</HI> then exhibited, on the said river, an agreeable prospect; it had a high and dry bank next the water, with a high shore, ornamented with a fine view of Pine trees, growing upon it.</P>
<P>In this bank many of the first and early adven∣turers had their caves, or holes, for their residence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First house in Philadel∣phia, &amp;c.</NOTE> before any houses were built, or better accommo∣dations prepared for them. The first house erected
<PB N="234" REF="032729_0234_0FF4F1075C120518"/>
on this plot of ground, was built by <HI>George Guest,</HI> and not finished at the time of the Proprietor's ar∣rival.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"This house was then building in <HI>Budd's row,</HI> near that called <HI>Powell's dock.</HI>—He, for many years afterwards, kept a tavern there, called the <HI>Blue anchor."</HI></P><P><HI>John Key,</HI> who was said to be the first born child of <HI>English</HI> parents, in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and that, in compliment of which <HI>William Penn</HI> gave him a lot of ground, died at <HI>Kennet,</HI> in <HI>Chester</HI> county, on the fifth of July, 1767, in the eighty-fifth year of his age; where his corps was in∣terred, in the <HI>Quakers</HI> burying ground, the next day, attended by a great concourse of people.—He was born in a cave, long afterwards known by the name of <HI>Penny-pot,</HI> near <HI>Sassafras-street.</HI>—I have seen him myself more than once, in the city; to which, about six years before his death, he walked on foot, from <HI>Kennet,</HI> about thirty miles, in one day. In the latter part of his life, he generally in the city, went under the name of <HI>first born.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P>Soon afterwards many small houses were erected. <HI>William Penn</HI> himself had a large mansion house, built on his <HI>Manor</HI> of <HI>Pennsbury,</HI> near the side of <HI>Delaware,</HI> a few miles below the <HI>falls</HI> of <HI>Trenton,</HI> and about twenty-six above the city: which appears to have been undertaken before his arrival, and intended for his reception. Here afterwards he sometimes resided, and had meetings and confe∣rences with the <HI>Indians,</HI> both on a religious and civil account.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Province and terri∣tory divi∣ded into counties, &amp;c.</NOTE>About this time also the Proprietor, with the consent of the purchasers under him, divided the province and territories, each into three counties; those of the province were called the counties of <HI>Bucks, Philadelphia,</HI> and <HI>Chester;</HI> those of the ter∣ritories, <HI>New-castle, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Sussex.</HI> For which having appointed <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> and other proper offi∣cers, in each county, he issued writs,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The following form of these writs is taken from the original, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LETTER>

<P>This was the last affair transacted at this session; which continued twenty-two days.—The Gover∣nor and Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A seal for each coun∣ty.</NOTE> among other regulations, esta∣blished a <HI>Seal,</HI> for each county, viz. for <HI>Philadel∣phia,</HI> an <HI>Anchor;</HI> for <HI>Bucks,</HI> a <HI>Tree &amp; Vine;</HI> for <HI>Chester,</HI> a <HI>Plow;</HI> for <HI>New-Castle,</HI> a <HI>Cassia;</HI> for <HI>Kent, three Ears of Indian Corn;</HI> and for <HI>Sussex,</HI> a <HI>Wheat Sheaf.</HI></P>

<P>This and all other affairs, before the Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W.

<P>This city is situated forty degrees, or more pre∣cisely 39 degrees, 56 minutes, 54 seconds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of the city &amp;c.</NOTE> north from the equator, and about seventy-five degrees, or more accurately 5 hours, 0 minutes, 35 se∣conds,

west from <HI>London,</HI> on the west side of the river <HI>Delaware;</HI> which river, at this place, is near one mile broad, at the distance of about forty leagues from the sea, along the course of the river and bay. The river <HI>Sculkil,</HI> which is a branch of the <HI>Delaware,</HI> and here runs nearly parallel to it, at the distance of two miles westward, is broad and deep enough for large ships, at this place; but, by reason of a <HI>sand-bar,</HI> at its mouth, where it enters the <HI>Delaware,</HI> about four miles below the city, its navigation, for large vessels, is obstructed: And it has <HI>falls</HI> about five miles above the city, to which the tide runs, and no further. Over which <HI>falls,</HI> or rocks, at certain times, in floods and freshes, boats and small craft pass down to the city, with country produce, as, iron, wheat, floor, &amp;c. from the interior parts of the province. The tide rises, in the <HI>Delaware,</HI> generally about six feet, at the city, and flows near thirty miles above it, to the falls at <HI>Trenton,</HI> on the <HI>Jersey</HI> shore, and is navigable all the way for large shipping, as far as that place. But the extent of this river, inclu∣ding all its curves and windings, above these <HI>falls,</HI> (much of which may easily be made navigable) is not yet precisely known.</P>
<P>The original plan of this city, as confirmed by charter, dated October 25th. 1701, extends, in length, between the river <HI>Delaware,</HI> on the east,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the plan and streets of Philadel∣phia, &amp;c.</NOTE> and <HI>Sculkil,</HI> on the west of it, about two miles; and is, in breadth, one mile nearly, on each river. The streets, which run right, and exactly parallel to each other, nearly east and west, from river to river, are nine in number, and they are intersected, at right angles, by twenty-three others, running nearly parallel with the rivers, north and south; none being less than fifty, nor more than one hundred feet broad.</P>
<P>The Proprietor likewise assigned five squares, within this plan, for the public use of the city,
<PB N="243" REF="032729_0243_0FF4F183017398E8"/>
with other beneficial regulations; whose future great importance to the city, having since not been sufficiently considered and attended to, some of them have either been neglected, or violated.</P>
<P>The largest public square, at the center, it is said, was intended to contain ten acres of land; the other four, eight acres each. In the original plan by <HI>Thomas Holme,</HI> Surveyor General, the proportions, dimensions and situations of all the original squares and streets, with the names of the latter, then given them, and still generally retain∣ed, are exhibited, as well as in the following de∣scription of it, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Similar to this description of the plan, is that of <HI>Oldmixon,</HI> in his ac∣count of the <HI>British</HI> colonies, printed in <HI>London,</HI> 1708; who affirms, he had his information from <HI>William Penn</HI> himself;—"The town was laid out, and a draught taken of it, by Mr. <HI>Thomas Holme,</HI> Surveyor Gene∣ral of the province; which lies now before me," &amp;c.</P>

In return of which I have sent you a long letter, and yet containing as brief an account of myself, and the affairs of this province, as I have been able to make.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He has enemies at home, in his absence, &amp;c.</NOTE>In the first place, I take notice of the news, you sent me; whereby I find, some persons have had so little wit, and so much malice, as to re∣port my death; and, to mend the matter, dead a <HI>Jesuit</HI> too. One might have reasonably hoped, that this distance, like death, would have been a protection against spite and envy; and, indeed, absence, being a kind of death, ought alike to se∣cure the name of the absent, as the dead; because they are equally unable, as such, to defend them∣selves: but they, that intend mischief, do not use to follow good rules to effect it. However to the great sorrow and shame of the inventors, I am still alive, and no <HI>Jesuit;</HI> and I thank God, very well. And, without injustice to the authors of this, I
<PB N="247" REF="032729_0247_0FF4D2EDC12019E8"/>
may venture to infer, that they that wilfully and falsely report, would have been glad it had been so. But I perceive many frivolous and idle stories have been invented since my departure from <HI>England:</HI> which, perhaps, at this time, are no more alive than I am dead.</P>
<P>But, if I have been unkindly used, by some I left behind me, I found love and respect enough, where I came; an universal kind welcome, every sort in their way. For, here are some of several nations, as well as divers judgments:<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is kind∣ly treated in his pro∣vince.</NOTE> nor were the natives wanting in this; for their kings, queens, and great men, both visited and presented me; to whom I made suitable returns, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For the <HI>province,</HI> the general condition of it, take as followeth:—</P>
<P N="1">I. The country itself, its soil, air, water, sea∣sons and produce, both natural and artificial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the country, soil and produce, &amp;c.</NOTE> is not to be despised. The land containeth divers sorts of earth, as, sand, yellow and black, poor and rich: also gravel, both loamy and dusty; and, in some places, a fast fat earth; like our best vales, in <HI>England;</HI> especially by inland brooks and rivers. God, in his wisdom, having ordered it so, that the advantages of the country are divided; the back lands being generally three to one richer, than those that lie by navigable rivers. We have much of another soil; and that is a black <HI>hazel-mould,</HI> upon a stony, or rocky, bottom.</P>
<P N="2">II. The air is sweet and clear, the Heavens serene, like the south parts of <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the air.</NOTE> rarely over∣cast; and, as the woods come, by numbers of people, to be more cleared, that itself will refine.</P>
<P N="3">III. The waters are generally good;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Waters.</NOTE> for the rivers and brooks have mostly gravel and stony bottoms; and in number, hardly credible. We have also mineral waters, that operate in the same manner with <HI>Barnet</HI> and <HI>North Hall,</HI> not two miles from <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="248" REF="032729_0248_0FF4F128DBBF0AE8"/>IV. For the seasons of the year, having, by God's goodness, now lived over the coldest and hottest, that the oldest liver in the province can remember, I can say something to an <HI>English</HI> un∣derstanding.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fall.</NOTE>First, Of the <HI>fall;</HI> for then I came in: I found it, from the 24th. of October, to the be∣ginning of December, as we have it usually, in <HI>England,</HI> in September, or rather like an <HI>English</HI> mild spring.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Winter.</NOTE> From December to the beginning of the month called March, we had sharp frosty weather; not foul, thick, black weather, as our north east winds bring with them, in <HI>England;</HI> but a sky as clear as in summer, and the air dry, cold, piercing and hungry; yet I remember not that I wore more cloaths, than in <HI>England.</HI> The reason of this cold is given, from the great lakes, that are fed by the fountains of <HI>Canada.</HI> The Winter before was as mild, scarce any ice at all; while this, for a few days, froze up our great river <HI>Delaware.</HI> From that month, to the month cal∣led June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spring.</NOTE> we enjoyed a sweet Spring; no gusts, but gentle showers, and a fine sky. Yet, this I observe, that the winds here, as there, are more inconstant, Spring and Fall, upon that turn of nature, than in Summer, or Winter. From thence to this present month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Summer.</NOTE> (August) which endeth the Summer, (commonly speaking) we have had ex∣traordinary heats, yet mitigated sometimes by cool breezes. The wind, that ruleth the Summer season, is the south west; but spring, fall and winter, it is rare to want the north-western seven days together. And whatever mists, fogs, or va∣pours, foul the Heavens by easterly, or southerly winds, in two hours time, are blown away; the one is followed by the other: A remedy, that seems to have a peculiar providence in it, to the inhabitants; the multitude of trees, yet standing, being liable to retain mists and vapours; and yet not one quarter so thick as I expected.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="249" REF="032729_0249_0FF4F190B4AD7940"/>V. The natural produce of the country, of vegetables, is trees, fruits, plants, flowers. The trees of most note, are the black walnut, cedar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural produce, &amp;c.</NOTE> cypress, chesnut, poplar, gum-wood, hickory, sas∣safras, ash, beech, and oak of divers sorts, as,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees.</NOTE> red, white and black; Spanish, chesnut, and swamp, the most durable of all. Of all which there is plenty, for the use of man.</P>
<P>The fruits, that I find in the woods, are the white and black mulberry, chesnut, walnut, plums,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits.</NOTE> strawberries, cranberries, hurtleberries, and grapes of divers sorts. The great red grape (now ripe) called by ignorance, the <HI>fox grape,</HI> because of the relish it hath with unskilful palates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grapes.</NOTE> is in itself an extraordinary grape; and by art, doubtless, may be cultivated to an excellent wine, if not so sweet, yet little inferior to the <HI>Frontiniac,</HI> as it is not much unlike in taste, ruddiness set aside; which, in such things, as well as mankind, differs the case much. There is a white kind of <HI>Muskadel,</HI> and a little black grape, like the cluster grape of <HI>England,</HI> not yet so ripe as the other; but they tell me, when ripe, sweeter, and that they only want skil∣ful <HI>Vinerons,</HI> to make good use of them. I intend to venture on it with my <HI>Frenchman,</HI> this season, who shews some knowledge in those things. Here are also peaches very good, and in great quantities;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peaches.</NOTE> not an Indian plantation without them; but whe∣ther naturally here at first, I know not. However one may have them, by bushels, for little: they make a pleasant drink; and I think, not inferior to any peach you have in <HI>England,</HI> except the true <HI>Newington.</HI> It is disputable with me, whether it be best to fall to fining the fruits of the country, especially the grape, by the care and skill of art, or send for foreign stems and sets, already good and approved. It seems most reasonable to be∣lieve, that not only a thing groweth best, where it naturally grows, but will hardly be equalled by
<PB N="250" REF="032729_0250_0FF4F12A6A957958"/>
another species of the same kind, that doth not naturally grow there But, to solve the doubt, I intend, if God give me life, to try both, and hope the consequence will be, as good wine, as any <HI>European</HI> countries, of the same latitude, do yield.</P>
<P N="6"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Artificial produce, &amp;c.</NOTE>VI. The artificial produce of the country is wheat, barley,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>"Edward Jones,</HI> son-in-law to <HI>Thomas Wynne,</HI> living on the <HI>Scui∣kil,</HI> had, with ordinary cultivation; for one grain of <HI>English</HI> barley, se∣venty stalks and ears of barley: and it is common in this country, from one bushel sown, to reap forty, often fifty, and sometimes sixty.

<P N="9">IX. There are divers plants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Medicinal plants, &amp;c.</NOTE> that not only the <HI>Indians</HI> tell us, but we have had occasion to prove, by swellings, burnings, cuts, &amp;c. that they are of great virtue, suddenly curing the pati∣ent; and, for smell, I have observed several, espe∣cially one, the wild myrtle; the other I know not what to call, but are most fragrant.</P>

<P>Thus much of the <HI>country;</HI> next, of the <HI>na∣tives,</HI> or <HI>aborigines.</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. The <HI>natives</HI> I shall consider, in their per∣sons, language, manners, religion and government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the In∣dians or ab∣origines.</NOTE> with my sense of their original. For their persons, they are generally tall, straight, well-built, and of singular proportion; they tread strong and clever;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their per∣sons.</NOTE> and mostly walk with a lofty chin. Of complexion, black, but by design; as the <HI>Gypsies,</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> They grease themselves with bear's fat clarified; and using no defence against sun, or weather, their skins must needs be swarthy. Their eye is little and black, not unlike a straight looked <HI>Jew.</HI> The thick lip, and flat nose, so frequent with the East <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>blacks,</HI> are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> common to them: For I have seen as comely <HI>European</HI> like faces

among them, of both, as on your side the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and truly an Italian complexion hath not much more of the white; and the noses of several of them have as much of the <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P N="12"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their lan∣guage.</NOTE>XII. Their language is lofty, yet narrow; but, like the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> in signification, full; like short-hand, in writing, one word serveth in the place of three, and the rest are supplied by the understanding of the hearer: imperfect in their tenses, wanting in their moods, participles, ad∣verbs, conjunctions, interjections. I have made it my business to understand it, that I might not want an Interpreter, on any occasion; and I must say, that I know not a language spoken, in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> that hath words of more sweetness, or great∣ness, in accent and emphasis, than theirs; for in∣stance, <HI>Octocockon, Rancocas, Oricton, Shak, Ma∣rian, Poquesien;</HI> all which are names of places; and have grandeur in them. Of words of sweet∣ness, <HI>Anna,</HI> is mother; <HI>Issimus,</HI> a brother; <HI>Netcap,</HI> friend; <HI>Usqueoret,</HI> very good; <HI>Pane,</HI> bread; <HI>Met∣sa,</HI> eat; <HI>Matta,</HI> no; <HI>Haita,</HI> to have; <HI>Payo,</HI> to come; <HI>Sepassen, Passijon,</HI> the names of places; <HI>Ta∣mane, Secane, Menanse, Secatereus,</HI> are the names of persons; if one ask them for any thing they have not, they will answer, <HI>Matta ne hatta;</HI> which to tran∣slate, is, <HI>not I have;</HI> instead of, I have not.</P>
<P N="13"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their cus∣toms.</NOTE>XIII. Of their customs and manners, there is much to be said; I will begin with children; so soon as they are born,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their children.</NOTE> they wash them in water; and while very young, and in cold weather to chuse, they plunge them in the rivers, to harden and embolden them. Having wrapt them in a clout, they lay them on a strait, thin board, a lit∣tle more than the length and breadth of the child, and swaddle it fast, upon the board, to make it straight; wherefore all <HI>Indians</HI> have flat heads; and thus they carry them at their backs. The children will go, very young, at nine months
<PB N="253" REF="032729_0253_0FF4F19EB4CEAD40"/>
commonly; they wear only a small clout round their waste, till they are big; if boys, they go a fishing, till ripe for the woods; which is about fifteen; then they hunt; and after having given some proofs of their manhood, by a good return of skins, they may marry; else it is a shame to think of a wise. The girls stay with their mo∣thers, and help to hoe the ground, plant corn, and carry burdens; and they do well to use them to that young, which they must do when they are old; for the wives are the true servants of the husbands; otherwise the men are very affectionate to them.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. When the young women are fit for marriage, they wear something upon their heads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of marrying, &amp;c.</NOTE> for an advertisement, but so, as their faces are hardly to be seen, but when they please. The age, they marry at, if women, is about thirteen, and fourteen; if men, seventeen and eighteen; they are rarely elder.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Their houses are mats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their hou∣ses, &amp;c.</NOTE> or barks of trees, set on poles, in the fashion of an <HI>English</HI> barn; but out of the power of the winds; for they are hardly higher than a man; they lie on reeds, or grass. In travel they lodge in the woods, about a great fire, with the mantle of duffils, they wear by day, wrapt about them, and a few boughs stuck round them.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Their diet is maize, or <HI>Indian</HI> corn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their diet.</NOTE> divers ways prepared; sometimes roasted in the ashes; sometimes beaten and boiled with water; which they call <HI>homine;</HI> they also make cakes, not unpleasant to eat. They have likewise several sorts of beans and pease, that are good nourishment; and the woods and rivers are their <HI>larder.</HI></P>
<P N="17">XVII. If an <HI>European</HI> comes to see them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their visit∣ing, &amp;c.</NOTE> or calls for lodging at their house, or <HI>wigwam,</HI> they give him the best place, and first cut. If they come to visit us, they salute us with an <HI>Itah;</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="032729_0254_0FF4F137CBBABF20"/>
which is as much as to say, <HI>Good be to you,</HI> and set them down; which is mostly on the ground, close to their heels, their legs upright; it may be they speak not a word, but observe all passages. If you give them any thing, to eat, or drink, well: for they will not ask; and be it little, or much, if it be with kindness, they are well pleased, else they go away sullen, but say nothing.</P>
<P N="18"><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are revengeful, and conceal resentment, &amp;c.</NOTE>XVIII. They are great concealers of their own resentments; brought to it, I believe, by the revenge, that hath been practised among them. In either of these they are not exceeded by the <HI>Italians.</HI> A tragical instance fell out since I came into the country: a king's daughter, thinking her∣self slighted by her husband, in suffering another woman to lie down between them, rose up, went out, plucked a root out of the ground, and ate it; upon which she immediately died: and, for which, last week, he made an <HI>offering</HI> to her kindred, for atonement, and liberty of marriage; as two others did to the kindred of their wives, that died a natu∣ral death. For, till widowers have done so, they must not marry again. Some of the young women are said to take undue liberty before marriage, for a portion; but when married, chaste. When with child they know their husbands no more, trill deli∣vered; and during their month, they touch no meat they eat but with a stick, lest they should defile it; nor do their husbands frequent them, till that time be expired.</P>
<P N="19"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their great liberality, &amp;c.</NOTE>XIX. But, in liberality they excel; nothing is too good for their friend: give them a fine gun, coat, or other thing, it may pass twenty hands be∣fore it sticks: light of heart, strong affections, but soon spent. The most merry creatures that live, feast and dance perpetually; they never have much, nor want much: wealth circulateth like the blood; all parts partake; and though none shall want what another hath, yet exact observers of property.

Some kings have sold, others presented me with several parcels of land: the pay, or presents I made them, were not hoarded by the particular owners; but the neighbouring kings, and their clans being present, when the goods were brought out, the parties, chiefly concerned, consulted what, and to whom, they should give them. To every king then, by the hands of a person for that work ap∣pointed, is a proportion sent, so sorted and folded, and with that gravity, that is admirable. Then that king subdivideth it, in like manner, among his dependants, they hardly leaving themselves an equal share with one of their subjects: and be it on such occasions as festivals, or at their common meals, the kings distribute, and to themselves last. They care for little; because they want but little; and the reason is, a little contents them. In this they are sufficiently revenged on us: if they are ig∣norant of our pleasures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their free manner of life, cus∣toms, &amp;c.</NOTE> they are also free from our pains. They are not disquieted with bills of lading and exchange, nor perplexed with chancery suits, and exchequer reckonings. We sweat and toil to live; their pleasure feeds them; I mean their hunt∣ing, fishing and fowling; and this table is spread every where. They eat twice a day, morning and evening; their seats and table are the ground. Since the <HI>Europeans</HI> came into these parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their late love of strong li∣quors, &amp;c.</NOTE> they are grown great lovers of <HI>strong liquors,</HI> rum espe∣cially; and for it exchange the richest of their skins and furs. If they are heated with liquors, they are restless till they have enough to sleep; that is their cry, <HI>some more, and I will go to sleep;</HI> but, when drunk, one of the most wretched specta∣cles in the world!</P>
<P N="20">XX. In sickness, impatient to be cured; and for it, give any thing, especially for their children;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Behaviour in sickness, death, &amp;c.</NOTE> to whom they are extremely natural. They drink, at those times, a <HI>teran,</HI> or decoction of some roots in spring water; and, if they eat any flesh, it must
<PB N="256" REF="032729_0256_0FF4F1395B73D118"/>
be of the female of any creature. If they die, they bury them with their apparel, be they man or woman; and the nearest of kin fling in some∣thing precious with them, as a token of their love: Their mourning is blacking of their faces; which they continue for a year. They are choice of the graves of their dead; for, lest they should be lost by time, and fall to common use, they pick off the grass, that grows upon them, and heap up the fallen earth, with great care and exactness.</P>
<P N="21"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their religion, &amp;c.</NOTE>XXI. These poor people are under a dark night in things relating to <HI>religion,</HI> to be sure the tradition of it: yet they believe a <HI>God</HI> and <HI>immor∣tality,</HI> without the help of metaphysics: for, they say, <HI>There is a Great King that made them, who dwells in a glorious country, to the southward of them; and that the souls of the good shall go thither, where they shall live again.</HI> Their <HI>worship</HI> consists of two parts, <HI>sacrifice</HI> and <HI>cantico.</HI> Their sacrifice is their first fruits; the first and fattest buck they kill, goeth to the fire; where he is all burnt, with a mournful ditty of him, that performeth the ceremony; but with such marvellous fervency, and labour of body, that he will, even, sweat to a foam. The other part is their <HI>cantico,</HI> performed by round dances, sometimes words, sometimes songs, then shouts; two being in the middle, that begin; and, by singing and drumming on a board, direct the chorus. Their postures, in the dance, are very antick and differing, but all keep measure. This is done with equal earnestness and labour, but great appearance of joy. In the fall, when the corn cometh in, they begin to feast one another. There have been two great festivals already; to which all come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their feast∣ings, &amp;c.</NOTE> that will. I was at one myself: their entertainment was a great seat by a spring, under some shady trees, and twenty bucks, with hot cakes of new corn, both wheat and beans; which they make up in a square form, in the leaves
<PB N="257" REF="032729_0257_0FF4F1A1D7DC9CB0"/>
of the stem, and bake them in the ashes; and after that they fall to dance. But they that go must carry a small present, in their money; it may be sixpence; which is made of the bone of a fish:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their mo∣ney.</NOTE> the <HI>black</HI> is, with them, as <HI>gold;</HI> the <HI>white, silver;</HI> they call it all <HI>wampum.</HI></P>
<P N="22">XXII. Their government is by Kings; which they call <HI>Sachama;</HI> and those by succession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their go∣vernment.</NOTE> but al∣ways of the mother's side. For instance, the chil∣dren of him, who is now king, will not succeed, but his brother by the mother, or the children of his sister, whose sons (and after them the children of her daughters) will reign; for no woman inherits. The reason, they render for this way of descent, is, that their issue may not be spurious.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. Every King hath his council; and that consists of all the old and wise men of his nation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their mode of doing bu∣siness with W. Penn &amp;c.</NOTE> which, perhaps, is two hundred people. Nothing of moment is undertaken, be it war, peace, sel∣ling of land, or traffick, without advising with them; and, which is more, with the young men too. It is admirable to consider how powerful the Kings are, and yet how they move by the breath of their people. I have had occasion to be in council with them, upon treaties for land, and to adjust the terms of trade. Their order is thus: The King sits in the middle of an half moon, and hath his council, the old and wise, on each hand; be∣hind them, or at a little distance, sit the younger fry, in the same figure. Having consulted and resolved their business, the King ordered one of them to speak to me; he stood up, came to me, and, in the name of his King, saluted me; then took me by the hand, and told me, "He was or∣dered by his King to speak to me; and that now it was not he, but the King, that spoke; because what he should say was the King's mind."—He first prayed me, "To excuse them, that they had not complied with me, the last time, he feared
<PB N="258" REF="032729_0258_0FF4F13AEBC53EF8"/>
there might be some fault in the Interpreter, being neither <HI>Indian</HI> nor <HI>English:</HI> besides, it was the <HI>In∣dian</HI> custom, to deliberate, and take up much time, in council, before they resolve; and that, if the young people, and owners of the land had been as ready as he, I had not met with so much delay."—Having thus introduced his matter, he fell to the bounds of the land, they had agreed to dispose of, and the price; which now is little and dear; that which would have bought twenty miles, not buying now two. During the time, that this person spoke, not a man of them was observed to whisper or smile; the old, grave; the young, re∣verent, in their deportment. They speak little, but fervently, and with elegance. I have never seen more natural sagacity, considering them with∣out the help (I was going to say, the spoil) of tra∣dition; and he will deserve the name of wise, that outwits them, in any treaty, about a thing, they understand. When the purchase was agreed, great promises passed between us, "of kindness and good neighbourhood, and that the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English</HI> must live in love as long as the sun gave light:" Which done, another made a speech to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the name of all the <HI>Sachamakers,</HI> or Kings; first, to tell them what was done; next, to charge and command them, "To love the <HI>Christians,</HI> and particularly live in peace with me, ☞and the people under my government; that many Governors had been in the river; but that no Go∣vernor had come himself to live and stay here be∣fore; and having now such an one, that had treated them well▪ they should never do him, or his, any wrong."—At every sentence of which they shouted, and said, <HI>Amen,</HI> in their way.</P>
<P N="24"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their mode of doing jus∣tice, &amp;c.</NOTE>XXIV. The justice they have is pecuniary: In case of any wrong, or evil fact, be it murder itself, they atone by feasts, and presents of their <HI>wampum;</HI> which is proportioned to the quality of
<PB N="259" REF="032729_0259_0FF4F1A3675B41A0"/>
the offence, or person injured, or of the sex they are of. For, in case they kill a woman, they pay double; and the reason they render, is, "That she breedeth children; which men cannot do." It is rare that they fall out, if sober; and, if drunk, they forgive it, saying, "It was the <HI>drink,</HI> and not the <HI>man,</HI> that abused them."</P>
<P N="25">XXV. We have agreed, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An agree∣ment be∣tween them and Willi∣am Penn, &amp;c.</NOTE> in all differ∣ences between us, <HI>six</HI> of each side shall end the matter. Do not abuse them, but let them have justice, and you win them. The worst is, that they are the worse for the <HI>Christians;</HI> who have propagated their vices, and yielded them tradition for ill, and not for good things. But as low an ebb as these people are at, and as inglorious as their own condition looks, the <HI>Christians</HI> have not outlived <HI>their sight,</HI> with all their pretensions to an higher manifestation. What good, then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their sus∣ceptibility of improve∣ment, &amp;c.</NOTE> might not a good people graft, where there is so distinct a knowledge left between good and evil? I beseech God to incline the hearts or all that come into these parts, to outlive the knowledge of the <HI>na∣tives,</HI> by a fixt obedience to their greater know∣ledge of the will of God; for it were miserable, indeed, for us to fall under the just censure of the poor <HI>Indian</HI> conscience, while we make profession of things so far transcending.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. For their original, I am ready to be∣lieve them of the <HI>Jewish race;</HI> I mean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their original.</NOTE> of the stock of the <HI>ten tribes;</HI> and that, for the following rea∣sons: First, they were to go to a <HI>"land not plan∣ted, nor known;"</HI> which, to be sure, <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> were, if not <HI>Europe;</HI> and he, that intended that extraordinary judgment upon them, might make the passage not uneasy to them, as it is not impossible in itself, from the eastermost parts of of <HI>Asia,</HI> to the westermost of <HI>America.</HI> In the next place; I find them of the like countenance, and their children of so lively resemblance, that a

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI> <DATE><HI>the 14th. of the Sixth-month,</HI> 1683.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH it be a duty, I humbly own,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> to inform the Lords of the committee of plantations, of what concerns his majesty's interest in the suc∣cess of this province, I thought myself equally obliged to be discreet and cautious in doing it. To write, then, there was need, and not to trou∣ble persons, of their honor and business, with things trivial, at least, raw and unfinished for their view. This hitherto put me by giving any account of the state of our affairs, to say nothing of the mighty difficulties, I have laboured under, in the settlement of six-and-twenty sail of people, to con∣tent, within the space of one year; which makes my case singular, and excusable, above any other of the King's plantations.</P>
<P>But because my agent has informed me that the Proprietor of <HI>Maryland</HI> has been early in his account of our conference about fixing our bounds, and made a narrative of my affairs, as well before, as at that time, a little to my disadvantage, and the rather, because my silence might be interpreted neglect, I am necessitated to make some defence for myself; which, as it will not he hard to make, so I hope it will be received as just.</P>
<P>I humbly say, then, first, that it seemed to me improper to trouble the Lords with my tran∣sactions with this Proprietor, till we were come to some result; which we were not: for we parted till spring; and even then were but to meet about the methods of our proceedings.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="032729_0268_0FF4F1B0308061C0"/>Next, This narrative was taken by the Lord's orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> without my consent, or knowledge, in a corner of a room by one of his own attendants.</P>
<P>And, lastly, upon when notice was given of this usage, I complained to him, he promised, upon his word and honor, it should go not far∣ther; and that it was for his own satisfaction he did it; I told him that mitigated the thing a little; but if he should divulge it before I saw and agreed to the copy, he must pardon me, if I looked upon it as a most unfair practice.—What that Lord has done, and what to call it, I leave to my betters; but the surprize and indigestion of the whole will, I hope excuse me of neglect, or disrespect: for though I am unceremonious, I would, by no means, act the rude, or undutiful.</P>
<P>This said, I humbly beg that I may give a brief narrative of the matter, as it then passed, since has been, and now stands, without the weak∣ness and tautology his relation makes me guilty of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of W. Penn's arrival, &amp;c.</NOTE>So soon as I arrived, which was on the 24th. of October last, I immediately dispatched two per∣sons to the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> to ask of his health, offer kind neighbourhood, and agree a time of meeting the better to establish it: While they were gone of this errand, I went to <HI>New-York,</HI> that I might pay my duty to the Duke, in the visit of his government and colony. At my return, which was towards the end of November, I found the messengers, whom I had sent to <HI>Maryland,</HI> newly arrived, and the time fixed, being the 19th. of December. I prepared myself in a few days for that province. The 11th. of the month I came to west river; where I met the Proprietor, atten∣ded suitable to his character; who took the occa∣sion, by his civilities, to shew me the greatness of his power: The next day we had conference about our business of the bounds, both at the same table, with our respective members of council.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="032729_0269_0FF4F20B6CBB9190"/>The first thing I did was to present the King's letter; which consisted of two parts:—One, that the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had but two degrees; and the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> that, beginning at <HI>Watkins's</HI> point, he should ad∣measure his said degrees, at 60 miles to a degree. This being read by him, first privately, then publicly, he told me, the King was greatly mista∣ken, and that he would not leave his patent, to follow the King's letter, nor could a letter void his patent; and by that he would stand.</P>
<P>This was the substance of what he said from first to last, during the whole conference. To this I answered, the King might be misinformed rather than mistaken, and that I was afraid the mistake would fall on his side; for though his pa∣tent begins at <HI>Watkins's</HI> point and goes to the forti∣eth degree of north latitude, yet it presumed that to lye in the 38th. else <HI>Virginia</HI> would be wronged, which should extend to that degree; however this I assured him, that when I petitioned the King for five degrees north latitude and that petition was referred to the Lords of the committee of planta∣tions; at that time, it was urged by some present, that the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had but two degrees; upon which the Lord President, turning his head to me, at whose chair I stood, said, Mr. <HI>Penn, will not three degrees serve your turn?</HI> I answered, <HI>"I submit both the what, and how, to the honour∣able board."</HI></P>
<P>To this his uncle, and chancellor, returned, that to convince me his father's grant was not by degrees, he had more of <HI>Virginia</HI> given him, but being planted, and the grant intending only land not planted, or possessed, but of savage na∣tives, he left it out, that it might not forfeit the rest: Of which the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> takes no notice, in his narrative, that I remember.—But, by that answer, he can pretend nothing to <HI>Delaware;</HI> which was at, and before, the passing of that pa∣tent,
<PB N="270" REF="032729_0270_0FF4F1B1CA618FF0"/>
bought and planted by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and so could not be given:—But, if it were, it was for∣feited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> for not reducing it, during twenty years, under the <HI>English</HI> sovereignty; of which he held it; but was at last reduced by the King, and there∣fore his, to give as he pleaseth.</P>
<P>Perceiving that my pressing the King's letter was uneasy, and that I had determined myself to dispose him with utmost softness to a good compli∣ance, I waved that of the two degrees, and pressed the admeasurement only, the next part of the let∣ter:—For though it were two degrees, and a half from <HI>Watkins's</HI> point to forty degrees, yet let it be measured at sixty miles to a degree, and I would begin at forty degrees, fall as it would:—My de∣sign was, that every degree being seventy miles, I should get all that was over sixty, the proportion intended the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> by the grant, and computation of a degree, at that time of the day:—Thus he had enjoyed the full favour intend∣ed him, and I had gained a door of great impor∣tance to the peopling and improving of his majesty's province.</P>
<P>But he this also rejected;—I told him, it was not the love, or need, of the land, but the water; that he abounded in what I wanted, and access and harbouring, even, to excess; that I would not be thus importunate, but for the importance of the thing, to save a province; and because there was no proportion in the concern; if I were an hundred times more urgent and tenacious, the case would excuse it; because the thing insisted on was more than ninety-nine times more valuable to me than to him; to me the head, to him, the tail.—I added, that, if it were his, and he gave it me, planting it would recompence the favours, not only by laying his country between two thriving provinces, but the ships, that come yearly to <HI>Ma∣ryland</HI> for <HI>tobacco,</HI> would have the bringing of
<PB N="271" REF="032729_0271_0FF4F20D0770CCE8"/>
both our people and merchandize; because they can afford it cheaper; whereby <HI>Maryland</HI> would, for one age or two be the mart of trade.<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penns's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> But this also had no other entertainment, but hopes that I would not insist on these things at our next meet∣ing; after three days time we parted; and I return∣ed to this province.</P>
<P>When the spring came I sent an express to pray the time and place, when and where I should meet him, to effect the business, we adjourned to, at that time. I followed close upon the messenger, that no time might be lost. But the expectation, he twice had, of the Lord <HI>Culpepper's</HI> visit, disap∣pointed any meeting on our affairs, till the month called May; he then sent three gentlemen to let me know, he would meet me at the head of the bay of <HI>Chesapeak;</HI> I was then in treaty with the kings of the natives for land; but three days after we met ten miles from <HI>New-castle,</HI> which is thirty from the bay. I invited him to the town, where having entertained him, as well as the town could afford, on so little notice, and finding him only desirous of speaking with me privately, I pressed that we might, at our distinct lodgings, sit seve∣rally with our councils, and treat by way of writ∣ten memorials; which would prevent the mistakes, or abuses, that may follow from ill designs, or ill memory; but he avoided it, saying, "He was not well, and the weather sultry, and would return with what speed he could, reserving any other treaty to another season."—Thus we parted, at that time. I had been before told by divers, that the said <HI>Baltimore</HI> had issued forth a proclamation,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the note in page 265, &amp;c.</NOTE> to invite people, by lower prices, and greater quan∣tities of land, to plant in the lower counties; in which the Duke's goodness had interested me, as an inseparable benefit to this whole province. I was not willing to believe it; and the being in haste, I omitted to ask him: But I had not been
<PB N="272" REF="032729_0272_0FF4F1B359EC1BC0"/>
long returned before two letters came from two judges of two of the country courts, that such a proclamation was abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> that the people too hear∣ken to it, but yet prayed my directions. I bade them keep their ground, and not fear, for the King would be judge. Upon this I dispatched to the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> three of my council, with the clerk of it: As they went they got an authentic copy, under the hand of one of his sheriffs, to whom an original had been directed: But, as the last civility, I would yield him, I forbad them to seem to believe any thing, but what they had from his own mouth.—Thus they delivered my letter.</P>
<P>At first, he denied any such proclamation, turning to two gentlemen of his council, who stood by, he asked them, if they remembered any such thing? They also denied it. Upon which the persons, I sent, produced the attested copy; which, refreshing their memories, they confessed there was such a proclamation.</P>
<P>But the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> told them, that it was his ancient form, and he only did it to renew his claim, not that he would encourage any to plant there. They then prayed him to call it in, lest any trouble should ensue: but he refused it.—This was during a civil treaty, without any demand made, and after the place had been many years in the quiet possession of the Duke.—What to call this I still humbly refer to my superiors. For his pretensions to those parts I have thoroughly instruct∣ed my agent; who, I hope, will be able to detect them of weakness and inconsistency. This is a true, though brief, narrative of the entertainment, I have had from that Lord, in the business be∣tween us.</P>
<P>And because I have, as in duty joined, sent an agent extraordinary, to wait upon the King, and his ministers, in the affairs of this province (so soon as I could make any settlement in it) I shall only
<PB N="273" REF="032729_0273_0FF4F20E98B26340"/>
humbly pray leave to hint at two or three things, relating to the business depending between this lord and myself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> about finding the fortieth degree of north latitude.</P>
<P N="1">I. That I have common fame on my side, grounded upon ancient and constant judges, that the fortieth degree of north latitude lyeth about <HI>Boles's-isle.</HI> This the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> himself, hath not denied; and the country confesseth; and I shall, when required, prove by some able masters of ships.</P>
<P N="2">II. If this were an error, it is grounded upon such skill and instruments, as gave measure to the time, in which his patent was granted:—and if he hath got upon <HI>Virginia</HI> by that error, he should not get upon me by an exacter knowledge, considering that <HI>Carolina,</HI> which endeth by degrees, would as much advance upon <HI>Virginia,</HI> if the reputed latitude of unprejudiced times should take no place;—for by advancing her bounds twenty miles, by a new instrument, beyond the place; which hath been generally taken for thirty-six and an half degrees; and <HI>Virginia</HI> not being equally able to advance upon <HI>Maryland,</HI> because of its being at a place certain, she will be greatly narrowed between both.</P>
<P N="3">III. I, therefore, most humbly pray, that the judgment of ancient times, by which persons at the distance of <HI>England</HI> from <HI>America,</HI> have governed themselves, may conclude that the lord's bounds, or, that he may measure his two degrees according to the scale and computations of those times, which was sixty miles to a degree; or, if it be allowed, that he had not his grant by degrees, that, at last, I might not lose the benefit of admeasurement, as before mentioned, from <HI>Watkins's-point,</HI> in whatever degree of latitude that shall be found, to the fortieth degree of north latitude, which I humbly take the more courage to press, because a province lyeth at stake, in the success of it.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="032729_0274_0FF4F1C03B23ADD0"/>I have only humbly to add, that the province hath a prospect of an extraordinary improvement, as well by divers sorts of strangers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's letter to the Lords of plantations, &amp;c.</NOTE> as <HI>English</HI> sub∣jects; that, in all acts of justice, we name and ve∣nerate the King's authority; that I have followed the Bishop of <HI>London's</HI> counsel, by buying, and not taking away the natives' land; with whom I have settled a very kind correspondence. I return my most humble thanks for your former favors, in the passing of my patent, and pray God reward you. I am most ready to obey all your commands, according to the obligations of them, and beseech you to take this province into your protection, un∣der his Majesty, and him, whom his goodness hath made Governor of it, into your favours, for that I am, with most sincere devotion,</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>An answer to a <HI>demand,</HI> made to <HI>Nicholas Moore,</HI> as my deputy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> by Colonel <HI>George Talbot,</HI> the <HI>24th.</HI> of September, <HI>1683,</HI> in pursuance of a <HI>commission,</HI> from the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> Proprietary of <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Avalon,</HI> dated the <HI>17th.</HI> of the same month.</HEAD>
<P>The demand being grounded upon the <HI>com∣mission,</HI> I will take things in their order, and begin with the commission.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> doth commissionate Colo∣nel <HI>Talbot</HI> to go to the west side of the <HI>Skulkil</HI> to demand of <HI>William Penn,</HI> Esquire, or his deputy, all that part of land on the west side of that river, that lyeth to the south of the fortieth degree of northerly latitude.</P>
<P N="1">I. I answer, it seems very slight, abrupt and unprecedented for any person, that is in the quality of a Proprietary of a country, to send to another in the same circumstance, any extraordinary mes∣senger, agent, or commissioner, without some let∣ter, or memorial, to state the <HI>demand,</HI> with the reasons of it; the practice of the greatest princes, and might therefore (I conceive) be the condescen∣sion of lesser seigniories.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the next place, <HI>William Penn,</HI> Esquire, and the said <HI>Penn,</HI> (the language of the commission) is not my <HI>American</HI> style, nor that which belongs to me, in the matter in question; for, as such, I keep no deputies.</P>
<P N="3">III. I live not on the west side of <HI>Skulkil,</HI> nor any deputy of mine; and I conceive Colonel <HI>Talbot</HI> could not, by that commission, come to the east side, to make his demand; which yet he did.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I was absent, and at <HI>New-York,</HI> when this commissioner came; and I never did, nor never will, commission any deputy to treat and conclude away my inheritance, without my particular di∣rection
<PB N="277" REF="032729_0277_0FF4F21E2A421998"/>
and command; though, if I were to go for <HI>England,</HI> I would not disown the laws, he should make in my absence, for public good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> when I came back.</P>
<P N="5">V. Colonel <HI>Talbot</HI> is directed, in the com∣mission, to make the demand, according to a line, said to be run, in obedience to his majesty's com∣mand, in his letter of the 2d. of April, 1681; but I say, that no line is yet run, in obedience to his majesty's command;—for the letter expressly saith, that the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> or his agent, shall, together with my agent, agree to the latitude, and then run the line, and bound the provinces accord∣ingly; which is not yet done: For those observa∣tions, and the line run by them, are performed by the Lord <HI>Baltimore,</HI> and his agents only, and there∣fore not according to his majesty's command, in his letter of the 2d. of April, 1681, nor, in my opi∣nion, common equity; for I knew nothing of them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. To say (as his commission doth) that my commissioners refused to comply with the said let∣ter, is hard for me to do; since the chiefest of them brought it in my favour. But the truth is, (if they say true, and circumstances favour them) the thing is improbable; for the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> would have had them agreed to have taken an ob∣servation upon the river <HI>Delaware,</HI> when as the King's letter (stating my bounds, as they are ex∣pressed in my patent) begins twelve miles above <HI>New-castle,</HI> upon the west side of <HI>Delaware</HI> river, and so to run to the 43d. degree of north lati∣tude, upon the said river; which makes it impossi∣ble, that the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> could come within those limits to take an observation, or run a line, in pursuance of his majesty's commands, in the said letter; since taking an observation on <HI>Delaware</HI> river (which, say they, he pressed) is a plain viola∣tion of it. They further say, that they never re∣fused, but pressed the taking of an observation,
<PB N="278" REF="032729_0278_0FF4F1C370F449A0"/>
according to his majesty's letter; which is grounded on the bounds of my patent;<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> and when the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> and my agent had agreed to meet at <HI>New-castle,</HI> and to proceed according to his ma∣jesty's letter, 'tis true that my agent came not, and as true, saith he, that the reason was the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> called immediately at <HI>Chichester,</HI> alias, <HI>Marcus Hooks,</HI> as he went to <HI>New-castle,</HI> and for∣bad the inhabitants to pay me <HI>Quit-rent,</HI> and named the place by a new name, before any line was run, or any observation agreed; which being a declared breach of the King's commands, and their treaty, in the opinion of my agent, he re∣fused to meet the next day about a matter, the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had, in such a manner, already determined.</P>
<P N="7">VII. But what fault soever they were in, sure I am, that, before an observation was agree, or any line was run, I came in, and suddenly after waited upon the Lord <HI>Baltimore.</HI> I presented him with another letter from his majesty; which he was so far from complying with, that he looked upon the King, as mistaken, and set his patent in direct opposition; and to this day would never hear of complying with it, in either of the two points it related to; that is to say, his having but two degrees, and that beginning them at <HI>Watkins's</HI> point, he should admeasure them, at sixty miles to a degree, to terminate the north bounds of his province. Now, in my opinion, it was not pro∣per to ground his proceedings upon a former let∣ter, in neglect of a later advice and command from his majesty: Nor doth it look very just to make the caution, or neglect of an agent, in the absence of his principal, a reason to proceed against his principal, when present with other instructions, without due regard had to him, or his allegations. And I must say, that, at <HI>New-castle,</HI> when I pres∣sed the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> to sit in one house with his
<PB N="279" REF="032729_0279_0FF4F21FB9829C48"/>
Council, and I would sit with mine in another, that we might treat by written memorials under our hands, to prevent mistakes, ill memory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> or ill will, he refused, alledging, he was not well; I did then tell him, I would wave what force or ad∣vantage I thought I had by the second letter, and proceed to meet him at the place he desired, which was the head of <HI>Chesapeak</HI> bay, and there try to find the fortieth degree of north latitude, provi∣ded he would first please to set me a gentlemanly price; so much per mile, in case I should have no part of the bay by latitude; that so I might have a back port to this province. This I writ, accor∣ding to his desire, and sent after him, to sell he refused, but started an exchange of part of that bay for the lower counties, on the bay of <HI>Delaware.</HI> This, I presume, he knew I could not do; for his <HI>Royal Highness</HI> had the one half; and I did not prize the thing, I desired, at such a rate. Soon after this meeting, I understood that he had issued forth a proclamation some time before, to invite people to plant those parts in my possession, under his <HI>Royal Highness;</HI> and that also before any de∣mand had been made, or our friendly treaty ended; which I took so ill, in right of his <HI>Royal Highness,</HI> and that which his goodness had made mine, that I sent commissioners (first to know the truth of it from his own mouth, before I would credit the intelligence, I had received, and, if true) to com∣plain of the breach of our friendly treaty, and that it might be repaired; which he hath taken so ill (how deservedly let the whole world judge) that he hath sent me letters of a very coarse style; such, as indeed, could not be answered without those terms, which unbecome men in our public stations; who, in the midst of all disagreements, ought to manage themselves with coolness and exact civility; and, if, in this, I have, at any time, been short, let me but know it, and I, that think it a meanness of spirit to justify an error,
<PB N="280" REF="032729_0280_0FF4F1C50439D150"/>
when committed, am not too stiff to ask him par∣don.<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> Here I left him, expecting his news when he came to the head of the bay, in September, as I thought he promised me; but instead of that, an observation is taken, a line run, and trees marked, without my notice, and a demand made thereupon, and all grounded on his majesty's let∣ter of the 2d. of April 1681: in which I must again say, I find no such direction, which bring∣eth me to the demand itself.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. To the <HI>demand, viz.</HI> Of all that land on <HI>Delaware</HI> river to the south of the fortieth de∣gree of north latitude, I have this to say, that 'tis very odd the demand should be made several months after the proclamation was put forth, to encourage people to plant most of the parts de∣manded; but much more strange, that, after the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had declared under his hand, that he did not by that intend to break our amicable treaty, he should, without further provocation given, proceed to demand those parts! Certainly, this was not intended to continue our friendship; nor did it look with common decency, that Colo∣nel <HI>Talbot</HI> should not think me worth leaving a letter at my house, where he lodged, when he went away, as well as the land worth such a de∣mand. But, indeed, his carriage all along shews, he came to defie me, not treat me, like either a neighbour, or gentleman. A sudden change amu∣sing the King's people, under my charge, by threats, or drawing them off their obedience, by degrading mine; and invitations to the Lord <HI>Bal∣timore's</HI> government. This I found at my return, in his conduct (though not in his commission) as some of the people do aver.</P>
<P N="9">IX. But, in the next place, the Lord <HI>Balti∣more</HI> hath no warrant to run his line to the river of <HI>Delaware,</HI> neither by the King's letter, nor his own patent, if he peruseth them well, where he will find the <HI>bay,</HI> but not the <HI>river,</HI> of <HI>Delaware.</HI></P>
<P N="10"><PB N="281" REF="032729_0281_0FF4F2215FBECCF0"/>X. The land demanded is not a part of the province of <HI>Maryland,</HI> as is expressed in the de∣mand; for it is in the jurisdiction of <HI>Delaware,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> (alias, <HI>Newcastle)</HI> which is by several acts of the Assembly of <HI>Maryland,</HI> distinguished and disowned from being any part of that province.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> hath no land given him by patent, but what was unplanted of any but savage nations; and this west side of the river <HI>Delaware,</HI> before, and at, the passing of his pa∣tent, was actually bought and possessed by a civil and christian people, in amity with the crown of <HI>England;</HI> and by the treaty of peace in 1653, be∣tween the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> it was part of one article of the treaty, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> should enjoy those territories, in <HI>America,</HI> of which this was a member; and we do know, foreign actions of that time and kind continued firm after his majesty's restoration; for <HI>Jamaica</HI> still remains to us; and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> itself was not rendered, but sold.—To be short, I conceive, it is more for the Lord <HI>Balti∣more's</HI> honour and safety, that it should be so, as I say, than otherwise:—For, if he claimeth what was possessed of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> on <HI>Delaware</HI> river, south of the fortieth degree of north-latitude, as what was lawfully under the <HI>English</HI> sovereignty, how cometh he to suffer part of his province to re∣main under a strange and foreign sovereignty to that, under which he held his claim?</P>
<P N="12">XII. But, if the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had a just pretence to this river, and former possession too, which he never had, yet being by the <HI>Dutch</HI> taken, and by the King taken from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it becomes the conqueror's:—For, it is known, that, if any of our <HI>English</HI> merchants ships be taken, and pos∣sessed but twenty-four hours, by an enemy, if re∣taken by the crown, they are prize; and this place was more than twenty-four years in the hands of

the <HI>Dutch.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the original is the following note in the margin, <HI>viz.</HI></P><P>—"And not demanded of them; and the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> that settled on Christeen-creek; which is about four miles from <HI>New Castle,</HI> and where they have been about years, never heard of a demand, that was ever made to them, by the lord Baltimore's father, nor him∣self; as the old men among them do declare."</P></NOTE> This made his <HI>Royal Highness</HI> take out fresh patents, upon the opinion of Council (since the last conquest) for his territories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to the Lord Baltimore's demand.</NOTE> in <HI>America.</HI> Nor is the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> in the condi∣tion of an ordinary subject; (in whose favour something might be alledged) for he hath <HI>reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> principality,</HI> though subordinate to the King, as his style shews; and I conceive he is bound to keep his own dominions, or else lose them; and if lost to a foreigner, and taken by the sovereign, the sovereign hath the right; another conqueror could plead. This is the present <HI>jus gentium,</HI> and law of nations; which in foreign acquests pre∣vaileth; and the King, accordingly has granted it, under his great seal of <HI>England,</HI> to his <HI>Royal High∣ness.</HI> And, if there were no truth in this, but the Lord <HI>Baltimore's</HI> patent were title good enough for what was actually another's before, and which he never enjoyed since, <HI>Connecticut</HI> colony might put in for <HI>New-York,</HI> as reasonably as the Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> can for <HI>Delaware,</HI> their patent having that part of the <HI>Dutch</HI> territories within its bounds, on the same mistake.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">(Note in the margin.) "Which is yet out of dispute from the lord <HI>Baltimore's</HI> own patent, that saith, <HI>New England</HI> begins where he ceaseth; which being at 40 degrees, north latitude, it follows that <HI>New York,</HI> and part of <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Jersey</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> will fall to <HI>New England."</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="13">XIII. I shall conclude with this, that the King, by articles of peace, between him and the states of <HI>Holland,</HI> is the allowed owner of all that territory, in <HI>America,</HI> once called <HI>New Netherland;</HI> of which this is a part. He hath been graciously pleased to grant it by two patents, and this, in controversy, by one, under the great seal of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> to his dearest brother, <HI>James,</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Albany,</HI> &amp;c. And his <HI>Royal Highness,</HI>

<P>Such appears to have been the state of this con∣troversy, at this time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1684.

This they readily agreed to; and would, probably, have been willing to endure much greater punishment, on these terms; so great is their love of strong liquors!

He was well on the First-day night, being the first of February (so called;) about eight next morning, as he sat down to shave, his head twitch∣ed both ways, or sides; and he gave a shriek, and fell as dead; and so remained some hours; they opportunely blooded and cupped him, and plied his head with red-hot <HI>frying-pans:</HI>—He returned, and continu∣ed till Sixth-day noon; but mostly in great tortures. He seemed very penitent, asking pardon of all, even the poorest subject he had wronged; prayed for pardon, and to be delivered out of the world; The Duke ap∣pearing mighty humble and sorrowful;—'twas a loss, with his gain:— He was an able man for a divided and troubled kingdom.—The present King was proclaimed about three o'clock that day; a proclamation fol∣lowed, with the King's speech, to maintain the church and state, as esta∣blished; to keep property and use clemency.—Tonnage and poundage, with the excise, are revived, <HI>de bene esse,</HI> till the parliament meet.—One is now chusing;—The people of <HI>Westminster</HI> just gone by, to chuse.—It sits the 19th. of the third month next. In <HI>Scotland,</HI> one next month.— Severities continue still; but some ease to us faintly promised.—Be care∣ful that no indecent speeches pass against the government; for the King going, with his Queen, publickly to <HI>Mass,</HI> in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> gives occasion.— He declared he concealed himself, to obey his brother, and that now he would be above board; which we like the better, on many accounts.— I was with him and told him so;—but withall, hoped <HI>We</HI> should come in for a share;—He smiled, and said, he desired not that peaceable people should be disturbed for their religion:—And till his coronation, the 23d. when he and his consort are together to be crowned, no hopes of re∣lease; and till the Parliament no hopes of any sixt liberty.—My business, I would hope, is better,—The late King, the papists will have, died a <HI>Roman Catholic;</HI> for he refused (after his usual way of evading uneasy things, with unpreparedness first, and then weakness) the church of England's communion. Bishop <HI>Ken,</HI> of <HI>Wells,</HI> pressing him, that it would be to his comfort, and that of his people, to see he died of that religion, he had made profession of living; but it would not do:—and once all but the duke, Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> and Lord <HI>Feversham,</HI> were turned out, and one <HI>Huddlestone,</HI> a <HI>Romish Priest,</HI> was seen about that time, near the chamber.—This is most of our news.—The popish lords and gentry go to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> to mass, daily; and the <HI>Tower,</HI> (or <HI>Royal Chapel</HI>) is crammed (by vying) with the protestant lords and gentry:—The late King's children, even, by the Dutchess of <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> go thither.—Our King stands more upon his terms, than the other, with <HI>France;</HI> and tho' he has not his brother's abilities, he has great discipline and industry.— Alas! the world is running over to you; and great quantities together is to put the sale of lands out of my own hands, after I have spent what I got by my own, on the public service: for I am £.3,000 worse in my estate, than at first; I can say it before the Lord; I have only the com∣fort of having approved myself a faithful steward, to my understanding, and ability; <HI>and yet, I hope, my children shall receive it, in the love of yours, when we are gone."</HI></P><P>The rest of this letter consists principally of salutations to the people, in general, both of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>New Jersey,</HI> and also to divers par∣ticulars, by name; with some instructions or directions of a more private nature;—but as the names of such families as the Proprietary expressed this particular respect to, may, at this time, be acceptable to some, now to see, they here follow, as transcribed from his own hand, omitting the rest, <HI>viz.</HI></P><P>—"Dearly salute me to dear friends, in their meetings, and par∣ticularly to dear John Simcock, Christopher Taylor, J.

<P>We have had the person of <HI>Patrick Robinson</HI> under restraint, for di∣vers insolencies and affronts unto the Assembly;—but there was a right and good understanding betwixt the President, Council and Assembly, and a happy and friendly farewell.</P>
<P>Dear and honoured Sir, the honor of God, the love of your person, and the preservation of the peace and welfare of the government were, we hope, the only center, to which all our actions did tend. And al∣though the wisdom of the Assembly thought fit to humble that aspiring and corrupt minister of state, <HI>Nicholas Moore;</HI> yet, to you, dear Sir, and to the happy success of your affairs, our hearts are open and our hands ready, at all times to subscribe ourselves, in the name of ourselves and all the freemen we represent,</P>

<HEAD>William Penn, Proprietor and Governor,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To my trusty and well beloved friends, Thomas Lloyd, Nicholas Moore, James Claypoole, Ro∣bert Turner and John Eckley, or any three of them, at Philadelphia:</HEAD>
<P>TRUSTY and well-beloved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣prietary's instructions to them.</NOTE> I heartily sa∣lute you; lest any should scruple the termination of President Lloyd's commission, with his place in the Provincial Council, and to the end that there may be a more constant residence of the ho∣norary and governing part of the government, for the keeping all things in good order I have sent a fresh commission of deputation to you, making any three of you a <HI>quorum,</HI> to act in the execution of laws, enacting, disannulling, or va∣rying of laws, as if I myself were there present, reserving to myself the confirmation of what is done, and my peculiar royalties and advantages.</P>
<P>First, You are to oblige the <HI>Provincial Coun∣cil</HI> to their charter attendance; or to take such a Council, as you think convenient, to advise and assist you, in the business of the public: for I will no more endure their most slothful and dishono∣rable attendance, but dissolve the frame, without any more ado: let them look to it, if further oc∣casion be given.</P>
<P>Secondly, That you keep to the dignity of our station, in Council, and out; but especial∣ly, to suffer no disorder in the Council, nor the Council and Assembly, or either of them, to en∣trench upon the powers and privileges remaining yet in me.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That you admit not any parleys, or open conferences, between the Provincial Coun∣cil and Assembly; but one, with your approbation, propose and let the other consent or dissent, accor∣ding to charter.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="032729_0306_0FF4F25A752992C8"/>Fourthly, That you curiously inspect the past proceedings of both,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣prietary's instructions to the Com∣missioners.</NOTE> and let me know, in what they have broken the bounds, or obligations of their charter.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That you, this very next Assem∣bly General, declare my abrogation of all that has been done since my absence; and so, of all the laws, but the fundamentals; and that you immediately dismiss the Assembly, and call it again; and pass such of them afresh, with such alterations, as you and they shall see meet; and this, to avoid a greater inconveniency, which I foresee, and formerly communicated to <HI>Thomas Lloyd.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, Inspect the qualifications of members in Council and Assembly; and see they be accor∣ding to charter; and especially of those, that have the administration of justice; and whatever you do, let the point of the laws be turned against impiety, and your severe brow upon all the trou∣blesome and vexatious, more especially, trifling, appeallers.</P>
<P>You shall shortly have a limitation from the King; though you have power, with the Council and Assembly, to fix the matter and manner of appeals, as much as to do any justice, or prevent any disorder, in the province, at all.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That till then, I have sent you a proclamation, to that effect, according to the powers of ordinance making, and declared in my letters patent, which you may expose, as you please.</P>
<P>Eighthly, Be most just, as in the sight of the <HI>all-seeing, all-searching</HI> God; and before you let your spirits into an affair, retire to him (who is not far away from every one of you; by whom kings reign, and princes decree justice) that he may give you a good understanding, and government of your selves, in the management thereof; which is

<HEAD>William Penn, Proprietor and Governor,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To Thomas Lloyd, Robert Turner, Nicholas Moore, James Olay∣poole and John Eckley,</HEAD>
<P>TRUSTY and well-beloved friends, I salute you all with sincere affection, desiring your temporal and eternal prosperity.</P>
<P>I have constituted you, or any three of you, Governor, and so are properly <HI>the Commissioners</HI> of the government; to act, as if I were present: And I hope is will conduce to your honor, and the peace and happiness of the people, under your care. I found my former deputation clogged with a long and slow tale of persons, rarely got together, and then with unwillingness, and sometimes reflections, even, upon me; for their pains of hearing one letter read;—That time may shew them they were out, in their censure, having then contracted their deputation into your hands.—Be diligent, faithful, loving, and communicate with one another, in things that concern the public; and I no ways doubt, but your breaches will heal, and your example have that effect, that nothing will be left for me to do, but thank and love you, and take pleasure in your comely order and those under you.</P>
<P>I beseech you draw not several ways, have no cabals apart, nor re∣serves from one another; treat, with a mutual simplicity, an entire con∣fidence in one another; and if, at any time, you mistake, or misapprehend, or dissent from one another; let not that appear to the people; shew your virtues but conceal your infirmities; this will wake you awful and re∣verent with the people. Justice, mercy, temperance of spirit, are high qualities, and necessary ones in government; I beseech God to sit you for his work more and more; by whom all Governors and people in au∣thority, ought to be influenced, in their administration of temporal things, committed to their care.</P>
<P>Three things occur to me eminently;—First, that you be watch∣ful that none abuse the King, in reference to his dues, &amp;c —Secondly, That you get the custom act revived, with the first; for I think that the equallest, and least offensive way, to support the government; for some∣thing must be done, in that affair, &amp;c. Thirdly, That you retrieve the dignity of courts and sessions; and remove all persons unqualified in morals or incapacity. Oh, that I could but have that, by your union, gravity, constant weekly meetings once or twice, as Second-days, and Fifth-days, in the morning or afternoon, to hear, advice, or do what is fit for the public good; that you had recovered the reputation which becomes that province to have;—For, what with that, which is real, and that malice in your neighbours of some governments invent, we have much ado to keep our heads above water here.</P>
<P>I shall add no more, but my love to the people, in general; and that so soon as my affairs will let me, I shall be with them: for no poor slave in Turkey, longs more for his freedom. I commit you to God's protec∣tion, and bid you heartily farewell.</P>

<PB N="309" REF="032729_0309_0FF4F2782D3C1FB8"/>
frequent access to the King brought him into suspi∣cion of being a disguised <HI>Jesuit,</HI> and under unjust censures and imputations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn suspected of being a dis∣guised Je∣suit.</NOTE> as if he had been an adviser, and contributed, to those arbitrary mea∣sures, which that impolitic King (James the se∣cond) pursued: Whereas his generous plan of liberty, so far as his power extended, and his otherwise well known principles of government, were as contrary to those of the King, as could possibly be, and his religion no less opposite.</P>
<P>Nevertheless he was not only infamously asper∣sed and abused, in print, on these accounts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and vilified in print, &amp;c.</NOTE> by divers illiberal and slanderous performances, pub∣lished against him, and some of them, even, in his own name, but also censured by some persons of good understanding and character; who, in divers respects were his friends, but not thoroughly knowing him, fell into the like suspicions: An instance of this appears in Dr. <HI>Tillotson,</HI> after∣wards <HI>Arch-bishop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> but, by means of a friendly epistolary correspondence between them, on the subject, in the year 1686, as appears in <HI>William Penn's</HI> life prefixed to his printed works, Dr. <HI>Tillotson</HI> was fully convinced of, and as freely acknowledged, his mistake.</P>
<P>But he continued still to distinguish himself in the cause of an impartial toleration, in religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's beneficent conduct in England.</NOTE> both in writing, and also by assiduous personal solicitations, at court, as a strenuous and un∣wearied advocate for that undoubted right of man∣kind; of which he, and his Friends, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> had, through the persecuting and bigoted spirit of those times, been long unjustly deprived. Hence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its conse∣quences in favour of religious li∣berty, &amp;c.</NOTE> in the fore part of this year, in consequence of the King's <HI>proclamation</HI> for a general pardon, <HI>"about thirteen hundred of these people, most of whom had
<PB N="310" REF="032729_0310_0FF4F279C5613A50"/>
been imprisoned divers years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1687.</NOTE> for their religion, were set at liberty:"</HI> And in April, the next following year, 1687, came forth the King's <HI>declaration</HI> for liberty of conscience, suspending the execution of all penal laws, in matters ecclesiastical.</P>
<P>For this temporary relief from cruel suffering, by the intolerant and unjust laws of those times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Qua∣kers justifi∣able in be∣ing grateful for this re∣lief, &amp;c.</NOTE> they who had endured most oppression and perse∣cution, undoubtedly had the greatest reason to be thankful: and whatever were the supposed views of the government thereby, in too much favour∣ing a <HI>Popish party,</HI> yet, for the <HI>Quakers</HI> to refuse, or reject the restitution of that natural right of mankind, and most undoubted privilege of <HI>English</HI> people, and all peaceable subjects, merely because it might be made an ill use of by others, and was not done in due form, would certainly have been the highest absurdity: and for those, who had suffered more deeply than all others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From their cruel suffer∣ings, &amp;c.</NOTE> not to ac∣knowledge and commend the redress of such a crying and intolerable grievance and affliction, as they had endured, in respect to themselves, so long and so laboriously solicited, by them, of the preceding King and Parliaments, <HI>in vain,</HI> would have shewed the greatest ingratitude and insensibi∣lity; more especially, as it was scarcely possible for them to be in a much worse condition, even, under a <HI>Popish hierarchy</HI> itself, than they had, for many years, endured, both under <HI>Cromwell,</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and their <HI>Parliaments,</HI> to this time, without being able to obtain redress any other way: Wherefore, at their next annual Assembly, held in <HI>London</HI> in the Third-month, this year, the

It were a great shame, then, for any <HI>Englishman</HI> (that professes <HI>Christianity</HI>) not to give God his due.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Honourable William Penn, Esquire, Pro∣prietor and Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE>THOUGH the friendship, with which you are pleased to honour me, doth afford me suffici∣ent opportunities of discoursing with you, upon any subject, yet I chose rather, at this time, to offer unto you, in writing, some reflections, which have occurred to my thoughts, in a matter of no common importance. The importance of it doth primarily and directly respect yourself, and your own private concernments; but it also consequen∣tially and effectually regards the King, his govern∣ment, and, even, the peace and settlement of this
<PB N="315" REF="032729_0315_0FF4F29A8C75B280"/>
whole nation. I intreat you, therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688.</NOTE> to bear with me, if I endeavour, in this manner, to give somewhat more weight unto my words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> than would be in a transient discourse, and leave them with you, as a subject, that requires your retired con∣sideration.</P>
<P>You are not ignorant, that the part you have been supposed to have had, of late years, in pub∣lic affairs, though without either the title, or honor, or profit, of any public office, and that especially your avowed endeavours to introduce amongst us a general and inviolable <HI>liberty of con∣science,</HI> in matters of mere religion, have occasi∣oned the mistakes of some men, provoked the malice of others, and, in the end, have raised against you a multitude of enemies; who have unworthily defamed you with such imputations, as, I am sure, you abhor. This I know you have been sufficiently informed of, though I doubt you have not made sufficient reflection upon it: The consciousness of your own innocence seems to me to have given you too great a contempt of such unjust and ill-grounded slanders. For however glorious it is, and reasonable, for a truly virtuous mind, whose inward peace is founded upon that rock of innocence, to despise the empty noise of popular reproach, yet, even, that sublimity of spirit may sometimes swell to a reprovable excess. To be steady and immovable, in the prosecution of wise and honest resolutions, by all honest and prudent means, is, indeed, a duty, that admits of no exception: But, nevertheless, it ought not to hinder that, at the same time, there be also due care taken of preserving a fair reputation. <HI>"A good name,</HI> says the wise man, <HI>is better than pre∣cious ointment."</HI> It is a perfume, that recommends the person, whom it accompanies, that procures him every where an easy acceptance; and that fa∣cilitates the success of all his enterprises: And for
<PB N="316" REF="032729_0316_0FF4F29C1A47C880"/>
that reason, though there were no other, I en∣treat you, observe, that the care of a man's repu∣tation is an essential part of that very same duty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> that engages him in the pursuit of any worthy design.</P>
<P>But I must not entertain you with a declama∣tion upon this general theme: my business is to represent to you, more particularly, those very imputations, which are cast upon yourself, toge∣ther with some of their evident consequences; that, if possible, I may thereby move you to la∣bour after a remedy. The source of all arises from the ordinary access, you have unto the King, the credit you are supposed to have with him, and the deep jealousy, that some people have conceived of his intentions, in reference to religion. Their jealousy is, that his aim has been to settle <HI>Popery</HI> in this nation, not only in a fair and secure liberty, but, even, in a predominating superiority over all other professions: And from thence the inference follows, that whosoever has any part in the coun∣cils of this reign, must needs be popishly affected: But that, to have so great a part in them, as you are said to have had, can happen to none, but an <HI>absolute Papist.</HI> That is the direct charge; but that is not enough; your part is too considerable for a Papist of an ordinary form; and, therefore, you must be a <HI>Jesuit:</HI> Nay, to confirm that sug∣gestion, it must be accompanied with all the cir∣cumstances, that may best give it an air of proba∣bility; as, that you have been bred at <HI>St. Omer's,</HI> in the <HI>Jesuit's college;</HI> that you have taken <HI>orders</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and there obtained a dispensation to mar∣ry; and that you have since then frequently offici∣ated, as a <HI>Priest,</HI> in the celebration of the <HI>mass,</HI> at <HI>White-Hall, St. James's,</HI> and other places. And this being admitted, nothing can be too black to be cast upon you. Whatsoever is thought amiss, either in church or state, though never so contrary to your advice, is boldly attributed to it; and, if
<PB N="317" REF="032729_0317_0FF4F29DAE70FE08"/>
other proofs fail, the Scripture itself must be brought in to confirm, "That whosoever offends, in one point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> (in a point especially so essential as that of our too much affected uniformity) is guilty of the breach of all our laws." Thus the charge of <HI>Popery</HI> draws after it a tail like the <HI>et caetera oath,</HI> and by endless innuendos prejudicates you, as guilty of whatsoever malice can invent, or folly believe: But that charge, therefore, being re∣moved, the inferences, that are drawn from it, will vanish, and your reputation will easily return to its former brightness.</P>
<P>Now, that I might the more effectually per∣swade you to apply some remedy to this disease, I beseech you, Sir, suffer me to lay before you some of its pernicious consequences. It is not a trifling matter, for a person, raised as you are, above the common level, to lie under the prejudice of so general a mistake, in so important a matter. The general, and the long prevalency of any opinion gives it a strength, especially among the vulgar, that is not easily shaken. And, as it happens that you have also enemies of an higher rank, who will be ready to improve such popular mistakes, by all arts of malicious artifices, it must be taken for granted that those errors will be there∣by still more confirmed, and the inconveniences, that may arise from thence, no less increased. This, Sir, I assure you, is a melancholy prospect to your friends; for we know you have such enemies. The design of so universal a liberty of conscience, as your principles have led you to pro∣mote, has offended many of those, whose interest is to cross it. I need not tell you how many, and how powerful they are; nor can I tell you either how far, or by what ways and means they may endeavour to execute their revenge. But this, however, I must needs tell you, that, in your present circumstances, there is sufficient ground
<PB N="318" REF="032729_0318_0FF4F29F41E32780"/>
for so much jealousy, at least, as ought to excite you to use the precaution of some public vindica∣tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> This the tenderness of friendship prompts your friends to desire of you; and this the just sense of your honor, which true religion does not extinguish, requires you to execute.</P>
<P>Pardon, I entreat you, Sir, the earnestness of these expressions; nay, suffer me, without of∣fence, to expostulate with you yet a little farther. I am fearful lest these personal considerations should not have their due weight with you, and therefore, I cannot omit to reflect also upon some more general consequences of your particular re∣proach. I have said it already, that the King, his honour, his government, and, even, the peace and settlement of this whole nation, either are, or have been, concerned in this matter: Your reputation, as you are said to have meddled in public affairs, have been of public concernment. The promoting a general liberty of conscience having been your particular province; the asper∣sion of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Jesuitism,</HI> that has been cast upon <HI>you,</HI> has reflected upon his <HI>Majesty,</HI> for having made use, in that affair, of so disguised a personage as you are supposed to have been. It has weakened the force of all your endeavours, obstructed their effect, and contributed greatly to disappoint this poor nation of that inestimable hap∣piness, and secure establishment, which, I am per∣swaded, you designed, and which all good and wise men agree, that a just and inviolable liberty of conscience would infallibly produce. I heartily wish this consideration had been sooner laid to heart, and that some demonstrative evidence of your sincerity, in the profession you make, had accompanied all your endeavours for liberty.</P>
<P>But, what do I say, or what do I wish for? I confess that I am now struck with astonishment at that abundant evidence, which I know you have
<PB N="319" REF="032729_0319_0FF4F2ABDC1B4448"/>
constantly given, of the opposition of your prin∣ciples to those of the <HI>Romish</HI> church, and at the little regard, there has been had to it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> If an open profession of the directest opposition against <HI>Popery,</HI> that has ever appeared in the world, since <HI>Popery</HI> was first distinguished from <HI>common Christia∣nity,</HI> would serve the turn, this cannot be denied to all those of that <HI>society,</HI> with which you are joined in the duties of religious worship. If to have maintained the principles of that society, by frequent and fervent discourses, by many elaborate writings, by suffering ignominy, imprisonment, and other manyfold disadvantages, in defence there∣of, can be admitted as any proof of your sincere adherence thereunto; this, it is evident to the world, you have done already: Nay, farther, if to have enquired as far as was possible for you, into the particular stories, that have been framed against you, and to have sought all means of recti∣fying the mistakes, upon which they were ground∣ed, could, in any measure avail to the settling a true character of you, in men's judgments; this also I know you have done. For I have seen, un∣der the hand of a reverend Dean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tillotson.</NOTE> of our <HI>English</HI> church, a full acknowledgment of satisfaction, re∣ceived from you, in a suspicion he had entertained, upon one of those stories, and to which his re∣port had procured too great credit. And though I know you are averse to the publishing of his let∣ter, without his express leave, and, perhaps, may not now think fit to ask it; yet I am so thoroughly assured of his sincerity and candour, that I cannot doubt, but he has already vindicated you, in that matter, and will, (according to his promise) be still ready to do it, upon all occasions. Nay, I have seen also your justification from another ca∣lumny of common fame, about your having kid∣napped one, who had been formerly a <HI>Monk,</HI> out of your <HI>American</HI> province, to deliver him here into the hands of his enemies; I say I have seen
<PB N="320" REF="032729_0320_0FF4F2AD6B7198E8"/>
your justification from that story, under that per∣son's own hand: and his return to <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> where he now resides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> may be an irrefragable con∣futation of it, to any that will take the pains to enquire thereinto.</P>
<P>Really, it afflicts me very much, to consider that all this does not suffice. If I had not that particular respect for you, which I sincerely pro∣fess, yet I could not but be much affected, that any man, who had deservedly acquired so fair a reputation, as you have formerly had, whose in∣tegrity and veracity had always been reputed spotless, and whose charity had been continually exercised in serving others, at the dear expence of his time, his strength and his estate, without any other recompence than what results from the con∣sciousness of doing good; I say, I could not but be much affected, to see any such person fall inno∣cently and undeservedly under such unjust re∣proaches, as you have done. It is an hard case; and I think, no man, that has any bowels of hu∣manity, can reflect upon it, without great relent∣ings.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, it is so, and that something remains yet to be done, something more express, and especially more public, than has yet been done, for your vindication, I beg of you, dear Sir, by all the tender efficacy, that friendship, either mine, or that of your friends and relations together can have upon you, by the due regard, which huma∣nity, and, even, Christianity, obliges you to have to your reputation; by the duty, you owe unto the King, by your love to the land of your nati∣vity; and by the cause of universal religion and eternal truth, let not the scandal of insincerity, that I have hinted at, lie any longer upon you; but let the sense of all these obligations perswade you to gratify your friends and relations, and to serve your King, your country and your religion,
<PB N="321" REF="032729_0321_0FF4F2AF05B31F28"/>
by such a public vindication of your honour, as your own prudence, upon these suggestions, will now shew you to be most necessary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Popple to W. Penn.</NOTE> and most ex∣pedient. I am, with unfeigned, and most respect∣ful affection,</P>

<P>The following is <HI>William Penn</HI>'s answer to the pre∣ceding letter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now above twenty years, I thank God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> that I have not been very solicitous what the world thought of me. For since I have had the know∣ledge of religion, from a <HI>principle</HI> in <HI>myself,</HI> the first and main point with me has been, to approve myself in the sight of God, through patience and well-doing: So that the world has not had weight enough with me, to suffer its good opinion to raise me, or its ill opinion to deject me. And, if that had been the only motive, or consideration, and not the desire of a good friend, in the name of many others, I had been as silent to thy letter, as I use to be to the idle and malicious shams of the times: But, as the laws of friendship are sacred, with those that value that relation, so I confess this to be a principal one with me, not to deny a friend the satisfaction he desires, when it may be done without offence to a good conscience.</P>
<P>The business chiefly insisted upon is my <HI>Popery,</HI> and endeavours to promote it. I do say, then, and that with all sincerity, that I am not only no <HI>Jesuit,</HI> but no <HI>Papist.</HI> And, which is more, I never had any temptation upon me to be it, either from doubts, in my own mind, about the way I
<PB N="322" REF="032729_0322_0FF4F31997258D68"/>
profess, or from the discourses, or writings of any of that religion. And, in the presence of Al∣mighty God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> I do declare, that the King did never once, directly or indirectly attack me, or tempt me, upon that subject, the many years, that I have had the advantage of a free access to him; so unjust, as well as sordidly false, are all those stories of the town.</P>
<P>The only reason, that I can apprehend, they have to repute me a <HI>Roman Catholic,</HI> is my frequent going to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> a place no more forbid to me, than to the rest of the world, who yet, it seems, find much fairer quarter. I have almost continually had one business or other there for our Friends, whom I ever served with a steady solicitation, through all times, since I was of their communion. I had also a great many per∣sonal good offices to do, upon a principle of cha∣rity, for people of all perswasions; thinking it a duty to improve the little interest I had, for the good of those, that needed it, especially the poor. I might add something of my own affairs too; though I must own (if I may without vanity) that they have ever had the least share of my thoughts, or pains, or else they would not have still depended as they yet do.</P>
<P>But because some people are so unjust, as to render instances for my <HI>Popery</HI> (or, rather hypo∣crisy, for so it would be in me) it is fit I contradict them as particularly as they accuse me. I say, then, solemnly, that I am so far from having been bred at <HI>St. Omer's,</HI> and having received orders at <HI>Rome,</HI> that I never was at either place, nor do I know any body there; nor had I ever a correspon∣dency with any body, in those places; which is another story invented against me. And, as for my officiating in the King's chapel, or any other, it is so ridiculous, as well as untrue, that besides that no body can do it, but a <HI>Priest,</HI> and that I
<PB N="323" REF="032729_0323_0FF4F2B09414F9D8"/>
have been married to a woman of some condition, above sixteen years, which no Priest can be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> by any dispensation whatever; I have not so much as looked into <HI>any</HI> chapel of the <HI>Roman</HI> religion, and consequently not the King's, though common cu∣riosity warrants it daily to people of all perswa∣sions.</P>
<P>And, once for all, I do say, that I am a <HI>Pro∣testant dissenter,</HI> and to that degree such, that I challenge the most celebrated Protestant of the <HI>English</HI> church, or any other, on that head, be he Layman, or Clergyman, in public, or in private. For I would have such people know, it is not im∣possible for a <HI>true Protestant dissenter</HI> to be dutiful, thankful and serviceable to the <HI>King,</HI> though he be of the <HI>Roman catholic communion.</HI> We hold not our property, or protection, from him, by our perswasion; and, therefore, his perswasion should not be the measure of our allegiance. I am sorry to see so many, that seem fond of the reformed religion, by their disaffection to him, recommend it so ill. Whatever practices of <HI>Roman catholics</HI> we might reasonably object against (and no doubt but such there are) yet he has disclaimed and repre∣hended those ill things, by his declared opinion against <HI>persecution,</HI> by the ease, in which he actu∣ally indulges all dissenters; and by the confirmation, he offers in Parliament, for the security of the Protestant religion, and liberty of conscience. And, in his honour, as well as in my own defence, I am obliged, in conscience, to say, that he has ever declared to me, <HI>it was his opinion;</HI> and on all oc∣casions, when Duke, he never refused me the repeated proofs of it, as often as I had any poor sufferers for conscience sake to solicit his help for.</P>
<P>But some may be apt to say, "Why not any body else as well as I? Why must I have the pre∣ferable access to other dissenters, if not a <HI>Papist?"</HI> I answer, I know not that it is so. But this I know,
<PB N="324" REF="032729_0324_0FF4F2BD90CD1DF0"/>
that I have made it my province and business; I have followed and pressed it; I took it for my cal∣ling and station,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> and have kept it above these six∣teen years; and, which is more (if I may say it without vanity or reproach) wholly at my own charges too. To this let me add the relation, that my father had to this King's service; his particular favour, in getting me released out of the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in 1669; my father's humble request to him, upon his death bed, to protect me from the inconveniencies and troubles, my perswasion might expose me to, and his friendly promise to do it, and exact performance of it, from the moment, I addressed myself to him:—I say, when all this is considered, any body, that has the least pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to good nature, gratitude, or generosity, must needs know how to interpret my access to the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps, some will be ready to say, "This is not all, nor is this yet a fault, but, that I have been an adviser in other matters, disgustful to the kingdom, and which tend to the overthrow of the Protestant religion, and the liberties of the peo∣ple."—A likely thing, indeed, that a Protestant dissenter, who, from fifteen years old, has been, at times, a sufferer, in his father's family, in the university, and by the government, for being so, should design the <HI>destruction</HI> of the Protestant re∣ligion! This is just as probable, as it is true, that I died a <HI>Jesuit</HI> six years ago, in <HI>America.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See page 246.</NOTE> Will men still suffer such stuff to pass upon them? Is any thing more foolish, as well as false, than that, because I am often at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> therefore I must be the author of all, that is done there, which does not please abroad? But, supposing some such things to have been done, pray tell me, if I am bound to oppose any thing, that I am not called to do? I never was a member of council, cabinet, or committee, where the affairs of the kingdom
<PB N="325" REF="032729_0325_0FF4F2BF1F2C6860"/>
are transacted. I have had no office, or trust, and consequently nothing can be said to be done by me; nor, for that reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> could I lie under any test, or obligation to discover my opinion of public acts of state; and therefore neither can any such acts, nor my silence about them, in justice, be made my crime. Volunteers are blanks and cyphers, in all governments. And unless calling at <HI>White-Hall</HI> once a day, upon many occasions, or my not being turned out of nothing (for that no office is) be the evidence of my compliance in disagreeable things, I know not what else can, with any truth, be alledged against me. However, one thing I know, that I have every where most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gious<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y observed, and endeavoured, in con∣versation, with persons of all ranks and opinions, to allay heats, and moderate extremes, even, in the politics. It is below me to be more particular; but, I am sure, it has been my endeavour, that, if we could not all meet upon a religious bottom, at least, we might upon a civil one, the good of <HI>England;</HI> which is the common interest of King and people: That he might be great by justice, and we free by obedience, distinguishing rightly, on the one hand, between duty and slavery; and on the other, between liberty and licentiousness.</P>
<P>But, alas, I am not without my apprehen∣sions of the cause of this behaviour towards me, and in this, I perceive, we agree; I mean my constant zeal for an <HI>impartial</HI> liberty of conscience. But, if that be it, the cause is too good to be in pain about. I ever understood that to be the na∣tural right of all men; and that he that had a re∣ligion without it, his religion was none of his own. For what is not the religion of a man's <HI>choice,</HI> is the religion of him that imposes it: So that liberty of conscience is the first step to have a religion. This is no new opinion with me. I have writ many apologies, within the last twenty years, to
<PB N="326" REF="032729_0326_0FF4F2C0B26E7238"/>
defend it, and that impartially. Yet I have as constantly declared, that bounds ought to be set to this freedom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> and that morality was the <HI>best;</HI> and that as often as that was violated, under a pre∣sence of conscience, it was fit the civil power should take place. Nor did I ever once think of promoting any sort of liberty of conscience, for any body which did not preserve the <HI>common pro∣testancy</HI> of the kingdom, and the <HI>ancient rights</HI> of the government. For, to say truth, the one cannot be maintained without the other.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I must say, <HI>I love England;</HI> I ever did so; and that I am not in her debt▪ I never valued time, money, or kindred, to serve her and do her good. No party could ever biass me to her prejudice, nor any personal interest oblige me in her wrong. For I always abhorred discounting <HI>private favours</HI> at the <HI>public cost.</HI></P>
<P>Would I have made my market of the fears and jealousies of the people, when this King came to the crown, I had put twenty thousand pounds into my pocket, and an hundred thousand into my province; for mighty numbers of people were then upon the wing: But I waved it all; hoped for better times; expected the effects of the King's word, for liberty of conscience, and happiness by it: And till I saw my friends, with the kingdom, delivered from the legal bondage, which penal laws, for religion, had subjected them to, I could, with no satisfaction, think of leaving <HI>England;</HI> though much to my prejudice beyond sea; and at my great expence here; having, in all this time never had either office or pension, and always re∣fusing the rewards, or gratuities, of those, I have been able to oblige.</P>
<P>If, therefore, an <HI>universal charity,</HI> if the as∣serting an <HI>impartial liberty of conscience,</HI> if <HI>doing to others as one would be done by,</HI> and an <HI>open avowing,</HI>
<PB N="327" REF="032729_0327_0FF4F2C2534E5260"/>
and steady <HI>practising of these things,</HI> in all times, to all parties, will justly lay a man under the re∣flection of being a <HI>Jesuit,</HI> or a <HI>Papist,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> of any rank, I must not only submit to the character, but embrace it too; and I care not who knows that I can wear it with more pleasure, than it is possible for them, with any justice, to give it me. For these are corner-stones and principles with me; and I am scandalized at all buildings, that have them not for their foundations. For religion itself is an empty name without them, a whited wall, a painted sepulchre, no <HI>life</HI> or <HI>virtue</HI> to the soul; no good, or example, to one's neighbour. Let us not flatter ourselves, "We can never be the better for our religion, if our neighbour be the worse for it." Our fault is, we are apt to be mighty hot upon speculative errors, and break all bounds, in our resentments; but we let practical ones pass without remark, if not without repen∣tance: As if a mistake about an <HI>obscure proposition of faith,</HI> were a greater evil, than the breach of an undoubted precept. Such a religion the devils themselves are not without; for they have both faith and knowledge; but their faith doth not work by love, nor their knowledge by obedience. And, if this be their judgment, can it be our blessing? Let us not think religion a litigious thing; nor that Christ came only to make us good dispu∣tants; but, that he came also to make us good livers. Sincerity goes farther than capacity. It is <HI>charity,</HI> that deservedly excels, in the Christian religion; and happy would it be, if, where unity ends, charity did begin, instead of envy and rail∣ing, that almost ever follow. It appears to me to be the way, that God has found out and appoin∣ted, to moderate our differences, and make them, at least, harmless to society; and, therefore, I confess, I dare not aggravate them to wrath and blood. Our disagreement lies in our <HI>apprehension,</HI>
<PB N="328" REF="032729_0328_0FF4F31B273D4DA8"/>
or <HI>belief</HI> of things; and if the common enemy of mankind had not the governing of our affections and passions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> that disagreement would not prove such a canker, as it is, to love and peace, in civil societies.</P>
<P>He that suffers his difference with his neigh∣bour, about the other world, to carry him beyond the line of moderation, in this, is the worse for his <HI>opinion,</HI> even, though it be true. It is too little considered by <HI>Christians,</HI> that men may hold the <HI>truth</HI> in <HI>unrighteousness;</HI> that they may be <HI>ortho∣dox,</HI> and not know what <HI>spirit they are of:</HI> So were the Apostles of our Lord; they believed in him, yet let a false <HI>zeal</HI> do violence to their judg∣ment, and their unwarrantable <HI>heat</HI> contradict the great end of their Saviour's coming, <HI>love.</HI></P>
<P>Men may be angry for God's sake, and kill people too. Christ said it, and too many have practised it. But what sort of Christians must they be, I pray, that can <HI>hate</HI> in his name, who bids us <HI>love;</HI> and <HI>kill</HI> for his sake, that forbids <HI>killing,</HI> and commands <HI>love,</HI> even, to enemies.</P>
<P>Let not men, or parties, think to shift it off from themselves. It is not this <HI>principle,</HI> or that <HI>form,</HI> to which so great a defection is owing, but a degeneracy of mind from God. Christianity is not at <HI>heart.</HI> No fear of God in the inward parts: No awe of his divine omnipresence. <HI>Self</HI> prevails, and breaks out, more or less, through all forms, but too plainly; (pride, wrath, lust, avarice) so that though people say to God, <HI>Thy will be done;</HI> which shews them to be true heathens, under a mask of Christianity, that believe without works, and repent without forsaking; busy for <HI>forms,</HI> and the temporal benefits of them, while <HI>true religion,</HI> which is, <HI>To visit the fatherless and the widow, and to keep ourselves unspotted from the world,</HI> goes bare∣foot, and, like <HI>Lazarus,</HI> is despised. Yet this was the definition the Holy Ghost gave of religion,
<PB N="329" REF="032729_0329_0FF4F2CEE06F1DA8"/>
before <HI>Synods</HI> and <HI>Councils</HI> had the meddling with it, and modelling of it. In those days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> bowels were a good part of religion, and that to the fa∣therless and widow, at <HI>large.</HI> We can hardly now extend them to those of our own way. It was said by him, that could not say amiss, <HI>Because iniquity abounds, the love of many waxeth cold.</HI> Whatsoever divides man's heart from <HI>God,</HI> sepa∣rates it from his <HI>neighbour;</HI> and he, that loves <HI>self</HI> more than <HI>God,</HI> can never love his <HI>neighbour</HI> as himself. For, as the Apostle said, "If we do not love him, whom we have seen, how can we love God, whom we have not seen?"</P>
<P>O, that we could see some men as eager to turn people to <HI>God,</HI> as they are to blow them up, and set them one against another. But, indeed, those only can have that pure and pious zeal, who are themselves turned to God, and have tasted the sweetness of that conversion, which is to <HI>power,</HI> not <HI>form;</HI> to <HI>godliness,</HI> not <HI>gain.</HI> Such as those do bend their thoughts and pains to appease, not increase, heats and animosities; to exhort people to look at home, sweep their own houses, and weed their own gardens. And, in no age, or time, was there more need to set men at work, in their own hearts, than this we live in, when so busy, wandering, licentious a spirit prevails. For what∣ever some men may think, "The disease of this kingdom is <HI>sin;</HI> impiety against <HI>God,</HI> and want of <HI>charity</HI> to men." And while this guilt is at our door, judgment cannot be far off.</P>
<P>Now, this being the disease, I will briefly offer two things, for the cure of it.</P>
<P>The first is <HI>David's clean heart,</HI> and <HI>right spirit,</HI> which he asked and had of God: without this we must be a <HI>chaos</HI> still. For the distemper is <HI>within;</HI> and our Lord said, <HI>All evil</HI> comes from thence. Set the <HI>inward man right,</HI> and the <HI>out∣ward
<PB N="330" REF="032729_0330_0FF4F31CBAD5C098"/>
man cannot be wrong:</HI> That is the helm, that governs the human vessel: And this nothing can do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. People.</NOTE> but an <HI>inward principle,</HI> the <HI>light</HI> and <HI>grace,</HI> that came by Christ; which the scripture tells us, <HI>enlightens every one, and hath appeared to all men."</HI> It is preposterous to think, that <HI>He,</HI> who made the world, should shew least care of the best part of it, our <HI>souls.</HI> No, he, that gave us an outward luminary, for our bodies, hath given us an in∣ward one, for our minds, to act by. We have it; and it is our condemnation, that we do not love it, and bring our deeds to it. It is by this we see our sins, are made sensible of them, sorry for them, and finally forsake them. And he, that thinks to go to Heaven a nearer way, will, I fear, belate his soul, and be irreparably mistaken. There are but <HI>goats</HI> and <HI>sheep,</HI> at last, whatever shapes we wear here. Let us not, therefore, dear friend, deceive ourselves. Our souls are at stake: "God will not be mocked; what we sow we must expect to reap. There is no repentance in the grave;" which shews, that, if none there, then no where else. To sum up this divinity of mine; it is the <HI>light</HI> of <HI>Jesus,</HI> in our souls, that gives us a true sight of ourselves, and that sight that leads us to repentance; which repentance begets humi∣lity, and humility, that true <HI>charity,</HI> that covers a multitude of faults; which I call God's <HI>expedi∣ent</HI> against man's <HI>infirmity.</HI></P>
<P>The second remedy to our present distemper, is this; since all, of all parties, profess to believe in God, Christ, the Spirit, and Scripture; that the soul is immortal, that there are eternal rewards and pu∣nishments; and that the virtuous shall receive the one, and the wicked suffer the other; I say, since this is the common faith of Christendom, let us all resolve, in the strength of God, to live up to what we agree in, before we fall out so miserably, about the rest, in which we differ. I am perswa∣ded
<PB N="331" REF="032729_0331_0FF4F2D06F407F20"/>
the change and comfort, which that pious course would bring us to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's answer to W. Popple.</NOTE> would go very far to dispose our natures to compound easily for all the rest; and we might hope yet to see happy days, in poor <HI>England;</HI> for there I would have so good a work begun. And how it is possible for the eminent men of every religious perswasion (espe∣cially the present <HI>ministers</HI> of the <HI>parishes</HI> of <HI>En∣gland)</HI> to think of giving an account to God, at the last day, without using the utmost of their en∣deavours to <HI>moderate</HI> the members of their respec∣tive communions towards those, that differ from them, is a mystery to me! But this I know, and must lay it at their doors, I charge also my own soul with it, "God requires <HI>moderation</HI> and <HI>humi∣lity</HI> from us;" for he is at hand, who will not spare to judge our <HI>impatience,</HI> if we have no pati∣ence for one another. The eternal God rebuke, I beseech him, the wrath of man, and humble all under the sense of the evil of this day; and yet, unworthy as we are, give us <HI>peace,</HI> for his holy Name's sake!</P>
<P>It is now time to end this letter; and I will do it without saying any more than this: Thou seest my defence against popular calumny; thou seest what my thoughts are, of our condition, and the way to better it; and thou seest my hearty and humble prayer to Almighty God, to incline us to be wise, if it were but for our own sakes. I shall only add, that I am extremely sensible of the kindness and justice, intended me by my friends, on this occasion, and that I am, for that, and ma∣ny more reasons,</P>

friends in the province,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>On this and some other things the Proprietor writ to the Commissi∣oners in the following manner, dated the 27th. of the Tenth-month, 1687, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LETTER>
<HEAD>William Penn, Proprietor and Governor,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To my truly and well-beloved friends, Thomas Lloyd, Robert Turner, John Eckle, John Simcock and Arthur Cook, commissioners of state, for the province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> or any three of them:—</HEAD>
<P>I salute you all with unfeigned love, and, in Christ Jesus, wish you health and happiness.—</P>
<P>My last is by the same hand, this being sent to the <HI>Downs</HI> after him, upon the receipt of Thomas Lloyd's and William Markham's letter: But I am heartily sorry that I had no letter from the government: in∣deed I have hardly had one at all: and for private letters though from public persons, I regard them but little; I mean as to taking my public measures by: for I find such contradictions, as well as diversity, that I believe, I may say, I am one of the unhappiest Proprietaries, with one of the best people. If this had not been complained of in mine by Ed∣ward Blacksan, I should have been less moved at this visible incompla∣cency and neglect.—Had the government signed, I mean those, who are the most eminent in authority, by consent of the rest, it had given me some case and satisfaction; but, as it is, 'tis controversy rather than government, which stands and lives and prospers in unity, at least of the governing part, whatever be their affections; for men may agree in duty, that dis∣like one another's natural tempers.—I shall henceforth, therefore, ex∣pect letters from the government, recounting the affairs of it, that they may be authoritative to me; and as many private ones as you please be∣sides; for that I also, rejoice in, and any particular advice, that may in∣form me, as to the public, or remedy what may be amiss, or meliorate what is, in itself, well, will also be very acceptable to me.</P>
<P>Now I have said this, I cannot but condole the loss of some stand∣ards, in the province, honest men, and of good understandings, in their kind. The Lord avert his judgments, and constrain all, by his visita∣tions, to amend, be it in conversation, or be it in peace, concord and charity; they that live near to God, will live far from themselves; and from the sense they have of his nearness and majesty, have a low opinion of themselves; and out of that low and humble frame of spirit it is, that true charity grows; the most excellent way;—Ah! what shall I say, there can be no union, no comfortable society without it: Oh, that the people of my province, and parts annexed; felt this gracious quality abounding in them, my work would be done, and their praise and my joy unspeakably abound to us; wherefore, in the name and fear of God, let all old sores be forgotten, as well as forgiven: shut out the remem∣brance of them, and preach this doctrine to the people, in my name, yea, in the king's name, and his that is greater above all, <HI>viz.</HI> God Al∣mighty's name.</P>
<P>I am sorry that <HI>Thomas Lloyd,</HI> my esteemed friend, covets a <HI>Quie∣tus,</HI> that is young, active and ingenious; for from such it is, that I ex∣pect help; and such will not low, I hope, in vain; but since 'tis his de∣sire, I do hereby signify his <HI>dismiss</HI> from the trouble he has borne, (for some time of rest and ease, at least) and do nominate, to be commissi∣onated in my name, under the great seal, till further order, <HI>Samuel Car∣penter,</HI> who, I hope will accept, and industriously serve that station, else <HI>Thomas Ellis;</HI> who has an office, that requires his attendance, having one in my eye, that may see you shortly, as a man richly qualified for that station: <HI>Robert Turner,</HI> of course has the Chair, for the first month after the receipt of this, and the rest alternately, monthly, if you find that convenient, as, I believe, it will be most easy, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se let the senior com∣missioner have it always.</P>
<P>I have only to recommend to you, the due execution of the divers good laws, among you, impartially and diligently, not neglecting the order, from hence sent, especially for peace and concord.—Government is not to make, but to do and dispatch business; in which few words, and a quiet, but a brisk execution does best; wherefore consider well what is just and fit, the one in law, the other in prudence (where you have room to use it) pursue in all cases; and no matter what any say, or object.</P>
<P>I writ to you about my <HI>Quit-rents:</HI> I am forced to pay bills here, to support my family there, while I have 4 or 500 pounds per annum in <HI>Quit-rents</HI> there; you may remember the votes of Council, to pay my charges in this expedition: I could draw a large bill upon the provincial council, in that respect; I am sure I need it, but have forebore; though it is none of the endearingest considerations, that I have not had the present of a skin, or a pound of tobacco since I came over: though they are like to have the most advantage by it, and promised me so much!—</P>
<P>Pray, prevent people's withdrawing from us, what you can; they cannot mend themselves; and they that go will find it so, in a while; for I believe, <HI>God has blessed that poor place;</HI> and the reason of my stay here, and the service I am, and have been of, to the conscientious, shall be rewarded on my solitary province.—Remember me to the people, and let them know, my heart's desire towards them; and shall embrace the first opportunity to make my abode with them.</P>
<P>Once more, let me hear from you, and have a copy of the laws, as my other letter directs, and you shall soon hear from me to your con∣tent; so I bid you heartily farewell.</P>

<P>"Now, though I have, to please thee, given thee a <HI>quietus</HI> from all public business, my inten∣tion is to constitute thee Deputy Governour, and two, in the character of assistants; either of whom and thyself, to be able to do all as fully as I my self can do; only I wait thy consent to the em∣ployment;

<P>Notwithstanding the strict friendship, and good disposition, which, from the beginning, had been wisely cultivated and established by the Proprietary and inhabitants, or first settlers, of the province, with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and, afterwards pursued in such manner, as to leave no reasonable cause for fears and suspicions between them; yet, as in all coun∣tries wickedly disposed persons are found, whose delight is, if possible, to disturb the public tran∣quillity; so we find, in the infancy of this colony, when justice, peace and harmony so universally predominated, it was possible, nevertheless, for idle reports, and vain rumours to take place, and gain so far on unguarded minds, as to create very alarming apprehensions, respecting the <HI>Indians;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of an In∣dian alarm.</NOTE>— the consideration of their large numbers, at that time, in proportion to the fewness of the <HI>European</HI> settlers, rather favouring such apprehensions; of which we have the following instance.</P>
<P>In, or about, the year 1688, the inhabitants of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and places adjacent, were alarmed
<PB N="336" REF="032729_0336_0FF4F32F1C7C34B0"/>
with the report of an intended insurrection of the <HI>Indians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Indian alarm, &amp;c.</NOTE> to cut off all the <HI>English,</HI> on a certain appointed day. This was communicated by two <HI>Indian</HI> women of <HI>West-Jersey,</HI> to an old <HI>Dutch</HI> in∣habitant, near <HI>Chester,</HI> to be on the next fourth day of the week. Several <HI>Friends</HI> or <HI>Quakers,</HI> upon hearing this report, being conscious of their just conduct towards the <HI>Indians,</HI> and sensible of nothing that could reasonably disgust them, endea∣voured to appease the people's fears. The said fourth day being come, about ten o'clock, in the night, a messenger arrived at <HI>Chester,</HI> out of the woods, and told the people, that three families, about nine miles distant, which he named, were all cut off by the <HI>Indians.</HI>—This report coming to a <HI>Friend,</HI> then at <HI>Chester,</HI> about midnight he took with him two young men, on horseback, to the place, in order to examine into the truth of the affair.—They found the three houses, but no body in them, and yet no signs of murder;—their inha∣bitants, alarmed in a similar manner, had fled to the houses of their parents, at <HI>Ridley</HI> creek, about a mile from thence. The master of one of these families, being from home, had been informed five hundred <HI>Indians</HI> were actually collected at <HI>Naaman's</HI> creek, in pursuit of their design, to kill the <HI>English;</HI> and as he was hastening to his house, he thought he heard his boy crying out, and saying, <HI>"What shall I do, my Dame is killed!</HI> Upon which, instead of going home, to know the certainty of the affair, he ran off, to acquaint the government, at <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> but being met by a person of more prudence than himself, before he got to the city, he was perswaded by him to return.—</P>
<P>The report notwithstanding soon arrived at the city; and was told with such alarming circum∣stances, that a messenger was immediately dis∣patched to <HI>Marcus Hook,</HI> near the said <HI>Naaman's</HI> creek to enquire the truth of it. He quickly re∣turned
<PB N="337" REF="032729_0337_0FF4F2E276B474A0"/>
and confirmed the report, but with this variation; that it was at <HI>Brandywine</HI> creek,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Indian alarm, &amp;c.</NOTE> at an <HI>Indian</HI> town, where the five hundred <HI>Indians</HI> were assembled; and, that they, having a lame king, had carried him away, with all their women and children. These circumstances rendered the affair still more alarming, and, with many, amounted to a certainty.</P>
<P>The Council were, at that time, sitting at <HI>Phi∣ladelphia</HI> on other affairs, when one of them, a <HI>Friend,</HI> supposed to be <HI>Caleb Pusey,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b Pusey</HI> came from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> with his family, in 1682; and from that time till his death, near 45 years, was a very use∣ful and valuable member of society, both religious and civil. He was long one of the Provincial and Governor's council; and divers times in the Assembly:—He is said to have been a man of good example, both in public and private life; and est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>med a wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Elder among his friends the <HI>Quakers.</HI>—By his care, part of the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rials, from which this his∣tory of Pennsylvania is composed, were preserved;—being a man of good understanding and abilities, in divers respects; and in the relation of a neighbour, husband, parent, master and friend, had particularly an amiable character. He lived in <HI>Chester</HI> county; and died in the Twelfth month, 1725, in the 76th. year of his age.</NOTE> who lived in <HI>Chester</HI> county, voluntarily offered himself to go to the place, provided they would name five others to accompany him, without weapons; which being soon agreed on, they rode to the place; but, in∣stead of meeting with five hundred warriors, they found the <HI>old king</HI> quietly lying, with his lame foot along on the ground, and his head, at ease, on a kind of pillow, the women at work, in the field, and the children playing together.—</P>
<P>When they had entered the <HI>wigwam,</HI> the king presently asked them very mildly, <HI>"What they all came for?"</HI> They told him the report, which the <HI>Indian</HI> women had raised; and asked him, whether the <HI>Indians</HI> had any thing against the <HI>English?</HI> He appeared much displeased at the report and said, "The women ought to be burnt to death; and that they had nothing against the <HI>English;"</HI>—ad∣ding, "'Tis true there are about fifteen pounds yet

<P>One of the company further expressed himself to the <HI>Indian</HI> king, in the following manner; "That the great God, who made the world, and all things therein, consequently made all mankind, both Indians and English; and as he made all, so his love was extended to all; which, was plainly shewn, by his causing the <HI>rain</HI> and <HI>dews</HI> to fall on the ground of both <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English</HI> alike; that it might equally produce what the <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as what the <HI>English</HI> sowed or planted in it, for the sustenance of life; and also by his making the sun to shine equally on all, both <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> to nourish them; and that seeing the great <HI>Being,</HI> which made them all, extended his love thus to all, so they were mutually bound to love one another."—</P>
<P>The king answered, "What they had said was true; and as God has given you corn, I would ad∣vise you to get it in; (it being then harvest time) for we intend you no harm."—They parted ami∣cably; and the messengers, returning, put an end to the people's fears.</P>

<HEAD><HI>(L. S.)</HI> Instructions for Lieutenant Governor <HI>Blackwell,</HI> or whom else they may concern.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THAT things be transacted in my name, by the style of my patent only, viz. <HI>Absolute Proprietary of Pennsylvania, &amp;c.</HI> if not con∣trary to the charter and laws of the Province, as I suppose not.</P>
<P N="2">II. That commissions signed and sealed by me here shall be sufficient warrants and directions to pass them under the great seal.</P>

<P N="4">IV. To be careful that speedy, as well as thorough and impartial justice be done; and virtue, in all, cherished, and vice, in all, punished.</P>
<P N="5">V. That fines be in proportion, both to the fault and ability of the party, that so they may be paid.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That feuds between perswasions, or nations, or countries, be suppressed and extinguished, if any be; and, if none, that by a good conduct, they may be prevented.</P>
<P N="7">VII. That the widow, orphan, and absent may be particularly re∣garded, in their rights; for their cry will be loudest in all ears; but, by absent, I mean such as are so of necessity.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. To countenance the Commissioners of property, where land is unseated, or people are unruly in their settlements, or comply not with reasonable obligations, about bounds, banks, timber, &amp;c. For though we come to a wilderness, it was not that we should continue it so.</P>
<P N="9">IX. That the Sheriffs of their respective counties be charged with the receipt of my rents, fines, &amp;c. as they do in <HI>England,</HI> and give se∣curity to the Receiver General, for the same,</P>
<P N="10">X. To have a special care, that Sheriffs and clerks of the peace im∣pose not upon the people; and that the magistrates live peaceably and soberly;—for I could not endure one loose, or litigious person in autho∣rity.—Let them be men having some fear of God, and hating covet∣ousness, whatever be their perswasion: to employ others is to profane an ordinance of God.</P>
<P N="11">XI. That care be taken of the roads, and high-ways, in the coun∣try; that they may be straight and commodious for travellers; for I un∣derstand, they are turned about by the planters; which is a mischief, that must not be endured.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Consider by what means, or methods, the good and prosperity of the plantation may be promoted; what laws, in being, are unneces∣sary, or defective, and what are wanting; and in each particular hereof, let me have advice as distinctly, and as speedily as may be.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Rule the meek meekly; and those that will not be ruled, rule with authority; and God Almighty prosper all honest and prudent en∣deavours.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's affairs about the time of the revolu∣tion in 1688 &amp;c.</NOTE>IT has already been observed, that, during most of the time since the Proprietary's return to <HI>En∣gland,</HI> in 1684, much of his public action and service were in that nation; and that his intimacy at court, and friendship with King <HI>James</HI> the Se∣cond, which his great obligation to that royal fa∣mily, and the situation of his own affairs may, both from gratitude and interest, easily account for, exposed him to many unjust censures; but in the year 1688, upon the change of government, the state of his affairs there began to have a very different, and more unfavourable aspect:—For the attempts which had been made by the King, in favour of <HI>popery</HI> and <HI>arbitrary power,</HI> had occa∣sioned the measures of the <HI>revolution,</HI> which now began to take place in the government there, by
<PB N="347" REF="032729_0347_0FF4F2F7098EEA28"/>
means of the <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> "who landed at <HI>Torbay,</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> on the fifth of November,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's affairs about the time of the revolu∣tion in 1688 &amp;c.</NOTE> 1688, to the great joy of the <HI>English</HI> nation. Many of King <HI>James's</HI> officers and army soon joined the <HI>Prince;</HI> and the King, perceiving the hearts of the people alienated from him, withdrew himself, and went over to <HI>France.</HI> Hence by a <HI>Convention,</HI> called shortly after, the said <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> and the <HI>Princess Mary,</HI> his consort, King <HI>James's</HI> daugh∣ter, were declared King and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. and were proclaimed on the thirteenth of February, 1688-9.</P>
<P>"Upon this turn of the times, <HI>William Penn's</HI> late friendship at court having rendered him sus∣pected of disaffection to the present government, on the tenth of December, 1688, when he was walking in <HI>White-Hall,</HI> he was sent for by the Lords of the Council, then sitting; and though nothing appeared against him, and himself assured them,— "That he had done nothing, but what he could answer before God, and all the princes in the world; that he loved his country, and the Pro∣testant religion above his life, and never acted against either; that all he ever aimed at, in his public endeavours, was no other than what the <HI>Prince</HI> himself had declared for; that King <HI>James</HI> was always his friend, and in gratitude, he was the King's, and did ever, as much as in him lay, influence him to his true interest."—Notwithstand∣ing they obliged him to give securities for his ap∣pearance the first day of the <HI>next term,</HI> which he did; and then he was continued, on the same se∣curity, to <HI>Easter-term</HI> following; on the last day of which, nothing having been laid to his charge, he was cleared in open court.</P>
<P>"In the year 1690, he was again brought be∣fore the Lords of the Council, upon an accusation of holding a correspondence with the late King <HI>James;</HI> and they requiring sureties for his appear∣ance,
<PB N="348" REF="032729_0348_0FF4F345386CCF18"/>
he appealed to King <HI>William</HI> himself;<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn's affairs about the time of the revolu∣tion in 1688 &amp;c.</NOTE> who, after a conference of near two hours, inclined to acquit him, but, to please some of the Council, he was held upon bail, for a while; and, in <HI>Tri∣nity-term,</HI> the same year, was again discharged.</P>
<P>"He was attacked a third time, and his name inserted in a proclamation, dated July the 18th. 1690; wherein he, with divers others, to the num∣ber of eighteen, were charged with adhering to the kingdom's enemies; but proof failing, re∣specting him, he was again cleared by order of the <HI>King's-bench Court,</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> in the last day of <HI>Michaelmas-term,</HI> 1690.</P>
<P>"Being now again at liberty, he proposed to go a second time to <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and published proposals in print, for another settlement there. He had so far prepared for this transportation that an order for a convoy was granted him by the Secretary of State, when his voyage was preven∣ted by a fresh accusation against him, backed with the oath of one <HI>William Fuller,</HI> a wretch, after∣wards by Parliament declared a <HI>cheat and impostor;</HI> and a warrant was thereupon granted, for his ap∣prehension; which he narrowly escaped, at his return from the funeral of <HI>George Fox,</HI> the first preacher among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> on the 16th. of January, 1690-1."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>W.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My love, in the unchangeable truth, salutes thee and thine, and the friends and family of God, in those parts, desiring your temporal and everlasting welfare, with an unfeigned affection.</P>
<P>By this time thou wilt have heard of the renewal of my troubles, the only let of my return, being in the midst of my preparations, with a <HI>great company of adventurers,</HI> when they fell upon me.—The jealousies of some, and unworthy dealing of others have made way for them; but under and over it all, the ancient rock has been my shelter and comfort; and I hope yet to see your faces, with our ancient satisfaction.—The Lord grant, if it be for his glory, whose I desire to be, in all conditions; for this world passeth away, and the form and beauty of it fadeth; but there are eternal habitations for the faithful; among whom I pray that my lot may be, rather than among the princes of the earth.</P>
<P>I hope I need not urge my circumstances, to excite thy love, care and concern for me and my suffering interest, in that country. I know thou hast better learned <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Cato,</HI> if I may so say, and wilt em∣brace such an opportunity to chuse to express thy friendship and since∣rity; nor is uncertainty and changeableness thy fault; wherefore I will say no more, but desire that my afflictions may cease, if not cure your animosities, or discontents, within yourselves, if yet they have conti∣nued; and that thou wilt both in government, and to my Commission∣ners of property, yield thy assistance all thou canst.—By all this God may prepare me to be fitter for future service, even to you there. I ask the people forgiveness for my long stay; but when I consider how much it has been my great loss, and for an <HI>ungrateful generation,</HI> it is punish∣ment!—It has been 20,000 pounds to my damage, in the country, and above 10,000 pounds here, and to the province 500 families; but the wise God, that can do what he pleases, as well as see what is in man's heart, is able to requite all; and I am perswaded, all shall yet work together for good, in this very thing, if we can overlook all, that stands in the way of our views Godward, in public matters.—See that all be done prudently and humbly; and keep down irreverence and looseness, and cherish indus∣try and sobriety. The Lord God Almighty be with you, and amongst you, to his praise and your peace. Salute me to John Simcock, R. Tur∣ner, A. Cook, T. Janny, Ph. Pemberton, S. Richardson, W. Yardly, the Welch Friends, and Plimouth Friends, indeed to all of them.—</P>
<P>Thou hast heard of our great loss of dear <HI>John Burnyeat,</HI> and <HI>Ro∣bert Lodge,</HI> one in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and t'other in <HI>England,</HI> in about the same week; and <HI>Robert Barclay, Th. Salthouse,</HI> and dearly beloved <HI>George Fox</HI> since:—He died at <HI>Henry Gouldney's,</HI> by <HI>Gracious-street</HI> meeting-house; where he preached his farewell the First-day, and departed the Third, at Night, between nine and ten.—I was with him; he earnestly recom∣mended to me his love to you all; and said, <HI>William, mind poor Friends in America;</HI> he died triumphantly over death, very easily foresaw his change; he was buryed on the Sixth-day; like a general meeting; 2000 people at his burial, Firends and others:—I was never more public than that day; I felt myself easy; he was got into his <HI>Inn,</HI> before the storm that is coming overtook him; and that night, very providentially I escaped the messenger's hands:—I shall add only, that <HI>Friends</HI> have had an extra∣ordinary time, this <HI>General Meeting;</HI> so that God supplied that visible loss with his glorious presence. <HI>R.

<P>Though the Proprietary had, both by charter and otherwise, endeavoured to connect the pro∣vince and territories of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> in legislation and government, so as to form one General Assem∣bly, yet the jealousies, and difference of sentiment, in some cases, which afterwards arose between the Representatives of each part, in their legislative capacity, tending to create separate interests, and a rupture between them, were frequently the oc∣casion of great uneasiness to him; whose view was always to keep them united, judging it most for the interest of them both, as well as his own.</P>

<P>I am sorry for this breach, which you have made upon the laws, charter and council procedure; you have withdrawn your attendance, without any just cause; lay aside obstinacy, wilful neglect and self in∣terest, I cannot conceive what can support you, at last, but the absurd lenity of the Government. Recollect yourselves; consider well the con∣fusion, to which this your rashness may expose you, and many in∣nocent inhabitants of the lower counties; and return unto your duty, and repesentative service here, and we shall lovingly receive you, and so dispatch, I hope, in a short time, the present emergencies before us.

<P>I have thine of the 13th. instant, thy love and good intention to∣wards me I receive and accept. But, pray, consider how little I am in fault; and how ill I am rewarded by some in that Province.—I left it quiet, and the government in the council. <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> grew weary of this form; writ, and got others to write, to change it to a deputyship; I sent to know, if he would have it; in the meanwhile writ to me, he would not meddle, and desired a <HI>quietus,</HI> or dismiss:—Upon this captain <HI>Blackwell's</HI> wife, general <HI>Lambert's</HI> daughter, coming to me about pre∣senting something of her husband's to the <HI>King;</HI> and remembering him to be a man of sobriety and parts, asked for him, then in <HI>New England;</HI> and if he would accept of the government of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> &amp;c.—This displeased:—I altered and left it to them, to chuse either the government of the council, or five commissioners, or a deputy: What could be ten∣derer? Now I perceive <HI>Thomas Lloyd</HI> is chosen by the three upper, but not the three lower counties; and sits down with this broken choice: This has grieved and wounded me and mine, I fear to the hazard of all! What∣ever the morals of the lower counties are, it was embraced as a mercy, that we got and united them to the province; and a great charter ties them; and this particular ambition has broken it; for the striving can arise from nothing else; and what is that spirit that would sooner divide the child, than let things run in their own channel, but that which sacrifices all bowels to wilfulness! Had they learned what this means, <HI>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice,</HI> there had been no breaches nor animosities there till I had come, at least. I desire thee to write to them; which they will mind now more, than upon the spot; and lay their union upon them; for else the Governor of <HI>New York</HI> is like to have all; if he has it not already. The Lord forgive them their unspeakable injury to me and mine. I have sent, nine months ago, to <HI>J.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the year 1691, an affair happened among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in this part of the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The schism of George Keith, &amp;c.</NOTE> which gave them much uneasiness and trouble, in their religi∣ous capacity, more especially in this Province, and the neighbouring places. This was the difference and separation between them and <HI>George Keith,</HI> before mentioned. He had been an eminent preacher and writer among them, for many years; and had published several well-written treatises, in defence of their religious principles, yet extant. He was a man of quick natural parts, and consi∣derable literary abilities; acute in argument, and very ready and able in logical disputations, and nice distinctions, on theological subjects; but, said to be, of a brittle temper, and over-bearing dispo∣sition of mind; not sufficiently tempered and qua∣lified with that Christian moderation and charity, which give command over the human passions; the distinguishing characteristic of true Christianity: of which he himself had not only made high pro∣fession, but also, in his younger years, as appears
<PB N="364" REF="032729_0364_0FF4F3BAEC6E38C8"/>
by his writings, had a good understanding. His great confidence in his own superior abilities seems to have been one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Keith's schism, &amp;c.</NOTE> if not the chief, introductory cause of this unhappy dispute;—When men set too high a value on themselves, and others will not come up to their price, then they are discontented. He is said to have had too much life in argument and disputation, on religious points of controversy, and sometimes to have exhibited an unbecoming vanity on victory thereby obtained over his oppo∣nents, even, prior to the schism between him and his friends: for having, some time before, been on a visit to <HI>New England,</HI> he is represented as having indulged his natural propensity this way, among the preachers and inhabitants there, in a very ex∣travagant manner: Which disposition of mind, from that time forward, appeared to have so far got the ascendancy over him, that, on his return, he began to exhibit the same, even, among his friends, beginning with finding fault, proposing and urging new regulations, in the society, in re∣spect to the discipline of it, and complaining, <HI>"There was too great a slackness therein."</HI>—Upon his friends not readily joining with him and his proposals, in the manner he expected, he became still more captious, and more disposed to seek mat∣ters of reproach and offence against divers in the so∣ciety, and to make the worst of them; charging some of his friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His allega∣tion against the Quakers</NOTE> who were generally well es∣teemed and approved ministers, with preaching false doctrine; and, it is said, even, in points con∣trary to what himself had formerly held and de∣clared, in his writings, in defence of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and their principles. He found fault with his friends being in the magistracy, and their execut∣ing the penal laws against malefactors, as being in∣consistent with their religious profession; and, in short, contended that he and such as joined with him, were the true <HI>Quakers,</HI> and all the rest, who opposed him, were apostates.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="032729_0365_0FF4F4FC6642EC00"/>These were the principal allegations, which, in beginning of the dispute, he appears to have made against the <HI>Quakers.</HI> The principal things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their charges a∣gainst him.</NOTE> if not the whole, with which I find him charged by them, at that time, appear to be his over-bear∣ing temper, and unchristian disposition of mind, in grossly vilifying and disparaging divers members of the society, who were universally and highly approved among them, and entirely rejecting their advice and judgment, in the affair; the conse∣quence of an overheated and intemperate zeal: which, at last, proceeded so far as to occasion such a breach, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is dis∣owned, &amp;c. in 1692.</NOTE> on the 20th. day of the Fourth-month, 1692, <HI>a declaration, or testimony of denial,</HI> was drawn up against him, at a meeting of the ministers of the society at <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> wherein both he and his conduct were publicly disowned by them.</P>
<P>This <HI>declaration,</HI> which was confirmed at the next following <HI>General Yearly Meeting,</HI> held at <HI>Bur∣lington,</HI> the seventh of the Seventh-month, exhibits more fully the charges against him, and may fur∣ther elucidate the case to the more inquisitive: Which <HI>Testimony,</HI> as it may, probably, be curious to some, if not instructive, is, therefore, placed in the notes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Declaration, or Testimony, of Denial against <HI>George Keith,</HI> was expressed as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LETTER>
<HEAD>To the several Monthly and Quarterly Meetings in <HI>Pennsylvania, East</HI> and <HI>West Jersey,</HI> and elsewhere, as there may be occasion.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN tender love, and with spirits bowed down before the Lord, is this our salutation unto you; earnestly desiring your growth, and daily preservation, in the ancient truth, and in the simplicity of the gospel of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> and our hope and breathings are, that no insinu∣ations, or wiles, of the enemy shall prevail, to turn you aside from your steadfastness, or cause you to esteem lightly of the rock and way of God's salvation unto you, but that you may be kept in the light and life, which was, and is, the just man's path, to the end of our days, Amen!</P>
<P>Now, dear Friends, it is with sorrow of spirits and grief of souls, that we signify unto you the tedious exercise, and vexatious perplexity, we have met with, in our late friend, <HI>George Keith,</HI> for several months past. With mourning and lamentation do we say, How is this mighty man fallen! How is his shield cast away, as though he had not known the oil of the holy Ointment! How shall it be told in <HI>Gath,</HI> and publish∣ed in the streets of <HI>Askalon!</HI> Will not the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph, when they hear that he is fallen upon the soaring mountains, and from the high places of <HI>Israel?</HI> While thou walkedst in the counsel of God, and wert little in thy own eyes, thy bow did abide in strength; thy sword returned not empty from the fat of the enemies of God—thy bow returned not back. His enemies were then vile unto thee▪ and his followers honourable in thy esteem. Oh, how lovely wert thou, in that day, when his beauty was upon thee; and when his comeliness covered thee! Why should his ornaments exalt thee, which were given to hum∣ble thee before him? And how art thou fallen from thy <HI>first love,</HI> and art become <HI>treacherous to the spouse of thy youth.</HI> Consider where thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy <HI>first works</HI></P>
<P>But so it hath happened, Friends, lest any flesh should glory, but become silent before the Lord, that this <HI>once eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and <HI>instrument of renown,</HI> in the hand of the Lord, while he kept his first habitation, and knew the government of Truth over his own spirit; and witnessed the same to be a bridle to his tongue, was then serviceable, both in pen and speech, to the churches of <HI>Christ.</HI> But now, and of late, it is too obvious and apparent, that being degenerated from the lowly, meek and peaceable spirit of <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and grown cool in charity and love towards his brethren, he is gone into a spirit of enmity, wrath, and self-exalta∣tion, contention and janglings; and, as a person without the fear of God before his eyes, and without regard to his Christian brethren, and letting loose to an extravagant tongue, he hath broken out into many ungodly speeches, raising accusations, and passionate threatenings towards many of his brethren and elders; and that upon slender occasions. And when some in Christian duty, have laid before him his unsavory words, and abusive language, as a person of common civility would loath, it hath been too frequent with him, and that, in a transport of heat and passion, to call some of his brethren, in the ministry, and other elders, and that upon small provocations, (if any) <HI>Fools, ignorant Heathens, Infidels, silly Souls, Lyers, Heretics, rotten Ran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, Muggl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tonians,</HI> and other names of that infamous strain; thereby to our grief, foaming out his own shame. And further, his anger and envy being cruel against us, and not content∣ing himself with his harshness against persons, he proceeded, in bitter∣ness of spirit, to charge our meetings with being come together to cloak heresy and deceit; and publishing openly several times, that there were more doctrines of devils, and damnable heresies, among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> than in any profession among the Protestants. He hath long objected against our <HI>Discipline,</HI> even, soon after his coming among us, and having prepared a draught of his own, and the same not finding the expected reception, he seemed disgusted. Since he hath often quarrelled with us about <HI>Confession,</HI> declaring, <HI>"That he knew none given forth by the body of Friends, to his satisfaction;"</HI> and often charged most of us with being un∣sound in the faith. We have offered, in several meetings, for his satis∣faction, and to prevent strife among us, and for preserving the peace of the church, to deliver a <HI>Confession</HI> of our Christian faith, in the words of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the Author of our Christian faith, and in the words of the Apostles and Disciples, his faithful followers; or we would concur, and agree upon a <HI>Confession,</HI> and have it transmitted for approbation of the Yearly Meeting here, or the Yearly Meeting in <HI>London;</HI> yet, it was offered unto him, at the same time, that a <HI>Confession,</HI> concerning the main matters of controversy, should be given out of a book of his own; but all was slighted, as insufficient. The Lord knows the trouble, which we have had with this unruly member; and the open∣ness of our hearts, and well-wishes towards him, notwithstanding his rage and violence against us; and of the endeavours of many in this place, to have gained upon him by a friendly converse, and by other means, not inconsiderable to a brotherly freedom; but our labour hitherto seems to be as water spilt upon a rock. And this meeting, having orderly and tenderly dealt with him, for his abusive language, and disorderly behaviour, he hath not only slighted all applications of gaining him to a sense of his ill-treatment and miscarriages, but, in an insulting manner, said to the friends appointed by the meeting, to admonish him, <HI>"That be trampled the judgment of the Meeting under his feet, as dirt."</HI> And hath, of late, set up a separate meeting here; where he hath, like an open opposer, not only reviled several friends, by exposing their religious re∣putations, in mixt auditories of some hundreds, endeavouring to render them and friends here, by the press and otherwise, a scorn to the profane, and the song of the drunkard; but he hath traduced and vilified our wor∣thy travelling friends, <HI>James Dickinson</HI> and <HI>Thomas Wilson,</HI> in their pow∣erful and savory <HI>ministry,</HI> whose service is not only here, but, in most meetings in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> well known to have a seal in the hearts of many thousands of the <HI>Israel of God.</HI> He hath also within a few weeks, appeared in opposition, as it were, to the body of Friends, by putting on his hat, when our well-received and recommended friend, <HI>James Dickinson,</HI> was at prayer; and that, in a meeting of near a thousand Friends and others; and so going out of the meeting, to the great disquiet thereof, and to the drawing some scores into the same opposition with him, by his ill example. And he thus persisting in his repeated opposi∣tion, hard speeches, and continued separation, and labouring like an un∣wearyed adversary, to widen the breach, made by him, and so, abusing some of the neighbouring meetings, by being, as yet, under that cover∣ing of being owned by us; we are hereby brought under a religious con∣straint, and to prevent other meetings from being further injured by him, to give forth this <HI>Testimony,</HI> strained, as it were, from us, by his many and violent provocations, <HI>viz.</HI> That we cannot own him, in such ungodly speeches, and disorderly behaviour, or, in his separate meetings; and that we disown the same, as proceeding from a wrong spirit, which brings into disorder inwardly, and leads into distraction and confusion outwardly. And, until he condemn and decline the same, we cannot receive him, in his public ministry, and would have him cease to offer his gift, as such, among us, or elsewhere among Friends, till he be reconciled to his offend∣ed brethren. And as those few of our brethren, in the gift of the mini∣stry, who are gone out with <HI>George Keith,</HI> into his uncharitable and divid∣ing spirit, (the miserable effects whereof many of us have sufficiently known, in <HI>Old England,</HI> and other parts) our judgment is, that, while they continue such, they become unqualified to the work of the Gospel, as degenerating from the guidance of God's blessed and peaceable spirit; in their hearts, (from whence proceeds the effectual New Testament mi∣nistry) and being turned from the peaceable fruits thereof, are gone to un-charity and contention.</P>
<P>And now, all you, who have walked in fellowship and communion with us, and are drawn aside, through inconsideration, or otherwise, into the spirit of separation and prejudice against our meetings, orderly esta∣blished; and wherein we have often been mutually refreshed together; we cannot but, in the fear of God, and in love to your souls, admonish you also of the insecurity of your present state, and that, therein we cannot have unity with you; and unless you return from under that spirit, dry∣ness and barrenness from the Lord, will be your reward.</P>
<P>And so, dear Friends, we exhort you all to behave your selves, in the spirit of meekness, and pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eable truth, upon all occasions, but more especially upon any discourse, or conference, with any of them, who are discontented among you, or started aside from you; and avoid all heats and contentions in matters of faith and worship; and let not the salt of the covenant be wanting in your words and actions; for, thereby the favour of your conversation will reach the witness of God in them. The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, Amen.</P>

<P>"WE find it our duty to join with our brethren, in their Testimony against that spirit of railing lying, slandering, and falsely accusing, which hath risen, and acted, notoriously in <HI>George Keith,</HI> and his adherents; which hath led them into a mischievous and hurtful separation.

</LETTER><P>The Yearly Meeting in <HI>London,</HI> in the Third-month, 1694, unani∣mously declared it to be their sense and judgment,—"That the said <HI>George Keith</HI> was gone from the blessed unity of the peaceable spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ▪ and hath thereby separated himself from the holy fellowship of the church of Christ; and that, while he is in an unreconciled and uncharitable state, he ought not to preach, or pray, in any of Friends' meetings, nor be owned, or received as one of us, until by a public and hearty acknowledgement of the great offence, he has given, and hurt he hath done, and condemnation of himself therefor, he gives proof of his unfeigned repentance, and doth his endeavours to remove and take off the reproach he hath brought upon Truth and Friends; which, in the love of God, we heartily desire, for his soul's sake."</P><P>Respecting divers of the persons, who signed the preceding paper of Denial against George Keith, see in other places of this history, <HI>viz.</HI> of Thomas Lloyd, John Simcock, Griffith Owen, William Biles, Samuel Jenings, John Delavall, Joseph Kirkbride, Hugh Roberts, Robert Owen, &amp;c.</P><P><HI>John Lynam</HI> came from Derbyshire; was a preacher and writer among the Quakers; died in Pennsylvania and was buried in Philadelphia, in the Second-month, 1698.</P><P><HI>William Stockdale</HI> came from Ireland; was a writer and preacher among the Quakers; died in Pennsylvania, and was buried at Philadelphia, in the Seventh-month, 1693.</P><P><HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iel Wills,</HI> from Northampton, in England, removed to New Jer∣sey in 1677, and died in Barbadoes;—a preacher among the Quakers.</P><P><HI>John Willsford,</HI> from Leicestershire; a preacher and writer among the Quakers; removed to New Jersey, and died at Burlington in that province.</P><P><HI>Note,</HI> Some of the principal persons who adhered to <HI>Keith,</HI> and were men of rank, character and reputation, in these provinces, and divers of them great preachers and much followed, were, Thomas Budd, George Hutchinson, Robert Turner, Francis Rawle, John Hart, Charles Reade, &amp;c.</P><P><HI>Note.</HI>—"In the year, 1692, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> made a col∣lection of a sum of money, in conjunction with their friends, in <HI>England,</HI> for the relief of some of their society, who were taken prisoners by the <HI>Sallee-men,</HI> to <HI>Marqueness,</HI> in Turkey; and in suffering there: which was sent to the society in <HI>London,</HI> for them to dispose of for that purpose."

<P>He appealed, or complained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He appeals to the Qua∣kers in En∣gland.</NOTE> to the Yearly Meeting of the society, in <HI>London,</HI> against the <HI>Quakers</HI> of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> who had disowned him, and appeared there in person; where he was con∣fronted by divers from the province. But, in this place, it is said, his passion and wrath so far pre∣vailed over him, and his demeanour was so unrea∣sonable and outragious, and so much disposed for contention and dispute, that notwithstanding all possible endeavours for a reconciliation, and heal∣ing measures taking place between them, his de∣nial was there finally confirmed.</P>
<P>He thenceforward became a public and bitter enemy, as far as in him lay, against the <HI>Quakers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He becomes a publicene∣my to the Quakers.</NOTE> in general; preaching and writing against them with all imaginable virulency: In which he appear∣ed afterwards to be employed by their adversaries, for that purpose; for having joined with the Epis∣copal
<PB N="370" REF="032729_0370_0FF4F36A294E66E0"/>
Clergy, in <HI>England,</HI> and served there for some time, as a Vicar, ordained by the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He becomes a clergyman and gives the Quakers more trou¦ble in Ame∣rica, &amp;c.</NOTE> he afterwards returned to <HI>America;</HI> where, as a <HI>Clergyman,</HI> in orders, he officiated in his new function for about twelve months; and, having there given the <HI>Quakers</HI> all the trouble in his power, he returned again to <HI>England</HI> by way of <HI>Virginia.</HI> In this visit, it is said, he was generally slighted, both by those, who before had been his adherents, and others: And that his conduct was so glaringly inconsistent with his former pretensions; and his be∣haviour towards the <HI>Quakers</HI> so manifestly arising from a malignant disposition of mind, and disap∣pointed malice, notwithstanding all the superior abilities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is generally despised.</NOTE> which he possessed, and made use of, he was universally despised by sober and thinking people of all societies.</P>
<P>After his return to <HI>England,</HI> he was fixed in a benefice, in <HI>Sussex;</HI> and continued to write against his former Friends, as a bitter enemy; but, as far as appears, with a sinking reputation. At last, on his death-bed, from a well authenticated account, it is asserted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of his Death∣bed expres∣sions, &amp;c.</NOTE> he thus expressed himself; <HI>"I wish I had died when I was a Quaker; for then I am sure it would have been well with my soul."</HI>—This is an instance of the weakness of the human mind, even, when aided with the acquirements of science and superior knowledge; it shews how far from their real interest and true happiness, strong passions and unruly tempers may sometimes hurry, even, men of understanding; and how widely different things appear, in times of ambition, rage and revenge, from what they really are, in our cool and reflect∣ing moments.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="032729_0371_0FF4F42746F04690"/>This schism made a great disturbance, in the pro∣vince, for a time, and in some other places, among the <HI>Quakers;</HI> yet many, or the major part,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many re∣turn again to the Qua∣kers.</NOTE> of those persons, who had thus separated themselves, through the conduct of this person, are said, to have returned soon after to the society.</P>
<P>But because <HI>Keith</HI> had, (as accounts say) by abusive language and printed publications, vilified divers persons in the Magistracy, tending to sub∣vert that absolutely necessary institution and order in civil society, and thereby had drawn upon him∣self some judicial proceedings, on that account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Judicial proceedings against him.</NOTE> some persons have been disposed to charge the <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> if possible, <HI>with persecution for religion;</HI> and as this appears to be the only case, in which their enemies pretend to have just ground to accuse them of this evil, I shall, therefore, endeavour here to lay before the reader, that part of this transaction as circumstantially as the accounts remaining of it will permit.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1691, a person, named <HI>Babit,</HI> with some others, stole a small sloop, from a wharf, in <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and in going down the river with it, committed divers robberies; of which intelligence being early given to the Magi∣strates, three of them gave out a warrant, in the nature of a <HI>Hue and Cry,</HI> to take them, in order to a legal tryal and punishment; by virtue of which they were taken, and brought to justice. The Magistrates, who granted this warrant, being <HI>Qua∣kers, George Keith,</HI> and his party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. Keith censures the <HI>magistrates.</HI></NOTE> soon after took occasion from thence to represent it as inconsistent with their principles against fighting.—He called <HI>Thomas Lloyd,</HI> the Deputy Governor, who was ac∣counted a person of a mild temper and deportment, good sense, and unblemished character, and whose unwearyed endeavours, to serve him, are said to have merited a different treatment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And vilifies them, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>"An impudent man, and a pityful Governor;"</HI> asking him, <HI>"Why he
<PB N="372" REF="032729_0372_0FF4F3CB58D77B58"/>
did not send him to jail?"</HI> and telling him, <HI>"His back had long itched for a whipping; and that he would print and expose them all over America, if not over Europe;"</HI> and one of the Magistrates, who was well known to be a modest and peaceable man, he opprobriously called, <HI>"An impudent rascal:"</HI> Such his conduct is represented to have been.</P>
<P>Besides, being much enraged, he had published several virulent pieces;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He reflects on the Ma∣gistrates in print, &amp;c.</NOTE> one of which indecently reflecting on the above mentioned transaction, and on several of the principal Magistrates in their ju∣dicial capacity, and thereby lessening the lawful authority of the magistracy, in the view of the baser sort of the people, who began thereupon to take greater liberties; wherefore the printers, <HI>Wil∣liam Bradford</HI> and <HI>John M'Comb,</HI> who had publish∣ed it, were, by a warrant, from five Magistrates, <HI>viz. Arthur Cook, Samuel Jenings, Samuel Richard∣son, Humphrey Murray</HI> and <HI>Robert Ewer,</HI> taken up, examined, and upon their contemptuous beha∣viour to the court and justices, in their examination, and upon their refusal to give security, to answer at court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prin∣ters com∣mitted, &amp;c.</NOTE> the usual practice in all similar occasions, they were committed; and though they were under no confinement, being entirely at large, on their bare word only, yet, (which seems to have been done by them, to answer some particular design) at a certain time, having occasion to sign a paper, when they could not be admitted into the prison itself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They sign a paper from the prison.</NOTE> it is said, they got into the entry of it, and there dated, and signed the said paper, as from the prison:—But they were soon discharged, without being brought to a tryal.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">G Keith &amp; Tho.

where, in page third, about the latter end of the same, they, the said <HI>George Keith</HI> and <HI>Tho∣mas Budd,</HI> defamingly accuse <HI>Samuel Jenings,</HI> he being a Judge and a Magistrate, of this province, of being <HI>too high and imperious in worldly courts,</HI> calling him, <HI>impudent, presumptuous</HI> and <HI>insolent man,</HI> greatly exposing his reputation, and of an ill precedent, and <HI>contrary to the law, in that case made and provided."</HI></P>
<P>The lenity of the magistracy is said to have been very remarkable towards the actions and behaviour of divers of these people, when compared with the provocations given; which, by apparent design, had not only been, but also still continued to be, so extremely notorious and abusive, as well as de∣rogatory to the principal persons in authority, in their judicial capacity, that, it is said, the rabble became greatly encouraged thereby, to despise and inveigh against the acts of government, and to render it more and more difficult to bring offen∣ders to justice; it was, therefore, thought proper that this presentment should be prosecuted;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are tryed and fined.</NOTE> so the matter was brought to a tryal, and the parties fined five pounds each; but the fines were never ex∣acted.</P>

<P>And further, the said <HI>George Keith,</HI> with se∣veral of his adherents, having, some few days since, with unusual insolence, by a printed sheet, called, <HI>"An appeal,"</HI> &amp;c. traduced and vilely misrepre∣sented the industry, care, readiness and vigilance of some magistrates and others here, in their late proceedings against the <HI>privateers, Babit, and his

it, in the present circumstances, and reminding him of his particular obligation to him. This the Proprietary having mentioned in the abovesaid let∣ter, to his friends in the province, the following answer, respecting the Governor of <HI>New-York,</HI> was returned by six of them, <HI>viz.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The humble address of the freemen of the pro∣vince of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> presented by their de∣legates, Members of the Provincial Council, sheweth,</HEAD>
<P>THAT, whereas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coun∣cil's address to governor Fletcher.</NOTE> the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the the second, in the thirty-third year of his reign, by letters patent, under the great seal of <HI>England,</HI> did, for the consideration therein mentioned, grant unto <HI>William Penn</HI> and his assigns, this colony, or tract of land, erecting the same into a Province, calling it <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and constituting the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> absolute Proprietary of the said Pro∣vince, saving (among other things) the sovereignty thereof, with power also, by virtue of the said royal charter, to the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> his deputies and lieutenants, to make laws, with the advice and as∣sent of the freemen of the said province, or the greatest part of them, or of their delegates, or deputies, whom, for the enacting of the said laws, when, as often as need required, he, the said <HI>Wil∣liam Penn,</HI> should assemble, in such sort, as to him should seem best, with divers other great powers, immunities and privileges, in the same charter con∣tained, which, relation being thereunto had, may more at large appear.</P>
<P>By virtue, and in pursuance whereof the said Proprietary, <HI>William Penn,</HI> with the advice and consent of the freemen of this Province, in Gene∣ral Assembly met, at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> (in 1683) did enact, that the time for the meeting of the free∣men, to chuse their Deputies, to represent them in Provincial Council, and General Assembly, should be on the 10th. day of the First-month, yearly; and the members chosen, for the Provin∣cial Council (consisting of three persons out of each county) should give their attendance, within
<PB N="384" REF="032729_0384_0FF4F3DF10D43658"/>
twenty days after election, in order to propose bills; and the members of Assembly, being six out of each county,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coun∣cil's address to governor Fletcher.</NOTE> should meet on the tenth of the Third-month, called May, yearly, in order to pass those proposed bills into laws; but, in case any of the said members should either be of ill fame, or wilfully absent from their service, or hap∣pen to die, it is provided by another law, (made in 1684) that it shall be lawful for the Proprietary and Governor, within ten days after knowledge of the same, to issue out a writ to the Sheriff of the county, for which the party was chosen, immedi∣ately to summon the freemen to elect another member, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, forasmuch as the present emergency of affairs, in this province, may require a General Assembly to be speedily called, and since we con∣ceive it hath pleased the King and Queen so far to countenance our laws and constitution as to direct the present governancy to rule thereby, until the laws be duly made, to alter, or amend the same;</P>
<P>We, therefore, earnestly desire, that no other measures may be taken, for electing, or convening, our legislative power, than our recited laws and constitutions of this government prescribe, the rather, for that the said King did, by his letters pa∣tent, enjoin, require and command, that the laws made, as aforesaid, should be most absolute and available in law, and that all the liege people and subjects of the said late King, his heirs and succes∣sors, should observe and keep the same inviolable, in these parts.</P>

<P><PB N="385" REF="032729_0385_0FF4F3795599CCE8"/>The Assembly, being met on the 16th. of the Third-month, presented their Speaker, <HI>Joseph Growdon,</HI> to the Governor, for his approbation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed∣ngs of the Governor &amp; Assembly</NOTE> who being accepted, the oaths and tests were pre∣sented to the whole house, in the manner of other governments, under the immediate administration of the crown; but some of the members, being scrupulous of taking oaths, and refusing to be sworn, were indulged with subscribing to the de∣clarations and professions, mentioned in the act of Parliament, for <HI>liberty of conscience,</HI> made in the first year of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> This the Governor told them was an <HI>act of grace,</HI> and <HI>not of right,</HI> so as to be drawn into precedent in future.</P>
<P>It doth not appear that either the Proprietary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The go∣vernment &amp; privileges of Pennsyl∣vania not forfeited.</NOTE> or the people of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> had forfeited those rights and privileges, whose enjoyment had been the compact of their settlement of the province; of which privileges, those which respected their religious, or conscientious scruples were the chief; but the contrary rather is manifest: For notwith∣standing what was alledged for depriving the Pro∣prietary of the government, it was well known that the suspicion of his adhering too much to King <HI>James</HI> was the principal, if not the only, cause for rendering him incapable of attending so pro∣perly to it, as it seemed at that time to require: But nothing was ever proved, to confirm what was alledged against him, in that respect; though it injured him so far, as to oblige him, for a time, to be in secret, and to be absent too long from his province; whereby some disorders happened in it, that in all probability, would otherwise have been prevented; but none of such magnitude, as to violate, or prevent, the regular administration of justice, as seems to have been alledged by the ene∣mies of the prosperity of the province; much less to give just occasion for depriving the colonists of
<PB N="386" REF="032729_0386_0FF4F3E09EA060B8"/>
their dearly bought rights and privileges, granted by charter, confirmed by laws, and familiarized by custom; though it might be called a favour, to enjoy them, where power alone has the rule, without having any regard to justice: For notwith∣standing the Governor was changed, yet it was presumed the government, or constitution, was not, in consequence thereof, to be violated, or altered, and that the inhabitants of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> had as just a right to be governed <HI>according to the usage of Pennsylvania,</HI> and their own laws, then in force,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Flet∣cher's com∣mission, &amp;c. page 378.</NOTE> as those of <HI>New-York had to be governed according to the usage of that province,</HI> though their usages were different, so long as justice was equally well administered by the former, as by the latter, and in a manner more agreeable to them.</P>
<P>The Assembly, however, in consideration of the present circumstances of affairs, thought it most prudent to submit, though not consistent with a privilege, to which, in their apprehension, they had a right, and below the justice of their claim; and, for the present, acknowledged the same, as <HI>an act of grace and savour,</HI> proceeding from the <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>kindness</HI> of the Governor.</P>
<P>The Assembly being qualified, the Governor communicated to them a letter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Queen's letter to <HI>Benjamin Fletcher,</HI> Esquire, Captain General, and Governor in Chief, in and over the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> &amp;c.</P><LETTER>

<P>According to the Assembly's petition the Gover∣nor sent back several bills, with his objections, for amendments; which, being agreed to, were after∣wards passed. And the rolls of such old laws, as the Assembly did not think fit to repeal, to pre∣vent any doubt of their being in force, being sent

<P>During Governor <HI>Fletcher's</HI> administration here, he appears to have been several times in the pro∣vince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1694.</NOTE> but never long at one time.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gov.

<P>"That he was come to lay the whole affair before them, assuring them, that their own <HI>Indians</HI> here would be compelled to join the fatal confederacy.</P>

<P>But what return was made by the house to his request, in the latter part of the above message, does not clearly appear; only I find, that, in a letter of the Proprietary, dated, <HI>Bristol,</HI> fifth of the Ninth-month, 1695, which seems to allude to part of the present proceedings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W.

and, being endowed with good natural parts, and an amiable disposition of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death and character of Th.

He was mostly one of the principal persons in the government, from his first arrival, and of very great service in the public affairs: Yet he appears to have so much disliked such a public kind of life, that, from the sole view of serving his country, when it so much needed it, he is said to have accepted of the eminent offices, which, at different times, he held in the admini∣stration, &amp;c. for he was so far from making advan∣tage, or profit, to himself, by thus devoting his superior abilities, that it is asserted, he worsted, or lessened, his private estate thereby.</P>

<P>THIS comes by the Pennsylvania Merchant, — <HI>Harrison,</HI> commander, and C. Saunders, merchant. By them and this know, that it hath pleased God to work my enlargement, by three Lords represent∣ing my case, as not only hard, but oppressive; that there was nothing against me, but what impostors, or those that are fled, or that have, since their pardon, refused to verify, (and asked me pardon, for saying what they did) alledged against me; that they had long known me, some of them thirty years, and had never known me to do an ill thing, but many good offices; and, that, for not being thought to go abroad in defiance to the government, I might and would have done it, two years ago; and, that I was, therefore, willing to wait to go about my affairs, as before, with leave; that I might be the better respected, in the liberty I took to follow it.</P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI> answered, "That I was his old acquaintance, as well as theirs; and, that I might follow my business as freely as ever; and that he had nothing to say to me."—Upon which they pressed him to command one of them, to declare the same to the Secretary of State, Sir <HI>John Trenchard,</HI> that if I came to him, or otherwise, he might signify the same to me;—which he also did: —The Lords were <HI>Rochester, Ra∣nelagh,</HI> and <HI>Sidney;</HI> and the last, as my greatest acquaintance, was to tell the Secretary; accordingly he did; and the Secretary, after speaking himself, and having it from King <HI>William</HI>'s own mouth, appointed me a time to meet him at home; and did, with the <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Winchester,</HI> and told me, I was as free as ever; and, as he doubted not my prudence about my quiet living, so he assured me, I should not be molested, or in∣jured in any of my affairs, at least while he held that post. The Secre∣tary is my old friend, and one I served, after the D of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and Lord Russel's business: I carried him in my coach to Windsor, and pre∣sented him to <HI>King James;</HI> and when the revolution came, he bought my four horses, that carried us. It was about three or four months before the revolution. The lords spoke the 23th of November, and he dischar∣ged me on the 30th.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Ancient Testimony</HI> of the people called <HI>Quakers</HI> renewed, with re∣spect to the <HI>King and Government,</HI> and touching the present <HI>Association.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE, the said people, do solemnly and sincerely declare, That it hath been our judgment and principle, from the first day we were called to profess the light of <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> manifested in our consciences, unto this day, that the setting up and putting down kings and governments is God's peculiar prerogative, for causes best known to himself; and that it is not our work, or business, to have any hand, or contrivance therein, nor to be busy-bodies, in matters above our station; much less to plot, or con∣trive the ruin, or overturn, of any of them: But to pray for the king, and for the safety of our nation, and good of all men, that we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godliness and honesty, under the govern∣ment, which he is pleased to set over us.</P>
<P>And, according to this our <HI>ancient and innocent principle,</HI> we have of∣ten given forth our testimony, and now do, against all plotting, conspi∣racies, and contriving insurrections against the King, or the government, and against all treacherous, barbarous and murderous designs whatsoever, as works of the devil and darkness; and we sincerely bless God, and are heartily thankful to the king and government, for the liberty and privi∣leges we enjoy under them, by law, esteeming it our duty to be true and faithful to them.</P>
<P><HI>And whereas,</HI> we, the said people, are required to sign the said as∣sociation, we sincerely declare, that our refusing so to do, is not out of any disaffection to the King, or Government, nor in opposition to his being declared rightful and lawful King of these realms, but purely be∣cause we cannot, for conscience' sake, sight, kill, or revenge, either for ourselves, or any man else.</P>
<P>And we believe that the timely discovery and prevention of the late barbarous design and mischievous plot against the King and Govern∣ment, and the sad effects it might have had, is an eminent mercy from Almighty God; for which we, and the whole nation, have great cause to be humbly thankful to him, and to pray for the continuance of his mer∣cies to them and us.</P>

<P>THAT, whereas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The As∣sembly's re∣monstrance to Governor Markham.</NOTE> the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, by his royal charter, made in the thirty-third year of his reign, under the great seal of <HI>England,</HI> was pleased to signify, that <HI>William Penn,</HI> (out of a commendable desire to enlarge the <HI>Bri∣tish empire,</HI> and promote such useful commodities as might be of benefit to the King and his domi∣nions, as also to induce the savage nations, by gentle and just manners, to the love of civil soci∣ety, and the <HI>Christian</HI> religion) had humbly sought leave to transport an ample colony into this coun∣try;
<PB N="410" REF="032729_0410_0FF4F46B4E74AF00"/>
wherefore, the said King, favouring the peti∣tion, and good purpose of the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> did,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The As∣sembly's re∣monstrance.</NOTE> in and by the said charter, for him, his heirs and successors, give and grant unto the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> his heirs and assigns, all this said country, and tract of land, called <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and con∣stituted him, the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> absolute Pro∣prietor thereof, vesting him, and such as were to be adventurers with him, the settlers and inhabi∣tants of said province, with divers powers, privi∣leges and immunities, under the reservations, pro∣visos and restrictions, in the said charter specified; charging all officers, &amp;c. to be, at all times aiding and assisting to the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> and unto the said inhabitants and merchants of the said pro∣vince, in the full use and fruition of the benefits of the said charter.</P>
<P>In pursuance whereof the said <HI>William Penn,</HI> and divers substantial persons, who first embarked with him, in that so commendable a design, did soon afterwards (by the advice of learned council) conclude upon a certain frame of government, consistent with the powers of the said patent, but suitable with the <HI>religious perswasion</HI> of the major part of the undertakers, and well accommodated to all. This model, together with the franchises and immunities expressly granted by the aforesaid letters patent to the people, did induce them to conceive (and, we hope, upon just grounds too) that since the King had been so favourably pleased to incorporate them, and in so great a measure, connected the people's privileges with their pro∣perties, that they could not be any more divested of the one, than the other, but by due course of law, and proved more than ordinary motives to incline several hundreds to transport themselves and families into this country, out of divers parts; so that this province hath not been, at first, popu∣lated under <HI>William Penn's</HI> government, with <HI>tran∣sported

felons,</HI> or <HI>criminals,</HI> but mostly, <HI>the people called Quakers,</HI> men of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>sobriety,</HI> having visible estates and credit in the world; who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The As∣sembly's re∣monstrance.</NOTE> with no less desires of that freedom, to answer the end of the King's grant, (with respect to propagating the Christian religion) were made willing to leave their native land, part with their friends and near relations, and remove themselves into the wilder∣ness, hoping to enjoy their said privileges and li∣berties, more than any prospect, they had of worldly advantage, or preferment; and when they arrived here, exposed themselves and tender fami∣lies to great hardships, (attending the hazard and inconveniencies of a new plantation) exhausted their estates, <HI>and have not been at all chargeable to the crown,</HI> in so considerable a settlement, as is well known; but before they could thoroughly come into a comfortable way of living and put themselves into a capacity to pay either their parti∣cular, or public debts, this government became (it seems) as the butt of our neighbour's envy; who, misrepresenting things at home, did obtain a commission from the King and Queen, constitu∣ting Colonel <HI>Fletcher,</HI> Commander in Chief over this province and territories; who, during his governancy, diverted the course of our legislative procedure, and introduced another method; and continued the same, until the said King and Queen were favourably pleased, by their letters patent, to restore the said Proprietary to the administration of the government of this province and territories; upon which restoration, the power and authority, which Colonel <HI>Fletcher</HI> had made use of, to lay aside our charteral rights and privileges, were, by the said patent, determined, and made void.</P>
<P>Wherefore, the Proprietary thought fit to authorize thee, to act according to the known laws and usages of this government: In pursuance whereof thou wast pleased to issue forth thy writs,
<PB N="412" REF="032729_0412_0FF4F46CDD095D68"/>
directed to the respective Sheriffs of this province and territories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The As∣sembly's re∣monstrance.</NOTE> commanding them to summon all the Freemen of the respective counties to meet upon the tenth day of the month called April, 1695, in the usual place of meeting, then and there, according to law and charter, to chuse three persons, in each county, to serve in Provincial Council, one for three years, one for two years, and the other for one year; and six persons out of each county, to serve as Members of Assembly. In obedience to which writs elections were made, and a General Assembly began to be held here, on the tenth day of September, 1695:—And, truly, those of us, that attended that service, were glad, when thou so frequently expressed thy readiness to confirm our rights and privileges, adding, That thou wouldest not so much as endeavour to dimi∣nish them; which gave further encouragement to the then Representatives; who, with much alacrity, and dutiful acknowledgments of the King's justice and favour, in restoring the said Proprietary to his rights, did proceed to manifest their affections to the King, as well as their readiness to answer his expectations, about supporting this government, so far as, in conscience, they could, according to their ability, and circumstances of affairs; and so agreed to make an assessment of money, upon all estates within this province and country, for the support of government; which, together with the £250 Sterling, thentofore raised, and made payable to Colonel Fletcher, toward the support of this go∣vernment, and not expressly appointed for any other particular use, they, the said Representatives, humbly desired might be deemed and taken, instead of the assistance required from this country; the same being in answer to the late Queen's letter, so far as, in conscience and abilities, they could com∣ply therewith; and so perfected the bill, ready for thy passing; having joined therewith only one bill, modelled with thy approbation, and corrected ac∣cording
<PB N="413" REF="032729_0413_0FF4F4C6909F0140"/>

<P>WHEREAS, our Proprietary hath lately given us to understand of sundry accusations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣mation of the Govern∣or &amp; Coun∣cil.</NOTE> or complaints, against this government, for conni∣ving at <HI>illegal trade</HI> and <HI>harbouring of pirates;</HI> as also of the reports, that are gone to <HI>England,</HI> about the <HI>growth of vice</HI> and <HI>looseness</HI> here.</P>
<P>As to the former, it is evident, that they are the effects of the envy and emulation of those, who, by such unfair and indirect means, would accomplish their designs against this government: For that we are satisfied the generality of the peo∣ple, merchants and traders of this province and territories, are innocent and clear of those impu∣tations.

<P>And, as concerning vice, we also find, that the Magistrates have been careful and diligent to suppress it; but their endeavours have been some∣times ineffectual therein; by reason, that the ordi∣naries, or drinking houses, especially in <HI>Philadel∣phia,</HI> grow too numerous, and the keepers thereof disorderly, and regardless of the tenor and obli∣gations of their licenses, whereby they prove un∣grateful to the Governor, and a reproach to the government.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore,</HI> these are strictly to charge and command all Magistrates and officers whatsoever, within the province and territories, as they regard the honour of God, and their allegiance to the King, faithfully to put in execution all the acts, or laws of trade and navigation, and also the laws and statutes extant against piracy, whenever there is any such occasion; and to use their utmost dili∣gence and care in preventing, suppressing and

<P>And we further strictly charge and command all persons, within this government, as they will answer the contrary at their peril, that they give due assistance to the Magistrates and officers afore∣said, in putting the said laws in execution, and suppressing vice, that the wrath of God, and the King's displeasure may not be drawn upon this poor country.</P>

He had, without any professed application to the sciences, acquired a gene∣ral knowledge in natural philosophy, and most branches of the mathema∣tics; and had the most refined and extensive ideas in the metaphysics: but the inward and eternal happiness of mankind was his favorite study. He was a complete gentleman, generous in his sentiments, affable in his be∣haviour, free and communicative to people in all stations and circum∣stances. His time was chiefly devoted to the service of God, in dis∣charging that public concern of preaching the gospel; which he esteemed his indispensable duty. Of the good effect of whose extraordinary qua∣lification and faithful labors there are many living witnesses.

<P>Though the Assembly, in this case, appeared not unwilling to contribute to the common defence, if the circumstances of the colony would have per∣mitted; and the Proprietary himself particularly further urged a compliance, in this matter, in his speech to the next following Assembly; yet the na∣ture of this letter and requisition, to such a young and infant colony, considering the principles, upon which it was primarily planted and founded, seems to indicate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pennsyl∣vania not without enemies at Court.</NOTE> that it was not without enemies, at Court: for the pacific principles and motives, or views, of <HI>William Penn,</HI> and of the first and early adventurers, in general, under him, in their settling this wilderness, 'tis presumed, could not possibly be less known, at this time, to the admi∣nistration at home, than they were before, to the persons in power, when the royal charter was granted by King Charles the second; from which knowledge of them it was impossible that any thing
<PB N="427" REF="032729_0427_0FF4F4D9485AD6F8"/>
immediately, or directly, of a military nature could reasonably be expected in the settlement:—which charter expressly mentions, the motives for the said grant were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motives for the <HI>grant</HI> &amp; <HI>settlement</HI> of Pennsyl∣vania.</NOTE>—"A commendable desire of <HI>William Penn</HI> to enlarge our <HI>English</HI> empire, and promote such useful commodities as may be of benefit to us, and our dominions, and also to reduce the savage natives, by gentle and just manners, to the love of civil society, and Christian religion;"—besides a debt, due from the government to his father, ad∣miral <HI>Penn.</HI></P>
<P>Such motives as these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pennsyl∣vania was not first set∣tled from views of a <HI>military</HI> na∣ture, but the contrary.</NOTE> and not those of a mili∣tary nature, were most certainly the chief induce∣ment for the settlement of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> not only in the settlers themselves, together with the peace∣able enjoyment of their religion, and civil liber∣ties, but also in those, who made the grant;—if they properly knew to whom, and on what prin∣ciples they made it; which it would be very absurd to deny:—As for the experiment, or consequence, of the operation of these principles, or motives, in the province, it will, in part, hereafter appear in this history.</P>
<P>The cultivation of peace and civilization, and of the articles of trade and commerce, in which the <HI>Quakers</HI> were known to excel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War not better than peace, &amp;c.</NOTE> must be ac∣knowledged to be no less important and necessary, to render a state happy and prosperous, than wea∣pons of war, and fighting of battles; and these people were then, and have since been still more known, from experience, to practise, as well as profess, those ways and means, which excel the latter, so far as the prevention of an evil does the cure of it.</P>
<P>Moreover, since it is improbable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motives and means of peace ra∣ther to be encouraged.</NOTE> that people of this kind will ever be very numerous, if we judge of the future by what is past; but that war and its consequences, will be more likely to prevail among the generality of mankind, so long as the cause
<PB N="428" REF="032729_0428_0FF4F48CEA4A10A8"/>
of it exists in the human race; so the rarity of such people, their innocence, and known great utility, in other respects, seem, according to reason, to render them rather objects of encouragement, in their own way, than of oppression, even, from the military department itself, but more especially so, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here peace is preferred to war:—But, if it should be otherwise, and they should so increase, as much to prevail among mankind, then the oc∣casion for war would consequently so much de∣crease, or be taken away; which would be a hap∣py change indeed.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1701.</NOTE>IT was thought, from some circumstances, that the Proprietary's real intention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro¦prietary's application &amp; diligence</NOTE> at this time, was to spend the remainder of his life, in his province, as himself declared, and that without being obliged to cross the ocean any more; he accordingly ap∣plied himself with much diligence and assiduity to the offices of government, and the establishment of wholesome regulations and usages; in which the inevitable difficulties, arising from the various dispo∣sitions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet cannot please all.</NOTE> and opposite interests and claims of such a mixture of different kinds of people and humours,
<PB N="435" REF="032729_0435_0FF4F4EA86E49278"/>
as the colony consisted of, and in so much liberty as they enjoyed, afforded him much trial of skill and patience: yet his administration was distinguished by great paternal care and influence, as well as pro∣vident circumspection; and both the province and territories, notwithstanding the difficulties, hard∣ships, and inevitable disappointments, which, more or less, always attend the settlement and well or∣dering of any new country, appear to have so much tried the patience of some of the people, as to occasion him more trouble, in some respects, than otherwise probably would have been necessary, were, in reality, when compared with other places of similar age and circumstances, in an easy, flou∣rishing and happy condition.</P>
<P>But, during this time of his absence from <HI>En∣gland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transac∣tions in En∣gland call home the Proprietary</NOTE> it appears that measures were in agitation there, for reducing both his, and the other pro∣prietary governments, in <HI>America,</HI> into regal ones, under pretence of advancing the prerogative of the crown, and the national advantage;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Attempts of this nature were likewise afterwards made, as appears in <HI>Anderson's</HI> history of trade and commerce. vol 2d. under the year 1715; wherein are the following observations on this head, <HI>viz.</HI></P><P>—"Upon a petition of the agent for the planters and merchants of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and of the other miserable inhabitants of that colony, oppress∣ed by the Lords Proprietaries, and their defence against the <HI>Indians</HI> ne∣glected, &amp;c. the House of Commons addressed the King, to send them relief, and in the said year, (1715) a bill was brought into the <HI>British House of Commons, for the better regulation of the charter and proprietary go∣vernments, in America, and of his Majesty's plantations there</HI> The prin∣cipal scope of which was, for the reducing all the said proprietary charter governments into regal ones. Ever since the proprietary colonies began to be very considerable, <HI>i. e.</HI> since the death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the second, and more especially since the revolution, anno 1688, both King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Ann's</HI> councils and ministries foresaw the great consequence, it would be of to the Crown and Kingdom, to buy off the Lords Pro∣prietaries of colonies, before they should grow too powerful; and fre∣quent treaties were held with them by the Ministers of the Crown, for that end; particularly with the <HI>truly great Mr. William Penn,</HI> for the purchase of <HI>Pennsylvania."</HI>—</P></NOTE> and a bill, for that purpose, was actually brought into the House of Lords: Upon which, such of the owners of land in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> as were then in

<P>Think, therefore, (since all men are mortal) of some suitable expedient and provision, for your safety, as well in your privileges, as property, and you will find me ready to comply with whatsoever may render us happy, by a nearer union of our interests.</P>
<P>Review again your laws; propose new ones, that may better your circumstances; and what you do, do it quickly, remembering that the Parlia∣ment sits the end of next month; and that the sooner I am there, the safer, I hope, we shall be here.</P>
<P>I must recommend to your serious thoughts and care the King's letter to me, for the assistance of <HI>New-York,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide page 425.</NOTE> with <HI>three hundred and fifty pounds sterling,</HI> as a frontier government; and therefore exposed to a much greater expence, in proportion to other colonies; which I called the last Assembly to take into their consideration, and they were pleased, for the reasons then given, to refer to this.</P>

<P>After this the Assembly presented to him ano∣ther address, consisting of twenty-one articles. It respected his successor, in the government, and
<PB N="439" REF="032729_0439_0FF4F4F7B45552D8"/>
the confirmation of certain privileges, therein spe∣cified. To every one of which he made a special answer. The first of these articles, so far as re∣garded a proper person to succeed him, as Deputy, being particularly insisted on, he condesended so much as to make them an offer, to nominate a substitute themselves! From which, acknowledg∣ing the favor offered them, they modestly excused themselves; declaring they did not think them∣selves qualified for the choice, and desired to leave it to the Governor's pleasure. The rest of the petition of this address (which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Ap∣pendix, No. 5.</NOTE> with the Gover∣nor's answer, may be seen in the appendix No. 5) so far as the Proprietary thought proper to com∣ply with it, was either afterwards granted, in the two charters of the province and city, then in agitation, or otherwise mutually agreed, to gene∣ral satisfaction; though in some parts of it, the Assembly had meddled with his property, in such a particular manner, as, he declares, was not pro∣perly cognizable by them, in that capacity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>"At a Council held in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the 26th of the Seventh-mouth, 1701.</P><P>Present: The Proprietary and Governor.</P>

<P>THE Governor having desired a conference with the Assembly, they attended, requesting to know his pleasure.</P>
<P>The Governor signified to them, that, in his speech, he had recom∣mended to them, to consider their privileges as well as property, in which he had justly given privileges the precedency to property, as the bulwark, to secure the other; but they, in their address (which he had considered) insisted not only on property alone, but upon such particulars as could, by no means, be cognizable by an Assembly; and lay only between him and the particulars concerned: In which he had done, and always would do, to the utmost, what becomes an honest man, to all those he agreed with;—but he would never suffer an Assembly to intermeddle with his property, lest it should be drawn into a precedent, if it should please God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Governor should preside here, distinct from the Proprietary, &amp;c.</P>

the 7th. of the Eighth-month, he spoke to them in Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His speech to them.</NOTE><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Members of Council present were:—</P><P>Edward Shippen, Thomas Story, Samuel Carpenter, Caleb Pusey, John Guest, Griffith Owen.</P></NOTE> and told them, "That the Assembly was then enacting a law, according to their desire, to prevent their being abused by selling of <HI>rum</HI> among them; that he requested them to unite all their endeavours, and their utmost exertion, in conjunction with those of the government, to put the said law in execution.</P>
<P>At the same time he likewise informed them, "That now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extract from the Minutes of Council.</NOTE> this was like to be his last interview with them, at least before his return;—That he had always loved and been kind to them; and ever should continue so to be, not through any politic design, or, on account of self interest, but from a most real affection:"—"And he desired them, in his absence, to cultivate friendship with those, whom he should leave behind in authority; as they would always, in some degree, continue to be so to them, as himself had ever been;—Lastly, That he had charged the members of Council, and then also renewed the same charge, that they should, in all respects, be kind to them, and entertain them with all courtesy and demonstrations of good-will, as himself had ever done: which the said members promised faithfully to observe;—then, after mak∣ing them some presents, they withdrew."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disagree∣ment be∣tween the Province &amp; Territories.</NOTE>But during these transactions, and while the charter of privileges was under consideration and preparing, the disagreement, which had before ap∣peared, between the members of Assembly for the the province and those for the territories, began again to exhibit itself, and grow worse, tending to an open rupture. The territory men were said to have been for obtaining some exclusive powers, or rights, particular to themselves, which, being
<PB N="441" REF="032729_0441_0FF4F4F94793A6C8"/>
thought unreasonable, could not, therefore, be granted them; and not being able to carry their point, on the 10th. instant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disagree∣ment be∣tween the Province &amp; Territories.</NOTE> the members for the territories abruptly left the House; declaring their intention of returning to their respective homes. But, on the 14th. most of them appeared before the Proprietary, in Council, remonstrating against some proceedings of the Assembly, on the 10th. instant, which, they declared, were, in their con∣sequences, highly injurious and destructive to the privileges of the <HI>lower counties,</HI> and which, consis∣tent with their duty to their constituents, they ap∣prehended, they could not sit there, to see carried on; and, therefore, they informed the Governor, they thought it best for them to depart to their re∣spective habitations:—</P>
<P>The Proprietary further enquired into the affair and both heard and answered all their reasons and objections; and then told them, "That he took this their conduct very unkind, even to himself in particular."</P>
<P>Upon which <HI>Jasper Yeates,</HI> in behalf of the rest, endeavoured to excuse, or further explain, their behaviour, in this action, by declaring their great affection and regard for the Proprietary, but, that they must be true to those, whom they repre∣sented.—</P>
<P>At another meeting of the Proprietary and Mem∣bers of Council, on the same day, the Assembly being sent for, both those for the province, and the secluding members appeared;</P>
<P>The Proprietary told them, "That his time being short, he must come briefly to the point; that it was no small wound to him, to think, that at the <HI>earnest desire</HI> of the <HI>lower counties,</HI> as well as the <HI>good-will</HI> of the <HI>upper,</HI> he had engaged in an un∣dertaking, which cost him, at least, two or three thousand pounds, to unite them, and yet, that they should now endanger that union, and divide, after
<PB N="442" REF="032729_0442_0FF4F4A2F3F792D8"/>
they had been recognized as one, not only by the King's <HI>commission</HI> to Governor <HI>Fletcher,</HI> but also by his <HI>letters patent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣prietor en∣deavours to <HI>reconcile</HI> the Province &amp; Territories.</NOTE> for his own restoration, and the King's several letters:—he, therefore, would not have any thing <HI>resolved</HI> on, but what was consider∣ate and weighty, lest it should look as unkind, and now, at his departure, carry a very ill report of them to <HI>England."</HI></P>
<P>The territory members objected, that they were great sufferers by that act of union, however it was, at first, intended; and could not support the burden of the charge.</P>
<P>The Proprietary replied, "They were free to break off, and might act distinctly by themselves;" at which they seemed pleased, and expressed their satisfaction; "But then," continued the Proprietary, "it must be upon amicable terms, and a good un∣derstanding;—That they must first <HI>resolve</HI> to settle the laws;—and that, as the interest of the <HI>province,</HI> and that of those <HI>lower counties</HI> would be insepara∣bly the same, they should both use a conduct con∣sistent with that relation," &amp;c.</P>

<P>WILLIAM PENN arrived at Portsmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1701.</NOTE> about the middle of December. But after his return to <HI>England,</HI> the bill, before mentioned, for reducing the proprietary governments, into regal

Soon after this, or, on the 18th. of the First-month, 1701-2, King <HI>William</HI> died; and the Princess <HI>Anne,</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> succeeding to the throne, commenced her reign with moderation and clemency.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Penn in favor at Court, &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>William Penn,</HI> being in the Queen's favour, was often at court; and for his conveniency, on that account, he took lodgings at <HI>Kensington;</HI> where, at his leisure hours, he writ several useful and ex∣cellent treatises, on divers subjects; for the instruc∣tion and benefit of posterity; which may be seen in his works.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor Hamilton's administra∣tion and death.</NOTE>Governor <HI>Hamilton's</HI> administration, in <HI>Pennsyl∣vania,</HI> after the Proprietary's departure, continued only till the Twelfth-month in the next following year, 1702, when he died: The principal part of which was taken up in endeavouring an union be∣tween the province and territories, in legislation; respecting which the Proprietary, by his presence and authority, had prevailed on them to a present compliance: For they had not yet accepted the new charter; and they had three years allowed them to signify their refusal. For this purpose <HI>Hamilton</HI> laboured much with them, and used many arguments to induce them to unite, but without success. Upon his death the government devolved on the Council, <HI>Edward Shippen</HI> being President.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pro∣vince and Territories agree to a separation.</NOTE>During this time of dispute, or endeavours, for an union between the Representatives of the pro∣vince and territories, not much other public busi∣ness of importance appears to have been transacted in the affairs of the government. The latter per∣sisted in an absolute refusal to join with the former, in legislation, till it was finally, in the year 1703, agreed and settled between them, that they should compose different and distinct Assemblies, entirely
<PB N="455" REF="032729_0455_0FF4F50ED2F754D8"/>
independent on each other; pursuant to the liberty, allowed by a clause in the charter, for that pur∣pose; which clause was said to have been there in∣serted by the particular and special means of the Representatives of the territories, with previous full intention of the separation, which ensued; and in this capacity they have ever acted since that time.</P>
<P>The province now, by charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assembly for the Pro∣vince, &amp;c.</NOTE> also claimed a separate Representative of its own, consisting of eight members, for each of the three counties, and two, for the city of <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> which members, being, in October 1703, convened and duly qualified, according to law, their first <HI>Reso∣lution</HI> was in the following words—<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Note.</HI> "At an Assembly begun at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in October, one thou∣sand seven hundred and three,</P><LETTER>

<P>WE, whose names are hereunto subscribed, elected Representatives by the freemen of the respective counties, in this province of <HI>Pennsylva∣nia,</HI> and the city of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in pursuance of the Proprietary's charter to serve in Assembly, do, each of us for himself, solemnly promise and declare, that we will be true and faithful to Queen <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>And we, and each of us, do solemnly and sincerely profess, testify and declare, That we do believe, that, in the sacrament of the Lord's supper, there is not any transubstantiation of the elements of bread and wine into the body and blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> at, or after the consecration thereof by any person whatsoever; and that the invocation, or adoration of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> or any other Saint, and the sacrifice of the <HI>Mass,</HI> as they are now used in the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> are superstitious and idolatrous.</P>
<P>And we, and each of us for himself, do solemnly profess, testify and declare, That we do make this declaration, and every part thereof, in the plain and ordinary sense of the words read unto us, as they are com∣monly understood by <HI>English</HI> Protestants, without any evasion, equivoca∣tion, or mental reservation whatsoever; and without any dispensation already granted for this purpose by the Pope, or any other authority whatsoever; or without any hope of any such dispensation from any per∣son, or authority whatsoever; or without thinking that we are, or can be, acquitted before God or man, or absolved of this declaration, or any part thereof, although the Pope or any other person or persons, or power whatsoever, should dispense with, or annul, the same, or declare that it was null and void from the beginning.</P>
<P>And we, the said subscribing Representatives, and each of us, for himself, do solemnly and sincerely profess faith in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ, his eternal Son, the true God, and in the Holy Spirit, one God, blessed for ever more; and we do acknowledge the holy scriptures to be given by divine inspiration.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They re∣fuse the Go∣vernor a co∣py of what they writ, &amp;c.</NOTE>Some time after, when the Governor heard of this, he, by a written message to the House, re∣quired a copy of it; which was likewise done by a formal petition from seven persons; who were all, either of the Governor's Council, or otherwise of the principal inhabitants, and <HI>Quakers,</HI> viz. <HI>Ed∣ward Shippen, Thomas Story, Richard Hill, Willi∣am Hudson, Pentecost Teague, Thomas Chalkley,</HI> and <HI>William Southby;</HI> these, with many others, consi∣dering the present ill humour of the Assembly, thought themselves highly interested in the nature of such a proceeding; but they were all peremto∣rily refused by the Assembly.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="032729_0461_0FF4F5A2359525D8"/>What effect which these proceedings had with the Proprietary in <HI>England,</HI> may, in part, appear from the Governor's speech to the Assembly, in the forepart of the year 1705, in which, among other things, he thus expresses himself, respecting the Proprietary's sentiments on the causes of his differ∣ing with the Assembly, and of their letter to the Proprietary, viz.</P>
<P>"The Proprietary, Gentlemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1705. Part of the Gover∣nor's speech to the As∣sembly, &amp;c</NOTE> is so far from agreeing with your opinion, in these matters, that he is greatly surprised to see, instead of suitable sup∣plies, for the maintenance of government, and de∣fraying public charges, for the public safety, time only lost (while his constant expences run on) in disputes upon heads, which he had as fully settled before his departure, as could, on the best precau∣tions, be thought convenient, or reasonable, even, at a time, when he was leaving you in doubt whe∣ther it would be possible to divert the bill, then moving in Parliament, for annexing all these go∣vernments to the crown; which being now diverted, and himself secure in the possession of his right, so long as his circumstances shall render the adminis∣tration of it practicable, he is the more astonished to find you, for whose sakes chiefly, and not his own, he has undergone the late fatigues, and ex∣pensive troubles, in maintaining it, express no greater sense of gratitude, than has hitherto ap∣peared.</P>
<P>"The Proprietary also further assures us, that had those three bills (of which copies were sent home) been passed into acts here, they would cer∣tainly have been vacated by her Majesty, being looked on by men of skill, to whom they have been shewn, as very great absurdities; but, what I must not be silent in is, that he highly resents that hei∣nous indignity, and most scandalous treatment he has met with, in a letter, directed not only to him∣self, but also to be shewn to some other persons,
<PB N="462" REF="032729_0462_0FF4F54FEF20E548"/>
disaffected to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1705.</NOTE> in the name of the Assembly and people of this province, of which I have formerly demanded a copy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of the Governor's speech, &amp;c.</NOTE> but was then denied it, under pretence (when it was too late) that it should be re∣called: If that letter was the act of the people truly represented, he thinks such proceedings are suffici∣ent to cancel all obligations of care over them; but if done by particular persons only, and 'tis an im∣posture in the name of the whole, he expects the country will purge themselves, and take care that due satisfaction be given him.—</P>

He died in the island of <HI>Tortola,</HI> in America, in the year 1741, when on a religious visit there, in the service of preaching the gospel.—Though he had not the advantage of what is called a literary education, or of much learning, yet he lest behind him some printed works on religious subjects, and a journal of his life, (from which the above account is extracted) written in a plain and simple, yet very easy and engaging stile; which were an acceptable legacy to many lovers of his memory.</P></NOTE> The <HI>Indians,</HI> who consisted chiefly of <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Shawanese,</HI> received them with great kindness: they were much affected by their visit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen Ojuncho.</NOTE> more especially a certain woman of emi∣nence among them, who appeared to have autho∣rity, and spoke much in their Councils; the reason for which was, when the <HI>Indians</HI> were asked, one of them replied, "Because some women are wiser

than some men, and that she was an Empress among them;"—She told <HI>Thomas Chalkley,</HI> and the other friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen Ojuncho.</NOTE> that she looked upon their coming to be more than natural; because they did not come to buy nor sell, nor yet gain, but in love and respect to them, and desired their welfare both here and hereafter.—She related to them a dream, which she had three days before; which, being interpreted was, "That she was in <HI>London,</HI> and that <HI>London</HI> was the finest place she ever saw, (it was like <HI>Phi∣ladelphia,</HI> but much larger) and she went across six streets, and in the seventh she saw <HI>William Penn</HI> preaching to the people; which was a great multi∣tude; and both she and <HI>William Penn</HI> rejoiced to see each other, after the meeting she went to him, and he told her, that in a little time, he would come over and preach to them also; of which she was very glad: and now, she said, her dream was ful∣filled; for one of his friends was come to preach to them." And she advised the <HI>Indians</HI> to hear and treat the friends kindly; which they accordingly did.—</P>
<P>This one instance, among many, which might he given, is here mentioned, to shew the love and re∣gard, these people had for the memory of <HI>William Penn;</HI> as the consequence of his just and kind treatment of them; and the sense which they had of his regard for their real good, and true hap∣piness.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>GOVERNOR EVANS appears to have been an active young man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1705.</NOTE> of a temper scarcely indiffe∣rent to any thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gov. Evans did not at∣tend suffici∣ently to the disposition of the peo∣ple, &amp;c.</NOTE> zealous to promote what he thought the service and interest of the Proprietary required, but not sufficiently studying the genius and disposition of the people, over whom he presided. His warm zeal to push his own views, in some things, contrary to those of the Assembly, tended to pro∣duce such extreme opposition and dislike between them, as were scarcely warrantable, and might have had fatal effects; the natural consequence of men's tempers being too much agitated and inflam∣ed; besides the liberties of his private life and con∣duct are represented to have been such as rendered him offensive to a sober and religious people. He
<PB N="468" REF="032729_0468_0FF4F5531908D810"/>
was moreover said to want neither ingenuity nor abilities, so much as a proper application of them; for which years and experience are so generally re∣quisite. But his disappointment, on his first arri∣val, in not being able to prevail on the Assembly of the province to admit of a re-union with that of the territories, which he had so much set his mind upon, with the nature of certain following pro∣ceedings of the former, appear to have occasioned his imprudently joining with the Assembly of the latter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He joins with the Assembly of the territo∣ries to in∣commode the Pro∣vince.</NOTE> in some acts, which seemed more calculated to incommode the province, than for any real uti∣lity to either; from which kind of conduct it could not be reasonably supposed any good understanding could arise, or be long cherished, between them.</P>
<P>The Governor had endeavoured to form a militia through the government, but so far as appears, and which could not be reasonably expected other∣wise, not with much success. He knew the <HI>Qua∣kers'</HI> principles were against bearing arms and war, yet, as the inexperience and assuming of youth, as well as the prejudice of more advanced years, is sometimes ready to regard a contrariety of senti∣ment, in others, more especially if it differ much from the common opinion, in the highest point of absurdity, without duly examining into the merits of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He treats the Quakers principles against war, as absurd.</NOTE> so Governor <HI>Evans,</HI> by part of his conduct, appears to have regarded and treated the principles of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> in respect to <HI>self defence,</HI> as a mere notion, which would never endure a serious trial; and by the following imprudent scheme and experiment, instead of answering any useful inten∣tion to the public, he is said not only to have alien∣ated the <HI>Quakers</HI> further from him, but also high∣ly disgusted such of the people in general, as were not concerned in the contrivance, or execution of it.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Evans,</HI> in conjunction with <HI>Robert French</HI> of <HI>Newcastle, Thomas Clark,</HI> an attorney at
<PB N="469" REF="032729_0469_0FF4F5B155335670"/>
law, of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1706.</NOTE> and some others of his asso∣ciates, it is said, for their diversion, and to try the disposition of the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the false alarm, &amp;c.</NOTE> but most probably that of the <HI>Quakers</HI> chiefly, concerted a scheme to raise and carry on a <HI>false alarm,</HI> in order most effectually to terrify the inhabitants by a sudden surprize, and thereby oblige them to have recourse to arms, for their defence.</P>
<P>It was at the time of the fair in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on the 16th. day of the Third-month, O. S. 1706, when this plot was put in execution; <HI>French</HI> acted at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> by sending up a messenger to the go∣vernor, at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in the greatest haste, and apparent consternation, to acquaint him, that a number of vessels were then actually in the river, and as high up as a place, which he named. Up∣on this news immediately the Governor acted his part; and, by his emissaries, made it fly through the city; while himself with a drawn sword in his hand, on horseback, rode through the streets, in seeming great commotion, and a behaviour adapted to the nature of the occasion, commanded and entreated people of all ranks to be properly assisting on the emergency, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There were two noted <HI>false alarms</HI> formerly, in the province. The former was that of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in 1688. The latter was this, in Go∣vernor Evans's time; to one of which <HI>Thomas Makin,</HI> before mentioned in the notes, page 211; seems to allude, in the following lines, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LG>

</LG><LG>
<L>But once to arms <HI>false</HI> rumor called here;</L>
<L>To which the people commonly give ear.</L>
<L>'Twas on a certain day the plot began,</L>
<L>Deluded crowds together madly ran:</L>
<L>By artful means the stratagem was laid,</L>
<L>And great commotions through the city made;</L>
<L>So wild the tumult, and so great the fear,</L>
<L>No law nor order was observed there:</L>

<L>One urg'd, another orders gave to stay.</L>
<L>This strange affair, whatever was design'd,</L>
<L>For loss to many, will be kept in mind.</L>
<L>The ev'ning did the plot's design betray;</L>
<L>The farce was ended with the closing day.</L>
</LG></NOTE></P>
<P>The stratagem, in part succeeded; and the sud∣denness of the surprise, with the noise of precipi∣tation
<PB N="470" REF="032729_0470_0FF4F55FBA82D9F0"/>
consequent thereon, threw many of the people into very great fright and consternation, in∣somuch that it is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the false alarm, &amp;c.</NOTE> some threw their plate and most valuable effects down their wells and little-houses; that others hid themselves, in the best manner they could, while many retired further up the river, with what they could most readily carry off; so that some of the creeks seemed full of boats, and small craft; those of a larger size running as far as <HI>Burlington,</HI> and some higher up the river;— Several women are said to have miscarried by the fright and terror, into which they were thrown, and much mischief ensued.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It was observed, that, in an <HI>Almanac</HI> published this year, in <HI>Phila∣delphia,</HI> was inserted the following distich, opposite to this very time, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LG>
<L>"Wise men wonder, good men grieve,</L>
<L>Knaves invent, and fools believe."</L>
</LG></NOTE></P>
<P>But the design, it is said, was suspected, or un∣derstood, by the more considerate part of the peo∣ple, even at the beginning; and endeavours accord∣ingly were used, to prevent its taking effect; but the conduct and artifice of the Governor, with the help of his numerous assistants, and the easy cre∣dulity, common to the more inconsiderate part of mankind, very much frustrated these endeavours, till the first transport of amazement had subsided.</P>
<P><HI>James Logan,</HI> the Secretary, though he was one of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> was accused or suspect∣ed, of being privy to the affair. He denied the
<PB N="471" REF="032729_0471_0FF4F520474C0AC0"/>
charge; but endeavoured to palliate the action, and excuse the Governor; which rendered him the more suspected. The design,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the false alarm, &amp;c.</NOTE> though it had such a considerable effect, turned out entirely contrary to the expectation of the authors and promoters of it; for the people were soon undeceived; and when they saw how grossly they had been imposed upon, many of them so highly resented the usage, that the authors and promoters thereof were now obliged to consult their own safety from the fury of an en∣raged populace.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> it is said the principal part of them were attending their religious meeting as usual, on that day of the week, even in the midst of the confusion; and, as if they were aware of the design, in general, behaved themselves so far con∣sistently, that only four persons, who had any pre∣tence to be accounted of that society, appeared un∣der arms, at the place of rendezvous, appointed on the occasion.</P>
<P>With this action, whereby the Governor render∣ed himself odious to the generality of the inhabi∣tants of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> may be mentioned the follow∣ing; by which he incurred, in a particular manner, the displeasure of the trading part of the province.</P>
<P>Soon after the Assembly of the territories had met in legislation, independent of the province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the fort and exac∣tions at Newcastle, &amp;c.</NOTE> Governor <HI>Evans</HI> proposed to them the building a fort at <HI>Newcastle;</HI> upon which a law was passed there, entitled, <HI>"An act for erecting and maintain∣ing a fort, for her Majesty's service, at the town of Newcastle upon Delaware."</HI> This law imposed a duty of half a pound of <HI>Gun-powder,</HI> for every ton, that all vessels whatever, coming from the sea up the river, should measure by the carpenters rule, whose major part was not owned by persons resid∣ing on the river and bay of <HI>Delaware;</HI> (except ships of war) and by it all vessels, both inward and outward, were obliged to stop, drop anchor, and
<PB N="472" REF="032729_0472_0FF4F5614EA19B00"/>
the commander to go on shore, make report, and have leave to pass; from the commanding officer of the said fort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the fort and exac∣tions at Newcastle, &amp;c.</NOTE> under penalty of paying five pounds, besides twenty shillings for the first gun, thirty for the second, and forty for every gun afterwards, that should be fired on the occasion, in case of ne∣glect, besides the forfeiture of five pounds, for contempt, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This law was considered as a manifest infraction of the privileges granted by the royal charter to the settlers and inhabitants of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> and still more so, from the manner in which it was put in execution; for they had legally an undoubted right to the free use of the river and bay, without any interruption, obstruction or imposition from any quarter whatever; and the violent means which consequently became necessary to enforce a law upon such a defective foundation, and not even counte∣nanced by the law itself, soon became a great nui∣sance, and an intolerable grievance to the trading part of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and others concerned in its commerce.—Besides, it was alledged, that the fort itself, as it was situated and circumstanced, had it been under better management and more warrant∣able direction, could not possibly be much security to the river, nor protection to the vessels that might happen to be chased, or assaulted in it.</P>
<P>The city of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> was much concerned at these proceedings, and the trading part thereof were highly incensed at this invasion of their just liberties; accordingly endeavours were used to have the affair properly redressed, but without success.</P>
<P>At length <HI>Richard Hill,</HI> one of the Governor's Council, a bold man, and of considerable abilities and influence in the province, together with <HI>Isaac Norris</HI> and <HI>Samuel Preston,</HI> all <HI>Quakers,</HI> and men of the first rank and esteem, was determined to try
<PB N="473" REF="032729_0473_0FF4F5B2E53F2800"/>
to remove this nuisance, by a different method from any that had been yet attempted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>These three persons being men of considerable note and eminence, either at this time, or afterwards, in the province, a short sketch of their character, as I find it in M. S. here follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P><P><HI>Richard Hill</HI> was born in <HI>Maryland,</HI> brought up to the sea, and after∣wards settled in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> having there married the widow of <HI>John Delaval, Hannah,</HI> the eldest daughter of the late Governor <HI>Lloyd,</HI> a wo∣man of an excellent character, and very much esteemed and beloved.— He was twenty-five years a member of the Governor's Council, divers times Speaker of the Assembly, held several offices of trust, was, for se∣veral years, first Commissioner of property, and, during the last ten years of his life, he was one of the Provincial Judges.</P><P>His services, in the religious society of his friends, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> of which he was, for many years, an active member, are said likewise to have been very considerable He had by nature and acquisition such a constant firmness, as furnished him with undaunted resolution, to execute what∣ever he undertook. His sound judgment, his great esteem for the <HI>English</HI> constitution and laws, his tenderness for the liberty of the subject, and his zeal for preserving the reputable order established in his own religious community, with his great generosity to proper objects, qualified him for the greatest services, in every station in which he was engaged, and ren∣dered him of very great and uncommon value, in the place where he lived. He died in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on the 9th. of September, 1729.</P>
<P><HI>Isaac Norris,</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> held many public offices, with great re∣pution and honour; and his services, in the affairs of his own religious community, entitled him to very high and uncommon esteem among his friends the <HI>Quakers;</HI> in which he was a principal person in good offices. He is said to have been endowed with good natural abilities; which he improved and applied to the benefit of mankind, as a man truly sensible that one of the chief ends of man's existence is to be useful and beneficent to the human race; which he shewed by his uniform conduct; and that to answer this end men are to be taken as they are, and their lesser fail∣ings to be endured, where they cannot be amended; the utility of his great talents was manifested by a prudent and consistent conduct, in which he so much the more effectually succeeded and excelled, and that agreeable to duty and a good conscience, by constantly cherishing a temper and disposition of mind, which overlooks or passes by the many dislikes, de∣ficiencies and ungrateful things, in others, which are so commonly incident to mankind; so that, by preserving through life, a christian moderation, and an even hand, he was, on all occasions, qualified to use and exert his abilities to more advantage: His example in this was noble and conspi∣cuous, and his character, in most respects, so honourable among men, in general, and his conduct so universally beneficial, especially to those of his own religious community, that he was an ornament to his country and profession, and his death a great loss to both; which was in the year 1735, when he was Chief Justice of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P><P><HI>Samuel Preston,</HI> likewise of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> was, for a long time, one of the Governor's Council, and Treasurer of the province of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> which offices he discharged with much honor and fidelity. He was a man of great integrity to what he believed was his duty; his conduct in life, very instructive, and his practice a continual series of good offi∣ces. He was a person of such remarkable benevolence, and open dis∣position of mind, as rendered advice and reproof, from him, the more acceptable and serviceable; and being of a fair and clean character, good judgment, and suitable presence of mind, his usefulness, in that capacity, was the more extensive and successful. He was a very valuable mem∣ber of society, among his friends, the <HI>Quakers,</HI> undertaking and per∣forming many difficult offices, and social duties therein, with great chear∣fulness, alacrity and utility; and was highly esteemed by them, as an elder, who ruled well in his social capacity, and was worthy of double honor.—He died in September, 1743 aged about eighty years.</P><P>The worth of wise and virtuous men is inestimable, and their loss to the community, not easily repaired.

<P>But <HI>Richard Hill</HI> did not suffer the affair to rest here; for, accompanied by a large number of the inhabitants of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> he attended the Gene∣ral Assembly; and, by petition, in such manner, laid the affair before them, that it produced an ad∣dress to the Governor, from the House, without so much as one dissenting vote, dated the 10th. of May, 1707, highly resenting these proceedings, on the river <HI>Delaware,</HI> and at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which I do not find were afterwards continued.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This address was as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P><LETTER>
<HEAD>"To <HI>John Evans,</HI> Esquire, by the Queen's royal approbation, Lieute∣nant Governor of the province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and of the three lower counties of <HI>Newcastle, Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> on <HI>Delaware</HI> river.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The humble <HI>Address</HI> of the Representatives of the freemen of the said province, in General Assembly met, the 10th. day of the month called May, 1707, sheweth,</HEAD>
<P>THAT a petition of above two hundred and twenty of the merchants and other inhabitants of the said province, but mostly of the city of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> having been presented to this House, complaining of very great abuses and oppressions, which some of the inhabitants of the county of <HI>Newcastle</HI> have committed upon several of these petitioners, by colour of a certain ordinance, or act of Assembly, lately passed there by the said Lieutenant Governor, and Representatives of the freemen of the said three lower counties, entitled <HI>"An act for erecting and maintaining a fort for her Majesty's service, at the town of Newcastle upon Delaware;"</HI> which act, as also the several affidavits, relating to the matter complained of, being read, we thought proper, in the first place, to consider the royal charter of the late King Charles the second, to the Proprietary, bearing date the fourth day of March, in the three and thirtieth year of his reign, whereby the free and undisturbed use and continuance in, and passage unto, and out of, all the ports, harbours, bays, waters, rivers, isles and inlents, belonging unto, or leading to, or from this country, with the other powers and liberties, mentioned in the said petition, are granted to the Proprietary and inhabitants of this province, as the petitioners set forth; and we further observe, that by the said charter, the Queen's liege people of this province are to be subject to no laws, but such as are consonant to reason, and as near as may be, agreeable to the laws, statutes and rights of the kingdom of England.</P>
<P>In the next place we have inspected the late Duke of <HI>York's</HI> deeds of feoffment to the Proprietary, for the said three lower counties, as also the late King <HI>Charles</HI> the second's grant to the Duke, for the same lands; and when we call to mind how the Representatives of the lower counties broke off, and refused to proceed legislatively, in conjunction with the Representatives of the province, under the Proprietary's administration; but how far they can be justified in making laws to raise money on the Queen's subjects in this government, we intend shall be further considered hereafter; in the mean time we shall insist that the liberty of the free use, and passage to, and out of, the ports of this province, granted us by the above recited royal charter, is well warranted by the laws of <HI>England;</HI> and that no imposition can, by any act, or ordinance, made at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> be laid upon any vessel, bound to, or from, any port in this province, which doth not unload at some key, or place, within the said lower counties; and we conceive, that upon a strict examination of their said act of Assembly, it will most evidently appear, that the vessels not bound to, or out of, some port or place there, cannot legally be obliged to comply with the impositions of the said act.</P>
<P>Therefore this house, having fully and maturely weighed the nature of the said act, and the use that is, and has been made of it, found them∣selves obliged, in duty to the Queen, and justice to the people they re∣present, to come to the following resolutions, N. C. D.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That it is the opinion of this House, that the laid act of Assem∣bly might be by the Governor, intended for the Queen's service, and secu∣rity of her subjects, yet the manner of putting the same in execution proves an apparent violation of the said royal charter, as well as the common and statute laws of <HI>England,</HI> and is destructive to trade, and tends to the depopulating and ruin of this province.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is the opinion of this House, that the firing of shot at the sloop <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in the several affidavits mentioned, when she was duly cleared, at this port of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> as the acts of navigation direct, and had the Governor's <HI>Let-pass,</HI> and upon her voyage to <HI>Barba∣does,</HI> is not warranted by the said act of Assembly; but that those, who fired at the said sloop, after they had notice what she was, and how she was cleared, ought to be prosecuted, as persons committing hostilities against the Queen's liege people.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That it is the opinion of this House, that, in case the master of the said sloop had been liable to pay either <HI>Powder-money,</HI> or other <HI>mulets,</HI> imposed by the said act, yet the forcing him out of the vessel, and imprisoning him, when security was offered, for answering the supposed offence, is not warranted by the said act, but is most illegal and arbitrary.</P>
<P>We, having thus presented our opinion of the said act, entreat, that thou wouldst use the most effectual methods to put a speedy stop to the said exorbitant practices, great abuses and oppressions, mentioned in the said petition (a copy whereof we humbly lay before thee;) and that the authors of these arbitrary actions and oppressions complained of, may be prosecuted according to law, and be no longer permitted to abuse the Queen's authority, and stand in open defiance of her royal <HI>Uncle's</HI> grant, obstruct our lawful commerce, and invade our liberties, rights and pro∣perties, and under the pretence of fortifying the river, for the service of the Queen, commit hostilities and depredations upon her liege people.</P>

of the House, the draught of a bill, which he had prepared for that purpose, as being better, and more suitably adapted, than the act which had been repealed.—This the Assembly not only re∣jected, but drew up one themselves, instead of it, so widely different, that the Governor and they were not able to agree to certain particulars con∣tained in it; which were alledged by the Governor, as tending to <HI>"break in upon the Proprietary's powers of government, or his just interest;"</HI> and, after much dispute and altercation, and time spent to no pur∣pose, the Governor proceeded, by an ordinance, in such case provided in the royal charter, to open the courts of justice, till further, or better provi∣sion and regulation should be made by act of As∣sembly.</P>
<P>The House being disappointed in not carrying their point, in the manner they desired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. Lloyd heads the Assembly, &amp;c.</NOTE> were very much chagrined.

<PB N="478" REF="032729_0478_0FF4F52EEFA31950"/>
by his constant opposition to the claims of the Pro∣prietary. Having failed in this their contest with the Governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against James Lo∣gan, &amp;c.</NOTE> the Assembly, in the next place, were determined, if possible, to take their revenge on the Secretary, <HI>James Logan,</HI> who was also one of the Council; and they accordingly pointed the force of their resentment against him; whom they regarded, in great measure, as the cause of their miscarriage, in the bill of courts, and of much of the misunderstanding between them and the Go∣vernor.</P>
<P><HI>James Logan</HI> was a man of considerable under∣standing and abilities, perhaps exceeded by few, or none,<NOTE PLACE="marg">James Lo∣gan sup∣ports the Proprieta∣ry's inte∣rest, &amp;c.</NOTE> in the province; he espoused and firmly supported the Proprietary's interest, and had great influence in the Council; but to persons of inferior abilities and less acquirements, he is represented by some, not always to have conducted himself in that courteous and condescending manner, which gains respect, and is an ornament to superior parts; which rendered him somewhat unpopular, and sometimes provoked his enemies to carry their ani∣mosity against him to unwarrantable extremes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>"James Logan</HI> was descended of a family originally from <HI>Scotland;</HI> where, in the troubles of that country, occasioned by the affair of Earl <HI>Gawrie,</HI> in the reign of <HI>James</HI> the VI. his grandfather, <HI>Robert Logan,</HI> was deprived of a considerable estate; in consequence of which his father, <HI>Patrick Logan,</HI> being in reduced circumstances, removed into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and fixed his residence at <HI>Lurgan,</HI> the place of his son <HI>James's</HI> birth. <HI>Patrick Logan</HI> had the benefit of a good education, in the university of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> where he commenced master of arts;—but afterwards joined in religious society with the <HI>Quakers.</HI>—This, his son, <HI>James Logan,</HI> being endowed with a good genius, and favoured with a suitable education, made con∣siderable proficiency in divers branches of learning and science; after which he went to <HI>England;</HI> from whence, in the year 1699, and about the 25th. of his age, he removed to <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> in company with <HI>William Penn,</HI> in his latter voyage to <HI>America;</HI> and, in 1701, he was, by commis∣sion from the Proprietary, appointed Secretary of the province, and Clerk of the Council for the same.</P><P>His life was afterwards much employed in public affairs:—The depart∣ment allotted him, in the time of the Governors, <HI>Evans</HI> and <HI>Gookin,</HI> ex∣posed him to much altercation with <HI>David Lloyd,</HI> then at the head of the Assembly, as Speaker, and a large number that joined him. He adhered to what was deemed the proprietary interest; and exerted himself with great fidelity to it. He held the several offices of Provincial Secretary, Commissioner of property, Chief Justice, and for near two years, govern∣ed the province, as President of the Council.—</P><P>Many years before his death he retired pretty much from the hurry and incumbrance of public affairs, and spent the latter part of his time, prin∣cipally at <HI>Stanton,</HI> his country seat, near <HI>Germantown,</HI> about five or six miles from <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> where he enjoyed, among his books, that leisure in which men of letters take delight, and corresponded with the literati in different parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> He was well versed in both ancient and modern learning, acquainted with the oriental tongues, a master of the Latin, Greek, French and Italian languages; deeply skilled in the Mathe∣matics, and in natural and moral philosophy; as several pieces of his own writing, in Latin, &amp;c. demonstrate; some of which have gone through divers impressions, in different parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and are highly esteemed: Among his productions of this nature, his <HI>Experimenta Meletemata de plantarum generatione,</HI> or his <HI>Experiments on the Indian corn, or Maize of America,</HI> with his observations arising therefrom, on the generation of plants, published in Latin, at <HI>Leyden,</HI> in 1739, and afterwards, in 1747, republished in <HI>London,</HI> with an <HI>English</HI> version on the opposite page, by Dr. <HI>J. Fothergill,</HI> are both curious and ingenious.—Along with this piece was likewise printed, in Latin, at <HI>Leyden,</HI> another treatise, by the same author, entitled, <HI>"Canonum pro inveniendis refractionum, tum simplicium, tum in lentibus duplicium focis, demonstrationes geometricae."—"Autore Jacobo Logan. Judice supremo et Praeside provinciae Pensilvaniensis, in America."</HI>— And, in his old age, he translated <HI>Cicero's</HI> excellent treatise, <HI>De senectuta;</HI> which, with his explanatory notes, was printed in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> with a preface or encomium, by <HI>Benjamin Franklin,</HI> afterwards Dr. <HI>Franklin,</HI> of that city, in 1744.—He was one of the people called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and died on the 31st. of October, 1751, aged about 77 years;—leaving, as a mo∣nument of his public spirit and benevolence to the people of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> a library; which he had been fifty years in collecting; (since called the <HI>Loganian Library</HI>) intending it for the common use and benefit of all lovers of learning. It was said to contain the best editions of the best books, in various languages, arts and sciences, and to be the largest, and by far the most valuable, collection of the kind, at that time, in this part of the world.</P><P>He had several children, who survived him; of whom his eldest son <HI>William,</HI> lately deceased, was many years a member of the Governor's Council.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>The nature and length of this, and other disputes, with the dislike and odium,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Assem∣bly disgust∣ed with the Governor's conduct, &amp;c.</NOTE> which some parts of the Governor's private conduct, are said to have created, in the more sober part of the inhabitants, by his frequently descending below the dignity of his station, in midnight revels, and low frolicks of youthful folly, very much lessened his authority, and raised the spirit of party to a higher degree, than had been known before. The consequence of which was, what is generally that of all extremes, the product of things more or less indefensible, on both sides: a detail of which proceedings, as they are published in the journals, or votes of the house of Assembly of those times, would be too tedious here to be minutely stated.—They produced a number of accusations against the Secretary;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They im∣peach the Secretary;</NOTE> which the Assembly stiled <HI>articles of impeachment.</HI> Upon these the Assembly took measures to impeach him in form, before the Governor, as an evil counsellor, and guilty of high misdemeanors;—But through the Governor's management and protection, they were not able for the present,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But are dis∣appointed, &amp;c.</NOTE> to effect any thing further against him; and there is on record his pe∣tition to the Governor and Council, requesting that proper measures should be taken to clear his cha∣racter from the false representations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Votes of Assembly, &amp;c.</NOTE> and gross abuses of the Assembly, by a fair trial.</P>

<P>That he had appointed wood-rangers, at large, over the located lands of the inhabitants, in com∣mon with those of the Proprietary; for which he had no right; in which accordingly they took up strays, &amp;c. in an indiscriminate manner; which ought to have been restricted solely to the Proprie∣tary's lands.</P>

Whilst that bill was depending, Mr. <HI>Joshua Gee</HI> and others, who were mortgagees, under the said Mr. <HI>Penn,</HI> petitioned the House of Commons for relief; wherein they represented that Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> having purchased of the <HI>Indians</HI> their title to that country, had by his industry and great charge, improved the country and established con∣siderable colonies therein, whereby he had very much impared his estate, in <HI>Europe;</HI> and that, in the year, 1708, to clear a debt contracted for set∣tling and improving the said colonies, he had borrowed of the said mort∣gagees £ 6,600, to whom he had mortgaged the said province, and all the powers of government."</P><P><HI>Note.</HI> The names of the mortgagees were, <HI>"Henry Gouldney</HI> of <HI>London, Joshua Gee, Silvanus Grove, John Woods,</HI> of the same place; and <HI>Tho∣mas Callowhill, Thomas Oade</HI> and <HI>Jeffry Pennell,</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and <HI>John Field</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Cuppage</HI> of <HI>Lambs-town,</HI> in <HI>Ireland."</HI> M.
