<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM cxix. 116.</BIBL>
<Q>—<HI>Let me not be ashamed of my Hope.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> are the two governing Pasa sions of the Soul; which excite us to Action: so it is of Concern to us, to know how to improve them so as to promote our Happiness. And as we should im∣prove our Fears of the Wrath of God and eternal Tor∣ment, so as to quicken us to flee from the Wrath to come, and to fly to the Refuge to lay hold on the Hope set before us in Christ Jesus; So we should use our Hope, with a View to this great End.</P>
<P>It is greatly to be feared, that many have such a slender and sandy Foundation of their Hope, that when they shall expect, that they are just entring into the Possession and Enjoyment of what they hoped for; they shall find themselves mistaken and disappointed: which is what the Psalmist deprecates in our <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' he may, in this, have some Reference to his Hopes of outward good Things agreable to the Pro∣mise of God to him; yet it appears to me, that he has Respect especially to future and eternal Things in this pathetick Prayer; (<HI>Let me not be ashamed of my Hope.</HI>)</P>
<P>We are not to expect to find a Connection of one Part with another, in this admirable Psalm; and there∣fore I shall consider the Words in an abstracted View: as a Prayer of holy <HI>David,</HI> (who was doubtless the Composer of this Psalm, under the Influence and In∣spiration of the Holy Ghost.)</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005029_0004_100E689069B63518"/>And as this Prayer implies the Danger of our being deceived as to our Hopes of Happiness and Salvation hereafter; so it shews us the great Necessity there is of our having our <HI>Hopes</HI> of future Happiness so well grounded, that they may not <HI>make us ashamed,</HI> as the Apostle expresses it, in Rom. 5. 5. or as in the Text, that we may <HI>not be ashamed of our Hope</HI>: both of which may be considered (by divine Assistance) under this Doctrine, which I think is very plain from the Words, viz.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> It highly becomes every one of us, to labour and pray, that our Hopes of Happiness and Salva∣tion in the World to come may be built on such Foundations that we may not be asham'd thereof.</P>
<P>All Men in general (I believe) cherish some Hopes that they shall be happy, or at least not miserable, af∣ter Death; whether they have any Foundation for such Hopes or no: the most profligate Sinners flat∣ter themselves that God will be merciful to them; but how few are there that lay a good Foundation for their Hopes! and how few that frequently and carefully enough examine the Grounds and Foun∣dations of their Hopes of Happiness!</P>
<P>It is certain that as the Hope of true Believers shall not make them ashamed, so there is the <HI>Hope of the Hypocrite</HI> which shall perish. Job 8. 13, 14.—And <HI>the Hypocrite's Hope shall perish; whose Hope shall be cut off; and whose Trust shall be as the Spider's Web.</HI></P>
<P>Hence in as much as our eternal Happiness is so nearly concerned in it, it appears to be of the high∣est Importance to us, to see to it that the Hope we have of eternal Life; be not that of the Hypocrite; but a sure well grounded Hope, of which we shall never be ashamed.</P>
<P>It must be observed here, that a Person may be said (in the Sense of our Text) to be <HI>ashamed of his
<PB N="7" REF="005029_0005_100E6891EAC92FA0"/>
Hope when he is disappointed or frustrated of the Enjoy∣ment of those Things which he Hopes for.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hope has Reference to Things to come</HI>: what we pos∣sess and enjoy we don't hope for: and as he that comes to enjoy all which he hoped for can't be said to be <HI>ashamed of his Hope</HI>; so Shame and Confusion will cover them, who, instead of the good Things they hoped for, shall find themselves frustrated and disappointed; and made miserable. This with Re∣spect to future and eternal Things will be most a∣mazing: How dreadful will it be for a Person to die. full of Hopes of the Joys and Glories of Heaven and to find instead thereof that he is sent down to the Place of Torment!</P>
<P>What I further propose, for the Proof and Illus∣tration of this Doctrine is; to consider and show;</P>
<P><HI>1.</HI> What that Hope of Salvation, is, which is good and well grounded, and so will not make such as have it, a∣shamed: and what that Hope is which will make such as rest in it ashamed. <HI>And 2.</HI> to offer some Considerati∣ons for the Proof of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and to convince us, of the Necessity of our striving and praying, that we may all have an Hope of Salvation which we shall not be a∣shamed of.</P>
<P>And as these Things are of great Importance. I hope I shall have your serious and diligent Atten∣tion, to what (by divine Help) I shall offer.</P>
<P>And first I am to consider, <HI>What that Hope of Sal∣vation is, which is good and well grounded, and so will not make: those that have it, ashamed: And what that Hope is which will make such as rest in it ashamed.</HI> And I shall endeavour so, to describe these, as that we may be the better able to distinguish between a true and false Hope of Happiness hereafter.</P>
<P>And that I may be the more easily understood, I shall consider these Things distinctly and apart, by
<PB N="8" REF="005029_0006_100E68939B0D8D68"/>
which they will mutually reflect Light on each o∣ther. Agreeably I would consider first, <HI>What a good and well-grounded Hope of Salvation is, which will not make such as have it ashamed.</HI> And then secondly, <HI>Confider what that false Hope is, which such as rest in it, shall be ashamed of.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I am to consider and show what that good and well-grounded Hope of eternal Happiness and Salvation is; which will not make such as have it ashamed: be∣cause it will not deceive them at last; but they shall certainly enjoy the glorious and blessed Things, which they hope for.</P>
<P><HI>Hope</HI> in general; <HI>is an Expectation, hereafter to pos∣sess and enjoy something which we esteem good, and think will tend to our Happiness; and so desire it and suppose upon proper Endeavours, we may obtain it.</HI> This is a general Description of Hope. We don't hope for what we now enjoy; nor for any Thing which is not in our Esteem Good; nor for what we think, it is impossible we should ever obtain. For altho' we might with for a good Thing which we are sen∣sible cannot be obtain'd. Yet we can't be faid pro∣perly to hope for it. And if our Endeavours to ob∣tain what we desire and hope for, are not included in Hope, yet they are excited by it.</P>
<P>Now the Hope intended in my Text (as I under∣stand it) and which I am now to consider; is—the Hope that we shall hereafter enjoy, all those glori∣ous Things which <HI>Christ</HI> has purchased; and <HI>God</HI> has in the Covenant of Grace mercifully promised to his <HI>chosen</HI> People; even the Favour of <HI>God,</HI> and the full Vision and Enjoyment of him; and so com∣pleat and everlasting Happiness and Glory, Or a firm Expectation that we personally shall be brought in the World to come (being conformed to the I∣mage of God) to partake of that Fulness of Joys
<PB N="9" REF="005029_0007_100E689622570FB8"/>
which is in his Presence, and those Rivers of Plea∣sures which flow at his right Hand for evermore. And to flatter our selves with such an Hope and Expectation, and after all, to find ourselves disap∣pointed, is a Thought which may justly fill us with Concern of Soul.</P>
<P>Now that I may be the better understood, I would observe that even such as are not yet converted and brought into Christ; especially if they are under Convictions, may so far have Hope of this great Happiness; that if they are now up and doing work∣ing out their own Salvation with Fear and Trem∣bling, if they conscienciously and diligently attend and improve all the Means of Grace which God has appointed, cherish their Convictions, &amp; strive with all their Might: and so wait on God. I say if they do so, they may hope that God will, of his rich and free Grace, through Christ, work his whole Work in them and the Work of Faith with Power; that he will give them a true saving Faith in Christ, and unseigned Repentance of Sin; that he will convert them and that they shall upon their Repentance and closing with Christ, become in titled to eternal Life and Salvation, and as this should support such and keep them from Despair; so it ought to excite them to the most diligent seeking and striving to obtain Grace and Mercy.</P>
<P>But the Believer has an Hope different from this. He hopes that God has already of his rich and free Grace, thro' Christ and by his Holy Spirit, wrought in his Heart those Things upon which he is now become intitled to all these glorious Things, that he is become a <HI>Child of God</HI> and so an <HI>Heir of God and joint Heir with Christ to that Inheritance which fades not away,</HI> Rom. 8. 17.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005029_0008_100E6898A6FA5908"/>But in as much as some that do thus hope they are in the Way to eternal Life may be deceived, it may be proper to consider the Foundation on which our Hopes of Happiness hereafter must be laid, so that it may be sure and <HI>not make us ashamed</HI>: with some of the Fruits and Properties of it.</P>
<P>And here, I would say, the Grace, Mercy and Goodness of God, is the first Foundation of our Hope of Happiness in the World to come, from this Originates our Hope of Salvation. The whole of that glorious Contrivance of the Salvation of Sinners arises and flows from the Mercy of God; which moved him to compassionate our Misery, and sat his infinite Wisdom on Work, to contrive and bring a∣bout a Method, (every Way agreeable to his adora∣ble Excellencies, Perfections and Attributes) for our Salvation.</P>
<P>Indeed it is of the free, rich Grace and Mercy of God that we are saved. Every Thing that is done by God in Order to our Salvation: and Salvation itself flows from free Grace. Eph. 2.8. <HI>By Grace are ye saved through Faith, and that not of yourselves it is the Gift of God.</HI> But then it would nevertheless be unsafe to hope for eternal Life, meerly because, God is merciful, they that are in eternal Misery will never be happy although God is a Being of infinite; Mercy, no! he is inexorable to all their Crys and Lamentations. We may by no Means depend on the uncovenanted Mercy of God.</P>
<P>If ever we obtain saving Grace and Mercy it must be in God's own Way, in that Method in which all his divine Attributes and Perfections will be glorified and which is revealed to us in the Gospel, in which Life and Immortality are brought to Light.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005029_0009_100E689A28E836B8"/>And this is only in and by our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Covenant of Grace, and so agreeable to the Promises of God in the Covenant, which are in Christ Yea and Amen. Although God be infinitely merciful, although he be in and through Christ the Father of Mercies and God of all Grace and Conso∣lation, and in him is reconciling the World to him∣self; yet out of Christ he is a consuming Fire, and will by no Means clear the Guilty, and it is in vain for us, to hope to obtain Mercy unless we seek it in that Way in which alone God is pleased to be∣stow it, and therefore it appears, that it is the Righ∣teousness of Christ, it is his Obedience, Sufferings, and Intercession, that is the Foundation on which we must build our Hopes of obtaining the Mercy of God to everlasting Life; and this also in the Way of the Covenant of Grace, and agreeable to the most gracious Promises in it.</P>
<P>And then further the Righteousness of Christ must be made our own, that is it must be imputed to us, and we must be made Partakers of his Bene∣fits, by the Application of them to us by the Holy Spirit, in Order to our Justification and Salvation; And we must become intitled to the Mercies pro∣mised in the Covenant. For although there is a full and happy Provision made for Sinners in Christ, al∣though there be a Covenant of Grace made with Believers in him, and exceeding great and precious. Promises; yet if we never come to Christ, and em∣brace him by Faith so as to be united to him; if we don't acquiesee in the Way of Salvation by him, and receive him on his own Terms: If we don't come into the Covenant of Grace, and lay hold on the Promises. What Benefit and Advantage will all this be of to us? <HI>He that believeth not shall be damned,</HI> Mark 16. 16. If Christ be the chief of ten
<PB N="12" REF="005029_0010_100E689CAF0FAB20"/>
Thousand and altogether lovely; yet if we can't say with the Spouse, Cant. 2. 16. <HI>My Beloved, is mine and I am his.</HI> How shall we be the better for him? Although there be Merit enough in Christ for the Salvation of all that will come to him; yet can we expect to partake of his Merits, and Benefits, unless we come to him in his own Way therefor?</P>
<P>Still further, however gracious God is, whatever Provision is made for us in Christ, and in the Cove∣nant; yet since <HI>no unholy Thing can enter into Heaven</HI> Rev. 21. 27. And <HI>without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord,</HI> Heb. 12. 14. It will follow hence that we, who are by Nature unholy, impure, and defiled, and Children of Wrath; must be converted, changed, renewed and sanctified, in Order to our obtaining that Heaven of Happiness, which we hope for: And in Order to our being renewed and sanctified by the blessed Spirit, (who is God that sanctifies us) we must be, (by the same Holy Spirit,) enlightned in the Things of God, convinced of the evil and ac∣cursed Nature of Sin, as it is against the Nature, Attributes and Perfections of God, and a Violation of his Law, and a dreadful Abuse of his unequalled Mercy and Grace, many Ways discovered to us; but especially in giving us such a glorious Saviour: And also of our own personal Guilt, that we ourselves are the very Persons who are guilty. And we must be brought to a real unseigned Hatred of all and e∣very Sin, considered as Sin; and to a real Conversion or turning from Sin unto God.</P>
<P>Agreeably, having observed these Things, I may proceed to say, in order to lay the Foundation of our Hope of future Happiness and Salvation, deep and sure, and to have such an <HI>Hope as we shall not be ashamed of.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005029_0011_100E68A0427C94D8"/>We must come to be well satisfied and assured, that we have been enabled to comply with the Terms on which Salvation is promised. In a few Words, here, more particularly,</P>
<P>They that have a good and well grounded Hope, that they are now Heirs to Glory; are such as have good Reason to be satisfied, that they have been tru∣ly and really convinced of Sin; and been brought to an hearty Sorrow for it, that they have in them a real Hatred of all Sin, as Sin, that they have truly repented of all and every Sin and that a real Change is wrought in them, that they are <HI>turned from Dark∣ness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to the living God.</HI> That <HI>old Things are passeed away</HI> in them and <HI>all Things are become new,</HI> that they are <HI>born again</HI> and <HI>created a new in Christ Jesus unto good Works which God ordain'd that they should walk in them.</HI> And that they have been enabled, by the Grace and Spirit of God (in Concurrance with their Endeavours) to close with Christ on his own Terms; to come intirely out of themselves, renouncing all Dependance on their own Righteousness, or any Thing that they can pos∣sibly do to receive Christ as their Prophet, Priest and King, as their <HI>Lord</HI> as well as <HI>Christ</HI>; and so to put over all the Concerns of their precious and immor∣tal Souls into his Hands. And <HI>that their Hearts are purified by Faith</HI> and their <HI>Faith works by Love.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever has a well-grounded. Assurance of this, that these Things are wrought in and for him; has a good and sure Hope of eternal Life and Salvation, he may lay hold on the Promises, (being united to Christ) and rest satisfied in the never-failing Faith∣fulness of him that has promised: and so may go on his Way rejoicing. If our Hope be indeed built on these Principles, on this Foundation, we shall never be ashamed of it,</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005029_0012_100E68A1C39A2E20"/>But that I may be as plain as possible, and that you may the better judge whether the Hope you now have be indeed well grounded. Consider whether you find in you, the Fruits and Consequents, and the distingiushing Properties of such an Hope, or those Things that accompany it; such as these.</P>
<P>Do you upon a serious and close Examination, find that the Bent, Biass and Inclination of your Souls, and Minds are to God to Religion and Holiness? Do you take Pleasure in Meditating on God, his Di∣vine Perfections and on his Word, and in Commu∣nion with him? Do you love his House, Worship, Ordinances, and his Ministers for their Work Sake; and the Image of God, and such as bear his Image? <HI>We know we are passed from Death to Life because we love the Brethren,</HI> 1 John 3. 14.</P>
<P>And do you find that you have in you a true habi∣tual Hatred of Sin and of all Sin? Is there no darl∣ing Sin which you hug in your Bosoms, and secretly role as a sweet Morsel under your Tongue?</P>
<P>Again do your Hopes of Happiness make &amp; keep you meek, humble, and lowly in Mind, so that in Meekness and Lowliness of Mind, you esteem others better than your selves? They that have a good Hope will have this Temper of Mind, <HI>Meekness, Love, Gentleness,</HI> and <HI>Goodnefs,</HI> are reckoned up a∣mong the genuine <HI>Fruits of the Spirit</HI> that dwells in Believers, Gal. 5. 22. We shall have great Reason to suspect the Foundation of our Hope, if our Hope puffs us up, makes us proud, self-conceited and cen∣sorious. Of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>Further, are you willing and desirous to come to the Light, and to have the Foundation of your Hope thro'ly search'd &amp; try'd? It is a very dark Sign, if we are backward and loath to trust the Foundation of our Hope to Examination, that we our selves suspect that
<PB N="15" REF="005029_0013_100E68A4474367D0"/>
it is not good, and yet are too willing to be deceived. Our Saviour says John 3. 20, 21. <HI>For every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light least his Deeds should be reproved. But he that doth Truth cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God.</HI> We should consider therefore whether it be our hearty Desire and Prayer, that God would discover us to ourselves, and give us to know our true State and Condition, whatever Un∣easiness the Knowledge of it might now give us. Can we heartily pray as in 26 Psal. 2. <HI>Examine me, O Lord, and prove me, try my Reins and my Heart.</HI> And 139th Psalm 23, 24. <HI>Search' me, O God, and know my Heart, try me and know my Thoughts, and see if there be any wicked Way in me, and lead me in the Way ever∣lasting.</HI></P>
<P>Let me add, do you find that the more you search yourselves and try the Grounds of your Hope, the better you are satisfied that your Hope is good? If so this is a good Token that your Hope is laid on a good Bottom.</P>
<P>Still further, doth your Hope of Salvation quicken you, to cleanse and purify yourselves from all Sin, and Uncleanness, make you more earnest in your En∣deavours to be holy in Heart and Life? This is an essential Property of a good Hope, 1 John 3.3. <HI>And every Man that hath this Hope in him purifieth himself e∣ven as he is pure.</HI> If your Hope be a good and well-grounded Hope you will find that it will excite and stir you up to labour and strive to be more and more holy and pure, more religious and virtuous, to be more like God.</P>
<P>You will not then rest in a bare slender Hope but will be <HI>giving all Diligence to make your Calling and E∣lection sure.</HI> 2 Pet. 1. 10. They that think low De∣grees of Grace eno', and that if they once come to
<PB N="16" REF="005029_0014_100E68A5EC382120"/>
have some Hope of Happiness it is sufficient, or that they have already attained Grace enough to carry them to Heaven and so are easy; have great Rea∣son to fear they have no Grace at all. Grace is of a growing Nature; Prov. 4. 18. <HI>The Path of the just is as the shining Light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect Day.</HI> And every one that has a good Hope will find some such Temper in him as the Apostle ex∣presses in Phil. 3. 12. V and on, which read. They that have Grace will desire more and never think they have enough of it here.</P>
<P>I would just add further here, doth your Hope of Salvation, make you rejoice more in Communion with God, and in the Manifestations of his Favour, than in the outward Gifts of his Providence? This, the Psalmist mentions 4th Psal. 6, 7. <HI>There be many that say, who will shew us any Good? Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou hast put Gladness in mine Heart, more than in the Time that their Corn and their Wine increased.</HI> The clearer our Hopes and Views of heavenly Joys are, the less will our E∣steem of and Love to earthly Things be. And the clearer our Evidences are that we are converted and in the Way to Happiness, the greater will be our Joy and Comfort. Our Comfort will arise in Proporti∣on, to the Evidence we have that our Hopes are well-grounded.</P>
<P>It should be observed here, that such as have in∣deed a good Hope, may sometimes be under Clouds and Darkness, they that <HI>fear the Lord and obey the Voice of his Servant</HI> may be left to <HI>walk in Darkness and see no Light,</HI> 50th Isai. 10. And <HI>the Comforter that should relieve their Souls</HI> may be <HI>far from them,</HI> Lam. 1. 16. And this may arise sometimes partly from bodily Indispositions; more commonly from the Carelessness of such, they being off their Guard, and
<PB N="17" REF="005029_0015_100E68A89F4F1F18"/>
so exposed to and overcome by Temptations: And falling into some Sins which grieve the Holy Ghost and cause their <HI>Beloved to withdraw,</HI> Cant. 5. 2.—A∣gain, this may arise in some, partly from comparing their Experiences and Grounds of Hope, more with those of others; than with the Rules in the Word of God. If Persons don't find in themselves those Things which some others tell them they have expe∣rienced; although upon a full Examination they may have as good Reason of their Hope; yet this may cause Doubts to arise even in the Heart of a Believer. And it must be said we need the Assistance of the Holy Ghost, in examining the Grounds of our Hope, and to enable us to see our true State, and to <HI>witness with our Spirit that we are the Children of God,</HI> Rom. 18.17. And we shall not clearly see the Foundation (which may be laid in us) to hope for Happiness, without the Help of the Spirit, so as to have <HI>no Doubts</HI>; but if after all, in your dark Hours, you find your <HI>Hearts wake</HI> like the Spouse's forementioned Cant. 5. 2. And your <HI>Hope is as the Anchor of your Souls</HI>: Which sup∣ports and bears you up under all your Distresses and Difficulties, and you have the Witness of your own Spirits, that your Hope is built on the Foundation I have above mentioned, you may be satisfied it is a good Hope.</P>
<P>There are other Marks in Scripture (agreeable to these) by which you may try the Foundation of your Hope; but I believe if you carefully and impartial∣ly and frequently examine yourselves by what has been said, you may come to a satisfactory Conclusion, whether you have such an Hope as will not make you <HI>ashamed</HI> or not.</P>
<P>I shall only add, if we could be fully satisfied in this important Point, we must be frequent, serious and impartial in our Self-Examination and in com∣paring
<PB N="18" REF="005029_0016_100E68AB23303978"/>
ourselves with the Marks of true Believers; we must be constant in the Use of Means ; and we must be much in Prayer to God, to assist us herein, and to discover to us what Foundation of Hope we have ; and to give us the Testimony of his Spirit with ours, that we are his Children, and have a good Hope, and if we obtain this, we shall have <HI>Joy un∣speakable, and full of Glory.</HI> But this will receive fur∣ther Light from the Consideration of that Hope which will make such as have it ashamed. To which I now (as I proposed) proceed.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, I am to consider, <HI>What that ill-grounded and false Hope is, of which, such as have it, shall be asha∣med, and some of the Properties of it.</HI></P>
<P>And this being contrary to this good Hope, you may very much judge what it is, by what has been already said, for they illustrate each other. So that I need but little more than repeat some Things which have been already mentioned; and show that that Hope which is founded on Things contrary thereto, or very different therefrom is a false Hope and with∣out good Grounds.</P>
<P>It is an awful and awakening Consideration, that so many hope for Happiness without any good Ground and Foundation. Their Hope is no better than a vain Presumption. And if such could see what their Condition really is, and how groundless their Hope, now; as they will (if not before) when it will be forever too late to rectify the dreadful Mi∣stake: It might serve to excite them to endeavour after a better Hope. That many do deceive them∣selves with a vain Hope is very plain from what I have before said, and from Job 11. 20. <HI>But the Eyes of the wicked shall fail, &amp; they shall not escape &amp; their Hope shall be as the giving up of the Ghost.</HI> And Job 18.14. <HI>His Confidence shall be rooted out of his Tabernacle, and it
<PB N="19" REF="005029_0017_100E68ADAAC29C08"/>
shall bring him to the King of Terrors.</HI> 27 Chap. 8 v. <HI>For what is the Hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul</HI>? It is supposed here (you see) that Persons may have an Hope of Happiness and yet perish, and oh how dreadful will this be! Let this Consideration awaken your Atten∣tion to what may be said in showing what a false Hope is, and excite you to see to it that you be not deceived by such an Hope. And that you may be the better able to judge whether your Hopes of Hap∣piness be not built on some false Foundation: I shall offer a few Things under this Head to your serious Consideration. Such as</P>
<P>First, <HI>If our Hope of Happiness is built on the Mercy of God, consider'd separately from the Merits of Christ and the Covenant of Grace it is a false Hope.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be feared that too many hope to be happy hereafter, only because, they think God is merciful and gracious; all the Foundation of their Hope is the <HI>uncovenanted Mercy</HI> of God. But this is no good Foundation; for altho'our Hopes of Happiness are founded on the Mercy and Grace of God, yet (as I have before shown) it is thro' the Merits of Christ, and in the Way of the Covenant of Grace. It is thro' Christ and in Covenant that we may hope for eternal Mercy. It is presumption to hope for Salvation without Christ, and unless we receive it in the Chan∣nel of the Covenant and Promises of God in it. To hope for Mercy, therefore, without any Considera∣tion of Christ, the Covenant of Grace and the Pro∣mises, is to hope without good Grounds.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, <HI>Our Hope of Salvation, while we have, no Reason to think we have an Interest in Christ, that we are in the Covenant of Grace, and so intitled to the Pro∣mises of Salvation and Happiness; is without a good Foundation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="005029_0018_100E68AF8E94BA20"/>The Mercy of God, the Merits of Christ, and the exceeding great and precious Promises of the Gospel, will be of no further Advantage to us than we be∣come interested therein.</P>
<P>I am afraid many build their Hope of Heaven and Happiness upon this, that there is Mercy in God, Merits enough in Christ, and many gracious Promi∣ses in the Word of God; but never carefully enough examine to see, whether they themselves, have com∣ply'd with those Terms upon which they become in∣titled to any of them. They don't (as they should do) carefully and throughly enough examine, whe∣ther they have intirely come out of themselves and renounc'd all Dependance on themselves, and emp∣tied themselves of all Confidence, in their own Me∣rits, or Righteousness, whether they don't depend on their Faith (as a Work by which they merit) or their Repentance or Morality; And whether they have with their whole Heart embraced the Lord Je∣sus Christ in all his Offices, as their Prophet, Priests, and King, as their whole and alone Saviour. And yet whether they have any good Reason to hope they have done these Things (by the Help of the Spirit) or no, they vainly flatter themselves they are in the Way to be saved by Christ.</P>
<P>I must (in Faithfulness) tell you, Brethren, that whatever other Foundation of Hope you may flat∣ter yourselves you have; yet if you are still Unbe∣lievers, if you have never closed with and embrac'd the Lord Jesus Christ on his own Terms, if you have never heartily laid hold on the Covenant of Grace and given up yourselves in it, and so have not laid hold on the Promises by Faith; your Hope is not built on a good and sure Foundation, and you may expect to be ashamed of it at last.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>If you are not truly converted and born a∣gain,
<PB N="21" REF="005029_0019_100E68B215A36DC0"/>
gain, if you are not become new Creatures, and yet hope you are now in the Way to Salvation, your Hope is vain and groundless.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</HI> says our Saviour, John 3.3. and the Apostle speaks to the same Purpose, 2 Cor. 5. 17. <HI>If any Man be in Christ Jesus be is anew Creature, old Things are done away in him, and behold all Things are be∣become new.</HI> Now unless we find these Things in us what Grounds of Hope can we have? Every Change doth not lay a good Foundation of Hope. A Man may be very greatly changed in his outward Conversation, and experience some Change in his Heart; and yet never feel, never experience an u∣niversal Change in his Heart, Soul, andi whole Na∣ture. A Person may be under very strong Convicti∣ons, and be brought to see Things, in some Measure different from what he did before; and may have a considerable Change wrought in him: he may for∣sake many Sins, and comply with many Duties out∣wardly; and yet all this while never have his Heart really changed, nor his Mind renewed He may not have any true Hatred of Sin, considered as Sin; for then he would hate all Sin. Nay he may have some joy and seeming Pleasure in Things of Religion. And what he may mistake for the <HI>Joy of the Holy Ghost,</HI> and yet have no true, hearty Love to God, and our Saviour, nor perform any Duties from a Principle of Love to God, Hatred of Sin, Faith in Chrirst, and Obedience to God. But this is no good Hope. It may be just observed here, that although Faith in Christ, and Repentance of Sin (which is in∣cluded in this Conversion) be very different in their own Nature, yet they are never separated in a Per∣son; he that believes aright in the Lord Jesus Christ, repents of his Sins, and is converted: And so on the
<PB N="22" REF="005029_0020_100E68B4AB939BF0"/>
contrary. And Repentance and this true real Change in our Hearts, (which will influence our Lives, of which hereafter) is necessary to be found in us, in order to our having a good Hope of Salvation. With∣out Conversion we can't be happy hereafter. I am sensible the Work of Sanctification will not be per∣fected in this Life; but yet it must be here begun; and you must be sanctified (if not perfectly here) yet throughout, in every Part, Power, and Facul∣ty of your Souls; you must be <HI>wholly,</HI> that is in every part <HI>sanctified, and your whole Spirit, Soul, and Body</HI> must be <HI>preserved blameless</HI> (in some Measure) <HI>unto the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> 1 Thess. 5. 2, 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. Doth the Hope you have of Salvation and Happiness make and keep you humble, meek and lowly? If not, you have Reason to fear it is no better than the Hope of an Hypocrite.</P>
<P>A true and well-grounded Hope, has always this Fruit and Effect that it humbles the Soul that has it, a good Foundation of Hope can't be in the same Soul, where Pride and Self-Conceit, especially spiritual Pride is cherished and reigns. He that has a good Hope will be ready in Meekness and Lowliness of Mind to esteem others better than himself: But a false Hope, the Hope of an Hypocrite is apt to puff Men up with Pride, Vain-Glory, and Self-Conceit; they that have such an Hope, are apt to esteem themselves bet∣ter than others; to proclaim their own Goodness, and to despise, judge and censure others. Think not that I speak this of myself without Authority, for faith not the Scripture the same Things, what less doth our Saviour teach us in the Account he gives us of such a Pharisee in Luke 18. 10. and on, <HI>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God I thank thee, that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, Un∣just,
<PB N="23" REF="005029_0021_100E68B7320D7230"/>
Adulterers or even as this Publican;</HI> How he boasts of himself and despises his Neighbour! <HI>Charity is not puffed up,</HI> 1 Cor. 13. 4. Nor doth it <HI>envy</HI> others nor <HI>vaunt itself.</HI> If your Knowledge and spiritual Expe∣riences and Hope of Happiness which you pretend to, make you proud, and to think highly of your∣selves, and meanly of others, and if they make you uncharitably to any; you have great Reason to fear yours is no better Hope and built on no better Foun∣dation, than the Hope of this Pharisee, and yet our Sa∣viour tells us the Publican he so much despised was ju∣stified rather than he. The great God speaking of such as say to others, <HI>Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou,</HI> says, <HI>these are a Smoak in my Nose, a Fire that burneth all Day</HI>: And threatens to reward them accordingly, 65 Isai. 5, 0.</P>
<P>Once more 5thly, <HI>If your Hope doth not purify you, and quicken you to do all you can to be free from all Sin, all Pollution both in Heart and Life; you have Reason to fear it is without Ground.</HI></P>
<P>If we would evidence to ourselves and others that our Hope of Salvation is built on a sure Foundation, we must do it by bringing forth <HI>Fruits, meet for Repen∣tance.</HI> Matth. 3. 8. An unholy Heart and Life can't be consistent with a good Hope.</P>
<P>A good Divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mead.</NOTE> says, you may hope for Heaven, while you are doing the Work of Hell: you may hope for Salvation while you are working out your own Damnation; you may hope in God, and yet ne∣ver choose him for your Portion. A good Hope pu∣rifies the Heart (as you have heard) and will excite us to endeavour to have a <HI>pure Heart, and clean Hands.</HI> 24. Psal. 4. but a false Hope is used as a covering for Sin, Jer. 7. 8. and on.</P>
<P>If our Hopes of Happiness are on a good Founda∣tion, they will raise our Hearts and Affections, a∣bove
<PB N="24" REF="005029_0022_100E68B903B72430"/>
the Things of this World. This World and the Things of it will appear vain and trifling in the Eyes of him who has a good Hope of the infinitely grea∣ter and better Things of another. He that has this Hope will disapprove every Thing that tends to hin∣der his Coming to enjoy what he hopes for, and ap∣prove every Thing that may help him forward to the Enjoyment of the desired Good, but to enlarge no further (although more might be said here) I have endeavoured to show you how you may in some good Measure know, whether the Foundation which you build your Hopes of Salvation upon be good or no. And so whether you shall be likely to be ashamed of your <HI>Hope</HI> or not. And I hope what has been said may be of Service to satisfy you herein. And this may suffice for the first Thing I proposed to consider under the Doctrine. I proceed now to the second, Viz.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>To offer some Considerations, for the Proof of the Doctrine, and to convince us, of the Necessity of our striving and praying that we may all have an Hope of Salvation, on such good Grounds, as that we shall not be ashamed of it.</HI></P>
<P>The Psalmist without Doubt had as good and well grounded an Hope, as any of us have or can expect to have here; and yet you see, he (in the Text) prays to God that he might <HI>not be ashamed of his Hope.</HI> And as he pray'd for this, so, doubtless, he also en∣deavour'd in the Use of proper Means, to have his Hope so well-grounded that he might not be asham∣ed of it at Death, at the Judgment and in the coming World. The Doctrine then naturally arises from die Text.</P>
<P>And without Doubt it is of great Concern to us all, to labour, strive, and pray; that we may have such
<PB N="25" REF="005029_0023_100E68BB8E5F94A8"/>
an Hope as shall not make us ashamed: as most cer∣tainly all such Hopes will, as are not laid on a good and sure Foundation. The Text plainly supposes an Hope that will be disappointed. And the wise Man observes, Prov. 10. 28. <HI>The Hope of the Righteous shall be Gladness; but the Expectation of the Wicked shall pe∣rish.</HI> And if <HI>Hope deferred maketh the Heart sick; but when, the Desire cometh it is a Tree of Life</HI>? As Prov. 13. 12. How dreadful will be the Shame and Confu∣sion of those who hope for Happiness and Salvation after Death and yet shall find themselves disap∣pointed!</P>
<P>But it may be proper, under this Head, to give some Reasons of the Doctrine, or Motives to ex∣cite us to labour and pray for a good Hope, and se∣veral important Reasons may be briefly offered.</P>
<P>And besides what is said in our Text, and such o∣ther Texts as show this to be our Duty and Interest, I would further offer the following Things to Consi∣deration, some of which may excite our Fear, others our Hope, and Endeavours. Viz.</P>
<P>First, <HI>We should labour and pray that we may have a good Hope, because, if we don't, we shall be in great Danger of having a false and ill-grounded Hope which we shall be ashamed of.</HI></P>
<P>The Thoughts of eternal Torment, are so shock∣ing: that few, if any, can bear them; hence most, if not all Men, find something or other, as a Foun∣dation of Hope to escape this; and it is greatly to be feared, that the greater Part of Mankind, have a bad Foundation of Hope. And even those that en∣joy the greatest Priviledges and make the highest Profession of Religion, are in Danger of this; unless they with much Care and Prayer lay the Foundation: at first, deep and sure, and then also often search the Foundation, to see if it be indeed such as will not
<PB N="26" REF="005029_0024_100E68BE1072DC78"/>
fail. We read of some chat have <HI>made Shipwrack of Faith, and a good Conscience.</HI> 1 Tim. 1. 19. And the very Possibility of such a Thing, should quicken us to the greatest Care that we be not like them. It is not so easy a Matter to gain such a good Hope, as we shall with for hereafter, as some may think it is, there are too many <HI>build this on the Sand,</HI> to allude to that of our Saviour, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7. 24. and on. There are many false and unsafe Foun∣dations on which Men build their Hopes: And we have Hearts in us naturally, which are <HI>deceitful above all Things and desperately wicked.</HI> Jer. 17. 9. We have also a very subtle Devil, who without Doubt doth all he possibly can, to prevent our laying a good Foun∣dation of Hope, because so long as he can keep us from this, he has much Reason to think he shall de∣stroy us. He is very willing we should hope for Happiness provided our Hope be on a false Founda∣tion.—Hence it appears, that unless we are very careful, diligent and prayerful, we shall be in great Danger of a false Hope. It requires much Study, much Meditation, and close Examination to lay a good Foundation of Hope If you only reflect and consider what I have before mentioned as good Grounds of Hope, you will see, that unless we strive labour and use all appointed Means, there will be no Reason to expect a good Bottom to build our Hopes upon, we must believe, repent, be converted and born again, in order to our having good Reason to hope that we shall partake of the saving Grace and Mercy of God through Christ. And surely if we will not labour to lay a good Foundation of Hope we can't expect it. And then we never can have a sure and good Ground of Hope unless the Foundation be laid in us by the Holy Spirit, working the Work of God in us. Which shews us the Necessity of our
<PB N="27" REF="005029_0025_100E68BF9260A6A0"/>
praying to God for the Spirit. Let me add here, as there is Need of our Endeavours and Prayers in or∣der to have a good Ground of Hope; so there is al∣so, in order to our seeing and knowing this that so we may have the Comfort of it. <HI>We should give all Diligence to make our Calling and Election sure.</HI> 2 Pet. 1. 10. And as we greatly need the Assistance of the Spirit, in our Self-Examination, and to <HI>witness with our Spirits,</HI> so we must seek him of God, if we would obtain such a Priviledge. We have no sufficient Ground to expect to have a good Foundation of Hope, nor a comfortable Sense thereof; unless we labour and pray therefor. But I proceed to consider,</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>We should labour and pray that we may have a good and well-grounded Hope; because of the great Disadvantages, and infinite Danger there is in having a false Hope, which will make us ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>There is not only Danger, that we shall rest in a false Hope; but there is as much or more Danger of us, if it should be our unhappy Condition to build our Hopes on the Sand, and to satisfy ourselves with an Hope that will deceive us.</P>
<P>There are some Persons, who never had any great Advantages to know any Thing of Religion, and the Way and Method of Salvation, by Jesus Christ, (which is the only Way:) and others although they have had the great Priviledges of the Gospel; yet never had any Awakenings and Convictions; but the meer Convictions of natural Consciences, and this has been so bribed and blinded by their prevail∣ing Lusts and Temptations and the Deceitfulness of Sin; that they have never fixed on any Foundation of Hope, which, upon the least Reflection and Exa∣mination can be thought good. They may hope for Mercy on Account of this, they think God is graci∣cious and merciful, and will not, did not make Crea∣tures,
<PB N="28" REF="005029_0026_100E68C368114B30"/>
on Purpose to make them miserable; and so satisfy themselves. Now there is great Danger of such as these; especially if they have enjoy'd good and powerful Means of Grace, and continued long in this Case and contracted Habits of Vice and Sin. <HI>Can the Etheopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? Then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do Evil.</HI> It is no easy Thing to bring such to Conviction and Repentance and so to lay a good Foundation of Hope.</P>
<P>But then there are others who are or have been under powerful Awakenings and Convictions, the Word of God has been set home with Power on their Hearts; so that they are convinced that such Things as they hitherto rested in, are by no Means any good Foundation to rely on. Now if such as these come, after this, again to fix upon any other false and un∣safe Foundation of Hope; their Danger will be even greater than the others, nay inexpressible. This I take to be plainly taught in that of our Lord. Mat. 21. 31, 32. <HI>Jesus saith unto them that the Publicans and the Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you, for John came unto you in a Way of Righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the Publicans and the Harlots believed him,</HI> &amp;c. Their having had such Advanta∣ges, and too much trusted to them, made it the har∣der to unhinge them, and bring them to see that in∣deed they had no good Ground of Hope.</P>
<P>And having observed this I may proceed to con∣sider more particularly the Danger of having an ill∣grounded Hope, and the Danger of this may be considered as it respects this Life and that to come, although what may be said as to the first, terminates in the other World.</P>
<P N="1">1. I shall consider <HI>this Danger as to this Life, while we are Probationers for another.</HI> And under this Head I may say,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="29" REF="005029_0027_100E68C4EA89E098"/>1. <HI>If Persons come to have a fixed Hope of future Hap∣piness, and Salvation, upon an unsafe Foundation,</HI> (espe∣cially after great Advantages and Illuminations and after they have been brought off from some former false Grounds of Hope) <HI>there is very great Danger that they will never be undeceiv'd.</HI></P>
<P>It is no easy Matter, to bring, even those, that have lived all their Days in Sin, and have done no∣thing to secure the Favour of God through Jesus Christ, and so have no Grounds at all to hope for Happiness; to see the Evil of their Ways and the Danger they are in of perishing; especially, if to their own Corruptions there be added a bad Edu∣cation, and sinful Examples, and such as tempt Men, to neglect the Concerns of their Souls.</P>
<P>Men are apt to be fond of, and partial to their own Ways of thinking; and the Ways in which they have been brought up; hence we have that Direction, <HI>Train up a Child in the Way wherein be should go</HI>; and this Reason is given for it, because <HI>when he is old be will not depart from it.</HI> Prov. 22. 6. We see some Persons although they are favoured with all Gospel-Priviledges, and have much Pains taken with them, &amp; altho' they can't but know (if they would consider it) that they are in an unconverted Estate, and so have no good Foundation to hope for Happi∣ness; yet going on from Year to Year, in a tho'tless unconcerned Way, as if they were sure of Happi∣ness after Death.</P>
<P>It is hard to bring some such to a Sense of their Sinfulness and miserable Condition. But if they are brought to see something of their undone and lost Estate while in this Condition; to see their Sins and that if they continue as they are, they must pe∣rish: and after this, by any Means they come to rest upon some other false and unsafe Foundation of
<PB N="30" REF="005029_0028_100E68C7715666D0"/>
Hope; after they have been under powerful Con∣victions, and after they have taken some Pains to fix on a good Bottom; it will be more difficult to convince them of their Mistake and bring them to lay a good Foundation of Hope, than it was before. When Persons are come to fix their Thoughts after some Pains taken; they are usually very Tenacious of their own Thoughts; and if you tell them that after all that they have done, and that they hope they have experienc'd; they are yet without a good Hope, and will perish if they don't get a better; it will be no easy Matter to make them believe it altho' ever so true. And you may instead of doing them any good, get a Blot to yourself, as they that reprove a Scorner do.</P>
<P>And besides this (if they have been led into Mis∣takes by the Injudiciousness or Incorrectness of such Preachers as they have admired) this will be likely to confuse their Minds, they scarcely knowing what or who to believe; which will render it harder to undeceive them, and may have other very ill Con∣sequents with Respect to them.</P>
<P>Experience shows us how difficult it is, to bring Men off from any smaller Mistakes, when they are fixed in them; and considering the Subtilty of the great Enemy, and the Corruptions of our own Hearts, we may well suppose, it will be harder to persuade Men to think that all they have been doing is to no Pur∣pose, and that they must go back to the very Foun∣dation and do all anew. This is apt to shock them and make them start back: and it will be well if it don't make some desperately resolve to continue as they are, even at all Hazzards.</P>
<P>Now if we consider this, it will appear to be a Matter of great Importance to every Soul to build their Hope of Salvation, on a sure Foundation. And
<PB N="31" REF="005029_0029_100E68C8F2310B78"/>
if you find you have once been deceived and have had a false Hope, surely it highly concerns you now, to lay a good Foundation; and in order to this you must labour, use all proper Means and be much in Prayer. Let me just add here, we see hence how very careful Ministers ought to be, to direct and as∣sist People in Distress and under Convictions, to lay a good and sure Foundation of Hope, a Mistake in this may prove very prejudicial to Souls. But this must suffice for this Head.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>We should strive and pray that our Hope of Salvation may be on good Grounds; because if our Hopes are built on a false Foundation, we shall be in Dan∣ger of neglecting all Means and Endeavours to have a good Hope, and so shall be in Danger of perishing.</HI></P>
<P>There is Danger, not only, that such will go on deceiving and being deceived; but if so they will be likely wholly to neglect all those Things which are necessary in order to their having a good Hope and so to their Salvation. <HI>They that are whole, need not the Physician; but they that are sick.</HI> If Persons are come to this, that they are perswaded they are in Christ, that they are converted and born again; they will by no Means use those Means which they ought to use in order to obtain these Things.</P>
<P>Although we can merit nothing at the Hands of God, by the most diligent Use of Means; yet God has appointed Means to be used by us, in order to our having a good Foundation of Hope. <HI>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by tbe Word of God.</HI> Rom. 10.17. We must endeavour to <HI>work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</HI> if we would have <HI>God work in us to will, and do of his own good Pleasure.</HI> Phillip. 2. 12, 13. And surely if we flatter ourselves that the Work of God be already wrought in us, and we are in the Way to Happiness we shall be likely to neg∣lect
<PB N="32" REF="005029_0030_100E68CB8589C150"/>
these Means, we shall not read, hear, nor pray as if we thought ourselves without Hope. And if we indeed have no good Foundation of Hope; but are yet in our Sins, what infinite Danger shall we be in of being <HI>ashamed of our Hope</HI> and of eternal Mise∣ry. And this leads me to the second more general Head. Viz. To consider</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>The dreadful and amazing Condition of such as build their Hopes of Happiness on a false Founda∣tion, in the World to come.</HI></P>
<P>At Death, when the Soul shall depart into the World of Spirits then it shall at once be convinced of the Falsenefs of the Foundation of it's past Hopes. Then their <HI>Hope shall make them ashamed.</HI> When they find themselves disappointed of the Enjoyment of all they hoped for. The very Thought of this is, enough to fill us with Horror.</P>
<P>Such as only dream of Happinese hereafter, al∣though they have no Manner of Grounds to hope for it, and such as go on in a bold Desiance of the Wrath of God and eternal Misery; will find when they come to experience what it is to be damned, that it is so much more dreadful and amazing than their most enlarged Thoughts could reach; that even their Disappointment and Misery will be distressing and amazing.</P>
<P>But will not their Case be more miserable, their Dis∣appointment more intolerable, who have had many great Advantages, many Strivings of the Spirit, and who have been brought near to the Kingdom of Heaven; but after all have wilfully, carelesly and wickedly all along neglected to lay a good Foundation of Hope.</P>
<P>How amazing will it be to go to Hell full of the the Hopes of Heaven and Glory. Don't you think that the Disappointment <HI>Haman</HI> met with was very
<PB N="33" REF="005029_0031_100E68CE0CDD3A68"/>
dreadful, who when he was full of Hopes of being advanced to die highest Honour and Grandure; and of obtaining his full Desire on <HI>Mordecai, Esther</HI> 7, found himself at once accused, and condemned and dragged away to a miserable Death? But this was nothing at all to the surprizing and awful Disappoint∣ment, of such as shall have their <HI>Hopes make them a∣shamed</HI> at Death; What Tongue can tell, what Heart conceive! The Horror, Shame, and Anguish that will fill the Souls of such who shall find that they are for ever shut out of Heaven, and all Hopes of the least Happiness which they before hoped for, and instead of this they themselves sent down with Devils and damned Spirits into that Lake which burns with Fire and Brimstone for ever. Is it dis∣tressing to us to be disappointed when we are big with Hopes and Expectations that we are just ready to enjoy some earthly Good? how much more tormenting, to be disappointed and that for ever, of the expected Enjoyment of all possible Happiness, and to endure all possible Misery!</P>
<P>Now from all these Considerations laid together, it will appear to be of the greatest Concern to us, to endeavour and pray that we may have a well-groun∣ded Hope of Salvation. In these. Things I have en∣deavoured to excite you to seek a good Hope, from Fear of the ill Consequences of the contrary. It may be proper further to confirm the Doctrine, by addressing your Hope in some other Particulars, which will turn our Thoughts to much more pleasant Meditations. And here,</P>
<P>First, <HI>If you rightly endeavour and pay for a well-grounded Hope, and a comfortable Sense of it you will be likely to obtain it.</HI></P>
<P>These are not Things that cannot be obtained; many have and many (in this wonderful Day of
<PB N="34" REF="005029_0032_100E68D0923AAFE0"/>
Grace) do obtain them. And you have Reason to think you may also, if you seek them in a right Man∣ner. I can't but think that the Reason why so many have a false and ill-grounded Hope, is, in a great Measure, because they don't take due Care to have a better. And the Reason so many are without a comfortable Assurance that they have a well-groun∣ded Hope, who indeed have good Grounds of Hope, is very much, because they don't <HI>give all Diligence to make their Calling and Election sure.</HI> The Text inti∣mates that by proper Labour and Prayer we may ob∣tain such an Hope as we shall not be ashamed of: in this Way many have obtained it, and in this Way we are directed to seek it; And this should quicken us to die utmost Endeavours after such an Hope, and the Evidences of it: And you have as much Encouragement to hope for Success herein as others. But then if we would obtain this, we are not to think a few saint Wishes and heartless Pray∣ers are sufficient; it is a Matter of such Importance, as to be worth all possible Endeavours, our whole Hearts and Lives are to be chiefly taken up in it. But further to excite you to labour and pray for such a good Hope consider the Advantages of it in this World and the other. Three Advantages may be mentioned which relate to this Life and World. As</P>
<P N="1">1st <HI>A good Hope of future Happiness will serve greatly to support and comfort us under all the Afflictions we meet with in life.</HI></P>
<P>We are here in a World of Sorrows and Troubles, and greatly need something to support and bear us up under them. Now if we have a good and well-grounded Hope that we are in Christ, and so that we Have the Love and Favour of God, and his Blessing
<PB N="35" REF="005029_0033_100E68D3187EB4C8"/>
and are in the Way to eternal life; this will be our greatest Comfort and Support.</P>
<P>When such as are favoured with this Hope are under very heavy outward Afflictions, grievous and repeated Bereavements, or other Distress; to consi∣der that this, yea all Things are order'd out to us by our heavenly Father, our Covenant-God, to consider his Covenant-Faithfulness, his infinite Perfections, and his gracious Promises that <HI>all Things shall work together for our Good,</HI> and that <HI>these light Afflictions which are but for a Moment, shall work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory</HI>; and also <HI>that Tribulation worketh Patience, and Patience Experience, and Experience</HI> such an <HI>Hope as shall not make us asha∣med.</HI> What greater and stronger Consolation can we have under our outward Afflictions? Nay fur∣ther, such as have comfortable Evidences of this Hope, sometimes have the sweet Incomes of the Holy Spirit, delightful Communion with God, and the most the sensible and reviving Manifestations of the Love and Favour of God to their Souls, while under outward Afflictions. These Comforts are not al∣ways alike in those that have a good Hope: But they that have not a good Hope of Salvation have no Grounds to expect them, any of them at all.</P>
<P>I would further observe that this Hope will help to support us under spiritual Trials and Distresses, which even such may be in; this will greatly stren∣gthen the Believer against the fierce Temptations and Assaults of the evil one, hence we are advised to <HI>put on the Hope of Salvation for an Helmet,</HI> 1 Thess. 5. 8.</P>
<P>This will support us under a Sense of our remain∣ing Corruptions and Imperfections; when we are asleep this will keep our Hearts awake, and if, ur Beloved withdraw; it will awake us up to seek after him, till we find him.—<HI>Cant.</HI> 5. beginning.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="005029_0034_100E68D5AA794A80"/>They that have a real sure Ground of Hope; will not in their Times of the greatest Darkness and De∣sertions utterly lose it, for any long Time; although <HI>in a little Wrath, God may hide his Face for a Moment! yet with everlasting Kindness will be return, and have Mercy on them.</HI> Their <HI>Hope</HI> will be <HI>as an Anchor to the Soul,</HI> keeping it from sinking when Waves and Billows pass over it.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>When we have good Evidences that our Hope is well-grounded, this gives us very great Joy, Peace and Comfort in this World.</HI></P>
<P>If our Hopes of Salvation be built upon a sure and safe Foundation, it never will make us ashamed; al∣though we may not have such clear and comforting Evidences of it. And I have no Doubt but some have really a good Hope of Salvation and yet are under Doubts as to the Foundation of their Hopes, and although sometimes their Evidences of their good Estate are clear and bright, yet at other Times they may be more clouded, and less sensible.</P>
<P>Now as the least good Grounds to hope that we have an Interest in Christ, and so are in the Way to obtain Salvation will give us Joy and Comfort, so in Proportion, to the Degrees of Evidence of this, will our Pleasure and Joy be. And when the Beliaver upon a due and proper Examination of himself, finds the Evidences that his Hope of Happiness, is well-grounded, very bright and clear, and when the Spi∣rit of God witnesses with his Spirit that he is a Child of God; this will put greater Joy and Gladness into their Hearts, than the Increase of all outward good Things: Nay, it will give them <HI>Joy unspeaka∣ble and full of Glory.</HI> And if such Comfort and Joy be worth seeking, we should labour for such a Foun∣dation of Hope from whence it proceeds,</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="005029_0035_100E68D730FEF418"/>Thirdly, <HI>This good Hope will best support us, under the Apprehensions, Views and Approaches of Death.</HI></P>
<P>Death will certainly, and may very suddenly, seize upon every one of us: and it is worth while to spend our whole lives in Endeavours, if thereby we may have a comfortable safe and happy Death; and Happiness after it. And we never can have a com∣fortable safe and happy Death, without a well-grounded Hope of Happiness after it. I am sensi∣ble, Sinners may <HI>have no Bands in their Death:</HI> al∣though they have no Hope of Salvation; yet they may be stupid and senseless of their Danger: And so go out of the World without Fear. But how far is this from being an happy and safe Death! We can't die a safe and happy Death unless after Death we shall be happy; and this can't be unless the Foundation of it, be laid in this Life. And if our Salvation be secured, whether we have a clear View of it just before Death or no, yet we shall be happy. Sometimes Believers may have great Doubts and fiery Assaults of Satan a little before Death; I think it is not impossible but some may go doubt∣ing out of this World, to <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bosom; nor is it at all improbable.</P>
<P>But with what Calmness and Serenity of Soul may they, that, not only have a good and well-grounded Hope of Glory, but a lively Sense also that their <HI>Hope will not make them ashamed,</HI> look Death in the Face! He that is the King of Terrors to Sinners, is but a welcome Messenger to them, to carry them to the Enjoyment of those glorions Things they hope for.</P>
<P>Some, when God has, in the Hour of Death, lifted up the Light of his Countenance upon them, have had such Visions and Foretastes of Glory, such bright and clear Discoveries of the Love of God
<PB N="38" REF="005029_0036_100E68D9B6928520"/>
to their Souls; and of their Interest in Christ; and Christ has appeared so lovely and glorious to them, that they have as it were, forgot the dark Entry they were to pass thro' to go to Christ, their Souls seem impatiently (almost) to wait for his coming: and when the Moment comes, they as 'twere leap forth with unutterable Joy into his Arms.</P>
<P>Thus have I seen (to the Glory of free &amp; rich Grace be it spoken) some few both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> meet the King of Terrors, without Fear and with great Joy. And who at such a joyful Sight would not cry out, <HI>Let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my last End be like his?</HI> And who would not with all possible Diligence and Ardency of Soul labour and pray for such an Hope, as will make their Death thus delightful. But it is Time, as this leads me, having thus considered some, (and but some) of the many Advantages of a good Hope in this Life, be∣fore and at Death; that I in a few Words,</P>
<P>2dly, Consider, <HI>That this well-grounded Hope shall be swallowed up, in the full and perfect and everlasting Enjoyment of all that we now hope for, yea and much more, after Death.</HI></P>
<P>Altho there is not an End of Man at Death, but Eternity follows, yet all our present Hopes end with the Death of the Body. The Hope of the Hypocrite and Sinner then ends, and is turned into endless Despair, Horror and Misery. And the Hope of the true Believer then ends, because it is swal∣lowed up in the Enjoyment of all that he desired, expected and hoped for! Rom. 8. 24. <HI>That which is seen why doth a Man yet hope for</HI>? Whatsoever the enlighten'd and sanctified Soul wishes for or desires, he shall fully and compleatly possess and enjoy after Death. They that have this good Hope, shall come <HI>to see as they are seen, to know</HI> (in their Measure) <HI>as
<PB N="39" REF="005029_0037_100E68DB6F364208"/>
they are known,</HI> they shall awake in the divine Like∣ness, they shall be perfectly freed from all Sin, and Temptation to it, from Sorrow and Misery and Fears thereof: and their enlarged Souls, with all their Faculties, shall be perfectly satisfied: They shall fully and without Interruption enjoy God the Fa∣ther, and the Son their dear and precious Redeemer, and the Spirit of all Grace and Comfort. God will be the satisfying Portion of their Souls forever.</P>
<P>Let me just say here, the Souls of such as have this Hope, shall be happy and blessed, while in their State of Separation from the Body; 'till the Resur∣rection of die Body. But as the enlarged Hopes of such extend to the Resurrection and beyond it, so their Bodies also shall arise <HI>glorious Bodies</HI> form'd and <HI>fashion'd like to Christ's,</HI> Philip. 3.21. Their blessed Souls and Bodies being united, shall give up the Ac∣count to God in the Judgment with exceeding great Joy. And after this they shall go away into ever∣lasting Life.</P>
<P>But why should I further attempt, to describe to you the Joy, Happiness and Blessedness of such, since <HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entered into the Heart of Man,</HI> how exceeding great and glorious their Joy and Blessedness shall be, and this shall continue to all Eternity. Thus their <HI>Hope shall not make them ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, brethren, I have given some Reasons why we should labour and strive with all our Powers, and pray with Ardency of Soul, that we may have a well-grounded Hope of Salvation, that will not make us ashamed. And what can be offer'd, that will influence us Hereto, if these Things will not? And thus have I finished what I proposed for the Proof and Illus∣tration of the Doctrine. I proceed now to make
<PB N="40" REF="005029_0038_100E68DDF3282D18"/>
some IMPROVEMENT of what has been said. And here</P>
<P>First, We infer <HI>the amazing Folly of such as are either without any Hope of Salvation, or have a false Hope.</HI></P>
<P>I can't but fear there are too many such; and what a dreadful Condition are they in? Consider, that you are here but for a very little Time; you, are hastening to an endless Eternity either of Hap∣piness or Misery; and as your Hope is here, whe∣ther well or ill grounded, so it will be with you for∣ever. And Oh consider what infinite Happiness you shall enjoy hereafter, if you now indeed see that your Hope be on a good Foundation: And on the other hand consider how unspeakably amazing it will be to find yourselves ashamed of your Hopes at last. Consider what has been said of these Things, and say, is it not the greatest Folly and Stupidity, to rest and be easy without a good and sure Hope of eternal Hap∣piness and Salvation. They who have no Hope, and they who have no better than no Hope, and even those who flatter themselves they have a good Hope, although without any just Grounds, will be ashamed of their Hopes at last. And Oh that it were possible to awaken your Consciences now, so that you might see your Stupidity and Folly! Will you, can you calmly and deliberately go on in this Way which you know will end in eternal Torment! And dare any run the amazing Hazard of losing their Souls, for Want of a due Care to lay a good Founda∣tion of Hope!</P>
<P>Secondly, Hence infer <HI>their Wisdom and Happiness who have</HI> (by the Grace of God) <HI>laid a good and sure Foundation of Hope of eternal Salvation.</HI> Thrice hap∣py are they; <HI>all Things are theirs.</HI> They are truly happy here amidst all their outward Afflictions, &amp; Sorrows,
<PB N="41" REF="005029_0039_100E68E080A96B18"/>
yea nevertheless happy for them. Whether they have a certain and comfortable Assurance that their Hope is thus well-grounded or no, yet if it be they are happy, yea, their own Hearts can't conceive the Glory they are to possess hereafter.</P>
<P>Now whatever it has cost such, how much Labour and Difficulties soever they have undergone, yet they have shown the greatest Wisdom, in that they have sought till they have obtained such an Hope.</P>
<P>But I shall not enlarge here, but proceed to say,</P>
<P>Thirdly, Hence, <HI>Let us all examine ourselves, to see what Foundation we have, for our Hopes of eternal Hap∣piness and Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>You see something of the Danger of a false Hope, and the glorious Advantages of a true one. And let these Considerations quicken every Soul of us to ex∣amine ourselves, without Delay and before it be too late, what Foundation of Hope we have.</P>
<P>It is nothing less than Heaven and Glory, than the eternal Happiness and Salvation of our never-dying Souls, that we hope for. And O search and try till you do really find what Foundation you have to hope for these glorious Things upon, search deep, look to the very Bottom, see if the Foundation be laid se∣cure and safe. A trifling Examination and search, will signify very little. We should be the more care∣ful in this Search and Examination because there are so many false Foundations of Hope, and so much Danger of our being deceiv'd.</P>
<P>Give me leave to ask you Brethren, and Oh! let your Hearts go with me, and ask your own Souls, such Questions as these, Viz.</P>
<P>Do you hope for Happiness and Salvation, meer∣ly because God is merciful and gracious, although your Consciences tell you, you never comply'd with
<PB N="42" REF="005029_0040_100E68E307EDE070"/>
those Things nor come into that Method, upon, and in which alone, you may expect his Mercy?</P>
<P>Although a good Hope originates in the Mercy of God, (as I have shewn) yet to build our Hopes of Happiness upon this, separated from the Merits of Christ, and the Covenant of Grace; and when we can't but know, we never have done any Thing in order to obtain the Favour of God through Christ; is to build our Hopes on a wrong Foundation. God will not glorify his Grace and Mercy, to the Dis∣honour of any other of his divine Attributes.</P>
<P>Again, do you hope for Salvation, because you enjoy the Means of Grace, have heard the best of Preaching; are born of truly religious Parents; have done some Duties; yea even come to the spe∣cial Ordinances? All these Things are very great Priviledges, or Duties, and by no Means to be lightly thought or spoken of; but all these alone, unless you are brought to believe in Christ, repent of your Sins, and unless a real Change be wrought in your Hearts, will not give sufficient Ground to hope for Salvation, as I might easily shew had I Time. Do you hope for Happiness, because others think and speak well of you: Consider so they may of the greatest Hypocrites: <HI>For we cannot judge the Hearts of Men.</HI></P>
<P>Again, do you hope for Salvation, because you have been greatly awakened, enlightened and con∣victed? Consider, Illumination and Convictions, although necessary to Conversion, may be where Conversion is not, there is a legal Sorrow for Sin as well as evangelical, which implies Conviction. Have not your Convictions arisen only from a Sense of Mi∣sery! Let me seriously ask you, have you ever been convinced of the Evil &amp; accursed Nature of Sin? has Sin ever appeared to you exceeding sinful? Have you e∣ver
<PB N="43" REF="005029_0041_100E68E58D6F9728"/>
seen Sin as it is contrary to the Nature, Attributes; Perfections and Law of God? All Repentance and so all Convictions have Respect to God, against whom all Sin is committed. And it is very plain that the brighter Discoveries God makes of himself to any the more they will see of the evil Nature of Sin, and of their own Sinfulness, Vileness and Mi∣sery. See Job 42. 5, 6. <HI>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear: but now mine Eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI> Read to the same Purpose, Isai. 6. from the 1st to the End of the 5th Verse; if you have never seen any Thing of the Evil of Sin as it is against God, you have Reason to fear, you never were rightly convinced of the evil Nature of Sin. And as the Law of God is agreeable to his Nature holy, just and good, so if we see Sin as it is against God, we shall all see it in a good Measure as it is against the Law.</P>
<P>I must add (for I esteem it a Thing of great Im∣portance) have you ever seen what a dreadful A∣buse Sin is of the Mercy of God? And particu∣larly, as that is discovered, in giving us a glorious Saviour, and so as our Sins pierce our Saviour.</P>
<P>When we consider this and other Discoveries of the Mercy of God, doth this melt us down into a true and genuine Contrition for our Sins, and disco∣ver to us more of its vile Nature. <HI>The Goodness of God leads to Repentance.</HI> Rom. 2. 4.</P>
<P>But to add no more here, no Conviction may be rely'd upon as a good Ground of Hope, unless it be followed by a real Conversion and turning from Sin to God.</P>
<P>Again, do you hope for Happiness, because after you have been convicted of Sin, you have suddenly, or by flower Degrees, had great Light, Joy and Com∣fort;
<PB N="44" REF="005029_0042_100E68E813F05AD8"/>
and seemed to have clear Sights, or Visions of Christ and Heaven! I beseech you suffer me in Love and Faithfulness to your Souls, to tell you: These Things alone are not to be rested in as a sure Foundation of Hope of Salvation. <HI>There is the Joy of the Hypocrite as well as of the true Believer,</HI> Job 20. 5. We read, <HI>that the triumphing of the Wicked is short, and the Joy of the Hypocrite but for a Moment,</HI> And the Apostle tells us, 2 Cor. 11. 14. That <HI>Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of Light.</HI> It is to be feared some may be deceived with false and ill-grounded Joys. Such sensible Enjoyments and Manifestations are exceeding sweet and refreshing, when after some Clouds, the Soul of the Believer, has been seeking hard after God; and when these Things are accompany'd with other good and clear Evidences of a good Hope. What I caution you against is placing too much in such sensible Enjoy∣ments; and taking them for Evidences of Conver∣sion, when indeed they are not in themselves, to be rested in as such. Let me just add, do you hope for Salvation because you have partly forsaken your former Sins and partly comply'd with your former neglected Duties? we are glad of any Reformation, in any Thing, and how much more glad should we be to see a thorough universal Reformation of your Lives, proceeding from a real Change wrought in your Hearts! But I must tell you that there may be a partial Reformation where there is not a thorough Reformation, and there may be a considerable out∣ward Change and Reformation for a Time, and yet not any real Change wrought in the Heart, without which you are not converted in a Gospel-Sense: every Change is not Conversion; your different Way of Living, different Company and the differ∣ent Manner of Conversation: the Examples of o∣thers,
<PB N="45" REF="005029_0043_100E68EA9F51E608"/>
whom you esteem, or your going from one Stage of Life to another; may give you a different Turn of Thought and be the Means of your disre∣lishing some evil Things you before took Plea∣sure in, and so cause a Change in you: But in this Case you ought carefully to consider whether you have turned from Sin to God, agreeable to that Jer. 4. 1. <HI>If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto me,</HI> Joel 2. 12. There may be a turning from one Sin to another, only an Exchange of Lusts and Sins; but this is of no Manner of Advantage. Conversion implies a turning from all and every in∣dividual Sin, and also a turning unto God. Into his Service, and an holy Obedience to him, and in to all his Ways.</P>
<P>But not to be further tedious here, consider and closely examine whether you have laid the Foun∣dation of your Hope deep and sure, have you ever been convinced of Sin as it is against God, and of your own personal Guilt, that you are the Man? Have you had a real Change wrought in you, are the Hearts of Stone taken out of you, and Hearts of Flesh given to you? And have you truly em∣braced Christ as your only and all-sufficient Saviour, your Prophet, Priest and King? And doth your Hope purify your Hearts? By these and such o∣ther Marks, which have been more largely consi∣dered before; you may in some Measure come to know whether you have a good Hope of Salvation or not.</P>
<P>But you need the Assistance of the Holy Spirit, in your Self-Examination, the Spirit not only works in Believers Souls those Things which are the Foundation of Hope; but when they, as in the Presence and Fear of God and humbly seeking the Help of the Spirit, set themselves to a close and
<PB N="46" REF="005029_0044_100E68EC21FEB2A0"/>
serious Examination of themselves as to their spiri∣tual Estate, he graciously assists them, brings Things to their Minds, and gives them to see that they have such Things in them as are the Evidences of a good Hope, and so enables them to draw a sure Conclusion that they are in the Way to Glory. And when the Spirit gives these Evidences in their full Strength and Brightness and so as to remove Doubts from them, this is a full Assurance of Hope: And now the Spirit may be said to witness with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</P>
<P>But it is high Time I should proceed in the fourth Place to a Use of Exhortation, with which I shall conclude all.</P>
<P>And the Exhortation may be address'd to the following Sorts of Persons.</P>
<P>First, I would speak to such as are <HI>thoughtless and unconcerned although they have no Manner of Foun∣dation to hope for Salvation upon.</HI></P>
<P>And are there not some such, who now hear me, even in such a Day of the wonderful Striving of the Spirit as this is! And after all that God has done for them? I am afraid there are some who if they were asked what Ground they have to hope for Salvation hereafter; could only tell you, that God is merciful, and they are his Creatures. And so they hope for Mercy, although they in a most horrid and shameful Manner abuse the Mercy of God e∣very Day, although they live in all Manner of Sin and Wickedness, serving the Devil and gratifying their own Heart's Lusts. Surely as to such I may say you are without Hope, you are treasuring up to yourselves Wrath against the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God. But are there not others who although they don't live the most vicious Lives; yet have no Reason to
<PB N="47" REF="005029_0045_100E68EDA2FCF860"/>
believe they have ever repented of Sin, or received a Saviour, that ever they have been converted, and that do indulge some Sins; And yet are perfectly senseless of any Danger, go on in a Series of Thoughtlessness, and a perfect Neglect of the Sal∣vation of their precious and immortal Souls. And Oh what a dreadful Condition are all such in!</P>
<P>With what Words shall I speak unto you, to per∣swade you to a proper Concern for yourselves? You, it is like have no Sense of your Danger, and have no Concern for yourselves, don't pity your∣selves; but your faithful Ministers are concerned for you, and even <HI>travail in Birth for you.</HI></P>
<P>Be exhorted, poor miserable Souls, at least to sit down and consider, what a Case you are indeed in. You can be but little longer in this World, and what will become of you when God shall require your Souls and you shall go over into an immense and endless Eternity; Christ is the only Saviour and him you despise and slight, you will not receive him nor have him to rule over you, and how can you be happy! Nay look into your Hearts and en∣deavour to see something what you are: look up∣wards, and consider the Being Perfections and At∣tributes of God: And see how unlike him you are, and how impossible it is you should be happy in the Enjoyment of God. Consider the Inhabitants, the Enjoyments and Employments of Heaven: and think whether you are a Companion fit for such Beings, and a Person qualified for such Work and Enjoyments? And then O turn your Eyes down to Hell, and consider how much you are like the Devils in your Tempers and Dispositions, and how much fit∣ter you are for the cursed Employments of Hell, and the Miseries thereof, than for Heaven. See (and O that you could see) the Wrath of God
<PB N="48" REF="005029_0046_100E68F06711F400"/>
that hangs over you, and the Gulf of Fire and Brimstone that gapes for you beneath.—Strive as you value your Souls to see your undone and miserable Estate; and work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling: Give yourselves no Rest, and delay not one Moment, until you have laid a sure Foundation of Hope of Salvation. Consider there is a Saviour offered and Salvation is offered to you as well as others. And why will you not accept the Offer? The Spirit of God is striving in a wonderful Manner with People, here and elsewhere, many are now taken, and why will you be lest; shall your Parents, shall your Brethren and Sisters; shall your Neigh∣bours, yea shall your Children or even your Ser∣vants, be taken by the Grace of God and be e∣ternally happy? And will you be the only Per∣sons that will stand out against the Calls of God and the Strivings of the Spirit? Are you resol∣ved to go on in your carnal Security, without any Foundation of Hope of Happiness, till you drop into everlasting Misery! Oh that it were possi∣ble (while it is an accepted Time and Day of Salvation) to awaken you to a Sense of your Sin and Misery.</P>
<P>But I turn myself secondly, <HI>to awakened and con∣vinced Sinners, who are now sensible, that your former Hopes were vain, and so are desirous without Delay, to lay a good Foundation of Hope</HI></P>
<P>There is more Hope of you now than ever before, that you may be plucked as Brands out of the Burning: Bless God therefore that you are awakened and convinced; And by all Means cherish your Convictions; And see that they don't wear off, until you are converted. And let me tell you there is Danger that you will now
<PB N="49" REF="005029_0047_100E68F4140A8610"/>
build your Hopes upon a false Foundation. The Devil is alarmed at your Awakening and Convic∣tions; and if it be possible he will either quench your Convictions and cause them to wear off; so that you may have some seeming Red and Ease; or he will bring you to rest upon some new and false Foundation of Hope and so deceive you at last: Therefore, dear Friends and Brethren, con∣sider well what you do, and be advised and di∣rected,</P>
<P>First, <HI>Not to be too hasly and sudden, in think∣ing you are converted and in taking Comfort.</HI></P>
<P>I am afraid many deceive themselves by this. When they are under powerful Convictions and as it were sinking down into deep Waters; they are ready; (like a drowning Man) to catch hold of any Thing they can; to lay hold of any thing that looks like Conversion; and so, through the Deceitfulness, of Satan, their own Hearts of Sin, (and 'twere well if not through the <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Rashness</HI> of some that pretend to be <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Exhorters</HI>) are in great Danger of thinking them∣selves in a good Estate when they are not. Oh beware of this! You see you have hitherto been deceived; see to it that you don't now rest up∣on another equally false Foundation of Hope; this may be infinitely dangerous to you, as you have heard. Let me advise you therefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>To study carefully what a good and sure Foundation of Hope is on which you may safely rest.</HI></P>
<P>A Mistake in this may be fatal, therefore be ex∣ceeding careful about it; and before you cry Peace to your Souls; see that you have a full and clear Understanding what it is you may safely
<PB N="50" REF="005029_0048_100E68F596B69B10"/>
rest upon; and here I beseech you make the <HI>precious Bible</HI> your Rule. Study that, and such good Books as are agreeable to it. Don't regard so much what others tell you of their Experien∣ces; And what you must find and feel in your selves, as what the Word of God tells you, you must find and experience, Call no Man Lord or Master here, and let nothing satisfy your Souls till you come to be well assured that you have indeed those Marks and Evidences that you are real Chri∣stians, which are recorded in the holy Word of God. In a Word, rest not till your Hopes are built upon the Foundations before mentioned.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Be prevailed on duely to attend on the publick Worship and other Means of Grace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</HI> Rom. 10. 17. If you love your Souls let no Temptation be able to hinder you from this; and attend with proper Care, Diligence, and Constancy: And by no Means needlesly and often, (as with <HI>itching Ears</HI>) wander from the Place of your stated Worship.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Be much in Self-Examination.</HI></P>
<P>When you are satisfied what is a good Foun∣dation of Hope, see whether you have built your Hopes upon it, this you must come to a Know∣ledge of, by examining your selves, be much, be often, therefore in this and see that your Exami∣nation be thorough and impartial. Set yourselves as in the Presence of an holy, an heart-searching God, and imploring his Assistance, search your∣selves and the Foundation of your Hope to the very Bottom.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Be careful least you be tossed about wth e∣very Wind of Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="005029_0049_100E68F9C7AE2020"/>Beware left by hearing many different Preachers (who if they think alike, yet may express them∣selves very differently) you get lost and confused in your Thoughts, and so become uncapable of determining any Thing about yourselves and your spiritual Estate. I will only add,</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> Be much in Prayer to God.</P>
<P>Plead with him to lead you into a plain Path; cry mightily to God that he will save you from resting upon any false Foundations. That he will work in you a true Repentance of and Conversion from Sin and an unseigned Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, that he will accept you in the Covenant of Grace, and entitle you to all his gracious Promi∣ses, that so your Hope of Happiness may be sure and well-grounded; instead of consulting those who know but very little, either <HI>doctrinally</HI> or <HI>ex∣perimentally</HI> of these Things; go to those, whom Christ having <HI>accounted faithful hath set over you in the Ministry</HI>: Enquire of them what you shall do to be saved in a meek and humble Manner. If you in these and such like Ways cherish your Convictions and endeavour to lay a good Foun∣dation of Hope, you will be in a Way of obtain∣ing such an Hope as will never make you ashamed.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I am to speak a few Words to <HI>such as hope you are in the Way to Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>You have heard, from the Word of God, that there is Danger that you may be ashamed of your Hope. Let all such therefore be exhorted to see to it that the Foundation of your Hope be good. A bear Possibility of your being deceived, should quicken you to the greatest Care in examining the Foundation you build upon. Could I certainly tell you that there is one, in this great Assembly that although he is full of the Hopes of Heaven yet
<PB N="52" REF="005029_0050_100E68FD55CB29A0"/>
has no Foundation therefor, and so will be asha∣med of his Hopes; would you not all be ready with the Disciples to say, <HI>Lord is it I, Lord is it I</HI>? It is our Duty to be often looking over the Evi∣dences of our good Estate, &amp; let us be persuaded to do it. Let us go back to the very beginning and see what it is that we laid as the Foundation of our Hope; see whether that be good. And if any Soul of us who are Professors, and have a Hope of Salvation find that our Hope is built on the Sand, Oh! let us bewail it before God and im∣mediately be up and doing, and endeavouring to lay a better Foundation of Hope. Blessed be God it may not be too late; there may yet be Hope for such, if they will without Delay strive and endeavour to rectify this dangerous Mistake, and as your Hearts have hitherto deceived you, be very jealous over them. Be careful, above all Things, that you be no more deceived in a Matter of such infinite Im∣portance: But see that you now lay a good Foun∣dation of Hope.</P>
<P>To conclude, if after the best Examination you find; (as I hope many of you will) that your Hopes of Salvation are well-grounded, <HI>give all the Glory to God,</HI> whose Work it is: beware of do∣ing any Thing to darken your Evidences to cause the Comforter that now relieves your Souls, to go far from you, endeavour every Way to perswade, assist and allure others to come into the same happy Condition with yourselves.</P>
<P>Happy, Brethren, are you here, happy shall you be at Death, happy shall you be to all Eter∣nity; Through Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and Spirit, be Praises everlasting. AMEN.</P>
