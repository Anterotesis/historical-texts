<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PEACE is so lovely in itself, and is so essential to happiness, that all would be accounted friends there∣to. The direction from above is, <HI>seek peace and pursue it:</HI> and the cry from below is <HI>peace, peace!</HI> Yet there is a great and important difference be∣tween the two languages; for the divine voice is, <HI>love the TRUTH and peace;</HI> and the way prescribed to promote <HI>union</HI> is, <HI>speaking the TRUTH in love. Zech. 8.19. Eph. 4.15.</HI> But the two grand engines to support the contrary cause are <HI>deceit</HI> and <HI>violence.</HI> Which cause the Prince of <HI>peace</HI> came into the world on purpose to destroy; and wherever his <HI>truth</HI> prevails, it breaks up that sort of <HI>peace.</HI> Hence the charge exhibited against one of his greatest ministers, by men of principal note in the world for religion and order, was, <HI>We have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition throughout the world. Acts 24.5.</HI> And it was not only so among the <HI>Jews,</HI> but also in the capital of a <HI>Ro∣man colony;</HI> when the power of truth had cut off the hope of an unlawful scheme of <HI>gain,</HI> the <HI>magistrates</HI> soon had a complaint laid before them, that, <HI>these men do exceedingly trouble our city. Acts 16.20.</HI></P>
<P>However, this conduct both in <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> is so plainly exposed in the bible, that the whole <HI>christian world</HI> will condemn it; and who will dare to appear now to plead for a <HI>peace</HI> contrary to <HI>truth?</HI> Instead of that, <HI>truth</HI> is set upon as high a pole among <HI>protestants,</HI> as the <HI>cross</HI> is among the <HI>papists</HI>: and every author that writes, has got the im∣portant <HI>word</HI> wrote in some place, where the reader may not fail to see it. Yet the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has been such <HI>galling of one ano∣ther</HI> in <HI>perverse disputed</HI> and <HI>striving</HI> about this and other <HI>words</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 6.4, 5.</NOTE> in our day, that some serious people are ready to condemn all <HI>disputing,</HI> at being a principal cause of all the confusions that appear in our nation and land. Tho' if after the confused noise, and garments rolled in blood, with the great perplexities which were produced by many <HI>defeats</HI> that we met with in the beginning of the late war, any had said,
<PB N="iv" REF="010823_0003_0F81D4693207F3F0"/>
we had better be <HI>easy</HI> as long as we can, than to oppose the enemy any more; such advice would hardly have passed for good policy, or for a token of true regard to our peace and welfare.</P>
<P>All rational attempts to remove calamities, are levelled against the causes of them; and as deceit and violence have been the causes of all our woes from the beginning, so a great part of the work of God's servants in all ages has been to point out and expose the deceits of false men; which has often pro∣duced what the prophet speaks of, viz. <HI>A voice of the how∣ling of the shepherds;</HI> and says he, <HI>my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me. Zech. 11.3, 8.</HI> And things of like nature have appeared in our times, but none are willing to be accounted the <HI>idol shepherds</HI>; each one would turn it off to others; and many ministers in our land have been labouring these <HI>20</HI> years to fix the odious character upon a number of people who have withdrawn from their societies. Among whom Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> has lately distinguished himself, by at∣tempting to open the
<Q><HI>rise, cause and tendency</HI> of these separations and the errors of the anabaptists,</Q>
in a volume of about <HI>200</HI> pages. This I have been requested by christian friends to write some reply to; but as I have several times, exposed some of my thoughts on these subjects, to the world. I repeatedly told my friends that I thought I had done my part in that way. At length it was urged that many of the first leaders in separation were gone off the stage, and scarce any left that are so fully acquainted with the circumstances and manner of the first separations, as I have been. This argument prevailed so far, that I agreed to take and read the book and act as light might appear. And when I came to read it, no doubt remained whether it ought to be answer∣ed or not, tho' the doing of it was far from appearing a pleasing lot to nature. For whatever pleasure it may yield, to appear to the public in matters that are pleasing, or for a∣musement; yet in <HI>war,</HI> to be distinguished as a mark for every one to shoot at, <HI>that</HI> nature dreads. My unequalness to the task was still a greater difficulty; for tho' it was an easy matter to point out many of Mr. <HI>Fish</HI>'s mistakes and in∣consistences, so as to render his performance contemptible; to do the subject justice, would be nothing less than to lay open the religious <HI>constitutions</HI> of the whole country, and many <HI>transactions</HI> which deeply affect the characters of many noted men.</P>
<P>Yet to omit it now, could not be done with a clear con∣science; for Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says,
<Q>If I have in any instance, mis∣taken
<PB N="v" REF="010823_0003_0F81D4693207F3F0"/>
<HI>facts,</HI> or misrepresented <HI>persons</HI> or <HI>things,</HI> I desire it may be corrected.</Q>
Preface p. <HI>4.</HI> And after a long discourse on those things, he says,
<Q>The foregoing <HI>errors, principles,</HI> and groundless <HI>offences</HI> which they took, the charge of all which must lie upon them until they purge themselves.</Q>
p. <HI>164.</HI> Therefore to be silent now, would be a letting many things pass for truth, which I knew were not so, tho' many others did not know it. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> tells us he hopes, if there are any <HI>mistakes,</HI>
<Q>it will be looked upon as simple and unde∣signed.</Q>
To which I would say, I desire always to avoid the evil of judging the <HI>counsels</HI> of others <HI>hearts,</HI> and to judge righteously according to what is made manifest. But as he has manifested that he has <HI>mistook</HI> the <HI>rule itself,</HI> throughout his book, I leave him and others to consider how <HI>simple</HI> or <HI>un∣designed</HI> such a <HI>mistake</HI> can be; or what less can be expected than false actings upon a false rule. Three witnesses are allowed to prove any point, both by divine and human law: and that number shall suffice for the present to prove that he has mistook, and acted contrary to the <HI>golden rule</HI> in the af∣fair before us.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> No man, or community can think it reasonable to have their character drawn only by their <HI>imperfections</HI> with∣out any of their <HI>vertues:</HI> yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> after a long attempt to draw the separates "picture to the life," says,
<Q>Whatever <HI>good things</HI> they have among them, they have them not <HI>as separates,</HI> but in <HI>common</HI> with other christians. The things that I have told you of above, are their <HI>characteris∣ticks.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>160.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> None can be willing to have the character of their whole denomination taken from evil persons and things which may be pickt out among them: yet in the midst of this labour to draw our picture, he says,
<Q>I would not here be under∣stood to represent them <HI>all</HI> to a man, as advancing and <HI>uniting</HI> in every <HI>one</HI> of the particulars above-mentioned; but <HI>some</HI> of them held <HI>one,</HI> some <HI>another.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>142.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> No man can rationally be willing to be deprived of the liberty of hearing and judging for himself in important matters; nor to be condemned by others without a fair hear∣ing; yet this is the very labour of Mr. <HI>Fish</HI>'s whole book; for a principal reason given for his writing it, in the first page of his preface is, that
<Q>a considerable number, if not the greater part of his few remaining people, inadvertently fa∣voured the separate teachers, <HI>so far</HI> as to frequent their meetings.</Q>
And a special article of advice, in the <HI>con∣clusion</HI> is
<Q><HI>Go not after them nor follow them.</HI>—How
<PB N="vi" REF="010823_0004_0F81D469F485F7F8"/>
can you, with any good conscience, after I have shewn you from <HI>whence</HI> they arose, their <HI>principle, spirit</HI> and <HI>ten∣dency.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>191.</HI> Thus his whole drift appears to be to keep his people from hearing and judging for themselves. And he has condemned us without a fair hearing: for ac∣counts of our principles and practices have been published by various hands, and at different times for these <HI>18</HI> years; yet it does not appear thro' his whole book, that he has paid any regard to them, even so much as to point out our mistakes or inconsistencies, (as doubtless he might have found some such;) but the chief of what he has held forth to the world against us, is upon his own bare word.</P>
<P>I suppose the chief thing which blinded him in these affairs, was a conceit of his <HI>good design</HI> therein; for speaking of "the grievous things" which he has written both against se∣parates and baptists, he says,
<Q>Neither of which should I have meddled with, could I at this day, have seen how to plead the cause of the <HI>churches</HI> (that our brethren have separa∣ted from) which I believe to be the cause of God, with∣out shewing the <HI>younger</HI> and reminding the <HI>elder</HI> among my people, how and wherein <HI>this sacred cause</HI> has been injured.</Q>
Pref. p. <HI>4.</HI> Now 'tis no new thing for men under a strong conceit that they are engaged in a <HI>good cause</HI> to put <HI>good</HI> meanings to <HI>bad</HI> actions of their own, and <HI>bad</HI> meanings to <HI>good</HI> actions of others; yea and to esteem men's <HI>works</HI> for the <HI>persons</HI> sake, instead of esteeming the <HI>person</HI> highly for his <HI>work's</HI> sake. And this temper will prompt men to think that <HI>evil</HI> don't belong to the <HI>sacred cause</HI> that they are in, and that <HI>good</HI> don't belong to the opposite party, but are intruders on each hand; and they would attribute the <HI>evil</HI> among themselves to others, and the good among others to themselves. And is it not from hence that our author, when he is going to reckon up a catalogue of the <HI>evil</HI> of the times, says,
<Q>If the separates are not the <HI>only</HI> guilty persons, or not <HI>MORE</HI> guilty than <HI>some</HI> that <HI>pretend</HI> to be of the <HI>standing order,</HI> yet 'tis manifest that the following dis∣orders are owing <HI>chiefly</HI> if not <HI>entirely</HI> to the <HI>SEPARA∣TIONS</HI>?</Q>
p. <HI>172.</HI> Observe, 'tis only <HI>some,</HI> and they but <HI>pretenders</HI> to be of the <HI>standing order</HI> who are allowed to be <HI>guilty,</HI> while the real guilt is laid <HI>chiefly</HI> if not <HI>entirely</HI> at the <HI>separates</HI> doors. On the other hand he says,
<Q>I know not of one <HI>principle</HI> or <HI>practice,</HI> among them that is agreeable to the gospel, but what they learned in <HI>our churches.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>113.</HI> This is a fine way indeed of treating mankind!</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="010823_0004_0F81D469F485F7F8"/>However I trust it will yet be made manifest, that it was what God taught us by his word and spirit, of the <HI>corrupti∣ons</HI> which are <HI>allowed,</HI> yea and pleaded for to this day, <HI>in</HI> those churches that caused us to separate from them. But as it seems beneath the dignity of these learned gentlemen to take notice of <HI>laymen's</HI> writings, I would, to help Mr. <HI>F's</HI> eye-sight a little, just point him to one who calls him a <HI>layman</HI> as he does us; and who has got a <HI>title</HI> as much above him, as he has above us. He has only the title of <HI>reverend,</HI> but one who has the shocking title given him of <HI>reverend Father in God,</HI> preached a sermon on <HI>Feb. 21. 1766,</HI> before the <HI>society</HI> which supports the <HI>church ministers</HI> that are sent in∣to this country; wherein he declares that '<HI>PERSECUTION</HI> for <HI>OPINIONS</HI> was the <HI>most abominable</HI> of all the errors of the <HI>antichristian</HI> church.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop of <HI>Glocester</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mon before said Society. p. 9.</NOTE> And his sermon abounds with the word <HI>charity,</HI> and he allows that our fathers were driven into this land for <HI>conscience sake;</HI> yet speaking expressly of those colonies where <HI>presbyterianism is established,</HI> and <HI>re∣mains</HI> in its <HI>ancient PURITY,</HI> he says,
<Q>That very people, whose fathers were driven for conscience sake into the <HI>waste howling wilderness,</HI> are now as ready to laugh at the bible, as at their fathers ruffs and collarbands.</Q>
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Page 12, 13.</NOTE> Here is a <HI>character</HI> given to the world of Mr. <HI>Fish's</HI> chur∣ches, by one who stands so much above them, that he treats them just as these ministers do us, namely to <HI>accuse</HI> without any <HI>proof</HI> but great <HI>swelling words</HI> of their own. And this very accusation from the bishop, is given as the reason of their continuing their labours among us, instead of going on to gospelize the <HI>savages,</HI> which he allows to be the original de∣sign of that <HI>society:</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Page 8.</NOTE> for he says,
<Q>We might well leave these factious people to themselves, did not a miserable cir∣cumstance still call for our rejected <HI>charity;</HI> I mean, the spreading of <HI>GENTILISM</HI> in the colonies themselves.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>And if we were to judge by his account it might be thought that such <HI>heathenism</HI> abounded the most in <HI>Connecticut</HI> of any part of the land; for by the list of their <HI>missionaries</HI> at the end of the bishop's sermon, it appears that they have a <HI>third</HI> more of them there, than in any other colony in <HI>America:</HI> tho' it looks more rational to me to suppose that the clegy's power being carried to the highest pitch there, is the cause of it. This prelates conduct in this matter has been justly com∣plained of as an open violation of the laws of truth and equity; yet if he were allowed our authors method, to claim all that
<PB N="viii" REF="010823_0005_0F81D46AB96B8620"/>
is good among us to his side, because our fathers came out of the church of <HI>England</HI>; then he might possibly find <HI>some</HI> such persons in <HI>New-England</HI> as he speaks of, tho' likely he might find ten to one of that character in his own <HI>diocese.</HI></P>
<P>The common name that his charity prompts him to give dissenters in that sermon is <HI>fanaticks.</HI> Now I suppose a proper definition of that name is, that 'tis one who is <HI>puft up</HI> with a <HI>fancy</HI> that he has got some <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew discovery</HI> to make to others. And if so, what shall we think of the bishop of <HI>Glocester?</HI> for he gives it in his sermon as a <HI>new discovery</HI> which he had made, that the <HI>savages</HI> ought to be <HI>civilized</HI> as well as <HI>christianized;</HI> and he attributes their little success in times past, chiefly to the want of knowing, or want of attend∣ing to that maxim. Whereas to have told the plain truth, he must have informed his honorable audience, that the reason why they had done so little to christanize the <HI>Indians,</HI> was be∣cause they had spent almost all their labours among the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> and in the most <HI>wealthy</HI> places that they could get footing in. And if he could have stooped so low as to have looked into the life of Mr. <HI>John Eliot</HI> in the last century, and the life of Mr. <HI>David Brainerd</HI> in this, he would have found, (that instead of a <HI>new discovery</HI>) the very <HI>maxim</HI> he speaks of was known and acted upon, both in the past and present age, by the most zealous and most successful labourers to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> to true christianity, that <HI>America</HI> ever saw.</P>
<P>The bishop proceeds to charge the <HI>colonists</HI> with the dread∣ful crime of yearly <HI>stealing slaves</HI> from the opposite continent, and <HI>sacrificing</HI> of them
<Q>to their great idol the <HI>GOD OF GAIN.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>25.</HI> And he says,
<Q>Nothing is more certain in itself, and apparent to all, than that the infamous traf∣fic for slaves, directly infringes both divine and human law. <HI>Nature</HI> created man free, and <HI>grace</HI> invites him to assert his freedom.</Q>
p. <HI>26.</HI> Who then could think but that this great <HI>society</HI> for the <HI>propagation</HI> of the <HI>gospel,</HI> would set all these <HI>slaves</HI> at <HI>liberty</HI> as fast as they could? But behold! The case is altered. For governor <HI>Cordington</HI> of <HI>Barbados,</HI> (instead of setting his slaves free) bequeathed a <HI>plantation stocked with them</HI> to this <HI>society;</HI> which now is declared to be a <HI>pious intention</HI> in the <HI>don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
<Q>God out of this <HI>evil</HI> (says the bishop) having made us the honored instruments of producing <HI>good.</HI></Q>
p. <HI>29.</HI> And the <HI>good</HI> which he talks of is, that while they reap the profits of those <HI>slaves,</HI> they would use them well, and so set a <HI>good example</HI> to others: And he says,
<Q>It would be impie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <HI>suspect</HI> that the society
<PB N="ix" REF="010823_0005_0F81D46AB96B8620"/>
will not persevers in making this use of so fortunate a circumstance.</Q>
<HI>p. 30.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a glass for Mr. <HI>F.</HI> to look into. A professed minister of Christ, at the head of a society, composed of the chief <HI>dignitaries of the church,</HI> and of several lords in the <HI>state,</HI> after exclaiming against persecution, <HI>charac∣teriseth</HI> the <HI>colonists</HI> as <HI>fanaticks, factious gentiles,</HI> yearly practising the worst of <HI>heathenism,</HI> even the <HI>sacrificing</HI> of <HI>human</HI> creatures to an <HI>idol;</HI> and this from the same truth that tells of <HI>pious designs</HI> in <HI>all</HI> the proceedings of his <HI>own party,</HI> and that charges it as <HI>impiety,</HI> even to <HI>suspect</HI> their <HI>perseverance</HI> therein! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And all this to move people to contribute money to that Society▪ yet church-men have as great a hand in the slave-trade as any.</NOTE> <HI>But thinkest thou, O man, that judgest them that do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps some are ready to cry, Who is this, that presumes to correct bishops and ministers at such a rate? Answer, he is a person of very little note in the learned world, and never was a member of their schools. Indeed they have given him a few titles; as sometimes he has been of a <HI>credible family,</HI> and so it was wondered at that he would go with such a despicable people; yet anon he was pronounced a <HI>young upstart,</HI> not to be regarded. One sentence decla∣red him to be a <HI>crafty deceiver</HI>; the next an <HI>honest gump∣head.</HI> Sometimes 'twas asserted that he was pursuing <HI>worldly gain;</HI> and at another time they declared that he had little or nothing for his labour, and spent his own estate: but <HI>neither so did their witness agree together.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, what little he does know, was gained in the school which Dr. <HI>Franck</HI> speaks of, where the highest wis∣dom is, to <HI>know Jesus Christ and him crucified;</HI> and wherein things are taught in an <HI>experimental</HI> way. Hence the reader will find several lessons in the ensuing pages, repeated in that manner: and tho' he is not insensible that <HI>telling of experience,</HI> is treated with contempt by the fashion∣able christians of our day, yet he is not daunted at their sneers, while he sees the chief apostle of the <HI>circumcision</HI> taking this method to satisfy his brethren; and the great apostle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> doing the same before his learned persecutors, when they were complained of, for leaving the <HI>customs of their fathers,</HI> Acts <HI>11.4▪—18.</HI> &amp; <HI>22.1—21.</HI> One special order of that school is,
<Q>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful <HI>works of darkness,</HI> but rather <HI>reprove them.</HI> But all things that are <HI>reproved,</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="010823_0006_0F81D46BD78623F8"/>
are made <HI>manifest</HI> by the <HI>light.</HI></Q>
This he takes to be a sufficient warrant for improving a fair opportunity to at∣tempt to hold up light to his fellow men, and to labour to convince all he can, be they ever so much above him, where∣in they have mistook darkness for light; and he expects the same from others.</P>
<P>He would be far from representing Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> as <HI>singular</HI> in what he has now published. No, his sermons are a proper <HI>specimen</HI> of what has often been delivered from pul∣pits in our land, for more than <HI>20</HI> years; and being per∣suaded that many worthy men, both in public and private stations, have not known the true state of these affairs, therefore the author was induced to enlarge more upon them, than his love of brevity would otherwise have permit∣ted. And may we all so speak and so hear and do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</P>

<HEAD>The Introduction. Containing some brief Remarks upon the <HI>Characters</HI> which Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> gives of a Church of Christ.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HOSE who desire to bring any controversy to a just issue, will endeavor to hold up what light they can, concerning the merits of the cause, and not amuse or perplex others minds with things foreign from the things in hand: therefore, as Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> begins his preface with this informa∣tion, that
<Q>The special occasion of the following discourses was, the revival of the spirit and principles of <HI>separation</HI> and <HI>anababtism</HI>;</Q>
I shall endeavor, according to the light I may be favoured with, to attend closely to these points, and shew wherein the difference between us lies, and the grounds of that difference.</P>
<P><Q>I heartily concur with him that the <HI>truth</HI> which <HI>Peter</HI> confessed, or the person of Christ, of whom this confession is made, <HI>is the rock,</HI> upon which Jesus Christ resolves to build his church;</Q>
and that <HI>Peter</HI> was
<Q>one of those <HI>lively stones,</HI> or precious materials of that building.</Q>
page 3. But I can't say so of some of the <HI>characters</HI> which he gives to describe the church of Christ by; the first of which is,</P>
<P><Q>That Jesus Christ has but one church in the world, and that it is the <HI>same which it always was.</HI></Q>
To ex∣plain which he says,
<Q>We gentile believers were graffed in among the Jewish believers, making one church. As the apostle Paul shews, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.17. And the whole is but the continuation of the same church, from the be∣ginning of the world.</Q>
p. 6.7. It is readily granted that the <HI>invisible</HI> church is always the same; but that is not what Mr. F. intends: for he has just before said,
<Q>I mean to speak of Christ's <HI>visible Church</HI> upon earth.— which contains both good and bad, true believers and nominal.</Q>
And his <HI>sixth charctter</HI> of the church is only an explanation of this: which is, that
<Q>The church of

Christ has always consisted of visible believing parents and their children bound together by covenant to be the Lords.</Q>
p. 22. And after some discourse upon <HI>A∣braham's</HI> covenant he says,
<Q>Hence it appears that believ∣ing parents cannot enter into <HI>that</HI> covenant which God made with <HI>Abraham,</HI> without taking their children with them.—They therefore that take God for their God, but not the God of their seed, <HI>equally so</HI>; they leave out <HI>half,</HI> or the <HI>greater part</HI> of the subjects of it.</Q>
p. 24, 25. He adds
<Q>If any say that this promise <HI>To thee and thy seed after thee,</HI> under the gospel, intends thy <HI>seed</HI> or <HI>children</HI> when they are grown up, or be∣come <HI>actual believers</HI>; and not while they are in a state of infancy, I apprehend the exposition will not stand.</Q>
And after citing <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.10, &amp;c. he says,
<Q>Here you see, that great and small, parents and children, even little ones, stand forth in a body, that they might all enter into (or renew) covenant with their God.—Which shows that <HI>children,</HI> even <HI>infants</HI> were always reckoned a part of that <HI>body</HI> or <HI>church,</HI> which the Lord gathered in Abraham's family.</Q>
p. 25, 26.</P>
<P>Tis true that this was the constitution of the church which was gathered in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s family, as appears from verse 13 which is, <HI>That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>But when Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> says,
<Q>Is it not altogether reason∣able to suppose that the christian church is made up of the same materials that the jewish church was?</Q>
The answer must be No, by no means; because God has said the contrary; and 'tis perfect madness to set up our <HI>sup∣positions</HI> and <HI>reasonings</HI> against divine revelation. Now that God has said the contrary, appears from <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.31, 32. Where he says,
<Q>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a <HI>new covenant</HI> with the house of <HI>Israel; not according to the covenant</HI> that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of <HI>Egypt.</HI></Q>
Those who stood forth then as a body to enter into covenant, tho' they had seen great signs and miracles; yet the Lord had not given them an <HI>heart to perceive, eyes to see,</HI> nor <HI>ears to hear,</HI> unto that day. But of this new covenant he says,
<Q>I will put my law in their <HI>inward parts,</HI> and write it in <HI>their hearts,</HI> and I <HI>will</HI> be their God, and they <HI>shall</HI> be
<PB N="13" REF="010823_0007_0F81D46C29DD1A20"/>
my people; and they shall <HI>all know me</HI> from the <HI>least</HI> of them unto the <HI>greatest</HI> of them, saith the Lord.</Q>
The constitution, priesthood and ordinances of the jewish church, served unto the <HI>example</HI> and <HI>shadow</HI> of heavenly things; but this is a <HI>better</HI> covenant which is established upon <HI>better promises.</HI> That <HI>old</HI> covenant Israel <HI>brake,</HI> and he <HI>regarded them not</HI>: But this <HI>new</HI> covenant is established upon better promises, which are, <HI>I will,</HI> and <HI>they shall. Heb.</HI> 8.5—13.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine that 'tis possible for words to express more plainly than these do, that there is an essential diffe∣rence between the <HI>materials,</HI> as well as the <HI>forms</HI> of the two churches; even the same that there is between shadow and substance, flesh and spirit, type and antitype. All <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <HI>natural</HI> seed were circumcised, and God said, <HI>my covenant shall be in your flesh</HI>; and all his seed in a <HI>gospel</HI> sense have the law written in their <HI>hearts,</HI> and their <HI>sins</HI> shall be <HI>remembered no more.</HI> Heb. 10.16, 17. Accor∣dingly it was such as <HI>gladly received the word,</HI> and <HI>such as should be saved,</HI> that were <HI>added to the church,</HI> in the apostles times, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. And when some of a contrary cha∣racter got in, they are said to <HI>creep in unawares,</HI> Gal. 2.4. Jude 4. Therefore I think we may justly return our au∣thor's question, and say,
<Q>Is it not altogether <HI>unreasonable</HI> to suppose that the christian church is made up of the same materials the jewish church was, since the holy Ghost has so plainly declared the contrary?</Q></P>
<P>Having given a few of my thoughts upon Mr. <HI>Fish</HI>'s <HI>first</HI> mark of a true church; and also of his <HI>sixth</HI> which explained it, I come to his <HI>second,</HI> which is, that the churches "Foundation is one, and ever the same." p. 7. This is strictly true of the invisible church, but the leaders of the visible church when Jesus came, where <HI>builders</HI> who set at nought this glorious <HI>corner-stone</HI>; and he shews that none build on the <HI>Rock</HI> but such as <HI>hear his sayings and do them,</HI> Mat. 7.24. Faith cometh by hearing: and those who hear and believe with their <HI>hearts,</HI> ought to confess with their <HI>mouths,</HI> and obey all Christ's commands, and thus they are <HI>built up for an habitation of God thro' the Spirit.</HI> In this sense I would join with him.</P>
<P>His <HI>third</HI> mark is, that
<Q>Christ Jesus was always the head and king of his church.</Q>
p. 9. So he is: and I heartily concur with him that our Lord Jesus
<Q>has done enough to make us tremble at the thoughts of attempting any
<PB N="14" REF="010823_0008_0F81D46D1C4DAE88"/>
thing, in his house and worship, which he has not directed us to do, much more any thing that he has forbidden.</Q></P>
<P>Our authors fourth character is,
<Q>Christ's church has always been furnished with officers of his appointing.</Q>
p. 11. Here again we agree in general truths; but when he comes to trace the order down from the beginning, why was his memory so short as never to mention the <HI>prophets</HI> in the jewish church, while he enlarges upon the case of the <HI>priests</HI> and <HI>Levites</HI>? Perhaps he might think the latter would best agree with his notion of a <HI>line</HI> of <HI>succession</HI>; but he may find himself mistaken there. For after the return of the <HI>Jews</HI> from <HI>Babylon,</HI> some of the children of the <HI>priests,</HI> sought their <HI>register</HI> among those that were reckoned by <HI>genealogy,</HI> but they were not found: therefore they were, as <HI>polluted, put from the priesthood.</HI> Ezra 2.62. Now if the power of ordination is not in the <HI>church,</HI> but is <HI>wholly</HI> committed to the <HI>ministers</HI> of the churches, as Mr. <HI>F.</HI> expresly holds (p. 80.145.) then, according to this plain example, every minister who can't produce the <HI>register</HI> of his ordination, as being derived in an <HI>uninterrupted line</HI> down from the apostles, he ought as <HI>polluted</HI> to be <HI>put from the</HI> ministry. And where will he and his brethren be then?</P>
<P>Indeed he would have us think that they have such a re∣gister where the very <HI>names</HI> of such a line is preserved. p. 18. But it seems by the margin that 'tis in <HI>Latin,</HI> and as we are come out of the <HI>Latin</HI> church, we shall expect to hear it in <HI>English</HI> before we believe it. <HI>Paul's charge</HI> is not to give heed to <HI>fables and endless genealogies,</HI> which minister <HI>quest∣ions,</HI> rather than <HI>godly edifying.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.4. And how fully have these words been verified in the disputes which <HI>catholics, prelates,</HI> and <HI>presbyters</HI> have had upon this affair these many hundred years? and it still ministers <HI>question</HI> which are as much unresolved, as when they began the dispute.</P>
<P>Our author's <HI>fifth</HI> character is, that
<Q>The church of Christ is a confederate people, a people in visible covenant with God and with one another,</Q>
p. 19. This is true, and so is his <HI>seventh,</HI> that 'tis
<Q>further known by special ordinances which God hath given it,</Q>
p. 34. Tho' it ought to be remembred that the false church hath covenants and ordinances as well as the true, only the true church endeavours to keep to the divine pattern; while the false, adds inventions of her own. These are therefore by no means so plain marks to distinguish the true church as his <HI>eighth</HI> and last is; viz. that
<Q>Christ's church has always had,
<PB N="15" REF="010823_0008_0F81D46D1C4DAE88"/>
and always will have his holy spirit dwelling in it.</Q>
p. 44. This is a great truth; for if one church as well as person, have not the <HI>Spirit of Christ,</HI> it is <HI>none of his.</HI> Thus I have given a little touch upon the <HI>characteristics</HI> which Mr. F. has given of the church: two of them I think are not true, in the others we agree in general, tho' when we come to ap∣ply them the difference between us will more distinctly open in many particulars.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Part. I. The <HI>constitution</HI> which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pleads for, opened, and proved to be essentially different from the first churches in this Country.</HEAD>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> comes to apply these characters, he, to prepare the way promiseth several things, the substance of which are, That the rule is perfect, but the best of men are imperfect, so that when they come with honest hearts to ap∣ply divine rules, they differ so widely in their opinions upon some modes of worship, as to render it difficult, if not im∣practicable for them to worship harmoniously together: which shews the necessity as well as grounds of mutal for∣bearance, and should make us cautious how we give hard names. These are weighty considerations, and if they had continued with due weight upon his mind thro' his follow∣ing discourses, it would doubtless have prevented my troub∣ling him in the affair; but since it has proved to be o∣therwise, I will <HI>also give mine opinion</HI>; and then leave it with the reader to judge for himself.</P>
<P>Our author first applies his rules to those which he calls <HI>standing churches,</HI> and he says,
<Q>We have sufficient reason to be comfortably satisfied that these churches are true churches of Jesus Christ.</Q>
p. 78. As to their <HI>constitution,</HI> he says,
<Q>They are in general of the <HI>congre∣gational</HI> way; and altho' in many parts, particularly in this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Connecticut.</NOTE> colony, they are for mutual benefit, <HI>consociated</HI> or united together by agreement, yet they remain <HI>con∣gregational,</HI> p. 79.</Q></P>
<P>This title, as I understand, is derived from the fathers of this country, therefore we must look there for its true meaning. Now <HI>Cambridge platform</HI> says, the church since the coming of Christ is
<Q>only congregational, therefore neither national, provincial nor classical.</Q>
National churches have their parishes, for managing the common affairs of their worship, who yet are under the government of the whole: But the plan before us in express distinction therefrom, has the whole power of church goverment in
<PB N="16" REF="010823_0009_0F81D46DA85DB998"/>
each particular church,
<Q>power to open and shut, to chuse and refuse, to constitute in office, and remove from office.</Q>
This is the express meaning of the name, as it is explained by our fathers who gave it: And tho' they freely improved the advice and assistance of other chur∣ches, yet it was <HI>sisters</HI> or <HI>equals,</HI> who still had the whole right of government within each church.</P>
<P>And are the standing churches such? No, Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has not got two pages forward, before he lays down this as the first thing which <HI>ought</HI> to be <HI>corrected</HI> in the churches, viz.
<Q>The imposition of hands at the ordaining of elders, which, says he, I apprehend the gospel has committed <HI>wholly</HI> to the care of the <HI>presbytery,</HI> or <HI>ministers</HI> of the churches; but is by the indulgent <HI>Cambridge</HI> platform, disposed of to the <HI>brethren,</HI> at the pleasure of the church.</Q>
p. 80. Thus while he usurps the name, be∣cause 'tis credible, he denies a principal point in its meaning, and directly sets up a power above the churches; for, if the power of ordination is not <HI>in</HI> the church, then she must be beholden to a power <HI>without</HI> her, and so <HI>above</HI> her, to give her office-authority. But our fathers had seen too much of this spiritual tyranny, to be willing to come under it again; and as they knew that the <HI>church of the living God,</HI> is <HI>the pillar and ground of the truth,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 3.15. John 3.9, 10.</NOTE> they rested the matter there, and desired with <HI>Timothy</HI> to behave as they ought, <HI>in the house of God</HI>; but not like <HI>Diotrephes</HI> to love a <HI>pre-eminence over it.</HI> However Mr. <HI>F.</HI> would have it that their <HI>practice</HI> was not agreable to their <HI>principles,</HI> and says <HI>Plymouth</HI> church "attempted not to ordain a minister merely as a church," of brethren only, with their own hands." p. 84. But Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> who knew as well as he, informs us con∣cerning the first church in <HI>Salem,</HI> that on <HI>Aug.</HI> 6. 1629.
<Q>They proceeded to <HI>ordain their</HI> ministers; as also Mr. <HI>Houghton</HI> a ruling elder; being separated to their seve∣ral offices by the imposition of the hands of some of the <HI>brethren</HI> appointed by the church thereto: Governor <HI>Bradford</HI> and others, as <HI>messengers</HI> from the church of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> being by cross winds hindred from being pre∣sent in the former part of the service, came time enough to give them the <HI>right hand of fellowship.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">New-England chronology p. 190, 191.</NOTE> If any say these ministers had been ordained by bishops before, I an∣swer, that they were now <HI>out of that order,</HI> and we are expresly told that one of them was "<HI>silenced</HI> for noncon∣formity,"
<PB N="17" REF="010823_0009_0F81D46DA85DB998"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New-England cronology, Page 182.</NOTE> And they did not hold the <HI>indelible character,</HI> but were, as we have just seen, so consistent as to know that
<Q>to constitute in office, &amp; remove from office, are acts belong∣ing to the same power,</Q>
therefore, as they were put <HI>out</HI> of office, by the <HI>same power</HI> that put them <HI>in,</HI> they were now or∣dained anew. The like was done to Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> the first mini∣ster of <HI>Boston.</HI> Indeed a late honorable historian tells us, con∣cerning him, that
<Q>all joined in a protestation that it was not a renouncing of the ministry he received in <HI>England,</HI> but that it was a confirmation, in consequence of their election.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hutchinson</HI>'s history of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> vol. I. p. 419.</NOTE> Upon which I would desire leave to observe, that none could have reason to think that they renounced his right to im∣prove his ministerial <HI>gift</HI>; but tis plain that they judged <HI>this ordination</HI> to be needful to put him into the <HI>office</HI> here. And the same author informs us in the next page, that one distinguishing character of a congregational church is,
<Q>That there is no jurisdiction to which particular churches are or ought to be subject, by way of authoritative censure, nor any other <HI>church power,</HI> extrinsical to such churches, which they ought to depend upon <HI>any other sort of men</HI> for the exercise of.</Q></P>
<P>Here the point turns: We all hold it proper occasionally to improve the advice and gifts of other churches, while all are equal as to power: but all ministers who think they have a power to impart to another church, which that church has not within itself, and has not a right to exercise without assistance received from abroad; they are not congregational men, let them pretend what they will.</P>
<P>Another great point in the congregational plan is, that the "power to open and shut," is in the church as a bo∣dy; and therefore that they all ought to hear and judge of the evidence that any give of their right to be received as members. Dr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> says,
<Q>There is <HI>no congregational</HI> man, but he <HI>reports to the church</HI> some∣thing of what the person desiring communion with them, has related to him; which the <HI>presbyterian</HI> does not, only declares his own satisfaction, and giveth the brethren a liberty to object against their conversation.</Q>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mitchel's Life. dedicat. p. 23.</NOTE> And he tells us, that in the declaration of the <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>order</HI> of the <HI>congregational churches</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> given at <HI>Savoy,</HI> Oct. 12. 1658. They declare, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 24.</NOTE>
<Q>That the
<PB N="18" REF="010823_0010_0F81D47153D83EF8"/>
members of particular churches are saints by calling, visibly manifesting their obedience to the call of Christ, who being further known to each other, by their con∣fession of saith, wrought <HI>in them</HI> by the power of God, <HI>declared by themselves,</HI> or otherwise manifested, consent to walk together according to the appointment of Christ.</Q>
The doctor further says,
<Q>It is evident, that the church (and not the officers only) have power given them by Christ to judge who are meet to be <HI>put out</HI> of their communion. Matt. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.12. Then they must needs have the like power as to those that are to be <HI>taken into</HI> their communion.</Q>
And is this the way now of the churches Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pleads for? No, I never knew an instance in my day, of any who were admitted into any of those churches, by declaring <HI>perso∣nally the saith wrought in</HI> their souls; and a great part of them have now dropt even giving <HI>written relations.</HI></P>
<P>This leads us down to a third article of difference which is the root of all, namely, the <HI>matter</HI> of a gospel church. We have already seen that Mr. <HI>F.</HI> supposeth that the
<Q>christian church is made up of the same <HI>materials</HI> that the jewish church was.</Q>
But the <HI>Cambridge</HI> platform expressly says,
<Q>The <HI>matter</HI> of a visible church are saints by calling, 1 Cor. 1.2. Eph. 1.1.</Q>
and that the church
<Q>under the law, was <HI>national,</HI> which since the coming of Christ is <HI>only congregational</HI>; therefore neither national, provincial nor classical.</Q>
Yet Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> has the face to tell the world that their
<Q>churches are, in general, pro∣perly <HI>congregational.</HI></Q>
And then goes on to produce the testimony of president <HI>Oaks</HI> in favour of that plan, as the "highest step that has been taken towards <HI>reformation</HI>;" to which he says,
<Q>The venerable Dr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> adds the weight of his approbation,</Q>
p. 80. After which, a long quotation is produced from the doctor in favor of the <HI>college,</HI> from whence almost all the churches were sup∣plied with ministers; yet he stopt a little too short at last; for that venerable author's next words are these, viz.
<Q>Nor are the churches like to continue <HI>pure golden can∣dlesticks,</HI> if the <HI>college,</HI> which should supply them, prove <HI>apostate.</HI></Q>
And in the same book, he lets us know what he means by that dreadful name,
<Q>The deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing, says he, the <HI>matter</HI> of particular churches must needs corrupt them. A learned and renowned author (i. e. Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>) has evidenced that the letting go this principle, that
<PB N="19" REF="010823_0010_0F81D47153D83EF8"/>
particular churches ought to consist of <HI>regenerate per∣sons,</HI> brought in the great <HI>apostate of the christian church.</HI> The way to prevent the like <HI>apostacy,</HI> (says Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>) in these churches, is to require an <HI>account</HI> of those that offer themselves to communion therein, concerning the <HI>work of God on their souls,</HI> as well as concerning their knowlege and belief.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mitchel's life. dedicat. p. 27. &amp; 16.</NOTE> And he tells us <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10.</NOTE> that
<Q>Blessed Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> would frequently assert, that if it should pass for current doctrine in <HI>New-England,</HI> that all persons <HI>orthodox in judgment,</HI> as to matters of faith, not <HI>scanda∣lous in life,</HI> ought to be admitted to partake of the Lord's supper, without an examination, concerning the <HI>work of saving grace in their hearts,</HI> it would be a real <HI>apostacy</HI> from former principles.</Q></P>
<P>And are ministers now of these sentiments? A worthy gentleman told me that he sat a number of years at <HI>Mar∣blehead,</HI> under the ministry of <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">He has been president of <HI>Harvard College</HI> this 30 years.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Holyoke,</HI> before he was elected president of the same college that these words were directed to; and that his common method of admitting members into the church was without giving them any relation of experiences at all, either verbal or written; and that has now got to be a prevailing custom in many parts of the country. Yet ministers pretend to be upon the same foundation with those fathers. But here is a treble testimony that they are <HI>apostates</HI> therefrom. And Dr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> had such a view of its coming on, that he said in the year 1700, that
<Q>If the begun <HI>apostacy</HI> should pro∣ceed as fast the next thirty years, as it has done the last, surely it will come to that in <HI>New-England,</HI> (except the gospel itself depart with the order of it) that the most conscientious people therein, will think themselves con∣cerned to <HI>gather churches out of churches.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See the preface to his vindication of the order of the churches in <HI>New-England.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Now we may form some judgment how far this aposta∣cy had proceeded, when our separation began, more than forty years afterwards, by a sort of <HI>pastoral letter,</HI> which all the ministers in <HI>Windham</HI> county published against us; wherein they say,
<Q>This notion of a pure church, as se∣parating the converted from the unconverted, is contra∣ry to the revealed will of God. This is as evident as any thing can be by that way of evidence, in divers pa∣rables of our Savior,</Q>
p. 20. The first parable which
<PB N="20" REF="010823_0011_0F81D4720F00BA90"/>
they refer us to, is that of the <HI>tares of the field,</HI> in Matt. 13.24, &amp;c. And they say,
<Q>Our Savior explains it to his disciples, as you see from verse 37. Where he says, <HI>The field is the world</HI>; in which therefore is this king∣dom of heaven. <HI>The good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one.</HI> Both the one and the other are in the kingdom of heaven which is in this world, i. e. <HI>the visible church,</HI></Q>
p. 21. And after giving their thoughts upon several other scriptures, they say,
<Q>There are many other texts which might be urged, and plainly shew, that it is the will of Christ, that all those who make an <HI>out∣ward credible profession of christianity,</HI> should be admit∣ted into his church, and tho' <HI>unconverted be there</HI> among the wheat the honorable vessels, so long as he has a church in the world, that they may be under proper ordinances for their conversion, and for the trial of his people, and their usefulness to them, &amp;c.</Q>
p. 23.</P>
<P>I leave the reader to judge how near this doctrine comes to what Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> and other fathers call <HI>apostacy,</HI> and also how <HI>current</HI> this doctrine has past, when the ministers of a whole county, have published it to the world; and world only remark here, that they have done like those who formerly made <HI>void</HI> the divine command by their own <HI>traditions</HI>; for as they have contradicted our saviour in ex∣plaining the parable of the <HI>tares,</HI> and the <HI>field</HI> which he says is the <HI>world,</HI> they say is the <HI>church</HI>; so they have made void his command in this very affair. His command is, <HI>Let both grow together</HI>: but their practice has said, No, they shall not; for as soon as any appear'd against their schemes, they would not let them grow, nor enjoy their natural rights. Mr <HI>Finley,</HI> who has since been president of <HI>New Jersey</HI> college, happened to come in those times to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and only for his preaching to the separates there, he was taken up by civil officers and carried out of the colony; and those who belong'd among us, that ven∣tured publickly to improve their gifts without the ministers licence, were not suffered to enjoy <HI>worldly</HI> privileges, but were taken up one after another, and cast into prison. Yea, these very men who cried so loud for <HI>Peace,</HI> yet <HI>prepared</HI> such <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst</HI> those who would not <HI>put into their moth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Micah <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 5.</NOTE> as not only to load them with slander and re∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but also to send their servants, and takeaway their goods by <HI>force</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 2.16.</NOTE> This was done in many places, till the
<PB N="21" REF="010823_0011_0F81D4720F00BA90"/>
practice became so odious that none would buy such goods; and then they took to seizing their persons. I have an ac∣count before me of no less than <HI>eleven</HI> persons who were seized thus and carried to jail in <HI>Norwich</HI> only in 8 months, after <HI>June</HI> 17, 1752. one of which was a <HI>widow</HI> 54 years old who belonged to another church, where she attended, and did her part towards the support of divine worship, ac∣cording to her conscience, and had no concern with the parish minister; therefore she did not think that the rate which was demanded for him was just: yet for her refu∣sing to pay it, she was taken, and, tho' a weakly woman was carried to prison in a dark rainy night. One told them then that it look'd like the <HI>works of darkness.</HI> But the christian character she bore, and the christian temper which she and others then discovered, greatly weakened the cause they designed to promote hereby.</P>
<P>Not long after, a gentleman in the same place, was im∣prisoned for the same cause, while he stood a representative for the town, in the general court. About the same time a single woman of a good character, in <HI>Raynham,</HI> was con∣fined more than 12 months in <HI>Taunton</HI> goal, which the mi∣nister might have prevented by crossing out, only an <HI>eight penny</HI> rate. At length the evidence she gave of true <HI>con∣scientiousness</HI> in the matter, caused such uneasiness among that minister's own people, that they raised money and went and set her at liberty. This is but a little sketch of what has been done of that nature, in various parts of our land.</P>
<P>If any say, Why are these odious things published now? I answer, <HI>Is there not a cause</HI>? When the <HI>Jesuits</HI> complained a few years ago to the king of <HI>Spain,</HI> that many things were published against them, and desired him to for∣bid it; his reply was,
<Q>The way not to have <HI>faults</HI> pub∣lished, is <HI>not to commit them.</HI></Q>
These are often called, <HI>standing churches</HI>; therefore one design of this is to shew what they <HI>stand upon</HI>; even the same that other <HI>national</HI> or <HI>provincial</HI> churches do,—<HI>civil authority.</HI> Hence, how often do they tell us, "That if it where not for the support of the civil powers, their churches would soon be broken up?" And an author of great note has lately told the world that,
<Q>After all that may be said in favour of the <HI>constitution,</HI> the <HI>strength</HI> of it lay in the union de∣clared with the civil authority.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hutchinson's</HI> history of the <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> p. 434.</NOTE> And he gives us an instance of what the authority did to preserve order more than a 100 years ago. He says, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 188.</NOTE> "In 1653 the general

court restrain'd
<Q>the north church in <HI>Boston,</HI> from call∣ing Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> to be their minister, who had the cha∣racter of a <HI>well gifted,</HI> tho' illiterate man.</Q>
And about the same time he tells us,
<Q>They laid a large sins upon the church at <HI>Malden</HI> for chusing a minister without the consent and approbation of the neighbour∣ing churches, and allowance of the magistrates.</Q>
And
<Q>he says Mr. <HI>Hubbard</HI> observed upon that occasion that, All men are naturally so wedded to their own apprehen∣sions that unless there be a <HI>coercive power</HI> to restrain, the order and rule of the gospel will not be attended.</Q></P>
<P>I am much obliged to his Honor for the ingenuous ac∣count which he has given us of former times: yet I shall take the liberty to say, that if he was not unaw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, a little <HI>wedded</HI> to his own apprehensions, I hardly think he would have called this, a <HI>just observation</HI>; for elsewhere, speaking of the tests which had been imposed by authority in both Englands to produce <HI>uniformity in religion,</HI> he says,
<Q>Both the one and the other must have occasioned much <HI>formality</HI> and <HI>hypocrisy.</HI> The mysteries of our holy religi∣on have been <HI>prostituted</HI> to mere <HI>secular views and advan∣tages.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 431.</NOTE> Now the <HI>test</HI> refer'd to, restrained <HI>civil freemen</HI> from chusing any into civil offices, who were not church members; and is it not as bad to restrain the <HI>Lord's free∣men</HI> from chusing any into office in his church, who have not been members of human schools of learning?</P>
<P>"The experience of all reformed churches," is appealed to for proof, that this <HI>coercive</HI> power is needful to keep the <HI>order of the gospel</HI>: but the same appeal might more justly be made, to prove that the clergy, when <HI>thus</HI> sup∣ported, have been the most tyrannical of all men; which has often served to harden infidels against all gospel prea∣chers. A plain reason why such men have been the most tyrannical, is because they claim authority, more immediate∣ly from the <HI>higher</HI> power, than others do. Tho' civil authority is of divine appointment, as well as ecclesiasti∣cal; yet the highest civil rulers know, that they are set up and supported by men, while the others claim a com∣mission from God. Hence they have often assumed autho∣rity over the very rulers that set them up.</P>
<P>And since we are often represented as <HI>rebels</HI>; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> who has been a minister in <HI>Norwich,</HI> the place of my nativity, above fifty years, expresly compares our separation to a rebellion in the STATE, Sermon at Mr. <HI>Hart's</HI> ordination, p. 18. And he with six other ministers as plainly compared us to <HI>Core</HI> and his company, in their preface to Mr. <HI>Dickinson's</HI> dia∣logue, p. 7. Now observe <HI>Core</HI> raised a <HI>rebellion</HI> in <HI>Israel,</HI> where ruler, priest and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aws were appointed immediately from heaven; and where the church was not <HI>national</HI>: yet it has been the constant method of these, who pretend to be <HI>congregational</HI> men, for these 20 years, to compare us to <HI>Core,</HI> which naturally implies, that they think themselves to be like <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI></NOTE> I will
<PB N="23" REF="010823_0012_0F81D472CE2BCEC0"/>
a little further lay open my views of this affair; which are, that, as civil rulers ought to be men fearing God, and hating covetousness, and to be terrors to evil doers, and a praise to them who do well; and as ministers ought to pray for rulers, and to teach the people to be subject to them; So there may and ought to be a sweet harmony between them▪ yet as there is a great difference between the nature of their work, they never ought to have <HI>such a union</HI> together, as was described above.</P>
<P>For, 1. The holy ghost calls the orders and laws of civil states <HI>ordinances of man,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.13. But all the rules and orders of divine worship are <HI>ordinances of God</HI>; and it <HI>defi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the earth under</HI> its <HI>inhabitants,</HI> when these <HI>laws</HI> are <HI>transgressed,</HI> and <HI>ordinances changed.</HI> Isa. 24.5. And one of his laws is,
<Q>AS EVERY man hath received the <HI>gift, even so</HI> minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If <HI>any man speak,</HI> let him speak as the oracles of God; if <HI>any man minister,</HI> let him do it as of the <HI>ability</HI> which GOD GIVETH: that GOD <HI>in all things may be glorified thro' Jesus Christ.</HI></Q>
1 Pet. 4.10, 11. But this law and or∣der has been so much <HI>changed</HI> in our land, that churches have not looked so much at the <HI>ability</HI> which <HI>God</HI> has <HI>given,</HI> as to the <HI>titles</HI> which <HI>man</HI> has <HI>bestowed.</HI> I say <HI>titles,</HI> for many of their ministers have not <HI>gifts</HI> to deliver a sermon without <HI>reading</HI>; notwithstanding their <HI>name</HI> of being <HI>learned</HI> men. And yet it is called, the
<Q>order of the gos∣pel,</Q>
now, to have such men's <HI>persons in admiration</HI> so as not to chuse any others into the ministry, <HI>lest man's glory should be brought down,</HI> while we are represented as proud rebels, for not owning them as such.</P>
<P N="2">2. The civil magistrates work is, to promote order and peace among men, in their moral behaviour towards each other, so that every person among all denominations who doth <HI>that which is good</HI> may <HI>have praise of the same</HI>; and and that all contrary behaviour may be restrained, or
<PB N="24" REF="010823_0013_0F81D472F7F5F938"/>
forcibly punished. And as all sorts of men are members of civil society and partake of the benefits of such government, therefore they ought to be <HI>subject,</HI> and pay <HI>tribute</HI> to rulers. Rom. 13.1 —6. But the work of gospel ministers is to labour to <HI>open</HI> mens <HI>eyes,</HI> and to <HI>turn them from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> Acts. 26.18. And as any kind of <HI>force</HI> tends to shut the eyes rather than open them; therefore Christ's special orders to his first ministers were, <HI>Freely ye have received, freely give. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words; when ye depart out of that house, or city, shake off the dust of your feet,</HI> Mat. 10.8, 14. This should be a <HI>testimony</HI> against them, that Christ's ministers had not forcibly ta∣ken from them so much as the dust of their city, Luk. 9.5.</P>
<P>But we have a set of men in our day, who profess to be Christ's <HI>ambassadors,</HI> and yet they act so contrary to these <HI>orders,</HI> that if they once can get footing in a town or pa∣rish, let people dislike them ever so much, they will not go out without a considerable quantity of white or yellow <HI>dust.</HI> Yea, we have had several instances, wherein both church and society have been wearied out with these men, and have voted them out of their meeting-house, and yet where a little number would follow them, they have held meeting in their own house for months or years, and then have applied to the powers which these churches <HI>stand upon,</HI> and they have <HI>forced</HI> the whole parish to pay the mi∣nister for all that time. And one minister has lately found out, that for any to come and profess to
<Q>preach the gospel <HI>freely, without being chargeable to their bearers</HI>; is so far from being an evidence that they are the <HI>true ministers</HI> of Jesus Christ, and <HI>sent by</HI> him, that 'tis (<HI>ex∣traordinaries excepted</HI>) an argument why they should be suspected,</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> page 63.65. <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> is a great word, and great things are done by it. The power of Christ in <HI>qualifying</HI> men for the ministry, without going to <HI>colleges</HI> for them, is here∣by limited to the apostles days; and all are rejected with con∣tempt by Mr. <HI>F.</HI> who do not now receive their <HI>gifts</HI> at <HI>college,</HI> and their <HI>authority</HI> from "authorized hands," p. 15,—17. And these "authorized hands," by the help of this word have got such an <HI>extraordinary</HI> power as the apostles never had. For the apostles were only <HI>witness</HI> for Christ, and as such pointed out to the church, what qualifications officers should have, and said, <HI>Brethren look ye out among you</HI> such men, Act. 8. &amp; 6.3. But these pretended successors of the apostles, assume a power to limit the church, in her choice to such as they have <HI>approbated</HI>; which I trust will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de evident to be a power which the apostles never had.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="010823_0013_0F81D472F7F5F938"/>This is indeed an extraordinary discovery, and he seems not a little pleased with it. And it must be acknowleged that if this be a true discovery, we are in a deplorable case; for we used to think the gospel's being <HI>freely preach∣ed to the poor,</HI> was a convincing evidence that the Messiah is come, (Mat. 11.5.) And if it is not so, we have been hitherto deluded, and must look out for new teach∣ings, if not for a new bible.</P>
<P>However we will endeavor to search our old bible a lit∣tle more before we part with it. The passage which our au∣thor attempts to draw this new discovery from, is 2 Cor. 11, 12. Now a material point, in order to come at the meaning of the text, is to know what those false apostles <HI>gloried in.</HI> Our author supposeth that they gloried in preaching freely without taking any thing for it: but in v. 20. speaking of the same persons, <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>Ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself.</HI> The clause, <HI>take of you</HI>; Dr. <HI>Gill</HI> says, the <HI>Arabic</HI> version reads,—
<Q>Took away their goods from them by <HI>force.</HI></Q>
This they did to <HI>exalt themselves</HI>: and if we look back to the foregoing chapter, we shall find, that the ways of these teachers, was to <HI>commend themselves,</HI> and despise the apostle: <HI>His bodily presence, say they, is weak, and his speech contempti∣ble.</HI> When he first appeared among that people, he <HI>wrought at tent-making,</HI> on week days, and <HI>reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 18.3, 4.</NOTE> And his <HI>preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 2.4.</NOTE> Therefore they despised him, and commended themselves, as being men who made a much better appearance, and taught in a more agreable manner than the <HI>tent-maker</HI> did: but says he, <HI>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance</HI>? <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 10.7, 10.</NOTE> —It was a special command of our Lord, <HI>Judge not according to the appear∣ance, but judge righteous judgment.</HI> And he gives this rule to judge by, namely, <HI>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh</HI> HIS <HI>glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness in him.</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John 7.18, 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is the rule to try all teachers by. The occasion of its being given was, the different opinions that people
<PB N="26" REF="010823_0014_0F81D474205004B8"/>
had concerning the teacher of teachers, some saying, <HI>He is a good man,</HI> others saying, <HI>Nay; but he deceiveth the people</HI>: and a particular difficulty which labored in their minds concerning him, was, that he had <HI>never learned letters</HI> in their way. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">verse 12.15.</NOTE> Therefore he says, judge not ac∣cording to the <HI>appearance</HI>; yet this rule was not attend∣ed to among the <HI>Corinthians</HI>; and instead of it, those teachers who despised the apostle, <HI>measured themselves by themselves, and compared themselves among themselves</HI>: but he durst not <HI>make himself of their number.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 10.12.</NOTE> These things shew what those teachers <HI>gloried</HI> in. And <HI>Paul</HI> declares his <HI>godly jealousy</HI> over the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> in the beginning of this 11th chapter; and his fear lest their minds should be <HI>corrupted</HI> from the <HI>simplicity that is in Christ.</HI> There∣fore to prevent their being further imposed upon, (tho' it be folly for a man to <HI>commend</HI> himself, yet) he would <HI>answer a fool according to his folly,</HI> to prevent their being <HI>wise in their own conceits.</HI> And he sets out to compare notes with them, and says, <HI>I suppose I was not a whit be∣hind the very chiefest apostles.</HI> And as to the low appea∣rance which he made among them, he asks, <HI>Have I com∣mitted an offence in abasing myself, that you may be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God freely?</HI> And proceeds to shew how he had received support from other churches <HI>to do them service</HI>: and he takes a solemn oath, that <HI>no man</HI> in their <HI>regions</HI> should stop him of this boast∣ing; not because he did not love them! But, says he, what <HI>I do, I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion, that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we</HI>: for <HI>such are false apostles &amp;c.</HI> Now if they had gloried in preaching for nothing, 'tis certain from v. 20. that the <HI>Corinthians</HI> knew that they practised the contrary; and <HI>Paul</HI> would not have said,—<HI>even as we,</HI> to that. Wherefore Dr. <HI>Gill</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Exposition of the new-testament, vol. 2. p. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3.</NOTE> thinks his meaning is,
<Q>That these men were desirous that he would take wages, because they did; that in this respect he might not excel them, and that they might be able to plead his example and authority, and so get an occasion of ex∣torting more money from the <HI>Corinthians</HI>: wherefore to <HI>cut off</HI> all such <HI>occasion</HI> from them, the apostle resolves to take nothing himself; that whereas they boasted they were equal to, or superior to the apostles, they might
<PB N="27" REF="010823_0014_0F81D474205004B8"/>
<HI>be found,</HI> would they follow their example, <HI>even as they,</HI> not taking any money at all of them, and poor, <HI>working with their own hands.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I cannot find the least account of their glorying in preach¦ing without wages; but I have shewn something of wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they did glory in: and the apostle proceeds further and says <HI>I speak foolishly; are they Hebrews? so am I: are they Is∣raelites? so am I: are they the seed of Abraham? so am I are they ministers of Christ? I am more.</HI> Thus he shews that as to outward appearance he could vie with them; while in real services and sufferings for Christ, he vastly exceeded them. Yea, while they had taken much from that church only for a <HI>shew</HI> of service, he had done them much <HI>real</HI> service without taking any thing at all of them.</P>
<P>I shall close this head with this remark; that while Mr. <HI>F.</HI> seems pleased with what he tho't would do great execution against us, he has unawares involved himself in a sad <HI>dilem∣ma</HI>: for if the case be as I have represented, he stands a fair chance of falling among false teachers: but if his sense of the text be right, he shews a want of <HI>Paul</HI>'s temper, and instead of cutting off occasion of being called a hireling, he still pleads up for that scheme, which often extorts wa∣ges from such as receive no service from them, in∣stead of doing real service without wages as <HI>Paul</HI> did. At the same time he endeavors artfully to blend a <HI>free</HI> support to ministers, and a <HI>forced</HI> one together; where∣as there is as much difference between them, as there is between the power of truth in the mind, and the power of the civil sword on the body. The first is abundantly clear in scripture, the other has no warrant there.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another difference between civil and ecclesiastical go∣verment is, that civil states if large, have various degrees of offices one above another, who receive their authority thro' many hands, down from the head, and that often, more according to estate or favor, than merit: but 'tis the reverse in Christ's kingdom; he forbid the first notions of this in his disciples, and expressly told them that it <HI>should not be so</HI> among them, as it was in earthly states, <HI>Mark</HI> 10.43. <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.26. An obvious reason of this difference is that an earthly king cannot in person see, to but littl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that is done in his kingdom, and therefore must trust other to manage affairs for him in his absence; but Zion's Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is present every where, and sees to all that is done, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tells every church, <HI>I know thy works</HI>: and he takes ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the faithful are supported and rewarded, and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unfaithful are corrected or punished. If civil officers a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

resisted or abused, 'tis found necessary, in order to main∣tain the dignity of government, to inflict corporal punish∣ment on the offenders, if within the state, and to take up the sword against abuses from abroad. And I suppose it is a true maxim, that
<Q>civil government and a defensive war will stand or fall together.</Q>
Hence Jesus said, <HI>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</HI> Joh. 18.36. Therefore the dignity of his government is maintained, not by <HI>carnal,</HI> but by <HI>spiritual</HI> weapons: and not by <HI>resisting,</HI> but pati∣ently <HI>bearing</HI> evil treatment. Hence when one of his chief officers was greatly abused he said, <HI>Being reviled, we bless: being persecuted, we suffer it: being defamed, we intreat: we are made the filth of the world, and are the off-scouring of all things unto this day.</HI> 1 Cor. 4.12.13. And the way in which the saints finally obtain victory over the <HI>dragon</HI> and <HI>his angels</HI> is, <HI>by the blood of the lamb, and the word of their testimony; and not loving their lives unto the death.</HI> Rev. 12.11.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular on these things, be∣cause the core of our difficulties lies here. And if the kind reader finds here but an imperfect description of the way of the churches acting upon truth, in distinction from all earthly powers, let him remember that this is a <HI>high∣way</HI> that has been very much <HI>unoccupied</HI> in later ages, and men have gone in <HI>by ways:</HI> but 'tis hoped that this <HI>good old way</HI> will speedily be opened so plainly that <HI>fools shall not err therein</HI>: and if this weak attempt may be owned as any means thereof, that will over-balance all the world's reproaches on that account. The confounding of civil and ecclesiastical affairs together has done amazing mischief in the world: and as Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> observes
<Q>The reforming churches flying from <HI>Rome,</HI> carried some of them more, some of them less, all of them something of <HI>Rome,</HI> with them, especially in that spirit of imposi∣tion and persecution, which has too much cleaved unto them all.</Q>
This was the worst mistake that our fathers brought with them to this land; &amp; tho' their posterity will generally explode those bitter <HI>fruits</HI>; yet few of them seem to be sensible of the <HI>root</HI> from whence they sprang. What our Lord said of serving two masters, may in some sense be applied to the joining of these two powers toge∣ther; one or the other will carry the day, and they have each had their turns in our land. Under the old <HI>Massa∣chusetts</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="010823_0015_0F81D47482723880"/>
charter, none could be so much as <HI>freemen</HI> in the state, till they were members of the church; and such as afterwards fell under church-censure were not allowed to sit in the court. And struggles on these points were a principal cause of loosing that charter. But now the scale is so far turned, that 'tis a professed rule with many mini∣sters, not to deal with any person in the church for moral evil, 'till they are convicted in the state. A great turn indeed!</P>
<P>As nearness tends to beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t likeness, so there have been several attempts made in our land, to establish various de∣grees of power in ecclesiastical, as there is in civil rule. This was tried for above sixty years ago in the <HI>Massachu∣setts</HI> province; but it was prevented there; yet Mr. <HI>Sal∣tonstal</HI> who had quitted the pulpit in <HI>New-London,</HI> for the governors chair in <HI>Connecticut</HI> colony, brought in the scheme there soon after for a clasicial power in each county, that men might appeal to, as they do from an inferior to a superior court! and after much contention it was, estab∣lished by law; only with this reserve. That as many as would, might dissent from it. My honoured grandfather, <HI>Joseph Bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> with the other representative from <HI>Norwich,</HI> soon felt the effect of this new power; for as they had thought it duty to oppose it in the court, so they did also in the church. But Mr. <HI>Woodward</HI> the minister was re∣solute to bring in the scheme there, and got a majority on his side; therefore rather than come under such a yoke, they, with a considerable part of the church withdrew, and held a separate meeting three months; and then the mini∣ster consented to have the matter tried by a council, tho' in the mean time he had laid them under <HI>church censure</HI>; an account of which being conveyed to the general <HI>court,</HI> the representatives were not suffered to sit therein. Such were the early effects of this new power. However, af∣ter many councils and much fatigue, <HI>a sum of money</HI> pre∣vailed with that minister to quit his place, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And rarely can any society now, get rid of a bad minister, but <HI>by that means.</HI></NOTE> and the church in <HI>Norwich</HI> resolved to continue upon their old platform.</P>
<P>These and such-like things prevented that new plan, called <HI>Saybrook regulation,</HI> from taking so deep effect as many intended it should: yet they obtained one great arti∣cle of power thereby, which they have generally held ever since, and that is the <HI>licencing of candidates for the mini∣stry,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="010823_0016_0F81D4753A87D360"/>
and so <HI>limiting</HI> the churches to such in their choice of pastors. Yea this spiritual court has attempted to de∣prive churches of their pastors who were already in office: one notable instance whereof, I will mention. In the be∣ginning of our glorious revival of religion in the land, <HI>New-Haven</HI> consociation made some laws against ministers preaching in others parishes, if they were desired to the contrary: <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Laws of the same nature were soon after carried into the gene∣ral court and passed there.</NOTE> soon after which, Mr. <HI>Philem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Robbins</HI> of <HI>Branford,</HI> (who was a great friend to that work of God) received a letter from the pastor of a <HI>Baptist</HI> church in <HI>Wallingford,</HI> which informed him that tho' they were of different sentiments about the <HI>form</HI> of religion, yet as they agreed in the <HI>essentials,</HI> they desired him to come and preach among them. This he thought to be a reasonable request, and therefore appointed a meeting among them in the beginning of the year 1742. But before the appoint∣ed time came, he received two letters, one from some of the inhabitants of that town, the other from some neighbouring ministers, which informed him that they did not think it would be for the best for him to preach among that people, and desired he would not; but gave no reason at all. Yet because he would not put by a meeting which he had appointed merely at their request, without any rea∣son given, he was first excluded from the <HI>consociation,</HI> and then complaints were received there against him, from a few of his disaffected people; upon which he made an attempt to get reconciled again to the ministers, but found it could not be done upon any lower terms, than confessing that he did wrong in preaching to that <HI>baptist</HI> society as he did. <HI>That</HI> he could not in conscience do; so they part∣ed, which opened a wider door for complaints than before, and so many were carried in, that a consociation was ap∣pointed in his own town to try the case, and a citation was sent to him to come and answer to many articles.</P>
<P>Hereupon Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> called his church together, and laid these articles before them, with answers thereto; and the church manifested satisfaction therewith: and as they found that the church was originally settled according to <HI>Cambridge platform,</HI> and had never voted an alteration; they now voted to abide by their old constitution, and ap∣pointed Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> and others to go and inform the con∣sociation that they denied their jurisdiction, and would not be tried by them. This was accordingly done; yet this
<PB N="31" REF="010823_0016_0F81D4753A87D360"/>
<HI>spiritual court</HI> declared that they had jurisdiction of the case, and went on to hear and try charges against him, without any to answer for him; and drew up and pub∣lished their judgment that
<Q>Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> was criminally guilty of the breach of the <HI>third</HI> the <HI>fifth</HI> and <HI>ninth</HI> commands, and <HI>many gospel rule,</HI></Q>
and so warned all to beware of him, 'till he made satisfaction therefor. Mr. <HI>Robbins,</HI> having copies of these proceedings, published them to the world, in 1747. Afterward four of the in∣habitants of <HI>Branford</HI> (if I remember right their number) went to the general court with a complaint that the town still held this condemned man for their minister, and prayed the court to turn him out of his place. This caused a great turn in the rulers minds; and I know not who will now appear to justify their conduct; and yet I fear there are but few who are convinced that the root of all this mischief lies in mans trying to modle church affairs accord∣ing to worldly rule. In civil states particular men are in∣vested with authority to judge for the whole; but in Christ's kingdom each one has an equal right to judge for himself. Indeed there is a likeness in this respect that all politic bodies have their limits and their power extends only to those within their bounds; but then the limits of civil jurisdiction is fixed by earthly power, and that of the church is only by voluntary consent; for Christ will have no pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d soldiers in his army.</P>
<P>Paul said to the church of Corinth, <HI>What have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without, God judgeth. Therefore put away from among your selves that wicked per∣son.</HI> And after they had proceeded according to this di∣rection, he calls it, a <HI>punishment which was inflicted of many,</HI> 1 Cor. 5.12, 13. 2 Cor. 2.6. Now Christ's church is either <HI>particular,</HI> or <HI>universal.</HI> All the churches that are described in the bible, as having the power of discipline are <HI>particular,</HI> in which each member has his right to judge; as in this at <HI>Corinth,</HI> another at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> &amp;c. The affair recorded in Acts 15, is only of one particular church which sent to another for advice in a controversy concern∣ing principles; and the <HI>apostles and elders,</HI> with the <HI>whole church</HI> returned an answer accordingly. But now when men assume a power above particular churches; as they have neither divine rule to support their conduct, nor earthly

<P>I have been thus particular, not to injure any man's person, but only to open the nature of that constitution in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der to shew the true cause of our separation therefrom.

<HEAD>PART II. The cause and manner of our separation, with the particular points of difference between us and the standing ministers.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Fully agree with Mr. <HI>Fish,</HI> that about 26 years ago.
<Q>There was the most wonderful work of God, that ever was known in this part of the world, both for the extent and visible appearance of it.</Q>
p. 114. I am also of his mind, that
<Q>there was a marvellous mixture of almost eve∣ry thing <HI>good</HI> and <HI>bad,</HI> — for while the spirit of God wrought <HI>powerfully,</HI> satan raged <HI>maliciously,</HI> and acted his old subtle part to <HI>deceive.</HI></Q>
p. 115. And several of his observations concerning Mr. <HI>James Davenport</HI> I believe are just, but others I think are not so.</P>
<P>He must be a great stranger to the bible, who does not know that in times of great declension, teachers are gene∣rally as much, if not the most corrupt of any; therefore in a reformation, those corruptions are always more or less exposed, and warned against. And when Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> had his eyes opened to see the dreadful case of ministers as well as people, he having been trained up among ministers who claimed most of the power to themselves, was more easily led to the extream, of openly declaring of his judg∣ment concerning several ministers, and so of calling peo∣ple
<PB N="33" REF="010823_0017_0F81D475EA7EA1B0"/>
to separate from them, because <HI>he judged</HI> them to be unconverted. And a number of separations were produ∣ced by that means; but those separations were not from the general constitution of the churches; they were only from particular ministers. Whereas our separations begun several years afterwards, and upon quite different princi∣ples; yet Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> would lay them all at his door, while he speaks highly of Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennant,</HI> who travelled and preached in the most noted places in <HI>New-England,</HI> in the beginning of that work.</P>
<P>But did Mr. <HI>F.</HI> never see the sermon on the <HI>danger of an unconverted ministry,</HI> which that "son of thunder," as he calls him, published soon after, from Mar. 6.34? wherein, after drawing the character of Pharisee-teachers, and shewing how people should be pitied, who have such teachers, he says,
<Q>If it be so,—then what a scrole and scene of mourning and lamentation, and wo is opened I because of the swarms of locusts, the crowds of Pha∣risees, that have as <HI>covetously</HI> as <HI>cruelly,</HI> crept into the ministry, in this adulterous generation▪ who as nearly resemble the character given of the old Pharisees, in the doctrinal part of this discourse, as one crow's egg does another. It is true some of the modern Pharisees have learned to prate a little more <HI>orthodoxly</HI> about the new birth, than their predecessor, <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> who are, in the mean time, as great strangers to the feeling experience of it, as he. They are blind who see not this to be the case of the <HI>body</HI> of the clergy, of this generation — Alas his not it the case of multitudes? If they can get one, that has the name of a minister, with a band, and a black coat or gown, to carry on a sabbath-days a∣mong them, altho' never so coldly and <HI>insuccessfully</HI>; if he is free from gross crimes in practice, and takes good care to keep at a distance from their consciences, and is never troubled about his insuccessfulness; O! think the poor fools, that is a fine man indeed.</Q>
p. 11.12. It must be confest that his language is sharp and cutting, like <HI>Luther's</HI> formerly; yet many of his reasonings are weighty; of which at present I will only give two extracts more; one is in his answer to that complaint, that his principles will cause contentions among people; to which he says,
<Q>The proper cause of sinful divisions, is that enmity against God, and holiness, which is in the hearts of natural men, of every order; being stirred up by the devil, and their own proud and selfish lusts. And very
<PB N="34" REF="010823_0018_0F81D476EF1E5120"/>
often natural men which are the proper causes of the divisions aforesaid, are wont to deal with God's ser∣vants, as <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>har's</HI> wife did by <HI>Joseph</HI>: they lay all the blame of their own wickedness at their doors, and make a loud cry!</Q>
p. 16. The other extract is in answer to a saying which we have often heard, viz. That 'tis a mere fiction to tell of getting good when we go over the parish line, because as they say, <HI>we are out of God's way.</HI></P>
<P>To this Mr. <HI>Tennant</HI> answers,
<Q>That there are three monstrous ingredients in the objection, namely a begging of the question in debate, rash judging, and limiting of God.</Q>
p. 18 They beg the question who suppose we go out of God's way, because we go over man's line: and how rash is it to judge that others get no good, only because they don't go in their way? And such are much more in∣excusable than the <HI>Jews</HI> were, if they think to limit divine blessings to any particular <HI>house</HI> or spot of ground. Now Mr. <HI>F.</HI> ought to know that we read and considered these things in those times, as well as what Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> said: yea, and so we did the writings of a divine of greater note than either of these, who in those times said,
<Q>We that are ministers, by looking on this work, from year to year, with a displeased countenance shall effectually keep the sheep from their pasture, instead of doing the part of shepherds to them, by feeding them; and our people had a <HI>great deal better</HI> be without any settled minister at all, at such a day as this.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Edward's</HI> thoughts on the work, 1742. p. 134.</NOTE> And in the next page he ob∣serves that
<Q>The times of Christ's remarkably appearing, in behalf of his church, and to revive religion, and ad∣vance his kingdom in the world, are often spoken in the prophecies of scripture, as times wherein he will remark∣ably execute judgments on such ministers or shepherds, as don't feed the flock, but hinder their being fed, and so <HI>deliver his flock from them,</HI> as Jer. 23<SUP>d</SUP>. throughout, and Ezek. 34. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>These things we knew had much of reality in them, and Mr. <HI>F.</HI> or his bretheren might as well undertake to prove, that <HI>deep waters</HI> are good to drink, when they are <HI>soul'd</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith <HI>mud</HI> and <HI>dung</HI>; or that it is good feeding in pastures which are <HI>all trodden down,</HI> as to prove that a great part of the preaching which we had in those days was <HI>clear gospel,</HI> or <HI>good food</HI> for souls.

and beat for it, that will <HI>scatter them abroad</HI> the more. And I speak as I expect to answer it before HIM who has said, he will <HI>judge between the fat and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cattle,</HI> I know this to be a real cause of our separations: and the evidence of its being so, will more and more open as we go on.</P>
<P>The same views of a <HI>holy God,</HI> which gave many to see their woful polluted and undone condition, led them also to see that they dwelt in the <HI>midst of a people of unclean lips.</HI> Isa. 6.5. And when any had a manifestation of Christ to their souls; like the woman of Samaria, they wanted to invite all to come and partake of the same blessings: but this gave offence to many, who would say,
<Q>You must not judge.</Q>
But that was so far from preventing, that it naturally produced a judgment in young converts, that those who were offended at such free invitations, were strangers to vital religion: and doubtless many exceeded due bounds in that way; yet to be more severely dealt with therefor, than others were for the vilest crimes, (as many were) this had no tendency to convince them that they were wrong, or their reprovers right.</P>
<P>Farther, such as had an appetite given them for the pure gospel, could not help seeking often to hear the <HI>sincere milk of the word</HI>; and consequently to hear it from the clearest preachers, if they went a few miles further for it. They also <HI>frequently assembled themselves together,</HI> and <HI>exhor∣ted one another,</HI> with mutual advantage; 'till at length some were ready to say concerning some exhorters, much at the wo∣men sang concerning a youth in <HI>Israel,</HI> 1 Sam. 18.7. To this Mr. <HI>F.</HI> bears me witness, p. 138. But great offence was ta∣ken at such things, and at length the ministers in general came into an agreement to try to stop them; and now a great part of the preaching that was to be heard at home or abroad, was concerning <HI>imprudencies</HI> and <HI>disorders,</HI> and especially against, what they called, <HI>lay-exhorting.</HI> Our author owns that these things were <HI>frequently,</HI> and perhaps <HI>too often</HI> handled, p. 142. Yet because people would not patiently hear such preaching he says,
<Q>Sound doctrine was what they could not endure.</Q>
Tho' I am glad he is so honest as to add, that he means
<Q>only such branches of doctrine, as took away (what he calls) <HI>false notions</HI> in religion;—for, says he, as to many other found doctrines, they relished them well.</Q>

<HEAD>I. Of judging others.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS has been much complained of in our day, and Mr. <HI>F.</HI> delivers high charges against us in that respect: but a calm view of his and others conduct on that head, might cause the same remark about <HI>judging,</HI> that bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> made con∣cerning <HI>persecution,</HI> viz. that it look'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s if
<Q>the only quarrel they had against it was, because they had not the managing of it themselves.</Q>
Our author tells a long story of how he and his brethren preached much better than the separates, but I suppose he had forgot that <HI>Paul</HI> durst not make himself of the number of such as <HI>commend∣ed themselves</HI>; and <HI>measured themselves by themselves.</HI></P>
<P>So Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> who wrote a great volume against the work 25 years ago, set down <HI>rash</HI> and <HI>uncharitable judging</HI> as one of the greatest evils of that day. And tho' he talks much of the scriptures, yet his evident standard is, <HI>themselves</HI>▪ for he says,
<Q>I freely confess, had the mini∣sters of <HI>New-England</HI> lost their character as men of re∣ligion, by any deportment of themselves, contradictory to the gospel, I should have found no fault with any repre∣sentation of them as <HI>bad men</HI>; nay, <HI>dangerous enemies</HI> to the kingdom of Christ: for I am clearly of the mind, that a <HI>visibly wicked minister</HI> is the greatest <HI>scandal</HI> to <HI>religion,</HI> and <HI>plague</HI> to the <HI>church</HI> of God: nor is it a hurt, but a real service to the <HI>cause</HI> of Christ, to expose the characters of such, and lessen their power to do mis∣chief.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s Thoughts on the state of religion in <HI>New-England.</HI> 1743, p. 141.</NOTE> Thus he allows that if there had happened to have been a number of visibly bad ministers among us, it
<PB N="37" REF="010823_0019_0F81D477687E0EF0"/>
would have been a <HI>real service,</HI> and not <HI>hurt to expose</HI> them. But <HI>he</HI> has judged it to be otherwise; therefore for others to judge the contrary, is a sure evidence of their being <HI>rash</HI> and <HI>uncharitable</HI> men!</P>
<P>The first whom he names, as guilty of this daring crime, is Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>; and he begins his evidence against him, with telling us that he
<Q>seldom preached, but he had something or other, in his sermon, against <HI>unconverted ministers</HI>:</Q>
and that afterward in his <HI>journal</HI> he ex∣pressed "his <HI>fear</HI> lest
<Q>many, nay, the most that preach, do not <HI>experimentally know Christ.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 140, 141.</NOTE> And to prove this to be an <HI>abuse</HI> of the <HI>standing ministers</HI> now, he says,
<Q>Hear the opinion of that eminent man of God Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> upon this head:</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">page 142.</NOTE> who said,
<Q>There is not that spot of ground upon the face of God's earth, which can proportionably match <HI>New-England</HI> for mi∣nisters.</Q>
But when was it so? why I find by his <HI>life,</HI> that this opinion was published in 1691, when (as the fol∣lowing words express)
<Q>No man became a minister in these churches, 'till he first became a <HI>communicant</HI>; and no man became a communicant, until he had been <HI>se∣verely examined</HI> about his <HI>regeneration,</HI> as well as his <HI>conversation.</HI> If any minister do misbehave himself, he soon hears of it, and becomes either a <HI>penitent,</HI> or a <HI>de∣posed man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This was Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s testimony of the order of the churches in that day; but "what a <HI>degeneracy</HI> has come on since then! This same man of God said 24 years afterward.
<Q>There may be <HI>much chaff</HI> in the church.—Now, 'tis pro∣phesied Mat. 3.12. He whose <HI>fan is in his hand, will throughly purge his floor.</HI> But verily, it must be with more than a little <HI>shaking</HI> that the <HI>sanning</HI> work will be carried on.</Q>
Again he says,
<Q>There shall be men, qualified like, and influenced by, the angels of God; these <HI>Boanerges</HI>'s, and <HI>sons of commotion,</HI> shall fly thro' the midst of heaven, having this everlasting gospel to preach unto the inhabitants of the earth.

That is, when their eyes were opened to see that they were men of <HI>unclean lips,</HI> they saw also that they <HI>dwelt in the midst of a people of unclean lips</HI>: and this caused "more than a little <HI>shaking</HI> in the churches." And as 'tis evident that Dr. C's notion of <HI>charity</HI> was, to have a <HI>good opinion</HI> of the <HI>ministers</HI> and <HI>churches,</HI> as they stood; so because the instruments and subjects of that work, had not such an opinion of them; therefore he <HI>judges</HI> of them as <HI>enthusiasts, quakers,</HI> and what not? See <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. Ma∣ny ministers will not approve of this conduct in Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> who yet treat us ashe did them. Let us come to plain facts.</P>
<P>The first of our separate churches was at <HI>Canterbury</HI>; and the <HI>separation</HI> began in this manner. The <HI>parish</HI> cal∣led a man to preach to them, who had been <HI>licenced</HI> for that purpose, by the <HI>association</HI> in that county. But after the church in <HI>Canterbury</HI> had made trial of him, they <HI>judged</HI> him to be
<Q>destitute of those <HI>essential qualifications</HI> that ought to be in a minister of Jesus Christ; and there∣fore refused to join with the society in their choice.</Q>
And, as the society persisted in their choice, and were justified therein by the <HI>ministers,</HI> the <HI>church</HI> at length withdrew, and met at a private house. After which the consociation was called; and under their direction, a number of the members openly renounced the former principles of the <HI>church,</HI> and put themselves under <HI>Saybrook</HI> regulation, and chose Mr. <HI>Cogswell,</HI> whom the society had called before, and got him ordained as their minister. And they afterward,
<Q>sent some of the members of the <HI>church</HI> to prison, for not attending on his ministry; yea, and threatned to prosecute Mr. <HI>Buell</HI> for staying in the town to preach the gospel, upon the desire of many members of the <HI>church,</HI> without the vote of the society.</Q>

first separate church. It is the first church in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who retain their ancient <HI>principles,</HI> their <HI>records,</HI> and other furniture of the <HI>church</HI>: and are called <HI>separate,</HI> only be∣cause they refused to give up their <HI>judgments</HI> to the <HI>clergy</HI> and the world, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I say the <HI>world</HI>; for the <HI>law</HI> requires no other qualification to make a <HI>voter</HI> in their parishes, but a certain quantity of <HI>worldly</HI> estate.</NOTE> in so important an affair, as the choice of a <HI>guide for their souls.</HI> Indeed that <HI>association</HI> in their <HI>letter</HI> against the separates, p. 41, 42. say,
<Q>If there be any of us, whose ministry is not edifying, or who dispense not the word as we ought,—you ought to use the means which Christ has appointed for our conviction and amend∣ment, or rejection.</Q>
And they declare the churches have <HI>liberty</HI>
<Q>to choose their own way of church discipline, whe∣ther <HI>Saybrook</HI> platform, presbyterian or congregational.</Q>
And yet in the next breath they accuse the separates with
<Q>rejecting the ministry and churches of Christ, and set∣ting up without any divine institution.</Q>
Whereas, the very act of this church, which they are condemned for, was adhering to the <HI>congregational</HI> plan, and taking the only gospel way they had left to clear themselves of a minister, whose preaching was not <HI>edifying</HI> to them.</P>
<P>I say the only <HI>gospel</HI> method they had left; for the church had called a <HI>congregational council</HI> before, and after he was ordained
<Q>against the vote and solemn warnings and intreaties of the church;—all the settled ministers of the county left the church</Q>:
—and Mr. <HI>Pain</HI>
<Q>went to the general assembly in behalf of the church, with a petition, shewing them that the church was usurped o∣ver, and oppressed, and prayed them to interpose, and forbid the society</Q>,
oppressing the church to support that minister: but the court granted them no relief. No, but for many years afterward, their goods were spoiled, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> persons haled to prison for that minister's support; and after their own pastor was ordained, he was prosecuted, and fined for marrying a couple, because they would not allow him to be truly ordained.</P>

apostles, and were not: and had <HI>found them liars,</HI> Rev. 2.2. And the true apostles, while they gave to the first gospel chruch, a description of what sort of men should be chosen into office in their presence, they did not pretend to <HI>nomi∣nate</HI> any; but said, <HI>Brethren, look ye out among you,</HI> such men. Act. 6.3. And <HI>Paul</HI> expressly shews, that <HI>letters of commendation</HI> in his time were TO and FROM THE CHURCH, 2 Cor. 3.1.</P>
<P>But these ministers now, arrogate the power to <HI>try,</HI> and <HI>approbate</HI> ministers, wholly to themselves; and assisted in <HI>causing a division</HI> in the church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> because they would not submit to that power, <HI>contrary to the doctrine which they had learned,</HI> in the gospel. Here therefore, the text which they often cast upon us, is strictly applicable to them.
<Q>Mark them which <HI>cause divisions</HI> and offences, <HI>contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned</HI>; and AVOID <HI>them</HI>: for they that are such, <HI>serve not</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ, but <HI>their</HI> own <HI>belly</HI>; and by <HI>good words</HI> and <HI>fair speeches</HI> DECEIVE the hearts of the simple.</Q>

Yet what now is the import of their noise against separates, but this, <HI>They follow not us</HI>?

<Q>While we give the separates credit for this verbal concession, that <HI>learn∣ing</HI> is a good thing, and that they don't de∣spise <HI>learning,</HI> we must <HI>charge</HI> them with saying, in the next breath and confirming of it by <HI>practice,</HI> that there is no need of any more than <HI>common learning</HI> (nor indeed any <HI>necessity</HI> for <HI>that,</HI> if they have but the <HI>Spirit</HI>) to qualify men for the work of the ministry.

<P>This you see is laid against us all without exception, and he often repeats it in that manner, and our <HI>practice</HI> is ap∣pealed to for the proof of the charge: then let that be examined.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="010823_0022_0F81D47B66D70228"/>Mr. <HI>Elisha Pain</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> was one of the greatest <HI>lawyers</HI> in that colony, before he left the <HI>law</HI> for the <HI>gos∣pel</HI>; and some of the ministers approved of his preaching, 'till they found he would not conform to their schemes: he is an ordain'd pastor among the separates to this day. His brother <HI>Solomon,</HI> who was the first pastor of that church at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> had been a leading man in the town, and had been their <HI>representative</HI> in the general court. Mr. <HI>Josiah Cleaveland,</HI> of that church sent two of his sons <HI>to college,</HI> and you shall hear how they were treated.</P>
<P>"<HI>Yale</HI> college Nov. 19. 1744.</P>
<P><Q>Present, the Rector and Tutors upon information, that <HI>John Cleaveland,</HI> and <HI>Ebenezer Cleaveland,</HI> members of this college, withdrew from the public worship of God in the meeting house in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> carried on by Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gsha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cenced, and approved candidate for the ministry, preaching there at the desire of the first parish or society in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> with the special direction of the <HI>association</HI> of the county of <HI>Windham;</HI> and that they the said <HI>Cleavelands,</HI> did go to and attend upon a private saparate meeeting in a private house for divine worship, car∣ried on principally by one <HI>Solomon Paine,</HI> a lay-exhorter, on several sabbaths in September or October last.</Q>
The Scho∣lars owned the facts, and gave in the state of the case to them, and shew'd that they met with the major part of the church, which they belonged to. I shall not trouble the reader with any more than the close of their first answer which was,
<Q>That neither the major part of the members in full communi∣on, nor any other persons in any parish or society, have any right or warrant to appoint any house or place for
<PB N="43" REF="010823_0022_0F81D47B66D70228"/>
worship on the sabbath, distinct and separate from, and in opposition to the meeting-house, the public place ap∣pointed by the general assembly, and the parish; but on the contrary, all such places and separate meetings, are prohibited by the antient laws of this government.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Whereupon it is considered, and adjudged by the rector and tutors, that the said <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Ebenezer Cleavelands,</HI> in withdrawing and separating from the public worship of God, and attending upon the preach∣ing of lay-exhorters as aforesaid, have acted contrary to the rules of the gospel, the laws of this colony, and of the college; and that the said <HI>Cleavelands,</HI> shall be publickly admonished for their faults aforesaid; and if they continue to justify themselves, and refuse to make an acknowledgment, they shall be expelled.</Q></P>
<BIBL>"Thomas Clap. Rector."</BIBL>
<P>They were expelled accordingly, and became teachers among the separates. And as the heads of the college then published this account; and Mr. <HI>Paine</HI> in his <HI>view of the churches,</HI> transcribed it, p. 13— 15, in 1752. And as we have some other ordained pastors, who have considerable skill in both the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> tongues; and three mem∣bers of one separate church in <HI>Norwich,</HI> have each brought up a son at college within these few years, one of which is now a tutor of <HI>Yale</HI> college; and as a like number have been sent to college from <HI>Windham,</HI> beside some in other places; I leave Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> to consider how he can answer what he has said, either to God or man.</P>
<P>However, tho' his <HI>charge</HI> is far from truth, yet 'tis readi∣ly granted, that we have a great dislike to some sorts of learn∣ing, especially the art of disputing against the truth, as well as for it, the art of making easy things hard, instead of making hard things easy; such <HI>oppositions of science,</HI> we <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 6.20</NOTE> have no likening to, nor of the art of handling the <HI>word of God deceitfully,</HI> and twisting things into any shape to suit men's own turns. Such things as these, I take to be the <HI>leaven</HI> which our Savior warned his disciples against; for what he calls <HI>doctrine</HI> in one place, he calls <HI>hypocrisy</HI> in another. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. 16.12. Luk. 12.1.</NOTE> And what shall we think of our author upon this point? Speaking of ministers work, he says,
<Q>Our Lord hath shewn us, that LEARNING is eminently useful, yea even necessa∣ry, Isai. 50.4. <HI>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of</HI> the learned, that I <HI>should know how to speak a word

in season, to him that is weary.</HI> Intimating that he should not have <HI>known how,</HI> without a learned tongue.</Q>
p. 175.</P>
<P>When I read this, I confess it caused this enquiry in my mind, If Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> knows no better, than to construe this scripture so, where is his <HI>learning?</HI> and if he does, where is his <HI>honesty?</HI> His controversy with us is about <HI>human</HI> learn∣ing, whereas that text expresseth <HI>divine</HI> learning, as plain as words can possibly do; and there is great reason to think, that the prophet here personates HIM, who tho' <HI>he were a son, yet learned he obedience, by the things which he suffered, and being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempt∣ed.</HI> Did any Pharisee ever abuse scripture, to impose upon people, worse than this?</P>
<P>Let us consider another scripture, namely, 2 Tim. 3.6. which our author gives us a large comment upon, in order to guard against those that oppose their churches, and clo∣seth it by saying,
<Q>This design is hid from vulgar eyes, by the plausible covering or pretence, of setting truth in a <HI>clearer light,</HI> and building up the church on a <HI>better footing,</HI> and of <HI>purer materials,</HI></Q>
p. 70. Now we may take notice, that the apostle makes no distinction in the text, between <HI>public</HI> and <HI>private</HI> houses, for he often taught both <HI>publickly</HI> and from <HI>house to house</HI>; but what he points out false teachers by, is, the manner of their getting in, and the work they do when they are in. As to the first, they <HI>creep into houses</HI>: and we all know that <HI>creeping</HI> is oppo∣site to going <HI>upright,</HI> therefore when Peter <HI>dissembled,</HI> Paul withstood <HI>him to the face,</HI> because he <HI>walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel</HI>; and that concerning introducing the <HI>Jewish</HI> schemes into the <HI>christian</HI> church, Gal. 2.11 — 14. I leave Mr. <HI>F.</HI> to consider how well this will agree with his notion, that the
<Q>christian church is made up of the <HI>same materials,</HI> that the Jewish church was.</Q></P>
<P>I remember that Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> in his <HI>farewell sermon</HI> at <HI>Northampton,</HI> warned that people of their danger of being imposed upon, for he said, he knew the <HI>art</HI> that some young ministers had got, of <HI>disguising</HI> their principles, 'till they could get into place, and then they would corrupt people's minds by degrees. This leads to the other branch of the text under consideration, which is, that when those teachers are got into houses, they <HI>lead captive silly women laden with sin, led away with divers lusts.</HI> And how many have there been in our day, who have appeared in a <HI>Cal∣vinist</HI> garb till they have got settled, and then as fast as
<PB N="45" REF="010823_0023_0F81D47C5E534E40"/>
any <HI>women</HI> or others came <HI>laden with sin,</HI> to talk with them about their souls concern, they would <HI>lead</HI> them to the <HI>church,</HI> instead of leading them to <HI>Christ first,</HI> and so they are settled down in a <HI>form of Godliness</HI>; and <HI>this sort</HI> of men, will soon <HI>deny the power</HI> of it. verse. 5. And they are ever <HI>learning,</HI> and never able to come to the <HI>knowledge of the truth,</HI> v. 7. Instead of that, they are <HI>truce-breakers</HI>; false to the principles which they professed, and break thro' their solemnities and engagements; and so are <HI>Traitors,</HI> v. 4. And if we had no such men in our land, can it be thought, that we should have heard <HI>Judas</HI> cried up so much as we have? I mean not to reflect upon any man's person, but only to hold up the plain truth, and leave all men to judge for themselves; and where any such men are found, God's command in ver. 5. is, <HI>From such turn away.</HI> Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pretends, that those teachers were for building the church, "of purer materials" than others; whereas the text speaks expressly of <HI>that sort</HI> of men, who have the form, but deny the <HI>power of godliness.</HI></P>

<P>I shall only just desire the reader to observe, that there appears nothing wanting here, to make him a good preacher, but only the ministers licence, for he <HI>preach'd</HI> and <HI>exhored,</HI> both in a <HI>doctrinal</HI> and <HI>practical</HI> way; and who could think that such treatment from the other parties, could convince us that we were wrong, and they right?

<P>And on Oct. 9. 1745.

They complained afterward, of meeting with <HI>noisy treatment,</HI> and who could expect less?</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="010823_0025_0F81D47D6C9E7C40"/>The writer of this, happened to be a spectator of the transactions of that day, and tho' but young in years, and experience, yet he endeavoured carefully to observe what was done. Some of those ministers had been as great <HI>promoters,</HI> and others as great <HI>opposers</HI> of the late revival of religion, as any in the land: and the promoters of the work were put forward, and as they came up, they were saluted something in this manner, viz. one would say,
<Q>Dear Mr. <HI>P.</HI> you was the instrument of my conversion, and where are you now?</Q>
Another,
<Q>Dear Mr. <HI>M.</HI> you was the means of awakenings my soul, and will you now fight against the work of God,</Q>
and others to like purpose. And afterward they were publickly addressed by one of the fathers in the separation, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Solomon Paine.</NOTE> as hear as I can remember, in these words,
<Q>You dear ministers of Jesus Christ, who were as <HI>heralds</HI> a few years ago, to found the gospel trumpet thro' the land, where are you now? are you not joined in <HI>confederacy</HI> with those who, your own consciences testify, are enemies to the work of God?</Q></P>
<P>They shewed no disposition to answer such questions, but made several attempts to get the church together by themselves, 'till they found it could not be done, and at last they read off a remonstrance, which they had drawn up against these things, and so departed. That church in <HI>Mansfield,</HI> the next month, chose and ordained Mr. <HI>John Hovey</HI> for their pastor, which was the first ordina∣tion among these churches; and after Mr. <HI>Marsh</HI> was set at liberty, he was ordained a colleague with him, in July following.

<P>I would always abide by what we begun upon, under this head, that the spirit of Christ is not a <HI>fierce, bitter,</HI> and <HI>revengeful</HI> spirit, but the reverse; and that wherever such a spirit appears, 'tis a <HI>blemish</HI> to any people; and that treatment which he describes was so to us; but then he, and all ought to consider, that <HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>surely oppression maketh a wise man mad</HI>; and if what we had met with was not <HI>oppression,</HI> I confess I know not what may be called so; and the <HI>bitter</HI> words which he sets down, were utter∣ed

by a poor <HI>Irishman,</HI> who could not read, and was never set up as a teacher among our churches, but put himself forward at that time; and if others did not, then rebuke him for it, what has been said above, may in some mea∣sure account for that.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> owns, that there is a great alteration among us since, and says,
<Q>Tis readily granted that they are, now much more moderate and civil, than they were in that day, — are very peaceable, kind, obliging good neigh∣bours.</Q>
But, says he,
<Q>what does this reasoning argue? why, it only shews that they have lost a degree of their original <HI>spirit</HI> as <HI>separates.</HI></Q>
p. 158. But stay; our author has forgot himself: As little learning as we have, we used to think, that we understood so much of <HI>logic</HI> as this, that if the <HI>cause</HI> was gone, the <HI>effect</HI> would cease: therefore if so great a degree of the <HI>spirit</HI> of separation is lost, he need not have troubled himself, nor others about it. But he has drawn out things, to such a length, that he will have hard, work to bring his two ends together<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for he begins with informing the world, that the occasion of his writing, ws the <HI>revival</HI> of the <HI>spirit</HI> of separation, yet before he has got thro' his book, he contradicts it, lest he should allow that we were governed by a good spi∣rit in separating.</P>
<P>He calls this labour of his, An "unpleasant task"; and well he might, for 'tis hard work to strive to blind the truth. In order to finish this task, he says;
<Q>The rash∣ness and soverity of that spirit, which these poor bre∣thren were influenced by, appeared in such accusations, as respected the hidden man of the heart,</Q>

because we would not confound church and world toge∣ther, as they did, they shifted about, and accused us with assuming God's prerogative to search the heart; while they asserted, that we could not know who were saints, and who not.

<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> knows that our chief disputes, have been upon <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sibilities</HI> and not secrets. The first thing which he advances, to prove that separates had a bad spirit, is that,
<Q>They en∣deavoured to draw off from us, every true believer, or christian, (in their sense of the word) and would have left a congregation behind them, of nothing but such as they judged to be hypocrites and graceless persons: without the benefit of one saint to assist them, in the affairs of their souls.</Q></P>
<P>And he directly turns to the parable of the <HI>tares,</HI> as a <HI>sure</HI> proof that this was wrong; and adds, as a great agra∣vation of their crime, that they would call others to,
<Q><HI>Come out from among them, and be separate</HI>; with this re∣flection,</Q>
<Q>If they are christians, why don't they come away from the Shades of <HI>Babylon</HI>!</Q>
p. 154. I sup∣pose the use of the word <HI>Babylon</HI> here, was thought as cri∣minal as any of their language; but as its signification is, <HI>confusion or mixture,</HI> is there not at least the <HI>shades</HI> of it, where civil and ecclesiastical affairs; <HI>church</HI> and <HI>world</HI> are

<HI>confounded</HI> together, as we have proved they are in our land? and the text refer'd to, is a call to <HI>come out from,</HI> and not be <HI>unequally yoked with unbelievers,</HI> 2 Cor. 6.14—17. Creatures that are <HI>unequally yoked</HI> together, are not like to work to any advantage.</P>
<P>Old Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI>'s thoughts are worthy of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His life, dedication p. 17, 18.</NOTE> notice here, which were thus expressed;
<Q>The over-enlarging of full communion of, or admission of persons there, upon slight qualifications, without <HI>insisting</HI> upon the <HI>practical</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> part of religion, will not only lose the <HI>power of godliness,</HI> but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e time, bring in profaneness, and <HI>ruin the churches</HI> these two ways. 1. Election of ministers, will soon be carried by a formal, looser so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. 2. The exercise of discipline, will by this means be rende∣red <HI>impossible,</HI> discipline falling, profaneness riseth like a flood; for the major part wanting zeal against sin, will foster licentiousness. It is not setting down good rules, and directions, that will salve it; for the specification of government, is from men, not from laws. Let ne∣ver so good a form of government be agreed upon, it will soon degenerate, if the instruments, (or men) that manage it, be not good.</Q>
<HI>Solomon</HI> tells us that <HI>words fitly spoken,</HI> are like <HI>apples of gold, in pictures of silver</HI>▪ and I think these words of Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> are such; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> often refers us to this godly man; I would de∣sire him to turn and look into this glass himself. If this great man thought, that it would <HI>ruin the churches,</HI> to have many loose members to vote for ministers <HI>in the church</HI>; what would he have said, if he had seen the <HI>clergy</HI> set up the <HI>world over the church</HI> in that affair? as we have seen them do, which caused the first separation. I say set up the world <HI>over</HI> the church; for the law requires no other qualification to make a man a voter for a minister in their parishes, but a certain quantity of <HI>worldly</HI> estate: and <HI>such</HI> voters turned the church in <HI>Canterbury</HI> out of the mee∣ting-house; and then two members of it, because they would go with the church, <HI>without the camp</HI> of such men, they were turned out of one of the <HI>fountains,</HI> which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> would confine us all to for ministers. This is not a judging men's <HI>secrets,</HI> for they are open facts in the sight of the sun. But what a spirit does our author discover, in his reproaching and condemning us, as apostates from the sentiments of our antient fathers? He spends several pages to try to prove, that the antient church at <HI>Plymouth</HI> was
<PB N="52" REF="010823_0027_0F81D483D2A73520"/>
like the standing church now, and not like the separates, from an account of that church, which is given in the appen∣dix to Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI>'s ordination sermon; and after picking out a few passages, which are chiefly the opinion of the writer of the account, now in the year 1760, he then re∣fers it to the reader to judge how little <HI>resemblance</HI> there is between them and us, p. 84. But in that same ac∣count, p. 32. we are informed, that the
<Q>church mana∣ged the whole affair, both of inviting and calling</Q>
mini∣sters, and that the first instance that appears of the <HI>towns voting</HI> in the case, was <HI>seventy nine years</HI> after their first coming to <HI>Plymouth.</HI> In the same account p. 21. we have an information of <HI>three</HI> members of that church, who were ordained to the pastoral care of other churches <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viz. Mr. <HI>Jonathan Dunham</HI> at <HI>Marthas Vineyard</HI>; Mr. <HI>Samu∣el Fuller,</HI> the first minister in <HI>Middleborough</HI>; and Mr. <HI>Isaac Cushman</HI> the first in <HI>Plymton.</HI> Mr. <HI>Cushman</HI> lived to old age, and I have heard many that have sat under his ministry speak of him as a faithful and successful labourer.</NOTE> that were, what Mr. <HI>F.</HI> calls <HI>lay-teachers</HI>; yet this was done fifty-six years after <HI>Harvard</HI> college was founded.</P>
<P>We don't pretend to take those fathers as our perfect pattern; but what I complain of is, Mr. <HI>Fish</HI>'s pretending to produce their example to support his cause, and to con∣demn us, and then call others to judge upon the case; while he conceals these material points, which are for us, and against him. I will also add here, that Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> gives it as the foundation principles of those fathers which came to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> that their church <HI>officers</HI> after
<Q>being chosen and ordained, have no <HI>lordly, arbitrary</HI> or <HI>impos∣ing</HI> power; but can only rule and minister <HI>with the con∣sent of the brethren</HI>; who ought not in contempt to be called the <HI>la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty</HI> but to be treated as <HI>men</HI> and <HI>brethren</HI> in Christ, not as slaves or minors.

men; for <HI>interest</HI> is concerned, and they are afraid, <HI>writ∣ten</HI> evidences would impose upon them: Yet in this case, where the <HI>interest</HI> of Christ's church is so much concerned, that as Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> observes <HI>loose admissions</HI> will <HI>ruin the churches</HI>; here none are allowed to <HI>witness a good confessi∣on with their own mouths</HI> before the church, but the mini∣sters have turned them off with <HI>written</HI> accounts, which have often been framed by some body else, for those who are about to make an open appearance as God's <HI>wit∣nesses.</HI> Nay there are some godly persons among us, who declare that when they were admitted publickly into the church, the minister read off an account, different in mate∣rial points, from what they gave to him in writing, and so made them silently assent to a <HI>lie</HI>!</P>
<P>From written experiences, great numbers, especially in populous places, have now dropt giving any account there∣of to the church in any way: and yet these ministers would fain make us believe they are going in the same way which our fathers set out in, when they first came to this country: but let us hear their own testimony in the affair.</P>

<P>Accordingly old Mr. <HI>John Eliot</HI> of <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bury</HI> said,
<Q>It is matter of great thankfulness, that we have Christ <HI>con∣fessed</HI> in our churches; by such as we receive to full communion there. They open the work of Christ in their hearts, and the <HI>relation</HI> thereof is an eminent <HI>con∣fession</HI> of our Lord; experienced saints, can gather more than a little from it. It is indeed an ordinance of won∣derful benefit; the Lord planted many <HI>vineyards</HI> in the first settlement of this country, and there were many <HI>noble vines</HI> in them; it was their <HI>heavenly-mindedness</HI> which disposed them to this exercise, and by the up∣holding of it, the churches are still filled with <HI>noble vines</HI>; it mightily maintains PURITY of churches: 'tis the duty of EVERY Christian. It is a thing that gives great glory to the Lord Jesus Christ; and <HI>young converts</HI> are thereby exceedingly edified; and the souls of <HI>devout christians</HI> are hereby ingratiated one unto another. The <HI>devil</HI> knows what he does when he <HI>thrusts</HI> so hard to get <HI>this custom</HI> out of our churches. For my part, I would say in this case, <HI>get thee behind me satan; thou givest an horrible offence unto the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Let us keep up this ordinance with all <HI>gentleness</HI>; and where we see the least spark of <HI>grace</HI> held forth, let us prize it more than all the wit in the world.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Elliots life p. 68.69.</NOTE> This was the testimony of one of the most faithful and successful ministers that <HI>New-England</HI> ever saw; wherein he boldly ascribes to the <HI>devil</HI> any attempts that were made to <HI>thrust that custom</HI> out of the churches: yet now that custom is treated with contempt by many ministers, who still would be accounted the true successors of those pious fathers.</P>
<P>Indeed our author has got a fine way to get along here, which is by turning off such things for <HI>imperfections,</HI> and he says the <HI>order</HI> of the churches
<Q>was more <HI>perfected</HI> and established afterwards in the year 1662.</Q>
p. 80. Here we shall learn what his notion of perfection is; for in that year was the <HI>synod</HI> which brought in (what we have called) <HI>half way members.</HI> Mr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> president of the college, and Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> of <HI>New-Haven,</HI> both opposed that point in print, as a great <HI>corruption</HI> instead of <HI>perfection</HI>; and Mr. <HI>Eleazer Mather</HI> of <HI>Northampton,</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="010823_0029_0F81D4862631F828"/>
who was in that synod, wrote soon after to Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> that
<Q>There was scarce any of the <HI>congregational</HI> princi∣ples but what were layen at by some of other of the assembly; as <HI>relations</HI> of the work of grace, <HI>power</HI> of <HI>voting</HI> of the fraternity (or brethren) in admissi∣on,</Q>
&amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Hutchinson's history vol 1. p. 224.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F</HI>'s. notion of the order of the churches being <HI>per∣fected</HI> then, makes me think of a story concerning a minister who descended from a member of that synod, who tho' his conduct was not good, yet boasted of treading in his grand∣fathers steps; whereupon another minister of greater note said,
<Q>He had got his grandfathers <HI>imperfections</HI> to <HI>per∣fection.</HI></Q>
Though Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> was then active in bringing in what he called the <HI>middle-way</HI>; Yet the im∣portance of being careful how persons were admitted to the Lord's-supper, still lay upon his mind, and he wrote his tho'ts thereon on Jan. 4. 1664. Wherein, among other things, he brings in this objection, viz. Why may it not
<Q>suffice, for a man publickly to say, <HI>I believe on Christ, or do unfeignedly repent of my sins?</HI> Or to consent to such expressions being read, or propounded unto him, without any more adoe?</Q>
His answer is
<Q>1st. He that can <HI>groundedly</HI> so say, or profess before God, angels and men that he <HI>hath</HI> unfeigned <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>repentance,</HI> can say somewhat more, particularly to shew the <HI>reality</HI> of his acquaintance with those things. And if he can∣not say it, <HI>groundedly,</HI> it is not meet to put him so to say, 2<SUP>d</SUP>. He that either <HI>cannot</HI> or <HI>will not</HI> say any more than so, he renders the <HI>truth</HI> of his <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>repentance,</HI> sus∣picious so that a <HI>rational charity,</HI> cannot acquiesce in it.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mitchel's life. p. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>There has been a great deal of smother raised in our day to hide or get over these self evident truths, many have been for lowering the profession so that it might not imply saving faith in it; but Zion's king says <HI>He that is not for me is against me</HI>; and he declares that <HI>publicans</HI> and <HI>har∣lots go into the kingdom of God before</HI> those who said, <HI>I go sir; and went not. Halting between two opinions</HI>; a pretending to be for God, and yet not being <HI>truly</HI> so, has always been one of the greatest evils, and most fatal snares that any men can be taken in. And as to the noise which many have made against our principles as tho' they tended
<PB N="57" REF="010823_0029_0F81D4862631F828"/>
to perplex sincere minds; this argument has justly been retorted back again: for none will pretend to admit per∣sons without some sort of qualification or other: and 'tis vastly more difficult to determine the point concerning <HI>mo∣ral</HI> sincerity, than <HI>gracious</HI> sincerity; for the first is only restraints and influences <HI>upon</HI> a person, while the other is a living principle <HI>within</HI> him; and I think this is an unanswer∣able reason which Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> gives, why the latter, and not the other, makes meet members for Christ's Church, namely that moral sincerity is <HI>transient,</HI> and may be intire∣ly lost; but a gracious principle <HI>abides</HI> for ever. As to the frightful consequence which some draw, that if none but gracious persons ought to be received to communion, then we can never know whether our communion is right or not, in this world: Old Mr. <HI>Shephard</HI> gave a sufficient answer thereto an 120 years ago, in these words.</P>
<P>"Q. <HI>What members ought every particular visible church "to consist of?</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>A.</HI> Christ being head of every particular church, and it his body, hence none are to be members of the church, but such as are members of Christ by faith, 1 Cor. 1.2. 1 Thes. 1.</Q></P>
<P>"Q. <HI>But do not hypocrites, and no true members of Christ</HI> "creep in?</P>
<P><Q>A. Yes: But if they could have been known to be such they ought to be kept out; and when they are known, they are orderly to be cast out. Mat. 25.1. 2 Tim. 3.5. Rev. 2.20. Tit. 3.10.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His first principles of the oracles of God. p. 25, 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have been the more particular on this head, because all the controversy turns very much upon it, and since Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says the separates
<Q>admitted members not so much upon <HI>outward</HI> evidence, as upon <HI>inward fellowship</HI> or <HI>feel∣ing.</HI></Q>
p. 145. I will add a little more concerning that matter: and I doubt not but many have had confused notions concerning fellowship, and have often put the <HI>effect</HI> for the <HI>cause,</HI> i. e. have taken what they felt towards other, for the evidence of others good estate; whereas all affections toward others, are caused by what is some way or other <HI>manifested</HI> from them; and if what others mani∣fest be genuine evidences of grace, then our love thereto is genuine; but if what others manifest is not genuine lan∣guage or exercises, and we are delighted therewith, those af∣fections in us are as corrupt as the causes which produced them: hence Jesus says, <HI>First cast out the beam out of thine

own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of thy brothers eye.</HI> And tho' the word, <HI>feeling</HI> is often cast upon us as a term of roproach, yet as certain as the bible is true, all those professors that don't <HI>love one another with a pure heart,</HI> have but the dead carcase of religion. And as a principal means of begetting and increasing this love, is <HI>declaring</HI> to each other what <HI>God has done</HI> for our <HI>souls</HI>; so our Lord says, <HI>Every tree is known by his own fruit,—a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good:</HI> And the beloved disciple says, <HI>That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us,</HI> &amp;c. And to shew that our sentiments are not singular, as well as for the edification of the saints, I will here transcribe a little of what was wrote in the last century, by one who is allow'd to be a man of as great learning and piety as any in his day.</P>
<P>I mean Dr. <HI>John Owen,</HI> who, after observing how men are liable to mistakes in various ways, and giving cautions accordingly, he proceeds to speak of some duties which can't be performed without some knowledge of others state, and also of the way wherein it is attained," 1st. There are, says he,
<Q>many duties incumbent on us to be performed, with and towards professors, which without admitting a judgment to be made of their state and con∣dition, cannot be performed in faith. And in reference unto these duties alone, it is that we are called to judge the state of others. For we are not giving countenance unto a rash uncharitable censuring of mens spiritual conditions, nor unto any judging of any men, any other than what our own duty towards them doth in∣dispensably require. Thus if we are to lay down our lives for the brethren, it is very meet that we should so far know them so to be, as that we may hazard our lives in faith when we are called thereunto. We are also to join with them in those ordinances wherein we make a solemn profession, that we are members of the same body with them, that we have the same head, the same faith and love: we must love them because they are begotten of God, children of our heavenly fa∣ther; and therefore must on some good ground believe them so to be. In a word, the due performance of all principal mutual gospel duties, to the glory of God, and our own edification, depend upon this supposition, that we may have such satisfying persuasion concerning the
<PB N="59" REF="010823_0030_0F81D4866A417970"/>
spiritual condition of others, as that from which we may take our aim in what we do.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. For the grounds hereof, I shall mention one only, which all others do lean upon. This is pressed, 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. As the body is one, and hath many mem∣bers, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body, so is Christ: for by one spirit we are all bapti∣zed into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been made all to drink into one spirit. They are all united unto, and hold of one head; so is Christ mystical, that is, all believers under Christ their head. And this union they have by the inhabi∣tation of the same quickning Spirit, which is in Christ their head, and by him they are all brought into the same spiritual state and frame; they are made to drink into one and the same spirit; for this same spirit pro∣duceth the same effects in them all, the same in kind tho' differing in degrees, as the apostle fully declares. Eph. 4.3—6. And this spirit is in them and not in the world, Joh. 16. And as it gives them a naturalness in their duties one towards another, or in mutual caring for, rejoicing and sorrowing with one another as mem∣bers one of another. 1 Cor. 12.25, 26. So that it reveals and discovers them to each other, so far as is neccessary for the performance of the duties mentioned, in such a manner as becomes members of the same body. There is on this account a spiritually natural answering of one to another, as face answereth face in the water, they can see and discern that in others whereof they have expe∣rience in themselves, they taste and relish that in others which they feed upon in themselves, and wherein the lives of their souls do consist; the same spirit of life be∣ing in them, they have the same spiritual taste and fa∣vor. And unless their palates are distempered by temp∣tation or false opinion or prejudices, they can in their communion taste of that spirit in each other, which they are all made to drink into. This gives them the same likeness and image in the inward man, the same heavenly light in their minds, the same affections; and being thus prepared to judge and discern of the states of each other, in reference unto their mutual duties, they have moreover the true rule of the word to judge of all spirits and spiritual effects by. And this is the ground of all that love without dissimulation, and real communion
<PB N="60" REF="010823_0031_0F81D4872A4793F0"/>
that is among the saints of God in this world. If these are omitted, there is an end of all profitable use of church-society. Churches without this, are but mere husks and shells of churches, carcases without souls; for as there is no real union unto Christ without faith, so there is no real union among the members of any church without love, and that acting itself in all the duties mentioned, let not this ordinance be in vain.</Q>

<HEAD>V. To speak of what Ministers Power real∣ly is, and how they come by it.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E have seen much already of what power they pretend to have; but 'tis needful to open what authority Christ has really given to his mini∣sters. And the plain account in his word is,</P>
<P N="1">1. That their authority is not over the <HI>bodies,</HI> but it concerns the <HI>souls</HI> of men. <HI>Obey them,—for they watch for your souls,</HI> Heb. 13.17. And, 2. They have no power to make rules, nor to govern others judgments, but only to explain the rules which are made, and labour to move others to regard them. <HI>Not for that we have do∣minion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.24. <HI>I speak as to wise men:</HI> JUDGE YE <HI>what I say.</HI> 1 Cor. 10.15. Hence, 3. The peoples obligation to regard and follow any teachers, de∣pends upon their <HI>teaching right. We have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</HI> 2 Cor. 4.2. They who teach right, teach by practice as well as word. <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which</HI> WALE <HI>so as ye have us for an</HI> ENSAMPLE: and he warns them against persons of a contrary <HI>walk,</HI> who <HI>mind earthly things,</HI> Phil. 3.17—19. Again he says, <HI>Remember them whic have<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="61" REF="010823_0031_0F81D4872A4793F0"/>
the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conver∣sation,</HI> Heb. 13.7. Note, we are not to obey and follow them in an implicit, or customary way, but each one must <HI>consider,</HI> and follow others no further than they see that the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of their conversation</HI> is, <HI>Jesus Christ the same yester∣day, and to day, and for evermore,</HI> v. 8. Yea, 4. People are so far from being under obligation to follow teachers, who don't lead in <HI>this way,</HI> that they incur guilt by such a following of them. The apostle <HI>John,</HI> speaking of the <HI>doctrine of Christ,</HI> says. <HI>If there come</HI> ANY <HI>unto you; and bring not</HI> THIS DOCTRINE, <HI>receive him not into your house, nor bid him God speed; for he that biddeth him God speed, is</HI> PARTAKER <HI>of his evil deeds,</HI> 2 John 10.11. And the great apostle of the gentiles says, <HI>Tho' we or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you,</HI> (and than, that ye <HI>have received</HI>) <HI>let him be accursed,</HI> Gal. 1.8, 9. And now, where is the power that is derived by a <HI>local succession</HI> from the apostles? And which many hold their authority from as ministers, and carry it so high as to <HI>forbid</HI> those who <HI>follow not them,</HI> even tho' the reason of it were a matter of conscience, be∣cause they really believed that such ministers neither prea∣ched nor practised agreeable to the gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI> was so far from establishing such a <HI>local</HI> power, that, to guard against all such pretences, he states the case upon the highest pitch of all creature authority, viz. <HI>a∣postles</HI> and <HI>angels</HI>: and leaving all <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>successors</HI> out of the question, he brings it up to the <HI>apostles</HI> themselves, and says, <HI>Tho</HI>' WE preach any other gospel than that <HI>ye have received</HI>; nay, if an <HI>angel</HI> directly <HI>from heaven</HI> should do so, <HI>let him he accursed.</HI> Our modern ministers would evade all this, by telling us that they don't <HI>pervert the gospel,</HI> and that 'tis our erroneous <HI>judgments,</HI> or perverse <HI>will,</HI> that makes us leave them; but <HI>Paul</HI> instead of assuming any such <HI>dominion</HI> over others <HI>faith,</HI> says, <HI>judge ye what I say</HI>; and he implicitly charges them to <HI>reject him</HI> if he should come to them with <HI>another gospel.</HI></P>
<P>Should any object that this allowing every one a right to receive or reject ministers as they judge best, will bring ministers authority to nothing, and so destroy such an or∣der of men out of the church:</P>
<P>I reply, that 'tis so far from it, that this is the only way to establish the gospel ministry, upon its right foundation: for as Christ's kingdom is <HI>not of this world,</HI> but its foun∣dation
<PB N="62" REF="010823_0032_0F81D487F3613E78"/>
and support is <HI>truth,</HI> and his ministers are furnished with that <HI>treasure</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 4.7.</NOTE> in their souls; so the <HI>manifestation</HI> thereof <HI>commends</HI> them to every man's <HI>conscience,</HI> beyond what all others approbation can do. This leads us to view how ministers come by their authority. When Zion's king ascended on high, he <HI>gave gifts to man</HI>; a special part whereof were, <HI>pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4.8—12.</NOTE> And his command is, AS EVERY <HI>man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 4 10.</NOTE> This natu∣rally opens the way for their being received into office in the church, as <HI>gifts</HI> from her king. <HI>Peter</HI> told the hun∣dred and twenty disciples, that of the men which had com∣panied with them, all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among them, one must be <HI>ordained</HI> to be a <HI>witness</HI> with the apostles of his resurrection: accordingly they <HI>gave forth their lots</HI>; and thereby <HI>Matthias</HI> was put into that office. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts 1.21—26.</NOTE> And after the apostles were endowed with extraordinary <HI>power</HI> from on high, to <HI>witness</HI> for Christ, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">ver. 8.</NOTE> yet they did not so much as nominate the <HI>seven men,</HI> who were to be put into office in their presence, but said, <HI>Bre∣thren, look ye eat among you seven men of honest report, full of the holy ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</HI> They did accordingly, and set the men be∣fore the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. Act. 6.3, 6. And in Acts 14.23. which speaks of <HI>ordain∣ing elders in every church</HI>; many learned men assert, that the word which is translated, <HI>ordained,</HI> signifies the <HI>act of the church,</HI> declaring their choice of those elders, by <HI>stretch∣ing out, or listing up the hands.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the margin of <HI>Cann's</HI> bible; Dr. Watt's orthodoxy and charity, and Dr. Gill on the place.</NOTE> And when <HI>Paul</HI> had given to <HI>Timothy</HI> a particular description of the characters of those who are to be put into the office both of bishops and deacons, he declares plainly that his design therein was, that <HI>Timothy</HI> might know how he ought to behave himself, IN <HI>the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.15. Observe, he had no power <HI>over</HI> the church, but was to act as a leader <HI>in</HI> the church; and teach them what sort of men are to be chose into office, and assist in placing them therein. It is well
<PB N="63" REF="010823_0032_0F81D487F3613E78"/>
known that the word <HI>elder</HI> in scripture, does not always mean persons in office, either in church or state; but often is used only for persons of superior gifts, age or experience; yea the name, when applied to officers, seems to derive its original, from the custom of chusing such persons into office; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Elders among the <HI>Jews,</HI> were the most considerable persons for age, experience, and wisdom, who constituted the council of the people; among the <HI>primative christians,</HI> those of the first rank in the church were called <HI>elders</HI></Q>
<BIBL><HI>Dycht's</HI> dictionary.</BIBL></NOTE> and in this very epistle the word is plainly used in a sense, which does not distinguish those who are in office from others, 1 Tim. 5.1, 2.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I can freely leave it with every con∣science to judge, whether the scriptures carry the point a whit further than this, <HI>That leading men in the primitive church, led in ordinations as well as other things.</HI> And who will dispute that point with any body? Those who hold the power to
<Q>constitute in office, and to remove from office,</Q>
to be intirely in the church, yet always ap∣point leading men, (and such as are in office when they can be conveniently had) to act in and for the church, in ordinations. Much stress is laid by many, on the terms, <HI>commit thou,</HI> in 2 Tim. 2.2. in order to prove the power of ordination to be inherent in them, who are already in office; but it has been already proved, that the apostles themselves, (even tho' they sometimes conveyed extraordi∣nary gifts by laying on their hands, yet) did not pretend to act in ordinations, only in consequence of the churches act; therefore they properly acted as the churches mouth, in putting men into office, and <HI>charging</HI> them to be faith∣ful therein: and <HI>Timothy,</HI> and all other leaders, ought to be very careful when they are called to assist in ordinati∣ons, to see that they commit the charge of souls, only to <HI>faithful men. Paul</HI> in writing to this same person, useth the same words, This <HI>charge</HI> I <HI>commit</HI> unto thee; and, I <HI>give</HI> thee <HI>charge,</HI> as synonymous terms, 1 Tim. 1.18. &amp; 6.13. And be the right of ordination where it will, yet this is certain, that the direction is to commit the charge of souls to <HI>faithful men</HI>; and none but such can truly be in the gospel line; and when any <HI>creep in,</HI> under a <HI>sheeps cloath∣ing,</HI> who are not truly such; when they discover by their fruits that they are <HI>false</HI> men, our Lord commands his peo∣ple to <HI>beware of them,</HI> Mat. 7.14, 15.</P>
<P>Another text which is often advanced to prove that mi∣nisterial power is handed down by an external line from
<PB N="64" REF="010823_0033_0F81D488B1B75738"/>
the apostles, is Mat. 28.18,—20. But I think two things may be sufficient to evince the absurdity of construing that commission and promise in such a way.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the promises of God, are IN Christ Jesus; and the heirs of promise are only such as have <HI>fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.20. Heb. 6.17, 18. How vain then must the attempt be, to apply that promise to any who have not <HI>fled</HI> to the gospel <HI>refuge</HI>?</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Lord connects <HI>precept</HI> and <HI>promise</HI> together in the text, <HI>Teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world</HI>: Therefore this promise is so far from supporting a <HI>succession</HI> of unconverted ministers, that it could not support even the apostles themselves, if they turn∣ed aside from the line of truth; yea, instead of the <HI>promise,</HI> the <HI>curse</HI> would seize upon an apostle or angel, if they should turn off from the gospel way, as I have proved be∣fore. Should any say, that those words of <HI>Paul</HI> are <HI>hypo∣thetical</HI> expressions; i. e. supposing a case for illustration, which is not granted, for 'tis readily allowed, that they are so; but I would have people remember, that 'tis chiefly from such ways of speaking, that they draw their pleas for unconverted ministers, as from 1 Cor. 13.1—3. &amp;c.</P>
<P>To shew that my opinion about a line of succession is not singular, I will transcribe some of Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>'s thoughts thereon, which were published in <HI>London</HI> 1692. in a small piece called, "A guide to church-fellowship and order," wherein he says, p. 47, 48.
<Q>The office of the ministry, for the <HI>continuation</HI> of the <HI>church state,</HI> and administra∣tion of all ordinances of worship unto the end of the world, is sufficiently secured, (1.) By the <HI>law,</HI> consti∣tution and appointment of our Lord Jesus Christ, erect∣ing that office, and giving warranty for its continuance, to the consummation of all things, Mat. 28.20. Eph. 4.13. (2.) By his continuance according unto his promise, to communicate <HI>spiritual gifts</HI> unto men, for the ministerial edification of the church.—(3.) On the duty of believers, or of the <HI>church,</HI> which is, to chuse, call, and solemnly set apart unto the office of the mini∣stry, such as the Lord Christ by his spirit, hath made meet for it, according unto the rule of his word.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If all these, or any of them do fail, I acknowledge, says he, that all <HI>ministerial authority</HI> and ability for the dispensation of gospel ordinances must fail also, and consequently the state of the <HI>church.</HI> And those who
<PB N="65" REF="010823_0033_0F81D488B1B75738"/>
plead for the continuation of a <HI>successive ministry,</HI> with∣out respect unto these things, without resolving both the <HI>authority</HI> and <HI>office</HI> of it unto them, do but erect a <HI>dead image,</HI> instead of the living and life giving institutions of Christ. They take away the <HI>living creature,</HI> and set up a <HI>skin stuffed with straw.</HI></Q>
Thus far Dr. <HI>Owen.</HI></P>
<P>Compare this with the opinions of the present day. Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> says,
<Q>Tis true indeed, Jesus did not go into the <HI>colleges</HI> or schools of learning, for his first ministers: nor was there any need of such a step, while Christ him∣self was personally present, to educate his sons. But they, whom he took into his school, were chiefly unlearn∣ed and ignorant men: to whom, in a little time, he gave such a measure of knowledge, learning and grace, as abundantly qualified them for the great work, where∣to he appointed them.</Q>
p. 15. But now he says,
<Q>The <HI>separates</HI> having shut learning out of doors, have there∣by deprived themselves of the <HI>best means</HI> of obtaining and preserving the <HI>knowledge</HI> of <HI>pure divine truths.</HI></Q>
p. 169.
<Q>Neither do they <HI>know</HI> whether the bible is rightly translated, ONLY as they have it from the <HI>learned.</HI></Q>
p. 167. And he says, our holding the whole <HI>power</HI> of <HI>ordi∣nation</HI> to be in the <HI>church,</HI> is
<Q>without <HI>any</HI> direction in the whole word of God; and contrary to plain gospel example. p. 145.</Q>
But Men says he,
<Q>Having the word of reconciliation <HI>committed</HI> to them, by auth∣orized hands, they become ambassadors for Christ, p. 17.</Q></P>
<P>Here reader observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. That I have proved that he charges us falsely, as to our shutting out learning.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is an awful stroke against the divinity of Jesus Christ: for it has been proved a little back, that the <HI>end</HI> of the <HI>conversation</HI> of true leaders is, Jesus Christ <HI>the</HI> SAME <HI>yesterday, and to day▪ and for ever.</HI> But the end of Mr. <HI>Fish</HI>'s <HI>conversation</HI> is the contrary, and so is that of a great part of the ministers of our land: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>About 13 years ago, Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> plainly in print struck against the <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>essentia</HI>▪ divinity of our Lord Jesus. Which occasioned Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s publishing a sermon with an appendix, upon Christ's <HI>power</HI> and <HI>divinity</HI>; to which Dr. <HI>Sewall,</HI> Mr. <HI>Prince,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Foxcroft,</HI> wrote a preface, wherein they express their hopes that,
<Q>By the blessing of Christ, it may be of excellent service to guard many of the readers, from those most dangerous suggestions against his adorable deity, which have been of late unhappily published, to the great grief and offence of many among us.</Q></P>
<P>They don't name either the author of book; yet this was the plainest testimony that was published among us on that occasion, as ever I heard of: neither can I learn that Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> ever retracted that dangerous and fundamental error; yet after he died in July 1766, he was celebrated from the pulpit, and press, by many ministers in town and country, as one of the brightest characters among them. Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> who formerly wrote so much to try to prove that <HI>New-England</HI> ministers had not forfeit∣ed their character, by any of their open conduct, published a fu∣neral sermon for him, wherein he greatly extols Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>; and in a note, p. 28. he says,
<Q>Two or 3 years ago a pam∣phlet appeared among us under the name of an <HI>obscure</HI> person, without <HI>reputation</HI>;—in which the Dr. was represented as an <HI>enemy to the atonement made by Jesus Christ.</HI> The writer of that piece (says Dr. <HI>C.</HI>) knew little of the Dr. or the true meaning of his works. He might as well have taxed <HI>any</HI> mini∣ster in the <HI>town</HI> or <HI>province</HI> upon this head.</Q>
If I believed Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s testimony in this, I should have a worse opinion of that order of ministers than I ever yet had; for I have great reason to believe, that Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI>'s writings, have done the most to corrupt peoples minds, and to prejudice them against the pure <HI>doctrines of grace,</HI> as they were held by the <HI>fathers</HI> of this country, of any one man in our land.</P>
<P>The <HI>obscure</HI> person without <HI>reputation,</HI> which Dr. <HI>C.</HI> refers to, is Mr. <HI>John Cleaveland,</HI> who was expell'd out of <HI>college,</HI> after he had been there about 3 years, only for his attending the worship of God, with the church which he was a member of, instead of going to hear a <HI>candidate</HI> which the <HI>association</HI> and the world had set up, in opposition to the <HI>church.</HI> He wrote against two of Dr. <HI>M.</HI> sermons; and the president who expelled him, did himself so much honor on this occasion, as to send Mr. <HI>Cleave∣land</HI> a degree of <HI>master</HI> of <HI>arts.</HI></P></NOTE> For what less can be
<PB N="66" REF="010823_0034_0F81D4897255B630"/>
the import of saying, that Christ taught and qualified men for the ministry, when he was "personally present," as he cannot or does not do now; what less can it be than to say, he is not <HI>truly God</HI> by nature, but only so by <HI>office,</HI> and that having set up officers in his kingdom, he has gone to heaven, and left them to order affairs in his absence? God has often changed his dispensations, but his nature and his grace remain ever the same. He inspired men to write the scriptures, and gave them power to <HI>confirm his word</HI> with <HI>diverse miracles</HI>; which is not necessary, since the bible is acknowledged to be complete. But 'tis as great a truth now, as ever, that, <HI>No man knoweth the things of God, but the spirit of God</HI>; and that each faint has <HI>receiv∣ed</HI> this spirit, that they <HI>might</HI> KNOW <HI>the things that are freely given to them of God.</HI> Yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> declares that we
<PB N="67" REF="010823_0034_0F81D4897255B630"/>
don't
<Q>know whether we have the <HI>pure divine truths</HI> or not, ONLY as we have it from the <HI>learned.</HI></Q>
Whereas <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>my speech, and my preaching was not with entice∣ing words of man's wisdom, but in</HI> DEMONSTRATION <HI>of the</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>and of power: that your</HI> FAITH <HI>should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.4, 5.11, 12. And <HI>John</HI> says, <HI>little children, ye have an uncti∣on from the holy</HI> ONE, and <HI>ye</HI> KNOW <HI>all things</HI>; and <HI>the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same anoint∣ing, teacheth you of all things.</HI> And he expressly declares, that <HI>it is the spirit of antichrist</HI> which <HI>denies this.</HI> 1 John 2.18 — 27.</P>
<P>Then let Mr. <HI>F.</HI> look to it; for he has told us from Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> that the
<Q><HI>best</HI> of human nature, if not united to the divine nature, is no better than <HI>sand</HI> to build the church upon.</Q>
p 56. Yea, and he has also given it as a clear mark of Christ's church, that it always has his <HI>holy spirit dwelling in it.</HI> What nonsense (if no worse) then is it, to tell of Christ's servants deriving their <HI>knowledge</HI> of the truth and <HI>right</HI> to preach it, only from the hands of men? His argument is that,
<Q>There is nothing of <HI>inspiration</HI> in <HI>translating</HI> the bible.</Q>
Answer, there is as much of in∣spiration in that, as there is in <HI>transcribing</HI> of it; and how many thousand times has that been done, before it came to the copy that he has seen? and how does he know he has got the <HI>pure truth,</HI> as it was wrote by inspiration? True protestants all confess, that the <HI>certain</HI> knowledge of the truth, is attained only by the same way in the nature of it, which <HI>Paul</HI> points out for the <HI>unlearned,</HI> to gain it by; even that when truth is rightly delivered in <HI>words easy to be understood, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all; and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</HI> This is in the midst of the chapter, which is concluded with a precept which these ministers often remind us of, viz. <HI>Let all things be done decent∣ly and in order,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.9, 24, 25, 40. And a main <HI>indecency</HI> and <HI>disorder</HI> which is therein condemned, is speak∣ing in the church, in language not easily understood. And who are more guilty of such <HI>disorders</HI> than these great pre∣tenders to <HI>learning</HI>! And what can be a greater plague to the church, than the setting up men for ministers, who never came to this <HI>knowledge of the truth</HI>?</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="010823_0035_0F81D48AA0B36DF0"/>But here I am checked, for Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says,
<Q>We appro∣bate <HI>none</HI> for the work of the ministry, without <HI>enquiring</HI> after, and <HI>obtaining</HI> some hopeful evidences of an inward work of grace:</Q>
and he says, that for separates to sug∣gest the contrary,
<Q>shows a want of good temper, and of a tender regard to <HI>truth</HI>; for they might <HI>know</HI> better if they would.</Q>
p. 166.</P>
<P>I desire to be informed, how we shall <HI>know better.</HI> Does Mr. <HI>F.</HI> believe in his conscience, that renewing grace is entailed to <HI>colleges</HI>? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> was far from thinking so; for the same book where he would confine the ministers to such as <HI>man had taught</HI> for that purpose; yet he says of colleges,
<Q>They ought to be so constituted, that vice and idleness should have no living there: they are intolerable in societies, whose main design is, to train up youth in christian knowledge and eminent piety. —It seems to me to be a reproach to the land, that ever it should be so with <HI>our</HI> colleges, that instead of being places of the greatest advantages for true <HI>piety,</HI> one can't send a child thither, without great danger of his being <HI>infected,</HI> as to his <HI>mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI>; as it has <HI>certainly</HI> sometimes been with <HI>these societies.</HI></Q>
Thoughts on the work, 1742. p. 349, 350. And I suppose it has been more so since, than ever it was before.</NOTE></P>
<P>A gentleman of considerable learning, told me, that he was once discoursing this matter with an aged minister, not far from Mr. <HI>F.</HI> and asked him if he ever knew one who had got his <HI>degree</HI> at <HI>college,</HI> denied an approbation, if he sought it? He replied, that he had known <HI>one</HI>: but upon further enquiry, was forced to confess that, <HI>that one</HI> went into another county and got an <HI>approbation</HI> there. In fact, the right of <HI>trying</HI> ministers, which Christ gave to his <HI>church,</HI> and commended her for exercising that power, in detecting <HI>false</HI> men, (Rev. 2.2.) is now usurped by the <HI>clergy,</HI> and after they have thus robbed God's people of their right, they charge them with want of a <HI>good tem∣per,</HI> if they will not be easy under such tyranny; and with a want of regard to <HI>truth,</HI> if they suggest that ministers don't use that power aright.</P>
<P>I would be far from charging them all with this; for one of Mr. <HI>Fish</HI>'s brethren of as good credit as he, says of many who have taken degrees at college.
<Q>Alas, for the <HI>encouragement</HI> they meet with! No sooner do these <HI>light, airy, fashionable</HI> young men, who evidently <HI>deny, oppose</HI> and banter, both publickly and privately, the great soul humbling, and Christ exalting <HI>doctrines</HI> of the gos∣pel,
<PB N="69" REF="010823_0035_0F81D48AA0B36DF0"/>
and ridicule experimental religion as <HI>enthusiasm,</HI> and resolve christian experiences into an <HI>over heated imagination,</HI> and <HI>disorder'd brain,</HI> if not <HI>satanical delusi∣on</HI>; I say no sooner do these young men come forth from the feet of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> into the world, and begin to exercise their gifts, but they are <HI>at once</HI> invited to preach and settle in the ministry; and there are <HI>ministers</HI> and churches enough that will ordain them, notwithstanding the <HI>testimony</HI> which the serious, and such as are concer∣ned for the doctrines and interest of Christ, bear against it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This is too much the case at this day. We have <HI>fre∣quent</HI> and <HI>flagrant</HI> instances of it; he that <HI>runs</HI> may read it, and he is <HI>wilfully blind</HI> that does not see it. And alas how dark the aspect on <HI>these churches! These things are a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.</HI></Q>

<P>Let these ministers make <HI>straight paths</HI> for their own <HI>feet,</HI> before they bear so hard upon us again, for leaving of them.</P>
<P>Before I leave this head, I would insert a few passages ta∣ken from Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> who says,
<Q>Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> denies unto the people all liberty or ability to chose their own pastors, to <HI>judge</HI> what is meet for their own <HI>edification</HI>; what is heresy, or a pernicious error, and what is not, or any thing of like nature. This is almost the same with that of the Pharisees, concerning them who admi∣red and followed the doctrine of our Saviour, John 7.49. <HI>This people which know not the law.</HI> — Yet was it <HI>this people</HI> whom the apostles directed to chose out from among themselves, persons meet for an evangelical office, Act 6. The same people who joined with the apostles and elders in the consideration of the grand case concerning the continuation of the legal ceremonies, and were associates with them in the determination of it, Acts 15. The same to whom all the apostolical epistles excepting some to particular persons, were written. — unto whom of all sorts, it is commanded that they should examine &amp; try the spirit of antichrist and false teachers. — 1 John 2, 3. &amp;c. <HI>That people,</HI> who in following ages adher'd unto the faith, and the orthodox profession of it, when almost <HI>all the bishops</HI> were become <HI>Arian</HI> heri∣ticks.—This principle of the reformation, in vindication of the rights, liberties and privileges of christian people,

to <HI>judge</HI> and chose for themselves in matters of religion, we do abide by, and maintain.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Yea, says Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> I shall not be afraid to say, that as the reformation was begun and carried on by this principle: so when <HI>this people</HI> shall thro' an apprehensi∣on of their ignorance, weakness and unmeetness to judge in matters of religion for themselves, and their own duty, be kept and debar'd from it; or when thro' their own sloth, negligence and viciousness, they shall be really uncapable to manage their own interest in church affairs, as being fit only to be governed, if not as brute crea∣tures, yet as mute persons, and that these things are im∣proved by the ambition of the clergy, ingrosing all things in the church to themselves, as they did in former ages, — if the <HI>old popedom</HI> do not return, a <HI>new</HI> one will be erec∣ted as bad as the other.</Q>

<P>I leave others to judge how near this comes to our day, with only observing, that we have seen one who calls him∣self a <HI>congregational minister,</HI> not only claiming great pow∣er in the church for himself and brethren, and judging others hearts; but also claiming <HI>infallibility</HI> in his judg∣ment: for he concludes his long story of Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> with these words, viz.
<Q>Suffer me here, to drop a word of awakening, to all <HI>you</HI> that have separated from our churches, that if <HI>this confession</HI> of Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> toge∣ther with the truths that <HI>have</HI> been, and <HI>are yet</HI> to be told you, don't convince you that you have been, and still are <HI>deluded,</HI> that is, <HI>deceived</HI> and turned aside from the way of truth and duty, <HI>in the matter of your separa∣ting,</HI> you may, from your <HI>non conviction,</HI> KNOW FOR CERTAIN, not only that you <HI>are</HI> thus <HI>deluded,</HI> but that your <HI>delusion</HI> is very strong.</Q>
p. 128.</P>
<P>It deserves particular notice, that this <HI>new infallible</HI> tri∣bunal, delivers off the sentence, as the <HI>old</HI> one used to do, from a <HI>fallible</HI> rule; which rule the judge does not seem to understand very well himself; for Mr. <HI>Dapenport's</HI> great∣est error was, his assuming the power to himself to <HI>try</HI> mi∣nisters, and then his openly "advising and urging" people to forsake such as he had condem'd, by a
<Q>judgment for∣med, (in several instances) rashly, and upon slender grounds,</Q>
and 'tis expressly "<HI>such separations</HI>" that he condemned and retracted; and the wrong which he parti∣cularly
<PB N="71" REF="010823_0036_0F81D48AEC45BD80"/>
observed in <HI>exhorters,</HI> was their being "puft up." This is the rule that our new judge gives sentence upon: and in p. 164. he says,
<Q><HI>Stand by thy self, come not near me, for I am bolier than thou,</HI> (Psal. 65.5.) is certain∣ly the language of spiritual pride; but this was the lan∣guage of separating from our churches, because (as they said) there were hypocrites in them, which they could commune with.</Q>
But I think we may claim liberty of a <HI>review</HI> upon this judgment: for the text says nothing con∣cerning separating <HI>good</HI> men from <HI>bad</HI> ones: others are allowed to be <HI>holy,</HI> but the proud language is, I am <HI>holier</HI> than thou. Now this being the state of the case, let us look a little forward, and observe that our new judge owns the separates to be
<Q>erring brethren, and obliging good neighbours;</Q>
yet some of his concluding advice to his people is,
<Q>Go not after them nor follow them.—How can you, with a good conscience, after <HI>I have shewn you</HI> from <HI>whence</HI> they arose, their <HI>principles, spirit</HI> and <HI>tendency</HI>? They are <HI>separates</HI>; let them be so, let them alone.</Q>
p. 191.</P>
<P>Another article that Mr. <HI>D.</HI> confessed was his
<Q>follow∣ing <HI>impulses</HI> or <HI>impressions,</HI> as a <HI>rule</HI> of conduct, whe∣ther they came with or without a text of scripture; and neglecting to observe the <HI>analogy</HI> of scripture.</Q>
This Mr. <HI>F.</HI> declares to be our case, p. 140. and by others, all inside religion is often treated with contempt under those names; as if none followed unreasonable <HI>impressions,</HI> but those who are zealous in religion; whereas all men are more or less guilty of such conduct: therefore I will insert bishop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s thoughts thereon, who says,
<Q>There is a <HI>tyranny</HI> in most men's nature, which makes them desire to subdue all others, by the strength of their under∣standing;—this <HI>imperious</HI> temper when it works upon subjects of <HI>religion,</HI> finds somewhat to raise its spleen, that was of itself imperious enough before; and that which is called <HI>fury</HI> and <HI>rage,</HI> when it is employed in other <HI>disputes,</HI> comes to be called <HI>zeal,</HI> when it is turned towards the theories that relate to another world. But when we consider what a sublime thing <HI>divine truth</HI> is, and what a poor low thing the <HI>mind of man</HI> is, we shall see cause to blunt a little the edge of our spirits, if they are too sharp in such matters. Man is much governed by <HI>fancy,</HI> and fancy follows the texture of the animal spirits, which render many more capable of apprehending ob∣jects, that are some way proportioned to them, and more disposed to follow them; so that <HI>temper</HI> prepares men
<PB N="72" REF="010823_0037_0F81D48BAD2D71E8"/>
for some opinions, and prepossesses them against others. With the greatest part of mankind, <HI>education</HI> is so pow∣erful that they are scarce ever able to overcome it; and if education and temper have hit together, it will require a very extraordinary elevation to rescue a man from their force.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to bishop <HI>Burnet's</HI> translation of <HI>Lactantious</HI>'s history of persecutors, 1687.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let our antagonist duly consider this, and we shall hope to see him treat his brethren in another manner than he has done, concerning their leaving the ways that <HI>education</HI> inclines him to persist in. I shall finish Mr. <HI>Davenport's</HI> affair with remarking, that tho' our author mentions his <HI>burning of books,</HI> and attempting the same concerning <HI>cloaths,</HI> and <HI>ornaments</HI> at <HI>New-London</HI>; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Which was on March 6th and 7th, 1743.</NOTE> yet he seems hardly sensible wherein the greatest mistake lay, in them transactions; which according to my weak apprehension was, in venting their resentment against things <HI>without,</HI> and not regarding what was <HI>within</HI> as they ought: for if we could burn all the <HI>idols, books</HI> or <HI>hereticks</HI> in the world, it would avail us nothing, without <HI>charity</HI> in our own souls, which <HI>rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.</HI> It is high time to come to treat a little,</P>

<Q><HI>Writing</HI> down all that is judged expedient to deliver, at that time, and <HI>pray∣ing</HI> for assistance in delivering, is no way in∣consistent, but incumbent duty.</Q>
Eccl. 12.9, 10.
<Q>Because the preacher <HI>was</HI> wise, <HI>he still</HI> taught the peo∣ple knowledge, yea he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. The preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</Q>
Answer, <HI>Solomon wrote</HI> his proverbs and speeches, in order to spread them thro' the world, but who ever thought that he read his <HI>prayer,</HI> and <HI>sermon</HI> at the dedication of the temple, 1 Kin. 8.? or his other speeches to the people. When <HI>writing</HI> for the press, and <HI>writing</HI> for the <HI>pulpit,</HI> can be proved to be equal, then this text may serve the turn 'tis brought for, and not 'till then. Forty five years ago Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> called this <HI>reading</HI> of sermons a "<HI>late</HI> practice of <HI>some</HI> ministers;" 'twas an upstart notion then, and he gives these reasons
<PB N="73" REF="010823_0037_0F81D48BAD2D71E8"/>
against it, viz. 1.
<Q><HI>It was not the manner of the prophets and apostles. Barak</HI> read the roll that was written from the mouth of <HI>Jeremiah</HI>; but <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was not wont to read his prophecies. It was the manner of the <HI>Jews</HI> to read the scriptures in the synagogues; but after that, it was their way to instruct and exhort men, not from any writ∣ten copy: Act. 13.15. Luk. 4.17, 20.</Q></P>

<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s answer to Mr. <HI>Ball,</HI> p. 43. vid the end of <HI>Stod∣dard's</HI> sermon.</NOTE> And I think these two reasons may evince the truth of his sentence: viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. This <HI>reading method</HI> is a principal means of uphold∣ing <HI>ignorant</HI> and <HI>false</HI> men in a way of <HI>imposing</HI> on man∣kind. We have proof by various evidences, that several scholars in our colleges, both formerly and laterly, who either wanted a capacity or an inclination for learning, have practiced the getting others to make their <HI>lessons</HI> for them; and so by the use of <HI>notes</HI> they learn to <HI>impose</HI> up∣on their tutors at college, and upon the people after they come from it. Hence,</P>
<P N="2">2. It has a natural tendency to make the word of God of none effect, which requireth saints to <HI>know</HI> their teachers, and to esteem them very highly in love, <HI>for their works sake,</HI> 1 Thes. 5.12, 13. Whereas in <HI>this way,</HI> tho' people may sometimes <HI>know</HI> that their minister reads <HI>other mens works</HI>; yet how can they ever know when they <HI>read their own</HI>? One distinguishing character of false teachers is, that they have <HI>men's persons in admiration, because of advantage</HI>: and so instead of <HI>knowing</HI> and <HI>esteeming</HI> ministers for their <HI>works-sake,</HI> they would have their <HI>persons in admiration</HI> for the sake of their <HI>great swelling words</HI> and sounding <HI>titles.</HI> These are <HI>murmurers</HI> and <HI>complainers,</HI> who often

<P>I heartily concur with the sentiments of an eminent mi∣nister in <HI>London</HI> above 20 years ago, who said,
<Q><HI>Paul's</HI> advice to <HI>Timothy</HI> is, <HI>meditate on these things, give thyself wholly unto them.</HI> 1 Tim. 4.15. You will find it in spirituals, as it is in temporals, the diligent hand ma∣keth rich. He that makes no preparation before hand, what he should say to his people, tempts God to come out of his ordinary way to his assistance, as he that trusts wholly to his own preparations, makes a <HI>god of his gifts.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>John Hill's</HI> sermons, p. 215.</NOTE> These words were delivered in an ordination sermon, from Luk. 12.42, 43. where ministers are called <HI>stew∣ards</HI>; and as such they ought diligently to improve all the advantages which are given them, to <HI>treasure</HI> up know∣ledge of divine truth; and ever to trust in God for directi∣on and assistance to <HI>bring forth out of their treasure things new and old,</HI> as any occasion calls.</P>
<P>The <HI>method</HI> of true ministers, both in the jewish and christian church, always was to <HI>preach by faith.</HI> 2 Cor. 4.13.
<Q>We having the <HI>same spirit of faith,</HI> as it is written, <HI>I believed, and therefore have I spoken: we also believe, and therefore speak.</HI></Q>
I am sensible that many will own that when a minister has faith in exercise, he can preach better without <HI>notes</HI> than with them, who yet say, he ought to have them, because he may be shut up. Others turn off the text now cited to <HI>extraordinary</HI> times; while both of these insist upon Christ's promise, <HI>Do I am with you alway,</HI> as the main proof of their notion of ministerial au∣thority. Such confused work do men make with the bible!

<HEAD>VII. Of the <HI>way</HI> of Ministers <HI>Support.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E are often told that <HI>they which preach the gospel, should live of the gospel,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.14. but as often, as many have read this text to others, it seems as tho' they had never yet road it to themselves; for the common <HI>practice</HI> of our land says,
<PB N="75" REF="010823_0038_0F81D48DCFAFE650"/>
"They which preach the <HI>gospel</HI> shall live of the law:" yea, and not the <HI>law</HI> of God, but by the <HI>law</HI> of <HI>man</HI>; and however pious the persons might be who first made the law; I think the evidences that have been before exhi∣bited, prove that the law in it self is of such a nature, as that which we read of in Psal. 94.20. For tho' some may think that those <HI>spoiling of goods,</HI> and <HI>haling men and wo∣men to prison,</HI> which we have seen, is only an <HI>abuse</HI> of the law; yet a little reflection may convince them of their mis∣take, and that the <HI>use</HI> of it carries those things in its very nature. The great design of the law, is to make all the inhabitants of the town or parish, pay what the rulers say is their part towards the incumbent ministers support; and the natural language of all that are attached to that way is,
<Q>If others are not <HI>made</HI> to do their part, I will not do mine,</Q>
and where all the people <HI>love to have it so,</HI> they may get along without such open <HI>violence</HI>: but when any happen to be convinced that the way is wrong, and so will not give what is required, they are naturally led to <HI>take it by force.</HI> God said of the priests, who practised so formerly, that their <HI>sin was very great,</HI> 1 Sam. 2.16.17. And how vain is it, for men to say otherwise of such practice now?</P>
<P>Many plead in this case, that promise to the church, that <HI>Kings shall be her nursing fathers, and Queens her nursing mothers.</HI> But what an odd story would it be, for any to tell of very <HI>kind parents,</HI> who manifested such a <HI>tender</HI> re∣gard for their children, that they would <HI>rob</HI> one child of his food, or <HI>cast</HI> him <HI>into a dungeon,</HI> to uphold another in grandeur! Power must be exerted in families or king∣doms to <HI>restrain</HI> one person or community from <HI>injuring</HI> another; but nothing can bring any to act aright in the performance or support of divine worshp, but light and truth. Hence when the place and furniture for worship, was to be provided in the wilderness with costly materials; tho' the great lawgiver, could infallibly have prescribed each mans part by law, if he had been pleased so to do; yet he took another method. For <HI>Moses</HI> spake unto all the congregation of the children of <HI>Israel</HI> saying, <HI>This is the thing which the Lord commanded, saying, Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord; gold, silver,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Exod.</HI> 35.4, 5. So when the <HI>temple</HI> was to be built, <HI>David</HI> appeared as a <HI>nursing father</HI> in <HI>Israel,</HI> and set his <HI>affection</HI> to the house of his God, in such a manner,
<PB N="76" REF="010823_0039_0F81D48E9E4A7888"/>
that of <HI>his own proper goods,</HI> he gave thereto, <HI>three thou∣sand talents of gold,</HI> and <HI>seven thousand talents of refined silver</HI>: and by his instruction and example, he moved other fathers and rulers to <HI>offer willingly</HI> for the house, above 5000 <HI>talents of gold,</HI> and a 10,000 <HI>talents of silver,</HI> beside great preparations of other materials. 1 Chron. 29.3—7. This was the <HI>method</HI> which was taken to prepare a <HI>place</HI> for worship, both in the wilderness, and in the promised land. And as to the <HI>performance</HI> of worship, the constant Languague of the divine direction was, that every person of all ranks should <HI>bring-his offering,</HI> which God had pre∣scribed. And tho' I know but little, yet in all that has been said upon these controversies, I never could see any proof from the bible of any allowance of the use of <HI>coercive</HI> power, to <HI>compel</HI> any to bring their offering, even under the law, where church and state were one: how much less then can it be warrantable under the gospel, where Christ's <HI>kingdom is not of this world</HI>?
<Q>Do ye not know, that they which minister about holy things, live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar? EVEN SO hath the Lord <HI>ordained,</HI> that they which preach the gospel, should live of the gospel. Live or <HI>the gospel</HI> (as one observes) not of the <HI>act of civil authority,</HI> not of a certain bargain made with the people, containing a bond of stipulation: but this is the <HI>order of it</HI>; those whom Christ sends, <HI>profit the people,</HI> and the <HI>church becomes bountiful,</HI> and the <HI>fruit</HI> the gospel produceth maintains the preachers of it.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI> in speaking of its effects among the <HI>Phillippians</HI> says,
<Q>Not because I desire a <HI>gift</HI>: but I desire <HI>fruit that may abound to your account.</HI></Q>
<HI>Phil.</HI> 4.17. And he says to the <HI>Galatians,</HI>
<Q>Let <HI>him</HI> that is <HI>taught</HI> in the word, <HI>communicate unto him</HI> that <HI>teacheth,</HI> in <HI>all good things</HI>: be not <HI>deceived,</HI> God is not mocked.</Q>
Gal. 6.6, 7. The <HI>manner</HI> as well as <HI>matter</HI> of this duty is <HI>ordained</HI> by him; and he will not be <HI>mocked,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where mens <HI>fear</HI> towards God is <HI>taught by the precepts of men,</HI> (Isa. 29.13.) there ministers and people will be principally concerned to secure their <HI>own interest</HI>: but when creatures are taken out of the way, and souls realize that all things are naked and opened unto the <HI>eyes of Him</HI> with whom <HI>we all have to do</HI>; a regard to him will engage ministers to watch for souls, as those who must give account, and to labor to support the weak, and suffer all things, rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. Act. 20.28.—35. 1 Cor. 9.12. And a like view will engage people to <HI>know</HI> and <HI>esteem</HI> true ministers, and not <HI>watch for their halting,</HI> but endeavour to stir them up to be fulfilling their mini∣stry, and also freely to communicate of their carnal things to them, 1 Thes. 5.12, 13. Col. 4.17. 1 Cor. 9.11. Indeed, instead of beating our fellow servants, each one would be concerned to approve himself to his heavenly master, by a right improvement of all the spiritual or temporal gifts, they are made stewards of; and to stir up each other thereto; by the use of all gospel means; and leave <HI>courts, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ables</HI> and <HI>prisons</HI> to be used to discipline the <HI>lawless</HI> world. 1 Cor. 6.1 Tim. 1.9.</NOTE> but takes notice of the

ways of all those, who pay no regard to his command in this respect, and also of those who conceit they have found a better way for its performance, than that which God has prescribed; and he will deal with each of them according to their works.</P>
<P>I am sensible that this is a darling point with many, who will make a dreadful noise about <HI>consequences</HI>: and in particular, they often tell us, that, If it was not for this support of religion by law, a great part of the people would be mere <HI>heathens.</HI> Ah! that is a dreadful thing indeed! But who are <HI>heathens? Paul</HI>'s account of them is, that they had some knowledge of the <HI>truth,</HI> and yet did not practice agreeable to it, but <HI>held the truth in unrighteousness</HI>; and <HI>when they knew God, they glorified him not</HI> AS GOD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 1.18, 19.</NOTE> Such were <HI>heathens</HI> in <HI>Paul</HI>'s day; but things are so much chan∣ged since, that we have a generation of <HI>christians</HI> now, who pay so little regard to <HI>God's authority,</HI> that few of them would do any thing to support their teachers, if <HI>man's authority</HI> was not exerted in the affair.

True obe∣dience respects the <HI>manner</HI> as well as <HI>matter</HI> of the duty, and where the word is express in both, 'tis <HI>rejecting the word</HI> if we don't attend to both, and our conduct (especially if we know better) is <HI>rebellion,</HI> instead of <HI>obedience,</HI> and such worship is <HI>idola∣try,</HI> instead of <HI>hearkning</HI> to the true God.</NOTE> So when destruction was decla∣red of old, as coming upon a <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>sensual</HI> people, under the metaphor of a sweeping tempest, the <HI>scornful men</HI> that <HI>ruled</HI> them said, <HI>When the overflowing scourge shall pass thro', it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falshood have we hid our selves.</HI> Therefore after speaking of the <HI>sure foundation</HI> which <HI>be∣lievers</HI> are built upon, the Lord says, <HI>Judgment will I lay to the line,</HI> and <HI>righteousness to the plummet, and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,</HI> &amp;c.

enduceth the separates to <HI>forfeit</HI> their honour, in break∣ing their <HI>own</HI> and their <HI>fathers</HI> civil covenants, to save their money.</Q>
p. 164. Did mortals ever hear such a <HI>reference</HI> before!</P>
<P N="1">1. If he left the affair with the Lord of conscience, why does he publish such reproachful suggestions to the world? for hereby we are stigmatized in this world, while the tri∣al is refer'd to that which is to come.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the face of this reference to the great Judge, he has judged himself, that we have
<Q>forfeited our honor, to save our money,</Q>
and if that is decided, what then is left to the other Judge? unless it be what <HI>spiritual judges</HI> used to refer to the <HI>secular arm,</HI> viz, the execution of their sentence, and inflicting of punishment upon such as they had condemned.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is a falshood in the face of his bill, for he char∣ges us with "breaking <HI>civil</HI> covenants," whereas we have no contention with him about <HI>civil</HI> covenants; the point we are upon, is the support of <HI>religious worship.</HI> The <HI>offer∣ings</HI> of the people, out of which they who ministred at the altar were fed, were as different from civil contracts, as their own <HI>houses</HI> were from the <HI>temple.</HI> Covenants which are contrary to God's word, ought not to be kept. Did <HI>Herod's</HI> covenant or oath excuse him in taking off <HI>John</HI>'s head? But how are these covenants made, that we should forfeit our honour in breaking of them? Answer, the <HI>majority</HI> of a town or parish votes, to a candidate a certain sum, to come and be their minister; and let them offer ever so much, the candidate rarely takes up with the first proposal, and tho' 'tis often said by ministers, that the "call of the people is the call of God;" yet 'tis commonly the <HI>worldly</HI> sum that turns the scale. This is too evident in our land, to make a jest of; and it has produced the same effects here as in the other <HI>England,</HI> where the excellent <HI>Hervey</HI> cried out with his dying breath,
<Q>Oh! why do ministers neglect the charge of so kind a Saviour; <HI>fawn</HI> upon the <HI>great,</HI> and hunt after <HI>worldly preferments</HI> with so much eagerness, to the disgrace of our order? These, these are the things, and not our poverty or obscurity, which render the clergy so justly contemptible to the worldlings.</Q></P>
<P>It is the majority of the people, be they saints or sinners, which make these covenants, and <HI>John</HI> gives this as a distinguishing mark of <HI>false prophets,</HI> that <HI>they are of the world, therefore speak they of the world, and the world hear∣eth

<Q>that they are plenty and cheap;</Q>
and he says of separates, that
<Q>according to one grand principle of their churches, <HI>every one must exercise his gifts in public,</HI> as he is <HI>impressed</HI> or <HI>moved</HI> by the spirit: which gives them teachers, <HI>heaps</HI> upon <HI>heaps</HI>; besides their ordained elders, who are gene∣rally taken out of the <HI>same heaps.</HI></Q>
p. 163 I have be∣fore shewn that we hold▪ with the apostles, that each one ought to improve the gifts which God has given him; but to pretend that we hold all to have the gift for pub∣lick teachers, is only to give another proof of his being a <HI>false accuser,</HI> if not a <HI>fierce despiser of those that are good.</HI> 2 Tim. 3.3. Instead of our having <HI>heaps</HI> of teachers, there is such a <HI>scarcity</HI> of them, that the cries of hungry souls, constrain ordained elders to be absent from their peo∣ple, much more than they would think to be duty, if there were not so many destitute flocks, while none can pretend, but that there is a <HI>plenty</HI> of teachers on the other side, whom <HI>men have taught,</HI> or <HI>made to themselves</HI>: and let every conscience judge which sort do most to gratify men's <HI>lusts</HI> or <HI>itching ears.</HI> And as to being <HI>cheap,</HI> it is no new thing for men to <HI>lavish gold out of the bag,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. 46.6.</NOTE> to set up and adorn false worship, rather than to <HI>forsake all</HI> for Christ.</P>

page. 173.</P>
<P>Now in order to view this matter in a just light, we should know what a gospel covenant is; and Paul says, <HI>They first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</HI> And <HI>David</HI> says, <HI>I have sworn, and I will per∣form it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</HI> The engagement to God is perpetual, and that to one another is conditional, <HI>by the will of God</HI>; which makes it to be as incumbent duty to withdraw from persons or churches, who are evidently corrupt, and will not be reclaimed, as to walk with those who are not so. Some bring that text in the present case, which says of a saint. He <HI>sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not</HI>: so he does, and he will keep God's righteous judgments, let it turn out to <HI>his own hurt</HI> ever so much; even tho' they put him out of the <HI>synagogua,</HI> or <HI>kill</HI> him therefor. God says to his antient church, I <HI>desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the know∣ledge of God, more than burnt-offerings: but they like men, have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt trea∣cherously against me,</HI> Hos. 6.6, 7.

And will not the same Jesus, vindicate the cause of his dis∣ciples now, when they go over <HI>men's lines</HI> to get food for their <HI>hungry souls</HI>? which was as I have proved the first cause of our separation. One of the most frightful charges which our author lays against us is,
<Q>That the following disorders, are owing <HI>chiefly,</HI> if not <HI>entirely</HI> to the SEPARATIONS, viz.

<P>This is indeed a terrible story, but many a <HI>Jesuit</HI> has told as frightful a one, about the consequences of letting com∣mon people h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the bible; and with as much truth as this: for all the argument turns upon this point, That because many have <HI>abused</HI> liberty, therefore we must not let people <HI>use</HI> it. And tho' both <HI>churchmen</HI> and <HI>dissenters</HI> have often amused people with their <HI>harrangues</HI> upon <HI>li∣berty of conscience</HI>; yet, as Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> observes,

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Owens</HI> guide to church fellowship and order, p. 4, 5.</NOTE> This is the sentence of the same author that Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> quotes, the most of any one when he is shewing the <HI>attempts</HI> which the <HI>gates of hell</HI> makes against Christ's church. And he must be strangely blinded who can't see that the case a∣mong these, which our antagonist calls <HI>congregational</HI> chur∣ches, is exactly like what Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> describes of <HI>national</HI> ones. I have already produced the testimony of the heads of one of the <HI>colleges,</HI> that ministers would confine us all to for teachers, wherein they say,
<Q>That neither the ma∣jor part of the members in full communion, nor <HI>any

other persons</HI> in <HI>any parish</HI> or <HI>society,</HI> have <HI>any</HI> right or warrant to appoint <HI>any</HI> house or place for worship on the sabbath, distinct and separate from, and in oppositi∣on to the <HI>meeting-house,</HI> the public place appointed by the general-<HI>assembly,</HI> and the <HI>parish.</HI></Q>
The general as∣sembly are the <HI>law-givers</HI> for the church, and the parish are the <HI>executors</HI> thereof: and we have instances in all parts of the land, of persons who would not separate from the churches in general, if they might be allowed only the liberty of going a little further over the parish line to join where they are best edified; but that must not be suffered, lest one minister interfere with another, for each one must <HI>look to his gain from his quarter:</HI> and the <HI>honour</HI> also of the parish minister is concerned. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>'Tis St. <HI>Paul's</HI> advice to <HI>Titus</HI> 2.15. <HI>Let no man despise thee.

If a Child of God, and especially one of an in∣terior rank, deals plainly with them, they swell with anger, and tell him, they are not accountable to him; he should meddle with his own business, and not reflect upon the <HI>sacred order.</HI> Now people being very well acquainted with the chur∣lish temper of a <HI>great many</HI> ministers, they are afraid to speak to them at all, or to do any thing which the ministers may in∣terpret to be against the respect due unto them: as for exam∣ple, to frequent the sermons of others, whereby they may be better edifyed, or otherwise to converse with God's faithful ser∣vants.—The way for ministers to avoid contempt, is to perform their duty with all application and diligence, and by leading a blamless life, word off the reproaches and censures of men. True it is, the wicked will speak evil of them, bely and slander them, notwithstanding their unspotted life and conversation; but it is no more, than smoke dissipated by the sun, and their calumny will soon vanish away; for when they are known, no body will believe them any more; but Christ's own lambs will then put an high value and esteem upon the ministers of Christ.</Q>

<P><PB N="85" REF="010823_0043_0F81D494E07B0488"/>A glaring proof of this, has lately been exposed to the public. A number of people in one part of <HI>Ipswich,</HI> with∣drew from a minister, who openly appeared against the re∣vival of religion, above 20 years ago, and embodied into a church, and made choice of Mr. <HI>John Cleaveland</HI> for their pastor; who had been expelled out of <HI>college,</HI> as rela∣ted before: yet a number of ministers, who were friends to that revival, assisted in his ordination, and so received that church into fellowship with the standing churches, and they afterward were set off as a distinct society, by the ge∣neral court. But as they were blessed with a wonderful work of conviction and conversion among them four years ago, many from neighbouring parishes, who had received soul-deliverance there, were desirous of joining to that church, and were accordingly received; which gave so great offence that many neighbouring ministers who own'd it to be a good work, yet have now refused communion with Mr. <HI>Cleaveland</HI> and his church, only because they receive members over parish lines. A distinct <HI>narrative</HI> of these things he published to the world, last summer. So that all the pretence of liberty of conscience in our land, comes to the same <HI>issue</HI> that Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> speaks of, even li∣berty to join with the <HI>parish church,</HI> or be esteemed a <HI>schismatick.</HI></P>
<P><Q>I heartily concur with him that, causeless separations from established churches, walking according to the or∣der of the gospel (tho' perhaps failing in the practice of some things of small concernment) is no small sin: but separation from the sinful practices and disorderly walk∣ings, and false unwarranted ways of worship in any, is to fulfil the precept of <HI>not partaking in other mens sins.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chol p. 37.</NOTE> But (as he says elsewhere) <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Guide to fellowship p. 23.</NOTE> an old <HI>opinion</HI> of the unlawfulness of separation from a church, on the account of the <HI>mixture of wicked men</HI> in it, is made a <HI>scarecrow</HI> to frighten men from attempting the <HI>reforma∣tion</HI> of the greatest evils.</Q>
Again he says,
<Q><HI>churches</HI> are not such <HI>sacred machines</HI> as some suppose, erected and acted for the outward interest and advantage of any sort of men; but only means of the edification of believ∣ers, which they are bound to make use of, in obedience

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guide to fellowship, p. 71.</NOTE> Once "more he says,
<Q>A minister <HI>enabled</HI> by spiritual gifts, and <HI>engaged</HI> by sense of duty to labor constantly in the use of all means appointed by Christ, for the edification of the church, or increase of his mystical body, is requi∣red in such a church, as a believer may conscientiously join himself unto. And where it is otherwise, let men cry out of <HI>schism</HI> and <HI>faction</HI> whilst they please, Jesus Christ will acquit his disciples, in the exercise of their liberty, and accept them in the discharge of their duty.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">ibid. p. 37.</NOTE> Thus far the great Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>; who immediately adds, that,
<Q>If it be said, that if all men be thus allowed to judge of what is <HI>best for their own edification,</HI> and to act according unto the judgment which they make, they will be <HI>continually parting from one church unto another,</HI> until all things are filled with disturbance and confusi∣on; I say, (1.) That the contrary assertion, namely, that men <HI>are not allowed</HI> to judge what is meet and best for their own edification, or not to <HI>act according</HI> to the judgment they make herein, may possibly <HI>keep up some churches,</HI> but is the ready way to <HI>destroy all religion.</HI> (2.) That many of those by whom this liberty is denied unto professing christians, yet do indeed take it for grant∣ed, that they <HI>have such a liberty,</HI> and that it is their du∣ty to make use of it: for what are all the contests be∣tween the <HI>church of Rome, and the church of England,</HI> so far as christians that are not churchmen, are concerned in them? is it not in, whether of these churches <HI>edifica∣tion</HI> may be best obtained? If this be not the ball be∣tween us, I know not what is. — (3.) All christians, <HI>actually do so</HI>; they do judge for themselves, unless they are brutish; they do act according unto that judgment, unless they are hardned in sin, and therefore who do not so are not to be esteemed disciples of Christ. To sup∣pose that all things of spiritual and eternal concernment, that men are not determined and acted, every one by his own judgment, is an imagination of men who think but little of what they are, or do, or say, or write. Even those who <HI>shut their eyes</HI> against the light, and follow in the herd, resolving not to enquire into any of these things, do it, because they <HI>judge it is best for them so to do.</HI> (4.) It is commonly acknowledged by <HI>pro∣testants,</HI> that private christians have a <HI>judgment of dis∣cretion</HI> in things of religion. The term was invented
<PB N="87" REF="010823_0044_0F81D49651344430"/>
to grant them some liberty of judgment, in opposition unto the blind obedience required by the <HI>church of</HI> Rome, but withal to put a <HI>restraint</HI> upon it, and a distinction of some superior judgment, it may be, in the church or others.—But to allow men a judgment of discretion, and not to grant it their duty to act according unto that judgment, is to oblige them to be <HI>fools,</HI> and to act, <HI>not dis∣creetly,</HI> at least not according unto <HI>their own discretion.</HI></Q>
<Q>(5.) The same is to be spoken of <HI>gospel discipline,</HI> with∣out which neither can the duties of church societies be observed, nor the ends of them attained. The neg∣lect, the loss, the abuse hereof, is that which hath ruin∣ed the glory of the christian religion in the world, and brought the whole profession of it into confusion. Here∣on have the fervency and sincerity of true <HI>evangelical,</HI> mutual love been abated, yea, utterly lost: for that love which Jesus Christ requireth among his disciples, is such as never was in the world before, amongst men, nor can be in the world, but on the principles of the gospel, and faith therein. Therefore it is called his <HI>new-command∣ment.</HI> The continuation of it amongst the generality of christians, is but vainly pretended; little or nothing of the reality of it in its due exercise is found. And this hath ensued on the neglect of <HI>evangelical discipline</HI> in churches, or the turning of it into a <HI>worldly dominion.</HI> For one principle end of it, is the preservation, guidance, and acting of this love. That <HI>mutual watch</HI> over one another that ought to be in all the members of the church, the principal evidence and fruit of love without dissimulation, is also lost hereby.

<Q>I do not know how far God may accept of churches in <HI>a very corrupt state,</HI> and of worship much depraved, until they have new means for their reformation.

Rev. 18.4.</P>
<P>I leave every rational soul to judge, whether there has not been many proofs already given, that the churches which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pleads for, are greatly <HI>corrupted</HI> and <HI>depra∣ved,</HI> in those very points which Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> speaks of. Our authors proceedings have often made me think of a man, who had a mind to beat his neighbour, and hastily takes a sword by the blade, to club the other with the hilt; when 'tis only for the other to take hold of the hilt, and he may easily run the aggressor thro' with his own sword. For my part, I am but a poor soldier, and have a natural aversion to fighting; yet since I have seen the truth, and people of God so much abused by Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> and his brethren, I must return the charge, both of <HI>truce-breaking,</HI> and <HI>false-accu∣sing,</HI> to their own doors; for their covenant as ministers, was to <HI>feed</HI> Christ's <HI>sheep</HI> and <HI>lambs</HI>: but instead of that, how have the <HI>green pastures</HI> of experimental religion been <HI>frodden down,</HI> and the <HI>deep water fouled,</HI> i. e. the word of God <HI>corrupted</HI> by them?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F's nine sermons,</HI> are a proper specimen of that treatment, which <HI>scattered</HI> Christ's sheep in that day: and ever since, these sheep used their christian <HI>liberty,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> says of <HI>sincere believers,</HI>
<Q>That in these persons there resides an <HI>indefeazable right</HI> always to gather themselves into a church-state, and to administer all gospel ordinances, which all the world cannot deprive them of.</Q>

The mi∣nisters in <HI>Windham</HI> county, in their <HI>association letter</HI> against the separates say, p. 32.
<Q>Another of these false and evil principles, which some have drank in, and others are striken with, is, that <HI>no other</HI> call is necessary to a

persons undertaking to preach the gospel, but his being a true christian, and having an inward motion of the spirit, or a perswasion in his own mind, that it is the will of God he should preach and perform <HI>other ministerial acts</HI>: the necessary consequence of which is, that there is no standing instituted ministry, or order of men, peculi∣arly appointed to that work in the christian church, known and distinguished from all others, by the visible laws of Christ's kingdom. From this falshood (say they,) chiefly have sprung up so many preachers and ex∣horters who are unconvincible, and will hear no reason nor argument against their practice.</Q>
Then they pro∣ceed to a long train of arguments to prove the gospel ministry to be an institution of Christ.</P>
<P>But they might, with as much truth or propriety, have charged the separates in general, with denying the Bible, because they did not come to hearthem explain or <HI>corrupt</HI> it; and so have gone on to prove it to be the word of God: for we have all along held, that gospel ministers are
<Q>an order of men peculiarly appointed to that work in the christian church, know and distinguished from all others by the visible laws of Christ's kingdom,</Q>
as strongly as they do, who condemn us. 'Tis true we don't fix that <HI>order</HI> inac∣cademical <HI>degrees,</HI> nor in a local <HI>succession</HI>; neither do we know men to be Christ's ministers by their <HI>dress,</HI> or <HI>titles.</HI> And 'tis acknowledged that
<Q>no arguments have convin∣ced us,</Q>
as yet, that any are true ministers, because they have such a <HI>spirit of discerning</HI> as to see <HI>covetousness,</HI> in such as choose to suffer spoiling of goods or imprisonment rather than to pay what is demanded in an un-gospel way: while at the same time they can't see it in themselves, tho' they permit the widow and fatherless to be distrained upon, rather than forego any part of what they first agreed for. Yea, who can discern <HI>cevetousness</HI> in ministers abroad, who ap∣pear willing to spend and be spent for the good of souls, and make no demands, but only take what is freely given them; and yet can't discern it at home, where they can <HI>never have enough,</HI> but are often urging for additions to the sum they first bargained for. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> of <HI>Boston</HI> insinuates, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> was moved to travel and labour as he did,

<PB N="91" REF="010823_0046_0F81D497B9DACA80"/>
be beneath the dignity of these ministers, to take any notice of lay teachers writings, even tho' it be to correct their mistakes, (a notable proof of their <HI>humility</HI>!) And the chief which he advances against us before the world, is upon his word of honor. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A particular description of our sentiments concerning an <HI>internal call</HI> to preach the gospel, was published 14 years ago, and there∣in it was observed,
<Q>That holding to an <HI>internal call</HI>; no way invalidates <HI>external</HI> ordination: for, as when a soul is conver∣ted, tho' he has an <HI>internal</HI> right to all the privileges of the church of Christ, yet he has not an <HI>external</HI> right thereto, 'till he is openly received as a <HI>member</HI>: so a person that is called to preach, has not a right to act in those things which are <HI>peculiar</HI> to an <HI>officer</HI> in the church, 'till he is publickly set apart therein.</Q>
And a challenge was then made to <HI>all men</HI> to shew if they could,
<Q>That God has let it any more in the hands of any mortals, to say who shall be his <HI>ministers,</HI> and who not, than he has to say who shall be his <HI>children,</HI> and who not.</Q>
It was observed that he has given <HI>marks</HI> whereby each may be known and received into their places. Now if these principles were false, would it not have become Mr. <HI>F.</HI> much better, to have pointed out wherein they are so, than to have cast out so many things against us, which we deny? unless he could advance stronger proof therefor, than his bare word.</NOTE> I must not therefore let ano∣ther of his charges pass without notice.</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>F.</HI> is essaying to open the separates <HI>princi∣ples,</HI> he says,
<Q>Their first minister in this place (i. e. <HI>Stonington</HI>) was elected by <HI>revelation,</HI> which was after this manner. The brethren at a meeting, appointed for the purpose, having an <HI>impression,</HI> that if it was the Lord's will that they should have a minister, he would shew it to them, and <HI>reveal</HI> the <HI>man's</HI> name, or shew them <HI>the very man.</HI> Upon <HI>this,</HI> one of their number, in a vision or swoon, had a revelation, that he <HI>himself</HI> was to be their minister: but the brethren not having fellow∣ship with him in his discovery, rejected <HI>his</HI> revelation; tho' he declared to me he knew it to be from heaven. At the next meeting, and under the like <HI>impression</HI> in a trance or swoon, 'twas revealed to another brother that such a man, by name, was to be their minister; with which they had fellowship: and <HI>him</HI> they chose,—ordain'd,— silenc'd,—cast out of their church, and delivered up to satan, in <HI>less</HI> than a <HI>year.</HI> p. 145.</Q></P>
<P>As it happens, I was an eye and ear witness of the vi∣sible transactions of that meeting, (for tho' he makes it two meetings, it was but one) therefore I will give the plain state of the visible facts, leaving what is secret to others.
<PB N="92" REF="010823_0047_0F81D49869AE1AE0"/>
Mr. <HI>Matthew Smith</HI> of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> had preached upon trial, to that church, a considerable time, 'till they thought proper to appoint a meeting to seek for divine direction, and to proceed to the choice of a pastor, as they might have clearness; and there happened to be several other teachers present, one of which, when the question was asked about, what should be the <HI>method</HI> of proceeding, in choosing a pastor? Answered, that if any see it to be their lot, they should declare it. But little if any reply was made there∣to; and soon after, this man fell into a strange frame, and then made the declaration which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> speaks of: which struck a visible damp upon the assembly, as being an <HI>unex∣pected</HI> thing, and none concurred therewith. And the rest of the day was spent in worship, 'till in, or near the even∣ing, when some of the church got into a labour with one of their brethren, upon some of his moral conduct, which they judged not to be agreeable to rule: and at length he was brought to confess it, which gave as visible a quick∣ning to their minds, as the other declaration had a damp: and a leading brother in the church being much overcome, took hold of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> (who was expected before to be their minister) and told him he was the man to go before them; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here note, this has not been our common <HI>method.</HI></NOTE> and all concurred therewith: and he was ordain∣ed <HI>Dec.</HI> 10. 1746. and he ministred in word and ordinan∣ces to them, 'till the spring 1749. Then he went off and left his flock; for which, after various labours with him, he was, by the advice of a council, excommunicated on <HI>July</HI> 20. 1750. as I had the account in a letter from a member of the council soon after, which letter is now be∣fore me. Three or four years afterwards, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> re∣turned and confest his fault to the church, and they for∣gave him. The man also who made that <HI>declaration,</HI> has also seen clearly since how he was imposed upon then, as I have reason to think, from the account he gave me of it, some years ago.</P>
<P>This is the true state of those affairs, as may be proved; and I leave the reader to make his own remarks. But O <HI>New-England! New-England</HI>! whither art thou fallen! Once it could be said of thee that,
<Q>No man became a <HI>minister</HI> or <HI>communicant</HI> in thy churches, until he had been <HI>severely examined</HI> about his <HI>regeneration,</HI> as well as <HI>conversation</HI>; and if <HI>any minister</HI> did misbehave himself, he soon heard of it, and became either a <HI>penitent,</HI> or a

<P>In order to shew the dreadful tendency of separations, ministers have often mentioned, <HI>Ward's</HI> daughter that was taken from her husband, and <HI>John Smith's</HI> wife who was poisoned with <HI>rats-bane.</HI> The <HI>facts</HI> were thus; one <HI>Ward</HI> had met with the separates in <HI>Attleborough</HI> for a while, and had preached to such as would hear him; but he never was received into their church. He had one only child who did not live comfortably with her husband, and at length <HI>Ward</HI> took a <HI>fancy</HI> that she had not got the <HI>right man</HI>; and so took her away, and gave her to another: now tho' he was not a member with them, yet some of the brethren in <HI>Attleborough,</HI> went as neighbours, and labou∣red to convince him of his error; but he persi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed therein, and in the event was forced to leave his country. <HI>John Smith</HI> was a member of Mr. <HI>Pain's</HI> church in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but after a while he declared that 'twas revealed to him that such a woman was to be his wife; and when he was questioned upon it, he said he did not pretend to put away the wife he then had, but providence would take her out of the way. This appeared so dark that the church cal∣led him to account for it, and the pastor (as he told me) openly told him in the church, that this principle carried <HI>murder</HI> in its nature; but he would not hear the church, and therefore was <HI>cast out.</HI> And three or four months af∣ter, he went to an <HI>apothecary</HI> at <HI>Norwich,</HI> and bought some <HI>rats-bane</HI>; with which 'twas supposed, the woman he had a fancy for, poison'd his wife; for which they were tried at <HI>Windham</HI> court; when (as I was credibly informed) they took off such as were <HI>separates</HI> from the <HI>jury</HI>; and, to the astonishment of many were acquitted; and afterward they were married together, but lived and died miserably. This

<P>However, this is no new thing; 'tis an old stratagem of those who have the <HI>form</HI> but <HI>deny the power of godliness,</HI> from whom we are required to <HI>turn away.</HI>
<Q>But (said a great reformer in <HI>Germany</HI>) who but a mad man would charge Christ with the guilt of <HI>Judas</HI>? or blame the apostles and the godly presbyters of the church at <HI>Ephe∣sus</HI> for that <HI>out of their own selves</HI> there did men arise <HI>speaking perverse things</HI>?</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Christian History vol. 2. p. 283.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now reader thou art to judge for thy self. I have joined issue with Mr. <HI>Fish,</HI> that
<Q>the church of Christ in which his spirit dwells, has never been a <HI>bitter, fierce, revenge∣ful, persecuting</HI> church: but the reverse.</Q>
And he has exerted all his learning in an attempt to prove that the standing churches have that spirit, and that the separates have the contrary character. And he has advanced it as a principal evidence of their not having the spirit of Christ, that
<Q>They endeavoured to draw off every <HI>true Christian,</HI> and would have left a congregation behind them, of no∣thing but <HI>hypocrites</HI> and <HI>graceless persons.</HI></Q>
This is brought to prove that they had not a <HI>kind and charitable spirit.</HI> But if he had reviewed a text that stands as a <HI>mott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in his title page, which calls him to <HI>measure the pattern</HI>; and had observed that the rule given to measure the <HI>form</HI> and <HI>fashion</HI> of God's house by, with the <HI>goings out</HI> and <HI>comings in thereof,</HI> is, that, <HI>The whole limit thereof round about</HI> shall be, MOST HOLY: <HI>behold,</HI> THIS <HI>is the law of the house.</HI> Ezek. 43.10—12. And also had taken notice, that the terms given to another prophet, upon which alone he should be God's <HI>mouth,</HI> were, <HI>If thou take forth the pre∣cious from the vile.</HI> (Jer. 15.19.) And that the <HI>holy spirit</HI> expressly commands us in the new testament, to <HI>Come out and be separate from unbelievers</HI>; and to <HI>turn away from</HI> those who have the <HI>form,</HI> but <HI>deny the power of godliness.</HI> 2. Cor. 6.14—17. 2 Tim. 3.5. If he had duly observed these rules, how could he ever have charged the <HI>acting upon them,</HI> as the first evidence that those who <HI>acted so,</HI> had not the <HI>spirit</HI> that indicted them; but that they had an <HI>unmerciful</HI> spirit because they would not go with him and others in a contrary way?</P>
<P>Indeed the other text in his title page; (<HI>They are not all Israel which are of Israel,</HI>) plainly points us to the way
<PB N="95" REF="010823_0048_0F81D499541F88F8"/>
that these ministers get along in, concerning these affairs. They <HI>confound</HI> the constitution of the jewish and christian church together; and shuffle and shift from one to the other, as occasion suits: and then charge us with not <HI>distin∣guishing</HI> between the <HI>visible</HI> and <HI>invisible</HI> church. They allow that the <HI>invisible</HI> church contains none but the <HI>first-born which are written in heaven.</HI> Heb. 12.23. But they would have the <HI>visible</HI> church contain abundance more; and fly to the <HI>Jews,</HI> to <HI>parables,</HI> and to <HI>hypocrites</HI> to sup∣port their notions. Whereas the proper notion of <HI>visible,</HI> is the making <HI>manifest</HI> what was before <HI>invisible</HI>: hence says <HI>Paul, with the heart man believeth</HI>; and <HI>with the mouth confession is made.</HI> Therefore; an <HI>outward shew</HI> of what is not <HI>invisibly real,</HI> is <HI>hypocrisy.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> of <HI>Salem,</HI> complains of Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> as not distinguish∣ing between the <HI>external</HI> administration, and <HI>internal</HI> efficacy of the covenant: and he says,
<Q>A man may be in the covenant of grace, in respect of its visible administration;—and yet he may not be in the covenant of grace in regard of its spiritual dispensation and efficacy. This is the case of all <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lose hypo∣crites.</HI></Q>
And that is all the place in the covenant which I can find that he has got for unregenerate children. See his answer to <HI>Gill,</HI> p. 243.</NOTE> Thus while they accuse others with not distinguishing things, they <HI>turn things up∣side down,</HI> (Isai. 29.16.) at a sad rate.</P>
<P>The only reason why any beside regenerate souls get in∣to the visible church, is not owing to the <HI>rule,</HI> but to man's <HI>imperfection</HI> in acting upon it. Hence old Mr. <HI>Shepherd,</HI> in answer to this question:
<Q>Do not hypocrites, and no true members of Christ <HI>creep in</HI>?</Q>
says
<Q>yes: But if they <HI>could have been known</HI> to be such, they ought to be <HI>kept out</HI>; and when they <HI>are known,</HI> they are orderly to be <HI>cast out.</HI> Mat. 25.1. 2 Tim. 3.5. Rev. 2.20. Tit. 3.10.</Q>

first of passing over what Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> has said upon it, without notice; but for several reasons I have altered my mind, and concluded to make a few <HI>remarks</HI> upon that part of his book also.</P>
<P>And the first remark I shall make is, that our author takes the method which many have done before him, and tries first to <HI>inflame</HI> peoples natural <HI>passions,</HI> and then he is pretty certain to get his argument with them: for he says,
<Q>The church was always <HI>fond</HI> of her <HI>children,</HI>—And can we now, without <HI>horror,</HI> indulge the thought, either that Christ hath cast them off, of that the church is <HI>become as cruel as the Ostrich.</HI></Q>
p. 28. And having spent a whole page in such <HI>exclamations,</HI> he then tells of
<Q>fair∣ly arguing the points:</Q>
but if the first point is gained, that the baptists principles are <HI>horribly cruel,</HI> what room can be left for argument in the affair? for who will under∣take to dispute for such principles? Satan himself pre∣tends <HI>kindness</HI> and not <HI>cruelty</HI> in his inticements.</P>
<P>It is strange to see how great and good men, have been <HI>blinded</HI> by this stratagem. Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> tell us, that Mr. <HI>Elliot</HI> published an answer to Mr. <HI>Norcott</HI> on <HI>baptism,</HI> and began it with these lines, viz.
<Q>The book speaks with a voice of a <HI>lamb,</HI> and I think the author is a <HI>godly</HI> tho' erring <HI>brother</HI>; but he acts the cause of a <HI>roaring lion,</HI> who by all crafty ways, seeketh to devour the poor <HI>lambs</HI> of the flock of Christ.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Elliot's</HI> life p. 57.</NOTE> Now the <HI>lion</HI> is praised for his <HI>stately goings,</HI> but who would dare to come near, or encounter with him, unless he had <HI>David's</HI> faith? Instead of that, each one is for keeping their distance, and endea∣vouring to secure themselves and their children against the <HI>terrible</HI> beast. Even so great a champion as Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> found his courage fail in this matter. For, when Mr. <HI>Dunstar,</HI> president of <HI>Cambridge</HI> college, embraced the <HI>bap∣tist</HI> principles in 1653, and
<Q>thought himself under some obligation to bear his testimony in some sermons, against the administration of <HI>baptism</HI> to any <HI>infant</HI> whatsoever.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mitchel's</HI> life p. 67.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Mitchel,</HI> after he had been to talk with him, found that it caused him to <HI>scruple infant baptism,</HI> which he says,
<Q>Made me <HI>fearful</HI> to go needlesly to Mr. <HI>D.</HI> for me∣thought I found a <HI>venom</HI> and <HI>poison,</HI> in his insinuations and discourses against <HI>paedo-baptism.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">ibid p. 69.</NOTE> And to secure himself against so great a danger, he says,
<Q><HI>I resolved al∣so on Mr</HI> Hooker's <HI>princple,</HI> That I would have an ar∣gument, able to remove a mountaian, before I would re∣cede

from, or appear against a truth or practice, received among the faithful.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mitchel's</HI> Life p. 70.</NOTE> But how did he know that he was not <HI>resolving against the truth,</HI> and not for it? We have his reasons therefor under his own hand: when he had been to Mr. <HI>Dunster's,</HI> Dec. 24. 1653, he says, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">p. 68.69.</NOTE>
<Q>After I came from him, I had a strange experience: I sound hurrying and pressing suggestions against <HI>paedo-baptism,</HI> and injec∣ted scruples and thoughts, whether the other way might not be right, and <HI>infant baptism,</HI> an invention of men: and whether I might with good conscience baptize chil∣dren and the like. And these thoughts were darted in with some impression, and left a strange confusion and sickliness upon my spirit. Yet methought, it was not hard to discern that they were from the EVIL ONE. <HI>First,</HI> because they were rather <HI>inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed,</HI> hurrying sug∣gestions, than any deliberate thoughts, or bringing any light with them. <HI>Secondly,</HI> because they were <HI>unrea∣sonable</HI>; interrupting me in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy for the sabbath, and putting my spirit into confusion, so as I had much ado, to do ought in my sermon. It was not now a time to study that matter; but when in the former part of the week, I had given myself to that study, the more I studied it, the more clear and rational light I saw for <HI>paedo baptism,</HI> but now these suggestions hurried me into <HI>scruples.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Tho' this may have passed for good reasoning with ma∣ny; yet should a <HI>baptist</HI> minister own that he had very much <HI>scrupled,</HI> whether his way was right or not, but had concluded the <HI>scruples</HI> were from the <HI>evil one,</HI> because they were attended with <HI>confusion</HI> and <HI>darkness,</HI> rather than <HI>de∣liberation</HI> in his mind; and did not come by his own rea∣sonings, but by means of talking with a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">For Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> esteem'd and honored Mr. <HI>Dunstar</HI> as such to his dying day, p. 70.</NOTE> man, which happened not to be in the right time in the week, but too near the <HI>sabbath</HI>: and that therefore he was <HI>resolved,</HI> that he would have an <HI>argument able to remove a mountain,</HI> before he would recede from a <HI>practice</HI> which had been <HI>received as truth</HI> among his faithful fathers. Al∣so that he was <HI>fearful</HI> of going near the gentleman who had been instrumental of shaking his confidence concern∣ing that old <HI>practice.</HI> If a <HI>baptist</HI> should task so, there would be enough ready to tell him, that it was his <HI>strive∣ing</HI> again <HI>conviction,</HI> that caused such confusion and dark∣ness
<PB N="100" REF="010823_0051_0F81D3FD20581EF0"/>
in his mind; and we should heared more about the baptists being <HI>wilful</HI> in their way than we have done yet.</P>
<P>The Lord gave this reason to <HI>Israel,</HI> why they should not oppress a stranger, viz. <HI>For ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</HI> And I find the truth of that word in the present case; for I have gone thro' the same <HI>hurrying</HI> and <HI>darkness,</HI> upon this point, which Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI> describes, and thought once that I had got clear of it, in the same way; and also felt the like <HI>fear</HI> of disputing with others upon it, that he did. Neither was it any creature that stopt me at last, from go∣ing on in that way, No, but in my retired hours, this questi∣on was put to my conscience, (I believe) by him who made me,
<Q>where is it, and in what relation to the visible church do baptized infants stand, who are not <HI>regenera∣ted</HI>?</Q>
This I was not able to answer; for it was a set∣tled point with me before (as it was with Mr. <HI>Mitchel</HI>) that none but <HI>new-born</HI> souls ought to come to the <HI>Lords-Supper</HI>; and yet <HI>baptism</HI> is the first ordinance in a <HI>christian profession,</HI> and his notion of a <HI>middle way,</HI> between the church and the world, I could not justify: so that I found the <HI>mountain</HI> to be on the other side of the question; and if Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> or any others could have helped me to an <HI>argument</HI> able to <HI>remove it,</HI> I should have gladly used it, rather than to be <HI>turned about</HI> again in this affair; but tho' I sought diligently, by all means within my reach, for twelve months or more, yet I never could find such an ar∣gument. <HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>The heart knoweth its own bit∣terness</HI>: and none but they who have experienced the like, can tell what I then endured; and instead of help from my brethren, they helped to increase the burden: for one would say, It was my listning to the <HI>baptists,</HI> that caused all this difficulty: while another would be as confident that it was the <HI>fear of men</HI> that kept me from coming out in <HI>believers baptism.</HI></P>
<P>Often did I think of <HI>Job's</HI> words, <HI>Were your soul in my souls stead, I could heap words upon you.</HI> I see now that the chief thing that held my mind so long in suspence, was not distinguishing as I ought between <HI>men,</HI> and the <HI>rule itself.</HI> For when I look'd into the <HI>word,</HI> I could read be∣lievers baptism plainly, and nothing plainly of bringing in∣fants thereto; but when I turned to look among <HI>men,</HI> so many <HI>good</HI> ones would be brought up on one side, and <HI>bad</HI> ones on the other, and I saw so much of a wrong <HI>temper</HI> in my <HI>baptist</HI> brethren who had come out lately, that I said
<PB N="101" REF="010823_0051_0F81D3FD20581EF0"/>
in my heart,
<Q>I am afraid there is some <HI>secret mischief</HI> in that principle.</Q>
And I never could obtain deliverance in this matter, 'till I was brought to <HI>cease from man,</HI> so as to leave good men and bad men out of the question, and come to this single point; <HI>Nevertheless, what saith the scripture</HI>? And there I obtained as clear establishment about baptism, as any other point in religion. And what I have endured, has taught me the vast importance of the divine caution which we have, against <HI>judging the counsels of others hearts.</HI> What they say and do, we have a warrant to judge upon, and to labour to convince them where we think they are in the wrong: but to charge them with being <HI>biased</HI> by corruption, if they don't presently yield to our arguments; as it is a violation of the law of God, so no tongue can express all the mischiefs which it has made among God's people, in all ages. And this admitting <HI>men</HI> for part of our <HI>rule,</HI> is the grand source of all the <HI>abominations in the earth.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The first part of the <HI>Popes creed</HI> is the same with <HI>protestants,</HI> and the first step he takes off from truth is, admitting the authority of <HI>apostolical tradition</HI>: and the next article is in these words, viz.

<Q>That more of light and less heat would be better,</Q>
for he esteemed his <HI>tutor</HI> to be a "<HI>worthy</HI> and a <HI>godly</HI> man." p. 68. Had Mr. <HI>Dun∣star</HI> fallen into any <HI>scandal</HI> afterward, is it not as likely we should have often heard of him, as we have of other <HI>scan∣dalous baptists</HI>? But since it was otherwise, ministers have been so cautious of speaking of these things, that I suppose

thousands, who have used his <HI>version</HI> of the <HI>psalms</HI> in their worship, never heard nor thought that the principal man, who composed them, openly renounced <HI>infant baptism</HI> soon after; tho' they have often heard the <HI>mad-men</HI> of <HI>Munster,</HI> cast as a reproach upon those who have no more concern with them, than their accusers have with the <HI>buil∣ders of Babel.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> proceeds with the like <HI>caution,</HI> when he has occasion to mention the president who succeeded Mr <HI>Dun∣star,</HI> in order to shew what regard the ancient church in <HI>Plymouth</HI> had for <HI>learning,</HI> he brings in
<Q>The great pains they took to obtain the learned and eminent Mr. <HI>Charles Chauncy</HI> (afterwards president of <HI>Cambridge</HI> college) of whose settlement with them, they were disappointed.</Q>
p. 82. But he never gives the least hint, that the only rea∣son given, for his not settling there, (in the account he takes this out of) is, that he held <HI>baptism</HI>
<Q>ought <HI>only</HI> to be <HI>by dipping or plunging the whole body under water,</HI></Q>
which appeared so necessary to Mr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> that
<Q>he did not see light</Q>
to settle in a church where another prac∣ticed <HI>sprinkling,</HI> tho' he had liberty to act according to his own mind. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Appendix to <HI>Robbins's</HI> sermon p. 5, 6.</NOTE> This account of what was acted but 8 years after <HI>Boston</HI> was settled, would not answer, for one who was laboring to prove, that the holding <HI>dipping</HI> to be ne∣cessary in baptism, was a <HI>new</HI> notion of some <HI>ignorant, rigid</HI> people. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f this be a fair use of <HI>learning,</HI> which he talks so much of, what can be unfair?</P>
<P>This reminds me of another of Mr. <HI>F's</HI> exclamations; after he has spoken so much of the separates and baptists, he says,
<Q>What then is like to become of the <HI>cause</HI> that brought our pious fore-fathers into this land?</Q>
p. 182. Answer, the <HI>cause</HI> they came here for, was a <HI>reformation according to the word of God,</HI> and the first churches, both of <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Boston,</HI> expressly <HI>covenanted</HI> before God to embrace <HI>further light from his word,</HI> as it should be opened to them; and governor <HI>Winslow</HI> tells us, that Mr. <HI>Robinson,</HI> pastor of the <HI>Plymouth people,</HI>
<Q>charged them before God and his blessed angels,</Q>
to act according to their <HI>cove∣nant</HI>;
<Q>for he was very confident, the Lord had more truth and light yet, to break forth out of his <HI>holy</HI> word.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">New-England chronology, p. 89.90.</NOTE>
What an injury then is done to their character, as well as to our own souls, if we <HI>limit</HI> things to what they had <HI>at∣tained,</HI> as if they did not mean to act as they said?</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="010823_0052_0F81D3FD31715D28"/>Many ministers in our country will tell people that a strong confidence that their souls are in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, is hurtful; and that they must think that, <HI>possibly</HI> they are <HI>not right,</HI> in order to <HI>examine</HI> themselves: but in this case, all art must be used to prevent any <HI>scruples</HI> concerning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣fant baptism, before they <HI>examine</HI> it; so that they may not look into the bible, to see whether this principle is right or not, but only to find something to prove it to be right, and to fortify them against the <HI>horrible errors</HI> of the bap∣tists. And if any are <HI>resolved</HI> still to go on in that way, I leave them with Him who is able to convince them of the evil of such conduct: b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if any are desirous to hear <HI>fur∣ther of this matter,</HI> I would give them a few more of my thoughts upon our author's manner of handling the scrip∣tures, in this controversy.</P>
<P>He allows the <HI>baptists</HI> a place among the <HI>churches of Christ,</HI> and that they have
<Q>doubtless a number of godly persons among them,</Q>
but says,
<Q>We <HI>must think</HI> they are in a grievous error, as to the matter in dispute between <HI>them</HI> and <HI>us.</HI></Q>
p. 96. And he directly repairs to the <HI>promise</HI> in Acts 2.39. where he would have us take notice that, "'tis not said that the promise <HI>shall</HI> be to your children: but the promise is to your children," so it is, and <HI>as many</HI> as heard the <HI>call, and gladly received the promise, were baptized, and the same day were added to the church, even such as should be saved.</HI> And there is not a word of the <HI>baptizing any</HI> but <HI>such,</HI> in the whole context. Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> says this would put believers children upon
<Q>a <HI>level</HI> with the <HI>heathen,</HI> who also shall be interested in the promise, upon <HI>their</HI> believing.</Q>
p. 97. And will he pretend that any are interested in the promise of <HI>remission of sins</HI> and the <HI>gift of the holy Ghost,</HI> beside true <HI>believers</HI>? He says this is the promise made to <HI>Abraham</HI>: let it be so. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that Christ was made a <HI>curse for us,</HI> that the <HI>blessing of Abraham</HI> might come on the gentiles, <HI>through Jesus Christ</HI>; that we might <HI>receive the promise of the spi∣rit thro' faith.</HI> The <HI>blessing</HI> comes <HI>thro' Christ,</HI> and is <HI>re∣ceived</HI> only <HI>by faith.</HI> A few verses forward <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>The scripture hath concluded</HI> ALL <HI>under sin, that the pro∣mise might be given to them that believe</HI>: and concludes the chapter with saying, IF <HI>ye be Christ's,</HI> THEN <HI>are ye Abra∣ham's seed, and heirs</HI> ACCORDING <HI>to</HI> THE PROMISE. Gal. 3, 13, 14, 22, 29. <HI>The promise,</HI> is of the <HI>gift of righteous∣ness,</HI> and <HI>abundance of grace,</HI> which is only <HI>received by faith</HI>; how vain then are all the pretences, that <HI>any</HI> are <HI>heirs of
<PB N="104" REF="010823_0053_0F81D3FE059F06A0"/>
promise,</HI> but <HI>believers</HI>? The complaint against setting all men upon a <HI>level,</HI> in their natural state, is as old as <HI>christi∣anity</HI> itself: for the very work of the <HI>messenger</HI> who came before Christ's face, was to <HI>level</HI> all outward distinctions in the world; and nothing was more offensive to the <HI>Jews</HI> than the freedom which our Lord discovered towards <HI>pub∣licans and sinners</HI>; and the <HI>Jews</HI> conceit that they had a better claim to <HI>the promise,</HI> than <HI>such persons,</HI> was the grand obsticle in the way of their <HI>believing in Jesus</HI>; and so was the <HI>bar</HI> that shut them out of the <HI>kingdom of heaven.</HI> And what less than this are those doing, who conceit that <HI>na∣tural birth,</HI> or any thing <HI>done by creatures,</HI> gives <HI>them</HI> or <HI>theirs</HI> any better claim to that <HI>kingdom</HI> than <HI>other sinners? Paul</HI> was taught the pernicious effects of that <HI>conceit,</HI> and therefore engaged against it with all his might, and pro∣ved to the <HI>Romans,</HI> that both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> were <HI>all under sin:</HI> to the <HI>Ephesians</HI> that, <HI>We</HI> ALL <HI>were by nature the children of wrath,</HI> EVEN <HI>as others</HI>; and to the <HI>Galati∣ans,</HI> (as was just observed) that <HI>all</HI> were <HI>concluded under sin, that the promise might be given to them that believe.</HI> And the very occasion of his laboring as he did with the <HI>Galatians</HI> was because of some who <HI>desired to make a fair shew in the flesh,</HI> by introducing the <HI>national</HI> plan under the <HI>christian</HI> name: but tho' <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were <HI>car∣ried away</HI> at first with this scheme; yet he <HI>withstood them to the face,</HI> and shewed them that this was <HI>building again the things which once they destroyed</HI>; which <HI>things</HI> he express∣ly points out to be the <HI>difference</HI> between <HI>Jews by nature, and sinners of the Gentiles.</HI> Gal. 2.15.</P>
<P>What then shall we think of Mr. <HI>Fish,</HI> who declares that the promise
<Q>remains in full force to your children, upon <HI>your</HI> becoming <HI>christians, as</HI> it did while <HI>Jews</HI>?</Q>
And again that the <HI>gospel charter,</HI>
<Q><HI>secures</HI> the <HI>blessings</HI> of the covenant to children, in the <HI>same breath</HI> that it does <HI>to the parents.</HI></Q>
p. 31.100. If this is not <HI>build∣ing</HI> the <HI>middle wall of partition</HI> between the <HI>children of professors,</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> I desire to know what is. That <HI>wall</HI> which Christ has <HI>broken down,</HI> (Eph. 2.14.) and his apostles <HI>destroyed</HI> it; yet men have got to building it again. And we are told, that 'tis for very good ends too; one of which is to keep children under
<Q>the faithful authorative watch and discipline of the church.</Q>
p. 99. These are fine <HI>words</HI>; but what is there in it, in our day more than empty words? They tell us of some <HI>actings</HI> of this nature in for∣mer times, but now they are only great <HI>swelling words.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="010823_0053_0F81D3FE059F06A0"/>But should they attempt to bring them into <HI>action</HI> now, Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> owns in the same page that,

<Q>What is like to become of the <HI>cause</HI> that brought our pious fore fathers into this land?</Q></P>
<P>In order to shew the dreadful effects of our principles, Mr. F. says, we not only deprive our children of the chur∣ches watch, but implicitly bid them to <HI>go and serve other gods.</HI> This he says is the consequence, "If I am not out in my reasoning. p. 99. A caveat well put in; for it would make many suspect him to be out of his <HI>reason,</HI> as well as out in his <HI>reasoning,</HI> to suppose that, the not treating per∣sons <HI>as</HI> Christ's servants 'till they gave evidence of their <HI>being</HI> such, implied a <HI>bidding</HI> them <HI>serve other gods.</HI>
<Q>Again (says he) by denying their children the <HI>covenant</HI> and <HI>seal,</HI> they do <HI>eventually</HI> deprive them of the <HI>bible.</HI>— of a <HI>preached gospel,</HI> and <HI>all appointed</HI> means of grace:</Q>

<Q>Upon the whole, may it not be said, of their church, that it is like a flock without <HI>lambs,</HI> a vineyard without <HI>seed,</HI> an or∣chard without a nursery? &amp;c. p. 100.</Q></P>
<P>I would answer these queries by putting others. Does <HI>learning</HI> consist in <HI>words</HI> or in ideas? And does not every <HI>husbandman</HI> know, that <HI>lambs</HI> will become <HI>sheep,</HI> and a nur∣sury, <HI>appletrees</HI> without any other <HI>change</HI> but <HI>natural</HI> growth? and do persons become Christ's <HI>sheep</HI> in such a way? He said to a ruler of the <HI>Jews,</HI> That which is <HI>born of the flesh, is flesh</HI>: marvel not that I said unto thee, <HI>ye must be born again.</HI> And have we <HI>masters</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> that don't <HI>know these things</HI>? As to the bible and other means for conversion, who will say that children may not attend those means as well <HI>without</HI> sprinkling as <HI>with</HI>? And <HI>Paul</HI> assures us, that the <HI>chief advantage</HI> of the cir∣cumcised children lay therein; and none but such might enjoy those means, in the national church.

<P>Many, in order to make out some singular advantage to baptized infants, will reach forward to another world, and say that if they die in infancy they have good hope for them, but for others they have none; unless it be from the <HI>uncovenanted mercy</HI> of God. I wish they would explain what they mean: if they mean his <HI>sovereign mercy,</HI> I con∣fess all my hopes for my self, as well as children are deri∣ved from thence. To suppose that the <HI>work done,</HI> upon the child, <HI>conveys grace,</HI> is <HI>naked popery,</HI> and to pretend to tell of a difference in their future state, as the <HI>certain</HI> con∣sequence of any <HI>outward</HI> performance of creatures, is not <HI>two pence</HI> better. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have a book intitled
<Q>The baptism of infants a reasonable service, founded upon scripture, and undoubted <HI>apostolic tradi∣tion</HI>;</Q>
which was first printed in <HI>London,</HI> and has been lately reprinted in <HI>Boston,</HI> which many of our ministers have been fond of. The author of that piece, gives it as his mind, that all who die in infancy will have a state of <HI>probation</HI> in another world, and that those who are baptized will have a <HI>better</HI> state for trial than others. Here is a <HI>sacrament</HI> among protestants <HI>founded</HI> partly on <HI>tradition,</HI> and <HI>a state</HI> is told of in the other world between <HI>hell</HI> and a fixed state of happiness in <HI>heaven,</HI> where infants are to have advantage by what ministers do here.

And
<Q>is not family prayer sadly neglected among the bap∣tists? and are they not commonly defective in their re∣ligious observation of the <HI>Lord's-day</HI>?</Q>
p. 101.</P>
<P>Answer, It is to be lamented that these evils too much prevail in all parts of the land, among all denominations; but I have reason to think there is a considerable reforma∣tion, on these accounts, among the baptists lately. O may there be much more! A few considerations on <HI>family pray∣er,</HI> which I thought duty to publish two years ago, were at their desire printed a <HI>Newport,</HI> and have been kindly received in that <HI>colony</HI>; for which I am bound to give thanks to God. And I hope my fathers and brethren, will yet be more engaged by an agreeable walk, to cut off oc∣casion from them who desire occasion, and give evidence to all, that believers baptism has no natural tendency to make people neglect the duties of private or public religion: The joining of these evils with the very name of a <HI>baptist,</HI> has long been an engine to guard peoples minds against looking into their true sentiments; whereas there is no more natural relation between those evils, and our princi∣ple about <HI>baptism,</HI> than there is between true <HI>learning</HI> and a <HI>haughty persecuting</HI> behaviour, which have often been put together on the other hand. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The sentiments of our <HI>baptist</HI> brethren in <HI>England,</HI> who have had long experience in these things, as they were published in a <HI>letter of advice</HI> to their brethern, from an assembly of 15 churches, met at <HI>Burton</HI> in <HI>Glocestershire</HI> Aug. 16. 1765, I will give a little extract from.—
<Q>Take care of stretching your family wor∣ship to an unreasonable length, or performing it unseasonably: let it not be defer'd too late in the morning, lest your hearts should be engaged in the hurries of business, and entangled in the cares of the world; nor put it off till the last thing in the evening, lest you should be overcome with drowsiness, and thus yawn out a prayer, instead of groaning out one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Be strict in observing the weekly day of rest, and not content∣ed with attending upon public worship, let it be the sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings: Keep your children and ser∣vants much under your eye: insist upon their remembering something of what they have heard: put them upon reading the scriptures; what is above their capacities explain to them, and close the day with recommending them to God.</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>Upon a close view, I am fully convinced that our fathers were greatly mistaken in this matter, and the effects plainly evidence it; for, 1. How often can we hear these children of the church making remarks on the loose walk of pro∣fessors,
<PB N="108" REF="010823_0055_0F81D3FF6E4830B8"/>
but if they are turned to their own walk, they are ready to reply, <HI>I am no professor</HI>; plainly supposing that their <HI>obligation</HI> to regard divine rule, depends on their <HI>own act</HI>; for they naturally imagine that they have as good a right to act for themselves <HI>now,</HI> as their parents had to act for them in <HI>infancy. Paul,</HI> when speaking to <HI>heathens,</HI> re∣minded them that we are the <HI>offspring of God,</HI> and there∣fore are under <HI>indispensible obligations</HI> to <HI>seek him,</HI> and act as <HI>depend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt</HI> creatures on <HI>him in</HI> whom <HI>we live,</HI> and <HI>move, and have our being.</HI> Act. 17 — 27.29. And he urges on <HI>christians,</HI> the importance of giving <HI>more earnest heed,</HI> to the things revea∣led in the gospel, from the consideration of the <HI>greatness</HI> of the things in themselves; the <HI>evidence</HI> they come with; the <HI>im∣portance</HI> of them to us, and the <HI>account</HI> we must give for them, or for our <HI>neglect</HI> of them. Heb. 2.1 — 3. These are striking considerations indeed: but to fix the <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gation</HI> upon an <HI>act</HI> that is never expressed in the whole bible, has rather a tendency to guard against conviction, than to cause a true sense of duty; especially if we observe, 2. That when people have a few <HI>outside</HI> things, they are apt to think that they are, either <HI>safe,</HI> or in a <HI>fair way</HI> for it: which is exactly the founda∣tion error of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who were <HI>blind,</HI> because they did not FIRST cleanse that which is <HI>within,</HI> that the <HI>outside</HI> might be <HI>clean also.</HI> Matt: 23.26 Many have seen the dan∣ger of this, who at the same time did not see how their principles would lead to it. Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> after a long discourse upon <HI>renewing covenant,</HI> in the year 1680. wherein were included <HI>parents</HI> and their <HI>children,</HI> yet says,
<Q>To conside in these <HI>outward</HI> enjoyments, as if they were <HI>real</HI> assurances of God's complacency, is not <HI>saith</HI> but <HI>presumption</HI>: —And yet, says he, what more common then for the children of men thus to <HI>delude</HI> themselves with such opinions? To trust in church privileges, as it is the <HI>most dangerous,</HI> so it is the <HI>most common</HI> mischief and misery of a people in visible covenant: God calls it, <HI>to trust in lying words,</HI> Jer. 74. And it was a ground of the <HI>Jews</HI> ruin.</Q>
p. 63, 64. What then are men doing, who would labour to get persons into the church, before they have any proper evidence that they have <HI>first trusted in Christ</HI>!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> appears a little more cautious of asserting things against the baptist, than against separates. He says,
<Q>Let me be corrected, if I charge them wrongfully. Is not a <HI>learned, able ministry,</HI> too lightly set by, and very rarely to be found, among those churches?</Q>
p. 101.
<PB N="109" REF="010823_0055_0F81D3FF6E4830B8"/>
Answer, several who have formerly sent their sons to col∣lege, have been disappointed, as the clergy have found means to draw them over to their party; which has dis∣couraged others from sending their sons. And the baptists in general have been so much abused, by those who boast of their <HI>learning,</HI> that 'tis not strange if many were preju∣diced against such men; yet they have had some that the world calls learned men, from the beginning; and lately have begun a <HI>college</HI> of their own, which bids fair to in∣crease; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>charter</HI> for it was granted in <HI>February</HI> 1764, by the gene∣ral court of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> colony: and Mr. <HI>James Manning</HI> of <HI>Warren,</HI> is now president thereof.</NOTE> but I hope they may never imagine to confine Christ or his church, to that, or any other human school, for ministers.</P>
<P>In order to shew how poorly furnished our churches are with <HI>teachers,</HI> Mr. <HI>F.</HI> tells a story of his conversing with one of them, who held that those words, <HI>Drink ye all of it,</HI> proved that they must eat and drink <HI>up all</HI> the elements, that are set apart for the <HI>Lord's-supper</HI>: and represents it as the <HI>common practice</HI> among our churches. p. 101. In answer to this. I can tell him truly, that I have been ac∣quainted with a great part of the <HI>baptist</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> these 18 years, from <HI>Connecticut</HI> river to <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> and I never heard of such a <HI>practice</HI> among <HI>any</HI> of them, 'till I heard it from his book: therefore I leave him to instruct or correct his acquaintance, but I would have him get more <HI>learning,</HI> before he attempts again to reproach those he don't know.</P>
<P>Having given such an account of the baptist, he con∣cludes, that many <HI>good things</HI> are <HI>lost,</HI> and no good thing gained by going over to them, unless theirs is the <HI>only scrip∣tural mode.</HI> Upon this he says,
<Q>Let us <HI>impartially</HI> ex∣amine the scripture.</Q>
p. 102. And he goes on to exa∣mine the text, that speaks of our Lord's going <HI>out of the water,</HI> so <HI>impartially,</HI> that he says,
<Q>This text affords not the <HI>least shadow</HI> of proof for <HI>plunging.</HI></Q>
p. 105. This conclusion he draws from Mat. 4.25. and Luke 2.4. where the word <HI>apo,</HI> is translated, <HI>from</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from whence he concludes that the other text means no more than <HI>from</HI> the water. Now let us not jest with scripture, but we'll suppose a <HI>critick,</HI> like our author, had been at <HI>New-London</HI> when he came there to get his book printed, and had asked, whence it came? and he had replied, <HI>From</HI> Stonington. Then, says the <HI>critick,</HI> you have not been
<PB N="110" REF="010823_0056_0F81D40034246F38"/>
<HI>into</HI> the town. Yes, says he I came <HI>from</HI> my own house in the further part of the town. What lodgings, then, (says the other) have you <HI>by</HI> your house? for I perceive you did not come <HI>out of</HI> it, but only <HI>from</HI> it?</P>
<P>If this be the learning which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> speaks so much of, he is welcome to it all: yet after he has spent eight pages in this <HI>impartial</HI> examination, (wherein he says,
<Q>We choose the mode of <HI>sprinkling</HI> or <HI>washing</HI> as most de∣cent,</Q>
p. 110) he concludes that he has
<Q>made it appear, <HI>beyond contradiction,</HI> that <HI>plunging</HI> in baptism, is no ways <HI>essential</HI>:</Q>
and says they are,
<Q><HI>fairly</HI> licen∣ced,—even by those very texts (as they stand in the ori∣ginal) upon which they rely.</Q>
p. 111.</P>
<P>I confess it might seem ill manners, to proceed in a dis∣pute, after a person is <HI>fairly silenced</HI>; yet I remember they used to allow the <HI>Indians</HI> to ask questions, after they had been preaching to them: I shall therefore take that liberty.</P>
<P>And <HI>first,</HI> I would ask this teacher how he came to act as he says we <HI>learned enemies,</HI> who <HI>make havock of the church,</HI> do? whose language according to his own account, p. 176, is,
<Q>You don't rightly understand your bible: 'tis <HI>thus</HI> and <HI>so</HI> in the <HI>original</HI>; the meaning of <HI>this</HI> and <HI>that</HI> text, is not as you take it; but just the reverse, or very different.</Q>
He asks whether we must not run back to the <HI>standing churches</HI> for help in such a case? I believe not; but I will tell him what I have once done. When the ministers of <HI>Norwich</HI> and one from <HI>Preston,</HI> joined and made some <HI>ad∣ditions</HI> to Mr. <HI>Dickinson's dialogue,</HI> and got it reprinted, I sent one of them to Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> who had answered the dia∣logue before; but when he observed that they have added in page 5, that "St. <HI>Irenaus,</HI> who lived about 14 years af∣ter Christ; —says in his epistle ad Rom. lib. 5.
<Q>The church received a tradition from the apostles, to admi∣nister baptism to little children or infants.</Q>
The doctor ordered an advertisement to be inserted at the end of one of his books, wherein, after mentioning this passage, he
<Q><HI>char∣ges</HI> it as a <HI>forgery,</HI> there being <HI>no such passage</HI> in all the works of <HI>Irenaeus</HI>; and Dr. <HI>Gill</HI> defies the above gen∣tleman, and the whole literary world to produce or point out, <HI>any</HI> such passage in <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> or <HI>any</HI> book or chap∣ter of his, of such a title, in which this pretended pas∣sage is said to be.</Q>
And with this, he sent me another book, wherein he declares to the world, that all the <HI>Greek Lexicons</HI> which he ever saw make the primary sense of the word <HI>baptize,</HI> to be to <HI>dip</HI>; and to <HI>wash</HI> by consequence:
<PB N="111" REF="010823_0056_0F81D40034246F38"/>
but that it never means to <HI>pour</HI> or <HI>sprinkle</HI>; and if there are any <HI>lexicons</HI> which give a different sense of the word, he desires they may be pointed out.</P>
<P>A <HI>second</HI> question I would ask is, how our author and his brethren came to depart in this case, from the general rule, of <HI>interpreting obscure</HI> places by those which are plain? It is well known that the meaning of words is most plain, where they are used in their <HI>literal</HI> sense, and commonly, but part of their meaning is refer'd to, when used in a <HI>figurative</HI> way. As for instance, the metaphor of a <HI>thief,</HI> and of an <HI>unjust judge</HI> is refer'd to by our Lord, to shew the <HI>suddenness</HI> of his coming, and the <HI>prevalence</HI> of <HI>impor∣tunity</HI>: but what blasphemer will dare to apply the whole meaning of those words either to the Father or to the Son? yet in the case before us, all arts are used to <HI>darken</HI> texts which speak of <HI>baptism</HI> in the <HI>literal</HI> sense, and then we are turned to places where the word is used in a <HI>figurative</HI> way, in order to decide its true meaning. The <HI>overwhelming</HI> sorrow of Christ; and his disciples being <HI>filled</HI> with the ho∣ly Ghost, are called <HI>baptisms</HI>; and Mr. <HI>F.</HI> would point us only to the <HI>way</HI> or <HI>manner</HI> of its <HI>coming,</HI> and not to their being <HI>filled</HI> or <HI>overwhelmed</HI> therein, and then says,
<Q>There was <HI>nothing</HI> in either of those <HI>baptisms,</HI> that so much as <HI>look'd like dipping.</HI></Q>
p. 107. What! <HI>nothing like it</HI>! when in a plain prophecy of Christ, 'tis said, <HI>The waters are come in unto my soul;— I am come into deep waters, where the floods</HI> OVERFLOW <HI>me,</HI> Psalm 69.1, 2. Thus he denies what <HI>is</HI> in the bible; but at other times would have us read what never <HI>was</HI> there: for in the same page he refers us to Mr. <HI>Dickinson's</HI> dialogue, who in speaking of <HI>Israel's</HI> being <HI>baptized</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> leaves out all the circum∣stances of their going <HI>into,</HI> and coming <HI>out of,</HI> the sea, and having the waters on <HI>each hand,</HI> and the cloud <HI>over them</HI>: I say, he leaves all these out, and then tells us of
<Q>rain from the cloud,</Q>
which the bible speaks nothing of. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s these men who are so much confin'd to what <HI>they</HI> have <HI>written,</HI> in their teaching, can <HI>read</HI> to the people what <HI>God</HI> never <HI>wrote</HI> in his word!</P>
<P>My <HI>third</HI> question is this; Can they find one instance that God ever instituted an ordinance without shewing the <HI>manner</HI> how it should be perform'd? will they say that Christ appointed the <HI>matter</HI> of the ordinance of the supper to be bread and wine, but left the church to <HI>decree rites and ceremonies</HI> concerning the <HI>manner</HI> of its performance? The initiation ordinance of the jewish church was a <HI>bloody</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="010823_0057_0F81D400EA541EE0"/>
sign, and the learned tell us that it took its name from the <HI>manner</HI> of its performance, as the word <HI>circumcision</HI> signi∣fies "to cut all round." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cruden's Concordance at the word circumci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Now if any had taken a fancy then, that the substance of the ordinance was its being a <HI>bloody</HI> sign, and that the <HI>mode</HI> was no great matter; and thereupon had attempted to administer it by <HI>pricking</HI> instead of <HI>cutting,</HI> or by cutting <HI>across</HI> instead of cutting <HI>all round,</HI> would that have been <HI>circumcision</HI>? I presume none will say it would. Neither (I believe) will they pretend, that cutting any other part of the body would have done beside the <HI>foreskin.</HI> And who will venture to contradict the bi∣ble, and say, Jesus was <HI>less faithful</HI> than <HI>Moses,</HI> in appoint∣ing the orders of his house? Heb. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 6.</P>
<P>And let me ask those who hold that if <HI>water</HI> is used in the sacred name 'tis baptism, tho' it be done by <HI>sprinkling</HI> or <HI>pouring,</HI> whether they think <HI>Paul</HI> understood what he said when he calls baptism a <HI>burial</HI>? Rom. 6.4, 5. In∣deed Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> says,
<Q>It is most evident that this text has no reference at all to,—any particular <HI>mode</HI> of ad∣ministring that ordinance, but the plain manifest scope of the words, is to shew us our <HI>obligation</HI> by <HI>baptism,</HI> unto a conformity to the death and resurrection of Christ, by <HI>dying unto sin,</HI> and <HI>rising again unto newness of life.</HI></Q>
Answer, 'tis readily granted that this is his scope; but do they suppose that learned <HI>Paul</HI> had such a scope with him as to use <HI>words</HI> without any reference to their true <HI>mean∣ing</HI>? Common people know, that when they <HI>bury</HI> a man they never expect to see him return to his <HI>old way of living</HI> again; and that when they <HI>plant</HI> corn they expect its next appearance will be by a <HI>new growth</HI>: and how stricking from hence is the argument to engage <HI>baptized</HI> believers to walk in <HI>newness of life</HI>? But now, forsooth, <HI>Paul</HI> must be thought to apply the words <HI>buried</HI> and <HI>planted</HI> to bap∣tism, when <HI>sprinkled</HI> and <HI>washed,</HI> would have done as well or better! such advances have men made in <HI>learning</HI> since <HI>Paul's</HI> day!</P>
<P>Before we leave this point, I would ask these learned gen∣tlemen how they came to know which <HI>part</HI> of the body they should apply water to? Circumcision was in a <HI>secret part,</HI> and they often tell us that baptism comes in its room. If <HI>washing</HI> be baptism, Jesus <HI>washed</HI> his disciples <HI>feet,</HI> but I don't read that he washed their <HI>face</HI>: how then did they come to know that <HI>sprinkling</HI> the <HI>face</HI> was baptism?</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="010823_0057_0F81D400EA541EE0"/>However I must stand no longer here, for Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says, to be <HI>consistent,</HI> we must
<Q>unchurch all the <HI>christian world</HI> except <HI>ourselves</HI>; yet, says he, as our religion does not oblige us, so we are not disposed to treat <HI>them</HI> with like severity.</Q>
p. 96. Here then, if we will take his word for it, he and his brethren have much more <HI>charity</HI> than the poor <HI>rigid</HI> baptists: but as this has long been an engine to keep people in darkness, I shall, as help may be offered, freely and distinctly give my thoughts upon it.</P>
<P N="1">1. What do men mean by <HI>unchurching</HI> others? <HI>Paul</HI> would have <HI>every man fully persuaded in his own mind</HI>; and act accordingly, so as not to <HI>condemn himself in that thing which he alloweth.</HI> And he shews, that he which <HI>doubteth</HI> whether a thing be right or not, and yet does it, is <HI>damned</HI> or <HI>condemned</HI> therefor. Rom. 14.5, 22, 23. Yet modern <HI>charity</HI> will <HI>condemn</HI> all who dare to think and act contrary to the established religion. Every soul that ventures to see with its own eyes; so far as they discover and act upon truth, they like <HI>Noah</HI> do therein condemn all the world who act contrary thereto; which renews the old complaint, <HI>Thou reproachest us also.</HI> And what then? Mr. <HI>F.</HI> con∣demns us as much as we do him. No, says he, we are not <HI>obliged</HI> nor <HI>disposed</HI> to treat them with like <HI>severity:</HI> but if we read on, we shall find he has told the world that he has proved <HI>beyond contradiction</HI> that we are wrong, and has <HI>fairly silenced</HI> us, and therefore has warned all not to hear us any more: and what separate or baptist in <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> has done more or so much as this towards unchurch∣ing any other sect whatsoever?</P>
<P>Will he admit any into his community without he thinks they are baptized; or without they will conform to the <HI>orders</HI> of his church? I believe not. And if we have not the same liberty, where is liberty of conscience gone? If he thinks our consciences are erroneous; we are as fully persuaded his is so; and we are labouring to convince each other: and does not he unchurch us, as much as we do hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? Indeed he gives it in his preface, as a great reason of his writing, that <HI>two thirds</HI> of his people have left him: but that only proves we have been more successful than he has: and does that excite his envy? All unscriptural <HI>me∣thods</HI> to gain a <HI>party</HI> ought to be exposed and condemned; that is what each side have taken their turns to labor up∣on: and has not one as good a right to do so as another? Those who <HI>creep into houses,</HI> and <HI>resist the truth,</HI> God says, <HI>Their fol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all be manifest unto all men.</HI> So that they
<PB N="114" REF="010823_0058_0F81D403BB0884B0"/>
who are upon the truth, have vastly the advantage of those who resist it, and need not fear a being unchurched by them. And is not our author somewhat <HI>inconsistent</HI> with himself, while he is telling what we must do to be <HI>consistent</HI>? for he tells abundance of what <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>ignorant</HI> teachers we have; and yet anon they are so <HI>crafty</HI> that he durst not venture his people to go near them, lest they should be <HI>deceived</HI> by them. Therefore, 2. Does not the core of all this difficulty lie in this, that common people claim as good a right to judge and act for themselves in matters of religion, as civil rulers or the learned clergy? It has a <HI>shew</HI> both of <HI>wisdom</HI> and <HI>humility</HI> to appoint those who know more than we do, to judge and act for us; and it has more than a shew of them, often to do so in temporal things: but in religion it is a most dangerous snare. Fathers have a right to see and act for their children in many cases; but in this matter Jesus says, <HI>call</HI> NO <HI>man your father upon the earth.</HI> Mat. 23.9. And <HI>Paul</HI> spends a whole chapter in labours to expose and guard against this very snare. Col. 2. He speaks highly of the <HI>order</HI> of that church, and of the <HI>stedfastness</HI> of their <HI>faith in Christ,</HI> and exhorts them to <HI>walk in him</HI> AS they <HI>received him.</HI> And all saints know that when they received Christ, they had no creature to see for them, but each soul acted as singly towards God, as if there had not been another person in the world: well says the apostle, <HI>So walk in him: rooted and built up in him, and sta∣blished in the faith,</HI> AS YE <HI>have been taught, abounding there∣in with thanksgiving. Beware lest any man spoil you thro' philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ: for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the God-head bodily: and ye are</HI> COMPLETE <HI>in him, which is the</HI> HEAD <HI>of all principality and power.</HI> Now if each saint is <HI>complete</HI> in him which is the <HI>Head</HI> of all <HI>wisdom</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> then they have no need of <HI>philosophers</HI> to see for them, nor of <HI>princes</HI> to give them <HI>power</HI> to act for God: but they freely <HI>confess</HI> with their <HI>mouths,</HI> what they <HI>believe</HI> in their <HI>hearts,</HI> and so their <HI>hearts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re comforted, being knit together in love,</HI> and are <HI>built up to∣gether,</HI> as <HI>they have been taught.</HI> And as those saints had received the substance of what was shadowed forth in <HI>cir∣cumcision,</HI> and had declared in their <HI>baptism,</HI> that they were <HI>dead</HI> to the <HI>body of sin,</HI> and to the worship of the <HI>worldly sanctuary</HI>; the apostle says, Wherefore if ye be <HI>dead with Christ,</HI> from the <HI>rudiments of the world</HI>; why as tho' <HI>living in the world</HI> are ye subject to ordinances,—a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>com∣mandments

and doctrines of men</HI>: which things indeed have a <HI>shew of wisdom and humility.</HI></P>
<P>Now as this warning was openly given, it would not do for men to act against it in plain terms; yet those who were <HI>vainly pust up by their fleshly minds,</HI> conceited that the ordinances which Jesus had instituted after he had <HI>blot∣ted out</HI> the old <HI>hand writing,</HI> were too few and plain, and the worship too spiritual to consist with that great maxim, That christian privileges are greater than jewish privileges were; therefore their <HI>philosophy</HI> was set to work upon the <HI>deceitful</HI> line of making jewish ordinances, <HI>shadows</HI> of christian ordinances, instead of owning them to be <HI>shadows</HI> of <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>inward realities</HI>: and so making <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <HI>houshold</HI> which first constituted that church, a <HI>shadow</HI> of christians <HI>natural</HI> offspring, instead of viewing it to be a <HI>shadow</HI> of the <HI>houshold of God,</HI> which constitutes the gospel church. Eph. 2.19, 20. And having by this art got the <HI>relicks</HI> of that old covenant which Jesus had <HI>blotted out</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed to his cross,</HI> it hath made room for the exertion of all their learning to write upon it, and contend about it ever since. Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> says,
<Q>The patent sealed by <HI>baptism</HI> is (so to speak) the very same parchment that was given to <HI>Abraham</HI>;—there is nothing altered, but the seal on∣ly.</Q>
<HI>Dialogue,</HI> p. 17. And Mr. <HI>F.</HI> plainly holds things in the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> line; and therein, he and his brethren appear to be in a fair way to bring that upon themselves which they would charge upon us. For on the same <HI>parchment</HI> it was written, than <HI>none but the sons of</HI> Aaron <HI>should minister in the sanctuary</HI>; and it has already been proved that when they came out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> those <HI>children of the priests,</HI> who could not find the <HI>register</HI> of their <HI>genealogy</HI> down from <HI>Aaron,</HI> were as <HI>polluted put from the priesthood.</HI> And the christian church has been thro' a more dreadful captivity since the apostle's days, than that of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Babylon</HI>; therefore, according to this rule, all ministers who can't shew their <HI>registers</HI> of an uninterupted <HI>succession</HI> from the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stles, must as polluted be put out of their places, and that I believe in my heart, there would not be one mini∣ster left upon the face of the earth. It will not do here, to fly to <HI>don't knows</HI> and <HI>suppositions,</HI> because we have re∣nounced the doctrine, of <HI>ignorance being the mother of devotion.</HI></P>
<P>What poor work then are our ministers like to make of it; for when they come to trace their line back; the <HI>Lord-Bishops</HI> claim a higher title, and an older right to this <HI>parchme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an they, and are now making attempts to

over-run them. And tho' <HI>episcopacy</HI> has got as many or more orders of office than were among the <HI>priests</HI> and <HI>levites,</HI> yet instead of a <HI>high priest,</HI> they have a <HI>secular prince</HI> as their head. And they formerly <HI>separated</HI> from the <HI>pope,</HI> who was set up to answer to the <HI>high priest</HI> in the old <HI>patent</HI>: and when we come to him, he has such a <HI>vo∣luntary humility,</HI> that he must <HI>worship angels,</HI> in order to get them to go to Jesus for him. And what an awful <HI>suc∣cession</HI> is here left between private members, and Jesus their glorious head?</P>
<P>Therefore says <HI>Paul, Let no man judge you,—let no man beguile you of your reward, in a voluntary humility,—And not holding the head from which all the body has nourishment.</HI> Col. 2.16,—19. <HI>Peter</HI> and other apostles to whom the <HI>keys</HI> were given to open the mysteries that were contained under those antient types, assure us that <HI>Aaron</HI> was a type of Jesus Christ, and his children a type of Christ's children, who are born of the spirit; and <HI>Peter</HI> says to such, ye also as <HI>lively</HI> stones, are built up a <HI>spiritual house,</HI> an <HI>holy priest∣hood to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Je∣sus Christ.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.5. And now we will turn our oppo∣nents own arguments back to where they belong. No <HI>strangers</HI> or <HI>bastards</HI> were allowed to come into God's sanctuary; where then is any room allowed for unregenerate persons, be they great or small, in this <HI>spiritual house</HI>? God says of the <HI>new covenant,</HI> when the <HI>old</HI> one <HI>vanished away,</HI> They shall <HI>all know me</HI> from the least to the great∣est. Heb. 8.11.</P>
<P>Again, these ministers often tell of <HI>David</HI>'s error in put∣ting the <HI>ark</HI> into a new cart which was drawn by oxen, instead of laying it on the priests shoulders; but in this light, what will become of their <HI>invented schemes,</HI> suppor∣ted and drawn by <HI>earthly powers,</HI> instead of resting the cause of <HI>truth</HI> where <HI>Paul</HI> did, <HI>in</HI> the <HI>church,</HI> which is the <HI>pillar</HI> and <HI>ground</HI> of it; or where Peter did on the shoul∣ders of this <HI>holy priest hood</HI>? Saints are often called <HI>priests,</HI> but ministers as distinguished from other christians, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e never once as I can find, called priests, in all the new-testament. Men's <HI>carts,</HI> both <HI>new</HI> ones and <HI>old</HI> ones are <HI>shaking</HI> at this da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is a token that they will all be <HI>removed,</HI> as things that are <HI>made,</HI> that those things which <HI>cannot be shaken may remain.</HI> Even Christ's <HI>supreme</HI> pow∣er to govern all, and to call whom he pleaseth out of the world unto himself, and the <HI>subordinate</HI> power which he hath given to them to confess him in the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d open∣ly

to join in his worship, and to call and constitute in office such men as he has qualified therefor, and to remove from office such as act contrary to his divine rules, without de∣pendence on any other power. This I believe is the <HI>king∣dom which cannot be moved</HI>; and is certainly the foundation which the fathers of this country built upon; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Were it worth while we might compare notes with these ministers as to an external <HI>succession</HI>; for Mr. <HI>Hanserd Knollys,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Miles,</HI> were educated at the same <HI>Universities</HI> and or∣dained by the same <HI>Bishops,</HI> that other ministers were; who came to this country: and Dr. <HI>Muther</HI> calls them "Godly anabap∣tists," and says "Both these have a respectful "character in the churches of this wilderness." <HI>Magnalia.</HI> book III p. 7. Mr. <HI>Miles</HI> was pastor of the first baptist church in the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> province, and liv'd near that which is called <HI>Miles's Bridge</HI> in <HI>Swanzey.</HI> Now the man who gave the <HI>charge</HI> in the first sepa∣rate ordination at <HI>Mansfield,</HI> had been an ordained elder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>baptists</HI>; and I suppose there has never been one ordination among us since, without an ordain'd elder to assist in it. So that our apponent will have hard work to prove that our line ever was broken according to his own notion of it; while we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plain instances of it on his side. Mr. <HI>Fitch</HI> the first minister of <HI>Norw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (who was as much accounted of in his day as any minister<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at county which Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> belongs to) was ordain'd by the <HI>church,</HI> 40 years after our fathers first came to <HI>Plymouth.</HI></NOTE> and those who have now got upon another footing may paint the fathers sepulchres as much as they please, yet their founda∣tion will be <HI>overflown with a flood</HI>: and the <HI>wood hay,</HI> and <HI>stubble</HI> of such as are on the <HI>sure foundation</HI> will all be <HI>burnt up: but themselves shall be saved; yet so, as by fire.</HI> This leads me, 3. To observe that tho' 'tis as incredible thing with many, that good men should err so far as to change that, which an ordinance took its name from; or that those who practice so, can have the divine presence: yet we have plain proof of both in the divine oracles.</P>
<P>It was God's express command, that three times in the year all the males in his antient church, should appear be∣fore him; the last of which times was at the feast of <HI>taber∣nacles,</HI> which took its name from the <HI>mode</HI> which he order∣ed it to be kept in, viz. That they should dwell in <HI>booths</HI> or <HI>tabernacles</HI> all the time of the feast. But soon after <HI>Is∣rael</HI> had got settled in <HI>Canaan,</HI> they altered that <HI>mode,</HI> and it was not recovered again for about a thousand years; namely from <HI>Joshua's</HI> time, 'till after their <HI>habitations</HI> had lain <HI>desolate</HI> 70 years. Neh. 8.17. <HI>Solomon</HI> dedicated the temple at this feast, tho' as they had dropt the <HI>manner</HI> of keeping of it, which it took its name from, so it is not there

called by that name, but is called the <HI>feast</HI> in the <HI>seventh month.</HI> 1 Kin. 8.2. Yet how remarkable were the tokens which they enjoyed, of God's presence at that feast! These things if rightly viewed, would sweep off abundance of stuff that is brought up in our day, to frighten people from <HI>seeing</HI> the truth, or from <HI>acting</HI> upon it when 'tis seen.</P>
<P>Dare any pretend that they have equa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evidence of the divine presence in sprinkling for baptism, with what <HI>Israel</HI> had at that feast? or that any have practised it, who equal∣led <HI>David</HI> for <HI>devotion,</HI> or <HI>Solomon</HI> for <HI>wisdom</HI>? yet the poor captives who returned from <HI>Babylon</HI> were not deter'd by such great characters, from returning to an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct con∣formity to divine rule. 4. As the baptists are often repre∣sented as the most <HI>rigid</HI> of all sects, I will briefly touch up∣on some plain evidences to the contrary. The reader may remember how shockingly Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> of <HI>Branford</HI> was treated by the <HI>consociation</HI> for his preaching among the <HI>baptists.</HI> And tho' the separates set out, and for some years practised free communion with the baptists, and the bars were broken down, so that they were admitted to free and successful labors in many baptist societies, and they went on comfortably together, 'till by this freedom many were brought into such an acquaintance with the baptist prin∣ciples, as to embrace and practice them; yet that made a great difficulty, and several were censured by churches and councils, for leaving infant baptism: upon which many at∣tempts were made for accommodation, 'till at length a bap∣tist elder refused to act in an ordination with an elder of the other denomination, because he thought that elder had in several instances injured the baptists and their principles. This caused hard contention between the two elders, and they joined and called all these churches together, to hear the affair: which was the largest meeting we ever had since the beginning of the separation.</P>
<P>The meeting was at <HI>Stonington</HI> on May 29, 1754, where the messengers of about 35 churches came together; and labored in conference upon these affairs three days; and in the close of the meeting, several of the most noted leaders on the side of the paedo-baptists openly declared that tho' they could yet commune with saints who did <HI>not see</HI> light for infant baptism; yet they did withdraw the hand of fel∣lowship from all such as professed <HI>to see</HI> that there was no warrant for bringing infants to that ordinance. And thus the breach appeared before the world to be on that side.</P>
<P>And there has lately been a plain instance of like nature, among those called standing churches. Mr. <HI>Heze∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iah

Smith,</HI> who was educated at <HI>New-Jersey</HI> college, came into <HI>New-England</HI> 4 years ago, with a proposal of only travelling and laboring a while, and then of returning back again: and under this view he was readily received into many pulpits: but a destitute society in <HI>Haverhill,</HI> by their pressing importunity, prevailed with him to alter his purpose, and stay with them; and when those ministers who had received him understood that, they turned against him with all their might, and one of them has held forth to the world in print, that when he received him, it was under an expectation that Mr. <HI>S.</HI> would keep his principles concerning baptism "private to himself," and neither <HI>openly</HI> hold them up, nor <HI>practice</HI> them among us. And he reflects very hard upon Mr. <HI>S.</HI> for disappointing that expectation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Parson's sermons on Act. 16.33. p. 12.</NOTE> But we may boldly appeal to his conscience that he would not call it <HI>charity</HI> nor a <HI>catholic temper,</HI> for another sect to allow him only to <HI>think</HI> for himself, but not to <HI>speak</HI> his thoughts; or if he spake them, yet not to <HI>prac∣tice</HI> upon them lest it should offend others. And let who will deny others the liberty which they take themselves; or <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>set at naught</HI> their brethren for taking such liberty: yet the day is hastning, when we must all stand before the <HI>judgment seat</HI> of HIM who has <HI>eyes like a flame of fire.</HI></P>

<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>A few lessons of instruction must close the whole.</P>
<P N="1">1. MAY we all learn the importance of <HI>Solomon's</HI> advice, to <HI>Buy the truth and sell it not.</HI> The end of buying and selling is mutual gain; and he who forsakes <HI>all</HI> for the <HI>truth as it is in Jesus,</HI> makes great gain to his own soul, and will prove a blessing to others: but they who make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, the whole world can't make up their loss.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us never imagine to promote the <HI>cause</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> by any <HI>false methods.</HI> Indeed God will over-rule every th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for his own glory; and in that sense we can do not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against the truth: but for it: yet let us talk what we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of defending truth, or promoting its cause, if at the same time we advance false arguments, or discover a wrong tem∣per
<PB N="120" REF="010823_0061_0F81D4056968AD70"/>
and behavior, we thereby contract guilt to ourselves, and injure our fellow men. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To give a plain illustration of my meaning. I will mention an instance which equally cuts both ways. In our former dis∣putes concerning baptism, I heard one advance it as a motive to embrace the baptist principles, that thereby providence had opened a door for a release from a burden of taxes: and the same day I heard another of equal note say, The baptist principles might be right, and he did not know but he should conform to them if he liv'd among them, but it would not do to make an <HI>overturn</HI> about it among us. I was then at a loss in the affair; But this made my soul cry, Alas where are we! that <HI>interest</HI> should be advanced as an argument, for a principle as truth, and <HI>honour</HI> as an argument against it! Each party can readily see corruption on the other side; yet alas! how little faithful <HI>charity</HI> is exer∣cised, to distinguish between <HI>truth,</HI> and the <HI>corruptions</HI> and <HI>infir∣mities</HI> of those who profess it?</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Let none indulge the imagination of being <HI>neuters</HI> in this case: for all heaven is engaged <HI>for</HI> truth, and all hell <HI>against</HI> it; and this world is <HI>divided</HI> between them; so that HE who is the <HI>truth</HI> and the <HI>life,</HI> says, He that is not with me, is against me; and he that <HI>gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.</HI> Mat. 12.30. Therefore tho' many have been at <HI>ease from their youth,</HI> and glory in their <HI>steadiness</HI> in the way they were trained up in; and others, <HI>because they</HI> have no <HI>changes,</HI> therefore <HI>fear not God.</HI> (Psal. 55.19.) but laugh at the infirmities or calamities of professors; yet they will soon find the <HI>reality</HI> of what <HI>truth</HI> declares, even that their <HI>judgment</HI> and <HI>damnation lingereth not.</HI> To be <HI>stedfast</HI> in the truth, is a weighty matter, but to <HI>change</HI> from error to truth, is of equal importance.</P>
<P N="4">4. Learn what is the real cause of all the <HI>disorders</HI> in the world. As they were first introduced by <HI>hearkning</HI> to a <HI>creature</HI> instead of the <HI>creator</HI>; so the cause and nature of all our present <HI>disorders</HI> are the <HI>worshipping</HI> and <HI>serving</HI> the <HI>creature</HI> more than the <HI>Creator,</HI> who is over all, God blessed forever. And what higher worship can be offered to any being, than to <HI>fix our dependence</HI> upon him for <HI>light</HI> to <HI>direct,</HI> and for <HI>power</HI> to <HI>act</HI>? yet how much have we of <HI>such worship,</HI> in a nation where many fancy that both <HI>pa∣gan</HI> and <HI>antichristian idolatry</HI> have long been destroyed? This work is carried on now, as it was formerly <HI>in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery.</HI> Ezek. 8.12. God is <HI>good</HI>: and every soul that knows not the <HI>true good,</HI> has some <HI>false image</HI> of good set up in his mind, which go∣verns

his conduct and behavior; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds</HI> has clearly demonstrated this point, in his <HI>Trea∣tise of the will.</HI> Part 2. Sect. 9.</NOTE> yet these <HI>images</HI> are of en covered so artfully, that they say, <HI>The Lord seeth us not. Peace, order, zeal for the good old way,</HI> and abun∣dance of such fine names are often wrote upon the outside of this covering; and the great <HI>deceiver</HI> plays a double game thereby: for by this means he <HI>keeps</HI> them which are under this cover, easy in a conceit that they <HI>have</HI> religion; and by their evil conduct, he persuades others that they are as well <HI>without</HI> it as <HI>with</HI> it. Still laboring to keep all their attention fixed, some way or other upon the creature, <HI>lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</HI> 2. Cor. 4.4.</P>
<P>And whenever the power of God is remarkably display∣ed, to turn men from darkness to light, and from the pow∣er of satan unto God; a loud noise is soon raised about <HI>disorders, delusions</HI> and <HI>imprudencies</HI>; and all arts are used to blind peoples minds, and to settle them back into carnal security again. And no stratagem of the enemy has been more successful, than to mix and confound error with truth, in christians experiences, conversation, and conduct: and when their corruptions are discovered, sinners and hypocrites catch at them: for God says, They <HI>eat up</HI> the <HI>sin</HI> of <HI>my people,</HI> and they <HI>set their heart on their iniquity</HI>▪ Hos. 4.8. And the destroyer of souls would persuade them, that there is nothing in religion: or if there is some reality therein, yet that common people can't discern the difference, and therefore must be directed by such as know better than they. In order to accomplish this end, many who would be thought to know much, have often pretend∣ed to discern distinctions, where others can see no differ∣ence; while things which are really distinct in their nature, are confounded together. This wickedness has been as wretchedly practised by some, under the pretence of <HI>spiri∣tual teaching,</HI> as it has by others under the name of <HI>great learning.</HI></P>
<P>It is a fact not to be disputed, that some men know more, and see further than others do, both in natural, and in spiritual things; but when real or pretended knowledge, is used to keep others in ignorance, and to excite a high opinion of themselves, instead of laboring to enlighten and benefit others; that is a certain token of such persons being ensnared by, if they are not under the full power <HI>of,</HI> the <HI>wisdom</HI> which is <HI>from beneath.</HI> For when there was much
<PB N="122" REF="010823_0062_0F81D406309299D0"/>
murmuring among the common people, concerning HIM who spake as no mere man ever did: some saying <HI>He is a good man,</HI> others saying, <HI>Nay, but he deceiveth the people</HI>: He was so far from checking their attempt to form a judg∣ment of such matters, that he gave them an infallible rule to judge upon: viz. <HI>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness in him.</HI> John 7.18, But as those who have a <HI>right</HI> to judge, yet many times don't judge <HI>right</HI>; therefore he lays down two important lessons in the affair. One is, not to act as unconcerned <HI>spec∣tators,</HI> but as persons really engaged to <HI>practice</HI> what they know. <HI>If any man will</HI> DO <HI>his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</HI> The other lesson is, not to <HI>judge</HI> in a superficial manner, by the <HI>appearance</HI> and shew which is made, but to <HI>judge righteous judgment</HI>; to search carefully into the truth and reality of things.</P>
<P>Thus the son of God plainly held forth the right which common people ever have to judge, both of the <HI>doctrine</HI> and <HI>conduct</HI> of <HI>teachers</HI>; and the <HI>meek he will guide in judg∣ment,</HI> while those who receive not the <HI>love of the truth,</HI> but have <HI>pleasure in unrighteousness,</HI> are constantly exposed to be given over to <HI>strong delusions.</HI> This being the <HI>order</HI> of Christ's kingdom; hence see what a <HI>disorder</HI> it makes, when common christians are denied the free liberty of examining their teachers, and of acting according to their judgments in the affair; and also that 'tis a great <HI>disorder</HI> to condemn and reproach any teachers, only because they are not owned by <HI>rulers</HI> or <HI>learned ministers</HI>: for by this very rule, our glorious Lord was condemned as a <HI>deceiver,</HI> and his fol∣lowers stigmatized as <HI>ignorant cursed people,</HI> by men who were as famous in the world's esteem, for <HI>learning, devoti∣on,</HI> and <HI>order,</HI> as any in our day, ver. 47—49. Nor is the <HI>disorder</HI> less on the other hand, when any under a pretence of <HI>special teachings,</HI> and <HI>divine influence,</HI> croud their im∣provements upon those who are not edifyed thereby, and plead their right so to do, because they see further than others, who they say can't discern where they are: tho' (it may be) serious christians <HI>do see</HI> them at the same time, conduct in a <HI>flesh-pleasing</HI> way, and even not providing things <HI>honest in the sight of men.</HI></P>
<P>Some such <HI>spots</HI> and <HI>blemishes</HI> have caused the greatest disorders that I have ever known among any of our chur∣ches;

and a principal reason of some such persons being left to go on, so far as they have in such a way, was a fear in humble souls of speaking evil (as many have done) of <HI>things they know not</HI>: and we ought always to be cautions in that respect, for 'tis like shooting in the dark, where we may be as likely to wound a friend as an enemy. What we know to be right, we ought to own, and to disown what we know to be wrong, and leave other things 'till they are opened to us. But here the case is plain, for C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never gave authority to any to crowd upon others; and we are commanded to <HI>cease to hear instruction,</HI> that causeth <HI>to err from the words of knowledge.</HI> Prov. 19.27. And also to <HI>withdraw from every brother that walketh disorderly.</HI></P>
<P>It is an important part of <HI>gospel order,</HI> to have every member encouraged in the improvement of the gifts which are given them; but for any to pretend, they have got so far out of sight of the least saint, either by human or di∣vine teachings, that the saint can't understand them, when they properly improve their gifts, is as absurd as to tell of a <HI>candle shining so bright as not to give light unto all that are in the house.</HI> Mat. 5.15. The divine direction is,
<Q>Who is a <HI>wise man,</HI> and endued with <HI>knowledge</HI> among you? let him shew out of a <HI>good conversation</HI> his <HI>works</HI> with <HI>meekness of wisdom.</HI> But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish: for where envying and strife is, there is <HI>confusion,</HI> and <HI>every evil work.</HI> But the wis∣dom that is from above, is FIRST PURE, <HI>then peaceable,</HI> gentle, easy to be intreated, <HI>full</HI> of mercy and good fruits, without <HI>partiality,</HI> and without <HI>hypocrisy.</HI> And the fruit of <HI>righteousness</HI> is sown in <HI>peace</HI> of them that <HI>make peace.</HI></Q></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>OON after Mr. <HI>Fish</HI>'s book was put into my hand, I received a sermon which a gentleman sent me from the westward, intitled,
<Q>The holiness of infants explained and improved; or a vindi∣cation of the divine right of christian infants, to the privileges of the church; and particularly to <HI>bap∣tism,</HI> the initiating seal of the second covenant, is a ser∣mon preached at <HI>Woodstock,</HI> second society, in the colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to a numerous auditory, Dec. 10. 1765.
<PB N="124" REF="010823_0063_0F81D406E9BFBE80"/>
By <HI>Isaac Foster,</HI> V.D.M. pastor of a church in <HI>Stafford.</HI></Q>
Wherein my name is mentioned, and a few strokes are giv∣en upon my <HI>letter</HI> to Mr. <HI>Lord.</HI> I shall therefore add a brief reply thereto in this place. His text is, 1 Cor. 7.14. Tho' there is nothing said of <HI>baptism</HI> in the text or context; and all the argument turns only upon the term <HI>sanctified</HI> and <HI>holy</HI>: which words are used in three senses in scripture. As 1. For <HI>internal</HI> and spiritual purity. 2. For the <HI>exter∣nal</HI> consecration and setting apart of persons or things to divine worship. In this sense the <HI>whole nation</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> were <HI>holy,</HI> as they were set apart from all other nations to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e God's church; and so the <HI>place</HI> and <HI>furniture</HI> for worship among them were <HI>holy,</HI> being <HI>devoted</HI> to that use, in distinc∣tion from all their common enjoyments. 3. These words are sometimes used for the <HI>lawful</HI> and <HI>free use</HI> of creature comforts, which God grants to his saints, while they are going on in a life of <HI>devotedness</HI> to him. Thus in a plain prophecy of gospel privileges and blessings it is said, <HI>In that day, shall there be upon the bells of the horses, holiness unto the Lord;—Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in</HI> Judah <HI>shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts,</HI> Zech. 14.20, 21. Which words I suppose intend the same thing that <HI>Paul</HI> expressed, in this very epistle, (after he had declared that those things were <HI>lawful</HI> to christians which were <HI>unclean</HI> to the Jews,) <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</HI> 1. Cor. 10.31. So he says in 1 Tim. 4▪4, 5. <HI>Every creature of God is good,—for it is sanctified by the word of God, and prayer,</HI> i. e. His word gives christians a <HI>warrant</HI> to take them, and by prayer they receive a <HI>blessing</HI> in the use of them.</P>
<P>Now in my letter to Mr. <HI>Lord,</HI> I gave it as my mind, that this third sense of the words <HI>sanctified</HI> and <HI>holy,</HI> was the true intent of them in the text before us: and that the <HI>Co∣rinthians</HI> writing to the apostle upon this affair (ver. 1.) was doubtless occasioned by their reading in Ezra 10.3. That the <HI>Jews</HI> were obliged to <HI>put away all the wives, and such as was born of them,</HI> which they had taken of other nations, that were not of their religion: which might na∣turally cause an enquiry, whether they must do so now or not? And the answer is in the negative, for the unbelie∣ving mate is <HI>sanctified,</HI> and their children <HI>holy.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> entirely concurs with my sense of the occasion of the words, and also as to the meaning of the word <HI>sanctified</HI>; but he would have the word <HI>holy</HI> taken in the second sense which was given above; and the only reason that he gives
<PB N="125" REF="010823_0063_0F81D406E9BFBE80"/>
for differing from me in that respect p. 8. is,
<Q>That the unbelieving party is not said to be sanctified in relation to God but only in relation to the believing yoke-fel∣low.</Q>
But he says, children are holy,
<Q>not in relation to any other but God only.</Q></P>
<P>Upon which I would observe, that 'tis very evident in the text, that the childrens being holy, is the <HI>effect</HI> of the parents being sanctified, so that here we are presented with a number of absurdities. As 1. an <HI>effect</HI> which riseth above its <HI>cause.</HI> 2. With a case of conscience, which was occa∣sioned by a text in <HI>Ezra,</HI> that obliged the <HI>Jews</HI> to put away their <HI>wives,</HI> and such as were <HI>born of them,</HI> as <HI>equally un∣clean</HI>; and yet the answer to it is declared, to mean some∣thing <HI>higher</HI> in the child than in the parent it sprang from. For Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> says, the unbelieving parents being
<Q>desti∣tute of the sanctifying graces of the holy spirit of God, are unfit for communion with him.</Q>
p. 5. Yet in the same page after saying,
<Q>The children of believers are as others, born in sin, and by <HI>nature</HI> children of wrath;</Q>
he goes on to say,
<Q>They are visibly sanctified, being set apart for God:</Q>
and declares,
<Q>It is such a sanctification or holiness as is intended, when the church and people of <HI>Israel</HI> are called holy; Psal. 50.5. Gather my <HI>saints</HI> together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</Q>
Here <HI>old sinners</HI> are declared to be <HI>unfit</HI> for communion with God, while 'tis asserted that <HI>young ones</HI> who are <HI>born in sin,</HI> are set apart for him! 3. We have a <HI>self-contradiction</HI>; for in p. 4. Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> refer∣ing to Ezra 10.3. says,
<Q>'Tis just that those actions that are done against <HI>law,</HI> should be accounted not only <HI>un∣lawful,</HI> but <HI>null.</HI>—But it was otherwise with those to whom the apostle wrote; for they were <HI>lawful</HI> man and wife; their marriage not being <HI>prohibited,</HI> they might not be <HI>parted,</HI> and their children not unclean, but holy.</Q>
Yet in page 7 when he is opposing Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> he says,
<Q>The question propounded by the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> was not whe∣ther a believing husband and unbelieving wife, were <HI>lawful</HI> man and wife together? No body <HI>doubted that.</HI></Q></P>
<P>However I will not waste paper, nor abuse the reader with remarks upon all the stuff which his sermon abounds with; but would just observe, that the new-testament cer∣tainly gives the same sense of these terms, <HI>sanctified</HI> and holy, else where, as we do here; and those who give the other sense of them are forced, all of them, to borrow it from the <HI>national church</HI> in the old testament; and Mr.
<PB N="126" REF="010823_0064_0F81D409B36E4280"/>
<HI>Forster</HI> says,
<Q>I freely own that I know no other difference, betwixt a national church and a congregational church, but one is great, and the other little.</Q>
p. 20. If all would come out so plain, we should hope to see the contro∣versy soon brought to an issue: for the first constitution of the national church, in <HI>Abraham's houshold,</HI> is very express; the <HI>covenant</HI> included every <HI>man-child</HI> that was <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn in his house, and bought with his money of the stranger.</HI> These were all in that covenant, and therefore were to have the <HI>token</HI> of it administred upon them. <HI>Circumcision</HI> did not bring them into covenant; natural birth or purchase brought them in, and being in, if there was one soul of them that continued without the token of the covenant, God said, <HI>That soul shall be cut off from his people: he hath broken my covenant.</HI> Gen. 17.13, 14, 27. And when the <HI>passover</HI> was instituted in that church, the Lord said, <HI>every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast cir∣cumcised him,</HI> THEN <HI>shall he eat thereof.</HI> Exod. 12.44.</P>
<P>No words could be more plain than these are, to describe the exact limits of the national church; yet Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> asserts, that the patent sealed by baptism, is
<Q>The very same <HI>parchment</HI> that was given to <HI>Abraham</HI>:</Q>
and Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> and <HI>Foster</HI> concur in the same sense. But if so, then out of their own mouths they are condemned; for instead of excluding <HI>half</HI> the subjects, as they tell us of, they ex∣clude more than a <HI>hundred</HI> to <HI>one. Abraham,</HI> before this, had 118 servants, <HI>born in his own house,</HI> who were fit for <HI>soldiers.</HI> Gen. 14.14. And <HI>in the self-same day</HI> that this covenant was made with him, he <HI>circumcised his son</HI> and ALL <HI>the</HI> MEN <HI>of his house.</HI> Here was but <HI>one</HI> of his <HI>own seed</HI> to such a great <HI>houshold,</HI> (but now their plea is, only for little children.) And if we view the antitype, we may see as plain a description of the gospel church. <HI>Paul</HI> shews to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> that Christ had <HI>broken down the middle wall of partition between</HI> them and the <HI>Jews,</HI> and came and <HI>preached peace</HI> to both, whereby their <HI>enmity was slain</HI>; and <HI>thro' him they both had access by one spirit unto the Father,</HI> and were <HI>fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the</HI> HOUSHOLD OF GOD; <HI>and were built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone,</HI> Eph. 2.14—20</P>
<P>Now if Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> knows of no other difference between these two churches but only what respects their <HI>number,</HI> I would desire him to go to school with <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> and learn the difference betwixt being <HI>born of the flesh,</HI> and a being
<PB N="127" REF="010823_0064_0F81D409B36E4280"/>
<HI>born of the spirit.</HI> In my letter, I had observed that the <HI>oracles of God</HI> were <HI>committed to the Jews,</HI> and many means were used for the conversion of members <HI>within</HI> the church: whereas now, the gospel is freely <HI>preached to all nations,</HI> and the <HI>lively stones,</HI> which are the materials of this <HI>spiri∣tual house,</HI> which is the antitype of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s temple, are <HI>prepared without,</HI> before they are <HI>builded together for an habitation of God thro' the spirit.</HI> Upon which Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> gives several cants, and says, he knows not what I mean, unless it is, "That there is now no means
<Q>used for the conversion of members within the church.</Q>
p. 21.</P>
<P>But if the observing this difference, that the means for conversion were <HI>confined within</HI> the <HI>jewish</HI> church, which are now <HI>freely used</HI> with others who are <HI>without</HI> the christi∣an church, can convey <HI>no other</HI> meaning in it, than that there are <HI>no means</HI> used for conversion within this church; then I despair of ever conveying any just ideas to mankind I However, when we see how this man leaves his own mean∣ing, we shall not wonder at this treatment of others; for upon my saying that <HI>Paul</HI> takes much pains to keep <HI>Abra∣ham's</HI> natural and spiritual seed distinct, he says,
<Q><HI>Abra∣ham</HI> never had a spiritual seed, nor no other man, the man Jesus Christ excepted.</Q>
p. 24. And leaves it so. Now whether he thinks, <HI>Onesimus</HI> whom <HI>Paul</HI> had <HI>begotten in his bonds,</HI> was his <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>spiritual son</HI> I know not; neither shall I detain my reader, any further than to cor∣rect two stories which this writer has published.</P>
<P>In warning the people of <HI>Woodstock</HI> of their danger, Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> says,
<Q>By going after those who are now causing divisions and separations among you, and conniving at their wicked doctrines and practices, you will be in dan∣ger of falling into such errors, and embracing such opi∣nions, as will render your salvation altogether hopeless.</Q>
p. 28. Then after allowing that there were some sober baptists in the land 20 years ago, he says,
<Q>As to our pre∣sent separate baptists, 'tis well known that in opinion and practice, they are notoriously bad, and seem daily grow∣ing worse. Witness Dr. <HI>Davis's</HI> book, which so far as I can understand, is generally liked among them. This man was as famous a baptist preacher as any in the country a few years ago, and what he is now come to, his book will show, in which he blasphemously attributes all conviction of sin to the Devil.</Q>
p. 29.</P>
<P>This I perceive was delivered from the pulpit, which makes me think of Dr. <HI>Franck's</HI> saying, that he who hears
<PB N="128" REF="010823_0065_0F81D40A63991150"/>
such a railer does not hear Christ, but the devil himself; for what could that <HI>accuser</HI> say more false than this is! The pastor of the baptist church in <HI>Stafford,</HI> informed me some years ago of one <HI>Davis</HI> a physician, who was cast out of that church, for broaching antinomian errors; and that he published a small pamphlet upon them afterward: but I never saw the man nor his book, and 'tis so far from be∣ing "generally liked among" our churches, that very few have ever seen his book, and Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> may be boldly challenged to produce an instance if he can of one member in the baptist church in <HI>Woodstock,</HI> or any church which they hold-fellowship with, who like or will countenance the horrid principle he speaks of.</P>
<P>The other story concerns <HI>Wookstock</HI> in particular. Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> says,
<Q>I am informed that not long since, there was a hopeful prospect of the revival of serious godliness among you; that a number of persons in this place, ap∣peared seriously and suitably concerned about the great things of God and religion, and were enquiring the way to Zion, with their faces thither ward; but no sooner did these men, like a destroying flood, come in among you, but they flung all into confusion, as you see this day, and in a moment dashed all your hopes of a revival of god∣liness amongst you.</Q>
p. 33.34.</P>
<P>Now the plain state of their case, as I have it from good authorities, is briefly thus. Vanity and extravagance, es∣pecially among young people in that place, had greatly prevailed: 'till a young man, who had been a ringleader in frolicking, happened to hear a <HI>baptist</HI> elder preach, in Dec. 1763. which was blest as a means of his <HI>awakening,</HI> and he continued under <HI>conviction</HI> 'till the next <HI>March,</HI> and then was brought out of darkness into marvellous light; where∣upon four of his old companions came one evening, to try to get him back to his former way; but instead of that, two of them were seized under <HI>conviction</HI>; and they were moved to set up religious meetings, instead of their former frolicks; which meetings in a few weeks increased to seve∣ral hundreds; and these meetings which were carried on by prayer, singing, reading, and mutual exhortation, were made a happy means of the awakening and hopeful con∣version of a considerable number. And tho' they gladly improved occasional opportunities of hearing baptist elders, yet they still attended the parish meeting, 'till the minister there, upon a fast which was appointed for the purpose, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot some neighbouring ministers to labour to regulate
<PB N="129" REF="010823_0065_0F81D40A63991150"/>
them: who plainly warned them against the first instru∣ments of their awakening, as being the <HI>deceivers</HI> which should come in the last times. And they evidently set up the same standard that we have seen so much of before, of <HI>measuring themselves by themselves,</HI> so as to read all off for <HI>delusion,</HI> which interfered with the order and honor of the old ministers and churches as they stood.</P>
<P>But for young converts to hear, the instruments and na∣ture of that work, which turn'd them from vanity to love Christ, treated at such a rate, it only served to convince them that the ministers who treated things at that rate, were wrong, and so finally caused a separation from them, and a baptist church was gathered in that place. The former part of this account I had from the mouth of the young man who as first awakened there, and in the pre∣sence of one of the two young men who were convinced by him; and the rest I have had attested by many sub∣stantial evidences.</P>
<P>I leave the reader to make his own remarks; and shall only observe that this author has intermixed with these slanders, some quotations of the most <HI>bitter</HI> sentences against the baptists, that he could find in the antient fa∣thers; it makes me think of a saying of one of the <HI>old Martyrs,</HI>
<Q>Alas! says he, such is the wickedness of these our last days, that nothing moves us!—Neither the pure doctrine, the godliness of life, nor good example of the antient fathers.—If in anything they erred, that will their charitable children embrace, <HI>publish</HI> and main∣tain with sword, faggot and fire: but in vain they strive against the stream; for tho' in despite of the truth, by force of the ears of crafty persuasion, they may bring themselves into the haven of <HI>hell</HI>; yet can they not make all men believe that the banks move, while the ship saileth, nor ever shall be able to turn the direct course of the stream of God's truth.</Q></P>
