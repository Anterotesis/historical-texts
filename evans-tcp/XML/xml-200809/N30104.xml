<P>Concerning the Multitude and Heinousness of your Sins, for which you ought to be humbled and mourn, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve to shew your great Need of Christ to deliver you from them▪ Think no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not that your Repentance, Confessions, or Tears for Sin, can any ways satisfie the <HI>Justice of God</HI> for it, or merit <HI>Accep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance</HI> or <HI>Pardon for you.</HI> This were to put these Things in <HI>Christ's Room,</HI> that are only <HI>Means</HI> to lead you to him; and to take up with a <HI>Righteousness of your own,</HI> instead of his that can atone the <HI>Justice of God</HI> for Sinners. O then! see that ye look be∣yond all to Christ alone for <HI>Atonement, Righteousness, Pardon</HI> and <HI>Salvation,</HI> but count all Things but <HI>Dung</HI> and <HI>Loss</HI> in Respect of him.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039983_0003_1015866C6BBEB330"/>
Now, since the Gospel offers Christ to all that hear it, and the <HI>Call</HI> and <HI>Command</HI> to receive and embrace Christ as a <HI>Saviour,</HI> is given to all and every one, even to the vilest of Sinners; you have a full <HI>Warrant</HI> to lay hold on him for <HI>Pardon,</HI> and flee to him for <HI>Mercy,</HI> and you heinously sin against God and your own Soul, if you neglect to do it. <HI>How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation,</HI> and slight so great a <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>I shall therefore make use of some <HI>Mo∣tives</HI> to press poor perishing Sinners, to flee from <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Wrath,</HI> to <HI>Jesus Christ the only Saviour,</HI> and to receive and rest upon him for <HI>Life and Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>I. Take a View of the <HI>Misery</HI> of a <HI>Na∣tural</HI> and <HI>Christless Condition,</HI> and O that God would open your Eyes to let yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> see it, and convince you, that while thou art in this <HI>State,</HI> thou art a <HI>Rebel</HI> to thy <HI>God,</HI> a <HI>Prodigal</HI> to thy <HI>Father,</HI> a <HI>Slave</HI> to thy <HI>Lusts,</HI> and an <HI>Alien</HI> to the <HI>Common∣wealth of Israel.</HI> If thou comest not to Christ with thy <HI>Burdens,</HI> the whole Burden of unpardoned Sin lies upon thy own Back; and this is a Burden that will sink thee lower than the Grave; nay, it will press thee to the lowest Hell, and keep thee eternally sinking there. Consider also, how vile and loathsome thou and all thy Actions, whether Natural, Civil, or Reli∣gious, are in the Sight of a holy God <PB N="3" REF="039983_0003_1015866C6BBEB330"/>while thou art out of Christ: Thy Soul is naked, and swarms with the Vermin of filthy Lusts, and thou hast neither a <HI>Gar∣ment</HI> to cover thee, nor a <HI>Fountain</HI> to wash thee: The Leprosie of Sin spreads over all, so that from the <HI>Crown of the Head,</HI> to the <HI>Sole of the Foot,</HI> there is nothing but <HI>Bruises and putrefying Sores</HI>: So that there is no Mire so unclean, no Vomit so loath∣some, no Carrion so offensive, no Pesti∣lence so noisome, as thou art in thy <HI>Christ∣less State,</HI> in the Eyes of a <HI>holy God, who cannot look upon Iniquity, but with Abhor∣rence.</HI> Again, Consider thou art a Slave to Satan the worst of Tyrants, he rules and works in your Hearts, as a Workman doth in his Shop, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 2. He uses your Powers, Faculties, Senses and Members, according to his Pleasure. He says, <HI>Go, and you go, Do this, and you do it.</HI> Your Bon∣dage is worse than the <HI>Israelites</HI> under <HI>Phe∣raoh,</HI> for they groaned under theirs, but you, alas! are not sensible of yours, nei∣ther will you believe it: The Devil knows, that if you perceived your Slavery, you would seek to make your Escape from him; therefore, to make sure Work, he deals with you as the '<HI>Philistines</HI> did with <HI>Sam∣son,</HI> puts out your <HI>Eyes</HI> that you may not see your <HI>Chains,</HI> nor look to <HI>Christ</HI> for <HI>Li∣berty</HI>: O that God would open them, and cause you to groan under your <HI>Fetters,</HI> and look to <HI>Christ</HI> for <HI>Relief.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="039983_0004_1015866EDEED1D40"/>
Moreover, while thou art in thy Christ∣less State, God's Wrath is still burning a∣gainst thee, the flaming Sword of Justice is always over thy Neck, Psal. vii. 11. <HI>God is angry with the wicked every Day,</HI> every Day of the Week, and every Hour of the Day; when thou goest out and comest in, rise it up, or lyest down, God is still angry with thee; yea, <HI>He hath bent his Bow, and made ready his Arrows,</HI> which are steeled with Wrath, and headed with Vengeance; nay, his Bow is drawn, and his Arrows are at the Flight; and, O Christless Soul, thou art only the Butt thereof, and if he let them fly, they will pierce thee to the very Soul, and who will heal that Wound? What a dangerous State is this?</P>
<P>And further, All the Curses of the Law are levelled against thee, and a just God is engaged by his Oath to ruin thee, if thou abidest in this State, Heb. iii. 18. <HI>To whom sware he, that they should not enter into his Rest, but to them that believed not.</HI> Should not the Thoughts of this make thee tremble? Were it but the Oath of a Man or a Company of Men to procure thy Death as of these forty Men that bound themselves with an Oath, they would nei∣ther Eat nor Drink till they killed <HI>Paul,</HI> it would bereave thee of thy Nights rest and quiet till they were made Friends with thee; And will the Oath of the great God have no Effect upon thee, nor move <PB N="5" REF="039983_0004_1015866EDEED1D40"/>thee to flee to Christ for Protection and Reconciliation? Who can help thee or deal for thee, if Christ be neglected? With what Face canst thou look to him, or cry for Mercy from him, when he comes to judge thee at the last Day. If thou remain Christless now, thou wilt be Speechless, Helpless and Hopeless then. O think, what pale Faces, quivering Lips, fainting Hearts &amp; trembling Consciences will be among Christless Sin∣ners chen? How will their Heads hang down, and Knees knock together, and cry, alas for the Day! They can look no where for Comfort, for the Judge frowns on them, the Saints deride them, their own Friends upbraid them, the Angels mock them, the Devils scoff at them, the Heavens thunder against them, the Earth flames about them, and Hell groans for them, and down they will go roaring and howling for ever.</P>
<P>O Christless Soul, how can'st thou think to ly in that dark Dungeon for ever, where there is nothing but <HI>weeping and guashing of Teeth</HI> to be heard, and <HI>utter Darkness</HI> to be seen, but never the least Sight of the Light of God's Favour to all Eternity? How wilt thou live in that <HI>Pit where there is no Water</HI>? Not a Drop of Comfort or Refreshment to the thir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty scorched Prisoners, no, not so much as one Drop to cool their Tongue, the Torments there are both Endless and Easeless. O poor Christless Soul, thou art, as it were▪
<PB N="6" REF="039983_0005_10158671C0CAB688"/>
apprehended by Justice for thy Debt, and brought the length of this Prison Door, and there are Hundreds of Diseases and Devils waiting for a Warrant to open the Door to let you in, and wilt thou not em∣ploy a Surety, nor seek for a Ransom, when justice is waiting a while to see if thou wilt do it; and Christ is earnestly offer∣ing himself to be thy Cautioner, and his Blood to ransom thee from this Pit, and to be sure no other Thing will do it, see <HI>Zech.</HI> ix. 11.</P>
<P>II. As it is God's Command that you should receive &amp; believe on his Son Jesus Christ; so he declares that it is a <HI>Work</HI> a∣bove all others, most pleasing to him, <HI>Joh.</HI> vi. 29. It is emphatically called his <HI>Com∣mandment,</HI> I John iii. 23. being a Com∣mand he values more than all other Com∣mands in the Bible: And so upon the other hand, there is no Sin so provoking to God, as Unbelief &amp; rejecting of Christ; yea he is more offended with it, than with the breaking of all his other Commands. see <HI>Heb.</HI> x. 28, 29. Put all your other Sins in one Scale, and Unbelief in another, and you will find that Unbelief weighs down all the Rest, for it is a slighting of the whole Work of Redemption, which is the Master∣piece of all God's Works, being that which hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heart is most set upon, and he hath been at most Pains about, I <HI>John</HI> iv. 9. O be persuaded then to do the Work that is <PB N="7" REF="039983_0005_10158671C0CAB688"/>most acceptable to God, &amp; obey his great <HI>Command of believing upon the Name of his Son.</HI> The whole Creation obeys his Com∣mands; he commands the Sun to run its daily Course, and it obeys him; he com∣mands the Sea to Ebb and Flow twice a Day, and it obeys to a Minute; he com∣mands the Angels and all the Hosts of Heaven, and they punctually obey him; and will you only be disobedient to him; and that to his beloved Command, when yet he hath done more for you than for the whole Creation?</P>
<P>III. Consider what an unspeakable Mer∣cy and Happiness it is to you, to enjoy the free Offers of Jesus Christ, and to have God commanding you to receive him. How would the fallen Angels value such a Mer∣cy, if they had it? They would not be loth to leave their Dungeon and accept of a Saviour as you are: But their State is e∣ternally hopeless and desperate, there is no Remedy for their Misery; O do not put your selves in the same Case with them by slighting the offered Remedy. How would damned Souls prize such an Offer? The least News, and remotest Hopes of it would make them leap in their Chains, and sing in the Flames. O how glad would they be to lift up their flaming Hands to take hold of the Cords of Love and Mercy if they could be let down to them in that dark Dungeon? <PB N="8" REF="039983_0006_10158673919E48D0"/>Why then should ye wilfully put your selves into the same hopeless Condition with them by your Unbelief? Nay, your neglecting so many Offers, will sink you far deeper in that scalding Lake of Fire and Brimstone, and increase your Flames to more Vehemency than these of others who have not been so privileged. O how will <HI>Devils, Turks, Jesus</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> up∣braid you there, for your inexcuseable Fol∣ly in slighting your Mercy, and destroying your Souls? Be wise then in Time. prize your Privilege, and <HI>consider the Things that belong to your Peace, before they be hid from your Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>IV. Consider what an excellent &amp; suit∣able Help Christ is for fallen Sinners; he is well furnished and qualified for your Case, he hath <HI>Gold</HI> for your Poverty, <HI>Eye∣salve</HI> for your Blindness, <HI>Balm</HI> for your Wounds, <HI>Physick</HI> for your Diseases, <HI>Bread</HI> for your Hunger, <HI>White Raiment</HI> for your Nakedness, a <HI>Fountain</HI> for your Pollution, and a <HI>Ransom</HI> for your Debt and Bondage. In a Word, he hath a broad Plaister for your broad Sore, a deep Fountain for your deep Guilt; he is the chief of Savi∣ours for the chief of Sinners. Behold how one Deep calls to another, the Depth of thy Misery, for the Depth of his Mercy. Are your Sins and Miseries very extensive, then view the large Dimensions of his Mercy, Who can fathom the Height, the Depth, the Breadth or Length of it? As <PB N="9" REF="039983_0006_10158673919E48D0"/>for its Height, it is high as Heaven, and surmounts the highest Mountains of Guilt: It is so deep that it can bury the greatest of your Sins: It is as broad as the East is from the West: And for its Length, it is from Everlasting to Everlasting, so that it fully answers all your Wants and Miseries. In Christ there is all you need or can de∣sire; there is both. Food and Physick, Cloathing, Strength, and Cordials; O Sin∣ner, here is Blood to justify thee, and Wa∣ter to cleanse; here the Water of Life, O Believer, that will restore thy Soul again, renew thy Youth as the Eagles, cure all thy Diseases, and heal all thy Pains. In a word, you have in Christ all that can make you Good, all that can make you Great, and all that can make you Happy.</P>
<P>V. Consider how <HI>near</HI> you are to Christ and Mercy, the Remedy is prepared, and Salvation is brought to your very Door, so that you need not say, <HI>who will ascend to Heaven, to bring me down the Water of Life</HI>; for it is brought to Earth to thy Hand: You need not say, <HI>Who will roll me away the Stone from the Well Mouth</HI>? for Christ hath done it for thee, and it is now a <HI>Foun∣tain opened,</HI> and running by your Door. O it would be sad to be so near Christ, and yet eternally miss him, to perish like the Thief on the Cross with a Saviour at your Side, to be within a Step of him, and yet never touch him, yea to sink into Hell 
<PB N="10" REF="039983_0007_10158677E71FB388"/>
betwixt the outstretched Arms of his Mer∣cy, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h his sweet Calls sounding in your Ears: What a Heart-stinging Consi∣deration will this be to you in that Place of Torment for ever. O then, stir up your selves to take hold of Christ, when he is so near and in your Offer: Strive earnest∣ly, while there is an Ark prepared, and a Window opened in the Side of it, &amp; the Hand of Mercy put forth to pull in shel∣terless Doves that can find no Rest else∣where: I say, strive to come near by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wings of Faith, <HI>make your nest</HI> (at least, <HI>beside the Hole's Mouth</HI>: be not found ho∣vering without, lest the Flood wash you off from the Sides of the Ark, and ye pe∣rish miserably. If you be so foolish, you will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish eternally, that ye had never heard of Christ, or that ye had been born among the wild <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Mahometans,</HI> that never heard a Sermon.</P>
<P>VI. Consider how importunate <HI>Christ</HI> is in his <HI>Offers,</HI> and how much he presseth you to receive him: <HI>Wisdom crieth in the Streets,</HI> Prov. i. Christ makes loud and o∣pen Proclamation of himself, and ost re∣repeats his Calls, Isai. lv. 1. <HI>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, come ye, buy and eat yea come,</HI> &amp;c. Behold, how earnest he is with Sinners, that he bids them <HI>come</HI> to him three Times in one Verse, <HI>Come, Come, Come.</HI> What alluring Methods hath he 
<PB N="11" REF="039983_0007_10158677E71FB388"/>
taken to gain your Hearts? How tenderly and affectionately doth he call and court backward Souls, Isai▪ li. 4. <HI>Hearken unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, my People, give ear unto me, O my Na∣tion.</HI> What melting Expressions are these? <HI>My People My Nation.</HI></P>
<P>But, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls do not prevail, he comes himself <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eek and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave that which was lost.</HI> He came personally in the <HI>Days of his Flesh,</HI> and now he comes by his <HI>Spirit</HI> in his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Ordinances.</HI> The <HI>three wise Men</HI> came from the <HI>East</HI> a long Journey to seek Christ, but now Christ hath come from <HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>Earth,</HI> a long Journey; yea, come to every one of your <HI>Congrega∣tions</HI> to seek you: And, are ye not will∣ing to be found of him.</P>
<P>Nay, he is content to follow you, when we run away from him, and pursue you with his gracious Offers: As the <HI>Rock fol∣lowed the Israelites in the Wilderness</HI> with its running Streams of Water, so Christ our spiritual Rock follows you now with the Streams of his Mercy and Blood, to wash and save you. O Sinner, if you will not hear the Words of his Mouth, hearken to the Call of his Wounds, which are opened as so many Mouths to plead with you. He hath suffered his blessed Side to be open∣ed, that ye might look into his bleeding Heart and see it panting with Love, and also hear the sounding of his Bowels to∣wards you; Will not this prevail? Then 
<PB N="12" REF="039983_0008_10158679729B1018"/>
behold him by Faith with a heavy Cros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on his Back weighed down with your Sins, and the Curses of a broken Law following you, &amp; calling after you. Hear him knock∣ing with his nailed Hands at the Door of your Hearts, saying, Open to me poor pe∣rishing Sinner, give me Harbour in thy Heart, behold what I have suffered from Heaven, Earth and Hell for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, look what Justice hath done, look what the Devil, the <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>sews</HI> and my own Disciples have done. View my Head, my Side, my Hands and my Feet, my wound∣ed Body and my bruised Soul. O canst thou find in thy Heart to keep Christ at the Door, when thus wounded, bleeding and mangled for thee? Wilt thou let him stand all the Day long, when he hath put on his dyed Garments and red Apparel, to court thy backward Heart, and when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saying, O Sinner, if thou wilt not believe, <HI>Reach hither thy Hand and feel the Print of the Nails, yea thrust it into my pierced Side, and seel my warm bleeding Heart, and see if I love you not</HI>? Wilt thou deny him Access, who has done so much for thee?</P>
<P>Will not this prevail? Then behold him displaying his glorious Beauty &amp; Ex∣cellency before thine Eyes in a preached Gospel, to win thy Heart: Will not Mi∣nisters Commendations of him move thee Then, hear how he commends himself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>am the Rose of Sharon, and the Lilly of the

Valleys, I am the true Vine; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> good Shepherd</HI> &amp;c. And will you not believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own Report who cannot Lie? Surely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is in good Earnest with you when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kes this Course.</P>
<P>Will not this do, then hearken how mournfully he complains, when he wants Success, and passionately regrates your Fol∣ly in rejecting him. He sighs when he mentions it, Psal. lxxxi. 13. <HI>O that my Peo∣ple had hearkned unto me!</HI> He bitterly la∣ments it, Mat. xxiii. 37. <HI>O Jerusalem, Je∣rusalem, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, and ye would not!</HI> He doubles the Name to shew his tender Affection, as <HI>David</HI> when he regrates his Son <HI>Absalom, O my Son Absalom, my Son, my Son, &amp;c. How often would I have ga∣thered you under my Wings</HI>? How many an affectionate Sermon, Call and Invitation have I given you, but all to no Purpose? Shall I go through a Sea of Wrath and Blood to save you, and will ye not accept of me when I have done it? Shall I shed my Blood in vain? Shall I bear the Wrath of God, the Scorns of Men, the Terror of Death and the Curse of the Law to no Effect? Will ye still prefer your Sins be∣fore me, and hear Satan's Knocks sooner than mine.</P>
<P>Hear that compassionate Complaint, Joh. v. 40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life</HI>: As if he had said,
<Q>Why run

<P>Can he do more to win your Hearts than this? Yea, if this do not, he is pleas∣ed to expostulate the Matter with you, and lay your Danger before you. <HI>Turn∣ye, turn ye,</HI> (saith he) <HI>for why will ye die?</HI> Yea, he condescends to reason the Matter with you in a familiar Way, <HI>Come</HI> (says he) <HI>let us reason together,</HI> Isai. i. <HI>O my People, what have I done unto thee</HI>?

<P>O! saith some poor humbled Soul, <HI>I have no Right to come to Christ, for I am a great Sinner.</HI> O saith Christ, <HI>I same not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Re∣pentance.</HI></P>
<P>Objection, <HI>But I am the</HI> Chief of Sin∣ners, my Sins are red as Crimson. O! saith Christ, <HI>I can make thee white as Wool,</HI> Nay, it was my Errand into the World, to save such as thou art, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 15.</P>
<P>Objection. <HI>But I am sick and wounded, what hath Christ to do with me</HI>? O! saith Christ, it is my proper Employment to be taken up with you, for, <HI>the Whole needeth not a Physician, but they that are sick,</HI> Mat. ix.

<P>Objection, <HI>But I have heavy Burdens that weigh me down.</HI> O! saith Christ, <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest.</HI></P>
<P>Objection, <HI>But my Hand is withered, I cannot receive Christ, or any Thing, from him.</HI> Then do as the Man who had the withered Hand, obey Christ's Call, and he will enable thee to stretch out thy Hand.</P>

<P>Objection, <HI>But I shall be overcome by strong Temptations.</HI> No. saith Christ, <HI>My Grace shall be sufficient for thee.</HI></P>
<P>Objection, <HI>But</HI> (saith some poor sensi∣ble Sinner) <HI>alas! my Case is not yet touch∣ed, for it is singular; my Sins are beineus and peculiar, they are against Light, Love, Conscience, Vows, and a thousand Obligati∣ons: There is none that knows what a Sin∣ner I have been, but God, and my own Con∣science: Will Christ ever accept of such a Wretch as me</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> Art thou worse than a devilish <HI>Manasseh,</HI> or a persecuting <HI>Paul,</HI> whom Christ pitied and saved? Art thou worse than <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> who was a most no∣torious vile Wretch, yet <HI>seven</HI> Devils and an Army of Lusts could not keep Christ out of her Heart? Nay, though thy Heart were as foul and black as Hell, and thy Life did swarm with the most abominable Sins; yet Christ is both able and willing to save thee, if thou come to him. Are you worse than those in that black Cata∣logue? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 9, 10. Read and see what a sad Roll is there; and yet the A∣postle saith to the believing <HI>Corinthians,</HI> Verse 11. <HI>Such were some of you, yet ye are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>shed,</HI> &amp;c. The Blood of Christ is a pow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ul Fountain, and is able to wash away <PB N="19" REF="039983_0011_10158680B2E61EF0"/>the greatest Sins that ever were com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ted, be they never so black or bloody: God gave full Proof of this, by the first Sin we read of, that was cleansed by this Blood, after it was shed, even the Murder of the Son of God, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 36, 38. This was the most prodigious Wickedness that ever the Sun saw; (yea, the Sun fainted at the Sight, as afraid to look on it) for suppose a Man were able to pull Heaven and Earth to Pieces, destroy the Angels, and murder all Mankind, he would not contract so monstrous a Guilt, as those did in crucifying the Son of God, whose Per∣son was infinitely Superior to the whole Creation: Yet Thousands that were Act∣ors in this black Tragedy, were washed by this Blood, to give us a convincing <HI>Experiment</HI> of its <HI>infinite Value</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> and that no Sin or Guilt whatsoever was too strong for it; <HI>The Blood of Christ</HI> (saith <HI>John,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> i. 7.) <HI>cleansoth us from all Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Objection, <HI>But tho' Christ's Blood be sufficient, yet I have no Right to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> Be what you will, you have a full and sufficient Warrant from the Gos∣pel Call to flee to it. See what Christ en∣joins his Apostles, to do, Mark xvi. 15. <HI>Go into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature, q. d.</HI> <Q>Make Offer of my Blood to all without Distinction, even to the worst of Sinners, every Creature, be they never so wicked; yea, tho' they <PB REF="039983_0012_10158682D6E269E8"/>have sinned themselves into the Like∣ness of Beasts or Devils, yet, if they be Creatures, offer my Blood, my Mercy, and Meri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to them: Invite and press them to come unto me, <HI>and him that cometh, I will in no wise cast out.</HI></Q> O Sinner! accept of the Gospel-Offer, and whatever you have been, you shall find there is Mercy enough in God's Bowels to pity you, Merit enough in Christ's Blood to purchase a Pardon for you, and Prevalency enough in his Inter∣cession to procure and apply it to you.</P>
<P>Objection, <HI>But I have often slighted the Gospel Offer, and trampled on this precious Blood, with what Confidence can I claim it</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> Since Christ doth not exclude you, you ought not to exclude your self; but should reckon that you have the great∣er Need to hasten to this Blood, the more heinous that your Sins be; yea, you have a peculiar Ground to plead upon for Par∣don by it. See how <HI>David</HI> pleads it, Psa. xxv. 11. <HI>Pardon mine Iniquity</HI>; Why? <HI>for it is great</HI>; This would be a strange Argument with Men, Pardon my Crime, for it is great; but it is a strong Argument with God, <HI>Lord, it is great,</HI> and so I have the more Need of Pardon: <HI>It is great,</HI> and so thou wilt have the greater Honour in pardoning me, even as a Physician hath in curing a desperate Disease. The sinning against Christ's Blood, or slighting it, is <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages" DISP="〈2 pages missing〉"/> <PB N="23" REF="039983_0013_10158684843A2B28"/>yea, saved some at the <HI>last Hour,</HI> particu∣larly the Thief on the Cross, whom the Devil thought he was sure of, having drawn him the Length of the Mouth of Hell, just ready to cast him in; yet even then, upon his looking to Christ, did the Arms of Mercy catch hold of him.</P>
<P>What more can'st thou object, O Sinner? Hath not Christ provided <HI>Answers</HI> to all thou can'st say, either against thy self or him? Hath he not given unanswerable <HI>Demonstrations</HI> of his <HI>Ability, Fulness, Fit∣ness</HI> and <HI>Willingness</HI> to be thy <HI>Saviour</HI>? Hath he not given full Proof of his earnest Desire to save thee, by the many <HI>Methods</HI> he takes to prevail with Sinners to accept of him? Will not all the Pains he hath hitherto taken prevail with thy obstinate Heart? What more would you have Christ to do with unwilling Sinners? There is yet one Step further he makes, and that is a very low one; he even, as it were, turns a humble Supplicant to thee, and upon his bare Knees beseeches thee to be re∣conciled to him: Read 2 Cor. v. 20. <HI>We are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's Stead, be ye reconciled to God.</HI> O wonder∣ful Condescension! Behold Divine Mer∣cy kneeling down to a Sinner in the hum∣blest Polture, with wringed Hands and watry Cheeks, importuning the Sinner to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ceive his <HI>Saviour,</HI> accept of his <HI>Pardon,</HI> <PB N="24" REF="039983_0014_10158686A33CEB78"/>save his <HI>Soul,</HI> and be <HI>reconciled to God in Christ. Be astonisht O Heavens!</HI> Shall the <HI>Sovereign Creator</HI> turn <HI>Supplicant</HI> to the <HI>vile Traitor,</HI> and follow him with his <HI>Re∣mission</HI>? Or, the <HI>loving Father</HI> to the <HI>prodigal Child,</HI> and follow him with <HI>In∣treaties</HI>? And, O Sinner! will thy stub∣born Heart be able to refuse <HI>Peace,</HI> or slight the blessed <HI>Peace maker Jesus Christ,</HI> after all this <HI>Pains</HI>? If all his <HI>Arguments</HI> prevail nothing, yet one would think, that <HI>the humble Intreaties of the Great GOD</HI> will certainly do it: How can you resist these?</P>
<P>Objection, <HI>I have no Strength to come to Christ, I cannot believe of my self, I have a dead and hard Heart, and I cannot help it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Can'st thou say in good Ear∣nest, that thou art willing and desirous to embrace a <HI>Saviour,</HI> if thou wert able? Alas! it is here that it sticks; whatever you pretend, you are not truly willing: It is our Unwillingness that ruins us: It is not so much for Want of Power (tho' indeed we want it) as Want of Will, that Sinners want Christ: Were you once willing, Strength would not be wanting. O to get the Will conquered and made to surrender to Christ, then the Day were won! O for one Pull more from <HI>Omnipotent Grace,</HI> to make you <HI>a willing People in the Day of God's Power.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Labour for a deep Sense of thy own <PB N="25" REF="039983_0014_10158686A33CEB78"/>Impotency, take your dead Heart and lay it before God, and lie groaning in Christ's Way, and plead for Pity: It is true, God is not bound in strict Justice, to hear an Unbeliever's Prayer, but if you be earnest with him, you may expect he will do it out of his great Goodness and Mercy: <HI>He hears the Ravens when they cry</HI>; O then! Cry to him to your utmost Ability, in a deep Sense of Want: Be as earnest seek∣ing <HI>Faith,</HI> as your <HI>daily Bread</HI>: Cry as fervently for the <HI>Life</HI> of your <HI>Souls,</HI> as ye would do for the <HI>Life</HI> of your <HI>Bodies,</HI> if ready to be executed: If ye would do so, God would not deny you. More parti∣cularly plead these Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take your Bible, kneel down, and cast up that gracious free Promise, <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 26, 27. Read it, and plead it, put thy Finger to it, and put the Maker of it to his Word; lay thy dead Heart before it, and look up and cry, <HI>Lord, make good this Word to me, is it not a free Promise</HI>? There is no Condition required of me for getting it fulfilled, but <HI>to inquire of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> for doing it, <HI>Verse</HI> 37. Now Lord, I am come to enquire and request thee to do it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Humbly plead thy own <HI>Impotency,</HI> and the <HI>Insufficiency</HI> of all others to help the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this State. This was the impotent Man's Plea with Christ at the Pool of <HI>Bethesda, Job.</HI> v. 6, 7. It had good Success with him, and so may it have with you: Say, 
<Q><PB N="26" REF="039983_0015_1015868951320DC8"/>
Lord I have lien many Years with this dead plagued Heart, beside the open Fountain of thy Blood, that has saved many in my Condition, I am impotent and unable to move to it of my self, and have none to put me in: I have tryed others, but I find it altogether in vain, Ordinances cannot do it, Sacraments cannot do it, Ministers cannot do it, the loudest Knock or Call will not do it: Thou, Lord, must put to thy helping Hand, or it cannot be done, for it is a Work peculiar to thy Almighty Arm: I have been looking to all others for Help, but, Lord, there is none in Hea∣ven or Earth but Thee alone: Every one of the Creatures, Means and Ordi∣nances say, it is not in me: Every one of the Saints and Angels say, as the King of <HI>Israel</HI> did to that poor starving Wo∣man, 2 Kings vi 27. <HI>If the Lord do not help thee, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shall I help thee</HI>? So, if thou Lord help me not, I must perish.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. In a deep Sense of your own <HI>Impo∣tency,</HI> flee to God's <HI>Power</HI> and plead it: Do you feel the <HI>Ammon, Moah</HI> and <HI>Mount Seir</HI> of your own Corruptions swelling within you, say with <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> 2 Chron. xx. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>We have no Might against this great Company, neither know we what to do, but our Eyes are upon thee.</HI> If you could come this Length, then were there good Ground of Hope, for when we see that we are <PB N="27" REF="039983_0015_1015868951320DC8"/>wholly helpless and shiftless in our selves, then God's Help is nearest; <HI>When I am weak</HI> (saith the Apostle, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 10.) <HI>then am I strong.</HI> Renounce then all Help in the Creature, and look to the Creator, say, Lord, tho' it be impossible with Man, yet thou hast told me, Mar. 10. 27. <HI>That with thee all things are possible</HI>: Tho' I may despair of all Help in my selt and others, yet thou hast forbid me to despair of Help in thee, therefore I flee to thee alone. <HI>Lord, give what thou commandest, and then command what thou wilt.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Plead thy extream Need of Christ, and of Faith to give thee an Interest in him. The World cannot tell thee, O Sinner, how great thy Need is, there is not a starving Man that needs Meat, a wounded Man that needs a Physician, a Ship-wrack'd Man that needs a Plank, a dying Man with the Dive-ratling in his Thicat, that needs Breath so much as thou need'st Christ. What wilt thou do on a Death-bed, or at a Tribunal, without an Interest in him? And, what will become of thee to all E∣ternity? Go to him then, and leek Faith in Christ, as a Malefactor going to die would do his Life, fall down at his Feet, and cry, <Q>Give me Faith and Strength to carry me to Christ's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or else I die: I may live without Friends, Wealth, Ho∣nours and Pleasures, but I cannot live without Faith: I am lost, undone, a dead <PB N="28" REF="039983_0016_1015868BF23CF640"/>Man, and I perish for ever without it. Lord, deny me what thou wilt, but deny me not Faith. It had been better for me never to have been born, than to live without Christ and an Interest in him: If I come not to the Fountain of Christ's Blood, I shall sink eternally in that scald∣ing Lake of Fire and Brimstone: If I go to Christ's Table without Faith, I shall shed his Blood, and eat and drink my own Damnation.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. Plead with God, how easy it is for him to help thee; cry with the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> Psal, lxxx. 1. <HI>O thou that dwellest between the Cherubims, shine forth.</HI> It will cost thee no more Pains to work Faith in me, and do all that I desire, than it doth the <HI>Sun to shine forth:</HI> Yea, thou can it more easily put forth thy Power and Grace, than the <HI>Sun</HI> can dart out its <HI>Beams</HI> It is no Trouble nor Loss to the <HI>Sun to shine forth</HI>; so neither will it be to thee to thew thy Power and Mercy: A Look or Touch from thee would do it, a little Thing will save a drowning Man: Lord suffer me not to perish, when it is so easy for thee to pre∣vent it. Were it any Loss or Trouble for God to help us, we might well doubt of it; but since it is none, we may cry with Hope, Lord grant such an hungry Beggar an Alms out of the Ocean of thy Bounty, for thou wilt never miss it. As the <HI>Sun,</HI> the more it shines, displays its Glory the <PB N="29" REF="039983_0016_1015868BF23CF640"/>more; so thou wilt gain Glory, by put∣ting forth thy Power to help such a Help∣less Creature as I am.</P>
<P>Objection, <HI>But I have often looked and cried to him for Help, but alas, I am such a grievous Sinner he doth not answer me, un∣less it be with a Frown.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. It may be there is some Idol or Sin still harboured, that thou art not willing to part with. This may be the <HI>Achan</HI> in the Camp that causeth the Lord to hide his Face, search for it, and cast out the <HI>accursed Thing, let not thine Eye pity it, neither do thou spare it.</HI> If thou canst not find it, go humbly to God and cry, <HI>Shew me, Lord, wherefore thou contendest with me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It may be thou art not fervent enough, God keeps the Door bolted that you may be provoked to knock the harder, Matth. vii. 7. <HI>Ask and it shall be given, seek,</HI> &amp;c. In that one Verse you have three Calls to Fervency, not only <HI>Ask</HI> but <HI>Seek,</HI> not only <HI>Seek</HI> but <HI>Knock</HI>▪ The Woman of <HI>Canaan</HI> readily took up the Meaning of Christ's refusing to answer her, she turns the more Fervent and Importunate, and so gets all her Will.</P>
<P N="3">3. Resolve whatever Discouragement you meet with, you will never quit the Throne of Grace, but you will always lay your self in Christ's Way, and never look to another for Help; yea that you <PB N="30" REF="039983_0017_1015868D87EA5A18"/>will die waiting on him: Remember the <HI>Psalmist</HI>'s Experience, Psal. xl. 1. <HI>I wait∣ed patiently for the Lord, and at length he inclined his Ear, and heard my Cry:</HI> There was never any yet that waited on him, had cause to be ashamed. You may meet with many Discouragements and Tempta∣tions, and be put to very sad Thoughts, but you must be resolute in looking to Christ for Help, come what will; and in Imitation of the <HI>four Lepers at the Seige of Samaria,</HI> reason with your self, if I live at a Distance from Christ, I shall infallibly perish, there is no Hope for me; if Christ pity me not when I am waiting on him, I shall but perish, but yet there is Hope he will have Pity at length; there∣fore if I perish, I'll perish at Christ's Foot∣stool, looking up to him, where never one yet perish'd, and I hope he will not let me be the first.</P>
<P N="4">4. Make use of Arguments in pleading with him.</P>
<P N="1">1. Plead the Freeness of his Mercy; it needs no Motive, and expects no Worth, but <HI>whosoever will, let him come and take the Water of Life freely,</HI> it runs freely, so that Mountains cannot stop the current of it, more than Rocks can stop the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea. <Q>Indeed, Lord, if Sin and Unworthiness could stop Mercy, I might despair, for I am as un∣worthy a Creature as ever the Sun shin∣ed <PB N="31" REF="039983_0017_1015868D87EA5A18"/>upon, but blessed be God, Grace is free.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Plead Christ's Commission, <HI>Isai.</HI> lxi. 1. He was sent <HI>to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Prison Doors to them that are bound:</HI> Lord, here a poor Prisoner, a frozen, locked, bound up Heart: Here is Employment for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Loose me, Knock off my Fetters, and <HI>lying my Soul out of Prison.</HI> Thou hast all Fulne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dwelling in thee, and thou hast it given thee to bestow on such miserable Objects as I am; Lord here a naked Back for thee to cover, an empty Stomach for thee to fill, a wounded Soul for thee to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Lord thou camest to seek and save that which was lost,</HI> and wilt thou not be found of a lost Sinner that is seeking thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. Plead the Communicativeness of his Mercy to others: He had Compassion upon Men's Bodies while he was on Earth, even the Bodies of wicked Men, such as the unthankful Lepers, he let none of them go without healing that came to him; say, <HI>Lord</HI> did thou shew so much Compassion to diseased Bodies, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t thou not have some Pity on my dying Soul that is far more Precious than C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ca∣ses of Clay.—Plead his Compassion that he hath shewed to the worst of Sinners, such as <HI>Manassch, Mary Magdalen, Paul,</HI> and those who murdered him.—Plead his Compassion towards the finally Obstinate, <PB N="32" REF="039983_0018_1015868FAFB6FB28"/>and Impenitent, such as <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> over which he wept, <HI>Luke</HI> xix. Lord, did thy Heart melt with Pity to such, and wilt thou not pity a humbled Sinner, that confesseth Sin and would fain be reconcil∣ed to God: Is not Mercy the Work thou delightes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in? <HI>Mic.</HI> vii. 18.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Labour for a Sense of the Misery of a Christless State, of your great Need of Christ, and of the Happiness of being <HI>found in him,</HI> and in a Sense thereof, look to Christ and make a trial to take hold of him, stir up your self to it, and rest your Soul on him as you can, and God will help you and communicate Strength. He will not fail to notice and encourage an honest Attempt, Jer. xxx. 21. <HI>Who is this that engageth his Heart to approach to me</HI>? He will pity and help such. If you cannot apply Christ to your selves and say, <HI>He is mine,</HI> yet apply your self to Christ and say, <HI>I would fain be thine,</HI> yea I am resolved to be thine. Go forth to Christ with all the Faith you can arrive at, say with the poor Man, <HI>Lord I believe, help thou my Unbelief.</HI> You must not sit still and do nothing, but use all Means in your Power, for it is in the Use of these that God works Faith; hoise up the Sails and wait for the Gales.</P>
