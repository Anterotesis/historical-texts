<HEAD>Trial of <HI>David M'Lean,</HI> for High Treason.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>QUEBEC, <DATE>July 11.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ON Friday last came on before a special court of Oyer and Ter∣miner, the trial of David M'Lean for high treason; the indictment was o∣pened by Mr. Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and the case stated by the Attorney General. Af∣ter the evidence for the crown was closed, the prisoner desired to be heard in his own defence—which was granted. He began by thanking the court for the indulgence he had re∣ceived, and after a short address to the Jury on the subject of his inno∣cence, he turned round and began to harrangue the audience; hereupon he was interrupted by the Chief Jus∣tice who informed him that a patient hearing should be given to whatever he might have to urge, but that it should be addressed to the court or jury, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.

Mr. Pyke and Mr. Franklyn, who had been assigned, were then heard for the prisoner; but they cal∣led for no witnesses. The Attorney General made a very able reply, in which he commented on the prisoner's indiscretion in attempting his own defence, and clearly refuted all the pretexts he had set up, to the convic∣tion of every body. The evidence was then summed up by the Chief Justice, who observed, that most of the overt acts charged, which were fourteen in number had been proved by three or four witnesses; many of whom (which was rarely the case in prosecutions of
<PB N="5" REF="048170_0004_1024EAA0392AAC90"/>
this sort) were not at all implicated in the crime.</P>
<P>The Jury, after being out about half an hour returned with the ver∣dict of GUILTY—The prisoner up∣on being asked what he had to say, why judgment of death should not be passed upon him, referred to his counsel, who moved two law points in arrest of judgment, which were answered by the Attorney General, and overruled by the court. The prisoner was again asked if he had any thing further to say, and answer∣ing nothing, the Chief Justice pro∣ceeded to give sentence, as nearly as we could collect it, to the following effect:</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="sentence">
<OPENER><SALUTE>DAVID M'LEAN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>You have been indicted for the crime of High Treason, to which in∣dictment you plead "not Guilty," and for your trial put yourself on God and the country, by which coun∣try you are found Guilt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. You have been tried by a respectable and in∣telligent Jury, many of whom have heretofore served on the grand In∣quest.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="048170_0005_1024EAAA480DC480"/>Your trial has been attended with such circumstances of fairness, open∣ness and lenity, as are not obtained in any country upon earth except where the laws of England prevail. More than twenty days have elapsed since you were acquainted with the particulars of the charge brought a∣gainst you, and of the names of the witnesses to prove it, that you might not be surprised by a sudden accusa∣tion, and might have full time to prepare your defence. After the facts charged were fully established by the verdict, your counsel have been heard on every objection that could be brought to the regularity of the proceedings; had you been ac∣cused of the like crime in that coun∣try, whose government you would wish to impose on this province, in∣stead of being allowed a period of 20 days, you might have been char∣ged, convicted and executed in less than so many minutes ,—Reflect, therefore whether you have not been guilty of a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> unjust attempt a∣gainst this government.</P>
<P>It appears in evidence that you are an al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en to the king's government;
<PB N="7" REF="048170_0006_1024EAADA2BF8200"/>
notwithstanding which you have been treated with the same indulgence as tho you had been a native subject. true it is, that a treaty of Amity sub∣sists between his majesty's subjects and the citizens of the United States, many of whom have borne public testimony to the kindly offices receiv∣ed from the king's subjects—It is an intercourse we wish to cherish, as well with public bodies as with individu∣als; and as it is not probable that you personally have received an in∣jury from this colony—you have been guilty of an unprovoked attempt a∣gainst this government.</P>
<P>Having heard of some disturbances that were excited on account of the road bill, you falsely concluded that his majesty's Canadian subjects were disaffected to government and ready to join in a rebellion, which you were willing to conduct. You might have known that it is easy to provoke murmers on a like occasion, in the best regulated states. In England similar discontents take place and subside as in this country—for a short experience has convinced the people that the measure was greatly

for their benefit. Putting conse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence out of the question, as a prudent man, you had no ground to go upon. No one therefore, but a rash and an un∣principled character would have en∣gaged in so desperate an enterprize, and no one but a cruel and inhuman character would have projected such measures to carry it into execution. Consider, then▪ whether you have not been guilty of a most atrocious and sanguinary attempt against this gov∣ernment.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may think that these terms favor a spirit of reproach—far from it—in your pitiable condition to betray such a temper were very unworthy. No, they are utttered in the spirit of admonition, and that up∣on this principle: You seem to pos∣sess a good understanding; I with therefore, to fasten on your mind, the persuasion of this manifest truth, which nothing but the most perverse obstinacy can resist, namely, that tho your designs were most hostile against this government, yet you have expe∣rienced that fair trial you would not have met with in any other govern∣ment under heaven—In hopes, that
<PB N="9" REF="048170_0008_1024EABA4173CBB0"/>
when the mist of delusion shall have disappeared, the conviction of one truth, may prepare your mind for the admission of others, and finally pro∣duce that sense of contrition and re∣morse, which can alone expiate your dangerously wicked crimes. Had your traiteros project been carried into execution, who is there in this numerous audience that would not have felt the consequence among his friends and relations, or in his own person? But as it has pleased Provi∣dence to baffle your pernicious de∣signs, I shall press the subject no further.</P>
<P>This government, which you wish to overthrow, has like all others pro∣vided for its security against those that wish to destroy it. In the scru∣tiny of offences it is more lenient than others, but it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> equally severe in the punishm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat punish∣ment you have justly incurred, and it would be highly uncharitable to beguile you with the expectation that it will not be inflicted. Let me therefore, most seriously exhort you to employ the short time you have to live, in submitting yourself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith hu∣miliation
<PB N="10" REF="048170_0009_1024EAC14670B268"/>
and repentance to the su∣preme ruler of all things, whose goodness is equal to his power, and who, tho you suffer here, may admit you to his everlasting mercy hereafter. That such may be your portion is my most earnest prayer.</P>
<P>It remains that I should discharge the painful duty of pronouncing the sentence of the law, which is: That you, David M'Lean, be taken to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execu∣tion, where you must be hanged by the neck, but not till you are dead, for you must be cut down alive, and your bowels be taken out and burnt before your face: then your head must be severed from your body, which must be divided in four parts, and your head and quarters be at the King's disposal; and the Lord have mercy on your soul.</P>

<P>The trial lasted from 7 o'clock in the morning till nine in the evening.</P>

by Adet the late French mi∣nister at Philadelphia, to carry letters to some disaffected gentlemen, to in∣cite them to revolt against the go∣vernment of the province, with a promise of being assisted very shortly with a naval force. He was charged also with commissions for those who were to take the lead; several of whom are apprehended and now in confinement. On the 21st of July he was brought from prison to the Grand Square, the whole garrison were under arms—two executioners attended,—he declared that he was innocent of any attempt to disturb the peace of the government, and did not know that the letters he had been employed to carry for Adet were of that tendency; he prayed about five minutes and then gave the signal that he was ready. He was drawn up the gallows by a pulley, and let down again in a few minutes, when the o∣ther executioner proceeded to quarter him, which began by cutting a large incision in his left side and taking out his heart, which was thrown into a fire kindled under the gallows for the purpose; he was then cut into four quarters in a shocking and

butchering manner; his head was severed from his body and stuck on a pole, was fixed to the top of one of the Bastions of St. Louis—his quar∣ters were permitted to be buried the next day. Thus fell an unfortunate man, a dupe to French artifice. He was about 30 years of age, a native of Airshire in Scotland.</P>
