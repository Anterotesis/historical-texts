<L>If a corpse, Moses, can run away.</L>

<L>The parish will chide,</L>
<L>For keeping them out in cold weather:</L>
<L>Then, Mozy, quoth he,</L>
<L>Pray tell'em from me,</L>
<L>I'll bury them warm, all together.</L>

<LG>
<L>But, sir, it rains hard,</L>

<L>Regard, Moses! that makes me stay;</L>
<L>For no corpse, young or old,</L>
<L>In the rain can catch cold,</L>
<L>But, Moses, faith, you or I may.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Moses begg'd to be gone,</L>

<L>Please to rise, and I'll lend you my hand;—</L>
<L>'Tis hard, quoth the vicar,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length, though sore troubled,</L>
<L>To church-yard he hobbled,</L>
<L>Lamenting the length of the way;</L>
<L>For, Moses, quoth he,</L>
<L>Were I bishop, d'ye see,</L>
<L>I neither need walk, preach, nor pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When he came to the grave,</L>
<L>Says he, Moses—a stave;—</L>
<L>Lord, where's my tobacco box hid?</L>
<L>I protest this fast walking</L>

<PB N="72" REF="020996_0072_0FB20720AB2C1FC0"/>
<L>Then he open'd his book,</L>
<L>And therein seem'd to look,</L>
<L>Whilst o'er the page only he squinted;</L>
<L>Crying, Moses, I'm vex'd,</L>
<L>For I can't see the text,</L>
<L>This book is so damnably printed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Woman of a man born—</L>
<L>No—that's wrong—the leaf's torn;—</L>

<L>The world would run wild,</L>

<L>How wonderful are our supposes!—</L>
<L>What midwife would do it?</L>

<L>So, Moses, come forth,</L>

<L>And dust to dust, dust it away;</L>
<L>For, Moses I trust,</L>
<L>We should soon turn to dust,</L>
<L>If we were not to moister our clay,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Moses, hear what I say,</L>
<L>When 'tis night, 'tis not day.</L>
<L>Now in former times, saints could work miracles</L>
<L>And raise from the dead</L>
<L>There's no more to be said—</L>
<L>For, Moses, I've dropt down my spectacles.</L>
