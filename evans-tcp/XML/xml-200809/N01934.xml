<HEAD>A Memorial Relating to the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians.</HEAD>
<P>THAT my often speaking the same things, may not be gravaminous; I humbly offer my Sentiments about sending a Military Force against the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians, in Writing.</P>
<P>IT is Resolved that the Government has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>cient Reason to prose∣cute the <HI>Eastern Indians</HI> for their Rebellion. But I am humbly of Opinion, that sufficient Enquiry has not bee<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made, Whether the Government has done all that is necessary on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r part, to prevent a Rupture.</P>
<P>AT the Conference of his Excellency with the Sachems, and Chief Men of the <HI>Eastern Indians,</HI> at <HI>George-Town</HI> on <HI>Arrowsick</HI> Island, <HI>August,</HI> 9. 1717. The Indians shewed a great Reluctancy against Erecting Forts higher up the River; and against the arrival of a Multitude of New Inhabitants; lest they should prove unable heartily to embrace them. They also desired the Running of a Line between the <HI>English,</HI> and them; and made some Proposals on their part, which were rejected: but no Proposals for fixing Boundaries, were offered to them.</P>
<P>WITHOUT doubt, Boundaries are necessary for the preservation of Honesty and Peace among those that border one upon another. This is evident from the Law made for the Renewing of them between Townships once in three Years time, successively; and the penalty of Five Pounds inflicted on those, who shall neglect their Duty herein.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002292_0002_0FDB1BF993645EE8"/>THE Royal Charter gives a good Account of the Errand of <HI>English</HI> Christians into this New World, in the Words following; — <Q>And to dispose of matters and things, whereby Our Subjects, Inhabi∣tants of Our said Province, may be religiously, peaceably, and civilly, governed, protected, and defended; so as their good Life, and Or∣derly Conversation, may Win the <HI>Indians,</HI> Natives of the Country, to the Knowledge and Obedience of the only True GOD, and Saviour of Mankind, and the Christian Faith: Which His Royal Majesty, Our Royal Grand-father, King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, in His said Letters Patents, Declared was His Royal Intention, and the adventurers free Profession, to be the principal End of the said <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</Q></P>
<P>BY this Momentous clause in our Charter, the Government is Obli∣ged, and excited, to doe what in them lyes, to Recover the Aboriginal Natives from their Heathenisme, and Antichristianisme.</P>
<P>OUR Blessed Saviour's Method of Conversion was, To Heal the Bodies of Men and Women, in order to His entire, and Eternal Salva∣tion of them. This constrains me to think, that it is Necessary to state and settle plain and lasting Bounds between the <HI>English,</HI> and the <HI>Indians;</HI> that so the Natives may have a certain and establish'd Enjoyment of their O<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Country: and that the <HI>English</HI> may have DEUS NOBISCUM Legibly embroidered in their Banners.</P>
<P>THE History of the War between the <HI>Israelites,</HI> and their Brethren the <HI>Benjamites,</HI> is very awfull. The <HI>Israelites</HI> had a vast Army: Four Hundred Thousand Fighting Men; the <HI>Benjamites</HI> had only Twenty Six Thousand, and Seven Hundred: And yet the <HI>Benjamites</HI> (the Flameable causes of the War) Slew Forty Thousand Men of the <HI>Israelites.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Omne prius tentandum est —</HI></P>
<P>AND if, at last, we should be provoked to goe against our Neigh∣bours, the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians; 'twould be convenient for this Go∣vernment first to sit down, and count the Cost. Many Thousands of Pounds have been already expended on this Controversy. If the War proceed, and be prospered; the <HI>English</HI> may, probably, drive
<PB N="3" REF="002292_0003_0FDB1BFB23FF1E50"/>the <HI>Indians</HI> from their ancient Habitation: Yet 'tis improbable the <HI>English</HI> should slay them, or take them Captives. In all likelihood, the Survivours will fly away to <HI>Cannada.</HI> And if a War should happen between <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> these Fugitives would solicit the Assistance of the <HI>French,</HI> in returning to their Country (which they are very fond of) though it should be never so much to the Loss and Damage of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>SO that I am humbly of Opinion, 'Twould be most Honourable, and most Profitable, for this Province, to perswade the <HI>Kennebeck</HI> Indians to be our Dependents and Friends, by Really convincing them, it is their True Interest so to be; as indeed it is.</P>
<P>WHICH is humbly submitted to his Excellency the Gover∣nour, the Honourable Council and Representatives, in General Court assembled.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a LETTER from the Reverend Mr. <HI>Solomon Stoddard.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>North-Hampton;</HI> <DATE><HI>March.</HI> 10. 1720/21</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>—IN our Charter, and also in the Charter of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> the King says, That the Undertakers do profess it to be their principal Design, to bring the <HI>Indians</HI> to the Christian Faith.</P>
<P>I am afraid Whether we doe not provoke GOD, by our Neglect of Prosecuting that Design. Somthing has been done at the Cost of Benefactors in <HI>England:</HI> but, very little at the Charge of the Country. — I am never like to see my Friends in <HI>Boston</HI> any more; but I often Remember them, and am a Well-willer to them, and particularly, to your self.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Solomon Stoddard.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
