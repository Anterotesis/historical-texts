<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> Editor is happy that after having taken great pains, and having spared neither trouble nor ex∣pense, he is able to present his friends and the public with the largest and (he believes) the best collection of songs ever pub∣lished in this country.</P>
<P>As it frequently happens that collections of this kind abound with ribaldry and indecency, the greatest attention has been paid, that nothing of that tendency should he admitted into this selection, so that the cautious parent, friend or preceptor may present this book as an agreeable companion to the social mind.</P>
<P>In the Masonic collection he has been able by the help of a variety of books and the kind assistance of friends, to form what he hopes will prove an agreeable companion to his brethren in ge∣neral; he assures them that he has taken great care in selec∣ting, that none but such as are genuine should be admitted. He has taken the liberty of adding at the end of the volume, the celebrated and much admired tale of <HI>"Mons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Tonson,"</HI> which he doubts not will be acceptable, and which he conceives not improper to insert in a collection of this kind.</P>
<P>If on the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> should, after an ingenuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ex∣amination be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, the wishes of the Editor will be fully gratified, and he will feel an inward satisfaction which none but a grateful heart can experience, with this hope it is most respectfully submitted to the public for their patronage and protection.</P>

<L>And drink a few bottles of gooseberry wine."</L>
<L>Derry down.</L>

<LG>
<L>Then Moses was plac'd in the chair in a trice,</L>
<L>And Aaron his crony deputed his Vice;</L>
<L>When the glass moving quick, and the wine being strong,</L>
<L>Moses swore they shou'dn't stir till they'd each sung a song.</L>

<LG>
<L>Some looked askew sir, at first Moses saw,</L>
<L>But whate'er Moses said, why you know sir, was law;</L>

<L>Little David it seems sir, first was the choice,</L>
<L>For they very well knew he'd an excellent voice;</L>
<L>But he vow'd he cou'dn't sing, they swore 'twas a thumper.</L>

<Q>We sailed so plagued slow, that a big storm overtook us—To be sure I didn't swallow a little of the sea broth—but the worst of my misfortunes was, when I landed there was Molly McGree! and she put into my arms a grate ugly squalling brat, with a head as big as a bushel of potatoes—what's this? says I— 'Tis your own Teddy, says she, and as like ye as two peas.— Teddy be d—d, says I, toke it away, woman; I tell ye I don't know any thing at all of the matter.</Q>

<L>I WAS press'd while a rowing so happy—</L>
<L>No matter, 'twas childish to grieve;</L>
<L>So to drown care with grog I got nappy,</L>
<L>Yet sigh'd my sweet Kitty to leave;</L>
<L>But what hurt me most were those ninnies,</L>
<L>On whom I had thought to depend,</L>
<L>For I wish'd to raise Kate a few guineas,</L>
<L>But found I had got ne'er a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When aboard, why I troubled a shipmate</L>
<L>A note to my sweetheart to write,</L>
<L>Which in doing he somehow a slip made,</L>
<L>His own tale of love did indite!</L>
<L>So when I at Battersea landed,</L>
<L>(He'd patter'd her so to his end)</L>
<L>I learnt he my frigate commanded,</L>
<L>And found I had got ne'er a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When again on the salt seas in motion,</L>
<L>The ill-humour'd winds loudly roar,</L>
<L>And friendship I found on the ocean,</L>
<L>As scant as I left it on shore:</L>
<L>We were wreck'd—but my tale little matters,</L>
<L>While messmates to Davy descend,</L>
<L>I escap'd but was poor, all in tatters,</L>
<L>And found I had got ne'er a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still to all fear was I stranger,</L>
<L>In battle (where death tips the grin)</L>
<L>Was expos'd to the heat of each danger,</L>
<L>'Till a musket-ball splinter'd my fin:</L>
<L>Well, away to the cock-pit I hobble,</L>
<L>Where so many customers tend,</L>
<L>Then the surgeon, to save further trouble,</L>
<L>Lopp'd it off, damme,—not like a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now ev'ry comfort's imparted,</L>
<L>I find, I laid in Greenwich snug dock,</L>
<L>My messmates are true, honest hearted,</L>
<L>And each wishes well to Ben Block:</L>

<L>YE sons of fair Science, impatient to learn,</L>
<L>What's meant by a Mason you here may discern;</L>
<L>He strengthens the weak, he gives light to the blind,</L>
<L>And the naked he clothes—is a friend to mankind.</L>
<L>All shall yield to Masonry,</L>
<L>Bend to thee</L>
<L>Blest Masonry,</L>

<L>He walks on the Level of Honour and Truth,</L>
<L>And spurns the trite passions of folly and youth;</L>
<L>The Compass and Square all his frailties reprove,</L>
<L>And his ultimate object is Brotherly Love.</L>

<LG>
<L>The temple of Knowledge he nobly doth raise,</L>

<L>When rear'd and adorn'd, Strength and Beauty unite,</L>
<L>And he views the fair structure with conscious delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With fortitude bless'd, he's a stranger to fears,</L>
<L>And govern'd by Prudence, he cautiously steers,</L>
<L>Till Temperance shews him the port of Content,</L>
<L>And Justice unask'd, gives the sign of consent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Inspir'd by his feelings, he bounty imparts,</L>
<L>For Charity ranges at large in our hearts;</L>
<L>And an indigent brother reliev'd from his woes,</L>
<L>Feels a pleasure inferior to him who bestows.</L>

<L>In solemn pace I was led up,</L>

<L>The guardian of this mystic charm,</L>

<L>And scarce a lamp display'd a twinkling light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Around this place there liv'd the num'rous clans,</L>
<L>Of honest, plodding, foreign Artizans;</L>
<L>Known at that time by name of Refugees,</L>
<L>The rod of persecution from their home,</L>
<L>Compell'd the inoffensive race to roam;</L>
<L>And here they lighted, like a swarm of Bees.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well! our two friends were saunt'ring thro' the street,</L>
<L>In hopes some food for humour soon to meet;</L>
<L>When in a window near, a light they view,</L>
<L>And tho' a dim and melancholy ray,</L>
<L>It seem'd the prologue to some merry play;</L>
<L>So tow'rds the gloomy dome our hero drew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="67" REF="033983_0280_0FF9E92D6C32E160"/>
<L>Strait at the door he gave a thund'ring knock,</L>
<L>(The time we may suppose near two o'clock;)</L>
<L>"I'll ask" says King, "if Thompson lodges here,"</L>
<L><HI>"Thompson"</HI> cries t'other, "who the devil's he,"</L>
<L>"I know not" King replies, "but want to see</L>
<L>"What kind of animal will now appear."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>After some time a little Frenchman came,</L>
<L>One hand display'd a rush-light's trembling flame;</L>
<L>The other held a thing they call <HI>Culotte,</HI></L>
<L>An old strip'd woolen night-cap grac'd his head,</L>
<L>A tatter'd waistcoat o'er one shoulder spread;</L>
<L>Scarce half awake, he heav'd a yawning note.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Though thus untimely rous'd, he courteous smil'd,</L>
<L>And soon addressed our wag in accents mild;</L>
<L>Bending his head politely to his knee,</L>
<L>"Pray, Sare, vat vant you, dat you come so late?</L>
<L>"I beg your pardon sare, to make you vate;</L>
<L>"Pray, tell me, Sare, vat your commands vid me?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Sir, reply'd King, "I merely thought to know,</L>
<L>"As by your house I chanc'd to night to go;</L>
<L>"But, really, I disturb'd your sleep, I fear—</L>
<L>"I say, I thought that you perhaps could tell,</L>
<L>"Among the folks who in this street may dwell;</L>
<L>"If there's a <HI>Mr. Thompson</HI> lodges here?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The shiv'ring Frenchman, though not pleas'd to find,</L>
<L>The business of this unimportant kind;</L>
<L>Too simple to suspect 'twas meant in jeer,</L>
<L>Shrug'd out a sigh that thus his rest should break,</L>
<L>Then with unalter'd courtesy, he spake;</L>
<L>"No Sare: no Monsieur Tonson lodges here."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our wag begg'd pardon, and tow'rds home he sped,</L>
<L>While the poor Frenchman crawl'd again to bed;</L>
<L>But King resolv'd not thus to drop the jest,</L>
<L>So the next night, with more of whim than grace,</L>
<L>Again he made a visit to the place;</L>
<L>To break once more the poor old Frenchman's rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="68" REF="033983_0281_0FF9E936B8AFDB28" MS="y"/>
<L>He knock'd—but waited longer than before,</L>
<L>No footstep seem'd approaching to the door;</L>
<L>Our Frenchman lay in such a sleep profound,</L>
<L>King with the knocker thunder'd then again,</L>
<L>Firm on his post determin'd to remain;</L>
<L>And oft indeed he made the door resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At last King hears him o'er the passage creep,</L>
<L>Wond'ring what fiend again disturb'd his sleep;</L>
<L>The wag salutes him with a civil leer,</L>
<L>Thus drawling out to heighten the surprise,</L>
<L>(While the poor Frenchman rubb'd his heavy eyes;)</L>
<L>"Is there a <HI>Mr. Thompson</HI> lodges here?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Frenchman faulter'd, with a kind of fright,</L>
<L>"Vy, Sare, I'm sure I tell you, Sare, last night;</L>
<L>(And here he labour'd with a sigh sincere)</L>
<L>"No Monsieur <HI>Tonson</HI> in de varld I know,</L>
<L>"No Monsieur <HI>Tonson</HI> here—I toll you so;</L>
<L>"Indeed Sare, dere no Monsieur <HI>Tonson</HI> here."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some more excuses tender'd, off King goes,</L>
<L>And the old Frenchman sought once more repose;</L>
<L>The rogue next night pursu'd his odd career,</L>
<L>'Twas long indeed before the man came nigh,</L>
<L>And then he utter'd in a piteous cry,</L>
<L>"Sare, 'pon my soul no Mons. <HI>Tonson</HI> here."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our sportive wight his usual visit paid,</L>
<L>And the next night came forth a prattling maid,</L>
<L>Whose tongue, indeed than any jack went faster—</L>
<L>Anxious she strove his errand to enquire:</L>
<L>He said "'twas vain her pretty tongue to tire,</L>
<L>"He should not stir 'till he had seen her master."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The damsel then began in doleful state,</L>
<L>The Frenchman's broken slumbers to relate,</L>
<L>And begg'd he'd call at proper time of day—</L>
<L>King told her, she must fetch her master down,</L>
<L>A chaise was ready, he was leaving town,</L>
<L>But first had much of deep concern to say.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="69" REF="033983_0282_0FF9E9408B0FF478" MS="y"/>
<L>Thus urg'd, she went the snoring man to call,</L>
<L>And long indeed was she oblig'd to ball;</L>
<L>Ere she could rouse the torpid lump of clay,</L>
<L>At last he wakes, he rises, and he swears,</L>
<L>But scarcely had he totter'd down the stairs,</L>
<L>When King attacked him in the usual way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Frenchman now perceiv'd 'twas all in vain</L>
<L>To this tormentor mildly to complain,</L>
<L>And strait in rage began his crest to rear—</L>
<L>"Sare vat the devil make you treat me so?</L>
<L>"Sare, I inform you, sare, tree nights ago,</L>
<L>"Cot tam, I swear no Mons. <HI>Tonson</HI> here."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>True as the night, King went, and heard a strife,</L>
<L>Between the harrass'd Frenchman and his wife;</L>
<L>Which should descend to chase the fiend away,</L>
<L>At length to join their forces they agree,</L>
<L>And strait impetuously they turn the key,</L>
<L>Prepar'd with mutual fury for the fray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our hero, with the firmness of a rock,</L>
<L>Collected to receive the mighty shock,</L>
<L>Uttering the old enquiry, calmly stood;</L>
<L>The name of <HI>Thompson</HI> raised the storm so high,</L>
<L>He deem'd it then the safest plan to fly,</L>
<L>With—"well, I'll call when you're in gentler mood."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In short our hero, with the same intent,</L>
<L>Full many a night to plague the Frenchman went;</L>
<L>So fond of mischief was this wicked wit:</L>
<L>They threw out water, for the watch they call,</L>
<L>But King expecting, still escapes them all;</L>
<L>Monsieur at last was forc'd his house to quit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It happen'd that our wag about this time,</L>
<L>On some fair prospect sought the Eastern clime;</L>
<L>Six ling'ring years were there his tedious lot,</L>
<L>At length content, amid his rip'ning store,</L>
<L>He treads again on Britain's happy shore,</L>
<L>And his long absence is at once forgot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="70" REF="033983_0283_0FF9E94DA5F4A4F0"/>
<L>To London, with impatient hope he flies,</L>
<L>And the same night, as former freaks arise,</L>
<L>He fain must stroll the well-known haunt to trace,</L>
<L>"Ah! here's the scene of frequent mirth," he said:</L>
<L>"My poor old Frenchman, I suppose is dead;</L>
<L>"Egad! I'll knock, and see who holds his place."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With rapid strokes he makes the mansion roar</L>
<L>And while he eager eyes the op'ning door,</L>
<L>Lo! who obeys the knocker's ratling peel?</L>
<L>Why e'en our little Frenchman, strange to say,</L>
<L>He took his old abode that very day:</L>
<L>Capricious turn of sportive fortune's wheel!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Without one thought of the relentless foe,</L>
<L>Who, fiend like, haunted him so long ago;</L>
<L>Just in his former trim he now appears;</L>
<L>The waistcoat and the night-cap seem'd the same,</L>
<L>With <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ush-light as before he creeping came,</L>
<L>And King's detested voice astonish'd hears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As if some hideous spectre struck his sight,</L>
<L>His senses seem'd bewilder'd with affright;</L>
<L>His face, indeed, bespoke a heart full sore,</L>
<L>Then starting, he exclaim'd, in rueful strain,</L>
<L>"Begar! here's Mons. <HI>Tonson</HI> come again."</L>
<L>Away he ran—<HI>and ne'er was heard of more.</HI></L>
