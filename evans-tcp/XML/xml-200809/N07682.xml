<HEAD><HI>REMARKS,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THERE hath lately appear'd a Pamphlet, called the <HI>Quaker Unmask'd,</HI> or <HI>Plain Truth,</HI> a very well wrote Piece indeed, and would be still better, had not the Author made the Hyperbole, his darling Trope.</P>
<P>A Piece of this nature must certainly asto∣nish the discerning, or them who were pre∣sent at the late alarming and interesting Af∣fair, and who had an Opportunity of seeing the Rioter's Friends sloth and inactivity in endeavouring to suppress, and their Unani∣mity, and Zeal in forwarding and encourage∣ing the unprecedented and lawless proceed∣ings of an ignorant and enthusiastick <HI>Mob.</HI></P>
<P>There hath several Pieces appeared in pub∣lic, on the Occasion; but a Piece from that side of the Question appearing, was thought impossible, without it was one that would be composed of Apoligies for, and Palliations of the late intriguing Conduct of a rigid subvert∣ing Society in this City; but instead of that, after favouring the Cause in private, to espouse it in public, is surprizing to every bo∣dy, and plainly indicates the most depravid
<PB N="3" REF="009813_0003_0F7A5455E7F92398"/>
Ignorance, or that uncommon Audacity, that the Lenity of a Government to ungrate∣ful Monsters is too often productive of.</P>
<P>It hath been observed by the Proprietors of <HI>Negroes,</HI> that there is something so peculi∣ar in their Disposition, that they cannot bear Indulgence; these People I look upon to be under the same unhappy Circumstances, not that I would suppose it so in their original Dis∣positions, but owing to the Effect their Prin∣ciples have, for they are, and have always been (tho' under the mildest of Govern∣ments) a Sett of uneasy, discontented, and innovating People.</P>
<P>But <HI>Philadelphia</HI> boasts of better Men than they; Men, who when Occasion calls, are ready to take up Arms in Opposition to the Enemies of her Welfare. Yet some of these
<Q>are called Incendiaries, who are not only enraged themselves, at their dear Friends the Indians, being slain, but would have all the World of their Temper.</Q>
Now, what Interest can the saving the Lives of the Indians be to the <HI>Q—rs,</HI> or what Disad∣vantage can accrue to them from their Death, I can't conceive, neither hath our Author (after several low and impertinent Insinua∣tions) be able to determine.</P>
<P>Those that did take up Arms, I am fully convinced, had no other View in it, than the Welfare of the City, and Persons acting by
<PB N="4" REF="009813_0004_0F7A5456CA177730"/>
the Principle of Partriotism, make this their incumbent Duty, not only to be possessed of this Principle themselves, but make (as much as in them lies) Proselytes to it, or in our no∣ble Author's Words,
<Q>would have all the World of their Temper.</Q></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Narrative</HI> of the Massacre, &amp;c. it is a Pamphlet that will bear a recommen∣dation to the Perusal of every candid Person, as there is in it that <HI>Pathos,</HI> that will rouse the Christian in the Reader, and excite in him an endeavour to prevent the effusion of human Blood. And the Author is, as the Work shews him to be, a Gentleman of Integrity, of impartial Judgement, and of Sentiments un∣tainted by infectious P—y.</P>
<P><Q>These compassionate and merciful Christians, so easily affected with Pity for <HI>Indians,</HI> would not grant a single Farthing for the Relief of their Fellow Subjects.</Q>
This assertion is certainly false, and against known Truths (but it is needless to pick out Paragraphs that are false, when there is not a Truth in the whole) for tho' there were no Charity Sermons preached, and no ostenta∣tious Collection made in Public, yet it is well known that there were considerable Sums collected and distributed among the truly necessitous; but perhaps this Assertion pro∣ceeds from their being none distributed at <PB N="5" REF="009813_0005_0F7A545788EDCFF8"/>
<HI>Germantown,</HI> a place where some People made all their Charity center.</P>
<P><Q>Let us impartially next consider <HI>Quakers</HI> with Respect to Government. Can it be consistent that a Person who declares that his Conscience by divine Inspiration forbids him to have any Hand in shedding Blood, should be intrusted as a Representative for People, who look upon themselves to be obliged by the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, and the Laws of their King and Country to take up Arms to defend them∣selves, and punish those who would deprive them of Life and Property.</Q>
If <HI>Q—rs</HI> are under those Circumstances, so improper to represent a People, (between whose Senti∣ments there is so great a Contrast) why are they chosen as such? They have never ob∣tained their Seats in the House of Assembly by either any secret or understanding Means, or any open violent Measure, but so far from that, what few are in the House, have been annually, by public Advertisments, declaring their desire of resigning, and requesting the Election of others in their Room: If there are so many Disadvantages flow from their being Members of a legislative Body, why is not their request complied with? I am cer∣tain it can't be alledged, that the Numbers
<PB N="6" REF="009813_0006_0F7A54587A3DE598"/>
of <HI>Q—rs</HI> in this Province make a Majority of its inhabitants, nor can it be owing to the Paucity of their avowed Enemies the <HI>Pr—ns</HI> (for unhappy for it, it swarms with them) but their Constituents, upon probation, seeing the happy Effects of their upright Conduct in every public Trust, executive as well as legislative, have always endeavoured (tho' contrary to their Inclinations) still to keep them possessed of it. And I doubt not but this very railer, when the Anniversary Day of Election comes about, (after an impartial Consideration of their unexceptionable Con∣duct, and a serious Reflection on the Incapa∣city of their Enemies) will be the foremost in opposing their removal; for his present In∣dignation, is only owing to a little Heat of Blood, occasioned by the Miscarriage of a late Project.</P>
<P><Q>But it hath been proved, by a very cir∣cumstantial Oath of a young Man, who hath since very unaccountably disappear∣ed,</Q>
&amp;c. What a bitter Innuendo is that! But People's knowledge of every Circum∣stance relative to it, makes the Invective contained in it, recoil with the greater Force upon them. O unhappy Predestination! whom I suppose it was intended to screen and defend.—And believe me my Country∣men, those who would be privy to an Inten∣tion
<PB N="7" REF="009813_0007_0F7A545A05503EA8"/>
of Murder, and would assist, when they thought Opportunity favoured the putting the Intention in Execution, would perpe∣trate a Murder, and rather than their diabo∣lical Schemes should prove abortive in any Point, would work upon the Inexperience of a Youth to commit an Act, that will un∣avoidably redound to the Infamy of his Insti∣gators. Our Author I believe studies <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> a good deal, as he seems to be well ver∣sed in the Art of composing Proverbs.—It is a Pity he had not some of his Wisdom too. Here follows an excellent one;
<Q>To govern is absolutely repugnant to the avowed Principles of <HI>Quakers.</HI></Q>
To be govern'd is absolutely repugnant to the avowed princi∣ples of <HI>Pr—ns.</HI> Now, to sum up the Character of the aforemention'd Pamphlet, I think it is really an elegant and perfect Work, and so many found Truths interspersed throughout the whole Piece, makes it still more amiable; and upon the whole makes up what <HI>Longinus</HI> calls the <HI>Sublime.</HI> Altho' I think the Poet hath drawn the Author's Character in the following Lines.</P>
<Q><L>—He loves Books:</L>
<L>Not that he hath a Scruple more of Learning,</L>
<L>Than will suffice him to say Grace; but like</L>
<L>Some piteous Cowards, who are oft tho't valiant,</L>

<P>And so after wishing that private anim<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦ties may subside, and public Factions lo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their existence, shall conclude with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Hume</HI> says thereon.
