<P>The Character of Doctor <HI>PRIESTLEY,</HI> is known to stand very high in the literary World. This small Tract is as much celebrated as any of his numerous Publications. It is said, that above thirty Thousand Copies of it have been sold in En∣gland. This affords a strong Presumption, in fa∣vour of that weight of Evidence which it contains. Of this, however, let the Reader judge for himself.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It would be offering an insult to your profession, to your cha∣racters, to your high pretensions to literature, to suppose that you can be offended with the following publication. As gentlemen you must be candid. As Christians, you must be forbearing. As men of science, you must wish to give every sub∣ject a fair hearing.</P>
<P>We are no longer confined, within those soporiferous circles, which were drawn by vindictive bigots, in the darkest ages. We are now sensible, that it is our duty to know the truth, that the truth will make us free. We are convinced, also, that an implicit faith is not the duty of a Christian, but, on the contrary, that we should prove all things, and hold fast that which is good, or that every man should be fully persuaded in his own mind.</P>
<P>If therefore, the sentiments which are urged upon us, in the tract before you be founded in truth, you, will give them all their influence upon yourselves, and will recommend them, with the ut∣most earnestness, to all your different audiences.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, you have reason to apprehend, that any errors are propagated in this book, you have a fair opportunity of confuting them. But read, read candidly and impartially, before you pronounce the sentence of condemnation, and direct all those with whom you have any connection, to give the most unbounded scope to their examination of the doctrines in question, lest they should say, that you are afraid of the light or injuriously charge you, with being either not able to defend the truth, or willing to conceal it under an impenetrable chaos.</P>
<P>When you seriously Weigh the preceding reflections, I shall, I am sure, receive your thanks for the present publication, and you will endeavour to accelerate the circulation of it over all this vast continent.</P>
<P>Suffer me to throw out another observation in vindication of myself, some copies of this pamphlet have crept in among us, and are secretly making many proselites. on the supposition, then, that it is an heretical performance, by thus making it better known, you the physicians are called in, before it be too late, to extricate the poison, and to prevent the spreading of the contagi∣on, before it go beyond the reach of a radical remedy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS, <HI>and</HI> BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WISH you to be without spot. But, I am afraid, if you examine your own conduct, that you cannot say, this is altogether the case, you have no occasion to be directed not to imitate those who stile themselves the orthodox, in their malicious calumny, in their aptitude to do every injury in their power to those who differ from them, or in their habit of condemning unheard, or rejecting without reading them, such authors as contradict their own sentiments. But after you have fully examined the doctrines of any particular church, and are decidedly clear in your own minds, that such doctrines are diametrically repugnant to the good word of truth, I wish you to imitate the <HI>orthodox</HI> in not appearing to give any countenance to such doctrines.</P>
<P>You are sensible, according to the express declaration of the Lord Jesus Christ, that THE ONLY TRUE GOD IS THE FATHER of all; and you believe with the apostle Paul, and with all the other inspired writers of the Old and New-Testament, that THERE IS BUT ONE GOD EVEN THE FATHER, who was never born, who could not become a child, nor suffer death nor be subject to any possible change.</P>
<P>Should you not, therefore, make your light to shine? If only two or three of you were convinced of this great truth, should you not by publickly protesting against the worship of more Gods than one, declare your supreme veneration of the one only God?</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to inform you, that the <HI>true worshippers worship</HI> THE FATHER ONLY, and that the true worshippers worship him <HI>in spirit and in truth.</HI> But, they cannot be deemed true worshippers who do not worship at all, who put their candle under a bushel, who hide their talent in the earth, and do not worship in the face of men, or, who through the slavish fear of appearing singular, give countenance to the worship of three, or four Gods.</P>
<P>Come out from among them, and be ye separate. Be not ashamed of Christ, and his kingdom. Shew your faith by your works. Worship publickly the one Eternal Jehovah. This is your duty, which you cannot controvert or deny. Let it not therefore be said of you on the last day, that your fear of your fellow creatures was superior to your veneration of the Almighty Creator, that you loved darkness rather than light, because your deeds were evil.</P>
<P>The great Lord of the universe requireth sincerity from us. But we cannot be sincere when we appear to give his glory to another.</P>

<HEAD>The Editor's Address to the Deists.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are my brethren in nature, and equally with me, subjects of the one universal parent.</P>
<P>Some of you are charged with duplicity. Some of you are charged with bigotry. Some of you are charged with insincerity, in being said to appear to conform to what you utterly disapprove. These are heavy charges. Wipe them away, by examining can∣didly every thing that has any pretensions to truth, and by adher∣ing firmly to whatever your unprejudiced reason shall convince you is truth.</P>
<P>I believe, you have generally rejected Christianity, because it's doctrines have been perversly misrepresented to you. You have been told that the doctrine of a trinity is it's grand basis, and that the doctrines of original Sin, predestination, a satisfaction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the superstructures. But examine christianity itself, and you will find that it contains none of these doctrines. It is a pure System of faith, in the one God, and Father of all: and of peace and good will to men.</P>
<P>It's real doctrines you have now before you, can you say, that any of these are unworthy of the divine perfections? Can you say that any of these are repugnant to the natural dictates of your own minds? Can you say, that God could not reveal himself to men? Can you say, that the infinitely benevolent Being whose tender mercies are ever over all his works, is not as much dis∣posed to enlighten our minds and to rescue us from the snares of Sin and death, as to preserve our bodies and pour upon us a pro∣fusion of earthly joys? Look to yourselves we must all hereafter be accountable for the talents we possess.</P>
<P>This present world is wearing away, The youngest of us must soon leave it. If, then, there be another world, this should be our grand concern. What can I say more? The great God has not implanted in us wishes for immortality, without intending us for such a state. But if we cast away his instructions, and treat them with scorn, without any examination of them, what can our ex∣pectations be?</P>
<P>The author of all our benefits, is entitled to our unceasing prais∣es. Every thing worthy of him, should be the subject of our most delightful meditations, and we should always esteem his fa∣vour as better than life.</P>

<HEAD>An Appeal to the serious and candid Professors of Christianity.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Christian Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT one who professes obedience to the same Lord, and faith in the precious promises of the same gospel with yourselves to address himself to you, with all freedom and plainness of speech, on subjects relating to our common salvation. I need not tell you that these subjects are interesting. In reality, nothing else is interesting in comparison with them. For what is this world compared with the future! What is time compared with eternity! Believe me my brethren, it is nothing but the deepest concern for the honour of a religion which is the most valuable inheritance of the human race, and which sets us above all the follies and vices, all the weaknesses and troubles of life, by giving us the most solid hope in death, that, has induced me to solicit your attention. But I am confident that you will not think it ill bestowed, because it is upon a subject that is near and dear to you, and the consideration of which cannot, but please and profit you.</P>
<P>If, by the blessing of God upon our common endeavours to <HI>lead,</HI> and to be <HI>led into all truth,</HI> I shall be so happy as to bring you to en∣tertain the same views of these things with myself, we shall rejoice together; and if, after all that I may be able to advance, you should still think differently from me, I trust you will, at least, be disposed to think with more candour of some of your fellow-christians, who love the gospel, and are zealous for its honour, though you may think them mistaken in their conceptions concerning it. Let me intreat you, therefore, my brethren, to give me a patient and can∣did hearing. Attend, in the spirit of meekness, to what I shall say from the earnestness of my heart; and exercise the reason which God has given you upon this occasion, which is the noblest on which it can be exercised, and for which you may, therefore, conclude, that it was principally given you.</P>

<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Of the Use of Reason in Matters of Religion.</HEAD>
<P>BE not backward, or afraid, my brethren, to make use of your reason in matters of religion, or where the scriptures are concerned. They both of them proceed from the same God and Father of us all, who is the giver of every good and every perfect gift. They cannot, therefore, be contrary to one another, but must mutually illustrate and enforce one another. Besides, how can we distinguish one scheme of religion from another, so as to give the preference to that which is the most deserving of it, but by the help of our reason and understanding? What would you yourselves say to a Mahometan, whom you would persuade to
<PB N="8" REF="018741_0007_0FA81B763B4D6198"/>
abandon the imposture of Mahomet, and embrace christianity, but bid him use his reason; and judge, by the help of it, of the ma∣nifest difference between the two religions, and the great superiority of yours to his? Does not God himself appeal to the reason of man, when he condescends to ask us, <HI>Whether his ways be not equal?</HI> Ezek. xviii. 29. Does not the apostle exhort us that <HI>in understanding we be men?</HI> 1 Cor. xiv. 20. Are we not expressly commanded to <HI>prove all things, and then hold fast that which is good?</HI> 1 Thess. v. 21. Also, when we are commanded to <HI>search the scriptures,</HI> John v. 39 more must be meant than merely <HI>reading</HI> them, or <HI>receiving implicitly,</HI> the interpretations of others. <HI>Searching</HI> must imply an earnest endeavour to find out for ourselves, and to understand the truths contained in the scriptures; and what faculty can we employ for this purpose, but that which is commonly called <HI>reason,</HI> whereby we are capable of thinking, reflecting, comparing, and judging of things?</P>
<P>Distrust, therefore, all those who decry human reason, and who require you to abandon it, wherever religion is concerned. When once they have gained this point with you, they can lead you whither they please, and impose upon you every absurdity which their sinister views may make it expedient for them that you should embrace. A Popish Priest would require nothing more than this, to make you believe the doctrine of transubstantiation, and that a man is infallible; or to persuade you to commit the most flagrant wickedness; as a means of <HI>doing God service.</HI> For the first of these articles they do not fail to urge the words of scripture, which ex∣pressly say, concerning the bread that is used in the Lord's supper, that it <HI>is the body of Christ;</HI> Matt. xxvi. 6. and there is no possibility of replying to them, but by appealing to reason, as the necessary and proper judge of the sense of scripture. The Papists, therefore, as might well be expected, is forward, on all occasions, to vilify human reason, and to require men to abandon it; but true Pro∣testants will not part with it. It is by the help of reason, in con∣junction with the scriptures, that we guard ourselves against the gross delusions of the Papists, who, after relinquishing reason, have been <HI>made to believe a lie;</HI> and by the diligent and continued use of the same power, let us endeavour to combat every remaining error, and trace out and reform every corruption of christianity, till we hold the pure <HI>truth as it is in Jesus,</HI> and <HI>obey it in the love thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Do not think that, by recommending the use of reason, I am about to decry the scriptures. My appeal shall be to both, upon every subject on which I address you; and I think you cannot but see that the plainnest and most obvious sense of the scriptures is in favour of those doctrines which are most agreeable to reason. A good man will rejoice to see them thus go hand in hand, mutually illustrating and enforcing one another.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Of the Power of Man to do the Will of God.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the subjects with respect to which I earnestly wish that you would attend to the voice of reason and the scriptures, and with respect to which, one mistake will be followed by many others, and mistakes of great consequence, is concerning <HI>the power of man to do the will of God.</HI> It is a favourite opinion with many teachers of religion, that men have <HI>naturally</HI> (or by that constitu∣tion and frame which God their maker hath given them) no power at all to do any thing that is good, not even to think a good thought, much less actually to obey any of the commands of God; so that, if men were left to themselves, they could do nothing but sin, and must be under a necessity of aggravating their con∣demnation, by every thought, word, and action of their lives. But, my brethren, how does this doctrine agree with the scrip∣tures, and particularly with the manner in which the Divine Being constantly expostulates with the sinful sons of men; as when he says to the Jews,
<Q>Turn ye turn ye from your evil ways, why will ye die, O House of Israel. <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii. 11. Wash ye make you clean.</Q>
Cease to do evil learn to do well, &amp;c, <HI>Isa.</HI> i. 16.</P>
<P>Is it not plain from this, that it depends upon men themselves, whether they will repent and turn to God or not? And how can it depend upon themselves if they have not naturally, a sufficient power to do it? You cannot think that God would command, and expect obedience, when he had not given power to obey; and much less that he would urge men to provide for their own safety and happiness, when himself had put an effectual bar in the way of it.</P>
<P>Suppose that any man's children were shut up in a building that was on fire, while he himself was without, and had the key: and that, instead of opening the door, to favour their escape, he should only call out to them to flee out of the place, in order to avoid instant destruction; and that, as the necessary conse∣quence of this, they should all perish in the flames before his eyes; what would you think of such a father? You would want words to express your abhorrence of his cruelty; and yet in this very light do many christian divines represent the conduct of that God <HI>whose tender mercies are over all his works,</HI> and who has solemnly declared, <HI>that he hath no pleasure in the death of a sinner, but rather that he would turn from his way and live</HI> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. yea, <HI>who would have all men to be saved.</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 4.</P>
<P>The conduct of our <HI>merciful God and Father,</HI> is certainly far different from this, and more agreeable to reason and equity. If he designed us to be accountable creatures, and treats us as such we must have <HI>talents</HI> given us, which we may either improve or misimprove. If we be the subjects of his <HI>moral government,</HI> we must be in a condition either to <HI>observe</HI> or to <HI>break</HI> his laws. A power to do the one necessarily supposes a power to do the other; and without this power we should not be the proper subjects
<PB N="10" REF="018741_0009_0FA81B779B49BBA8"/>
of religion; as, in that case it would be vain to propose to us either rewards for obedience, or punishments for disobedience.</P>
<P>Nor is the supposition of a power in man to do the will of God, any foundation for <HI>pride.</HI> For we must still say, with the apostle, <HI>What have we that we have not received? and how then can we glory, as if we had not received it? Every good and every per∣fect gift comes from God;</HI> and, knowing this, the more we receive of his bounty, the more thankful, and the more humble we should be. I shall, certainly, be more solicitous to exert myself in doing the will of God, when, I believe that I have a talent to improve, than if I believe that I have no talent intrusted with me at all; so that I cannot do even so much as the <HI>wicked and slothful servant, who hid his talent in a napkin.</HI></P>
<P>Some of those persons who believe that all mankind are absolute∣ly incapable of doing any good, are sometimes heard to invite sin∣ners of all kinds to come to Christ, <HI>as they are,</HI> and to say, that the viler they are, the more welcome they will be to him; as if he was, after this, to cleanse them by some miraculous power. But, my brethren, the invitation of the gospel runs in very different terms. It is, <HI>Repent, and bring forth fruits meet for re∣pentance.</HI> Matt. iii. 8. <HI>Repent, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out.</HI> Acts iii. 19 And none are invited <HI>to come to Christ,</HI> but those who <HI>labour and are heavy laden;</HI> nor can they <HI>find rest for their souls,</HI> till they have <HI>actually learned of him to be meek and lowly in heart.</HI> Matt. xi. 28.</P>
<P>What can be more contrary to the maxims above-mentioned, than the whole tenor of that serious expostulation with the children of Israel in the prophet Isaiah, part of which I quoted above? <HI>wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Cease to do evil, learn to do well. Seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now,</HI> (and not before) <HI>and let us reason together, says the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</HI> Isa. i. 16, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Others, who entertain the same opinion of the utter inability of man to do the will of God, act more consistently with those sen∣timents, but far more inconsistently with the scriptures, in never preaching to sinners at all; though to <HI>call sinners to repentance</HI> was the chief end of Christ's coming into the world. <HI>Matt.</HI> ix. 13.</P>
<P>Whatever represents a state of acceptance with God, as a thing that may be brought about without any efforts of our own, and especially if it may be done in a moment, or in a very short space of time, is sure to be a popular doctrine. Mankind in general care not how little is expected of them, or how little they themselves have to do, in order to get to heaven. But true religion, that alone which affords solid ground of hope towards God, consists in a change of heart, affections, and habits; which can only be brought about by serious resolution, and a vigorous and con<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant exertion of our powers. Nay, unless a course of virtue be begun, and good habits
<PB N="11" REF="018741_0010_0FA81B785555A3B0"/>
formed early in life, there is very great danger that the <HI>thorns, briars,</HI> or <HI>bad soil,</HI> will prevent the good seed from ever coming to maturity.</P>
<P>To believe, as the same persons do, that faith and repentance are nothing that we ourselves are capable of, but altogether the mira∣culous operation of the spirit of God in us and upon us, supposes that this great and sudden change may as well take place at the <HI>last</HI> hour of life, as at any other; which certainly encourages the most unwarrantable and most dangerous presumption, and is far from having any countenance in the scriptures. The word of God always represents a safe and <HI>happy death</HI> as the consequence of nothing but a good and <HI>well-spent life.</HI> Some, indeed, are said to have been called at the <HI>eleventh</HI> hour, but none at the <HI>twelfth,</HI> when the time for labouring in the vineyard was quite over; and not one of the foolish virgins, who had neglected to provide themselves with oil, was admitted to the marriage-supper.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> Of Original Sin.</HEAD>
<P>AS a foundation for this strange doctrine, of the utter inability of men to do what God requires of them, a doctrine so in∣jurious both to our Maker and ourselves, it is said that by his first offence our first parent Adam, and all his posterity, lost all power of doing any thing acceptable to God for the future; that he was the representative of all his posterity; so that when he sinned, we all sinned; and, every sin being an offence against an infinite God, we all became, from that moment, liable to an infinite punishment, even the everlasting wrath and curse of our Maker. And they say, that, on this account only, it would have been just in God to have made us all suffer the most exquisite and endless torments in hell, even though we had never sinned in our own persons.</P>
<P>But, my brethren, you find nothing like any part of this in your bibles. For there you read, <HI>The soul that sinneth, it shall die.</HI> Ezek. xviii. 4. And long after the transgression of Adam, and to this very day, God is continually calling upon men to <HI>cease to do evil, and learn to do well;</HI> which certainly supposes that men always have had, and that we now have, a power to do so. It is allowed that we <HI>suffer</HI> by the sin of Adam, as any child may suffer in consequence of the wickedness of his ancestor; but it is not possible that we should have <HI>sinned</HI> in him. Wherever there is <HI>sin,</HI> there is <HI>guilt,</HI> that is, something that may be the foundation of <HI>re∣morse</HI> of conscience; something that a man may be <HI>sorry for,</HI> and <HI>re∣pent of;</HI> something that he may wish he had not done; all which clearly implies, that sin is something that a man has given his <HI>con∣sent</HI> to, and therefore must be convinced of the reasonableness of his being punished for But how can any man repent of the sin of Adam, or feel any thing like remorse of conscience for it; when he cannot but know that he never gave his consent to it, and could not possibly have been, in the least degree, accessary to it? Good and bad conduct are, in their own nature, personal, and cannot pos∣sibly
<PB N="12" REF="018741_0011_0FA81B790F99F138"/>
be transferred from one to another. Whatever some divines pretend, nothing of this kind can be <HI>imputed</HI> in this sense of the word. We may receive harm by means of one person, and benefit by means of another, but no sin of the former, or righteousness of the latter, can be considered as ours, in the eye of an equitable and just God. The contrary is as much the language and the plain meaning of the scriptures throughout, as it is agreeable to the common sense and reason that God has given us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>IV.</HI> Of Election and Reprobation.</HEAD>
<P>SUPPOSING that all mankind became liable to the ever∣lasting wrath and curse of God for the sin of one man, some divines say, that it was mercy in God to save any, though by an <HI>arbitrary decree,</HI> which left all the rest of the human race under an inevitable necessity of perishing. But certainly, my brethren, such <HI>tender mercy is cruelty.</HI> All the creatures of God must look up to him as the author of their being, since it was, undoubtedly, in his power to give, or to withhold it, at his pleasure; and, surely, a good and merciful God would have put a stop to the propagation of such a race of creatures, rather then suffer them to be born in such shocking circumstances; in which he infallibly foresaw, that the greatest part of them must be exposed to, and even actually suffer remediless destruction. As surely as I derive my being from a just and merciful God, I conclude that the terms on which I came into the world are advantageous to me; and therefore, that it must be my own fault only, if I have not reason to rejoice in it, and to be thankful, for it. But, indeed, I can hardly think that any man seriously believes, that the greatest part of his fellow-creatures are born into the world under a predetermined necessity of being for ever miserable. For in that case, it must appear probable that any children which he himself may be the means of bringing into the world will be for ever miserable; and surely no man of real goodness or compassion would wish to have children, or be necessary to their being born in such circumstances.</P>
<P>If this doctrine be true, what motive can any man have to en∣deavour to <HI>flee from the wrath to come.</HI> Matt. iii. 7. when if it is to be his lot at all, nothing that he can do will enable him to escape it; or what motive can a man have to exert himself to <HI>lay hold on eternal life,</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 12. when, if he is to enjoy it at all, he cannot possibly miss of it, or of any thing belonging to it, or that is necessary to prepare him for it? What reason had the apostle Paul to exhort Christians to <HI>take heed lest they should fall,</HI> 1 Cor. x. 12. when none that ever did stand could possibly fall? and what reason had he to <HI>labour, left after having preached to others, he himself should be a cast-away,</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 27. when, being certain of his conversion, he must have known that that consequence was impossible?</P>
<P>This doctrine, of absolute election and reprobation, is certainly
<PB N="13" REF="018741_0012_0FA81B79D62A5CB8"/>
a doctrine of <HI>licentiousness,</HI> and not a <HI>doctrine according to godliness;</HI> and let divines employ all the ingenuity they are masters of, it is impossible for them to clear this opinion from being the cause of fatal despair in some, and as fatal a security in others. If this opinion were true, and men were really aware of their situation, I should think it impossible to prevent their falling into absolute distraction, through terror and anxiety. It would be like a man having his <HI>all,</HI> his <HI>life,</HI> nay infinitely more than his life, depend∣ing upon the cast of a die; the decree of God being a thing that he has as little power to command. Besides, this doctrine cer∣tainly represents the God and Father of us all in such a light, as no man would chuse that he himself should appear in.</P>

<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> Of the Divinity of Christ.</HEAD>
<P>SO fatal have the consequences of the sin of Adam been repre∣sented, that you have been told, that nothing but the blood of God himself could reverse them; and therefore you have been taught to believe, that Jesus Christ, whose proper title is <HI>the son of man,</HI> as well as <HI>the son of God,</HI> was not merely <HI>man,</HI> but very and eternal <HI>God</HI> himself; without considering that, by thus ma∣king more Gods than one, you are guilty of a breach of the first and most important of all the commandments, which says express∣ly, <HI>Thou shalt have no other Gods before me,</HI> Exod. xx. 3. But whatever such divines may say, the apostle Paul says, in direct contradiction to them, that,
<Q>To us there is but one God, the FATHER, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him, 1 Cor. viii. 6.</Q>
And again, after saying that we have <HI>one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</HI> he adds,
<Q>one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all, Eph. iv. 5.6.</Q>
The creed of all Christians, therefore, ought to be,
<Q>There is ONE GOD, and one mediator between God and men, the MAN Christ Jesus, 1 Tim. ii. 5.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Father</HI> is frequently stiled <HI>God,</HI> even with respect to Christ, as well as other beings.
<Q>The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, give unto you, that ye may know the exceeding greatness of his power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand, &amp;c. Eph. i. 17. &amp;c.</Q>
Christ himself uses the same language.
<Q>I ascend unto my Father, and your Father, and unto my God, and your God, John xx. 17. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</Q></P>
<P>Christ who was <HI>the image of the invisible God,</HI> and the <HI>first-born</HI> (or <HI>most excellent) of all his creatures,</HI> Col. i. 15. and <HI>in whom dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,</HI> Col. ii. 9. ack∣nowledged that <HI>his Father was greater than he,</HI> John xiv, 28. and, indeed, upon all occasions, and in the clearest terms, he expressed his dependence upon God his Father, for all his power
<PB N="14" REF="018741_0013_0FA81B7B51D0F578"/>
and glory; as if he had purposely intended to guard his disciples against forming too high an opinion of the dignity of their master.
<Q>Verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself, John v. 19. I can of mine own self do nothing. As I hear I judge, and my judgement is just, because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father, who sent me, v. 30. The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father who dwelleth in me, he doth the works. xiv. 10. I live by the Father. vi. 57. The Father hath given to the son to have life in himself; and hath given him authority to exe∣cute judgment. v. 26.27. All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Matt. xxviii. 18 <HI>He even calls his Fa∣ther</HI> the only true God, John xvii. 3 that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</Q>
It appears to me not to be in the power of language to exclude the idea of the divinity of Christ more expressly than by these solemn words.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the divine communications with which our Lord was favoured, some things are expressly said to be withheld from him. For he himself, speaking of his second coming, says, Mark xiii. 32. <HI>But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Fa∣ther.</HI> In Matthew xxiv. 36. where the same observation is re∣peated, it is, <HI>but my Father only.</HI></P>
<P>The apostles notwithstanding their attachment to their Lord, and Master, always preserve the idea of his subordination to the Father, and consider all his honour and power as derived from him.
<Q>He received from God the Father, honour and glory, 2 Pet. i. 17. It pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness dwell, Col i. 19. The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, Rev. i. 1. Ye are Christ's and Christ is God's, 1 Cor. iii. 23. The head of Christ is God, 1 Cor. xi. 3</Q></P>
<P>The reason why Christ was so much distinguished by God the Father, is frequently and fully expressed in the scriptures, viz. his obedience to the will of God, and especially in his submitting to die for the benefit of mankind.
<Q>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, John x. 17. He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the Glory of God the Father, Phil. ii. 8—11. Who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is now sat down at the right hand of God. Heb. xii. 2.</Q></P>
<P>Our Lord says, that <HI>he and his Father are one.</HI> John x. 30. but he sufficiently explains himself, when he prays that all his disciples may be
<Q>one with him, and his Father, even as they are one. John xvii. ii. and he gives them the same glory
<PB N="15" REF="018741_0014_0FA81B7B82B38358"/>
which God had given to him, ver. 22.</Q>
Besides, at the very time that our Lord says, that he and his father are one, and in the very sentence preceding it, ver. 29. he says, that "his Father is "greater than all. But how could the Father be greater than all, if there was any other, who was so much <HI>one</HI> with him, as to be, in all, respects <HI>equal</HI> to him.</P>
<P>The mere term <HI>God</HI> is, indeed. sometimes used in a lower and inferior sense in the scriptures, denoting <HI>dominion</HI> only; as when the Divine Being himself says, that <HI>he will make Moses a god to Pharaoh,</HI> Exod. vii. 1; but surely, there can be no danger of our mistaking the sense of such phrases as these; or if it were possible, our Lord himself has sufficiently guarded against any miscon∣struction of them when applied to himself, by the explanation he has given of them; informing us, that if in the language of scripture, <HI>they are called gods to whom the word of God came,</HI> John x. 35 (though, in fact, they were no other than mere men) he could not be guilty of blasphemy in calling himself only the <HI>Son of God.</HI> Now if Christ had been conscious to himself that he was the <HI>true and very God,</HI> and that it was of the utmost conse∣quence to mankind that they should regard him in that light, this was certainly a proper time for him to have declared himself, and not to have put his hearers off with such an apology as this.</P>
<P>But even this power and dominion, to which Christ is advanced by God his Father, <HI>who gave all power into his hands,</HI> and who <HI>made him head over all things to his church,</HI> Eph. i. 22, this <HI>media∣torial kingdom</HI> of Christ (as it is sometimes, and with sufficient propriety, termed) is not to be perpetual. For the apostle Paul, speaking no doubt, under immediate inspiration, expressly says, that when <HI>the end shall come, that God shall have subdued all things to his Son</HI> (in which, he observes, that <HI>he must be excepted who did subdue all thing unto him</HI>) <HI>he must deliver up the kingdom to God, even the</HI> FATHER, <HI>and he himself subject to him who had put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 24. &amp;c. Nay, he himself says expressly, that he had not the disposal of the highest offices of his kingdom, Matt. xx. 23. <HI>To sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</HI></P>
<P>So clear, my brethren, so full, and so express, is the uniform testimony of the scriptures to the great doctrine of the proper <HI>unity of God,</HI> and of the subordination of Christ, and all other beings to him, that the prevalence of so impious a doctrine, as the contrary must be, can be ascribed to nothing but to that <HI>mystery of iniquity,</HI> which though it <HI>began to work</HI> in the times of the apostles themselves, was not then risen to so enormous a height as to at∣tack the supremacy of the <HI>one living and true God,</HI> and <HI>give his peculiar glory to another.</HI> This, my brethren, among other shock∣ing corruptions of genuine christianity, grew up with the system of popery; and to shew that nothing is impossible to the superstition and credulity of men, when they are <HI>become vain in their imagi∣nations,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="018741_0015_0FA81B7C3B331720"/>
after exalting a man into a god, a creature into a creator, they made a piece of bread into one also, and then bowed down to, and worshipped, the work of their own hands.</P>
<P>But though it seemed fit to the unsearchable wisdom of God, that all the errors and abuses of popery should not be reformed at once; and though this great error was left untouched by the first reformers, blessed be God the bible is as open to us as it was to them? and by the exertion of the same judgment and spirit, we may free christianity from the corruptions which they left adhering to it; and then among other excellencies of our religion, <HI>Our Lord will be one and his name one.</HI> Zech. xiv. 9.</P>
<P>If you ask <HI>who,</HI> then, is Jesus Christ, if he be not God; I answer, in the words of St. Peter, addressed to the Jews, after his resurrection and ascension, that <HI>Jesus of Nazareth was a</HI> man <HI>ap∣proved of God, by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him.</HI> Acts ii. 22. If you ask what is meant by <HI>man,</HI> in this place; I answer, that <HI>man,</HI> if the word be used with any kind of proprie∣ty, must mean the same kind of being with yourselves. I say, moreover, with the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, that
<Q>it became him by whom are all things, and for whom are all things,</Q>
to make this great captain of our salvation in all res∣pects, like unto us his brethren, that he might be made perfect through sufferings. Heb. ii. 10.17. and that he might have a feeling of all our infirmities, iv. 13. For this reason it was that our Saviour and deliverer was not made of the nature of an <HI>angel,</HI> or like any super-angelic being, but was of <HI>the seed of Abraham,</HI> ii. 16. that is (exclusive of the divinity of the Father, which resided in him, and acted by him) a mere <HI>man,</HI> as other Jews, and as we our∣selves also are.</P>
<P>Christ being made by the immediate hand of God, and not born in the usual course of generation, is no reason for his not being considered as a man. For then Adam must not have been a man. But in the ideas of St. Paul, both <HI>the first and second Adam</HI> (as Christ, on this account, is sometimes called) were equally men; <HI>By man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead,</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 21. And, certainly, in the resurrection of a <HI>man,</HI> that is, of a person in all respects like ourselves, we have a more <HI>lively hope</HI> of our own resurrection; that of Christ being both a <HI>proof</HI> and a <HI>pattern</HI> of ours. We can, therefore, more firmly believe, that <HI>because he lives, we</HI> who are the same that he was, and who shall undergo the same change by death that He did, <HI>shall live also.</HI> John xiv. 19.</P>
<P>Till this great corruption of christianity be removed, it will be in vain to preach the gospel to Jews, or Mahometans, or, indeed, to any people who retain the use of the reason and understanding that God has given them. For how is it possible that <HI>three</HI> persons, <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> should be separately, each of them, possessed of all divine perfections, so as to be <HI>true, very,</HI> and <HI>eter∣nal</HI> God, and yet that there should be but <HI>one God;</HI> a truth which is
<PB N="17" REF="018741_0016_0FA81B7CD4B49D08"/>
so clearly and fully revealed, that it is not possible for men to re∣fuse their assent to it; or else it would, no doubt, have been long ago expunged from our creed, as utterly irreconcileable with the more favourite doctrine of a <HI>Trinity,</HI> a term which is not to be found in the scriptures. Things <HI>above</HI> our reason may, for any thing that we know to the contrary be true; but things expressly <HI>contrary</HI> to our reason, as that <HI>three</HI> should be <HI>one</HI> and <HI>one three</HI> can never appear to us to be so.</P>
<P>With the Jews, the doctrine of the Divine Unity is, and indeed justly, considered as the most fundamental principle of all religi∣on. <HI>Hear O Israel, the Lord Our God is one Lord,</HI> Deut. vi. 4. Mark xii. 29. To preach the doctrine of the Trinity to the Jews, can appear to them in no other light than an attempt to seduce them into <HI>idolatry,</HI> a thing which they dare not entertain the most distant thought of.</P>
<P>The great creed of the Mahometans, is, that <HI>There is one God, and Mahomet is his prophet.</HI> Now that Mahomet is not the prophet of God, it is to be hoped they may, in time, be made to believe; but we must not expect that they will so easily give up their faith in the unity of God. To make the gospel what it was originally, <HI>glad tidings of great joy;</HI> and as at last it certainly will be to all the nations of the world, we must free it from this most absurd and impious doctrine, and also from many other corruptions which have been introduced into it. It can no otherwise appear worthy of God, and favourable to the virtue and happiness of mankind.</P>
<P>Lest some common objections should hinder the reception of the great truth here contended for, I shall briefly consider and reply to the principle of them. It is often said that Christ speaks of his <HI>humanity</HI> only, whenever he represents himself as in∣ferior to the Father, and dependent upon him. But the scriptures themselves are far from furnishing the least hint of any such me∣thod of interpretation, though, according to the Trinitarians, it is absolutely necessary to the true understanding of them.</P>
<P>Besides, when it is applied to the passages in question, it is far from making them either true in themselves, or agreeable to the obvious purport and design of the places in which they are in∣troduced. I shall just mention a few. Could our Lord say with truth, and without an unworthy prevarication, that <HI>the Father is the only true God,</HI> John xvii. 3. if any other person, not implied in the term <HI>Father,</HI> was as much the true God as himself? Now the term <HI>Father</HI> being appropriated to what is called the <HI>first</HI> person in the godhead, cannot comprehend the <HI>Son,</HI> who is called the <HI>second.</HI> This key, therefore, is of no service in this case, and our Lord, by expressing himself as he has done, could not but lead his hearers into what is called a dangerous mistake.</P>
<P>When our Lord said that <HI>his Father was greater than he,</HI> did he make any reserve, and secretly mean, not <HI>his whole self,</HI> but only <HI>part,</HI> and the inferior part of himself the other part being equal in power and glory with the Father? How mean the pre∣varication, and how unworthy of our Lord!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="018741_0017_0FA81B7D92687A88"/>When our Lord said that <HI>the time of the day of judgment was not known to himself, the Son, but to the Father only,</HI> could he mean that his <HI>humanity</HI> only did not know it, but that his <HI>divinity</HI> (which is supposed to be intimately united with his humanity) was as well acquainted with it as the Father himself? If the human nature of Christ had been incapable of having that knowledge communicated to it, the declaration would have been needless; but as that was not the case, his hearers must necessarily understand him as speaking of himself in his highest capacity; as he certainly must do, if at all, when he speaks of himself as the <HI>Son,</HI> corresponding to the <HI>Father.</HI></P>
<P>If Christ had not satisfied the Jews that he did not mean to make himself equal with God, would they not have produced it against him at his trial, when he was condemned as a blasphemer, because he confessed that he was the Christ only: and yet no Jew expected any thing more than a man for their Messiah, and our saviour no where intimates that they were mistaken in that expectation. It is plain that Martha considered our Lord as a different person from God, and dependent upon God, when she said to him, John xi. 22. <HI>I know that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>VI.</HI> Of <HI>ATONEMENT</HI> for Sin by the Death of Christ.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have been taught by divines, that if Christ be not God, he could not have made an <HI>infinite satisfaction</HI> for the sins of mankind. But, my brethren, where do you learn that the pardon of sin, in a finite creature, requires an infinite satisfaction; or, indeed, any satisfaction at all, besides repentance and reformation, on the part of a sinner. We read in the scriptures that we are <HI>justified freely by the Grace of God,</HI> Rom. iii. 34. but what free grace, or mercy, does there appear to have been in God, if Christ gave a full price for our justification, and bore the infinite weight of divine wrath on our account. We are commanded to <HI>forgive others, as we ourselves hope to be forgiven,</HI> Matt. vii. 14. and to be <HI>merciful, as our Father, who is in heaven, is merciful.</HI> But surely we are not thereby authorized to insist upon any atonement, or satisfaction, before we give up our resentment towards an offending and penitent brother. Indeed, how could it deserve the name of <HI>forgiveness</HI> if we did? If he only <HI>repent,</HI> we are commanded to <HI>for∣give</HI> him. Luke xvii. 4.</P>
<P>You read in the scriptures that Christ died a <HI>sacrifice for our sins.</HI> Heb. ix. 26. So he did; and a sacrifice it was, of <HI>a sweet smelling savour to God.</HI> To die, as Christ did, in the glorious cause of truth and virtue; to die, as he did, in order to show us an example of patiently suffering death for our religion, and the good of man∣kind, and in a firm hope of a resurrection to a future and eternal
<PB N="19" REF="018741_0018_0FA81B7E8545BF28"/>
life; to die, as he did, in express attestation of his own divine mission, by his manifest resurrection from the dead, and as the fullest proof of that doctrine, by means of which sinners are con∣tinually reconciled unto God, was a noble sacrifice indeed. We also are commanded to <HI>yield our bodies living sacrifices.</HI> Rom. xii. 1. And we are required to offer the <HI>sacrifices of praise continually.</HI> Psal. cxvi. 17. But it is plain that all these are only figurative expressions, and used by way of comparison. Neither our <HI>bodies,</HI> nor our <HI>prayers</HI> can be considered as <HI>real</HI> sacrifices; nor are we, therefore, obliged to suppose that Christ was a real sacrifice. And though we, like him, should be called actually to <HI>lay down our lives for our brethren,</HI> 1 John iii. 16. which, in imitation of him, we are enjoined to be ready to do, we should be sacrifices only in the figurative sense of the word.</P>
<P>It is true, that no man who is a sinner (and all men have sinned) can be <HI>justified by his works.</HI> We all stand in need of, and must have recourse to, <HI>free grace</HI> and <HI>mercy;</HI> but it is a great dishonour to God to suppose that this mercy and grace takes its rise from any thing but his own essential goodness; and that he is not <HI>of himself,</HI> and independent of all foreign considerations whatever, what he solemnly declared himself to Moses, at the time of the giving of the law, to be, namely, <HI>a God merciful and gracious, long suffering, abundant in goodness and in truth.</HI> Exod. xxxiv. 6. or that he re∣quires any other sacrifices, but <HI>the sacrifices of a broken spirit, and a contrite heart, which he will never despise.</HI> Ps. li. 17.</P>
<P>Can we wish for a more distinct, and perfect representation of the manner in which God forgives the sins of his offspring of mankind, than our Saviour has exhibited to us in that most excellent parable of the <HI>prodigal son;</HI> in which the good father no sooner sees his child, who had abandoned him, and wasted his substance in riotous living, returning to him and to his duty; but without waiting for any atonement or propitiation, even <HI>while he was yet a great way off, he ran to him, fell upon his neck, and kissed him.</HI> Luke xv. 20. The same representation we see in the parable of the creditor, who freely forgave his servant, because he humbly <HI>desired</HI> him. Let us not then, my brethren, deprive the ever blessed God of the most glorious and honourable of all his attributes, and leave him nothing but <HI>justice,</HI> or rather <HI>vengeance,</HI> which is expressly said to be <HI>his strange work.</HI> Isaiah xxviii. 21.</P>
<P>It is impossible to reconcile the doctrine of the satisfaction for sin by the death of Christ, with the doctrine of <HI>free grace,</HI> which, according to the uniform tenet of the scriptures, is so fully dis∣played in the pardon of sin, and the justification of sinners. When, therefore, the apostle Paul says, Rom. iii 24. <HI>That we are justified freely by the grace of God, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</HI> the meaning of the latter clause must be interpreted in such a manner as to make it consistent with the former; and it is far from requiring any force or straining of the text to do it. For it is only necessary to suppose that our <HI>redemption</HI> (or, as the word pro∣perly
<PB N="20" REF="018741_0019_0FA81B8155C74D58"/>
signifies, and is indeed frequently rendered by our translators, our <HI>deliverance</HI>) from the power of sin, <HI>i. e.</HI> our repentance and reformation, without which there is no promise of pardon, is effected by the gospel of Jesus Christ, who came <HI>to call sinners to repentance;</HI> but still God is to be considered as the <HI>giver,</HI> and not the <HI>receiver</HI> with respect to our redemption, for we read that <HI>he spared not his own son, but gave him up for us all.</HI> Rom. viii. 32.</P>
<P>To say that God the Father provided an atonement for his own offended justice is, in fact, to give up the doctrine. If a person owe me a sum of money, and I chuse to have the debt discharged, is it not the same thing, whether I remit the debt at once, or supply another person with money wherewith to pay me to the debtor's name? If satisfaction be made to any purpose, it must be in some manner, in which the offender may be a sufferer, and the offended person a gainer; but it can never be reconciled to equity, or answer any good purpose whatever, to make the inno∣cent suffer the punishment of the guilty. If, as Abraham says, it be <HI>far from God to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked,</HI> Gen. xviii. 25. much far∣ther must it be from him to slay the righteous <HI>instead</HI> of the wicked.</P>
<P>I wish the zealous advocates for this doctrine would consider, that if it be necessary, in the nature of things, that the justice of God be satisfied before any sin can be pardoned, and Christ be God as well as the Father, whether the justice of Christ ought not to have been satisfied in the first place. If so, what other infinite being has made satisfaction to him? But if the divine nature of the Son required no satisfaction, why should the divine nature of the Father require any?</P>
<P>If it had been inconsistent with the divine justice to pardon sin upon repentance only, without some farther satisfaction, we might have expected to have found it <HI>expressly said to be so</HI> in the scriptures; but no such declaration can be produced either from the Old or the New Testament. All that can be pretended is, that it may be <HI>inferred</HI> from it. Though good works are recom∣mended to us in the strongest manner, it is never with any salvo or caution, as if they were not <HI>of themselves</HI> acceptable to God. The declarations of the divine mercy to the penitent are all abso∣lute, without the most distant hint of their having a reference to any <HI>consideration</HI> on which they are made. <HI>Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive.</HI> Psalm lxxxiv. 5. <HI>To the Lord our God be∣long mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him.</HI> Dan. ix. 3. When David and other penitents confess their sins, and intreat for pardon, they refer themselves to the divine mercy only, without seeming to have the least idea of any thing farther. <HI>Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake, O Lord.</HI> Psalm xxv. 6.</P>
<P>It is particularly remarkable, that when sacrifices under the law are expressly said not to be sufficient for the pardon of sin, we are
<PB N="21" REF="018741_0020_0FA81B82D2ABA1F0"/>
never referred to any <HI>more availing sacrifice;</HI> but to good works only.
<Q>Thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it; thou delightest not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of the Lord are a broken spirit A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. Psalm li. 16 17.</Q>
If any of the Jews had had the least notion of the necessity of any atonement for the sins of mankind, they could not but have expected a <HI>suffering Messiah;</HI> and yet it is plain that the very best of them had no such idea. And though our Saviour frequently explains the reason of his coming, and the necessity of his suffering, it is never on any such account. If he had done it any where, it might have been expected in those discourses by which he endeavoured to reconcile his disciples to his death, in his solemn prayer before his suffer∣ings, at the time of his agony in the garden, or when he was up∣on the cross; yet nothing of this kind drops from him on any of these occasions.</P>
<P>When our Lord describes the proceedings of the day of judg∣ment, he doth not represent the righteous as referring themselves to the sufferings or merit of their judge for their justification; and the judge himself expressly grounds it on their good works only. Though St. Peter, in his discourse to the Jews on the day of Pente∣cost, speaks of their sin in murdering Christ as of a heinous na∣ture, he says not a word of the necessity of any atonement, or that an ample satisfaction had just been made, by means of their very wickedness. How would a modern divine have harangued upon the occasion, and what advantage might he have taken of the cry of the Jews, <HI>His blood be upon us, and upon our children.</HI> But St. Peter only exhorts to repentance, and speaks of the death of Christ as an event that took place according to the foreknow∣ledge of God.</P>
<P>All the discourses of St. Paul upon various occasions in the book of Acts, are entirely moral. In his celebrated speech at Athens, he only urges his hearers to repentance, from the consi∣deration of a future judgment. He says not a word of what is now called the true gospel of Jesus Christ. In short, it is only from the literal interpretation of a few figurative expressions in the scriptures that this doctrine of <HI>atonement,</HI> as well as that of <HI>transubstantiation</HI> has been derived; and it is certainly a doctrine highly injurious to God; and if we, who are commanded to imi∣tate God, should act upon the maxims of it, it would be subver∣sive of the most amiable part of virtue in men. We should be implacable and unmerciful, insisting upon the uttermost farthing.</P>
<P>These, my brethren, are the principal heads on which I propo∣sed to expostulate with you, in the plain and free manner in which I have done. Do you yourselves,
<Q>search the scriptures and see whether these things be so. Pray to the God of truth to lead you into all truth, and may he give you understanding in all things.</Q></P>

<HEAD><HI>VII.</HI> Practical Consequences of the above Doctrines.</HEAD>
<P>THE found knowledge of christianity is not of importance as a matter of <HI>speculation</HI> merely; though abstract truths, especially truths that relate to God, and the maxims of his moral government, are not without their utility and obligation; but the truths that I here contend for nearly affect the sentiments of our hearts, and our conduct in life; as, indeed, has been shewn in many respects, already. Considering God as possessed of the character in which some divines represent him, it is impossible, while human nature is what it is, that he should appear in an amiable or res∣pectable light. Such a God may, indeed, be the object of <HI>dread</HI> and <HI>terror</HI> to his creatures; but by no means of their <HI>love</HI> or <HI>reverence.</HI> And what is obedience without love? It cannot be that of the <HI>heart,</HI> which, however, is the only thing that is of any real value in religion. Also, how can a man love his fellow-creatures in general, when he considers the greatest part of them as the objects of the divine abhorrence, and doomed by him to an everlast∣ing destruction, in which he believes that he himself must for ever rejoice? And what can remain of virtue, when these two great sources of it, the <HI>love of God and of mankind,</HI> are thus grossly cor∣rupted? Lastly, how must the genuine spirit of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>forgive∣ness,</HI> which so eminently distinguishes the gospel of Christ, be debased, when God himself (whose conduct in this very respect is particularly proposed to our imitation) is considered as never for∣giving sin without some previous atonement, satisfaction, or intercession.</P>
<P>On the other hand, loving God, as the compassionate Father of all his offspring, as <HI>willing that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of his truth;</HI> and also loving all mankind as our brethren, as, together with ourselves, the children of the same gracious Father, we cannot want the most generous and powerful motives <HI>to do the will of God,</HI> and <HI>to provoke one another to love, and to good works;</HI> being in no fear of counteracting the secret designs of the Almighty, which we believe are aimed, not at the destruction, but the happiness of all his creatures.</P>
<P>Think not, however, that I am so uncharitable as to suppose that all those who profess to maintain the doctrines I have been arguing against, are universally destitute of the genuine love of God, or of their fellow-creatures. I am sensible, and truly thankful, that it is not always the consequence; but it is because the hearts of such persons are really influenced by better principles than those which they avow. They by no means habitually regard the Divine Being in the light in which their principles represent him, but as the <HI>true Father</HI> of all the creatures that he has made, and, as such, sincerely desirous to promote their best interests.</P>
<P>Also, notwithstanding, if they be asked, they will not hesitate to say, that Christ is God, the supremacy of the Father, even with respect to the Son, is, at the same time, the real sentiment,
<PB N="23" REF="018741_0022_0FA81B840BED0638"/>
of their Minds; and when they lift up their hearts to God, it is only <HI>God the Father</HI> that is the proper object of their adoration. The constant tenor of the scriptures is so contrary to their professed creed, that though they dare not call it in question, it is not able to counteract the plainer, the more consistent, and the better prin∣ciples which will force themselves upon their minds from conversing with the bible.</P>
<P>Besides, it requires more subtilty and refinement to enter into the principles above-mentioned, than the common people are masters of. They cannot conceive how one man should sin, and another person, six thousand years after, be guilty of that sin, and punishable for it; how one person's righteousness should be con∣sidered as the righteousness of another; or that three distinct persons should each of them be God, and yet that there should be no more gods than one.</P>
<P>Men of plain understandings, in fact, never do believe any such thing; nor can it be supposed that the gospel, which was intended to be the solid foundation of the faith, hope, and joy of common people, should require so much acuteness, as is necessary to give even a plausible colour to these strange assertions. The attempt to explain them (and, till they be explained, they can no more be believed, than a proposition in an unkown tongue) can lead to nothing but endless and unprofitable contro∣versy. It is happy, therefore, that so many persons make a better use of the gospel than their tenets would lead them to do, and that they consider it chiefly as <HI>a rule of life,</HI> and the <HI>foundation of hope after death.</HI> But, as far as the principles I have been arguing against are believed, they cannot but do harm to those who entertain them, as well as bring disgrace upon the christian name; both which every <HI>lover of the gospel</HI> should endeavour to prevent.</P>

<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> A concise History of Opinions concerning Jesus Christ.</HEAD>
<P>YOU will say, If Christ be not really <HI>God,</HI> but merely <HI>a man,</HI> though inspired and assisted by God, how came the christian world to fall into so great an error? In return, I might ask, how, if Christ be truly God, equal to the Father, so many christians, and especially the Jewish christians, and many others in the very early ages of the christian church came to think him to be merely a man; when it may be easily conceived that, on many accounts, christians, who were continually reproached with the meanness of their master, would be disposed to <HI>add to,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="018741_0023_0FA81B845796A2A0"/>
rather than to <HI>take from</HI> his dignity? But it is not difficult to shew by what <HI>means,</HI> and by what <HI>steps,</HI> christians came to think as the generality of them now do.</P>
<P>It was the universal opinion of philosophers, at the time of the promulgation of christianity, that the souls of all men had existed before they were sent to animate the bodies that were provided for them here, and also that all souls were <HI>emanations,</HI> or <HI>parts detached</HI> from the deity. For at that time there was no idea of any sub∣stance being properly <HI>immaterial,</HI> and <HI>indivisible.</HI> When these philosophers became christians, and yet were ashamed of being the disciples of a man who had been crucified, they naturally gave a distinguished rank to the soul of Christ before he came into the world. They even went one step farther, and maintained that Christ had a body in appearance only, and not in reality, and therefore that he suffered nothing at all when he was scourged and crucified.</P>
<P>This opinion the apostle John reprobates with great severity, and even calls it <HI>Antichristian,</HI> 1 John iv. 3. whereas though it is acknowledged that the other opinion, viz. that of Christ being <HI>merely a man,</HI> existed in the times of the apostles, it is remarkable that this apostle takes no notice of it. It was plainly the doctrine of those only who maintained that Christ was not truly a man that gave this apostle any disturbance, or he could never have said as he does, 1 John iv. 2. <HI>Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh</HI> (that is, was truly a man) <HI>is of God.</HI></P>
<P>After this, philosophizing christians began to add to the pre-existent dignity of Christ in another way, and at length carried it much higher than those upon whom this apostle animadverted with so much severity. They said that Christ was originally <HI>in God,</HI> being his <HI>reason,</HI> or <HI>logos,</HI> which came <HI>out of him,</HI> and was <HI>personified</HI> before the creation of the world, in which he was the immediate agent, and that this new personage was henceforth the medium of all the divine communications to mankind, having been the person who spake to Adam in Paradise, to Noah, to Abraham, and all the patriarchs, who delivered the law from mount Sinai, and lastly inhabited the body of Jesus of Nazareth.</P>
<P>On this principle they explained many passages in the Old Testament, in which the <HI>word of God</HI> is spoken of, as that of the psalmist, <HI>by the word of the Lord were the heavens made,</HI> &amp;c. making this <HI>word</HI> to be <HI>a person,</HI> distinct from God, whose word it was; whereas nothing can be more plain, then that by the <HI>word of God</HI> in this place, is meant the <HI>power of God,</HI> exerted with as much ease as men utter words.</P>
<P>These philosophizing christians, took great pains to explain how the <HI>reason,</HI> or <HI>wisdom</HI> of God could thus become a person, distinct from God, and yet God continue a reasonable being; but their account of it is too trifling to be recited in this place. However, it was far from being pretended, in general, that the doctrine of the divinity of Christ was such a mystery as could
<PB N="25" REF="018741_0024_0FA81B851E5B06D0"/>
not be explained. For by <HI>mystery</HI> they only meant something of a solemn nature, which was unknown till it was revealed or explain∣ed. And indeed this is plainly the use of the word <HI>mystery</HI> in the New Testament; and it was also the usual meaning of the word when the present translation of the bible was made; the <HI>mysteries of any particular trade</HI> being the <HI>secrets</HI> of that trade, which yet every master taught his apprentices.</P>
<P>In this state the doctrine continued till after the council of Nice, in the year of our Lord, 325; but in all this time a real superiority was always acknowledged in the Father, as the only source of divinity; and it was even explicitly acknowledged that there was a time when the son of God had no separate existence, being only the <HI>reason of God,</HI> just as the reason of man is a part, or a property, of man. One of the most eminent of the christian Fathers says,
<Q>There was a time when God was neither a Father, nor a judge; for he could not be a Father before he had a son, nor a judge before there was sin.</Q></P>
<P>So far were they from supposing the son of God to be <HI>Equal to the Father,</HI> that when they were charged, as they frequently were, with making <HI>two Gods,</HI> they generally replied, that the son was only <HI>God of God,</HI> as having proceeded from a superior God, which is the language of the Nicene Creed; whereas the Father was <HI>God of himself (autotheos</HI>) by which they meant <HI>underived,</HI> which they held to be the prerogative of the Father only.</P>
<P>In all this time the Jewish christians who were not tainted with the heathen philosophy, maintained the doctrine of the proper and simple humanity of Christ. Athanasius himself was so far from being able to deny this, that he says all the Jews were so fully persuaded that their Messiah was to be a man like themselves, that the apostles were obliged to use great caution in divulging the doctrine of the divinity of Christ. He says that the reason why Peter, Acts ii. 22. only calls him <HI>a man approved of God,</HI> and why, on other occasions in the course of that book, and other parts of the New Testament, he is simply called <HI>a man,</HI> was that at first the apostles did not think proper to do more than prove that Jesus was the <HI>Christ,</HI> a Messiah, and that they thought it prudent to divulge the doctrine of the divinity of Christ by degrees. He likewise says, that the Jews of those times, meaning the Jewish Christians, being in this error themselves drew the Gentiles into it. Athanasius greatly commends the apostles for this address in their circumstances. But what the apostles scrupled to teach, we should be scrupulous in believing.</P>
<P>It also clearly appears from ecclesiastical history, that the un∣learned among the christians were exceedingly averse to the doc∣trine of the divinity of Christ, even in the qualified sense above mentioned, opposing what they called the supreme <HI>monarchy</HI> of the Father to the novel doctrine of the divinity of the Son; and the philosophising christians were obliged to make laboured apo∣logies to these early unitarians, acknowledging the perfect infe∣riority
<PB N="26" REF="018741_0025_0FA81B85DC387CC0"/>
of he Son to the Father. But at length these unitarians were over-borne by the superior influence and popularity of their ad∣versaries, who, from believing Christ to be God in an inferior and qualified sense of the word, came, in the natural course of things, to believe him to be God equal to the Father himself, and to have existed from all eternity indepently of him. But it was several cen∣turies before this doctrine was fully established. And the Holy spirit was generally considered either as the same thing with <HI>the power of God,</HI> that is God himself (just as the <HI>spirit of a man</HI> is a man) or else a super-angelic being, inferior both to the Father and the Son, till after the council of Nice.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Arius and his followers, shocked at the doctrine of Christ being of <HI>the same substance</HI> with the Father, maintained that, though he had pre-existed, and had been the medium of all the dipensations of God to mankind, he was, like all other deri∣ved beings, <HI>created out of nothing;</HI> the opinion of all souls having been emanations from the supreme mind being then generally denied by christians.</P>
<P>Thus did it please God, for reasons unknown to us, to permit the rise and general spread of the trinitarian and arian opinions, as he permitted the rise and amazing power of the <HI>man of sin,</HI> and many corruptions and abuses of christianity utterly subversive of the genuine purity of the gospel, till the full time for the reformation of this and other gross corruptions of christianity was come.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> A concise History of the Doctrines of Grace, Original Sin, and Predestination.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a controversy about the nature and use of baptism that occasioned the starting of the doctrine of <HI>the natural impotence of man to do what God requires of him,</HI> of the imputation of the <HI>sin of Adam</HI> to all his posterity, and of the arbitrary <HI>predestination</HI> of certain individuals of the human race to everlasting life, while the rest of mankind were left in a state of <HI>reprobation;</HI> and this was so late as four hundred years after Christ. Before that time it had been the universal opinion of christians, and of Austin himself, who first advanced the doctrines above-mentioned, that every man has the power of obeying or disobeying the laws of God, that all men may be saved if they will, and that no decrees of God will be the least obstruction in the way of any man's salvation.</P>
<P>But Pelagius, a man of good understanding, and exemplary morals, in his declamations against some abuses of baptism, asserting that baptism itself does not wash away sin, as was then generally supposed (on which account it was the custom with many to defend it till near death) nor could have been appointed for that purpose, because infants, which have no sin, are baptised, Austin in opposition to him maintained that, though infants have no <HI>actual sin</HI> of their own, they have the stain of <HI>original sin</HI> in which they were born; though he was far from asserting that Adam was the <HI>federal head</HI> of all his posterity, and that his sin was properly <HI>imputed</HI> to them.
<PB N="27" REF="018741_0026_0FA81B86B2971490"/>
This was an improvement upon the doctrine in after ages. What Austin maintained was, that men derive a <HI>corrupt nature,</HI> or a <HI>proneness to sin,</HI> from Adam.</P>
<P>Also, having been led, in the course of this controversy, to assert that by means of original sin no man had it in his power to attain to salvation, he was obliged to maintain that it depended upon the <HI>will of God</HI> only who should be finally saved, and that he <HI>predestinated</HI> whom he thought proper for that purpose, indepen∣dent of any foresight of their good works, which it was not in their power to perform without his immediate assistance, and in which he must be the first mover.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding this doctrine of the corruption of human nature, the necessity of divine grace for the production of every good thought or action, and the predestination to eternal life with∣out regard to good works, advanced by Austin, prevailed in the west, chiefly through the authority of his name, it was never re∣ceived in the eastern church, and was much controverted, and held with various modifications, in the western. Also, together with this doctrine of grace, the divines of the Roman Catholic church held the doctrine of <HI>human merit,</HI> founded on the right use of the grace of God to man. And the present doctrines of <HI>grace, original sin,</HI> and <HI>predestination,</HI> were never maintained in their full extent till after the reformation by Luther, who was a friar of the order of Austin, had been much attached to his doctrines, and made great use of them in opposing the popish doctrines, of <HI>indulgence,</HI> founded on that of <HI>merit.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> A concise History of the Doctrine of Atonement.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctrine of <HI>atonement,</HI> or of the necessity of <HI>satisfaction</HI> being made to the justice of God by the death of Christ, in order to his remitting the sins of men, arose from an abuse of the figurative language of scripture, as the doctrine of <HI>transubstanti∣ation</HI> also did. But for several centuries these figurative expressi∣ons were understood and applied in a manner very different from what they now are.</P>
<P>It was granted by some pretty early writers, that we were <HI>bought</HI> (or <HI>redeemed</HI>) <HI>with a price;</HI> but then, as we had been the slaves of <HI>sin,</HI> and were redeemed by God, who ransomed us by the death of his son, it was maintained till after the time of Austin (the principal author of all the rigid doctrines that are now called <HI>Calvinistic</HI>) that the price of our redemption was paid not <HI>to</HI> God, but <HI>by</HI> God, to the <HI>devil,</HI> in whose power we were. Of this opinion was Austin himself, who wrote largely on the subject in his treatise on the doctrine of the trinity. It was long after his time before we find any traces of it, being generally thought that the price of redemption was paid to the offended justice of God; and the present doctrine of atonement, founded on the idea of the absolute necessity of an infinite satisfaction being made by
<PB N="28" REF="018741_0027_0FA81B87A3B39E30"/>
one infinite being for offences of an infinite magnitude, as com∣mited against another infinite being, is subsequent to the refor∣mation. This doctrine was advanced by the reformers in the course of their controversy with the Papists, about the doctrine of human merit, works of penance, and the power of granting in∣dulgences. Now can it be supposed that a doctrine of so much importance, as this is always represented to be, should have been unknown so many ages?</P>
<P>Thus all these boasted ancient doctrines are in fact of late date, either having arisen from the principles of heathen philosophy, or having been started and extended in the course of controversy, one false position making another necessary for its support; and an air of awful and deep <HI>mystery</HI> has been no small recommendation of them to many of the more ignorant.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the <HI>trinity,</HI> having been one of the earliest, corruptions of christianity, will probably be one of the last to be completely eradicated. But the time, I trust, is fast approaching, when, by means of the zeal of truly enlightened and good men in this great cause, this fundamental error, which gives such great and just cause of offence to Jews and Mahometans, will be removed, and all that has been built upon it will fall to the ground.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>MY Christian brethren, if the reading of this address give rise to any <HI>doubts</HI> or <HI>scruples</HI> in your minds, with respect to some doctrines which you have been used to consider as true and <HI>fundamental</HI> in the christian religion, inquire farther; and if you be <HI>satisfied</HI> that you have hitherto been mistaken, dare to avow the truth, and act consistently with it. Dread the consequences of joining, with an enlightened mind, in the <HI>idolatrous worship of any creature,</HI> though enjoined by any human authority; re∣membering the words of Christ, <HI>thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve.</HI> Matt. iv. 10. and also that awful voice from heaven respecting all antichristian corruptions of the gospel, in mystical Babylon; <HI>Come out of her, my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI> Rev. xviii. 4.</P>
<P>Think not to avail yourselves of the wretched equivocation of many divines, who imagine that they may safely ascribe all divine honours to Jesus Christ, on account of his <HI>union with the Father,</HI> when they believe no more of his <HI>proper divinity,</HI> than professed Arians or Socinians. By this artifice they secure the reputation and emoluments of orthodoxy; but let them consider the value of the purchase, and the price they give for it. To mere wordly con∣siderations, to the <HI>praise</HI> of <HI>men,</HI> and <HI>filthy lucre,</HI> they sacrifice that <HI>integrity,</HI> for the loss of which worlds cannot compensate.</P>
<P>The publisher of these tracts does not conceal his name through the fear of any thing that <HI>men</HI> can <HI>say of him,</HI> or <HI>do to
<PB N="29" REF="018741_0028_0FA81B88D209AD00"/>
him,</HI> but merely to give what he has written a better chance of being read without prejudice. What he has done is out of a sincere good-will and compassion to the multitude, who believe they know not what, or why, and what is of more consequence, who <HI>know not what spirit they are of;</HI> but instead of <HI>speaking the truth in love,</HI> mistake bitterness and rancour for a zeal for God and his truth, and also for the sake of a better sort of people, who are unhappily drawn into the same delusions.</P>
<P>The Authors name was not printed in the first Edition.</P>
<P>Considering the deference which the common people always pay to the judgment of men of learning, there can be little doubt but that, if those persons who, having studied this subject, have been convinced that Christ is not God, and ought not to be wor∣shipped as God, had openly avowed their opinion, and had had recourse to no mean subterfuge or equivocation, this fundamental article of true and rational christianity had long ago been the prevailing belief; and our religion appearing more worthy of its divine author, there would have been at this time fewer unbelievers in all christian countries, and many more converts made to it from other religions. And, compared with this glorious advantage, what has been gained by all the arts and sophistry of ministers, who have concealed their real meaning under ambiguous expres∣sions, lest, as they pretend, they should too much shock the preju∣dices of their hearers?</P>
<P>That some regard should be paid to the prejudices of the <HI>weak</HI> is allowed; but let not this lead men to criminal dissimulation, or extend to things of so much importance as this, respecting the <HI>unity of God.</HI> In this case, let us keep at the greatest distance from every thing that is <HI>disingenuous;</HI> let the truth be spoken in the most explicit manner, and let the consequences be left to the <HI>power of truth,</HI> and the <HI>God of truth.</HI> Besides, it is impossible that while men retain depraved and unworthy notions of God, their devotion should be such as God requires; so that this pre∣tended tenderness injures those who are the objects of it, as well as bears an unfavourable aspect on the interests of christianity more at large. Such are the effects of the <HI>wisdom of this world,</HI> when it is put in the place of <HI>sincerity,</HI> and a regard to the plain <HI>truth of the gospel</HI> of Jesus Christ!</P>
<P>Professing the purity of the christian faith, let us be careful, my brethren, to adorn it by a blameless and exemplary life. More especially let us beware that we do not wear <HI>the form of godliness,</HI> when our hearts are destitute of the <HI>power</HI> of it; and that we in∣dulge no secret hope, that by any peculiar strictness and austerity of life, by frequent or long prayers, or by attending on much preaching, and using other <HI>means</HI> of religion, we shall atone for a neglect of the <HI>weight of matters</HI> of the <HI>law, righteousness, mercy and truth.</HI> Let the integrity of our hearts appear in the chear∣fulness of our countenances, and let us show that <HI>we love God whom we have not seen,</HI> by loving our <HI>brethren whom we do see,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="018741_0029_0FA81B8997920EC0"/>
and by being always ready to do them every kind office in our power.</P>
<P>To judge of our love to God, or of our love to Christ, directly, by what we <HI>feel</HI> when we think of them, especially when we are excluded from the world, as is the custom with many, is to ex∣pose ourselves to the grossest and most dangerous delusions. We find in the scriptures a much plainer, and safer method of judg∣ing in both these cases.
<Q>This, <HI>says the apostle John,</HI> is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. If ye love me, <HI>says our Lord,</HI> keep my commandments. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you; <HI>and</HI> this is my command∣ment, that ye love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.</Q></P>
<P>Remember that true christian charity is humble, modest, and diffident; and that he is pronounced to be happy, who <HI>feareth always,</HI> so as to be circumspect in thought, word, and deed; and that, for this purpose, we are to <HI>put on the whole armour of God,</HI> that we may withstand the temptations of the world.</P>
<P>Rather than indulge a Pharisaical pride, in recounting your <HI>experiences,</HI> boasting how vile you have once been, or thought yourselves to be, in order to make others believe how holy and sanctified you are now, content yourselves with the language and practice of the humble publican, who, speaking to God and his own heart only, cried, <HI>God be merciful to me a sinner.</HI></P>
<P>Rejoice in all the real good you see done by others, whatever may be their ill will, or opposition to you; and be especially upon your guard, lest your just aversion to what is corrupt in the principles or practices of others, lead you to dislike what is good in them. Let not the <HI>Pharisaical rigour</HI> of some throw you into the opposite extreme of <HI>levity;</HI> and let not their laying an undue stress upon praying, preaching, and other means of religion, make you neglect them as we are too apt to do, with respect to any thing that has been much abused.</P>
<P>Having enough to do with our own hearts, let us be particular∣ly upon our guard against that spirit of <HI>censoriousness,</HI> which ma∣ny professing christians indulge with too little restraint. Let us remember that the true christian <HI>beareth all things and hopeth all things;</HI> and let us never forget the awful warning of our Lord, "Judge not that ye be not judged: for with what judgment ye "judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</P>
<P>Be not moved, my Brethren, by the rash censures and reproach∣es of others.
<Q>Persecution, <HI>of some kind is what</HI> all who live godly in Christ Jesus must expect to suffer in this world. <HI>To their</HI> wrath, anger, clamour, evil speaking, and malice, <HI>an∣swer with</HI> the wisdom that is from above; which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated; full of mercy, and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</Q>
Let us even rejoice that we are <HI>counted worthy to suffer shame,</HI> and
<PB N="31" REF="018741_0030_0FA81B8A6CDB1BC8"/>
insult, <HI>for the sake of Christ,</HI> though our sufferings come not from the professed enemies of Christ, but from <HI>false brethren;</HI> and let us not be concerned at being counted <HI>deceivers,</HI> if we be conscious to ourselves that we truly love the gospel, and that we labour to promote and adorn it.</P>
<P>You will be called <HI>Arminians</HI> and <HI>Socinians</HI> by your adversaries, or something else that shall express more of their hatred and dis∣like. But let not this offend you. If there be any proper mean∣ing in those epithets, it can only be that you hold certain opinions which they deem to be false, but which you cherish, as the only genuine doctrines of the gospel. If nothing more is meant by those terms, besides mere <HI>reproach</HI> and <HI>abuse,</HI> think yourselves happy, as being <HI>reproached for the name of Christ.</HI> 1 Peter, iv. 14. With many the appellation of <HI>Lutheran</HI> or <HI>Calvinist</HI> is reproach∣ful, and with many also, that of <HI>Christian</HI> is much more so. Besides, both Arminius and Socinus were men who loved the gospel, and who suffered more for their adherence to it, than most others of the Reformers, especially Socinus.</P>
<P>If we be Christians indeed, we shall consider ourselves as <HI>not of this world,</HI> but <HI>as citizens of heaven. The friendship of this world,</HI> therefore, together with popularity, and success in it, ought not to be considered as any object for us. If we <HI>abide in Christ,</HI> and <HI>walk even as he also walked,</HI> not <HI>being conformed to this world, but being transformed by the renewing of our minds,</HI> we are <HI>heirs of a far</HI> nobler inheritance, <HI>an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for us;</HI> and <HI>when Christ, who is our life, and for whom we suffer reproach shall ap∣pear, we also shall appear with him in glory.</HI></P>
<P>I shall conclude this address with a word of advice and exhor∣tation to all <HI>unitarians,</HI> whether they be members of the establish∣ed church or of any society of <HI>dissenters</HI> in this country.</P>
<P>Of such great importance is the doctrine of the <HI>divine unity;</HI> that nothing will more fully justify a separation from any christian church that does not openly profess it, and much more from those that avow the contrary doctrine, directing prayers, and paying supreme worship, to any other than the <HI>God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>It was for the preservation of this great and fundamental doc∣trine, that Abraham, and his family by Isaac and Jacob, were separated from the rest of the world, and made a distinct people, as it were to be the depositaries of the true religion, which con∣sists principally in the sole worship of the one true and living God, the maker and preserver of all things. The same important doctrine was uniformly taught by Christ and the apostles; though christians in after times, like the Israelites after the time of Joshua, relapsed into that idolatry which has generally prevailed to this day</P>
<P>If it was a sufficient justification of the first reformers, that they considered the church from which they separated as worshipping
<PB N="32" REF="018741_0031_0FA81B8D48D323D8"/>
saints and angels; will it not justify your separation from their partial reformations, that you consider them as praying to and worshipping one whom you consider as a <HI>man</HI> like yourselves, though honoured and distinguished by God above all other men?</P>
<P>To join habitually in public worship with trinitarians, is countenancing that worship, which you must consider as <HI>idolatrous;</HI> and which, however innocent in them, is highly criminal in you. If they think it a point of conscience not to go to mass in popish churches because, in their opinion, it is idolizing a <HI>piece of bread,</HI> you ought to make a point of conscience of not worshipping with them, because in your opinion it is idolizing <HI>a man,</HI> who is as much a creature of God as a piece of bread, and just as impro∣per an object of worship.</P>
<P>Besides, the great offence to Jews, Mahometans, and the world at large, being the doctrine of the <HI>trinity,</HI> it is highly necessary that societies of christians should be formed expressly on this principle of the <HI>divine unity,</HI> that it may be evident to all the world, that there are christians, and societies of christians, who hold the doctrine of the trinity in as much abhorrence as they themselves can do. For the conversion of Jews or Mahometans to christianity, while it is supposed to contain the doctrine of the trinity, no person who knows, or has heard of Jews or Mahome∣tans, can ever expect.</P>
<P>You will say We unitarians are but few, even in large towns, and still fewer in villages, and there are no men of leisure or learning among us. But was not this the case with the primitive christians, and yet this circumstance was no obstruction to the forming of a christian church in any place. We read of churches in private houses.</P>
<P>Assemble together, therefore, in the name and in the fear of God, and according to the order of the gospel, every Lord's-day, if there be no more that <HI>two or three,</HI> or even a single family of you in a place; read the scriptures, and pray together. Also read sermons, or other works of moral instruction, of which there is, happily, no want at this day. Baptize, and administer the Lord's supper among yourselves; and as you grow more numer∣ous, form yourselves upon some regular plan of church discipline; that it may be the means af uniting and keeping you together; and rigorously exclude all persons whose conduct would be a reproach to you.</P>
<P>As to a <HI>learned ministry,</HI> it is acknowledged to be desirable, where it can be had, but it is by no means necessary. The gravest and most respectable persons among you, and those who have the most leisure, will, in the character of <HI>elders,</HI> select and read proper prayers and discourses, and perform all the of∣fices of christian societies, just as well as the elders in the primi∣tive churches, who had no such helps as you now have; and miraculous powers were not of long continuance with them.</P>
<P>If you be at present members of the established church, you
<PB N="33" REF="018741_0032_0FA81B8D7655F538"/>
will find <HI>a reformed liturgy</HI> ready prepared for your use by Mr. Lindsey. But if you should prefer the mode of worship among the Dissenters (but men of sense will not make much account of such distinctions) you may in many authors, especially at the end of Mr. Holland's sermons, find forms of such prayers as you have been used to: or you may apply to dissenting ministers of your acquaintance, who will chearfully give you any assistance in their power.</P>
<P>All these are trifling obstacles to a great design. It requires in∣deed a proper degree of chrstiain <HI>zeal;</HI> but the object is worthy of it. The example has been already set in Scotland, where it was least of all to be expected; and the success has been such as should abundantly encourage similar attempts in this country.</P>
<P>The Baptists and Methodists, not laying much stress upon a learned ministry, flourish greatly, the Independents are now taking the same methods, and with the same success; while the rational Dissenters, fancying they would be disgraced by the want of a learned ministry, are dwindling away almost every where.</P>
<P>Whatever inconvenience may arise from mere <HI>novelty,</HI> it is soon over; and as the Methodists are collecting into bodies in all places; a thing of this kind will excite much less surprize. But what impression ought the censure of the world to make upon those who, as christians, profess to be <HI>above the world,</HI> and to <HI>rejoice that they are counted worthy to suffer shame</HI> in the cause of Christ, and to think themselves <HI>happy</HI> if they be <HI>reproached</HI> on that account. You should imagine that you hear that awful <HI>voice from heaven,</HI> recorded in the book of Revelation, ch. xviii. 24. <HI>Come out of her</HI> (i. e. of mystical Babylon, the great source of all the corruptions of christianity) <HI>my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI></P>
<P>Be careful, however, to do this in the spirit of christian charity, which should be extended to all men, but especially to all that bear the christian name. Consider them as men who are in an error, which is always involuntary. Endeavour to remove the prejudices they unhappily lie under, but forbear all angry reproaches, all insult, and even ridicule; for religion is a serious thing, and <HI>brotherly love</HI> is the very essence of it. And if this love is to be extended even to <HI>enemies,</HI> much more should it be indulged towards our merely <HI>mistaken friends.</HI></P>
<P>The author of this address intirely approves of <HI>Mr. Lindsey's Liturgy,</HI> or that which was used at the Octagon Chapel in Liverpool; and he would recommend <HI>responses</HI> especially to societies formed in this manner, in which it is particularly desir∣able, that the members, bring nearly on a level, should each bear his part in the service. But lest some, from the force of habit, should not be able to reconcile themselves to the use of a liturgy, and object to the scheme on that account, he intends, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should appear to be wanted, to draw up, or complie and publish, a set of <HI>Forms for all the occasions of a christian society.</HI></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE TRIAL OF MR. E. ELWALL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS trial is printed from the author's second edition, even without altering such phrases as are peculiar to that deno∣mination of christians with whom he generally associated, and whose style he adopted; and certainly the Quakers ought to think themselves honoured even by this kind of relation to Mr. Elwall. Such firmness in the cause of truth, and such presence of mind in asserting and vindicating it, as appear in this trial, are truly apostolical, and have had but few examples since the first pro∣mulgation of christianity. It is impossible for an unprejudiced person to read this account of it (which is written with so much true simplicity, perspicuity, and strength of evidence) without feel∣ing the greatest veneration for the writer, the fullest conviction and love of the truth, and a proportionable zeal in maintaining it. I should even think it impossible for the most prejudiced person to read it attentively, but, if he use no violence with his own mind, he will receive some favourable impressions both of the author, and of that cause, which he supports with such becoming dignity, and with a temper and disposition of mind, in every respect worthy of a true christian.</P>
<P>So great was the force of truth on this memorable occasion, that a reputable and honest Jury, directed by a good-natured and sensible judge, acquitted the criminal contrary to the express laws of this country, according to which this glorious man ought to have been sentenced to a severe punishment, as a convicted and avowed <HI>blasphemer.</HI> What must a lover of <HI>truth,</HI> and of <HI>free inquiry,</HI> as subservient to truth, think of such laws, and of the ecclesiastical constitution of the countries in which they are in force!</P>
<P>It is to be wished that such a monument of the TRIUMPH OF TRUTH might be constantly held out to the view of all mankind, and particularly in this country where it was exibited.</P>
<P>The Dedication of the treatise, on account of which Mr. Elwall was prosecuted, is dated <HI>the eighth day of the second month,</HI> 1724; he speaks of his trial in a treatise intitled, <HI>A declaration against all kings and temporal powers under heaven,</HI> printed in 1732; and Judge Denton, before whom he was tried, went the Oxford circuit in 1726 and 1728. From these circumstances it may be concluded, that the former of these years is the date of this remarkable trial, especially as in some part of the same year 1726. Mr. Elwall published another defence of the unitarian system, in a treatise which he intitled <HI>Dagon fallen before the Ark of God,</HI> which would probably have been mentioned in the course of the trial, if it had been published at that time.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH; BEING AN ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL OF MR. ELWALL. for HERESY and BLASPHEMY, at STAFFORD ASSIZES.</HEAD>
<P>BECAUSE so many persons have earnestly desired to read this trial, I have here published a second edition of it, in order to encourage all honest men, who have the eternal law of God on their side, not to fear the faces of priests, who are gene∣rally the grand adversaries of liberty and truth; and the bastions and bulwarks of all ceremonies, sopperies, and absurd doctrines that are in the world.</P>
<P>I do this for the glory of the Most High God, and for the ho∣nour of his sacred law, and for the good of all my fellow creatures; that they may obey God, and not man; Christ, and not the pope; the prophets and apostles, and not prelates and priests; and God knoweth this is my sincere desire, that all religion and spiri∣tual things may be perfectly free, neither forced nor hindered; this being the true liberty of the gospel of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who said, <HI>The kings of the Gentiles exercise authority, but it shall not be so with you.</HI></P>
<P>About fourteen years ago, I wrote a book intitled,
<Q>A True Testimony for God and his sacred Law; being a plain, honest defence of the first commandment of God, against all the Tri∣nitarians under heaven, <HI>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me.</HI></Q>
I lived then at <HI>Wolverhampton,</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> where my ancest∣ors have lived above eleven hundred years, ever since the <HI>Saxons</HI> conquered the <HI>Britons.</HI></P>
<P>When this book was published, the priests in the country began to rage, especially the priests of <HI>Wolverhampton;</HI> who had a great hand in the several troubles I underwent, In short, they never ceased till they had procured a large indictment against me at <HI>Stafford</HI> assizes; where I felt the power of God, enabling me to speak before a very great number of people; being accused of heresy, &amp;c. But I truly answered as my beloved brother <HI>Paul</HI> did in his day, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>In that way which some call heresy, so chuse I to serve the God of my fathers, believing all that is written in the law and the prophets.</Q></P>
<P>After the long indictment was read, I was asked if I pleaded guilty, or not guilty. I said I was not guilty of any evil, that I knew of, in writing that book; but if they meant whether I wrote the book or not (for they had quoted many pages of the
<PB N="36" REF="018741_0035_0FA81B9054859DC8"/>
book in that indictment) I owned I did write it; and that if I might have liberty to speak, I believed I should make it manifest to be the plain truth of God.</P>
<P>Then the judge stood up and said,
<Q>Mr. <HI>Elwall,</HI> I suppose you have had a copy of your indictment?</Q>
I told him I had not had any copy of it. Upon which he turned towards the priests, and told them that I ought to have had a copy of it. But they not answering, he turned to me, and said, That if I would give bail, and be bound to appear at the next assizes, he would defer my trial till then. But I told him, I would not give bail, neither should any man be bound for me; that if the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> himself would, he should not; for, said I, I have an inno∣cent breast, and I have injured no man; and therefore I desire no other favour, but that I may have liberty to plead to the indictment myself.</P>
<P>Upon which he said, very courteously, You may. The judge having given me liberty of pleading to the indictment, I began my speech with the sacred first commandment of God, viz. <HI>Thou shalt have no other Gods but Me.</HI> I insisted upon the word <HI>Me</HI> being a singular; and that it was plain and certain, that God spake of himself, as one single person or being, and not three distinct persons. And that it was manifest, that all the church of God, which then heard those words, understood it in the same plain obvious sense as I do; as is most evident from the words of the prophet <HI>Moses;</HI> who said to Israel thus;
<Q>Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know, that the Lord he is God, there is none else besides him; out of heaven he made thee hear his voice, &amp;c.</Q>
I told them, that from the words <HI>he,</HI> and <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>his,</HI> it was certain God was but one single person, one single <HI>he,</HI> or <HI>him,</HI> or <HI>his.</HI> I told them, that all the patriarchs from the beginning of the world, did always address themselves to God, as one single being. <HI>O</HI> thou <HI>Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth;</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> said to the king of <HI>Sodom, I have lift up my hand unto the Lord, the Most High God, the possessor of heaven and earth, &amp;c.</HI> They knew nothing of a trinity, nor of God's being a plurality of persons; that monstrous doctrine was not then born, nor for two thousand years after, till the apos∣tacy and Popery began to put up its filthy head.</P>
<P>Then I told them, that all the prophets witnessed to the truth of the same pure uncorrupted unitarian doctrine <HI>of one God, and no other but he: Have we not all one Father, hath not one God crea∣ted us?</HI> Then I told them the word of God to <HI>Abraham, I am God Almighty, walk before me, and be thou perfect;</HI> and by the prophet <HI>Isaiah, To whom will ye <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, or shall I be equal, saith the holy One,</HI> not the holy Three. I told them that the words <HI>Me</HI> and <HI>One</HI> did utterly exclude any other person's being God, but that <HI>One</HI> single <HI>Me;</HI> and that God himself often testi∣fies the same truth, by saying, <HI>Is there any God besides Me?</HI> And then tells us plainly, <HI>There is no God, I know not any: I am
<PB N="37" REF="018741_0036_0FA81B911B8D44B8"/>
the Lord, and there is none else: there is no God besides me.</HI> Isaiah xlv. 5.</P>
<P>Now, said I, let God be true, but every man a liar, that is, every man that contradicteth him; for he is the God of truth; he says, <HI>I lift up my hand to heaven, I say, I live for ever.</HI></P>
<P>After I had pleaded many texts in the Old Testament, I began to enter the New: and told them, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the prophet, like unto <HI>Moses,</HI> held forth the same doctrine that <HI>Moses</HI> had done; for when a certain ruler came to ask him which was the first and great commandment (or how he expounded it) he told him the same words that <HI>Moses</HI> had said. <HI>Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord,</HI> not three, <HI>and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</HI> &amp;c. and the scribe said, <HI>Thou hast answered right for there is but one God, and there is no other but he,</HI> &amp;c. Then I mentioned the words of Christ, in the xviith of <HI>John</HI> and ver. 3. as very remarkable and worthy of all their observa∣tion: <HI>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI> And then I turned my face directly to the priests (my prosecutors, who all stood on the right side of the judge) Now said I, since the lips of the blessed Jesus, which always spoke the truth, says, his Father is the only true God; who is he, and who are they that dare set up another, in contra∣diction to my blessed Lord, who says, his Father is <HI>the only true God?</HI></P>
<P>And I stopped here, to see if any of them would answer; but the power of God came over them, so that all their mouths were shut up, and not one of them spake a word. So that I turned about over my left shoulder, and warned the people in the fear of God, not to take their religious sentiments from men, but from God; not from the Pope, but from Christ; not from Prelates nor Priests, but from the Prophets and Apostles.</P>
<P>And then I turned towards the judge and told him, that I was the more convinced of the truth of what I had said, from the words of my bessed Lord; who said, <HI>Call no man Father here upon earth; for one is your Father, even God, And call no man Master, for one is your Master, even Christ.</HI> From hence, said I, I deduce this natural inference, that in all things that are of a spiritual nature, we ought to take our religion from God and his prophets, from Christ and his apostles. It will be too long to mention all the texts and proofs that I made use of; I will only add one or two, as that of <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. viii. 4, 5, 6. where the apostle tells us, <HI>There is no other God but one; for though there be that are called gods (as there be gods many, and lords many) both in heaven and earth; but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things:</HI> so that I told them here was a plain demon∣stration; for he says, <HI>there is but one God;</HI> and tells us who that one God is, that is, <HI>the Father.</HI> And therefore no other person could be God but the Father only; and what I had wrote in my book was the plain truth, and founded on God's own words, <HI>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="018741_0037_0FA81B91D9663E38"/>In short, I could plainly perceive there was a general convince∣ment through the court. The judge and justices of the peace did not like the prosecution; but saw plainly, that <HI>out of envy the priests had done it.</HI> I then began to set before them the odious nature of that hell-born principle of persecution, and that it was hatched in hell; that it never came from Jesus Christ; that he and his followers were often persecuted themselves, but they never persecuted any; that we had now a very flagrant instance of it by the papists at <HI>Thorn;</HI> where they first took away the schools where our brethren the protestants educated their children; then they took away the places of their religious worship; then they put them in prisons; then confiscated their estates, and, last of all, took away their lives.</P>
<P>Now we can cry out loud enough against this, and show the inhumanity, cruelty, and barbarity of it; but, said I, if we, who call ourselves <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, shall be found acting in the same spirit, against others, the crime will be greater in us than in them because we have attained to greater degrees of light than they.</P>
<P>However, I told them, that I had put my house in order and made up my accounts with all men as near as I could: and that as I owed no man here any thing, so I would not pay a penny towards this prosecution, And that I was sure of it, that whatever fine they laid on me, or whatever hole or prison, said I, you thrust me into, I shall find God's living presence with me, as I feel it this day: And so ended my speech.</P>
<P>Upon this a justice of the peace, one <HI>Rupert Humpatch,</HI> got up, went to the judge, laid his hand upon the judge's shoulder, and said, My Lord, I know this man to be an honest man; and what I say, I speak not by by hear say, but experience; for I was his next door neighbour three years. Also another justice spoke to the same effect. Then the judge spoke to me: Mr. <HI>Elwall,</HI> I perceive you have studied very deeply into this controversy; but have you ever consulted any of our reverend clergy, and bishops of the church of <HI>England,</HI> I answered Yes, I have; and among others the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> himself, with whom I have exchanged ten letters, viz. four I have had from him, and six he has had from me. [At which words, all the priests stared very earnestly.] Well, says the judge, and was not the archbishop able to give you some satisfaction in these points, Mr. <HI>Elwall?</HI> I said, no; but rather quite the reverse; for that in all the letters I sent to the archbishop, I grounded my argu∣ments upon the word of God and his prophets, Christ and his apostles; but in his answers to me, he referred me to acts of parlia∣ment, and declarations of state, &amp;c. whereas I told the bishop, in one of my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that I wondered a man of his natural and acquired abilities, should be so weak as to turn me over to human authorities, in things of a divine nature; for though in all things that are of a temporal nature, and concern the civil society, <HI>I will be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
<PB N="39" REF="018741_0038_0FA81B92A4616290"/>
sake;</HI> even from the king upon the throne, down to the meanest officer in the land; but in things that are of a spiritual nature, and concern my faith; my worship of God, and future state, I would <HI>call no man father here upon earth,</HI> nor regard either popes or councils, prelates or priests of any denomination, nor convo∣cations, nor assemblies of divines: but obey God and his pro∣phets, Christ and his apostles. Upon which the judge answered, Well, if his Grace of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was not able to give you satis∣faction Mr <HI>Elwall,</HI> I believe I shall not: and so sat down and and rested him, for I think he had stood up for near an hour and a quarter.</P>
<P>Then he stood up again, and turning to the priests, talked softly to them. I did not hear what he said, or what they said to him; but I guessed from what the judge said next, for, says he, Mr. <HI>Elwall,</HI> you cannot but be sensible that what you have writ, being contrary to the commonly received doctrines of the church, it has given offence to some of your neighbours, and particularly to the clergy; are you willing to promise, before the face of the country here, that you will not write any more on this head? I answered, God forbid that I should make thee any such promise; for when I wrote this book, I did it in the fear of God; and I did not write it to please the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> nor the church of <HI>England,</HI> nor the church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but to please that God who gave me my breath; and therefore, if at any time I find myself drawn forth to write in defence of this sacred first commandment, or any other of the ten, I hope I shall do it in the same spirit of sincerity as I have done this. And I perceived the judge was not in any wise displeased at my honest, plain, bold answer, but rather his heart seemed to be knit in love to me; and he soon declared me acquitted: and then the clerk of the arrraigns, or assizes, stood up, and said, Mr. <HI>Elwall</HI> you are acquitted: you may go out of court when you please.</P>
<P>So I went away through a very great croud of people (for it was thought there was a thousand people at the trial) and having spoken long I was a-thirst, so went to a well and drank. Then went out of town by a river-side, and looking about and seeing no one near, I kneeled down on the bank of the river and sent up my thank offering to that good God who had delivered me out of their hands.</P>
<P>By the time that I returned to the town, the court was up and gone to dinner: a justice of peace and another person met me, and would have me to eat and drink with them, which I did: and after∣wards as I was walking along the street, some persons hove up a great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-window and invited me up to them, and when I entered the room, I found ten or a dozen persons, most of them justices of the peace, and amongst them a priest, whom they called Doctor. One of the justices took me by the hand, and said Mr. <HI>Elwall,</HI> I am heartily glad to see you, and I was glad to hear you bear your testimony so boldly as you did. Yes, says another justice, and I was glad <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. <HI>Elwall</HI> came off with flying colours as he did:</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="018741_0039_0FA81B9355C51308"/>Upon which the Priest said (in a very bitter manner) <HI>He ought to have been hanged.</HI> I turned unto him, and said Friend, I per∣ceive <HI>thou dost not know what spirit thou art of; for the son of man came not to destroy but to save,</HI> But thou wouldest have me destroyed. Upon which one of the justices said, How, now Doctor, did not you hear one of the justices say, that he was an honest man, and that what he said, was not by hear-say, but by experience, and would you have honest men hanged. Doctor? Is this good doctrine? So that the priest said but little more for some time.</P>
<P>So I took leave of the justices, and took horse for <HI>Wolverhamp∣ton,</HI> for I knew there would be great joy in my family, for the common people all expected to hear of my being fined and impri∣soned. But a farmer that lived near, who had been upon the jury at <HI>Stafford</HI> got to town before me, and the people went all up and asked him. What have they done to Mr. <HI>Elwall?</HI> Have they put him in prison? He answered
<Q>No, he preached there an hour together, and our parsons could say never a word. What must they put him in prison for? I told our foreman of the jury. Mr. <HI>Elwall</HI> was an honest man, and his father was an honest man, I knew him very well</Q>
so they were all damped. But there was great joy in my family, and amongst all my friends: Praises, living praises be attributed to that good God who deliver∣ed me out of their hands!</P>
<P>Christ never told us of that scandalous popish invention, of his human nature praying to his divine nature: but, like a true obedient son of God, submitted to death, even that cruel death which the hatred and envy of persecuting wicked priests inflicted on him, because he had so plainly and truly told them all of their blindness, covetousness, pride, and hypocrisy. And therefore <HI>God raised him from the dead;</HI> and for his faithfulness, <HI>God has exalted him to be a prince and a saviour</HI> to all those that obey that pure doctrine which God gave him to teach; <HI>that denying ungod∣liness and sinful lusts, we should live soberly and righteously in this world Then are we his disciples indeed, when we do those things that he hath commanded.</HI> Then shall we be saved, not by the merits of <HI>Christ,</HI> that is another popish invention; for he never did any thing but what was his duty to do, and therefore could not merit any thing for others: but he taught us the true way to find acceptance with God, and that was by "doing the will of his Father which is in heaven: and therein he is the way, the truth, and the life, "because no one cometh unto the Father, but by that way.</P>
<P>Neither did he make satisfaction unto God for us. It was im∣possible: and what God never required: But
<Q>he who had no pleasure in the death of sinners, but rather that they should turn from wickedness and live,</Q>
out of the immeasureable height and depth of his love, directed our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to teach man∣kind a never failing way of being reconciled to God, and that was by sincere repentance and reformation. This was the gospel
<PB N="41" REF="018741_0040_0FA81B9415876210"/>
or good tidings of <HI>Jesus Christ, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</HI> He tells us, <HI>I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;</HI> and by that beautiful excellent parable of the prodigal son, he illustrates the tender mercy of his God, and our God, of his Father and our Father, without any satisfaction. The compassionate Father required none at all, but humble con∣fession and submission, with sincere repentance, and reformation, and then comes <HI>the best robe, the ring, the shoes, and the fatted calf,</HI> to demonstrate the paternal acceptance without satisfaction or sacrifice, <HI>but a broken and a contrite heart which he will never re∣fuse;</HI> for he can as soon cease to be God, as cease to be merciful.</P>
<P>And as to the trinitarians, nothing is more plain, than that they feed upon ashes: <HI>a deceived heart hath turned them aside,</HI> because they will not make use of those rational faculties which God hath given them; nor say, <HI>Is there not a lye in my right hand?</HI> other∣wise they would never flatter the humble <HI>Jesus,</HI> nor make the most high God to be a plurality of persons.</P>
<P>For as to the Holy Ghost (their third God) it is evidently no distinct person from God, any more than a man's spirit is a dis∣tinct person from the man; so that the Spirit of God is God's spirit; as is manifest from scripture and reason, Gen. vi. 3.
<Q>My spirit shall not always strive with man: And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters: And God said, Let there be light, and there was light. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters And God made all things by the word of his power.</Q>
So that the word of God, and the spirit of God, are not distinct persons from God, but the power of God, and the energy of God. So the word of a man, and the spirit of a man, are not distinct persons from the man, but the man himself; if his word be false, or his spirit be wicked, the man is false and wicked.</P>
<P>The same degree of stupidity that leads trinitarians to call the word of God, and the spirit of God, distinct persons, would lead them to call the wisdom of God, the goodness of God, the love of God, the peace of God, the power of God, and the mercy of God, distinct persons; and make God to be a trinity of trinities: for it is certain, God is expressly called by all those names.</P>
<P>But whosoever goes about to father this absurd and horrid doctrine of the trinity upon Jesus Christ, do egregiously abuse him; who told us plainly, <HI>his Father was greater than he; and that he could do nothing of himself,</HI> which is a demonstration that he is not God: For we are sure God is omnipotent, and can do all things of himself; being self-existent and independent, the supreme cre∣ator of the universe; and in this it is, that the unitarians triumph as unswerable, believing in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who told us his Father was <HI>the only true God,</HI> John xvii. 3.</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> By these last words of <HI>Christ,</HI> I myself was convinced many years ago.</P>

<HEAD>A GENERAL VIEW OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR THE UNITY OF GOD;</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Arguments from reason against the trinitarian hypothesis.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the doctrine of the trinity could ever have been suggested by any thing in the course of nature (though it has been imagined by some persons of a peculiarly fanciful turn, and previously persuaded of the truth of that doctrine) is not maintained by any persons to whom my writings can be at all use∣ful. I shall therefore only address myself to those who believe the doctrine on the supposition of its being contained in the scriptures, at the same time maintaining, that, though it is <HI>above,</HI> it is not properly <HI>contrary</HI> to reason; and I hope to make it sufficiently evident, either that they do not hold the doctrine, or that the doctrine of <HI>three divine persons constituting one God</HI> is strictly speaking an <HI>absurdity,</HI> or <HI>contradiction;</HI> and that it is therefore in∣capable of any proof, even by miracles. With this view, I shall recite in order all the distinct modifications of this doctrine, and shew that, upon any of them, there is either no proper <HI>unity,</HI> in the divine nature, or no proper <HI>trinity.</HI></P>
<P>If, with Dr. Waterland, and others who are reckoned the strictest Athanasians (though their opinions were not known in the time of Athanasius himself) it be supposed that there are three persons properly equal, and that no one of them has any sort of superiority over the rest, they are, to all intents and purposes, three distinct Gods. For if each of them, separately considered, be possessed of all divine perfections, so that nothing is wanting to complete divinity, each of them must be as properly <HI>a God</HI> as any being possessed of all the properties of man must be a man; and therefore <HI>three persons</HI> possessed of all the attributes of divinity must be as properly <HI>three Gods</HI> as three persons possessed of all hu∣man attributes must be three men. These three persons, there∣fore, must be incapable of any strict or numerical <HI>unity.</HI> It must be universally true, that <HI>three things</HI> to which the same definition applies can never make only <HI>one thing</HI> to which the same definition applies. And when by the words <HI>thing, being,</HI> or <HI>person</HI> we mean nothing more than, logically speaking, the <HI>subject,</HI> or <HI>substratum of properties</HI> or <HI>attributes,</HI> it is a matter of indifference which of them we make use of.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="018741_0043_0FA81B967AF4A2D8"/>Each of these three persons may have other properties, but they must be numerically <HI>three</HI> in that respect in which the same defi∣nition applies to them. If, therefore, the three persons agree in this circumstance, that they are each of them <HI>perfect God,</HI> though they may differ in other respects, and have peculiar relations to each other, and to us, they must still be <HI>three Gods;</HI> and to say that they are only <HI>one God</HI> is as much a contradiction, as to say that three men, though they differ from one another as much as three men can do, are not three men, but only one man.</P>
<P>If it be said, with the ante-nicene fathers, and with bishops P<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arson and Bull among the modern English writers, that the Father is the fountain of deity, and that the son is derived from him, whether necessarily or voluntarily, whether in time or from all eternity, they cannot be of the same <HI>rank;</HI> but the Father will be possessed of an original, a real, and proper superiority to the Son; who will be no more than an <HI>effect</HI> of the Father's exertion of his powers, which is, to all intents and purposes, making the Son to be a <HI>production,</HI> or <HI>creature</HI> of the Father; even though it should be supposed with the antients that he was created out of the substance of the Father, and without taking any thing from him. Moreover, as upon this scheme the Son was never capable of giving birth to another person like himself, he must have been originally inferior in power to the Father, the source from which he himself sprung. On this scheme, therefore, there is no proper <HI>equality</HI> between these divine persons; and the ante-nicene fathers did not pretend that there was, but distinguished the Father by the epithet of (<HI>autotheos) God of himself,</HI> and the Son by the inferior title of (<HI>theos ek theou God of God,</HI> or a derived God.</P>
<P>If it be said that there is but one intelligent supreme mind, but that it exerts itself three different ways, and has three different modes of action, or operation (which was the opinion of Dr. Wallis, and that which was generally ascribed to the antient Sa∣bellians) with respect to one of which the same divine Being was called the Father, to another the Son, and another the Holy Spi∣rit; there is no proper <HI>trinity,</HI> at all. For on the same principle one man bearing three different offices, or having three different relations or capacities, as those of magistrate, father, son, &amp;c. would be three different men.</P>
<P>Some represent themselves as believing the doctrine of the trinity by asserting with Dr. Doddridge, that
<Q>God is so united to the derived nature of Christ, and does so dwell in it, that, by virtue of that <HI>union,</HI> Christ may be properly called God, and such regards become due to him, as are not due to any created nature, or mere creature, be it in itself ever so excellent.</Q></P>
<P><HI>See his Lectures, proposition</HI> 128, p. 392.</P>
<P>What this <HI>union</HI> is, in consequence of which any creature can be entitled to the attributes and honours of his creator, is not pretended to be explained; but as we cannot possibly have any idea of an union between God and a creature, besides that of
<PB N="45" REF="018741_0044_0FA81B97B0B7D128"/>
God being present with that creature, and acting by him, which is the same thing that is asserted by the <HI>Arians</HI> or <HI>Socinians,</HI> those nominal <HI>trinitarians</HI> must necessarily belong to one or other of these two classes This is so evident, that it is hardly possible not to suppose but that they must have been much assisted at least in deceiving themselves into a belief that they were trinitarians, by the influence which a dread of the odium and other inconvenien∣ces attending the Arian or Socinian doctrine had on their minds. The presence of God the Father with any creature, whether it be called an union with him, or it be expressed in any other manner whatever, can be nothing more than the <HI>deity of the Father</HI> in that creature; and whatever it be that God voluntarily imparts, he may withdraw again at pleasure. And what kind of divinity must that be, which is dependent upon the will of another?</P>
<P>Upon none of the modifications, therefore, which have been mentioned (and all others may be reduced to these) can the doc∣trine of the trinity, or of three divine persons in one God be sup∣ported. In most of them the doctrine itself is lost, and where it remains, it is inconsistent with reason and common sense.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Arguments from Reason against the Arian Hypothesis.</HEAD>
<P>THE Arian doctrine, of the world having been made and governed not by the supreme God himself, but by Christ, the son of God, though no contradiction in itself, is upon several accounts highly improbable.</P>
<P>Our reasoning from effects to causes, carries us no farther than to the immediate creator of the visible universe. For if we can suppose that being to have had a cause, or author, we may sup∣pose that his cause or author had a higher cause, and so on <HI>ad in∣finitum.</HI> According to the light of nature, therefore, the imme∣diate cause or author of the visible universe, is the self-existent first cause, and not any being acting under him, as his instrument. However, the scheme itself is not naturally impossible; since a being possessed of power sufficient to produce the visible universe, which is a limited production, may be <HI>finite,</HI> and therefore may de∣rive his power and his being from one who is superior to him. But though the Arian scheme cannot be said to be in itself impossible, it is on several accounts, extremely improbable <HI>a priori,</HI> and therefore ought not to be admitted without very strong and clear evidence.</P>
<P>If this great derived being, the supposed maker and governor of the world, was united to a human body, he must either have re∣tained and have exercised his extraordinary powers during this union, or have been divested of them; and either supposition has its peculiar difficulties and improbabilites.</P>
<P>If this great being retained his proper powers during this uni∣on, he must have been sustaining the whole universe, and superin∣tending all the laws of nature, while he was in infant at the breast of his mother, and while he hung upon the cross. And to imagine the creator of the world to have been in those
<PB N="46" REF="018741_0045_0FA81B97E0CA64D8"/>
circumstances, is an idea at which the mind revolts, almost as much as at that of the supreme God himself being reduced to them.</P>
<P>Besides, if Christ retained and exercised all his former powers in this state of apparent humiliation, he must have wrought all his miracles by a power properly <HI>his own,</HI> a power naturally <HI>belong∣ing to him,</HI> as much as the power of speaking and walking belongs to any other man. But this is expressly disclaimed by our savi∣our, when he said, that <HI>of himself he could do nothing,</HI> and that it was the <HI>Father within him who did the works.</HI> Also, on this supposition, it must have been this super-angelic being united to the body of Jesus, that raised him from the dead; whereas this is an effect which is always ascribed to God the Father only.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, Christ was divested of his original powers, or <HI>emptied himself</HI> of them upon his incarnation, the whole system of the government of the universe must have been changed during his residence upon earth. Either some other derived being (which this scheme does not provide) must have taken his place, or the supreme being himself must have condescended to do that which the scheme supposes there was an impropriety in his doing. For cer∣tainly the making and the governing of the world would not have been delegated to another, if there had not been some good reason in the nature of things, though it be unknown to us and may be indiscoverable by us, why the world should have been made and governed by a derived being, and not by the supreme being himself. And this reason, whatever it was, must, as far as we can judge, have operated during the time that Christ was upon the earth, as well as before.</P>
<P>If Christ was degraded to the state of a mere man during his humiliation on earth, reason will ask, why might not a mere man have been sufficient? Since, notwithstanding his original powers, nothing was, in fact, done by him, more than any other man, aided and assisted by God as he was, might have been equal to.</P>
<P>If we consider the object of Christ's mission, and the beings whom it respected, viz. the <HI>race of man,</HI> we cannot but think that there must have been a greater propriety, and use, in the appointment of a mere man to that office. What occasion was there for any being superior to man for the purpose of communicating the will of God to man? And as an example of a resurrection to an im∣mortal life (to enforce which was the great object of his mission the) death and resurrection of one who was properly and simply a man, was certainly far better adapted to give men satisfaction concerning their own future resurrection, than the seeming death (for it could be nothing more) of such a being as the maker of the world, and the resurrection of a body to which he had been united. For, as he was a being of so much higher rank, it might be said, that the laws of his nature might be very different from those of ours; and therefore he might have privileges to which we could not pretend, and to which we ought not to aspire.</P>
<P>If the world was created and governed by a derived being, this
<PB N="47" REF="018741_0046_0FA81B98ADAE5DD0"/>
being, on whom we immediately depended, would be that to whom all men would naturally look. He would necessarily become the object of their prayers, in consequence of which the supreme being would be overlooked, and become a mere cypher in the universe.</P>
<P>As modern philosophy supposes that there are innumerable worlds inhabited by rational and imperfect beings (for all <HI>creatures</HI> must be finite and imperfect) besides this of ours, it cannot be supposed but that many of them must have stood in as much need of the in∣terposition of the maker of the universe as we have done. And can we suppose either that this should be the only spot in the universe so highly distinguished, or that the maker of it should undergo as many degradations as this scheme may require?</P>
<P>The doctrine of Christ's pre-existence goes upon the idea of the possibility, at least, of the pre-existence of other men, and supposes an immaterial soul in man, altogether independent of the body; so that it must have been capable of thinking and acting before his birth, as well as it will be after his death. But these are suppositions which no appearance in nature favours.</P>
<P>The Arian hypothesis, therefore, though it implies no proper contradiction, is on several accounts, highly improbable <HI>a priori,</HI> and therefore ought not to be admitted without very clear and strong evidence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> Arguments against the Trinitarian and the Arian hypothesis from the scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now shew, in as concise a manner as I can, that the doctrine of the trinity, and also the Arian hypothesis, has as little countenance from the scriptures as it has from reason. The scriptures teach us that there is but one God, who is himself the maker and the governor of all things; that this one God is the sole object of worship, and that he sent Jesus Christ to instruct mankind, impowered him to work miracles, raised him from the dead, and gave him all the power that he ever was, or is now possessed of.</P>
<P N="1">1. The scriptures contain the clearest, and most express de∣clarations that there is but <HI>one God,</HI> without ever mentioning any exception in favour of <HI>a trinity,</HI> or guarding us against being led into any mistake by such general and unlimited expressions. Ex. xx. 3. "Thou shalt have no other God before me." Deut. vi. 4. "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, is one Lord." Mark xii. 20.
<Q>The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.</Q>
1 Cor. viii. 6.
<Q>To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</Q>
EPH. iv. 5, 6.
<Q>One Lord, one faith, one baptism. One God, and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</Q>
1 Tim. ii. 5.
<Q>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="018741_0047_0FA81B9B9DFC50B8"/>On the other hand, not only does the word <HI>trinity</HI> never occur in the scriptures, but it is no where said that <HI>there are three per∣sons in this one God;</HI> nor is the doctrine explicitly laid down in any other direct proposition whatever. Christ indeed says, John x, 30. "I and my Father are one;" but he sufficiently explains himself, by praying that his disciples might be one with him in the same sense in which he was one with the Father. John xvii. 21.22
<Q>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; and the glory which thou gavest to me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. This one God is said to have created all things; and no intimation is given of his having employed any <HI>inferior agent,</HI> or <HI>instrument,</HI> in the work of creation. GEN. i. 1. <HI>In the begining God created the heaven and the earth.</HI>—v. <HI>God said let there be light, and there was light,</HI> Ps. xxxiii 6. <HI>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth</HI>—v. ix. <HI>He spake, and it was done, he com∣manded, and it stood fast.</HI> Is. xliv. 24. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things, that stretched forth the heavens alone, that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This one God is called the <HI>Father,</HI> i. e. the author of all beings; and he is called God and Father with respect to Christ, as well as all other persons. JOHN vi. 27, <HI>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you; for him hath God the Father sealed.</HI> JOHN xvii. 3, <HI>That they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI> JOHN xx. 17. <HI>Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God, and your God.</HI> EPH. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 17, <HI>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.</HI> COL. i. 3, <HI>We give thanks to God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Christ is said expreslly to be inferior to the Father, all his power is said to have been given him by the Father, and he could do nothing without the Father. JOHN xiv. 28, <HI>My Father is greater than I.</HI> 1 COR. iii. 23, <HI>Ye are Christ's and Christ is God's.</HI> 1 COR. xi. 3, <HI>The head of Christ is God.</HI> JOHN v. 19, <HI>Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of himself.</HI> John xiv. 10, <HI>The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me he doth the works.</HI> Matt. xxviii. 18, <HI>All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</HI> 2 Pet. i. 17, <HI>He received from God the Father honour and glory.</HI> Rev. i. 1, <HI>The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him.</HI></P>
<P>It is now alledged, that Christ did not mean that he was inferi∣or to the Father with respect to his <HI>divine nature,</HI> but only with respect to his <HI>human nature.</HI> But if such liberties be taken in ex∣plaining a person's meaning, language has no use whatever. On
<PB N="49" REF="018741_0048_0FA81B9CABE28710"/>
the same principles, it might be asserted that Christ never died, or that he never rose from the dead, secretly meaning his divine nature only. There is no kind of imposition but what might be authorized by such an abuse of language as this.</P>
<P N="5">5. Some things were with-held from Christ by his Father, Mark xiii. 32,
<Q>But of that day, and that hour, knoweth no man; no not the angels that are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Matt. xx. 23, To sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6 As all the dominion that Christ has was derived from the Fa∣ther so it is subordinate to that of the Father, 1 Cor. xv 24, &amp;c.
<Q>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority, and power For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith that all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted who did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. Christ always prayed to the Father, and with as much humi∣lity and resignation, as any man, or the most dependent being in the universe, could possibly do. Our Lord's whole history is a proof of this; but especially the scene of his agony in the garden, Matt. xxvi. 37, &amp;c.
<Q>And he began to be sorry and very heavy; Then saith he unto them, my soul is exceeding sorrow∣ful even unto death, tarry ye here and watch with me. And he went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou will.</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. Christ is not only stiled <HI>a man</HI> even after his resurrection, but the reasoning of the apostles, in some of the passages where he is spoken of, require that he should be considered as a man with respect to <HI>his nature,</HI> and not in <HI>name</HI> only, as their reasoning has no force but upon that supposition. ACTS ii. 22,
<Q>Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of by God, by miracles and wonders, and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you</Q>
HEB. ii. 17, "Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren. HEB. ii. 10,
<Q>It became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering,</Q>
1. COR xv, 21.
<Q>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</Q></P>
<P N="9">9 Whatever exaltation Christ now enjoys, it is the gift of his Father, and the reward of his obedience unto death. PHIL. ii. 8, 9,
<Q>And being in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
<PB N="50" REF="018741_0049_0FA81B9D1BE386C0"/>
became obedient to death, even the death of the cross. Where∣fore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name,</Q>
HEB ii. 9
<Q>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.</Q>
HEB. xii 2, Looking unto
<Q>Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy which was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</Q></P>
<P>Let it also be considered, that no use whatever is made of the doctrine of the incarnation of the maker of the world, in all the New Testament. We are neither informed <HI>why</HI> so extraordinary a measure was necessary for the salvation of men, nor that it <HI>was</HI> necessary. All that can be pretended is, that it is <HI>alluded to</HI> in certain expressions. But certainly it might have been expected that a measure of this magnitude should have been expreslly declared, if not clearly explained; that mankind might have no doubt what great things had been done for them; and that they might respect their great deliverer, as his nature, and his proper rank in the creation, required.</P>
<P>The author of the epistle to the Hebrews evidently considered Christ as a being of a different rank from that of angels; and the reason why he says that he ought to be so, is, that he might have a feeling of our infirmities. But, certainly, we shall be more easily satisfied that any person really <HI>felt</HI> as a man, if he was truly a man, and nothing more than a man; than if he was a superior being, and especially a being so far superior to us as the maker of the world must have been, degraded to the condition of a man. Because, if he had any recollection of his former state, the idea of that must have borne him up under his difficulties and sufferings, in such a manner as no mere man could have been supported. And it is supposed by the Arians that Christ had a knowledge of his prior state, for they suppose him to have referred to it in his prayer to the Father, for <HI>the glory which he had with him before the world was;</HI> and yet this is hardly consistent with the account that Luke gives of his <HI>increasing in wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>No person, I think, can, with an unprejudiced mind, attend to these considerations, and the texts of scripture above recited (which are perfectly agreeable to the tenor of the whole) and imagine that it was the intention of the sacred writers to represent Christ either as the supreme God, or as the maker of the world under God. There is another hypothesis, of some modern Arians, which repre∣sents Christ as having pre-existed; but not as having been the creator or governor of the world, or the medium of all the dispen∣sations of God to mankind. But those texts of scripture which seem to be most express in favour of Christ's pre-existence; do likewise, by the same mode of interpretation, represent him as the maker of the world; so that if the favourers of this hypothesis can suppose the language of these texts to be figurative, they may more easily suppose the other to be figurative also; and that
<PB N="51" REF="018741_0050_0FA81B9DE5C4E648"/>
whatever obscurity there may be in them, they were not intended to refer to any pre-existence at all.</P>
<P>The passages of scripture which are supposed to speak of Christ, as the maker of the world, are the following, viz. JOHN i. 1, 10. EPH. iii. 9. COL. i. 15, &amp;c. HEB i. 1, &amp;c. These, I will venture to say, are the texts that most strongly favour the notion of Christ's pre-existence, and no person can doubt but that, if they must be interpreted to assert that Christ pre-existed at all, they, with the same clearness, assert that he was the maker of the world. But if these texts admit of a figurative interpretation, all the other texts, which are supposed to refer to the <HI>pre-existence only</HI> will more easily admit of a similar construction. These two opinions, therefore, viz. that Christ pre-existed, and that he was the maker of the world, ought, by all means, to stand or fall together; and if any person think the latter to be improbable, and contrary to the plain tenor of the scriptures (which uniformly represent the supreme being himself, without the aid of any inferior agent, or instrument, as the maker of the universe) he should abandon the doctrine of simple pre-existence also.</P>
<P>In what manner the proper unitarians interpret these passages of scripture, may be seen in my <HI>Familiar Illustration of particular texts of scripture,</HI> in several of the <HI>Socinian tracts,</HI> in three volumes quarto, and especially in <HI>Mr. Lindsey's Sequel to his Apology,</HI> p. 455, to which I refer my reader for a farther dicussion of this subject.</P>
<P>It is only of late years, that any persons have pretended to separate the two opinions of Christ's pre-existence, and of his being the maker of the world. All the antient Arians maintained both, as did Dr. Clarke, Mr. Whiston, Mr. Emlyn, Mr Pierce, and their followers; and I do not know that any other hypothesis, has appeared <HI>in writing,</HI> except that it is alluded to in the Theo∣logical Repository.</P>

<P N="1">1 IT is acknowledged by early writers of the orthodox per∣suasion, that two kinds of heresy existed in the times of the apostles, viz. that of those who held that Christ was simply a man, and that of the Gnostics; of whom some believed that Christ was man only in appearance, and others that it was only Jesus, and not the Christ (a pre-existent spirit who descended from heaven and dwelt in him) that suffered on the cross. Now the apostle John animadverts with the greatest severity upon the latter, but makes makes no mention of the former; and can it be thought probable
<PB N="52" REF="018741_0051_0FA81B9E94D4A440"/>
that he would pass it without censure, if he had thought it to be an error; considering how great, and how dangerous an error it has always been thought by those who have considered it as being an error at all? Maxim 12. H. p. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. The great objection that Jews have always made to christi∣anity in its present state is, that it enjoins the worship of more gods than one; and it is a great article with the christian writers of the second and following centuries to answer this objection. But it does not appear in all the book of Acts, in which we hear much of the cavils of the Jews, both in Jerusalem and in many parts of the Roman empire, that they made any such objection to christi∣anity then; nor do the apostles either there, or in their epistles, advance any thing with a view to such an objection. It may be presumed, therefore, that no such offence to the Jews had then been given, by the preaching of a doctrine so offensive to them as that of the divinity of Christ must have been. Maxim 12, 13. L. p 50</P>
<P N="3">3. As no Jew had originally any idea of their Messiah being more than a man, and as the apostles and the first christians had certainly the same idea at first concerning Jesus, it may be supposed that, if ever they had been informed that Jesus was not a man, but either God himself, or the maker of the world under God, we should have been able to trace the time and the circumstances in which so a great a discovery was made to them; and also that we should have perceived the effect which it had upon their minds; at least by some change in their manner of speaking concern∣ing him. But nothing of this kind is to be found in the gospels, in the book of Acts, or in any of the Epistles. We perceive marks enow of other new views of things, especially of the call of the Gentiles to partake of the privileges of the gospel; and we hear much of the disputes and the eager contention which it occasioned. But how much more must all their prejudices have been shocked by the information that a person whom they first took to be <HI>a mere man,</HI> was not a man, but either God himself, or the maker of the world under God? Maxim 13. L. p. 55</P>
<P N="4">4. All the Jewish christians, after the destruction of Jerusalem, which was immediately after the age of the apostles are, said to have been <HI>Ebionites;</HI> and these were only of two sorts, some of them holding the miraculous conception of our saviour, and others believing that he was the son of Joseph, as well as of Mary. None of them are said to have believed either that he was God, or the maker of the world under God. And is it at all credible that the body of the Jewish christians, if they had ever been instructed by the apostles in the doctrine of the divinity, or pre-existence of Christ, would so soon, and so generally, if not universally, have abandoned that faith? Maxim 6. H. p. 7. R. p. 3. L. p. 14.</P>
<P N="5">5 Had Christ been considered as God, or the maker of the world under God, in the early ages of the church, he would
<PB N="53" REF="018741_0052_0FA81B9F661A45C0"/>
naturally have been the proper object of prayer to christians; nay, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so than God the Father, with whom, on the scheme of the doctrine of the trinity, they must have known that they had less immediate intercourse. But prayers to Jesus Christ were not used in early times, but gained ground gradually, with the opinion of Christ being God, and the object of worship. Maxim 14. L. p 81.</P>
<P N="6">6 Athanasius represents the apostles as obliged to use great caution not to offend their first converts with the doctrine of Christ's divinity, and as forbearing to urge that topic till they were first well established in the belief of his being the Messiah. He adds, that the Jews being in an error on this sub∣ject, drew the Gentiles into it. Chrysostom agrees with Athana∣sius in this representation of the silence of the apostles in their first preaching, both with respect to the divinity of Christ, and his miraculous conception. They both represent them as leaving their disciples to learn the doctrine of Christ's divinity, by way of <HI>inference</HI> from certain expressions; and they do not pretend to produce any instance in which they taught that doctrine clearly and explicitly. Maxim 13. H. p. 12 L. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 53.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hegesippus, the first christian historian, himself a Jew, and therefore probably an Ebionite, enumerating the heresies of his time, mentions several of the Gnostic kind, but not that of Christ being a mere man. He moreover says, that in travelling to Rome, where he arrived in the time of A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cetus, he found all the Churches that he visited held the faith which had been taught by Christ and the apostles, which, in his opinion, was probably that of Christ being not God, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only. Justin Martyr also, and Clemens Alexandrinus, who wrote after He∣gesippus, treat largely of heresies in general, without mentioning, or alluding to the unitarians. Maxim 8 H p 8. R p 8.</P>
<P N="8">8. All those who were deemed <HI>heretics</HI> in early times; were cut off from the communion of those who called themselves the <HI>orthodox</HI> christians, and went by some particular name; generally that of their leader. But the unitarians among the Gentiles were not expelled from the assemblies of christians, but worship∣ped along with those who were called orthodox, and had no par∣ticular name till the time of Victor, who excommunicated Theo∣dorus; and a long time after that Epiphanius endeavoured to give them the name of Alogi. And though the Ebionites, pro∣bably about or before this time, had been excommunicated by the Gentile Christians, it was, as Jerom says <HI>only</HI> on account of their rigid adherence to the law of Moses. Maxim 5. H. p. 14. L. p. 25.</P>
<P N="9">9. The <HI>Apostles creed</HI> is that which was taught to all catechu∣mens before baptism, and additions were made to it from time to time in order to exclude those who were denominated <HI>heretics.</HI> Now, though there are several articles in that creed which allude to the Gnostics and tacitly condemn them, there was not, in the time of Tertullian, any article in it that alluded to the unitari¦ans
<PB N="54" REF="018741_0053_0FA81BA015775898"/>
so that even then any unitarian, at least one believing the miraculous conception, might have subscribed it. It may, therefore, be concluded, that simple unitarianism was not deemed he∣retical at the end of the second century. Maxim 7. L. p. 27.</P>
<P N="10">10 It is acknowledged by Eusebius and others, that the an∣tient unitarians themselves, constantly asserted that their doctrine was the prevailing opinion of the christian church till the time of Victor. Maxim 2 H. p. 18. R. p. 25.</P>
<P N="11">11. Justin Martyr, who maintains the pre-existence of Christ, is so far from calling the contrary opinion a <HI>heresy,</HI> that what he says on the subject is evidently an apology for his own: and when he speaks of <HI>heretics in general,</HI> which he does with great indignation, as no christians, and having no communication with christians, he mentions the Gnostics only. Maxim 12. H. p. 17. R. p. 15. L. p. 127.</P>
<P N="12">12 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who was after Justin and who wrote a large treatise on the subject of heresy, says very little concerning the Ebionites. Those Ebionites he speaks of as believing that Christ was the son of Joseph, and he makes no mention of those who believed the miraculous conception. Maxim. 12. H p. 15. L. p 32, 118.</P>
<P N="13">13. Tertullian represents the majority of the common or unlearn∣ed christians, the <HI>Idiot<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> as unitarians; and it is among the com∣mon people that we always find the oldest opinions in any country, and in any sect, while the learned are most apt to innovate. It may therefore be presumed that, as the unitarian doctrine was held by the common people in the time of Tertullian, it had been more general still before that time, and probably universal in the apostolical age. Athanasius also mentions it as a subject of complaint to the orthodox of his age that <HI>the many,</HI> and es∣pecially, persons of <HI>low understandings,</HI> were inclined to the uni∣tarian doctrine. Maxim 4, 10. R p 26 L. p. 49.</P>
<P N="14">14. The first who held and discussed the doctrine of the pre-ex∣istence and divinity of Christ, acknowledged that their opinions were exceedingly unpopular among the unlearned christians; that these dreaded the doctrine of the trinity, thinking that it infring∣ed upon the doctrine of the supremacy of God the Father; and the learned christians make frequent apologies to them, and to others, for their own opinion. Maxim 10. H. p. 54.</P>
<P N="15">15. The divinity of Christ was first advanced and urged by those who had been heathen philosophers, and especially those who were admirers of the doctrine of Plato, who held the opinion of a second God. Austin says, that he considered Christ as no other than a most excellent man, and that he had no suspicion of the word of God being incarnate in him, or how
<Q>the catholic faith differed from the error of Photinus.</Q>
(the last of the proper unitarians whose name is come down to us) till he read the books of Plato; and that he was afterwards confirmed in the Catholic doctrine by reading the scriptures. Constantine in his oration to the fathers of the council of Nice, speaks with com∣mendation
<PB N="55" REF="018741_0054_0FA81BA14A52D668"/>
of Plato, as having taught the doctrine of
<Q>a second God, derived from the supreme God, and subservient to his will.</Q>
Maxim 11. H. p. 20,</P>
<P N="16">16. There is a pretty easy gradation in the progress of the doc∣trine of the divinity of Christ; as he was first thought to be a God in some qualified sense of the word, a distinguished emanation from the supreme mind; and then the Logos or the wisdom of God personified; and this <HI>logos</HI> was first thought to be only occasi∣onally detached from the Deity, and then drawn into his essence again, before it was imagined to have a <HI>permanent personality,</HI> distinct from that of the source from which it sprung. And it was not till 400 years after that time that Christ, was thought to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Father. Whereas, on the other hand, though it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that the apostles taught the doctrine of the divinity of Christ, yet it cannot be denied that in the very times of the apostles, the Jewish church, and many of the Gen∣tiles also, held the opinion of his being a mere man. Here the transition is quite sudden, without any gradation at all. This must naturally have given the greatest alarm, such as is now given to those who are called orthodox, by the present Socinians; and yet nothing of this kind can be perceived Besides, it is certainly most probable that the christians of those times, urged as they were with the meanness of their master, should incline to <HI>add to</HI> rather than <HI>take from,</HI> his natural rank and dignity. Maxim 9. H. p. 20, &amp;c. L p 73.134.</P>

<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> Maxims of Historical Criticism, by which the preceding articles may be tried.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHEN two persons give different accounts of things, that evidence is to be preferred, which is either in itself more probable, or more agreeable to other credible testimony.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither is entire credit to be given to any set of men with respect to what is reputable to them, nor to their enemies with respect to what is disreputable; but the account given by the one may be balanced by that of the other. Summary View, No. 10.</P>
<P N="3">3. Accounts of any set of men given by their enemies only are always suspicious. But the confessions of enemies, and circum∣stances favourable to any body of men, collected from the wri∣tings of their adversaries, are deserving of particular regard.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is more natural for men who wish to speak disparagingly of any sect to undervalue their numbers, as well as every thing else relating to them; and it is equally natural for those who wish to speak respectfully of any party, to represent the members of it as more numerous than they are. Summary View, No. 13.</P>
<P N="5">5. When persons form themselves into societies, so as to be di∣stinguishable from others, they never fail to get some <HI>particular name,</HI> either assumed by themselves, or imposed by others. This is necessary in order to make them the subject of conversation, long paraphrases in discourse being very inconvenient. Summary View, No. 8.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="56" REF="018741_0055_0FA81BA1D40DF4F8"/>6. When particular opinions are ascribed to a particular class of men, without any distinction of the time when those opinions were adopted by them, it may be presumed, that they were sup∣posed to hold those opinions from the time that they received their denomination. Summary View, No. 4</P>
<P N="7">7. When a particular description is given of a class of persons within any period of time, any person who can be proved to have had the proper character of one of that class, may be deemed to have belonged to it, and to have enjoyed all the privileges of it, whatever they were. Summary View, No. 9.</P>
<P N="8">8. When an historian, or writer of any kind, professedly enu∣merates the several <HI>species</HI> belonging to any <HI>genus,</HI> or general body of men, and omits any particular species or denomination, which, if it had belonged to the genus, he, from his situation and circumstances, was not likely to have overlooked, it may be presumed that he did not consider that particular species as be∣longing to the genus. Summary View, No. 7.</P>
<P N="9">9. Great changes in opinion are not usually made of a sudden, and never by great bodies of men. That history, therefore, which represents such changes as having been made gradually, and by easy steps, is always the more probable on that account. Summary View, No. 16.</P>
<P N="10">10. The common or unlearned people, in any country, who do not speculate much, retain longest any opinions with which their minds have been much impressed; and therefore we always look for the oldest opinions in any country, or any class of men, among the common people, and not among the learned. Sum∣mary View, No. 13, 14.</P>
<P N="11">11. If any new opinions be introduced into a society, they are most likely to have introduced them, who held opinions similar to them before they joined that society. Summary View, No. 15.</P>
<P N="12">12. If any particular opinion, has never failed to excite great indignation in all ages and nations, in which a contrary opini∣nion has been generally received and that particular opinion can be proved to have existed in any age or country when it did not excite indignation, it may be concluded that it had many partizans in that age or country. For the opinion being the same, it could not of itself be more respectable: and human nature being the same, it could not but have been regarded in the same light, so long as the same stress was laid on the oposite opinion. Summary View No. 1.11.12.</P>
<P N="13">13 When a time is given, in which any very remarkable and interesting opinion was not believed by a certain class of people, and another time in which the belief of it was general, the introduction of such an opinion may always be known by the effects which it will produce upon the minds, and in the conduct of men; by the alarm which it will give to some, and the defence of it by others. If, therefore, no aim was given, and no defence of it was made within any particular period, it may be concluded that the
<PB N="57" REF="018741_0056_0FA81BA263004038"/>
introduction of it did not take place within that period. Sum∣mary View, No. 2, 3, 6</P>
<P N="14">14. When any particular opinion or practice, is necessarily of customarily accompanied by any other opinion or practice; if the latter be not found within any particular period, it may be presumed that the former did not exist within that period. Summary View, No. 5.</P>
<P>It will be perceived that the whole of this historical evidence is in favour, of the proper unitarian doctrine, or that of Christ being a mere man, having been the faith of the primitive church, in opposition to the Arian no less than the Trinitarian hypothesis.</P>
<P>As to the Arian hypothesis in particular, I do not know that it can be traced any higher than Arius himself, or at least the age in which he lived. Both the Gnostics and the Platonizing chris∣tians, were equally far from supposing that Christ was a being <HI>created out of nothing;</HI> the former having thought him to be an emanation from the supreme being, and the latter the logos of the Father personified. And though they sometimes applied the term <HI>creation</HI> to this <HI>personification,</HI> still they did not suppose it to have been a creation out of nothing. It was only a new modification of what existed before. For God, they said, was always, <HI>logik<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> or had within him that principle which afterwards assumed a personal character.</P>
<P><HI>Upon the whole, the Arian hypothesis appears to me to be destitute of all support from christian antiquity. Whereas it was never denied that the proper unitarian doctrine existed in the time of the apostles; and I think it evident, that it was the faith of the bulk of christians, and especially the unlearned christians, for two or three centuries after Christ.</HI></P>
