<P>It is said unto <HI>THIS DAY,</HI> In the Mount of the LORD, it shall be seen.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AND upon THIS DAY, What Remarkable, What Admirable Occasions, has our Glorious GOD given us to Repeat this <HI>Proverb of Israel!</HI></P>
<P>AS there never was any Man on the Face of the Earth, whose <HI>Name</HI> has been so uni∣versally known among the Children of Men, as the Patriarch <HI>Abrabam,</HI> to whom a <HI>Great Name</HI> had been Promised by our GOD, so
<PB N="2" REF="002043_0004_0FBA8E4C23773170"/>there is nothing more known about this Renowned Patriarch, than this, <HI>By Faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and be that had received the Promises, offered up his only begotten Son; Accounting that GOD was able to Raise him up even from the Dead.</HI> This Memorable <HI>Friend of GOD,</HI> after ma∣ny previous Trials, at last had his <HI>Faith tri∣ed</HI> unto the uttermost, with an Order from the Sovereign Lord of Life, making His usu∣al Descent in the <HI>Shechinah</HI> unto him; an order whereof every Word was a Thunder∣bolt; It was, <HI>Take now thy Son, thine only Son, Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into a Land, forty miles off, and offer him for a Burnt offering upon a Mountain there.</HI> The <HI>Obedience</HI> which our Father paid unto this astonishing Order, has been celebrated in all Succeeding Ages, and with very many Nati∣ons. The Ancients, who have employ'd their Pens in the celebration, have also told us, that the Story was rarely beheld in a <HI>Picture,</HI> without <HI>Weeping Eyes</HI> among them. The Pagans had their famous Traditions of the Matter; Especially That of <HI>Saturn</HI> Sa∣crificing of his <HI>Jeoud.</HI> The Jews tell us, That the Two Sons of <HI>Sennacherth</HI> had like to have been a <HI>Sacrifue</HI> to the Tradition of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s. I am not sure, That <HI>Satan</HI> took Advantage from hence, to draw the poor Pagans into <HI>Humane Sacrifices,</HI> particularly
<PB N="3" REF="002043_0005_0FBA8E4E2A231430"/>of their Children unto <HI>Moloch.</HI> But I find <HI>philo,</HI> notably censuring and confuting the Envious Detractions of those who would go to compare them with the Piety of our In∣comparable <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Action</HI> you know. The Action of Binding <HI>Isaac</HI> on the <HI>Altar,</HI> on the Account whereof the whole Business is by the Jews called, <HI>Gnakidah Jitzchah,</HI> Or, <HI>The Binding of Isaac.</HI> The brave Young Man, tho' above Twenty Years of Age, readily Submitted un∣to this Action of his Father. Doubtless the same <HI>Eaith</HI> which was in his Excellent Fa∣ther, filled and acted the Soul of this won∣derful Youth! But what was the <HI>Issue</HI> of the Action?</P>
<P>Our Glorious GOD would see the Triumph of the <HI>Faith,</HI> with which He had Enriched the Soul of the Patriarch; and at the same time give in his <HI>Isaac</HI> a Lively, and Lovely Type of what was afterwards to be done unto our SAVIOUR. <HI>Abraham</HI> does as firm∣ly Believe, that GOD would Raise his <HI>Isaac</HI> from the Dead, yea, out of his Ashes, as if he had seen it with his Eyes. <HI>Isaac</HI> is laid on the <HI>Altar.</HI> Every thing is ready for the <HI>Mortal Stroke.</HI> The Father gives his <HI>Last Kiss</HI> to the Resigning Victim. The <HI>Knife</HI> is in his hand. His <HI>hand</HI> is lifted up. One Second of a Minute more, and the <HI>deadly Stab</HI> reaches the Heart that lay expos'd un∣to
<PB N="4" REF="002043_0006_0FBA8E4FB3F8A830"/>to it; <HI>Isaac</HI> is a <HI>Dead Man</HI> without any more ado. But behold, GOD by an <HI>Angel</HI> from Heaven, <HI>Steps in at the very Moment:</HI> The Voice of GOD by an Angel, calls to him, <HI>Stop, Stay, Lay not thy hand upon the Sacrifice!</HI>— O most <HI>Seasonable Interposition!</HI> What a <HI>De∣liverance,</HI> in what an <HI>Extremity! Abraham</HI> could not but settle a <HI>Memorial</HI> of this Mi∣raculous Deliverance, in the Name of, JE∣HOVAH-JIREH, on the Place where he received it. <HI>GOD will provide;</HI> This was the English of it. You know, That the <HI>Mountain</HI> was also called, <HI>Moriah,</HI> which is of the like Importance. And you know, what was afterwards done upon that Exalted <HI>Mountain of the House of the Lord.</HI> And now, Don't wonder, that we now hear of a <HI>Proverb,</HI> which from this amazing Occur∣rence obtained among the People of GOD, in the Succeeding Ages. A <HI>Proverb,</HI> which has been called, <HI>Proverbium Tribulatorum:</HI> A Sentence fitted for the People of GOD, in every <HI>Extremity</HI> of Adversity: A saying with which the People of GOD should ani∣mate their Expectation of Help to come from Heaven, when any Adversity comes to an <HI>Extremity</HI> upon them. The Proverb is, <HI>In the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen.</HI> O Peo∣ple of GOD, When a Perplexity comes upon you to an <HI>Extremity</HI> like what <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac</HI> saw in the <HI>Mount</HI> Which the Lord led
<PB N="5" REF="002043_0007_0FBA8E5180690AA0"/>them to, then <HI>it shall be seen,</HI> what GOD will do for you; <HI>it shall be seen,</HI> how GOD will appear for your <HI>Deliverance.</HI> Sooner shall the <HI>Mountain</HI> of <HI>Moriah</HI> depart, and the <HI>Hill</HI> of GOD be removed, than this <HI>Proverb</HI> grow into a Desuetude.</P>
<P>Behold, The Entertainment that is now provided for you. A Relation of <HI>Seasonable Interpositions from Heave, for the Relies of the Distressed,</HI> is what is now to Entertain you.</P>
<P><HI>A Seasonable Interposition of the Divine Pro∣vidence to prevent the Destruction of such as are upon the very Point of being De∣stroyed; This is a Dispensation, much to be wondred at, and still to be looked for.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis no Rare Thing for the Glorious GOD, <HI>Seasonably to Step in,</HI> and prevent the <HI>Sacri∣fice,</HI> which we are <HI>upon the Point</HI> of being brought unto. 'Tis no Rare Thing, for the Glorious GOD <HI>Seasonably to Step in,</HI> and put by a Deadly Blow, which is <HI>upon the very Point</HI> of being Struck at our dearest Interests.</P>
<P>The <HI>Succour</HI> which our GOD has for us in our <HI>Distresses,</HI> is often <HI>deferr'd</HI> until we even Despair of a <HI>Deliverance.</HI> But when Things are come to an <HI>Extremity, Then</HI> 'tis then He <HI>Steps in</HI> to Succour us.</P>
<P>We read of our GOD and SAVIOUR, Heb. IV. 16. That from Him, we <HI>obtain Mercy and
<PB N="6" REF="002043_0008_0FBA8E52F79FAB78"/>find Fevour, to Help in a Time of Need.</HI> But the <HI>Time of Need,</HI> wherein the <HI>Only Wise GOD</HI> chuses to <HI>help</HI> us, is, when our <HI>Necessi∣ty</HI> comes to an <HI>Extremity.</HI> And then He takes as we say, the very <HI>Nick of Time,</HI> to send in His <HI>Help</HI> unto us.</P>
<P>We may give this LOCTRINE of <HI>Seaso∣nable Interpositions,</HI> in the Terms of an Old saying very common among the People of GOD, <HI>Mans Extremity is GODs Opportunity.</HI> Is there not such a Promise as That, Zech. XIV. 7. <HI>At Evening it shall be light.</HI> At <HI>E∣vening!</HI> Who would have Expected a break∣ing forth of <HI>Light</HI> in the <HI>Evening?</HI> A <HI>Morn∣ing</HI> of Salvations in an <HI>Evening</HI> of Distresses! But GOD will <HI>Perform</HI> what He does <HI>Pro∣mise.</HI> And the <HI>Upright</HI> shall in their <HI>Dark∣ness</HI> have <HI>Light arising</HI> to them.</P>
<P>We will Declare, first, THAT it <HI>has been</HI> so.</P>
<P>Let us for a few Minutes walk about the Field of <HI>History,</HI> and gather here and there a <HI>Rose of Sharon;</HI> Make a brief Collection of Instances, wherein GOD has with <HI>Seaso∣nable Interpositions,</HI> come in for the Relief of the Faithful, when <HI>Extreme Dangers</HI> of Ruine have sorely terrified them.</P>
<P>And here, Oh! Let it not be forgotten,— indeed, I cannot go on with my <HI>Collection,</HI> till I first make this <HI>Introduction</HI> to it!— It must be Remembred, That <HI>Mankind</HI> upon
<PB N="7" REF="002043_0009_0FBA8E55804152A8"/>our First Fall, was just <HI>upon the very Point,</HI> of being made a <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> unto the Infinite <HI>Justice</HI> of GOD: The out-stretched Arm of Infinite <HI>Justice</HI> was ready to give the Stroke. The <HI>Powers of Heaven shook;</HI> None of them could see how it could be diverted. But GOD then did <HI>Provide a Sacrifice.</HI> The <HI>Son</HI> of GOD with a most <HI>Seasonable Interposition</HI> did then Step in; and say, <HI>I will be the Sa∣crifice.</HI> Christians, Behold your SAVIOUR <HI>Sacrificed</HI> on Mount <HI>Calvary;</HI> [Yea, some look on Mount <HI>Calvary</HI> as an Appendage to Mount <HI>Moriah!</HI>] and then cry out, <HI>The Lord seen in the Mount! The Lord seen in the Mount!</HI> The World has never seen any thing equal to this Dispensation. The Son of GOD, <HI>Saw, and there was no Man, and wondred that there was no Intercessor. There∣fore His Arm did bring Salvation;</HI> HE Step'd in, and Saved at this <HI>Exremity!</HI> It has been indeed for the sake of this <HI>Appearance</HI> of <HI>the Great GOD our SAVIOUR,</HI> that we have been made able to go on unto the Instances which we now proceed unto.</P>
<P>First. The People of GOD in <HI>Associated Bodies;</HI> These have all along seen the <HI>Sea∣sonable Interpositions</HI> of His Providence, when Distresses have grown <HI>Extream</HI> upon them. Let us <HI>Consider the Days of old, and the Years of Ancient Generations:</HI> The condition of, The <HI>Bush</HI> all on a Light Fire, but yet <HI>net con∣sumed.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002043_0010_0FBA8E580FD53130"/>When was it, that our Compassion∣nate GOD <HI>Look'd on the Affliction</HI> of His Peo∣ple in <HI>Egypt?</HI> Things were come to an <HI>Ex∣tremity;</HI> and it is said unto this day, <HI>Cum duplic<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntur Lateres, venit Moses.</HI> The <HI>Tasks</HI> are Doubled, the <HI>Pains</HI> are Doubled: <HI>Then</HI> comes the Deliverer! Anon, the People are brought unto a <HI>Pi-habireth;</HI> A <HI>Mouth of Perils;</HI> Where they cannot escape, Except they <HI>Eat up</HI> a vast Army behind them, or <HI>Drink up</HI> the Reedy Sea before them: <HI>Well, Fear not; Stand still; See the Saivation of the Lord!</HI> How <HI>Seasonably</HI> and Remarkably the Blessed GOD appeared on that Memo∣rable Day! and <HI>Opened a Way in the Sea,</HI> and <HI>Made a Peth in the Mighty Waters!</HI>— In the Difficulties of the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> When the People were come to the <HI>Last Pinch;</HI> were on <HI>the very Point of Starving:</HI> how strangely does the <HI>Mighty GOD of Jacob,</HI> cause the <HI>Angels</HI> to drop down Bread from Heaven upon them, and the very Rock to yield Rivers of Waters unto them? And be of a Good Heart, O NEW-ENGLISH <HI>Israel;</HI> Neither will thy GOD suffer thee to be <HI>Star∣ved</HI> in thy <HI>Wilderness!</HI> In the Book of <HI>Judges,</HI> how often does our GOD Raise up a <HI>Deliverer</HI> for His People, when <HI>Israel is sore∣ly Distressed,</HI> and has no Prospect of any De∣liverance? What was the <HI>Distress</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> and his People, when a Million of Rapacious
<PB N="9" REF="002043_0011_0FBA8E595D45FCF0"/><HI>Arabians</HI> Invade him? What was the <HI>Distress</HI> of <HI>Jehoshaphat,</HI> and his People, when united <HI>Moabites</HI> and <HI>Ammonites,</HI> and <HI>Edomites,</HI> In∣vade him? There was another time, When the <HI>Lord saw the Affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was not any shut up, nor any Left, nor any Help for Israel;</HI> But, Then! GOD found, I will rather say, GOD <HI>made</HI> an <HI>Hand, by which He saved them.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Distress</HI> of the People, in the Days of <HI>Heze∣kiah,</HI> when the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Invasion was carry∣ing all before it! The Capital City invest∣ed, and all <HI>on the very Point</HI> of Perishing by a <HI>Blast of the Terrible Ones!</HI> But Now, GOD sends down His Angel from Heaven; <HI>Judg∣ment was heard from Heaven;</HI> GOD shewed Himself <HI>Glorious and Excellent on the Moun∣tains of Prey:</HI> A Thunder-storm is raised, in which the <HI>Stout-hearted are spoiled.</HI> Oh! The Joy of the Deliverance! When was a De∣liverance wrought for the Church under the <HI>Babylonian Captivity?</HI> It was, when the People found themselves in the very <HI>Grave.</HI> Their <HI>Har<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> were hung on the <HI>Willows;</HI> They were in as disperate Circumstances as the <HI>Dry Bones</HI> of the <HI>Dead;</HI> their Cry was, Ezek. XXXVII. 11. <HI>Our Hope is gone.</HI> After This, what a Design was there formed, for the Utter Extinction of all the People which our GOD then had in the World; When <HI>Haman</HI> had obtained a Bloody Decree to cut
<PB N="10" REF="002043_0012_0FBA8E5B0712D250"/>oft every Mothers Child of 'em; all in one day; and the <HI>Lucky Day</HI> fixed for the Execu∣tion! Was <HI>Isanc</HI> ever in such a <HI>Mount</HI> be∣fore? But,—<HI>Between the Cup and the Lap!</HI> O the Wonder-working Providence of our Glotious GOD! And what became of <HI>Ha∣man,</HI> and his <HI>Ten Sons? Antichrist</HI> and his <HI>Ten Sons,</HI> have cause to think of <HI>That!</HI> Un∣to what a <HI>Low Ebb</HI> was Christianity reduced, when such incredible Numbers of Christians had been Martyred by <HI>Dioclesian</HI> and ima∣gining that he had burnt all the <HI>bibles</HI> as well as kill d all the <HI>Christians</HI> in the World, he set up his Triumphal Pillars, with that Inscription upon them, <HI>Christiana Superstiti∣one deleta,</HI>—There's an End of Christianity, thought he. No, Sir, You're mistaken! The Next News is, A Christian Emperour on the Throne; and a greater Number of Christians appearing, than had ever been in the World before! In what a forlorn Con∣dition was the Church, on <HI>the very Point</HI> of giving up the Ghost, when the hidden Re∣mains of the <HI>Taborites,</HI> dispatched <HI>Four Men</HI> to travel into all Parts, upon Discovery, and they returned with sorrowful Tidings, that the Church was Lost in hideous <HI>Idolatries;</HI> only they were told, that there was a few Remains of the <HI>Piemontese,</HI> which were Scattered &amp; Conceled; no body knew where they were. But this <HI>Darkest Time</HI> of the
<PB N="11" REF="002043_0013_0FBA8E5C5E8FCAA0"/>Night, was <HI>just before Break of Day!</HI> Pre∣sently, a certain Monk, who had until then made none of the greatest Figure, fell out with a Knave about the price of his <HI>Indul gences;</HI> and this brought on the <HI>Reformation,</HI> wherein Half <HI>Europe</HI> embraced the <HI>Religion,</HI> which had been just <HI>on the very Point</HI> of be∣ing banished out of the World.</P>
<P>Secondly; The People of GOD in <HI>Particu∣lar Persons;</HI> These also have all along seen the <HI>Seasonable Interpositions</HI> of His Provi∣dence, when Distresses have grown <HI>Extreme</HI> upon them. <HI>Call now, if there be any that will not answer thee,</HI> and will not say, <HI>I was brought Low, and then my GOD helped me! Unto which of the Saints wilt thou turn,</HI> and not find them still saying, <HI>When I was brought very Low, then the Tender Mercies of my GOD speedily prevented me!</HI> All the Cases of the <HI>Hundred and Seventh PSALM,</HI> are still renewed with Believers; in every Ge∣neration. Who is there to be found among the People of GOD, but what may have the Report of the <HI>Hundred and Seventh PSALM</HI> given of them; <HI>Their Soul sainted in them; They fell down and there was none to help; They drew near to the Gates of Death; Their Soul was melted be ause of Trouble, and they were at their Wits End.</HI> But THEN! They <HI>Cry unto the Lord in their Trouble; and He brings them out of their Distresses.</HI> How fre∣quent
<PB N="12" REF="002043_0014_0FBA8E5F7251E1B8"/>a Spectacle This! A <HI>Tragedy</HI> carried on to an <HI>Extremity;</HI> And then, GOD on a sudden, makes a Descent from the <HI>Machin</HI> of Heaven, and all goes off more comforta∣bly than any one could have dreamed of! Our Father <HI>Noah,</HI> in the Darkness, &amp; the vast Labour and Fatigue of the <HI>Ark;</HI> Doubtless he was even spent, with waiting for on <HI>Out∣gate.</HI> Anon, GOD <HI>Remembers</HI> him, and fet∣ches him out of his Melancholy Coffin. Was not <HI>Sarah,</HI> thrown into the Jaws of a <HI>Wild-beast,</HI> who was just ready to bring an Endless confusion upon her? GOD <HI>then</HI> steps in and says to the Raptor, <HI>Thou art a Dead Man, if thy prey be not presently deli∣vered up! Jacob,</HI> can see nothing else, but his Brother <HI>Esau</HI> just upon <HI>the very Point</HI> of doing upon him, all that the <HI>Hound</HI> can do; to the <HI>Deer</HI> that he comes up withal. But THEN,—Lo, GOD steps in, to change the Heart of the Beast, and bring him to <HI>Fawn∣ing</HI> on him, instead of <HI>Biting</HI> of him. No doubt <HI>Joseph</HI> reckoned himself shut up in a <HI>Perpetual Prison,</HI> when an Ungrateful and Forgetful <HI>Butler,</HI> left him there, and his <HI>Feet were hurt with Festers.</HI> But NOW is the Time, that <HI>the Word of the Lord Purges him;</HI> The Revelation which GOD made unto him, <HI>Vindicates</HI> him, <HI>Advances</HI> him, and he be∣comes the Ruler of a Mighty Nation. The Rescues of <HI>David,</HI> how often were these,
<PB N="13" REF="002043_0015_0FBA8E61A45306C8"/>When the poor <HI>Partridge</HI> on the <HI>Mountains,</HI> was just <HI>upon the very Point</HI> of being Siezed by the Talons of the <HI>Vulture!</HI> But GOD was ever <HI>seen</HI> in those <HI>Mountains!</HI> At last, he crys out, <HI>I shall one day perish. Ziklag</HI> is burn't, and all he had is carried away, and his very Friends talk of Stoning him. Here is what we may with Good Sense call, <HI>The Last Extremity!</HI> Well, O <HI>David,</HI> Now <HI>Encourage thy self in the Lord thy GOD:</HI> Thou shalt be upon the Throne immediately! When has the <HI>Poor Widow,</HI> her Supplies brought in unto her? Truly, When She is come to the <HI>Last Handful of Meal</HI> in the Barrel, the <HI>Last Spoonful of Oyl</HI> in the Cruse. The <HI>Three Worthies</HI> are thrown into the tremendous <HI>Furnace.</HI> How <HI>Seasonably</HI> does the SON of GOD step down to cover them? <HI>Daniel</HI> is thrown down to the hungry <HI>Lions.</HI> How Seasonably does the Messenger of GOD step down to Muzzle them? Is it possible for <HI>peter</HI> to be delivered! Why He is to Dy the <HI>Next Day;</HI> Heavy Fetters are upon him; cruel Keepers are about him; A strong Pri∣son holds him in the <HI>straitest Custody.</HI> But GOD sends down from Heaven; and <HI>Peter</HI> is on the <HI>Next Day</HI> Preaching to the People of GOD. Who would have imagined it? How often is <HI>Paul</HI> just <HI>upon the very Point</HI> of being offered up? Once he says, Act. XXVII. 20. <HI>All hope that we should be saved, was then
<PB N="14" REF="002043_0016_0FBA8E63A7C46F68"/>taken away.</HI> But still, <HI>Paul</HI> when thus <HI>Dy∣ing Daily,</HI> yet, Behold, <HI>He Lives!</HI> Doubt∣less, Many of those who felt the <HI>Healing Miracles</HI> of our SAVIOUR, were <HI>Healed,</HI> with very <HI>Unexpected Cures.</HI> A Learned Physician, has written an Essay of much Eru∣dition, to prove, <HI>That they were all Incurable by any other Hand, but our SAVIOURS,</HI> Ask among the People of GOD: How many will you find, who have had the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD coming unto them, when like <HI>Epaphro∣ditus,</HI> they have been just <HI>Nigh unto Death?</HI> How many have been brought into the com∣fort of a <HI>Calm,</HI> when the <HI>Tempest</HI> caused 'em to cry, with the Disciples in theirs, <HI>Lord, Save us; or we perish in a Moment!</HI> How many brought out of <HI>Perplexity,</HI> when the <HI>Extremity</HI> has been such as to throw them into an uncommon <HI>Agony?</HI> Of our GOD and SAVIOUR we may say, <HI>These are part of His ways; But how little a portion is heard of them!</HI></P>
<P>We will Enquire, Secondly; WHY it <HI>must be so?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis with <HI>Scosonable Interpositions,</HI> that out GOD will <HI>Step in</HI> to Relieve the Faithful, when things are gone so far that they can see none but <HI>Extreme Dangers</HI> of Ruine be∣fore them.</P>
<P><HI>It must be so;</HI> Because a Glorious GOD will give a Manifestation of His <HI>Perfections,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="002043_0017_0FBA8E649E0D7B40"/>and will be greatly Glorified in such Dis∣pensations. An <HI>Extremity</HI> of Distress, brings Men to that strain; 2 Chron. XX. 12. <HI>O our GOD, we know not what to, but our Eyes are upon Thee.</HI> Our GOD will have All <HI>other Help</HI> to fail us; <HI>Then</HI> will He step in for our <HI>Help:</HI> 'Tis to manifest the <HI>Greatness of His Excellencies.</HI> NOW, <HI>Help me, O Lord my GOD, That it may be known that this is thy Hand, and that thou, Lord, art the Doer of it!</HI> It compels us to say, <HI>The Finger of GOD is here.</HI> We are compell'd now to say, <HI>If it had not been the Lord that was on our side, our Souls must have gone to dwell in the Place of Silence!</HI> Why will GOD our SAVIOUR do such Things? 'Tis, That <HI>Men may see, and know, and consider, and understand, that the Hand of the Lord has done these things.</HI> We are told, <HI>In the Mount it shall be seen.</HI> What shall be <HI>seen?</HI> It <HI>shall be seen,</HI> that our GOD is a Powerful, Merciful, Faithful GOD. Yea, It <HI>shall be seen,</HI> That our GOD has <HI>An∣gels</HI> at His Command. For 'tis usually in their Instrumentality that He <HI>Commands</HI> these <HI>Deliverances.</HI> NOW the Saved of the Lord, will cry out, <HI>O Lord, I know, that thou canst do every thing!</HI> Now they cannot but cry out, <HI>O give Thanks unto the Lord, who Re∣members us in our Low Estate, because His Mercy endureth for ever!</HI> They will go to <HI>Mahanaim,</HI> and add, <HI>There is no Number of His Armies.</HI></P>

But then, <HI>It must be so,</HI> Because the <HI>Pray∣ers,</HI> and the Frames, and the Steps, of the <HI>Distressed</HI> Ones in their <HI>Extremities,</HI> are of∣ten such as prepare them to <HI>See the Salvation of GOD.</HI> Our GOD brings us into <HI>Extreme Dangers;</HI> 'Tis to bring us down upon our Knees. In such <HI>Exegencies</HI> our <HI>Prayers</HI> will be <HI>Cries:</HI> The Voice of the <HI>Prayers</HI> will pierce the <HI>Clouds,</HI> will reach the <HI>Heavens.</HI> It may be said, as in Psal. XXXIV. 6. <HI>This poor man cried, and the Lord heard!</HI> GOD will be so Acknowledged, and all Depen∣dencies on Creatures will be so renounced in these <HI>Cries,</HI> that now our SAVIOUR says, <HI>'Tis now Seasonable for me to step in, &amp; save them!</HI> Oh! Nothing like the <HI>Prayer of the Afflicted, when he is overwhelmed!</HI>—The <HI>Im∣portunity</HI> of it, gives those Knocks at the <HI>Gates of Mercy,</HI> which they cannot continue any longer shut upon.</P>
<P>And why may it not be said, It <HI>must be so,</HI> Because our SAVIOUR will in this way keep <HI>Alive,</HI> our <HI>Faith</HI> for the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> Seldom is a <HI>Good Thing</HI> bestowed upon us, <HI>till</HI> we first have had a <HI>Sentence of Death</HI> written upon it. <HI>Extreme Dangers</HI> must bring us to That, 2 Cor. XII. 9. <HI>We have the Sentence of Death in our selves, that we may Trust in GOD who Raises the Dead.</HI> The <HI>Faith</HI> of a <HI>Resurrection for the Dead,</HI> is the <HI>Life</HI> of our Souls. Our GOD keeps
<PB N="17" REF="002043_0019_0FBA8E692B04C970"/><HI>Killing</HI> of us, and causing us to have nothing but a black <HI>Death</HI> in our view; but then He gives us to see, all Alive again. We <HI>Live,</HI> and say, <HI>The Lord has done things for us, which we looked not for!</HI> 'Tis to Illustrate, yea, to Demonstrate this thing unto us. The SA∣VIOUR who does these things, will one day <HI>Shew Wonders to the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, Oh! How Happy, How Happy, they that are in Good Terms with the Glorious GOD! What an <HI>Happiness</HI> to have such a <HI>Friend always ready</HI> to step in, with <HI>Seasonable Interpositions,</HI> when we have any <HI>Extreme Distress</HI> upon us! My Friend, Embrace and Obey thy SAVIOUR, and make sure of such an <HI>Happiness.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>What shall we say to these things?</HI></P>
<P>There will e're long arrive a Day, where∣in that word will be fulfilled; Rev. XX. 12. <HI>The Books were opened.</HI> No doubt, some of the Things to be found in those Glorious <HI>Books,</HI> will be the <HI>Scasonable Appearances</HI> of our Good GOD, for the Help of His Peo∣ple, when <HI>Distresses</HI> have been growing into an <HI>Extemity</HI> upon them. And among the rest, no doubt, the <HI>Divine Appearances,</HI> which have now been given you, will be found in those <HI>Books of Remembrance,</HI> with a much more ample Record of them, in all their Beautiful and Engaging Circumstances.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002043_0020_0FBA8E6B823B4230"/>
But I am oblig'd at this time to proceed no further in the Mention of those Things, whereof I must use the Expression of the A∣postle, upon the Things that occur'd in the Lives of the Ancient Hero's, <HI>The Time would fail me to mention them.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto the Things wherewith I have Entertained you, must have this Title upon them, <HI>These are Ancient Things.</HI> But what remains for me, is, to make some <HI>Remarks,</HI> upon more <HI>Modern Occurrenoes,</HI> wherein the <HI>Divine Appearances,</HI> for our Nation in ge∣neral, and for this Province in Particular, have been such <HI>Seasonable Interposition.</HI> to Relieve in an <HI>Extremity,</HI> as we have hither to observed in the more <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Operations</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>I am to put you in Mind, of some Things done in Later Times, wherein, <HI>Thou hast A∣woke, O Arm of the Lord, Awoke as in the 'An∣cient Days, as in the Generations of Old!</HI> Strange Things done for our Nation, in the <HI>Critical Moments</HI> wherein we had been all Undone, if They had not been Done just when they were, and if the Mercies of our GOD had not <HI>Speedily flown down unto us.</HI> Christians, <HI>Whoso is wise and will observe these things, even they shall understand the Loving-kindness of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>You are all sensible, That our Nation does on THIS DAY, make an <HI>Anniversary
<PB N="19" REF="002043_0021_0FBA8E6D19B80F88"/>Commemoration</HI> of a National Deliverance from a PLOT, <HI>jast Ripe</HI> for Execution, which cannot be Realized, and Considered, without a Shuddering Horror at the Thought,—That ever any Thing in <HI>Humane Shape</HI> could become guilty of so Matchless a Villany! The wish of the Infamous Em∣perour, to see the <HI>Romans</HI> United all so to∣gether, that One Blow at the Neck, might behead them all at Once, was now <HI>very mear</HI> obtained by a crue of horrid <HI>Romans.</HI> In∣credible! Impossible! One of the most fa∣mous among our <HI>New-English</HI> Divines, who was born on that very Signalized <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> his Father call'd him <HI>Thomas;</HI> For, said he, <HI>It will hardly be believed, and this Child will have much ado to Believe it, that ever such a Thing should be found among the Children of Men.</HI> But what is it, that <HI>Popery</HI> cannot be guilty of? How Abomi∣nable, How Execrable, must <HI>Popery</HI> become unto all that will not utterly divest them∣selves of all <HI>Humanity?</HI> Certainly, When the Days of <HI>Intoxication,</HI> continuing to this Day upon, as it is judged, about Fourscore Millions of People, abandoned by the <HI>Un∣searcheable Judgments</HI> of GOD unto it, are over, it will be so!</P>
<P>There having been, by a Probable &amp; Mo∣derate Computation, at least a Million of <HI>Sermons</HI> Preached on this Day, since the First
<PB N="20" REF="002043_0022_0FBA8E6E6092EDA0"/><HI>Act of Parliament</HI> for the Anniversary Com∣memoration, I may be Excused, from any Amplifications upon it. But, tho' we come not into a <HI>Religious Observation</HI> of <HI>Stated Days,</HI> not appointed of GOD, yet I am not willing to let THIS DAY pass, without making at least this <HI>One Remark</HI> upon it; That the Bloody Destruction intended by the more Immediate Plotters to be brought at once upon the <HI>King, Lords and Commons</HI> of our Nation, was all to bring in a <HI>Popish Pretender.</HI> And how any can think to Set a <HI>Popish Pretender</HI> on the <HI>British</HI> Throne, without Shedding of more Blood, yea, and this with the more open Explosions of <HI>Gunpowder</HI> too, than the <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> would have shed, if it had gone on, an hundred and fourteen Years ago,—it ap∣pears an Unintelligible Mystery!</P>
<P>How the <HI>Old Plotters</HI> came to think of <HI>Gunpowder,</HI> as the most agreeable Tool for them to work withal, Some have wondred, who forgot the Fate of him who had been a Father to the King then designed for a Sa∣crifice. This however may be said upon it: It is very Surprising, that a Spanish Writer, whose Name was <HI>Del Rio,</HI> Publishing a Book of <HI>Magical Disquisitions,</HI> and the <HI>Powers of Evil Spirits,</HI> Two or Three Years before our Celebrated <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> puts there the very Case of the <HI>Gun-Powder-Plot,</HI> and
<PB N="21" REF="002043_0023_0FBA8E6FDCD83F30"/>his Decision of the Case, is That a <HI>Father-Confessor</HI> made Privy to such a <HI>Plot</HI> in a <HI>Con∣fession,</HI> ought by no means to discover it. And now, whatever <HI>Hidden works of Dark∣ness</HI> relating to that <HI>Hellish Plot</HI> may remain Undiscovered, until the <HI>Day</HI> of our SAVI∣OURS <HI>Revelation,</HI> we may without any Scruple say, The <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> which <HI>Del Rio</HI> treated of, used their <HI>Instigation</HI> to push on the Conspirators to their infandous Enter∣prize. Could my Sermon reach to any of those, who are at this Day hoping to <HI>Blow up,</HI> whole Kingdoms, and more than Three Nations, that so they may see what their Fa∣thers, <HI>Garnet</HI> and Company, miss'd of, I would Entreat these <HI>New Plotters,</HI> to Exa∣mine seriously, Whose <HI>Instigation</HI> it is, that they are <HI>Moved</HI> withal, when they have so little <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> before their Eyes; And they should hear me saying, <HI>Surely, Thou wilt slay the wicked, O GOD; and therefore, ye Bloody men, Depart from me!</HI> I would Expostulate with such Unhappy People. <Q>When the Just and Necessary <HI>Oathes,</HI> are by the Best of Governours, from a Tender Concern for the <HI>Publick Safety</HI> proposed unto you, with what loud Vociferations do you Complain &amp; Exclaim, That your <HI>Con∣science</HI> is imposed upon? May <HI>Conscience</HI> then be hearken'd to. To Swallow <HI>Oathes,</HI> against a <HI>Dissatisfyed Conscience</HI> is what no
<PB N="22" REF="002043_0024_0FBA8E71815A40A0"/>Good Man would advise you to. But, That you impartially Labour for a <HI>Better Conscience,</HI> a <HI>Wiser Conscience,</HI> One more <HI>Ealightened;</HI> This is the Best Advice that we can give you. 'Tis nothing but a due Regard unto the <HI>Publick Safety,</HI> that makes these <HI>Oathes</HI> to be required of you: the <HI>Publick Safety,</HI> for the Disturbance where∣of, no Plea of a pretended <HI>Conscience</HI> is to be admitted of. And, Sirs, Can your <HI>Con∣science</HI> tell you, That Three Nations ly∣ing in Blood, and the <HI>British Islands</HI> in De∣solations which would require the Pen of another <HI>Gildas</HI> to describe them, would be a <HI>Desireable Spectacle?</HI> Can your <HI>Conscience</HI> tell you, That every <HI>Protestant</HI> in the World, ought to have his Throat Cut, or be Condemned unto <HI>Louisian</HI> Dungeons and Galleys? Can your <HI>Conscience</HI> tell you, That the Religion which your Bible has taught you, should be Extirpated by Fire and Sword, and the <HI>Romish</HI> Idolatries established with the most Barbarous and Inhumane Cruelties? Are you Aware, that you Really are in a <HI>Plot,</HI> for the Ac∣complishment of such <HI>Horrible Things,</HI> while you abet the cause of a <HI>Popish Pre∣tender,</HI> who <HI>must needs go</HI> to do them all: Certainly, 'Tis a fearful Judgment of GOD, for any Man to be abandoned unto such a <HI>Conscience.</HI> Or, Can your <HI>Conscience</HI> tell
<PB N="23" REF="002043_0025_0FBA8E74A03A84D0"/>you, That if a Man be an <HI>Idoot</HI> or <HI>Lunatick,</HI> the <HI>People</HI> are not worse than so, who do not provide (as not long ago, they did in <HI>Fortugal,</HI>) that such an one shall not Sit &amp; Act on the Throne of the Kingdom? Whereas, a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> bound by Principle to Betray and Ruine his <HI>King∣dom,</HI> is a thousand times more <HI>Disqualified,</HI> (as being more <HI>Unrestrainable</HI>) than such an One! Does your <HI>Conscience</HI> tell you a Story of <HI>Hereditary Right?</HI> But, you cannot but know, That <HI>Hereditary Right,</HI> has been many times disclamed, many times diverted, often Superseded in the Succession of the <HI>British</HI> Monarchy. If an <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> may not Limit and Alter, the Succession of the Crown, Those from and thro' whom you derive the <HI>Right</HI> of your Pretender, had <HI>no Right</HI> at all; and so by consequence <HI>He</HI> has <HI>no Right</HI> at all. The <HI>Hereditary Right</HI> which you insist up∣on, (the <HI>Line</HI> whereof has been so often Interrupted!) vanishes into Nothing. You cannot in any <HI>Conscience</HI> insist upon it.</Q> Thus may they be argued with! But these are a sort of People, that NEW-ENGLAND is very much a Stranger to! Our <HI>Soyl</HI> don't agree with People that have that <HI>Venome</HI> in them.</P>
<P>And now, was what our Nation saw in the <HI>Seasonable Deliverance,</HI> which causes
<PB N="24" REF="002043_0026_0FBA8E76A0FE9820"/>our Ancestors to make this Day like the <HI>Days of Purim,</HI> the only Instance wherein GOD our SAVIOUR, has after an astonishing manner <HI>Step'd in,</HI> to rescue us, when we were on the very <HI>Precipice</HI> of a Perdition to be trembled at? No; There was a Mar∣vellous Deliverance wrought for the Nati∣on, <HI>Forty Seven Years</HI> before, by a swift change upon the Publick Affairs; A CHANGE which if it had been delay'd a few Months longer, <HI>England</HI> might have been a Province to <HI>Spain;</HI> And something like the <HI>Spanish Inquisition</HI> had been Esta∣blished in it; But the PROTESTANT RELIGION,—<HI>Whither must thou have made thy Flight, O thou Daughter of GOD!</HI></P>
<P>But I will not insist on a <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> that shone Fifteen Years before this Country was born. I will rather <HI>Stir up your Minds to the Remembrance,</HI> of what has been done in <HI>Our Days,</HI> yea, in the very Year that is now passing over us.</P>
<P>And I pray, How much does the <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> in the Days of King <HI>James</HI> the first, outshine the <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> in the Days of King <HI>James</HI> the second; on which Twice-memorable Day, there Landed on the English Shore, that Illustrious PRINCE, whom GOD rais'd and sent for the Deli∣verance of our Nation, from a Return of
<PB N="25" REF="002043_0027_0FBA8E782C104DD0"/><HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> the Two Grand Plagues of a woful World, and of <HI>Europe</HI> from the Chains that <HI>France</HI> was laying upon it. How Near, how <HI>very Near!</HI>—was the whole PROTESTANT Interest in the World, unto an Apparent Ruine?—Verily, It lay bound on the <HI>Altar,</HI> and the <HI>Knife</HI> was just Ready to Strike, when a Great King was for that purpose United with <HI>France,</HI> and had a <HI>Standing Army</HI> at his command, and there only remained the Experiment of some <HI>New Creations</HI> in the House of <HI>Lords,</HI> and <HI>bold Re∣turns</HI> for an House of <HI>Commons;</HI> to intro∣duce at Once the <HI>Horrible Stroke!</HI></P>
<P>But the Rebuilder of the <HI>Romish Jericho,</HI> found the <HI>Curse</HI> of our Glorious JESUS, to Blast the Enterprize. That unhappy King, had no sooner boasted in a Proclama∣tion, <HI>That there was nothing left now to disturb the future Tranquillity of his Reign,</HI> but a sudden REVOLUTION chased him from his Throne; An <HI>Eighty Eight</HI> brought unto the Nation a Deliverance not inferiour to that of the <HI>Eighty Eight</HI> in the Century that went before it; and a Change came on, whereof he must be very Insensible, who does not make that Acclamation, <HI>The Lords doing, and Marvellous in our Eyes!</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Fifth</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> is the more to be kept in thy Remembrance, O NEW-ENG∣LAND,
<PB N="26" REF="002043_0028_0FBA8E7A2A309D08"/>Because among the Things after∣wards brought into the Light, it was found, That the Establishment of <HI>Popery</HI> in these Colonies, was an Article that had been very particularly provided for.</P>
<P>Thus was our GOD <HI>seen in the Mount!</HI> And it shall no more be said, <HI>The Lord Li∣veth,</HI> who Saved the <HI>Parliament-House,</HI> and all that was in it, from a <HI>Desolation in a Mo∣ment,</HI> and an <HI>Utter Consumption with Terrible Things:</HI> But it shall be said, <HI>The Lord Li∣veth,</HI> who <HI>Step'd in,</HI> at the Moment, when all that is dear to us, was on the very Point of going from us, and by an Happy REVO∣LUTION Enabled us to sing, <HI>Our Soul is Escaped as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fow∣lers; The Snare is broken, and we are Escaped.</HI></P>
<P>The Memory of the Never-to-be-forgot∣ten King WILLIAM, will be for ever precious to all True <HI>Protestants,</HI> but none more than the <HI>New English</HI> ones, on a Thou∣sand Accounts; But very particularly for the Influence which he had on that <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> by which the Succession of the British Crown has been Settled on the Il∣lustrious House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and we see there∣in, what is most Valuable to a <HI>Christian</HI> and an <HI>English-man</HI> secur'd unto us.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="002043_0029_0FBA8E7B2D6F5130"/>
Behold, What a New Field of <HI>Wonders</HI> we are brought unto! And what wonderful <HI>Interpositions</HI> of GOD our SAVIOUR, to make Things Turn well for us, when we have been upon the very Point of being made a <HI>Sacri∣fice,</HI> we are invited now to take into our contemplation!</P>
<P>Every body now knows, That there was a Design with a Strong Hand carried on, to put by that Succession to the Crown, which all the Good Men in the Nations wish'd well unto. One cannot look back on the Story, without being ever now and then in pain for the <HI>Next Event!</HI> Without being Surprized &amp; Amazed at the <HI>Strange Things</HI> which fell out One after another, to disap∣point the Design which the Men that be∣tray'd the Nations to <HI>France,</HI> had brought so near, so <HI>very near!</HI>—to an Execution!</P>
<P>Our Lawful &amp; Rightful King GEORGF, being Peaceably and Wondrously Settled on the Throne of Great BRITAIN, to the Joy of all the Good Men in the World, it was not long before the <HI>Popish Pretender</HI> made an Invasion upon the British Nations, and an Infaruated Party of Self-destroyers made Violent Efforts to bring him in. A <HI>Seasonable Death</HI> gave a <HI>Mortal Wound</HI> unto the Undertaking; very much Dispirited the Undertakers, Disconcerted all their
<PB N="28" REF="002043_0030_0FBA8E7CC7C20DB0"/>Measures! The <HI>Leviathen</HI> at <HI>Versailles,</HI> being Smitten of GOD, Putrified into a most loth some Carcase, and left off to <HI>Make the World a Wilderness, and to destroy the Cities thereof.</HI> The <HI>Tree</HI> that sheltered and che∣rished the Birds of Prey was most <HI>Scasona∣bly</HI> hewn down by the Order of GOD. And the <HI>GOD of Beltel,</HI> in <HI>One day,</HI> gave a <HI>Dou∣ble Defeat</HI> unto the <HI>Insurrections of the work∣ers of Iniquity.</HI> In <HI>One Day</HI> did the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> powerfully defeat them, and both <HI>Dunblain</HI> and <HI>Preston</HI> saw the <HI>Treading down</HI> of all their <HI>Strength.</HI> But He Step'd in, how <HI>Opportunely,</HI> how much at the very <HI>Nick of Time,</HI> which Dispensations to be for ever wondred at!</P>
<P>The Last Winter the Men who are <HI>Like the troubled Sea,</HI> prepared for another Inva∣sion. A <HI>Seasonable Death</HI> again gave a <HI>Mor∣tal Wound</HI> unto the Undertaking; and with∣drew the Assistences which the Undertakers mightily relied upon. A Monatch who had <HI>caused Terror in the Land of the Living,</HI> was most <HI>Seasonably</HI> taken off; And thereby, as the Oppressed <HI>Swedes</HI> have had their <HI>Go∣thick Liberties</HI> Miraculously <HI>Restor'd</HI> unto them, so there was a Thing of Great Con∣sequence done towards the <HI>Priserving</HI> of ours. The Embarcation from <HI>Spain</HI> indeed went on. But, when there was above an
<PB N="29" REF="002043_0031_0FBA8E7E1C09DF28"/>hundred and thirty Years ago, a Descent from <HI>Spain</HI> upon our Fore-fathers, within Navy that called it self, <HI>Invincible,</HI> GOD fought against it, and by the <HI>Stormy Wind ful∣filling His Word,</HI> confounded that Expediti∣on. And now another Descent from <HI>Spain</HI> was making upon us, GOD who holds <HI>the Wind in His Hand,</HI> by His own Irresistible Hand, brought all the costly Expedition to Nothing. But He Step'd in, how <HI>Opportune∣ly,</HI> how much at the very <HI>Nick of Time,</HI> with Dispensations to be for ever wondred at!</P>
<P>O the <HI>Triumphs</HI> of Soveraign <HI>Grace,</HI> in these <HI>Divine Appearances,</HI> for our most Un∣worthy Nations! I <HI>will sing unto</HI> our most Gracious GOD. <HI>for He has triumphed gloriously!</HI></P>
<P>NEW-ENGLAND is Thankfully sensible of the share which it has in the <HI>Seasonable Salvations</HI> wherewith our Nation had been thus <HI>highly favoured of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But then, How many <HI>Peculiar Salvations</HI> hath NEW-ENGLAND seen, wherein our Glorious LORD has must <HI>Seasonably</HI> Interpo∣sed for us, in our <HI>Extremities.</HI> Those <HI>Mag∣nalia CHRISTI.</HI> ever the <HI>Seasonable in∣terpositions</HI> of GOD out SAVIOUR, to deliver us, when <HI>Extreme Hazards</HI> of Ruine look'd very dark upon, us; These are Things which
<PB N="30" REF="002043_0032_0FBA8E81894B3620"/>the History of NEW-ENGLAND is filled withal. <HI>Many a Time,</HI> let NEW-ENG∣LAND now say, <HI>Many a Time, in Affliction, from my Youth, had the Destroyers prevailed against me, if my Glorious Lord had not Sea∣sonably Step'd in to rescue me.</HI> Verily, NEW-ENGLAND <HI>continues to this Day,</HI> having <HI>obtained Help from GOD,</HI> in such Seasonable Dispensations!</P>
<P>One Time above the rest, cannot but be Remembred by many that <HI>remain to this Day.</HI> Some who did then <HI>Jeopard their Lives in the High Places of the Field,</HI> are now in this very Auditory. There was a Time Three and Forty Years ago, when the fierce <HI>Indian</HI> Salvages, having Spred the Flame of a Dubious War, from One End of the Coun∣try to the Other, Every One thought, the Summer then coming on, would be fill'd with Desolations, that would very near have broke Up the Colonics. But Behold, when Things were come to that <HI>Extremity,</HI> GOD Step'd in, and made bare His Almighty Arm for our <HI>Deliverance.</HI> The Enemy distracted like Beasts that are Stung with <HI>Hornets,</HI> fell an easy Prey, to the <HI>People In∣habiting the Wilderness.</HI> Yea, <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Sickness</HI> in a few Months consumed whole Nations of them!</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002043_0033_0FBA8E83ED9CF0E0"/>
This has indeed been the way of GOD our SAVIOUR all along Appearing for us.</P>
<P>What a <HI>Seasonable Provision</HI> did our GOD make for us, by a <HI>Friend on the Spot,</HI> appear∣ing at the Court for us, at the Revolution, that we might be delivered from a Total and Final Deprivation of all the <HI>Privileges,</HI> which distinguished us, from the rest of the Plantations!</P>
<P>How often have we been upon <HI>the very Print,</HI> of being made the <HI>Prey of the Terrible?</HI> Those which are called, <HI>The wild-beasts of the Earth,</HI> have been just coming upon us! But the Great GOVERNOUR of the World, <HI>Seasonably Stepping in,</HI> has very Unexpected∣ly more than Twice done the Things, which have enabled us to say, <HI>Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us as a prey to their Teeth!</HI></P>
<P>How often have our Churches been upon <HI>the very Point</HI> of doing Things which would have been attended with an Unknown Train of <HI>Disturbances?</HI> But their Glorious HEAD <HI>Seasonably Stepping in,</HI> has put a <HI>Stop</HI> unto them, and the <HI>feared Storms</HI> have all blown over.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Who can Utter the mighty Acts of the Lord? Who can shew forth all His Praise?</HI> How long a work would it be to Recapitu∣late the <HI>Seasonable Interpositions,</HI> wherewith
<PB N="32" REF="002043_0034_0FBA8E84E05A8438"/>He has rescued us from <HI>Grievous Things,</HI> when we have been <HI>upon the very Point.</HI> of being overwhelmed with them! Lo, GOD <HI>hath sent from above; He hath drawn us out of many Waters.</HI></P>
<P>The Improvement, which we are to make of this <HI>Experience,</HI> must be to Encourage our <HI>Prayers</HI> and our <HI>Hopes</HI> for the continuance of it. Sirs, Let us Improve our <HI>Experience,</HI> unto that Argument; 2 Cor. 1.10. <HI>GOD, who raises the Dead, has Delivered us from so great a Death, and He doth Deliver; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> trust in Him, that He will still deliver us.</HI> The <HI>Syllogism,</HI> I confess, is not of any such form as our common <HI>Logick</HI> allows of; But <HI>Faith</HI> Legitimates this way of Arguing, and can <HI>Remove Mountains</HI> with it!</P>
<P>You will allow me to use the Language of the Day; and say, There may be Things which may threaten to <HI>Blow up</HI> the Coun∣try, and <HI>Blow up</HI> the <HI>Churches,</HI> which have the <HI>Beauty</HI> and the <HI>Safety</HI> of the Country in them. Let thy <HI>Watchmen set upon thy Walls,</HI> O NEW-ENGLAND, give thee yet more faithful &amp; more solemn Warnings of them, and may their <HI>Visions</HI> prevent thy <HI>Perishing!</HI></P>
<P>But now, Why may we not <HI>Hope,</HI> That before the Distresses which the <HI>Exportation</HI>

<P>Why may we not <HI>Hope,</HI> That the Intenti∣ons of those, who may be willing to see us a <HI>Miserable People,</HI> yea, of those <HI>Treacherous Men</HI> from among our selves, who, to re∣commend themselves unto preferments, pro∣pose and pursue things that would make our Miseries Unsupportable; may by the Hand of our GOD <HI>Seasonably Interposing</HI> for us, and with them that help us, have their <HI>Chariot-Wheels taken off,</HI> so that they <HI>shall drive heavily,</HI> and anon be all <HI>Abortive?</HI></P>
<P>Why may be we not <HI>Hope,</HI> That if any <HI>Rash Doings</HI> may be likely to Discompose our <HI>Churches,</HI> our Strong Redeemer <HI>Seasonably Interposing,</HI> may cause those things to fall out, that will put an End unto <HI>Days of Temptation,</HI> an give them to <HI>Walk on</HI> in the <HI>Right Ways of the Lord,</HI> and in our <HI>Good Old Ways,</HI> in the <HI>Fear of GOD,</HI> and in the <HI>com∣forts of the Holy Spirit,</HI> and <HI>be Multiplied?</HI></P>
