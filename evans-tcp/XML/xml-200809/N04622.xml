<P>Because <HI>SYRIA, EPHRAIM,</HI> and the Son of <HI>REMA∣LIAH</HI> have taken evil Counsel against thee, saying, Let us go up against <HI>JUDAH,</HI> and vex it; and let us make a Breach in it for us, and set a <HI>KING</HI> in the midst of it, even the Son of <HI>TABEAL</HI>: Thus faith the Lord God, it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</P></Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was now a Time of Distress and Fear with AHAZ King of JUDAH, and his whole King∣dom: <HI>His Heart was moved, and the Heart of his People, as the trees of the Wood are moved with the Wind.</HI> The Reason of this sore Amazement, is open'd in the 2d Verse of this Chapter, in these Words, <HI>And it was told the
<PB N="6" REF="005752_0004_1026F56F0F2C4700"/>
House of</HI> DAVID, <HI>saying,</HI> SYRIA <HI>is confederate with</HI> EPHRAIM. The <HI>Original</HI> here rendered <HI>is confe∣derate,</HI> signifies, as a learned Critick observes, <HI>is rested</HI>; and may import, not only that these confe∣derate Forces were joined, but that they were al∣ready encamped in the Borders of the Tribe of EPHRAIM; which was not a great way distant from JERUSALEM the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of JUDEA. And no wonder that AHAZ, and all his loyal Subjects, were surprized at the Tidings of so powerful an Invasion, threatning the Loss of every Thing that was near and dear to them.</P>
<P>IT was while King AHAZ was under fearful Apprehensions as to the Consequence of this <HI>Confe∣deracy</HI> against him, that God sent the Prophet ISAIAH with a special Message to him; partly to hush his Fears, by assuring him, that the Attempt of these Kings to rend his Kingdom from him should prove vain; and partly to forewarn him of the Evil that should befall his Land from another King, the King of ASSYRIA, upon whom he too much depended: Interposing, by the Way, as a sure Ground of Sup∣port to <HI>the House of</HI> DAVID, under their present Difficulty, that remarkable Prophecy concerning the MESSIAH, that he should be <HI>born of a Virgin.</HI></P>
<P>THE Message the Prophet was sent to deliver to him begins with the 4th Verse, where he be∣speaks him in that Language, <HI>Take Heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two Tails of those smoaking Fire-brands, for the fierce Anger of</HI> REZIN <HI>with</HI> SYRIA, and of the Son of
<PB N="7" REF="005752_0005_1026F5717184C9D0"/>
REMALIAH. Some think the Advice here given to the King is intended, at least in Part, to moderate his <HI>angry</HI> Resentments. <HI>Take Heed, and be quiet.</HI> Look to it, that you keep your Temper; that you don't fly into a Passion; and speak unadvisedly with your Lips: Have a Care you don't complain of Providence, and murmur against God for suffering these powerful Enemies to combine together in an enterprize to deprive you of your Crown, and en∣slave your People. But others more probably sup∣pose the Design of the Advice is, to restrain his Fear within due Bounds and Limits: As if it had been said, See that you keep the Possession of your self; don't be dispirited; don't suffer your Heart to melt and fail within you; don't let your Fears prevail so as to betray you into any Thing unworthy your Dig∣nity as a King, or that may reflect Dishonour on God.</P>
<P>AND, as an Enforcement of this Advice, the Prophet, under the Direction of God, compares these <HI>confederate Kings,</HI> in a Way of Contempt, to <HI>two Tails of smoaking Fire-brands.</HI> They seemed to AHAZ <HI>fierce</HI> and <HI>furious,</HI> like burning <HI>Brands of Fire</HI>; yea, his surprised Imagination represented their united Force by a <HI>raging Fire,</HI> whose Violence could not be resisted. But the Prophet, to allay his Fears, assures him from God they should prove no∣thing more than <HI>smoaking Fire-brands.</HI> They might for a while make a Smoother; but they should not be able to do him any considerable Hurt. Yea, he is commission'd to tell him, they were only the <HI>Tails</HI> or <HI>Ends</HI> of <HI>smoaking Fire-brands.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="005752_0006_1026F57683C7F0F8"/>
Their Force was spent; they should soon expire; they should easily be put out.</P>
<P>THE Prophet goes on with his Message in the Words I have read to you for the Text, <HI>Because</HI> SYRIA EPHRAIM, <HI>and the Son of</HI> REMALIAH <HI>have taken evil Counsel against thee, saying, Let us go up against</HI> JUDAH, <HI>and vex it; and let us make a Breach in it for us, and set a</HI> KING <HI>in the Midst of it, even the Son of</HI> TABEAL. <HI>Thus saith the Lord God, it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</HI> In which Words the three following Things are observable,</P>
<P N="1">I. A REPRESENTATION of the <HI>Design</HI> which the confederate Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL had formed against AHAZ; which was to dethrone him, and <HI>set a King in the Midst of his Kingdom, even the Son of</HI> TABEAL.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE Resolution of Heaven to <HI>bring this De∣sign to nought. Thus saith the Lord God, it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Reason</HI> of this Resolution; suggested in those Words, <HI>Because they have taken evil Coun∣sel against thee, saying, Let us go up against</HI> JU∣DAH, &amp;c.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, these are the Particulars we shall distinctly consider; but with all possible Bre∣vity,
<PB N="9" REF="005752_0007_1026F579B0BAC310"/>
that we may have more Time to apply them to the Circumstances of our <HI>Nation</HI> at this Day.</P>
<P N="1">I. The first Thing contained in the Words of the Prophet is a Representation of the <HI>Design,</HI> which the confederate Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL had formed against AHAZ King of JUDAH.</P>
<P>SYRIA, EPHRAIM, and <HI>the Son of</HI> REMALIAH are the <HI>Confederates</HI> spoken of in the Text, as en∣gaged in the Design against JUDAH: But, by a common Figure, SYRIA is here put for the <HI>King</HI> of SYRIA; and EPHRAIM being the known Scrip∣ture Term giving Denomination to the <HI>ten Tribes,</HI> or the Kingdom of ISRAEL, and <HI>the Son of</HI> REMA∣LIAH being their King, he is the Person here in∣tended: So that by SYRIA, EPHRAIM, and <HI>the Son of</HI> REMALIAH, we are to understand the Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL. The same Thing is meant as if these two Kings had been mentioned by Name. To be sure, these were the allied Potentates who had formed a <HI>Design</HI> against the Kingdom of JU∣DAH; and the <HI>Prophet</HI> here opens their Design, and plainly tells AHAZ their King what it was. And this he does by bringing them in, saying, as in the middle Clause of the Text, <HI>Let us go up against</HI> JUDAH, <HI>and vex it; and let us make a Breach in it for us, and set a</HI> KING <HI>in the midst of it, even the Son of</HI> TABEAL. Their Scheme was to de∣throne AHAZ, and set up a PRETENDER in his Room, constituting him King of JUDAH.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005752_0008_1026F57E0EEA8310"/>WHO this Man was they intended to exalt to the Throne, we can't tell at this Distance of Time. He is called in the Text, <HI>the Son of</HI> TABEAL. And this is all we certainly know about him. Some conjecture he was a SYRIAN; others think he was an ISRAELITE; others a <HI>Native</HI> of JUDEA, but in the Interest of SYRIA and ISRAEL, and a fit <HI>Tool</HI> to serve their Turn. This seems most probable; and that he <HI>pretended</HI> some Sort of Right to the Crown, and had a Party in the Kingdom who abetted him. But whoever he was, and whether he pretended a Right to the Crown or not, he was the <HI>Creature</HI> of these confederate Kings, a sutable Engine for them to work with; and therefore they resolve to set the <HI>Crown</HI> of JUDAH on his Head. This was the Design they had principally in their View; and the <HI>Means</HI> they resolved upon in order to ac∣complish it, are particularly recorded in the Text.</P>
<P>THE first Thing they determined upon, in a Way of Means, the Prophet expresses in their own Words, <HI>Let us,</HI> say they, <HI>go up against</HI> JUDAH. The Thing resolved upon is an Invasion of their Land. This they judged necessary; an Expedient without which they might not hope for Success. 'Tis likely a Party in the Kingdom had an Affection for this <HI>Son of</HI> TABEAL, lik'd well the Scheme of making him King, and would gladly be assisting in it, could a Way be contrived to bring about so great a Revolution. Such Intelligence as this at the Courts of SYRIA and ISRAEL might give Rise to their Resolution <HI>to go up against</HI> JUDAH. A considerable Force from <HI>abroad</HI> they judged might
<PB N="11" REF="005752_0009_1026F57FAA01CCA8"/>
countenance the Disaffected at <HI>home,</HI> and spirit them to rise up in Rebellion against their rightful and lawful King: They therefore project an Invasion, as a hopeful Method to succeed in their Intention to displace AHAZ, and set <HI>the Son of</HI> TABEAL on the Throne.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Means they resolved upon whereby to effect this Design was, the filling JUDAH with <HI>Vexation</HI> and <HI>Sorrow. Let us go up against</HI> JU∣DAH, say they, <HI>and vex it.</HI> The Meaning is, Let us ravage their Country, pillage and plunder their Towns and Cities, and so vex and harrass them as to make them weary of adhering to their present King, and willing to take the <HI>Son of</HI> TABEAL to reign over them.</P>
<P>NOR was this all, but they determine upon a more mischievous Means still in order to compass their Design against JUDAH; which was, <HI>to make a Breach in it for them. Let us go,</HI> say they, <HI>and make a Breach in it for us,</HI> i. e. say some, Let us penetrate into the Heart of the Country, advance even to JERUSALEM, the head or capital City of it, and make a Breach in its Wall, a Breach wide e∣nough for us to march in; without which there will be no Hope to set a King in the midst of the Land. <HI>Let us make a Breach in it for us,</HI> i. e. say others, Let us rend the Kingdom from AHAZ, part in Twain, and share it between us; placing over it a King of our own, <HI>the Son of</HI> TABEAL, our very good Friend, in whom we have a joint Interest, and on whom we may both with Safety depend.
<PB N="12" REF="005752_0010_1026F584B6533DE8"/>
<HI>Let us make a Breach in it for us,</HI> i. e. say others, Let us tear the Kingdom to Peices by enflaming the Disaffection there may be in the Minds of the People to their present King, and his Administra∣tion; by promoting Broils and civil Discords among them, dividing and getting them into Parties. Let us work by the discontented, factious and turbulent Spirits there are among them; setting them one against another, whereby they will weaken them∣selves and strengthen us.</P>
<P>AND this Sense of the Words, as it is agreeable to the <HI>Original,</HI> so it well sutes with their Design to set up a <HI>new King.</HI> This is seldom attempted, unless a Nation is supposed to have those within themselves, who will help forward such a Change. And when this is the Case, a foreign Invasion is more likely to effect a Revolution in Government. This might be considered by the allied Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL, and they might go <HI>against</HI> JUDAH in Expectation of <HI>making a Breach in it,</HI> i. e. of dividing the People, stirring up in them a Spirit of Hatred, Animosity and Variance: And they might probably hope to gain a Party from a∣mong them to join in their Attempt against the Crown of AHAZ, and to exalt <HI>the Son of</HI> TABEAL to the Throne.</P>
<P>THIS now was their <HI>Design</HI>: It aim'd at nothing short of overturning the Constitution, of dethroning the King of JUDAH, and setting his Crown on the Head of a vagrant <HI>Pretender.</HI> And the Means in order to accomplish this Design, was an Invasion
<PB N="13" REF="005752_0011_1026DE5850A0D218"/>
of the Land; distressing its Inhabitants, and divi∣ding them into Parties.</P>
<P>AND as they had concerted so plausible a Scheme, they little doubted of Success in the Execution of it: But this the righteous sovereign God would not grant; which leads to the next Thing observable in the Text, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Resolution</HI> of Heaven to bring this <HI>De∣sign to nought</HI>; contained in these Words, <HI>Thus saith the Lord God, it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</HI> Their Measures shall be broken, the Enterprise they have undertaken shall be con∣founded.</P>
<P><HI>IT shall not stand.</HI> This is a Phrase strongly expressive of the divine Pleasure to defeat the In∣tention of these <HI>confederate Kings</HI> against JUDAH. A Design is said <HI>to stand,</HI> according to the Genius of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language, when it takes Effect. Hence that of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> Prov. 30.11. <HI>The Counsel of the Lord standeth forever.</HI> It forever takes Place. On the other Hand, A Design is said <HI>not to stand,</HI> when it fails of its Accomplishment, proves frustrate and vain. And this is the Thing here intended. <HI>It shall not stand.</HI> 'Tis as if it had been affirmed, it shall not be carried into Execution; but, like <HI>the Counsel of the Heathen be brought to nought</HI>; like <HI>the Devices of the People made of none effect.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005752_0012_1026F587D7520438"/>IT is added, <HI>neither shall it come to pass.</HI> In the <HI>Original</HI> 'tis, <HI>neither shall it be</HI>; which may have a further Emphasis in it. For a Thing purposed may be <HI>produced,</HI> and yet not <HI>established</HI>; it may be bro't into <HI>Being,</HI> and for all that fall to the Ground and <HI>come to nothing.</HI> But this Result of <HI>their's</HI> shall never have Existence: <HI>It shall not be.</HI> 'Tis as if the Prophet had said, AHAZ shall not be dethron'd; JUDAH shall not be enslaved. The Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL have design'd this; but it shall no more be, than if they had not formed such a Design: So far from it, that these Kings themselves shall be subdued, <HI>the Riches of</HI> DAMASCUS, the chief Seat of the King of SYRIA, <HI>shall be taken away</HI>; and EPHRAIM <HI>shall be broken that it be not a People,</HI> as it follows in this and the next Chapter.</P>
<P>AND AHAZ, to whom this Message was sent, had reason to depend upon the Truth of its Con∣tents. For it is introduced with a <HI>thus saith the Lord God.</HI> The Prophet did not suggest his own Wishes; he did not deliver his own Conjectures up∣on the probable Appearances of Things: But spake as immediately sent from God, and said nothing but what he was instructed from Heaven to say.</P>
<P>AND that AHAZ might have no Reason for Doubt upon this Head, the Prophet, in God's Name, al∣lows him to ask a <HI>Sign</HI> for the Confirmation of his Faith, Verse 11. <HI>Ask thee a Sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the Depth, or in the Height above.</HI> He is permitted to make his own Choice, to ask such a Sign as he himself pleased, either in <HI>Heaven</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="005752_0013_1026F58CBA1D49F0"/>
or <HI>Earth</HI>; as that the Sun might stand still, or go back, or withdraw his Light for a while; or that there might be a Convulsion in the Earth, or a Re∣moval of it out of its Place, or the like extraordinary and miraculous Performance.</P>
<P>ONE would think this was eno' to satisfy Infide∣lity itself; and yet, AHAZ was faithless and unbe∣lieving. He refused this gracious condescending Offer of God, saying, as in the 12th Verse, <HI>I will not ask.</HI> He pretends indeed a <HI>pious</HI> Reason; <HI>I will not tempt the Lord</HI>: As if it would be a tempting God to do that which he had himself permitted, yea, directed him to do. But this was a meer Pretence. The <HI>true</HI> Reason, why he would not ask a Sign was, because he was resolved to provide for his own Safety a securer Way, as he imagined. His De∣pendance was upon the ASSYRIANS for Help: He chose rather to rely upon an Arm of Flesh, than upon the God of JACOB, in whom is everlasting Strength.</P>
<P>UPON which the Prophet sharply reproves, both <HI>him,</HI> and the <HI>House of</HI> DAVID, for their Contempt of the divine Offer he had made them: But withal lets them understand, that God would notwithstand∣ing give them a Sign. Verse 13, 14, 15, 16. <HI>Hear ye now, O House of</HI> DAVID, <HI>Is it a small Thing for you to weary Men? But will ye weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a Sign; behold, A Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call his Name Immanuel. Butter and Honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the Evil, and
<PB N="16" REF="005752_0014_1026F58E68AA7DF0"/>
chuse the Good. For before the Child shall know to refuse the Evil and chuse the Good, the Land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her Kings</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>A great deal has been wrote, especially in the English Na∣tion, upon this Passage of Scripture, in order to ascertain its true Sense.</P><P>Some are of Opinion, that, by these Words, nothing more is intended, than that one who was now a Virgin should marry and bear a Son, before whose coming to Years of Discreti∣on, the Kings of SAMARIA and DAMASCUS should be destroyed. And they give this Reason, why they put such an Interpretation on the Words, because the Child here promised to be born is given as a <HI>Sign</HI> to the <HI>House of</HI> DA∣VID, that they should be delivered from that Ruin with which they were now threaten'd; which he could not be, if he was not to be <HI>then</HI> born, nor 'till above 500 Years afterwards: For a Sign in Scripture, say they, and in com∣mon Speech, signifies something sensible, something that is at present done in Confirmation of a divine Message.</P><P>Others therefore to avoid this, and some other Difficulties, suppose a double View in the Words; that tho' <HI>literally</HI> they are to be interpreted of a Virgin that was speedily to be married, and bear a Son; yet that they have a <HI>secondary</HI> and <HI>higher</HI> Meaning, looking forward to CHRIST, and pointing out his <HI>miraculous Birth of a pure Virgin.</HI></P><P>But, perhaps, upon strict Enquiry, it will be found, that these Words of the Prophet contain not only the <HI>Sign</HI> he had said the Lord himself would give, but besides that, a <HI>prophetic Promise,</HI> bro't in by Way of Parenthesis, looking forward to CHRIST, and describing the Manner of his Conception and Birth.</P><P>The <HI>prophetic Promise</HI> descriptive of the MESSIAH's Birth, is contained in the 14th and 15th Verses, <HI>Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call his Name Imma∣nual. Butter and Honey shall he eat, that he may know to re∣fuse the Evil, and chuse the Good.</HI> The Evangelist MAT∣THEW, having given an Account of CHRIST as <HI>born of a Virgin,</HI> adds upon it that observable Remark, Chap. 1.22, 23. <HI>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, Behold, a Virgin shall be with Child, and shall bring forth a Son; and they shall call his Name Immanuel.</HI> 'Tis to me very plain, the Evan∣gelist MATTHEW tho't this Passage in ISAIAH a Pro∣phecy of CHRIST; foretelling that he should be <HI>conceived in the Womb of a Virgin,</HI> and <HI>born of one who knew no Man.</HI> And when he says of CHRIST's being born of a Virgin, <HI>that it was, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord, by the Prophet,</HI> it is evident, he speaks of this Event as an Accomplishment of this Prophecy. I know, it has been pleaded by some, that nothing more is intended by the Phrase, <HI>this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet,</HI> than only an Analogy between the Birth of CHRIST, and the Birth of a Child in the Days of the Pro∣phet ISAIAH, an Event now answering to an Event in former Times: But this by no Means comes up to the pro∣per Force of the Expressions here used. In the <HI>Original</HI> the Language is as strong as in the <HI>English</HI> Translation: And there are no Words, either in <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>English,</HI> wherein it could have been more peremptorily declared, that the Con∣ception of CHRIST in the Womb of one that was a pure Virgin, <HI>was the Thing prophesied by the Prophet</HI> ISAIAH, and that this Prophecy received its real intended Fulfillment in the Conception and Birth of CHRIST, as here related.</P><P>The plain Truth is, this Prophecy, strictly and literally inter∣preted, agrees to none but CHRIST; and it was perfectly answered in him. 'Tis evident from the current Strain of the <HI>new Testament</HI> writers, that he was <HI>born of a Virgin,</HI> literally speaking; that he really was the Thing intended by IMMANUEL, <HI>God with us,</HI> God and Man in one Per∣son, God manifested in the Flesh, and dwelling with Man∣kind; and that he was nourished and bro't up like other Children, tho' he was not born like them, but of a Virgin. <HI>Butter and Honey did he eat,</HI> i. e. he was fed, when a Child, with the common Aliment given to Children in those Coun∣tries, which was <HI>Milk or Butter and Honey.</HI> And he was thus nourished, <HI>that he might know,</HI> or until he should know, as the Words might be more intelligibly rendered, <HI>to refuse the Evil and chuse the Good.</HI> So that this Prophecy is strictly and properly applicable to CHRIST, and was fulfilled in him.</P><P>I confess indeed, I can't see how this Prophecy of the Birth of CHRIST could be a <HI>Sign</HI> to the <HI>House of</HI> DAVID, that they should not be cut off; as it was not to be fulfilled 'till so many Ages after its Delivery: But it's easy to see, how it could be an <HI>Assurance</HI> to them that they should not, and an Assurance seasonably and properly given, as, at this Time, they were threaten'd with a total Invasion by two powerful Kings, who had entred into an Alliance for this Purpose.</P><P>But you will ask then, What was the <HI>Sign</HI> here given? For the Prophet says, <HI>the Lord himself would give them a Sign.</HI></P><P>Now, in order to point this out unto you, I must put you in Mind, that when the Prophet ISAIAH was bid to go forth to meet AHAZ, he was ordered by God to take with him his <HI>little Son</HI> SHEAR-JASHUB, as you may see, Verse 3. And accordingly he was the Child that is here given, as a <HI>Sign</HI> to AHAZ and <HI>the House of</HI> DAVID, that they should not be destroyed. Says the Prophet, <HI>The Lord himself shall give you a Sign.</HI> And the <HI>Sign</HI> is given, not in the Words immediately following, <HI>Behold a Virgin shall con∣ceive,</HI> &amp;c.; [These are rather Introductory to the Sign it self, looking forward to the Birth of the MESSIAH of a Virgin] but in the 16th Verse, in those Words, <HI>For be∣fore the Child shall know to refuse the Evil and chuse the Good, the Land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her Kings.</HI> As if the Prophet had said, Before this Child of mine, (pointing to him with his Finger) before this my Son SHEAR-JASHUB, whom God has sent with me, shall come to a Capacity of distinguishing between moral Good and Evil, these Kings, of whom you are so dreadfully a∣fraid, shall be themselves destroyed.</P><P>I own, it would be more natural to interpret the whole Pas∣sage, as one continued Period, speaking <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one and the same Child, if we had not previous Notice that God, for some special Purpose, had ordered the Prophet to take with him his little Son, when he went to AHAZ: And if we consi∣der him as pointing to this his Son, when he delivered these Words, <HI>Before this Child shall know to refuse the Good and chuse the Evil, the Land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her Kings,</HI> 'tis easy and natural to understand him, as speaking, in this Verse, of a different Child from <HI>that</HI> he spake of in the two foregoing Ones: To be sure, AHAZ and those present with him could be at no Loss to under∣stand him in such a Sense. And I see not, while we in∣terpret what is said in the 14th and 15th Verses, as a <HI>pro∣phetic Promise,</HI> bro't in by way of <HI>Parenthesis</HI>; and what is said in the 16th Verse, as the <HI>Sign</HI> given by God to <HI>the House of</HI> DAVID; I say, I see not, that the Interpretation is forced, or that it does at all interrupt the Period, or per∣plex its Sense.</P><P>And I can't but think this the true Construction, because it interprets the whole Passage in a strict and literal Sense, and yet so as to free it from those Objections which have been laid against it, as it has sometimes been explained. For according to this Interpretation, here is an illustrious Pro∣phecy of CHRIST, applicable to him, and to him only; and here is also a <HI>Sign</HI> distinct from this Prophecy, a true and proper Sign, adapted in its Nature to give present and sufficient Confirmation to the Faith of <HI>the House of</HI> DA∣VID, in the Prophet's Message, that they should not be destroy'd by the Attempt that was how making against them.—If any should reject this Interpretation for one that is more natural, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less liable to Objection, I am content.</P></NOTE>.

<P N="3"><PB N="20" REF="005752_0018_1026F597F9C64498"/>III. THE <HI>Reason</HI> of God's Resolution to bring this Design formed against JUDAH to nought; <HI>viz.</HI> because it was an <HI>evil</HI> Design. This <HI>Reason</HI> is sug∣gested in those Words. BECAUSE they <HI>have taken evil Counsel against thee, saying, Let us go up against</HI> JUDAH, &amp;c. The Matter of which their Result consisted was <HI>evil,</HI> and therefore devoted by God to Shame and Disappointment. It was evil in respect of the <HI>Effects</HI> to be produced by it; and it was evil also in it's <HI>moral</HI> Nature, as being an outragious In∣tention of Injustice and Wickedness.</P>
<P>IT was an <HI>evil</HI> Design in respect of the <HI>Effects</HI> to be bro't to pass. These were as dismal as could be devised by the Heart of Man. For not only might the ordinary Mischiefs of War be expected, in Consequence of this <HI>evil Counsel,</HI> but civil Dis∣cord, intestine Broils, Hatred and Variance; which naturally and powerfully tend to divide a Kingdom against it self, and bring it to Ruin. And what is still worse, their Counsels aimed at making a Re∣volution in the Government; at cutting off AHAZ, and setting a PRETENDER on his Throne, to the utter Extermination of the <HI>House of</HI> DAVID. What more shocking could they have enterprized? What more fatal in it's Consequences to the Kingdom of JU∣DAH? Their King; the Succession in his royal Fa∣mily; their civil and religious Interests; their <HI>All</HI> was now threatned by the combined Forces of SY∣RIA and ISRAEL.</P>
<P>BUT this was an <HI>evil</HI> Design also in Respect of it's <HI>moral</HI> Nature. The Thing intended was vile;
<PB N="21" REF="005752_0019_1026F59A7B7CE5A8"/>
a Contrivance formed under the Influence of un∣governed Lusts and Passions, without either Reason or Justice to give Countenance to it. It does not appear that AHAZ had done these Kings any Wrong; without which their taking up Arms against him was highly injurious: Much more their Design to deprive him of his Crown, and place it on the Head of the <HI>Son of</HI> TABEAL; hereby subverting the Con∣stitution of JUDAH, and making that happy People Slaves to a <HI>Tool,</HI> they had no other View in trying to advance to the Throne, than to serve their own base Purposes. There is scarce a Name bad enough to convey a full Idea of the Outrage, Violence, and Injustice of this Intention. It was abominable in the Sight of a holy and righteous God; and he there∣fore resolved to bring it to nothing.</P>
<P>NOT that God always defeats the Counsels that are <HI>evil.</HI> He sometimes suffers them to take Effect, for the Punishment of his own People, and to bring about his own Purposes, in the Changes he has or∣dained should be made in the Kingdoms of this World. But when that which is <HI>evil,</HI> in it's <HI>Nature</HI> as well as <HI>Consequences,</HI> is intended against a Na∣tion, he often interposes for their Help; and some∣times for this very <HI>Reason,</HI> because the Design form∣ed against them is <HI>evil</HI>; hereby testifying against it as a Thing odious in his Sight. Thus it was here. Because the Kings of SYRIA and ISRAEL <HI>took evil Counsel against</HI> JUDAH, therefore <HI>the Lord God said, it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="005752_0020_1026F59DA59B9040"/>AND he might the rather come into this Deter∣mination, because the <HI>Counsel taken against</HI> JUDAH was, in a Sense, a Contrivance to overset an Establish∣ment of his own, forming. For 'tis observable, after SAUL, who was once King of the Jewish Na∣tion, had the Kingdom taken from him for his Ini∣quity, God gave it to DAVID, and settled it on <HI>him</HI> and on <HI>his Sons</HI> in Succession forever. So that this Counsel to set <HI>the Son of</HI> TABEAL on the Throne of JUDAH was virtually an Attempt against God, and that <HI>Suceession</HI> he had established to run in the Family of DAVID.—But I must hasten to the</P>

<P>AND what I propose is, to accommodate what has been said to the Appearances of Providence at this Day. I doubt not but, upon reading my Text, your Thoughts were turned to our <HI>Mother King∣dom</HI>; and while discoursing on the melancholly State of JUDAH, I believe you found within your selves a Readiness to transfer the most of what was said to the present Circumstances of the <HI>British Na∣tion.</HI> There is certainly an Analogy between the two Cases. Suffer me to dilate a little in making it still more obvious to you: And, for Method's Sake, I shall give you what I have to offer under the three following <HI>consentaneous</HI> Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. I SHALL take Notice of the <HI>Design</HI> formed against our <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Nation.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. AS to the <HI>first,</HI> the <HI>Design</HI> against our <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Nation,</HI> much need not be said. You have all been apprised of the <HI>Insurrection</HI> in SCOTLAND, as well as of the Thing intended by it, an Attempt a∣gainst the Throne of GREAT-BRITAIN, to displace our King, set aside the Succession in his illustrious House, and subject the Nation to an <HI>abjured</HI> and <HI>popish</HI> PRETENDER. Nor are any of you ignorant, that this Design was formed and carried on under the Countenance and Protection of two allied Po∣tentates, the Kings of FRANCE and SPAIN, those natural and inveterate Enemies of ENGLAND. At first, indeed, it look'd like a Contrivance of those Princes to keep our Fleets at home, and prevent our sending Forces abroad; but it is now too evident, that they have resolved to make an Attempt against the Person and Crown of our rightful and lawful Sovereign, and are getting in Readiness a Body of regular Troops to be sent into ENGLAND upon this fatal Design. Their Counsel against GREAT-BRI∣TAIN appears to be like that in my Text against JUDAH, <HI>Let us go up against it, and set a King in the midst of it, even the Son of</HI> TABEAL, our com∣mon Friend and Tool, thro' whom we may ac∣complish all our Desire: Which Counsel of their's,</P>

what Progress did King JAMES, the supposed Fa∣ther of the present PRETENDER, make towards bringing upon us this Yoke of Bondage, together with all the Miseries of an arbitrary and tyrannical Government<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The most perfect Account in a little Room, I have met with, of the <HI>popish arbitrary</HI> Measures of King JAMES II. I shall here give you, in the Words of Dr. KENNET, in his <HI>Thanksgiving Sermon</HI> for the <HI>Suppression</HI> of the REBELLION in the Times of King GEORGE the First. <Q>This <HI>popish</HI> King, says he, in a short Time, was to have a new Pre∣rogative, and a Rule of Government unknown to our Ancestors, <HI>His Royal Will and Pleasure.</HI> To evacuate all the Laws, he set up a dispensing Power, and to maintain that Power he set up a standing Army, with∣out and against Consent of the Parliament. He regu∣lated that Army, by bringing in <HI>popish</HI> Officers, and whole <HI>Irish</HI> Troops. He placed <HI>popish</HI> Judges upon the Bench. He set a <HI>Jesuit</HI> near the Head of the Privy Council. He went on to purge the Corporations, by turning out the Men of Abillity and Integrity, and thrusting in new and mean Creatures, for the Tools of Tyranny and Oppression: And to remove all Obstruc∣tions, a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> was issued to compel the Surren∣dry of the ancient Charter, or to declare it null and void, and bring the Election of Magistrates to the No∣mination of the Crown, as in the Capital City. If any Subjects offered to oppose the violent Tide, they were stopped by vexatious Suits, and loaded with exorbitant Fines. A Toleration was indeed granted without Law, and against it, only to divide and break the Protestant Interest, and to open the Gates towards FRANCE and ROME. The Church of ENGLAND had the least Free∣dom: If her Clergy preached against <HI>Popery,</HI> they were silenced, or worse treated; if a <HI>Bishop</HI> would not obey an arbitrary Order, he was prosecuted and suspended; if an <HI>Archbishop</HI> and his <HI>Brethren</HI> did but humbly petition against such extraordinary Proceedings, they were im∣prison'd in the Tower, and brought forth to be tried as Criminals. <HI>Popish</HI> Schools were set up, <HI>Mass-Houses</HI> were open'd in every Town, <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Jesuits</HI> triumph∣ed in their Habits along the Streets; nay they got the Possession of the <HI>Universities</HI> and of the Places of Go∣vernment in them. A whole College was in Effect dissolved by depriving and ejecting the <HI>President, Fellows,</HI> and <HI>Scholars,</HI> and assigning it over to be a <HI>popish</HI> Semina∣ry. An ecclesiastical Commission was set up to vex and destroy the Church.

<P>'Tis true, he has made a great many fine Pro∣mises, in his Declaration from ROME, dispersed a∣mong the People: And so did his <HI>pretended</HI> Father before him, and with as much Formality and So∣lemnity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Upon coming to the Throne, he appeared in Person, and made the following Declaration to his <HI>Privy Council</HI>; <Q>Since it has pleased almighty God to place me in this Station, and I am now to succeed so good and gracious a King, as well as so very kind a Brother, I think it fit to declare to you, that I will endeavour to follow his Ex∣ample, and more especially in that of his <HI>great Clemency</HI> and <HI>Tenderness</HI> to his People.

And we have all the Reason in the World to be∣lieve the Son would do the same. For it is to be remembred, he is devoted to a Religion, which not only sets him free from the Obligation of Promises and Oaths made to <HI>Hereticks,</HI> as we all are in his Opinion; but obliges him, even upon Pain of Dam∣nation, to act counter to them all, whenever he has got Power into his Hands, and is under Advantages to extirpate the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion, and establish that of ROME.</P>
<P>AND can the Settlement of such a Prince on the <HI>British</HI> Throne be for the Good of the Nation? It directly and surely tends, in the natural Course of Things, to its utter Ruin; the Subversion of the Constitution, the depriving the People of their just Rights and Liberties, as <HI>Englishmen</HI> and <HI>Protestants,</HI> and the putting them under a Government which knows no Rule but that of <HI>meer Will and Pleasure</HI>; which is, in one Word, the same Thing with ma∣king them certainly and compleatly miserable.</P>

And what aggravates the Wickedness is, that he is a King who has so sacredly adhered to his Treaties, that not a single Instance can be pointed out, wherein he has violated them to the Injury of either of those Powers who are combined against him: Nor has he ever made an Attempt upon the Liberty, or Property, or Religion of any one Person, within his own King∣dom; but has so managed in the Administration, as to be able to appeal to his <HI>Parliament,</HI> and say, as in his late Speech to them, <Q>I have, throughout the whole of my Reign, made the Laws of the Land the Rule of my Government, and the Pre∣servation of the Constitution of Church and State, and the Rights of my People, the main End and Aim of all my Actions.</Q> And shall a Design be formed, and carried into Execution, against the Person and Crown of such a King? 'Tis vile in Regard of those Powers <HI>from abroad,</HI> and base and unnatural in Regard of those Male-contents <HI>within the Nation,</HI> who have given Encouragement and Aid to it.

<P><PB N="32" REF="005752_0030_1026F5B5D33B4378"/>I wont indeed say, that his Right to the <HI>Crown</HI> is derived to him from God in the same Sense in which AHAZ inherited the Throne of his Fathers.

<P>IT was owing to the <HI>tyrannical, oppressive</HI> Mea∣sures of King JAMES the Second, that he became generally odious to the Nation; insomuch, that when King WILLIAM, of glorious Memory, the Deliverer God raised up for us, came over into ENGLAND", all Opposition fell before him, his and our Enemies were infatuated, so that their mighty Men found not their Hands, nor their wise Men their Counsels; and all the Protestants, how∣ever at other Times divided, united then, and their Hearts were turned to their Deliverer as one Man. <HI>Lords, Commons, Arch-bishops, Bishops,</HI> the <HI>whole Clergy</HI> of all Denominations, and the <HI>whole Body</HI> of the People, except those who were <HI>popishly</HI> inclin'd, ran with one Consent, and met the welcome Bles∣sing with Extasies of Joy.</P>

Legislature has since been confirmed by many Acts of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and from Time to Time sworn to by almost all of all Orders and Degrees of Men in the Nation.</P>
<P>THIS now is the Way in which the Crown was derived to his present MAJESTY; and his Right thus conveyed is unquestionably clear and strong, and renders that <HI>Counsel evil</HI> and <HI>sinful,</HI> whether from Enemies abroad, or Male-contents at home, which would remove him from the BRITISH Throne; and the rather, because the Person intend∣ed to be made Sovereign, is, in Principle, a known avowed Enemy to that Constitution, and those Li∣berties both civil and religious, which our present King has all along defended and protected: Be∣sides which, he is strongly and justly suspected of not being the <HI>legal</HI> Son of that Prince from whom he is said to descend. I know the PRETENDER calls himself the true Son of King JAMES the Se∣cond; and I know also, that a Son was produced while that King sat on the BRITISH Throne; "But (as one observes) there was such bungling Work in that Piece of Management, that, however some have got their Sight cleared now, it was the universal Sense of the Nation then, that there were

the strongest and most just Presumptions of his Illegitimacy."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Declaration which the Prince of ORANGE publish∣ed, vindicating his Design to come over into ENGLAND, one Thing particularly mentioned is, <Q>That there were great and violent Presumptions, inducing his <HI>Highness</HI> to believe, that <HI>evil Councillors,</HI> in order to the gaining more Time for the effecting of their ill Designs, had pub∣lished, <HI>That the Queen had bro't forth a Son</HI>; tho' there had appeared, both during the Queen's pretended Big∣ness, and in the Manner wherein the Birth was managed, so many just and visible Grounds of Suspicion, that not only <HI>He himself,</HI> but <HI>all the good Subjects of this Kingdom,</HI> did <HI>vehemently suspect,</HI> that the pretended Prince of WALES was not born of the Queen. And tho' many both doubted of the Queen's Bigness, and of the Birth of the Child; yet there was not any one Thing done to sa∣tisfy them, or put an End to their Doubts.</Q> <HI>Compleat "History of</HI> ENGLAND, Vol. III. p. 493.</P><P>RAPIN says <Q>It is universally known, that the Birth of this Prince has been very much suspected, and that many then did, and still do, believe it Suppositions. Multitudes of Papers have been published <HI>for</HI> and <HI>against</HI>; some containing the Grounds of the Suspicions, and others Arguments to remove them.</Q></P><P>The Arguments confirming the Opinion, that the Queen was not with Child, when she pretended to be so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that at the Time of her pretended Delivery, only a supposed Son was born of her, I shall sum up under the following Parti∣culars, as I have extracted them from RAPIN, Bishop BUR∣NET, and others.</P><P>1. That the King for certain Reasons, was become incapable of Children. 2. That the Queen had been seven Years without being with Child, and for six Years in such an ill State of Health, that those about her were assured she would have no more Children. 3. That all Things about her person, in the Time of her supposed pregnancy, were ob∣served to be managed with a mysterious Secresy, into which none were admitted but a few <HI>Papists.</HI> 4. That the prin∣cess ANNE, not being well, was urged by the King with an unusual Vehemence, and at his Desire perswaded by others, to go to the BATH; a Contrivance as was thought to have her out of the Way at the Queen's supposed Delivery: For upon her going thither, the Queen's <HI>Reckoning</HI> was altered; and upon News at Court, that Princess ANNE would re∣turn from the <HI>Bath</HI> sooner than was expected, (the Waters either really or pretendedly not agreeing with her) the very next Day the Queen gave out that she would go to St. JAMES's, and <HI>look for the good Hour</HI>; tho' WINDSOR was the Place where Preparations had been made for her lying in, and it was told her it was impossible, on so short Warning, Things could be got ready at St. JAMES's. But she was so positive, that she said <HI>she would lye there that Night tho' she should lye on the Boards</HI>; and accordingly, thither she went that Night: And it was given out, by all her Train, that she was going to be delivered. Some said, it would be the <HI>next Morning</HI>; and the <HI>Priests</HI> said very confidently, <HI>it would be a Boy.</HI> And accordingly next Morning was the Time of the supposed Birth of the Prince of WALES. 5. That her Delivery was on a Sunday Morning, when all the <HI>Protestant</HI> Court Ladies were at Church. 6. That nei∣ther the Princess ANNE of DENMARK, the <HI>Arch-bishop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> nor the <HI>Dutch Ambassador,</HI> were present at her Labour; tho' they were the three Persons who ought prin∣cipally to have been there. 7. That during her Labour the Curtains of the Bed were drawn close, and none came with∣in them but the <HI>Midwife</HI> and an <HI>Under-Dresser:</HI> And a Warming-Pan was brought into the Room not <HI>opened,</HI> under Pretence of warming one Side of the Bed, tho' the Wea∣ther was extream hot, and the Room heated by a vast Crowd of People. 8. That she never satisfyed the Princess ANNE and other <HI>Protestant</HI> Ladies, either of her being with Child, or of her having been delivered of a Child, in any of those Ways which might have carried Conviction with them. 9. That tho' the King, Queen and Courtiers sufficiently knew, before the Delivery, that the Nation suspected an <HI>Imposture,</HI> they did not use those Precautions as they might, and ought to have done, in such a Case; and instead of putting it beyond all possible Doubt, they left so many Marks of Suspicion, as caused infinite Doubts and Disputes, insomuch that some <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> themselves owned, that so impor∣tant an Affair had been managed with great Supineness and Imprudence. Lastly, That upon the Prince of ORANGE's landing in ENGLAND, not only the <HI>Queen</HI> and <HI>Child</HI> went over to FRANCE, but the <HI>Midwife</HI> &amp; <HI>all assisting at the Birth</HI> were sent with them, or so disposed of, that it could never be learned what became of them afterwards.</P><P>If any should desire a more full and critical Account of this Affair, they may meet with it in Bishop BURNET's <HI>History of his own Times.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

FRANCE and SPAIN, be advanced to the BRITISH Throne? God forbid! The Design is abominable. It is so in the Sight of every true Friend to the In∣terest of ENGLAND; and, I doubt not, it is so in the Sight of a holy and righteous God: Which leads me,</P>
<P N="3">3. In the <HI>third</HI> and <HI>last</HI> Place, to mention a few Things tending to encourage us to hope, that God will say concerning this Design, <HI>it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</HI></P>
<P>I have no Commission to declare this to be the In∣tention of God. And indeed, while we consider the <HI>moral</HI> State of the Nation, we have Reason for Concern and Fear. Perhaps, it was never in a more corrupt and degenerate State, than at this Day. Were the Truths of God ever more generally dis∣own'd? Were the Revelations of God ever more generally disbelieved? Were the Commandments of God ever more generally and shamefully violated?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="005752_0039_1026F5CF810F9370"/>The Land of our Fore-fathers may justly be lamen∣ted over in the Language of the Prophet ISAIAH, <HI>Ah sinful Nation! A People laden with Iniquity, a Seed of evil Doers! They have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy One of</HI> ISRAEL <HI>to Anger.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when we turn our View to the Interest of the REDEEMER, which will suffer by setting a <HI>po∣pish</HI> Prince on the <HI>British</HI> Throne, we have strong Reason for Hope. Will God suffer the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> that <HI>Son of Perdition, who hath exalted himself into the Seat of</HI> CHRIST, to be again acknowledged and adored, by a Nation who have declared their Ab∣horrence of worshipping him, instead of the Son of God? Will God suffer the Fopperies and Supersti∣tions and abominable Idolatries of the Church of ROME, to take place among a People who have undergone so much in protesting against them? Will God suffer the chief Bulwark of the Protestant Cause in <HI>Europe</HI> to be broken down and destroy'd? There would be no Unrighteousness in him should he, in this Way, punish us for our Iniquities. But yet, we have great Encouragement to rely on his Power for our Protection and Deliverance, as the Design of our Enemies is really a Design against CHRIST, as well as us; a Design against the pure uncorrupt Religion of the Gospel, as well as against our civil Constitution.</P>
<P>AND it should animate our Faith and Hope to consider, how often, and in what remarkable Ways, God has appeared for our Help, when our <HI>popish</HI> Enemies have laid their Plots as deep as Hell to ruin us; particular Instances whereof might be mention'd, would the Time allow.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="005752_0040_1026F5D11D96CC70"/>AND it looks like a Token for Good, that such a Spirit appears in the Nation, among all Sorts of Men, to oppose this accursed Design, at the Peril both of their Estates and Lives. At first, it may be, it was treated with too much Neglect and Con∣tempt; but since the Defeat of General COPE, and the Entrance of the <HI>Rebels</HI> into the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of SCOTLAND, the Attention of the Nation has been roused; and they are voluntarily mustering, from all Quarters, for the Defence of their King and Coun∣try. And it may be hoped, God intends, in this Way, to put an End to the present Disturbances, and resettle the Kingdom in Peace and Quiet.</P>
<P>THERE are none among his Majesty's Subjects more heartily desirous of this, than WE in these <HI>distant Provinces.</HI> I don't believe there could be found in them all so much as one NEW-ENGLAND Man, but his Indignation is enkindled at the At∣tempt to set a <HI>popish</HI> PRETENDER on the Throne of GREAT-BRITAIN, in the Room of his Majesty King GEORGE the Second. And could the Peo∣ple, inhabiting the several <HI>Provinces,</HI> be gathered together in one general Assembly, I doubt not, they would join Heart and Voice in the Cry of AMA∣SAI, <HI>Thine are we,</HI> DAVID, <HI>and on thy Side, thou Son of</HI> JESSE: <HI>Peace, Peace, be to thee, and Peace be to thine Helpers.</HI></P>
<P>AND horribly ungrateful should we be, if a just Sense of the invaluable Priviledges, <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>reli∣gious,</HI> which we enjoy, under the mild and kind Administration of so gracious a Sovereign and ten∣der Father, did not knit our Hearts to him in Love, disposing us to all Reverence and Loyalty.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="005752_0041_1026F5D2C1D8E298"/>AND shall we be dutifully affected to our Sove∣reign, and not bow the Knee before the Throne of Mercy for him, now that his Enemies are risen up in <HI>Rebellion</HI> against him? This is the only Way, wherein we, who live at such a Distance, can help our King and Nation, in subduing those who are endeavouring their Ruin.</P>
<P>AND let us, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> in this Way, express our Love, and Gratitude, and Loyalty, to our Sove∣reign, and Concern for the Safety of his Kingdom. Let us be constant and importunate in our Suppli∣cations to God, that he would preserve the <HI>Person,</HI> and protect the <HI>Crown</HI> of our rightful and lawful King; cloathing his Enemies with Shame, but cau∣sing the Crown to flourish on his Head, and on the Head of his Posterity forever: And that he would mercifully save his People from <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery</HI>; perpetuating to them the Enjoyment of their <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> which distinguish them from the o∣ther Nations of the Earth. Happy will they be while in such a Case; yea, happy will they be, so long as God is their Lord. And may our <HI>Nation</HI> and <HI>Land</HI> be thus happy, 'till Time shall be no more! God grant it for his Mercy's Sake in CHRIST JESUS.</P>
